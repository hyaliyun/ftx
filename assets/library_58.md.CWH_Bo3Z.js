She is formally known as Swami Chidvilasananda or more informally as Gurumayi (the Sanskrit word translates to \\"immersed in the Guru\\"). The Siddha Yoga lineage (parampara) was established by Bhagawan Nityananda, whose disciple and successor, Muktananda was Gurumayi's guru. Life and career Swami Chidvilasananda is the monastic name of Malti Shetty. She was born near Mangalore, India on 24 June 1955. Malti was the oldest child of a Mumbai couple who were devotees of Muktananda in the 1950s. Her parents took her to the Gurudev Siddha Peeth ashram at Ganeshpuri for the first time when she was five years old. During her childhood, her parents brought her, her sister, and two brothers to the ashram on weekends.Douglas Brooks, Swami Durgananda, Paul E. Muller-Ortega, Constantina Rhodes Bailly, S.P. Sabharathnam. Meditation Revolution: a History and Theology of the Siddha Yoga lineage.

Muller-Ortega, Constantina Rhodes Bailly, S.P. Sabharathnam. Meditation Revolution: a History and Theology of the Siddha Yoga lineage. (Agama Press) 1997, p.99. This history records Chidvilasandna as starting as translator for Muktananda at the age of 20. She translated for Muktananda on his second and third world tours but not on his first.. Note that Caldwell gives the age of Gurumayi's shaktipat as thirteen, not fourteen as stated by Pechilis. On 3 May 1982, she was initiated as a sannyasin into the Saraswati order of monks, taking vows of poverty, celibacy and obedience, and acquiring the title and monastic name of Swami Chidvilasananda, (Sanskrit for \\"bliss of the play of consciousness\\"). At this time Muktananda formally designated her as one of his successors, along with her younger brother Subhash Shetty, whose monastic name was Swami Nityananda.Meditation Revolution, p.115 Muktananda died in October 1982, after which Chidvilasananda and her brother became joint spiritual heads of the Siddha Yoga path. However, Chidvilasananda's brother left the Siddha Yoga path in 1985.S.P. Sabharathnam Douglas Brooks. Meditation Revolution: A History and Theology of the Siddha Yoga Lineage. Agama Press, 1997. page 115. According to his 1986 interview in Hinduism Today, Nityananda left by his own choice, deciding to cease to be a Siddha Yoga Sannyasi but wishing his sister well as sole guru. In the decades of the 1980s and 1990s, Chidvilasananda gave lectures and conducted Siddha Yoga Shaktipat Intensives in India, United States, Europe, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, and Mexico. Through Shaktipat Intensives, participants are said to receive Shaktipat initiation (the awakening of Kundalini energy that, according to Indian scriptural tradition, resides within each person) and to deepen their practice of Siddha Yoga meditation.S.P. Sabharathnam Douglas Brooks. Meditation Revolution: A History and Theology of the Siddha Yoga Lineage. Agama Press, 1997. pages 135-152. Since 1989, the SYDA Foundation - the organization that \\"protects, preserves, and facilitates the dissemination of the Siddha Yoga teachings\\" - has sponsored the Siddha Yoga Shaktipat Intensive given globally each year. Between 1989 and 2006, Chidvilasananda wrote nine books of spiritual discourses, three books of poetry and three books of spiritual stories for children. These books were published by the SYDA Foundation, a US organisation that holds copyright to all Muktananda and Childvilasananda works.Gurumayi Chidvilasananda, Sadhana of the Heart, vol. 1, (South Fallsburg, NY: SYDA Foundation, 2006; second printing 2011), page 16 Chidvilasananda also records spiritual songs (mantras). Philanthropic work In 1992, Chidvilasananda's humanitarian initiative, the PRASAD Project, was incorporated in the United States. The PRASAD project is an NGO in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. The PRASAD Project assists \\"people to achieve lives of self-reliance and dignity by offering programs of health, education and sustainable community development in India, dental care in the United States and eye care in Mexico.\\" In the treatment of cataracts, PRASAD de Mexico has \\"performed free eye surgery on 26,087 adults and children.\\" In 1997, Chidvilasananda founded the Muktabodha Indological Research Institute which now has its own publishing imprint, Agama Press. The mission of Muktabodha, based on Chidvilasananda's original intention for the organization in 1997, is \\"to preserve endangered texts from the religious and philosophical traditions of classical India and make them accessible for study and scholarship worldwide.\\" Through the SYDA Foundation, Chidvilasananda also supports the Prison Project, originally created by Muktananda in 1979. The Prison Project makes the teachings and practices of the Siddha Yoga path available to incarcerated individuals.

Kennedy. After the market experienced decades of growth since the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the stock market peaked during the end of 1961 and plummeted during the first half of 1962. During this period, the S&P; 500 declined 22.5%, and the stock market did not experience a stable recovery until after the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.7%, down 34.95, the second-largest point decline then on record. Background Following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, speculators became more cautious and reluctant about holding on to stocks for extended periods of time. As a result, there was an increased trend of pooling on the bear side of the market‚Äîbetting on stock prices to lower‚Äîand pushing stock prices down further. These bear raids allowed many Wall Street investors to make fortunes, for adequate regulation of inside information had not yet become established. Joseph P. Kennedy, a famous and prominent bear raider, had gained much of his fortune through trading in stock pools. As his wealth continued to grow, he later entered the political sphere as a strong supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Kennedy eventually became appointed as the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a federal agency established by Franklin D. Roosevelt in order to investigate current speculative operations and prevent a downturn like the 1929 crash. During his term as the head of the commission, Kennedy did a thorough job and made a name for both himself and his family. His success and reputation may have eventually helped place his son in the Presidency during the election of 1960. During the time period leading up to the Kennedy Slide of 1962, the economy was experiencing a rapid expansion. From February 1951 to December 1959, the real GDP of the United States had risen significantly. Stock prices had been on a steady rise since the late 1940s, and when John F. Kennedy took office in 1961, he promised that the recovery would continue. After continuing to rise through December 1961, however, the stock market experienced a massive decline. Through June 1962, the S&P; 500 experienced a 22.5% decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 5.7% on May 28, 1962 alone, in what was termed the \\"Flash Crash of 1962\\". Explanations During the time of the Kennedy Slide, the head of the American Stock Exchange, Edwin Posner, explained to reporters that \\"this definitely is not panic selling\\". Instead, he attributed the drop in stock prices as an adjustment from the previous 10 years of growth that the economy had been experiencing. With this drop, Posner believed that stocks were reaching their realistic levels. After a thorough investigation led by a special committee of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the committee concluded that there were clear signs of incompetence, but none of malfeasance that would have warranted further investigation. The SEC had hoped to figure out the causes of wrongdoing in order to pass legislation that would prevent further mishaps, but it did not find any evidence of such behavior. In its report, the SEC concluded that the downturn in the market was due to \\"a complex interaction of causes and effects‚Äîincluding rational and emotional motivations as well as a variety of mechanisms and pressures\\", which led to a \\"downward spiral of great velocity and force\\". The end of the report labeled the market slide as an isolated, nonrecurring incident with precipitating causes that were unable to be confidently ascertained. Recovery President John F. Kennedy was asked by many to address the public about the state of the economy, but he ultimately decided not to do so. Kennedy's advisors pushed for all sorts of remedies, from reducing the margin requirement to announcing a tax cut of $5‚Äì10 billion to holding a \\"fireside chat\\" and discussing the health of the economy. Six weeks after deciding on not taking an action, however, Kennedy reduced the margin requirement and decided on a tax cut, hoping to incentivize large, self-financing companies. The public began gaining confidence after important businessmen and fund managers addressed press about the concerns of the market. J. Paul Getty, an oil tycoon with large investments in Wall Street, addressed the press and explained, \\"When some folks see others selling, they automatically follow suit. I do the reverse‚Äîand buy. I don't think the slide will go on. In fact, I think there will be a rather substantial rise shortly.\\" Walter Benedict, fund manager of the billion dollar mutual fund Investors Planning Corporation, also announced that the market was bullish, stating that his funds had recently purchased $20 million worth of stock. With the backing of successful investors, the public's fears had temporarily subsided, and the stock markets rallied heavily in what became the greatest single day rally since the end of World War II. Although it seemed like recovery was imminent, the stock market continued to be volatile throughout the month of June. A stable rise did not occur until the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October. Aftermath This stock market shock was significant, but it had little immediate effects on interest rate premiums in the credit market. During the entire period, the interest rates remained relatively steady. Because there had not been substantial loan losses or bank failures in decades, the bank system remained remarkably stable, preventing the interest rates from spreading upward. The Federal Reserve made only minor interest rate movements, which helped ease panic in the treasury markets.Mishkin, Frederic. \\"U.S. STOCK MARKET CRASHES AND THEIR AFTERMATH: IMPLICATIONS FOR MONETARY POLICY.\\" NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH (2002). Web. 24 Mar. 2013. . When comparing the highest and lowest points of the stock market during the Kennedy Slide, the paper values of stocks declined 27% during the period of December 1961 and June 1962. The 1929‚Äì1932 bear market, which was a substantial cause of the Great Depression, saw a sharp drop of 89%. Many aspects of the Kennedy Slide of 1962 mirrored those of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, such as the detrimental mix of an extremely volatile stock market, fearful investors, and weak leadership.

Colavito did not place the curse, but the Indians have not won the World Series since the controversial trade. The Curse of Rocky Colavito is a phenomenon that supposedly prevents the Cleveland Indians Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise from winning, be it the World Series, the American League (AL) pennant, reaching postseason play, or even getting into a pennant race. Its origin is traced back to the unpopular trade of right fielder Rocky Colavito to the Detroit Tigers for Harvey Kuenn in 1960. It was not claimed that Colavito placed the curse, and he has denied doing so. It is one of several curses believed to have stricken the city of Cleveland's major sports franchises for decades. The Indians won the American League championship in 1995, 1997, and 2016, but lost all three World Series. Origins On April 17, 1960, the Cleveland Indians traded Rocky Colavito to the Detroit Tigers for Harvey Kuenn. This trade was unique because Colavito was 1959's American League home run champion, with 42, while Kuenn hit .353 as the A.L. batting champion. Fans in Cleveland were outraged by what they saw as the betrayal by the Indians' general manager, Frank Lane. In only two years with the Indians, Lane had taken a mostly successful 40-man roster and had traded away every player he had inherited. Detroit fans were mostly happy about the trade. The idea of the curse was first presented in print by Terry Pluto, who had previously covered the Indians for The Plain Dealer. In his 1994 book, The Curse of Rocky Colavito: A Loving Look at a 33-Year Slump, Pluto suggested that the trade, made by Indians general manager Frank Lane to blunt Colavito's popularity and end his salary demands, led to a 33-season stretch where the Indians did not finish the season within 11 games of first place, from 1960 to . By 1994, the team had not won a pennant since , or a World Series since 1948. In The Curse of Rocky Colavito, Pluto writes of many of the misfortunes that struck the Indians following the Colavito trade: *Getting Colavito back in , from the Kansas City Athletics, but sending pitcher Tommy John and outfielder Tommie Agee to the Chicago White Sox in a three-team trade. John, who had won only two games in the major leagues, would go on to win another 286, mostly for the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees, and play on four teams that reached the World Series. Agee, still a prospect when traded, would win the American League's Rookie of the Year award in . He then would be traded to the New York Mets, where his hitting and fielding would be a major factor in their World Championship season. *Trading pitcher Jim \\"Mudcat\\" Grant to the Minnesota Twins in , for Lee Stange and George Banks. Grant was 28 years old and had won 67 games in his career. After the trade, he would win 78 more, including 21 in 1965, when he helped the Twins win their first pennant. Grant would later return to the Indians as a broadcaster. *The alcoholism of pitcher Sam McDowell, who went from being one of the game's top pitchers in the 1960s to an unreliable pitcher who left the game at age 32. He would eventually stop drinking and become a counselor to athletes with drinking problems. *The mental illness of first baseman Tony Horton, a power hitter who couldn't handle the stress of playing in the major leagues, and left the game in the middle of the season at age 25. Like McDowell, he would receive treatment and recover, but he never returned to baseball. *The rushing of pitcher Steve Dunning to the major leagues. The second overall pick in the 1970 baseball draft, Dunning was brought straight to the major leagues from Stanford University without ever pitching in the minors. Called up too soon, he quit baseball in , at the age of 28, with a career record of 23 wins and 41 losses. *The signing and injury of Wayne Garland. In , Garland, a 25-year-old right-handed pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles, won 20 games and lost only 7. A free agent after that season, the Indians offered him a contract worth $2.3 million over 10 years. But Garland hurt his shoulder in his first spring training with the Indians, and chose to pitch through the pain rather than have immediate surgery and went 13-19 in 1977. He retired in , at age 30, with a career record of 55-66. *The trade of pitcher Rick Sutcliffe to the Chicago Cubs, along with two other players, for outfielders Joe Carter and Mel Hall and two others. Sutcliffe would help the Cubs win the National League Eastern Division title that year and won the NL's Cy Young Award, then won it again in 1989. He won 35 games in just over two seasons with the Indians, then won 114 more after they traded him. Hall was a good hitter but a disappointment, and though Carter became one of baseball's top sluggers with the Indians, they never had a pitcher as good as Sutcliffe while Carter was on the team. Carter would be traded to the San Diego Padres in for catcher Sandy Alomar and second baseman Carlos Baerga, possibly the best trade in the Indians' recent history, as Alomar and Baerga would be major cogs in their 1990s success. The Padres would trade Carter to the Toronto Blue Jays, where he would lead them to back-to-back World Series wins, including , when his home run won the Series. *The baseball preview issue of Sports Illustrated magazine. Following a surprising 84-win season for the Indians in , the cover showed Indians sluggers Carter and Cory Snyder, and carried the words \\"INDIAN UPRISING\\" and the sub-headline, \\"Believe it! Cleveland is the best team in the American League!\\" The Indians lost 101 games that year (finishing with the worst record in Major League Baseball that season), though some believe that this collapse was partially caused by the Sports Illustrated cover jinx as well as this curse. *The spring training boating accident that killed relief pitchers Steve Olin and Tim Crews and nearly killed starting pitcher Bob Ojeda. As reliever Kevin Wickander was so grief-stricken at the loss of Olin that he was traded in mid-season and never regained his effectiveness, the Indians essentially lost four pitchers due to one accident. Since the book's publication in 1994, Pluto has written two sequels: Burying the Curse in 1995 and Our Tribe in 1999, the latter insisting that the curse was still in place. Despite the \\"evidence\\" of a curse on the team, Colavito has denied ever placing one. = Curse beyond Cleveland = On the day of the Colavito trade, the Indians played the Chicago White Sox in an exhibition game at 64-year-old Russwood Park in Memphis, Tennessee. Colavito hit a home run in the second inning, and reporters in the press box were informed of the trade shortly thereafter. Four hours after the game ended, Russwood Park - constructed primarily of wood in 1896 - was destroyed in a five-alarm fire. =Another curse?= Prior to the publication of Pluto's book The Curse of Rocky Colavito, there had been another explanation for the Indians' difficulties, one that came after the 1954 World Series but preceded the 1960 Colavito trade. The Indians fired manager Bobby Bragan in . According to the story, although he always denied it, Bragan walked out to the pitcher's mound at Cleveland Municipal Stadium and placed a curse on the Indians, saying they would never win another pennant.

Beckham County was created in the northeastern part of the state from parts of Carter, Elliott, and Lewis counties. The county seat was Olive Hill. Beckham County was dissolved by the Kentucky Court of Appeals on April 29, 1904. History The legislature first proposed to name the county Hardscrabble County. The proposal then became to name it Goebel County in honor of the late assassinated governor William Goebel. Beckham County was ultimately named for then-governor J. C. W. Beckham. A man named C. V. Zimmerman filed a lawsuit against Beckham County - specifically against its county judge, Captain C. C. Brooks - when Beckham County tried to collect a $75.00 debt from Zimmerman. Zimmerman claimed that under an 1891 Kentucky Constitutional amendment, creation of Beckham County was unlawful because it left other counties with less than 400 square miles (1,000 km¬≤) of land, and that Beckham County itself also had less than 400 square miles (1,000 km¬≤) of land. Carter County joined Zimmerman's suit and added the claim that the creation of Beckham County ran its borders too close to the county seats of Carter and Lewis counties, violating the minimum. Carter County also claimed that the illegal creation of Beckham County would unfairly deprive Carter County of tax revenues that rightfully belonged to Carter County. Beckham County was dissolved by the Kentucky Court of Appeals on April 29, 1904 because it was not created in conformance with state law. Marriage and postal records from the brief existence of Beckham County, Kentucky still exist. The county records are kept in the Carter County courthouse. Beckham County, Oklahoma which still exists today, is also named for J. C. W. Beckham.

In page layout, illustration and sculpture, white space is often referred to as negative space. It is the portion of a page left unmarked: margins, gutters, and space between columns, lines of type, graphics, figures, or objects drawn or depicted. The term arises from graphic design practice, where printing processes generally use white paper. White space should not be considered merely \\"blank\\" space ‚Äî it is an important element of design which enables the objects in it to exist at all; the balance between positive (or non-white) and the use of negative spaces is key to aesthetic composition. Inexpert use of white space, however, can make a page appear incomplete. When space is at a premium, such as in some types of magazine, newspaper, and yellow pages advertising, white space is limited in order to get as much vital information on to the page as possible. A page crammed full of text or graphics with very little white space runs the risk of appearing busy or cluttered, and is typically difficult to read. Some designs compensate for this problem through the careful use of leading and typeface. Conversely, judicious use of white space can give a page a classic, elegant, or rich appearance. For example, upscale brands often use ad layouts with little text and a lot of white space. For publication designers, white space is very important. Publications can be printed on a variety of different papers, which can have different colours, textures, etc. In these cases, white space is used for good presentation and for showcasing the different stocks.

Using the framing device of a collection of papers made by a missing boy, Steven Messenger, it is a mystery story that explores the construction of history. When Steven discovers relics from the wreck of the Batavia while on a school camp, (a diary and a mummified hand with a gold ring on it, the two inside an iron pot), he investigates the media frenzy surrounding them, and in particular the stories of two murderers, Wouter Loos and Jan Pelgrom, from the doomed ship who are banished to what they think is a deserted island for committing crimes of mutiny. The book parallels characters from the past and present in an exploration of human nature, and the presentation of self through the written word. It features an unusual construction, similar to Bram Stoker's Dracula in that the book is an epistolary novel; a compilation of letters, diary entries and photocopies. Hence, there is no one authoritative narrative voice, but a series of narrative voices collected in Messenger's scrapbook. Steven Messenger has several psychotic episodes and eventually kills Charlie Sunrise and a lizard in Strange Objects. Background The book was partly a response to Australia's Bicentenary, which occurred in 1988. This event caused a revival of interest in Australian history, particularly in the \\"discovery\\" of the land. The bicentenary celebrated the landing of the \\"First Fleet\\" in 1788, and the beginning of permanent European settlement in Australia. James Cook charted the east coast of Australia in 1770, however there were a number of sightings and landings prior to this. In Strange Objects, Gary Crew takes the premise that survivors from the Batavia, made it to the mainland, and lived with the Aboriginal people of the area. This actually happened, with European settlers noticing that the aboriginals had fair hair and more complex bush huts, which resembled their houses. Historical basis The Batavia, the ship they were on, sunk in 1629 with 300 people on board (and the Tyrall earlier in 1622). Two hundred and fifty made it ashore, on a tiny desolate sand bank known as Beacon island. The commander Francisco Pelsaert took a long boat with 48 person and sailed to Java to get help, leaving the rest to wait. The man who took charge was Jeronimus Cornelisz. Heretic and psychopath, he instantly rallied up a council and took charge. To maximize his control over the survivors, he left groups of soldiers on nearby islands to look for water and told them to leave their guns. When the soldiers found a water reservoirs on hospitable island (West Wallabi Island) they signalled to the rest with smoke. However, when no reply came, they became instantly suspicious. Jeronimus and his men had killed over 120 people, with another 40 escaping to West Wallabi Island. By the time help came, the soldiers had repelled attacks with improvised weapons, whereas the mutineers had far superior weapons. The commander and the rescue team came, and executed most of the mutineers. Two of the mutineers were set adrift with little food and water. They came ashore on the West Australian Coastline Themes Strange Objects in part examines the place of Aboriginal people, in both historical and in contemporary contexts. The contemporary context is a poor one. The Aboriginal people live in a reserve which is tattered and ruined. They largely shun contact with white society, who refer to them by the derogatory term \\"Abos\\". We also see them in 1629. Here they are masters of the land, and more adapted to survival here than the Dutch sailors. We are also shown glimpses of the 19th century, where the Aboriginal people are largely regarded uncivilised or savage. What unfolds throughout the novel is the complexity of the Aboriginal past including its history told in rock art and passed down in oral stories.

Today it is practised by several Protestant, especially Reformed denominations. Hymns besides the Psalms have been composed by Christians since the earliest days of the church, but psalms were preferred by the early church and used almost exclusively until the end of the fourth century. During the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther and many other reformers, including those associated with the Reformed tradition, used hymns as well as psalms, but John Calvin preferred the Psalms and they were the only music allowed for worship in Geneva. This became the norm for the next 200 years of Reformed worship. Hymnody became acceptable again for the Reformed in the middle of the nineteenth century, though several denominations, notably the Reformed Presbyterians, continue the practice of exclusive psalmody. History The singing of psalms was included in the synagogue service at the time of Jesus. Early Christians appropriated this tradition, as well as many other elements of synagogue worship. The whole congregation may have sung, or there may have been a cantor who would sing each verse with the congregation responding by singing \\"Hallelujah.\\" Such a pattern appears outside the psalms; each song in the obscure early Christian poetry collection known as the Odes of Solomon concludes with a \\"Hallelujah\\", indicating a similar liturgical purpose for its ancient users.Charlesworth, James H., ed. and trans. The Odes of Solomon. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1973, 4. The Psalms of David formed the core of liturgical music for the early church, to which other songs from the Old and New Testaments (canticles) were added. In addition, early Christians wrote original compositions for singing in worship alongside biblical texts. Soon after the New Testament period, psalmody took a preferred position in the worship of the church. There was some hymn-writing in Eastern churches, but in the West psalms and canticles were used almost exclusively until the time of Ambrose of Milan at the end of the fourth century. Even then, the psalms were never completely replaced by original hymns. During the Protestant Reformation, new church music was written in order to revive the practice of congregational singing, which had been replaced by the singing of monastic choirs in Latin. Martin Luther and leaders of the Reformed wing of the Reformation in Strasbourg, Constance, and elsewhere wrote music for psalm texts as well as original hymns, but John Calvin in Geneva used biblical psalms almost exclusively in the Genevan Psalter, though it contained some gospel canticles and catechetical songs. This psalter was to become a prototype for Reformed worship, but Calvin did not have any objection to the use of original hymns in other churches, and he did not appeal to scripture in his preface to the psalter justifying his preference for the Psalms. Once the Genevan Psalter was translated into German in 1573, exclusive psalmody became the dominant mode of Reformed congregational singing for 200 years following John Calvin everywhere but in Hungary. Anglicans had no theological objection to hymns, but they failed to nurture a tradition of English-language hymnody. Works like the 1562 English Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter were very popular among the Reformed. Literal translations of the Psalms began to be preferred by the Reformed over the looser translations of the Genevan and Sternhold and Hopkins psalters in the latter part of the sixteenth century. Some of the most influential psalters of the seventeenth century were the Scottish Psalter of 1635 and the Bay Psalm Book of 1640, which was the first book printed in America. Seventeenth-century Reformed theologians did not reach a consensus on the propriety of hymns in worship, and several argued that they were permissible, including John Ball and Edward Leigh. Thomas Ford also seems to have favored an inclusive rather than exclusive psalmody, while clearly preferring biblical psalms. Benjamin Keach, a Particular Baptist, introduced hymn-singing in his congregation in 1673, leading to a debate with Isaac Marlow, who opposed congregational singing altogether. By the end of the seventeenth century, hymn-singing was on its way to being acceptable among English Baptists. In 1719, Isaac Watts, an early eighteenth-century English Congregationalist minister, published Psalms of David, Imitated in the Language of the New Testament, in which \\"imitated\\" means \\"interpreted,\\" rather than being a strict translation. Some complained that his psalms were not translations at all, but paraphrases. Watts also wrote many hymns, many of which imitated the psalms. The rise of pietism in the eighteenth century led to an even greater dominance of hymns, and many of the Reformed reintroduced hymns in the early eighteenth century. Hymnody became acceptable for Presbyterians and Anglicans around the middle of the nineteenth century, though the Reformed Presbyterians continue to insist on exclusive a cappella psalmody. Biblical basis The practice of exclusive psalmody is sometimes based on a strict (sometimes called 'Puritan') interpretation of the regulative principle of worship, the teaching that only scriptural elements may be included in worship. However, John Calvin did not invoke such a principle in his justification for the practice. Later exclusive psalmodists contended that since God has given Christians a collection of 150 worship songs and provides scriptural examples of them being sung, God requires these songs to be used in public worship and forbids others to be sung (2 Chronicles 5:13, 2 Chronicles 20:21, 2 Chronicles 29:30, Ezra 3:11, Exodus 15:1).

From the Feraclos castle, there is a panoramic view of Charaki, the sandy beach of Agia Agathi, and more far to the south the town of Lindos. Wild mountain sheep and moufflon inhabit the village's surrounding mountains. Generally, the animals congregate in the castle at dusk and remain there until sunrise. Most inhabitants of Charaki are residents of the nearby agricultural village Malona. Visible from Charaki bay is the acropolis of Lindos, the next major town to the village.

Fry covers metre, rhyme, many common and arcane poetic forms, and offers poetry exercises, contrasting modern and classic poets. Fry's starting point can be summed up by the quotation with which he heads Chapter One: 'Poetry is metrical writing./If it isn't that I don't know what it is.' (J. V. Cunningham.) In a 'rant' near the end of the book he states: \\"I think that much poetry today suffers from anaemia. There is no iron in its blood, no energy, no drive\\". Fry sets out to explain the many tools available to a poet in order to organise writing, noting poetry's essential metrical basis and introducing the many technical terms, with explanations and exercises. The book offers twenty 'Poetry Exercises', with one or two in each chapter. The first main section, 'Metre', has six chapters, introducing the natural rhythm of spoken English and many forms of metre. In fact, 28 are listed in the 'Table of Metric Feet' which concludes this major section of the book. The next section, 'Rhyme' has three chapters, explaining the 'basic categories', 'rhyming arrangements' and discussing what is good or bad rhyme. Eleven chapters follow on 'Form', starting with a chapter on 'The Stanza. What is Form and Why Bother with It?' Closed and open forms, heroic verse, forms of ode, ballads, comic verse, sonnets, shaped verse; these and several more are explained along with examples.

The taverna is an integral part of Greek culture and has become familiar to people from other countries who visit Greece, as well as through the establishment of tavernes (œÑŒ±Œ≤Œ≠œÅŒΩŒµœÇ, plural) in countries such as the United States and Australia by expatriate Greeks. History The earliest evidence of a Greek restaurant was discovered at the Agora of Athens during excavations conducted by the American School of Classical Studies in the early 1970s.. Large quantities of cooking and eating utensils were found at the taverna such as plates, mixing bowls, lidded casseroles, spits for broiling meat, mortars for chopping and grinding, as well as a cooking bell and a variety of jugs. Large amounts of fish bones and shellfish remains were also found, revealing the restaurant's offerings of oysters, mussels, murex, and large fish. A nearby wine shop, possibly in association with the restaurant, served local Attic wine, as well as a wide variety of wines imported from Chios, Mende, Corinth, Samos and Lesbos. Establishments serving wine were also present in the Byzantine Empire, as evidenced by a 10th century CE ordinance setting a curfew to prevent alcohol-induced \\"violence and rioting\\".Book of the Eparch 19, as quoted in . Cuisine A typical menu for a modern taverna often includes: * Bread, usually loaf bread, sometimes flat bread * Meat such as lamb, pork and beef * Salads such as Greek salad * Appetizers or entr√©es like tzatziki (yogurt, garlic and cucumber dip), melitzanosalata (eggplant dip), tirokafteri (whipped feta cheese, with hot peppers and olive oil dip), spanakopita and dolmades or dolmadakia - (rice mixture with fresh herbs such as mint and parsley and sometimes pine nuts-and in some regions minced meat is added-tightly wrapped with tender grape leaves and served with a thick and creamy, lemony sauce) * Soups such as avgolemono (egg-lemon soup) and fasolada (beansoup) * Pasta such as spaghetti napolitano, pastitsio (baked layers of thick pasta and minced meat mixture topped with a thick b√©chamel sauce) * Fish and seafood dishes such as baked fresh fish, fried salt cod served with skordalia (garlic sauce), fried squid and baby octopus * Baked dishes (magirefta) including a wide variety of seasonal vegetable dishes such as moussaka (eggplant or zucchini, minced meat, and b√©chamel sauce) * Grilled dishes such as souvlaki * Wine including retsina, mavrodafni and other Greek red/white wine varieties * Beer * Spirits such as ouzo, tsipouro and Metaxa brandy * Fruit * Desserts such as baklava, galaktoboureko, etc. Operations Tavernes usually open at noon, with dinner hours starting at 20:00 and reaching a peak around 22:00.. As tourism has grown in Greece, many tavernes have attempted to cater to foreign visitors with English menus and touts or \\"shills\\" being employed in many tavernes to attract passing tourists. Similarly, tavernes in tourist areas pay commissions to tour guides who send business their way..

Raw files are named so because they are not yet processed and therefore are not ready to be printed or edited with a bitmap graphics editor. Normally, the image is processed by a raw converter in a wide-gamut internal color space where precise adjustments can be made before conversion to a \\"positive\\" file format such as TIFF or JPEG for storage, printing, or further manipulation. There are dozens of raw formats in use by different manufacturers of digital image capture equipment.  Rationale  Raw image files are sometimes incorrectly described as \\"digital negatives\\", but neither are they negatives nor do the unprocessed files constitute visible images. Rather, the Raw datasets are more like exposed but undeveloped film which can be converted (electronically developed) in a non-destructive manner multiple times in observable, reversible steps to reach a visually desired image. (With exposed film, development is a single event that physically transforms the unexposed film irreversibly.) Like undeveloped photographic film, a raw digital image may have a wider dynamic range or color gamut than the developed film or print. Unlike physical film after development, the Raw file preserves the information captured at the time of exposure. The purpose of raw image formats is to save, with minimum loss of information, data obtained from the sensor. Raw image formats are intended to capture the radiometric characteristics of the scene, that is, physical information about the light intensity and color of the scene, at the best of the camera sensor's performance. Most raw image file formats store information sensed according to the geometry of the sensor's individual photo-receptive elements (sometimes called pixels) rather than points in the expected final image: sensors with hexagonal element displacement, for example, record information for each of their hexagonally-displaced cells, which a decoding software will eventually transform into the rectangular geometry during \\"digital developing\\".  File contents  Raw files contain the information required to produce a viewable image from the camera's sensor data. The structure of raw files often follows a common pattern: * A short file header which typically contains an indicator of the byte-ordering of the file, a file identifier and an offset into the main file data * Camera sensor metadata which is required to interpret the sensor image data, including the size of the sensor, the attributes of the CFA and its color profile * Image metadata which is required for inclusion in any CMS environment or database. These include the exposure settings, camera/scanner/lens model, date (and, optionally, place) of shoot/scan, authoring information and other. Some raw files contain a standardized metadata section with data in Exif format. * An image thumbnail * Most raw files contain a full size JPEG conversion of the image, which is used to preview the file on the camera's LCD panel. * In the case of motion picture film scans, either the timecode, keycode or frame number in the file sequence which represents the frame sequence in a scanned reel. This item allows the file to be ordered in a frame sequence (without relying on its filename). * The sensor image data Many raw file formats, including IIQ (Phase One), 3FR (Hasselblad), DCR, K25, KDC (Kodak), CRW CR2 CR3 (Canon), ERF (Epson), MEF (Mamiya), MOS (Leaf), NEF NRW (Nikon), ORF (Olympus), PEF (Pentax), RW2 (Panasonic) and ARW, SRF, SR2 (Sony), are based on the TIFF file format. These files may deviate from the TIFF standard in a number of ways, including the use of a non-standard file header, the inclusion of additional image tags and the encryption of some of the tagged data. Panasonic's raw converter corrects geometric distortion and chromatic aberration on such cameras as the LX3, with necessary correction information presumably included in the raw.Panasonic Lumix LX7 Review - Imaging Resource Phase One's raw converter Capture One also offers corrections for geometrical distortion, chromatic aberration, purple fringing and keystone correction emulating the shift capability of tilt-shift in software and specially designed hardware, on most raw files from over 100 different cameras. The same holds for Canon's DPP application, at least for all more expensive cameras like all EOS DSLRs and the G series of compact cameras. DNG, the Adobe digital negative format, is an extension of the TIFF 6.0 format and is compatible with TIFF/EP, and uses various open formats and/or standards, including Exif metadata, XMP metadata, IPTC metadata, CIE XYZ coordinates, ICC profiles, and JPEG.Adobe: DNG Specification = Sensor image data = In digital photography, the raw file plays the role that photographic film plays in film photography. Raw files thus contain the full resolution (typically 12- or 14-bit) data as read out from each of the camera's image sensor pixels. The camera's sensor is almost invariably overlaid with a color filter array (CFA), usually a Bayer filter, consisting of a mosaic of a 2x2 matrix of red, green, blue and (second) green filters. One variation on the Bayer filter is the RGBE filter of the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-F828, which exchanged the green in the RG rows with \\"emerald\\" (a blue- green or cyan color). Other sensors, such as the Foveon X3 sensor, capture information directly in RGB form (using three pixel sensors in each location). This RGB raw data still needs to be processed to make an image file, because the raw RGB values correspond to the responses of the sensors, not to a standard color space like sRGB. As there is no Bayer or other mosaic, there is no need for demosaicing. Flatbed and film scanner sensors are typically straight narrow RGB or RGBI (where \\"I\\" stands for the additional infra-red channel for automatic dust removal) strips that are swept across an image. The HDRi raw data format is able to store the infrared raw data, which can be used for infrared cleaning, as an additional 16-bit channel. The remainder of the discussion about raw files applies to them as well. Some scanners do not allow the host system access to the raw data at all, as a speed compromise. The raw data are processed very rapidly inside the scanner to select out the best part of the available dynamic range so only the result is passed to the computer for permanent storage, reducing the amount of data transferred and therefore the bandwidth requirement for any given speed of image throughput. To obtain an image from a raw file, this mosaic of data must be converted into standard RGB form. This is often referred to as \\"raw development\\". When converting from the four-sensor 2x2 Bayer-matrix raw form into RGB pixels, the green pair is used to control the luminance detail of the processed output pixel, while the red and blue, which each have half as many samples, are used mostly for the more slowly-varying chroma component of the image. If raw format data is available, it can be used in high-dynamic-range imaging conversion, as a simpler alternative to the multi-exposure HDI approach of capturing three separate images, one underexposed, one correct and one overexposed, and \\"overlaying\\" one on top of the other. = Standardization = Providing a detailed and concise description of the content of raw files is highly problematic. There is no single raw format; formats can be similar or radically different. Different manufacturers use their own proprietary and typically undocumented formats, which are collectively known as raw format. Often they also change the format from one camera model to the next. Several major camera manufacturers, including Nikon, Canon and Sony, encrypt portions of the file in an attempt to prevent third-party tools from accessing them. Dave Coffin, creator of the dcraw program, discusses some of his successful reverse-engineering in this interview, and mentions his enthusiasm for the DNG format. This industry-wide situation of inconsistent formatting has concerned many photographers who worry that their valuable raw photos may someday become inaccessible, as computer operating systems and software programs become obsolete and abandoned raw formats are dropped from new software. The availability of high-quality open source software which decodes raw image formats, particularly dcraw, has helped to alleviate these concerns. An essay by Michael Reichmann and Juergen Specht stated \\"here are two solutions ‚Äì the adoption by the camera industry of A: Public documentation of RAW [sic] formats; past, present and future, or, more likely B: Adoption of a universal RAW [sic] format\\". \\"Planning for [US] Library of Congress Collections\\" identifies raw-file formats as \\"less desirable file formats\\", and identifies DNG as a suggested alternative.Planning for US Library of Congress Collections: Preferences in Summary DNG is the only raw image format for which industry-wide buy-in is being sought. It is based upon, and compatible with, the ISO standard raw image format ISO 12234-2, TIFF/EP, and is being used by ISO in their revision of that standard. The ISO standard raw image format is ISO 12234-2, better known as TIFF/EP. (TIFF/EP also supports \\"non-raw\\", or \\"processed\\", images). TIFF/EP provided a basis for the raw image formats of a number of cameras. For example, Nikon's NEF raw files are based on TIFF/EP, and include a tag which identifies the version of TIFF/EP they are based on.Barry Pearson: What is in a raw file? Adobe's DNG raw file format was based on TIFF/EP, and the DNG specification states \\"DNG ... is compatible with the TIFF-EP standard\\".Adobe: DNG 1.3.0.0 Specification (June 2009) (scroll down a bit) Several cameras use DNG as their raw image format, so in that limited sense they use TIFF/EP too.Barry Pearson: Products from Camera Manufacturers that use DNG in some way Adobe Systems launched this DNG raw image format in September 2004. By September 2006, several camera manufacturers had started to announce support for DNG in newer camera models, including Leica, Samsung, Ricoh, Pentax, Hasselblad (native camera support); and, Better Light (export).Barry Pearson: DNG support, to end-September 2006 The Leica Digital- Modul-R (DMR) was first to use DNG as its native format.Barry Pearson: A brief history of DNG In September 2009 Adobe stated that there were no known intellectual property encumbrances or license requirements for DNG.Adobe Labs: CinemaDNG (final bullet point) There is a \\"Digital Negative (DNG) Specification Patent License\\",Adobe: Digital Negative (DNG) Specification Patent License but it does not actually state that there are any patents held on DNG, and the September 2009 statement was made at least 4 years after this license was published. TIFF/EP began its 5-year revision cycle in 2006.I3A (International Imaging Industry Association): WG18, Ad Hoc groups and JWG 20/22/23 Meet in Tokyo Adobe offered the DNG specification to ISO to be part of ISO's revised TIFF/EP standard.Web archive of widely distributed email: Forwarded Message from a member of the ISO TC42 (technical committee for photography) working group 18 (electronic imaging) standards groupDPReview: Adobe seeks International recognition for DNG A progress report in October 2008 from ISO about the revision of TIFF/EP stated that the revision \\"... currently includes two \\"interoperability-profiles,\\" \\"IP 1\\" for processed image data, using \\".TIF\\" extension, and \\"IP 2\\" for \\"raw\\" image data, \\".DNG\\" extension\\".I3A (International Imaging Industry Association): ISO 12234 Part 2 ‚Äì TIFF/EP (scroll down a bit) It is \\"IP 2\\" that is relevant here. A progress report in September 2009 states that \\"This format will be similar to DNG 1.3, which serves as the starting point for development.\\"NPES: Minutes of ISO/TC 130/WG2, 39th Meeting, see 14f DNG has been used by open-source developers. Use by camera makers varies: the largest companies such as Canon, Nikon, Sony, and some others, do not use DNG. Smaller companies and makers of \\"niche\\" cameras who might otherwise have difficulty getting support from software companies frequently use DNG as their native raw image format. Pentax uses DNG as an optional alternative to their own raw image format. There are 15 or more such companies, even including a few that specialize in movie cameras. In addition, most Canon point & shoot cameras can support DNG by using CHDK. Canon Raw v2, CR2, is mostly based on TIFF TIFF structure of Canon CR2 and lossless Jpeg ITU-T81 Lossless ITU-T81 jpeg compression of Canon CR2 Canon Raw v3, CR3 Describing the Canon Raw v3 (CR3) file format is based on ISO Base Media File Format (ISO/IEC 14496-12), with custom tags, and unknown \\"crx\\" codec.  Processing  To be viewed or printed, the output from a camera's image sensor has to be processed, that is, converted to a photographic rendering of the scene, and then stored in a standard raster graphics format such as JPEG. This processing, whether done in-camera or later in a raw-file converter, involves a number of operations, typically including: * decoding ‚Äì image data of raw files are typically encoded for compression purpose, but also often for obfuscation purpose (e.g. raw files from Canon or Nikon cameras).Ron Day. Understanding & Using the RAW File Format * demosaicing ‚Äì interpolating the partial raw data received from the color-filtered image sensor into a matrix of colored pixels. * defective pixel removal ‚Äì replacing data in known bad locations with interpolations from nearby locations * white balancing ‚Äì accounting for color temperature of the light that was used to take the photograph * noise reduction ‚Äì trading off detail for smoothness by removing small fluctuations * color translation ‚Äì converting from the camera native color space defined by the spectral sensitivities of the image sensor to an output color space (typically sRGB for JPEG) * tone reproduction ‚Äì the scene luminance captured by the camera sensors and stored in the raw file (with a dynamic range of typically 10 or more bits) needs to be rendered for pleasing effect and correct viewing on low-dynamic-range monitors or prints; the tone-reproduction rendering often includes separate tone mapping and gamma compression steps. * compression ‚Äì for example JPEG compression Demosaicing is only performed for CFA sensors; it is not required for 3CCD or Foveon X3 sensors. Cameras and image processing software may also perform additional processing to improve image quality, for example: * removal of systematic noise ‚Äì bias frame subtraction and flat-field correction * dark frame subtraction * optical correction ‚Äì lens distortion, vignetting, chromatic aberration and color fringing correction * contrast manipulation * increasing visual acuity by unsharp masking * dynamic range compression ‚Äì lighten shadow regions without blowing out highlight regions Sample before/after where highlights and shadow detail was recovered using the levels tool, left (raw file), right (jpg final result) When a camera saves a raw file it defers most of this processing; typically the only processing performed is the removal of defective pixels (the DNG specification requires that defective pixels be removed before creating the file). Some camera manufacturers do additional processing before saving raw files; for example, Nikon has been criticized by astrophotographers for applying noise reduction before saving the raw file. Some raw formats also allow nonlinear quantization. This nonlinearity allows the compression of the raw data without visible degradation of the image by removing invisible and irrelevant information from the image. Although noise is discarded this has nothing to do with (visible) noise reduction. = Benefits = Nearly all digital cameras can process the image from the sensor into a JPEG file using settings for white balance, color saturation, contrast, and sharpness that are either selected automatically or entered by the photographer before taking the picture. Cameras that produce raw files save these settings in the file, but defer the processing. This results in an extra step for the photographer, so raw is normally only used when additional computer processing is intended. However, raw has numerous advantages over JPEG such as: * Many more shades of colors compared to JPEG files - raw files have 12 or 14 bits of intensity information per channel (4096-16384 shades), compared to JPEG's gamma-compressed 8 bits (256 shades). * Higher image quality. Because all the calculations (such as applying gamma correction, demosaicing, white balance, brightness, contrast, etc...) used to generate pixel values (in RGB format for most images) are performed in one step on the base data, the resultant pixel values will be more accurate and exhibit less posterization. * Bypassing of undesired steps in the camera's processing, including sharpening and noise reduction * JPEG images are typically saved using a lossy compression format (though a lossless JPEG compression is now available). Raw formats typically use lossless compression or high-quality lossy compression. * Finer control. Raw conversion software allows users to manipulate more parameters (such as lightness, white balance, hue, saturation, etc...) and do so with greater variability. For example, the white point can be set to any value, not just discrete preset values like \\"daylight\\" or \\"incandescent\\". Furthermore, the user can typically see a preview while adjusting these parameters. * The color space can be set to whatever is desired. * Different demosaicing algorithms can be used, not just the one coded into the camera. * The contents of raw files include more information, and potentially higher quality, than the converted results, in which the rendering parameters are fixed, the color gamut is clipped, and there may be quantization and compression artifacts. * Large transformations of the data, such as increasing the exposure of a dramatically under-exposed photo, result in fewer visible artifacts when done from raw data than when done from already rendered image files. Raw data leave more scope for both corrections and artistic manipulations, without resulting in images with visible flaws such as posterization. * All the changes made on a raw image file are non-destructive; that is, only the metadata that controls the rendering is changed to make different output versions, leaving the original data unchanged. * To some extent, raw-format photography eliminates the need to use the HDRI technique, allowing a much better control over the mapping of the scene intensity range into the output tonal range, compared to the process of automatically mapping to JPEG or other 8-bit representation. = Drawbacks = * Camera raw file size is typically 2‚Äì6 times larger than JPEG file size. While use of raw formats avoids the compression artifacts inherent in JPEG, fewer images can fit on a given memory card. However, the large sizes and low prices of modern memory cards mitigate this. Burst mode shooting tends to be slower and shorter due to the larger file size. * Most raw formats implement lossless data compression to reduce the size of the files without affecting image quality. But some others use lossy data compression where quantization and filtering is performed on the image data. Sony's lossy 11+7 bit delta compression of raw data causes posterization under certain conditions. Several Nikon cameras let photographers choose between no compression, lossless compression or lossy compression for their raw images. Red Digital Cinema Camera Company introduced \`.r3d\` Redcode Raw with compression ratio from 3:1 to 18:1 which depends on resolution and frame rates. * The standard raw image format (ISO 12234-2, TIFF/EP) is not widely accepted. DNG, the potential candidate for a new standard format, has not been adopted by many major camera companies. (See \\"Standardization\\" section). Numerous different raw formats are currently in use and new raw formats keep appearing, while others are abandoned. * Because of the lack of widespread adoption of a standard raw format, more specialized software may be required to open raw files than for standardized formats like JPEG or TIFF. Software developers have to frequently update their products to support the raw formats of the latest cameras but open source implementations like dcraw make it easier. * The time taken in the image workflow is an important factor when choosing between raw and ready-to-use image formats. With modern photo editing software the additional time needed to process raw images has been greatly reduced but it still requires an extra step in workflow in comparison with using out-of-camera JPEGs.  Software support  Cameras that support raw files typically come with proprietary software for conversion of their raw image data into standard RGB images. Other processing and conversion programs and plugins are available from vendors that have either licensed the technology from the camera manufacturer or reverse- engineered the particular raw format and provided their own processing algorithms. =Operating system support = Apple macOS and iOS In January 2005, Apple released iPhoto 5, which offered basic support for viewing and editing many raw file formats. In April 2005, Apple's OS X 10.4 brought raw support to the operating system's ImageIO framework, enabling raw support automatically in the majority of macOS applications both from Apple (such as Preview, macOS's PDF and image viewing application, and Aperture, a photo post-production software package for professionals) as well as all third party applications which make use of the ImageIO frameworks. Semi-regular updates to macOS generally include updated support for new raw formats introduced in the intervening months by camera manufacturers. In 2016, Apple announced that iOS 10 would allow capturing raw images on selected hardware, and third party applications will be able to edit raw images through the operating system's Core Image framework. Microsoft Windows =Windows Camera Codec Pack= Microsoft supplies the free Windows Camera Codec Pack for Windows XP and later versions of Microsoft Windows, to integrate raw file viewing and printing into some Microsoft Windows tools. The codecs allow native viewing of raw files from a variety of specific cameras in Windows Explorer / File Explorer and Windows Live Photo Gallery / Windows Photo Gallery, in Windows Vista and Windows 7. As of October 2016, Microsoft had not released an updated version since April 2014, which supported some specific cameras by the following manufacturers: Canon, Casio, Epson, Fujifilm, Kodak, Konica Minolta, Leica, Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, Pentax, Samsung, and Sony. =Windows Imaging Component (WIC)= Microsoft Windows supports the Windows Imaging Component (WIC) codec standard. WIC was available as a stand-alone downloadable program for Windows XP Service Pack 2, and built into Windows XP Service Pack 3, Windows Vista, and later versions. Windows Explorer / File Explorer, and Windows Live Photo Gallery / Windows Photo Gallery can view raw formats for which the necessary WIC codecs are installed. Canon, Nikon, Sony, Olympus and Pentax have released WIC codecs for their cameras, although some manufactures only provide codec support for the 32-bit versions of Microsoft Windows.Understanding RAW Image Support in Windows Vista: Windows Vista team blog Commercial DNG WIC codecs are also available from Ardfry Imaging, and others; and FastPictureViewer Professional installs a set of WIC-enabled image decoders. Android Android Lollipop 5.0, introduced in late 2014, can allow smartphones to take raw images, useful in low-light situations. = Free and open source software = *darktable is a raw-workflow tool for macOS, Microsoft Windows, Linux and other open Unix-like operating systems. The software features native 32-bit floating-point processing and a plugin architecture. *dcraw is a program which reads most raw formats and can be made to run on operating systems not supported by most commercial software (such as Unix). LibRaw is an API library based on dcraw, offering a more convenient interface for reading and converting raw files. HDR PhotoStudio and AZImage are some of the commercial applications that use Libraw. Jrawio is another API library, written in pure Java code and compliant to the standard Java Image I/O API. *digiKam is an advanced digital photo management application for Linux, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS X that supports raw processing. *ExifTool supports the reading, writing and editing of metadata in raw image files. ExifTool supports many different types of metadata including Exif, GPS, IPTC, XMP, JFIF, GeoTIFF, ICC Profile, Photoshop IRB, FlashPix, AFCP and ID3, as well as the maker notes of many digital cameras. *ImageMagick, a software suite for image manipulation and conversion, reads many different raw file formats. ImageMagick is available for Linux/Unix, Mac OS, Microsoft Windows, and other platforms. *LightZone is a photo editing program providing the ability to edit many raw formats natively. Most tools are raw converters, but LightZone allows a user to edit a raw file as if it were TIFF or JPEG. The project was discontinued in September 2011 and reinstated as an open source project in December 2012. *Rawstudio is a raw format developer. *RawTherapee is a raw developer supporting Linux, OS X and Microsoft Windows operating systems. It features a native 32-bit floating point pipeline. *Shotwell is an image organizer available for all major operating systems with the ability to view and edit raw images and has built-in social networking upload capability. *UFRaw is a frontend which uses dcraw as a back end. It can be used as a GIMP plugin and is available for most operating systems. = Proprietary software = In addition to those listed under operating system support, above, the commercial software described below support raw formats. Dedicated raw converters The following products were launched as raw processing software to process a wide range of raw files, and have this as their main purpose: *Adobe Photoshop Lightroom *Bibble Pro (now Corel AfterShot Pro) *Capture One *DxO Optics Pro (now DxO PhotoLab) *Hasselblad's Phocus relies on operating system support to process non-Hasselblad files *Photo Ninja *Silkypix Developer Studio *MagicRaw *On1  Others  *ACDSee Pro is photo management and editing software that supports the raw formats of 21 camera manufacturers. *Adobe Photoshop supports raw formats (as of version CS2). *Affinity Photo supports raw formats. *Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve *DNG Viewer is a free (32bit) viewer for Microsoft Windows based on dcraw. The very simple viewer is installed as RAW Image Viewer, supports some lossless operations, and can save raw images as BMP, JPEG, PNG, or TIFF.ideaMK: DNG Viewer *FastRawViewer is a dedicated raw viewer that runs on Mac and Microsoft Windows, and currently claims to support all raw formats except Foveon. *Helicon Filter supports raw formats. *IrfanView is a freeware/shareware basic editor with support for raw files. *Konvertor support for raw formats is based on dcraw. *Paint Shop Pro contains raw support, although as in the case of most editors updates to the program may be necessary to attain compatibility with newer raw formats as they are released. *PhotoLine supports raw formats. *Picasa (development discontinued) is a free editor and organizer from Google. It can read and display many raw formats, but like iPhoto, Picasa provides only limited tools for processing the data in a raw file. * Silver B&W; Photo Converter offers basic support for editing raw file formats supported by macOS. *SilverFast supports raw formats. *Wild Media Server (UPnP, DLNA, HTTP) support for raw formats is based on libraw. *Transloadit is a Software as a service that supports converting raw files into other formats *XnView support for raw formats is mostly based on dcraw.

For example, \\"Photoshop Raw\\" files (.raw) contain 8-bits-per-channel RGB data in top-to-bottom, left- to-right pixel order. Dimensions must be input manually when such files are re-opened, or a square image is assumed. Due to its simplicity, this format is very open and compatible, though limited by its lack of metadata and run- length encoding.

It was the primary tank used by the Italians throughout the war. The design was influenced by the British Vickers 6-Ton and was based on the modified chassis of the earlier M11/39. Production of the M11/39 was cut short in order to get the M13/40 into production. The name refers to \\"M\\" for Medio (medium) according to the Italian tank weight standards at the time, 13 tonnes was the scheduled weight and 1940 the initial year of production. Specifications The M13 was constructed of riveted steel plates as follows: 30 mm front (as the M11), 42 mm on turret front (30 mm for the M11), 25 mm on the sides (the M11 had only 15 mm), 6 mm bottom (making it very vulnerable to mines) and 15 mm on top. The crew of four were housed in a forward fighting compartment, with the engine at the rear and transmission at the front. The driver and machine-gunner/radio operator were in the hull, with the commander/gunner and the loader in the turret. The Vickers-derived running gear had two bogie trucks with eight pairs of small wheels on each side, using leaf-spring suspension. The tracks were conventional skeleton steel plate links, and were relatively narrow. Together, this system was thought to allow good mobility in the mountainous areas in which future combat was expected. In the desert where most M13s were actually employed, mobility was less satisfactory. The tank was powered by a diesel engine. This was an innovation that many countries had yet to introduce, as diesel engines were the future for tanks, with lower cost, greater range and reduced danger of fire compared to petrol engines. The tank's main armament was a 47 mm gun, a tank mounted version of the successful Cannone da 47/32 M35 anti-tank gun. It could pierce about 45 mm of armour at ; this was sufficient to penetrate the British light and cruiser tanks it faced in combat, though not the heavier infantry tanks. One hundred and four rounds of mixed armour-piercing and high explosive ammunition were carried. The M13 was also armed with three or four machine-guns: one coaxially with the main gun and two in the forward, frontal ball mount. A fourth machine gun was sometimes carried in a flexible mount on the turret roof for anti-aircraft use. Two periscopes were available for the gunner and commander, and a Magneti Marelli RF1CA radio was also fitted as standard equipment. Operational use The M13/40 was used in the Greek campaign in 1940 and 1941 and in the North African Campaign. The M13/40 was not used on the Eastern Front; Italian forces there were equipped only with L6/40s and Semovente 47/32s. Beginning in 1942, the Italian Army recognized the firepower weakness of the M13/40 series and employed the Semovente 75/18 self-propelled gun alongside the tanks in their armoured units. = First actions = The first of over 700 M13/40s were delivered following a rate of production of about 60‚Äì70 a month, before the fall of 1940. They were sent to North Africa to fight the British; however, most units were hastily formed (and thus lacked cohesion), the tanks had not been fitted with radios (giving them a serious tactical disadvantage even against inferior enemies) and their crews had almost no training (in 1940 the crews were given 25 days of actual tank training and then sent to the front). The baptism of fire came with a special unit, the Babini Group. Arriving too late to fight in the September offensive, this unit was ready the next December, for Operation Compass, a British offensive. Tanks of III battalion were present at the Battle of Bardia, where in two days of fighting (January 3‚Äì4, 1941) the Australians suffered 456 casualties while the Italians lost 40,000 men (2,000 killed, 3,000 wounded and 36,000 captured). Further action took place in Derna, where the V battalion had just arrived. On February 6‚Äì7, the British offensive penetrated so far that the Babini Group sought to open a breach in the British lines at the Battle of Beda Fomm in an effort to allow cut-off Italian troops to retreat along the Libyan coast. The attacks failed and all of their tanks were lost. The last six surviving tanks entered a field near the local British command post. They were destroyed one after another by a single two-pounder (40 mm) anti-tank gun. Many tanks were lost in this campaign to artillery fire rather than other tanks. A number of captured M11 and M13 tanks were re-used by the Australian 2/6th Cavalry Regiment and the 6th Royal Tank Regiment, until the spring of 1941, when their fuel ran out and they were destroyed. Italian M13/40 tanks on the streets of Tripoli, March 1941. The M13 also fought in Greece, in difficult terrain and in April 1941, M13s of the 132nd Armoured Division Ariete took part in the Siege of Tobruk, with little success against British Matilda tanks. Ariete had more success with the M13 in the action at Bir el Gubi against the Crusader tanks of the British 22nd Armoured Brigade. =Later use in the desert war= M13/40 tanks advancing across the desert, April 1941 In April 1941, at the time of the arrival of the Afrika Korps, the Italians had around 240 M13 and M14 tanks in first-line service. In 1942, as the Allies began deploying Lee/Grants and Crusader IIIs, along with towed six-pounder anti-tank guns in their infantry units, the weaknesses of the M13 were exposed. In an attempt to improve protection, many crews piled sandbags or extra track links on the outside of their tanks, but this made the already-underpowered vehicles even slower and increased maintenance requirements; such practice, while popular, was discouraged by the commanders for the same reason. The Italians equipped at least one company in each tank battalion with more heavily armed Semovente 75/18 assault guns. The Second Battle of El Alamein saw the first appearance of the M4 Sherman, while some 230 M13s were still in front line service. In several days of battle, the Ariete and Littorio divisions were used to cover the Axis retreat. The Centauro Division was virtually destroyed fighting in Tunisia. By then, the M13/40 and the M14/41 were completely surpassed, and their armament was all but useless against the enemy's M3 Lee and M4 Sherman medium tanks at all but point-blank range, while both could easily destroy an M13/40 from a distance; they resorted to firing at the suspensions and the tracks, and to rely on fire support by the Semoventi and artillery. =Postwar use= During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, two or three M13/40s which were left behind in North Africa were incorporated into the Egyptian armed forces. These were used during the Battles of Negba, where one was knocked out and subsequently captured by Israeli troops. For a few years after the war, the tank remained in the Negba kibbutz as a monument to the battle.Ze'ev Aner (1998). Stories of Kibbutzim. Ministry of Defense Publishing. . Strengths and weaknesses The M13/40 was a conventional light tank of the early war period, similar in capability to other Vickers-derived designs such as the Polish 7TP and Soviet T-26. With a weight of 13 tons, it carried armour comparable to its opponents of 1940‚Äì41. Its 47 mm long-barrelled gun was more than a match for the British tanks of 1940‚Äì41, which were similarly armoured to the M13 but carried 2pdr (40 mm) guns with shorter range and inferior ballistic performance. At that time, most German tanks were armed with 20 mm or 37 mm guns and the gun/armour race led to adoption of weapons of 50 mm calibre only during 1942. The adoption of the 47 mm long gun was probably the best feature of the M13. Due to its relatively large calibre, the main gun's HE round was also very useful against towed guns and infantry, and eliminated or at least mitigated, for the first years of war, the need for a dedicated support vehicle such as the Wehrmacht had in the early Panzer IV and Stug III. The diesel engine was an advantage, and the simplicity of production suited the state of Italian industry. However, the tank also had many grave shortcomings which severely hampered its effectiveness on the battlefield: the engine provided good range, but not great power and reliability. The M13's engine was the same as the M11's, but the newer tank was heavier, which resulted in lower speed and more strain on the powerplant. The suspension and tracks were reliable, but resulted in relatively low speeds, not much better than infantry tanks such as the Matilda. Armament was sufficient for 1940‚Äì41 but did not keep up with the increased armour and firepower on Allied or German tanks. The method of construction, using rivets, was outdated. Most tanks of the era were switching to the use of welding for construction, since rivets can shear off when hit, becoming additional projectiles inside the tank. The two-man turret was less efficient in combat than the three-man turrets used in many other tanks of the era. Radios were not fitted to many tanks. Italian historians Filippo Cappellano and Pier Paolo Battistelli have pointed out that the disappointing performance of the tank early in the war, where its armament was by no means inadequate, can be ascribed to its crews' almost complete lack of training (the first tank training centre was created only in 1941) and experience, coupled with poor tactical doctrine, the lack of radios, and the fact that many units were hastily created and sent to the battlefield, and also to the lack of armoured recovery vehicles; they state that, while the training and experience of the Italian crews improved during the conflict, their tanks' technical disadvantage worsened. In such a condition, they marvel that the Italian tanks were able to fight for as long as they did. Despite heavy operational attrition, the M13 were present at the war's end and a few even managed to survive into the post-war period. One infantry division named \\"Lupi di Toscana\\" still fielded M13s from the late 1950s up to the early '70s in lieu of armoured cars. Variants The M13/40 series was Italy's most-produced tank of the war with over 3,000 having been built, including later variants such as the M14/41. It was equipped with a more powerful engine as well as better air filters for operations in North Africa. The last version was the M15/42 tank produced in 1943, with a better petrol engine and a longer 47/40 gun. It also had thicker armour than the previous models. The Semovente 75/18 self-propelled gun was built by utilizing the M13/40 or M14/41 chassis. The Semovente Comando M40 was an M13/40 tank with the turret replaced by a large multi-piece hatch. The hull housed additional radios and other communication equipment.

In late December 1990, violence quickly enveloped the city as armed militants began clashing with government soldiers. On 1 January 1991, the US Ambassador to Somalia, James Keough Bishop, contacted the Department of State requesting an evacuation of the embassy, which was approved the following day. United States Central Command began planning and mobilizing forces that evening. The initial plan was to evacuate with a military transport plane through the Mogadishu International Airport, but this was later abandoned. A helicopter evacuation via the and was the remaining option. On the morning of 5 January, a 60-person Marine and Navy SEAL security detail was dispatched from Guam aboard two CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters to secure the embassy and prepare for the main evacuation. The two helicopters returned to Guam with the first 61 evacuees. Throughout the day, foreign diplomats and civilians sought refuge at the embassy. Four waves of five CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters each evacuated the embassy compound shortly after midnight on 6 January. The evacuees were transported to Muscat, Oman, where they disembarked on 11 January. In total, Operation Eastern Exit evacuated 281 (with a 282d born aboard ship) diplomats and civilians from 30 countries, including 12 heads of missions (eight ambassadors and four charg√©s d'affaires).  Background  In the late 1980s, there was increasing rebellion against the rule of Somali President Siad Barre, a military dictator who maintained tight control of power and had a record of human rights abuses. By 1990, what began as civil disobedience evolved into a civil war, with several militias organized to overthrow the central government. In July 1989, the embassy moved to a new, compound, from the previous embassy and James K. Bishop was appointed as the United States' ambassador to Somalia. Ambassador Bishop had significant experience in crisis management at US embassies. In 1967, he was at the US Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon when the Six-Day War erupted. About 3,600 Americans were evacuated in 33 hours; Bishop was one of 26 diplomats and soldiers that remained in the city. As deputy assistant secretary of state for Africa from 1981‚Äì87, Bishop chaired several task forces for crises and gained experience in the State Department's operations center as evacuations were carried out during several coups d'etat. During his previous assignment as Ambassador to Liberia (1987‚Äì90), Bishop was overseeing the voluntary evacuation of embassy staff and civilians as a civil war in Liberia spread, when he left in March 1990. Soon after returning to Washington to prepare for his new appointment to Somalia, he was appointed to a taskforce to deal with the crisis in Liberia, which included a gradual evacuation of American civilians and a rapid closure of the embassy in August. On 1 August, before leaving the US to take up his post in Mogadishu, Ambassador Bishop visited United States Central Command‚Äîthe military command for the Middle East and northeast Africa‚Äîwhere he spent most of the day with its commander, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf. Ambassador Bishop, aware of the ongoing strife, believed \\"the odds were better than even that we would have to leave Mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances.\\" Ambassador Bishop understood from his past experiences in Beirut and Liberia the importance of being prepared to deal with emergencies and spent the afternoon working with military experts to review the embassy's Emergencies and Evacuation (E&E;) plan until he was \\"satisfied...that [Central Command] realized that it might have to conduct an evacuation from Mogadishu and was prepared to do that.\\" In its analysis of Operation Eastern Exit, the Center for Naval Analyses cited the Ambassador Bishop's previous experience and \\"clear understanding of his role\\" in the operation as one of the reasons Operation Eastern Exit went so well. Hours after Ambassador Bishop's visit to Central Command, Iraq invaded Kuwait. In 1979, the US negotiated access to an airport and port in both Mogadishu and Berbera; because of limited access the US had to locations in the Persian Gulf area, maintaining this access was a main interest for the Mogadishu embassy to pursue as the US mobilized to intervene in Kuwait. Though, the United States did not have any forces nor did it use Somali facilities in support of Operation Desert Shield. An increasing level of criminal violence prompted Ambassador Bishop to request the voluntary evacuation of dependents (e.g. children and spouses of staff) and non- essential staff in early December, although fighting between the government and the United Somali Congress (a rebel militia) remained no less than about away. The voluntary evacuation later became a mandatory evacuation. By 19 December, the number of official US personnel in the city was reduced from 147 to 37; around the same time, fighting between the government and rebels came within about of Mogadishu. =Collapse of the Barre government= President of Somalia, Major General Siad Barre On 30 December, violence escalated \\"an order of magnitude\\" as militants entered Mogadishu, which was quickly enveloped by a general state of lawlessness. On 30‚Äì31 December, diplomats, including many stationed in offices elsewhere in the city, were collected and housed in the embassy compound, except two volunteers who remained in the embassy's K-7 residential apartments located across Afgoy Road from the embassy. The volunteers in the K-7 building would be needed as look-outs for the embassy compound's main gate. On the morning of 31 December, the defense attach√© was nearly killed when his vehicle was sprayed with bullets and that evening, a soldier at a roadblock shot the tires of a vehicle carrying another defense official. Attempts by the US and other nations' diplomats, in particular the Italian embassy, to negotiate a ceasefire for foreigners to leave were unsuccessful. Afgoy Road became a \\"shooting gallery,\\" preventing those in safe-havens outside the embassy from reaching it. On New Year's Day, the first American civilians began to seek refuge at the embassy. Ambassador Bishop requested an evacuation of the American community on 1 January, indicating that the evacuation could be with the planned Italian, French, or German evacuation efforts, but preferred an evacuation by the US military. The State Department authorized the evacuation on 2 January and on that day, Ambassador Bishop specifically requested an evacuation by the US military, thereby initiating Operation Eastern Exit. Ambassador Bishop had spent a considerable amount of time discussing contingency plans for evacuation with other diplomatic posts. Ultimately, ten heads of missions‚Äîeight ambassadors and two charg√©s d'affaires‚Äîalong with their staff sought refuge in the US embassy compound and were evacuated. Plans, mobilization, and escalating violence Ambassador Bishop had visited Central Command in August 1990, where he worked with military experts to update the embassy's E&E; plan. The first notice that an evacuation of the Mogadishu embassy would be needed came on the morning of 1 January, when the top naval commander at Central Command sent a message to his naval operations staff: \\"Better have Amphib crowd take a look at a helo NEO of Mogadishu! time/distance to get there from Masirah OP area.\\" Following the ambassador's 2 January evacuation request, the commander of Central Command ordered Air Force aircraft to the region, the movement of amphibious ships to Mogadishu, and requested United States Special Operations Command to prepare for a noncombatant evacuation operation. The initial plan was to evacuate via Mogadishu International Airport. Soon after the evacuation request, the United States Air Force deployed C-130 transport planes and an AC-130, for gunfire support, to Nairobi, Kenya, awaiting clearances to enter Somalia and the ability to safely transfer evacuees from the embassy to the airport. However, the US and other foreign embassies were unable to contact anyone within the government to obtain clearances. It also became apparent that the rebels had an ineffective command-and-control structure, making it impossible to negotiate any ceasefire or guarantee of safe passage. Likewise, government troops faced a command-and-control problem; reports indicated that army units were separating along clan lines, in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different clan when given orders they disagreed with. Thus, it became clear that safe passage to the airport would not be possible. Several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach Mogadishu, but faced the same problems of landing and transit of evacuees to the airport. On 4 January, several incidents, including a couple exchanges of gunfire, suggested that the embassy's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed Somalis until the USS Guam and USS Trenton arrived with their helicopters and soldiers, at that time scheduled to arrive on 7 January. The embassy had just six Marine guards, whose job was limited to protecting the chancery. Ambassador Bishop made an urgent request to Washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy to defend it until the ships arrived. The request was denied, but the Ambassador was told that an advance element from the vessels would reach the embassy the following morning. USS Guam USS Guam and USS Trenton began transit from the coast of Oman towards Mogadishu at 22:30 (23:30 Oman time) on 2 January. The commander of Amphibious Group 2 (PHIBGRU TWO) had initially proposed a seven-ship Amphibious Task Group, composed of vessels anchored at Masirah Island (off Oman) and Dubai and including four amphibious ships so that the full range of amphibious capabilities would be available for the operation. However, intervention in Kuwait seemed imminent and Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, did not want to divert that many ships from the Persian Gulf (and was mindful of the ongoing extended deployment of Operation Sharp Edge off Liberia), thus the decision to send just two ships. Although the two vessels were selected by mid-afternoon on 2 January, the transfer of some personnel from Dubai to Masirah and a decision to refuel the two ships (again, due to the potential risk of an extended operation like Sharp Edge) delayed departure by about ten hours. Guam and Trenton carried forces from the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, including a detachment of CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters‚Äîthe largest helicopters operated by the US military‚Äîand two squadrons of CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters. USS Trenton Planning began in earnest as the ships got underway, with a combined command center on Guam. On the morning of 3 January, the task force's command questioned why they were not given the option of an amphibious landing and requested a tank landing ship be added to the task force. The Seventh Fleet command staff, which were Pacific based, did not understand this request and denied the request. The various military staffs were operating with different sets of information. Aboard Guam, a warrant officer who had previously served as a Marine Security Guard (MSG) at the Mogadishu embassy during the mid-1980s was found. The former MSG looked at the aboard ship material and said it was incorrect.. The former MSG told planners that a new embassy had been planned and was under construction several years prior. In fact, the new embassy was located further inland. The two ships were from PHIBGRU Two and the Marines from the Second Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB), both East Coast commands. They had received old intelligence material about Mogadishu. The Seventh Fleet staff had up-to-date information with the embassies actual location. After receiving updated information, task force commanders determined that a beach landing, requiring troops to fight their way across the city, was too risky. Initial plans had the ships launch their helicopters at 01:00 on 7 January from just off the coast. However, in response to indications from Ambassador Bishop that conditions in Mogadishu were deteriorating, planners considered and, later, flights with the CH-53Es while the ships were still located in the northern Arabian Sea. The situation in Mogadishu stabilized somewhat and the mission was delayed until 5 January. Evacuation Embassy compound viewed in 1992, after it was re-occupied to serve as headquarters for Operation Restore Hope. The walled chancery (foreground) is most prominent, but it was further located within the walled embassy compound (note wall in upper left, top). The administrative office building (top right) and Marine House (top, right of center) are visible. The helicopter landing zone was between the chancery and Marine House, above the roundabout. On the evening of 4 January, the final execute order was issued for a 02:45 launch of two CH-53E Super Stallions to arrive at the embassy at dawn. The 60 soldiers selected for the security detail were issued weapons and ammunition. Two Marine Corps KC-130 refueling tankers were mobilized closer to the operation, from Bahrain to Oman, to refuel the helicopters en route to Mogadishu and the two helicopters transferred from Trenton to Guam. =Security detail and first evacuees= Two CH-53E Super Stallions carrying a 60-man security detail‚Äî51 Marines and nine Navy SEALs‚Äîdeparted Guam at 02:47, from the embassy, and were expected to arrive at 06:20. They performed two aerial refuelings. During the first refueling, a pipe burst on one of the helicopters, dousing Marines in fuel and nearly forcing a return to the Guam; problems with the helicopters' navigation system also complicated the refueling rendezvous. The helicopters arrived in Mogadishu at dawn, crossing the coast just south of the harbor at in altitude on a route that was planned to avoid areas of more intense violence reported in the northern parts of the city. On their arrival in Mogadishu, the crew of the helicopters were using an outdated 1969 map, which showed the embassy in an isolated area. Furthermore, they had been told the embassy could be discerned by its white stucco perimeter wall and golf course. The embassy was, in fact, surrounded by new development and the crew saw white stucco walls around many buildings in the city. The helicopters were flying too low to spot a strobe light which was placed on the embassy's water tower (the highest point within the embassy compound) and the golf course in the embassy compound had a black, oil-coated surface‚Äînot the familiar green grass that the helicopter crew would recognize.After breaking radio silence (their only direct communication with the embassy was unencrypted) to contact the embassy, they were able to discern it and land at 07:10. As they arrived, a group of about 100 to 150 Somalis were attempting to enter the embassy compound via ladders on the wall, but scattered as the helicopters arrived. The security detail moved to establish a perimeter around the embassy compound and the Air Force's AC-130 arrived to provide overhead support. Ambassador Bishop gave the security detail clear instructions on the rules of engagement: they could only use deadly force if people came over the embassy compound's walls with obvious hostile intent. He also identified three zones of defense, stating a preference to retreat to the third zone before the use of deadly force: *the entire embassy compound *the Chancery, Joint Administrative Office (JAO) building, Marine House, and the helicopter landing zone (HLZ) *the chancery and JAO buildings (the two \\"safehaven\\" buildings where the evacuees were held) Ambassador Bishop clearly explained his rationale to the security detail, which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in the violence in Mogadishu. He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes got the impression that the US was intervening in the conflict. To this effect, he requested the Voice of America and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict. The Marines who had been doused in fuel during the refueling were able to take a shower and wash their clothes. USS Bataan, a ship similar to Guam After an hour on the ground, the helicopters left with the first 61 evacuees, including all American civilians and four heads of mission. Evacuees were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm. Complications with the only in-flight refueling on the return nearly prevented refueling, which would have forced the helicopters to divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue. At 9:40, the helicopters arrived on Guam and unloaded the evacuees. =Embassy during the day= No threats came upon the embassy during the day, although truckloads of armed Somalis frequently drove by the embassy along Afghoy Road. Only one incident seemed to directly target the embassy. A sniper and a spotter were positioned on the embassy's water tower (the highest structure in the compound) and came under fire; they were ordered to not return fire and soon thereafter ordered to leave their position on the water tower. The Office of Military Cooperation, just one and a half blocks from the embassy, required evacuation. Despite its proximity to the embassy, an armed convoy was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by the unrest. A convoy of vehicles with several Marines and SEALs left the embassy at 8:47 and returned ten minutes later with 22 persons from the OMC (four Americans, a Filipino, and 17 Kenyans). This was the only excursion outside the embassy by the security detail. Throughout the day, foreign diplomats contacted the embassy desiring to be evacuated; the US welcomed these requests, but required all of them to find their own transportation to the embassy. A Somali officer who had a previous relationship with the embassy, Major Siad, agreed to travel to rescue the German charg√© d'affaires and British ambassador (junior staff from the British embassy had previously come to the US embassy). The Soviet Union was unable to land a plane in Mogadishu the previous day and the Soviet ambassador asked Ambassador Bishop if he and his staff could be rescued; Ambassador Bishop, a tennis partner of his Soviet counterpart, agreed but only if they found their own way to the embassy. Seeing the helicopters on the morning of 5 January, they realized the Americans would not remain in the city much longer. At the request of Ambassador Bishop, Major Siad agreed to transport the Soviets, but only if he was paid enough; the US embassy paid Major Siad, who returned with the Soviet ambassador and 38 of his staff. The brother of President Barre, who was also a Major General and Chief of Police, showed up at the embassy in the afternoon with 25 members of his family requesting to be evacuated, but was turned away after a vocal conversation with the ambassador. The operation did not include soldiers to handle the evacuation control center (ECC), which was set up in the JAO. A 44-person force consisting primarily of soldiers to handle the ECC was planned for insertion with the CH-53E Super Stallions after they had returned to the Guam. However, this was cancelled over objections from the commander of the security detail. The deficit was partially handled by embassy staff who assisted a few soldiers from the security detail. The evacuees were grouped into 15-person \\"sticks\\" to be loaded onto the helicopters and were limited to one piece of luggage apiece. Some attempted to bring more, resulting in problems coordinating their evacuation. Furthermore, many evacuees had pets they wanted to bring, which were not allowed. Most pets were killed by their owners; some were given poison. Meanwhile, the soldiers were allowed to consume anything they wanted from the embassy's commissary, such as candy, sodas, and souvenirs (most had been stationed on ships for several months). They were also allowed use or take anything they needed from the embassy; the medic filled several bags with medical supplies to return to the ship. As evening approached, work began to prepare the HLZ for the main evacuation. The area was used as a parking lot and several vehicles were left without keys by staff that had already been evacuated. Some cars had to be broken into to be moved. Chemical lights were placed in the HLZ in a NATO \\"Y\\" pattern. The entire mission would be conducted with night vision goggles, which required all lights in the embassy compound to be turned off. =Main evacuation= USS Kearsarge, a ship similar to Guam The main evacuation occurred in the early morning hours of 6 January and consisted of four waves of five CH-46 helicopters. The timing of this phase was determined by range of the CH-46 Sea Knight, which lack aerial refueling capability; the ships were about away during this phase. An AC-130 was sent from Saudi Arabia to provide gunfire support during the evacuation and two UH-1 Iroquois helicopters were on standby to provide gunfire support, but were not deployed. The first wave departed Guam at 23:43. As the second wave landed, Major Siad arrived at the embassy gate accompanied by two truckloads of soldiers and held a grenade in one hand and a radio in the other. His request to speak with the ambassador was granted. Major Siad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the Somali government had not granted the US permission to carry out such a military operation. He claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued. The second and third waves were able to depart without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the Major, who finally agreed to settle the matter for several thousand dollars in cash and keys to the ambassador's armored car. Ambassador Bishop remained engaged in conversation with the Major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to depart with the final wave to prevent the Major from reneging on the deal. The final wave departed the embassy at 1:49 and landed on Guam at 2:23; twenty minutes later, Ambassador Bishop declared the evacuation complete. =Aftermath at the embassy= Armed looters were observed entering the embassy compound as the final wave departed. The doors of the chancery‚Äîthe main building of the embassy‚Äîwere reportedly blown open by RPGs within two hours of the embassy's evacuation. Somali employees of the embassy‚Äîknown as foreign service nationals (FSNs)‚Äîcould not be evacuated. Ambassador Bishop tried unsuccessfully to have these employees airlifted to safer parts of Somalia. Many of the FSNs had sought refuge in the embassy with their families and about 30 were hired as guards and protected the embassy throughout the ordeal. Local banks had been closed for some time and the embassy was unable to pay the FSNs. The Ambassador left the FSNs with keys to the commissary and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed. =Return to Oman= Letter thanking the crew of the USS Guam for the evacuation, signed by the heads of missions that were evacuated A total of 281 evacuees were taken from the embassy, including 12 heads of missions (eight ambassadors and four charg√©s d'affaires) and 61 Americans (including Ambassador Bishop and 36 embassy staff). A 282d evacuee was added to the total with a 10 January Caesarean delivery of a baby aboard Guam. The heads of mission were the ambassadors of the United States, Kenya, Nigeria, Soviet Union, Sudan, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and United Kingdom and the charg√©s of the embassies of Germany, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar. Rather than disembark in nearby Mombasa, as originally thought by the evacuees, the ships were ordered back to Oman‚Äîa five-day journey. The sailors and marines made way for the evacuees to share living quarters. When the chaplain of Guam asked crew to sign up as guides for the evacuees while aboard the vessel, two hundred signed up within an hour, and some of the sailors even dressed up as clowns to ease the ordeal for children. At the request of the ambassadors, a formal session with the ships' senior officers was held to express their thanks. On 11 January, the evacuees were offloaded at Muscat, Oman. That afternoon, the American evacuees were flown to Frankfurt, Germany, from where they continued home.

It was established in 1866 and is named after King Willem II. The school was founded in the former royal palace in Tilburg, the present City Hall, of which the construction was commissioned by King William II himself. In 1934 the school moved from the former palace to the new location a new and much bigger building at the Ringbaan Oost in Tilburg. In 1971 the school moved to its present location on the Tatraweg. The school is divided over seven buildings of varying size: * The A-building contains the school's four gyms. * The B-building is the school's main building. It has three floors and is one of the oldest buildings. * The C-building has only a few classrooms and is located on the ground floor. * The D-building like the B-building is one of the oldest buildings, but has only two floors. * The E-building (one floor) and F-building (two floors) were not part of the original school and were built later with a more modern decoration. The main subjects taught here are the sciences biology, chemistry, and physics. * The G-building is the smallest of all of the buildings, and has only one big room. The school offers vmbo, havo or vwo (atheneum and gymnasium). The school is unique in offering students two alternative streams: the muzische afdeling (musical department) or a top-sport afdeling (top-sports department) for the first three years of their education, after which they may continue at the vmbo, havo or vwo.  Vincent van Gogh  In 1866, the school welcomed of its most remarkable students and certainly its most famous: Vincent van Gogh. He left the school halfway during his second year, for unknown reasons. His parents still lived in Zundert and Vincent lived in one of the houses at the St. Annaplein in Tilburg, not far from the school. The oldest school photograph in the files of the school, a typical class photograph, is a famous photo of Van Gogh. It is said that his art teacher, Constant Cornelis Huijsmans, has had a strong influence of Gogh's early style.

A variety of mechanisms have been proposed, but the precise cause is unclear. The incidence of a first episode of pouchitis at 1, 5 and 10 years post-operatively is 15%, 33% and 45% respectively. Patients with pouchitis typically present with bloody diarrhea, urgency in passing stools, or discomfort while passing stools. The loss of blood and/or dehydration resulting from the frequent stools will frequently result in nausea. Extreme cramping and pain can occur with pouchitis. Endoscopy in patients with pouchitis usually reveals erythematous pouch mucosa, loss of pseudocolonic vasculature or other architecture, and friability of the mucosa. Biopsies show evidence of inflammatory cells or red blood cells in the lamina propria.  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms of pouchitis include increased stool frequency, urgency, incontinence, nocturnal seepage, abdominal cramping, pelvic discomfort, and arthralgia. Symptom severity does not always correlate with severity of endoscopically- or histologically-evaluated pouch inflammation. Additionally, these symptoms are not necessarily specific for pouchitis, as they may arise from other inflammatory or functional pouch disorders such as Crohn's disease of the pouch, cuffitis, pouch sinus, or irritable pouch syndrome. The most reliable tool for diagnosis is endoscopy combined with histologic features (derived from tissue biopsies obtained during endoscopy). Diagnosis = Classification = Once a diagnosis of pouchitis is made, the condition is further classified. The activity of pouchitis is stratified as: * remission (no active pouchitis). * mild to moderately active (increased stool frequency, urgency, infrequent incontinence). * severely active (hospitalised for dehydration, frequent incontinence). The duration of pouchitis is defined as acute (less than or equal to four weeks) or chronic (four weeks or more) and the pattern classified as infrequent (1‚Äì2 acute episodes), relapsing (three or fewer episodes) or continuous. Finally, the response to medical treatment as labelled as treatment responsive or treatment refractory, with the medication for either case being specified.  Treatment  There is no clinically approved treatment for pouchitis.The FSE Group First line treatment is usually with antibiotics, specifically with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Ampicillin or piperacillin can also be considered as alternatives to empiric ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Administration of metronidazole at a high daily dose of 20 mg/kg can cause symptomatic peripheral neuropathology in up to 85% of patients. This can be a limiting factor in the use of maintenance metronidazole to suppress chronic pouchitis. Other therapies which have been shown to be effective include probiotics, the application of which usually begins as soon as any antibiotic course is completed so as to re-populate the pouch with beneficial bacteria. Biologics, such as anti-TNF antibodies, may also be useful but the evidence for their use is largely anecdotal. In addition, discussion by patients using related internet forums appears to give evidence of benefits (again, after cessation of antibiotics) from certain diets, such as the specific carbohydrate diet, Paleolithic diet, and low- FODMAP diet . In particular, attention has been drawn to the exclusion of complex carbohydrates, as well as other foods with high starch content (such as grains, rice, and potatoes) and certain dairy products including milk and soft cheese.http://j-pouch.org/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/3251071921/m/8147045836http://j-pouch.org/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/3251071921/m/4977059936  Research  A pilot study on the effect of reducing dietary FODMAP intake on bowel function in people without a colon indicates there might be a relation between pouchitis and FODMAP diets. Alicaforsen (an antisense inhibitor which targets the messenger RNA for the production of human ICAM-1 protein) was evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial, which did not meet the co- primary endpoints in the primary analysis (an adaptation of the Mayo Score of improvement in endoscopic remission and bowel frequency).

It formerly extended to Shelburne Falls in Buckland in the west, but as of 2007, the route terminates at Interstate 91 (I-91) in Greenfield. Route description Eastbound at the Garden Theater in Greenfield Route 2A signage on Massachusetts Avenue near MIT Route 2A begins at the rotary intersection with Route 2 at I-91 in Greenfield. It passes through downtown Greenfield before reconnecting to its parent route just west of the Greenfield-Gill town line. After a silent concurrency, Route 2A leaves Route 2 once more, passing through Orange and Athol. In Athol it passes the former northern terminus of Route 21, which was truncated to Belchertown after the creation of the Quabbin Reservoir. From Phillipston through Westminster, Route 2A weaves around its parent route, crossing it a total of six times with five exits of access off of Route 2\\\\. In Fitchburg the road is shared with several other routes as it passes through the northern half of town. Once in Lunenburg it has another short concurrency with Route 13 just north of the former Whalom Park before crossing into Middlesex County at Shirley. In Shirley, Route 2A passes north of Fort Devens into Ayer, heading into Littleton and crossing I-495 at exit 30. It then turns south through Acton and into Concord before rejoining its parent route once more. As a silent concurrency, it passes south of the historic center of town and north of Walden Pond before splitting again. Route 2A then passes through the Minuteman National Historical Park along the Great Road, the route taken by British troops between the Battles of Lexington and Concord. It then leaves the park, intersecting with I-95/Route 128 at exit 30. The road passes south of Lexington's town center before winding into Arlington. In Arlington, the road begins a concurrency with U.S. Route 3 (US 3) which eventually joins the route to Massachusetts Avenue (Mass Ave). After US 3 leaves Mass Ave at Alewife Brook Parkway, Route 2A continues through the city of Cambridge, passing by Harvard Yard and through Harvard Square. Due to the one-way circulation patterns of the square, Route 2A follows Mass Ave in the westbound direction and a combination of Massachusetts Avenue, Brattle Street, and Mt. Auburn Street in the eastbound direction before rejoining Mass Ave east of Putnam Avenue. It then passes by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It intersects the junction of US 3 and Route 3 at Memorial Drive before crossing the Harvard Bridge (also known as the Massachusetts Avenue Bridge) and crossing into Boston, ending at Route 2 and Commonwealth Avenue. =Signage mistakes= In 2013, Route 2A signs were extended further into Boston through the Back Bay and South End neighborhoods along Massachusetts Avenue. This extension connected it with several additional numbered routes including the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90) by its junction with Boylston Street, Huntington Avenue (Route 9), Tremont Street (Route 28), and Melnea Cass Boulevard (which connects with I-93/US 1/Route 3) in Roxbury. Not only did neither the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) nor the Boston Transportation Department, acknowledge that Route 2A had been extended, they denied knowing who put up the signs, indicating it was the action of an unknown organization. The Route 2A signs themselves had either wrong directional banners (signed as a north-south highway at least once north of Melnea Cass Boulevard) or are signed backwards (east going west and vice versa), as it heads in a northwesterly direction towards Commonwealth Avenue beyond Tremont Street. On February 26, Boston television station, WFXT- TV aired an investigative reporting segment showing the incorrect signs and their attempt to track down the source. In the report, Boston transportation officials admitted they had paid a private firm, Jacobs Engineering, to manufacture and put up the signs through a wayfinding improvement grant. The signage errors were caused by problems with the plans developed by Jacobs that apparently were not checked for accuracy before they were approved for installation by the city. The city said they were going to take action against the firm to recoup moneys from Jacobs, and would work to fix the signs as soon as possible. Meanwhile, a MassDOT official reiterated that the eastern terminus of Route 2A is at the intersection of Massachusetts and Commonwealth Avenue and that crews would be removing the MA 2A signs further east. In the city's defense, they stated that they do not typically manufacture, install, or maintain signage pertaining to state entities, similar to an arrangement with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority relating to bus stop signage within the city.

Together with Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky, he was the founder of the Modern Medical School of Vienna. Life ≈†koda was born in Pilsen, Bohemia, as the second son of a locksmith. He attended the gymnasium at Pilsen, entered the University of Vienna in 1825, and received the degree of Doctor of Medicine on 10 July 1831. He first served in Bohemia as physician during the outbreak of cholera, was assistant physician in the General Hospital of Vienna, 1832‚Äì38, in 1839 city physician of Vienna for the poor, and on 13 February 1840, on the recommendation of Dr. Ludwig Freiherr von T√ºrkheim, chairman of the Imperial Committee of Education, was appointed to the unpaid position of chief physician of the department for tuberculosis just opened in the general hospital. In 1846, thanks to the energetic measures of Carl von Rokitansky, professor of pathological anatomy, he was appointed professor of the medical clinic against the wishes of the rest of the medical faculty. In 1848 he began to lecture in German instead of Latin, being the first professor to do so. On 17 July 1848, he was elected an active member of the mathematico-physical section of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In Vienna in 1851 ≈†koda treated Petar II Petrovic Njegos who was suffering from pulmonary consumption, what we call today tuberculosis. Early in 1871, he retired from his professorship; the occasion was celebrated by the students and the population of Vienna by a great torchlight procession in his honour. He died in Vienna. Rokitansky called him \\"a light for those who study, a model for those who strive, and a rock for those who despair\\". ≈†koda's benevolent disposition is best shown by the fact that, notwithstanding his large income and the known simplicity of his lifestyle, he left a comparatively small fortune, and in his will, bequeathed legacies to a number of benevolent institutions. Joseph ≈†koda was an uncle to the industrialist Emil ≈†koda.Ref the German wiki Works Title of first print 1839 ≈†koda's great merit lies in his development of the methods of physical investigation for diagnosis in medicine. The discovery of the method of percussion diagnosis made in 1761 by the Viennese physician, Leopold Auenbrugger (1722‚Äì1809), had been forgotten, and the knowledge of it was first revived in 1808 by the Frenchman Jean- Nicolas Corvisart (1755‚Äì1821), court physician to Napoleon I. Ren√© Laennec (1787‚Äì1826) and his pupils Pierre Adolphe Piorry (1794‚Äì1879) and Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud (1796‚Äì1881) added auscultation to this method. ≈†koda began his clinical studies in close connexion with pathological anatomy while assistant physician of the hospital, but his superiors failed to understand his course, and in 1837, by way of punishment, transferred him to the ward for the insane, as it was claimed that the patients were annoyed by his investigations, especially by the method of percussion. His first publication, \\"√úber die Perkussion\\" (About Percussion) in the \\"Medizinische Jahrb√ºcher des k.k. √∂sterreichen Kaiserstaates\\", IX (1836), attracted little attention. This paper was followed by: \\"√úber den Herzstoss und die durch die Herzbewegungen verursachten T√∂ne und √ºber die Anwendung der Perkussion bei Untersuchung der Organe des Unterleibes\\" (About the Percussion of the Heart and the Sounds Originated by Heart Movements, and Its Application to the Investigation of Organs of the Abdomen), in the same periodical, vols XIII, XIV (1837); \\"√úber Abdominaltyphus und dessen Behandlung mit Alumen crudum\\" (About Abdominal Typhus and Its Treatment with Alumen), also in the same periodical, vol. XV (1838); \\"Untersuchungsmethode zur Bestimmung des Zustandes des Herzens\\" (Methods of Investigation of the Conditions of the Heart), vol. XVIII (1839); \\"√úber Pericarditis in pathologisch-anatomischer und diagnostischer Beziehung\\" (About Pericarditis in Pathological Anatomic and Diagnostic Relationships), XIX (1839); \\"√úber Piorrys Semiotik und Diagnostik\\" (About Piorry's Semiotic and Diagnostics), vol. XVIII (1839); \\"√úber die Diagnose der Herzklappenfehler\\" (About the Diagnosis of Defects of Heart Valves), vol. XXI (1840). His small, but for many years afterwards, unsurpassed chief work, \\"Abhandlung √ºber die Perkussion und Auskultation\\" (Vienna, 1839), was repeatedly published and translated into foreign languages and established his universal renown as a diagnostician. In 1841, after a journey for research to Paris, he made a separate division in his department for skin diseases and thus gave the first impulse towards the reorganization of dermatology by Ferdinand von Hebra. In 1848 at the request of the Ministry of Education he drew up a memorial on the reorganization of medical education, and encouraged later by his advice the founding of the present higher administration of the Medical School of Vienna. As regards therapeutics the accusation was often made against him that he held to the \\"nihilism\\" of the Vienna School. As a matter of fact his therapeutics were exceedingly simple in contrast to the great variety of remedial agents used at that time, which he regarded as useless, as in his experience many ailments were cured without medicines, merely by suitable medical supervision and proper diet. His high sense of duty as a teacher, the large amount of work he performed as a physician, and the early appearance of heart disease are probably the reasons that from 1848 he published less and less. The few papers which he wrote from 1850 are to be found in the transactions of the Academy of Sciences and the periodical of the Society of Physicians of Vienna of which he was the honorary president.

Biography He was born in Los Angeles to a prosperous southern California orange grove owner in 1887. Although raised by devout Methodists, he displayed little interest in religious matters as a youth. Fuller graduated from Pomona College in 1910 as a chemist and worked in his father's citrus-packing business in southern California until 1918. Fuller married his high school sweetheart, Grace Payton, in 1910.Robert H. Kraphol and Charles H. Lippy (1999) The Evangelicals A Historical, Thematic, and Biographical Guide, Greenwood press. p=241 Fuller was converted under the preaching of Paul Rader (evangelist), pastor of Chicago's Moody Church in 1916. Ministry After his conversion in 1916, Fuller began to teach the adult Sunday school class at Placentia Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles, and later entered the Bible Institute of Los Angeles (now, Biola University), eventually becoming chairman of the board. Kraphol and Lippy (1999) states, \\"Under the tutelage of Biola's dean, Reuben A. Torrey, Fuller developed a religious perspective that was strongly weighted toward fundamentalist and dispensationalism. Fuller then dabbled in volunteer religious work in the Los Angeles area for several years until his fundamentalist views forced him and many of his Sunday school class to split from Placentia Presbyterian in 1925.\\" Initially a Presbyterian, he became a Baptist minister in 1925. After his ordination as a Baptist minister, he pastored a group that named itself Calvary Church. Fuller held revival meetings down the West Coast of the United States, and soon began using radio as a method to get his message out. By 1930, he was regularly broadcasting Calvary's Sunday school services as well as Bible study programs in the local area. Eventually, the time he spent on the radio broadcast conflicted with the time he spent pastoring his church, so he resigned his pastorship in 1933 and formed the nonprofit Gospel Broadcasting Association to support his radio evangelistic efforts. He gained renown as the radio host and speaker of The Old Fashioned Revival Hour, a weekly Sunday broadcast that aired from 1937 to 1968. The first nationwide broadcast occurred on October 3, 1937, on the Mutual Broadcasting System. Beginning in 1951, the program was carried on the ABC Radio Network, heard on more than 650 radio stations. The Old Fashioned Revival Hour broadcast was originally recorded in a Hollywood studio. In 1941, it was moved to the Long Beach Municipal Auditorium in Long Beach, California. From 1941 through 1958, audiences attended services that were broadcast live on the radio from the Auditorium. After January 12, 1958, the program was again produced in a studio. The broadcasts were noted for the music, featuring the Old Fashioned Revival Hour Choir and quartet, accompanied by organist George Broadbent and pianist Rudy Atwood. The choir made several popular recordings in the 1940s and 1950s. Aided by his wife, Grace, the Old Fashion Revival Hour program created a family-like atmosphere, and by 1942 it had attracted an audience of over 10 million listeners worldwide. Fuller founded Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, in 1947. His son, Daniel Fuller, served the seminary as Dean and professor of hermeneutics. In 2005 Daniel Fuller was honored at an awards convocation for 50 years of service to the seminary. Charles Fuller died in 1968, shortly after his final broadcast of the Old Fashioned Revival Hour. He is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. The Long Beach Municipal Auditorium was demolished in the 1960s, but a plaque marks the site of Fuller's broadcasts. Co-authors Kraphol and Lippy write the following about his legacy: \\"When Fuller died in 1968, his important role as a major figure in the development of post-World War II neoevangelicalism was not fully appreciated. Yet, his organizational skill, his masterful use of the radio medium, his vision for Christian higher education, and his willingness to moderate the more divisive aspects of his own fundamentalism background made him a significant force in the development of modern American evangelical ethos.\\" The book Pagan Christianity by George Barna and Frank Viola notes Fuller's popularization of the use of the terminology \\"personal savior\\" when speaking of Jesus. re-broadcasts of the Old Fashioned Revival Hour stream weekly on the Internet.

Similar to cross country skiing, splitboarding allows free heel movement and with skins attached to the bottom of the ski‚Äôs, provides uphill traction. The two halves can then be connected to form a regular snowboard for descent.snowevolution.com, Construction of a \\"splitboard\\" Splitboarding culture often focuses on the idea of using your own power to access the backcountry usually on unmaintained trails. When snowboarding originated in 1965, it was prohibited in resorts across America until the 1984-85 snowboard season. By the early 1990s, majority of resorts across the US opened their doors to snowboarders and in less than five years later splitboarding emerged. The development of splitboarding simplified backcountry snowboarding, making pristine powder beyond the lift lines accessible to winter recreation enthusiasts. In april 1990, an article of a patent of a split board made by Nicol√≤ Manaresi from Bologna was published in an Italian magazine SKATESNOWBOARD, a photo of a Sims board split in two appears (source Erik Pernisco). SkateSnowBoard magazine,(gruppo B editore, Italia), april 1990, page 48. In 1991, Brett \\"Kowboy\\" Kobernik brought a crude prototype of the first splitboard to Mark \\"Wally\\" Wariakois, the founder of Voile. At the time Wally was intensely focused on innovating new backcountry ski and telemark binding designs, but he saw the future of backcountry snowboarding in Kowboy's crude design. Over the next few years, Kowboy and Wally refined this idea and in 1994 released the first DIY Voile Split Kit. This was the beginning of the splitboard revolution. For the first time riders had a truly innovative and easier way to access backcountry powder.http://splitboard.com/category/voile/ Surveys from SIA showed an increase in the number of skiers and snowboarders using non-resort backcountry terrain from 1.8 million to 2.2 million in a four year time period. That number significally increased as well from 4.3 million to 6.3 million when resort backcountry terrain was included. The popularity of splitboarding in the last decade has prompted many outfitters to offer half day, full day or even muti-day excursions across the globe. In the last decade there has been an emergence of splitboarding companies. Such as Karakoram splitboard bindings, Spark R and D bindings, Jones Snowboards. These three companies have revolutionized the sport and created an affordable splitboarding market which has helped increase participation in the sport. Before 2006, Voile was the leading splitboarding company which sold the early track system binding that was a precursor to the modern style split specific binding and puck systems. Since 2006 much lighter weight metals and plastics have been introduced into the binding systems creating a more responsive and durable split board binding. Also, there are a wide variety of splitboard's to choose from on the market then previous years. Companies like Jones Snowboards have developed splitboard lines into their brand which are high performing and relatively affordable. Splitboards can come in hybrid camber styles, full camber styles, volume shifted shapes, powder shapes, and also are designed for women and children.

Early life Greene was born in Yonkers, New York. When finishing high school, he was recruited by Rich Bisaccia, the new running backs and special teams coach at Clemson University in South Carolina. Bissacia was also from Yonkers and Greene knew him through his family.\\"Rivalry Week: Q&A; with former Clemson QB Nealon Greene\\", by Tyreese Ingram, Rubbing the Rock, November 28, 2015. Pro career After spending his collegiate career with Clemson, where he became the school's career leader in passing yardage, Greene came to the Canadian Football League with the Toronto Argonauts. Greene was traded in 1999 to the Edmonton Eskimos before he could establish himself on the Argonauts, but played well enough to stay with the team for a few seasons. On July 16, 1999, Greene set a CFL record for rushing yards in a single game by a quarterback with 180 yards. He became the clear Eskimos starter in 2000 while posting a 10-8 record and second-place finish. The Eskimos narrowly lost the west semi final to the BC Lions by a score of 34-32 after a seemingly easy but missed field goal by kicker Sean Fleming which would have sealed the win. The loss resulted in the firing of head coach Don Matthews which led to Greene losing the starting quarterback role to Jason Maas during the 2001 season. Greene was subsequently traded to the Saskatchewan Roughriders with Simon Baffoe and a second round pick (offensive lineman Francois Boulianne) in the 2002 CFL Draft for offensive lineman Dan Comiskey, running back Darren Davis, and kicker Mike O'Brien. Greene immediately became the starter in Saskatchewan starting the 2002 season improving the then woeful Roughriders to an 8-10 record, making the playoffs for the first time since their 1997 Grey Cup appearance. In 2003 Greene played sixteen games for the Roughriders, posting a 10-6 record as a starter, leading Saskatchewan to their first winning season since 1994. They defeated the Winnipeg Blue Bombers 37-21 in the first round of the postseason before losing to the Edmonton Eskimos in the western final by a score of 30-23. The successful season of 2003 and further advancements having been made in the playoffs left the Roughriders fans looking positive. However, in the first game of the 2004 season against the Toronto Argonauts, Greene suffered a season-ending broken leg which resulted in a disappointing 9-9 season for Saskatchewan under back-up quarterback Henry Burris. Greene recovered and returned in the 2005 season, where he retained the role of starter after the departure of Burris. The up-and-down season struggles saw the team start strongly with a 3-1 record, but fall to a disappointing 3-6 by the halfway point of the season. Seeing that change was necessary, Greene was benched and lost the starting role to back-up Marcus Crandell. Crandell quarterbacked the Riders to five straight victories during Greene's time on the bench, but later lost three crucial games in a row near the end of the season dropping the Roughriders to below .500 once again with an 8-9 record. Having nothing to lose, head coach Danny Barrett then returned to Greene to start in the last regular season game in BC. Greene led the Riders to victory in his final CFL start, salvaging another disappointing 9-9 season for the green and white. Although the season resulted in a last place finish in the west, Greene and the Roughriders had a stronger record than the third-place team in the east, the Ottawa Renegades, entitling the Roughriders to cross over divisions and make the eastern playoffs. However, despite the victory against the league- leading BC Lions the previous week under Greene, he was benched again in favor of Crandell and never saw any playing time in the ensuing 30-14 loss to the Montreal Alouettes in the east semi final. On April 20, 2006 Greene was traded by Saskatchewan to the Montreal Alouettes where he reunited with head coach Don Matthews and served as a back-up quarterback to Anthony Calvillo. Despite Calvillo's struggles and poor play later in the season, he remained the starter and Greene was never given a chance to start a game for Montreal. Greene was cut the following season after Matthews resigned as head coach. Greene retired from pro football, he returned to Clemson University and continued his education.

It is adapted from Arthur Kopit's book from his unproduced stage musical Phantom, which is based loosely on Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel. Plot The Phantom of the Opera is a disfigured musician named Erik who lives below the Op√©ra Garnier in Paris. He has a large part in managing each performance until his friend, Gerard Carriere is dismissed. The new manager, Choleti refuses to listen to warnings about the \\"ghost\\" who haunts the opera house, even when the wardrobe man goes into the depths of the opera house and is killed. Christine Daa√© comes to the Paris Opera House to receive voice lessons, however she is dismissed by Choleti's wife, Carlotta to working in the costume department. The doorman lets Christine stay in a storage room in the Opera House. Upon hearing her sing, the Phantom is entranced by her voice. He offers to be her teacher, but must remain anonymous; that is why he wears a mask. They begin lessons, and the Phantom falls deeper in love with her. Erik begins a campaign of humiliation against Carlotta, sabotaging her performances. With Erik's encouragement, Christine earns a singing contract. The Comte de Chagny realizes Christine was his childhood sweetheart. Erik witnesses them together and stays up all night in the rehearsal room. Finding out Christine has been living in the Opera, Carlotta blackmails Christine into telling her about her vocal coach. When Carlotta informs her husband that Christine's teacher is the Phantom, Choleti gives Christine the female lead of the opera Faust; he is working with the police to capture the Phantom. Carlotta gives Christine a drink that weakens her voice during the performance. The audience boos and Erik is enraged. He cuts through the ropes holding the chandelier and drops it on the audience, then abducts Christine to his underground lair. The Phantom discovers Carlotta was behind Christine's voice problems and dumps rats on her, driving her insane. Carriere pleads with him to let Christine go, but Erik refuses. He insists that the world above is not fit for her and believes that in time she will love him. Carriere goes to Christine and urges her to get out. He tells her the story of Erik's past and of Erik's mother, a great singer named Belladova to whom she bears a resemblance. Belladova gave birth to him below the opera house, and Erik has lived there his entire life. Christine refuses to leave without talking to Erik. She asks Erik to show her his face promising him that she would be able to look at him with love and acceptance, as his mother once did. When he does unmask, she faints. In the midst of an anguished breakdown, Erik locks her in one of his chambers. Christine escapes, and Carriere and the Count take her from the Opera House. Christine is stricken with guilt and begs Phillipe to take her back. The Comte agrees and he and Christine approach Choleti about singing that night. Choleti secretly arranges to have police planted throughout the opera house. Carriere tells Erik that Christine did not mean to hurt him. The older man reveals that he has seen Erik's face, because he is his father. Erik says he knew, as they have the same eyes (the only thing of his face he can bear to look at). Christine sings at that night's performance of Faust. Erik hears her and forces himself up to Box Five. He begins singing with her. Christine and the Phantom sing to each other with such passion that the audience is awed and gives them a standing ovation. The police shoot at Erik and he grabs a hold of Christine carrying her off to the roof. The Comte pursues them, but in the ensuing struggle is knocked off the roof, dangling above the street. At Christine's pleading, Erik pulls him to safety. Erik is cornered by police determined to take him alive. Carriere has retrieved a gun and upholding a promise, Carriere shoots him. Erik falls from the roof and Christine runs to him. While cradled in his father's lap, Christine removes Erik's mask, looks him straight in the face and smiles. Erik dies with his father and Christine at his side. Christine replaces Erik's mask and is led away by the Comte.  Cast  * Charles Dance as Erik/The Phantom of The Opera * Teri Polo as Christine Daa√©/Belladova * Adam Storke as Comte Philippe de Chagny * Burt Lancaster as Gerard Carriere * Ian Richardson as Choleti * Andr√©a Ferr√©ol as Carlotta * Jean-Pierre Cassel as Inspector Ledoux * Jean Rougerie as Jean Claude * Andr√© Chaumeau as Joseph Buquet  Production  Arthur Kopit had long been an admirer of Gaston Leroux's story, but felt that the horror premise had left out the possibility of a more compelling relationship between the two main characters. So he came up with a script in which the Phantom is a romantic hero, frightening only to those who would misuse the opera house wherein he dwells - and to those who would stand in the way of Christine's eventual rise to stardom. And he decided to use plenty of music in his storytelling - not original music, but classical opera arias that would imbue his production with a sense of the Phantom's heart, soul and passion. Then Andrew Lloyd Webber came along, and Kopit was devastated: \\"Here was work that I deeply loved, and it looked for all that world like it would never be seen.\\" He later heard that the network was in the market for a miniseries, so he sent them a copy of his script. \\"I had to convince them that I wasn't following on the heels of Lloyd Webber's success,\\" he said. \\"But once I was able to do that, it wasn't difficult to help them see the potential of this interesting, unusual love story.\\"  Reception  The miniseries won two Emmy Awards out of five nominations in 1990 for Outstanding Art Direction and Outstanding Achievement in Hairstyling for a Miniseries or a Special.The Phantom of the Opera NBC Emmys.com It was also nominated for two Golden Globe Awards in 1991 for Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television and Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television (Burt Lancaster).Awards Search: Phantom of the Opera, The . goldenglobes.org Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker gave the film a score of A- and said Kopit and director Tony Richardson \\"make the romance between the Phantom and Christine both touching and frightening, and the casting of Burt Lancaster as Carriere, the manager of the opera company, gives the story weight and great charm...The Phantom of the Opera has a few old-fashioned but genuinely scary moments...It's as if Richardson went back to look at old horror movies by such filmmakers as Val Lewton and James Whale to figure out how they got their spooky but never gruesome effects\\". Although he found Adam Storke's Count de Chagny bland, he declared that: \\"...all in all, The Phantom of the Opera is a real achievement: It's rare enough for a costume drama to show up on TV these days; the fact that this is a good one is amazing.\\" People critic David Hiltbrand gave the film a score of B+ and said \\"Director Tony Richardson has mounted a sumptuous, stately version of this oft-told epic melodrama, far surpassing the previous TV version with Maximilian Schell and Jane Seymour in 1983. But Lon Chaney must be spinning in his grave, seeing what a rakish romantic his ghoulish Phantom has become over the years.\\" Hiltbrand praised that Burt Lancaster \\"lends his usual air of refined dignity, and Charles Dance makes an elegant Phantom. But the real zest is provided by Ian Richardson and Andrea Ferreol, who bring great comic verve to the roles of the pompous popinjay of an opera director and his deluded diva of a wife.\\" The Deseret News critic Joseph Walker said, \\"Kopit's script maintains his vision throughout, expertly mixing moods ranging from the ridiculous (\\"I'm not used to killing people,\\" says the Phantom after a rare violent episode. \\"It throws me off.\\") to the sublime. And the production values throughout are first rate...\\" Walker also added that Charles Dance is a \\"superb Phantom ‚Äì brooding and mysterious, and yet somehow approachable. Polo makes the most of her big TV break, creating a flesh and blood heroine who is utterly believable...The rest of the cast is similarly effective, especially Ferreol who practically steals the show with her broad comic Carlotta.TV Guide gave the film four out of five stars and said Charles Dance is an \\"excellent Phantom\\" and \\"excellent support from Richardson and Lancaster.\\" The New York Times critic John J. O'Connor was puzzled how the recluse Phantom became \\"cultivated and talented\\" and criticized Adam Storke's performance and the \\"international menu of accents.\\" However, he stated \\"the physical production is gloriously lavish...And the director Tony Richardson deftly captures the fairy-tale aspects of the story,\\" describing the film as a \\"variation on Beauty and the Beast, with echoes of Cinderella and enchanted forests.\\" He also stated that \\"most of the performances transcend the accent difficulties. Mr. Dance is elegant, Mr. Lancaster dignified and Miss Polo, not yet 20 years old, strikingly beautiful. The show is just about stolen, however, by Ian Richardson and Andrea Ferreo...,\\" and concluded \\"Phantom adds up to an odd but fascinating prime-time diversion.\\"  See also  * Phantom (musical)  References   External links  * 1990 television films 1990 films Films based on The Phantom of the Opera Films directed by Tony Richardson Saban Entertainment films ","title":"The Phantom of the Opera (miniseries)"},{"id":"2957025","text":"Axonal transport, also called axoplasmic transport or axoplasmic flow, is a cellular process responsible for movement of mitochondria, lipids, synaptic vesicles, proteins, and other organelles to and from a neuron's cell body, through the cytoplasm of its axon called the axoplasm. Since some axons are on the order of meters long, neurons cannot rely on diffusion to carry products of the nucleus and organelles to the end of their axons. Axonal transport is also responsible for moving molecules destined for degradation from the axon back to the cell body, where they are broken down by lysosomes. Dynein, a motor protein responsible for retrograde axonal transport, carries vesicles and other cellular products toward the cell bodies of neurons. Its light chains bind the cargo, and its globular head regions bind the microtubule, \\"inching\\" along it. Movement toward the cell body is called retrograde transport and movement toward the synapse is called anterograde transport. Mechanism Kinesin walking on a microtubule. It is a molecular biological machine that uses protein domain dynamics on nanoscalesThe vast majority of axonal proteins are synthesized in the neuronal cell body and transported along axons. Some mRNA translation has been demonstrated within axons.Si K, Giustetto Axonal transport occurs throughout the life of a neuron and is essential to its growth and survival. Microtubules (made of tubulin) run along the length of the axon and provide the main cytoskeletal \\"tracks\\" for transportation. Kinesin and dynein are motor proteins that move cargoes in the anterograde (forwards from the soma to the axon tip) and retrograde (backwards to the soma (cell body)) directions, respectively. Motor proteins bind and transport several different cargoes including mitochondria, cytoskeletal polymers, autophagosomes, and synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters. Axonal transport can be fast or slow, and anterograde (away from the cell body) or retrograde (conveys materials from axon to cell body). Fast and slow transport Vesicular cargoes move relatively fast (50‚Äì400 mm/day) whereas transport of soluble (cytosolic) and cytoskeletal proteins takes much longer (moving at less than 8 mm/day). The basic mechanism of fast axonal transport has been understood for decades but the mechanism of slow axonal transport is only recently becoming clear, as a result of advanced imaging techniques. Fluorescent labeling techniques (e.g. fluorescence microscopy) have enabled direct visualization of transport in living neurons. (See also: Anterograde tracing.) Recent studies have revealed that the movement of cytoskeletal \\"slow\\" cargoes is actually rapid but unlike fast cargoes, they pause frequently, making the overall transit rate much slower. The mechanism is known as the \\"Stop and Go\\" model of slow axonal transport, and has been extensively validated for the transport of the cytoskeletal protein neurofilament. The movement of soluble (cytosolic) cargoes is more complex, but appears to have a similar basis where soluble proteins organize into multi-protein complexes that are then conveyed by transient interactions with more rapidly moving cargoes moving in fast axonal transport. An analogy is the difference in transport rates between local and express subway trains. Though both types of train travel at similar velocities between stations, the local train takes much longer to reach the end of the line because it stops at every station whereas the express makes only a few stops on the way. Anterograde transport Anterograde (also called \\"orthograde\\") transport is movement of molecules/organelles outward, from the cell body (also called soma) to the synapse or cell membrane. The anterograde movement of individual cargoes (in transport vesicles) of both fast and slow components along the microtubule is mediated by kinesins. Several kinesins have been implicated in slow transport, though the mechanism for generating the \\"pauses\\" in the transit of slow component cargoes is still unknown. There are two classes of slow anterograde transport: slow component a (SCa) that carries mainly microtubules and neurofilaments at 0.1-1 millimeters per day, and slow component b (SCb) that carries over 200 diverse proteins and actin at a rate of up to 6 millimeters per day. The slow component b, which also carries actin, are transported at a rate of 2-3 millimeters per day in retinal cell axons. During reactivation from latency, the herpes simplex virus (HSV) enters its lytic cycle, and uses anterograde transport mechanisms to migrate from dorsal root ganglia neurons to the skin or mucosa that it subsequently affects. A cargo-receptor for anterograde transport motors, the kinesins, has been identified as the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the parent protein that produces the senile plaques found in Alzheimer's disease. A 15-amino acid peptide in the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of APP binds with high affinity to conventional kinesin-1 and mediates transport of exogenous cargo in the giant axon of the squid. Manganese, a contrast agent for T1-weighted MRI, travels by anterograde transport after stereotaxic injection into the brain of experimental animals and thereby reveals circuitry by whole brain MR imaging in living animals, as pioneered by Robia Pautler, Elaine Bearer and Russ Jacobs. Studies in kinesin- light chain-1 knocked out mice revealed that Mn2+ travels by kinesin-based transport in the optic nerve and in the brain. Transport in both hippocampal projections and in the optic nerve also depends on APP. Transport from hippocampus to forebrain is decreased in aging and destination is altered by the presence of Alzheimer's disease plaques. Retrograde transport Retrograde transport shuttles molecules/organelles away from axon termini toward the cell body. Retrograde axonal transport is mediated by cytoplasmic dynein, and is used for example to send chemical messages and endocytosis products headed to endolysosomes from the axon back to the cell. Operating at average in vivo speeds of approximately 2 Œºm/sec, fast retrograde transport can cover 10-20 centimeters per day. Fast retrograde transport returns used synaptic vesicles and other materials to the soma and informs the soma of conditions at the axon terminals. Retrograde transport carries survival signals from the synapse back to the cell body, such as the TRK, the nerve growth factor receptor. Some pathogens exploit this process to invade the nervous system. They enter the distal tips on an axon and travel to the soma by retrograde transport. Examples include tetanus toxin and the herpes simplex, rabies, and polio viruses. In such infections, the delay between infection and the onset of symptoms corresponds to the time needed for the pathogens to reach the somata.Saladin, Kenneth. Anatomy and Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function. Sixth. New York : McGraw-Hill, 2010. 445. Print. Herpes simplex virus travels both ways in axons depending on its life cycle, with retrograde transport dominating polarity for incoming capsids. Consequences of interruption Whenever axonal transport is inhibited or interrupted, normal physiology becomes pathophysiology, and an accumulation of axoplasm, called an axonal spheroid, may result. Because axonal transport can be disrupted in a multitude of ways, axonal spheroids can be seen in many different classes of diseases, including genetic, traumatic, ischemic, infectious, toxic, degenerative and specific white matter diseases called leukoencephalopathies. Several rare neurodegenerative diseases are linked to genetic mutations in the motor proteins, kinesin and dynein, and in those cases it is likely that axonal transport is a key player in mediating pathology. Dysfunctional axonal transport is also linked to sporadic (common) forms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. This is mainly due to numerous observations that large axonal accumulations are invariably seen in affected neurons, and that genes known to play a role in the familial forms of these diseases also have purported roles in normal axonal transport. However, there is little direct evidence for involvement of axonal transport in the latter diseases, and other mechanisms (such as direct synaptotoxicity) may be more relevant. Arrest of axoplasmic flow at the edge of ischemic area in vascular retinopathies lead to swelling of nerve fibres which give rise to soft exudates or cotton-wool patches. Since the axon depends on axoplasmic transport for vital proteins and materials, injury such as diffuse axonal injury that interrupts the transport will cause the distal axon to degenerate in a process called Wallerian degeneration. Cancer drugs that interfere with cancerous growth by altering microtubules (which are necessary for cell division) damage nerves because the microtubules are necessary for axonal transport. Infection The rabies virus reaches the central nervous system by retrograde axoplasmic flow. The tetanus neurotoxin is internalised at the neuromuscular junction through binding the nidogen proteins and is retrogradely transported towards the soma in signaling endosomes. Neurotropic viruses, such the herpesviruses, travel inside axons using cellular transport machinery, as has been shown in work by Elaine Bearer's group. Other infectious agents are also suspected of using axonal transport. Such infections are now thought to contribute to Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative neurological disorders.

The series is noted for sexual drawings of girls, surreal offbeat humor and tightly-written scripts. The series was created by writer/illustrator Trudy Cooper and co-writer Danny Murphy. Doug Bayne inked and contributed to the script up until episode 12. History Jeremy and Nils, the main characters of Platinum Grit, first appeared in a story called \\"Friendly Rivalry\\" in volume 1, Number 7 of Australia's Issue One Magazine in Winter 1993. The Platinum Grit comic book was published from early 1994 through issue 10 (1998) by Dead Numbat Productions. The creators of Platinum Grit were recipients of the 2005 Ledger Awards for Writer of the Year, Artist of the Year, and Webcomic of the Year. In 2006 Cooper won the Ledger for Writer of the Year. Platinum Grit has attracted critical acclaim from within the Australian comic industry. In 2009, Image Comics imprint ShadowLine will commence reprints of the Platinum Grit graphic novels.Shadowline feat. Grit - in print! Shadowline feat. Grit - in print!, Trudi Cooper 14 January. 2009 The comic has been on hiatus since 2010, with plans to return it to a new site and different format. Trudy Cooper's livejournal announcement Creators Trudy Cooper is a writer/illustrator who has been drawing the main characters in various forms since she was a young girl. She also contributed storyboards to the film Dark City, and co-authored the webcomic Oglaf. Danny Murphy is an actor, writer and singer on the Australian stage circuit. Influences Cooper's influences include Phil Foglio, Edvard Munch, Alan Moore, H. P. Lovecraft and French/euro comics, including works by R√©gis Loisel. She draws much of her inspiration from music, including the work of Kate Bush and Nina Hagen. The surreal quality of the series owes much to The Goodies, a popular British comedy from the 1970s. Characters ; Jeremy Lachlan MacConnor : A gifted physicist who has trouble talking to girls. Scottish. Owner of Castle MacConnor. Wears a French Foreign Legion Kepi. Raised by his Uncle Angus and Aunt Lotte. ; Nilson Maria Theresa \\"Nils\\" Kerr : Jeremy's constant companion, who teases him mercilessly, and also sometimes endangers his life. ; Kate Provoczki : Nils' level-headed friend. Short black hair, built like a rake, became a journalist because she likes collecting gossip on people. Chain smokes. ; Andr√© Provoczki : Kate's brother. Fond of his sister. Homosexual. ; Angus James : Jeremy's uncle, also a scientist. He and Jeremy were kindred spirits. The character is visually based on Donald Sutherland's portrayal of Wilhelm Reich from the Cloudbusting video by Kate Bush. ; Lotte MacConnor : Jeremy's aunt and grand matriarch of the family. Speaks in an accent so thick that it is at times difficult to read (which as some will tell you is how they talk in the Highlands). At times she seems to be no more than your typical senile old relative, yet she seems to retain a better grip on reality that most give her credit, even though it borders on the sinister at times. Cooper says that her bizarre dialogue is an attempt at a phonetic transcription of the Highland Scots accent. ; Dougal MacWikkening : Jeremy's homicidal and immortal cousin. The character of Dougal, particularly his immortality, is influenced by the 1986 action/fantasy film Highlander. (His name, is a pun on Duncan, the protagonist of the Highlander television series and also the term \\"Quickening\\" which refers to the moment an Immortal slays another Immortal and gains his powers.) ; Ziegfreid : Owner of the Platinum Grit Caf√©, once described by Jeremy as \\"...more German than anyone has a right to be.\\" Expert in coffee, weapons and relocating large buildings. ; Raoul : A sentient, talking cabinet with a strong Jamaican accent. Never actually seen to be mobile in any way, but appears in numerous locations without explanation of how he got there, and was once heard (but not seen) talking on a telephone. Reportedly served in the merchant marine. ; Terrence Morley : Agent and possible executor of the MacConnor Family Estate. Bitterly dislikes Angus and Jeremy. For a time operated the family's private sanitorium under the supervision of Lottie. ; Doctor John Cottington : MacConnor Family Physician. Due to his position, he is very knowledgeable of the more mystical part of the family history. Despite a detached and pompous manner, he takes his role as a doctor very seriously and readily comes to the aid of Jeremy. Issues =Episode \\"Zero\\": Friendly Rivalry= Although officially declared non-canon by Trudy Cooper, this story features Jeremy, Nils, and Zeigfreid, more or less as they appear in the official Platinum Grit storyline (although Jeremy exhibits a notably different personality and relationship with Nils). The story concerns their inter- dimensional tourist service, D-Tours, and their efforts to eliminate their rivals, Dunsinane Day-Trippers. Hyperspace travel is carried out in a vehicle called \\"the Skip,\\" which resembles a small RV with jet engines mounted to it. Early official issues of Platinum Grit make allusions to events and themes from this story, notably using the Skip for transportation several times (all off-panel), but no explicit references to any events in this story are ever made. However, in episode six, while Jeremy is telling Kate about Nils, he alludes to a former tour company which he and Nils used to run. =Episode One: Chapter Headings For Old Novels, Pt. I (1994) = On a dare, Aquarius decides to kill all those born under his sign, which includes both Jeremy and his Aunt Lottie. Anticipating her death, Lottie MacConnor summons her nephews Jeremy and Dougal to the castle to set the inheritance in order. Only after Jeremy (with Nilson in tow) arrives does he learn that sole ownership of the family fortune will pass to the winner of a duel to the death at dawn. Nilson, seeing that she could move in if Jeremy inherits, urges him to stay and fight, even helping him train for the duel, with groceries! Yet by the end of the day, Jeremy is not much closer to being ready for the coming sword fight. Before he goes to sleep, and while he tries to write a parting letter to her, Nilson comes in and consoles him, assuring Jeremy that he will be able to defy fate. =Episode Two: Chapter Headings For Old Novels, Pt. II (1994) = While awaiting a suicidal morning duel with his cousin Dougal, Jeremy is visited in the night by the succubus that visited him in his dreams when he was a young boy. She informs Jeremy that she has come to help prevent the death of the Aquarians the next day and the two embark on a surreal journey into the heavens. Meanwhile, Nilson is trying to come up with a way to keep Jeremy from being killed by Dougal in the fight, by any means necessary (there weren't a great many rules laid down). Before long, Jeremy has the Zodiac in chaos, preventing them from performing their appointed duties the next day. Now instead of all born under the sign of Aquarius dying, only Jeremy will die in the duel. As the appointed hour approaches, Jeremy and Nilson hit upon a plan to rig the hall where the fight will take place with a number of large, heavy objects suspended from the roof. Only after being run through with a broadsword does Jeremy's plan work and Nilson releases a grand piano on Dougal's head. Despite this, it is apparent that Jeremy will survive and Nilson will move in. =Episode Three: A Week In No Particular Order (1994) = In the wake of his victorious duel with Dougal, Jeremy and Nilson move into Castle MacConnor. Despite being run through with a broadsword, Jer insists on only using gaff-tape for his wounds. Nils sets a pumpkin atop Dougal's headless body (gaff-tape again) and places him at a bus stop, arousing the suspicions of a private investigator named Richard \\"Jack\\" Leaderboard. Jack proceeds to snoop about the castle as Nils and Jer move in, but narrates in a hokey, over-the-top style as he recounts the events at his typewriter. Nilson wears out Jeremy by forcing him to move furniture around which lays him up in bed under doctor's orders to have \\"no excitement\\". Nilson disregards these orders and dresses up as a naughty nurse. Jack meanwhile is fantasizing about Nils as some femme fatale from Dick Tracy as he tries to solve Dougal's \\"murder\\". Intercut are Jeremy's memories of Uncle Angus as a lifelong bachelor scientist. The story climaxes as Nilson attempts to give Jeremy a sponge bath resulting in him passing out as his wounds reopen somewhat. Jack, thinking that some sort of evil spirits are behind Dougal's death and now an attempt on Jeremy, rushes to Jer's rescue and performs a voodoo ritual that leaves Jeremy covered in blackened pig fat. Of course Jer simply wakes up on his own as Nilson prepares the place for a housewarming party. . . =Episode Four: The Howling Void Sings Val Doonican, Pt. I (1995) = Jeremy and Nilson get liquored up waiting for their friends to come to a castlewarming party. Unbeknownst to them, some group of interplanetary space aliens have lifted Castle MacConnor into outer space, intent on arranging some sort of bizarre dinner-date between Jer and Nils. The aliens are puzzled at the even more bizarre relationship Nils and Jer have, in all its surreal humor, prompting the chief of them to take matters into his own hands. =Episode Five: The Howling Void Sings Val Doonican, Pt. II (1996) = The comic opens with a view inside Jeremy's mind, with his consciousness arguing with itself while Nilson, under the mind control of match making space aliens, rips off his trousers. The dinner-date is crashed by a platoon of space marines, with a troope of Las Vegas type showgirls in tow. As the aliens and the marines engage in a firefight, Jeremy confesses to Nilson that as a boy, he altered Uncle Angus's equipment to broadcast into the heavens a message requesting help meeting girls. With the firefight wiping out both the space marines and the match-making aliens, Nils and Jer crash-land in Greenland, castle and all. =Episode Six: Throw That Old Thing Away Grandma (1996) = While researching an article for her magazine, globetrotting journalist Kate Provoczki visits \\"scenic\\" Greenland. The issue is narrarated in the past tense, as Kate recounts the entire adventure for us, her lucky readers. It is here that she finds Jeremy next to the side of the road, naked in the snow. Her narrative betrays a strong neo-feminist attitude yet she is not heartless to the needs of a cold, naked human (even if he is a man). As we learn, Jer and Nilson had a squabble as they tried to make their way from the wreck of a castle. At the same time as we find this out, Kate is \\"sharing\\" her article with us, describing the signs that a relationship is unhealthy; the implication is unmistakable, Jer and Nils are locked in an abusive relationship, albeit with the gender roles reversed. In any case, Kate and Jeremy are now on a roadtrip around the world with stop including (but not limited to) Denmark, Tijuana, Alabama (or was it Arkansas?), and Amsterdam before finally back to Loch Snuff in Australia. The entire trip, which apparently lasts for months, Kate and Jeremey trade stories about their lives. Kate in particular is interested in Nilson, who she is, what she is doing with Jer, etc. Along the way, Jeremy gets sidetracked into the Mexican desert, Kate makes Jer play at being a model, Jeremy picks up a small pig Kate dubs \\"Arthur\\", and Kate tries to figure out just why Jeremy behaves the way he does. Only upon getting back home do we find out the bizarre truth, Nilson and Kate are cousins. Jeremy of course is absolutely floored. =Episode Seven: Drowning With Conviction (1996) = Jeremy wakes up from a nightmare about his cousin Dougal in his bed next to Loch Snuff, out in the open. Zeigfried has gone to Greenland and begun mailing back the entire castle. Nilson and Kate, reunited after two and a half years, go out to enjoy the nightlife together again. Jer, left to his own devices, has fun reconstructing the castle, playing with Arthur and chatting with Raoul. Meanwhile, a strange person is spying on Jeremy, videotaping him while adding a running commentary. Jeremy is convinced that it's Dougal prowling around, returned for vengeance. As Nilson and Kate tease one another about Jer and hang out at a club, Jeremy is firebombed by the stranger. =Episode Eight: Men Sent Him Jewelry (1997) = This flashback issue explains how Jeremy and Nilson first met. Two-and-a-half years ago, Nilson was at a party one night, bored stiff. While she was getting hit on by idiot men, Jeremy was in the apartment next door, working on some sort of project for university. In the middle of welding something, Jeremy's project explodes, sending him flying through the wall into the party and knocking out the electricity. Jeremy meekly apologizes and returns home, discovering with a start that Nilson has followed him over. She falls asleep on his couch with Jer while chatting but somehow sends a message to him while he is in class the next day, arranging to meet the next evening at the zoo to steal a seal. Later that day, Jeremy smuggles some equipment into the zoo and meets up with Nils near midnight. In the attempt to get away, Jeremy's cache of explosives (rigged to look like animals) accidentally goes off. Jeremy and Nilson escape in the chaos while the zookeeper tries in vain to save the animals. Jer awakes the next morning to find Nils splashing in the tub with the seal and her belongings sitting in the hall way. Nilson has moved in. =Episode Nine: Revoking My RSL Membership, Pt. I (1997) = Nilson awakens after a wild night with \\"Kyle\\" to find Kate gone. Kate finds the castle in smoldering ruins and surrounded by police tape. The readers get to find out who the stalker is: the former zookeeper from the zoo that Jer and Nils bombed over two years ago. After the incident she became mentally unhinged and is now running around with a video camera pretending to be a journalist/nature-show- host. Her tapes reveal that she has been secretly filming Jeremy as he rebuilds the castle. The former zookeeper throws a Molotov cocktail into the castle to flush out Jer, only to discover his elaborate set-up, so she telephones the police, who come and arrest him for arson, grave-robbing, carrying a concealed weapon, and resisting arrest, which Kate and Nilson discover in the morning. Unexpectedly, the video shows a strange black car pull up to the castle and take away Jeremy. The local police cannot disclose who took him away, so Kate and Nils just go back to the castle and get stinking drunk. The former zookeeper, on the other hand, tracks down the MacConnor family's private sanitorium, where Jeremy is being held. There, she abducts and substitutes herself for the new nurse, in order to get footage for her \\"documentary\\". =Episode Ten: Revoking My RSL Membership, Pt. II (1998) = Jeremy tries to write some outgoing mail in between torture sessions, Nilson and Kate track him down and uncover the zookeeper's \\"documentary\\" tapes, and Aunt Lottie informs Terrence that Jeremy will be given a \\"final chance.\\" =Episode Eleven: Revoking My RSL Membership, Pt. III (2000) = Nilson gets stinking drunk while Morely contemplates what to do with Jeremy next. The zookeeper finally loses it and Zeigfreid returns from Greenland to pull out the big guns. The story comes to a crashing close as Nilson and Kate decide to get Jeremy back the hard way. =Episode Twelve: Face Down In Junket (2004) = The issue opens with a small vignette of Jeremy and Nilson in period dress arguing in pseudo-Shakespearean dialogue over whether he should get naked in a mud puddle (somewhat reminiscent of Puss in Boots). We return to the central story-line with Kate narrating her return to work after a trip around the world (see Episode Six). Her editor rejects virtually all her ideas, so Kate, in a move of exasperation, suggests that the magazine print some pornography. Unexpectedly, she says yes, leaving Kate stuck at home trying to write it. Meanwhile, back at Loch Snuff, Jeremy and Nilson have a food fight, then a rush for the shower, which Jer narrowly wins. Nilson, not to be outdone, traps him outside on a ledge after his shower in nothing but a towel. She insists that he either take it off, or describe a something so lurid that it excites her within five minutes. His only permitted \\"out\\" is to ask Kate on the phone for advice. She takes pity on him and rattles off something quite steamy but Jeremy is far too embarrassed to actually recite it, so he \\"takes the plunge\\" in an unexpected way. =Episode Thirteen: If You Like That Sort Of Thing (2004) = Kate gets sick and tired of how Nilson walks all over Jeremy while also sleeping around with any man she comes across. So Kate asks Jer out on a date. Jeremy doesn't know what to make of it, especially since Nils tells him that Kate is only going out with him out of pity. Jeremy awkwardly stumbles about but loosens up after a few drinks. Nilson, however is lonely in the castle all night so she dumps all of Jeremy's stuff in the Loch in retaliation for him not coming home early. Jeremy and Kate have a blast but he passes out before things go too far. Although Kate accidentally discovers something about Jeremy right afterward. =Episode Fourteen: Come Sing The Waulking Songs, Pt. I (2005) = The morning after the date Kate is woken by a phone call from Raoul, the talking cupboard. This drives Jeremy in a panic back to the castle. Kate tries to talk to Jeremy, but even a lack of car does not stop him. Kate reluctantly goes after Jeremy, and back at the castle is open for Nils's interrogation. Although Nils smugly guesses nothing happens, Kate answers back with a comment hinting about what she discovered under Jeremy's kilt. Nils blames 'ghosts' for taking Jeremy's stuff and putting it into the lake. Unfortunately, when Jeremy goes in after them he is grabbed by the Loch Snuff Monster - a long-limbed slim humanoid. Jeremy manages to free himself by stabbing it with a dirk from his outfit, and runs back inside. Kate is incensed that Jeremy falls for Nils's plays for sympathy, and worse at finding out the panic was due to the fall of a standing stone into the lake. However, Jeremy is too distracted to be reasoned with, and Kate is resigned to using the spa with Nils instead. Jeremy is suffering the effects of the attack, chilled to the bone, and goes to the bathroom to freshen up. Instead he is attacked through the sink by the monster. Jeremy escapes again (just) and realises the spa where the girls have gone may not be the safest of places. He rescues them in time, but is dragged under himself. The monster is invisible to the others and Jeremy is out cold before Nils thinks to rescue her friend and pull him out of harm's way. When Jeremy comes too, nursed by Nils and Kate, he realises that Nils has gotten new glasses for him by discovering his uncle Angus's old workshop. =Episode Fifteen: Come Sing The Waulking Songs, Pt. II (2006) = Nils mocks Kate into leaving while Jeremy dwells on thoughts of his uncle. The doctor mysteriously appears looking at where the standing stone used to reside. However, this only goes observed by Arthur the pig as Jeremy and Nils are preoccupied with Uncle Angus's suddenly appearing workshop. Jeremy starts to experiment to discover exactly what the monster wants, and exactly the limits to its movement and powers around the castle. As this is through directly confronting the monster using various bodily fluids in various media, Jeremy's health begins to deteriorate. Nils is shut out of the experimentation process, compensates by digging up the standing stones mysteriously appearing in and out of the castle. Meanwhile, Kate's attempts at helping with clothing and food also fall flat. When the girls try to intercede, Ziegfried ejects them but not before they see one of the experiments, and Kate finally sees the invisible monster. Or doesn't see it. Spurred into action, Nils knocks Jeremy out cold and then plants the first 'suitable' standing stone she can find in the position the old one was located. However, the stone appears to be the now petrified body of Auntie Lottie that Nils dug up. As Nils proudly stands showing off the stone, Jeremy spots the Loch Snuff Monster behind her. =Episode Sixteen: Come Sing The Waulking Songs, Pt. III (2006) = The monsters goes for Jeremy not Nils, but despite Nils's best efforts the monster closes in. The doctor comes to the rescue, cutting the creature only Jeremy can see and rubbing salt into the wound. The doctor cannot believe what has been done with Lottie's corpse, although realises it was not on purpose. However, clearly Nils had made things worse. Meanwhile, Kate looks on from a distance clearly feeling the outsider in Jeremy's life. The four come together to discuss the situation. The doctor reveals the standing stone was a ward stone, and that its removal into the Loch combined with the iron skip of Jeremy's clothes has freed the monster but is keeping it enraged and focused on Jeremy. The doctor indicates his knowledge of the family matters, but does not help Jeremy as he has no clue to them. The plan finally concocted becomes placing Jeremy as bait at the iron-grate covered spa, away from the loch while the wardstone is freed by Kate. Kate is warned not to provoke the monster by touching the skip, but the wardstone is trapped under it. Moving the skip enrages the Loch Snuff Monster and it leaves Jeremy to go after the girls. Nils is standing onshore in Jeremy's hat, and so the monster throws the freed skip at her knocking her out. As the monster moves in for the kill, Jeremy grabs the hat and jumps into the lake buying Kate and the rest time to re-position the wardstone. The monster is placated again, and Nils regains consciousness only for the group to realise Jeremy is lost in the lake and has not resurfaced. The doctor is ahead of the group, and manages to get Jeremy out. A subdued Ziegfried and Kate comfort themselves with a coffee and cigarette while Nils lies in bed with a comatose Jeremy, sadly scolding and reading to him. Meanwhile, at the wardstone a small fissure appears. =Episode Seventeen: Listen To The Bees (2007) = Jeremy is still in a coma after his final showdown with the Loch Snuff Monster. Nilson copes with the situation by reading children's books to him, inventing new mixed-drinks, playing Mexican hat dance with potted plants, and pretending to repair Kate's car. Kate explores the castle and compiles a list of important questions she has for Jer. She also severely neglects her work and her boss. Jeremy's 'coma' is revealed to be ether induced by the doctor and others who obviously have plans for Jeremy. However, Nils is present when he begins to stir again and Jeremy regains consciousness properly when he has a vivid dream of Dougal strangling him. Kate discovers that she, along with her colleagues, has been made redundant. She angrily confronts Jeremy through a closed bathroom door, but when he comes out of the shower dressed only in a towel, she is too confused and embarrassed by her prior knowledge of his anatomy from Episode 13, stunned by her lack of work, and realises she needs to leave. =Episode Eighteen: For A Pair Of Fine Carrots, Pt. I (2007) = Kate returns to her house to find the door open. She goes into the house, and receives a shock. Meanwhile, with the castle restored and monsters beaten, Jeremy and Nils go back to their 'normal' lives. Jeremy plays rockets with Arthur the pig, while Nils tries to 'relieve the previous tensions' in her room alone. Unfortunately for Nils, nothing seems to work and distractions abound. However, the life around Loch Snuff is far from normal - a voice is heard talking to itself admiring the pig by the wardstone. The doctor and several key persons gather in a clandestine meeting at the castle to discuss the situation of Jeremy in cryptic words. A woman called Joan, who apparently expects to own the castle soon, is amongst them. Terms such as the 'sacrifice' and 'harvest' are discussed, and the petrification of Aunt Lottie and the tearing of the veil. Nils finally calls it quits after she cannot even get peace 'by herself' in Mr Morley's car, accidentally sounding the horn. Instead she decides to relieve the boredom by hotwiring the car and taking Jeremy into town to look at antiques. On the way Jeremy expresses his confusion at what he has done to make Kate her angry, seeking advice. Unfortunately for him, Nils is as tormenting as ever. It is Nils's turn to be wound up at the antiques shop, as Mr Pacey the owner gives Jeremy a clock to fix. With nothing to distract Nils, her tensions rise again with every innocent and not so innocent reminder. When even Jeremy, covered in lubricant, starts to look attractive Nils rushes from the store to go 'shopping', seeking relief from a helpful man in a music shop across the street. However, Nils still finds herself unable to let go of frustrations until she happens to catch sight of Jeremy across the road through the windows. Obviously freaked out, Nils chickens out of waiting for Jeremy to come out of the antiques' store, leaving a message for Jeremy to go without her and meet her at Kate's later. When Jeremy drives to Kate's though, he is met at the door by a mysterious man who knows not only Kate, but knows Kate's exploits with a polaroid camera up Jeremy's kilt. =Episode Nineteen: For A Pair Of Fine Carrots, Pt. II (2009)= In a series of flashbacks, we see Jeremy as a child, talking with his uncle about why they can't go in the ocean. Jeremy's parents arrive, and it is revealed that Jeremy's father is extraordinarily indifferent towards his own child. Jump to the present, and it is revealed that Kate's visitor is her gay brother Andre. They have a meal together, which involves a fair bit of scotch, and Kate expresses her confusion and frustration regarding Jeremy to Andre, who points out how convoluted and confusing the whole situation is (without knowing all the supernatural details). When Jer does arrive, Andre proceeds to defend Kate's honor (having found the polaroid shot from their date night). After some awkward back and forth, Jeremy shows Kate the note from Nilson. Kate thinks she is blowing them all off to disappear for a couple years again, which distresses Jeremy. Meanwhile, at the castle, a ceremony begins involving mysterious vials of fluid, interspersed with the continuing conversation at Kate's. As the ceremony progresses, Jeremy's personality completely changes several times, culminating in him turning to ice, whispering, \\"Help me.\\" =Episode Twenty: \\"Pipes\\" (2009)= Kate and Andre attempt to defrost Jeremy, then give up and take him back to the castle, looking for Doctor Cottington. Meanwhile, Nilson goes for an evening swim in her bra & panties and somehow is in two places simultaneously. Things get even weirder when Jeremy is reanimated, only to be seemingly swallowed by the earth at the foot of the Ward Stone.

What constitutes a sex crime differs by culture and legal jurisdiction. The majority of convicted sex offenders have convictions for crimes of a sexual nature; however, some sex offenders have simply violated a law contained in a sexual category. Some of the crimes which usually result in a mandatory sex-offender classification are: a second prostitution conviction, sending or receiving obscene content in the form of SMS text messages (sexting), and relationship between young adults and teenagers resulting in corruption of a minor (if the age between them is greater than 1,060 days). If any sexual contact was made by the adult to the minor, then child molestation has occurred. Other serious offenses are sexual assault, statutory rape, bestiality, child sexual abuse, incest, rape, and sexual imposition. Sex offender registration laws in the United States may also classify less serious offenses as sexual offenses requiring sex offender registration. In some states public urination, having sex on a beach, or unlawful imprisonment of a minor also constitute sexual offenses requiring registration.Sex offender ordinance catches family in legal Trouble, MSNBC.com Overview In looking at various types of offenses, an example of a digital obscenity offense is child pornography. In the modern world of technology, many jurisdictions are reforming their laws to prevent the over-prosecution of sex offenders and focusing on crimes involving a victim. The term sexual predator is often used to describe a sex offender or any of the \\"tier offenders\\"; however, only the category just below sexually-violent sexual predator is reserved for a severe or repeated sex offender: sexual predator. In the United States, the Adam Walsh Act (AWA) proposed to provide funding to each jurisdiction which would agree to incorporate its Act into their law. In the few jurisdictions accepting the agreement, there are Tier I, Tier II, or Tier III sex offenders. Individuals convicted of petty crimes not covered by the AWA are still liable to abide by the previous regulations denoting them as a sex offender (or habitual sex offender, sexual predator, sexually violent sexual predator, or child-victim offender). In the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries, a convicted sex offender is often required to register with the respective jurisdiction's sex offender registry. In the U.S., registry databases are often open to the public. Sexual offenders are sometimes classified by level.US Office of Justice Programs Archived from the original 2012-05-05. The highest-level offenders generally must register for their entire lives; low-level offenders may only need to register for a period of time. Recidivism The level of recidivism in sexual offenders is lower than is commonly believed. A 2002 study by the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) of the United States Department of Justice following 9,691 male sex offenders released from prisons in 15 US states in 1994 indicated that within the first 3 years following their release, rearrest and reconviction rates for new sex offenses were 5.3 and 3.5 percent, respectively; that is, about 1 in 19 of released sex offenders were arrested within three years for another sex crime. The same study found that during the same 3 years from release, 68 percent of released non-sex offenders were re-arrested for any crime (and 47.8 percent reconvicted), while 43 percent of the released sex offenders were rearrested for any crime (and 24 percent reconvicted). According to the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) of the United States Department of Justice,U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Offenders Statistics: Recidivism , statistical information from the late 1990s and very early 2000s, retrieved May 4, 2007 in New York state, the recidivism rate for sex offenders has been shown to be lower than any other crime except murder. Another report from the OJP which studied the recidivism of prisoners released in 1994 in 15 states (accounting for two-thirds of all prisoners released in the United States that year) reached the same conclusion. Of released sex offenders who allegedly committed another sex crime, 40 percent perpetrated the new offense within a year or less from their prison discharge. Within three years of release, 2.5 percent of released rapists were rearrested for another rape, and 1.2 percent of those who had served time for homicide were arrested for a new homicide. Sex offenders were about four times more likely than non-sex offenders to be arrested for another sex crime after their discharge from prison (5.3 percent of sex offenders, versus 1.3 percent of non-sex offenders). In 1991, an estimated 24 percent of those serving time for rape and 19 percent of those serving time for sexual assault had been on probation (or parole) at the time of the offense for which they were in state prison. Approximately 4,300 child molesters were released from prisons in 15 U.S. states in 1994. An estimated 3.3 percent of these 4,300 were rearrested for another sex crime against a child within 3 years of release from prison. Among child molesters released from prison in 1994, 60 percent had been in prison for molesting a child 13 years old or younger. The median age of victims of those imprisoned for sexual assault was less than 13 years old; the median age of rape victims was about 22 years. Child molesters were, on average, five years older than violent offenders who committed their crimes against adults. Nearly 25 percent of child molesters were age 40 or older, but about 10 percent of inmates with adult victims were in that age group. Post-incarceration registries and restrictions A sex offender registry is a system in place in a number of jurisdictions designed to allow authorities to keep track of the residence and activity of sex offenders (including those released from prison). In some jurisdictions (especially in the United States), information in the registry is made available to the public via a website or other means. In many jurisdictions, registered sex offenders are subject to additional restrictions (including housing). Those on parole (or probation) may be subject to restrictions not applicable to other parolees or probationers. These include restrictions on being in the presence of minors, living in proximity to a school or daycare center, or owning toys (or other items of interest to minors). Israel's sex offender registry is accessible only to security officials, rather than to the general public. Megan's Law, in the U.S., is designed to sanction sex offenders and reduce their recidivism rate. The law is enacted and enforced on a state-by-state basis. Most states also restrict where convicted sex offenders can live after their release, prohibiting residency within a designated distance of schools and daycare centers (usually ). Guided by the 2007 Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, sex offenders must avoid such areas as schools, bus stops, gyms, recreation centers, playgrounds, parks, swimming pools, libraries, nursing homes, and places of worship by . However, residence stipulations vary from state to state. Some states (such as Arkansas, Illinois, Washington and Idaho) do not require sex offenders to move from their residences if a forbidden facility is built or a law is enacted after the offender takes up residency. Many aspects of the laws are criticised by reformists and civil right groups like National RSOL and Human Right Watch,Raised on the Registry: The Irreparable Harm of Placing Children on Sex Offender Registries in the US Human Rights Watch 2013 and treatment professionals as Atsa. Committing to a residence requires a convicted sex offender to be notified of registration regulations by local law enforcement if convicted after January 1, 2005. The offender must act upon the notification within five business days of receipt. If and when an offender is released from incarceration, they must confirm their registration status within five business days. Registration data includes the offender's sex, height, weight, date of birth, identifying characteristics (if any), statutes violated, fingerprints and a current photograph. An offender's email addresses, chat room IDs and instant-messaging aliases must be surrendered to authorities. In Colorado, an offender must re-register when moving to a new address, changing their legal name, employment, volunteer activity, identifying information used online or enrollment status at a post-secondary educational institution. A web-based registration list may be found on county websites, which identifies adult convicted sex offenders who are sexually- violent predators convicted of felony sexual acts, crimes of violence or failure to register as required. Legally, \\"any person who is a sexually violent predator and any person who is convicted as an adult...has a duty to register for the remainder of his or her natural life\\".Committee of Legal Services, State of Colorado General Assembly. Exceptions to this include deferred sentencing for the offense or petition of the court for termination of registration.Colorado Bureau of Investigation, Colorado Division of Criminal Justice, Colorado Sex Offender Management Board. Some sex offenders are deemed too dangerous to society to be released, and are subjected to civil confinement -- indefinite continuing incarceration, which is supposed to, but does not always, provide meaningful treatment to the offender. Therapies and treatment Behavior modification programs have been shown to reduce recidivism in sex offenders.Marshall, W.L., Jones, R., Ward, T., Johnston, P. & Bambaree, H.E.(1991). Treatment of sex offenders. Clinical Psychology Review, 11, 465-485 Often, such programs use principles of applied behavior analysis. Two such approaches from this line of research have promise. The first uses operant conditioning approaches (which use reward and punishment to train new behavior, such as problem-solving)Maguth Nezu, C., Fiore, A.A. & Nezu, A.M (2006). Problem Solving Treatment for Intellectually Disabled Sex Offenders. International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy, 2(2), 266-275 BAO and the second uses respondent conditioning procedures, such as aversion therapy. Many of the behaviorism programs use covert sensitizationRea, J. (2003). Covert Sensitization. The Behavior Analyst Today, 4 (2), 192-201 BAO and/or odor aversion: both are forms of aversion therapy, which have had ethical challenges. Such programs are effective in lowering recidivism by 15‚Äì18 percent.Marshall, W.L., Jones, R., Ward, T., Johnston, P. & Bambaree, H.E.(1991). Treatment of sex offenders. Clinical Psychology Review, 11, 465-485 The use of aversion therapy remains controversial, and is an ethical issue related to the professional practice of behavior analysis. In 2007, the Texas State Auditor released a report showing that sex offenders who completed the Texas Sex Offender Treatment Program (SOTP) were 61 percent less likely to commit a new crime. Chemical castration is used in some countries and U. S. states to treat male sex offenders. Unlike physical castration, it is reversible by stopping the medication. For male sex offenders with severe or extreme paraphilias, physical castration appears to be effective. It results in a 20-year re-offense rate of less than 2.3 percent (versus 80 percent in the untreated control group), according to a large 1963 study involving a total of 1036 sex offenders by the German researcher A. Langel√ºddeke. This was much lower than otherwise expected, compared with overall sex offender recidivism rates. Although considered cruel and unusual punishment by many, physical castration does not otherwise affect the lifespan of men (compared with uncastrated men). =Risk assessment= Therapists use various methods to assess individual sex offenders' recidivism risk. Risk assessment tools consider factors that have been empirically linked by research to sexual recidivism risk. Researchers and practitioners consider some factors as \\"static\\", such as age, number of prior sex offenses, victim gender, relationship to the victim, and indicators of psychopathy and deviant sexual arousal, and some other factors as \\"dynamic\\", such as an offender's compliance with supervision and treatment. By examining both types of factors, a more complete picture of the offender's risk can emerge, compared with static or dynamic factors used alone.http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/pblctns/pprchs-rsksmt/index- eng.aspx Controversy It is argued that in the U.S., sex offenders have been selected as the new realization of moral panics about sex, stranger danger, and national paranoia, the new folk devils or boogeymen. People convicted of any sex crime are \\"transformed into a concept of evil, which is then personified as a group of faceless, terrifying, and predatory devils\\", who are, contrary to scientific evidence, perceived as a constant threat, habitually waiting for an opportunity to attack. Consequently, sex offenders are brought up by media on Halloween, despite the fact that there has never been a recorded case of abduction or abuse by a registered sex offender on Halloween. Academics, treatment professionals, and law reform groups such as National Association for Rational Sexual Offense Laws and Women Against Registry criticize current sex offender laws as based on media-driven moral panic and \\"public emotion\\", rather than a real attempt to protect society. This can motivate legislators to pass knee-jerk laws to address public hysteria, echoing a \\"populist punitiveness\\" perspective. Many lawmakers feel that they will attract votes by appearing to be \\"tough on sex offenders\\". One discrepancy pointed out by critics is that John Walsh, father of Adam Walsh and supporter of the Adam Walsh Act, has admitted having a relationship with a 16-year-old girl while being in his early 20s and aware of age of consent being 17 in New York, meaning that, had he been convicted, John Walsh himself could be required to register as a sex offender. Since passage of the Adam Walsh Act, Walsh himself has criticized the law, stating \\"You can't paint sex offenders with a broad brush.\\" Critics point out that contrary to media depictions, abductions by predatory offenders are very rare and 93% of child sexual abuse is committed by someone the child knows: a family member, a family friend, someone in a position of authority.U.S. Department of Justice, \\"Common Questions\\" citing (reference updated), retrieved September 10, 2015. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, sex offender recidivism is 5.3%, the lowest for any type of crime except homicide. Critics say that, while originally aimed at the worst offenders, as a result of moral panic the laws have gone through series of amendments, many named after the victim of a highly publicized predatory offense, expanding the scope of the laws to low- level offenders, and treating them the same as predatory offenders, leading to the disproportionate punishment of being placed on a public sex offender registry, with the consequent restrictions on movement, employment, and housing. As a result of this persistent media narrative of sex offenders, this panic is being preserved, leading legislators to make registration mandatory for all sex offences, without the possibility of judicial discretion for less dangerous offenders.

Melones (also, Robinsons Ferry and Robinson's) is a former settlement in Calaveras County, California, now submerged beneath a reservoir named New Melones Lake. It lay at an elevation of 955 feet (291 m). Melones was founded on the site of a ferry operated from 1848 by John W. Robinson and Stephen Mead. The town initially took its name from the ferry. The first post office opened in Robinsons Ferry in 1879, the name was changed to Robinson's in 1895, and to Melones in 1902. The post office was closed in 1932, re-established in 1933 and closed for good in 1942. In January 1923 Paramount Pictures chose Melones to construct a complete 1849 mining camp set there for the motion picture The Covered Wagon. The studio sent an authentic Sierra Railroad train built in 1897 to the location via the Angels Branch line to Melones.

The City of Boston's Office of Neighborhood Services has designated 23 Neighborhoods in the city: * Allston * Back Bay * Bay Village * Beacon Hill * Brighton * Charlestown * Chinatown/Leather District * Dorchester (divided for planning purposes into Mid Dorchester and Dorchester) * Downtown * East Boston * Fenway Kenmore (includes Longwood) * Hyde Park * Jamaica Plain * Mattapan * Mission Hill * North End * Roslindale * Roxbury * South Boston * South End * West End * West Roxbury The islands in Boston Harbor are administered as part of the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area. The Boston Redevelopment Authority, the City Parking Clerk, and the City's Department of Neighborhood Development have also designated their own neighborhoods. Unofficially, Boston has many overlapping neighborhoods of various sizes. Neighborhood associations have formed around smaller communities or commercial districts (often with \\"Square\\" in the name) that have a well-defined center but poorly identified extremities. History of Boston's neighborhoods As the city of Boston has grown and evolved, its neighborhoods have changed as well. The names of the West End, North End, and South End refer to their positions on the Shawmut Peninsula, the original extent of Boston. Due to the annexation of surrounding communities, those neighborhoods are no longer at those geographic extremities. The Back Bay and Bay Village neighborhoods were formerly part of an actual bay, becoming the neighborhoods they are today after landfill projects expanded the size of the city. Brighton (including Allston), Charlestown, Dorchester (including South Boston, Mid Dorchester, Mattapan, and Hyde Park), Roxbury (including West Roxbury, Roslindale and Jamaica Plain), have all at some point been municipalities independent from downtown Boston, providing a source of well- defined boundaries for the largest areas. Geographic overview Downtown Boston includes Downtown Crossing, the Financial District, and Government Center. Aerial view of the Back Bay and the neighboring City of Cambridge across the Charles River Surrounding downtown are the neighborhoods of Chinatown/Leather District, South End, North End, West End, Bay Village, Beacon Hill, and Back Bay. Chinatown/Leather District is the historical garment district and today has thriving Chinese and other Asian populations. The South End is the center of the city's LGBT population and also populated by artists and young professionals as well as a vibrant African American community. The North End retains an Italian flavor with its many Italian restaurants, though many of its Italian families have moved out, while young professionals have moved in.Goldfield, Alex R. The North End: A Brief History of Boston's Oldest Neighborhood. Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2009. The Back Bay, west of the Public Garden and Beacon Hill, a wealthy neighborhood, is the site of the Massachusetts State House. The Back Bay and Beacon Hill are also home to national and local politicians, famous authors, and top business leaders and professionals. Bay Village is one of the smallest neighborhoods in Boston and mostly contains Greek Revival-style row houses. North and east of downtown are the neighborhoods of East Boston and Charlestown. East Boston has a majority of Hispanic, Brazilian, and young professional population with a remnant of older Italians and is primarily the site of Logan International Airport. On the north bank of the Charles River is Charlestown; once a predominantly Irish enclave and site of the Bunker Hill Monument, it is now a haven for young professionals.name=\\"http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/east_boston/2011/04/census_data_hispanicslatinos_r.html West of downtown are the neighborhoods of Fenway Kenmore, Allston, Brighton, Longwood and Mission Hill. Fenway Kenmore borders the campus of Boston University and houses many college students and young professionals and is the location of Fenway Park. Allston and Brighton are populated heavily by students from nearby universities, as well as recent graduates. Mission Hill is an ethnically diverse neighborhood, adjacent to the Longwood area, which is full of world-class medical institutions. South of downtown are the neighborhoods of Roxbury, Jamaica Plain, Dorchester, Mid Dorchester, and South Boston. Dorchester, including Mid Dorchester, is Boston's largest neighborhood and predominantly a working class community considered to be Boston's most diverse. Roxbury is populated largely by African Americans, Caribbean Americans, and Latinos and is historically the center of Boston's black community. Jamaica Plain is a community of white professionals and Latinos, and includes the larger side of the Arnold Arboretum. South Boston is a predominantly Irish-American neighborhood, which hosts the city's annual St. Patrick's Day parade.Warner, Sam Bass. Streetcar Suburbs: The Process of Growth in Boston, 1870-1900. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1978. South of Roxbury, Jamaica Plain, and Dorchester are the neighborhoods of Mattapan, Roslindale, Hyde Park, and West Roxbury. Roslindale is known for its small business district and includes the smaller side of the Arnold Arboretum. Roslindale has also recently become a majority-minority neighborhood. Mattapan remains the neighborhood with Boston's highest concentrations of African Americans. Hyde Park and West Roxbury have a distinct suburban feel, while still being a part of the city of Boston. Both neighborhoods have large areas of wooded parks and recreation land. Hyde Park is populated largely by African Americans and Caribbean Americans, whereas West Roxbury is predominantly white with rapidly growing African American and Latino populations. List of places and squares within neighborhood areas The 23 official neighborhoods in Boston are made up of approximately 84 sub- districts, squares, and neighborhoods within each official neighborhood. The Boston Redevelopment Authority defines 16 planning districts (plus the Boston Harbor Islands) and 64 Neighborhood Statistical Areas (with four areas further subdivided). These correspond roughly with the neighborhoods and sub- neighborhoods of Boston. Unofficially, Boston is made up of approximately 105 neighborhoods. * Allston and Brighton **Allston Village ** Brighton Center ** Cleveland Circle ** Harvard Stadium/Charlesview ** Union Square ** Oak Square ** Faneuil Square ** Brighton Mills ** Lower Allston ** North Brighton ** Packard's Corner ** Soldier's Field * Back Bay ** Copley Square/Boston Public Library ** Commonwealth Avenue Mall ** Newbury Street General view of Bay Village * Bay Village (also known as South Cove) * Beacon Hill ** Louisburg Square ** Massachusetts State House * Charlestown ** Bunker Hill ** The Neck ** The Navy Yard ** Hayes Square ** City Square ** Thompson Square ** Sullivan Square * Chestnut Hill * Chinatown and the Leather District * DorchesterBoston schoolyard sites Map of Mid Dorchester and Dorchester ** Adams Corner/Adams Village ** Ashmont (including Ashmont Hill, Ashmont-Adams, and Peabody Square) ** Columbia Point/Harbor Point ** South Bay ** Cedar Grove ** Fields Corner ** Franklin Field ** Grove Hall ** Lower Mills ** Jones Hill ** Meeting House Hill ** Neponset ** Polish Triangle (extends into South Boston) ** Popes Hill ** Port Norfolk ** Savin Hill ** Uphams Corner * Downtown Boston and the Financial District ** Bulfinch Triangle ** Combat Zone (defunct) ** Downtown Crossing/Ladder District ** Fort Hill Square ** Government Center ** Haymarket Square (Boston) ** Post Office Square ** South Station ** Boston Theater District ** Waterfront Christopher Columbus Park in Downtown Waterfront * East Boston ** Eagle Hill ** Jeffries Point ** Orient Heights ** Central Square ** Day Square ** Maverick Square **Boston Logan International Airport **Ted Williams Tunnel **Callahan Tunnel **Sumner Tunnel **Suffolk Downs * Fenway/Kenmore ** Audubon Circle ** Back Bay Fens ** Kenmore Square ** Boston University (extends into Allston) ** Longwood Medical Area (extends into Mission Hill) ** Lansdowne Street/Fenway Park * Hyde Park ** Readville ** Fairmount Hill ** Sunnyside Lilac Sunday, Arnold Arboretum, Jamaica Plain * Jamaica Plain ** Hyde Square ** Forest Hills/Woodbourne ** Moss Hill * Mattapan ** Wellington Hill ** Mattapan Square * Mid Dorchester ** Bowdoin- Geneva ** Codman Square ** Four CornersFour Corners Main Street * Mission Hill and Longwood ** Brigham Circle ** Back of the Hill ** Parker Hill * North End ** Ann Street (North Street) ** Hanover Street North End, Boston * Roslindale ** Roslindale Square * Roxbury ** Egleston SquareEgleston Square Neighborhood Association ** Fort Hill ** Franklin Park (extends into Jamaica Plain and Dorchester) ** Nubian Square (formerly Dudley Square) ** Roxbury Crossing * South Boston ** Andrew Square (extends into Dorchester) ** D Street ** Dorchester Heights / Telegraph Hill ** Fort Point ** South Boston Waterfront/Seaport District ** City PointCity Point Neighborhood Association, South Boston * South End ** South of Washington (SoWa) * West End ** Charles Street ** North Station/TD Garden ** Massachusetts General Hospital * West Roxbury **Parkway (extends into Roslindale) References External links Lists of neighborhoods * Office of Neighborhood Services * Boston Redevelopment Authority * Neighborhood guides * Boston Neighborhoods website * Wikivoyage Boston guide * Things to Do in Boston's Neighborhoods - Photos & Recommendations Boston ","title":"Neighborhoods in Boston"},{"id":"2957072","text":"Sir Frederic William Burton (8 April 1816 in Wicklow - 16 March 1900 in London) was an Irish painter who was born in Co. Wicklow on 8 April 1816 And was taken by his parents to live in County Clare on the west coast of Ireland at the age of six. He was the third son of Samuel Frederick Burton and his wife Hanna Mallett.In the UK Census of 1891, Sir Frederick himself gives his age as 74 and place of birth as \\"Wicklow, Ireland\\". The old Burton seat was Clifden House, Corofin, Co.Clare, which was built around the middle of the eighteenth century. The artist's grandparents were Major Edward William Burton, Clifden, who was High Sheriff of Clare in 1799, and his wife, Jane Blood of nearby Roxton, Co. Clare. Sir Frederick was the third director of the National Gallery, London. Biography =Artistic career= Educated in Dublin, he was elected an associate of the Royal Hibernian Academy at the age of twenty-one and an academician two years later. In 1842 he began to exhibit at the Royal Academy. A visit to Germany and Bavaria in 1842 was the first of a long series of trips to various parts of Europe, which gave him a profound knowledge of the works of the Old Masters. From 1851 he spent 7 years working as a painter in the service of Maximilian II of Bavaria. Burton worked with George Petrie on archaeological sketches and was on the council of the Royal Irish Academy and the Archaeological Society of Ireland.Aspects of Irish Art. National Gallery of Ireland. Cahill & Co. 1974. Pg 106. Retrieved 18 March 2008 He was elected an associate of the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolours in 1855, and a full member in the following year. He resigned in 1870, and was reelected as an honorary member in 1886. A knighthood was conferred on him in 1884, and the degree of LL.D. of Dublin in 1889. In his youth he had strong sympathy with the Young Ireland Party. He died in Kensington, west London and is buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Dublin. The Meeting on Turret Stairs, 1864 Burton's best-known watercolours, The Aran Fisherman's Drowned Child (1841) and The Meeting on Turret Stairs (1864; also known as Hellelil and Hildebrand) are in the National Gallery of Ireland. Meeting on the Turret Stairs was voted by the Irish public as Ireland's favourite painting in 2012 from among 10 works shortlisted by critics.Aidan Dunne, Romantic Scene Voted Ireland's Favourite Painting, Irish Times, 25 May 2012 =Directorship of the National Gallery= In 1874 Burton was appointed director of the National Gallery, London, in succession to Sir William Boxall .H Potterton, 'A Director with Discrimination: Frederic Burton at the National Gallery', Country Life, vol 155 (1974), pp.1140-41. In June 1874, he obtained a special grant to acquire the art collection of Alexander Barker, which included Piero della Francesca's Nativity and Botticelli's Venus and Mars. In 1876 a bequest of 94 paintings, mainly by Dutch artists but also including works by Pollaiuolo, Bouts and Canaletto, was made by the haberdasher Wynne Ellis. Also in this year an extension to the Gallery by E. M. Barry was completed. pp. 86‚Äì87 During the twenty years that he held this post he was responsible for many important purchases, among them Leonardo da Vinci's Virgin of the Rocks, Raphael's Ansidei Madonna, Anthony van Dyck's Equestrian portrait of Charles I, Hans Holbein the Younger's Ambassadors, and the Admiral Pulido Pareja, by Diego Vel√°zquez (this subsequently attributed to Vel√°zquez's assistant Juan Bautista Mart√≠nez del Mazo). He also added to the noted series of Early Italian pictures in the gallery. The number of acquisitions made to the collection during his period of office amounts to more than 500.

It is a work of literary criticism, in which Poe presents his literary theory. It is based on a series of lectures Poe had given late in his lifetime. Synopsis The essay argues that a poem should be written \\"for a poem's sake\\" and that the ultimate goal of art is aesthetic. He also argues against the concept of a long poem, saying that an epic, if it is to be worth anything, must instead be structured as a collection of shorter pieces, each of which is not too long to be read in a single sitting. The essay critiques, sometimes rather sharply, the works of other poets of his time. His most common complaint is against didacticism, which he calls a \\"heresy\\". Though Poe is referring to poetry here, it is believed that Poe's philosophy against didacticism extends to fiction. Kagle, Steven E. \\"The Corpse Within Us\\" as collected in Poe and His Times: The Artist and His Milieu, edited by Benjamin Franklin Fisher IV. Baltimore: The Edgar Allan Poe Society, Inc., 1990: 104. Origins The essay was based on a lecture that Poe gave in Providence, Rhode Island at the Franklin Lyceum. The lecture reportedly drew an audience of 2000 people.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1992: 384. Some Poe scholars have suggested that \\"The Poetic Principle\\" was inspired in part by the critical failure of his two early poems \\"Al Aaraaf\\" and \\"Tamerlane\\", after which he never wrote another long poem. From this experience, Poe surmised that long poems are unable to sustain a proper mood or maintain a high-quality poetic form and are, therefore, inherently flawed.Poe, Harry Lee. Edgar Allan Poe: An Illustrated Companion to His Tell-Tale Stories. New York: Metro Books, 2008: 41. Critics have suggested that this theory was written so that Poe could justify why \\"Al Aaraaf\\" and \\"Tamerlane\\" were unpopular.Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z.

He played for the Montreal Expos, Washington Nationals, Cincinnati Reds, and Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB). Career Majewski graduated in 1998 from St. Pius X High School in Houston, where he was unanimously selected for Houston Player of the Year for his achievement of maintaining a 1.64 ERA and a 14-3 record. With that, he led his team to the state championship in Class 5A TAPPS. In the majors, Majewski had an ERA of 12.93 and 4 wins and 4 losses during the season. In his career, he pitched 242.1 innings. Majewski was traded by the Washington Nationals to the Cincinnati Reds along with Bill Bray, Royce Clayton, and Brendan Harris for Austin Kearns, Felipe L√≥pez, and Ryan Wagner. The trade caused some controversy, as the Reds front office was apparently unaware of cortisone shots which had been given to Majewski due to arm pain before the trade. It was alleged Majeski was known to be injured by Washington GM Jim Bowden and the trade was an attempt to dump him for some value to some unsuspecting team. In his time with the Nationals Majewski was very good, with a 2.93 ERA in 2005 and a 3.58 ERA with Washington up until he was traded. With the Reds he had very little success, with a 7.28 ERA in parts of three seasons. He was not re- signed after the 2008 season and pitched in only two games in the Major Leagues thereafter. A grievance was filed with MLB alleging misconduct by Jim Bowden and the Washington Nationals. However, MLB never revealed their findings and no punishment is on record. On December 23, 2008, Majewski signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. In December 2009 Majewski signed a minor league contract with the Houston Astros. On July 18, 2010, he was purchased from Triple-A Round Rock then was designated for assignment on July 21. In March 2012 Majewski was signed by the Sugar Land Skeeters, an American professional baseball team based in Sugar Land, Texas, where he pitched in 56 games for the Skeeters during the 2012 season, compiling an ERA of 3.37.

With the exception of nocturnal and very deep water cephalopods, all Coleoidea (squid, octopus and cuttlefish) which dwell in light conditions have an ink sac, which can be used to expel a cloud of dark ink in order to confuse predators. The ink sac is a muscular bag which originated as an extension of the hind gut; it is a modified hypobranchial gland.Nair, J.R., D. Pillai, S.M. Joseph, P. Gomathi, P.V. Senan & P.M. Sherief (2011). Indian Journal of Geo-Marine Sciences 40(1): 13‚Äì27. It lies beneath the gut and opens into the anus, into which its contents - almost pure melanin - can be squirted; its proximity to the base of the funnel means that the ink can be distributed by ejected water as the cephalopod uses its jet propulsion. The ejected cloud of melanin is bound by mucus particles, so it forms a lump approximately the size and shape of the cephalopod, fixing the predator's attention while the mollusc itself makes a hasty escape.

He was hanged by the Pahlavi dynasty for treason in 1947. Biography Qadi Muhammad was born into a noble Kurdish family from Mahabad. His father had cooperated with Ismail Shimko during his revolt against the Iranian government in the 1920s, and his brother Sadr Qazi was a member of the Iranian parliament. After his fathers death, he was nominated as a judge in Mahabad in the 1930s.Jwaideh, Wadie (2006-06-19), p. 250 Qazi Muhammad later became a member of the Komala Zhian I Kurd, a leading Kurdish organization in Iran at the time supported by the Soviets, in April 1945.Jwaideh, Wadie (2006), pp.247‚Äì248 Soon after he became its leader. Muhammad acted as the President of the Republic of Mahabad, which was founded in January 1946, and declared publicly in March of the same year.Jwaideh, Wadie (2006), p. 252 He was also the founder of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran, that was established after the need for a more transparent party was felt by its adherents. (Komeley Jiyanewey Kurd existed prior to that, as a secret organization.) Mustafa Barzani, one of the leaders of the nationalist Kurdish movement in Iraqi Kurdistan, was also the commander of its army. His cousin, Mohammed Hossein Saif Qazi, was a minister in his cabinet. In April 1946, with the support of the Soviets, Muhammad signed a peace treaty with Ja'far Pishevari of the Azerbaijani republic in which they exchanged assurances that the Azerbaijani and Kurdish minorities rights in each republic would be preserved. A year later, after the Soviets withdrew from Iran, the socialist Kurdish Republic was crushed by Iran's central government. Family One of his sons, Ali Qazi, is today an active member in the Kurdish movement. One of his daughters, Efat Ghazi, was killed by a letter bomb in V√§ster√•s, Sweden, in 1990. The bomb was addressed to her husband, the Kurdish activist Emir Ghazi. Some analysts speculated that the Iranian government might have been involved in the assassination.

The plot focuses on the effect a seductive young man has on four siblings. Synopsis Adam is a young Dubliner who ingratiates himself into the Owens family after meeting Lucy at the restaurant where she waits tables and sings. While wooing her, he becomes involved with her more reserved older sister Laura, a romantic literary type who spends most of her time at the library, her oldest married sister Alice, a new mother who is unhappy with her boring husband Martin, and her brother David, who seeks Adam's advice on how to seduce his repressed girlfriend, only to find himself nearly succumbing to Adam's charms himself. Revisits are made to several scenes, each seen from the point-of-view of a different character. Cast *Stuart Townsend ..... Adam *Kate Hudson ..... Lucy Owens *Frances O'Connor ..... Laura Owens *Rosaleen Linehan ..... Peggy Owens *Charlotte Bradley ..... Alice Owens Rooney *Alan Maher ..... David Owens *Brendan Dempsey ..... Martin Rooney Production Kate Hudson performs \\"The Man I Love\\" by George and Ira Gershwin, \\"You Do Something to Me\\" by Cole Porter, and \\"All the Way\\" by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen. During the closing credits, Peggy Lee performs \\"Sisters\\" by Irving Berlin. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2000 and was shown at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival in the Czech Republic in July 2000 but wasn't released theatrically until it opened in Ireland in January 2001. It was given a very limited release in the U.S., where it grossed $159,668. Critical reception Stephen Holden of The New York Times said \\"Guilt-free and nearly devoid of erotic angst, About Adam is the flip side of movies like Teorema, Something for Everyone and those slogging Tennessee Williams dramas in which an irresistible, omnisexual stud is often an angel of death. Here he is an angel of sexual health in an impossibly euphoric world where sibling rivalry and sexual jealousy are only passing twinges of discomfort, not consuming passions. The movie's blissful spirits coincide with its portrait of modern, freshly-scrubbed-looking Dublin as the closest thing to Fun City the British isles have to offer nowadays.\\" Emanuel Levy of Variety called the film \\"smartly sexy,\\" a \\"brightly observed narrative,\\" and \\"a frolic free of any judgments ... marked by Stembridge's sparkling wit.\\" He added, \\"Stembridge plays with shifting perspectives in a fresh manner that defies expectations of the romantic genre ... This literate ensembler is propelled by talent behind and in front of the camera. Townsend, who physically resembles the young Terence Stamp, is perfectly cast as the dark, spirited outsider. Rest of the mostly female cast is equally deft and attractive.\\" Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide rated it three out of four stars, calling it \\"sweet, likable and consistently engaging, if so insubstantial that it's always on the verge of blowing away\\" and adding, \\"Townsend pulls off the unenviable job of making Adam a chameleon-like seducer without allowing him to seem like a cad or a callous sexual opportunist ... Stembridge deftly balances genre expectations with just enough stylistic flourishes to make it feel surprisingly fresh. The movie starts to fade from memory as soon as it's over, but for an hour and a half it's a pleasantly diverting lark.\\" References External links  2000 films Irish films Irish romantic comedy- drama films British films British romantic comedy-drama films American films American romantic comedy-drama films Films set in Dublin (city) BBC Films films 2000 romantic comedy-drama films ","title":"About Adam"},{"id":"2957184","text":"A coal pier is a transloading facility designed for the transfer of coal between rail and ship. The typical facility for loading ships consists of a holding area and a system of conveyors for transferring the coal to dockside and loading it into the ship's cargo holds. Originally the holding area consisted of a rail yard in which the loaded cars were sorted by grade and held until needed for loading. Modern facilities are more likely to unload the cars immediately (say with rotary car dumpers) and store the coal in piles until the ship is loaded. This frees up the cars for immediate reuse and obviates rail yard maintenance. Dedicated coal piers began to be constructed in the 1880s at ports on the Atlantic Coast and Great Lakes in the United States, and many of these survive (though highly modified) to the present. In Virginia, beginning in 1881, coal piers, operated by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) on the Virginia Peninsula at Newport News and in South Hampton Roads by the Norfolk and Western (N&W;) and Virginian Railway (VGN) at Norfolk, made the port of Hampton Roads the largest shipping point of coal in the world by 1930. The Curtis Bay coal terminal in Baltimore, Maryland, built by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) in the 1880s, was for a time the largest such facility in the world. C&O; and B&O; also had facilities on Lake Erie. In modern times, CSX Transportation continues to serve coal piers at Newport News and Curtis Bay, and Norfolk Southern operates a large complex at Lambert's Point in Norfolk. Pacific Northwest As of 2013 in the Pacific Northwest of the United States a number of coal terminals such as the Gateway Pacific Terminal in Bellingham, Washington were proposed for export of coal from the Powder River Basin to China.Dirty war; A rancorous scrap over plans to send American coal to Asia Coal would move from strip mines in Wyoming and Montana by rail April 20, 2013 The Economist The Gateway Pacific Terminal, if constructed, would be operated by SSA Marine and commence operations in 2016.

He served two terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1965 to 1969. Early life Walker was born in Fulton, Kentucky, and attended public schools there until his family moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1926. He graduated from Albuquerque High School, and attended the University of New Mexico and George Washington University. In 1942, he enlisted in the United States Army and served during the Second World War in the North African and European Theaters of operation until the end of the war. He was discharged in 1945. Political career Walker was elected to the New Mexico House of Representatives in 1948 from Silver City in Grant County. Walker was made Majority Whip. He served two terms, until 1952. His most notable accomplishment in the State Legislature was sponsoring legislation to allow women to serve on juries. In 1952, he was elected as New Mexico's Commissioner of Public Lands, served two consecutive two-year terms in that office, and then was made commissioner of the Bureau of Revenue for New Mexico. In 1960 he was elected NM Commissioner of Public Lands for two more consecutive two-year terms. In 1964, he was elected to the House of Representatives by the state's voters at large to the seat previously held by Joseph Montoya, who successfully ran for the Senate that year. He served two terms in Congress, during which he was a member on the Armed Services Committee. He sponsored legislation that created Pecos National Monument. In 1968, New Mexico drew congressional districts for the first time, and its two representatives were no longer elected at large. Walker's home was placed in New Mexico's 2nd congressional district, which included most of the southern half of the state as well as a small portion of Albuquerque. Walker had lost a lot of goodwill in this part of the state because of his support of gun control and the Pentagon's closure of Walker Air Force Base near Roswell which Walker adamantly opposed. Ed Foreman, a former congressman from Texas, ran the most expensive campaign seen in New Mexico history to that point, and defeated Walker in November 1968 by a mere half point margin. Walker would remain minimally involved in state politics for the rest of his life, but never run for elected office again. Walker died of leukemia in Albuquerque at the age of 89. He was cremated.

Among the first mortgage companies employing computers to solicit prospective borrowers and hasten the loan application process, Ameriquest was accused of predatory lending practices by United States banking regulators. The company was notable for its promotion of the stated income loan, whereby potential borrowers were allowed to claim income without verification of employment. The proliferation of lending to customers with marginal creditworthiness proved to be not only a key factor leading to the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis, but also a catalyst to Ameriquest's own demise. Ameriquest was widely known throughout the United States for its promotional activity. It advertised widely on television; flew blimps over football and baseball stadiums; and sponsored the Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang tour, the Super Bowl XXXIX halftime show, and NASCAR drivers. Its ad slogan was \\"proud sponsor of the American dream,\\" and its company motto was \\"do the right thing.\\" Ameriquest frequently reiterated that their customers were \\"more than a number,\\" producing a series of commercials with the theme \\"Don't judge too quickly. We won't.\\" History Ameriquest was founded in 1979 by Roland Arnall, in Orange County, California, as a savings and loan association, or thrift, called Long Beach Savings & Loan. After moving to Long Beach, California and being converted to a pure mortgage lender in 1994, the company was renamed Long Beach Mortgage Co. In 1997, the department that funded loans made by independent brokers was spun off into a publicly traded company that was ultimately purchased by Washington Mutual in 1999. Long Beach Savings & Loan was subsequently reorganized into three divisions under the auspices of ACC Capital Holdings, a private conglomerate owned entirely by Arnall: Ameriquest Mortgage Company (retail banking), Argent Mortgage (wholesale banking), and AMC Mortgage Services (loan servicing). In 2004 alone, Ameriquest was estimated to have originated over $50 billion in new subprime mortgages. The home stadium of the Texas Rangers was called Ameriquest Field until March 19, 2007, when Ameriquest relinquished naming rights. The stadium was renamed Rangers Ballpark in Arlington and subsequently Globe Life Park in Arlington. On September 1, 2007, Citigroup completed its acquisition of Argent Mortgage and AMC Mortgage Services, shutting down Ameriquest Mortgage.  Predatory lending allegation  In 1996, the company agreed to pay $3 million into an \\"educational fund\\" to settle a Justice Department lawsuit accusing it of gouging and predatory lending practices against older, female, and minority borrowers. Prosecutors accused it of allowing mortgage brokers and its own employees to charge these customers an additional fee of as much as 12 percent of the loan amount. As part of the settlement, Ameriquest (then still known as Long Beach Mortgage) agreed to use the educational fund to train its employees in proper mortgage techniques and to refrain from utilizing predatory lending techniques, but only within the State of California. Shortly after entering into this settlement agreement, the company \\"switched\\" names with its subsidiary and began aggressively seeking refinance-mortgage business throughout the United States. In 2001, after being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission, the company settled a dispute with ACORN, a national organization of community groups, promising to offer $360 million in low-cost loans. In February 2005, reporters Michael Hudson and E. Scott Reckard broke a story in the Los Angeles Times about \\"boiler room\\" sales tactics at Ameriquest. Their investigation found evidence that the company had undertaken various questionable practices, including \\"deceiving borrowers about the terms of their loans, forging documents, falsifying appraisals and fabricating borrowers' income to qualify them for loans they couldn't afford.\\" On 1 August 2005, Ameriquest announced that it would set aside $325 million to settle investigations by 30 state attorneys general into allegations that it had preyed on borrowers by offering loans with hidden fees and balloon payments. In at least five of those states‚ÄîCalifornia, Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Florida‚ÄîAmeriquest had already settled multimillion-dollar suits. Federal Housing Administration commissioner Brian Montgomery stated that the settlement reinforced his concern that the industry was exploiting borrowers and that he was \\"shocked to find those customers had been lured away by the 'fool's gold' of subprime loans\\". In May 2006, Ameriquest Mortgage announced it was closing all of its retail offices and in the future would make its loans through mortgage brokers, a channel not covered by the predatory-lending settlement. On June 13, 2007, lawyers for borrowers seeking class status asserted in a filing with the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois that \\"assets of the Ameriquest entities were transferred to Arnall with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the plaintiffs in this action.\\" Former Ameriquest employees alleged that they were pushed to falsify documents on bad mortgages and then sell them to Wall Street banks looking to make fast profits. There is growing evidence that such mortgage fraud may have been at the heart of the financial crisis of 2007 to 2010. Charity Ameriquest operated the Soaring Dreams Fund, which donated money to initiatives that help children. During the 2006 NASCAR Busch Series season, the fund was promoted on race cars, whose designs were picked in a contest.

Donaldina Cameron (July 26, 1869 ‚Äì January 4, 1968) was a pioneer in the fight against slavery as a Presbyterian missionary in San Francisco's Chinatown, who helped more than 2,000 Chinese immigrant girls and women escape from forced prostitution and indentured servitude.The White Devil's Daughters: The Women Who Fought Slavery in San Francisco's Chinatown, Alfred A. Knopf, 2019. She was known as \\"Fahn Quai,\\" or the ‚ÄúWhite Devil‚Äù of Chinatown, as well as the \\"Angry Angel of Chinatown.\\" Early life (1869‚Äì1900) The youngest of seven children, Donaldina was born into a Scottish family that lived on a sheep farm in New Zealand and moved with her family to California when she was three and a half. During her childhood, Donaldina had very little contact and experience with immigrant populations while living on a large sheep ranch in the San Gabriel Valley. Family friend Mary P.D. Browne‚Äîthe former president of the Women‚Äôs Occidental Board of Foreign Missionaries‚Äîtook Donaldina to the Presbyterian Home in an effort to expose Donaldina to the world around her. At the home, Donaldina met Margaret Culbertson and, in 1895, became a sewing teacher there. Culbertson and the Presbyterian Home acted as a place of refuge for women forced into sex slavery and freed indentured female Chinese servants, where they could be safe from the outside world and get an education. Together, Culbertson and Cameron worked to rescue Chinese immigrants until Culbertson‚Äôs death in 1897. Background The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first piece of federal immigrant legislation in the United States. It prohibited immigrants from any area considered ‚Äúundesirable‚Äù, which included most of Asia. It also barred Chinese women from entering the United States, unless they were already married to men in the United States. Originally passed to prohibit the sex trafficking of Asian women and an influx of Asian male laborers, it instead created a dangerous and illegal system where young women would present forged papers that said they were already members of Chinese families in the United States. This phenomenon was dubbed the \\"paper daughters.\\" The women, often referred to as Mui Tsais, were sold as domestic servants or forced prostitutes by the Tongs (criminal societies). These women lived brutal lives, usually dying within five years. During this time San Francisco City Hall, run by Abe Ruef and Eugene Schmitz, took kickbacks from Tong groups, resulting in very little government action against this problem. The Chinese Six Companies was a Chinese organization that attempted to stop the Tongs, but eventually collapsed when Tongs infiltrated the organization. Mission life (1900‚Äì1934) Occidental Board Presbyterian Mission House, renamed the Donaldina Cameron House in 1942, at 920 Sacramento (2018) Two years after Culbertson‚Äôs death in 1897, Donaldina Cameron became superintendent of the Presbyterian Home at the young age of 27. She continued the mission of the Home, saving young Chinese immigrant women from sex slavery and indentured service. Contemporary sources referred to this work as \\"the only foreign mission enterprise ever carried on in the United States\\". Many friends and relatives of these girls would leave secret messages for Donaldina at the Presbyterian Home indicating the house where a girl was held captive. Often, criminal tong members, who nicknamed her ‚ÄúJesus Woman‚Äù and the \\"White Devil,\\" would threaten Cameron and the home. She once even spent a night in a San Jose jail while seeking the release of a Chinese woman. However, Cameron continued her mission. She was sometimes called \\"Fahn Quai,\\" translated variously as ‚ÄúWhite Spirit,‚Äù ‚ÄúWhite Witch,‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhite Devil‚Äù‚Äîa sensational racial epithet that newspaper and magazine reporters helped spread. She was also dubbed the ‚ÄúAngry Angel of Chinatown‚Äù, which would later become the title for a biography. Once freed, Chinese women were forced to reside at the Presbyterian Home (where they were not allowed outside without an escort) and to convert to Christianity. While some Chinese immigrant women welcomed conversion and saw Donaldina as a savior, nicknaming her ‚ÄúLo Mo‚Äù (which she translated as \\"mother\\"), others had mixed feelings about this forced conversion. Often, Donaldina could be very patronizing towards these women, using terms like ‚Äúwaif‚Äù and ‚Äúchildren‚Äù to describe the residents of the home. Very rarely was Chinese culture integrated into the education of the girls in the home. Instead, there was a strict curriculum of English, Christianity and western housekeeping skills. Finally, the women of the home were only allowed to leave the home if they married a Christian man approved of by Cameron. In April 1906, the great San Francisco earthquake and fire forced the evacuation of the Presbyterian Home. Donaldina returned the night of the earthquake through the blazing city to retrieve a logbook that detailed her guardianship over the girls at the home, thus ensuring their safety from being forced back into servitude or prostitution.The White Devil's Daughters: The Women Who Fought Slavery in San Francisco's Chinatown, Alfred A. Knopf, 2019. The home itself was destroyed in the earthquake. It was rebuilt in 1907 at 920 Sacramento Street, where it still stands today. Cameron also wrote extensively, seeking to gain financial support for her mission, in publications like Women and Missions and a pamphlet titled \\"The Yellow Slave Traffic\\". This writing often furthered orientalist depictions of Chinese women, but also challenged popular preconceptions that such women were incapable of integrating into American society. Donaldina also founded two homes for Chinese children. Many of these children were orphans or the children of the rescued women. The Chung Mei Home served young boys, while the Ming Quong Home was for girls. The former Chung Mei house is today part of the Windrush School in El Cerrito, California, and the Ming Quong Home is now a part of Mills College in Oakland, California. In 1935 a third Ming Quong home‚Äîthe \\"baby house\\"‚Äîwas founded in Los Gatos, California. Younger Chinese American girls were taken care of here until they were old enough (age 13) to move to Oakland. That home today is part of nonprofit EMQ FamiliesFirst. Later life and legacy (1934‚Äì1968) Donaldina retired from her missionary work and the Presbyterian Home in 1934. She is credited with saving and educating over 2,000 Chinese immigrant women and girls. Before her death, she was considered something of a \\"national icon\\", and her life story was told in three biographies, some with fictional elements. In 1942, the Presbyterian Home was renamed the Donaldina Cameron House. Cameron House still stands today in San Francisco. It serves as a multi-service agency serving Asian communities by promoting healthy Christian communities through programs like youth sports, tutoring, and counseling. After retirement, Donaldina moved to the Palo Alto area. She died on January 4, 1968, at the age of 98.

H2N2 has mutated into various strains including the Asian flu strain (now extinct in the wild), H3N2, and various strains found in birds. It is also suspected of causing a human pandemic in 1889. The geographic spreading of the 1889 Russian flu has been studied and published. Russian flu Some believe that the 1889‚Äì1890 Russian flu was caused by the influenzavirus A virus subtype H2N2, but the evidence is not conclusive. It is the earliest flu pandemic for which detailed records are available. More recently, there are speculations that it might have been caused by one of the early coronaviruses found in the 1960s.Anthony King: What four coronaviruses from history can tell us about covid-19, on: New Scientist, 29 April 2020 Asian flu The \\"Asian Flu\\" was a category 2 flu pandemic outbreak of influenzavirus A that originated in Singapore in early 1957 lasting until 1958. The first cases were reported in Singapore in February 1957. In February 1957, a new influenza A (H2N2) virus emerged in East Asia, triggering a pandemic (‚ÄúAsian Flu‚Äù). This H2N2 virus was composed of three different genes from an H2N2 virus that originated from an avian influenza A virus, including the H2 hemagglutinin and the N2 neuraminidase genes. It was first reported in Singapore in February 1957, Hong Kong in April 1957, and in coastal cities in the United States in summer 1957. Some authors believe it originated from mutation in wild ducks combining with a pre-existing human strain. Other authors are less certain. It reached Hong Kong by April, and US by June. Estimates of US and worldwide deaths caused by this pandemic varies widely depending on source; ranging from approximately 69,800 to 116,000 in the United States, and worldwide from 1 million to 4 million, with the World Health Organization (WHO) settling on \\"about 2 million,\\" with a overall mortality rate of 0.6%. Asian Flu was of the H2N2 subtype (a notation that refers to the configuration of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins in the virus) of type A influenza, and an influenza vaccine was developed in 1957 to contain its outbreak. The Asian Flu strain later evolved via antigenic shift into H3N2 which caused a milder pandemic from 1968 to 1969. Both the H2N2 and H3N2 pandemic strains contained avian influenza virus RNA segments.Chapter Two : Avian Influenza by Timm C. Harder and Ortrud Werner from free on-line Book called Influenza Report 2006 which is a medical textbook that provides a comprehensive overview of epidemic and pandemic influenza. right Test kits From October 2004 to February 2005, approximately 3,700 test kits of the 1957 H2N2 virus were accidentally spread around the world from the College of American Pathologists (CAP). CAP assists laboratories in accuracy by providing unidentified samples of viruses; private contractor Meridian Bioscience in Cincinnati, U.S., chose the 1957 strain instead of one of the less deadly avian influenza virus subtypes. The 1957 H2N2 virus is considered deadly and the U.S. government called for the vials containing the strain to be destroyed.

Arnall (March 29, 1939 - March 17, 2008) was an American businessman and diplomat. As the owner of ACC Capital Holdings, he became a billionaire with Ameriquest Mortgage. He was co-founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and from 2006 until shortly before his death he was the United States Ambassador to the Netherlands. Personal life Roland Arnall was born on March 29, 1939 in Paris, France. His parents were Eastern European Jews who had fled to Paris. During World War II, Arnall was raised as a Roman Catholic in a French village. He was kept unaware of being a Jew until after the war had ended, when he was six years old. After the war, Arnall and his family moved to Montreal, Canada. In the late 1950s they relocated to the United States, and for a while Arnall sold flowers on the streets of Los Angeles, California. In 1977 Arnall, a longtime supporter of Israel, helped found the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the Museum of Tolerance. He served for 16 years on the California State University board of trustees. He purchased singer Engelbert Humperdinck's Los Angeles estate for $30 million. He also bought a ranch in Aspen, Colorado for $46 million from movie mogul Peter Guber. Ameriquest Arnall was the billionaire owner of ACC Capital Holdings, the parent company of Ameriquest, which was once one of the United States's largest sub-prime mortgage lenders. By the end of 2005 two of Arnall's companies, Ameriquest and Argent, had funded almost $75 billion in subprime loans. A major factor of this development was Arnall's origination of the stated income loan, meaning loans were given without verification of income.Paul Muolo and Mathew Padilla, 2010, p. 86 In early 2006, the company announced a $325 million settlement with state attorneys general and law enforcement agencies and financial regulators in 49 states and the District of Columbia who had accused Ameriquest of misrepresenting and failing to disclose loan terms, charging excessive loan origination fees and inflating appraisals to qualify borrowers for loans. In 2007 Arnall got out of the mortgage business having sold most of it to Citigroup for an undisclosed amount.Paul Muolo and Mathew Padilla, 2010, pp. 96ff Ambassador to the Netherlands Arnall (right) with former Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende Ambassador Arnall meets with the Youth Organisation Freedom and Democracy On August 1, 2005, President George W Bush nominated Arnall to become the U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands. The Senate approved his nomination on February 9, 2006. Arnall was installed as ambassador on March 8, 2006 when Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands received Arnall's letters of credence. Arnall announced his resignation as ambassador on February 21, 2008, effective on March 7, citing the ill health of his son.http://www.radionetherlands.nl/news/international/5653358/US-ambassador- to-The-Hague-to-step-down A few weeks later, on March 17, 2008, Arnall died of cancer according to FOX Business at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, twelve days shy of his 69th birthday. Family Arnall and his wife, Dawn, were longtime, generous political contributors, giving to both parties, according to Federal Election Commission records. Arnall had two children with his first wife Sally, Daniel and Michelle, from whom he divorced in 1998 after a 37-year marriage. Political activities Since 2002, Arnall had given campaign contributions to California politicians including Arnold Schwarzenegger. In the 2003‚Äì05 period, Arnall and his wife raised more than $12 million for George W. Bush's political efforts, including $5 million for the Progress for America Voter Fund, a self-proclaimed \\"conservative issue advocacy organization dedicated to keeping the issue record straight.\\" Arnall was quoted as saying his support for Bush stemmed for his stance on Israel. In 2004 he was one of the top 10 donors to the Republican Party. Mrs. Arnall also served as a co-chair for the 2004 Republican Convention and hosted a $1 million Bush-Cheney fundraiser at the couple's home in Holmby Hills. In 2005, Ameriquest Capital and three of its subsidiaries comprised four of the 53 entities that each contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush. Writes USA Today, \\"Inaugural fundraisers Dawn and Roland Arnall found a creative way to pump more than the $250,000 limit into the event. Their mortgage firm, Ameriquest Capital, contributed the maximum, as did three subsidiaries, for a total of $1 million. The company declined to comment on its political giving.\\" In order to circumvent campaign finance laws, Arnall mandated that Ameriquest staffers, on company time, solicit campaign contributions from vendors and directed to selected candidates, including Antonio Villaraigosa, Mayor of Los Angeles from 2005‚Äì13. Arnall's contributions to Republican Bush were a change of heart, and the result of Arnall's support for Bush's middle east policies post 9/11. Previously, Arnall was a long-time Democratic Party supporter and fundraiser. His wedding to Dawn Arnall was officiated by Democratic California Governor Gray Davis. Arnall was also an ardent supporter and fundraiser for Los Angeles Mayor Democrat Antonio Villaraigosa. Last will and testament SHMAIS.com (Lubavitch News Website) reported that Chabad of California was to be the beneficiary of an $18 million donation from the estate of Roland Arnall. According to their source, before his death, he made arrangements for Rabbi Shlomo Cunin to receive the donation, and a short while later sent in a down payment of $180,000. Arnall made three payments of $180,000 each to Chabad before dying of cancer in March 2008; after his death, Chabad sought payment for what it said was the balance of his pledge.

H3N2 viruses can infect birds and mammals. In birds, humans, and pigs, the virus has mutated into many strains. In years in which H3N2 is the predominant strain, there are more hospitalizations. Classification H3N2 is a subtype of the viral genus Influenzavirus A, which is an important cause of human influenza. Its name derives from the forms of the two kinds of proteins on the surface of its coat, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). By reassortment, H3N2 exchanges genes for internal proteins with other influenza subtypes. Seasonal H3N2 flu Seasonal influenza kills an estimated 36,000 people in the United States each year. Flu vaccines are based on predicting which \\"mutants\\" of H1N1, H3N2, H1N2, and influenza B will proliferate in the next season. Separate vaccines are developed for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres in preparation for their annual epidemics. In the tropics, influenza shows no clear seasonality. In the past ten years, H3N2 has tended to dominate in prevalence over H1N1, H1N2, and influenza B. Measured resistance to the standard antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine in H3N2 has increased from 1% in 1994 to 12% in 2003 to 91% in 2005.Ronald Ban This Season's Flu Virus Is Resistant to 2 Standard Drugs. New York Times. January 15, 2006 Seasonal H3N2 flu is a human flu from H3N2 that is slightly different from one of the previous year's flu season H3N2 variants. Seasonal influenza viruses flow out of overlapping epidemics in East Asia and Southeast Asia, then trickle around the globe before dying off. Identifying the source of the viruses allows global health officials to better predict which viruses are most likely to cause the most disease over the next year. An analysis of 13,000 samples of influenza A/H3N2 virus that were collected across six continents from 2002 to 2007 by the WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance Network showed the newly emerging strains of H3N2 appeared in East and Southeast Asian countries about six to 9 months earlier than anywhere else. The strains generally reached Australia and New Zealand next, followed by North America and Europe. The new variants typically reached South America after an additional six to 9 months, the group reported.CIDRAP article Study: New seasonal flu strains launch from Asia published 16 April 2008 Swine flu Pigs can harbor influenza viruses adapted to humans and others that are adapted to birds, allowing the viruses to exchange genes and create a pandemic strain. A 2007 study reported: \\"In swine, three influenza A virus subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, and H1N2) are circulating throughout the world. In the United States, the classic H1N1 subtype was exclusively prevalent among swine populations before 1998; however, since late August 1998, H3N2 subtypes have been isolated from pigs. Most H3N2 virus isolates are triple reassortants, containing genes from human (HA, NA, and PB1), swine (NS, NP, and M), and avian (PB2 and PA) lineages. Present vaccination strategies for swine influenza virus (SIV) control and prevention in swine farms typically include the use of one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses.\\" Avian influenza virus H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China, and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam, contributing to the emergence of new variant strains. Pigs can carry human influenza viruses, which can combine (i.e. exchange homologous genome subunits by genetic reassortment) with H5N1, passing genes and mutating into a form which can pass easily among humans. H3N2 evolved from H2N2 by antigenic shift and caused the Hong Kong Flu pandemic of 1968 and 1969 that killed up to 750,000 humans. The dominant strain of annual flu in humans in January 2006 was H3N2. Measured resistance to the standard antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine in H3N2 in humans had increased to 91% by 2005. In August 2004, researchers in China found H5N1 in pigs. Flu spread, by season =Hong Kong Flu (1968‚Äì1969)= Hong Kong flu (magnified about 100,000 times) The Hong Kong Flu was a category 2 flu pandemic caused by a strain of H3N2 descended from H2N2 by antigenic shift, in which genes from multiple subtypes reassorted to form a new virus. This pandemic of 1968 and 1969 killed an estimated one million people worldwide. The pandemic infected an estimated 500,000 Hong Kong residents, 15% of the population, with a low death rate. In the United States, about 100,000 people died. Both the H2N2 and H3N2 pandemic flu strains contained genes from avian influenza viruses. The new subtypes arose in pigs coinfected with avian and human viruses and were soon transferred to humans. Swine were considered the original \\"intermediate host\\" for influenza, because they supported reassortment of divergent subtypes. However, other hosts appear capable of similar coinfection (e.g., many poultry species), and direct transmission of avian viruses to humans is possible. H1N1 may have been transmitted directly from birds to humans (Belshe 2005).Chapter Two : Avian Influenza by Timm C. Harder and Ortrud Werner from excellent free on-line book Influenza Report 2006 The Hong Kong flu strain shared internal genes and the neuraminidase with the 1957 Asian flu (H2N2). Accumulated antibodies to the neuraminidase or internal proteins may have resulted in much fewer casualties than most pandemics. However, cross-immunity within and between subtypes of influenza is poorly understood. The Hong Kong flu was the first known outbreak of the H3N2 strain, though there is serologic evidence of H3N2 infections in the late 19th century. The first record of the outbreak in Hong Kong appeared on 13 July 1968 in an area with a density of about 500 people per acre in an urban setting. The outbreak reached maximum intensity in two weeks, lasting six weeks in total. The virus was isolated in Queen Mary Hospital. Flu symptoms lasted four to five days. By July 1968, extensive outbreaks were reported in Vietnam and Singapore. By September 1968, it reached India, the Philippines, northern Australia and Europe. That same month, the virus entered California from returning Vietnam War troops. It reached Japan, Africa and South America in 1969. =Fujian flu (2003‚Äì2004)= nomenclature Fujian flu refers to flu caused by either a Fujian human flu strain of the H3N2 subtype or a Fujian bird flu strain of the H5N1 subtype of the Influenza A virus. These strains are named after Fujian province in China. A/Fujian (H3N2) human flu (from A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2)-like flu virus strains) caused an unusually severe 2003‚Äì2004 flu season. This was due to a reassortment event that caused a minor clade to provide a haemagglutinin gene that later became part of the dominant strain in the 2002‚Äì2003 flu season. A/Fujian (H3N2) was made part of the trivalent influenza vaccine for the 2004‚Äì2005 flu season. =2004‚Äì2005 flu season= The 2004‚Äì05 trivalent influenza vaccine for the United States contained: * an A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like virus * an A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2)-like virus * a B/Shanghai/361/2002-like virus.CDC article Update: Influenza Activity‚ÄîUnited States and Worldwide, 2003‚Äì04 Season, and Composition of the 2004‚Äì05 Influenza Vaccine published 2 July 2004 =2005‚Äì2006 flu season= The vaccines produced for the 2005‚Äì2006 season used: * an A/New Caledonia/20/1999-like(H1N1) * an A/California/7/2004-like(H3N2) (or the antigenically equivalent strain A/New York/55/2004) * a B/Jiangsu/10/2003-like viruses =2006‚Äì2007 flu season= The 2006‚Äì2007 influenza vaccine composition recommended by the World Health Organization on 15 February 2006 and the US FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on 17 February 2006 used: * an A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like virus * an A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2)-like virus (A/Wisconsin/67/2005 and A/Hiroshima/52/2005 strains) * a B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like virus from B/Malaysia/2506/2004 and B/Ohio/1/2005 strains which are of B/Victoria/2/87 lineageCDC fluwatch B/Victoria/2/87 lineage =2007‚Äì2008 flu season= The composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2007‚Äì2008 Northern Hemisphere influenza season recommended by the World Health Organization on 14 February 2007 was: * an A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1)-like virus * an A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2)-like virus (A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2) and A/Hiroshima/52/2005 were used at the time) * a B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like virusRecommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2007‚Äì2008 northern hemisphere influenza season.

Reports of influenza-like-illness (ILI) are nearing what have been peak levels during moderately severe seasons, and CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination and antiviral drug treatment when appropriate at this time. On January 9, 2013, the Boston Government declared Public Health Emergency for H3N2 Flu Epidemic. One factor that may indicate increased severity this season is that the predominant circulating type of influenza virus is Influenza A (H3N2) viruses, which account for about 76 percent of the viruses reported.

Early years By age 6, Lon was taking lessons in piano, singing, and dancing. When she was 10, she was featured as a singer, earning $20 per week on her own radio program in Henderson, Texas. In her teens, she traveled across Texas, performing in a variety of venues. She attended Kilgore College in Texas and was a member of the school's Rangerettes dance team. Biography Throughout the big-band era and the years that followed, each of Lawrence Welk's female vocalists was always nicknamed \\"The Champagne Lady\\". Lon assumed the title in 1955, during the TV program's first season. Her alto singing voice graced Welk's show weekly until 1959, when she left the show over musical and money issues, although a popular legend developed that she was fired for showing too much leg and for crossing her feet on Welk's desk, something he didn't like. Viewers missed the popular Alice Lon, and Welk received many messages in the American Broadcasting Company mailbox demanding that she be rehired. Welk tried to bring her back, but she refused and was ultimately replaced in 1960 by Norma Zimmer. Lawrence and Lon eventually reconciled personally, but never worked together professionally again. On Welk's show, Lon was known for wearing particularly full skirts with colorful petticoats designed by her mother, Lois Wyche, as she told TV Guide. She gave instructions in the article on how viewers might make their own petticoats. She recorded an album for Coral Records titled It's Alice with orchestra directed by George Cates, the musical supervisor for Welk's show. The liner notes provide the following: \\"Miss Lon, first introduced by Welk as \\"Alice from Dallas\\", began singing, dancing and playing the piano at six. By the time she was ten, the precocious young songstress was appearing on her own sponsored radio show. In her teens she began touring her native Texas playing theaters, veterans' hospitals and army camps until she was signed by Interstate Theaters in Dallas. Appearing on the Interstate circuit, she also starred on its weekly radio show, \\"Showtime\\", emanating from the Palace Theater in Dallas. While touring for Interstate, she was invited to appear on the Don McNeill's famous radio show The Breakfast Club in Chicago, an engagement that was to be the first of a great many radio and TV appearances in that area. Family Lon was married to Bob Waterman, with whom she had three sons, Bobby, Clint and Larry. After she and Waterman divorced, she married George Bowling. Death She died April 24, 1981, at Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas. The cause of death was scleroderma, an autoimmune disease.

In its 1877 incarnation, it was the discovery site of a group of galaxies known as Stephan's Quintet, discovered by its director √âdouard Stephan. Marseille Observatory is now run as a joint research unit by Aix-Marseille University and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). The old Palais Longchamps facilities are a noted tourist destination in Marseilles area, and a planetarium was also added in 2001. One of the noted exhibits is the Foucault glass-mirror telescope, and various items from centuries of astronomical activities. Foucault's telescope is a noted historical example, because it was the forerunner of the modern style of big reflecting telescopes which use a minute layer of metal on a figured piece of glass. Before this, the main technology was to make the whole mirror of metal, and it would really be another half-century before silvered glass mirrors really caught on for astronomy. A major change in the 20th century was to change from using solution to coat the glass with silver, to use a vapor deposition process.  18th century  The observatory was founded in 1701 in montee des Accoules (this is a location near Vieux Port, Marseille, France). Antoine Laval was the first director. The 1761 Transit of Venus was observed from the Marseilles Observatory. A telescope 6 feet long made by Short was used for this observation. These observations were conducted by the astronomer Louis Lagrange. In 1789 Jean-Louis Pons began work at Marseille Obs. as a doorkeeper, but he also received lesson in astronomy; by 1801 he discovered his first comet. Pons would become one of the most prolific comet discovers, finding 37 in all a significant portion of all comet discoveries for a quarter of a century.  19th century  Astronomer Jean-F√©lix Adolphe Gambart discovered 16 comets from the old observatory. Another astronomer of Marseilles Observatory was Benjamin Valz. Jean-Louis Pons (1761-1831) discovered his first comet in 1801, and went on to find 37 more in his career much of it at Marsielles Obs. The Comet Pons-Brook was discovered by J.L. Pons in July 1812, however it was not seen again until June 1883. (The next time it was recovered was in 1953) Some other famous comets discovered by Pons include 7P/Pons‚ÄìWinnecke, 12P/Pons‚ÄìBrooks, and 273P/Pons‚ÄìGambart, among many others. (see also Comet Pons) Pons also discovered comets that came to be known by other names including Encke's Comet, Comet Crommelin, and Biela's Comet. One reason for this was the discoveries sometimes turned out to be re-discoveries or co-discoveries (discovered at the same time by others), and finally some Comet's were being named for their orbit computer's in style of Halley's comet. In 1863 Marseilles Observatory became a branch of the Paris Observatory. This led to a new building inaugurated by 1864, designed by the architect of Notre Dame de la Garde, also the 80 cm reflector was installed by that year. (At the Palais Longchamp site) Work continued on improvements and by 1866 a Comet Seeker telescope of 18 cm aperture by Martin, and 25.8 cm (10.25\\") aperture refractor by Merz by 1872. The Merz refractor was on equatorial mounting with governor done by Focault. Focault operated his 80 cm silver-on-glass reflector at Marseille Observatory (a telescope with aperture 80 cm (31.5 inches) from about 1862 to its retirement in 1965. The telescope was noted for being a pioneering design, that used silver-coated glass in a reflecting telescope. There was also instruments and facilities for magnetic studies. 1872 Marseilles reported several new nebula discovered using the Eichens searcher. In 1873 Marseilles Observatory announced the discovery of 300 new nebula. Of these 75 had there positions accurately cataloged, which was done by comparing the location of the nebula with previously cataloged stars of known position. In 1873 Marseilles Observatory detached from Paris Observatory. In 1874 the Comet C/1874 H1 was discovered from the observatory. 20th century  In 1914, the Orion nebula was observed with the Perot-Fabry interferometer. In 1965 the Focault 80 cm reflecting telescope was retired. In 1989 the Marseille telescope was completed at the observatory, and then sent to the southern hemisphere later that year. The telescope is a reflecting telescope with 36 cm (~14.2\\") diameter mirror with a low-expansion glass- ceramic and of the Richey-Chr√©tien type. Starting in 1990 Marseille Observatory had a study of H alpha (H-alpha (HŒ±)) in the southern galactic plane. This included observations of the Magellanic Clouds also. This study used the 36 cm Marsielle telescope at La Silla observatory in the southern hemisphere for data. The telescope was equipped with both a photon counter and a Fabry-Perot interferometer for this study. In 1999 a Marseilles Observatory published a study on simulating the formation of proto-planets and planetesimals with a large planetary body. This simulation used the GRAPE-4 system.  2000s  Marseille Observatory use the GRAPE, a gravity simulation software to simulate planetary formation In 2000, Marseille Observatory merged with the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique Spatiale to become the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille (LAM) within the broader Observatoire Astronomique Marseille Provence which also included the Haute-Provence Observatory. In 2008, LAM was relocated to a new 10,000 square meter facility in the Technop√¥le Chateau-Gombert in Marseille. The facility includes two major technology platforms for qualification of space instruments and for fabrication and metrology of optical mirrors. LAM astronomers specialize in cosmology and galaxy evolution, exoplanets and Solar System, and R&D; in optics and instrumentation. In 2012, the Observatoire Astronomique Marseille Provence merged with other earth-sciences research institutes from Aix- Marseille University and became a new entity called the Observatoire des Science de l'Univers Institut Pyth√©as (OSU-IP) which now includes 6 major labs for earth and universe sciences: CEREGE, IMBE, MIO, LAM. LPED, MIO as well as the Haute-Provence Observatory.

SourcesDr. Palmer's Student's wordpress site: Black BottomMosaic depicting Black Bottom at University City High School disagree on the exact boundaries to the north and south, but the neighborhood is generally understood to have been north and separate from the campus of the University of Pennsylvania and south of the Mantua and Powelton Village neighborhoods. Prior to being called Black Bottom or simply the \\"bottom\\", the area was once part of or overlapped places called Blockley, Hamilton Village, West Philadelphia Borough, and Greenville.Greenville After being razed for urban renewal (gentrified), the area is frequently called University City or West Philadelphia. History In the decades preceding Philadelphia's consolidation in 1854, the area was home to taverns and businesses catering largely to the stagecoach and cattle droving trades. After the Civil War, it developed into one of West Philadelphia's affluent streetcar suburbs. The University of Pennsylvania moved there in 1870. After World War I, wealthier residents moved further west into West Philadelphia and its suburbs, leaving neighborhoods in eastern West Philadelphia in decline. The relative availability of cheap housing in the area attracted many African Americans, including migrants from the Southern States, who faced housing discrimination elsewhere in the city. = Urban renewal = The University of Pennsylvania had expanded as far north as Walnut Street by 1920, but in 1959, Penn, Drexel University, University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, and Presbyterian Hospital sought to create large- scale redevelopment in the area to eradicate blight and develop a \\"University City\\" neighborhood of residences and services for students, faculty and staff.

The camp was founded in 1951 by Mel Friesen and can now host 250 people. CBS offers the chance for people to take a break from their regular lives so they can study the Bible, rest and play. The camp offers a number of recreational activities, including swimming, fishing, table tennis, volleyball, hiking, kayaking, basketball, horseshoes, shuffleboard, and has a play yard for children. CBS hosts groups of InterVarsity college students from various campuses in Southern California during the year, primarily in fall and spring through early summer (\\"Fall Conference\\" and \\"Chapter Camp\\", respectively). Additionally, CBS hosts Long Beach Marine Institute (\\"LBMI\\") and Catalina Island Marine Institute (\\"CIMI\\"), both outdoor education institutes, during the spring and fall. For many summers, CBS hosted family camps and high school camps led by Paul and Virginia Friesen. CBS is often noted as the birthplace of the \\"Mark Study,\\" an in-depth inductive study of the Gospel of Mark. The originator of the inductive method (and co-founder of CBS) was Paul Byer. Byer graduated from the University of Southern California and was on the staff with InterVarsity there for many years. His original Mark manuscripts (along with teaching notes and other documents) can now be found on display in the library of CBS's new building, named the \\"Crow's Nest\\", which opened in late summer 2006. History Campus By the Sea has gone through many stages of development since its founding. After torrential downpours in the early months of 1980, the narrow valley in which the facilities are located was flooded. The swiftly moving creek which normally ran along one side of valley, overran its banks, washing eight cabins and buildings out to sea. The fresh water plumbing was destroyed and the camp was on the edge of ruin. However, those loyal to the camp rallied to see that it was cleaned up and renovated. Frantic preparations began that spring for the summer camping season. Fund raising and blueprints had already begun for a new dining facility/multi-purpose building, and soon volunteer and professional construction teams arrived to make this a reality. The new building, dubbed \\"The Lighthouse\\" for its first-in-camp use of Edison electricity, upgraded the service that Campus by the Sea was able to offer. (Prior to construction of the Lighthouse, the camp had relied upon generators for its power needs.) \\"The Lighthouse\\" was initially powered also powered by a generator, but it drew so much fuel that it was only turned on when camps were in. Within a year or two, this was deemed unsustainable, and three electrical/telephone poles were installed. A \\"winterized\\" facility (that is, insulated), the addition of \\"The Lighthouse\\" and some enclosed cabins enabled the camp to extend its booking dates late into the fall, and to start much earlier in the spring. A core of year-round staff was hired and retained to meet the needs of this expanded camping schedule. The rest of the 1980s was a time of continued development at Campus by the Sea. Two historic cabins, \\"Rock Cod\\" and \\"Sea Horse\\", were insulated, wired with electricity and expanded, in order to better house the year-round staff. Electricity and telephone lines expanded during the 1980s as well. A permanent pier set on pilings was installed in the winter of 1986/87, replacing the rope-and-pulley shuttle system which had been the means of bringing campers from boat to shore for over 35 years. This, along with a central bathroom-shower pavilion built in 1990, prepared the camp for year- round use. However, the camp still usually closes down for two months, from mid-December to mid-February. This is usually the worst weather season for Catalina due to high waves and downpours. Fires threatened CBS in 2007Development of Campus By the Sea continued through the 1990s. Notably, three cottages were constructed in the back of the canyon to add an element of privacy and permanent housing for the year-round staff. A maintenance shed was also built outside the main part of camp to provide a safe work area for mechanics in which to service the numerous boats and heavy equipment that are so necessary to the camp's operation. In May 2007, wildfires on Santa Catalina Island came dangerously close to the camp and threatened several buildings. At seemingly the last moment, winds shifted and the camp escaped relatively unscathed.Article about May 2007 fire, and evacuation of CBS External links *InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA *UCLA alumni article about Randy Wong, head chef at Campus by the Sea *Long Beach Marine Institute References Summer camps in California Santa Catalina Island, California Youth organizations based in California Buildings and structures in Los Angeles County, California ","title":"Campus by the Sea"},{"id":"2957421","title":"Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario candidates in the 1985 Ontario provincial election"},{"id":"2957423","text":"Root Fire is the debut album from the Canadian rock band Bedouin Soundclash.

Skelton was a loyal member of the Liberal Party, an expert on international affairs, and a nationalist who encouraged Canadians to pursue autonomy from the British Empire, and to take on what he proclaimed was \\"the work of the world.\\"  Early life and career  Born on July 13, 1878, in Orangeville, Ontario, Skelton went on to gain a scholarship to Queen's University in 1896 and studied classics. His education in classical languages helped him to pass the examinations for entry into Britain‚Äôs Indian Civil Service (ICS), but he failed the medical test. In 1899 he earned a Master of Arts degree and audited classes of Adam Shortt, a political scientist. He worked in Philadelphia for The Booklover's Magazine and in 1904 married Isabel Murphy. He then took up the study of political economy at University of Chicago and followed the lectures of Thorstein Veblen, whom he admired for his \\"stock of science and of philosophy & of first hand knowledge of business affairs.\\" Skelton kept in touch with Shortt at his alma mater and was offered work there in 1907. Skelton earned his doctorate in political economy from the University of Chicago in 1908. He was appointed to the John A. Macdonald Professorship of Political Science and Economics at Queen's University in 1909, which he held until 1925. He also served as the university's Dean of Arts and as chair of their board of trustees. He was the author of two books in the Chronicles of Canada series: The Day of Sir Wilfrid Laurier: A Chronicle of Our Own Times (1916) and The Railway Builders: A Chronicle of Overland Highways (1920).  Civil service career Skelton later became Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs, replacing an aging Sir Joseph Pope in 1925. He became one of Mackenzie King's most trusted advisors during the inter-war era. He served as the principal adviser to the Prime Minister and was sometimes called the \\"deputy prime minister\\". King's choice of Skelton to succeed Pope was influenced in part by an address which Skelton gave to the Canadian Club in Ottawa in 1922, praising King's decision for neutrality during the Chanak crisis and stated that Canada should not issue \\"blank cheques\\" to Britain as in 1914 when Canada considered itself automatically at war with Germany because Britain had declared war.Levine, Allen William Lyon Mackenzie King : a Life Guided by the Hand of Destiny Toronto: Douglas & McIntyre, 2011 page 131. He served for more than 15 years in this capacity. Skelton was described by one historian as the most powerful civil servant in Canada of his time. Skelton served as a member of the 2nd Council of the Northwest Territories until his death on January 28, 1941, in Ottawa. His death, coming in the midst of wartime, hit King very hard; the two, who shared similar educational backgrounds, had been close. Historian John English, in his biography of Lester B. Pearson, wrote that Skelton played the major role in the building of Canada's external affairs department.Shadow of Heaven: The Life of Lester Pearson, volume 1, by John English.

He was a major leader of the democratization movement in Taiwan. He graduated from the Department of Law of National Taiwan University. He was first exposed to politics in 1976 while serving as attorney for (1908‚Äì1985) who sued the ruling KMT party for electoral fraud. Lin was elected a member of Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council in Kuo's old electorate in 1977. He remains a controversial figure by Taiwanese media under martial law. Lin family massacre Lin was arrested on 13 December 1979 for his involvement in the Kaohsiung Incident. His wife, Fang Su-min, and mother were first allowed to visit him on February 27, 1980; Lin Yi-hsiung was in detention and had been beaten severely by the police. Lin's mother contacted the Amnesty International Osaka office after their visit. Condolences and photos of the victims, 2019 anniversary memorial service at Gikong Presbyterian Church. Around noon on 28 February, broke into Lin's home off Xinyi Road in Taipei and stabbed Lin's 60-year-old mother, Yu A-mei (), and his three daughters. His mother and two of the daughters, 6-year-old twins Lin Liang-chun () and Lin Ting-chun (), died of their wounds; the eldest daughter, 9-year-old (Lin Huan- chun), was badly wounded after being stabbed multiple times and was the only survivor of the incident. Fang was not at home, as she was visiting Lin at the time. The authorities claimed to know nothing about it, even though Lin's house was under 24-hour police surveillance; because of the tight surveillance, it has been speculated the murders were committed as a warning to other pro-democracy activists. There are no suspects to this day; although a foreign family friend of the Lins was officially accused and placed under \\"police protection\\", he later was cleared. Investigative journalist David E. Kaplan concluded the \\"Iron Blood Patriots\\" may have been responsible, under the auspices of Chiang Hsiao-wu. =Afterwards= Fang moved to the United States with her eldest daughter in 1981; Lin Huan-chun learned piano, embraced Christianity, and married Rev. Joel Linton in 1998. She is now a renowned pianist and gospel singer in Taiwan. After returning to Taiwan in 1983, Fang was elected to the Legislative Yuan in December 1983. Chen Ding-nan stated the murder of Lin's mother and daughters also motivated him to start his political career. In August 1984, Lin left jail on parole. Desmond Tutu met with Lin during a visit to Taiwan in 2007, urging forgiveness and publicity for Lin's story. President Tsai Ing-wen attends the annual memorial service at Gikong Presbyterian Church on Feb 28, 2017. The Gikong or Yi-Kwang Presbyterian Church () was erected on the site of the former Lin family residence off Hsinyi Road. A memorial service is held annually at the church on February 28. Gikong was founded to provide religious services and comfort for the families of dissidents affected by the Kaohsiung Incident, and later expanded its mission to all political victims. =Reinvestigated= The case was reopened in 2009 by the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office; it was discovered that a call had been placed from the Lin's home to a restaurant shortly after the murders, but the caller did not speak. No new interviews were conducted for the later investigation, and the investigation was closed after four months. The High Prosecutors Office concluded there was not enough forensic evidence, and further, there was nothing to tie the Taiwan Garrison Command to the crime. The investigation was criticized as a sham, intended only \\"to prove that security agencies were not behind [the crimes].\\" In 2018, the Transitional Justice Commission announced it would investigate the massacre using documents from the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau. Some of those records had been damaged in the wake of Typhoon Nari in 2001. For other records belonging to the National Security Bureau, it was not certain that all the requested documents could be declassified. Post incident career Lin returned to Taiwan in 1989 and became a major advocate against nuclear power in Taiwan soon after. In 1995, he ran and lost in the Democratic Progressive Party's four-way primary for the 1996 Taiwan presidential election. Three years later, Lin Yi-hsiung became the 8th Chairperson of Democratic Progressive Party (1998‚Äì2000) and successfully ran a campaign for Chen Shui-bian as the 10th President of the Republic of China. Immediately following Chen's election in May 2000, Lin demonstrated his unwillingness to share the spoils of victory in a surprising retirement from DPP's chairmanship. Citing Robert Frost's poem, he retired with the remark that he preferred to take \\"the road less travelled by\\". Leaving all public and party posts behind him, Lin has been concerning himself with 'reform from outside (the centers of power)' as he campaigns for various issues of environmental justice and parliamentary reform, most importantly in mobilizing public support against nuclear power (2000) and for reducing the number of parliamentary seats by half (2004), both of which are detrimental to Chen's and DPP's hold on power. In late 2005, he encouraged and endorsed Wong Chin-chu's candidacy in the Democratic Progressive Party's chairmanship by-election of 15 January 2006. Some observers considered Wong as the reformist candidate because the two other candidates each represented the then president and premier's factions respectively. Lacking a factional base, however, Wong was only able to marshall 9.4% of the votes. Less than two weeks later, on 24 January 2006, Lin Yi-hsiung renounced membership of the Democratic Progressive Party of Taiwan. He said the elections of recent years had become partisan dogfights, resulting in national upheaval. He therefore had no intention of serving in the party's administration, nor of running for public office for the party. According to Lin Yi-hsiung, it was no longer meaningful to be a DPP member, and he has chosen to be a non-partisan citizen of his democratic country. Despite this, Lin recently endorsed and campaigned for the Democratic Progressive Party's two candidates in the December 2006 mayoral elections. Lin went on the campaign trail for Frank Hsieh (candidate for Mayor of Taipei City) and Chen Chu (candidate for Mayor of Kaohsiung City), both of whom are long time friends of his dating back to the late 1970s. He states that despite all its vices, the Democratic Progressive Party still remains the most progressive party in Taiwan. On 22 April 2014, Lin Yi- hsiung began a hunger strike at Taipei's Gikong Presbyterian Church to demand that the government halt the construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant in New Taipei City's Gongliao District, while also calling for an amendment to the referendum law. Lin intended to sustain the fast until construction of the nuclear power plant was halted. He ended the strike eight days later when the government pledged to halt construction on the power plant.

It was developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Sierra Entertainment. It was announced at the E3 Expo in May 2002, shortly after the TV series was canceled. Jessica Alba and Michael Weatherly reprised their roles from the series, voicing Max Guevara and Logan Cale respectively. The game follows an original storyline, with players controlling Max Guevara as she fights the I Corporation and attempts to find her twin sister. It was released on PlayStation 2 and Xbox in November 2002. The game was met with generally unfavorable reviews. It was frequently criticized for its unoriginality, repetition and certain gameplay issues, though some praised its graphics, storyline and voice acting. Gameplay Max may kickflip off walls over enemies to evade or attack them from behind. Dark Angel is a single- player beat 'em up game played from a third person view. Players take control of Max Guevara, a genetically-enhanced super soldier. Levels involve fighting enemies while following a fairly straightforward path to the level's exit. Max attacks enemies using various punches, kicks and throws, and can also utilize the environment to perform actions, such as kickflipping off a wall then attacking an enemy from behind. She can also perform moves like back flips and side twirls to evade enemies. Occasionally Max may have to interact with the environment to advance past a point, such as placing an explosive on a door, though what is required to progress through the level is clearly highlighted to the player. Max receives communications from Logan Cale, who offers his advice on how she may reach objectives. The game also presents 'stealth mode' sequences during some levels. In stealth mode, Max can distract enemies by making noise or perform stealth kills by sneaking up on them. If Max is spotted during stealth mode, a timer is activated and additional enemies begin to appear. If she has not reached the exit or killed the enemies when the timer has run out, the level must be restarted. Boss enemies are present in some levels. Plot Dark Angel follows an original storyline that takes place after the destruction of the headquarters of Manticore, an organization which creates genetically-enhanced super soldiers, at the beginning of the TV series' second season. Seattle has been placed on a curfew as the I Corporation round up the escapees from Manticore. They are particularly interested in capturing super soldier Max Guevara. Max evades and fights I Corporation through the streets of Seattle as she returns to her apartment. After battling opponents in her apartment lobby, Max learns that her friend and flatmate Original Cindy has been captured by the sector police. After defeating the police and rescuing Original Cindy, Max goes to meet her friend and ally, cyber-journalist Logan Cale at his apartment. Outside the apartment complex she defeats an I Corporation genetically engineered boss character named Beetle. Meanwhile, a cloaked figure murders a police officer at the scene and steals his vehicle. Logan informs Max that he has received an email from someone named Sylan who claims that Max has a twin sister. He traces the email to an I Corporation research lab named Tritech. Max tells Logan that Sylan was one of the child soldiers at Manticore, and that she stayed behind in order to help Max and eleven of her siblings escape. Max proceeds to Tritech to find her. Max infiltrates the Tritech facility and defeats guards as well as a genetically engineered boss named Gekko. Then, she witnesses the cloaked figure kill a Tritech employee before capturing Sylan. Max continues her pursuit across a fortified bridge and a dockyard. Logan's research discovers Sylan is being held prisoner on a ship; Max enters the Marine Control Centre, the main headquarters of the I Corporation's offshore business operations, in order to learn which ship Sylan is on. Max boards the ship Stella Nova after learning that Sylan is aboard. Max rescues Sylan following a confrontation with an opponent disguised as her. Max discovers that her twin sister, Beka, was taken to the I Corporation headquarters years ago, and that an I Corporation scientist, Dr Stephen Van Der Mescht, knows more about her. Logan traces Van Der Mescht to a military train owned by I Corporation. Max breaks through security at the train yard and boards the train. She locates Van Der Mescht, who initially refuses to help her. After Max threatens him with torture, Van Der Mescht explains that I Corporation was a rival of Manticore, and had a military contract for more aggressive genetic research. They created a 'Y' series of genetically engineered soldiers (as opposed to Manticore's 'X' series); when Max and Beka were born, Beka was taken by I Corporation so that the two different series could be compared. I Corporation guards ambush the room, killing Van Der Mescht before he can divulge more. I Corporation send a single soldier, a transgenic boss named Bear, to kill Max. Bear is defeated, and Max reaches the I Corporation headquarters with the train. Max fights her way to the upper level of the headquarters, defeating guards and the boss characters Beetle, Gekko and Bear again, before she confronts Beka. Beka reveals that she now controls the I Corporation, and has engineered a younger replacement to succeed her using the DNA that she and Max shares. She tries to recruit Max to join her and their 'younger sister' in creating a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers. Max refuses and Beka attacks her. After killing Beka, Max tries to rescue her younger sister. The cloaked figure, whose identity is never revealed, tries unsuccessfully to stop her. Logan arrives in a helicopter and rescues Max and her younger sister from the complex. Later, while sitting on the roof of the Space Needle, Max laments that knowing the truth about Beka is worse than not knowing at all, but is determined to create a positive life for herself and her younger sister. A post-credits scene shows Max and Original Cindy dancing in their apartment. Development and release Dark Angel was announced in May 2002 at the E3 Expo, shortly after the TV series was canceled. It was reported the game would feature the likeness of characters from the show as well as the voices of Jessica Alba and Michael Weatherly, reprising the roles of Max Guevara and Logan Cale respectively. Fox Interactive producer Chris Miller said the game would \\"give consumers a chance to virtually play as Max in her next adventure to find her sister and fellow genetically engineered escapees.\\" It was developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Sierra Entertainment; it was released in North America on November 22, 2002. Due to the termination of the TV series, Radical Entertainment slashed the game's budget during development. The game contains an exclusive photo gallery of Jessica Alba, cast interviews and other bonus features. A trailer for the video game was included in the season one DVD of the Dark Angel TV series. Reception Dark Angel received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" on both platforms according to the review aggregator Metacritic. The game was frequently criticized for its unoriginality, repetition and problems with its stealth mode, though it received some praise for its graphics and voice acting, as well as its story and setting. Brett Todd of GameSpot criticized the stealth mode, noting many blind spots, problems with the camera angles and that enemies could be killed in plain view of each other without attracting their attention, concluding \\"Overall, sneaking around involves more pure chance than skill.\\" He considered the game's story and setting to be its one redeeming feature, saying it stayed faithful to the television series. Scott Alan Marriott of AllGame highlighted controls, camera angles and above average graphics as the game's strengths, although lamented its repetitive nature, \\"inconsistent level design and challenge\\" and lack of two-player support. Zach Meston of GameSpy criticized the game's ease, lack of strategy, and the fact that solutions to the game's 'puzzles' were clearly highlighted to the player. Miss Spell of GamePro praised the graphics, voice acting and hand-to-hand combat. However, the game's stealth mode was described as \\"comically maddening\\", and logical errors, such as Max's ability to jump seven feet-high despite her inability to climb over a knee high fence, were also discussed. The review concluded that it \\"isn't a bad game, but it's not a really good game either, it's caught somewhere in between, struggling for a clear identity.\\" Duke Ferris of Game Revolution said, \\"It's not that Dark Angel is brutally awful or full of bugs ... it's that it lacks any originality whatsoever. It's a boring, repetitive cookie-cutter game straight from the Nabisco ovens. You've eaten this cookie many times before; and if you're old enough, the first time it was called Streets of Rage.\\" References External links 2002 video games Beat 'em ups Cyberpunk video games Dark Angel (American TV series) Fox Interactive games 20th Century Fox video games PlayStation 2 games Radical Entertainment games Science fiction video games Sierra Entertainment games Video games based on television series Dark Angel Video games developed in Canada Video games featuring female protagonists Xbox games ","title":"James Cameron's Dark Angel"},{"id":"2957532","text":"Delray is the name of several communities in the United States of America: *Delray, Georgia *Delray, Detroit, Michigan *Delray, Texas *Delray, West Virginia *Delray Beach, Florida *Delray Gardens, Florida *Delray Shores, Florida ;See also * Battle of Molino del Rey, inspiration for the name Delray of Detroit, in turn inspiration for the name Delray Beach, Florida * Del Ray (disambiguation) * Del Rey (disambiguation) * Chevrolet Delray ","title":"Delray"},{"id":"2957533","text":"YDT may refer to: * Boundary Bay Airport near Vancouver, Canada * Yard Diving Tender, a type of diving support vessel * Yukon Daylight Time, no longer observed; see Yukon Time Zone ","title":"YDT"},{"id":"2957537","text":"Dream telepathy is the purported ability to communicate telepathically with another person while one is dreaming.Krippner, Stanley; Franasso, Cheryl. (2011). Dreams, Telepathy, and Various States of Consciousness. NeuroQuantology 9 (1): 4. The first person in modern times to document telepathic dreaming was Sigmund Freud. There is no scientific evidence that dream telepathy is a real phenomenon. Parapsychological experiments into dream telepathy have not produced replicable results.Hansel, C. E. M. (1989). The Search for Psychic Power: ESP and Parapsychology Revisited. Prometheus Books. pp. 141-152. In the 1940s it was the subject of the Eisenbud-Pederson-Krag- Fodor-Ellis controversy, named after the preeminent psychoanalysts of the time who were involved: Jule Eisenbud, Geraldine Pederson-Krag, Nandor Fodor, and Albert Ellis.Devereux, George, ed. (1953). \\"The Eisenbud-Pederson-Krag-Fodor- Ellis Controversy\\". In Psychoanalysis and the Occult. Oxford, England: International Universities Press.  History  The notion and speculation of communication via dreaming was first mooted in psychoanalysis by Sigmund Freud in 1921.Eshel, Ofra (December 2006). \\"Where are you, my beloved?: On absence, loss, and the enigma of telepathic dreams\\". The International Journal of Psychoanalysis 87 (6): 1603‚Äì1627. He produced a model to express his ideas about telepathic dreaming. His 1922 paper Dreams and Telepathy is reproduced in the book Psychoanalysis and the Occult (1953) and was intended to be a lecture to the Vienna Psycho-Analytical Society, although he never delivered it. Freud considered that a connection between telepathy and dreams could be neither proven nor disproven. He was distinctly suspicious of the whole idea, noting that he himself had never had a telepathic dream. (His two dreams that were potentially telepathic, where he dreamed of the deaths of a son and of a sister-in-law, which did not occur, he labeled as \\"purely subjective anticipations\\".) His ideas were not widely accepted at the time, but he continued to publicly express his interest and findings about telepathic dreaming. He also observed that he had not encountered any evidence of dream telepathy in his patients.Frieden, Ken (1990). Freud's dream of interpretation. SUNY series in modern Jewish literature and culture. SUNY Press. pp. 102-103. . Freud claims neutrality about the phenomenon itself, states that the sleep milieu has special likely properties for it if it does exist, and discounts all of the cases presented to him on standard psychoanalytic grounds (e.g. neurosis, transference, etc.).Freud, S. Collected Papers, V. IV pp 408-435 International Psychoanalytic Library No. 7, Ed 1, Basic Books 1959 \\"Have I given you the impression that I am secretly inclined to support the reality of telepathy in the occult sense? If so, I should very much regret that it is so difficult to avoid giving such an impression. In reality, however, I was anxious to be strictly impartial. I have every reason to be so, for I have no opinion; I know nothing about it.\\" p. 435. Here Freud explicitly refers to the conflation of telepathy as such with clairvoyance and other occult elements. In the 1940s Jule Eisenbud, Geraldine Pederson-Krag and Nandor Fodor described alleged cases of dream telepathy. Albert Ellis regarded their conclusions to have been based upon flimsy evidence, and thought that they could be better explained by bias, coincidence and unconscious cues than by dream telepathy. He also accused them of an emotional involvement in the notion, resulting in their observations and judgement being clouded.Ellis, Albert. (1947). Telepathy and Psychoanalysis: A Critique of Recent Findings. Psychiatric Quarterly 21: 607-659.Ellis, Albert. (1949). Re-analysis of an alleged telepathic dream. Psychiatric Quarterly: 23: 116-126. Psychologist L. B√∂rje L√∂fgren also criticised dream telepathy experiments of Eisenbud. He stated that coincidence was a more likely explanation and the \\"assumption of paranormal forces to explain them is unnecessary.\\"L√∂fgren, L. B. (1968). Recent Publications on Parapsychology. Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association 16: 146-178. Experiments Montague Ullman was notable for conducting dream telepathy experiments. His results were never replicated.Wiseman, Richard. (2014). Night School: Wake Up to the Power of Sleep. Macmillan. p. 202. Wiseman writes regarding Krippner and Ullman's experiments \\"Over the years, many researchers have failed to replicate their remarkable findings and, as a result, the work is seen as curious but not proof of the paranormal.\\" There have been many experiments done to test the validity of dream telepathy and its effectiveness, but with significant issues of blinding. Many test subjects find ways to communicate with others to make it look like telepathic communication. Attempts to cut off communication between the agent, sender, and receiver of information failed because subjects found ways to get around blindfolds no matter how intricate and covering they were.McBroom, Patricia. (1967). Dreams, Art and Mental Telepathy. Science News 92: 424. In studies at the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York led by Stanley Krippner and Montague Ullman, patients were monitored and awakened after a period of REM then separated to study the claimed ability to communicate telepathically. They concluded the results from some of their experiments supported dream telepathy. The picture target experiments that were conducted by Krippner and Ullman were criticized by C. E. M. Hansel. According to Hansel there were weaknesses in the design of the experiments in the way in which the agent became aware of their target picture. Only the agent should have known the target and no other person until the judging of targets had been completed; however, an experimenter was with the agent when the target envelope was opened. Hansel also wrote there had been poor controls in the experiment as the main experimenter could communicate with the subject.Hansel, C. E. M. The Search for a Demonstration of ESP. In Paul Kurtz. (1985). A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology. Prometheus Books. pp. 97-127. An attempt to replicate the experiments that used picture targets was carried out by Edward Belvedere and David Foulkes. The finding was that neither the subject nor the judges matched the targets with dreams above chance level.Belvedere, E., Foulkes, D. (1971). Telepathy and Dreams: A Failure to Replicate. Perceptual and Motor Skills 33: 783‚Äì789. Results from other experiments by Belvedere and Foulkes were also negative. In 2003, Simon Sherwood and Chris Roe wrote a review that claimed support for dream telepathy at Maimonides.Sherwood, S. J; Roe, C. A. (2003). A Review of Dream ESP Studies Conducted Since the Maimonides Dream ESP Programme. Journal of Consciousness Studies, 10: 85-109. However, James Alcock noted that their review was based on \\"extreme messiness\\" of data. Alcock concluded the dream telepathy experiments at Maimonides have failed to provide evidence for telepathy and \\"lack of replication is rampant.\\"Alcock, James. (2003). Give the Null Hypothesis a Chance: Reasons to Remain Doubtful about the Existence of Psi. Journal of Consciousness Studies 10: 29-50. \\"In their article, Sherwood and Roe examine attempts to replicate the well-known Maimonides dream studies that began in the 1960s. They provide a good review of these studies of dream telepathy and clairvoyance, but if one thing emerges for me from their review, it is the extreme messiness of the data adduced. Lack of replication is rampant. While one would normally expect that continuing scientific scrutiny of a phenomenon should lead to stronger effect sizes as one learns more about the subject matter and refines the methodology, this is apparently not the case with this research.\\" The psychologist and noted skeptic Richard Wiseman took part in a dream telepathy experiment. It was conducted by Caroline Watt at a sleep laboratory in an attempt to replicate the results of Krippner and Ullman. The experiment was a complete failure. According to Wiseman, \\"after monitoring about twenty volunteers for several nights on end, the study didn't discover any evidence in support of the supernatural.\\"Wiseman, Richard. (2014).

The treaty followed the earlier Treaty of Utrecht of 11 April 1713, which ended hostilities between France and Spain, on the one hand, and Britain and the Dutch Republic, on the other hand. A third treaty at Baden, Switzerland was required to end the hostilities between France and the Holy Roman Empire. By 1713, all parties to the War of the Spanish Succession were militarily depleted and it was unlikely that the continuation of the conflict would bring about any results in the foreseeable future. The First Congress of Rastatt opened in November 1713, between France and Austria, with the negotiations culminating in the Treaty of Rastatt on 7 March 1714, formally ending hostilities and complementing the Treaty of Utrecht, which had been signed the previous year. The Treaty of Rastatt was negotiated by Marshal of France, Claude Louis Hector de Villars and the Austrian prince, Prince Eugene of Savoy. The Rastatt Treaty is associated with changes in European politics, associated with the shift to the balance of power politics. Background Austria began to negotiate the treaty with France after it had been abandoned by its allies, particularly Great Britain, during negotiations for the Treaty of Utrecht. Great Britain feared a possible connection of Austria and Spain in the person of the Emperor Charles VI, who became emperor in 1711 and claimed the Spanish throne, as it would shift the balance of power politics in Europe to Habsburg Austria. In June 1713, France launched the Rhine campaign against the Holy Roman Empire, conquering Kaiserslautern, Landau and Breisgau. After these defeats, Emperor Charles VI accepted the offer of King Louis XIV of France to reopen negotiations. Territorial changes Under the treaty, Austria received the following from Spain: the Spanish territories in Italy of Naples, Milan, Sardinia and the Southern Netherlands. Austria received from France Freiburg and several other small areas at its eastern borders, but France retained Landau. As a result of the treaty, the Austrian Habsburg Empire reached the largest territorial extent in its history. It became a major power in Western and southern Europe, in addition to its already dominant influence in Central Europe. Moreover, bargaining in Rastatt gained for Austria much more than it was offered at Utrecht, at which it had originally also participated. However, Emperor Charles VI was outraged at the loss of Spain and considered it an unacceptable failure. For France, the Utrecht and Rastatt Treaties confirmed the throne of Spain for the House of Bourbon, but also denied France the additional territorial gains it had sought, and affirmed that the thrones of France and Spain could not be united.

Life and career  Ryskind was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Ida (Edelson) and Abraham Ryskind.http://library.alibris.com/I-Shot-an-Elephant-in-My-Pajamas-The- Morrie-Ryskind-Story-Morrie-Ryskind/book/3079662?matches=9 He attended Columbia University but was suspended shortly before he was due to graduate after he called university president Nicholas Murray Butler \\"Czar Nicholas\\" in the pages of the humor magazine Jester in 1917. Ryskind was criticizing Butler for refusing to allow Count Nikolai Tolstoy, the nephew of Leo Tolstoy, speak on campus.Ryskind, Morrie, and Roberts, John H. M., I Shot an Elephant in My Pajamas: the Morrie Ryskind Story, 1994, Huntington House (hereafter, \\"Ryskind, Pajamas\\"), pp.34-36. From 1927 to 1945, Ryskind was author of numerous scripts and musical lyrics for Broadway theatrical productions and Hollywood motion pictures and later directed a number of such productions as well. He collaborated with George S. Kaufman on several Broadway hits. In 1933, he earned the Pulitzer Prize (receiving the prize from the same Nicholas Murray Butler who had suspended him from Columbia University) for Drama for the Broadway production Of Thee I Sing, a musical written in collaboration with composer George Gershwin.Ryskind, Pajamas, p.88, 99. Ryskind wrote or co- wrote several Marx Brothers theatrical and motion picture screenplays, including the book for the Broadway musical Animal Crackers (1929) (with Kaufman), and he wrote the screenplays for the film versions of The Cocoanuts (1929) and Animal Crackers (1930). Later he co-wrote, again with Kaufman, the screenplay for A Night at the Opera (1935), which helped revive interest in the Marx Brothers and was selected by the American Film Institute as among the top 100 comedy films ever made. In working on that script, Ryskind was heavily involved in the \\"cleanup process,\\" watching the Brothers repeatedly perform sections of the play before live audiences to determine which lines worked and which did not. In an interview with Richard J. Anobile in The Marx Brothers Scrapbook, Groucho said he was so appalled by an early draft of the script, which was reportedly written by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, that he screamed, \\"Why fuck around with second-rate talent, get Kaufman and Ryskind [to write the screenplay]!\\" Ryskind also rewrote the stage version of Room Service (1938), the original of which did not have the Marx Brothers, reworking the plot to make the movie suitable for the three distinctive performers.Ryskind, Pajamas, pp.101-117. During that period, Ryskind was also twice nominated for an Academy Award for his part in writing the films My Man Godfrey (starring Carole Lombard, 1936) and Stage Door (starring Katharine Hepburn, 1937). Later, he wrote the screenplay for the successful Penny Serenade, wrote the stage musical Louisiana Purchase (which soon became a film starring Bob Hope) and supervised the production of The Lady Comes Across.Ryskind, Pajamas, pp.119-141. = Political activism = For many years Ryskind had been a member of the Socialist Party of America, and during the 1930s he participated in party-sponsored activities, even performing sketches at antiwar events, but he split with the party's \\"Old Guard faction,\\" led by Louis Waldman. His politics soon moved to the right. In 1940, Ryskind abandoned the Democratic Party, and he opposed President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's pursuit of a third term, writing the campaign song for that year's Republican Party presidential nominee, Wendell Willkie.Ryskind, Pajamas, pp.169-171. He maintained some ties to the Socialist Party throughout the 1940s and served as a Vice Chairman of the Keep America Out of War Congress. Around then, he became a friend to writers Max Eastman,Diggins, John, Up From Communism, Harper & Row, 1975, pp. 201-233; Ryskind, Pajamas, p.184; and, O'Neill, William L., The Last Romantic: a Life of Max Eastman, 1991, Transaction Ayn Rand,Burns, Jennifer, Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right, 2009, Oxford Univ.

Later, he would become friend to William F. Buckley, Jr. and future US President Ronald Reagan.Ryskind, Pajamas, p.178, pp.206-208. In 1947, he appeared before the House Committee on Un-American Activities as a \\"Friendly Witness.\\" Ryskind never sold another script after that appearance, and he believed that his appearance before HUAC was responsible although there is no direct evidence of an organized campaign against the \\"Friendly Witnesses.\\"Ryskind, Pajamas, pp.165-166. In the 1950s, Ryskind contributed articles to the early free market publication The Freeman,Chamberlain, John, A Life With the Printed Word, p.138. In 1954, was also a board member of the American Jewish League Against Communism. Later, he lent money to Buckley to help start The National Review,Ryskind, Pajamas, pp.183-184. which began publication in 1955, another journal to which he was an early contributor. Ryskind briefly joined the John Birch Society but soon disassociated himself from the group after it began to claim that Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and Dwight Eisenhower were part of the Soviet conspiracy.Ryskind, Pajamas, pp.198-199. He was also a vocal sympathizer with the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism. In 1960, Ryskind started to write a feature column in the Los Angeles Times that promoted conservative ideas for the next eleven years. His son, Allan H. Ryskind, was the longtime editor of the conservative Washington, DC, weekly Human Events.Ryskind, Pajamas, pp.186-187. The elder Ryskind's autobiography, I Shot an Elephant in My Pajamas: The Morrie Ryskind Story, details his adventures from Broadway to Hollywood as well as his conversion to conservative politics.

The system, which must be activated by the service line umpire before each serve, projects five or six infra-red horizontal beams of light along the court 10 mm above the ground. One beam covers the good (short) side of the service line and others cover the fault (long) side.

Obvious long serves that go beyond Cyclops' beams are called by the service line umpire. The system is tuned before and during each tournament by a representative of the company which rents the system.

Reception  The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly contended that the game is a worthy Zelda clone, with Ed Semrad and Sushi-X going so far as to say it is equally good as the Zelda series. They identified the story and Zelda-like play mechanics as the game's strongest points, and gave the game a 7.75 out of 10. Scary Larry of GamePro viewed the game as the Genesis's answer to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, and remarked that \\"While Zelda had tons of hidden surprises, weapons, and fearsome bosses (making it one of the best action/RPGs ever), Crusader of Centy has a too-familiar story line, minor enemies, and a serious shortage of puzzles.\\" He nonetheless concluded that though Crusader of Centy would bore the average RPG gamer, it successfully appeals to its young target audience.

He started in the clock business in 1807, working for clockmaker Eli Terry. Thomas formed a clock-making partnership in Plymouth, Connecticut with Eli Terry and Silas Hoadley as Terry, Thomas & Hoadley. In 1810, he bought Terry's clock business, making tall clocks with wooden movements, though he chose to sell his partnership in 1812, moving in 1813 to Plymouth Hollow, Connecticut, where he set up a factory to make metal-movement clocks. In 1817, he added shelf and mantel clocks. By the mid-1840s, he changed over to brass from wooden movements. He made the clock that is used in Fireman's Hall. He died in 1859, whereupon the company was taken over by his son, Aaron, who added many styles and improvements after his father's death. The company went out of business in the 1980s.

It is located in Besan√ßon, France. In the past, the Besan√ßon Observatory participated in assessing and rating Swiss timepiece movements for accuracy. As marine navigation adopted the usage of mechanical timepieces for navigational aid, the accuracy of such timepieces became more critical. From this need developed an accuracy testing regime involving various astronomical observatories. In Europe, the Neuchatel Observatory, Geneva Observatory, Besan√ßon Observatory and Kew Observatory were examples of prominent observatories that tested timepiece movements for accuracy. The testing process lasted for many days, typically 45 days. Each movement was tested in 5 positions and 2 temperatures, in 10 series of 4 or 5 days each. The tolerances for error were much finer than any other standard, including the ISO 3159 chronometer standard that other testing bodies such as COSC use. Movements that passed the stringent tests were issued a certification from the observatory called a Bulletin de Marche, signed by the Director of the Observatory. The General Bulletin Order stated the testing criteria, and the actual performance of the movement. A movement with a bulletin from an observatory became known as an Observatory Chronometer, and such were issued a chronometer reference number by the Observatory. The role of the observatories in assessing the accuracy of mechanical timepieces was instrumental in driving the mechanical watchmaking industry toward higher and higher levels of accuracy. As a result, today high quality mechanical watch movements have an extremely high degree of accuracy. However, no mechanical movement could ultimately compare to the accuracy of the quartz movements being developed. Accordingly, such chronometer certification ceased in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the advent of the quartz watch movement.

During the battle, the Imperial Japanese Army extensively used chemical weapons. The purpose of the Japanese offensive was not to hold the city, but to maintain pressure on the Chinese National Revolutionary Army to reduce their combat ability in the region, and their ability to reinforce the Burma Campaign. The Japanese were initially successful in their offensive operation through bacteria infected bombing and capturing parts of the city of Changde forcing civilians to evacuate beforehand. However, they were pinned down in the city by a single Chinese division long enough for other Chinese units to surround them with a counter- encirclement. Heavy casualties and the loss of their supply lines then forced the Japanese to withdraw, returning territorial control to the original status quo. Some contemporary Western newspapers depicted the battle as a Chinese victory. American government film footage showed victorious Chinese troops with Japanese prisoners and captured Japanese flags and equipment on display after the battle. In addition, an American newsreel titled \\"Chinese troops drive Japs from Changteh\\" showed Chinese troops firing, with dead and captured Japanese on display. A British newsreel titled \\"Japs Loose Changteh Aka Japs Lose Changte' showed similar footage. Battle =Japanese offensive= On 2 November 1943 Isamu Yokoyama, commander of the Imperial Japanese 11th Army, deployed the 39th, 58th, 13th, 3rd, 116th and 68th divisions‚Äîa total of around 60,000 troops‚Äîto attack Changde from the north and the east. The Changde region was defended by the Chinese 6th War Zone's 10th, 26th, 29th and 33rd Army Groups, as well as a river defense force and two other corps, for a total of 14 corps. On 14 November the Japanese 13th Division, with aid from collaborators, drove south and broke through the defensive lines of the Chinese 10th and the 29th Group Armies. On 16 November, Japanese airborne forces landed in Taoyuan County to support the assault on the city proper. At the same time, the Japanese 3rd and 116th Divisions also joined the combined assault. The city was guarded by only a single Chinese division - the 74th Corps' 57th Division. Division commander Yu Chengwan led his single division of 8,000 men to fight against the two invading Japanese divisions. Despite being outnumbered by more than three to one, the Chinese stubbornly held onto the city. Eleven days and nights of fierce fighting saw heavy casualties on both sides. When the Chinese reinforcements finally arrived in the city, they managed to evacuate the remaining 100 survivors in the 57th Division, all of whom were wounded, from the city. On 6 December the city of Changde fell to the Japanese control. While the Chinese 57th Division pinned down the Japanese in the city, the rest of the 74th Corps, as well as the 18th, 73rd, 79th and 100th Corps and the 9th War Zone's 10th Corps, 99th Corps and Jiangxi's 58th Corps, arrived at the battlefield, forming a counter-encirclement on the Japanese forces. =Chinese counter-offensive= Fang Xianjue's 10th Corps was first to strike, successfully retaking Deshan on 29 November before attacking the Japanese positions at Changde from the south. Unable to withstand the fierce Chinese assault, the Japanese utilized chemical weapons. The battle lasted for six days and nights, during which the Chinese Reserve 10th Division's commander Lieutenant General Sun Mingjin(:zh:Â≠ôÊòéÁëæ) received 5 gunshot wounds to the body and was killed in action. At this time other Chinese units were also pressing onto the Japanese positions. On 11 December Chinese reinforcements broke through the Japanese lines and into the city, which resulted in intense house-to-house fighting. The Chinese then proceeded to cut the Japanese supply lines. Depleted of food and ammunition, the Japanese retreated on 13 December. The Chinese pursued them for more than 20 days. By 5 January 1944 Japanese forces had withdrawn to their original positions before the offensive. Following the battle, the Chinese displayed an array of captured Japanese weapons and equipment, as well as numerous Japanese troops taken as prisoners, for inspection by allied military observers. During this campaign, apart from the Reserve 10th Division's Sun Mingjin, two other Chinese division commanders were killed: the 44th Corps' 150th Division's Lieutenant General Xu Guozhang(:zh:ËÆ∏ÂõΩÁíã) was killed at Taifushan in Changde's northwest, aged 37, while the 73rd corps' 5th Division's Lieutenant General Peng Shiliang(:zh:ÂΩ≠Â£´Èáè) was killed at the Taoyuan-Shimen line, aged 38.

Although Mary spends much of her time at St. Francis resenting the authority of the Mother Superior and puzzling over why any woman would choose the life of a nun, as time goes on she is touched by examples of the sisters' dedication, devotion, kindness, love, and generosity, and begins to see that their life is one of fulfillment, not deprivation. Mary receives \\"the call\\" senior year and, after graduation, remains at the school to begin her novitiate in the order.

While in the memoir the school was portrayed as a boarding school outside the city, Trahey attended what is now Providence-St. Mel's High School, which was a day school. Many of the incidents mentioned in the book were based on Trahey's experiences at Mundelein College in Chicago.

Heide was purchased in 1934 by John and Sunday Reed, passionate supporters and collectors of Australian art and culture. Amongst other activities, John Reed published the modernist literary magazine Angry Penguins, which earned its place in Australia's cultural history with the notorious Ern Malley hoax in 1943. John Reed was a Tasmanian- born solicitor, graduate of Cambridge University in 1924. whose association with art and design begun in Melbourne in the mid 1920s, when he shared a home with illustrator and furniture designer Fred Ward. Around him were a circle of highly innovative and creative young and wealthy Melbournians including his sister Cynthia Reed Nolan, psychiatrist Reg Ellery, musicians Mansell Kirby and Bernard Heinze, curator Clarice Zander, artist Will Dyson and literary patrons Nettie Palmer and Vance Palmer, establishing a pattern that would extend into the years at Heide. A number of modernist artists came to live and work at various times through the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s at Heide, and as such it became the place where many of the most famous works of the period were painted. Albert Tucker, Sidney Nolan, Danila Vassilieff and Joy Hester, amongst others, all worked at Heide, Nolan painting his famous series of Ned Kelly works in the living room there. The Heide Circle is well known for the intertwined personal and professional lives of the people involved. Sunday Reed conducted affairs with a number of them, with the knowledge of her husband. Sydney Nolan's second wife Cynthia Reed Nolan was John Reed's younger sister The marriage of former Heide associates caused a permanent break between Nolan and Sunday Reed. David Rainey‚Äôs 2014 play The M√©nage at Soria Moria is a fictitious performance piece exploring the relationship between the Reeds and Sidney Nolan ‚Äì both the heady days at Heide during the 1940s, and the less well known degeneration over the next 35 years. The Heide Circle continued in their commitment to Figurative Modernism through the 1950s and 1960s, with several of the artists forming the Antipodeans Group and taking a stand against the new abstract art. Heide is located very close to Heidelberg, the area associated with a famous earlier Melbourne art movement, the Heidelberg School. The north-eastern fringes of Melbourne, particularly further out at Eltham, retain a close association with the visual arts. The Heide Museum of Modern Art is now an art museum featuring most of the artists of the period, and actively supporting the development and promotion of contemporary art in Australia.

It acts as a non-depolarizing competitive antagonist at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, is short-acting, and is given intravenously. Effects Trimetaphan is a sulfonium compound and therefore carries a positive charge. Being charged, it cannot cross lipid cell membranes, such as those that comprise the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Due to this, trimethaphan does not have any effect on the central nervous system. The ciliary muscle of the eye functions to round the lens for accommodation and is controlled mainly by parasympathetic system input. With administration of a ganglion-blocking drug, the ciliary muscle cannot contract (cycloplegia) and the patient loses the ability to focus their eyes. Trimetaphan has a strong effect on the cardiovascular system. The size of blood vessels is primarily controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. Loss of sympathetic system input to the blood vessels causes them to get larger (vasodilation) which has the effect of lowering blood pressure. Postural hypotension is a common side effect of such drugs. Trimethaphan causes a histamine release which further lowers blood pressure. Effects on the heart include a decreased force of contraction and an increase in heart rate (tachycardia). Reflexive tachycardia can be diminished or undetected because trimetaphan is also blocking the sympathetic ganglia innervating the heart. The motility of the gastrointestinal tract is regulated by the parasympathetic system, and blockage of this input results in diminished motility and constipation. A rare side effect of trimethaphan administration is sudden respiratory arrest. The mechanism behind it is unknown, as trimethaphan does not appear to block neuromuscular transmission, and respiratory arrest is not an expected consequence of ganglionic blockage. Therapeutic uses The therapeutic uses of trimetaphan are very limited due to the competition from newer drugs that are more selective in their actions and effects produced. It is occasionally used to treat a hypertensive crisis and dissecting aortic aneurysm, to treat pulmonary edema, and to reduce bleeding during neurosurgery.

She was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1971 to 1985 who represented the east Toronto riding of Scarborough East. She served as a cabinet minister in the government of William Davis. She was the first female cabinet minister in Ontario. Background Birch was born in Leamington, Ontario, and was educated in the area. She was chair of the Scarborough Board of Health from 1963 to 1971, was on the Mental Health Council from 1967 to 1971, and was vice-chairman of the Social Planning Council from 1967 to 1970.

Politics Birch ran for Scarborough council, ward 6 in 1962. She came in 3rd behind winner F.D. Cummings. She was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1971 provincial election, defeating incumbent Liberal Tim Reid by 670 votes in Scarborough East. She was re-elected in 1975, 1977 and 1981. On September 28, 1972, she was appointed to cabinet as a Minister without portfolio responsible for youth. This made her the first woman to be appointed to an Ontario cabinet. Birch was promoted to Provincial Secretary for Social Development on February 26, 1974. In July 1983, she resigned from cabinet and assumed the role of Parliamentary assistant to Premier Bill Davis in charge of the 1984 Ontario Bicentennial celebration. Birch had wanted to leave office in 1981 but was persuaded by Davis to stay on. In 1974, Birch became involved in policy discussions about child care. A series of recommendations were announced which became known as the Birch Proposals. The initiative was driven by cost reduction and they would have increased the child/adult ratio in day cares, decreased standards in staff qualifications and training, and reduced fire and safety regulations. The proposals were criticized by both non-profit and for profit day care associations for different reasons. The government eventually shelved the recommendations. The Social Development secretariat was designed as a \\"super-ministry\\", overseeing several different ministries and agencies (e.g., health, social services, education, women's secretariat, youth secretariat, etc.). As such, the 'super minister' had direct authority over the funding, policies and directions of the individual ministries under its jurisdiction and worked to coordinate policies and programs that previously conflicted across disparate ministries but with somewhat related responsibilities (e.g., health and home care, and social services and home care). As such, it had few specifically defined responsibilities beyond the coordination function.

L. Mencken (1880‚Äì1956), a renowned Baltimore journalist, satirist, and social critic of the American scene. Rhetorically his piece uses Juvenalian satire to lampoon the industrial blight of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania, the nation's leading industrial district in the 1920s. Mencken writes from the point of view of a passenger on an east-bound express train of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Specifically, the speaker is scanning the landscape between Pittsburgh's East Liberty station and Greensburg, declaiming an endemic ugliness in architecture and poverty and nature. This industrial ugliness, he claims, is shameful and in contrast to the quaint charm of Europe's poor and rural villages. His curmudgeonly conclusion about American industrialization is \\"out of the melting pot emerges a race which hates beauty.\\" \\"The Libido for the Ugly\\" was first published in 1926 as a column in the Baltimore Evening Sun and next in Mencken's book Prejudices: Sixth Series (New York: Alfred A.

Copenhagen and Skoal are the company's leading brands, and each represents more than $1 billion per year in retail sales. It also sells similar products, for a lower price, under the brand names Red Seal and Husky. It also produced Rooster until 2009, when Philip Morris decided to discontinue it. The company also produces several varieties of dry snuff. Skoal was one of the first moist tobacco manufacturers to offer dipping tobacco in pouches. Skoal Bandits, released in 1983, were marketed in the UK in the 1980s, but the carcinogenic tobacco pouches were banned amid public protest. This product has a small amount of tobacco in a pouch with a thin outer membrane and resembles a tiny tea bag. Skoal Bandits were invented by UST's marketing division, the manufacturing process was conceived by Gene Paules of UST, and the process was automated by David Westerman of the Automation Center, Inc., Nashville, Tennessee. Since then, Skoal has kept the Skoal Bandits products, but has also released regular-sized pouches, as well as snus, and offers pouches under the Copenhagen brand, as well.

He was Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals from 1985 to 1992. Wachtler's most famous quote, made shortly after his appointment as Chief Judge, was that district attorneys could get grand juries to \\"indict a ham sandwich.\\" He achieved national notoriety when he was charged with, and then convicted of, acts stemming from threats he made against a former lover, Joy Silverman, and her daughter. Upon conviction, Wachtler served thirteen months in prison and a half-way house. After his release, Wachtler became an author and critic, as well as an advocate for the mentally ill. Early life and education Wachtler was born in Brooklyn, New York but was mostly raised in the South due to the fact that his father, Phillip, was a traveling salesman. His mother, Faye, was an immigrant from Russia. Wachtler graduated with both a B.A. and an LL.B. from Washington and Lee University. He served in the United States Army before moving to Great Neck, Long Island, near his wife's family, where he worked as an attorney. Career He began his political career in 1963, when he was first elected to be a councilman, then Town Supervisor of the Town of North Hempstead, New York. In 1968 - after a failed bid for Nassau County executive - Republican Governor Nelson Rockefeller appointed him to the New York State Supreme Court. In 1972, he was elected to the New York Court of Appeals where he served for nearly 20 years and authored close to 400 opinions. In January 1985, Democratic Governor Mario Cuomo appointed him Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals. The same month as his appointment, Wachtler was quoted by the New York Daily News as saying that \\"district attorneys now have so much influence on grand juries that 'by and large' they could get them to 'indict a ham sandwich.'\\" This quote was then used by Tom Wolfe (and attributed to Wachtler) in Wolfe's 1987 novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, paraphrased into \\"a grand jury would 'indict a ham sandwich,' if that's what you wanted.\\" As of 2018, the \\"ham sandwich\\" phrase remains in common usage in legal discussions. Wachtler's 1975 decision in Chapadeau v. Utica ObserverChapadeau v. Utica Observer, 38 N.Y. 2d 196, 341 N.E. 2d 569 (1975) protected the right of the defendant newspaper (and by extension of the press in general) to cover issues of public concern without undue exposure to suits for libel. The reasoning of the Chapadeau decision was influential with courts throughout the United States. Also known for the remark, \\"A marriage license should not be viewed as a license for a husband to forcibly rape his wife with impunity\\" (in People v. Liberta), Wachtler was a key figure in making spousal rape a criminal offense. Wachtler wrote the majority opinion in a 1988 right to die case interpreting the statute's requirement of \\"clear and convincing evidence\\" that a person who can no longer communicate would have wanted to die in a particular circumstance. The majority opinion set a stricter standard of \\"clear and convincing\\" than the lower courts, and refused to let a patient's family withdraw life support. General statements by a person that he or she would not want to live in such a condition are not acceptable under the decision.New York's Highest Court Rejects Family's Plea in Right-to-Die Case By E. R. SHIPP, New York Times, October 15, 1988Excerpts From the Court of Appeals Decision on a Patient's Right to Die New York Times, October 15, 1988 The decision was criticized by right-to-die organizations as being too strict and unworkable, and taking decision-making away from family members. Wachtler was criticized for writing the decision while his own 86-year-old mother was recovering from a stroke.New York Rule Compounds Dilemma Over Life Support By LISA BELKIN, New York Times, May 12, 1992 His formulation of this higher standard of proof was later adopted by the United States Supreme Court. As Chief Judge, Wachtler served not only as the head of the Court of Appeals, but also as the chief administrator for the state court system. He made significant administrative changes, called for the merit selection of judges, implemented streamlined procedures, reduced opportunities for \\"judge shopping,\\" and reformed the state's grand jury system. Wachtler also tried to improve women's and minorities' access to justice. He created a New York State Judicial Commission for Minority Concerns, a Workforce Diversity Program, and a New York State Task Force on Gender Bias. Criminal charges and resignation In 1988, Wachtler began an affair with Joy Silverman. At the time, Wachtler was a co- executor of the estate of Alvin Wolosoff, Silverman's stepfather and the uncle of Wachtler's wife. He was also trustee of four trusts stemming from Wolosoff's estate for the benefit of Silverman and her family. The trusts (in aggregate) were reported to be worth US$24 million at the time. According to then-United States Attorney Michael Chertoff, over time, Wachtler received fees of more than US$800,000 for his work as executor and trustee of the entire estate. After Silverman ended the affair in September 1991, Wachtler began to harass her. Wachtler was arrested on 7 November 1992, on charges including extortion, racketeering, and blackmail.Plotz, David. \\"Judicial Restraint: Sol Wachtler's worthy sentiments on prison.\\" Slate.com April 16, 1997 Prosecutors alleged that he demanded a $20,000 blackmail payment in exchange for turning over compromising photographs and tapes of Silverman with her then boyfriend, attorney David Samson.New York Times: \\"As Inquiry Widens, Port Authority Chief May Lose His Low Profile\\" by Russ Buettner and William K. Rashbaum January 15, 2014 He eventually pleaded guilty to harassing Silverman and threatening to kidnap her daughter. He resigned as a judge and from the bar, and Governor Mario Cuomo appointed Judith S. Kaye to replace him as chief judge of the N.Y.S. Court of Appeals. He served his sentence, first at the medium-security Federal Correctional Institution in Butner, North Carolina, and from December 1993 at the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota after he was stabbed in the shoulder while dozing in his cell in November. Wachtler was sentenced to 15 months, but received time off for good behavior. His sentence started 28 September 1993. He was released after serving 13 months. Later life After his release from prison, Wachtler wrote a prison memoir, After the Madness () and a book of fiction, Blood Brothers (). He also contributed to the book Serving Mentally Ill Defendants () and has written as a critic-at-large for The New Yorker Magazine. He is currently an Adjunct Professor at Touro Law School and Chair of the Law and Psychiatry Institute of North Shore Long Island Jewish Hospital. He is an advocate for the mentally ill and has received awards from the Mental Health Association of the State of New York and New York City.

It is sometimes also known as a \\"Marman ring\\". It consists of a circular strap with an interior V-shaped groove. Tension is applied to the strap with a threaded bolt and nuts connecting to the ends of the strap. As the tension increases, the V-groove wedges over flanges on the circular parts to be assembled, providing the force that holds the ends of the two cylinders together. The Marman clamp is an alternative to a bolted flange connection which would be heavier and require more labor to connect.

Spacecraft separation  Marman clamps are used extensively in spaceflight systems and are common mechanical load-transfer and clamping mechanisms for connecting the upper stage and the satellite payload of space vehicles, for example, on the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer on the Cassini orbiter. They may also be used to join stages of a booster rocket. Early separation systems using Marman clamps used explosive bolts for release. These have problems of unpredictability, the need to contain debris and difficulties in testing them. A more recent approach uses a screw thread. The tension of the clamp band itself is used to power the unscrewing of a central bolt, when released by a NASA Standard Initiator (NSI), a pyrotechnic pin puller.  History  The Marman clamp was first produced by Herbert Marx, better known by his stage name of Zeppo Marx;Chandler, Charlotte.

On the radio, he hosts The Big Show with Bill Cunningham, heard weekdays on AM 700 WLW in Cincinnati, and Live on Sunday Night, it's Bill Cunningham, a program syndicated nationally by Premiere Radio Networks. (Both WLW and Premiere Networks are subsidiaries of iHeartMedia, Inc.) On television he hosted The Bill Cunningham Show that aired for an hour on weekdays on The CW. He is also a commentator/contributor for Fox News Channel. Cunningham has won the National Association of Broadcasters Marconi Award for Large-Market Personality of the Year twice, in 2001 and in 2009. He has also provoked controversy that led to Cunningham being named \\"one of the most prolific purveyors of hate speech\\" by Media Matters, a left-wing media watchdog group.http://www.wlwt.com/article/700-wlw-s-bill-cunningham-called-purveyor- of-hate-speech/3498713  Law  Cunningham was admitted to the Ohio Bar in 1975 after graduating from the University of Toledo College of Law. Cunningham did a stint as a staff attorney with the Legal Aid Society of Cincinnati- Public Defender Division.G. David Yaros, Senior Trial Counsel/Supervising Attorney Legal Aid Society of Cincinnati-Public Defender Division 1974-78. He then served in the office of the Ohio Attorney General as Assistant Attorney General from 1978 to 1986 under Attorneys General William J. Brown and Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr. Currently, Cunningham works in the law firm of Steven R. Adams, which specializes in criminal defense and DUI cases.  Radio  Cunningham has been on 50,000-watt radio station 700 WLW for over 30 years, beginning in 1983. His first regular show on the station was at night, generally from 9:00 p.m. until midnight. His show was not heard during the summer months, when WLW broadcasts Cincinnati Reds baseball games. In the late 1990s, Cunningham's show was moved to early afternoons, which put his show directly opposite that of one of his favorite radio presenters, Rush Limbaugh, whose show is heard on sister station WKRC. Cunningham's WLW show went on a brief hiatus in June 2010 due to a contract dispute. Soon after, WLW's owner, Clear Channel, announced that he signed a long-term agreement to stay with the station. In released remarks commenting on his decision, Cunningham said, \\"Cincinnati is my home. The first air I breathed. The first milk I drank was from Cincinnati. Others may have come as carpetbaggers to loot the Queen City and then move on. Willie will remain true.\\" = Controversies = In December 2003, Cunningham created a parody song mocking Nathaniel Jones, a man killed by Cincinnati police, with lyrics including: \\"The fat man ever after has a martyr's place/ Let's all ignore whatever drugs he had...His death was unrelated to his injuries but still we hear the people sing police brutality/ lies go on bro la la how the lies go on.\\" On February 26, 2008, Cunningham created controversy in his warm-up speech introducing Republican presidential candidate John McCain at a Cincinnati rally because Cunningham twice referred to Democratic candidate Barack Obama with Obama's full name, Barack Hussein Obama and called Obama a \\"hack Chicago-style Daley politician\\". McCain immediately repudiated Cunningham after being told about Cunningham's remarks. In response, Cunningham said in an interview with CNN following the rally: \\"John McCain threw me under a bus... I've had it up to here with John McCain. I'm joining Ann Coulter in supporting Hillary Clinton.\\" Cunningham would continue to be a sharp critic of Obama; on his October 28, 2008 WLW show, Cunningham discussed the life of Obama's father Barack Obama, Sr. and then remarked, \\"... his father was a typical black father who, right after the birth, left the baby. That's what black fathers do. They simply leave.\\" This remark has been cited as an example of hyperbolic, extreme rhetoric on talk radio.Bobbitt, Randy. Us Against Them: The Political Culture of Talk Radio. Lanham, Maryland: Lexington Books. p. 141. Another Cunningham statement that has been criticized was his claim on the January 4, 2009, WLW show that poor people \\"lack values, ethics and morals.\\" These statements, also including comparisons between Obama and Hitler and suggesting that Obama wanted to murder Jews the way Hitler did, led to Cunningham being named \\"one of the most prolific purveyors of hate speech\\" by a media watchdog group. = The Stooge Report = A popular part of his radio show is known as \\"The Stooge Report,\\" which begins with a clip of the Three Stooges harmonizing the word \\"hello\\" and Moe saying \\"quiet numbskulls, I'm broadcasting.\\" This segment has Cunningham riffing on current events in a humorous way, often joined by sports talk host Bill \\"Seg\\" Dennison and anyone else in the studio. It lasts about 15 minutes and ends when Bill says, \\"Segman, get me out of The Stooge Report.\\" at which point Seg Dennison responds, \\"Willie, in honor of [insert a topic covered in today's Stooge Report], I leave you with the immortal words of the Stoooooooooge Report.\\" This occurs two times a show, after the 1:30 and 2:30 newscasts.  Television  Cunningham logo The Bill Cunningham Show, a first- run syndicated television talk show hosted by Cunningham debuted on September 19, 2011. Cunningham served as the show's co-producer. It was produced and distributed by Tribune Broadcasting and at first aired only on Tribune-owned stations, stations owned by Local TV, LLC and Raycom Media-owned WXIX-TV in Cunningham's hometown of Cincinnati,\\"New Season, New Timeslots\\" from The Cincinnati Enquirer (August 31, 2011) prior to making a nationwide launch. It moved to The CW beginning September 10, 2012, where it was seen nationally. The series used a tabloid-style format with a conservative approach.\\"'The Bill Cunningham Show' a go for Tribune Broadcasting\\" from RBR/TVBR (July 28, 2010) The program is produced in New York City, with co-production from ITV Studios America.\\"'Bill Cunningham Show' enters syndication\\" from Variety (May 16, 2011) Cunningham does his radio show from New York City on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays because he tapes his TV show on those days. On May 27, 2016, Cunningham announced that he mutually agreed to cancel his own talk show, which ended on September 9, 2016. Personal life Born in Covington, Kentucky, Cunningham grew up in Deer Park, Ohio, and graduated from Deer Park High School in 1966. Cunningham was one of four children and has described his father as an abusive alcoholic who left the family when Cunningham was 11 and his other siblings were 13, nine and four (he has an older brother and a younger brother and sister). Before his mother's death in 2010, he frequently called her on the air during his radio show; he referred to her as \\"Ma.\\" At Deer Park High, Cunningham played on the basketball team and was the top scorer among all Cincinnati area high school basketball players his senior year. The Cincinnati Enquirer named him one of the top 100 Cincinnati-area high school basketball players in history. Cunningham later earned degrees from Xavier University, where he played for four years on the baseball team, serving as captain, and the University of Toledo College of Law. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Judge Penelope R. Cunningham of the Ohio District Courts of Appeals. They have one son and two grandchildren. On March 12, 2019, Cunningham announced on radio he would need to have Aortic Valve Replacement in the coming weeks.

Typically quinine fluoresces blue, visible in the right sample. The left sample contains chloride ions which quench quinine's fluorescence, so the left sample does not fluoresce visibly (the violet light is just scattered laser light). Quenching refers to any process which decreases the fluorescence intensity of a given substance. A variety of processes can result in quenching, such as excited state reactions, energy transfer, complex-formation and collisional quenching. As a consequence, quenching is often heavily dependent on pressure and temperature. Molecular oxygen, iodide ions and acrylamide are common chemical quenchers. The chloride ion is a well known quencher for quinine fluorescence. Quenching poses a problem for non-instant spectroscopic methods, such as laser-induced fluorescence. Quenching is made use of in optode sensors; for instance the quenching effect of oxygen on certain ruthenium complexes allows the measurement of oxygen saturation in solution. Quenching is the basis for F√∂rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays. Quenching and dequenching upon interaction with a specific molecular biological target is the basis for activatable optical contrast agents for molecular imaging. Many dyes undergo self-quenching, which can decrease the brightness of protein-dye conjugates for fluorescence microscopy, or can be harnessed in sensors of proteolysis.  Mechanisms  Donor emission and quencher absorption spectral overlap =F√∂rster resonance energy transfer= There are a few distinct mechanisms by which energy can be transferred non-radiatively (without absorption or emission of photons) between two dyes, a donor and an acceptor. F√∂rster resonance energy transfer (FRET or FET) is a dynamic quenching mechanism because energy transfer occurs while the donor is in the excited state. FRET is based on classical dipole-dipole interactions between the transition dipoles of the donor and acceptor and is extremely dependent on the donor- acceptor distance, R, falling off at a rate of 1/R6. FRET also depends on the donor-acceptor spectral overlap (see figure) and the relative orientation of the donor and acceptor transition dipole moments. FRET can typically occur over distances up to 100 √Ö. =Dexter electron transfer= Dexter (also known as Dexter exchange or collisional energy transfer, colloquially known as Dexter Energy Transfer) is another dynamic quenching mechanism. Dexter electron transfer is a short-range phenomenon that falls off exponentially with distance (proportional to e‚àíkR where k is a constant that depends on the inverse of the van der Waals radius of the atom) and depends on spatial overlap of donor and quencher molecular orbitals. In most donor- fluorophore‚Äìquencher-acceptor situations, the F√∂rster mechanism is more important than the Dexter mechanism. With both F√∂rster and Dexter energy transfer, the shapes of the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the dyes are unchanged. Dexter electron transfer can be significant between the dye and the solvent especially when hydrogen bonds are formed between them. =Exciplex= Exciplex (excited state complex) formation is a third dynamic quenching mechanism.Comparison of static and dynamic quenching mechanisms =Static quenching= The remaining energy transfer mechanism is static quenching (also referred to as contact quenching). Static quenching can be a dominant mechanism for some reporter-quencher probes. Unlike dynamic quenching, static quenching occurs when the molecules form a complex in the ground state, i.e. before excitation occurs. The complex has its own unique properties, such as being nonfluorescent and having a unique absorption spectrum. Dye aggregation is often due to hydrophobic effects‚Äîthe dye molecules stack together to minimize contact with water. Planar aromatic dyes that are matched for association through hydrophobic forces can enhance static quenching. High temperatures and addition of surfactants tend to disrupt ground state complex formation. = Collisional quenching = An important quenching process in atmospheric physics can be seen in the altitudinal variation of auroral emissions. At high altitudes (above ~200 km), the red 630.0 nm emission of atomic oxygen dominates, whereas at altitudes in the E-layer the green 557.7 nm emission is more intense. Both practically disappear at altitudes below 100 km. This variation occurs due to the unusually long lifetimes of the excited states of atomic oxygen, with 0.7 seconds for the 557.7 nm and almost two minutes for the 630.0 nm emission (both forbidden transitions). The mean collision-free paths decrease at lower altitudes due to increasing particle densities, which results in the de- excitation of the oxygen atoms due to the higher probability of collisions, preventing the emission of the red and green oxygen lines.

The name originated as an anglicization of the Swedish \\"tallolja\\" (\\"pine oil\\"). Tall oil is the third largest chemical by-product in a Kraft mill after lignin and hemicellulose; the yield of crude tall oil from the process is in the range of 30‚Äì50 kg / ton pulp. It may contribute to 1.0‚Äì1.5% of the mill's revenue if not used internally. Manufacturing Forchem tall oil refinery in Rauma, Finland. In the Kraft Process, high alkalinity and temperature converts the esters and carboxylic acids in rosin into soluble sodium soaps of lignin, rosin, and fatty acids. The spent cooking liquor is called weak black liquor and is about 15% dry content. The black liquor is concentrated in a multiple effect evaporator and after the first stage the black liquor is about 20‚Äì30%. At this stage it is called intermediate liquor. Normally the soaps start to float in the storage tank for the weak or intermediate liquors and are skimmed off and collected. A good soap skimming operation reduces the soap content of the black liquor down to 0.2‚Äì0.4% w/w of the dry residue. The collected soap is called raw rosin soap or rosinate. The raw rosin soap is then allowed to settle or is centrifuged to release as much as possible of the entrained black liquor. The soap goes then to the acidulator where it is heated and acidified with sulfuric acid to produce crude tall oil (CTO). The soap skimming and acidulator operation can be improved by addition of flocculants. A flocculant will shorten the separation time and give a cleaner soap with lower viscosity. This makes the acidulator run smoother as well. Most pines give a soap yield of 5‚Äì25 kg/ton pulp, while Scots pine gives 20‚Äì50 kg/ton. Scots pine grown in northern Scandinavia give a yield of even more than 50 kg/ton. Globally about 2 mill ton/year of CTO are refined. Composition The composition of crude tall oil varies a great deal, depending on the type of wood used. A common quality measure for tall oil is acid number. With pure pines it is possible to have acid numbers in the range 160‚Äì165, while mills using a mix of softwoods and hardwoods might give acid numbers in the range of 125‚Äì135. Normally crude tall oil contains rosins, which contains resin acids (mainly abietic acid and its isomers), fatty acids (mainly palmitic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid) and fatty alcohols, unsaponifiable sterols (5‚Äì10%), some sterols, and other alkyl hydrocarbon derivates. By fractional distillation tall oil rosin is obtained, with rosin content reduced to 10‚Äì35%. By further reduction of the rosin content to 1‚Äì10%, tall oil fatty acid (TOFA) can be obtained, which is cheap, consists mostly of oleic acid, and is a source of volatile fatty acids. Applications The tall oil rosin finds use as a component of adhesives, rubbers, and inks, and as an emulsifier. The pitch is used as a binder in cement, an adhesive, and an emulsifier for asphalt. TOFA is a low-cost and vegetarian lifestyle-friendly alternative to tallow fatty acids for production of soaps and lubricants. When esterified with pentaerythritol, it is used as a compound of adhesives and oil-based varnishes. When reacted with amines, polyamidoamines are produced which may be used as epoxy resin curing agents . Tall oil is also used in oil drilling as a component of drilling fluids.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party from 1963 to 1985 and was a cabinet minister in the governments of John Robarts and William Davis. There is also a school in Scarborough,Ontario named after him. Background Wells was born in Toronto and educated at Victoria College and the University of Toronto. Wells and William Davis played on the University of Toronto's football team at the same time and were both members of the campus Progressive Conservative association. Wells worked as advertising manager for the Canadian Medical Association from 1960 to 1967. He also served on the Scarborough Board of Education from 1957 to 1963, was its chair in 1961-62, and held a concurrent position on the Metropolitan Toronto School Board in 1962-63. Politics Wells was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1963 provincial election, winning a comfortable victory in Scarborough North. Wells served as a backbench supported for three years, and was named a minister without portfolio on November 24, 1966. He was re-elected with a reduced majority in the 1967 election, defeating New Democratic Party candidate John Brewin by 1,527 votes. Wells was promoted to Minister of Health on August 13, 1969, and was responsible for introducing Medicare to the province. In 1971, he was the only member of the Robarts cabinet to support Allan Lawrence's bid to succeed Robarts as Progressive Conservative Party leader and premier of Ontario. Lawrence lost to William Davis on the last ballot, by forty-four votes. When Davis succeeded Robarts as Premier of Ontario on March 1, 1971, he named Wells as his Minister of Social and Family Services. Wells was re- elected again in the 1971 election, defeating Brewin for a second time by a greatly increased margin. He was promoted to Minister of Education on February 2, 1972. Shortly after his appointment, Wells permitted Ontario schoolchildren to watch the final game of the 1972 \\"Summit Series\\" ice hockey tournament between Canada and the Soviet Union from their classrooms. He defeated Liberal challenger Gerry Phillips by 2,677 votes in the 1975 election, and was returned by a greater majority again in 1977. On August 16, 1978, Davis appointed Wells as his Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. He was also appointed as Government House Leader in 1979. Both Wells and Davis were prominent supporters of Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau's plans to repatriate the Canadian Constitution, and were active in the negotiations that led to its adoption in 1982. Wells was re-elected with the largest plurality of his career in the 1981 election. =Cabinet positions= After politics On January 17, 1985, Davis appointed Wells as Ontario's agent- general in London, UK. Because of this appointment, he remained neutral in the Progressive Conservative Party's February 1985 leadership convention. He remained as agent-general until 1992, and then returned to Toronto. In 1992, he led Toronto's unsuccessful bid to host Expo '98. Wells died of cancer at Toronto's North York General Hospital in October 2000. Legacy On February 23, 2005 the Toronto District School Board passed a motion moved by Scarborough-Rouge River School Trustee Noah Ng supported by the local school community to name the first school constructed by the Toronto District School Board after Thomas Leonard Wells. Thomas L. Wells Public School opened its doors for Junior Kindergarten to Grade Eight students on September 6, 2005. The school itself was honoured with an award in December 2005 by Canadian Architect Magazine. A street within the Heathwood Community in Scarborough near the intersection of Birchmount Road and Sanwood Boulevard has been named after Thomas Leonard Wells.

Adams compares the sickness affecting various coastal cities in 1797 to the dispensations of the Tribulation. He called upon the Congress to pass public health laws to prevent the spread of disease through interstate commerce. He also suggests the establishment of \\"a system which, while it may tend to preserve the general health, may be compatible with the interests of commerce and the safety of the revenue.\\" Adams attributes the subsidence of disease to the Divine Providence of the Supreme Being. He notes the enthusiasm and nationalism of Americans in dealing with foreign aggression; notably from France by sea and Spain by land through illegal garrisons in the southern U.S. frontiers. John Adams portrait by John Trumbull. French aggression Adams begins his address by solemnly expressing his doubts concerning negotiations in Paris, accusing France of insincerity. In 1796 the French Directory rejected Charles Cotesworth Pinckney as the United States Minister Plenipotentiary to France. The Directory passed a decree in January 1797 allowing the \\"capture and condemnation neutral vessels and their cargoes if any portion of the latter are of British fabric or produce,\\" essentially justifying the already institutionalized impressment of American sailors by the French Navy in international waters. Adams refers to the decree as an, \\"unequivocal act of war on the commerce of the nations it attacks,\\" and states that if the U.S. has the means it can \\"reconcile nothing with their interest and honor but a firm resistance.\\" Adams expresses a need to invigorate and extend the U.S. measure of defense, alluding to the United States Navy, in light of French conduct. Adams parallels his pugnacious comments by confirming his desire for an amicable end to hostilities and insistence that preparation for war is the only way to insure peace. Another ambassador will not be sent to France without, \\"more determinate assurances that he would be received,\\" because his rejection would be an, \\"act of humiliation.\\" Before Adams is willing to restore formal relations, France must end depredations and pay reparations for past grievances, \\"heretofore inflicted on our commerce.\\" The necessity of maritime protection through a navy is formally expressed and exalted through the statements, \\"no country ever experienced more sudden and remarkable advantages from any measure of policy than we have derived from the arming for our maritime protection and defense,\\" and \\"We ought...to...increase of our Navy to a size sufficient to guard our coast and protect our trade.\\" Demarcation of Spanish‚ÄìAmerican border The illegal Spanish garrisons in the Natchez and Walnut Hills, mentioned in Adams' previous address, have been evacuated. Two commissioners, one from the United States and one from Spain, outline the 31st degree of north latitude, the border between the United States and Spain. Southern Indians, most likely Natchez, are preventing official demarcation of the border, either for personal reasons or through clandestine Spanish encouragement. Adams decides that maintaining a commissioner in remote areas of the nation is not worth the cost and states that the commissioner should be recalled.

Like many 18th century Spanish warships she was named after a saint (John of Nepomuk). She was a solidly built ship of proven seaworthy qualities. Captured by the British Royal Navy during the Battle of Trafalgar, the ship was renamed first HMS Berwick, then HMS San Juan. The ship was discarded in 1816. Design and description Her sister ships were San Pascual, San Francisco de Asis, San Lorenzo, Santo Domingo and . She was originally fitted with a total of 74 cannons: 28 24-pounders, 30 18-pounders, 8 12-pounders and 8 8-pounders, and was manned by 8 officers, 11 midshipmen, 19 leading seamen and 492 able seamen (530 total). Her supply capacity was for 60 days victuals and 80 days water. Service history In 1793, she took part in the Anglo-Spanish occupation of Toulon under the command of Admiral Don Juan de L√°ngara. Four years later, in 1797, she was part of a Spanish fleet under Teniente General Jos√© de C√≥rdoba y Ramos that fought against the British at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent. =Battle of Trafalgar= Death of Cosme de Churruca, by Eugenio √Ålvarez Dumont, Museo del Prado The Battle of Trafalgar is the historical feat in which she participated and of which we have the best account. In spite of being dismasted by Admiral Nelson's artillery on 21 October 1805, she achieved glory in this battle under the command of the commander Don Cosme Damian Churruca and constituted for the Spaniards a handsome example of the heroism of their nation and the bravery of their sailors. San Juan Nepomuceno was one of the last ships still fighting after most of the French ships had surrendered and most of the Spanish ships had either been captured or had yielded. The commander, Don Cosme Churruca, had previously ordered for the flag to be nailed to the highest mast. At the time, it was commonplace for ships to signal surrender by lowering their nation's flag. 'Nailing the flag' was a way to tell the enemy, allies, and indeed the ship's own crew and officers not to expect an easy surrender. As the hours passed Churruca, whose leg had been torn off by a cannonball, the deck of his ship covered by the blood of his wounded and dead seamen, continued to stubbornly order his ship's batteries to fire. Mortally wounded, the Basque-born Churruca prohibited his officers from surrendering and ordered them to continue returning fire whilst he remained breathing. His officers kept their word, even after Churruca died and command of the ship had been passed to the second-in-command, Francisco de Moyna, who continued the fight until he himself was killed. He was replaced by the next officer in command who also refused to surrender. However, unable to break the circle of fire formed by the six enemy ships, including Defiance, Tonnant and Dreadnought, and in order to prevent the ship from sinking with all the wounded trapped below, the last officer left alive in San Juan Nepomuceno yielded with over 400 dead and injured on board. Cosme Dami√°n de Churruca y Elorza =Royal Navy service= After Trafalgar, the ship was taken into British service and briefly renamed HMS Berwick before adopting the name HMS San Juan. In honour of Churruca's courage, the cabin he had occupied while alive bore his name on a brass plate, and all who entered it were required to remove their hats as a mark of respect for a gallant enemy. She initially served as a base hulk at Gibraltar from 1805 to 1808 before being recommissioned in September 1808 as a prison ship under Commander John Gourly. During the Peninsular War San Juan was fitted to act as flagship to a flotilla of gunboats based in Gibraltar. For this task she was re-rated as a sloop and placed under the command of Commander Thomas Vivion, who was the first flotilla commander, taking post in 1810. He was followed subsequently by Commander James Tillard who took command in 1812. There were a total of fourteen lieutenants under his command, each of whom took charge of one of the gunboats in the flotilla. As the gunboats had little capacity for accommodation, the lieutenants were assigned to, and lived aboard San Juan. In later service San Juan acted as flagship to the admirals appointed as Commander-in-Chief Gibraltar. In 1813 she was flagship to Rear Admiral Samuel Hood Linzee with Captain John Fraser acting as flag captain. In 1814 she was flagship to Rear Admiral Charles Elphinstone Fleeming with Captain Gardiner Henry Guion acting as flag captain. Her final commission began in October 1814 when she reverted to her original role as a base hulk under the command of Lieutenant Charles M'Kenzie. San Juan was finally paid off and sold at Gibraltar on 8 January 1816. Sources & references * John D.

The Graduate School of Education specializes in teacher training and education research. Location The Graduate School of Education is located in Berkeley Way West in Downtown Berkeley, after previously occupying the east wing of Tolman Hall, located in the northwest area of the UC Berkeley campus. Tolman Hall was deemed seismically unfit and is slated for demolition. The Graduate School of Education shares the Berkeley Way West building with the UC Berkeley School of Public Health and the Department of Psychology. History The Graduate School of Education traces its roots back to 1889, when the Regents of the University of California announced ‚Äúthe intention‚Ä¶to establish a course of instruction in the science and art of teaching.‚Äù In subsequent years, the B.A. in Education would be offered by the University of California, Berkeley College of Letters and Science in 1892, followed by the establishment of the Department of Education (which would be included as a unit of the Graduate Division) in 1900. In 1913, UC Regents would establish the School of Education, with educator Alexis F. Lange presiding as the school's first dean. Tolman Hall, longtime and former home of the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Education Over the next few decades, Doctoral, Master's, and Credential programs would develop, along with an outgrowth of other notable research initiatives, programs, fellowships, and institutes. Among these programs and institutes, came the establishment of the National Writing Project (NWP), which was founded in 1974 as the Bay Area Writing Project (BAWP). Programs The school has Master's Degree and Ph.D. programs which are contained within three Areas of Study (with the exception of LEEP, which is a schoolwide program) and grouped by Degree and Credential objectives. All four Credential programs include an M.A. degree. All graduate programs stress the integration of theory with practical application. Researchers and classroom professionals work together to develop solutions to the grand challenges in education that require collaborative efforts across disciplines. =Other programs and academic units= *Leaders for Equity and Democracy (LEAD)https://gse.berkeley.edu/lead *The Graduate Group in Science and Mathematics Education (SESAME) *Undergraduate Minor in Education *Undergraduate Minor in Interdisciplinary Studies in Early Childhood *UC Berkeley Summer Session * Academic Talent Development Program (ATDP)http://atdp.berkeley.edu/ * College and Career Academy Support Network (CCASN)http://casn.berkeley.edu Tuition Tuition varies based on program.

Before 1975, the monarch used to preside over meetings of the Council of State. The King-in-Council or the Queen-in-Council, depending on the gender of the reigning monarch, is a constitutional term in a number of states. In a general sense, it would mean the monarch exercising executive authority, usually in the form of approving orders, in the presence of the country's executive council. Norway In Norway, the \\"King in Council\\" () refers to the meetings of the King and the Council of State (the Cabinet), where matters of importance and major decisions are made. The council meets at the Royal Palace and is normally held every Friday. It is chaired by the king or, if he is ill or abroad, the crown prince. In Norway's Constitution, when formulated as King in Council (Kongen i Statsr√•d) refers to the formal Government of Norway. When the formulation is merely King, the appointed ministry that the law refers to may alone act with complete authority of the matter assigned in the particular law. A decision that is taken in the State Council under the King's leadership is a royal decree. If the crown prince chairs, they are crown prince resolutions. When neither the king nor the crown prince chairs, resolutions adopted are called Government resolutions. Sweden In Sweden, the King in Council (), more commonly known as Royal Majesty, ( or the short forms () or () was a concept of constitutional importance in Sweden until 1974. Royal Majesty was the commonly used term to refer to the supreme executive authority under the 1809 Instrument of Government, where the king made all decisions of state in the presence of his cabinet ministers. The 1974 Instrument of Government removed the monarch from all exercise of formal political powers which were passed to the newly created Government (), chaired and led in all aspects by the prime minister. The Commonwealth The Queen- in-Council is the technical term of constitutional law for the exercise of executive authority in a Commonwealth realm, denoting the monarch acting by and with the advice and consent of his or her privy council (in the United Kingdom and Canada's federal jurisdiction) or executive council (in most other Commonwealth realms, Australian states, and in Canadian provinces). In those realms and dependencies where the queen's powers and functions are delegated to a governor-general, lieutenant governor, or governor, the term Governor- General-in-Council, Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, or Governor-in-Council may be used instead of Queen-in-Council, respectively, although all of these terms describe the same technical process within constitutional law. \\"The government of [jurisdiction]\\" is commonly used as a synonym for any of the aforementioned terms, though the phrase may mean more than one thing in certain areas. An order made by the Queen-in-Council is known as an Order-in-Council and such actions are subject to judicial review. Orders-in-Council may be used to implement secondary legislation such as UK statutory instruments. In practice, decisions made by the Queen-in-Council are almost always the formal approval to decisions made by the cabinet, a subcommittee of the privy or executive council that includes the senior ministers of the Crown and often meets without the queen or her local representative present.

Furthermore, the technology is concerned with the creation of artificial animals or artificial people (or, at least, artificial creatures; see Artificial life) so the discipline is of considerable interest to philosophers. These factors contributed to the emergence of the philosophy of artificial intelligence. Some scholars argue that the AI community's dismissal of philosophy is detrimental. The philosophy of artificial intelligence attempts to answer such questions as follows: define the philosophy of AI as consisting of the first two questions, and the additional question of the ethics of artificial intelligence. writes \\"In the current literature, philosophy has two chief roles: to determine whether or not such machines would be conscious, and, second, to predict whether or not such machines are possible.\\" The last question bears on the first two. * Can a machine act intelligently? Can it solve any problem that a person would solve by thinking? * Are human intelligence and machine intelligence the same? Is the human brain essentially a computer? * Can a machine have a mind, mental states, and consciousness in the same sense that a human being can? Can it feel how things are? Questions like these reflect the divergent interests of AI researchers, cognitive scientists and philosophers respectively. The scientific answers to these questions depend on the definition of \\"intelligence\\" and \\"consciousness\\" and exactly which \\"machines\\" are under discussion. Important propositions in the philosophy of AI include: *Turing's \\"polite convention\\": If a machine behaves as intelligently as a human being, then it is as intelligent as a human being.This is a paraphrase of the essential point of the Turing test. , , , * The Dartmouth proposal: \\"Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.\\". This assertion was printed in the program for the Dartmouth Conference of 1956, widely considered the \\"birth of AI.\\"also * Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon's physical symbol system hypothesis: \\"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\\" and * John Searle's strong AI hypothesis: \\"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\\"This version is from , and is also quoted in . Searle's original formulation was \\"The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states.\\" . Strong AI is defined similarly by : \\"The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis.\\" * Hobbes' mechanism: \\"For 'reason' ... is nothing but 'reckoning,' that is adding and subtracting, of the consequences of general names agreed upon for the 'marking' and 'signifying' of our thoughts...\\" Can a machine display general intelligence? Is it possible to create a machine that can solve all the problems humans solve using their intelligence? This question defines the scope of what machines could do in the future and guides the direction of AI research. It only concerns the behavior of machines and ignores the issues of interest to psychologists, cognitive scientists and philosophers; to answer this question, it does not matter whether a machine is really thinking (as a person thinks) or is just acting like it is thinking.See , where they make the distinction between acting rationally and being rational, and define AI as the study of the former. The basic position of most AI researchers is summed up in this statement, which appeared in the proposal for the Dartmouth workshop of 1956: * \\"Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.\\" Arguments against the basic premise must show that building a working AI system is impossible, because there is some practical limit to the abilities of computers or that there is some special quality of the human mind that is necessary for intelligent behavior and yet cannot be duplicated by a machine (or by the methods of current AI research). Arguments in favor of the basic premise must show that such a system is possible. It is also possible to sidestep the connection between the two parts of the above proposal. For instance, machine learning, beginning with Turing's child machine proposal essentially achieves the desired feature of intelligence without a precise design-time description as to how it would exactly work. The account on robot tacit knowledge eliminates the need for a precise description all together. The first step to answering the question is to clearly define \\"intelligence\\". =Intelligence= The \\"standard interpretation\\" of the Turing test. Turing test Alan Turing and see , where they call his paper \\"famous\\" and write \\"Turing examined a wide variety of possible objections to the possibility of intelligent machines, including virtually all of those that have been raised in the half century since his paper appeared.\\" reduced the problem of defining intelligence to a simple question about conversation. He suggests that: if a machine can answer any question put to it, using the same words that an ordinary person would, then we may call that machine intelligent. A modern version of his experimental design would use an online chat room, where one of the participants is a real person and one of the participants is a computer program. The program passes the test if no one can tell which of the two participants is human. Turing notes that no one (except philosophers) ever asks the question \\"can people think?\\" He writes \\"instead of arguing continually over this point, it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks\\". under \\"The Argument from Consciousness\\" Turing's test extends this polite convention to machines: * If a machine acts as intelligently as a human being, then it is as intelligent as a human being. One criticism of the Turing test is that it only measures the \\"humanness\\" of the machine's behavior, rather than the \\"intelligence\\" of the behavior. Since human behavior and intelligent behavior are not exactly the same thing, the test fails to measure intelligence. Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig write that \\"aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as 'making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons'\\". Intelligent agent definition Simple reflex agent Twenty- first century AI research defines intelligence in terms of intelligent agents. An \\"agent\\" is something which perceives and acts in an environment. A \\"performance measure\\" defines what counts as success for the agent. * \\"If an agent acts so as to maximize the expected value of a performance measure based on past experience and knowledge then it is intelligent.\\"Russell and Norvig would prefer the word \\"rational\\" to \\"intelligent\\". Definitions like this one try to capture the essence of intelligence. They have the advantage that, unlike the Turing test, they do not also test for unintelligent human traits such as making typing mistakes or the ability to be insulted. They have the disadvantage that they can fail to differentiate between \\"things that think\\" and \\"things that do not\\". By this definition, even a thermostat has a rudimentary intelligence. consider a thermostat a simple form of intelligent agent, known as a reflex agent. For an in-depth treatment of the role of the thermostat in philosophy see \\"4. Is Experience Ubiquitous?\\" subsections What is it like to be a thermostat?, Whither panpsychism?, and Constraining the double-aspect principle. =Arguments that a machine can display general intelligence= The brain can be simulated An MRI scan of a normal adult human brain Hubert Dreyfus describes this argument as claiming that \\"if the nervous system obeys the laws of physics and chemistry, which we have every reason to suppose it does, then .... we ... ought to be able to reproduce the behavior of the nervous system with some physical device\\". This argument, first introduced as early as 1943 and vividly described by Hans Moravec in 1988, is now associated with futurist Ray Kurzweil, who estimates that computer power will be sufficient for a complete brain simulation by the year 2029.. Also see and . The most extreme form of this argument (the brain replacement scenario) was put forward by Clark Glymour in the mid-1970s and was touched on by Zenon Pylyshyn and John Searle in 1980 A non-real-time simulation of a thalamocortical model that has the size of the human brain (1011 neurons) was performed in 2005 and it took 50 days to simulate 1 second of brain dynamics on a cluster of 27 processors. Few disagree that a brain simulation is possible in theory, even critics of AI such as Hubert Dreyfus and John Searle.Hubert Dreyfus writes: \\"In general, by accepting the fundamental assumptions that the nervous system is part of the physical world and that all physical processes can be described in a mathematical formalism which can, in turn, be manipulated by a digital computer, one can arrive at the strong claim that the behavior which results from human 'information processing,' whether directly formalizable or not, can always be indirectly reproduced on a digital machine.\\" . John Searle writes: \\"Could a man made machine think? Assuming it possible produce artificially a machine with a nervous system, ... the answer to the question seems to be obviously, yes ... Could a digital computer think? If by 'digital computer' you mean anything at all that has a level of description where it can be correctly described as the instantiation of a computer program, then again the answer is, of course, yes, since we are the instantiations of any number of computer programs, and we can think.\\" However, Searle points out that, in principle, anything can be simulated by a computer; thus, bringing the definition to its breaking point leads to the conclusion that any process at all can technically be considered \\"computation\\". \\"What we wanted to know is what distinguishes the mind from thermostats and livers,\\" he writes. Thus, merely mimicking the functioning of a brain would in itself be an admission of ignorance regarding intelligence and the nature of the mind . Human thinking is symbol processing In 1963, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon proposed that \\"symbol manipulation\\" was the essence of both human and machine intelligence. They wrote: * \\"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\\" This claim is very strong: it implies both that human thinking is a kind of symbol manipulation (because a symbol system is necessary for intelligence) and that machines can be intelligent (because a symbol system is sufficient for intelligence).Searle writes \\"I like the straight forwardness of the claim.\\" Another version of this position was described by philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, who called it \\"the psychological assumption\\": * \\"The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules.\\" The \\"symbols\\" that Newell, Simon and Dreyfus discussed were word-like and high level symbols that directly correspond with objects in the world, such as and . Most AI programs written between 1956 and 1990 used this kind of symbol. Modern AI, based on statistics and mathematical optimization, does not use the high-level \\"symbol processing\\" that Newell and Simon discussed. Arguments against symbol processing These arguments show that human thinking does not consist (solely) of high level symbol manipulation. They do not show that artificial intelligence is impossible, only that more than symbol processing is required. =G√∂delian anti-mechanist arguments= In 1931, Kurt G√∂del proved with an incompleteness theorem that it is always possible to construct a \\"G√∂del statement\\" that a given consistent formal system of logic (such as a high- level symbol manipulation program) could not prove. Despite being a true statement, the constructed G√∂del statement is unprovable in the given system. (The truth of the constructed G√∂del statement is contingent on the consistency of the given system; applying the same process to a subtly inconsistent system will appear to succeed, but will actually yield a false \\"G√∂del statement\\" instead.) More speculatively, G√∂del conjectured that the human mind can correctly eventually determine the truth or falsity of any well-grounded mathematical statement (including any possible G√∂del statement), and that therefore the human mind's power is not reducible to a mechanism.G√∂del, Kurt, 1951, Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their implications in Solomon Feferman, ed., 1995. Collected works / Kurt G√∂del, Vol. III. Oxford University Press: 304-23. - In this lecture, G√∂del uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction: (a) the human mind is not a consistent finite machine, or (b) there exist Diophantine equations for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist. G√∂del finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a \\"certain fact\\". Philosopher John Lucas (since 1961) and Roger Penrose (since 1989) have championed this philosophical anti-mechanist argument., , G√∂delian anti- mechanist arguments tend to rely on the innocuous-seeming claim that a system of human mathematicians (or some idealization of human mathematicians) is both consistent (completely free of error) and believes fully in its own consistency (and can make all logical inferences that follow from its own consistency, including belief in its G√∂del statement) . This is provably impossible for a Turing machine (and, by an informal extension, any known type of mechanical computer) to do; therefore, the G√∂delian concludes that human reasoning is too powerful to be captured in a machine . However, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent; that any consistent \\"idealized version\\" H of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counter-intuitive open-minded skepticism about the consistency of H (otherwise H is provably inconsistent); and that G√∂del's theorems do not lead to any valid argument that humans have mathematical reasoning capabilities beyond what a machine could ever duplicate.Mark Colyvan. An introduction to the philosophy of mathematics. Cambridge University Press, 2012. From 2.2.2, 'Philosophical significance of G√∂del's incompleteness results': \\"The accepted wisdom (with which I concur) is that the Lucas-Penrose arguments fail.\\" This consensus that G√∂delian anti-mechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in Artificial Intelligence: \\"any attempt to utilize (G√∂del's incompleteness results) to attack the computationalist thesis is bound to be illegitimate, since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis.\\"LaForte, G., Hayes, P. J., Ford, K. M. 1998. Why G√∂del's theorem cannot refute computationalism. Artificial Intelligence, 104:265-286, 1998. More pragmatically, Russell and Norvig note that G√∂del's argument only applies to what can theoretically be proved, given an infinite amount of memory and time. In practice, real machines (including humans) have finite resources and will have difficulty proving many theorems. It is not necessary to prove everything in order to be intelligent . They point out that real machines with finite memory can be modeled using propositional logic, which is formally decidable, and G√∂del's argument does not apply to them at all. Less formally, Douglas Hofstadter, in his Pulitzer prize winning book G√∂del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, states that these \\"G√∂del-statements\\" always refer to the system itself, drawing an analogy to the way the Epimenides paradox uses statements that refer to themselves, such as \\"this statement is false\\" or \\"I am lying\\". But, of course, the Epimenides paradox applies to anything that makes statements, whether they are machines or humans, even Lucas himself. Consider: * Lucas can't assert the truth of this statement.According to , this statement was first proposed by C. H. Whiteley This statement is true but cannot be asserted by Lucas. This shows that Lucas himself is subject to the same limits that he describes for machines, as are all people, and so Lucas's argument is pointless., , under \\"The Argument from Mathematics\\" where he writes \\"although it is established that there are limitations to the powers of any particular machine, it has only been stated, without sort of proof, that no such limitations apply to the human intellect.\\" After concluding that human reasoning is non-computable, Penrose went on to controversially speculate that some kind of hypothetical non-computable processes involving the collapse of quantum mechanical states give humans a special advantage over existing computers. Existing quantum computers are only capable of reducing the complexity of Turing computable tasks and are still restricted to tasks within the scope of Turing machines. . By Penrose and Lucas's arguments, existing quantum computers are not sufficient , so Penrose seeks for some other process involving new physics, for instance quantum gravity which might manifest new physics at the scale of the Planck mass via spontaneous quantum collapse of the wave function. These states, he suggested, occur both within neurons and also spanning more than one neuron. However, other scientists point out that there is no plausible organic mechanism in the brain for harnessing any sort of quantum computation, and furthermore that the timescale of quantum decoherence seems too fast to influence neuron firing. =Dreyfus: the primacy of implicit skills= Hubert Dreyfus argued that human intelligence and expertise depended primarily on implicit skill rather than explicit symbolic manipulation, and argued that these skills would never be captured in formal rules., , . See also , and Dreyfus's argument had been anticipated by Turing in his 1950 paper Computing machinery and intelligence, where he had classified this as the \\"argument from the informality of behavior.\\" Turing argued in response that, just because we do not know the rules that govern a complex behavior, this does not mean that no such rules exist. He wrote: \\"we cannot so easily convince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour ... The only way we know of for finding such laws is scientific observation, and we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'We have searched enough. There are no such laws.'\\" under \\"(8) The Argument from the Informality of Behavior\\" Russell and Norvig point out that, in the years since Dreyfus published his critique, progress has been made towards discovering the \\"rules\\" that govern unconscious reasoning. The situated movement in robotics research attempts to capture our unconscious skills at perception and attention.See and Computational intelligence paradigms, such as neural nets, evolutionary algorithms and so on are mostly directed at simulated unconscious reasoning and learning. Statistical approaches to AI can make predictions which approach the accuracy of human intuitive guesses. Research into commonsense knowledge has focused on reproducing the \\"background\\" or context of knowledge. In fact, AI research in general has moved away from high level symbol manipulation, towards new models that are intended to capture more of our unconscious reasoning. Historian and AI researcher Daniel Crevier wrote that \\"time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier.\\" Can a machine have a mind, consciousness, and mental states? This is a philosophical question, related to the problem of other minds and the hard problem of consciousness. The question revolves around a position defined by John Searle as \\"strong AI\\": * A physical symbol system can have a mind and mental states. Searle distinguished this position from what he called \\"weak AI\\": * A physical symbol system can act intelligently. Searle introduced the terms to isolate strong AI from weak AI so he could focus on what he thought was the more interesting and debatable issue. He argued that even if we assume that we had a computer program that acted exactly like a human mind, there would still be a difficult philosophical question that needed to be answered. Neither of Searle's two positions are of great concern to AI research, since they do not directly answer the question \\"can a machine display general intelligence?\\" (unless it can also be shown that consciousness is necessary for intelligence). Turing wrote \\"I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness‚Ä¶ [b]ut I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question [of whether machines can think].\\" under \\"(4) The Argument from Consciousness\\". See also , where they identify Searle's argument with Turing's \\"Argument from Consciousness.\\" Russell and Norvig agree: \\"Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.\\" There are a few researchers who believe that consciousness is an essential element in intelligence, such as Igor Aleksander, Stan Franklin, Ron Sun, and Pentti Haikonen, although their definition of \\"consciousness\\" strays very close to \\"intelligence.\\" (See artificial consciousness.) Before we can answer this question, we must be clear what we mean by \\"minds\\", \\"mental states\\" and \\"consciousness\\". =Consciousness, minds, mental states, meaning= The words \\"mind\\" and \\"consciousness\\" are used by different communities in different ways. Some new age thinkers, for example, use the word \\"consciousness\\" to describe something similar to Bergson's \\"√©lan vital\\": an invisible, energetic fluid that permeates life and especially the mind. Science fiction writers use the word to describe some essential property that makes us human: a machine or alien that is \\"conscious\\" will be presented as a fully human character, with intelligence, desires, will, insight, pride and so on. (Science fiction writers also use the words \\"sentience\\", \\"sapience,\\" \\"self-awareness\\" or \\"ghost\\" - as in the Ghost in the Shell manga and anime series - to describe this essential human property). For others , the words \\"mind\\" or \\"consciousness\\" are used as a kind of secular synonym for the soul. For philosophers, neuroscientists and cognitive scientists, the words are used in a way that is both more precise and more mundane: they refer to the familiar, everyday experience of having a \\"thought in your head\\", like a perception, a dream, an intention or a plan, and to the way we know something, or mean something or understand something . \\"It's not hard to give a commonsense definition of consciousness\\" observes philosopher John Searle.\\"[P]eople always tell me it was very hard to define consciousness, but I think if you're just looking for the kind of commonsense definition that you get at the beginning of the investigation, and not at the hard nosed scientific definition that comes at the end, it's not hard to give commonsense definition of consciousness.\\" The Philosopher's Zone: The question of consciousness. Also see What is mysterious and fascinating is not so much what it is but how it is: how does a lump of fatty tissue and electricity give rise to this (familiar) experience of perceiving, meaning or thinking? Philosophers call this the hard problem of consciousness. It is the latest version of a classic problem in the philosophy of mind called the \\"mind-body problem.\\" A related problem is the problem of meaning or understanding (which philosophers call \\"intentionality\\"): what is the connection between our thoughts and what we are thinking about (i.e. objects and situations out in the world)? A third issue is the problem of experience (or \\"phenomenology\\"): If two people see the same thing, do they have the same experience? Or are there things \\"inside their head\\" (called \\"qualia\\") that can be different from person to person? Neurobiologists believe all these problems will be solved as we begin to identify the neural correlates of consciousness: the actual relationship between the machinery in our heads and its collective properties; such as the mind, experience and understanding. Some of the harshest critics of artificial intelligence agree that the brain is just a machine, and that consciousness and intelligence are the result of physical processes in the brain.For example, John Searle writes: \\"Can a machine think? The answer is, obvious, yes. We are precisely such machines.\\" The difficult philosophical question is this: can a computer program, running on a digital machine that shuffles the binary digits of zero and one, duplicate the ability of the neurons to create minds, with mental states (like understanding or perceiving), and ultimately, the experience of consciousness? =Arguments that a computer cannot have a mind and mental states= Searle's Chinese room John Searle asks us to consider a thought experiment: suppose we have written a computer program that passes the Turing test and demonstrates general intelligent action. Suppose, specifically that the program can converse in fluent Chinese. Write the program on 3x5 cards and give them to an ordinary person who does not speak Chinese. Lock the person into a room and have him follow the instructions on the cards. He will copy out Chinese characters and pass them in and out of the room through a slot. From the outside, it will appear that the Chinese room contains a fully intelligent person who speaks Chinese. The question is this: is there anyone (or anything) in the room that understands Chinese? That is, is there anything that has the mental state of understanding, or which has conscious awareness of what is being discussed in Chinese? The man is clearly not aware. The room cannot be aware. The cards certainly aren't aware. Searle concludes that the Chinese room, or any other physical symbol system, cannot have a mind.. See also , , and Searle goes on to argue that actual mental states and consciousness require (yet to be described) \\"actual physical-chemical properties of actual human brains.\\" He argues there are special \\"causal properties\\" of brains and neurons that gives rise to minds: in his words \\"brains cause minds.\\" Related arguments: Leibniz' mill, Davis's telephone exchange, Block's Chinese nation and Blockhead Gottfried Leibniz made essentially the same argument as Searle in 1714, using the thought experiment of expanding the brain until it was the size of a mill., In 1974, Lawrence Davis imagined duplicating the brain using telephone lines and offices staffed by people, and in 1978 Ned Block envisioned the entire population of China involved in such a brain simulation. This thought experiment is called \\"the Chinese Nation\\" or \\"the Chinese Gym\\". Ned Block also proposed his Blockhead argument, which is a version of the Chinese room in which the program has been re-factored into a simple set of rules of the form \\"see this, do that\\", removing all mystery from the program.  Responses to the Chinese room  Responses to the Chinese room emphasize several different points. * The systems reply and the virtual mind reply: under \\"1. The Systems Reply (Berkeley)\\", , , . Among those who hold to the \\"system\\" position (according to Cole) are Ned Block, Jack Copeland, Daniel Dennett, Jerry Fodor, John Haugeland, Ray Kurzweil and Georges Rey. Those who have defended the \\"virtual mind\\" reply include Marvin Minsky, Alan Perlis, David Chalmers, Ned Block and J. Cole (again, according to ) This reply argues that the system, including the man, the program, the room, and the cards, is what understands Chinese. Searle claims that the man in the room is the only thing which could possibly \\"have a mind\\" or \\"understand\\", but others disagree, arguing that it is possible for there to be two minds in the same physical place, similar to the way a computer can simultaneously \\"be\\" two machines at once: one physical (like a Macintosh) and one \\"virtual\\" (like a word processor). *Speed, power and complexity replies: ascribes this position to Ned Block, Daniel Dennett, Tim Maudlin, David Chalmers, Steven Pinker, Patricia Churchland and others. Several critics point out that the man in the room would probably take millions of years to respond to a simple question, and would require \\"filing cabinets\\" of astronomical proportions. This brings the clarity of Searle's intuition into doubt. *Robot reply: under \\"2. The Robot Reply (Yale)\\". ascribes this position to Margaret Boden, Tim Crane, Daniel Dennett, Jerry Fodor, Stevan Harnad, Hans Moravec and Georges Rey To truly understand, some believe the Chinese Room needs eyes and hands. Hans Moravec writes: 'If we could graft a robot to a reasoning program, we wouldn't need a person to provide the meaning anymore: it would come from the physical world.\\"Quoted in *Brain simulator reply: under \\"3. The Brain Simulator Reply (Berkeley and M.I.T.)\\" ascribes this position to Paul and Patricia Churchland and Ray Kurzweil What if the program simulates the sequence of nerve firings at the synapses of an actual brain of an actual Chinese speaker? The man in the room would be simulating an actual brain. This is a variation on the \\"systems reply\\" that appears more plausible because \\"the system\\" now clearly operates like a human brain, which strengthens the intuition that there is something besides the man in the room that could understand Chinese. *Other minds reply and the epiphenomena reply: under \\"5. The Other Minds Reply\\", . makes this reply under \\"(4) The Argument from Consciousness.\\" Cole ascribes this position to Daniel Dennett and Hans Moravec. Several people have noted that Searle's argument is just a version of the problem of other minds, applied to machines. Since it is difficult to decide if people are \\"actually\\" thinking, we should not be surprised that it is difficult to answer the same question about machines. :A related question is whether \\"consciousness\\" (as Searle understands it) exists. Searle argues that the experience of consciousness can't be detected by examining the behavior of a machine, a human being or any other animal. Daniel Dennett points out that natural selection cannot preserve a feature of an animal that has no effect on the behavior of the animal, and thus consciousness (as Searle understands it) can't be produced by natural selection. Therefore either natural selection did not produce consciousness, or \\"strong AI\\" is correct in that consciousness can be detected by suitably designed Turing test. Is thinking a kind of computation? The computational theory of mind or \\"computationalism\\" claims that the relationship between mind and brain is similar (if not identical) to the relationship between a running program and a computer. The idea has philosophical roots in Hobbes (who claimed reasoning was \\"nothing more than reckoning\\"), Leibniz (who attempted to create a logical calculus of all human ideas), Hume (who thought perception could be reduced to \\"atomic impressions\\") and even Kant (who analyzed all experience as controlled by formal rules)., The latest version is associated with philosophers Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor. This question bears on our earlier questions: if the human brain is a kind of computer then computers can be both intelligent and conscious, answering both the practical and philosophical questions of AI. In terms of the practical question of AI (\\"Can a machine display general intelligence?\\"), some versions of computationalism make the claim that (as Hobbes wrote): * Reasoning is nothing but reckoning. In other words, our intelligence derives from a form of calculation, similar to arithmetic. This is the physical symbol system hypothesis discussed above, and it implies that artificial intelligence is possible. In terms of the philosophical question of AI (\\"Can a machine have mind, mental states and consciousness?\\"), most versions of computationalism claim that (as Stevan Harnad characterizes it): * Mental states are just implementations of (the right) computer programs. This is John Searle's \\"strong AI\\" discussed above, and it is the real target of the Chinese room argument (according to Harnad). Other related questions Alan Turing noted that there are many arguments of the form \\"a machine will never do X\\", where X can be many things, such as: > Be kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly, have initiative, have a sense of > humor, tell right from wrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy > strawberries and cream, make someone fall in love with it, learn from > experience, use words properly, be the subject of its own thought, have as > much diversity of behaviour as a man, do something really new. under \\"(5) > Arguments from Various Disabilities\\" Turing argues that these objections are often based on naive assumptions about the versatility of machines or are \\"disguised forms of the argument from consciousness\\". Writing a program that exhibits one of these behaviors \\"will not make much of an impression.\\" All of these arguments are tangential to the basic premise of AI, unless it can be shown that one of these traits is essential for general intelligence. =Can a machine have emotions?= If \\"emotions\\" are defined only in terms of their effect on behavior or on how they function inside an organism, then emotions can be viewed as a mechanism that an intelligent agent uses to maximize the utility of its actions. Given this definition of emotion, Hans Moravec believes that \\"robots in general will be quite emotional about being nice people\\".Quoted in Fear is a source of urgency. Empathy is a necessary component of good human computer interaction. He says robots \\"will try to please you in an apparently selfless manner because it will get a thrill out of this positive reinforcement. You can interpret this as a kind of love.\\" Daniel Crevier writes \\"Moravec's point is that emotions are just devices for channeling behavior in a direction beneficial to the survival of one's species.\\" =Can a machine be self- aware?= \\"Self-awareness\\", as noted above, is sometimes used by science fiction writers as a name for the essential human property that makes a character fully human. Turing strips away all other properties of human beings and reduces the question to \\"can a machine be the subject of its own thought?\\" Can it think about itself? Viewed in this way, a program can be written that can report on its own internal states, such as a debugger. Though arguably self-awareness often presumes a bit more capability; a machine that can ascribe meaning in some way to not only its own state but in general postulating questions without solid answers: the contextual nature of its existence now; how it compares to past states or plans for the future, the limits and value of its work product, how it perceives its performance to be valued-by or compared to others. =Can a machine be original or creative?= Turing reduces this to the question of whether a machine can \\"take us by surprise\\" and argues that this is obviously true, as any programmer can attest. under \\"(6) Lady Lovelace's Objection\\" He notes that, with enough storage capacity, a computer can behave in an astronomical number of different ways. under \\"(5) Argument from Various Disabilities\\" It must be possible, even trivial, for a computer that can represent ideas to combine them in new ways. (Douglas Lenat's Automated Mathematician, as one example, combined ideas to discover new mathematical truths.) Kaplan and Haenlein suggest that machines can display scientific creativity, while it seems likely that humans will have the upper hand where artistic creativity is concerned. In 2009, scientists at Aberystwyth University in Wales and the U.K's University of Cambridge designed a robot called Adam that they believe to be the first machine to independently come up with new scientific findings. Also in 2009, researchers at Cornell developed Eureqa, a computer program that extrapolates formulas to fit the data inputted, such as finding the laws of motion from a pendulum's motion. =Can a machine be benevolent or hostile?= This question (like many others in the philosophy of artificial intelligence) can be presented in two forms. \\"Hostility\\" can be defined in terms function or behavior, in which case \\"hostile\\" becomes synonymous with \\"dangerous\\". Or it can be defined in terms of intent: can a machine \\"deliberately\\" set out to do harm? The latter is the question \\"can a machine have conscious states?\\" (such as intentions) in another form. The question of whether highly intelligent and completely autonomous machines would be dangerous has been examined in detail by futurists (such as the Singularity Institute). The obvious element of drama has also made the subject popular in science fiction, which has considered many differently possible scenarios where intelligent machines pose a threat to mankind; see Artificial intelligence in fiction. One issue is that machines may acquire the autonomy and intelligence required to be dangerous very quickly. Vernor Vinge has suggested that over just a few years, computers will suddenly become thousands or millions of times more intelligent than humans. He calls this \\"the Singularity.\\" He suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans.The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era, by Vernor Vinge, Department of Mathematical Sciences, San Diego State University, (c) 1993 by Vernor Vinge. This is discussed by a philosophy called Singularitarianism. In 2009, academics and technical experts attended a conference to discuss the potential impact of robots and computers and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard. They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved \\"cockroach intelligence.\\" They noted that self- awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man By JOHN MARKOFF, NY Times, July 26, 2009.

They point to programs like the Language Acquisition Device which can emulate human interaction. Some have suggested a need to build \\"Friendly AI\\", meaning that the advances which are already occurring with AI should also include an effort to make AI intrinsically friendly and humane.Article at Asimovlaws.com, July 2004, accessed 7/27/09. =Can a machine have a soul?= Finally, those who believe in the existence of a soul may argue that \\"Thinking is a function of man's immortal soul.\\" Alan Turing called this \\"the theological objection\\". He writes > In attempting to construct such machines we should not be irreverently > usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the > procreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His > will providing mansions for the souls that He creates. under \\"(1) The > Theological Objection\\", although he also writes, \\"I am not very impressed > with theological arguments whatever they may be used to support\\" Views on the role of philosophy Some scholars argue that the AI community's dismissal of philosophy is detrimental. In the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, some philosophers argue that the role of philosophy in AI is underappreciated. Physicist David Deutsch argues that without an understanding of philosophy or its concepts, AI development would suffer from a lack of progress.

Traditionally, the theory of retributive justice is based on the ideas of retaliation (punishment), which is valuable in itself, and also provides deterrent. Before the police, sentences of execution or imprisonment were thought pretty efficient at this, while at the same time removing the threat criminals pose to the public (protection). Alternative sentences add to these goals, trying to reform the offender (rehabilitation), and put right what they did (reparation). Traditionally, victims of a crime only played a small part in the criminal justice process, as this breaching the rules of the society. The restorative approach to justice approach often makes it a part of a sentence for the offender to apologize, compensate the damage they have caused or repair it with their own labour. The shift towards alternative sentencing means that some offenders avoid imprisonment with its many unwanted consequences. This is beneficial for the society, as it may prevent them from getting into the so-called the revolving door syndrome, the inability of a person to go back to normal life after leaving a prison, becoming a career criminal. Furthermore, there are hopes that this could alleviate prison overcrowding and reduce the cost of punishment. Instead of depriving those who commit less dangerous offences (such as summary offences) of their freedom, the courts put some limitations on them and give them some duties. The list of components that make up a community sentence is of course different in individual countries, and will be combined individually by the court. Non-custodial sentences can include: * unpaid work (this can be called community payback or community service) * house arrest * curfew * suspended sentence (that means that breaking the law during a sentence may lead to imprisonment) * wearing an electronic tag * mandatory treatments and programmes (drug or alcohol treatment, psychological help, back to work programmes,) * apology to the victim * specific court orders and injunctions (not to drink alcohol, not to go to certain pubs, meet certain people) * regular reporting to someone (offender manager, probation) * judicial corporal punishment J.D.

They were one of the western bands of the Wappinger Confederacy. By 1640, their territory (Wykagyl) extended from Hell Gate to Norwalk, Connecticut, and as far inland as White Plains, New York, and became hotly contested between Dutch and English colonial interests. The name Siwanoy may be a corruption of Siwanak, \\"salt people\\". History =Culture= The Siwanoy spoke Munsee, a Delaware language. Like the greater Lenape, the Siwanoy generally had black hair and brown eyes. Women typically wore their hair loose, whereas men would often remove all hair but a long forelock. They frequently painted their bodies and faces (black, red, yellow, blue and white) for ceremonial rites, war and festive occasions, or to mourn the dead. Wampum jewelry and belts were worn as a symbol of social status. The Siwanoy no doubt ate all varieties of fish and shellfish, as the shore had numerous fishing stations and a rich aquatic life; and the interior provided fruits, nuts, and animal life. Their closest allies were the Lenape to the west and the Mahicans to the north, with whom they shared a totem (or emblem) ‚Äì the ‚Äúenchanted wolf‚Äù, with the right paw raised defiantly. They were also allied and shared a common lifestyle with the Wecquaesgeek. Like other tribes of the area, the Siwanoy were loosely organized into several groups, each with a sagamore or chieftain and a somewhat-defined territory. =Settlements= The Siwanoys' largest village in 1640 was Poningo, located near modern day Rye, New York. They also had stockade settlements at Ann Hook's Neck, Hunter Island, and Davenport Neck (Shippan), and ‚Äúwinter quarters‚Äù farther south at Hell Gate. They referred to the area surrounding Ann Hook's Neck and Hunter Island as Laaphawachking (\\"place of stringing beads\\"), because of the large quantities of wampum produced there. The village of Nanichiestawack or Nawchestaweck (\\"place of safety\\"), located near present day Woods Bridge at Muscoot Reservoir, was destroyed during the Pound Ridge massacre in 1644. =Religion= Two glacial erratic boulders named Grey Mare and Mishow, located on Hunter Island, were spiritually significant to the Siwanoy. Here the Siwanoys practiced their sacred ceremonies, and two sachems are believed to be buried at Mishow; the Siwanoys believed the boulders to have been placed there by their guardian Manitou (the spiritual, omnipresent life force that manifests itself in everything). However, many Siwanoys likely became Christianized; the Siwanoy sagamore Wampage I was one of these, and he took John White as a baptismal name. =Conflict with European colonists= The western bands of the Wappinger, including the Siwanoy, became involved in war with the Dutch in 1640, which lasted five years. This period is often referred to as Kieft's War, and is said to have cost the lives of some 1,600 Wappinger refugees. Thus, tensions between the colonists and the indigenous people of the area were extremely high at this time, and this undoubtedly led to the massacre of Anne Hutchinson and her family in 1643. A group of Siwanoy, led by Wampage I, killed Hutchinson, six of her children, and nine others in August 1643, near Split Rock, an ancient landmark. The only survivor was Hutchinson's nine-year-old daughter, Susanna - possibly spared because of her red hair - who \\"became the wife of an Indian Chief, residing in a settlement near the Split Rock\\". It has been written that Wampage himself was the murderer of Hutchinson and that he adopted the name of Anh≈ç≈çke due to a Mahican custom of taking the name of a notable person personally killed. In February 1644, the entire village of Nanichiestawack was wiped out by 130 Dutch mercenaries under Capt. John Underhill. The surprise attack, known as the Pound Ridge massacre, took place while a large number of Siwanoy and Wecquaesgeek people were gathered together for a corn festival. The Dutch forces slaughtered between 500 and 700 indigenous people, including women and children, who were forced into their homes and burned alive. =Treaty with Thomas Pell= On June 27, 1654, sagamores ShƒÅwƒÅn√≥r≈çckquot (Shanarockwell), Poqu≈çr≈´m, Anh≈ç≈çke (Wampage I), WawhƒÅmkus, and Meh√∫m≈çw deeded to Thomas Pell 9,160 acres of land east of the Hutchinson River northward to Mamaroneck, including modern day Pelham, New Rochelle, The Pelham Islands, and portions of The Bronx. The parties signed a treaty under the Treaty Oak near Bartow-Pell Mansion in Pelham. New Netherland authorities did not recognize his title. They accused the New Englanders of continued encroachment upon Dutch territory. Pell's coup turned out to be decisive in New York history. A militia of his colonists from Minneford Island (present day City Island) supported the English naval invasion force that conquered New Amsterdam in 1664. =Merger and removal= Following the 1654 treaty, the Siwanoys remained in the area around Westchester County for another hundred years, until they eventually \\"melted away\\" by intermarriage with the English settlers.

It is a vast stretch of field that includes numerous play grounds, including the famous cricketing venue Eden Gardens, several football stadiums and the Kolkata Race Course. The Maidan is dotted with statues and architectural works, the most notable being the Victoria Memorial. Due to the freshness and greenery it provides to the metropolis, it has been referred to as the \\"lungs of Kolkata\\". The property of the Indian Army, the Maidan hosts the army's Eastern zone high command in Fort William. The Maidan stretches from the Raj Bhavan building on the Esplanade in the north to the National Library on Belvedere Road in Alipore in the south. The wide field stretches from the Hooghly River in the west to the Victoria Memorial in the east. It is a historical and cultural center of Kolkata as well as a center of leisure and entertainment for Calcuttans. History A view of Calcutta from Fort William (c.1807) Government House, that lined the north side of the Maidan In 1758, one year after their decisive win in Battle of Plassey, the British East India Company commenced construction of the new Fort William in the center of the village Gobindapur. The inhabitants of the village were compensated and provided with land in Taltala, Kumartuli and Shovabazar. The fort was completed in 1773.

In 1909, H.E.A. Cotton wrote, Grand field day on the ground, 1847 In Bengali, the maidan is called 'Garh-er maath'. 'Garh', in Bengali, means fort and its meaning literally translates to the 'fort's ground'.

On Council House Street, at one corner of the Maidan, was the long-defunct Fort William College,Cotton, H.E.A., p. 271 which played a pioneering role in the development of many of the Indian languages, particularly Bengali.

In response to delays in bringing cases to trial, some states have adopted \\"fast-track\\" rules that sharply limit the ability of judges to grant continuances. However, a motion for continuance may be granted when necessitated by unforeseeable events, or for other reasonable cause articulated by the movant (the person seeking the continuance), especially when the court deems it necessary and prudent in the \\"interest of justice.\\" Criminal cases =In general= Although a continuance is the result of a court order that is issued by the judge in a trial or hearing, it also can come from a statute or law. The terms continuance and postponement are frequently used interchangeably.17 Am Jur 2nd \\"Continuance\\", section 1 The burden of scheduling trials, which includes assembling the witnesses, lawyers and jurors at the same time, usually is a reason not to grant continuances in criminal cases except for compelling reasons.State v.

In some cases, denial of a continuance may infringe on such rights and amount to a violation of due process‚Äîwhich could result in dismissal of an indictment, or provide grounds for reversal.State v.

State, 105 NM 453, 734 P 2nd 231 Courts will lend a defendant all practicable help in securing evidence necessary for a defense, if it is sought in a timely manner. It is usual to grant a continuance if there is a problem in gathering evidence or the serving of subpoenas upon witnesses, if the defendant is not at fault for the delay. (See Powell v. Alabama) Powell v. State, 39 Ala 246 100, So. 2nd 38, cert den 267 Ala 100, 100 So 2nd 46 Once accused of a crime, the prosecutor has a right to a reasonable opportunity to secure the personal attendance of a witness. A continuance is proper, if it appears due diligence has failed to procure the presence of a witness. It must be shown that it is reasonably certain the witness' presence will be subsequently secured, and that the expected testimony will be material to the accused's defense.State v. Wilcox, 21 SD 532, 114 NW 687 =The Federal Speedy Trial Act of 1974= Under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a person accused of a crime and facing a criminal prosecution, is guaranteed the right to a speedy trial. Various state constitutions also guarantee this right.16 ALR 4th 128317 Am Jur 2nd \\"Continuance\\", section 60 The Federal Speedy Trial Act of 1974 operates to implement an accused person's constitutional right to a speedy trial.18 USCS section 3161-317488 Stat. 2080 Factors considered by the courts within the Speedy Trial Act are: * Whether the failure to grant a continuance in the proceeding would be a miscarriage of justice.18 USCS section 3161 (h) (8) (B) (i) * Whether the trial is so complex, the gathering of witnesses and evidence so burdensome, or the fact situation so unusual that a continuance should be granted.Idem. at (ii) * The arrest precedes the indictment or the fact situation is complex.Idem. at (iii) * The failure to grant such a continuance in a case is enough to deny the defendant reasonable time to obtain counsel, or effective preparation.Idem (iv) The result of this law has been that many continuances previously issued have been denied.United States v.

Wingo, 407 US 514 (1972) the United States Supreme Court set out a four factor test for determining whether delay between the initiation of criminal proceedings and the beginning of a trial violates the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. The court must consider: * The length of delay. * The cause of the delay. * The defendant's assertion of his rights to a speedy trial. * The presence or absence of prejudice resulting from the delay. Appeal Courts routinely reject Sixth Amendment challenges to a speedy trial, after a criminal conviction.United States v.

Loud Hawk United States v. Loud Hawk 474 US 302 (1986) did not consider a 90-month delay in trial excessive. In that case, there had been a series of motions consuming a great deal of time. In the 1992 case of Doggett v. United States Doggett V. United States 505 US 647 (1992) the United States Supreme Court considered an 8¬Ω year delay between indictment and criminal trial excessive. =Continuance because of excessive press coverage= Sometimes press coverage of a criminal act and the trial can become excessive. This is usually greater in one part of the jurisdiction than others. Coverage is often greater in the time immediately following the commission of the crime and also after a high profile arrest. The question becomes: does the excessive coverage, including editorial speculation, so color the potential jury pool that a fair trial cannot be had? A continuance of the criminal trial can be granted to transfer the trial to another part of the jurisdiction, or to let passions cool.Saltzburg, S. \\"American Criminal Procedure, Cases and Commentary, Second Edition\\" West Publishing Co. 1984 p. 948 The movement of the trial is called a change of venue. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 21 (a) provides for the transfer of proceedings to another district if the judge is satisfied that there exists a prejudicial atmosphere. To meet the requirements for a transfer, the trial judge must determine that there exists so great a prejudice in favor of the prosecution or against the defendant that there is a reasonable likelihood the defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial. In the famous 1966 Sam Sheppard case, (Sheppard v. Maxwell)Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 US 333, (1966) the United States Supreme Court held that where there was a reasonable likelihood that the prejudicial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial, the judge should continue the case until the threat abates, or transfer it to another county not so permeated with publicity. This doctrine has been annunciated in other cases.Rideau v. Louisiana 373 US 723, 727, (1963)Irvin v. Dowd, 366, US 717, 718, (1961) There is reason to believe that courts do not generally grant a change of venue upon a reasonable likelihood of prejudice from pre-trial publicity. A showing of actual prejudice usually is required unless the state (prosecution) effectively concedes prejudice.Durrough v. State 562, SW 2nd 488 (Tex Circuit App. 1978) In the 1981 California case of Martinez v. Superior CourtMartinez v. Superior Court, 29 Cal. 3rd 574, 174, Cal Rptr 701, 629, P 2nd 502, (1981) the court used the \\"reasonable likelihood of prejudice standard\\" to grant a mandamus petition and order a change of venue in a murder prosecution. The court emphasized extensive publicity over the course of a year prior to the trial, the small size of the county where the trial was to be held, and the gravity of the charge. The court observed that the status of the victim and the accused in the community are significant, but not necessarily controlling factors in ruling on a venue change request. In the 1982 California case of Odle v. Superior CourtOdle v. Superior Court, 32 Cal. 3rd 932, 187 Cal Rptr. 455, 654, P2nd 255, (1982) the California Supreme Court did not find there had been any reasonable likelihood of prejudice from pretrial publicity. The usual approach is to demand a showing of actual prejudice. In the 1981 case of People v. Botham, the Colorado court overturned the defendant's murder conviction partly because there had been a denial of a change of venue. The court emphasized the number of jurors who had expressed an opinion that the defendant was guilty, the number who had been exposed to pretrial publicity, the juror's knowledge of the details of the crime, and the information that was brought forth on voir dire to find that the defendant met the burden of showing a presumption of partiality.People v. Botham 629, P 2nd 589 Colorado 1981 A more typical finding is seen in Swindler v. State,Swindler v. State Ark 418, 592 SW 2nd 91 (1991) a 1991 case from Arkansas that upheld the death penalty and rejected challenges to jury bias and change of venue motion where three jurors were seated who had read and heard about the case, and over 80% of the jurors called were excused for cause. Extensive case law is discussed.39 ALR 2nd 1314, section 317 Am Jur 2nd \\"Continuance\\", sections 114-115 Perhaps the most famous case in pre-trial publicity is that of Sheppard v. MaxwellSheppard v. Maxwell, 384 US 333, 1966 argued by F. Lee Bailey. Sam Sheppard, a doctor was convicted of second degree murder of his wife. The case had been subjected to a large amount of pre-trial news coverage and widespread speculation about Sheppard's guilt. The United States Supreme Court ruled that the case should be remanded for a new trial, opining that the trial court should have limited news access prior to the trial.Saltzburg, S. \\"American Criminal Procedure, Cases and Commentary\\", West Publishing Co. 1984, p. 926-934 Change of venue requests, choice of a new venue and where the new venue is sought because of local prejudice varies in different jurisdictions.

Self-regulation consists of several stages, and individuals must function as contributors to their own motivation, behavior, and development within a network of reciprocally interacting influences. Roy Baumeister, one of the leading social psychologists who have studied self-regulation, claims it has four components: standards of desirable behavior, motivation to meet standards, monitoring of situations and thoughts that precede breaking said standards, and lastly, willpower. Baumeister along with other colleagues developed three models of self-regulation designed to explain its cognitive accessibility: self-regulation as a knowledge structure, strength, or skill. Studies have been done to determine that the strength model is generally supported, because it is a limited resource in the brain and only a given amount of self-regulation can occur until that resource is depleted. SRT can be applied to: * impulse control, the management of short-term desires. People with low impulse control are prone to acting on immediate desires. This is one route for such people to find their way to jail as many criminal acts occur in the heat of the moment. For non-violent people it can lead to losing friends through careless outbursts, or financial problems caused by making too many impulsive purchases. * the cognitive bias known as illusion of control. To the extent that people are driven by internal goals concerned with the exercise of control over their environment, they will seek to reassert control in conditions of chaos, uncertainty or stress. Failing genuine control, one coping strategy will be to fall back on defensive attributions of control-- leading to illusions of control (Fenton-O'Creevy et al., 2003). * goal attainment and motivation * sickness behavior SRT consists of several stages. First, the patient deliberately monitors one's own behavior, and evaluates how this behavior affects one's health. If the desired effect is not realized, the patient changes personal behavior. If the desired effect is realized, the patient reinforces the effect by continuing the behavior. (Kanfer 1970;1971;1980) Another approach is for the patient to realize a personal health issue and understand the factors involved in that issue. The patient must decide upon an action plan for resolving the health issue. The patient will need to deliberately monitor the results in order to appraise the effects, checking for any necessary changes in the action plan. (Leventhal & Nerenz 1984) Another factor that can help the patient reach his/her own goal of personal health is to relate to the patient the following: Help them figure out the personal/community views of the illness, appraise the risks involved, and give them potential problem-solving/coping skills. Four components of self-regulation described by Baumeister et al. (2007) are: *Standards: Of desirable behavior. *Motivation: To meet standards. *Monitoring: Of situations and thoughts that precede breaking standards. *Willpower: Internal strength to control urges  History and contributors  = Albert Bandura = There have been numerous researchers, psychologists, and scientists that have studied self-regulatory processes. Albert Bandura, a cognitive psychologist had significant contributions focusing on the acquisition of behaviors that led to the social cognitive theory and social learning theory. His work brought together behavioral and cognitive components in which he concluded that \\"humans are able to control their behavior through a process known as self- regulation.\\" This led to his known process that contained: self observation, judgement, and self response. Self observation (also known as introspection) is a process involving assessing one's own thoughts and feelings in order to inform and motivate the individual to work towards goal setting and become influenced by behavioral changes. Judgement involves an individual comparing his or her performance to their personal or created standards. Lastly, self- response is applied, in which an individual may reward or punish his or herself for success or failure in meeting standard(s). An example of self- response would be rewarding oneself with an extra slice of pie for doing well on an exam. = Dale Schunk = According to Schunk (2012), Lev Vygotsky who was a Russian psychologist and was a major influence on the rise of constructivism, believed that self-regulation involves the coordination of cognitive processes such as planning, synthesizing, and formulating concepts (Henderson & Cunningham, 1994); however, such coordination does not proceed independently of the individual's social environment and culture. In fact, self-regulation is inclusive of the gradual internalization of language and concepts. = Roy Baumeister = As a widely studied theory, SRL was also greatly impacted by the well-known social psychologist Roy Baumeister. He described the ability to self-regulate as limited in capacity, and through this he coined the term ego depletion. The four components of self-regulation theory described by Roy Baumeister are standards of desirable behavior, motivation to meet standards, monitoring of situations and thoughts that precede breaking standards, and willpower, or the internal strength to control urges. In Baumeister's paper titled Self-Regulation Failure: An Overview, he express that self-regulation is complex and multifaceted. Baumeister lays out his ‚Äúthree ingredients‚Äù of self-regulation as a case for self-regulation failure.  Research  Many studies have been done to test different variables regarding self-regulation. Albert Bandura studied self-regulation before, after and during the response. He created the triangle of reciprocal determinism that includes behavior, environment, and the person (cognitive, emotional, and physical factors) that all influence one another. Bandura concluded that the processes of goal attainment and motivation stem from an equal interaction of self-observation, self-reaction, self-evaluation, and self-efficacy. In addition to Bandura's work, psychologists Muraven, Tice, and Baumeister conducted a study for self control as a limited resource. They suggested there were three competing models to self-regulation: self- regulation as a strength, knowledge structure, and a skill. In the strength model, they indicated it is possible self-regulation could be considered a strength because it requires willpower and thus is a limited resource. Failure to self-regulate could then be explained by depletion of this resource. For self-regulation as a knowledge structure, they theorized it involves a certain amount of knowledge to exert self control, so as with any learned technique, failure to self-regulate could be explained by insufficient knowledge. Lastly, the model involving self-regulation as a skill referred to self-regulation being built up over time and unable to be diminished; therefore, failure to exert would be explained by a lack of skill. They found that self-regulation as a strength is the most feasible model due to studies that have suggested self-regulation is a limited resource. Dewall, Baumeister, Gailliot, and Maner performed a series of experiments instructing participants to perform ego depletion tasks to diminish the self-regulatory resource in the brain, that they theorized to be glucose. This included tasks that required participants to break a familiar habit, where they read an essay and circled words containing the letter 'e' for the first task, then were asked to break that habit by performing a second task where they circled words containing 'e' and/or 'a'. Following this trial, participants were randomly assigned to either the glucose category, where they drank a glass of lemonade made with sugar, or the control group, with lemonade made from Splenda. They were then asked their individual likelihoods of helping certain people in hypothetical situations, for both kin and non-kin, and found that excluding kin, people were much less likely to help a person in need if they were in the control group (with Splenda) than if they had replenished their brain glucose supply with the lemonade containing real sugar. This study also supports the model for self-regulation as a strength because it confirms it is a limited resource. Baumeister and colleagues expanded on this, and determined the four components to self-regulation. Those include standards of desirable behavior, motivation to meet these standards, monitoring of situations and thoughts that precede breaking standards, and willpower.  Applications and examples  Impulse control in self-regulation involves the separation of our immediate impulses and long-term desires. We can plan, evaluate our actions, and refrain from doing things we will regret. Research shows that self-regulation is a strength necessary for emotional well-being. Violation of one's deepest values results in feelings of guilt, which will undermine well-being. The illusion of control involves people overestimating their own ability to control events. Such as, when an event occurs an individual may feel greater a sense of control over the outcome that they demonstrably do not influence. This emphasizes the importance of perception of control over life events. The self- regulated learning is the process of taking control and evaluating one's own learning and behavior. This emphasizes control by the individual who monitors, directs and regulates actions toward goals of information. In goal attainment self-regulation it is generally described in these four components of self- regulation. Standards, which is the desirable behavior. Motivation, to meet the standards. Monitoring, situations and thoughts that precede breaking standards. Willpower, internal strength to control urges. Illness behavior in self-regulation deals with issues of tension that arise between holding on and letting go of important values and goals as those are threatened by disease processes. Also people who have poor self-regulatory skills do not succeed in relationships or cannot hold jobs. Sayette (2004) describes failures in self- regulation as in two categories: under regulation and misregualtion. Under regulation is when people fail to control oneself whereas misregualtion deals with having control but does not bring up the desired goal (Sayette, 2004).  Criticisms/challenges  One challenge of self-regulation is that researchers often struggle with the conceptualization and operationalization of self- regulation (Carver & Scheier, 1990). The system of self-regulation comprises a complex set of functions, including research cognition, problem solving, decision making, and meta cognition. Ego depletion refers to self control or willpower drawing from a limited pool of mental resources. If an individual has low mental activity, self control is typically impaired, which may lead to ego depletion. Self control plays a valuable role in the functioning of self in people. The illusion of control involves the overestimation of an individual's ability to control certain events. It occurs when someone feels a sense of control over outcomes although they may not possess this control. Psychologists have consistently emphasized the importance of perceptions of control over life events. Heider proposed that humans have a strong motive to control their environment. Reciprocal determinism is a theory proposed by Albert Bandura, stating that a person's behavior is influenced both by personal factors and the social environment. Bandura acknowledges the possibility that individual's behavior and personal factors may impact the environment. These can involve skills that are either under or overcompensating the ego and will not benefit the outcome of the situation. Recently, Baumeister's strength model of ego depletion has been criticized in multiple ways. Meta-analyses found little evidence for the strength model of self-regulationCarter, E. C. & McCullough, M. E. Publication bias and the limited strength model of self-control: has the evidence for ego depletion been overestimated? Front. Psychol. 5, 823 (2014). and for glucose as the limited resource that is depleted.Vadillo, M. A., Gold, N. & Osman, M. The Bitter Truth About Sugar and Willpower: The Limited Evidential Value of the Glucose Model of Ego Depletion. Psychol. Sci. 2016; 0956797616654911 A pre- registered trial did not find any evidence for ego depletion. Several commentaries have raised criticism on this particular study. In summary, many central assumptions of the strength model of self-regulation seem to be in need of revision, especially the view of self-regulation as a limited resource that can be depleted and glucose as the fuel that is depleted seems to be hardly defensible without major revisions.Inzlicht, M., Gervais, W. & Berkman, E. News of Ego Depletion's Demise is Premature: Commentary on Carter, Kofler, Forster, & Mccullough, 2015. SSRN Electron. J. (2015).  Conclusion  Self- regulation can be applied to many aspects of everyday life, including social situations, personal health management, impulse control, and more. Since the strength model is generally supported, ego depletion tasks can be performed to temporarily tax the amount of self-regulatory capabilities in a person's brain. It is theorized that self-regulation depletion is associated with willingness to help people in need, excluding members of an individual's kin. Many researchers have contributed to these findings, including Albert Bandura, Roy Baumeister, and Robert Wood.

This movement begins to occur a day after the winter solstice in December which occurs around 22 December and continues for a six-month period through to the summer solstice around June 21 (dates vary ). This difference is because the solstices are continually precessing at a rate of 50 arcseconds / year due to the precession of the equinoxes, i.e. this difference is the difference between the sidereal and tropical zodiacs. The Surya Siddhanta bridges this difference by juxtaposing the four solstitial and equinotial points with four of the twelve boundaries of the rashis. The complement of Uttarayana is Dakshinayana, i.e. the period between Karka sankranti and Makara Sankranti as per the sidereal zodiac and between the Summer solstice and Winter solstice as per the tropical zodiac.  Difference between Uttarayana and Makar Sankranti  There is a common misconceptionMakar Sankranti and Uttarayana misconception and Panchang Siddhanta that Makar Sankranti marks the beginning of Uttarayana. This is because at one point in time Sayana and Nirayana zodiac were the same. Every year Sidereal and Tropical equinoxes slide by 50 seconds due to Axial precession, giving birth to Ayanamsha and causing Makar Sankranti to slide further. When equinox slides it will increase ayanamsha and Makar Sankranti will also slide. This misconception continues as there is not much difference between actual Uttarayana date which occurs a day after winter solstice (of Dec 21) when the sun makes the northward journey, and January 14. However, the difference will be significant as equinoxes slide further. In 272 BC, Makar Sankranti was on Dec 21. In 1000 AD, Makar Sankranti was on Dec 31 and now it falls on January 14. After 9000 years, Makar Sankranti will be in June. As a result, Makar Sankranti will come in June after 9000 years. Then Makar Sankranti would mark the beginning of Dakshinayana. However Makar Sankranti still holds importance in Hindu rituals. All Drika Panchanga makers like mypanchang.com, datepanchang, janmabhumi panchang, rashtriya panchang Rashtriya Panchang and Vishuddha Siddhanta Panjika use the position of the tropical sun to determine Uttarayana and Dakshinayana.Date and time for winter solstice marking the start of Uttarayana  Uttarayana in various treatises  = Surya Siddhanta = The Surya Siddhanta defines Uttarayana as the period between the Makara Sankranti (which currently occurs around January 14) and Karka Sankranti (which currently occurs around July 16). Bal Gangadhar Tilak proposes an alternative, early vedic definition of Uttarayana as starting from Vernal Equinox and ending with Autumnal Equinox. This definition interprets the term \\"Uttara Ayana\\" as \\"northern movement\\" instead of \\"northward movement\\", i.e. as the movement of the Earth in the region North of the Equator. In support of this proposal, he points to another tradition that the Uttarayana is considered the daytime of the Gods residing at the North Pole which tradition makes sense only if we define Uttarayana as the period between the Vernal and Autumnal equinoxes (when there is Midnight Sun at the North Pole). Conversely, Dakshinaya is defined as the period between the Autumnal and Vernal Equinoxes, when there is midnight sun at the South Pole. This period is also referred to as Pitrayana (with the Pitrus (i.e. ancestors) being placed at the South Pole). = Drik Siddhanta = Illustration of the movement of the Sun north and south of the Equator, caused by axial tilt of the Earth. Illustration of the observed effect of Earth's axial tilt. This festival is currently celebrated on 14 or 15 January but due to axial precession of the earth it will continue to shift away from the actual season. The season occurs based on tropical sun (without ayanamsha). The earth revolves around sun with a tilt of 23.44 degrees. When the tilt is facing the sun we get summer and when the tilt is away from the sun we get winter. That is the reason when there is summer north of the equator, it will be winter south of the equator. Because of this tilt it appears that the sun travels north and south of the equator. This motion of the sun going from south to north is called Uttarayana ‚Äì the sun is moving towards north and when it reaches north it starts moving south and it is called Dakshinayana ‚Äì the sun is moving towards south. This causes seasons which are dependent on equinoxes and solstices. = Hindu Puranas = Uttarayana is referred to as the day of new good healthy wealthy beginning. According to Kauravas and Pandavas, in Mahabharata on this day Bheeshma Pitamaha, chose to leave for his heavenly abode. As per the boon granted to Devavrata (young Bheeshma), he could choose his time of death chose this day, when the sun starts on its course towards the northern hemisphere. According to the Hindu tradition the six months of Uttarayana are a single day of the Gods; the six months of Dakshinayana are a single night of the Gods. Thus a year of twelve months is single Nychthemeron of the Gods.

In 1967, van Hengel founded St. Mary's Food Bank, the world's first food bank in Phoenix, Arizona. He would later go on to create Feeding America, helping to spread the food banking concept across the United States, and eventually the rest of the world. Early years John van Hengel was born in Waupun, Wisconsin. Of Dutch ancestry, he was the son of a nurse and the town pharmacist. He graduated from Lawrence College in Appleton, Wisconsin with a degree in Government. John then attended graduate school at University of Wisconsin but moved to Southern California before finishing. Spending time as a self-described \\"first-rate beach bum\\", van Hengel moved on to study broadcasting at UCLA. His odd jobs included driving a beer truck in Beverly Hills, designing plastic rainwear, a sales manager for Bear Archery and a magazine publicist. John married a model and had two sons. In 1960 his marriage ended in divorce, and he headed back to Wisconsin and went to work in a rock quarry. He became partially paralyzed while breaking up a bar fight. He was sent to Arizona for rehabilitation through the guidance of Barrows Neurological Institute. John regained his strength swimming laps in a YMCA swimming pool and at the age of 44 became the oldest public lifeguard in Phoenix, Arizona. Start of the Food Bank journey John took a vow of poverty upon starting his life in Phoenix. A devout Roman Catholic, John began working at Immaculate Heart Church where he drove the bus and coached sports. He also began volunteering at the very busy St. Vincent de Paul Soup Kitchen. John bought an old milk delivery truck for $150 and used it to gather gleaned citrus fruit and other foods to bring to the soup kitchen. Every evening John would deliver any surplus to the homeless missions in downtown Phoenix. Searching for an efficient, less time consuming method of distributing this food, John approached Father Ronald Colloty from St. Mary's Basilica in regards to setting up a warehouse where the missions could come and pick up the food. The church responded by loaning John $3000 and an inherited bakery building near skid row. John expanded his food resources upon a discovery behind local grocery stores. A destitute mother of 10 well-fed children pointed out ‚Äúa bank of food‚Äù from which she fed her family. Huge amounts of surplus food were being thrown out by grocery stores, food that was frozen but still edible, loose vegetables, stale bread. Inside stores John found less perishable throwaways such as dented cans and leaky bags of rice and sugar. Within a year, in 1967, John had established the location at which all the food that grocery stores could not sell would be housed and distributed. He named it St. Mary's Food Bank in honor of the donation provided by St. Mary's Basilica. In accordance to his vow of poverty, John took no salary during his first decade at St. Mary's. He wore secondhand clothes, got his food at the food bank and lived in a donated room above a garage. Second Harvest and Global Food Banking In 1975 John accepted a $50,000 federal grant which would be utilized to establish 18 food banks across America. In 1976 John left St. Mary's and established Second Harvest (now known as Feeding America). Guided by John, this organization established food banking standards and guidelines as well as acquisition of food from large national manufacturers. Businesses were able to cut the costs of disposing unusable but edible food as well as taking tax breaks by helping multiple charities. In 1983 John left Second Harvest to establish Food Banking Inc. (which became International Food Bank Services in 1991 and is now known as Global FoodBanking Network). John served as a consultant to food banks around the world, traveling to Canada, Mexico, Brussels and Spain to oversee the start up of their food banks. John also helped establish food banks throughout Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia, South America and Australia.

The genus is known from two partial specimens found in the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia that were partially described in 1983 by the paleontologist Rinchen Barsbold. It was a medium-sized dromaeosaurid that was about long weighing . Unlike other dromaeosaurids, Adasaurus developed a rather small and blunt sickle claw that likely had a reduced use, and a recurved lacrimal bone; this latter trait is also shared with the unrelated Austroraptor. Though reduced, the sickle claw retained the characteristic rounded articulation of most dromaeosaurids. Adasaurus was originally regarded as a dromaeosaurine by Barsbold, a group than includes robust dromaeosaurs with deep jaws. Revisions made to the specimens have showed that this dromaeosaurid belongs to the Velociraptorinae which is composed of more lightly build animals like Velociraptor'. History of discovery Fossil localities in Mongolia. The fossil remains of Adasaurus have been found in B√ºgiin Tsav, at Area A Adasaurus was first figured in 1977 by the Mongolian paleontologist Rinchen Barsbold on a pelvic comparison with other theropods, but it would remain as an informally named taxon until a proper description. Translated paper In 1983, Barsbold published a large comparative revision of the known Mongolian theropod taxa at the time where he formally named Adasaurus and the type species A. mongoliensis, which was based on two partial specimens. The generic name, Adasaurus, is taken from the evil spirit Ada in the mythology of Mongolia, and the Greek word œÉŒ±·ø¶œÅŒøœÇ (sauros, meaning lizard). The specific name for the single species, mongoliensis, refers to the country of discovery Mongolia. Barsbold briefly described Adasaurus as a dromaeosaurid and noted that this new taxon possesed a notably reduced second pedal ungual. Given that this trait contrasted to the large, sharply-developed ungual of most members, Barsbold listed it as an unique character for Adasaurus. Translated paper However, the authenticity of this unusual reduction was disputed in 2010 by Phil Senter, who claimed that the supposed ungual did not pertain to the specimen. Nevertheless, in the revised diagnosis conducted by Turner and colleagues in 2012, this character is still considered as authentic, which has been widely followed by other authors. Adasaurus is known from the holotype MPC-D 100/20, which represents an adult individual compromising a partial skull missing its anterior region, the right scapulocoracoid and a sternal plate, 8 cervical vertebrae, 11 partial dorsal vertebrae, the sacrum, 7 caudal vertebrae, partial hindlimbs with the right foot, and a nearly complete right pelvic girdle compromising the ilium, ischium and pubis. A second specimen is represented by the less complete paratype MPC-D 100/21 that includes two caudal vertebrae and a nearly complete right foot. Both specimens were unearthed from the Nemegt Formation at the locality of B√ºgiin Tsav, in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. In 2004, Philip J. Currie and David J. Varricchio referred another two specimens to Adasaurus labelled as IGM 100/22 and IGM 100/23. Supposedly, the specimens were recovered from the same locality of the holotype. Book preview However, these specimens are actually known from the Shine Us Khuduk and Tel Ulan Chaltsai localities (respectively) of the Bayan Shireh Formation and thus, they are older than the remains of Adasaurus from the younger Nemegt Formation. They represent a different and new taxon that differs from Adasaurus. Description Size comparison of the holotype and paratype to an 1.8 m tall human Adasaurus was a medium-sized dromaeosaurid. The holotype has an estimated length of with a weight of . The comparatively larger pedal elements of the paratype indicate a gently bigger size in this latter specimen. Aside from the reduced pedal ungual II, Adasaurus can be recognised by the following additional traits: expanded projection of the maxillary; recurved lacrimal; lower jaw with a prominent surangular foramen; irregular triangular projection on the quadrate shaft; pleurocoels are present on the anterior sacral vertebrae; and the anterior border of the anterior blade in the ilium is relatively shortened. Labelled diagram of the holotype right pelvis On the right side of the skull, the lower portion of the jugal is expanded from the top to the bottom. The quadrate is a large and vertical bone with a large triangular projection on its lateral border. This triangular projection is located on the quadrate shaft and bent to the top. The top surface of the right ectopterygoid‚Äîa smalle bone of the palate‚Äîis flattened to the palate. As in other dromaeosaurids, the lacrimal has an inverted L-shape, but the thin body of this bone is curved, which is also seen in Austroraptor. The scapula and coracoid of the holotype are completely fused giving form to the scapulocoracoid, and the suture between them is not present. Pneumatic foramina are present in the holotypic anterior sacral vertebrae. The femur and tibia of the holotype measure and long, respectively, and the fourth trochanter is a prominent and rugose ridge that is located on the posterior inner surface of the upper region of the femoral shaft. The femur itself is very similar to that of the indeterminate dromaeosaur DGBU-78. The anterior surface of the lower end of the femoral shaft is convex in shape, and the lateral tubercle of the upper end of the tibia-fibula articulation is a compact structure. The presence of a rounded pit on the inner surface of the lower tibiotarsus is often documented in dromaeosaurids, however, this feature is not verifiable in Adasaurus since the astragalus region is covered with sediments. The posterior top border of the ilium is proportionally more thickened than that of Achillobator, and the anterior border of the anterior blade of the ilium has a similar shape to that of Saurornitholestes. This anterior border has a notched appareance that is characterisic to Adasaurus. As a whole, the top border is straightened in shape. The pubic peduncle‚Äîa robust anterior extension that articulates with the pubis‚Äîis wide and developed to the bottom. A large supratrochanteric (above the trochanter of the femur) extension is absent on the ilium. Like other dromaeosaurids, the pubis is elongated with an expanded pubic boot (lower end) and features an opisthopubic (backwards directed) condition. The digit II ungual is not hypertrophied (elongated) as in most dromaeosaurids, and though Adasaurus features a similar metatarsal II-III ratio to that of Balaur, this is due to the reduced sickle claw of digit II instead of an elongated ungual of digit I. Metatarsal III of the paratype shows that a tubercle is present on the extensor surface and this tuberosity likely originates the insertion of the muscle tibialis cranialis. The lower tarsals and upper ends of the metatarsals are somewhat fused. Classification Adasaurus is a member of Dromaeosauridae, a group that is closely related to living birds. When erected by Barsbold in 1983, Velociraptorinae was conceived as a group containing Velociraptor and closely related species that were characterized by their smaller size and long-narrow snouts. However, Barsbold did not included Adasaurus in the group, instead, he placed it within the Dromaeosaurinae. It was not until 1998 that this group was defined as a clade by Paul Sereno. Sereno defined the group as all dromaeosaurids more closely related to Velociraptor than to Dromaeosaurus. The traditional view of the Velociraptorinae commonly included Velociraptor, Tsaagan and Linheraptor, which are known from complete skulls, however, most analyses vary widely regarding which species are actually velociraptorines and which are dromaeosaurines. Turner and colleagues in 2012 supported a traditional, monophyletic composition of Velociraptorinae. However, some studies found a very different group of dromaeosaurids in Velociraptorinae, such as Longrich and Currie in 2009, which recovered Deinonychus outside of the Velociraptorine and Dromaeosaurinae. Traditionally, Adasaurus was assigned to the Dromaeosaurinae, which includes giant, heavily built animals such as Achillobator and Utahraptor but several analyses have suggested that it belongs to the Velociraptorinae instead. Comparison between some members of Velociraptorinae, featuring Linheraptor, Tsaagan and Velociraptor Below is a cladogram based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Powers and colleagues in 2020. Paleobiology =Paleopathology= In 1997, Norell and Makovicky stated that the holotype specimen of Adasaurus represents a largely pathologic (due to injury or disease) individual. They reaffirmed this observation in 2004 by claiming the pelvis as pathological. However, during the large revision of the Dromaeosauridae by Turner and colleagues in 2012, the holotype was re-examined and found to be non-pathological. Instead of reflect injured elements, several surfaces may represent the advanced age of the individual, such as the fused upper ends of the metatarsus. =Claw function= Proposed scenarios for the sickle claw function, with C, D and F as the more supported behaviors In 2011, Denver Fowler and colleagues suggested a new method by which dromaeosaurids may have taken smaller prey. This predation model, \\"Raptor Prey Restraint\\" (RPR), proposes that dromaeosaurids killed their prey by leaping onto their quarry, pinning it under their body weight, and gripping it tightly with the large, sickle claws of the pedal digit II‚Äîin a manner very similar to extant accipitrid birds of prey. Like accipitrids, the dromaeosaurid would then begin to feed on the animal while still alive, until it eventually died from blood loss and organ failure. This proposal is based primarily on comparisons between the morphology and proportions of the feet and legs of dromaeosaurids to several groups of extant birds of prey with fairly known predatory behaviors. Fowler and collaegues found that the feet and legs of dromaeosaurids most closely resemble those of eagles and hawks, especially in terms of having an enlarged second claw and a similar range of grasping motion, but the short metatarsus and foot strength would have been more similar to that of owls. The RPR model would be consistent with other aspects of dromaeosaurid anatomy, such as their unusual dentition and arm morphology. The arms were covered in long feathers and may have been used as flapping stabilizers for balance while atop a struggling prey, along with the stiff counter-balancing tail. Lastly, the comparatively weak jaws would have been useful for eating prey alive but not as useful for forceful dispatch of the prey. Life restoration showing the reduced sickle claw; Adasaurus may have used this appendage with less frequency than other dromaeosaurids In 2019, Peter Bishop reconstructed the leg skeleton and musculature of Deinonychus by using three-dimensional models of muscles, tendons, and bones. With the addition of mathematical models and equations, Bishop simulated the conditons that would provide maximum force at the tip of the sickle claw and therefore the most likely function. Among the proposed modes of the sickle claw use are: kicking to cut, slash or disembowel prey; for gripping onto the flanks of prey; piercing aided by body weight; to attack vital areas of the prey; to restrain prey; intra- or interspecific competition; and digging out prey from hideouts. The results obtained by Bishop showed that a crouching posture increased the claw forces, however, these forces remained relatively weak indicating that the claws were not strong enough to be used in slashing strikes. Rather than being used for slashing, the sickle claws were more likely to be useful in flexed leg angles such as restraining prey and stabbing prey at close quarters. These results are consistent with the \\"Fighting Dinosaurs\\" specimen, which preserves a Velociraptor and Protoceratops locked in combat, with the former gripping onto the other with its claws in a non-extended leg posture. Despite the obtained results, Bishop considered that the capabilities of the sickle claw could have varied within taxa. Among dromaeosaurids, Adasaurus had an unusually smaller sickle claw that retained the characteristic ginglymoid‚Äîa structure divided in two parts‚Äîand hyperextensible articular surface of the penultimate phalange. He could neither confirm nor disregard that the pedal digit II could have loss or retain its functionally. Moreover, Kubota and Barsbold previously stated that the highly reduced sickle claw of Adasaurus may have been used with less frequency than other deinonychosaurs as the bottom surface of lower heel on the penultimate phalanx has no apparent asymmetrical ridges like other dromaeosaurids and troodontids. Paleoenvironment Adasaurus is known from the Late Cretaceous Nemegt Formation, the age of which has been considered from the Late Campanian to Early-Middle Maastrichtian stages, about 70 million and 68 million years ago. The environments that were present on the formation included stream and river channels, mudflats, and shallow lakes. Much of the sedimentation also indicates that a rich habitat existed, offering extensive vegetation in abundant amounts that could sustain most herbivorous dinosaurs. Most fluvial systems functioned as oases for oviraptorosaurs. Other dinosaurs found in this formation include the ornithomimosaurs Anserimimus, Gallimimus, and a taxon that remains unnamed; diverse oviraptorosaurs such as Nemegtomaia, Elmisaurus and Gobiraptor; and the troodontid Zanabazar. Large dinosaurs in this formation are represented by Deinocheirus, Saurolophus, Tarbosaurus and Therizinosaurus.

Plot The story focuses on Jane Marks, her adult daughters Michelle and Elizabeth, and her pre-teen adopted African American daughter Annie, each of whom allows her personal insecurities to affect her life. Jane, longing to look younger and thinner, opts for liposuction, with near tragic results. When Michelle's artistic talents fail to produce any income for her family, much to the dismay of her husband Bill, she takes a job as a one-hour photo developer and finds herself falling for the attention of her teenaged co-worker Jordan. Aspiring actress Elizabeth, who bestows upon stray dogs the affection she finds difficult to offer her boyfriend Paul, questions her appeal when she's rejected for a role based on her looks, and she seeks reassurance from film heartthrob Kevin McCabe. Overweight Annie tries to fit in better with her white adopted family by having her hair straightened by black Big Sister volunteer Lorraine, who Jane hopes will put the young girl in touch with her heritage. –°ast  Production The film debuted at the 2001 Telluride Film Festival.

It is owned by Emmis Communications and broadcasts a talk radio format. The studios are located at 40 Monument Circle in downtown Indianapolis. The transmitter and antenna are located near South Post Road and Burk Road on the far east side of Indianapolis. The station airs mostly local conservative talk shows on weekdays, with several nationally syndicated programs, including Dana Loesch, Chad Benson, Coast to Coast AM with George Noory and on weekends Kim Komando and Bill Cunningham. Weekends also feature shows on money, health, gardening, computers and guns. Some weekend hours are paid brokered programming. Some hours begin with world and national news from Fox News Radio. For nearly seven decades, WIBC broadcast on the AM radio frequency of 1070 kHz. On December 26, 2007, WIBC's call letters and talk programming moved to the FM dial at co- owned 93.1 MHz. Also on that date, the 1070 kHz frequency took the call sign WFNI and began an all-sports format as \\"1070 The Fan\\". WIBC broadcasts in HD, using its HD-2 signal for WFNI's local sports format, also heard on translator 107.5 W298BB. WIBC's HD-3 signal carries the national ESPN Radio Network. History =Early years and heyday as WNAP= Offices of WIBC 93.1 FM in Indianapolis first signed on as WIBC-FM on December 5, 1960. It aired an automated classical music format. On July 22, 1968, the station was re- launched as WNAP. It was the first FM station in the Indianapolis market to broadcast a mix of album-oriented rock and Top 40 hits, better known as \\"Rock 40\\"‚Äîan ancestor of the CHR format, and was in direct competition with Top 40 leader 1310 WIFE. In 1970, WNAP began broadcasting in stereo. According to the documentary film Naptown Rock Radio Wars,http://www.naptownrockradiowars.com/ station and program managers from across the United States came to Indianapolis to listen to WNAP in order to figure out the unique style of \\"The Buzzard\\" so they could emulate its success at their own stations. The classic top of the hour station identification from this era featured the sound of two thunderbolts and the distinctive voice of WIBC's Chuck Riley, brother of WNAP's DJ Michael D. \\"Buster Bodine\\" Hanks, intoning the phrase, \\"The wrath of The Buzzard! WNAP, Indianapolis\\". Later in the 1970s and early 1980s, the station was rebranded as \\"WNAP Stereo 93 FM, The Buzzard\\". =Demise of The Buzzard= On March 4, 1986, suffering from a fall in ratings due to competition from WFBQ (Q-95), the format of 93.1 was changed to a rock-driven hot adult contemporary format, and the call letters became WEAG with branding as \\"Eagle 93.\\" The format was later changed to classic hits with the call letters WKLR on August 14, 1987. On April 1, 1988, WKLR changed from classic hits to oldies. Among WKLR's disc jockeys was WIBC newsman Steve Simpson. WNAP returned at 5:00 p.m. on September 9, 1994, when WKLR was changed back to a classic hits station with a strong focus on the \\"greatest hits of the 70s.\\"http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-09-16.pdf This incarnation of WNAP later moved in a more classic rock direction playing \\"classic rock that really rocks\\", with the syndicated Howard Stern Show carried in the morning in what was a futile attempt to compete with WFBQ's locally-dominant Bob and Tom Show. Despite on- air boasts that WNAP was going to \\"kick Q-95's ass\\", the classic rock format was a failure. =Radio Now 93.1= After weeks of stunting, WNAP changed to contemporary hits on March 28, 2000, at 6:00 a.m., with new call letters WNOU and the name \\"Radio Now.\\"http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2000/RR-2000-03-31.pdf Radio Now's first song was \\"The Rockafeller Skank\\" by Fatboy Slim. The station received some national notice in November 2004, when its morning show conducted the first interview with Indiana Pacers player Ron Artest following the Pacers‚ÄìPistons brawl. Orbital 93.1 In 2006, WNOU launched an HD-2 subchannel, dubbed \\"Orbital 93.1\\", which offered a rhythmic contemporary format with emphasis on current and classic dance music. On October 9, 2007, Orbital was discontinued, being replaced with the Radio NOW format for one day after the format ended on 93.1, and before it moved to 100.9, serving as a buffer for the format.http://www.hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=41 HD Radio Guide for Indianapolis =WIBC moves to FM= On October 8, 2007, at Noon, after playing \\"When You're Gone\\" by Avril Lavigne, 93.1 began stunting with Christmas music under new temporary call sign WEXM, being promoted as \\"The 93 Days of Christmas.\\" The Christmas format was a place holder as part of the transition to moving the talk programming from 1070 AM to 93.1 FM. Initially planned to last 93 days, from October 8 to January 8, the change-over was moved up to December 26. The switch came after Emmis acquired local radio rights to the Indianapolis Colts football team. To prevent frequent preemption of programming and tedious shufflings of games on its stations, it was decided to move WIBC to the FM frequency immediately after Christmas, and make 1070 AM a sports station as \\"AM 1070 The Fan\\", with its call sign changing to WFNI. This time the \\"-FM\\" suffix was not required on 93.1's call sign, since there would no longer be a WIBC on the AM band. Upon the demise of \\"Radio Now\\", Radio One purchased the intellectual property of the station from Emmis Communications. Two days later, on October 10, the \\"Radio Now\\" branding, format and logo were installed on the new 100.9 WNOU (formerly WYJZ, now WNOW- FM). Local Radio One management said that they would offer the displaced staffers of 93.1 WNOU the first chance of joining the new station's lineup, and would use the same imaging as the former WNOU at 93.1. Emmis also stated that they would release displaced RadioNow staffers from their \\"non-compete\\" contracts. The WNAP call letters are now used at a gospel-formatted AM station licensed in Norristown, Pennsylvania, serving the Philadelphia market. Programming =Local news and talk= As of 2017, WIBC broadcasts four daily local programs: \\"The Morning News with Tony Katz\\", \\"Chicks on the Right\\", \\"Tony Katz Today\\" and \\"The Hammer and Nigel Show.\\" Joe Staysniak appears from time to time. He had moved to the morning show in October 2008. He replaced Jake Query, who in turn replaced longtime WIBC fixture Jeff Pigeon (referred to as \\"Pidge\\" by the staff and listeners), who left the station October 1, 2007. Pigeon had been WIBC's morning host since taking over for Gary Todd in 1988, and prior to that had hosted the 7:00 p.m.-midnight shift when WIBC was still a full-service/music station. (Pigeon later resurfaced at oldies station WKLU.) Staysniak previously co-hosted in the afternoon with Dave \\"the King\\" Wilson, whose show launched in the mid-1990s but ended in March 2009 due to budgetary cutbacks. At that time, Simpson's show moved from 6:00‚Äì8:00 p/m/ to 3:00‚Äì7:00 p.m. WIBC previously had a media partnership with local ABC affiliate WRTV, but as of October 1, 2018, has since been replaced with WISH-TV as the media partner, with WISH providing news reports as well as hourly weather updates on the top of the hour. In addition, a radio simulcast of WISH-TV's morning newscast, News 8 Daybreak, is heard from 5:00 to 6:00 a.m. =Local sports= WIBC was the AM flagship station of the NFL's Indianapolis Colts, simulcasting the games with sister station WLHK. In addition, WIBC was the flagship for the NBA's Indiana Pacers and the WNBA's Indiana Fever, and for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network, carrying the Indianapolis 500 since the network's creation in 1952, and the NASCAR Brickyard 400 since that race's 1994 debut. WIBC also aired Indiana University football. Most of WIBC (AM)'s sports properties remained at 1070 WFNI when WIBC moved to FM (with WLHK remaining the FM outlet for the Colts and for IndyCar). However, on June 22, 2010, the Pacers announced an extension of their broadcast agreement with Emmis Communications which included their games moving to FM and back to WIBC, beginning in the 2010‚Äì11 season. Beginning with the 2011‚Äì12 basketball season, WIBC replaced WLHK as the Indianapolis broadcast home of Indiana University basketball. In case of a conflict, Pacers games move to WFNI for the night. Additionally, WIBC aired Butler University basketball, IndyCar races and high school championship events that are bumped from WFNI due to conflicts. =Syndicated talk= On April 13, 2015, WIBC announced the station was dropping Rush Limbaugh. Charlie Morgan, an executive for Emmis, indicated that the decision to drop Limbaugh was about the \\"long- term direction of the station\\", but also acknowledged that there was a \\"business element to the decision\\".Emmis And Premiere Networks End Partnership In Indianapolis WMBF News 13 April 2015 Limbaugh's weekday show moved to 1260 WNDE, which is owned by iHeartMedia, the parent company of Limbaugh's syndicator Premiere Networks.

After Pushkin's death in 1837, Pletnyov edited his literary journal Sovremennik until the latter was sold to Nikolai Nekrasov in 1846. As a critic, he was strongly opposed to Vissarion Belinsky and like-minded journalists who placed \\"progressive ideas\\" above the artistic mastership. With Sergey Uvarov's support, Pletnyov gained many teaching assignments, in and around Saint Petersburg, including in the end a tutor's post to the future Alexander II. His non-partisan view of various literary movements helped him to single out and applaud all of the most gifted writers of the day, from Vasily Zhukovsky through Nikolai Gogol to Fyodor Dostoevsky. 1792 births 1865 deaths People from Bezhetsky District People from Bezhetsky Uyezd Imperial Russian poets Russian male poets Imperial Russian philologists Imperial Russian journalists Russian male journalists Imperial Russian male writers Full Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences 19th-century Russian writers 19th-century poets 19th-century Russian male writers Burials at Tikhvin Cemetery ","title":"Pyotr Pletnyov"},{"id":"2958224","text":"Wollstonecraft's name A Vindication of the Rights of Men, in a Letter to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke; Occasioned by His Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) is a political pamphlet, written by the 18th-century British liberal feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, which attacks aristocracy and advocates republicanism. Wollstonecraft's was the first response in a pamphlet war sparked by the publication of Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), a defense of constitutional monarchy, aristocracy, and the Church of England. Wollstonecraft attacked not only hereditary privilege, but also the rhetoric that Burke used to defend it. Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as his theatrical pity for Marie Antoinette, but Wollstonecraft was unique in her love of Burke's gendered language. By saying the sublime and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1756), she kept his rhetoric as well as his argument. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia Johnson describes as unsurpassed in its argumentative force,Johnson, 27; see also, Todd, 165. Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's justification of an equal society founded on the passivity of women. In her arguments for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos in opposition to what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Driven by an Enlightenment belief in progress, she derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family has a farm sufficient for its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she claims is genuine feeling, with Burke's false theatrical tableaux. The Rights of Men was successful: it was reviewed by every major periodical of the day and the first edition, published anonymously, sold out in three weeks. However, upon the publication of the second edition (the first to carry Wollstonecraft's name on the title page), the reviews began to evaluate the text not only as a political pamphlet but also as the work of a female writer. They contrasted Wollstonecraft's \\"passion\\" with Burke's \\"reason\\" and spoke condescendingly of the text and its female author. This remained the prevailing analysis of the Rights of Men until the 1970s, when feminist scholars revisited Wollstonecraft's texts and endeavoured to bring greater attention to their intellectualism. Historical context =Revolution Controversy= Tennis Court Oath (1791) by Jacques- Louis David A Vindication of the Rights of Men was written against the backdrop of the French Revolution and the debates that it provoked in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now referred to as the Revolution Controversy, which lasted from 1789 until the end of 1795, British political commentators argued over the validity of monarchy. One scholar has called this debate \\"perhaps the last real discussion of the fundamentals of politics in [Britain]\\".Qtd. in Butler, 1. The power of popular agitation in revolutionary France, demonstrated in events such as the Tennis Court Oath and the storming of the Bastille in 1789, reinvigorated the British reform movement, which had been largely moribund for a decade. Efforts to reform the British electoral system and to distribute the seats in the House of Commons more equitably were revived.Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xi‚Äìxii. Much of the vigorous political debate in the 1790s was sparked by the publication of Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France in November 1790. Most commentators in Britain expected Burke to support the French revolutionaries, because he had previously been part of the liberal Whig party, a critic of monarchical power, a supporter of the American revolutionaries, and a prosecutor of poor governance in India. When he failed to do so, it shocked the populace and angered his friends and supporters.Butler, 33; Kelly, 85. Burke's book, despite being priced at an expensive three shillings, sold an astonishing 30,000 copies in two years.Butler, 34‚Äì35. Thomas Paine's famous response, The Rights of Man (1792), which became the rallying cry for thousands, however, greatly surpassed it, selling upwards of 200,000 copies.Butler, 108. Wollstonecraft's Rights of Men was published only weeks after Burke's Reflections. While Burke supported aristocracy, monarchy, and the Established Church, liberals such as William Godwin, Paine, and Wollstonecraft, argued for republicanism, agrarian socialism, anarchy, and religious toleration.Butler, 1. Most of those who came to be called radicals supported similar aims: individual liberties and civic virtue. They were also united in the same broad criticisms: opposition to the bellicose \\"landed interest\\" and its role in government corruption, and opposition to a monarchy and aristocracy who they believed were unlawfully seizing the people's power.Butler, 3‚Äì4. 1792 was the \\"annus mirabilis of eighteenth-century radicalism\\": its most important texts were published and the influence of radical associations, such as the London Corresponding Society (LCS) and the Society for Constitutional Information (SCI), was at its height.Butler, \\"Introductory essay\\", 7; see also Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xii. However, it was not until these middle- and working-class groups formed an alliance with the genteel Society of the Friends of the People that the government became concerned. After this alliance was formed, the conservative- dominated government prohibited seditious writings. Over 100 prosecutions for sedition took place in the 1790s alone, a dramatic increase from previous decades.Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xiii. The British government, fearing an uprising similar to the French Revolution, took even more drastic steps to quash the radicals: they made ever more political arrests and infiltrated radical groups; they threatened to \\"revoke the licences of publicans who continued to host politicised debating societies and to carry reformist literature\\"; they seized the mail of \\"suspected dissidents\\"; they supported groups that disrupted radical events; and they attacked dissidents in the press.Keen, 54. Radicals saw this period, which included the 1794 Treason Trials, as \\"the institution of a system of TERROR, almost as hideous in its features, almost as gigantic in its stature, and infinitely more pernicious in its tendency, than France ever knew.\\"Qtd. in Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxi. When, in October 1795, crowds threw refuse at George III and insulted him, demanding a cessation of the war with France and lower bread prices, Parliament immediately passed the \\"gagging acts\\" (the Seditious Meetings Act and the Treasonable Practices Act, also known as the \\"Two Acts\\"). Under these new laws, it was almost impossible to hold public meetings and speech was severely curtailed at those that were held.Barrell and Mee, \\"Introduction\\", xxxv; Keen, 54. British radicalism was effectively muted during the later 1790s and 1800s. It was not until the next generation that any real reform could be enacted.Butler, \\"Introductory essay\\", 3. =Burke's Reflections= Published partially in response to Dissenting clergyman Richard Price's sermon celebrating the French revolution, A Discourse on the Love of Our Country, Burke used the device of a mock-letter to a young Frenchman's plea for guidance in order to defend aristocratic government, paternalism, loyalty, chivalry, and primogeniture. He viewed the French Revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections, he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government, because civilizations, including governments, are the result of social and political consensus. If a culture's traditions were continually challenged, he contends, the result would be anarchy. Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) Burke criticizes many British thinkers and writers who welcomed the early stages of the French Revolution. While the radicals likened the revolution to Britain's own Glorious Revolution in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argues that the appropriate historical analogy was the English Civil War (1642‚Äì1651), in which Charles I had been executed in 1649.Butler, 1‚Äì2; 33‚Äì34. At the time Burke was writing, however, there had been very little revolutionary violence; more concerned with persuading his readers than informing them, he greatly exaggerated this element of the revolution in his text for rhetorical effect. In his Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful, he had argued that \\"large inexact notions convey ideas best\\", and to generate fear in the reader, in Reflections he constructs the set-piece of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette forced from their palace at sword point. When the violence actually escalated in France in 1793 with the Reign of Terror, Burke was viewed as a prophet.Butler, 33‚Äì34. Burke also criticizes the learning associated with the French philosophes; he maintains that new ideas should not, in an imitation of the emerging discipline of science, be tested on society in an effort to improve it, but that populations should rely on custom and tradition to guide them. =Composition and publication of the Rights of Men= In the advertisement printed at the beginning of the Rights of Men, Wollstonecraft describes how and why she wrote it: So the pamphlet could be published as soon as she finished writing it, Wollstonecraft wrote frantically while her publisher Joseph Johnson printed the pages. In fact, Godwin's Memoirs of Wollstonecraft tells that the sheets of manuscript were delivered to the press as they were written.Godwin, ch. 6 Halfway through the work, however, she ceased writing. One biographer describes it as a \\"loss of nerve\\"; Godwin, in his Memoirs, describes it as \\"a temporary fit of torpor and indolence\\".Godwin, 73. Johnson, perhaps canny enough at this point in their friendship to know how to encourage her, agreed to dispose of the book and told her not to worry about it. Ashamed, she rushed to finish.Todd, 164; see also Johnson, 26. Wollstonecraft's Rights of Men was published anonymously on 29 November 1790, the first of between fifty and seventy responses to Burke by various authors.Furniss, 60; Taylor, 7; Sapiro, 23; Myers, 113. Only three weeks later, on 18 December, a second edition, with her name printed on the title page, was issued.Furniss, 60. Wollstonecraft took time to edit the second edition, which, according to biographer Emily Sunstein, \\"sharpened her personal attack on Burke\\" and changed much of the text from first person to third person; \\"she also added a non-partisan code criticising hypocritical liberals who talk equality but scrape before the powers that be.\\"Sunstein, 198. Structure and major arguments Edmund Burke, painted by the studio of Sir Joshua Reynolds (1771) Until the 1970s, the Rights of Men was typically considered disorganized, incoherent, illogical, and replete with ad hominem attacks (such as the suggestion that Burke would have promoted the crucifixion of Christ if he were a Jew).Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 43‚Äì44. It had been touted as an example of \\"feminine\\" emotion tilting at \\"masculine\\" reason.Johnson, 26; Myers, 114. However, since the 1970s scholars have challenged this view, arguing that Wollstonecraft employed 18th-century modes of writing, such as the digression, to great rhetorical effect. More importantly, as scholar Mitzi Myers argues, \\"Wollstonecraft is virtually alone among those who answered Burke in eschewing a narrowly political approach for a wide-ranging critique of the foundation of the Reflections.\\"Myers, 119. Wollstonecraft makes a primarily moral argument; her \\"polemic is not a confutation of Burke's political theories, but an exposure of the cruel inequities which those theories presuppose.\\"Myers, 129. Wollstonecraft's style was also a deliberate choice, enabling her to respond to Burke's Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful as well as to Reflections.Johnson, 26. The style of the Rights of Men mirrors much of Burke's own text. It has no clear structure; like Reflections, the text follows the mental associations made by the author as she was writing.Poovey, 58; Kelly, 88. Wollstonecraft's political treatise is written, like Burke's, in the form of a letter: his to C. J. F. DePont, a young Frenchman, and hers to Burke himself.Sapiro, 197. Using the same form, metaphors, and style as Burke, she turns his own argument back on him. The Rights of Men is as much about language and argumentation as it is about political theory; in fact, Wollstonecraft claims that these are inseparable.Sapiro, 197; Myers, 121; Kelly, 88‚Äì89. She advocates, as one scholar writes, \\"simplicity and honesty of expression, and argument employing reason rather than eloquence.\\" At the beginning of the pamphlet, she appeals to Burke: \\"Quitting now the flowers of rhetoric, let us, Sir, reason together.\\"Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 37. The Rights of Men does not aim to present a fully articulated alternative political theory to Burke's, but instead to demonstrate the weaknesses and contradictions in his own argument. Therefore, much of the text is focused on Burke's logical inconsistencies, such as his support of the American revolution and the Regency Bill (which proposed restricting monarchical power during George III's madness in 1788), in contrast to his lack of support for the French revolutionaries.Johnson, 26; see also, Poovey 58‚Äì59. In criticism of Burke's contradictory support of the Regency Bill along with supporting the rule of monarchy in France, she writes: Wollstonecraft's goal, she writes, is \\"to shew you [Burke] to yourself, stripped of the gorgeous drapery in which you have enwrapped your tyrannic principles.\\"Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 70; see also Myers, 120‚Äì21. However, she does also gesture towards a larger argument of her own, focusing on the inequalities faced by British citizens because of the class system.Sapiro, 82; Todd, 218; Kelly, 88. As Wollstonecraft scholar Barbara Taylor writes, \\"treating Burke as a representative spokesman for old-regime despotism, Wollstonecraft champions the reformist initiatives of the new French government against his 'rusty, baneful opinions', and censures British political elites for their opulence, corruption, and inhumane treatment of the poor.\\"Taylor, 64. Political theory =Attack against rank and privilege= Wollstonecraft's attack on rank and hierarchy dominates the Rights of Men. She chastises Burke for his contempt for the people, whom he dismisses as the \\"swinish multitude\\", and berates him for supporting the elite, most notably Marie Antoinette.Sapiro, 199; Jones, 49; Johnson, 28; Myers, 123‚Äì24. In a famous passage, Burke had written: \\"I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult.‚ÄîBut the age of chivalry is gone.\\"Qtd. in Butler, 44. Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) and An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution (1794) extend the specific arguments made in the Rights of Men into larger social and political contexts. Contrasting her middle-class values against Burke's aristocratic ones, Wollstonecraft contends that people should be judged on their merits rather than on their birthrights.Sapiro, 83; Kelly, 94‚Äì95. As Wollstonecraft scholar Janet Todd writes, \\"the vision of society revealed [in] A Vindication of the Rights of Men was one of talents, where entrepreneurial, unprivileged children could compete on equal terms with the now wrongly privileged.\\"Todd, 164. Wollstonecraft emphasizes the benefits of hard work, self-discipline, frugality, and morality, values she contrasts with the \\"vices of the rich\\", such as \\"insincerity\\" and the \\"want of natural affections\\".Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 95; see also Jones, 49; 51; Poovey, 65; Myers, 125. She endorses a commercial society that would help individuals discover their own potential as well as force them to realize their civic responsibilities.Jones, 51. For her, commercialism would be the great equalizing force.Jones, 53. However, several years later, in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796), she would question the ultimate benefits of commercialism to society. While Dissenting clergyman Richard Price, whose sermon helped spark Burke's work, is the villain of Reflections, he is the hero of the Rights of Men. Both Wollstonecraft and Burke associate him with Enlightenment thinking, particularly the notion that civilization could progress through rational debate, but they interpret that stance differently. Burke believed such relentless questioning would lead to anarchy, while Wollstonecraft connected Price with \\"reason, liberty, free discussion, mental superiority, the improving exercise of the mind, moral excellence, active benevolence, orientation toward the present and future, and the rejection of power and riches\\"‚Äîquintessential middle-class professional values.Myers, 118; Kelly, 93. Wollstonecraft wields the English philosopher John Locke's definition of property (that is, ownership acquired through labour) against Burke's notion of inherited wealth. She contends that inheritance is one of the major impediments to the progress of European civilization,Sapiro 84; see also, Jones, 49‚Äì50; Sapiro, xx; Furniss, 60; Kelly, 91. and repeatedly argues that Britain's problems are rooted in the inequity of property distribution. Although she did not advocate a totally equal distribution of wealth, she did desire one that was more equitable.Sapiro, 90. =Republicanism= Shepherd in the Alps by Claude Joseph Vernet; an idyllic rural life is part of the political utopia Wollstonecraft depicts in the Rights of Men. The Rights of Men indicts monarchy and hereditary distinctions and promotes a republican ideology. Relying on 17th- and early 18th-century notions of republicanism, Wollstonecraft maintains that virtue is at the core of citizenship. However, her notion of virtue is more individualistic and moralistic than traditional Commonwealth ideology. The goals of Wollstonecraft's republicanism are the happiness and prosperity of the individual, not the greatest good for the greatest number or the greatest benefits for the propertied.Jones, 43; Sapiro, xx; Johnson, 25; Kelly, 90‚Äì91. While she emphasizes the benefits that will accrue to the individual under republicanism, she also maintains that reform can only be effected at a societal level. This marks a change from her earlier texts, such as Original Stories from Real Life (1788), in which the individual plays the primary role in social reform.Todd, 166. Wollstonecraft's ideas of virtue revolved around the family, distinguishing her from other republicans such as Francis Hutcheson and William Godwin.Jones, 44‚Äì46. For Wollstonecraft, virtue begins in the home: private virtues are the foundation for public virtues.Sapiro, 216. Inspired by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's depictions of the ideal family and the republican Swiss canton, she draws a picture of idyllic family life in a small country village. One scholar describes her plan this way: \\"vast estates would be divided into small farms, cottagers would be allowed to make enclosures from the commons and, instead of alms being given to the poor, they would be given the means to independence and self- advancement.\\"Jones, 45. Individuals would learn and practice virtue in the home, virtue that would not only make them self-sufficient, but also prompt them to feel responsible for the citizens of their society. =Tradition versus revolution= One of the central arguments of Wollstonecraft's Rights of Men is that rights should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, not because they are traditional. While Burke argued that civil society and government should rely on traditions which had accrued over centuries, Wollstonecraft contends that all civil agreements are subject to rational reassessment. Precedence, she maintains, is no reason to accept a law or a constitution. As one scholar puts it, \\"Burke's belief in the antiquity of the British constitution and the impossibility of improvement upon a system that has been tried and tested through time is dismissed as nonsense. The past, for Wollstonecraft, is a scene of superstition, oppression, and ignorance.\\"Furniss, 61. Wollstonecraft believed powerfully in the Enlightenment notion of progress, and rejected the contention that ancient ideas could not be improved upon.Todd, 164; Kelly, 91‚Äì92. Using Burke's own architectural language, she asks, \\"why was it a duty to repair an ancient castle, built in barbarous ages, of Gothic materials?\\"Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 75. She also notes, pointedly, that Burke's philosophy condones slavery:Sapiro, 209; Kelly, 92. Sensibility Marie Antoinette, painted by √âlisabeth-Louise Vig√©e-Le Brun (1783); Wollstonecraft attacks Burke for his self-indulgent sympathy for the French queen. In the Rights of Men, Wollstonecraft not only endorses republicanism, but also a social contract based on sympathy and fellow-feeling. She describes the ideal society in these terms: individuals, supported by cohesive families, connect with others through rational sympathy. Strongly influenced by Price, whom she had met at Newington Green just a few years earlier, Wollstonecraft asserts that people should strive to imitate God by practicing universal benevolence.Jones, 48. Embracing a reasoned sensibility, Wollstonecraft contrasts her theory of civil society with Burke's, which she describes as full of pomp and circumstance and riddled with prejudice.Jones, 48; Myers, 125‚Äì26. She attacks what she perceives as Burke's false feeling, countering with her own genuine emotion. She argues that to be sympathetic to the French revolution (i.e., the people) is humane while to sympathize with the French clergy, as Burke does, is a mark of inhumanity.Furniss, 62; Kelly, 97. She accuses Burke not only of insincerity, but also of manipulation, claiming that his Reflections is propaganda.Todd, 163; Sapiro, 201‚Äì205. In one of the most dramatic moments of the Rights of Men, Wollstonecraft claims to be moved beyond Burke's tears for Marie Antoinette and the monarchy of France to silence for the injustice suffered by slaves, a silence she represents with dashes meant to express feelings more authentic than Burke's:Kelly, 98‚Äì99. Gender and aesthetics Mary Wollstonecraft, painted by John Opie (c. 1791) In the Rights of Men, Wollstonecraft challenges Burke's rhetoric as much as, or more, than his political theory. She begins by redefining the sublime and the beautiful, terms he had established in his Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful.Johnson, 26; Sapiro, 121‚Äì22; Kelly, 90; 97‚Äì98. While Burke associates the beautiful with weakness and femininity, and the sublime with strength and masculinity, Wollstonecraft writes, \\"for truth, in morals, has ever appeared to me the essence of the sublime; and, in taste, simplicity the only criterion of the beautiful.\\"Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 35. With this sentence, she calls into question Burke's gendered definitions; convinced that they are harmful, she argues later in the Rights of Men: As Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia Johnson has written, \\"As feminist critique, these passages have never really been surpassed.\\" Burke, Wollstonecraft maintains, describes womanly virtue as weakness, thus leaving women no substantive roles in the public sphere and relegating them to uselessness.Poovey, 62. Wollstonecraft applies this feminist critique to Burke's language throughout the Reflections. As Johnson argues, \\"her pamphlet as a whole refutes the Burkean axiom 'to make us love our country, our country ought to be lovely'\\"; Wollstonecraft successfully challenges Burke's rhetoric of the beautiful with the rhetoric of the rational.Johnson, 27; see also Myers, 127‚Äì28; Kelly, 90. She also demonstrates how Burke embodies the worst of his own ideas. He becomes the hysterical, illogical, feminine writer, and Wollstonecraft becomes the rational, masculine writer. Ironically, in order to effect this transposition, Wollstonecraft herself becomes passionate at times, for example, in her description of slavery (quoted above).Todd, 163; Taylor, 67. Reception and legacy Wollstonecraft to Catharine Macaulay along with a copy of the Rights of Men The Rights of Men was successful, its price contributing in no small measure: at one shilling and sixpence it was half the price of Burke's book. After the first edition sold out, Wollstonecraft agreed to have her name printed on the title page of the second. It was her first extensive work as \\"a self-supporting professional and self-proclaimed intellectual\\", as scholar Mary Poovey writes, and: Commentaries from the time note this; Horace Walpole, for example, called her a \\"hyena in petticoats\\" for attacking Marie Antoinette. William Godwin, her future husband, described the book as illogical and ungrammatical; in his Memoirs of Wollstonecraft, he dedicated only a paragraph to a discussion of the content of the work, calling it \\"intemperate\\".Godwin, 73; see also Todd, 168; Sapiro, 25. All the major periodicals of the day reviewed the Rights of Men. The Analytical Review agreed with Wollstonecraft's arguments and praised her \\"lively and animated remarks\\".Wardle, 120‚Äì21. The Monthly Review was also sympathetic, but it pointed out faults in her writing. The Critical Review, the \\"sworn foe\\" of the Analytical Review, however, wrote in December 1790, after discovering that the author was a woman: The Gentleman's Magazine followed suit, criticizing the book's logic and \\"its absurd presumption that men will be happier if free\\", as well as Wollstonecraft's own presumption in writing on topics outside of her proper domain, commenting \\"the rights of men asserted by a fair lady! The age of chivalry cannot be over, or the sexes have changed their ground.\\"Qtd. in Todd, 472, n.34; see also Wardle, 121. However, the Rights of Men put Wollstonecraft on the map as a writer; from this point forward in her career, she was well known.Myers, 113; Kelly, 84. Wollstonecraft sent a copy of the book to the historian Catharine Macaulay, whom she greatly admired. Macaulay wrote back that she was \\"still more highly pleased that this publication which I have so greatly admired from its pathos & sentiment should have been written by a woman and thus to see my opinion of the powers and talents of the sex in your pen so early verified.\\"Qtd. in Todd, 167. William Roscoe, a Liverpool lawyer, writer, and patron of the arts, liked the book so much that he included Wollstonecraft in his satirical poem The Life, Death, and Wonderful Achievements of Edmund Burke: Liberty Leading the People by Eug√®ne Delacroix (1833) While most of the early reviewers of the Rights of Men, as well as most of Wollstonecraft's early biographers, criticized the work's emotionalism, and juxtaposed it with Burke's masterpiece of logic, there has been a recent re- evaluation of her text. Since the 1970s, critics who have looked more closely at both her work and Burke's, have come to the conclusion that they share many rhetorical similarities, and that the masculine/logic and feminine/emotion binaries are unsupportable.Sapiro, 25; 186‚Äì87. Most Wollstonecraft scholars now recognize it was this work that radicalized Wollstonecraft and directed her future writings, particularly A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. It is not until after the halfway point of Rights of Men that she begins the dissection of Burke's gendered aesthetic; as Claudia Johnson contends, \\"it seems that in the act of writing the later portions of Rights of Men she discovered the subject that would preoccupy her for the rest of her career.\\" Two years later, when Wollstonecraft published the Rights of Woman, she extended many of the arguments she had begun in Rights of Men. If all people should be judged on their merits, she wrote, women should be included in that group.Sapiro, 83. In both texts, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that the virtue of the British nation is dependent on the virtue of its people. To a great extent, she collapses the distinction between private and public and demands that all educated citizens be offered the chance to participate in the public sphere.

There are also numerous extensive lava flows. Channels cross this terrain and some have an interesting bow shape to them. Aphrodite Terra also has mountain ranges but they are only about half the size of the mountains on Ishtar. Aphrodite Terra has two main regions: Ovda Regio in the west and Thetis Regio in the east. Ovda Regio has ridges running in two directions, suggesting that the compressive forces are acting in several directions. There are dark regions that appear to be solidified lava flows.

Ward's mother, Lukey Ward, was a political and civil rights activist, and Ward has often said publicly that he was born into politics. Lukey Ward was, along with her friend Georgia Davis, the day-to-day manager of the Kentucky chapter of Martin Luther King Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference. In fact, she was at the Lorraine Motel, waiting to go to dinner with Dr. King, when he was assassinated as he exited his room. Ward's father, Jasper Ward III, was a well-known award-winning architect in Louisville. His buildings include the Student Center at the University of Louisville and the Jewish Doctors Office Building at Interstate 65 and Liberty Street.

First, the institutions‚Äîpolice, government prosecutors' offices, courts, and correctional organs‚Äîmaintain close and cooperative relations with each other, consulting frequently on how best to accomplish the shared goals of limiting and controlling crime. Second, citizens are encouraged to assist in maintaining public order, and they participate extensively in crime prevention campaigns, apprehension of suspects, and offender rehabilitation programs. Finally, officials who administer criminal justice are allowed considerable discretion in dealing with offenders. In 2020, Japan ranked 9th in the sub-ranking \\"criminal justice\\" in the World Justice Project's Rule of Law Index, second highest among G7 countries. History Until the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the Japanese criminal justice system was controlled mainly by daimy≈çs. Public officials, not laws, guided and constrained people to conform to moral norms. In accordance with the Confucian ideal, officials were to serve as models of behavior; the people, who lacked rights and had only obligations, were expected to obey. Such laws as did exist were transmitted through local military officials in the form of local domain laws. Specific enforcement varied from domain to domain, and no formal penal codes existed. Justice was generally harsh, and severity depended upon one's status. Kin and neighbors could share blame for an offender's guilt: whole families and villages could be flogged or put to death for one member's transgression. (see Criminal punishment in Edo-period Japan for details) After 1868, the justice system underwent rapid transformation. The first publicly promulgated legal codes, the Penal Code of 1880 and the Code of Criminal Instruction of 1880, were based on French models, i.e. the Napoleonic code. Offenses were specified, and set punishments were established for particular crimes. Both codes were innovative in that they treated all citizens as equals, provided for centralized administration of criminal justice, and prohibited punishment by ex post facto law. Guilt was held to be personal; collective guilt and guilt by association were abolished. Offenses against the emperor were spelled out for the first time. Innovative aspects of the codes notwithstanding, certain provisions reflected traditional attitudes toward authority. The prosecutor represented the state and sat with the judge on a raised platform‚Äîhis position above the defendant and the defense counsel suggesting their relative status. Under a semi-inquisitorial system, primary responsibility for questioning witnesses lay with the judge, and defense counsel could question witnesses only through the judge. Cases were referred to trial only after a judge presided over a preliminary fact-finding investigation in which the suspect was not permitted counsel. Because in all trials available evidence had already convinced the court in a preliminary procedure, the defendant's legal presumption of innocence at trial was undermined, and the legal recourse open to his counsel was further weakened. The Penal Code was substantially revised in 1907 to reflect the growing influence of German law in Japan, and the French practice of classifying offenses into three types was eliminated. More important, where the old code had allowed very limited judicial discretion, the new one permitted the judge to apply a wide range of subjective factors in sentencing. After World War II, occupation authorities initiated reform of the constitution and laws in general. Except for omitting offenses relating to war, the imperial family, and adultery, the 1947 Penal Code remained virtually identical to the 1907 version. The criminal procedure code, however, was substantially revised to incorporate rules guaranteeing the rights of the accused. The system became almost completely accusatorial, and the judge, although still able to question witnesses, decided a case on evidence presented by both sides. The preliminary investigative procedure was suppressed. The prosecutor and defense counsel sat on equal levels, below the judge. Laws on indemnification of the wrongly accused and laws concerning juveniles, prisons, probation, and minor offenses were also passed in the postwar years to supplement criminal justice administration.  Criminal investigation  In the Empire of Japan, the criminal investigation was presided over by prosecutors, like the Minist√®re public does in French law. Then, with the 1947 Police Law and 1948 Code of Criminal Procedure, responsibility of investigations has been defined as uniquely resting with police officers. In order to fulfill this responsibility, criminal investigation departments were set up in each prefectural police department. After the establishment of the 1954 amended Police Law, these departments are supervised by the Criminal Affairs Bureau of the National Police Agency.  Criminal procedure  The nation's criminal justice officials follow specified legal procedures in dealing with offenders. Once a suspect is arrested by police officers, the case is turned over to attorneys in the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office, who are the government's sole agents in prosecuting lawbreakers. Under the Ministry of Justice's administration, these officials work under Supreme Court rules and are career civil servants who can be removed from office only for incompetence or impropriety. Prosecutors presented the government's case before judges in the Supreme Court and the four types of lower courts: high courts, district courts, summary courts, and family courts. Penal and probation officials administer programs for convicted offenders under the direction of public prosecutors (see Judicial System of Japan). After identifying a suspect, police have the authority to exercise some discretion in determining the next step. If, in cases pertaining to theft, the amount is small or already returned, the offense petty, the victim unwilling to press charges, the act accidental, or the likelihood of a repetition not great, the police can either drop the case or turn it over to a prosecutor. Reflecting the belief that appropriate remedies are sometimes best found outside the formal criminal justice mechanisms, in 1990 over 70 percent of criminal cases were not sent to the prosecutor. Juveniles Police also exercise wide discretion in matters concerning juveniles. Police are instructed by law to identify and counsel minors who appear likely to commit crimes, and they can refer juvenile offenders and non-offenders alike to child guidance centers to be treated on an outpatient basis. Police can also assign juveniles or those considered to be harming the welfare of juveniles to special family courts. These courts were established in 1949 in the belief that the adjustment of a family's situation is sometimes required to protect children and prevent juvenile delinquency. Family courts are run in closed sessions, try juvenile offenders under special laws, and operate extensive probationary guidance programs. The cases of young people between the ages of fourteen and twenty can, at the judgment of police, be sent to the public prosecutor for possible trial as adults before a judge under the general criminal law. Citizens =Arrest= Police have to secure warrants to search for or seize evidence. A warrant is also necessary for an arrest, although if the crime is very serious or if the perpetrator is likely to flee, it can be obtained immediately after arrest. Within forty-eight hours after placing a suspect under detention, the police have to present their case before a prosecutor, who is then required to apprise the accused of the charges and of the right to counsel. Within another twenty-four hours, the prosecutor has to go before a judge and present a case to obtain a detention order. Suspects can be held for ten days (extensions are granted in almost all cases when requested), pending an investigation and a decision whether or not to prosecute. In the 1980s, some suspects were reported to have been mistreated during this detention to exact a confession. These detentions often occur at cells within police stations, called daiyo kangoku. A suspect can be taken into custody after arrest and before prosecution for up to 23 days. =Prosecution= Prosecution can be denied on the grounds of insufficient evidence or on the prosecutor's judgment. Under Article 248 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, after weighing the offender's age, character, and environment, the circumstances and gravity of the crime, and the accused's rehabilitative potential, public action does not have to be instituted, but can be denied or suspended and ultimately dropped after a probationary period. Because the investigation and disposition of a case can occur behind closed doors and the identity of an accused person who is not prosecuted is rarely made public, an offender can successfully reenter society and be rehabilitated under probationary status without the stigma of a criminal conviction. =Inquest of prosecution= Institutional safeguards check the prosecutors' discretionary powers not to prosecute. Lay committees are established in conjunction with branch courts to hold inquests on a prosecutor's decisions. These committees meet four times yearly and can order that a case be reinvestigated and prosecuted. Victims or interested parties can also appeal a decision not to prosecute. =Trial= Most offenses are tried first in district courts before one or three judges, depending on the severity of the case. Defendants are protected from self-incrimination, forced confession, and unrestricted admission of hearsay evidence. In addition, defendants have the right to counsel, public trial, and cross-examination. Trial by jury was authorized by the 1923 Jury Law but was suspended in 1943. A new lay judge law was enacted in 2004 and came into effect in May 2009, but it only applies to certain serious crimes. The judge conducts the trial and is authorized to question witnesses, independently call for evidence, decide guilt, and pass sentence. The judge can also suspend any sentence or place a convicted party on probation. Should a judgment of not guilty be rendered, the accused is entitled to compensation by the state based on the number of days spent in detention. Criminal cases from summary courts, family courts, and district courts can be appealed to the high courts by both the prosecution and the defense. Criminal appeal to the Supreme Court is limited to constitutional questions and a conflict of precedent between the Supreme Court and high courts. The criminal code sets minimum and maximum sentences for offenses to allow for the varying circumstances of each crime and criminal. Penalties range from fines and short-term incarceration to compulsory labor and the death penalty. Heavier penalties are meted out to repeat offenders. Capital punishment consists of death by hanging and is usually imposed for multiple homicides. After a sentence is finalized, the only recourse for a convict to gain an acquittal is through a retrial. A retrial can be granted if the convicted person or their legal representative show reasonable doubt about the finalized verdict, such as clear evidence that past testimony or expert opinions in the trial were false.Ito, Masami, \\"Retrials high hurdle but sole tack for wrongfully convicted\\", Japan Times, 16 August 2011, p. 3. On average, it takes 3 months to get a final judgment for a first trial. Trial by lay judge The first trial by citizen judge, , began August 3, 2009 under a new law passed in 2004. Six citizens became lay judges and joined three professional judges to determine the verdict and sentence the defendant. Japan belongs to an inquisitory system of criminal process. Therefore, a judge oversees the proceedings and also determines the guilt and the sentence of the accused. The citizen lay judges as well as professional judges are allowed to put forth questions to defendants, witnesses and victims during the trial. The new system aims to invite participation of the wider community and also provide a speedier, more democratic justice system, according to Eisuke Sato, the justice minister. The first trial by lay judge lasted four days, while some comparable criminal cases may last years under the old system. The historic trial of 72-year-old Katsuyoshi Fujii, who stabbed his 66-year-old neighbor to death, had substantial media attention. The selected lay judges must be voters, at least 20 years old, and possess a secondary-level education. Professional lawyers and politicians may not serve as lay judges in the new system. At least one judge must concur with the majority vote from the lay judges in regards to a guilty verdict; however, a majority not-guilty verdict by the lay judges will stand. During the inaugural case, the citizens relied on the professional judges to help ascertain a sentence for the verdict decided upon, but felt confident in their interpretation of the trial arguments presented by the prosecution and defense. Conviction rate One of the main features of the Japanese criminal justice system well known in the rest of the world is its extremely high conviction rate, which exceeds 99%. Some in the common law countries argue that this is to do with elimination of the jury system in 1943, however, trials by jury were rarely held as the accused had to give up the right to appeal. Lobbying by human rights groups and the Japan Federation of Bar Associations resulted in the passing of a judicial reform bill in May, 2004, which introduced a lay-judge system in 2009, which is often confused with jury system in common law countries.Japan Human Rights Concerns , Amnesty International J. Mark Ramseyer of Harvard Law School and Eric B. Rasmusen of Indiana University examine if the accusation is in fact warranted. In their paper (\\"Why Is the Japanese Conviction Rate So High?\\") they examined two possibilities. One is that judges who come under the control of central bureaucracy are pressured to pass a guilty verdict, ensuring high conviction. Another possibility is that, given that the non-jury system under inquisition system has predictable ruling on guilt, Japan's understaffed prosecutors working on low budgets only bring the most obviously guilty defendants to trial, and do not file indictments in cases in which they are not certain they can win.Ramseyer & Rasmusen, \\"Why Is the Japanese Conviction Rate So High?\\" The most likely reason why the Japanese conviction rate is so high is that prosecutors have a broad discretion to prosecute or not, taking into account many factors (similar to sentencing factors in Western countries). The prosecutors may decide, for example, not to prosecute someone even if there is sufficient evidence to win at trial, because of the circumstances of the crime or accused. Article 248 of the Japanese Code of Criminal Procedure states: \\"Where prosecution is deemed unnecessary owing to the character, age, environment, gravity of the offense, circumstances or situation after the offense, prosecution need not be instituted.\\" Thus, prosecutors in Japan have a very broad discretion in the decision to prosecute or not. All Japanese court rulings are accessible in digital format; the two academics examined every case after World War II in which the court found the defendant not guilty. The result is mixed. Simple statistical analysis shows that the judge's later career tends to be negatively affected by a non-guilty verdict. However, by examining the individual cases, the two academics found that all of those cases which negatively affected judges' careers had political implications (such as labour law or electoral law) and that the facts of the case (i.e. the defendants committing the accused deed) itself were never in dispute. However, judges delivered 'not guilty' verdicts on technicalities such as statutes of limitation or constitutional arguments, which were subsequently reversed in a higher court. In cases in which the judge delivered a 'not guilty' verdict because they ruled that there was insufficient evidence to ascertain that the defendants did the accused deed, the judge suffered no negative consequence. For this reason, the paper argued that Japanese judges are politically conservative in legal interpretation but are not biased in matter of fact. In the matter relating to Japanese prosecutors being extremely cautious, the paper found ample evidence for it. In Japan, 99.7% of all the cases brought to court resulted in conviction, while in the U.S. the figure is 88%. According to a cited research, in the U.S. the accused contest guilt in 22% of federal cases and 11% of state cases, while in Japan, the ratio is modestly less. The paper attributes this difference to greater predictability of the outcome in Japanese cases. This is due to two reasons. One is that it is the judge rather than the jury who determines the verdict. As judges \\"have seen it all before\\" and the lawyers on both sides \\"have seen them seeing it\\", as they can read the judge's previous ruling (which includes written reasoning for the previous verdict), the way that the judge thinks and argues is very predictable. Secondly, Japanese trials before the institution of the current lay judge system, were discontinuous. The defense and the prosecutor would first gather in front of the judges and present the issue. Then, the court would enter recess and both sides would go back to prepare their case. As they reconvened on different dates, they would then present each case which the judges examined, the court would be put in recess again and each side would go back to gather further evidence. Some complex trials took years or even a decade to conclude which is impossible under jury system. During the questioning of evidence, judges were explicit about their opinions by the way they questioned the evidence, which gave greater predictability about the final verdict. For this reason, the prosecutor is far more likely to bring in the case where conviction is assured and the accused is far more likely to settle. Moreover, the paper found that Japanese prosecutors have a far more pressing need to be selective. In the U.S., the federal government employs 27,985 lawyers and the states employ another 38,242 (of which 24,700 are state prosecutors). In Japan, with about a third of U.S. population, the entire government employs a mere 2,000. Despite Japan having a low crime rate, such numbers create a significant case overload for prosecutors. In the U.S., there are 480 arrests (96 serious cases) per year per state prosecutor. (The actual figure is lower as some are prosecuted in federal court). In Japan, the figure is 700 per year per prosecutor. In the U.S., a rough estimate is that 42% of arrests in felony cases result in prosecution - while in Japan, the figure is only 17.5%. In murder, U.S. police arrested 19,000 people for 26,000 murders, in which 75% were prosecuted and courts convicted 12,000 people. In Japan, 1,800 people were arrested for 1,300 murders, but prosecutors tried only 43%. Had the allegation that Japanese prosecutors use weak evidence mostly based on (forced) confessions to achieve convictions been true, the larger proportion of arrests would have resulted in prosecutions and eventual conviction. But the opposite is true. In fact, the data indicates that Japanese prosecutors bring charges only when the evidence is overwhelming and likelihood of conviction is near absolute, which gives a greater incentive for the accused to confess and aim for a lighter sentence, which, in turn, results in a high rate for confession. The Japanese criminal justice system, despite retaining the death penalty, is relatively lenient in sentencing by the standard of the United States. Outside capital cases, many of those sentenced to life sentences are paroled within 15 years. Those convicted of less heinous murder and manslaughter are likely to serve less than 10 years. Those convicted of rape will often serve less than two to five years. It is even possible for someone convicted of murder to serve a suspended sentence if the defense successfully argues for mitigating circumstances. Moreover, in Japanese criminal proceedings the conviction and sentencing phase are separate. In the Japanese criminal justice system, these are distinct phases, echoing that of common law jurisdictions where sentencing is usually remitted to a later hearing after a finding of guilt. The court proceedings first determine guilt, then a second proceeding takes place to determine the sentence. Prosecutors and defense teams argue each phase. Defense lawyers, given the predictability of the outcome in term of guilt once the charge is brought, together with leniency of punishment (except in death penalty cases), often advise the accused to confess their guilt in trial. Remorse is seen as a mitigating factor which tends to bring reduced sentences. Confession in Japanese criminal investigation Many Western human rights organizations alleged that the high conviction rate is due to rampant use of conviction solely based on confession. Confessions are often obtained after long periods of questioning by police as those arrested may be held for up to 23 days. This can at times take weeks, during which the suspect is in detention and can be prevented from contacting a lawyer or family.BBC. \\"Assignment - Rough Justice in Japan\\". Sept. 13, 2007 (http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/docarchive/docarchive_20070913-1539.mp3) Article 38 of Japan's Constitution categorically requires that \\"no person shall be convicted or punished in cases where the only proof against a suspect is his/her own confession,\\" In practice, this constitutional requirement takes a form of safeguarding known as the \\"revelation of secret\\" (Himitsu no Bakuro, lit. \\"outing of secret\\"). Because suspects are put through continuous interrogation that could last up to 23 days, as well as isolation from the outside world - including access to lawyers, both the Japanese judiciary, and the public - it can be suggested that the court is well aware that confession of guilt can easily be forced. Consequently, the court (and the public) take the view that mere confession of guilt alone is never any sufficient ground for conviction. Many foreign people in Japan who are arrested cannot afford bail. Instead, for confession to be a valid evidence for conviction, the Japanese court requires confession to include revelation of verifiable factual matter that only the perpetrator of the crime could have known about, such as the location of an undiscovered body or the time and place the murder weapon was purchased, a fact about the crime scene, etc. Furthermore, to safeguard against the possibility that the interrogator has implanted such knowledge into the confession, the prosecutor must prove that such revelation of secret was unknown to the police until the point of confession. For example, in the 1948 Sachiura murder case, the conviction was initially secured by the confession of the location of the body, which was yet to be discovered. However, it later transpired that the police had likely known the location of the body, and this created a possibility that the confession of this information could've been forged and implanted by the investigating police. This resulted in the higher court declaring the confession unsafe and reversing the verdict. Activists claim that the Japanese justice system (and the Japanese public to some extent) consider that prolonged interrogation of a suspect in isolation without access to lawyers is justified to solve criminal cases without risking a miscarriage of justice. In addition, the requirement that the revelation of relevant information by the accused must be unknown to the police, and that the prosecutor must examine the police investigation before the case is brought to the court, is seen as an extra layer of safeguarding for the validity of confession as evidence. However, most miscarriage of justice cases in Japan are, indeed, the result of conviction solely based on the confession of the accused. In these case, (1) the record of sequence and timing of the police discoveries of evidence and the timing of confession is unclear (or even faked by the police) (2) the contents of the revelation of secret has only weak relevance to the crime itself or that (3) the revelation of secret is actually only so vague that it can only be loosely applied to the elements of the crime (Prosecutor's fallacy). Serious miscarriage of justice cases in Japan involve police deliberately faking the police evidence (and insufficient supervision by the prosecutor to spot such rogue behaviour) such as where the police already knew (or suspected) the location of the body or the murder weapon but they fake the police record to make it appear that it is the suspect who revealed the location. During the 1970s, a series of reversals to death penalty cases brought attention to the fact that some accused, after intensive interrogation, had signed \\"as-yet unwritten confessions\\", which were later actually filled in by investigating police officers. Moreover, in some cases, the police falsified the record so that it appeared that the accused confessed to the location of where the body was buried, yet the truth was that the police had written the location into the confession after the body was discovered by other means. These coerced confessions, together with other circumstantial evidence, often convinced judges to (falsely) convict. Currently the Japanese Federation of Bar Associations is calling for the entire interrogation phase to be recorded to prevent similar incidents occurring.\\"Interrogation of Criminal Suspects in Japan\\", International Bar Association, December 2003 The International Bar Association, which encompasses the Japanese Federation of Bar Associations, cited problems in its \\"Interrogation of Criminal Suspects in Japan\\". Former Japanese Minister of Justice, Hideo Hiraoka, has also supported videotaping interrogations. Police and prosecutors have traditionally been opposed to videotaping interrogations, stating that it would undermine their ability to get confessions. The current office of prosecutors has, however, reversed their previous opposition to this proposal. Proponents argue that without the credibility of confessions supported by electronic recordings, the lay judges may refuse to convict in a case when other offered evidence is weak. It is also argued that recording of interrogation may allow for standards to be lowered in the \\"revelation of secret\\" where the confession must contain an element of the crime that police and prosecutor did not know about. Once the recording is introduced, it would become impossible for the police to forge a confession. Then, it may become possible to bring conviction based on a confession of elements of the crime that only the perpetrator and the police knew. In October 2007, the BBC published a feature giving examples and an overview of \\"'Forced confessions' in Japan\\".BBC Hogg 'Forced confessions' in Japan. Monday, 29 October 2007 retrieved 26 December 2007 The case was called \\"Shibushi Case\\".Coerced confessions: Justice derailed in Japan - International Herald Tribune In addition, Hiroshi Yanagihara, who was convicted in November 2002 for attempted rape and rape due to forced confession and the identification by the victim despite an alibi based on the phone record, was cleared in October 2007 when the true culprit was arrested for an unrelated crime.Court acquits man but kept lid on forced confession Japan Times October 11, 2007 The two cases damage the credibility of Japanese Police. To Japanese citizens and police, however, the arrest itself already creates the presumption of guilt which needs only to be verified via a confession. The interrogation reports prepared by police and prosecutors and submitted to the trial courts often constitute the central evidence considered when weighing the guilt or innocence of the suspect.Otake, Tomoko, \\"Close Up: Fighter for Justice\\", Japan Times, 1 May 2011, pp. 7-8. Criticism Japan's criminal justice system is dubbed \\"hostage justice\\" (hitojichi-shiho) by critics. Due to extended detention (up to 23 days) and forced questioning of detainees without a lawyer and no right to remain silent. In order to meet the high confession rate it can cause false confessions and wrongful convictions. The detention is not only used to ensure that suspects appear in court. It violates the Constitution of Japan due to a lack of physical freedom, the right to remain silent and the right to a fair trial. Critics say prolonged detention and interrogations to get confessions is a form of torture. Thus international human rights are violated because there is no presumption of innocence, psychological torture is not prevented and there is often no council during interrogations.The latest criminal justice reforms in 2000s did not improve these flaws. Sometimes the interrogations are not in English so foreign detainees cannot understand it.

He was originally signed by the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League (CFL) as an undrafted free agent in 2001. He played college football for the Illinois State Redbirds and high school football at Detroit St. Martin de Porres. Glenn is a journeyman quarterback who is the only player to ever have had his rights held by every team in the CFL. College career Glenn played college football for the Illinois State Redbirds, where he set 25 school records during his four years there. He completed 645 of 1,119 pass attempts (57.6 percent) for 8,032 yards and 61 touchdowns, and also rushed 247 times for 490 yards and eight scores during his college career. He once tossed 101 straight passes without an interception and, in 1998, he led the Gateway Football Conference in passing yards per game, passer efficiency, and total offence. Glenn led Illinois State to its first playoff appearance in 1998. Professional career =Saskatchewan Roughriders= Glenn originally signed with the Saskatchewan Roughriders on June 8, 2001. He appeared in 18 regular-season games for Saskatchewan in the 2001 season; starting for six of those games. Glenn completed 70-of-154 pass attempts (45.5 percent) for 938 yards, two touchdowns and nine interceptions. He recorded 28 carries for 152 yards (5.4-yard average) and two touchdowns.Kevin Glenn Career Glenn played in 11 regular- season games in the 2002 season as well as the 2002 East Division Semifinal. He started three games on the season. He completed 60-of-95 passes (63.2%) for 777 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions. He rushed 21 times for 83 yards and one touchdown. Glenn entered free agency on February 17, 2003, but re-signed with the Roughriders on March 21, 2003. He dressed for all 18 regular-season games in the 2003 season plus the 2003 West Division Semifinal and the 2003 West Division Final. Glenn completed 40-of-his-73 pass attempts (54.8 per cent) for 508 yards, one touchdown and four interceptions. He also rushed 13 times for 48 yards and a 3.7-yard average. =Toronto Argonauts= On May 19, 2004, the Roughriders traded Glenn to the Toronto Argonauts for their best selection (third overall) in the 2005 CFL Draft, however later in the day, Glenn was traded to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers for their best selection in that draft (also the third overall selection). =Winnipeg Blue Bombers= In the 2004 season, Glenn played back-up to Khari Jones until Jones was traded mid-season. In 8 games that season Glenn passed for 2,329 yards on 274 attempts and 166 completions for an average of 14 yards. He also had 14 touchdown passes and eight interceptions. Glenn also rushed 30 times for 125 yards and two touchdowns. That season the Bombers finished with a disappointing record of 7-11, missing the playoffs The 2005 season was more successful for Glenn. Despite missing three games due to injury, Glenn had his best season as a Bomber. He completed 231 of 403 pass attempts (57.3 per cent) for 3,571 yards and 27 touchdowns. His 27 TD passes was third best in the CFL. He also rushed for one touchdown on October 10 versus the B.C. Lions. That October 10 game at Canad Inns Stadium was arguably Glenn's best single-game performance of his CFL career. He passed for 410 yards and five touchdowns, including four TD completions to slotback Milt Stegall. Glenn would go on to surpass the 300-yard passing mark on five occasions in 2005. Despite impressive numbers from Glenn the Bombers finished 5-13. The 2006 season was a year of great growth for Kevin. Though working in a brand new offensive system under new head coach Doug Berry, Glenn performed admirably. In a Week 8 game, Glenn slightly tore his ACL, but returned to the field to play his former team the Saskatchewan Roughriders in their Labour Day tilt. Glenn managed to lead the Bombers to their first playoff appearance in two years. Glenn emerged as one of the CFL's elite quarterbacks during the 2007 season. By week 7, Glenn had the league's best quarterback rating (107.3), and had thrown for 2078 yards and 11 touchdowns (with only 3 interceptions). However, by the end of the 2007 season, Glenn's quarterback rating had fallen to 93.2, making him 5th amongst starting quarterbacks, in the 8 team CFL. Glenn led Winnipeg to the 95th Grey Cup with a win in the East Division final defeating Toronto 19‚Äì9 before leaving the game due to a broken arm and causing him to miss the Grey Cup game, which the Bombers would ultimately lose. The 2008 Winnipeg Blue Bombers season started out poorly for Glenn with 976 yards, 2 touchdowns, 8 interceptions, a QB Rating of only 65.9, and 4 losses in 4 starts. He then lost his job to Ryan Dinwiddie who guided the team to their first win. After Dinwiddie led the team to its first win he started struggling and lost his next game and Glenn was given his job back. Glenn and the Bombers became the first team in CFL history to host and lose a playoff-crossover match. In the off-season quarterback Stefan LeFors was traded by Edmonton to Winnipeg in exchange for draft picks. Glenn was subsequently released on March 9, 2009. =Hamilton Tiger-Cats= Glenn signed with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on March 20, 2009. He began the 2009 season as the backup to Quinton Porter, but after Porter struggled during the season, Glenn took over as the starting quarterback. Glenn led the Ti-Cats to their first postseason appearance since 2004 with a record of 9-9. Hamilton was eliminated in overtime in the first round by the crossover BC Lions. In his second year as the starter Glenn led the Tiger-Cats to another 9-9 season this time to lose to the Toronto Argonauts in the first round. After a very strong year in 2010, Glenn saw his production decrease in 2011, throwing the same number of interceptions (17), but 13 fewer touchdowns. Head coach Marcel Bellefeuille elected to use a two- quarterback system for portions of the season which had Glenn sharing snaps with Quinton Porter. However, Glenn managed to lead the Hamilton Tiger-Cats to the playoffs for the third consecutive season with a record of 8-10 by starting 17 regular season games. =Calgary Stampeders= Kevin Glenn, shown on the sidelines during the Stampeders' final game against Edmonton for the 2013 season on October 18. During the game, Glenn passed Tom Clements to become Number 10 on the CFL's all time passing list.On January 3, 2012, Glenn was traded to the Calgary Stampeders along with Mark Dewit and a conditional draft pick for Henry Burris.https://www.cfl.ca/article/trading-places-burris- and-glenn-switch-sides Trading Places: Burris and Glenn switch sides Glenn was brought in by the Stamps to serve as a backup for starter Drew Tate. When Tate went down with a major injury in week 2 Glenn became the starter. Kevin Glenn went on to start the next 15 games for the Stampeders, winning 10 of them. His 67.9 percent completion rate during the 2012 campaign was the best of his career to that point.Fisher, Scott \\"He's A Keeper\\" Calgary Sun, September 19, 2012 Tate returned from injury and went back to starting status for the final two games of the regular season and the Western Division Semi-Finals. When Tate sustained a different injury in the Western Semi-Final, Glenn became the starter for the remainder of the 2012 playoffs. Glenn led the Stamps to victory over the BC Lions in the Western Final, but was unable to defeat the Toronto Argonauts in the 100th Grey Cup, losing 35-22.Glenn to start in Playoffs During the 2012 season, Glenn passed Dieter Brock on the CFL's all time passing yardage chart, surpassing Brock's total of 35,025 yards.Fisher, Scott \\"He's A Keeper\\" Calgary Sun, September 19, 2012 Glenn returned to the Stamps for the 2013 CFL season once again as a back up to Drew Tate. In similar fashion to the previous year Glenn came in relief of an injured Tate in Week 2 and was named the starter for Week 3 against the Alouettes due to Tate's injury.Getting a start in place of injured Tate. 2013 season Kevin Glenn started in Week 3 and 4 against the Montreal Alouettes, however, he was unable to finish the Week 4 game due to sustaining an elbow injury in the 3rd- quarter, sustained while taking a hit completing a 45-yard pass to Marquay McDaniel. On October 18, 2013, Glenn passed Tom Clements to become the 10th all-time leading quarterback in terms of passing yards.inagist.com posting Glenn played a total of 15 of the 18 regular season games in 2013, leading the Stamps to a league best record of 14-4, earning a first round bye. In the West-Final Glenn was pulled after the first half after struggling against the Roughriders. The Stamps lost the game, ending their season. =Ottawa Redblacks= On December 16, 2013, Glenn was drafted by the Ottawa Redblacks in the 2013 CFL Expansion Draft. Prior to the start of CFL free agency, the RedBlacks signed Henry Burris and named him the starter, leaving Glenn once again relegated to a backup role. On March 6, 2014, Glenn announced that he had requested to be traded, something he had discussed with the RedBlacks front office since the signing of Burris on February 4. Ottawa GM Marcel Desjardins had said that he would not release Glenn.Veteran QB Glenn asks expansion RedBlacks to trade him =BC Lions= On May 13, 2014, Glenn was traded to the BC Lions during the 2014 CFL Draft in exchange for the fifth overall pick in that draft. With Travis Lulay suffering a major injury, Kevin Glenn started in 17 of the 18 regular season games, and also in the Eastern Semi-Final. Based on QB passer rating statistic, the 2014 season was Glenn's worst passing season since his 2008 campaign with the Blue Bombers. The Lions finished the season fourth in the West Division, but qualified for the playoffs by virtue of the \\"crossover\\" rule and the fact their 9-9 record was marginally better than the 3rd-best team in the East. The Lions lost the East Division Semi-Final by a score of 50-17 and head coach Mike Benevides was fired less than a week later despite having had his contract extended to 2016. Glenn was not re-signed by the Lions and became a free agent on February 10, 2015. = Saskatchewan Roughriders (II) = On February 19, 2015, Glenn signed with the Saskatchewan Roughriders, returning him to the team where he began his professional career. Glenn was the backup quarterback on the depth chart and saw action in the first game of the season, when starting quarterback Darian Durant suffered a leg injury. It was revealed after the game that Durant had suffered a torn Achilles tendon, ending his season and making Glenn the starter. Glenn learned Chapdelaine's offensive scheme quickly and excelled, making Saskatchewan's offense the best in the league though the first four games of the season (all losses). Glenn played in 9 games for the Riders but the team struggled and quickly fell out of playoff contention. = Montreal Alouettes = On trade deadline day for the 2015 season (October 14, 2015), Glenn was traded by the Roughriders to the Montreal Alouettes, in exchange for a fifth-round pick in the 2016 CFL Draft. At the time of the trade, the Alouettes had a record of 5-9 tying them for the crossover playoff spot; whereas the Roughriders season was over after they had been officially eliminated from post-season contention. Glenn played in three of the final four games for the Alouettes to close out the season, however, he was not able to earn Montreal a playoff berth, losing the crossover to the BC Lions. Glenn began the 2016 season as the starting quarterback on a crowded depth chart that included the likes of; Rakeem Cato, Vernon Adams, Brandon Bridge and Jonathan Crompton. Glenn started the first two games of the season of the Alouettes, had a bye for the third week and missed the fourth week with an eye infection. Glenn started nine of the team's first ten games of the season, but only managed to win three of them. As a result, head coach Jim Popp announced Rakeem Cato would be the starting quarterback in Week 12, relegating Glenn to the backup role. = Winnipeg Blue Bombers (II) = On September 11, 2016, Glenn was traded to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers to serve as the back-up for Matt Nichols. He dressed for seven games for the Bombers while playing in one, completing two of his four pass attempts for 16 yards. Unable to come to terms on a new contract, the Bombers released Glenn about a month before he was set to become a free agent. =Saskatchewan Roughriders (III) = On January 23, 2017, Glenn signed a contract with the Saskatchewan Roughriders.Riders sign veteran pivot Kevin Glenn During training camp and preseason Glenn beat out Canadian quarterback Brandon Bridge, second year quarterback Bryan Bennett and former NFL quarterback Vince Young for the starting job: The latter two were released before the start of the season. Glenn was the Riders starting quarterback for most of the 2017 season, however in the last third of the season he began splitting snaps with Brandon Bridge. In early August Glenn surpassed Ron Lancaster moving into sixth place on the CFL's all-time passing yards list. On September 29, 2017, in his 197th game as a starting quarterback, Glenn recorded his 100th win (tying Matt Dunigan for the eight most all-time). Overall Glenn had a solid season for the Riders, leading the team to a 10-8 record and qualifying for the East division playoff via crossover. On January 3, 2018 the Riders acquired quarterback Zach Collaros, the following day they announced they had released Kevin Glenn. =Edmonton Eskimos= On January 15, 2018, the Edmonton Eskimos announced that they had signed Glenn to a one-year contract.https://twitter.com/EdmontonEsks/status/952956070154162182 Glenn's rights have now been held by every team in the Canadian Football League. On September 29, 2018, while serving as the backup quarterback to Mike Reilly, Glenn dressed for his 300th CFL game; trailing only Damon Allen (370) and Anthony Calvillo (329) for most games dressed by a quarterback. On June 12, 2019, his 40th birthday, Glenn retired from his playing career.https://www.cfl.ca/2019/06/12/kevin-glenn-retires-18-seasons/ =Future= With the potential revival of the Atlantic Schooners as the 10th CFL team, Glenn has joked that he may want to come out of retirement to sign a one-day contract with them to continue to hold on to his unique claim of having been part of every CFL team.https://edmontonsun.com/sports/football/cfl/edmonton-eskimos/jones-kevin- glenn-makes-every-stop-in-cfl In a straw poll, Schooner fans (in advance of the teams 2018 revival announcement prior to the 106th Grey Cup) said that they would want Glenn as a QB selection in an expansion draft if the team's revival comes to fruition.https://www.sportsnet.ca/football/cfl/cfl-may- finally-ready-welcome-atlantic-schooners/ Mid-way through the 2019 season the Blue Bombers (7‚Äì2 at the time) reached out to Glenn to see if he was interested in coming out of retirement following an injury to starting quarterback Matt Nichols; however, Glenn declined the offer although he did consider it \\"very tempting\\".

He found the Labour and Unemployed Association in 1934 to demand poverty relief work and a minimum wage. He was jailed for sedition in 1935. Personal life Antonio Soberanis was born to Mexican parents in the Belizean village of San Antonio Rio Hondo in Orange Walk. His family had move to Belize in 1894. He attended boys' school in Belize City and thereafter became a barber. He owned \\"The Panama Barbershop,\\" originally located on Handyside Street and then Queen Street in Belize City, which hosted many political discussions until it was boycotted in 1932 due to his political activities. He fathered ten children , first to Violet Garbutt married. Days of the LUA The decline of the mahogany trade, the Great Depression and the 1931 hurricane created terrible living conditions for the working class in British Honduras around 1934-35. With 1,800 registered unemployed in the country, an organization called the Unemployed Brigade demonstrated for more work and better pay. After meeting with colonial Governor Harold Baxter Kittermaster, the governor offered 80 more jobs and a feeding program of \\"rice lab\\" (a porridge of sugar and boiled rice) and bread cooked in the washing pots. Many leaders of the Unemployed Brigade gave up hope and resigned. Soberanis called them cowards. He said he would continue fighting for the cause and was not afraid to die. In his most famous quote, he said, \\"I'd rather be a dead hero than a living coward.\\" With his colleagues, he formed the Labor and Unemployed Association (LUA) which organized many boycotts, demonstrations and pickets against large merchants such as the B.E.C. (Belize Estate and Produce Company), John Harley and Co., Hofius and Hilderbrant, Melhado and Sons, and Brodies. The LUA held large demonstrations at the Battlefield Park, directly in front of the courthouse. At the meetings Soberanis campaigned for work for the unemployed and spoke against the Government. He also traveled to Dangriga and Corozal Town to encourage support for the cause of higher ages outside Belize City. On 1 October 1934, Soberanis organised the first labour strike at the B.E.C. sawmill. It turned into a riot, and the police arrested 17 people. When he went to post bail for those arrested at the strike, he was himself arrested. The police refused to grant him bail and held him for 35 days, which weakened the LUA and caused many other LUA leaders to leave the group. He replaced them and continued his activism. In 1935 the Government passed several new laws, including one banning criticism. When he made a speech in Corozal Town in October 1935 calling the large merchant stores \\"bloodsuckers\\" and the Governor and the King \\"crooks,\\" he was arrested again. He was charged with sedition, but was released after paying a BZ$25 fine. The efforts of the LUA yielded some good results: the wages of grapefruit dock workers in Dangriga were raised from 8 cents to 25 cents an hour; more men were employed to work on the Northern Highway following the receipt of a BZ$250,000 grant; and partial representation was granted to the elected officers in the Legislative Council. In addition, the LUA operated their own food program by organizing fundraising activities and collecting gifts from merchants and sympathizers who were not followers. They also operated a medical wing called the Red and Green Nurses, named after the colours of the LUA. The Nurses, headed by Cristobel Usher, dispensed free medical care to LUA members. Ending of the LUA The LUA movement was short-lived as there was infighting, leading to a split in the leadership. Soberanis's political activities continued up until 1942, when he left Belize to serve the British military in Panama. In 1950 the movement handed over their political followers to the newly formed People's Committee, now the People's United Party, and Soberanis became a councilor of the party. At the age of 78, Soberanis died and was buried at his farm in Santana Village.

Spelling suggestion features are commonly included in Internet search engines, word processors, spell checkers, medical transcription, automatic query reformulation, and frequency-log statistics reporting. Algorithms Any spell checker must have some data about the words in the target language, either in general usage or with specialized knowledge (like medical vocabulary). This can come from: * A dictionary of all known words. * A text corpus which includes typical text, known to be correctly spelled. * A list of frequently misspelled words, mapping errors to corrections. * Logs of human text input, such as from a popular search engine. This is essentially a crowdsourced corpus, but it is assumed there will be some spelling mistakes. Data might be included about when people click on a spelling suggestion or make a second, very similar query; this creates a crowdsourced mapping of misspelled words to reliable corrections.Search 101 - Google VP of Engineering and CIO Douglas Merrill A list of frequently misspelled words, possibly including multi-word phrases, can simply be consulted to see if any of the input words or phrases are listed. To make use of a dictionary without a pre- existing mapping from misspellings to corrections, the typical technique is to calculate the edit distance between an input word and any given word in the dictionary. The Levenshtein distance metric considers an \\"edit\\" to be the insertion, deletion, or substitution (with another letter) of one letter. The Damerau‚ÄìLevenshtein distance adds transpositions (the swapping of neighboring letters). Dictionary words that are an edit distance of 1 away from the input word are considered highly likely as corrections, edit distance 2 less likely, and edit distance 3 sometimes included in suggestions and sometimes ignored. A text corpus can be summed up as a dictionary of known words, with a frequency of appearance for each word. This can be used to sort the spelling suggestions. For example, if there are multiple suggestions of edit distance 1, the words that appear most frequently in the corpus are most likely to be the desired correction. Because a dictionary of known words is very large, calculating the edit distance between an input word and every word in the dictionary is computationally intensive and thus relatively slow.Edit distance Various data structures can be utilized to speed up storage lookups, such as BK-trees.Damn Cool Algorithms, Part 1: BK-Trees A faster approach adopted by Peter NorvigHow to Write a Spelling Corrector generates all the permutations from an input word of all possible edits. For a word of length n and an alphabet of size a, for edit distance 1 there are at most n deletions, n-1 transpositions, a*n alterations, and a*(n+1) insertions.1000x Faster Spelling Correction algorithm (2012) Using only the 26 letters in the English alphabet, this would produce only 54*n+25 dictionary lookups, minus any duplicates (which depends on the specific letters in the word). This is relatively small when compared to a dictionary of hundreds of thousands of words. However, tens or hundreds of thousands of lookups might be required for edit distance 2 and greater. A further innovation adopted by Wolf Garbe, known as SymSpell (\\"sym\\" as in \\"symmetry\\") speeds the input-time calculation by utilizing the fact that only permutations involving deletions need to be generated for input words if the same deletion permutations are per-calculated on the dictionary. The algorithms described so far do not deal well with correct words that are not in the dictionary. Common sources of unknown words in English are compound words and inflections, such as -s and -ing. These can be accommodated algorithmically, especially if the dictionary contains the part of speech. These algorithms have also assumed that all errors of a given distance are equally probable, which is not true. Errors that involve spelling phonetically where English orthography is not phonetic are common, as are errors that repeat the same letter or confuse neighboring letters on a QWERTY keyboard. If a large set of known spelling errors and corrections is available, this data can be used to generate frequency tables for letter pairs and edit types; these can be used to more accurately rank suggestions. It is also more common than chance for a word to be spelled in the wrong dialect compared to the rest of the text, for example due to American and British English spelling differences. Spelling suggestions can also be made more accurate by taking into account more than one word at a time. Multi-word sequences are known as n-grams (where n is the number of words in the sequence). A very large database of n-grams up to 5 words in length is available from Google for this and other purposes. Others have experimented with using large amounts of data and deep learning techniques (a form of machine learning to train neural networks to perform spelling correction.Deep SpellingAlgorithms and techniques for spell checking References Internet search engines Spell checkers ","title":"Spelling suggestion"},{"id":"2958355","text":"The Shubert Theatre is a Broadway theatre located at 225 West 44th Street in Midtown Manhattan. History and description Designed by architect Henry Beaumont Herts, it was named after Sam S. Shubert, the second oldest of the three brothers of the theatrical producing family. It shares a Venetian Renaissance facade with the adjoining Booth Theatre, which was constructed at the same time, although the two have distinctly different interiors. The two theatres are connected by a private road/sidewalk, \\"Shubert Alley\\". It opened on October 2, 1913 with Hamlet, starring Sir John Forbes-Robertson, followed by the October 21, 1913 opening of the George Bernard Shaw play, Caesar and Cleopatra, staged by the Forbes-Robertson Repertory Company. The theatre's longest tenant was A Chorus Line, which ran for 6,137 performances from 1975 to 1990 and set the record for longest running show in Broadway history. Later long runs have included Crazy for You (1992‚Äì1996), Chicago (1996‚Äì2003), Spamalot (2005‚Äì2009), Memphis (2009‚Äì2012) and Matilda the Musical (2013‚Äì2017). Hello, Dolly! achieved the box office record for the Shubert Theatre. The production grossed $2,403,482 over eight performances, for the week ending October 22, 2017. The theatre has also been a recurring venue for the Tony Awards. The top floor of the building houses the offices of the Shubert Organization.

The pipeline consists of two parallel lines, the larger, has a diameter of and the smaller one has a diameter of . The lines carry gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel fuel from Los Angeles, California refineries as far as Nellis Air Force Base south of North Las Vegas, Nevada. It carries approximately . Jet fuel from the pipeline is also delivered to the McCarran International Airport tank farm in Paradise. Additional terminal facilities are located in Barstow, California. The line was the sole source for the products it delivers to Las Vegas until the Unev pipeline began operating in 2012. UNEV provides access to refined oil products from Utah.  Accidents and incidents  On December 22, 1980, the pipeline carrying jet fuel ruptured in the Las Vegas Valley, near Tropicana Avenue, spilling fuel for 2 hours. Later, the fuel ignited, forcing road closures. One firefighter was overcome by fumes. Between of jet fuel were spilled. Prior construction in the area was suspected of damaging the pipeline. On May 25, 1989, The San Bernardino train disaster: The Calnev Pipeline ruptured in a San Bernardino, California neighborhood, due to damage from the cleanup of a train derailment, that occurred thirteen days earlier. The resulting gasoline fire killed two people, and destroyed eleven homes.  Impacts  = Environmental = In 2010, Kinder Morgan proposed an expansion project which would add a third, 16-inch pipeline to accompany the two existing pipelines. Several organizations, as well as state government agencies, responded to the CalNev Expansion Project such as the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and the Nevada Department of Wildlife. The project proposed building across Cajon Creek Conservation Area in San Bernardino which would affect over 20 sensitive species. Construction would alter the area's hydrological regime and pose a risk to the animals living in this area. Certain areas of the pipeline also require replacing depleted areas of cathodic protection, which protect the pipeline from rust and potential leaks. In 2015, the cathodic protection system of the pipeline that passes through the Mojave National Preserve needed to be repaired. This repair construction disrupts nearby habitats. However, to omit repair greatly increases the risk of an oil spill. =Route= The CalNev Pipeline begins in Los Angeles, California, runs through with terminal stops in San Bernardino County in the cities of Colton and Barstow and ends outside of Las Vegas, Nevada.  Regulations  = Current = All pipelines in the United States have to adhere to the regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). PHMSA sets regulations pertaining to the operation, construction, expansion of pipelines, which private pipeline companies have to adhere to, with federal and state inspectors enforcement. Calnev is an interstate pipeline crossing California and Nevada therefore it‚Äôs managed by PMHSA and inspected by federal agents. However, portions of pipeline exclusively within California or Nevada could be inspected by respective State agencies. In 2016, there were seven broad system-wide program inspections and two targeted investigations intended to scrutinize certain safety features in regards to the pipeline. According to PMHSA‚Äôs Pipeline Safety Stakeholder Communications data, Calnev has had one case in the last ten years in which PHMSA issued a Corrective Action Order in 2004 against Kinder Morgan in regards to a failure in Calnev Pipeline which released gasoline to its environment, an order that was marked closed in 2007. There was no proposed and collected penalty. = Future = Recently, President Donald Trump issued a key memorandum altering previous regulations regarding the construction of pipelines in the United States. Issued on January 24, 2017, this memorandum includes expediting the construction of future American pipelines, such as the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline, as well as high priority infrastructure projects. One of the key developments stated in this memorandum is that all future new and expanding pipelines to be constructed in the United States are to be built with materials ‚Äúproduced within the United States.\\" In which case, the Calnev expansion project would need to add a new section in their proposal explaining what materials would be used for construction for the current proposal does not address this. Other important new regulations include those mentioned in the order to expedite environmental reviews and approvals on high priority infrastructure projects, which are defined by President Trump to include ‚Äúcritical...pipelines‚Äù. With this memorandum, the Chairman of White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) has the power to decide whether a project is ‚Äúhigh priority‚Äù or not within 30 days of receiving project requests in efforts to streamline the approval process.  Expansion plans  On July 23, 2007, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners announced that it will expand the pipeline by constructing an additional pipeline alongside the existing pipelines. It will increase the total pipeline system capacity to , and with additional pumping stations to more than .

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and the House of Commons of Canada, and was an elected representative almost continuously from the 1940s until his death. Background Villeneuve was born on June 28, 1906, in Maxville, Ontario, and educated in the area. In his early days he worked as a livestock dealer. He married Alma MacLeod in 1930, and together they raised three sons. He played and coached minor league hockey in the 1930s and 1940s, including coaching and managing the Maxville Millionaires for which in part he was inducted into the Glengarry Sports Hall of Fame in 1995. Villeneuve also spearheaded many local projects, including the Jubilee Rink, the village's first covered rink, and forty years later the Maxville and District Sports Complex to replace the Jubilee. In recognition of this, the arena in the new complex was named in his honour. Villeneuve was also a founding member of the organizing committee for the first Glengarry Highland Games in 1948. Politics Villeneuve served on the local school board on council, and was reeve of Maxville in 1948. In the 1945 provincial election, he ran for the Progressive Conservative Party, and lost to Liberal incumbent Edmund MacGillivray by 1,613 votes in Glengarry. After winning the reeveship of Maxville in 1948, he ran again in the 1948 provincial election, and defeated MacGillivray by 1,788 votes. Villeneuve served as a government backbench supporter under Thomas Laird Kennedy and Leslie Frost, and won re- election in the Progressive Conservative landslides of 1951 and 1955. Villeneuve resigned from the provincial legislature in May 1957 to run federally, as a candidate of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. He was successful, defeating Liberal incumbent Raymond Bruneau by 1,580 votes in Glengarry‚ÄîPrescott in the 1957 election. He served as a backbench supporter of John Diefenbaker's minority government for a year, and defeated Bruneau a second time in the Progressive Conservative landslide of 1958. He was defeated in the 1962 election, losing to Liberal Viateur √âthier by 2,857 votes. Villeneuve then returned to the Ontario legislature in the 1963 election, winning his old seat of Glengarry by 1,363 votes over a Liberal challenger. He was re-elected in 1967, 1971, 1975, 1977 and 1981, and served as a backbencher in the John Robarts and William Davis governments. He was never appointed to cabinet at either the federal or provincial levels. Villeneuve suffered a heart attack in September 1983 while attending a reunion of former Progressive Conservative MPPs, and died in hospital a few hours later. His seat in the Ontario legislature was subsequently won by Noble Villeneuve, a distant relative.

The treaty established the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) as a mechanism for the joint management of the Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) which, at that time, was in severe decline. The commission originally had four members but now has six, which are selected from industry and related government agencies. Half the members are Canadian and half are from the United States. The treaty also had a provision for a closed season, so halibut could not be fished during the more dangerous winter months. The treaty has been revised numerous times, often based on recommendations from the IPHC and its team of scientific researchers. Background In 1907, Canada began to negotiate its own commercial treaties. Prior to that, treaties had been negotiated on behalf of the Canadian government by the British government in London. However, those treaties negotiated since 1907 had all been signed into agreement by the British ambassador to Canada. In 1916, the British Columbia government was informed that halibut stocks were declining in the North Pacific Ocean. Large scale halibut fishing began after the opening of the Northern Pacific Railway to the Canadian Pacific Coast which allowed the transportation and sale of halibut in Eastern Canada. During World War I there was increasing cooperation between Canada and United States on trade issues. During the war, the value of halibut increased. Following the war in 1919, the United States and Canada agreed on a closed-season treaty that also included provisions for salmon fishing. The treaty failed to reach the United States Senate for approval. The Canadian Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, held the belief that only Canada through Parliament would determine its role within the British Empire. After negotiations over the Rush‚ÄìBagot Treaty failed due to British involvement, King intended to push for greater Canadian autonomy. King faced resistance to the treaty from the British Foreign Office. In 1921‚Äì22 some in the American halibut industry operated under a voluntary closed season. 1922 proposal In 1922, Canada proposed a treaty that dealt only with halibut. Named, the Convention for the Preservation of Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean, this treaty created the International Fisheries Commission (IFC), which was initially intended just as a study institute, not for management. The treaty was birthed from Article VII of the previous salmon and halibut treaty. The treaty proposed a season closed to commercial fishing from 16 November to 15 February. Those that were caught during this period faced penalties up to and including seizure. By the 1920s, halibut stocks were noticeably lower to all parties and in 1923, the treaty was ratified by the United States Congress in 1923. The treaty went into effect in 1927. In a break with standard empire practice at the time, in March 1923 King demanded to sign the treaty alone, without a British countersignature. The British initially refused but relented when King threatened to send an independent Canadian diplomatic representative to Washington, D.C. The treaty was signed by Ernest Lapointe, the Canadian Minister of Marine and Fisheries and Charles Evan Hughes, the United States Secretary of State on 23 March and intended to last five years.  Result  It was the first treaty negotiated by and signed only by Canada, independent of Britain. The British had relented as King's intention to send a delegation to Washington, D.C. would have bypassed British authority. The British had argued correctly, that what Canada had done had been illegal. However, at the 1923 Imperial Conference the British believed the Halibut Treaty set a new precedent for the role of the British Dominions, which had emerged following a series of events, among them the Chanak Crisis. The ratification of the treaty paved the way for further British colony independence, including the Balfour Declaration at the Imperial Conference in 1926, which recognized that British Dominions were \\"autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate\\", and finally the Statute of Westminster in 1931 which repealed the Colonial Laws Validity Act and removed the last vestiges of the ability of the British government to create law which applied to its former colonies. The lack of regulatory powers given to the IFC led to a continued decrease in halibut stocks. In 1930, the commission was expanded to include regulatory powers in a second convention. The treaty was reviewed and amended further in 1937, 1953 with a protocol created in 1979. The IFC was renamed the International Pacific Halibut Commission and expanded to six members. Following the emergence of the Quebec sovereignty movement, the Halibut Treaty was put forward as a method to be used by the provincial government of Quebec to earn independence from Canada.

Description \`fork()\` is the name of the system call that the parent process uses to \\"divide\\" itself (\\"fork\\") into two identical processes. After calling \`fork()\`, the created child process is an exact copy of the parent except for the return value of the fork() call. This includes open files, register state, and all memory allocations, which includes the program's executable code. In some cases the two continue to run the same binary, but often one (usually the child) switches to running another binary executable using the \`exec()\` system call. When a process forks, a complete copy of the executing program is made into the new process. This new process is a child of the parent process, and has a new process identifier (PID). The \`fork()\` function returns the child's PID to the parent process. The \`fork()\` function returns 0 to the child process. This enables the two identical processes to distinguish one another. The parent process can either continue execution or wait for the child process to complete. The child, after discovering that it is the child, replaces itself completely with another program, so that the code and address space of the original program are lost. If the parent chooses to wait for the child to die, then the parent will receive the exit code of the program that the child executed. To prevent the child becoming a zombie the parent should call wait on its children, either periodically or upon receiving the SIGCHLD signal, which indicates a child process has terminated. One can also asynchronously wait on their children to finish, by using a signal handler for SIGCHLD, if they need to ensure everything is cleaned up. Here's an example of a signal handler that catches any incoming SIGCHLD signals and handles multiple concurrent signals received. void cleanup(int signal) { while (waitpid((pid_t) (-1), 0, WNOHANG) > 0) {} } When the child process calls \`exec()\`, all data in the original program is lost, and it is replaced with a running copy of the new program. This is known as overlaying. Although all data are replaced, the file descriptors that were open in the parent are closed only if the program has explicitly marked them close-on-exec. This allows for the common practice of the parent creating a pipe prior to calling \`fork()\` and using it to communicate with the executed program. Microsoft Windows does not support the fork-exec model, as it does not have a system call analogous to \`fork()\`. The \`spawn()\` family of functions declared in process.h can replace it in cases where the call to \`fork()\` is followed directly by \`exec()\`.

The era began with the end of World War I and ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The German term (Goldene Zwanziger Jahre) is often applied to that country's experience of healthy economic growth, expansion of liberal values in society and spurt in experimental and creative efforts in the field of art. Before this period, the Weimar Republic had experienced record-breaking levels of inflation of one trillion percent between January 1919 and November 1923. The inflation was so severe that printed currency was often used as domestic fuel, and everyday requirements such as food, soap and electricity cost a wheelbarrow full of banknotes. It was only after radical economic reform measures initiated by the Weimar Republic, such as introduction of a new currency, the Rentenmark, tighter fiscal control and a reduction in bureaucratic hurdles led to an environment of economic stability and prosperity in Germany. In the United States, the corresponding period was called the Roaring Twenties; in France, it was known as Les Ann√©es folles. The Golden Twenties in Germany Amusement temples like the Haus Vaterland in Berlin were symbols for the new freedoms of the 1920s The Golden Twenties in Germany is often referred to as a borrowed time, meaning that this time of exploring the arts, humanities, freedom, and financial stability was atypical and would soon end. The United States was the only country to come out of World War I without debt or reparations to pay. Germany owed a huge sum and had to take a loan from the US just to survive. No one had any hint that there would be a stock market crash with worldwide repercussions and that this crash would ruin Germany and set the stage for Hitler to come into power. Thus, the expression of a \\"borrowed time\\" came to being. It was the calm before the storm. Germany shared many similar social trends with France and America at this time, such as the famous women's haircut called \\"the Bob\\" or \\"Bob cut\\", exploring clothing fashions, cabaret dancers, and performances, and dancing \\"the Charleston\\". The art movement known as New Objectivity originated in Germany during this time. Cabaret Cabaret dancing was the first form of \\"strip tease\\". Customers often sat at a table in a night club or pub and waited to be entertained by the performances of nearly naked girls. These were much like the productions of the Moulin Rouge in Paris, France, during this time. Anita Berber was a famous, even infamous, cabaret dancer during this time. She was known to have danced naked on top of her customers' tables, often while urinating on them and the table and/or hitting them with champagne bottles. Prominent figures * Marlene Dietrich was a German-American actress and singer. * Thomas Mann (6 June 1875 ‚Äì 12 August 1955) was a German novelist, short story writer, social critic, philanthropist, essayist, and the 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature laureate.

He represented Kentucky's Third Congressional District (Louisville, Kentucky and other parts of Jefferson County, Kentucky) in the United States House of Representatives from 1971 through 1995 as a Democrat. He was the primary architect, with Senator Alan Simpson, of major immigration reform legislation. Mazzoli was born in Louisville and is a 1950 graduate of St. Xavier High School, an Xaverian Brothers boys preparatory school. He won the 1950 Kentucky boys high school doubles tennis championship with fellow St. Xavier 1951 alumni George D. Koper. He graduated magna cum laude from the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, in 1954 and from the University of Louisville law school, first in his class, in 1960. Mazzoli served in the Kentucky Senate from 1968 through 1970. Mazzoli was Chairman of the House of Representatives' Immigration, International Law and Refugees Subcommittee for twelve years. He also served on the Small Business, Intelligence and District of Columbia Committees. In 1981, Mazzoli, a pro-life Democrat, introduced, along with Illinois Republican Henry Hyde, the Human Life Amendment, a proposed constitutional amendment which would ban all abortions by granting legal protection to all unborn children in the United States. Ultimately, the amendment failed to amass the 218 votes necessary to pass. Mazzoli authored the Simpson-Mazzoli Immigration Reform and Control Act, later known as the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, and cosponsored it with Republican Senator Alan Simpson. The bill enacted the first U.S. laws to sanction employers who hired undocumented aliens; it also granted an amnesty for aliens already living and working in the United States. After five years of debate and compromise, the Simpson-Mazzoli Bill was ultimately signed into law on November 7, 1986. Mazzoli did not run for reelection in 1994. Since leaving Congress, he has taught at Bellarmine University and was the Ralph S. Petrilli Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at the University of Louisville Law School for the Fall 1995 semester, returning later to the law school as faculty. In 2002, Mazzoli was a Fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. He graduated with a Masters in Public Administration from Harvard Kennedy School of Government in June 2004.

Upper and lower jaw .functional expanders A palatal expander is a device in the field of orthodontics which is used to widen the upper jaw (maxilla) so that the bottom and upper teeth will fit together better. This is a common orthodontic procedure. Although the use of an expander is most common in children and adolescents 8-18 years of age, it can also be used in adults, although expansion is slightly more uncomfortable and takes longer. A patient who would rather not wait several months for the end result by a palatal expander may be able to opt for a surgical separation of the maxilla. Use of a palatal expander is most often followed by braces to then straighten the teeth. It is believed that expansion therapy should be started in patients either before or during their peak growth spurt. To obtain maximal skeletal changes, the therapy is typically initiated at a very early age. Expansion therapy performed after the peak growth spurt will lead to more dental changes than skeletal which leads to tipping of buccal teeth.  Indications for a Palatal Expander  Maxillary expansion is indicated in cases with a difference in the width of the upper jaw to the lower jaw equal to or greater than 4 mm. Typically this is measured from the width of the outside of the first molars in the upper jaw compared to the lower jaw taking into account that the molars will often tip outward to compensate for the difference. Rapid palatal expansion is also used in cleft palate repair, and to gain room for teeth in patients with moderate crowding of the teeth in the upper jaw.  Types of expansion  = Rapid Palatal Expansion = Palatal expander in mixed dentition. Rapid palatal expansion (RPE) or Rapid Maxillary Expansion (RME) is an expansion technique where expansion of 0.5mm to 1mm is achieved each day until the posterior crossbite is relieved. The expander works by turning a key inside the center of the expander. The turn of this key will push the arms of the expander. For stability purposes, the RPE usually remain in the patient's mouth anywhere between 3‚Äì6 months, but this time may vary between patients. This is often known as \\"six month retention period\\" during which the bone fills the gap in the maxilla that was created by the expansion process. To prevent any type of relapse, a retainer is given to the patient to keep the teeth in proper alignment. RPE can be tooth supported, bone supported or both.  Effects  The expansion process usually results in a large gap between the patient's two top front teeth, often known as diastema. This gap is closed naturally and the teeth may overlap which leads to braces being needed. Some may develop a large space while others do not develop a space at all. It usually takes a week or two for one to adjust to eating and speaking after first receiving the rapid palatal expander. This process requires patients to turn the expansion screw themselves to widen the expander. For expansion that is not managed by the patient and on the lower jaw, a bionator appliance may be a more suitable alternative. = Slow Expansion = Slow expansion techniques expands maxilla at a much slower rate compare to the rapid maxillary expansion technique. In slow expansion technique, a patient is ordered to turn the screw 4 times which amounts of 1mm per week. Patient is instructed to turn the jackscrew at the same rate for next 8‚Äì10 weeks to achieve the desired expansion. This slow rate of expansion allows skeletal and dental changes to happen in a 1:1 ratio. This means that equal amount of dental and skeletal expansion is achieved, compared to RME technique where mostly skeletal expansion is achieved initially. Slow expansion has also been advocated to be more physiologic to the tissues of the maxilla and it causes less pain. Some studies have reported that diastema in slow type of expansion also happens less due to the interdental fibers having chance to close the space as the maxilla is being expanded. = Implant- Supported Expansion = Mini-implant assisted rapid palatal expansion (MARPE) involves the forces being applied directly to the maxillary bone instead of the teeth. This technique involves placing anywhere from 2-4 mini-implants in the palatal vault area of maxilla to anchor the RME appliance to the screws. The patient is then asked to turn the jackscrew with the rapid approach over next two weeks. This technique allows palatal expansion to be performed in adults, in which the palatal suture is already fused, a result which was previously only achieved surgically. It has the advantage of being minimally invasive compared to SARPE and of achieving a greater degree of skeletal expansion compared to dentoalveolar expansion. = Surgically Assisted Rapid Palatal Expansion (SARPE) = For more information, please see SARPE Once a patient reaches maturity (puberty) the palate halves or the Intermaxillary suture fuses together into a single palate tissue. If the patient suffers with a constricted maxillary arch, a palatal expander would need to be used. However, with the matured palate, the palatal expander would need to be surgically inserted onto the mid-palatal suture. Typically, the patient would be under the care of an oral-maxiofacial surgeon and the surgical procedure would commence. The mid-palatal suture is first cut open into two parts. The center of the midpalatal suture is then inserted into the open slit. Once fully inserted, the mid-palatal suture of the patient is then closed by the surgeon. The orthodontist will then finish the procedure by connecting the palatal expanders band rings to the patients maxillary molars.  Side-Effects of a Palatal Expansion  * Trouble with Pronunciation - Patients who have expanders may experience extra saliva and lisps (pronouncing the letter s, t, and r blends become very difficult). * Pain - Patients may experience pain and headaches while wearing palatal expanders and when the screw is turned. * Sore on Tongue - This can happen due to contact with the expander's metal bars. * Diastema - Space between upper front two teeth * Fenestration of buccal bone * Compression of PDL near posterior teeth * Extrusion of posterior teeth * Increased lingual bone thickness, decreased buccal bone thickness One of the limits of expansion is the Zygomatic buttress. It is known that this anatomical bony complex limits the maxillary expansion posteriorly. Maxillary expansion does tend to open up Circumaxillary sutures, Circumzygomatic sutures, intermaxillary sutures and midpalatal sutures. Expansion also tends to happen more anteriorly than posteriorly.  Amount of expansion  Each patient presents with different malocclusion and will need different amount of expansion. It is a general rule to expand the maxilla to a point where the lingual cusp of maxillary molar teeth touch the buccal cusp of mandibular molar teeth. Studies done decades ago by Krebs (1964), Stockfisch (1969) and Linder Aronson (1979) showed that about one-third to one-half of the expansion was lost before the expansion was eventually stabilized.  History  Westcott first reported placing mechanical forces on maxilla in 1859. Emerson C. Angell was the first person to publish a paper about palatal expansion in 1860 in Dental Cosmos. He placed a screw between the maxillary premolars of a 14-year-old girl for 2 weeks. When she returned, he observed expansion in her upper arch. In 1877, Walter Coffin developed the Coffin Spring for the purpose of arch expansion. In 1889, J. H. McQyillen who was the President of the American Dental Association at that time, opposed Angell's idea regarding arch expansion. Goddard, in 1890, and Landsberger, in 1910, revisited the idea of arch expansion. Goddard standardized the expansion protocol in adjusting the expander twice a day for 3 weeks. Dr. Andrew J Haas reintroduced his expansion device to United States in 1956 called Haas Expander. He was also one of the first people to report lowering of mandible with bite opening and increase in nasal width and gain in arch perimeter. Robert M. Ricketts introduced the Quad Helix in 1975 which was a modification of the W Spring. Biederman introduced the tooth-borne Hyrax Expander in 1968. Cohen and Silverman were first ones to introduce the Bonded type of expander in 1973.

Coat of arms of Dries Van Noten Dries, Baron Van Noten (born 12 May 1958 in Antwerp) is a Belgian fashion designer and an eponymous fashion brand, which he co-founded with CEO and business partner Christine Mathys.  Early life and education Van Noten was born into a family of garment makers and traders: his father owned a menswear shop and his grandfather was a tailor. He graduated from the Antwerp Academy in 1980. Career Van Noten freelanced for a variety of local designers before launching a menswear line in 1986.Vanessa Friedman (February 21, 2014), Lunch with the FT: Dries Van Noten Financial Times. That year, he presented his first menswear collection in London as part of The Antwerp Six collective. That led to a small order from Barneys New York. Louis, Boston, was one of the first to bring Dries to USA, carrying his collection and selling it in Boston. He currently creates four collections a year (men's and women's, both for summer and winter). In 2005, The New York Times described him as \\"one of fashion's most cerebral designers\\". His style is said to be \\"eccentric\\", and fell out of favor during the long period of minimalistic fashion in the early 1990s, only to make a comeback towards the mid-2000s, culminating with Van Noten's winning of the International Award of the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 2008. In 2008, Van Noten dressed actress Cate Blanchett for the Academy Awards, and has continued to dress her for other red carpet events since then. Other notable customers include Queen Mathilde of Belgium, and actress Maggie Gyllenhaal. In 2018, the third episode of television show Killing Eve notably featured one of his items, known eponymously as the Dries van Noten suit. The brand does not offer haute couture; all of its designs are ready to wear and available at retail: \\"I'm a little naive but I don't like the idea of showing things that you don't sell in a store\\", said Van Noten in a recent interview. His work is said to be characterized by use of prints, colors, original fabrics and layering. He does not advertise. Van Noten's brand has shops in multiple locations worldwide. The first, opening in Antwerp in 1989, was \\"Het Modepaleis\\". Shop openings in Hong Kong and Tokyo followed. In early 2007, a shop was opened in Paris, decorated with antiques collected by Van Noten and his partner Patrick Vangheluwe, followed ten months later by a shop in Singapore. The brand is said to be carried in some 400 fashion shops around the world. As the brand is a private company, not much is known about its financial affairs, although it claims to have annual sales of some 30 million euro. In 2018, it was acquired by family-owned Spanish fragrance and fashion firm Puig; van Noten himself remains a minority shareholder.Jennifer Weil (June 14, 2018), Dries Van Noten Acquired by Puig Women's Wear Daily.Elizabeth Paton and Vanessa Friedman (June 14, 2018), Dries Van Noten Sells Majority Stake to Puig The New York Times.

K. Warslut. The group originated in Melbourne, Australia and by 2001 had relocated to Europe. History K. K. Warslut (aka. Keith Wilhelm Bemrose)https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q63693676 formed Destr√∂yer 666 following his departure from the black metal band Bestial Warlust. Initially the project was a solo venture but eventually a black-death-thrash metal band was formed in 1994 in Melbourne. The group's debut EP, Violence is the Prince of this World featured Warslut on guitar, bass and vocals, with Matt Skitz (aka Matt Sanders) from Damaged and Criss Volcano from Abominator on drums. The song \\"The Eternal Glory of War\\" was later re-recorded for their 2000 album Phoenix Rising. Following their debut release, Destr√∂yer 666 had a line-up of Warslut; bassist Bullet Eater (aka Phil Gresik, ex-Bestial Warlust, Hobbs' Angel of Death, Mass Confusion); Gospel of the Horns' drummer Howitzer; and guitarist Shrapnel. They recorded the group's first studio album, Unchain the Wolves (1997). Soon after Howitzer was replaced by Deceiver and during 1999 Destr√∂yer 666 recorded Phoenix Rising, though it was not released until more than a year later. During 2000, Destr√∂yer 666 toured Europe extensively. Dutch drummer Erich de Windt of Sinister and Prostitute Disfigurement joined the band after the recording of the EP King of Kings. Gresik left to be replaced by Simon Berserker. Phoenix Rising was released by Season of Mist in November. De Windt was replaced by German drummer Mersus in 2001 and Destr√∂yer 666 toured through Europe again with Immolation and Deranged, after which the band left Australia to relocate to Europe. Warslut settled in Eindhoven in the Netherlands and Shrapnel began living in London. The 2002 album Cold Steel... for an Iron Age featured cover art, which the band has since disavowed, claiming they never approved it. A reissue of the album was scheduled for late 2005 but as of May 2009, it had not appeared. It is supposed to feature all new artwork as well as bonus songs. The next album, Defiance, was released in June 2009. It is their first album where none of the music was composed by Warslut, whereas he has concentrated on the lyrics as usual with the music composed by Shrapnel and Matt Razor. The album has been very well received by both fans and critics to keep Destr√∂yer 666 well in the bracket of the cult act they have become. In 2010, the group released a compilation album, \\"To the Devil His Due\\" which contains all of the tracks previously available only on 7\\" vinyl EPs. Destr√∂yer 666's lyrical themes deal with blasphemy, nihilism, Nietzsche and warlike subjects. In August 2012, it was announced that Shrapnel left the band due to personal reasons. Destr√∂yer 666 released their latest album, titled Wildfire, on 26 February 2016. =Notable tours and shows= In 2003, the group undertook an Australian tour that year that culminated in a headlining appearance at the Metal for the Brain festival. Their first North American tour occurred during September and October 2006.Roadrunnerrecords.com Starting from the first of January 2010, Destr√∂yer 666 returned to their homeland in Australia, first playing Screamfest and then extensively touring the country, including Tasmania. They had not played the continent since 2004. 2010 saw further touring and noteworthy live appearances. They were a highlight at Norway's Inferno Festival in March and followed on a very busy and successful year with a US tour alongside Enthroned and a lengthy European jaunt with Watain. In 2011, they were scheduled to tour with German thrash band Destruction in the United States. However, due to unforeseen circumstances they had to drop out of the tour. =Controversy= Destr√∂yer 666, particularly lead singer K. K. Warslut, have espoused Islamophobic, misogynistic, and homophobic messages at their concerts. In 2019, a planned tour of Australia and New Zealand was canceled after the publicizing of some of these incidents. Members =Current line-up= * K.K.

A collaborative work between Dave Portner, Noah Lennox, and Josh Dibb, it was later retroactively classified as the third studio album by experimental pop band Animal Collective.  Recording  The album comprises five individual songs played back to back and recorded in one take. Although it was the middle of November and thus very cold, the recording was made outside on a screen porch in Maryland, using three Sony MiniDisc players with Sony ECM-MS907 microphones placed strategically around the band. Ambient sound from the surrounding area was also recorded on January 2002 and added later to \\"Queen in My Pictures\\" and \\"Moo Rah Rah Rain\\". The album was mixed at Avey Tare's apartment in Bushwick and later mastered with Nicolas Vernhes at Rare Book Room. An aborted recording session for the album took place in December 1999, and included the track \\"Bleak Midwinter\\", which is not on the final tracklisting. It premiered on Geologist's radio program The O'Brien System in 2018. \\"Doggy\\" was re-worked for live performances along with \\"Hey Light\\" from Here Comes the Indian in 2007. About the recording and the idea for this record, Panda Bear said in 2005: The three members of Animal Collective performing on this album are Avey Tare, Panda Bear, and Deakin, who makes his debut appearance here. It is their only album featuring this lineup. Although member Geologist does not perform on the album, he was present for the recording to operate the MiniDisc players. At this point in time, despite the presence of all four original members, there was still no Animal Collective proper; the name Campfire Songs was intended to be the name of the band performing the album, as well as the name of the album itself. However, the band name 'Animal Collective' is used in the booklet from the latest copies of the album. About one week before recording, they played the whole album live at Tonic in New York City, sitting in the middle of the floor while the audience surrounded them.

But Niari (Region du Niari)/Nyayari belong to upper caste whose occupational activity was running local business like sugar mills, mines and making flattened rice and they don't belong to keuta community.\\" History According to the Hindu scriptures, Niari was known in the Puranas-Ganga Dynasty. This community is very rare across India and focus in the profession of fishing and chudakuta work. Few greedy people want to take advantage of facility from the Gov. in the name of caste. Forcefully degrading and merging them self in other caste. In history a group of unemployed and poor people mostly of the Niari Caste, and few other caste, adopted a profession, usually preparing flattened rice by command of the king. It helped them to balance their economy. This food item helped in battle and in disaster. It also has been offering to god as prsad. People sometimes called them Radhi, as their rice beating sound was like the instrument's rhythm. Flattening Rice is originally invented at Malwa. Politically and administratively, the historical Malwa region includes districts of western Madhya Pradesh and parts of south-eastern Rajasthan. Occupation of the people of Malwa is agriculture. The region has been one of the important producers of opium in the world. Wheat and soybeans are other important cash crops, and textiles are a major industry. The Government Judicial analysis and statement: ::\\"Niari is a caste in Orissa which is a part of Kshatriya community. According to the Hindu scriptures the caste known as Radhi/Niari (Region du Niari) belonged to upper caste. In early times they were involved in govt offices but later the kayastha's were moved to this position and then they were moved out of the offices. Later they started their business like running sugar mills and preparing flattened rice. Modern Era: A return has been filed by the State. In paragraph-3 of the counter affidavit it has been averred that: \\"............ It has been seen from the Record-of-Rights of the Tahasil that caste \\"Kaibarta\\" has been recorded against some individual tenants and Niari against some other individual tenants. So the Kaibarta and Niari are two completely different castes having different occupations. ::The caste Niari has not yet been included in the Orissa Scheduled Caste list. The clarification issued by the Government vide letter No. 25943/HTW dated 22-8-1989 from joint Director-cum-Deputy Secretary to Government, H. & T. W. Department Orissa, Bhubaneswar does not show that Niari is a sub- caste of caste Kaibarta as claimed by the petitioner. In forming a general opinion it is seen at this place that there are some persons belonging to different castes are also occupying the profession of \\"Chudakuta\\" and \\"Mudhibhaja\\" and also fishing with their own nets. But certainly they are not Kaibarta, Keuta or Dhibara. Therefore Niari cannot be treated as Dewar\\". ::So, the Niaris doesn't belong to Kaibarta community or Keuta community. They are not included in SC/ST list. Their origin have descended from khsatriya and they have been moved from the govt offices to the local business. Govt of India has denied their inclusion in SC/ST list as it belongs to General caste and they are not included in Kaibarta/keuta. Kaibarta/Keuta are lower caste and have been identified as SC under Govt of India.

The Newark complex was built 2,000 to 1800 years ago. In 1862, brothers Charles and James Salisbury surveyed the first of this road, noting it was marked by parallel earthen banks almost apart and led from the Newark Earthworks. They said that the road extended much farther south from Newark in the direction of Chillicothe. Other 19th-century investigators, such as Ephraim G. Squier and Edwin H. Davis, also documented the walls of the road near Newark. The 2.5-mile section from the Newark Octagon south to Ramp Creek is now known as the \\"Van Voorhis Walls\\". In the 1930s, the area was surveyed by plane, revealing traces of the road extended for toward the Hopewellian center of present-day Chillicothe. Additional examination of the area with the new sensing technology of LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) adds confirmation to this finding and suggests a way to gain more evidence. This technology showed the road was lower than the surrounding land, sunk between the walls. Dr. Brad Lepper, the present-day champion of the Great Hopewell Road, claims that traces of the road remain at four additional places along the line connecting Newark and Chillicothe. Parts of the road can be seen from the air and with infrared photography. There is precedent for such a sacred road at other complexes. More \\"ground truthing\\" needs to be performed but the evidence is suggestive. The first 2.5 mi south of the parallel-walled roadway of the Newark Earthworks is known as the Van Voorhis Walls. It is a confirmed earthwork. This portion of the earthwork terminates a Ramp Creek, in Heath, Licking County, Ohio. South of there, the projected path of the Hopewell Road passes through fields toward Millersport, Licking County, Ohio. Evidence from early accounts and 1930s aerial photography suggests that the Hopewell Road may continue south of Ramp Creek, and a cultural resource management study provides equivocal, yet suggestive evidence of the earthwork south of Ramp Creek. In 2016, an analysis of previous studies found enough evidence of the Great Hopewell Road south of Ramp Creek, to indicate that archaeologists should continue to search for evidence of it.Great Hopewell Road_New_Data_Analyses_and_Future_Research_Prospects References  External links  * \\"Newark Earthworks, The Ancient Ohio Trail\\" -The Great Hopewell Road * \\"The Great Hopewell Road: GIS Solutions Towards Pathway Discovery\\", The Newsletter of Hopewell Archaeology in the Ohio River Valley * William F.

Retrieved 2017-10-07 Theory The idea of the open classroom was that a large group of students of varying skill levels would be in a single, large classroom with several teachers overseeing them. It is ultimately derived from the one-room schoolhouse, but sometimes expanded to include more than two hundred students in a single multi-age and multi- grade classroom. Rather than having one teacher lecture to the entire group at once, students are typically divided into different groups for each subject according to their skill level for that subject. The students then work in small groups to achieve their assigned goal. Teachers serve as both facilitators and instructors. Certain education professionals, including Professor Gerald Unks at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, strongly support this system particularly with young children. If poorly planned or laid out, open classrooms can sometimes lead to problems with noise and poor ventilation. Classrooms that are physically open are increasingly rare, as many schools that were built \\"without walls\\" have long since put up permanent partitions of varying heights. However, in many places, the open philosophy as an instructional technique continues.http://larrycuban.wordpress.com/2009/12/05/fad-or-tradition-the- case-of-the-open-classroom/ Larry Cuban states \\"To call it a fad would miss the deeper meaning of ‚Äúopen classrooms‚Äù as another skirmish in the ideological wars that have split educational progressives from conservatives since the first tax-supported schools opened their doors in the early 1800s.\\" Piedmont Open/IB Middle School in Charlotte, North Carolina, for example, was started as one of the original two magnet middle schools in Charlotte in the 1970s. While the other magnet (a \\"traditional\\" school) has closed, Piedmont is still functioning as a modified open school thirty years later, all the time housed in a traditional physical plant.  Open-space school  The open-space school concept was introduced into the United States in 1965 as an experimental elementary school architecture where the physical walls separating classrooms were removed to promote movement across class areas by teachers. However, in practice this is not typical since teachers, following social conventions, tend to teach in a traditional manner as if the walls were still present. Further, modern open-space schools tend to use modular furniture to separate class rooms in a manner similar to \\"Cubicle farms\\" used in many corporate environments. Advocates of open plan schools argue that students 'should be allowed to learn in ways suited to their individual differences' and that the most effective teaching and learning strategies allow teachers to work collaboratively with each other and team teach. The traditional classroom boxes with desks lined up in rows impede teachers' efforts to work in teams and have students 'in the flexible and varied groupings necessary' (Mark, J 2001:5). Bunting agrees, saying that 'traditional classrooms must change' and proposes a model of a generic space for students to be co-located with teachers, which are decorated by the students to give them ownership, and teachers and students only move when necessary to access specialised space (Bunting, A 2004:11‚Äì12). Klein found in a 1975 study that third graders with low levels of anxiety were more creative in open schools than in traditional school. Children with high levels of anxiety showed no differences between open-space and traditional school models. Students in open-spaced schools scored higher on preference for novelty and change.Elias and Elias 1976  References  * Pick et al., \\"Development of Spatial Cognition\\", Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, , copyright 1985, page 99)  External links  * Open Classroom as a fad? * Flexible Space & Built Pedagogy: Emerging IT Embodiments * Built Pedagogies & Technology Practices: Designing for Participatory Learning * Piedmont Open IB Middle School Educational environment Education reform Educational facilities ","title":"Open classroom"},{"id":"2958615","text":"Droop Mountain Battlefield State Park is a state park located on Droop Mountain in Pocahontas County, West Virginia. The park was the site of the Battle of Droop Mountain, the last major battle of the American Civil War in the state taking place on November 6, 1863. John D. Sutton, a West Virginia private in the Union Army at the battle, became the leader in the movement to create the park when he served in the West Virginia House of Delegates. Dedicated on July 4, 1928, Droop Mountain Battlefield became the first state park in West Virginia. The battlefield was transformed into a historical, outdoor recreation area by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. Public reenactments of the battle are conducted in October of even-numbered years by the West Virginia Reenactors Association. The park was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Droop Mountain Battlefield State Park is located about north of the Lewisburg exit of I-64 on U.S. Highway 219 and about south of Marlinton on US 219.

He was an army private for seven years before being commissioned as a Hussar officer. As a hobby, Fazekas studied the natural sciences (botany) and wrote poetry. His poetry expressed his disgust with warfare and violence, and brought to light the social injustices of his society. Fazekas' epic poem L√∫das Matyi (Mattie the Goose-boy), written in 1804, was based on a folk-tale of unexact origins. In the story, Matyi, the main character, tries to sell his geese at the market, but runs into trouble with the servants of the local lord. The plot revolves around Matyi's scheme to get back at the lord. The story is popular because Matyi is the first commonfolk hero in Hungarian literature who is victorious over his social superior. Fazekas' poem was made into a film in 1949. It was directed by K√°lm√°n N√°dasdy and starred the actors Imre So√≥s and √âva Ruttkai.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1971 to 1975 and from 1977 to 1985 who represented the northern Ontario riding of Timiskaming. Background Born in Poland, Havrot moved to Ontario as a child and was educated in Kirkland Lake. He was a businessman before entering political life, and was active in the Royal Canadian Legion. He married Gayle MacArthur and together they raised four children. Politics Havrot served on the Kirkland Lake council in 1966-67, and was elected as its reeve in 1970. He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1971 provincial election, defeating a New Democratic Party (NDP) opponent by 2,154 votes in Timiskaming. He served as a backbench supporter for the next four years, and was named chair of the Ontario Northland Transportation and parliamentary assistant to Minister of Transportation John Rhodes. Havrot was known for making politically incorrect remarks. In 1975, during a local dispute with aboriginal groups over land claims, he told a The Globe and Mail reporter than he could have bribed the area's chiefs with \\"a case of goof\\". He then added, \\"These damn Indians have gone absolutely wild... We should have given them a bunch of teepees and some cordwood and that's all\\". He was accused of racism, immediately lost both of his legislative appointments, and was forced to read a prepared apology in the legislature. He later tried to defend himself by saying, \\"Up North, if you say the wrong thing in the heat of the moment and offend somebody, you apologize and its over\\". He was renominated for the 1975 provincial election, following a nomination speech in which he described The Globe and Mail article as the \\"lowest form of cheap journalism\\". He lost the election, falling to NDP candidate Bob Bain by 1,544 votes. Havrot returned to the legislature in 1977, defeating Bain by 664 votes. He once again served as a backbench supporter of the Davis government, though Davis refused to visit his riding association. In 1979, Havrot repeatedly interrupted a speech by New Democratic Party Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Tony Lupusella to yell, \\"This is the wop show\\", \\"mama mia\\" and \\"Atsa nice. Good for Benito Mussolini\\". He was again forced to read a prepared apology in the legislature. After fending off a serious challenge for the PC nomination, he again defeated Bain in the 1981 provincial election. Havrot was defeated for a second time in the 1985 election, losing to New Democrat David Ramsay by 2,824 votes. He sought a return to the legislature in 1987, and this time finished a distant third against Ramsay. Havrot also ran for mayor of Kirkland Lake in 1988, but lost to incumbent Joe Mavrinac.

It occupied the first building in the Western Hemisphere to be designed and built specifically as a museum. The museum was created by Charles Willson Peale (1741‚Äì1827) and his son Rembrandt Peale (1778‚Äì1860). It functioned separately as Baltimore City's historical museum while the original structure was being rebuilt, restored, and renovated in 1930‚Äì1931, and then merged with other historic sites, houses and museums in the early 1980s under the expansive efforts of a new executive director, with the name of the Baltimore City Life Museums and a broader mission in conjunction with the other historical locations/sites/structures in Baltimore. After opening a new three-story exhibition gallery, uniquely using the old cast-iron fa√ßade of the razed (but placed in storage in a city yard for 30 years) Fava Fruit Company and being re-assembled on the new structure facing North Front Street and the parallel new President Street boulevard (between East Lombard and East Fayette streets), the new gallery and the B.C.L.M. ran into financial difficulties in the first year (1996‚Äì1997) after the grand opening, coincidentally during the bicentennial celebration of Baltimore's establishment as a city. The Peale branch of the City Life Museums closed with the other branches, historic houses and sites later in 1997, after being refused a one-year extension of its five-year subsidy of about $300,000 annually by then Mayor Kurt Schmoke. Its large collections from over 66 years of original existence were disassembled, transferred and handed over to the Maryland Historical Society, founded 1844, now located on the city block on the southwest corner of West Monument Street and Park Avenue, centered in the old Enoch Pratt Mansion and adjacent research library and museum exhibition areas building. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965. Today, the museum is being renovated and relaunched as the Peale Center for Baltimore History and Architecture through a partnership between Baltimore's Department of General Services, which owns the building, and the Board of the Peale Center for Baltimore History and Architecture, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt, non-profit corporation. It is closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but anticipates re- opening soon. History Charles Willson Peale (1741‚Äì1827) received his inspiration for a public museum in 1783 while illustrating mastodon fossils belonging to Dr. John Morgan. Once he had conceived the idea for an American museum of natural history, Peale opened a museum to the public in Philadelphia on July 18, 1786. In 1810, Peale retired from his work with the museum, leaving its management and responsibility to his sons. Later in 1814, a museum was established at 225 North Holliday Street between East Saratoga and East Lexington streets in Baltimore by Rembrandt Peale (1778‚Äì1860), the second son of Charles Willson Peale. It was dubbed as \\"Peale's Baltimore Museum and Gallery of Fine Arts\\" and featured portraits of famous Americans (many by the founder) and the complete skeleton of a prehistoric mastodon exhumed by C.W. Peale in 1801. In 1830, the old Peale Museum was sold and the exhibits were moved to a newly constructed building on the northwest corner of North Calvert Street and East Baltimore Street, one block south of the Battle Monument Square and the Baltimore City Courthouse. By 1830, the historic building became home to Baltimore's first \\"City Hall\\" and remained there through the tumultuous Civil War years until 1875 when replaced by the current Baltimore City Hall, which had been under construction since 1867 one block south, on the 200 block of Holliday Street. The massive new municipal government offices of French Second Empire-style architecture, with its distinctive mansard roofs and large dome and clock, now occupied an entire city block bounded by Holliday, East Lexington, East Fayette and North streets (now Guilford Avenue), one block south at the 200 block of Holliday between East Lexington and Fayette streets. The old museum and City Hall was then turned over to the city's Board of School Commissioners and the Baltimore City Public Schools and became the Number 1 Colored Primary School (as there was a number of then- called \\"Negro\\" or \\"Colored\\" institutions, churches, law firms and businesses in the areas around East Pleasant, Saratoga, East Lexington and along St. Paul Street and North Calvert streets). Later it was rented out to a series of private businesses. By 1928, it had been repeatedly condemned and was in danger of demolition. With the inspiration of newly-emergent, local historians and journalists, who had just celebrated the centennial of the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" (future national anthem) and the Battle of Baltimore with its Bombardment of Fort McHenry and resulted in the saving of the old 1793 rowhouse at East Pratt and Albemarle streets in the Jonestown/Old Town and Little Italy neighborhoods, owned and lived in by Mary Young Pickersgill, (1776‚Äì1857) who made the huge \\"Star Spangled Banner Flag\\", the restoration of the old \\"Flag House\\" and setting up of a historical museum there in 1927 boosted the hopes, political power and determination of the preservationists. So the restoration of the old museum took place with an expense of $90,000. The building was renovated and rededicated in 1931 as the Municipal Museum of Baltimore. The museum underwent a major two-year renovation starting in 1978 and was reopened in 1981 as the Peale Museum. In 1985, the Peale became part of the Baltimore City Life Museums system until its closure in 1997. The entire Peale collection has been moved to the Maryland Historical Society, leaving the original building on North Holliday Street vacant. As of April 2014, a campaign was being waged by a Maryland group to raise $4 million for restoration of the museum. The building is located between Zion Lutheran Church and offices for The Real News.

When this orthography was used, Douch (or Dutch) was an English-language adjective synonymous with German sensu lato or Germanic, only acquiring a narrower definition in modern usage as an adjective for the Netherlands. John Russell Smith, in Patronymica Britannica: a dictionary of the family names of the United Kingdom (1860), writes the following entry for Douch: > DOUCH.

He was also a well-known Roman Catholic member of Opus Dei. Antonio Font√°n was the editor of the independent newspaper Madrid from 1967 to 1971. The periodical openly criticized Francisco Franco's authoritarian rule. In 1968, the government began a campaign against the newspaper, in which Font√°n was prosecuted 19 times and fined 10 times in the span of four months. In October 1971, the authorities demanded Font√°n's resignation, closing down the paper a few weeks later. Font√°n's staunch defense of the principles of free expression during those five years as editor earned him and his staff a unique place in the annals of Spanish journalism. In 1977, Font√°n was elected to the Spanish Senate as a member of the Uni√≥n de Centro Democr√°tico, in the first democratic general elections after the end of Francoist Spain. During his career, Font√°n co-authored Spain's Constitution of 1978, which recognized freedom of expression and freedom of information as fundamental rights. He also served as a minister from 1979 to 1982. At the time of his death, Font√°n was the president and publisher of Nueva Revista de Pol√≠tica, Cultura y Arte, a bimonthly news magazine, which he founded in 1990. The International Press Institute (IPI) has named him one of the \\"Heroes of Press Freedom.\\" Early years Font√°n was born in Seville, Spain, on October 15, 1923. He attended the University of Seville where he received his doctorate in classical philology in 1948, and was active in clandestine, royalist and liberal circles. In addition, he studied journalism at the Official School of Madrid. Font√°n was the director of a weekly magazine, La Actualidad Espa√±ola, and the monthly Nuestro Tiempo before joining the evening paper, Madrid, in September 1966, shortly after the introduction of a new press law which lifted prior censorship. Struggle for press freedom in Francoist Spain Font√°n was appointed editor-in-chief of Madrid on April 15, 1967. He soon learned that the end of censorship did not necessarily mean true freedom of the press. Madrid quickly became unpopular with the authorities for its coverage of such taboo subjects as student and labor unrest, the growth of regionalism, illegal trade unionism, and opposition party activities. Font√°n and his paper were bombarded with sanctions for publishing articles defending democracy and civil liberties, and criticizing Francoist Spain. Between January 1967 and May 1968 alone, proceedings were initiated against the paper on 12 separate occasions. Madrid was shut down for four months on May 30, 1968, inflicting heavy financial losses on the paper. The paper continued to pay the salaries of its staff during this time. After Madrids reappearance on September 30, 1968, judicial proceedings against the paper continued on a regular basis. Finally, in October 1971, the Minister of Information, Sanchez Belle, demanded the replacement of Font√°n with a journalist close to the Falange party and the appointment of a director to represent the Ministry. In the case of refusal, Belle warned that the newspaper would be temporarily suspended and an investigation started to consider its permanent closure. However, Madrids publisher and principal owner, Rafael Calvo Serer, refused to agree to these conditions. The paper's editorial staff formed a journalists' association, the first of its kind in Spain, to defend the independence and dignity of the profession and to fight for the retention in office of the present editor. At the end of October, 1971, the Spanish Information Ministry issued an order informing the newspaper that an investigation had been launched to examine \\"irregularities\\" in the original listing of its stockholders. The newspaper had 10 days to answer the inquiry. The government was empowered to cancel the paper's registration, thus closing it, if the paper could not \\"clarify\\" or explain the irregularities. On November 25, 1971, after the paper published an article critical of General Franco's right-hand man, Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco, the Ministry of Information removed Madrid from the register of press publishers, allegedly because of irregularities in the paper's ownership. The Ministry also told the paper to cease publishing. The banning of Madrid affected public opinion and was widely criticized by the Spanish press. \\"To close an economically sound and well-read paper is murder,\\" commented the Catholic paper Ecclesia. Madrids journalists and workers agreed to support the management and not surrender the newspaper to the official trade unions, which had offered to take charge of the newspaper under a new editor and with its own editorial line. \\"We are ready to sell the presses to pay the staff rather than agree that the paper should lose its independence,\\" the journalists said. Madrid stayed closed. Calvo Serer, who went into exile in France a few days before the government closed the paper, was tried in absentia and charged with actions \\"prejudicial to the reputation and authority of the State.\\" When democracy was restored in Spain after Franco's death and the monarchy was re- established in 1975, the Supreme Court revoked the order to close down Madrid. The state was ordered to pay damages to the paper, but this was not enough to restart the daily, which had sold everything in order to compensate its employees. Work in politics and academics Font√°n was elected to the Senate as a member of the Uni√≥n de Centro Democr√°tico coalition party in the first democratic general elections in June 1977. He was one of the authors of the country's Constitution of 1978, which recognized freedom of expression and freedom of information as fundamental rights. He also served as a minister of the government from 1979 to 1982. In addition to journalism and politics, Font√°n led an active career in academia. He set up the first university-level school of journalism in Spain at the University of Navarra in 1958. The university was under the guidance of the Roman Catholic prelature of Opus Dei, of which he was a numerary member. He was made an honorary life member of the International Press Institute in 1984. He was also named one of the Institute's 50 World Press Freedom Heroes of the 20th century. Font√°n was the president and publisher of Nueva Revista de Pol√≠tica, Cultura y Arte, a bimonthly magazine on current affairs, which he founded in 1990. He was made Marqu√©s de Guadalcanal, in July 2008, by King Juan Carlos I as an homage to his contributions to political freedom and civil peace in Spain.

In 1826 Piorry introduced the pleximeter (le plessim√©tre), a device used to help delineate internal organs, of which he described in his 1828 treatise De la Percussion M√©diate. He published works on numerous aspects of medicine, and had some success as a poet. One of his better known poems was Dieu, L'Ame et la Nature (1853).

He sought to end France's colonial occupation of Vietnam. He opposed both violence and turning to other countries for support, and instead believed in attaining Vietnamese liberation by educating the population and by appealing to French democratic principles. Biography Phan Ch√¢u Trinh was born in T√¢y L·ªôc, Qu·∫£ng Nam Province in Annam, French Indochina on 9 September 1872. He was the son of a rich land owner and scholar. His father was a fighter in the Scholars' Revolt, but in 1885 he was killed by the other leaders in the revolt who suspected him of being a traitor. This left Trinh an orphan at the age of 13. His older brother educated him in classics. In 1901 he got the highest Mandarin degree. In 1905 Trinh resigned from his post in the mandarin bureaucracy. He had become strongly opposed to the monarchy, traditional Chinese Confucian-influenced Vietnamese court and mandarin system. He called for an end to the monarchy and its replacement with a democratic republic. Having earlier met Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u in 1903, in March/April 1906 he went to Hong Kong and then to Kwangtung to meet with him again. He made his way there disguised as a disheveled common laborer. He then went to Japan with Ch√¢u as part of the ƒê√¥ng-Du movement. They stayed in Yokohama, where they had set up a two-story Japanese house to teach students, which they called Binh Ngo Hien. In June they went to Tokyo to inspect the Japanese education and political system. Trinh disagreed with Ch√¢u's early ideas of asking for military assistance from Japan, as he didn't trust Japan's militarism. He also had other disagreements with Ch√¢u's philosophy. Therefore, they had a friendly argument for a few weeks before he returned to Vietnam. Back in Vietnam he continued to receive letters from Ch√¢u arguing about his opposition to the monarchy and his belief that the French could be used. Trinh continued to campaign with slogans like \\"Up with Democracy, Out with Monarchy\\", and \\"Making Use of the French in the Quest for Progress\\". This made Ch√¢u quite upset and worried that the movement was fragmenting and that fundraising efforts would fail. In 1906 he wrote to the French Governor General Paul Beau. He asked the French to live up to their civilising mission. He blamed them for the exploitation of the countryside by Vietnamese collaborators. He called on France to develop modern legal, educational, and economic institutions in Vietnam and industrialise the country, and to remove the remnants of the mandarin system. In 1907 he opened a patriotic modern school for young Vietnamese men and women. The school was called ƒê√¥ng Kinh Nghƒ©a Th·ª•c (aka Tonkin Free School). He was a lecturer at the school, and Ch√¢u's writings were also used. The school carefully avoided doing anything illegal. Its ideas attacked the brutality of the French occupation of Vietnam, but also wanted to learn modernisation from the French. The school required scholars to renounce their elitist traditions and learn from the masses. It also offered the peasants a modern education. After peasant tax revolts erupted in 1908, Trinh was arrested, and his school was closed. He was sentenced to death, but it was commuted to life imprisonment after his progressive admirers in France intervened. He was sent to C√¥n ƒê·∫£o island. In 1911, after three years, he was pardoned and sentenced to house arrest. He said he would rather return to prison than have partial freedom. So instead he was deported to France, where the French continued to monitor him. He went to Paris in 1915 to get the support of progressive French politicians and Vietnamese exiles. There he worked with H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh, Phan VƒÉn Tr∆∞·ªùng, Nguy·ªÖn Th·∫ø Truy·ªÅn, and Nguy·ªÖn An Ninh in \\"The Group of Vietnamese Patriots\\". The group was based at 6 Villa des Gobelins. There they wrote patriotic articles signed with the name Nguy·ªÖn √Åi Qu·ªëc which H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh later used, \\"on behalf of the Group of Vietnamese Patriots\\". He worked as a photograph retoucher to support himself while he was in France. He returned to Saigon in 1925, where he died on 24 March 1926, aged 53. His funeral was attended by 60,000 people and caused big protests across the country demanding the end of French colonial occupation, which would not occur for three more decades. Debates with other nationalists In Tokyo, Trinh told Ch√¢u: \\"The level of their people is so high, and the level of our people is so low! How could we not become slaves? That some students now can enter Japanese schools has been your great achievement. Please stay on in Tokyo to take a quiet rest and devote yourself to writing, and not to making appeals for combat against the French. You should only call for 'popular rights and popular enlightenment.' Once popular rights have been achieved, then we can think about other things.\\" Ch√¢u commented: \\"Thereafter over more than ten days, he and I debated time and again, and our opinions were diametrically opposed. That is to say, he wished to overthrow the monarchy in order to create a basis for the promotion of popular rights; I, on the contrary, maintained that first the foreign enemy should be driven out, and after our nation's independence was restored we could talk about other things. My plan was to make use of the monarchy, which he opposed absolutely. His plan was to raise up the people to abolish the monarchy, with which I absolutely disagreed. In other words, he and I were pursuing one and the same goal, but our means were considerably different. He wished to start by relying on the French to abolish the monarchy, but I wished to start by driving out the French to restore Vietnam - That was the difference. However, even though his political view was the opposite of mine, he liked me personally a great deal and we roomed together for several weeks. Then all of a sudden he decided to return to our country.\\" Legacy Most cities in Vietnam have named major streets after him.

Production The reaction of ethylene oxide with aqueous ammonia first produces ethanolamine: :C2H4O + NH3 ‚Üí H2NCH2CH2OH which reacts with a second and third equivalent of ethylene oxide to give DEA and triethanolamine: :C2H4O + H2NCH2CH2OH ‚Üí HN(CH2CH2OH)2 :C2H4O + HN(CH2CH2OH)2 ‚Üí N(CH2CH2OH)3 About 300M kg are produced annually in this way.Matthias Frauenkron, Johann-Peter M elder, G√ºnther Ruider, Roland Rossbacher, Hartmut H√∂ke ‚ÄúEthanolamines and Propanolamines‚Äù in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002 by Wiley-VCH, Weinheim The ratio of the products can be controlled by changing the stoichiometry of the reactants. Uses DEA is used as a surfactant and a corrosion inhibitor. It is used to remove hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from natural gas. Diethanolamine is widely used in the preparation of diethanolamides and diethanolamine salts of long-chain fatty acids that are formulated into soaps and surfactants used in liquid laundry and dishwashing detergents, cosmetics, shampoos and hair conditioners.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK373177/#:~:text=2.-,Use,cosmetics%2C%20shampoos%20and%20hair%20conditioners.In oil refineries, a DEA in water solution is commonly used to remove hydrogen sulfide from sour gas. It has an advantage over a similar amine, ethanolamine, in that a higher concentration may be used for the same corrosion potential. This allows refiners to scrub hydrogen sulfide at a lower circulating amine rate with less overall energy usage. DEA is a chemical feedstock used in the production of morpholine. :400px Amides derived from DEA and fatty acids, known as diethanolamides, are amphiphilic. The reaction of 2-chloro-4,5-diphenyloxazole with DEA gave rise to Ditazole. The reaction of DEA and Isobutyraldehyde with water removed produces an Oxazolidine. Commonly used ingredients that may contain DEA DEA is used in the production of diethanolamides, which are common ingredients in cosmetics and shampoos added to confer a creamy texture and foaming action. Consequently, some cosmetics that include diethanolamides as ingredients contain DEA. https://cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/lauramide-deaSome of the most commonly used diethanolamides include: :* Cocamide DEA :* DEA-Cetyl Phosphate :* DEA Oleth-3 Phosphate :* Lauramide DEA :* Myristamide DEA :* Oleamide DEA Safety DEA is a potential skin irritant in workers sensitized by exposure to water-based metalworking fluids. One study showed that DEA inhibits in baby mice the absorption of choline, which is necessary for brain development and maintenance;Study Shows Ingredient Commonly Found In Shampoos May Inhibit Brain Development however, a study in humans determined that dermal treatment for 1 month with a commercially available skin lotion containing DEA resulted in DEA levels that were \\"far below those concentrations associated with perturbed brain development in the mouse\\". In a mouse study of chronic exposure to inhaled DEA at high concentrations (above 150 mg/m3), DEA was found to induce body and organ weight changes, clinical and histopathological changes, indicative of mild blood, liver, kidney and testicular systemic toxicity. A 2009 study found that DEA has potential acute, chronic and subchronic toxicity properties for aquatic species.

In his General Economic History, Weber creates an institutional theory of the rise of capitalism in the west. Unlike in his earlier work, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, religion is given a minor role. The emphasis of the work lies instead on the place of the state and calculable law in allowing economic actors to predict exchange for gain. Weber's institutional theory of capitalism was rediscovered in the early 1980s by writers like Randall Collins, Daniel Chirot, and Douglass C. North, who worked to replace theories based largely on Immanuel Wallerstein's \\"World Systems\\" theory. Though today read primarily by sociologists and social philosophers, Weber's work did have a significant influence on Frank Knight, one of the founders of the neoclassical Chicago school of economics, who translated Weber's General Economic History into English in 1927.Ross B.

The company is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Schlotzsky's has more than 350 franchised and company-owned locations worldwide. Most locations are in the south and southwestern United States, but the company is expanding into areas across the country, particularly the north and southeast. History In 1971, Don and Dolores Dissman founded the company in a \\"small, hole-in-the-wall shop\\" in Austin, Texas. The initial menu consisted of one sandwich, called \\"The Original,\\" consisting of mixed meats, cheeses and black olives on a freshly made, toasted bun.\\" It was based on the Muffuletta sandwich. In 1981, the company had 100 franchise stores when real estate investors, John and Jeff Wooley and Gary Bradley, purchased the company for less than $3 million. Bradley split with the Wooleys in 1982, with Bradley taking the real estate business while the Wooleys kept the chain. The Original, Schlotzsky's signature sandwich The Wooleys expanded Schlotzsky's menu to include specialty pizzas, toasted wraps, salads, soups, and other items. The Wooleys also took the company public on 15 December 1995, trading as BUNZ on NASDAQ. The chain peaked in 2001 with 759 stores and over $400 million in sales, when same-store sales began to plateau. 2003 saw the company posting an $11.7 million loss; as a result, the Schlotzsky's board of directors relieved the Wooley brothers of day-to-day management on 17 June 2004 and named Sam Coats as the new chief executive officer of the company. The Wooleys eventually resigned from the board in July 2004. On August 3, 2004 Schlotzsky's filed for voluntary Chapter 11 protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Antonio, Texas, reporting liabilities of approximately $71.3 million and assets of approximately $111.7 million. The company ceased public trading when Bobby Cox Companies acquired Schlotzky's assets out of bankruptcy. Under new ownership and management, Schlotzsky's spent two years strengthening its franchise operations and restructuring the brand. The new owner operated the business under the corporate entity Schlotzsky's, Ltd., and began streamlining the menu. Schlotzsky's strengthened franchise operations and licensed new franchisees in Texas and other states. The company also planned to open several new corporate-owned stores. On 21 November 2006, Schlotzsky's was acquired by Focus Brands, an affiliate of private equity firm Roark Capital Group, parent company of Moe's Southwest Grill, Carvel, Cinnabon and Auntie Anne's. The following year, the company named Kelly Roddy as president, who joined Schlotzsky's from H-E-B Grocery Company. With Kelly on board, Schlotzsky's planned for growth and a system-wide reimage, which included updated restaurants, improved menus, table service, and the addition of Cinnabon. The company remodeled locations across the country with a \\"Lotz Better\\" look, which included bright, bold colors, circle-themed furniture and decor and playful slogans. =Schlotzsky's Austin Eatery= In 2016, Schlotzsky's introduced a new restaurant chain called Schlotzsky's Austin Eatery, which targets Millennials with a menu featuring Austin-inspired food from the city.https://austin.eater.com/2018/3/2/17072496/schlotzskys-austin- eatery-restaurant-bee-cave The first location opened in Duluth, Georgia; other locations followed in a slow expansion.

Biography Debeljak was born in the Slovenian capital Ljubljana, then part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, to a family with rural origins; he was the first of the family to attend university. In his youth he was the junior Slovenian champion in judo, and got a silver medal at the Yugoslav championship. He stopped his sport career after an injury. He graduated from comparative literature at the University of Ljubljana in 1985. He continued his studies in the United States, obtaining a PhD in sociology of culture at Syracuse University in 1989. He was later a Senior Fulbright fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. He also worked at the Institute for Advanced Studies Collegium Budapest, the Civitella Ranieri Center and the Bogliasco Liguria Study Center for the Arts and Humanitites. From the mid-1980s onwards, Debeljak took an active part in civil society movements. He decided to come back to Slovenia at the time of the dissolution of Yugoslavia as, he said, he did not want to become a \\"Balkan- observer\\" from abroad, but rather wanted to take part directly in those moments. As many others, he had come to accept the idea of Slovenian independence as a second-best option in lack of better alternatives, as every plan for reforming Yugoslavia while conceding more autonomy to Slovenia and Croatia had failed. He still retained and cherished his double identity as a Slovene and as a Yugoslav, and thought that independence had actually limited Slovenia's cultural references: \\"we lost our attachments to the people of the South, and at the same time we did not gain the same type of emotional attachment to Austria and to other European countries\\". In 1991 he worked as interpreter for foreign media during the Ten-Day War, and witnessed first-hand the Yugoslav-Slovene armed clashes at the Austrian border in Gornja Radgona. He described the experience as something that changed his point of view, as something that had been deemed impossible was actually taking place, \\"as if we were in a movie\\". He was one of the co-editors of the critical alternative journal Nova revija. He also participated in the social liberal think tank Forum 21, led by former President of Slovenia Milan Kuƒçan. He was also, until his death, a professor of cultural studies at the Faculty for Social Studies of the University of Ljubljana. From 2001 he started the journal Sarajevo notebooks, in order to re-establish communication and linkages between intellectuals and activists throughout former Yugoslavia, and create regional public forums of reconciliation. He was married to the columnist, translator and American-Slovenian writer Erica Johnson Debeljak, with whom he had three children. He died on 28 January 2016, when he was struck and killed by a truck. Poetic works Debeljak began publishing poetry in his college years. He was spotted by the poet Veno Taufer who helped him in the literary scene. His first collection of poetry was well received also by the poet Toma≈æ ≈†alamun, who declared Debeljak as the best poet of the young generation of Slovene authors.Toma≈æ ≈†alamun, \\"Intervju z Alojzom Ihanom\\" in Sodobnost, yr. 42, n. 8/9 (1994) Debeljak's poetry is noted for its melancholy and a new reaffirmation of traditional values such as family and God. An opponent to the everything-goes schools of modern thought, such as postmodernism, Debeljak's work was informed by an \\"Enlightenment\\" ideal of right and wrong, good and bad. Debeljak was an extremely prolific writer. In addition to poetry and cultural criticism, Debeljak also worked as a columnist for the most important newspaper in Slovenia, Delo. His works have been translated in many languages.

In 1940 ≈†ariƒá was tasked by the national bishops' conference to put together the first modern Croatian translation of the Bible. A benefactor of the Bosnian Croat population, ≈†ariƒá became a controversial figure because of his pro-Usta≈°e activities and rhetoric, including his support for forcible conversions to Catholicism inside the Independent State of Croatia during World War II.  Early life and career  Ivan ≈†ariƒá was born to a Bosnian Croat family near Travnik, Bosnia and Herzegovina on 27 September 1871. He attended high school in Travnik from 1882 to 1890, entered the seminary in Travnik, and completed his studies in Sarajevo in 1894. He was made a priest in the Vrhbosna Archbishopric on 22 July 1894. He worked as a catechist at the Institute of St. Vinko in Sarajevo from 1894. Two years later, he was named a canon of Vrhbosna. Between 1896 and 1908 he edited the Vrhbosna newspaper, and, for a time, Balkan newspaper. In 1898 the Seminary Faculty in Zagreb awarded him a doctorate. On 27 June 1908, ≈†ariƒá was named bishop-coadjutor of Vrhbosna and the titular bishop of Caesaropolitanus. On 28 October 1908, ≈†ariƒá gave poet Silvije Strahimir Kranjƒçeviƒá the last rites before his death on the following day.Timeline of Silvije Strahimir Kranjƒçeviƒá Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on 28 June 1914, ≈†ariƒá helped inspire anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo by composing anti-Serb verse anthems in which he described Serbs as \\"vipers\\" and \\"ravening wolves\\". On 2 May 1922, ≈†ariƒá was made the archbishop and metropolitan of Vrhbosna. He was a pioneer of Catholic Action (a project of Pope Pius XI for the inclusion of the laity in the hierarchical apostolate of the Church), and took particular interest in the Catholic press. In 1922 he started and for a time edited the weekly Nedjelja (Sunday), which was banned by the authorities of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, then renamed Kri≈æ (The Cross), and finally renamed Katoliƒçki Tjednik (The Catholic Weekly). He printed the Vrhbosanske savremene knji≈æice, small books about the contemporary affairs of the archbishopric, a total of 55 issues up to 1941. He wrote twenty other assorted printed works. In 1925, a year in which the Catholic Church celebrated the Jubilee and the Croats celebrated the 1000th anniversary of the Croatian Kingdom, ≈†ariƒá led the Second National Pilgrimage of Yugoslavia to the Vatican.The Vatican and Croatdom in the first half of the 20th century (until 1941) , cpi.hr ; accessed 30 November 2014. ≈†ariƒá invested much effort into the financing of two seminaries, and encouraged the work of Caritas and missionary activities. He attempted to attract new male orders into the diocese (the Franciscans were already there). He took much interest in the national activities of the Bosnian Croats, and he helped the Croatian cultural society Napredak.  War time activities  ≈†ariƒá was the archbishop of Vrhbosna (with see in Sarajevo) during World War II, when Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the Independent State of Croatia. ≈†ariƒá used the Catholic newspapers of the Sarajevo diocese he headed as an outlet for his political musings as well as his amateur poetry. He expressed goodwill and enthusiasm towards the new Usta≈°e leadership of Ante Paveliƒá in the early months of 1941. This piece appeared a month after the Usta≈°e took power: > \\"I was with our Usta≈°e in North and South America.

The good God heard and, behold, he answered our cries > and supplications.\\"Paevlic Papers (2), krajinaforce.com; accessed 30 > November 2014. In late April 1941, he penned a eulogy to Paveliƒá, Kada Sunca Sija (When the Sun Shines), and had it published by his diocesan periodical Vrhbosna, which included the lines: \\"For God himself was at thy side, thou good and strong one .. So that thou mightest perform thy deeds for the Homeland... And against the Jews, who had all the money ‚Ä¶ Who wanted to sell our souls ‚Ä¶ the miserable traitors ‚Ä¶ Dr Ante Paveliƒá!

Now God has decided to use other methods. He will prepare missions! World missions! They will be upheld not by priests but by army commanders led by Hitler.

The archbishop subsequently appointed Petar ƒåule as vicar for the diocese of Mostar-Duvno. Upon this recommendation Pope Pius XII named ƒåule as bishop. NDH authorities opposed this as they had not been consulted beforehand.

Together with its sister investment banks, it was referred to as CS First Boston after 1993 and part of Credit Suisse First Boston after 1996. The First Boston part of the name was phased out by 2006. History =Founding= The First Boston Corporation was created in 1932 as the investment banking arm of the First National Bank of Boston. It became an independent firm after passage of the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act, which required commercial banks to divest securities businesses in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash. First National Bank of Boston continued as a commercial bank, ultimately becoming part of Bank of America. The young First Boston investment bank was cobbled together from the investment banking arms of major commercial banks. For example, several key members of Chase Harris Forbes Corporation, the securities affiliate of Chase National Bank, joined the new investment bank in 1934. =The 1940s= In 1946, Mellon Securities Corporation, the former investment banking arm of Mellon Bank, merged into the First Boston. Mellon's franchise with industrial and governmental clients led to some major deals: initial public debt offerings for the World Bank and Hydro-Qu√©bec, and a share offering for Gulf Oil Corporation in 1948 (the largest IPO to date). By 1947, the First Boston surpassed $1 billion in new capital issues, and in 1959 it reintroduced the credit of Japan to the American markets with the first offerings by its government since 1930. =The 1970s= As of 1970, First Boston was considered to be part of the bulge bracket along with Morgan Stanley, Dillon Read and Kuhn Loeb.Ron Chernow, \\"The House of Morgan (Simon & Schuster, 1990)\\" By 1970, the Firm was raising more than $10 billion in new capital annually for underwriting clients. In 1971, The First Boston Corporation listed on the New York Stock Exchange developed its equity, sales, research, and trading operations. In 1978, First Boston began its highly successful London operations in partnership with Credit Suisse (see ‚ÄúRelationship with Credit Suisse‚Äù below) and became a leading Eurobond trader and underwriter. =The 1980s - Relationship with Credit Suisse= First Boston logo 1988-1996 Credit Suisse‚Äôs relationship with First Boston began in 1978, when White Weld & Co. was bought by Merrill Lynch. As a result, White Weld dropped out of its London-based investment banking partnership with Credit Suisse. First Boston stepped in, creating Financi√©re Cr√©dit Suisse-First Boston, a 50-50 joint venture widely known as Credit Suisse First Boston. First Boston was not Credit Suisse's first choice for the partnership. When White Weld stepped out, Credit Suisse had unsuccessfully approached Dillon Read, The Spectacular rise and fall of CSFB, by Ian Kerr (Financial News Online - 11 July 2005) (registration required) which a couple decades later was acquired by Swiss Bank Corporation, to form the core of that firm's U.S. investment banking business. Swiss Bank Corporation itself subsequently merged with Credit Suisse archrival Union Bank of Switzerland to form UBS AG. First Boston sat at the top of merger and acquisition league tables in the 1980s, thanks to the team led by Bruce Wasserstein and Joe Perella, which orchestrated such transactions as the leveraged buyout of Federated Stores, which earned First Boston $200 million in fees, A review of Going for Broke: How Robert Campeau Bankrupted the Retail Industry, Jolted the Junk Bond Market, and Brought the Booming Eighties to a Crashing Halt. John Rothchild. New York: Simon & Schuster and Texaco‚Äôs hostile takeover of Getty Oil. A 1985 Fortune Magazine article called First Boston ‚Äúthe archetypal deal factory‚Äù, a year in which it did $60 billion in M&A; deals placing it second after Goldman Sachs.Fortune Magazine. ‚ÄúMerger Fees that Bend the Mind‚Äù (January 1986). By 1987, M&A; advisory work contributed half of First Boston's profit and Wasserstein asked the management committee to divert resources to his unit from bond trading. After being rebuffed, Wasserstein and Perella quit and set up their own firm, Wasserstein Perella & Co. Other famous Alumni from the 1980s include Blackrock CEO Larry Fink and Jefferies CEO Richard Handler. Credit Suisse acquired a 44% stake in First Boston in 1988. The investment bank acquired its shares held by the public and the company was taken private. In 1989, the junk bond market collapsed, leaving First Boston unable to redeem hundreds of millions it had lent for the leveraged buyout of Ohio Mattress Company, maker of Sealy mattresses, a deal that became known as \\"the burning bed\\".The amount lent, $457 million, was 40 percent of First Boston‚Äôs equity capital. See May 1990 article ‚ÄúThe Burning Bed‚Äù in Business Week Credit Suisse bailed them out and acquired a controlling stake in 1990. Although such an arrangement was arguably illegal under the Glass Steagall Act, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. bank regulator, concluded that the integrity of the financial markets was better served by avoiding the bankruptcy of a significant investment bank like First Boston even though it meant a de facto merger of a commercial bank with an investment bank. =The 1990s - Credit Suisse First Boston= Historical Credit Suisse First Boston logo used from 1996 through the rebranding in 2006 Conflict with Credit Suisse First Boston, or CSFB, in Europe began creating problems for Credit Suisse. First Boston in New York and CSFB in London had their own management teams, with competing salesmen in each other‚Äôs territory and in the Pacific region. In 1996, Credit Suisse purchased the remaining stake of CS First Boston from its management and rebranded the European, U.S., and Asia Pacific investment banks as Credit Suisse First Boston, making one global brand. In the late 1990s, CSFB purchased the equity division of Barclays Bank, Barclays de Zoete Wedd (\\"BZW\\"). BZW was considered second-tier and CSFB reportedly bought BZW from Barclays for ¬£1 plus assumption of debt - primarily to obtain BZW's client list. A permanent injunction prevented First Boston from offering shares in Gulf Oil company, due to lack of interest in share offering, and the Iraq Desert Storm campaign. A Nevada judge issued a cease and desist order to stop Barclays from taking American owned assets and offering them to international buyers from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and North Korea. At the same time, the newly global CSFB became a leading high tech banker, acting as lead (or co-lead) underwriter in the IPOs of Amazon.com and Cisco Systems, as well as one time high fliers such as Silicon Graphics, Intuit, Netscape and VA Linux Systems. CSFB also did significant deals for Apple Computer, Compaq and Sun Microsystems among others. In 2000, at the height of the tech boom, technology deals generated $1.4 billion in revenue for CSFB. The head of CSFB‚Äôs tech group, Frank Quattrone, reportedly made $200 million in bonuses between 1998 and 2000.‚ÄúInside Frank Quattrone's Money Machine: The rise and fall of the high-tech investment banker who was an architect of Silicon Valley's financial culture,‚Äù Business Week October 2003. =The 2000s - Acquisition of DLJ, Restructuring and the End of \\"First Boston\\"= In 2000, Credit Suisse First Boston spent $13 billion to buy Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (also known as DLJ) as stock markets were peaking. By the time the acquisition closed in 2001, stock markets were down significantly. The deal led to a culture clash that triggered the departures of key bankers. In order to keep top bankers, CSFB handed them three-year guaranteed contracts, swelling costs relative to revenue and leading to two years of losses at the investment bank. After the collapse in technology shares in 2001, Credit Suisse replaced CSFB‚Äôs CEO Allen Wheat with Morgan Stanley's John Mack, who was charged with turning around the investment bank. Mack fired 10,000 employees, or one-third of CSFB's workforce, although many former DLJ bankers continued to collect guaranteed pay long after they were gone. Also in 2001, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department began investigating how CSFB allocated IPOs of technology companies. The probe led to the conviction of Frank Quattrone in 2004, who was found guilty of urging employees to destroy documents after he learned about the investigation. He was ultimately acquitted of substantially all charges upon appeal in 2006.\\"Frank Quattrone 2.0\\" (Fortune Magazine, September 7, 2006). Credit Suisse retired the First Boston name on January 16, 2006, in order to ‚Äúallow Credit Suisse to communicate as an integrated organization to clients, employees and shareholders.‚Äù The move led some to speculate that the name change reflected the diminished luster of the once great First Boston name as a result of years of mismanagement and scandal.See Ian Kerr article. However, its strategy is consistent with that of other large, international financial conglomerates. Citigroup has eliminated the Salomon Brothers name from its investment banking business, and UBS AG has done the same with the SG Warburg, Dillon Read and Paine Webber names. Deutsche Bank has effectively retired the Bankers Trust and Morgan Grenfell names.

A triol is a molecule with three alcohol groups. Approximately 150,000 tonnes were produced in 1999. It is a colourless compound although samples may appear yellow because of impurities. Production Triethanolamine is produced from the reaction of ethylene oxide with aqueous ammonia, also produced are ethanolamine and diethanolamine. The ratio of the products can be controlled by changing the stoichiometry of the reactants. :400px Applications Triethanolamine is used primarily in making surfactants, such as for emulsifier. It is a common ingredient in formulations used for both industrial and consumer products. The triethanolamine neutralizes fatty acids, adjusts and buffers the pH, and solubilizes oils and other ingredients that are not completely soluble in water. Triethanolammonium salts in some cases are more soluble than salts of alkali metals that might be used otherwise, and results in less alkaline products than would from using alkali metal hydroxides to form the salt. Some common products in which triethanolamine is found are sunscreen lotions, liquid laundry detergents, dishwashing liquids, general cleaners, hand sanitizers, polishes, metalworking fluids, paints, shaving cream and printing inks. =Cement production= Triethanolamine is also used as organic additive (0.1 wt%) in the grinding of cement clinker. It facilitates the grinding process by preventing agglomeration and coating of the powder at the surface of balls and mill wall. =Cosmetics and medicine= Various ear diseases and infections are treated with eardrops containing triethanolamine polypeptide oleate-condensate, such as Cerumenex in the United States. In pharmaceutics, triethanolamine is the active ingredient of some eardrops used to treat impacted earwax. It also serves as a pH balancer in many different cosmetic products, ranging from cleansing creams and milks, skin lotions, eye gels, moisturizers, shampoos, shaving foams, and so on. TEOA is a fairly strong base: a 1% solution has a pH of approximately 10, whereas the pH of skin is less than pH 7, approximately 5.5‚àí6.0. Cleansing milk‚Äìcream emulsions based on TEOA are particularly good at removing makeup. =Derivatives= #Amustaline #Trolnitrate #Trimustine =In the laboratory and in amateur photography= Another common use of TEOA is as a complexing agent for aluminium ions in aqueous solutions. This reaction is often used to mask such ions before complexometric titrations with another chelating agent such as EDTA. TEOA has also been used in photographic (silver halide) processing. It has been promoted as a useful alkali by amateur photographers. =In holography= TEOA is used to provide a sensitivity boost to silver-halide-based holograms, and also as a swelling agent to color shift holograms. It is possible to get the sensitivity boost without color shift by rinsing out the TEA before squeegee and drying. =In electroless plating= TEOA is now commonly and very effectively used as a complexing agent in electroless plating. =In ultrasonic testing= 2-3% in water TEOA is used as an corrosion inhibitor (anti-rust) agent in immersion ultrasonic testing. =In aluminium soldering= Triethanolamine, diethanolamine and aminoethylethanolamine are major components of common liquid organic fluxes for the soldering of aluminium alloys using tin-zinc and other tin or lead- based soft solders. Safety and regulation =Allergic reactions= A 1996 study found that triethanolamine (TEOA) occasionally causes contact allergy. A 2001 study found TEOA in a sunscreen caused an allergic contact dermatitis. A 2007 study found TEOA in ear drops caused a contact allergy. Systemic and respiratory tract (RT) toxicity was analyzed for 28 days in a nose specific inhalation 2008 study in Wistar rats; TEOA seems to be less potent in regard to systemic toxicity and RT irritancy than diethanolamine (DEA). Exposure to TEOA resulted in focal inflammation, starting in single male animals from 20 mg/m3 concentrations. A 2009 study stated that patch test reactions reveal a slight irritant potential instead of a true allergic response in several cases, and also indicated the risk of skin sensitization to TEOA seems to be very low. =Tumors= Reports indicated that TEOA causes an increased incidence of tumor growth in the liver in female B6C3F1 mice, but not in male mice or in Fischer 344 rats. A 2004 study concluded \\"TEOA may cause liver tumors in mice via a choline-depletion mode of action and that this effect is likely caused by the inhibition of choline uptake by cells.\\" =Environmental toxicity= A 2009 study found that TEOA has potential acute, sub-chronic and chronic toxicity properties in respect to aquatic species. =Regulation= TEOA is listed under Schedule 3, part B of the Chemical Weapons Convention as it can be used in the manufacture of HN3 nitrogen mustard.

It is located at 360 Lynn Fells Parkway in Melrose, Massachusetts, United States and is Melrose's only high school. Enrollment for the 2010-2011 school year is 987 students. The school is accredited by the New England Association of Schools & Colleges (NEASC) and is a member of the METCO program. History =1868‚Äì1897: first high school= Melrose High School began teaching children in the 1800s and has called several buildings home. The oldest known location is on West Emerson Street where the Melrose Public Library now stands. On March 30, 1868, Melrose appropriated $20,000 for the construction of the high school on a lot located on the corner of West Emerson Street and Lake Avenue. An Additional $7,500 was added to the price tag of the school on January 19, 1869 and on July 15, 1869, the school was finished and dedicated. Almost thirty years later on January 25, 1897, a fire destroyed the building. Melrose High School (1898‚Äì1931) =1898‚Äì1931: second high school= The building on West Emerson Street quickly became too small for the growing community and so at the town meeting held on February 24, 1896, the town allocated $100,000 for the building of a new high school. The town selected a lot of land known as the \\"Old Burial Ground\\" on Main Street across from the Central Fire Station as the location for the new school building. On August 1, 1898, an additional $3,000 was appropriated for site work around the building. The school was dedicated on September 17, 1898 and at the time, was one of the \\"finest school buildings to be found in New England\\". Two additional wings were added to the main building and opened in 1909. =1932‚Äì1974: third high school= Melrose High School (1932‚Äì1974) In 1932, another new school was built and the previous school building became the Calvin Coolidge Elementary School. This time the new building was built on swamp land taken from Ell Pond on Lynn Fells Parkway. It was a very large school, featuring a 900-seat Auditorium and a full size gymnasium. 1961 saw the addition of the Daffinee Gymnasium which contained new locker rooms for both basketball and football and also extra classroom space. The addition also included the construction of a three-floor annex attached by a bridge. Many historians praised the main building for its period design and architectural beauty. =1975‚Äì2004: fourth high school= Melrose High School (1975‚Äìpresent) In 1975, a new \\"modern\\" Melrose High School opened next-door to the old one, which became the middle school. This building is renowned for its \\"open spaces,\\" which were large open areas with movable walls. Less than half of the buildings classrooms were in open spaces and the rest were triangular in shape. The school was supposedly built by an architect who also designed prisons and the building style reflects this. Numerous classrooms contain no windows and masonry is the main building material. Windows appear in a select few classrooms and are plentiful, yet most don't open. There is a constantly running air circulation system to combat the window problem and this also cools the building in the summer. =2005‚Äìpresent: renovations= In Summer 2005, walls were constructed in the second- and third-floor open spaces creating fourteen separate classrooms. The work was done in conjunction with the project to build a new middle school on the site of the third high school and done as a requirement of an NEASC accreditation report. For two years while the construction of the new middle school occurred, eighth-graders occupied the new classrooms. After Summer 2007, regular high school classes resumed in the former open space. On October 16, 2007, Mayor Robert Dolan announced that the building would undergo major renovations within the next four years. The $3‚Äì4 million renovation will include the installation of \\"SmartBoards\\" in all 78 classrooms, improved lighting, roof replacement, and repainting the entire school. The first phase, with construction that occurred in Summer 2008, costing $1.44 million and was for the installation and purchase of the \\"SmartBoards\\" and the electrical work needed to accommodate the additional technology for the boards. This phase also added or improved internet, phone, and cable television connections throughout the school. By the start of the 2008-09 school year, September 4, 2008, 70 fixed position smart boards and four portable ones were ready for use. During the year 2012 to 2013 the high school underwent major renovation of its science classrooms. The school put money into replacing all of its dated science classrooms with ones that include updated appliances and labs. The classrooms were finished and ready for use in September 2013. The newly renovated classrooms were completed with new computers and state of the art labs. School life The school has several successful sports programs, the most notable being the recent success of their undefeated 2019 Super Bowling winning football team. Also notable are its wide array of clubs, many of which are active within the community.

It started as Canadian carriage works of William Gray & Sons Company Ltd, founded in 1855 by William Gray. In the mid 1900s Robert Gray (William's father, then president of the company) began to build Ford bodies for the Walkerville factory. They continued to do so until 1912. During this period, they also built bodies for the locally built Chatham. Gray-Dort newspaper ad from 1921. In 1915, Robert Gray obtained the Canadian rights to manufacture the Dort automobile from Flint automobile manufacturer J. Dallas Dort and that year Gray-Dort was formed. They produced two models the first year, a Model 4 roadster, and a Model 5 touring car. Over the years, Gray-Dort became known for their cars of reliable quality, which started easily in all weather conditions. A full range of body styles was offered ‚Äì tourer, coupe and sedan. In 1923, after several years of successful but stressful business, J. Dallas Dort decided he wanted to leave the automobile business, and Robert Gray could not dissuade him. A few months later, Dallas Dort died while playing golf. Their easy access to U.S. sources of engineering and mechanical parts having abruptly come to a close, the company began to lose money. Gray-Dort scrambled to find another U.S.-based partner to no avail, and the last few years of its life were spent liquidating assets.http://projects.windsorpubliclibrary.com/digi/wow/plants/gray-dort.htm Over the course of its lifetime, Gray-Dort manufactured around 26,000 automobiles.

The genus name is New Latin from the Greek word for 'thorn' from the habit of many species originally included in the genus. In the early 2000s when it had become evident that the genus as it stood was not monophyletic and that several divergent lineages needed to be placed in separate genera. It turned out that one lineage comprising over 900 species mainly native to Australia New Guinea and Indonesia was not closely related to the much smaller group of African lineage that contained A. nilotica‚Äîthe type species. This meant that the Australasian lineage (by far the most prolific in number of species) would need to be renamed. Botanist Les Pedley named this group Racosperma, which was not adopted. Australian botanists proposed a less disruptive solution setting a different type species (A. penninervis) and allowing this largest number of species to remain Acacia, resulting in the two African lineages being renamed Vachellia and Senegalia, and the two New World lineages renamed Acaciella and Mariosousa. This was officially adopted. Acacia remains a widely used common name across Genera . A number of species have been introduced to various parts of the world, and two million hectares of commercial plantations have been established. The heterogeneous group varies considerably in habit, from mat-like subshrubs to canopy trees in forest. Taxonomy The genus was first validly named in 1754 by Philip Miller. Only the name of the genus, Miller did not validly publish names of species in this work as he did not consistently use binomial names. In 1913 Nathaniel Lord Britton and Addison Brown selected Mimosa scorpioides (‚â° Acacia scorpioides () = Acacia nilotica () ), a species from Africa, as the lectotype of the name. The genus as recognized in 1986 contained 1352 species. That year however, Les Pedley published a paper in which he questioned the monophyletic nature of the genus, and proposed a split into three genera: Acacia sensu stricto (161 species), Senegalia (231 species) and Racosperma (960 species), the last name first proposed in 1829 by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius as the name of a section in Acacia, but raised to generic rank in 1835. In 2003, Pedley published a paper with 834 new combinations in Racosperma for species, most of which were formerly placed in Acacia. All but 10 of these species are native to Australasia, where it constitutes the largest plant genus. In 2003, Anthony Orchard and Bruce Maslin filed a proposal to conserve the name Acacia with a different type in order to retain the Australasian group of species in the genus Acacia. Following a controversial decision to choose a new type for Acacia in 2005, the Australian component of Acacia s.l. now retains the name Acacia. At the 2011 International Botanical Congress held in Melbourne, the decision to use the name Acacia, rather than the proposed Racosperma for this genus, was upheld. Other Acacia s.l. taxa continue to be called Acacia by those who choose to consider the entire group as one genus. Australian species of the genus Paraserianthes s.l. are deemed its closest relatives, particularly P. lophantha. The nearest relatives of Acacia and Paraserianthes s.l. in turn include the Australian and South East Asian genera Archidendron, Archidendropsis, Pararchidendron and Wallaceodendron, all of the tribe Ingeae. =Etymology= The origin of \\"wattle\\" may be an Old Teutonic word meaning \\"to weave\\". From around 700 A.D. watul was used in Old English to refer to the interwoven branches and sticks which formed fences, walls and roofs. Since about 1810 it refers to the Australian legumes that provide these branches. =Species= One species of Acacia (sensu stricto) is native to Madagascar, one to Reunion island, 12 to Asia, and the remaining species (over 900) are native to Australasia and the Pacific Islands. These species were all given combinations by Pedley when he erected the genus Racosperma, hence Acacia pulchella, for example, became Racosperma pulchellum. However these were not upheld with the retypification of Acacia. Evolution Acacias in Australia probably evolved their fire resistance about 20 million years ago when fossilised charcoal deposits show a large increase, indicating that fire was a factor even then. With no major mountain ranges or rivers to prevent their spread, the wattles began to spread all over the continent as it dried and fires became more common. They began to form dry, open forests with species of the genera Allocasuarina, Eucalyptus and Callitris (cypress-pines). The southernmost species in the genus are Acacia dealbata (silver wattle), Acacia longifolia (coast wattle or Sydney golden wattle), Acacia mearnsii (black wattle), and Acacia melanoxylon (blackwood), reaching 43¬∞30' S in Tasmania, Australia.

White, Reed Books Pty Ltd, Australia, Reprinted issue 1988, Distribution and habitat They are present in all terrestrial habitats, including alpine settings, rainforests, woodlands, grasslands, coastal dunes and deserts. In drier woodlands or forest they are an important component of the understory. Elsewhere they may be dominant, as in the Brigalow Belt, Myall woodlands and the eremaean Mulga woodlands. In Australia, Acacia forest is the second most common forest type after eucalypt forest, covering or 8% of total forest area. Acacia is also the nation's largest genus of flowering plants with almost 1,000 species found. Description Several of its species bear vertically oriented phyllodes, which are green, broadened leaf petioles that function like leaf blades, an adaptation to hot climates and droughts. Some phyllodinous species have a colourful aril on the seed. A few species have cladodes rather than leaves. Uses Aboriginal Australians have traditionally harvested the seeds of some species, to be ground into flour and eaten as a paste or baked into a cake. The seeds contain as much as 25% more protein than common cereals, and they store well for long periods due to the hard seed coats. In addition to utilizing the edible seed and gum, the people employed the timber for implements, weapons, fuel and musical instruments. A number of species, most notably A. mangium (hickory wattle), A. mearnsii (black wattle) and A. saligna (coojong), are economically important and are widely planted globally for wood products, tannin, firewood and fodder. A. melanoxylon (blackwood) and A. aneura (mulga) supply some of the most attractive timbers in the genus. Black wattle bark supported the tanning industries of several countries, and may supply tannins for production of waterproof adhesives. Acacia is a common food source and host plant for butterflies of the genus Jalmenus. The imperial hairstreak, Jalmenus evagoras, feeds on at least 25 acacia species. Wattle bark collected in Australia in the 19th century was exported to Europe where it was used in the tanning process. One ton of wattle or mimosa bark contained about of pure tannin.The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge Vol II, (1847) Charles Knight, London, p.873. In ancient Egypt, an ointment made from the ground leaves of an Acacia (senso latu) was used to treat hemorrhoids. Acacia (senso latu) is repeatedly mentioned in the Book of Exodus, perhaps referring to Vachellia tortilis (previously known as Acacia raddiana), in regards to the construction of the Tabernacle. The hardened sap of various species of the acacia tree (senso latu) are known as acacia gum. Acacia gum is used as an emulsifier in food, a binder for watercolour painting, an additive to ceramic glazes, a binding in gum bichromate photography, a protective layer in the lithographic processes and as a binder to bind together fireworks. Acacia honey is not collected from plants in the acacia family, but rather from Robinia pseudoacacia, known as black locust in North America. Honey collected from Caragana arborescens is sometimes also called (yellow) acacia honey. See also Monofloral honey. Acacia is mentioned in an ancient Egyptian proverb referred to by Amenhotep II, \\"If you lack a gold battle-axe inlaid with bronze, a heavy club of acacia wood will do?\\".Erik Hornung 'The Pharaoh' in Sergio Donadoni, The Egyptians, The University of Chicago Press, 1997. p. 291 =Cultivation= Some species of acacia - notably A. baileyana, A. dealbata and A. pravissima - are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The 1889 publication 'Useful native plants of Australia' describes various uses for eating. =Toxicity= Some species of acacia contain psychoactive alkaloids, and some contain potassium fluoroacetate, a rodent poison.

According to an externalist position, one can claim without contradiction that two speakers could be in exactly the same brain state at the time of an utterance, and yet mean different things by that utterance, that is, the term picks out a different extension. Overview The philosopher Hilary Putnam (1975/1985) proposed this position and summarized it with the statement \\"meanings just ain't in the head!\\" Although he did not use the term \\"externalism\\" at the time, Putnam is thought to have pioneered semantic externalism in his 1975 paper \\"The Meaning of 'Meaning. His Twin Earth thought experiment, from the aforementioned paper, is widely cited to illustrate his argument for externalism to this day. Alongside Putnam, credit also goes to Saul Kripke and Tyler Burge, both of whom attacked internalism for independent reasons, providing a foundation on which Putnam's attacks rested. Externalism is generally thought to be a necessary consequence of any causal theory of reference; since the causal history of a term is not internal, the involvement of that history in determining the term's referent is enough to satisfy the externalist thesis. However, Putnam and many subsequent externalists have maintained that not only reference, but sense as well is determined, at least in part, by external factors (see sense and reference). While it is common to shorten \\"semantic externalism\\" to \\"externalism\\" within the context of the debate, one must be careful in doing so, as there are several distinct debates in philosophy that employ the terms \\"externalism\\" and \\"internalism\\".  Arguments for externalism  Putnam presented a variety of arguments for the externalist position, the most famous being those that concerned Twin Earth. Subsequent philosophers have produced other, related thought experiments, most notably Donald Davidson's swamp man experiment. However, there have been numerous arguments for externalism that do not involve science-fiction scenarios. Putnam pointed out, for instance, that he has no knowledge that could distinguish elm trees from beech trees. He has precisely the same concept of one as of the other: \\"a deciduous tree growing in North America\\". Yet when Putnam makes a statement containing the word \\"elm\\", we take him to be referring specifically to elms. If he makes a claim about a property of elm trees, it will be considered true or false, depending upon whether that property applies to those trees which are in fact elms. There is nothing \\"in the head\\" that could fix his reference thus; rather, he concluded, his linguistic community, containing some speakers who did know the difference between the two trees, ensured that when he said \\"elm\\", he referred to elms. Putnam refers to this feature of language as \\"the division of linguistic labor\\".

He served in the state legislatures of both states and represented Kentucky in the United States Senate from 1795 to 1801. He was a member of the Marshall political family which included his cousins Chief Justice of the United States John Marshall, federal judge James Markham Marshall, and noted educator Louis Marshall. All the prominent members of this family were Federalists. Marshall was also the father of Congressman Thomas Alexander Marshall and the grandfather of Congressman and Confederate General Humphrey Marshall. During the Revolutionary War, Marshall served with the Virginia State Regiment of Artillery. After the war, he moved to the Kentucky District of Virginia where he became extremely wealthy as a farmer and surveyor. He was a delegate to two of the ten Kentucky statehood conventions and was one of only three delegates from the Kentucky District to vote in favor of ratifying the U.S. Constitution at the 1788 Virginia Ratifying Convention. After Kentucky gained statehood in 1792, Marshall was elected to the state legislature despite the fact that he was a Federalist and zealously antireligious - both of which made him unpopular with many Kentuckians. The Federalist cause received a slight boost when federal forces were successful in quashing the Whiskey Rebellion and ending the Indian threat at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. As a result, the General Assembly elected Marshall to the U.S. Senate in 1794. As a senator, Marshall clung to Federalist principles, supporting the Alien and Sedition Acts and voting to ratify the Jay Treaty. For the latter action, his constituents stoned him and tried to throw him in the Kentucky River. In 1801, he was defeated for reelection by John Breckinridge. He would once again be elected to the state legislature in 1807, 1808, and 1823. During the 1809 legislative session, a disagreement between him and Henry Clay led to a duel between the two men in which both were slightly wounded. As early as 1786, Marshall had been implicating several prominent Kentucky politicians in a scheme to take Kentucky out of the Union and into alliance with Spain. After the expiration of his Senate term, he resumed these charges through the pages of the Western World newspaper. His allegations resulted in a legislative investigation of Kentucky Court of Appeals judge Benjamin Sebastian, who was found to be receiving a pension from Spain and resigned from the bench. Federal judge Harry Innes was also a target of Marshall's allegations, and the two became embroiled in a legal battle that lasted almost a decade. Innes hired William Littell to write and publish a book giving Innes' version of his dealings with Spain. Marshall countered by publishing his History of Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most widely read history of the state at the time. Marshall and Innes ended their legal battle with an agreement, signed in 1815, that neither would publish anything negative about the other again. Innes upheld his part of the agreement, but in 1824, years after Innes' death, Marshall published an updated edition of his History of Kentucky which was just as vitriolic as the previous version had been. Marshall faded from public life during his later years. He died at the home of his son in Lexington, Kentucky on July 3, 1841. Early life Humphrey Marshall was born in Orlean, Virginia in 1760.\\"Marshall, Humphrey\\". Biographical Directory of the United States Congress He was the son of John and Mary (Quisenberry) Marshall and apparently named in honor of his maternal grandfather, Humphrey Quisenberry.Quisenberry, p. 9 Marshall's father was a man of meager means despite being a member of a prominent Virginia family.\\"Humphrey Marshall\\". Dictionary of American Biography Little is known of Marshall's early years, but one tradition holds that he had no formal education during his childhood and that his cousin Mary (later, his wife) taught him to read.Quisenberry, p. 10 Eventually, John sent Humphrey to live with his brother, Thomas Marshall, and to be educated by the same Scottish tutors that educated Thomas' children.Quisenberry, p. 11 Among Thomas' children (Humphrey's cousins) were John Marshall, future Chief Justice of the United States; James Markham Marshall, future federal judge; and Louis Marshall, a noted educator. In addition, one of Thomas' daughters, Nancy Marshall, married Joseph Hamilton Daveiss, a future U.S. Attorney. After receiving his education, Marshall became a surveyor. On January 4, 1778, Marshall enlisted as a cadet for a three-year term in the Virginia State Regiment of Artillery for service in the Revolutionary War.Quisenberry, p. 12 The unit was under the command of his uncle Thomas, who held the rank of colonel. Marshall was assigned to the company of Captain Elisha Edwards. Most of his service records have been lost, but according to his pension application, he held the rank of third lieutenant later in 1778, first lieutenant in 1779, and on December 18, 1789, he was promoted to the rank of captain lieutenant. When the three-year commitment of Marshall and his fellow soldiers expired, their unit was disbanded; on February 6, 1781, Marshall was designated a supernumerary officer.Quisenberry, pp. 12-13 He ended his military service in 1782, and was rewarded with of land on the western frontier.Tachau, p. 609 In 1782, Marshall moved to present-day Kentucky and became deputy surveyor of Fayette County, again serving under his uncle Thomas. Settling in Lexington, he purchased a lot in 1783.Quisenberry, p. 16 On September 18, 1784, he married his cousin, Anna Maria (\\"Mary\\") Marshall, Thomas' daughter, . The couple had two sons, Thomas Alexander Marshall, who became a US Congressman; and John Jay Marshall, father of Congressman and Confederate general Humphrey Marshall. They also had a daughter who was killed in infancy by lightning.Biographical Cyclopedia, p. 280 Shortly after the creation of Woodford County, Marshall moved within its borders and was appointed county surveyor by Virginia Governor Beverley Randolph.Quisenberry, p. 54 In this capacity, he surveyed and claimed significant additional tracts of land, becoming one of Kentucky's most wealthy citizens. According to tradition, Marshall was known to boast that he could ride from Frankfort to Versailles, a distance of some , and never enter a tract of land that he didn't own. He was also supposed to have boasted that he measured his silver coinage by the peck, not having time to count the individual coins. Marshall did not believe in rule by the masses, frequently expressing his disdain for the common people. His sharp wit and lack of tact in writing did little to endear him to his neighbors. Like most of the members of his family, he subscribed to Federalist principles, although the majority of Kentuckians were affiliated with the Democratic-Republicans. He was also ostracized by many of his neighbors for being zealously antireligious.Tachau, p. 610 He wrote pamphlets denouncing religion of all kinds and published them at his own expense.Quisenberry, p. 19 His later descendants were so embarrassed of his anti-religious writings that they had his personal papers burned. Early political career A 1788 letter in the Kentucky Gazette indicated that Marshall had unsuccessfully sought election to the Virginia General Assembly, although the year of the contest is not given.Quisenberry, p. 22 The letter continued that the defeat convinced Marshall that he could not win elected office in Fayette County and that he subsequently lobbied for the creation of Bourbon County, hoping that he might gain an office in that new county. When the county was created in 1785, he immediately applied to become the county lieutenant, but that office had apparently already been promised to someone else. Marshall applied for appointment as deputy lieutenant, and received the appointment. Although it is not known when Marshall began studying law, nor who his tutor was, he was practicing as early as 1785.Quisenberry, p. 20 In that year, he discovered a flaw in the original 1774 survey of the town of Frankfort. Due to the flaw, several choice acres of land in the northern part of Frankfort remained unclaimed, and Marshall quickly entered claims for them at the land office. Marshall also gained membership in the Kentucky Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge, a Danville-based society dedicated to disseminating information to farmers, mechanics, and other common citizens.Quisenberry, p. 23 He apparently was not accepted for membership in the Danville Political Club, although some sources report that he was accepted as a member after initially being rejected.Quisenberry, p. 24 James Wilkinson, accused by Marshall of conspiring with Spain Around 1786, Marshall gained public attention by expressing his suspicions about James Wilkinson's negotiations with Spain for free use of the Mississippi River and the possibility of Kentucky's secession from the United States to affiliate with Spanish possessions. For the remainder of his life, he vigorously opposed Wilkinson and anyone else he suspected of being involved with the Spanish Conspiracy. Marshall was a delegate to a 1787 convention in Danville to consider separating Kentucky from Virginia. There were, at that time, two primary positions with regard to the question of separation.Quisenberry, p. 46 The first favored an immediate separation with or without Virginia's consent, while the other favored waiting for legal approval from Virginia and the U.S. Congress. Marshall was among the latter group, and his uncle Thomas was the primary spokesman for this position. Biographer Anderson Chenault Quisenberry notes, \\"As to Humphrey Marshall's prominence in the Danville convention, or as to what notable part he acted there, nothing is said by the historians.\\" In 1788, Marshall announced his candidacy to be a delegate to the Virginia Ratifying Convention.Quisenberry, p. 30 The proposed constitution was very unpopular in all parts of Kentucky except Jefferson County, but Marshall openly favored its ratification. Hoping to wreck Marshall's candidacy, a man named Jordan Harris charged that Marshall had, in a letter to John Crittenden, Sr., acknowledged himself to be a liar.Quisenberry, p. 31 In the pages of the Kentucky Gazette, Marshall called on Harris to publish the letter. Harris was so insulted by Marshall's demand that he threatened to cane him. At their next meeting, Harris fired two pistols at Marshall.Quisenberry, p. 32 Neither shot injured Marshall, who retaliated by beating Harris with a stick severely enough to force his retreat from the encounter. Despite his favorable position toward the proposed federal constitution, Marshall was chosen as a delegate to the convention from Fayette County. On June 25, 1788, he joined Jefferson County delegates Robert Breckinridge and Rice Bullock in voting for ratification.Quisenberry, p. 25 Ten other Kentucky delegates opposed ratification and one abstained.Harrison and Klotter, p. 59 The final convention vote was 89-79 in favor of ratification. It was reported that even the Jefferson County delegates were beginning to waver in their commitment to the proposed constitution, but that Marshall steeled their resolve and also influenced several delegates from other parts of Virginia to favor it. In 1789 Marshall was elected again to a convention to consider separation from Virginia. After Kentucky's separation from Virginia in 1792, he was elected to represent Woodford County in the Kentucky House of Representatives.Quisenberry, p. 55 The most notable piece of legislation he authored was an act that simplified the classification and taxation of land. He was reelected to his position in 1794. He opposed allocating men or supplies for George Rogers Clark's proposed attack upon the Spanish at New Orleans. The attack was promoted by Edmond-Charles Gen√™t, and Marshall accused sitting governor Isaac Shelby of complicity in the matter. U.S. Senate John Breckinridge, Marshall's opponent for the U.S. Senate Partly as a result of Marshall's attacks on prominent Democratic-Republicans such as Governor Shelby, the Federalists gained influence in the state legislature. The Federalist cause was also bolstered by the quashing of the Whiskey Rebellion by federal forces in 1794, and the federal victory over the Northwest Indians at the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794.Quisenberry, p. 56 Later that year, the Federalists in the General Assembly nominated Marshall for the United States Senate.Harrison and Klotter, p. 75 On the first ballot, Marshall garnered 18 votes, compared with 16 for Democratic-Republican John Breckinridge, 8 for John Fowler, and 7 for incumbent John Edwards. On the runoff ballot that followed, Marshall defeated Breckinridge by a vote of 28-22. Shortly after Marshall departed for Philadelphia, the temporary national capital, George Muter and Benjamin Sebastian, both justices of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, published a pamphlet stating that Marshall had perjured himself in a Court of Appeals case between himself and James Wilkinson.Quisenberry, p. 63 No known copies of the pamphlet are extant, and related surviving documents do not relate the exact nature of the charges. Marshall, being out of the state, was unable to reply immediately to the charges, and his enemies in the General Assembly drafted a memorial to the U.S. Senate requesting an investigation of the charges. On December 16, 1795, the memorial was approved by the General Assembly and transmitted to the Senate.Quisenberry, p. 66 The Senate appointed a committee to recommend action on the memorial, and the committee found that the charges against Marshall were not specific, that the authors had provided no evidence upon which to evaluate the charges, that no one was empowered to prosecute the charges in the Senate, and that further action by the Senate was inappropriate.Quisenberry, pp. 68-70 On March 22, 1796, the Senate approved the committee's report by a vote of 16-8.Quisenberry, p. 68 Muter and Sebastian never filed formal charges against Marshall for perjury.Quisenberry, p. 70 Although Marshall was not frequently active in debate on the Senate floor, he was a strong advocate of nearly every Federalist measure considered in that body.Quisenberry, p. 57 Many of these were unpopular in Kentucky, including the Alien and Sedition Acts. Marshall's vote in favor of the Jay Treaty was particularly unpopular with his constituents, and when he returned home after the vote, a mob of angry citizens in Frankfort stoned him. Next, the mob tried to throw Marshall into the Kentucky River. Marshall appealed to the Baptists in the crowd, declaring, \\"Now allow me to say that according to Baptist rules, it is irregular to administer baptism before the receiver gives his experience. If you are determined to proceed, let the exercise be performed in decent order. Let me give my experience first.\\" The thought of hearing a religious testimony from Marshall, a noted atheist, so humored the mob that it disbanded in a fit of laughter, and Marshall escaped. In the subsequent senatorial election, however, Breckinridge defeated Marshall for his seat. Later political career After the expiration of his Senate term in 1801, Marshall returned to his farm and his law practice, seldom acting in the realm of public affairs.Quisenberry, p. 71 In 1806, however, he resumed his attacks on suspected participants in the Spanish Conspiracy. His articles in the newly founded Frankfort Western World newspaper - written under the pseudonym \\"Observer\\" - prompted the Kentucky House of Representatives to form a select committee to investigate his charges. The committee found that Benjamin Sebastian had received a pension of $2,000 a year from Spain in return for his involvement in the Conspiracy.Harrison and Klotter, p. 74 Federal judge Harry Innes, a frequent object of Marshall's suspicions, testified against Sebastian before the committee. Sebastian resigned his position on the Court, and the House declined to pursue further action against him. Marshall also unsuccessfully lobbied through his brother-in-law, U.S. Attorney Joseph Hamilton Daveiss, for a grand jury to indict Aaron Burr for attempting to enlist Kentuckians to participate in the Burr conspiracy. Marshall's intensified attacks on Judge Harry Innes in the pages of the Western World became so severe that they prompted Innes to sue both Marshall and Western World co-founder Joseph M. Street for libel.Quisenberry, p. 78 Both cases dragged on for several years in the courts. Buoyed by his involvement in the exposure of Benjamin Sebastian, Marshall declared his candidacy for a seat in the Kentucky House in 1807.Quisenberry, p. 97 Friends of Innes and others implicated by Marshall in the Spanish Conspiracy recruited Nathaniel Richardson, a lawyer turned farmer, to oppose Marshall. Approximately 1,100 votes were cast, and Marshall was elected by a majority of 11 votes.Quisenberry, pp. 97-98 Marshall's biographer records that \\"the records of Humphrey Marshall's services in the Legislature at this time are scanty, the journals of the session being not in existence, as it is believed; or, at any rate, extremely rare.\\"Quisenberry, p. 99 He is believed to have introduced a measure that reduced the limitation on ejectments from twenty years to seven. =Duel with Henry Clay= Henry Clay fought a duel with Marshall on January 19, 1809. Marshall sought reelection in 1808 and defeated his opponent, John M. Scott, by a majority of 11 votes, identical to his margin the previous year.Quisenberry, p. 90 Expectations of a confrontation between Marshall and fellow representative Henry Clay were high during the session, owing to tensions between the two dating back to Clay's defense of Aaron Burr during the Burr conspiracy.Quisenberry, p. 100 George D. Prentice, in his biography of Clay, records that some of Clay's allies in the House refused to vote for him for Speaker of the House so that Clay would remain on the chamber floor, from whence he was better able to counter Marshall. Clay's chair in the chamber was separated from Marshall's only by that of General Christopher Riffe, the representative from Lincoln County, who was described as \\"a burly German of almost gigantic size and herculean strength\\". A few minor quarrels passed between Marshall and Clay early in the session, but the relative peace dissolved in December 1808 when Clay introduced a resolution calling for all members of the General Assembly to wear \\"homespun\\" garments as a means of encouraging local manufacturing and reducing British imports.Harrison and Klotter, p. 90 Although Clay typically wore finer garments than Marshall, for the duration of the debate on his motion, Clay wore simple homemade clothes. Marshall regarded the measure as demagoguery and employed a tailor to make him a suit of British broadcloth to wear on the House floor. The two men exchanged insults on the House floor and would have commenced a physical altercation if not for Riffe's intervention. Instead, on January 4, 1809, Clay challenged Marshall to a duel, which he quickly accepted.Quisenberry, p. 101 The duel took place in Indiana on January 19, 1809, just across the Ohio River from Shippingport, Kentucky. Joseph Hamilton Daveiss provided the pistols.Quisenberry, p. 103 On the first shot, Marshall missed and Clay lightly grazed Marshall's stomach. Marshall missed again on the second shot, and Clay's pistol misfired. Marshall's third shot lightly wounded Clay in the thigh, while Clay missed Marshall entirely. Clay insisted that the two each take another shot, but Marshall declined on grounds that Clay's injury put him on unequal footing with his adversary, and the matter was ended. =Expulsion from and reelection to the House= Tensions between Marshall and Innes continued during Marshall's tenure in the legislature. When Innes, acting on a recommendation from an advisory jury, dismissed an unrelated fraud case brought by Marshall in Innes' district court, Marshall retaliated by convincing Congressman John Rowan to file an impeachment petition against Innes in the House of Representatives. Innes countered by having his son-in-law, Thomas Bodley, pursue a censure of Marshall in the state House. Rowan's petition against Innes failed, but Bodley's against Marshall succeeded, and Marshall was expelled from the House in 1808, only to be re-elected the following year. Marshall sought reelection in 1810, but was defeated by George Adams by a margin of 76 votes.Quisenberry, p. 111 From 1812 to 1813, he served on the board of trustees for the city of Frankfort.Quisenberry, p. 21 He made another unsuccessful run for the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1813, losing to John Arnold.Quisenberry, p. 112 After a long absence from politics, Marshall was called to one final act of public service. Upon the death of Martin D. Hardin who had been elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1823 but died before he could take office, Marshall pursued an abbreviated campaign for the vacant seat and defeated Jeptha Dudley by a margin of 3 votes. The primary issue of the day was the Old Court ‚Äì New Court controversy, an attempt by the legislature to abolish the extant Court of Appeals and replace it with a new court in retaliation for overturning a replevin law passed in a previous legislative session. Marshall enjoyed a higher level of support in this election by virtue of his support for the Old Court, which was the prevailing sentiment in his district. His actions in the session, however, appear to have been unremarkable, and he did not seek reelection at the end of his term. Later life and death Harry Innes and Marshall engaged in a long legal battle over Innes' alleged role in the Spanish Conspiracy. After his political career, Marshall became more interested in writing. He frequently contributed content to the state's newspapers and occasionally wrote poetry. He founded the American Republic, the only Federalist newspaper in the state, and published its first issue on June 26, 1810.Quisenberry, p. 113 Newspapers sympathetic to the Democratic-Republicans soon derided the American Republic as \\"The Snake\\". Undaunted, Marshall added a rattlesnake and the inscription \\"Tread Not On Me. For My Country.\\" to the paper's masthead. Marshall soon changed the name of the paper to the Harbinger, and eventually sold it to Patrick Darby in 1825. Darby immediately changed the name of the newspaper again, dubbing it the Constitutional Advocate.Quisenberry, p. 114 =Resolution of legal disputes= Harry Innes' libel suit against Joseph Street was not fully adjudicated in the Jessamine County Circuit Court until 1811.Quisenberry, p. 79 The jury found in Innes' favor and awarded $750 in damages, although Innes' counsel, Henry Clay and Robert Wickliffe, insisted that Innes only desired the vindication of a guilty verdict against Street and would not collect the damages. Soon after, Street shuttered the Western World and moved to Illinois. As the libel suit against Marshall dragged on in Mercer County Circuit Court, Innes and his allies hired author William Littell to publish Innes' version of his interactions with Spain. Marshall countered by publishing his History of Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most popular history of Kentucky at the time. When Street returned to Kentucky to give a deposition in the case in 1814, Innes swore out a writ against him to collect the damages awarded in his case against Street. Unable to pay, Street was imprisoned. Innes' case against Marshall ended in a hung jury in 1814.Quisenberry, p. 80 Rather than retry the case, Marshall and Innes signed an agreement to end the legal battle in 1815. The agreement stipulated that neither man would write or publish anything that was disrespectful of the other. Innes upheld his part of the agreement, but in 1824, eight years after Innes' death, Marshall published an updated two-volume version of his History of Kentucky that was even more critical of Innes and others he suspected of participating in the Spanish Conspiracy. =Death= Marshall retired from public life altogether after selling the Harbinger in 1825.Quisenberry, p. 134 His wife had died the previous year, and soon after selling his newspaper, he became paralyzed by a palsy on one side. Thus disabled, he soon moved to Lexington to live with his son, Thomas, then a professor at Transylvania University.Quisenberry, p. 136 He died at his son's home on July 3, 1841. A slaveholder for his entire life, Marshall's will dictated that all of his slaves be emancipated upon his death.Quisenberry, p. 135 He was buried at Glen Willis, his estate in Leestown, Kentucky. No marker was erected above his grave.Quisenberry, p. 137 In 1888, the General Assembly allocated $300 to rebury Marshall's remains in Frankfort Cemetery and place a marker above the grave, but his family members asked that his remains be undisturbed.

Initially designed and built by Mitsubishi, it has been further developed and updated by the Beech Aircraft Company, now part of Textron Aviation. It was produced over 30 years under the names such as Mitsubishi Diamond/Diamond II, Beechjet 400/400A, and Hawker 400XP; military version T-1 Jayhawk was also produced. In total, over 900 Hawkers 400 have been delivered. Since 2017, a factory-engineered and supported upgrade to Hawker 400XPR is provided, reducing fuel consumption by 16-20%, and improving range by as much as 33%. Design Planform view, showing wing sweep It is a small, low-winged twin- turbofan aircraft of all metal construction, flown by a crew of two pilots and accommodating eight passengers in a pressurised cabin. Its wings use a computer designed, supercritical airfoil in order to minimise drag. Its two Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D turbofans are mounted on the rear fuselage. Powered by JT15D-5/-5R, it can fly with four passengers, cruising at Mach 0.71‚Äì0.73, and most pilots are comfortable flying it over three hours, about cruising at Mach 0.73‚Äì0.76, typical missions are 1.5 to 2.0 hours with block speeds. It burns of fuel the first hour, dropping to for the second. Basic operating weights range from , full tanks payload is less than but the average passengers are three, it can fly six passengers Development The aircraft was originally designed as the Mitsubishi MU-300 Diamond, an all-new, all-jet development to complement and slot above the Mitsubishi MU-2 and provide Mitsubishi Heavy Industries with their top-of-the-line corporate aircraft model (hence the name \\"Diamond\\"). It first flew on August 29, 1978. Mitsubishi went on to produce 97 MU-300s, all of which were assembled by the company's United States subsidiary.Aviastar: Mitsubishi MU-300 / Diamond In 1985, Mitsubishi sold the rights and a number of unfinished airframes to Beechcraft, who began manufacturing it as their own model, initially re-designated as the Beechjet 400, certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration in May 1986. Raytheon/Beechcraft developed improvements for the 1990 400A for longer range, higher take-off weights, luxury appointments and offering an all-glass flight deck. Beechcraft developed the T-1 Jayhawk version for the United States Air Force, used as a trainer for crew of large aircraft like tankers and strategic transports: 180 were delivered between 1992 and 1997. The Japan Air Self- Defense Force 400T trainer shares the T1-A Type certificate. In 1993, Raytheon purchased the Hawker business jets from British Aerospace and renamed the Beechjet 400 as the Hawker 400 to include it in the line. In 2003, Raytheon began to produce Hawker 400XP, which included: gross weight increase, a nine passenger seating option, thrust reversers, TCAS II, and an emergency locator beacon. In 2008, Hawker Beechcraft announced an improved Hawker 450XP including new, more fuel efficient Pratt & Whitney PW535Ds with 2,965 pounds of thrust each, but it was canceled in June 2009 due to poor economic conditions. Nextant Aerospace re-manufactured Hawker 400XP as the Nextant 400XT, replacing the JT15Ds with Williams FJ44-3APs and adding new avionics and interior. It was FAA-certified in October 2011. Up to one-third of the 400A/400XP fleet could be retrofitted, enabling improved range, speed and fuel efficiency. It should keep their resale value to remain in economic service for another twenty to thirty years, like Falcon 20s reengined with TFE731s. In 2012, Textron has first flown Hawker 400XPR, which improves 4-pax range to , has better hot and high performance, and can climb to FL450 at max takeoff weight in 19 min. The conversion features new avionics, interior, winglets, and Williams FJ44-4A-32 engines. Hawker 400XPR was certified in 2016, and first fully configured Hawker 400XPR was delivered in July 2017; the upgrade can be performed in 12 weeks with a choice of Rockwell Collins Pro Line 4 to 21 or Garmin G5000 avionics.

The group was founded in 2001 by Kevin Doria (electric bass guitar), Joe Denardo (electric guitar), and Zack Carlson (drums). Carlson left following their first album, and the band continued as a duo until 2009, when they recruited Sadie Laska (samplers, microphone) to form a new trio. The group's music has gradually progressed from slow, instrumental drone pieces through works in noise and ambient music toward more propulsive, rhythm driven music. Their live shows are consistently known for being very loud and for playing straight through their set without breaks or banter between songs.http://www.nypress.com/article-20644-gym-class- heroes.html Notable and Recent Releases and Tours  Growing have released albums on labels such as Kranky, Animal Disguise, Archive, Megablade/Troubleman, and The Social Registry. At the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008 Growing released their first two releases for The Social Registry; a 7-inch single for the label Social Club series and a mini-lp entitled Lateral. In 2010 they released an album on Vice Records. In April 2008 Growing embarked on a tour of Europe and the United Kingdom with the Japanese band Boris. In December 2010 Growing performed at the All Tomorrow's Parties curated by Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Equipment, Technique, Composition, and Aesthetic Evolution Joe is left-handed and Kevin is right- handed. In recent concerts, both Doria and Denardo have used pairs of amplifiers for true stereo guitar setups. In early shows, Kevin generally played bass with his back to the audience, and then Joe played seated, much like members of kindred spirits Spacemen 3. In recent (2008) concerts, all members play standing, using effects units on the floor and on tables (which they control with their hands). Growing's music has been consistently grounded in repetitive, droning guitar sounds, which may be heavily processed (sometimes beyond identifiable guitar timbre). They regularly employ delay/looper pedals, feedback, the Ebow, and or phrase-samplers to create indefinitely sustained sounds, which are blended in and out of the music volume pedals or mixers. In addition to pedals, both Doria and Denardo started using a variety of instruments and effects not traditionally designed or marketed for guitar players. These include touch-pad effectors, rhythm machines, and phrase samplers whose hands-on control (and drastic processing) is usually marketed for DJs, which members of Growing praise for their simplicity and immediacy of control. While most loop-driven guitar performances involve building many layers into a harmonically complex musical motive with unified, locked rhythm (and the option to solo over the loop), Growing's approach is quite different. Their sound involves capturing simple, contrasting drones or motifs moving in separate looping streams (sometimes deliberately out of sync for diffuse, textural effect), which can then be introduced and removed independently for greater textural subtlety and rhythmic diffusion. Where most guitarists may rout their guitar through a single series of effects, Growing's setups may involve routing their particular instrument through multiple divergent chains effect chains and looper-pedals into parallel amps and/or mixer channels; This allows separate sounds to be captured and mixed in/out of play independently. Hence their approach may lend as much to early DJ technique as it does to traditional electric guitar performance.https://www.vice.com/practice-space/growing Denardo has referred describes this process as \\"... basically, our whole band is volume pedals.\\" With such technique, they can then compose and execute seamless or dramatic transitions not usually achieved by only two guitars. When pressed about their sense of composition and improvisation, Joe has stated that many of the transitions during performances are planned, which Kevin (in a different interview) has explained that Growing's writing process is passive and that \\"...it's all jams.\\" Across the span of over 6 records, Growing's music has evolved from long (10+ minute) pieces of placid, contemplative droning music (without repeating themes) toward short(er) (3-7 minute) songs of more rhythmic, propulsive, and linear progression. Of notable persistence is the band's consistent lack of recapitulated themes; once there is sonic/textural change, their music seldom revisits a motif. As such, their more \\"ambient\\" musics had a \\"scenic\\" listening quality, while the more propulsive later material plays more akin to (but still far removed from) \\"club mix\\" music. Interviews with the band suggest both Doria and Denardo's musical evolution is not from deliberate ambition, but from curiosity, experimentation, and a continually rotating arsenal of electronic musical equipment. Side-projects, other musical contributions Total Life is Doria's side-project. In 2005, he released his first album on Animal Disguise, which was limited to 150 copies and is now sold out. The cassette was reissued on vinyl in early 2007 in a series of 500. In March 2008, Total Life released a second album \\"Ken Bradshaw\\" on BrownSounds records. This release featured more propulsive, energetic rhythms against the \\"wall of sound\\" guitar playing.

It was located 35 miles SSW of Kaiserslautern and 2 miles mi SE of Zweibr√ºcken. It was assigned to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) during its operational lifetime. The military facility was closed in 1991 after the Cold War ended, the site now serving as the civilian Zweibr√ºcken Airport.

The crumpled remains of many of the bunkers of the old line are still in evidence. It was designed by French engineers and completed by German contractors in late 1952. Construction was funded from USAF sources; however, the RCAF assumed control of the Zweibr√ºcken base on January 6, 1953.  RCAF Station Zweibr√ºcken  RCAF Station Zweibr√ºcken, also known as 3 Wing or 3 (F) Wing was one of four RCAF wings, consisting of three fighter squadrons each, established in Europe at the beginning of the Cold War. These four wings were part of the RCAF's No. 1 Air Division, which was formed as part of Canada's air defence commitment to NATO during the Cold War. Other bases were located in Marville, France; Grostenquin, France; and Baden-Soellingen, West Germany. scramble as Sabres fly overhead. Three squadrons flying F-86 Sabres were located at Zweibr√ºcken: 413, 427, and 434. The three squadrons arrived at Zweibr√ºcken in March 1953.Roberts 1959, p. 245. No. 413 Squadron was replaced in 1957 by 440 Squadron flying the new CF-100 all-weather interceptor. In 1959 Canada adopted a new and controversial nuclear strike role in accordance with NATO's doctrine of \\"limited nuclear warfare\\" and began re-equipping with the new CF-104 Starfighter that could handle the delivery of nuclear weapons. This aircraft also had a reconnaissance role. In the fall of 1962 the Sabre squadrons of the Air Division, including those at 3 Wing, began flying Starfighters. No. 440 Squadron was disbanded in December 1962. No. 430 Squadron moved to Zweibr√ºcken from Grostenquin when 2 Wing closed down in 1964. The RCAF left Zweibr√ºcken August 27, 1969 as an austerity measure following unification of the Canadian Armed Forces. Its units consolidated at CFB Lahr and CFB Baden-Soellingen. Before leaving, they erected a west coast Indian totem pole as a token of their friendship with the local German citizens. At the top of the pole was the Thunderbird, the god who watches over all creation. Below it was a double headed sea monster, the warrior's symbol; the third figure was of a little man who had grown from boyhood to become a warrior, and the fourth figure was that of the same warrior, grown to maturity as a tribal chief. Upon the departure of the RCAF, control of the station was transferred to the United States Air Force Sixteenth Air Force, USAFE. Upon taking control of Zweibr√ºcken Air Base, the United States Air Force either renovated or enlarged all base facilities, and procured off-base housing for most base personnel. The base was assigned to USAFE as an off-base installation of Ramstein AB on August 29, 1969, and the facility assumed primary installation status on May 1, 1970. = 86th Tactical Fighter Wing = 86th TFW 17th TRS McDonnell Douglas RF-4C-38-MC Phantom 68-0562, 1970 The 86th Tactical Fighter Wing was reactivated at Zweibr√ºcken on November 1, 1969. It received its first flying unit, the 17th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, on January 12, 1970. The 17th TRS and its McDonnell Douglas RF-4C Phantom IIs came to Zweibr√ºcken from the inactivating 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at RAF Upper Heyford, England. Squadron tail code for the 17th TRS was initially \\"ZS\\", then was recoded to \\"ZR\\" in 1971. For 18 months the 17th was the only operational squadron on the base. On June 12, 1971, the 81st Tactical Fighter Squadron with its Electronics Counter- Measures (ECM) equipped McDonnell EF-4C Phantom II \\"Wild Weasel\\" fighters was transferred to Zweibr√ºcken from the 50th TFW at Hahn AB when the 50th switched to a strike-attack role, with air defense as a secondary mission. (Note: The EF-4C designation was not official. The aircraft were officially F-4C models). The 81st TFS, however remained a part of the 50th TFW but was detached from the wing's operational control and attached to the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing for support. Squadron tail code for the 81st TFS was \\"ZS\\". In 1972, tail codes for all 86th TFW aircraft at Zweibr√ºcken were standardized as \\"ZR\\", per AFM 66-1, when squadron tail codes were eliminated. On January 15, 1973, the 81st TFS was reassigned to Spangdahlem Air Base under operation \\"Battle Creek\\". The last of this variant of the Phantom returned to the USA in 1979/1980 and was replaced by the F-4G Wild Weasel at Spangdahlem. On the northern side of Zweibr√ºcken was Kreuzberg Kaserne, home to the U.S. Army Materiel Command, Europe (MATCOM). Matcom was replaced by the USA Material Management Agency, Europe in 1973. = 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing = 38th TRS McDonnell Douglas RF-4C-37-MC Phantom 68-0553 in late 1980s Air Superiority Gray motif. As part of operation \\"Creek Action\\", a command-wide effort to realign functions and streamline operations, HQ USAFE transferred the 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing from Ramstein Air Base to Zweibr√ºcken, and the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing from Zweibr√ºcken to Ramstein on January 31, 1973. Operational squadrons of the 26th TRW were: *7th Special Operations Squadron (C-130 Hercules, UH-1) * 17th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (RF-4C) (Red tail fin stripe) * 38th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (RF-4C) (Yellow tail fin stripe) Note: 7th SOS reported directly to HQ USAFE. 17th & 38th RF-4Cs carried tail code \\"ZR\\". For nearly five years the wing remained stable at Zweibr√ºcken. Then on October 1, 1978, the 417th Tactical Fighter Squadron was activated with a single F-4D aircraft and assigned to the 26 TRW. USAFE planned on equipping the squadron with F-4Es, however, inadequate munitions storage compelled the command to reverse its decision and consequently reassigned the 417th TFS without personnel or equipment to the 86th TFW at Ramstein AB on November 1, 1978, being placed in not operational status. Later that month, on November 20, the 17 TRS was inactivated due to budgetary cutbacks leaving the 38 TRS as the wing's only in-place operational squadron. High-hour RF-4C aircraft were sent to AMARC, others were reassigned to the 38th TRS or to existing Bergstrom, Shaw, RAF Alconbury or Air National Guard squadrons. The mission of the 38 TRS was to collect tactical aerial imagery using an array of sensors mounted aboard the RF-4C aircraft and to then report the findings from the imagery to commanders in the field during exercises that simulated real world operations. A variety of cameras and other sensors were exploited by Air Photo Interpreters (later Imagery Interpreters and Imagery Analysts), including low and high panoramic, nose vertical and Infra red cameras. The RF-4C was also utilized as the test bed for the then cutting edge prototype radar system known as Side-Looking Airborne Radar, or SLAR. During exercises, the planes would be tasked to collect imagery and return to base where the film would be quickly downloaded from the aircraft, processed, then interpreted, with the results sent up the chain of command, under strict time lines. Included in this process were photo processors, computer maintenance personnel, facility maintenance personnel and coordinating personnel. In the beginning, intelligence reports were hand written and sent to the communications center for dissemination to the higher headquarters; the process evolved when report writers manned a variety of computer based work stations to disseminate the reports themselves. Systems developed by both Texas Instruments and Goodyear Aerospace were used as prototypes to hone the process. Deployments from the United States included EB-57E aircraft from 17 DSES,based at Malmstrom AFB,Montana in April/May 1976 and September 1977.RF-4C Phantom aircraft from 67 TRW (Tactical Reconnaissance Wing) in July 1981 and RF-4C from 123 Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron,Kentucky Air National Guard arriving on Saturday June 28, 1986 for a two-week deployment. In 1976/1977 a US Army unit, the 2d Military Intelligence Battalion (Aerial Reconnaissance and Surveillance) (MIBARS) flew the U-21A Ute twin turbo-prop airplane (around 6 airplanes) for a short period. The Combat Intelligence Company (Imagery Interpretation)(CBTI Co(II)) was the parent unit of the U-21's. The CBTI Co(II) was a component of the 2d MI Bn. From April 5 to July 7, 1979 the base also hosted the 86th TFW while Ramstein AB's runways were closed for extensive repairs. On August 10, 1987, the 26 TRW became the only tactical reconnaissance wing in USAFE, when the 10 TRW at RAF Alconbury was redesignated the 10th Tactical Fighter Wing and assigned to fly A-10 attack aircraft. This left NATO and US Forces in Europe the services of just one US tactical reconnaissance unit and one squadron of RF-4Cs. The wing continued to conduct reconnaissance operations in support of NATO, USAFE, and the US Army in Europe (USAREUR). The wing also engaged in operational employment and development of advanced reconnaissance systems to further enhance the military posture of NATO in Europe. =Military Airlift Command activities= On November 9, 1983, the Military Airlift Command (MAC) activated the 10th Military Airlift Squadron (MAS). The 10 MAS flew the C-23 \\"Sherpa\\", a small cargo plane that needed only a little bit of runway and less fuel than larger cargo aircraft. A total of 18 C-23A Sherpa aircraft were delivered to the 10 MAS. The 10 MAS though under the direction of the 322nd Air Division (MAC) at Rhein-Main AB, became an associated unit of the 26th drawing support from it. The 26 TRW provided the 10 MAS all of its facilities and logistical support required to operate the European Distribution System (EDS). The EDS was organized to give the units in Europe a quicker way to receive small equipment items or supplies on a round-the-clock basis, without the expense of the larger cargo aircraft. = 609th Contingency Hospital = In 1985, another role was added to the wing's mission. On October 15, 1984, the 609th Contingency Hospital was activated by HQ USAFE. The mission of the 609th was to provide a turnkey hospital operation, where the equipment, and supplies were already in place and all the organization needed was the people to operate it, when called upon. This hospital, an old \\"krankenhaus\\" was activated in January 1991 in support of Operation Desert Storm and was used at least through March 1991. Some victims of the Scud missile attack in Saudi Arabia received interval medical care at the 609th en route back to the U.S. Note that the Hospital was in the nearby city of Zweibr√ºcken, and not on the Air Base. =601st Tactical Control Squadron= In the fall of 1988, HQ USAFE began planning to move two more units to Zweibr√ºcken and increase the support mission of the 26th TRW. HQ USAFE planned to move the 601st Tactical Control Squadron (TCS) and the 612th Tactical Control Flight (TCF) from Pr√ºm Air Station, Germany to Zweibr√ºcken . The mission of the 601st and the 612th was to provide a line of radar detection systems wherever USAFE or NATO needed them. The two units arrived in June 1989, increasing the number of associate units on the base and diversifying the mission even more. Military housing Dormitories for single or unaccompanied service members were provided on base. Those service members who had families could get into family housing (there was a very long waiting list for the limited number of apartments), and had a choice between two areas, Canadian housing and French housing. Both areas were located in the city of Zweibr√ºcken, the Canadian being closer to the air base (between the base and the \\"krankenhaus\\") and the French being closer to the US Army's Kreuzberg Kaserne. Many service members chose to live on the German Economy their entire tour, because of both the limited number of apartments and the limited floor space in Canadian and French Housing. The last RF-4Cs leave Zweibr√ºcken on 12 April 1991. USAFE closure With the end of the Cold War, the USAF presence at Zweibr√ºcken was gradually phased out. In addition, the 1960s-era RF-4C Phantoms were costing more and more to maintain. Tactical reconnaissance was being handled more and more by other means, and the need for the 26th TRW was becoming less and less critical to USAFE planners. As a result, the RF-4Cs of the 38th TRS were sent to 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group 1 April 1991 and the squadron was inactivated. The 26th TRW was inactivated on 31 July 1991, and Zweibr√ºcken Air Base was closed. The facility was turned over to the German government civil authorities. Current uses Today, Zweibr√ºcken Airport , or Flughafen Zweibr√ºcken is used as a regional airport. Along with the civil airport, a private industrial park has been developed for commercial businesses. Most of the buildings such as the TabVees are still standing and are being used for purposes ranging from storage to industry. In the front of the air base, where the fuel depot was formerly located, now stand groups of factory outlet stores. At the time the base closed in 1991, the only visible reminders of 3 Wing RCAF was the totem, the stained glass windows of the Protestant Chapel, and the Peter Cunningham Memorial Arena. As of 2007 the stained glass in the Protestant chapel has been removed and the totem relocated to the \\"Rose Garden\\" in the city of Zweibr√ºcken. Only the Peter Cunningham Memorial Arena remains.

There he became an engraver and worked for three years with his burin. He then received a scholarship from Prince Metternich enabling him to study at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts. He remained there until 1843, receiving awards for an embossed profile in wax of the emperor Joseph II and for a steel-engraving of Metastasio. In 1844 Guttmann produced a bronze statuette of Baron Salomon von Rothschild from a portrait, and was commissioned by him to execute a replica in marble. The Baron also paid Guttmann an annuity, thus enabling him to go to Rome. There he modeled a bust of Pope Pius IX and completed his masterpiece, Der Blumenspender. While in Rome, Guttmann was deeply interested in the ghetto, which he described in letters to his father. Later he went to Paris, and in 1857 he became insane. He died in Vienna.

It was first published in Liberty magazine on November 10, 1934.Wharton, Edith. ‚ÄúRoman Fever.‚Äù Liberty 11.45 (10 Nov. 1934): 10-14. Print. A revised and expanded version of the story was published in Wharton's 1936 short story collection The World Over.Wharton, Edith. ‚ÄúRoman Fever.‚Äù The World Over. New York: D. Appleton-Century Company, 1936. 213-239. Plot summary Grace Ansley and Alida Slade are middle-aged American women visiting Rome with their daughters, Barbara Ansley and Jenny Slade. The women live in Manhattan, New York, and have been friends since girlhood. A youthful and romantic rivalry led Mrs. Slade to nurture feelings of jealousy and hatred against Mrs. Ansley. For her part, Mrs. Ansley looks down on Mrs. Slade, who she feels has led \\"a sad life.\\" In the opening pages of the story, the two women compare their daughters and reflect on each other's lives. Eventually, Alida reveals a secret about a letter written to Grace on a visit to Rome many years ago. The letter was purportedly from Alida's fianc√©, Delphin, inviting Grace to a rendezvous at the Colosseum. In fact, Alida forged the letter in an attempt to send Grace on a fruitless outing and expose her \\"delicate throat\\" to the \\"deathly cold.\\" Mrs. Ansley is upset at this revelation, but explains that she was not left alone at the Colosseum; she responded to the letter, and Delphin arrived to meet her. Mrs. Ansley then says that she feels sorry for Mrs. Slade, repeating her earlier thoughts. Mrs. Slade states that, while she was \\"beaten there,\\" Mrs. Ansley ought not to feel sorry for her, because she \\"had [Delphin] for twenty-five years\\" while Mrs. Ansley had \\"nothing but that one letter that he didn't write.\\" Mrs. Ansley responds, in the last sentence of the story, \\"I had Barbara,\\" implying that Barbara is Delphin's daughter. Setting The story takes place in the afternoon through sunset, in the city of Rome, at a restaurant overlooking the Forum. Two wealthy, middle-aged, widowed women are visiting Rome with their two unmarried daughters. The setting illustrates the power and class from which the women hail, but the Old Rome context, such as the Colosseum, insinuates Roman Empire-style intrigue. The movement from afternoon to sunset indicates the devastation that both women will receive as the story progresses. The story's flashbacks take place in both Rome and New York City. Analysis Knitting is one several figurative motifs in \\"Roman Fever.\\" It is introduced through Barbara's mocking suggestion that she and Jenny \\"leave the young things,\\" an ironic reference to their mothers, \\"to their knitting.‚Äù Jenny objects that the women are \\"not actually knitting\\" (Wharton's emphasis). To which Barbara replies, \\"Well, I mean figuratively. Wharton, Edith. ‚ÄúRoman Fever.‚Äù The World Over. New York: D. Appleton-Century Company, 1936. 213-239 Critic Kathleen Wheeler argues that the search for truth is one of the story's primary themes. And while many readers are initially attracted to the story's surprise ending, Wheeler suggests that the story has levels of complexity that are often overlooked on first reading. \\"[T]he truth, like the past,\\" Wheeler writes, \\"is shrouded in mystery.\\" Rather than focusing on the answers provided by Grace's and Alida's revelations in the story's concluding pages, Wheeler foregrounds the way in which \\"Wharton forces upon the reader numerous unanswerable questions.\\"Wheeler, Kathleen. ‚ÄúThe Attack on Realism: Edith Wharton‚Äôs In Morocco and ‚ÄòRoman Fever.‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúModernist‚Äù Women Writers and Narrative Art. New York: New York UP, 1994. 77-98 Characters Alida Slade: Middle-aged widow of Delphin Slade. Because so much of her identity is wrapped up in her relationship to her husband, \\"it was a big drop from being the wife of Delphin Slade to being his widow.\\" Delphin Slade: \\"[A] famous corporation lawyer,\\" and the late husband of Alida. Delphin's \\"big coup in Wall Street\\" allowed him to move his family from East 73rd Street to the more fashionable \\"upper Park Avenue.\\" Grace Ansley: Middle-aged widow of well-to-do Horace Ansley. She is \\"smaller and paler\\" than Mrs. Slade and \\"evidently far less sure than her companion of herself and of her rights in the world.\\" Horace Ansley: Late husband of Grace. He and his wife are variously described as \\"Museum specimens of old New York. Good-looking, irreproachable, exemplary.\\" Barbara Ansley: Daughter of Grace Ansley. In the opening paragraphs of the story, we hear her \\"mocking voice in the stairway\\" as she and Jenny Slade depart. While the girls' parents contend that they're both \\"angels,\\" Mrs. Slade suggests that Grace's daughter has \\"rainbow wings.\\" Jenny Slade: Daughter of Alida Slade. Younger than Barbara, she is \\"that rare accident, an extremely pretty girl who somehow made youth and prettiness seem as safe as their absence.\\" Mrs. Slade wishes \\"that Jenny would fall in love--with the wrong man, even; that she might have to be watched, out-manoeuvred, rescued. And instead, it was Jenny who watched her mother, kept her out of draughts, made sure that she had taken her tonic. . . .\\" Headwaiter: Supervising waiter at the terrace restaurant overlooking the Roman Forum, the Colosseum, and other ancient ruins. After receiving a gratuity from Alida Slade, he invites Alida and Grace to remain at the restaurant to enjoy the view. Notably, the headwaiter has no dialogue in the story--his ideas are communicated secondhand by way of the narrator. Son of Alida Slade: Child who \\"inherited his father's gifts,\\" but \\"died suddenly in boyhood.\\" Harriet: Deceased great-aunt of Grace. According to a story handed down, Harriet and her sister loved the same man. To get rid of her sister, Harriet supposedly tricked her into exposing herself to Roman fever. She later died of the disease. Themes Power struggle for those in the upper classes: Engaged to Delphin Slade, Alida suspects that Grace might try to steal him from her. Alida tries to remove Grace from the picture by forging Delphin's signature on a letter inviting the latter to a nighttime rendezvous at the Colosseum. The plan backfires for Alida because her eventual husband actually meets with Grace. Alida still marries her beau, but it seems the soon-to-be Mrs. Ansley actually bears Mr. Slade's daughter, Barbara. Betrayal and deception: As a young woman, Mrs. Slade used subterfuge and machination in order to improve her marriage prospects. Grudges: In their middle age, Mrs. Slade and Mrs. Ansley introduce decades-old surprises. Representation of female relationships Grace feels sorry for Alida, while Alida envies Grace. The women \\"visualize each other, each through the wrong end of her little telescope.\\" Only through the sharing of their two perspectives do they begin to see a fuller picture of their past.

As the Sixties ended, several early rock and rollers like Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Bill Haley & His Comets and Bo Diddley, who had been out of fashion since the British Invasion, experienced a resurgence in popularity, performing their old hits to a mix of old and new fans. Rock and roll revival festivals became popular, and anticipated the \\"oldies show\\" package tours of later years.

Bar bets can range from wagers about little-known trivia, such as obscure historical facts, to feats of skill and strength. Some bar bets are intended to trick the other party into losing.  Famous bar bets  * The annual Midnight Sun baseball game played in Fairbanks, Alaska (the only game to be contested after midnight without the use of artificial lighting) was established in 1906 as the result of a bar bet. * Two of Tony Hawks' books, Round Ireland With A Fridge () and Playing The Moldovans At Tennis (), were written describing Hawks' attempts to win two bar bets. * The film To Have and Have Not is supposedly the result of bar bet between Ernest Hemingway and Howard Hawks, with Hemingway betting Hawks that Hawks couldn't make a good film from Hemingway's worst novel. * A common rumor claims that the creation of Scientology was the result of a bar bet between L. Ron Hubbard and Robert A. Heinlein. Richard Leiby, a reporter for The Washington Post covering the group, never found any evidence to substantiate it. * A class of Feynman Diagram became known as a Penguin diagram due to a bar bet between physicists John Ellis and Melissa Franklin. Enforceability Under contract law, bar bets may or may not be legally binding, and the winning party may have difficulty having a court enforce the bet. A written contract, drawn up soberly the next day and signed by both parties, can avoid doubt. For example, if one or both parties are intoxicated when the bet is made, they may be found to lack capacity to agree to a contract, and the contract thus found void or voidable. However, the fact that the agreement is oral but not written does not undermine it: oral contracts are valid, though certain contracts must be written, under the statute of frauds, such as for the transfer of land. Trick bets In the UK in particular, bar bets are tricks which the \\"mark\\" cannot win. They usually depend upon a condition set in the bet that the mark doesn't notice. Some famous examples: * The mark is told that a coin of a particular denomination has been made so it cannot be laid on its edge. The trickster offers him a sum of money for any the mark can lay on edge. When the mark succeeds, the trickster grabs the coin and rewards him with the promised sum - which is always less than the value of the grabbed coin. * The trickster bets a mark who has just bought a drink that he can swallow the drink without touching the glass or using a straw. When the bet is taken, the trickster grabs the drink and swallows it - and hands over the wagered sum, again much less than the value of the drink. * A darts player is bet by the trickster that he will lose a game, even though offered many advantages, one of which is always that the mark's scores will be doubled. Only when close to finishing does the mark realise that because he started from an odd number (say, 201) he cannot finish on a double (as is traditional in darts) because he always has an odd score as a target. The trickster can continue to play from, say, 1001, but is bound to win eventually. * A mark is informed that it is possible to push a wine glass through the handle of a pint jar without breaking either. When he accepts the bet, the trickster places the wine glass next to the handle and pokes it with a finger that passes through the handle. * A mark is told that if he stands in the middle of the floor, by the time the trickster has walked around him three times, the mark will have walked away from the encounter. Various conditions ensuring no violence will be used are given, but when the bet is taken the trickster simply sits down, leaving the mark stranded in the middle of the bar. * Some bar bets are physical impossibilities rather than word-based tricks, such as that supposedly invented by music hall star Tommy Trinder. Sometimes collectors of bar bets will battle each other to see which one knows the most tricks. It is a given that each must accept the bet proposed by the other.

Acalculia is distinguished from dyscalculia in that acalculia is acquired late in life due to neurological injury such as stroke, while dyscalculia is a specific developmental disorder first observed during the acquisition of mathematical knowledge. The name comes from the Greek \\"a\\" meaning \\"not\\" and Latin \\"calculare\\", which means \\"to count\\". Signs and symptoms Calculation impairments include the inability to perform simple mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. As calculation involves the integration of several cognitive skills, it is understood that an individual with acalculia (or calculation difficulties) is deficient in any of the following four realms: 1) understanding that every number represents a value and immediately registering this value, 2) recognizing a number's value with respect to other numbers, 3) knowing a number's location in series of numbers, and 4) association of a numerical symbol with its name, spoken verbally. Young schoolchildren are presented with mathematical concepts in a cumulative manner. Advancement requires the grasping of fundamental concepts before progressing to more difficult and involved concepts. There is a natural variation in the speed with which young schoolchildren grasp mathematical concepts, and those that have extreme difficulty retaining the foundations of mathematical concepts (such as global quantification or numerosity perception) are considered to have developmental dyscalculia. =Variations= Acalculia is associated with lesions of the parietal lobe (especially the angular gyrus) and the frontal lobe and can be an early sign of dementia. Acalculia is sometimes observed as a \\"pure\\" deficit, but is commonly observed as one of a constellation of symptoms, including agraphia, finger agnosia and right-left confusion, after damage to the left angular gyrus, known as Gerstmann's syndrome.Gerstmann, J. (1940). Syndrome of finger agnosia, disorientation for right and left, agraphia, acalculia. Archives of Neurology and Psychology 44, 398‚Äì408Mayer, E. et al. (1999). A pure case of Gerstmann syndrome with a subangular lesion. Brain 122, 1107‚Äì1120 Studies of patients with lesions to the parietal lobe have demonstrated that lesions to the angular gyrus tend to lead to greater impairments in memorized mathematical facts, such as multiplication tables, with relatively unimpaired subtraction abilities. Conversely, patients with lesions in the region of the intraparietal sulcus tend to have greater deficits in subtraction, with preserved multiplication abilities.Dehaene, S., & Cohen, L. (1997). Cerebral pathways for calculation: Double dissociation between rote verbal and quantitative knowledge of arithmetic. Cortex, 33(2), 219-250 These double dissociations lend support to the idea that different regions of the parietal cortex are involved in different aspects of numerical processing. Cause Damage to the left angular gyrus is known to cause computational difficulties like those associated with primary acalculia and anarithmetia. However, damage to various but not necessarily identified areas of the brain can cause computational difficulties, as various cognitive functions are necessary to execute mathematical calculations. Diagnosis Because acalculia is a symptom of the more commonly known Gerstmann's syndrome, it may be difficult to solely diagnose acalculia. Instead, it may be labeled as one of its symptoms, and lead to the eventual diagnosis of Gerstmann's syndrome. \\"Provided that general mental impairment and significant aphasic disorder can be excluded as primary factors, the presentation of deficits such as agraphia, acalculia, and right- left confusion should alert the clinician to the possibility of focal posterior parietal lobe disease.\\"Disorders, National Organization for Rare. Nord Guide to Rare Disorders. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2003. Print. (Disorders) Structural and functional neuroimaging may be of further value in determining the existence of underlying neurologic abnormalities. =Screening= Common screening procedures for acalculia include asking the patient to answer questions about order, conducting memory tests to rule out the possibility of a mental disorder, confrontation naming (naming parts of objects), reading tests, writing tests, calculation tests, finger naming, clock drawing, and left/right orientation testing. The writing tests, spelling tests, finger naming, and left/right orientation are all tests to confirm the presence of Gerstmann's syndrome. Acalculia is one out of four defining components of Gerstmann's syndrome; the other three components are agraphia, finger agnosia, and right/left confusion.NORD Guide to Rare Disorders. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2003. Print. Typically, acalculia is present because of Gerstmann's syndrome or it is linked with other disorders. It is imperative to note that there is \\"difficulty separating calculation disorders from disruptions in other domains\\". This is why testing functions besides calculation abilities is crucial for the screening of acalculia- so that other disorders can be ruled out. More extensive testing includes \\"brain mapping techniques such as position emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and event related potentials (ERP), which have helped to illuminate some of the functional anatomical relationships for number processing\\".D'Esposito, Mark. Neurological Foundations of Cognitive Neuroscience. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT, 2003. Print. A basic examination of numerical abilities in brain-damaged patients should include both verbal and non-verbal aspects of number processing. The following tests are suggested: * Forward and backward digit span. * Forward and backward counting. * Symbolic transcoding (reading aloud and taking dictation of simple and multidigit numerals). * Single-digit arithmetic. To reduce the contribution of input and output deficits to the patient's performance, problems may be simultaneously presented in written form and read aloud by the examiner. Familiar multiplication problems and simple subtractions should be tested in priority, as they reflect rote verbal and quantity-based processes, respectively. * Multidigit written calculations. * Concrete arithmetic problems requiring some planning. * Evaluation of the numerosity of sets of dots, presented either briefly to test estimation abilities, or for an unlimited duration to allow for serial counting.Cohen, Laurent, Anna J. Wilson, V√©ronique Izard, and Stanislas Dehaene. \\"Acalculia.\\"Unicog.org. Web. 24 Apr. 2012. Treatment Gerstmann syndrome and similar symptom combinations are outcomes, not diseases. Treatment, therefore, is dedicated to the underlying neurological abnormality. Cognitive rehabilitation may be useful for the symptoms that interfere with activities of daily life, such as agraphia and acalculia. There are several ways in which rehabilitation of acalculia is carried out. Tsvetkova proposes using the \\"number reconstruction\\" method. It is started by incorporating certain \\"visual elements (e.g., completing eight, starting from the number 3), looking for certain elements within a number (e.g., looking for the number 1 in the number 4), and finally, performing a verbal analysis of the similarities and differences that can be observed between numbers\\".Tsvetkova, L. S. (1996). Acalculia: Aproximacion neuropsicologica al analisis de la alteracion y la rehabilitacion del calculo. In: Ostrosky, F., Ardila, A., and Dochy, R. (eds.), Rehabilitacion neuropsicologica, Planeta, Mexico, pp. 114‚Äì131. At the same time that these number reconstruction technique is used, spatial orientation exercises, comprehension of the right-to-left relationship, and visual analysis of geometrical objects and forms should be developed. In a more basic form, the method used was rote practice: the retrieval of simple arithmetical facts through drillGirelli L, Delazer M, Semenza C, Denes G. The representation of arithmetical facts: evidence from two rehabilitation studies. Cortex 1996; 32: 49-66. or through conceptual training,Domahs F, Bartha, L., Delazer, M.

Influence of improved test encoding on arithmetical word problem solving after frontal lobe damage. Neuropsychological rehabilitation 1992a; 2: 3-20. Sohlberg and Mateer have said that \\"treatment should then include exercises that permit spatial analysis and visual motor ability training.\\" Rehabilitation tasks are implemented following a program that progressively increases difficulty, beginning with simple movements designed for reaching for or indicating objects following by copying figures in two dimensions, and concluding with the construction of three-dimensional figures.Sohlberg, M. M., and Mateer, C. A. (1989). Introduction to Cognitive Rehabilitation: Theory and Practice, Guilford Press, New York. In a case study, Rosselli and Ardila describe the rehabilitation of a 58-year-old woman with spatial alexia, agraphia, and acalculia associated to a vascular injury in the right hemisphere.\\"The rehabilitation was based on the rehabilitation of unilateral spatial neglect and associated spatial difficulties.\\" (Rosselli and Ardila 1996). The patient could adequately perform oral calculations but was completely incapable of performing written arithmetical operations with numbers composed of two or more digits. In a special test of written arithmetical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and initial score of 0/20 was obtained. She was observed to have mixed up the arithmetical procedures and inadequately oriented the columns in mathematical problems. The rehabilitation techniques implemented included the following: #\\"Using short paragraphs with a red vertical line placed on the left margin and with the lines numbered on the left and right sides, the patient, using her index finger, had to look for the numbers corresponding to each line. The clues (vertical line and numbers) were progressively eliminated. #In a text with no more than 12 lines, the patient had to complete the missing letters (i.e., perform sequential and ordered spatial exploration). #Letter cancellation exercises were repeated constantly, and clues to facilitate their execution were included. Time and precision were recorded. #In spontaneous writing exercises using lined paper with a thick colored line in the left margin, the patient had to look for the vertical line when finishing each line. Later, the line was eliminated, but the patient had to verbalize (initially aloud and later to herself) and explore to the extreme left before beginning to read the next line. #To facilitate the relearning of numbers through dictation, squares were used to place the numbers in space, and the concepts of hierarchy were practiced permanently (units, tens, hundreds, etc.). #To provide training in arithmetical operations, she was given in writing additions, subtractions, multiplications, and divisions with digits separated in columns by thick colored lines and the tops of the columns were numbered (from right to left). The patient had to verbalize the arithmetical procedures and, with her right index finger, look for the left margin before she could pass to the next column. Later, the patient herself would write the operations she was dictated. The techniques described previously were proven useful 8 months after the treatment was started. The patient presented significant improvement but in no way a complete recovery.\\" Individuals with acalculia generally live normal lives, unless there are other disabilities or traumatic injuries present that prevent normal living. Details from a case study published in 2003 described the condition of a 55-year-old woman living with acalculia. \\"In addition to writing and calculation deficits, both spelling and reading had declined. Lapses of memory occurred occasionally. Despite these deficits, daily living activities remained intact\\". Another case study published in 1990 described the condition and management of a former female accountant who had \\"suffered a small circumscribed left parietal subdural hematoma in an auto accident.\\" She was able to speak, read, and write normally, but she was unable to perform simple addition past the number ten. The case study reports that the patient also demonstrated \\"severe finger agnosia, and in fact the finger agnosia appeared to be directly related to her inability to perform calculations.\\" The patient was somewhat able to manage her acalculia by visiting a therapist who worked with her specifically on finger recognition tasks, especially on finger calculations. This therapy raised her mathematical ability to a high school level after she received treatment for a number of months.Joseph, Rhawn. Neuropsychology, Neuropsychiatry, and Behavioral Neurology. New York: Plenum, 1990. Print. Epidemiology \\"Gerstmann syndrome and similar posterior parietal symptom combinations (like acalculia) are usually the result of focal cerebrovascular disease in a posterior branch of the left middle cerebral artery or a broader zone infarct, usually involving the angular gyrus or subjacent white matter (Brodmann area 39). In rare cases, traumatic brain injury of an expanding neoplasm in this same region can cause all or elements (acalculia is one of four elements) of the symptoms of this syndrome\\". History The term \\"acalculia\\" was coined by Henschen in 1925; it refers to the decrease in cognitive capacity for calculation that results from damage to the brain. Earlier, in 1908, researchers Lewandowsky and Stadelmann published the first report of an individual afflicted with calculation impairment due to brain damage. The individual had trouble performing calculations on paper and mentally. Further, he had difficulty recognizing arithmetic symbols. The report was key in that it established calculation disorders as separate from language disorders, as the two were formerly associated. Henshcen's research was consistent with Lewandowsky's and Stadelmann's finding. From his research, he was also able to propose that certain areas of the brain played particular roles involved in the understanding and execution of calculation. These areas include the third frontal convolution (pronunciation of numbers), the angular gyrus and the fissure interparietalis (reading of numbers), and the angular gyrus again for the writing of numbers. Shortly after Henshen's advances, Berger in 1926 distinguished between primary and secondary acalculia. Primary acalculia is a \\"pure\\" condition in which an individual can neither comprehend mathematical concepts nor perform mathematical operations. Secondary acalculia is a loss of calculation abilities that stems from other cognitive difficulties, such as memory. It has been questioned whether primary acalculia can exist independently of other cognitive impairments. In 1936, Lindquist proposed that lesions of different areas of the brain can cause different calculation defects, and that there are therefore several variations of acalculia. In 1940, Gerstmann claimed that acalculia is associated with aspects of Gerstmann's syndrome, which include right-left confusion, agraphia, and digital agnosia. In 1983, Boller and Grafman further concluded that calculation difficulties can also arise from various shortcomings, such as the inability to assign value to the name of a number. Little research has been done on acalculia, despite the fact the calculation is considered an essential, upper-level cognitive skill. However, calculation skills are assessed in neuropsychological exams such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). There exist no norms for Acalculia against which a person can be compared to assess his/her level of cognitive impairment with regards to calculation abilities.Ardila, Alfredo, and Monica Rosselli. \\"Acalculia and Dyscalculia.\\" Www.springerlink.com.

The first satellite of Ekran series was launched in 1976. Each satellite in the Ekran series was designed to provide one TV and 2 radio program channels to cable TV systems throughout the USSR and to individual home receivers in northern Siberia. Ekran's downlink is in the UHF range. Early Ekran satellites used orbital positions in the range from 48 degrees E to 95 degrees E, but recent Ekrans, including the current Ekran 20, have been stationed at 99 degrees E. These 3-axis stabilized satellites carry a single 24 MHz, 200 W transponder, feeding a 28 dB gain antenna transmitting on right-hand circular polarization to produce equivalent isotropically radiated powers in Siberia in the range 50 to 55 dBW at 714 MHz. The corresponding feeder link uses left-hand circular polarization at 6200 MHz. Therefore, almost every householder could receive the TV signal at home from Ekran's transponder using a simple Yagi-Uda antenna. There were also various kinds of collective or individual satellite receivers, such as Ekran KR-10 and Ekran-KR-01. Latest version of receiver represents a simple individual TV set-top box itself. A modified version of Ekran was called Ekran-M. Ekran satellites have been replaced by improved geostationary craft for DBS, such as Gorizont, Gals, and Express. On June 23, 1978 the Ekran-2 spacecraft exploded due to a catastrophic discharge of its battery, contributing to the increase in Space Debris on the GEO orbit. On February 1, 2009 the last satellite from the Ekran series, Ekran-M at 99 degrees East, stopped transmitting.

The objective is to take advantage of differences between the implied volatility of the option, and a forecast of future realized volatility of the option's underlying. In volatility arbitrage, volatility rather than price is used as the unit of relative measure, i.e. traders attempt to buy volatility when it is low and sell volatility when it is high.  Overview  To an option trader engaging in volatility arbitrage, an option contract is a way to speculate in the volatility of the underlying rather than a directional bet on the underlying's price. If a trader buys options as part of a delta-neutral portfolio, he is said to be long volatility. If he sells options, he is said to be short volatility. So long as the trading is done delta-neutral, buying an option is a bet that the underlying's future realized volatility will be high, while selling an option is a bet that future realized volatility will be low. Because of the put‚Äìcall parity, it doesn't matter if the options traded are calls or puts. This is true because put-call parity posits a risk neutral equivalence relationship between a call, a put and some amount of the underlying. Therefore, being long a delta-hedged call results in the same returns as being long a delta-hedged put. Volatility arbitrage is not \\"true economic arbitrage\\" (in the sense of a risk-free profit opportunity). It relies on predicting the future direction of implied volatility. Even portfolio based volatility arbitrage approaches which seek to \\"diversify\\" volatility risk can experience \\"black swan\\" events when changes in implied volatility are correlated across multiple securities and even markets. Long Term Capital Management used a volatility arbitrage approach.  Forecast volatility  To engage in volatility arbitrage, a trader must first forecast the underlying's future realized volatility. This is typically done by computing the historical daily returns for the underlying for a given past sample such as 252 days (the typical number of trading days in a year for the US stock market). The trader may also use other factors, such as whether the period was unusually volatile, or if there are going to be unusual events in the near future, to adjust his forecast. For instance, if the current 252-day volatility for the returns on a stock is computed to be 15%, but it is known that an important patent dispute will likely be settled in the next year and will affect the stock, the trader may decide that the appropriate forecast volatility for the stock is 18%.  Market (implied) volatility  As described in option valuation techniques, there are a number of factors that are used to determine the theoretical value of an option. However, in practice, the only two inputs to the model that change during the day are the price of the underlying and the volatility. Therefore, the theoretical price of an option can be expressed as: :C = f(S, \\\\sigma, \\\\cdot) \\\\, where S \\\\, is the price of the underlying, and \\\\sigma \\\\, is the estimate of future volatility. Because the theoretical price function f() \\\\, is a monotonically increasing function of \\\\sigma \\\\,, there must be a corresponding monotonically increasing function g() \\\\, that expresses the volatility implied by the option's market price \\\\bar{C} \\\\,, or :\\\\sigma_\\\\bar{C} = g(S, \\\\bar{C}, \\\\cdot) \\\\, Or, in other words, when all other inputs including the stock price S \\\\, are held constant, there exists no more than one implied volatility \\\\sigma_\\\\bar{C} \\\\, for each market price \\\\bar{C} \\\\, for the option. Because implied volatility of an option can remain constant even as the underlying's value changes, traders use it as a measure of relative value rather than the option's market price. For instance, if a trader can buy an option whose implied volatility \\\\sigma_\\\\bar{C} \\\\, is 10%, it is common to say that the trader can \\"buy the option for 10%\\". Conversely, if the trader can sell an option whose implied volatility is 20%, it is said the trader can \\"sell the option at 20%\\". For example, assume a call option is trading at $1.90 with the underlying's price at $45.50 and is yielding an implied volatility of 17.5%. A short time later, the same option might trade at $2.50 with the underlying's price at $46.36 and be yielding an implied volatility of 16.5%. Even though the option's price is higher at the second measurement, the option is still considered cheaper because the implied volatility is lower. This is because the trader can sell stock needed to hedge the long call at a higher price.  Mechanism  Armed with a forecast of volatility, and capable of measuring an option's market price in terms of implied volatility, the trader is ready to begin a volatility arbitrage trade. A trader looks for options where the implied volatility, \\\\sigma_\\\\bar{C} \\\\, is either significantly lower than or higher than the forecast realized volatility \\\\sigma \\\\,, for the underlying. In the first case, the trader buys the option and hedges with the underlying to make a delta neutral portfolio. In the second case, the trader sells the option and then hedges the position. Over the holding period, the trader will realize a profit on the trade if the underlying's realized volatility is closer to his forecast than it is to the market's forecast (i.e. the implied volatility). The profit is extracted from the trade through the continuous re- hedging required to keep the portfolio delta-neutral.

It began as a subgenre of the late-Victorian adventure romance and remains popular into the 21st century. The genre arose during an era when the fascinating remnants of lost civilizations around the world were being discovered, such as the tombs of Egypt's Valley of the Kings, the semi- mythical stronghold of Troy, the jungle-shrouded pyramids of the Maya, and the cities and palaces of the empire of Assyria. Thus, real stories of archaeological finds by imperial adventurers succeeded in capturing the public's imagination. Between 1871 and the First World War, the number of published lost world narratives, set in every continent, dramatically increased. The genre has similar themes to \\"mythical kingdoms\\", such as Atlantis and El Dorado. History King Solomon's Mines (1885) by H. Rider Haggard is sometimes considered the first lost world narrative.According to Robert E. Morsberger in the \\"Afterword\\" of King Solomon's Mines, The Reader's Digest (1993). Haggard's novel shaped the form and influenced later lost world narratives, including Rudyard Kipling's The Man Who Would Be King (1888), Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World (1912), Edgar Rice Burroughs' The Land That Time Forgot (1918), A. Merritt's The Moon Pool (1918), and H. P. Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness (1931). Earlier works, such as Edward Bulwer-Lytton's Vril: The Power of the Coming Race (1871) and Samuel Butler's Erewhon (1872) use a similar plot as a vehicle for Swiftian social satire rather than romantic adventure. Other early examples are Simon Tyssot de Patot's Voyages et Aventures de Jacques Mass√© (1710), which includes a prehistoric fauna and flora, and Robert Paltock's The Life and Adventures of Peter Wilkins (1751), an 18th-century imaginary voyage inspired by both Defoe and Swift, where a man named Peter Wilkins discovers a race of winged people on an isolated island surrounded by high cliffs as in Burrough's Caspak. The 1820 Hollow Earth novel Symzonia has also been cited as the first of the lost world form, and Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) and The Village in the Treetops (1901) popularized the theme of surviving pockets of prehistoric species. J.-H. Rosny a√Æn√© would later publish The Amazing Journey of Hareton Ironcastle (1922), a novel where an expedition in the heart of Africa discovers a mysterious area with an ecosystem from another world, with alien flora and fauna. Edgar Allan Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838) has certain lost world elements towards the end of the tale. James Hilton's Lost Horizon (1933) enjoyed popular success in using the genre as a takeoff for popular philosophy and social comment. It introduced the name Shangri-La, a meme for the idealization of the lost world as a Paradise. Similar books where the inhabitants of the lost world are seen as superior to the outsiders, are Joseph O'Neill's Land under England (1935) and Douglas Valder Duff's Jack Harding‚Äôs Quest (1939).\\"The Lost World\\". \\"Reader's Guide\\" (from file name) to Doyle's The Lost World. The Lost World Read 2009 (lostworldread.com). Herg√© also explores the theme in his comics The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun (1944‚Äì48). Here the protagonists encounter an unknown Inca kingdom in the Andes. Contemporary examples Contemporary American novelist Michael Crichton invokes this tradition in his novel Congo (1980), which involves a quest for King Solomon's mines, fabled to be in a lost African city called Zinj. During the 1990s, James Gurney published a series of juvenile novels about a lost island called Dinotopia, in which humans live alongside living dinosaurs. The lost world is present in many other media. In video games, it is most notably present in Tomb Raider and its sequels, and in the Uncharted franchise. The Hanna-Barbera action cartoon Space Ghost features a segment Dino Boy in the Lost Valley, about a young boy named Todd who survives a plane crash and lands In a hidden prehistoric valley in South America. In movies, the Indiana Jones franchise makes use of similar concepts. Also comics make use of the idea, such as the Savage Land in Marvel Comics and Themyscira in DC comics. Geographic settings Early lost world novels were typically set in parts of the world as yet unexplored by Europeans. Favorite locations were the interior of Africa (many of Haggard's novels, Burroughs' Tarzan novels) or inland South America (Doyle's The Lost World, Merritt's The Face in the Abyss), as well as Central Asia (Kipling's The Man Who Would Be King, Haggard's Ayesha, the Return of She, Merritt's The Metal Monster, Hilton's Lost Horizon) and Australia (James Francis Hogan's The Lost Explorer and Eureka by Owen Hall (pseudonym of New Zealand politician Hugh Lusk)). Later writers favored Antarctica, especially as a refuge for prehistoric species. Burroughs' The Land That Time Forgot and its sequels were set on the island of Caprona (a.k.a. Caspak) in the Southern Ocean. In Edison Marshall's Dian of the Lost Land (1935), Cro-Magnons, Neanderthals, and mammoths survive in the \\"Moss Country\\", a sheltered warm corner of the continent. Dennis Wheatley's novel The Man Who Missed the War (1945) also deals with a warm and hidden area on the continent, where there live humans such as the descendants of Atlantis.\\"Sex, Jingoism & Black Magic: The Weird Fiction of Dennis Wheatley\\". Jessica Amanda Salmonson. ¬©2000. Violet Books (violetbooks.com). In Jeremy Robinson's Antarktos Rising (2007), dinosaurs and Nephilim emerge as the icecap melts. Mat Johnson's Pym (2011) describes giant white hominids living in ice caves. Ian Cameron's The Mountains at the Bottom of the World (1972) has a relict population of Paranthropus living not quite in Antarctica, but in the southern Chilean Andes. Crusoe Warburton (1954), by Victor Wallace Germains, describes an island in the far South Atlantic, with a lost, pre-gunpowder empire. According to Allienne Becker, there was a logical evolution from the lost world subgenre to the planetary romance genre: \\"When there were no longer any unexplored corners of our earth, the Lost Worlds Romance turned to space.\\" Brian Stableford makes a related point about Lost Worlds: \\"The motif has gradually fallen into disuse by virtue of increasing geographical knowledge; these days lost lands have to be very well hidden indeed or displaced beyond some kind of magical or dimensional boundary. Such displacement [...] so transforms their significance that they are better thought of as Secondary Worlds or Otherworlds.\\"Stableford, Brian (1997). \\"Lost Lands and Continents\\".

Symptoms can include headache, one-sided weakness, vomiting, seizures, decreased level of consciousness, and neck stiffness. Often symptoms get worse over time. Fever is also common. In many cases bleeding is present in both the brain tissue and the ventricles. Causes include brain trauma, aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and brain tumors. The largest risk factors for spontaneous bleeding are high blood pressure and amyloidosis. Other risk factors include alcoholism, low cholesterol, blood thinners, and cocaine use. Diagnosis is typically by CT scan. Other conditions that may present similarly include ischemic stroke. Treatment should typically be carried out in an intensive care unit. Guidelines recommended decreasing the blood pressure to a systolic of 140 mmHg. Blood thinners should be reversed if possible and blood sugar kept in the normal range. Surgery to place a ventricular drain may be used to treat hydrocephalus but corticosteroids should not be used. Surgery to remove the blood is useful in certain cases. Cerebral bleeding affects about 2.5 per 10,000 people each year. It occurs more often in males and older people. About 44% of those affected die within a month. A good outcome occurs in about 20% of those affected. Intracerebral hemorrhage was first distinguished from strokes due to insufficient blood flow, so called \\"leaks and plugs\\", in 1823. Signs and symptoms People with intracerebral bleeding have symptoms that correspond to the functions controlled by the area of the brain that is damaged by the bleed.Vinas FC and Pilitsis J. 2006. \\"Penetrating Head Trauma.\\" Emedicine.com. Other symptoms include those that indicate a rise in intracranial pressure caused by a large mass putting pressure on the brain. Intracerebral bleeds are often misdiagnosed as subarachnoid hemorrhages due to the similarity in symptoms and signs. A severe headache followed by vomiting is one of the more common symptoms of intracerebral hemorrhage. Collapsing is another symptom. Some people may experience continuous bleeding from the ear. Some patients may also go into a coma before the bleed is noticed. Causes posterior fossa Intracerebral bleeds are the second most common cause of stroke, accounting for 10% of hospital admissions for stroke. High blood pressure raises the risks of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage by two to six times. More common in adults than in children, intraparenchymal bleeds are usually due to penetrating head trauma, but can also be due to depressed skull fractures.

Retrieved on June 19, 2007. rupture of an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and bleeding within a tumor are additional causes. Amyloid angiopathy is a not uncommon cause of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients over the age of 55. A very small proportion is due to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Risk factors for ICH include: * Hypertension (high blood pressure) * Diabetes mellitus * Menopause * Excessive alcohol consumption * Severe migraine Cigarette smoking may be a risk factor but the association is weak. Traumautic intracerebral hematomas are divided into acute and delayed. Acute intracerebral hematomas occur at the time of the injury while delayed intracerebral hematomas have been reported from as early as 6 hours post injury to as long as several weeks. Diagnosis Spontaneous ICH with hydrocephalus on CT scan Both computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) have been proved to be effective in diagnosing intracranial vascular malformations after ICH. So frequently, a CT angiogram will be performed in order to exclude a secondary cause of hemorrhage or to detect a \\"spot sign\\". Intraparenchymal hemorrhage can be recognized on CT scans because blood appears brighter than other tissue and is separated from the inner table of the skull by brain tissue. The tissue surrounding a bleed is often less dense than the rest of the brain because of edema, and therefore shows up darker on the CT scan. = Location = When due to high blood pressure, intracerebral hemorrhages typically occur in the putamen (50%) or thalamus (15%), cerebrum (10-20%), cerebellum (10-13%), pons (7-15%), or elsewhere in the brainstem (1-6%). Treatment Treatment depends substantially on the type of ICH. Rapid CT scan and other diagnostic measures are used to determine proper treatment, which may include both medication and surgery. *Tracheal intubation is indicated in people with decreased level of consciousness or other risk of airway obstruction. *IV fluids are given to maintain fluid balance, using isotonic rather than hypotonic fluids. =Medication= *One review found that antihypertensive therapy to bring down the blood pressure in acute phases appears to improve outcomes. Other reviews found an unclear difference between intensive and less intensive blood pressure control. The American Heart Association and American Stroke Association guidelines in 2015 recommended decreasing the blood pressure to a SBP of 140 mmHg. However, the evidence finds tentative usefulness as of 2015. *Giving Factor VIIa within 4 hours limits the bleeding and formation of a hematoma. However, it also increases the risk of thromboembolism.eMedicine Specialties > Neurology > Neurological Emergencies > Intracranial Haemorrhage: Treatment & Medication. By David S Liebeskind, MD.

Prognosis The risk of death from an intraparenchymal bleed in traumatic brain injury is especially high when the injury occurs in the brain stem.Sanders MJ and McKenna K. 2001. Mosby's Paramedic Textbook, 2nd revised Ed. Chapter 22, \\"Head and Facial Trauma.\\" Mosby. Intraparenchymal bleeds within the medulla oblongata are almost always fatal, because they cause damage to cranial nerve X, the vagus nerve, which plays an important role in blood circulation and breathing. This kind of hemorrhage can also occur in the cortex or subcortical areas, usually in the frontal or temporal lobes when due to head injury, and sometimes in the cerebellum.Graham DI and Gennareli TA. Chapter 5, \\"Pathology of Brain Damage After Head Injury\\" Cooper P and Golfinos G. 2000. Head Injury, 4th Ed. Morgan Hill, New York. For spontaneous ICH seen on CT scan, the death rate (mortality) is 34‚Äì50% by 30 days after the insult, and half of the deaths occur in the first 2 days. Even though the majority of deaths occurs in the first days after ICH, survivors have a long term excess mortality of 27% compared to the general population. Epidemiology It accounts for 20% of all cases of cerebrovascular disease in the United States, behind cerebral thrombosis (40%) and cerebral embolism (30%).Page 117 in: History Intracerebral hemorrhage was first distinguished from strokes due to insufficient blood flow, so called \\"leaks and plugs\\", in 1823. Research The inflammatory response triggered by stroke has been viewed as harmful in the early stage, focusing on blood-borne leukocytes, neutrophils and macrophages, and resident microglia and astrocytes. A human postmortem study shows that inflammation occurs early and persists for several days after ICH. Modulating microglial activation and polarization might mitigate intracerebral hemorrhage-induced brain injury and improve brain repair. A new area of interest is the role of mast cells in ICH.

The lake is located just to the south of the Gatineau River, and just west of the Ottawa River, and is linked to both of them with flowing in from the Gatineau and exiting to the Ottawa. To the south is the Lac de la Carri√®re, a former quarry that is now a lake that is also linked. The lake is named after Andrew Leamy, an Irish settler in the region who operated a mill near the lake. He was married to Erexina Wright, the granddaughter of Hull's founder, Philemon Wright. The area became heavily industrialized in the nineteenth century. Much of the industry left the area after the Second World War and in the 1960s much of the area around the lake was turned into a large park. The beach on the lakeshore became a popular swimming location, however there were persistent problems with pollution, mainly flowing in from the Gatineau River. To solve this the inflow to the lake was blocked in the 1970s. This solved some of the problem. By the 1990s the Gatineau River had become much cleaner, and the stagnation of the lake was causing its own problems, the channel was thus reopened. On the southern shore of the lake, between it and Lac de la Carri√®re, is the Casino du Lac-Leamy, one of the region's major tourist attractions.

The first family's residential cabin was known as the \\"Brown House\\" in contrast to their more famous residence, the White House. Rapidan Camp was precursor of the current presidential retreat, Camp David. 1929: Founding In November 1928, Herbert Hoover was overwhelmingly elected as 31st President of the United States. While all preceding Presidents came from the Eastern half of the United States, Hoover's origins were further from Washington, D.C.‚Äîhe had been born in Iowa and spent much of his life in California. Returning home to routinely escape the pressure and spotlight of the presidency would not be possible, so he desired a closer casual retreat. Hoover and his wife had lived together at mining camps while he served as a mine engineer for over 10 years and appreciated the isolation of remote accommodations. He instructed his secretary Lawrence Richey to find a secluded retreat site within 100 miles (160 km) of Washington, D.C., at least 2,500 feet (760 m) above sea level to avoid mosquitoes and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîclose to an excellent trout stream for fishing.. Herbert and Lou Henry Hoover on a footbridge at camp Virginia Governor Harry F. Byrd was a strong supporter of plans to establish Shenandoah National Park, and persuaded Will Carson, Chairman of Virginia's Commission on Conservation and Development, to lead the effort. Two months before Hoover's March inauguration, Carson recommended that the President-elect and his wife Lou Henry Hoover consider establishing their camp at the headwaters of the Rapidan River. The remote, undeveloped site lay on Doubletop Mountain, on the eastern slope of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Madison County. The Mill Prong and the Laurel Prong streams join within the camp to form the Rapidan River, and all three provide excellent fishing. Less than three weeks after Hoover's March 4 inauguration, the Madison Eagle announced the President and his wife had selected the upper Rapidan site. Although Virginians offered to give Hoover the camp, the President used his own funds to buy the land for $1,045 (at the going rate of $5 per acre), and building materials for $22,719. The Marine Corps provided construction labor as a \\"military exercise.\\" The Hoovers initially envisioned a village of tents, but soon decided on a more permanent settlement. Mrs. Hoover oversaw construction as the Marines built thirteen assorted buildings including a lodge, two mess halls, cabins and a \\"Town Hall.\\" They also created several miles of hiking trails, a stone fountain, concrete-lined trout pools, and a miniature golf course. To reduce the Presidential budget, Hoover decommissioned the Presidential Yacht Mayflower shortly after taking office. The Filipino mess crew from the Mayflower were transferred to Rapidan Camp, along with the kitchen supplies and china. 1929‚Äì1933: Presidential Retreat The First Lady's bedroom At the 164 acre (66 hectare) Rapidan Camp, President Hoover enjoyed fishing in the streams, which were stocked with trout by the Interior Department. While Mrs. Hoover enjoyed riding horses at camp, Mr. Hoover did not enjoy riding horses simply to reach the camp. The state of Virginia added a one-mile extension from Rapidan Camp to a nearby road they had already planned. The road remains unpaved to this day, and occasionally challenged the presidential motorcade. The New York Times described camp as \\"frontier-like\\". Mrs. Hoover described the drive and camp: In a public speech at the celebration of \\"Hoover Day\\" in the county seat of Madison, on August 17, 1929, President Hoover spoke of fishing and his camp: President Hoover fly fishing at Rapidan Camp Fishing was conducted only outside the camp grounds, and the fish within camp were \\"so tame that if you threw a pebble in the water they will rush out at it, or perhaps drift slowly into the open to look you over.\\" Guests at Rapidan Camp The outdoor fireplace U.S. and foreign leaders came to the isolated and secure location of Rapidan Camp for strategy sessions with the President. His distinguished guests included inventor Thomas A. Edison and his wife, aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife Anne Morrow Lindbergh, Supreme Court Justice Harlan F. Stone, Governor Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., psychologist Lillian Moller Gilbreth, businessman Edsel Ford, and British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald and Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill. The President and guests would head immediately for the fishing ponds after arriving at camp. The press were rarely, if ever, invited to Rapidan Camp with the President, until his final year in office when he campaigned for a second term and \\"invited a massed attack by film men who were given the run of the camp.\\" However, the President was not without friends in the press, and at least one of those, \\"Ding\\" Darling, the accomplished cartoonist for The Des Moines Register and with whom Mr. Hoover shared an interest in conservation of natural resources, was a guest at the Camp on several occasions. On one of those visits, Ding and the President were on horseback and took advantage of briefly escaping the eyes of the Secret Service, taking a side trail to a deserted Forest Service observation tower. They dammed the creek beside the tower, caught and cooked lunch, and then watched the Secret Service comb the hills in search of them. Hoover's trips to camp were sometimes leisurely enough that he stopped for a roadside picnic. \\"Motorists paused along the highway, gaped at their President having fun.\\" At other times, his departure from camp to Washington was so sudden that sandwiches were dispatched from the camp kitchen to the President for consumption en route, and Hoover was \\"intensely annoyed\\" when the press reported that his motorcade had sped at , in violation of Virginia's speed limit of . Lou Henry Hoover sometimes drove her own car. Camp Rapidan featured a large outdoor stone fireplace which was the backdrop for many photographs of the Hoovers and their guests. At Rapidan Camp, President Hoover offered to buy Bermuda, Trinidad, and British Honduras from Prime Minister MacDonald in exchange for most of Britain's war debt (from World War I) to the United States. But days later came the Wall Street Crash that marked the beginning of the Great Depression. In addition, Hoover and MacDonald came to an agreement that formed the basis of the 1930 London Naval Treaty while meeting at Rapidan Camp, talking for hours sitting on an \\"historic log\\". Rapidan Camp also gave name to the \\"Rapidan Plan\\" for deploying the Girl Scouts of the USA to help alleviate the economic collapse. =Hoover's birthday opossum and the Mountain School= A well-publicized story arose in August 1929, when a boy who lived in the nearby mountains presented President Hoover with a live opossum on his 55th birthday. Six months later, the President arranged for a new schoolhouse in the area, which had been so remote that no school existed previously. The incident resulted in a variety of legends and a great deal of apocryphal media publicity, including tales that the boy had managed to sneak past the Marine guard on duty before giving the opossum to the President as a birthday present. The schoolhouse in 2008. It was relocated in the late 1930s to the Big Meadows Ranger Area and converted to a ranger station. The rear section with lower-pitch roof was added after the move. However, the best understanding of historians is that the story originated weeks earlier when Admiral Joel T. Boone, Hoover's physician, was exploring trails in the surrounding mountains and came upon an eleven-year-old boy named Ray Buracker. Boone learned that Buracker and his eight brothers and sisters had never attended school. The area in which they lived, known as Dark Hollow, had no school. When the President heard of Buracker, he said \\"Tell that boy if he will bring me an opossum down here I'll give him five dollars.\\" Boone delivered the message, but nothing happened until August 10, the President's birthday, when Boone visited Dark Hollow again on horseback. The boy said he had caught an opossum for the President. With the inducement of riding to camp, the shy boy was persuaded to present his opossum directly to the President and his guest, Charles Lindbergh. Anne Morrow Lindbergh was amused to hear that Buracker and his friends had never heard of her famous husband. The President raised money to build a small schoolhouse that included an apartment for Christine Vest, the teacher they hired. Vest had been trained in the special needs of education in remote mountain communities. The first year's class of twenty-two students ranged from 6 to 20 years of age. The story of the backwoods mountain schoolhouse was publicized nationally, resulting in donations including schoolbooks, furniture, and a piano. The President took a personal interest in the school, and welcomed its students to the White House on numerous occasions. After Hoover left office, the student body dwindled as the surrounding population was forced via a blanket condemnation law to leave the area for the establishment of Shenandoah National Park in 1935. The school building was transported to Big Meadows on Skyline Drive and used as a ranger station and residence. =Cabinet Members' Camp= In 1930, Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur, Attorney General William D. Mitchell, and Secretary of Agriculture Arthur M. Hyde arranged for the Marines to construct a separate camp for members of Hoover's cabinet, downriver from the President's camp. The Cabinet Camp was built on land planned for incorporation into Shenandoah National Park, but still privately owned by the Madison Timber Corporation. No lease was signed, and a dispute arose about whether the Cabinet members had an oral contract with Madison Timber to construct the camp. Marines escorted timbermen off the property \\"by the seat of the pants,\\" and Madison Timber was assessed property taxes for road and building improvements to which the Marines prohibited access. The conflict was covered in Time magazine, the Associated Press, and Madison Eagle newspaper. In 1931, the Ward-Rue Lumber Company filed a claim that it owned the property. Under the eventual settlement, cabinet members were allowed to use the camp throughout the Hoover administration, and the property owner resumed custody once Hoover left office. The National Park Service ran out of park expansion funds before purchasing the Cabinet Camp. The rising value of the property once the road and camp were constructed likely led the state to purchase cheaper park expansion land elsewhere. In 1953, a cooperative of 14 families called Rapidan Camps was created to purchase the dilapidated Cabinet Camp from Ward-Rue. Rapidan Camps rehabilitated the cabins, and over the decades its membership has grown to approximately 100 families who share the facility as a seasonal retreat. The camp now has five cabins‚Äîthree of the four original Hoover-era cabins and two constructed since in a similar architectural style. It is designated on local hiking maps as \\"Rapidan Family Camp\\" to distinguish it from the name the National Park Service restored to the President's main camp in 2004, \\"Rapidan Camp\\". =Marine Camp= The Marine Camp A separate camp was constructed to the east of Camp Rapidan to house the Marines who provided the camp's construction, maintenance, and security. The camp initially consisted largely of tents with a few wooden cabins, but more cabins eventually replaced the tents. Many Marines were selected for Rapidan duty due to their skills in carpentry, plumbing, and other work needed at camp. When the President was at camp, from 150 to 250 Marines were stationed there; during the winter only about a dozen.Lambert, pp. 310-311 When local Virginians complained that the Marines were not attending church, the President ordered a Navy Chaplain to provide Sunday services in the Marine Camp mess hall. The Marine Camp was demolished in 1944. 1933‚Äì2000: Federal and Boy Scout camp When President Hoover lost his bid for re-election in 1932, he and his wife offered the camp for use by subsequent Presidents and donated the camp property to the federal government to become part of the new Shenandoah National Park then under development. =Roosevelt administration= With encouragement from Virginia Governor Pollard and Senator Byrd, President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited Rapidan Camp in 1933, but found the narrow trails too rough for his wheelchair, and the mountain streams too cold for swimming. A plan was drafted to install a heated swimming pool for Roosevelt, but never implemented. In 1935, Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes reported, \\"President Roosevelt is not able to make such use of the camp as President Hoover undoubtedly had in mind. Whether it is to continue to be a Presidential camp must, therefore, be left for future determination.\\" FDR went on to establish his retreat in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland at Camp Shangri-La, later renamed Camp David. While the Park Service pledged to maintain Rapidan Camp, in 1936, The New York Times described rust and dry rot at the camp, which was still protected by seven Marines. The \\"historic log\\" Hoover and MacDonald had conferred on was destroyed by woodpeckers. During FDR's tenure, Rapidan Camp was used by Cabinet members, particularly Secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson who spent much time at camp until he died there in 1939. The camp then fell into disrepair.Lambert, pp. 120-139 =Boy Scout camp= In 1946, the Shenandoah Park Superintendent reported that the camp was unused and requested federal funds for repairs or demolition. In 1948, the Boy Scouts of America were granted a twenty-year lease to use it as a summer camp, which was also in accordance with Hoover's wishes. During its use as a Boy Scout camp, the facility was renamed \\"Camp Hoover.\\" As maintenance costs rose, however, the Scouts withdrew from the lease in 1958. In 1960, the structures built by the Boy Scouts and many decayed Hoover-era buildings were demolished, leaving only three of the original buildings. =Federal retreat= From 1960 to 1963, further rehabilitation work was done at camp. Some Presidents have expressed interest in the camp, but Jimmy Carter was the first President since FDR to visit.Lambert, p. 142 Until 1992, the camp was a vacation perk for high- ranking federal government officials, including Alaska Senator Ted Stevens and Vice President Walter Mondale, who was snowed in on one visit and had to be cut out by Secret Service officers with chainsaws.. Vice President Al Gore was one of the last senior government executives to stay there overnight. The camp was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1988, under the name \\"Camp Hoover\\". 2001‚Äìpresent: Restored, opened to public Rapidan Camp in 2007 In 2004, Shenandoah National Park completed a restoration of the grounds and the remaining three cabins to their condition in the era of the Hoover presidency. The three buildings are the Brown House (President's Cabin), the Prime Minister's Cabin, and the Creel. Interpretive signs have been installed to help visitors understand life in 1931, the midpoint of the Hoover presidency. The camp's name has been officially changed from Camp Hoover back to Rapidan Camp. During the restoration, many post-Hoover improvements were removed. The river is still known for its trout fishing‚ÄîTrout Unlimited ranks it #38 in their Guide to America's 100 Best Trout Streams. =Public access= Rapidan Camp is accessible by a 4.1 mile (6 km) round-trip hike on Mill Prong Trail, which begins on Skyline Drive at Milam Gap (Mile 52.8)‚Äîsee the guide to the hike at. The National Park Service also offers guided van trips that leave from the Harry F. Byrd Visitor Center at Big Meadows. During much of the spring, summer, and fall, an interpretive guide stays at camp and provides tours. The Brown House is decorated as it was in Hoover's day; the Prime Minister's Cabin contains interpretive exhibits. The camp is also accessible from the extremely rough, unpaved Quaker Run Road accessible near Criglersville. However, vehicles are prohibited beyond a fire gate at the park boundary one mile from camp, with very limited parking. Visitors must reach the camp on foot, as bicycles are prohibited on unpaved roads within the park. Backcountry camping is prohibited within of Rapidan Camp. Architecture The cabin porches were built in place around existing trees To design the cabins at Rapidan Camp, Lou Henry Hoover hired an architect who had built Girl Scout camps. The facilities were extremely rustic by modern standards. Some of the early structures such as the original Five Tents had just a wooden floor and walls, with canvas tents above. Even the President's Cabin was built with single-wall uninsulated construction‚Äîslats of German Siding nailed to studs and exposed on both sides. There are no interior ceilings; rafters and roof boards are exposed. Shower stalls have tin walls and concrete floors. During Hoover's administration, cabin porches were decorated with boxes filled with geraniums, and interior floors were covered with grass rugs. The camp was modified throughout Hoover's presidency with new cabins and additions to existing cabins. On cold days, large stone fireplaces provide some warmth, but were not intended to keep the camp warm in winter. There was never a shortage of firewood in Hoover's day because the chestnut blight had ravaged the forest; after her first visit to the Rapidan area, Mrs. Hoover had written \\"There are innumerable, enormous dead chestnuts standing all over the place.\\"Lambert, pp. 9-10 On hot days, hinged wooden panels fold down to expose large copper screens to provide a great deal of ventilation. These panels and numerous windows cover most of the outside perimeter of the cabins. From the 1960s through 1980s, they hardly seemed necessary, for the hemlock trees formed a thick canopy and kept the shaded grounds cool. However, in the early 1990s, the hemlock woolly adelgid began destroying the hemlock trees, so the surrounding forest is again scattered with dead and fallen trees as in Hoover's day. The cabins are equipped with electricity and plumbing, with visible wiring snaking along the walls and rafters. Large elevated outdoor decks were built with holes for the trunks of mature live trees, whose branches sheltered the cabins and porches. A replica of a corner of the President's cabin and surrounding deck is located inside the Hoover Presidential Library in Iowa.

It is frequently seen in females with absent knee or ankle jerks and impaired sweating. The syndrome is caused by damage to the postganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic innervation of the eye, usually by a viral or bacterial infection that causes inflammation, and affects the pupil of the eye and the autonomic nervous system. It is named after the British neurologists William John Adie and Gordon Morgan Holmes, who independently described the same disease in 1931. Signs and symptoms Adie syndrome presents with three hallmark symptoms, namely at least one abnormally dilated pupil (mydriasis) which does not constrict in response to light, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and abnormalities of sweating. Other signs may include hyperopia due to accommodative paresis, photophobia and difficulty reading. Some individual with Adie syndrome may also have cardiovascular abnormalities. Pathophysiology Pupillary symptoms of Holmes‚ÄìAdie syndrome are thought to be the result of a viral or bacterial infection that causes inflammation and damage to neurons in the ciliary ganglion, located in the posterior orbit, that provides parasympathetic control of eye constriction. Additionally, patients with Holmes-Adie Syndrome can also experience problems with autonomic control of the body. This second set of symptoms is caused by damage to the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord. Adie's pupil is supersensitive to ACh so a muscarinic agonist (e.g. pilocarpine) whose dose would not be able to cause pupillary constriction in a normal patient, would cause it in a patient with Adie's Syndrome. The circuitry for the pupillary constriction does not descend below the upper midbrain, henceforth impaired pupillary constriction is extremely important to detect as it can be an early sign of brainstem herniation. Diagnosis Clinical exam may reveal sectoral paresis of the iris sphincter or vermiform iris movements. The tonic pupil may become smaller (miotic) over time which is referred to as \\"little old Adie's\\". Testing with low dose (1/8%) pilocarpine may constrict the tonic pupil due to cholinergic denervation supersensitivity. A normal pupil will not constrict with the dilute dose of pilocarpine. CT scans and MRI scans may be useful in the diagnostic testing of focal hypoactive reflexes. Treatment The usual treatment of a standardised Adie syndrome is to prescribe reading glasses to correct for impairment of the eye(s). Pilocarpine drops may be administered as a treatment as well as a diagnostic measure. Thoracic sympathectomy is the definitive treatment of diaphoresis, if the condition is not treatable by drug therapy. Prognosis Adie's syndrome is not life-threatening or disabling. As such, there is no mortality rate relating to the condition; however, loss of deep tendon reflexes is permanent and may progress over time.  Epidemiology  It most commonly affects younger women (2.6:1 female preponderance) and is unilateral in 80% of cases. Average age of onset is 32 years.

In the , Toogoolawah had a population of 1,279 people. Geography Toogoolawah is in South East Queensland. Toogoolawah is a centre for gliding and parachuting and in the past the centre of a dairying industry. Cressbrook Creek, a tributary of the Brisbane River, passes through the town as does the Brisbane Valley Highway. Naming The district was originally known as Cressbrook after the Cressbrook Station operated by James Henry McConnel. The town took its present name Toogoolawah from its former railway station, which was named in November 1903 using the name Tugulawah proposed by McConnel, the name of the McConnel's residence at Bulimba, Brisbane (now known as Bulimba House). McConnel had originally suggested the name Bakewell after a village in Derbyshire, for the new town and railway station, but the Queensland Railways Department wanted to use an Aboriginal name. Toogoolawah is derived from the Aboriginal words \\"dhoo\\" (a generic term for tree) and \\"goo/lawa\\", meaning \\"crescent shaped\\" or \\"bent like a crescent moon\\". The name probably referred to a tree with a deformed trunk which stood on the site in Bulimba, rather than to the supposed shape outlined by the Brisbane River as it rounds Bulimba Point, as has been alleged. History Cressbrook Provisional School was operating in 1881 but closed in 1882 due to low student numbers; its opening date is unknown. What is now Toogoolawah town was surveyed privately when Cressbrook estate was subdivided and sold as dairy farms in 1904. The town plan was not registered with the survey office until 1 June 1909. The extension of the Brisbane Valley railway line from Esk to the new town () was opened on 8 February 1904. A Toogoolawah receiving office was opened in June 1904 and was elevated to post office status in July 1905. Toogoolawah Provisional School opened on 30 May 1905. On 1 January 1909 it became Toogoolawah State School. A secondary department was added on 28 January 1975 until a separate high school opened on 25 January 1988. On Monday 10 September 1906, St Andrew's Anglican Church Hall was opened in Toogoolwah by Archbishop St Clair Donaldson. On Sunday 12 May 1912, St Andrew's Anglican Church was dedicated by Archbishop St Clair Donaldson. A condensed milk factory was built shortly after the railway station was opened. The factory was closed in 1929, after Nestl√© moved all its condensed milk production to Victoria, resulting in the town's population decreasing by half. Toogoolawah War Memorial, 2010 The Toogoolawah War Memorial commemorates those who served in World War I. Unlike most war memorials that were erected after the war, the Toogoolawah memorial was unveiled during the war on 31 March 1917 by the Rev. Chaplain Merrington. Toogoolawah State High School opened on 25 January 1988, replacing the secondary department attached to Toogoolawah State School. Toogoolawah Library had a major refurbishment in 2006. Toogoolawah was partially cut off by flooding as a result of the 2010‚Äì2011 Queensland floods.Floods continue devastating march At the , Toogoolawah had a population of 1,162.

In a dusty warehouse in North Philadelphia, Mitchell & Ness discovered rolls of old baseball flannel from 50 years earlier. They were still carefully wrapped, untouched, and in like-new condition ready to be cut and sewn. The flannel was sewn. The lettering and patches were recreated and applied. The jerseys were completed, and they were offered for sale. The first shirts sold almost overnight. So did the second batch of a dozen or more. In time, Mitchell & Ness attracted customers from across the United States.

Its closest Western analogue is probably the Western military band. History Like the Western military band, the original purpose of beleganjur was to accompany armies into battle and strike fear into the hearts of the enemy. In fact, gamelan beleganjur literally means \\"gamelan of walking warriors\\". Also like its Western counterpart, today beleganjur has mostly lost its association with warfare, and instead is associated with festivals, contests, and cremation ceremonies. Although the origin of beleganjur is uncertain, it bears resemblance to the now rare gamelan gong bheri. Instrumentation The most primitive beleganjur ensemble, known as bebatelan, consisted of only nine instruments: * one \\"great gong\\": gong ageng; * one secondary gong, with sunken boss instead of the usual raised one: bend√©; * four pairs of cymbals: (ceng-ceng); * two differently tuned drums, considered male and female: kendang; * one small handheld gong that acts as a metronome: kempli. The drums and cymbals generally play interlocking patterns over the ostinato of the gongan gong cycle. Though bebatelan itself is rarely heard nowadays, its instrumentation forms the nucleus of the more complex modern ensemble: beleganjur bebonangan. The additional instrumentation of the beleganjur bebonangan ensemble is: * a second gong ageng, forming a male/female pair of gongs; * a medium-sized gong: kempur; * four additional ceng-ceng to total eight; * two tuned hand-held metal pot-gongs: ponggang; * four similar but higher-pitched pot-gongs: bonang. The bonang are identical to the individual pots of the reyong; in fact, many groups simply remove the pots from the frame of a reyong so they can double as bonang, and bonang are often referred to as reyong for this reason. The ponggang usually play a characteristic ostinato pattern while the bonang play more complex interlocking patterns known as kotekan. Cultural role A gamelan Belenganjur player playing for the procession and cremation (ngaben) ceremony in Bali, Indonesia. Gamelan beleganjur is essential to the Hindu religious ceremonies of Bali, such as the ogoh-ogoh parades before the Balinese New Year, Nyepi. There are rites to appease evil spirits and honor good ones, temple festivals to celebrate the anniversary of a temple's dedication, and cremation ceremonies to cleanse the souls of the deceased and prepare them for reincarnation. Though some ceremonies are associated with other specific kinds of gamelan, notably cremation ceremonies with gamelan angklung, beleganjur is nevertheless ubiquitous and often takes the place of other kinds of gamelan if they are not available.

The other form is intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Intraparenchymal hemorrhage accounts for approx. 8-13% of all strokes and results from a wide spectrum of disorders. It is more likely to result in death or major disability than ischemic stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage, and therefore constitutes an immediate medical emergency. Intracerebral hemorrhages and accompanying edema may disrupt or compress adjacent brain tissue, leading to neurological dysfunction. Substantial displacement of brain parenchyma may cause elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) and potentially fatal herniation syndromes. Signs and symptoms Clinical manifestations of intraparenchymal hemorrhage are determined by the size and location of hemorrhage, but may include the following: * Hypertension, fever, or cardiac arrhythmias * Nuchal rigidity * Subhyaloid retinal hemorrhages * Altered level of consciousness * Anisocoria, nystagmus * Focal neurological deficits * Putamen - Contralateral hemiparesis, contralateral sensory loss, contralateral conjugate gaze paresis, homonymous hemianopsia, aphasia, neglect, or apraxia * Thalamus - Contralateral sensory loss, contralateral hemiparesis, gaze paresis, homonymous hemianopia, miosis, aphasia, or confusion * Lobar - Contralateral hemiparesis or sensory loss, contralateral conjugate gaze paresis, homonymous hemianopia, abulia, aphasia, neglect, or apraxia * Caudate nucleus - Contralateral hemiparesis, contralateral conjugate gaze paresis, or confusion * Brain stem - Tetraparesis, facial weakness, decreased level of consciousness, gaze paresis, ocular bobbing, miosis, or autonomic instability * Cerebellum - Ataxia, usually beginning in the trunk, ipsilateral facial weakness, ipsilateral sensory loss, gaze paresis, skew deviation, miosis, or decreased level of consciousness Causes * Hypertension * Arteriovenous malformation * Aneurysm rupture * Cerebral amyloid angiopathy * Intracranial neoplasm * Coagulopathy * Hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic stroke * Cerebral venous thrombosis * Sympathomimetic drug abuse * Moyamoya disease * Sickle cell disease * Eclampsia or postpartum vasculopathy * Infection * Vasculitis * Neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage * Trauma In younger patients, vascular malformations, specifically AVMs and cavernous angiomas are more common causes for hemorrhage. In addition, venous malformations are associated with hemorrhage. In the elderly population, amyloid angiopathy is associated with cerebral infarcts as well as hemorrhage in superficial locations, rather than deep white matter or basal ganglia. These are usually described as \\"lobar\\". These bleedings are not associated with systemic amyloidosis. Hemorrhagic neoplasms are more complex, heterogeneous bleeds often with associated edema. These hemorrhages are related to tumor necrosis, vascular invasion and neovascularity. Glioblastomas are the most common primary malignancies to hemorrhage while thyroid, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and lung cancer are the most common causes of hemorrhage from metastatic disease. Other causes of intraparenchymal hemorrhage include hemorrhagic transformation of infarction which is usually in a classic vascular distribution and is seen in approximately 24 to 48 hours following the ischemic event. This hemorrhage rarely extends into the ventricular system. Pathophysiology Nontraumatic intraparenchymal hemorrhage most commonly results from hypertensive damage to blood vessel walls e.g.: \\\\- hypertension \\\\- eclampsia \\\\- drug abuse, but it also may be due to autoregulatory dysfunction with excessive cerebral blood flow e.g.: \\\\- reperfusion injury \\\\- hemorrhagic transformation \\\\- cold exposure \\\\- rupture of an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation (AVM) \\\\- arteriopathy (e.g. cerebral amyloid angiopathy, moyamoya) \\\\- altered hemostasis (e.g. thrombolysis, anticoagulation, bleeding diathesis) \\\\- hemorrhagic necrosis (e.g. tumor, infection) \\\\- venous outflow obstruction (e.g. cerebral venous sinus thrombosis). Nonpenetrating and penetrating cranial trauma can also be common causes of intracerebral hemorrhage. Diagnosis Intraparenchymal hemorrhage CT-scan of intraparenchymal hemorrhage Computed tomography (CT scan): A CT scan may be normal if it is done soon after the onset of symptoms. A CT scan is the best test to look for bleeding in or around your brain. In some hospitals, a perfusion CT scan may be done to see where the blood is flowing and not flowing in your brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan): A special MRI technique (diffusion MRI) may show evidence of an ischemic stroke within minutes of symptom onset. In some hospitals, a perfusion MRI scan may be done to see where the blood is flowing and not flowing in your brain. Angiogram: a test that looks at the blood vessels that feed the brain. An angiogram will show whether the blood vessel is blocked by a clot, the blood vessel is narrowed, or if there is an abnormality of a blood vessel known as an aneurysm. Carotid duplex: A carotid duplex is an ultrasound study that assesses whether or not you have atherosclerosis (narrowing) of the carotid arteries. These arteries are the large blood vessels in your neck that feed your brain. Transcranial Doppler (TCD): Transcranial Doppler is an ultrasound study that assesses whether or not you have atherosclerosis (narrowing) of the blood vessels inside of your brain. It can also be used to see if you have emboli (blood clots) in your blood vessels. Treatment Intracerebral hemorrhages is a severe condition requiring prompt medical attention. Treatment goals include lifesaving interventions, supportive measures, and control of symptoms. Treatment depends on the location, extent, and cause of the bleeding. Often, treatment can reverse the damage that has been done. A craniotomy is sometimes done to remove blood, abnormal blood vessels, or a tumor. Medications may be used to reduce swelling, prevent seizures, lower blood pressure, and control pain.

He has also appeared in Beck's music video Sexx Laws which also featured Jack Black, in Thirty Seconds to Mars' video Up in the Air, and he made a brief appearance as a cancer patient in episode 4, season six of Curb Your Enthusiasm. = The Game and the seduction community = After leaving The New York Times to ghostwrite Jenna Jameson's memoirs, Strauss joined a sub-culture of pick-up artists known as the seduction community, creating the persona of \\"Style\\" in 2001Neil Strauss (Style), Dating Skills Review and pseudonym of \\"Chris Powles\\", eventually publishing an article in The New York Times about his experiences in 2004. In 2005, he published The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists (Regan Books, 2005), a book about his transformation into \\"Style\\", a pickup artist under the tutelage of Mystery. In addition to documenting his experiences with pickup artists like Mystery, Steve P, Rasputin (Hypnotica), Ross Jeffries, and numerous others, it also describes his interactions with celebrities including Britney Spears, Tom Cruise, and Courtney Love. The book made a month-long appearance in The New York Times bestsellers list in September‚ÄìOctober 2005, and reached the #1 position on Amazon.com immediately after its release in the United States. Strauss appeared on various TV shows, including The View and ABC Primetime, and he participated in many book signings. It was optioned to be made into a film by Spyglass Entertainment, with Chris Weitz adapting and producing. After publishing the book, Strauss temporarily retired as a pickup artist and settled with a longtime girlfriend Lisa Leveridge, who played guitar in Courtney Love's all-female band The Chelsea.Emma Forrest: \\"All the right moves.\\" The Observer, September 11, 2005 An article in the Sunday Mirror suggested that Leveridge broke up with Strauss in February 2006 to date Robbie Williams. Strauss denied the Williams rumor, but confirmed his breakup with Leveridge on his mailing list a few months later. His follow-up book, the graphic novel How to Make Money Like a Porn Star, was published on September 26, 2006. The same year, \\"Shoot\\", Strauss' short film about becoming a rock star, was released. He co-wrote, directed and performed in Shoot. Also in 2006, in collaboration with Dave Navarro and Entourage writer Cliff Dorfman, he created a one-hour TV drama The Product for FX.Daily Variety, August 18, 2006, \\"FX amps up rock drama\\" by Denise Martin He also worked with James Gandolfini on a show, Roadies, for HBO. In 2007, he released a follow-up to The Game, Rules of the Game, a two-book boxed set. Strauss has continued to be involved with pickup artistry through his dating coaching company Stylelife Academy, founded in 2007. Most of the coaching is done by employed coaches, rather than Strauss himself, though he does make appearances at yearly conferences and in some video products sold by the company. In 2012, Strauss released a board game/party game as a follow up to The Game and Rules of the Game called \\"Who's Got Game? The Game with Benefits.\\" =Marriage and divorce= On August 31, 2013, Strauss married the model Ingrid De La O, whom he met in 2010. Before the wedding, he held a funeral-themed bachelor's party, laying to rest his 'Style' persona. In March 2015, Strauss had a child and shared the news on his website, along with information on his new book, The Truth: An Uncomfortable Book About Relationships, which was released on October 13, 2015. The Truth, a sequel to The Game, covers his struggles to build and maintain a relationship with Ingrid after his years of immersion in the seduction community. In an interview of October 2015, the author that popularized the pickup art industry, affirmed that \\"there are some really damaged people with hateful and distorted view of reality gathering other people who share those views\\", attracting people with \\"neurotic wounds\\" and with \\"character disorders\\", trying to find help and to change themselves. Strauss and Ingrid De La O divorced in October 2018. In February 2020, Strauss confirmed his divorce from Ingrid De La O on Gabrielle Reece's podcast and talked about his life after his divorce among other things.http://thegabbyreeceshow.libsyn.com/how-does- neil-strauss-author-of-the-game-manage-modern-dating-life-after-divorce- fatherhood-and-the-next-chapter-of-his-life =Other works= On March 4, 2009, The New York Times wrote that Strauss (along with rock biographer Anthony Bozza) had started his own publishing company, Igniter, as an imprint of HarperCollins. Igniter's first title was The Man Behind the Nose, published in 2010. It was followed by Satan Is Real: The Ballad of the Louvin Brothers, published in 2012. Strauss's book Emergency: This Book Will Save Your Life (Harper, 2009), for which he spent three years amongst survivalists, tax- dodgers, billionaire businessmen, and the government itself, was hailed by Rolling Stone as an \\"escape plan\\" for the current world crisis. It entered The New York Times bestseller list at #3. He received the presidents Volunteer Service Award for his search-and-rescue work during the writing of Emergency. The rights to the movie were picked up by Columbia Pictures, with Robert Downey Jr.. attached as a producer and probable lead actor. In 2010, Strauss received the James Joyce Award from the Literary & Historical Society of University College Dublin. Neil Strauss's 2011 release entitled Everyone Loves You When You're Dead: Journeys Into Fame and Madness was also a New York Times bestseller. Released March 15, 2011, the book is a compilation of 228 celebrity vignettes conducted throughout Strauss's career as a pop culture journalist. Neil Strauss's 2015 release entitled The Truth: An Uncomfortable Book About Relationships was also a New York Times bestseller. Released in October, 2015, this autobiographical book covers his attempts to form and maintain a long-term relationship following his years in the seduction community. It made the November 1, 2015 NYTimes bestseller list Several detailed reviews were published in Grantland and the Chicago Tribune after its publication. In June, 2017, I Can't Make This Up: Life Lessons was published with co-author Kevin Hart and immediately was a #1 NY Times Bestseller. In 2019, Strauss launched To Live and Die in LA., a true crime podcast following the death of Adea Shabani. It hit #1 on the Itunes podcasts, and was in the top 10 for four months.

As those frontiers moved ever closer to the British East India Company and later British India, there were problems both with refugees and military operations spilling over ill-defined borders. =First Anglo-Burmese War= The First Anglo-Burmese War (1824‚Äì1826) ended in a British East India Company victory, and by the Treaty of Yandabo, Burma lost territory previously conquered in Assam, Manipur, and Arakan. The British also took possession of Tenasserim with the intention to use it as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with either Burma or Siam. As the century wore on, the British East India Company began to covet the resources and main part of Burma during an era of great territorial expansion. =Second Anglo-Burmese War= In 1852, Commodore Lambert was dispatched to Burma by Lord Dalhousie over a number of minor issues related to the previous treaty. The Burmese immediately made concessions including the removal of a governor whom the British had made their casus belli. Lambert eventually provoked a naval confrontation in extremely questionable circumstances and thus started the Second Anglo-Burmese War in 1852, which ended in the British annexation of Pegu province, renamed Lower Burma. The war resulted in a palace revolution in Burma, with King Pagan Min (1846‚Äì1853) being replaced by his half brother, Mindon Min (1853‚Äì1878). =Third Anglo-Burmese War= King Mindon tried to modernise the Burmese state and economy to resist British encroachments, and he established a new capital at Mandalay, which he proceeded to fortify.German Language Institute This was not enough to stop the British, however, who claimed that Mindon's son Thibaw Min (ruled 1878‚Äì1885) was a tyrant intending to side with the French,www.enotes.com that he had lost control of the country, thus allowing for disorder at the frontiers, and that he was reneging on a treaty signed by his father. The British declared war once again in 1885, conquering the remainder of the country in the Third Anglo-Burmese War resulting in total annexation of Burma.

The LP reached No.39 in the UK, in a 4-week chart run, and eventually reached silver status for selling in excess of 60,000 copies (¬£100,000+).  Recording  Nick Mason of Pink Floyd did the original mix of Stratosfear in April 1976 at Hansa by the Wall. Due to disputes between Tangerine Dream and Virgin, this mix was abandoned. Stratosfear combines Tangerine Dream's acoustic and electronic influences more tightly than before. For instance, at the end of the last track, \\"Invisible Limits\\", the deep piano/flute tune reveals the album's romantic flavour even after the earlier predominantly synthetic compositions (tracks #1 to last part of track #4). It was Peter Baumann's last studio album with the group. The album marks the beginning of the band's development away from their uncompromising early 1970s synthesizer experiments toward a recognisably more melodic sound, a trend they would pick up again in 1979's Force Majeure. The title track \\"Stratosfear\\" has been played live many times and has been released in a re-mixed form on a number of other albums.  Critical reception  Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau said \\"I respect their synthesizer textures in theory, but these guys should leave the accessibility to Kraftwerk. When they program in received semiclassical melodies and set the automatic drummer on 'bouncy swing,' the result is the soundtrack for a space travelogue you don't want to see.\\" According to Allmusic John Bush, Stratosfear \\"shows the group's desire to advance past their stellar recent material and stake out a new musical direction\\" and also marks \\"the beginning of a more evocative approach for Tangerine Dream\\". Bush said the title track, which begins with a \\"statuesque synthesizer progression before unveiling an increasingly hypnotic line of trance\\", is the album's highlight.

It forms a boundary between the plant and the external environment. The epidermis serves several functions: it protects against water loss, regulates gas exchange, secretes metabolic compounds, and (especially in roots) absorbs water and mineral nutrients. The epidermis of most leaves shows dorsoventral anatomy: the upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) surfaces have somewhat different construction and may serve different functions. Woody stems and some other stem structures such as potato tubers produce a secondary covering called the periderm that replaces the epidermis as the protective covering. Description The epidermis is the outermost cell layer of the primary plant body. In some older works the cells of the leaf epidermis have been regarded as specialized parenchyma cells,Hill, J. Ben; Overholts, Lee O; Popp, Henry W. Grove Jr., Alvin R. Botany. A textbook for colleges. Publisher: MacGraw-Hill 1960 but the established modern preference has long been to classify the epidermis as dermal tissue, whereas parenchyma is classified as ground tissue.Evert, Ray F; Eichhorn, Susan E. Esau's Plant Anatomy: Meristems, Cells, and Tissues of the Plant Body: Their Structure, Function, and Development. Publisher: Wiley-Liss 2006. The epidermis is the main component of the dermal tissue system of leaves (diagrammed below), and also stems, roots, flowers, fruits, and seeds; it is usually transparent (epidermal cells have fewer chloroplasts or lack them completely, except for the guard cells.) The cells of the epidermis are structurally and functionally variable. Most plants have an epidermis that is a single cell layer thick. Some plants like Ficus elastica and Peperomia, which have a periclinal cellular division within the protoderm of the leaves, have an epidermis with multiple cell layers. Epidermal cells are tightly linked to each other and provide mechanical strength and protection to the plant. The walls of the epidermal cells of the above-ground parts of plants contain cutin, and are covered with a cuticle. The cuticle reduces water loss to the atmosphere, it is sometimes covered with wax in smooth sheets, granules, plates, tubes, or filaments. The wax layers give some plants a whitish or bluish surface color. Surface wax acts as a moisture barrier and protects the plant from intense sunlight and wind. The underside of many leaves have a thinner cuticle than the top side, and leaves of plants from dry climates often have thickened cuticles to conserve water by reducing transpiration. Diagram of fine scale leaf internal anatomy The epidermal tissue includes several differentiated cell types: epidermal cells, guard cells, subsidiary cells, and epidermal hairs (trichomes). The epidermal cells are the most numerous, largest, and least specialized. These are typically more elongated in the leaves of monocots than in those of dicots. Diagram of moderate scale leaf anatomy Trichomes or hairs grow out from the epidermis in many species. In the root epidermis, epidermal hairs termed root hairs are common and are specialized for the absorption of water and mineral nutrients. In plants with secondary growth, the epidermis of roots and stems is usually replaced by a periderm through the action of a cork cambium. Guard cells Stoma in a tomato leaf (microscope image) The leaf and stem epidermis is covered with pores called stomata (sing., stoma), part of a stoma complex consisting of a pore surrounded on each side by chloroplast-containing guard cells, and two to four subsidiary cells that lack chloroplasts. The stomata complex regulates the exchange of gases and water vapor between the outside air and the interior of the leaf. Typically, the stomata are more numerous over the abaxial (lower) epidermis of the leaf than the (adaxial) upper epidermis. An exception is floating leaves where most or all stomata are on the upper surface. Vertical leaves, such as those of many grasses, often have roughly equal numbers of stomata on both surfaces. The stoma is bounded by two guard cells. The guard cells differ from the epidermal cells in the following aspects: * The guard cells are bean-shaped in surface view, while the epidermal cells are irregular in shape * The guard cells contain chloroplasts, so they can manufacture food by photosynthesis (The epidermal cells do not contain chloroplasts) * Guard cells are the only epidermal cells that can make sugar. According to one theory, in sunlight, the concentration of potassium ions (K+) increases in the guard cells. This, together with the sugars formed, lowers the water potential in the guard cells. As a result, water from other cells enters the guard cells by osmosis so they swell and become turgid. Because the guard cells have a thicker cellulose wall on one side of the cell, i.e. the side around the stomatal pore, the swollen guard cells become curved and pull the stomata open. At night, the sugar is used up and water leaves the guard cells, so they become flaccid and the stomatal pore closes. In this way, they reduce the amount of water vapor escaping from the leaf. Cell differentiation in the epidermis thumb The plant epidermis consists of three main cell types: pavement cells, guard cells and their subsidiary cells that surround the stomata and trichomes, otherwise known as leaf hairs. The epidermis of petals also form a variation of trichomes called conical cells. Trichomes develop at a distinct phase during leaf development, under the control of two major trichome specification genes: TTG and GL1. The process may be controlled by the plant hormones gibberellins, and even if not completely controlled, gibberellins certainly have an effect on the development of the leaf hairs. GL1 causes endoreplication, the replication of DNA without subsequent cell division as well as cell expansion. GL1 turns on the expression of a second gene for trichome formation, GL2, which controls the final stages of trichome formation causing the cellular outgrowth. Arabidopsis thaliana uses the products of inhibitory genes to control the patterning of trichomes, such as TTG and TRY. The products of these genes will diffuse into the lateral cells, preventing them from forming trichomes and in the case of TRY promoting the formation of pavement cells. Expression of the gene MIXTA, or its analogue in other species, later in the process of cellular differentiation will cause the formation of conical cells over trichomes. MIXTA is a transcription factor. Stomatal patterning is a much more controlled process, as the stoma affects the plant's water retention and respiration capabilities. As a consequence of these important functions, differentiation of cells to form stomata is also subject to environmental conditions to a much greater degree than other epidermal cell types. Stomata are pores in the plant epidermis that are surrounded by two guard cells, which control the opening and closing of the aperture. These guard cells are in turn surrounded by subsidiary cells which provide a supporting role for the guard cells. Stomata begin as stomatal meristemoids. The process varies between dicots and monocots. Spacing is thought to be essentially random in dicots though mutants do show it is under some form of genetic control, but it is more controlled in monocots, where stomata arise from specific asymmetric divisions of protoderm cells. The smaller of the two cells produced becomes the guard mother cells. Adjacent epidermal cells will also divide asymmetrically to form the subsidiary cells. Because stomata play such an important role in the plants' survival, collecting information on their differentiation is difficult by the traditional means of genetic manipulation, as stomatal mutants tend to be unable to survive. Thus the control of the process is not well understood. Some genes have been identified. TMM is thought to control the timing of stomatal initiation specification and FLP is thought to be involved in preventing the further division of the guard cells once they are formed. Environmental conditions affect the development of stomata, in particular, their density on the leaf surface. It is thought that plant hormones, such as ethylene and cytokines, control the stomatal developmental response to the environmental conditions. Accumulation of these hormones appears to cause increased stomatal density such as when the plants are kept in closed environments.

It was first published in the 1973 anthology Bad Moon Rising: An Anthology of Political Forebodings edited by Thomas M. Disch. It was also published in several other anthologies such as Deathbird Stories. It was inspired by the murder of Kitty Genovese.  Origin of the story's title  The first use of the title \\"The Whimper of Whipped Dogs\\" was a teleplay for a 1970 episode of the TV series The Young Lawyers, which was serialized in Ellison's Los Angeles Free Press television critique column at the time, The Glass Teat. At the end of the serialization, Ellison wrote two more columns expressing his extreme frustration with what the ABC network, Paramount Pictures, producer, director and cast members (especially co-star Lee J. Cobb) had done to his teleplay during production. The columns, including the complete teleplay, were published in 1975 in the collection The Other Glass Teat. As Ellison was particularly proud of creating the title \\"The Whimper of Whipped Dogs,\\" but the title was not used onscreen in the Young Lawyers episode, the author decided to use the title again for this short story over three years later.  Reception  In reviewing Bad Moon Rising: An Anthology of Political Forebodings, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction editor Joanna Russ said \\"The Whimper of Whipped Dogs\\" is \\"a passionate, detailed, well-written New York paranoia story by Harlan Ellison which puts forward (to my mind) untenable view that violence is caused by Satan or maybe Original Sin\\" and David Hartwell of Locus calls it \\"one of his best, a dark fantasy about New York and New Yorkers.\\"  Awards  \\"The Whimper of Whipped Dogs\\" won the 1974 Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Short Story.

She participated in a new reality show aired by Star Plus named Jo Jeeta Wohi Superstar and Royal Bengal Super Star by Star Jalsa.  Early life  Ruprekha Banerjee was born on 28 July 1984 in Bongaon, Dist: North 24 Parganas, West Bengal, India, to Bengali parents, Shri. Pradip Kr. Banerjee and Smt. Kabita Banerjee. She spent the first three months of her life in her birthplace in West Bengal, and then moved to Agarpara, Kolkata, where she lived with her businessman father. She spent her first eighteen years there and completed her schooling up to the tenth standard, in Ramakrishna Mission, Barrackpore, the 12th Standard from Ariyadaha Sarbamangala Vidyapith, then Vidyasagar College and finally at the University of Calcutta with honours in zoology. She's married to an eminent personality Mr.Nalinakshya Bhattacharya and has a daughter, Sheerin Bhattacharya. As a child, she picked up her first lesson of music. She used to hum the same songs with her immature words, whatever her grandfather sang during rehearsals. It was during those days that her potential for singing was discovered by her grandfather. At the age of six, she started learning music, mainly Rabindra Sangeet, from her first Guru ‚Äì her grandfather. She gave her first stage performance at their club's annual function. At the age of seven, she started getting formal training in Hindustani Classical Music. She learnt Classical Hindustani Music from Sangeeta Das of Agarpara, Neela Goswami up to the age of 10 and Anju Chakraborty up to the age of 16. She learned light classical Hindustan music from Arun Bhaduri and thereafter, she got her initial exposure to Bengali film background songs and Bengali serial title songs. She received training in playback singing from legendary Bharat Ratna Pandit Late Bhimsen Joshi's student Maloy Banerjee at a later stage at Mumbai after shifting there. She continued her training in classical Hindustani music with Late Mira Bandhopadhya‚Äôs student Kanika Mitra. In 2005, she moved to Mumbai with her family after being crowned the winner of Fame Gurukul. She has won and has been nominated for a number of awards. She won the \\"Fame Gurukul\\" Award for Most Promising reality show for Mast, the award and the ‚ÄúSera Bengali-2006‚Äù Award.

It was composed by Buddy Baker, with lyrics written by X Atencio. Its melody has been adapted for numerous uses since its composition in the late 1960s. General overview \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts\\" features Buddy Baker's melody, usually in the key of A minor, with lyrics by Disney legend Xavier \\"X\\" Atencio. Different variations use 4/4 or 3/4 for the meter. The following chord progression is used for all versions: Am, B, Am, B, Am, F, Am, F7, Am, E7, Am. Typically, each chord lasts for two beats of 4/4 or three beats of 3/4. This underlying chord progression provides a macabre mood for the Haunted Mansion attractions. The song modulates to B-flat minor thus: Am, E7, F7, Bm and on to B-minor via Bm, F7 and F7. The melody then modulates back to A-minor after repeating a dissonant chord six times. When recording the song, the organist actually played the song backwards to achieve the discord that the composer intended. The organ part that can be heard in the song is that tune played forwards. The title comes from William Shakespeare's poem Venus and Adonis: :Look, how the world's poor people are amaz'd :At apparitions, signs, and prodigies, :Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gaz'd, :Infusing them with dreadful prophecies; ::So she at these sad sighs draws up her breath, ::And, sighing it again, exclaims on Death. :'Hard-favour'd tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean, :Hateful divorce of love,'‚Äîthus chides she Death,‚Äî :'Grim-grinning ghost, earth's worm, what dost thou mean :To stifle beauty and to steal his breath, ::Who when he liv'd, his breath and beauty set ::Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet? Variations =Haunted Mansion= Many different music loops are used throughout the Haunted Mansion attractions at Disneyland, Walt Disney World, and Tokyo Disneyland. Speakers disguised within the sets allow the music to fade in and out as guests pass through the different areas. The following variations of \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts\\" can be heard in these attractions. * Foyer: As guests enter the dimly-lit foyer, a distant organ can be heard. \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts,\\" played in the slow cadence of a funeral dirge, rumbles through the mansion. This simple arrangement is intended to set the spooky tone for the attraction. It features melody and bass line on a Robert Morton theater organ and an almost inaudible countermelody on tubular bells. * Load Area: Guests leave the \\"Stretch Room\\" and proceed down either a hall of changing portraits (Disneyland), or into the Entrance Hall (Walt Disney World). One of the ride's most unconventional musical selections plays in the background. An alto flute plays a low rendition of Baker's composition, with tubular bells doubling the melody. There is also a wind-like sound effect that follows the pitches of the song. * Music Room/Grand Staircase: In the Walt Disney World and Tokyo Disneyland versions, guests pass by a decrepit music parlor. A shadowy phantom sits at the piano, playing \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts\\" as block chords with heavy rubato. This rendition isn't heard in the original Disneyland mansion, but it was recorded during the production of the original attraction. Many sources claim that Buddy Baker himself performed this piece. * S√©ance Circle: Guests pass through the ominous Corridor of Doors (while the foyer organ plays again) and enter Madame Leota's S√©ance Area. A variety of instruments float through the room, including a harp, a tambourine, and a trumpet. The song's melody hums softly on an organ in the background, while the other instruments fade in and out. * Ballroom: A -long mezzanine overlooks the mansion's ballroom, which is swarming with translucent ghosts. On the far left, spirits pour from the pipes of an organ prop as \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts\\" howls through the ballroom, this time as a waltz. This piece makes use of unusual chords, including minor/major sevenths and cluster chords. Baker originally approached film organist Gaylord Carter, who had recorded the other organ tracks for the mansion, to improvise for this ballroom waltz; Carter, however, took too sensible an approach with his improvising for Baker's tastes, so Baker took a transcription of Carter's improvisations to William Sabransky. Sabransky then improvised further from the transcription of Carter's own improvisations, producing the effect Baker wanted. * Graveyard: X Atencio's lyrics are first heard in the graveyard scene. A large number of different music loops play throughout area. Most of them are ghosts singing the lyrics over a background loop that provides the 1960s style bass line and rhythm section. One of the tracks features a harp, trumpet, oboe, flute, and set of stones, which represents the band of ghosts in the graveyard. All four verses are present, with first two in A minor, the third in B‚ô≠ minor, and the fourth in B minor. This presentation of \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts\\" is by far the loudest and most noticeable in the ride. In early years of the rides history, the pop up ghosts in the graveyard would loudly scream at the end of each verse. Although the screams were later removed, the ghosts still pop up in time with the end of each verse. https://longforgottenhauntedmansion.blogspot.com/2010/05/1976-ride-through- haunted-mansion.html * Exit: Guests exit their Doombuggies and proceed through the exit crypt, which leads back up to the themed land. A final, somber a capella refrain can be faintly heard with different lyrics. One of the voice talents in the attraction is Thurl Ravenscroft, who was recognizable from other Disney projects, the annual Chuck Jones/Dr. Seuss Christmas special How The Grinch Stole Christmas and as the voice of Tony the Tiger. He leads the five \\"singing busts\\" in the graveyard scene with his characteristic voice. A projected film loop is used to animate the busts, with Ravenscroft and the other vocalists appearing as \\"themselves.\\" The Ravenscroft bust, which is the second one in from the left, is \\"broken\\" and has often been misidentified as being an image of Walt Disney himself. The other four voices of the busts are Jay Meyer, Chuck Schroeder, Verne Rowe, and Bob Ebright. A variation of this song is also used at Disney World's Magic Kingdom HalloWishes fireworks show and Disneyland's Halloween Screams fireworks show. It's also used in parades at Disneyland Paris Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland during the Halloween season. The seasonal \\"Haunted Mansion Holiday\\" overlay at the original Anaheim attraction mixes the tune with Danny Elfman's melody lines from The Nightmare Before Christmas and with Jolly Old Saint Nicholas and Jingle Bells in the graveyard. One of the most prominent instances of this is a straight orchestral statement of the \\"Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize\\" melody line that plays at the end of the cue for the stretching room. =Phantom Manor= On April 12, 1992, Phantom Manor was opened at Disneyland Park Paris. Based on the original Disneyland ride but with a new backstory tied into Frontierland, Big Thunder Mountain and Thunder Mesa, Phantom Manor featured a more coherent storyline and an all-new orchestral soundtrack by composer John Debney. Phantom Manor takes a different approach to the same concept as the Haunted Mansion attractions. The intended mood is one of corrupted elegance, rather than morbid kookiness. As a result, the soundtrack is different as well. The regular Haunted Mansion attractions feature music that is usually played or sung by characters in the scenery: an organist's waltz, a graveyard band jamboree, and so on. Phantom Manor, however, has a full orchestral soundtrack that takes a more cinematic approach, although all of the music is based on \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts.\\" A variety of instrumentations are used. At various moments, guests hear piano, organ, alto flute, a boy's choir, a jazz band, and a female voice soloist who symbolizes the character of Melanie Ravenswood, all in addition to the ordinary orchestral complement. In film When Walt Disney Pictures released a Haunted Mansion movie, composer Mark Mancina was asked to write the film's music. Like Phantom Manor's soundtrack, the movie score is orchestral and uses \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts\\" frequently. However, Mancina used \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts\\" in somewhat different ways from Debney, focusing more on relatively light-hearted background music and ominous crescendos of orchestra and organ than on waltz- like passion. Cues such as the film's overture allowed Mancina to work with both \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts\\" and a theme of his own invention. A scene in the mansion's graveyard also features the attraction's singing busts, whose musical selections include a few lines from the song. The vast majority of the film's music, though, was never officially released as a soundtrack, though copies of a complete album given to staff and orchestra members can occasionally be found for sale. Four minutes of the score did make it onto the \\"Haunted Hits\\" CD release, which groups \\"Sara Passes Out,\\" the overture, and \\"Going to Heaven\\" into one track entitled \\"Overture from The Haunted Mansion.\\" However, none of the orchestral and/or organ statements of \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts\\" are heard on this album. Other media *In the game Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour *The \\"Otherworldly Concerto\\" segment of the song can be heard in the 2015 Disney/Pixar film, Inside Out. *The song can be heard briefly in Toy Story 3: The Video Game in the Toy Box mode. In the Sid's Haunted House level, after clearing the first room, the song plays in a continuous loop until clearing the last room. *In the House of Mouse episode \\"House Ghosts\\", after Pete unleashes them in an attempt to scare the guests out of the club so that he'll be able to shut down the House of Mouse, the Hitchhiking Ghosts perform the song.

W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States. Its paint scheme is based on that of Air Force One, with lettering reading \\"George Bush 41\\". (full text available here) History UP 4141 was delivered as UP 8423 in 2005, and initially placed into service in primer paint, similar to the six heritage units before they were unveiled in their respective paint schemes. On October 18, 2005, the locomotive was officially unveiled at the George Bush Presidential Library; the road number 4141 was previously occupied by an SD70M, which has since been renumbered to 3778. The locomotive was displayed outside the Presidential Library for a while before it entered revenue service. Bush himself was allowed to operate the locomotive briefly. The unit was removed from active service in 2009 and placed in storage at UP's North Little Rock shop when traffic fell amid the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010. In 2012, the locomotive was removed from storage just long enough for a single round trip from North Little Rock to Chicago, then returned to storage. For a while, it was wrapped for long-term storage, but the wrapping was later removed. After Bush died on November 30, 2018, UP 4141 was brought out of storage and was sent to Houston, Texas, on December 1, 2018. The locomotive participated in Bush's funeral train on December 6, running from Spring to College Station, Texas. After the funeral, the unit was sent to Omaha, Nebraska, where it was displayed from December 9 to 12. UP 4141 later went on a system-wide tour, with stops in Chicago, Fort Worth, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, North Platte, Pine Bluff, North Little Rock, Ogden, Portland, Roseville, and St. Louis. Following the tour, it returned to active service, in addition to being on display in other locations. On November 8, 2019, Union Pacific donated the 4141 to the George Bush Presidential Library, where it will be on permanent display in the pavilion. The locomotive made its last run from November 8 to November 9, traveling from Houston to Palestine, Texas as part of the Southwest tour of the recently-restored Big Boy No. 4014. Following its last run, it was taken back to the North Little Rock shops, where it will be prepped for display. The George and Barbara Bush Foundation hopes to have the 4141 exhibit opened by 2020.

A few crystals have been cut and faceted, but, as the refractive index is no higher than that of quartz, they do not make very brilliant gemstones. It occurs as a secondary beryllium mineral in granitic and alkalic pegmatites. It was first described from complex crystals and as broken fragments in the disintegrated material of a granitic vein at Stoneham, Oxford County, Maine where it is associated with feldspar, smoky quartz, beryl and columbite. It was discovered by James Dwight Dana in 1888, and named beryllonite for its beryllium content. References =Sources= *Palache, C., H. Berman, and C.

The National Championship was Copeland's last collegiate game. On the season, he recorded 29 receptions for 438 yards and one touchdown. He retained duties for returning punts with 16 tries on the season. With the Volunteers, he recorded 103 receptions for 1,361 yards, for a 13.32 yards per reception average, and rushed 31 times for 145 yards and four rushing touchdowns in his collegiate career. At Tennessee, he played with quarterback Peyton Manning and running back Jamal Lewis while wearing #6 for the Vols. Professional career Copeland played a year of NFL Europe football for the Barcelona Dragons. He ended the season with a team leading 74 receptions for 821 yards, for an 11.1 yards per reception average, and six touchdowns. Copeland began his CFL career with the Montreal Alouettes in 2001 and played six games. During that season, he also starred at wide receiver with the XFL's champion Los Angeles Xtreme. He was known for his flashy big plays and the famous long skull cap tail hanging out of his helmet during his time with the XFL. After beginning the 2002 season in the Dallas Cowboys' training camp, Copeland returned to the Alouettes and contributed to their Grey Cup championship that year. Copeland picked up CFL and CFLPA all-star honours in 2003 after piling up 99 receptions and 1,757 receiving yards. Along with teammate slotback Ben Cahoon, Copeland set a CFL record for most receiving yards by two teammates, amassing 3,318 yards between them. In 2004, Copeland was one of four receivers with the Alouettes to eclipse the 1,000-yard receiving mark (the others were Cahoon, Thyron Anderson, and Kwame Cavil), a CFL record which was repeated by the Alouettes the following year. In 2005, Copeland was lured west to join the Calgary Stampeders after he entered free agency. Although his statistics did not reach the same levels as those achieved with the Alouettes, Copeland and Stampeder teammate Nik Lewis became infamous for their elaborate touchdown celebrations, including a \\"human bicycle\\" during the 2005 season, and the \\"bobsled\\" at the endzone pylon during the 2006 season. On November 23, 2008, Copeland and teammates of the Calgary Stampeders won the Grey Cup against the hosting Montreal Alouettes, 22-14. In 2009, Copeland enjoyed his best season since 2003 when he recorded 1,235 receiving yards and led the league with 12 receiving touchdowns, earning CFL all-star honours that year. On February 17, 2010, Copeland was traded to the Toronto Argonauts in exchange for wide receiver P. K. Sam. He was elected as the team's offensive captain, leading an inexperienced receiving corps and being a crutch for inexperienced CFL quarterback Cleo Lemon. With the team, he was reunited with former XFL teammate Noel Prefontaine. On November 3, 2011, he surpassed the 10,000 career receiving yards mark, becoming the 15th CFL player to reach the milestone. On January 25, 2012, Copeland officially retired from the CFL after 11 seasons in professional football.https://www.cfl.ca/article/cfl-veteran-jeremaine- copeland-retires Copeland retires, joins Ticats coaching staff Coaching career After announcing his retirement from professional football, Copeland was named the wide receivers coach of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, joining former offensive coordinator George Cortez who was the team's head coach at the time.

He taught journalism as a visiting professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Bearak won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for his penetrating accounts of poverty and war in Afghanistan. The Pulitzer Prize committee cited him \\"for his deeply affecting and illuminating coverage of daily life in war-torn Afghanistan.\\". Bearak was also a Pulitzer finalist in feature writing in 1987. On April 3, 2008, Bearak was taken into custody by Zimbabwean police as part of a crackdown on journalists covering the 2008 Zimbabwean election. He was charged with \\"falsely presenting himself as a journalist\\" in violation of the strict accreditation requirements that were imposed by the government of Robert Mugabe. Despite worldwide condemnation and court petitions that were filed immediately to release him from detention, Bearak remained in a detention cell in Harare for 5 days. On April 7, 2008 Bearak was released on bail by a Zimbabwean court. On April 16, 2008, a Zimbabwean court dismissed the charges against Bearak, saying that the state had failed to provide evidence of any crime, and ordered that Bearak and Stephen Bevan, a British freelance reporter who had also been accused of violating the country's stiff journalism laws, be released. Immediately following the court ruling, Mr. Bearak left Zimbabwe and returned to his home in Johannesburg.\\"  Biography  Bearak began his career as a general assignment reporter for the Miami Herald, where he worked from 1976 to 1982.

In 1997, he joined The New York Times, where he served as a foreign correspondent, magazine writer and sports writer. Bearak was co-bureau chief of the Times's South Asia bureau in New Delhi from 1998 to 2002. In early 2008, Bearak and his wife Celia Dugger became co-bureau chiefs of The New York Times' Johannesburg bureau. In addition to the Pulitzer Prize, Bearak has twice received the George Polk Award for foreign reporting, in 2001 \\"for his dynamic eyewitness reporting on the Taliban and his subsequent coverage of the war on terror,\\" and in 2008, along with Celia Dugger, for \\"dozens of stories that painted a vivid picture of the repression, disease and hunger that still torment the nation of Zimbabwe.\\" Bearak has additionally won the Mike Berger Award, presented by Columbia University; the James Aronson Award for Social Justice, presented by Hunter College; and the Harry Chapin Media Award, presented at the New School for Social Research. He was a 1980‚Äì1981 Michigan Journalism Fellow at the University of Michigan.\\"Past Fellows: 1981,\\" Knight-Wallace Fellows at Michigan website. Accessed Oct. 26, 2015. Bearak's story \\"Caballo Blanco's Last Run\\" is included in the collection The Best American Sportswriting 2013.  Detention in Zimbabwe  In March 2008, Bearak was assigned by the Times to cover the 2008 Zimbabwean election. On April 3, 2008, Bearak reported directly from Harare, Zimbabwe, and published a front-page story about the elections, highlighting the suspicions raised by international monitors and opposition party leaders that Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe's party has rigged the election results, amid their fears of losing the elections after 28 years in power. In the article, Bearak described Mugabe as a \\"statesman who became a ruthless autocrat to be forever remembered for murderous campaigns against his enemies.\\" On the very same day, Bearak was arrested by riot police in Harare, while staying at a hotel frequented by many Western journalists. His safety and whereabouts remained unknown during the day. New York Times Executive Editor Bill Keller pledged the Times will make every effort to ascertain Bearak's status and secure his immediate release. Zimbabwean police later released a statement claiming that Bearak was arrested for \\"practicing without accreditation.\\" Zimbabwe prohibits foreign journalists from reporting there without government approval, which is rarely granted. On April 4, 2008, Bearak was charged by the Zimbabwean police with passing himself off as an accredited journalist. However, when the Zimbabwean police realized that the press law had been changed, he was recharged with \\"falsely presenting himself as a journalist.\\" On April 5, 2008 The New York Times reported that local lawyers hired to fight the charges had gone to the attorney general's office and argued that there was no evidence to support the charge. Officials there agreed, and said Mr. Bearak should be released. However, back at the police station, the police refused to release Bearak. Beatrice Mtetwa, Bearak's lawyer, said: \\"The police advised that they had received orders from above not to release him. Obviously they got political instructions from elsewhere to hold them.\\" Bill Keller, the executive editor of the Times, condemned the arrest and the filing of charges and said Bearak was being held on charges \\"that even the government's own lawyers recognize as baseless.\\" As to the charge that Bearak had misrepresented himself as an accredited journalist, Keller called it a \\"ludicrous assertion.\\" In response to the detention of Bearak and other journalists who were arrested with him, the Committee to Protect Journalists issued a statement calling on Zimbabwean authorities to \\"stop intimidating all journalists\\" and saying, \\"It is imperative that all journalists, foreign and domestic, be allowed to freely cover the important political situation unfolding in Zimbabwe.\\" In addition, the International Press Institute, the global network of editors, media executives and leading journalists in over 120 countries, called on Zimbabwean authorities to immediately release Barry Bearak. IPI Director David Dadge issued the following statement: > The regulatory structures imposed by the Zimbabwean government have long > served primarily to silence journalists, both local and foreign, but are > particularly problematic during this vital election period. We call on > Zimbabwean authorities to promptly release Mr. Bearak, and to stop relying > on arbitrary accreditation requirements to prevent independent commentary on > the elections. On April 7, 2008, after spending four nights in a detention cell in Harare, Bearak was released on bail of Z$300 million (US$10,000 at official exchange rates; less than US$10 at black market rates) by a Zimbabwean court. He was told to reappear in court on Thursday and ordered to stay in Harare. On April 16, 2008, a Zimbabwean court dismissed the charges against Bearak. A magistrate in a court in Harare ruled that the state had failed to provide evidence of any crime, and ordered that Bearak and British journalist Stephen Bevan be released. Upon the dismissal of the charges against Bearak, The New York Times executive editor Bill Keller thanked \\"many people ‚Äî in particular some brave and honorable Zimbabweans ‚Äî who stood by Barry\\" and also mentioned \\"officials and former officials, civic leaders and journalists' organizations in many countries\\" who offered support publicly and behind the scenes.

The prosecutor, Hyatt Mograbee, asked the court to sentence Reynolds to two to three years of prison. It later became evident that Reynolds had not breached his probation due to the fact that his probation officer wasn't assigned to him during May 29 and 30.

She used 11 April 1860 on 6 Jun 1902. She used 16 July 1863 on 27 July 1888. The rule of thumb is that the earliest records are the most reliable. Biography Zeisler was born Fannie Blumenfeld on July 16, 1863, in Bielitz, Austrian Silesia, to Jewish parents. She emigrated to the United States with her family at the age of 4 in 1867. The family settled in Chicago, Illinois where they later changed their name to Bloomfield. She was the sister of Maurice Bloomfield and the aunt of Leonard Bloomfield. At the age of six, before receiving any musical instruction, she began picking out tunes on the piano. Her first teachers were in Chicago; Bernard Ziehn and Carl Wolfsohn. In 1877, Annette Essipova, then on tour in the United States, heard her play and advised that she became a pupil of Theodor Leschetizky. She made her debut at the age of 11 in February 1875. In 1878, she returned to Austria to study in Vienna, under Leschetizky. While in Austria, she changed her name from Blumenfeld to Bloomfield. She returned to Chicago in 1883. Bloomfield performed in concert in Chicago in April 1884. In January 1885, she debuted in New York City. Around the turn of the century, she made piano rolls of various piano compositions, Chopin's Waltz No. 11 in G minor being among them.Teldec CD, 8.43930 (1988)Gerhard Dangel and Hans-W.

Explanation of title The book's title was a reference to a statement made by Herbert Deane, vice dean of Graduate Faculties, in an April 1967 interview with Columbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper. Speaking about the role of students in university policy, Deane said that \\"student or faculty opinion should not in itself have any influence on the formation of administrative policy\\". \\"A university is definitely not a democratic institution,\\" he added. \\"When decisions begin to be made democratically around here, I will not be here any longer.\\" Deane concluded with what students widely mocked as \\"the strawberry statement\\": \\"Whether students vote 'yes' or 'no' on a given issue means as much to me as if they were to tell me they like strawberries.\\" Deane frequently said that he had been misunderstood on the matter. In a 1988 interview with campus radio station WKCR, he said student opinions about university policy did matter to him, but if they were offered without reasoned explanations, then they meant no more to him than if a majority of students liked strawberries.

He reigned from 859 to 873. Yizong was the eldest son of Emperor Xuanzong. After Emperor Xuanzong's death in 859, Emperor Yizong was placed on the throne by the eunuch Wang Zongshi (), who killed other eunuchs supporting another son of Emperor Xuanzong, Li Zi the Prince of Kui. According to traditional historians, Emperor Yizong did not pay much attention to governmental affairs but instead chose to live in opulence, became an alcoholic and surrounded himself with women while his government levied heavy taxes on its citizens. A deeply devout Buddhist, even more so than his father, he would hold grand Buddhist ceremonies throughout the year as well as ordering frequent musical performances in the palace. If the entertainment was to his liking, Yizong would not only reward the entertainers greatly but also bestow governmental ranks. Emperor Yizong eventually exhausted the empire's treasury that had accumulated during his father's administration. Extreme hardships, including famines that forced people to resort to cannibalism, led to widespread agrarian rebellions late in his reign. Those rebellions would plague the reign of his son Emperor Xizong and doom Tang.  Background  Li Wen was born around the new year 834, during the reign of his cousin Emperor Wenzong. His father Li Yi was then the Prince of Guang, and Li Wen was born at Li Yi's mansion. He was Li Yi's first son. His mother was Li Yi's concubine Lady Chao.  As imperial prince  In 846, after the death of Emperor Wenzong's brother and successor Emperor Wuzong, Li Yi, whose name was changed to Li Chen, became emperor (as Emperor Xuanzong). He created five of his sons, including Li Wen, imperial princes, with Li Wen carrying the title of Prince of Yun.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 248. Li Wen's mother Lady Chao was created the imperial consort rank of Meiren (),New Book of Tang, vol. 77. which was only the 15th highest rank for imperial consorts (and there could be as many as nine Meiren at any single point).New Book of Tang, vol. 76. She died sometime in the middle of Emperor Xuanzong's Dazhong era (847‚Äì860), and was posthumously created the higher rank of Zhaorong (), the sixth highest rank for imperial consorts. Li Wen was not favored by his father, whose favorite son was his younger brother Li Zi the Prince of Kui; as a result, Li Wen was sent out of the palace to live at the imperial princes' residence, known as the Sixteen Mansions, while Li Zi and four other princes lived in the palace. Emperor Xuanzong also considered creating Li Zi crown prince, but hesitated because Li Wen, not Li Zi, was his oldest son, and therefore went throughout his entire reign without designating an heir.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 249. Late in Emperor Xuanzong's reign, he came to favor certain alchemists who promised immortality, and he took pills that they made. It was said that as a result, he became paranoid and easily angered. By 859, as a side effect of those pills, he had a large ulcerous boil on his back, such that he was bedridden and could not meet with the chancellors or other officials. He entrusted Li Zi to three high-level eunuchs that he favored‚Äîthe directors of palace communications (Shumishi) Wang Guizhang () and Ma Gongru () and the director of the southern court affairs (ÂÆ£ÂæΩÂçóÈô¢‰Ωø, Xuanhui Nanyuanshi) Wang Jufang (). After Emperor Xuanzong died, Wang Guizhang, Ma, and Wang Jufang did not initially announce his death, and were set to send one of the eunuch commanders of the Shence Armies (), Wang Zongshi (), who was not on good terms with them, out of Chang'an to Huai'nan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) to serve as the eunuch monitor for Huai'nan. Wang Zongshi, however, reacted by intruding into the palace; finding that Emperor Xuanzong had already died, he arrested Wang Guizhang, Ma, and Wang Jufang for falsely issuing edicts, and then put them to death. He welcomed Li Wen to the palace, and then issued an edict in Emperor Xuanzong's name creating Li Wen crown prince and changing his name to Li Cui. The next day, Emperor Xuanzong's death was announced, and Li Cui became emperor (as Emperor Yizong).  Early reign  Emperor Yizong honored his grandmother (Emperor Xuanzong's mother) Empress Dowager Zheng as grand empress dowager, while posthumously honoring his mother Consort Chao as empress dowager. Meanwhile, long-time lead chancellor Linghu Tao was relieved of his chancellor position and replaced with the former chancellor Bai Minzhong, although Bai, when recalled to the capital Chang'an, fell and suffered an injury while he was climbing up the stairs at the imperial meeting hall, and therefore never actually assumed chancellor position before resigning in early 861. Meanwhile, Emperor Yizong was immediately met with two military crises. Tang and Nanzhao had gotten into a diplomatic row over the name of the Nanzhao king Qiulong ()‚Äîas it violated naming taboo for Emperor Yizong's ancestor Emperor Xuanzong (Li Longji). Emperor Yizong thus refused to issue an edict formally bestowing Qiulong his kingly title. Qiulong responded by changing his state's name to Dali and declaring himself emperor (thus positioning himself as an equal to Emperor Yizong) and by attacking a number of Tang outposts. Meanwhile, the agrarian rebel Qiu Fu () and his followers were overrunning Zhedong Circuit (ÊµôÊù±, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang). Qiu's rebellion was suppressed by the imperial general Wang Shi in 860, but the Dali attacks would become more intense, and Dali briefly captured the important city Yong Prefecture (ÈÇïÂ∑û, in modern Nanning, Guangxi) in 861 and then captured Jiao Prefecture (‰∫§Â∑û, in modern Hanoi, Vietnam) in 862, retaining it. Despite these crises, Emperor Yizong was said to be spending much of his time in feast and games, ignoring the affairs of state, despite his officials' urging to attend to them, although he was sending generals to the Dali front (including Kang Chengxun and Gao Pian), without initial success.  Middle reign  Over the course of 865-866, however, Gao Pian was able to defeat Dali forces and recapture Jiao Prefecture. Meanwhile, though, the tense situation on the Dali border at Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) led to a major misstep on the part of Emperor Yizong, as he was misled by the official Li Shiwang () into carving out seven border prefectures out of Xichuan into a new Dingbian Circuit (ÂÆöÈÇä, headquartered at Xi Prefecture (), in modern Chengdu) and commissioning Li Shiwang as its military governor despite the obvious impractical nature of Dingbian's territory‚Äîas Xi Prefecture was extremely close to Xichuan's capital Chengdu Municipality and unsuitable to serve as the capital for a circuit intended to concentrate on border defense. The Dingbian debacle demoralized the officers at Xichuan, who went as far as secretly encouraging Dali to attack Dingbian to expose Li Shiwang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 251. Yet more disastrous, though, was a mutiny by soldiers for Xusi Circuit (ÂæêÊ≥ó, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), who had been posted to Gui Prefecture (Ê°ÇÂ∑û, in modern Guilin, Guangxi) to defend against a potential Dali attack, with a promise that they would be allowed to return home after three years. When the term was up in 868, however, the governor of Xusi Circuit, Cui Yanzeng (), ordered that the term be extended one year, causing the Xusi soldiers to mutiny under the leadership of Pang Xun. They headed northeast home, and when they reached Xusi's capital Xu Prefecture (), they attacked and captured it. After Pang's initial attempts to obtain an imperial commission was rebuffed, the mutineer army attacked the nearby regions, with the imperial forces unable to stop them. Not until Kang Chengxun, with major assistance from the Shatuo chieftain Zhuye Chixin (who was bestowed the imperial surname of Li, as well as a new name of Guochang because of his contributions), was able to defeat Pang in 869 was the rebellion suppressed. (Subsequently, though, Kang, due to the false accusations of the chancellor Lu Yan and the imperial scholar Wei Baoheng (the husband of Emperor Yizong's favorite daughter Princess Tongchang), was exiled.)  Late reign  Meanwhile, late in 869, Li Shiwang provoked Dali by killing its emissary Yang Qiuqing (). Dali's emperor Qiulong thus launched a major attack on Dingbian, and neither Li nor his successor Dou Pang () was able to repel it. The Dali forces quickly arrived at Chengdu's vicinity and put Chengdu under siege. Emperor Yizong commissioned Gao Pian as Xichuan's military governor, and Dali forces thereafter withdrew, but both Dingbian (which was then merged back into Xichuan) and Xichuan had been deeply wounded. Princess Tongchang died in 870, and this caused a major display of Emperor Yizong's caprice at the capital Chang'an, as Emperor Yizong, in anger that the imperial physicians were not able to cure her, executed some 20 imperial physicians and had some 300 of their relatives imprisoned. When the chancellor Liu Zhan and the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the Chang'an region) Wen Zhang () tried to intercede, both were exiled; in response, Wen committed suicide. Princess Tongchang was buried in a grand ceremony that demonstrated Emperor Yizong's wastefulness. As described in the Zizhi Tongjian: Despite Princess Tongchang's death, Emperor Yizong continued to remain close to Wei Baoheng, who became extremely powerful and corrupt late in Emperor Yizong's reign. Emperor Yizong also reacted in anger whenever Consort Guo's family was accused of misconduct. In 873, in a grand ceremony, Emperor Yizong welcomed what was claimed to be a relic (a finger bone) of Gautama Buddha to the palace, despite warnings by some that his grandfather Emperor Xianzong died shortly after also welcoming the same relic to the palace. (Emperor Yizong responded to the warnings by stating, \\"As long as I can see it once while living, I do not have regrets about dying.\\") The ceremony was said to bring out great offerings by the households of Chang'an. Emperor Yizong himself walked toward the relic and bowed on the ground in tears. Later in the year, Emperor Yizong became critically ill.

The assassination was a part of Operation Nemesis, revenge plan for the Armenian Genocide orchestrated by the Ottoman Imperial Government during World War I. Talaat Pasha had been convicted and sentenced to death in absentia in the Turkish courts-martial of 1919‚Äì20, and was viewed as the main orchestrator of the genocide. After a two- day trial Tehlirian was found not guilty by the German court, and freed. Tehlirian is considered a national hero by Armenians.Vartabedian, Sarah (2007), \\"Commemoration of an Assassin: Representing the Armenian Genocide,\\" Unpublished University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Thesis, p. 7.  Life  Soghomon Tehlirian was born on April 2, 1896 in the village of (‘≤’°’£’°’º’´’≥), in the Erzurum vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. He was raised in Erzincan. Tehlirian's father left for Serbia to secure the family's planned move to the country. After his return in 1905, he was arrested and sentenced to six months imprisonment. During this time, the Tehlirian family moved from Nerkin Bagarij to Erzinjan. Tehlirian received his initial education at the Protestant elementary school in Erzinjan. After graduation at the Getronagan (Central) Lyceum of Constantinople, he went to study engineering in Serbia and had plans to continue his education in Germany.  Genocide  He was in Valjevo, Serbia, in June 1914. Tehlirian, Soghomon. ’é’•÷Ä’µ’´’∑’∏÷Ç’¥’∂’•÷Ä [Recollections], Cairo: Husaper, 1956, pp. 43-44. In the fall of that year, Tehlirian made his way to Russia and joined the army to serve in a volunteer unit on the Caucasus Front against the Turks.Tehlirian, Recollections, pp. 45-48. According to History's Great Untold Stories: Larger than Life Characters & Dramatic Events that Changed the World, In June 1915, the Ottoman local police ordered the deportation of all the Armenians in Erzinjan. Tehlirian's mother, three sisters, his sister's husband, his two brothers, and a two-year-old niece were deported. All told, Tehlirian lost 85 family members to the Armenian Genocide.Tehlirian, Recollections, p. 8. In 2016 Tehlirian's son, who spoke to The Independent but did not reveal his name, stated that Tehlirian's mother and Vasken, his older brother, died in the genocide - the latter was studying medicine and living in Beirut - but that Tehlirian did not have a sister, that his father was fighting in the war in Russia, and that his other two brothers were in Serbia. \\\\- Also posted at Horizon Weekly  Assassination of Tal√¢t Pasha  The headline of a March 16, 1921 New York Times article In 1921 he joined Operation Nemesis, a covert assassination program that would target the architects of the Armenian Genocide. Tehlirian's main target was Tal√¢t Pasha, who was a member of the military triumvirate known as the \\"Three Pashas\\" who controlled the Ottoman Empire. He was the former Minister of the Interior and Grand Vizier (an office equivalent to that of a prime minister), and was noted for his prominent role in the Armenian Genocide. As soon as he found Tal√¢t Pasha's address on 4 Hardenbergstra√üe, in the Charlottenburg district of Berlin, Tehlirian rented an apartment near his house so that he could study his everyday routine. Tehlirian shadowed Tal√¢t as he left his house on Hardenbergstra√üe on the morning of March 15, 1921. He crossed the street to view him from the opposite sidewalk, then crossed it once more to walk past him to confirm his identity. He then turned around and pointed his gun to shoot him in the nape of the neck.Bogosian, Eric. Operation Nemesis: The Assassination Plot that Avenged the Armenian Genocide. New York: Little, Brown & Company, 2015, pp. 9-13. Tal√¢t was felled with a single 9mm parabellum round from a Luger P08 pistol.Bogosian. Operation Nemesis, p. 203. The assassination took place in broad daylight and led to the German police immediately arresting Tehlirian, who had been told by his handlers, Armen Garo and Shahan Natalie, not to run from the crime scene. Trial  Tehlirian was tried for murder, but was eventually acquitted by the twelve-man jury. His trial was a rather sensationalized event at the time, taking place shortly after the establishment of the Weimar Republic, with Tehlirian being represented by three German defense attorneys, including Dr. Theodor Niemeyer, professor of law at Kiel University. Priest and Armenian Genocide survivor Grigoris Balakian, German activist Johannes Lepsius, and German commander of the Ottoman armed forces during the war General Liman von Sanders were among several of the prominent individuals called as witnesses to the trial. The trial examined not only Tehlirian's actions but also Tehlirian's conviction that Tal√¢t was the main author of the Armenian deportation and mass killings. The defense attorneys made no attempt to deny the fact that Tehlirian had killed a man, and instead focused on the influence of the Armenian Genocide on Tehlirian's mental state. Tehlirian claimed during the trial that he had been present in Erzincan in 1915 and had been deported along with his family and personally witnessed their murder. When asked by the judge if he felt any sort of guilt, Tehlirian remarked, \\"I do not consider myself guilty because my conscience is clear‚Ä¶I have killed a man. But I am not a murderer.\\" During his trial, Tehlirian claimed that while he was in Germany, he saw his mother in his dreams who scorned her son for seeing Tal√¢t Pasha and not having taken revenge yet.Vartabedian, \\"Commemoration of an Assassin.\\" During the trial, Tehlirian's dream was described as follows: It took the jury slightly over an hour to render a verdict of \\"not guilty.\\" Later life Soghomon Tehlirian monument on his grave in Ararat Cemetery in Fresno, California (1969). The monument and the cemetery's website incorrectly list his date of birth as April 15, 1896. After the assassination, Tehlirian moved to Yugoslavia and eventually married Anahit Tatikian who was also from Erzincan. She was 15 when they first met in 1917. During his days in Serbia, Tehlirian was a member of the shooting club and was considered a skilled marksman. The couple moved to Belgrade and lived there until 1950, when they moved first to Casablanca, then to Paris, and finally to San Francisco. There he worked as a postal clerk, and he lived under the name Saro Melikian. Tehlirian died in 1960 of a cerebral hemorrhage, and is buried at the Ararat Cemetery in Fresno, California. Tehlirian's monument-grave is an obelisk with a gold-plated eagle slaying a snake on top. It is reported that the original artist of the monument was quoted as saying that the eagle was \\"...the arm of justice of the Armenian people extending their wrath onto Talaat Pasha,\\" who was symbolized by the snake. The monument itself is centered in the middle of the cemetery with a walkway made of red brick surrounded by cypress trees.  Legacy  Tehlirian's bust in Gyumri, Armenia. The plaque attached to the pillar incorrectly lists his year of birth as 1886 instead of 1896. His trial for murder influenced Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin, who later reflected on the trial, \\"Why is a man punished when he kills another man? Why is the killing of a million a lesser crime than the killing of a single individual?\\"January, Brendan (2007). Genocide: Modern Crimes Against Humanity. Minneapolis: 21st Century Books, p. 24. Political theorist Hannah Arendt, in her 1963 book Eichmann in Jerusalem, compares Tehlirian to Sholom Schwartzbard, who assassinated Ukrainian statesman Symon Petliura in Paris in 1925 for what Schwartzbard believed to be Petlyura's culpability in the anti-Jewish pogroms in Ukraine. Arendt suggests that each man \\"insisted on being tried\\", in order \\"to show the world through court procedure what crimes against his people had been committed and gone unpunished.\\"Arendt, Hannah (1963). Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil. New York: Viking Press, pp. 265-66. Several statues of Tehlirian have been erected in Armenia. His first statue in Armenia was inaugurated in 1990 in the village of Mastara. In 2014, Tehlirian's story was told in a graphic novel, Special Mission: Nemesis. In 2017 a square in Marseille, France was named after him.  In popular culture ;In music The song ‘≥’´’∂’´ ’¨’´÷Å, Gini lits (\\"Pour the wine\\") is a well- known revolutionary song, which commemorates and glorifies the assassination of Talaat by Tehlirian. It has been recorded in a variety of versions and is known by heart by many Armenians. The version by Sahak Sahakyan also has a music video. The first stanza of the song goes: :The Armenians' horror shook the world, :The Turkish throne fell to the ground, :Let me tell you about the death of Talaat. :Pour the wine, dear friend, pour the wine, :Drink it nicely; drink it with delight. ;Film adaptation * The 1982 American film Assignment Berlin, directed by Hrayr Toukhanian, accurately chronicles Talaat Pasha's assassination in Berlin. * The French film Mayrig (1991) by Henri Verneuil depicts Tal√¢t's assassination and Tehlirian's trial. * Tehlirian's trial was adapted in the Turkish film ' (\\"Blood on the Wall\\"), a largely inaccurate portrayal.

The DSMC method was proposed by Prof. Graeme Bird,G. A. Bird, Molecular Gas Dynamics, Clarendon, Oxford (1976)G. A. Bird, Molecular Gas Dynamics and the Direct Simulation of Gas Flows, Claredon, Oxford (1994) Emeritus Professor of Aeronautics, University of Sydney. DSMC is a numerical method for modeling rarefied gas flows, in which the mean free path of a molecule is of the same order (or greater) than a representative physical length scale (i.e. the Knudsen number Kn is greater than 1). In supersonic and hypersonic flows rarefaction is characterized by Tsien's parameter, which is equivalent to the product of Knudsen number and Mach number (KnM) or M^2/Re, where Re is the Reynolds number.M. N. Macrossan, 'Scaling Parameters for Hypersonic Flow: Correlation of Sphere Drag Data'. In: M. S. Ivanov and A. K. Rebrov, 25th International Symposium on Rarefied Gas Dynamics, Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences, p.759 (2007). In these rarefied flows, the Navier-Stokes equations can be inaccurate. The DSMC method has been extended to model continuum flows (Kn < 1) and the results can be compared with Navier Stokes solutions. The DSMC method models fluid flows using simulation molecules which represent a large number of real molecules in a probabilistic simulation to solve the Boltzmann equation. Molecules are moved through a simulation of physical space in a realistic manner that is directly coupled to physical time such that unsteady flow characteristics can be modeled. Intermolecular collisions and molecule-surface collisions are calculated using probabilistic, phenomenological models. Common molecular models include the Hard Sphere model, the Variable Hard Sphere (VHS) model, and the Variable Soft Sphere (VSS) model. The fundamental assumption of the DSMC method is that the molecular movement and collision phases can be decoupled over time periods that are smaller than the mean collision time. Various collision models are presented in. Currently, the DSMC method has been applied to the solution of flows ranging from estimation of the Space Shuttle re-entry aerodynamics, to the modeling micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). DSMC Software Multiple implementations of the DSMC method exist: * DS1V, DS2V and DS3V are the original DSMC programs written by Prof. Bird.

Strictly speaking the ethnonym Adnyamathanha was an alternative name for the Wailpi. Adnyamathanha is also often used as the name of their traditional language, although the language is more commonly called \\"yura ngarwala\\" by Adnyamathanha people themselves (being Adnyamathanha for‚Äîloosely translated‚Äî\\"our speech\\"). Language Adnyamathanha is a member of the Thura-Yura language family and the only one which still has fluent native speakers. Country According to David Horton's map \\"Aboriginal Australia\\", the Adnyamathanha lands lie on the west banks of Lake Frome and extend south and west over the northern Ikara-Flinders Ranges National Park and northwards over the Vulkathunha-Gammon Ranges National Park. On the northern edges of the Adnyamathanha tribal lands are the Diyari lands, on the western edges are the Kokatha lands. To the south are the Barngarla, Nukunu, and Ngadjuri. To the east are the Malyangapa. In 2016 Ikara-Flinders Ranges National Park was renamed from Flinders Ranges National Park in recognition of its Adnyamathanha heritage. The word ikara means \\"meeting place\\" in Adnyamathanha language, and refers in this instance to Wilpena Pound (situated within the park), a traditional meeting place of the Adnyamathanha people. Social system The Adnyamathanha constitute an agglomeration of several peoples, the Kuyani, Wailpi, Yardliyawara, and Pilatapa (amongst others), which are traditional groups of the northern Flinders Ranges and some areas around Lake Torrens. The name Adnyamathanha means \\"rock people\\" in the Adnyamathanha language, and is a term referring to the Lakes Culture societies living in that area. They share a common identity, which they get from their ancestors; this common bond is their language and culture which is known as Yura Muda. Adnyamathanha people often refer to themselves as 'yura', and non- Aboriginal people as 'udnyu'. Mythology and astronomy The origins of the Adnyamathanha are told through creation stories, passed down from generation to generation. The primordial creator figure of the rainbow serpent is, among them, known as akurra. The Pleiades are known to them as the Makara which are seen as a group of marsupial-like women with pouches, while the Magellanic Clouds are known as Vutha Varkla which are seen as two male lawmen also known as the Vaalnapa. History of contact In 1851 the first Europeans settled some of the Adnyamathanha land. This led to many conflicts because the Adnyamathanha people were pushed off their land by the Europeans. In response to the settling, Aboriginal people stole sheep, which in turn led to retaliatory killings. Aboriginal stockmen and housekeepers soon became a way of life for the early settlers. Native title On 30 March 2009, the Adnyamathanha people were recognised by the Federal Court of Australia as having native title rights over about running east from the edge of Lake Torrens, through the northern Flinders Ranges, approaching the South Australian border with New South Wales. Notable people * Adam Goodes, four-time All-Australian AFL footballer, stated he is an Adnyamathanha and Narungga man. * Rebecca Richards, the first Aboriginal Rhodes Scholar, is an Adnyamathanha and Barngarla woman. * Regina McKenzie is an artist who, in 2006, had two pieces acquired by the National Museum of Australia of Adnyamathanha Dreaming Storylines and who, in 2016, was awarded the Peter Rawlinson award for her outstanding contribution to protection of country by the Australian Conservation Foundation. * Juanella McKenzie, artist and daughter of Regina McKenzie, had two works (containing similar storylines subject matter) acquired by the National Museum of Australia in 2008, and in early 2019 at the age of 29, Juanella was acquired into the National Museum of Scotland with a bark painting she did using traditional methods depicting women's business.Arrarru Mathari Artu Mathanha National Museums Scotland.

At the time of his retirement in 1993, he was 84th in overall House seniority, dean of the Oregon House delegation, a majority whip-at-large, and a veteran member of the House Appropriations Committee. AuCoin was a two-term member of the Oregon House of Representatives from 1971 to 1974. In his second term, he was House Majority Leader, at the age of 31. He is a full-time author, writer, lecturer and occasional blogger. AuCoin is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.https://www.issueone.org/reformers/ He and his wife Susan live in Portland. Early life AuCoin was born in Portland, Oregon, on October 21, 1942, to Francis Edgar AuCoin, a short order cook from Portland, Maine, and Alice Audrey Darrar, a waitress from Madras, Oregon. When he was four, his father abandoned the family. Les and his brother Leland moved with their mother to Redmond, Oregon, then a small Central Oregon sawmill and farming town, living on her restaurant wages and tips. AuCoin attended Redmond High School, where he was elected most valuable player on the school's basketball team. He also joined the staff of the school newspaper, where he discovered an aptitude for writing‚Äîa skill that would help propel him into journalism, Congress and, in political retirement, life as a writer. In 1960, he became the first male in his extended family to graduate from high school. AuCoin enrolled at Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon, then transferred to Portland State University. In 1961, he enlisted in the United States Army. He was assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division and the 10th Mountain Division where he served as a public information specialist, writing dispatches to The Nashville Banner, the Louisville Courier-Journal, The Nashville Tennessean, Stars and Stripes, and Army Times, among other publications. AuCoin's Army postings included Fort Ord, California; Fort Slocum, New York; Fort Campbell, Kentucky; Fort Benning, Georgia; and Sullivan Barracks, West Germany. While stationed in the segregated South, AuCoin was caught up in a near race riot in reaction to a sit-in by blacks at an all-white lunch counter, an event that crystallized his zeal for progressive politics. Following his Army career, AuCoin worked for one summer at The Redmond Spokesman newspaper, then returned to Pacific University, where he was hired as the director of the school's public information department and simultaneously completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism in 1969. He married Susan Swearingen in 1964, and the couple had two children: Stacy in 1965 and Kelly in 1967. Oregon House of Representatives In 1968, AuCoin's opposition to the Vietnam War led him to co-chair Eugene McCarthy's Presidential campaign in Oregon's Washington County, west of Portland. AuCoin stayed with McCarthy after President Lyndon B. Johnson dropped out of the race. McCarthy's upset victory over Robert F. Kennedy in the Oregon Democratic primary encouraged AuCoin to run for elective office in 1970, seeking and winning an open seat in the Oregon House of Representatives in Washington County. Two years later, he was re-elected to the 57th Oregon Legislative Assembly. The Democrats took control of the chamber and he was elected House Majority Leader, the second highest position in the House. In his time in the Oregon House, AuCoin was noted for championing environmental, consumer protection, and civil rights issues. As the Democratic floor leader, he helped pass maverick Republican Governor Tom McCall's plan (opposed by legislative Republicans and later rejected by voters) to provide 95% state funding for public schools, enacted statewide land use planning rules, reduced penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and established funding of mass transit from highway funds that had been earmarked solely for roads. AuCoin also chaired the committee that led the efforts to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. U.S. Congress In 1974, United States congressman Wendell Wyatt of Oregon's 1st congressional district announced that he would not seek a fourth term. AuCoin won a five-way Democratic primary with more than 50% of the vote and then faced Republican state public utility commissioner Diarmuid O'Scannlain in the general election. With the Watergate scandal fresh in the minds of voters, AuCoin became the first Democrat ever elected to the 1st district, winning 56% of the vote to O'Scannlain's 44%. He was subsequently re-elected eight times despite being initially targeted by the national Republican Party as \\"an easy mark.\\" After AuCoin's departure, the Republican Party continued to regard the district as one they could expect to win, though the Democratic Party has held the seat ever since. =Defense= Congressman AuCoin in 1986 In 1981, AuCoin won a seat on the House Appropriations Committee, and two years later, was appointed to the subcommittee on Defense appropriations. AuCoin became a legislative critic of weaponizing space, opposing the Strategic Defense Initiative, basing his opposition on probability theory, holding that it could not fully defend the United States in the event of an attack. He also authored a legislative ban on U.S. flight tests of anti-satellite weapons, which carried the force of law unless the president certified that the Soviet Union tested a similar weapon of its own. His amendment effectively legislated arms control for the first time through an act of Congress. AuCoin supported the nuclear freeze movement and was a leading critic of President Reagan's proposed MX missile, arguing that such \\"first strike\\" weapons would prompt the Soviet Union to match them, and, since a first strike ability favored the aggressor, reasoning that such an event would increase the vulnerability of the U.S. Although he opposed the Reagan administration on strategic weapons, AuCoin used his position on the defense subcommittee to improve U.S. conventional arms. On an inspection tour at Fort Benning, he learned from the commander of the United States Army Infantry School that replacement of the aging M47 Dragon anti-tank missile was a major infantry priority because it exposed its operator to enemy return fire until his round found its target. AuCoin, himself a former infantryman, pressed for the development of a modern substitute, often resisting the U.S. Army Missile Command and other agencies that favored other technologies. AuCoin's legislation resulted in the adoption of the FGM-148 Javelin missile, which put its homing device in the round rather than the launcher to allow its operator to fire and immediately seek cover. The Javelin was first used in the 2003 Iraq War and is considered by some military scholars to be \\"revolutionary\\" in its potential to put infantry on a more equal footing against armor in conventional land warfare.Javelin: The Potential New Beginning in Land Warfare, monogram by U.S. Army Major Dennis S. Sullivan, School of Advanced Military Studies, U.S. Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. =Foreign policy= AuCoin's opposition to U.S. support of authoritarian governments in El Salvador and Guatemala and the Nicaraguan Contras‚Äîirregular forces armed by the Reagan administration to topple the Sandinista government‚Äîled him to travel frequently to Central America to document right wing human rights abuses. In 1987, a constituent of AuCoin's named Ben Linder was killed by Contra forces while helping build a small hydroelectric electricity generator for Nicaraguan villagers. Pressed by AuCoin to investigate, the U.S. State Department noted discrepant accounts of Linder's death: the Contras asserted that Linder died in a firefight, but village witnesses claimed the Contras gave no opportunity to surrender and assassinated Linder at point-blank range. In his second congressional term, AuCoin's 1978 amendment to grant partial most favored nation trade status to the People's Republic of China was the first China trade bill to reach the House floor. Though narrowly defeated, it presaged the United States' formal normalization of political and trade relations with China less than a year later. In February 1979, AuCoin led a trade mission of Oregon business leaders to China, the first such delegation from any U.S. state. =Oregon economy= thumbThe Les AuCoin Plaza at the Washington Park MAX station.AuCoin used his seat on the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee to address a number of economic priorities throughout Oregon, including construction of the Oregon Trail Center in economically distressed Baker City, renovation of Crater Lake Lodge, restoration of the Confederated Tribes of the Grande Ronde and Confederated Tribes of Siletz, and construction of the Seafood Consumer Research Center in Astoria and the Fort Clatsop Memorial Visitors Center. Working together, AuCoin and Oregon Senator Mark Hatfield secured federal funding for the construction of Portland's acclaimed east- and west-side light rail projects, the largest public works project in Oregon history. Since its unveiling, the rail system has guided urban growth and spawned an estimated $3.5 billion in new construction in the Portland metropolitan area. For his work on the project, a plaza at one of the stations is dedicated to him. AuCoin had a hand in the rescue of Northwest lumber and plywood mills during the recession of the early 1980s. The mills faced financial ruin when federal timber sales contracts they had purchased at a face value of hundreds of millions of dollars were rendered worthless by the collapse of the lumber and plywood markets. Along with Senators Hatfield and Howard Metzenbaum, AuCoin helped write the Federal Timber Contract Payment Modification Act of 1984. After requiring timber companies to pay a penalty to the U.S. Treasury, the bill released the firms from their contracts and allowed them to return approximately 9.5 billion board feet of standing timber to the government, much of it commercially pre-thinned. =Environment= Rock Mesa in the Three Sisters Wilderness.AuCoin's environmental record earned him the endorsement of major environmental organizations in each of his House elections. In addition to blocking offshore oil exploration, AuCoin prevented mining in the center of Oregon's Three Sisters Wilderness area by buying out a mining claim in the area's geologically significant Rock Mesa and served on the committee that helped write the 200-mile offshore economic zone, which would become known as the Magnuson Act. Although the Port of Portland shipyards, a major Oregon employer, stood to benefit from oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, AuCoin opposed the plan on environmental grounds. He also helped preserve Cascade Head on the Oregon Coast, supported the Columbia Gorge Scenic Protection Act, helped stop the construction of Salt Caves Dam on the last free-flowing stretch of the Klamath River, co-authored the 1988 bill quadrupling the designation of National Wild and Scenic Rivers in Oregon, and fought the construction of a plant at the Umatilla Chemical Depot to incinerate excess chemical weapons. His work on the 1984 Oregon Wilderness Act, which doubled wilderness acreage in Oregon's federal forests, earned him a Distinguished Service award from the Sierra Club. Timber harvest controversies Soon after the decades-long effort to expand wilderness was resolved, however, annual timber harvests on Forest Service lands in Oregon and Washington reached a flash point in the late 1980s. Critics charged that AuCoin, along with other Northwest members of Congress, were forcing unsustainable logging levels, noting that Congress's proposed annual timber harvests of more than 4 billion board feet per year‚Äîwell above historical averages of 2.6 to 3 billion board feet (bbf) for the region. However, Randal O'Toole, a self-described libertarian, environmental economist, observed that the harvest numbers cited by critics included timber that had been sold, often commercially pre-thinned, returned to the government through the Timber Contract Relief Act, and therefore were inaccurately inflated. Excluding the \\"buy-back\\" volume net harvests of new \\"green\\" timber were lower than average: 2.6 billion board feet (bbf) in 1986 and 1987, 2.3 bbf in 1988, and 1.9 bbf in 1989. AuCoin was also criticized for working with Senator Hatfield, Washington Representative Norman D. Dicks, and House Speaker Tom Foley for legislating a special timber sales program in 1990. The legislation, referred to disparagingly by some environmentalists as \\"The Rider from Hell,\\" was in response to an injunction by federal judge William Lee Dwyer that shut down all logging in federal forests in the Pacific Northwest after the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management failed to develop management plans for the threatened northern spotted owl. Responding to the imminent collapse of jobs in timber and related industries, the amendment legislated a harvest, but also gave old-growth forests statutory status for the first time, directed that fragmentation of them be minimized, and banned logging of them in designated spotted owl habitat areas identified in the environmental impact statement., effectively overruling Judge Dwyer's order.Section 318, H.R. 2688 [Enrolled], 101st U.S. Congress While AuCoin and the other sponsors stated an intention for the law to be temporary while plans to protect forests and threatened species such as the spotted owl were put in place, it authorized a two-year harvest of more than 5 billion board feet in Oregon and Washington and became a precedent for future industry-supported environmental waivers long after AuCoin left Congress. In his last years in Congress, AuCoin worked to lower the regional harvest to 1.1 bbf in 1991, 0.8 bbf in 1992, and 0.6 bbf in 1993. =Abortion= AuCoin was one of the House's key leaders for abortion choice, helping to defeat the Hyde Amendment, which barred public funds for abortion services for pregnant Medicaid recipients as well as in U.S. military hospitals abroad. The amendment was dropped in the Senate when President George H. W. Bush threatened to veto the entire defense appropriation measure if it remained in. =Gun control= His opposition to gun control legislation angered many of his urban constituents while pleasing numerous rural voters. AuCoin switched his position during his legislative career, emphasized with an essay in The Washington Post, supporting what would become the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act which passed after he left office in 1993. At the time of his action, no other member of the Oregon delegation supported tighter gun control laws. 1992 race for the U.S. Senate In 1992, AuCoin ran for the United States Senate against Republican incumbent Bob Packwood, giving up his seat in the House of Representatives. Both the Democratic primary and the general election were strongly contested, and involved several controversies. As the election season got underway, analysts from both major parties predicted that Packwood would have one of the toughest seats to defend in what was anticipated to be a volatile election year. Packwood was regarded as one of the nation's \\"most powerful elected officials\\" with \\"extraordinary political instincts.\\" But the state's largest newspaper, The Oregonian, had described AuCoin (Packwood's presumed main challenger) as having \\"persistence, imagination and clout [that] have made him the most powerful congressman in Oregon and one of the most influential members from the Northwest.\\"The Oregonian, June 13, 1988. For AuCoin, however, first came the Democratic primary. He faced Portland attorney Joe Wetzel and Bend businessman Harry Lonsdale in what became a \\"brutal, bitter\\" contest. Lonsdale, who had run a close race against incumbent Mark Hatfield for Oregon's other Senate seat two years prior, emerged as AuCoin's principal rival; Wetzel, who criticized Packwood and AuCoin as long-term, ineffective members of Congress, trailed throughout the race, and was not invited to an April debate sponsored by the City Club of Portland. Lonsdale took on \\"the Les AuCoin-Mark Hatfield-Bob Packwood coalition\\" as his primary cause, stating \\"I consider Les AuCoin a good man who has been corrupted by PAC money over the years\\". In a race the Seattle Times called \\"as negative as many voters can remember,\\" Lonsdale attacked AuCoin as \\"corrupt\\" and tied to the timber industry. Lonsdale's environmental credentials also came under scrutiny, and AuCoin noted Lonsdale's reversal of support for nuclear power and belated opposition to the re-opening of Trojan Nuclear Power Plant. AuCoin turned accusations of undue influence back on Lonsdale, pointing out that his company (Bend Research) had received millions in federal defense contracts. On the Republican side, Packwood had gone through a divorce in 1991, and his ex-wife threatened to run against him amid mounting concerns about his \\"eye for the ladies.\\" The socially conservative Oregon Citizens Alliance (OCA) was at the apex of its statewide prominence with 1992's anti-gay Measure 9 and its newly formed American Heritage Party (AHP). The group endorsed Republican challenger Joe Lutz, who had run against Packwood in the past on a family values platform; but Lutz soon withdrew, announcing a divorce of his own. As early as January, the OCA considered backing former gubernatorial candidate Al Mobley as an independent or as a member of the AHP. Mobley decided in mid-August not to run, stating that he could not bear the idea that he might be responsible for causing AuCoin to be elected. Even during the primary, Packwood and AuCoin traded barbs on various issues. Packwood joined Lonsdale in criticizing AuCoin for his involvement in what was reported as a rash of check-bouncing among members of Congress; AuCoin characterized the issue as a series of mistakes, rather than gross abuses. In what was believed to be an unprecedented move, Packwood attempted to influence the Democratic primary's outcome by running television ads against AuCoin. The results of the Democratic primary were so close that an automatic recount was triggered. AuCoin held a news conference on May 23 in the South Park Blocks stating he would wait for the recount, but the margin was currently 248 votes in his favor. On June 18, over a month after the primary election, AuCoin was certified as having won by 330 votes. Upon conceding the race, Lonsdale pondered mounting a write-in campaign, reiterating that Oregon needed an \\"outsider\\" in the Senate. By the end of June, when the recount was complete, AuCoin was nearly out of campaign funds; Packwood entered the general election race with $3.2 million and was ranked sixth nationwide among senators raising funds outside their home state during the 1990‚Äì1992 election season. AuCoin opposed weakening the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to erase the northern spotted owl's impact on the timber industry, but Packwood (\\"one of the timber industry's chief allies,\\" according to Oregon State University political scientist William Lunch) assailed \\"environmental extremists\\" and introduced legislation to convene a presidential cabinet committee to exempt the endangered owl from the ESA. In September, Packwood pulled ads that had falsely criticized AuCoin for missing votes while speaking to special interest groups. By October, Packwood had raised $8 million, spending $5.4 million more than AuCoin, and leading all Senate incumbents. Yet that fall, the two candidates were in a dead heat, with Packwood continuing to criticize AuCoin on attendance, his House bank account and the spotted owl, and AuCoin echoing the campaign of popular presidential candidate Bill Clinton by accusing Packwood of favoring the wealthy over the middle class. The outcome of the bruising race was too close to call on election night, but on the following day, Packwood emerged as the winner with about 52% of the vote to AuCoin's 48%. In his victory press conference, Packwood endorsed AuCoin for Secretary of the Interior in the Clinton administration. When told of Packwood's comments, AuCoin responded by saying \\"I think that's real special.\\" Magnifying the controversy of the race was a decision by the Washington Post to delay until after the election coverage of its year-long investigation into detailed claims of sexual abuse and assault made by 10 women against Packwood. The paper published the story two months after election day. Oregon's largest daily newspaper, The Oregonian, did not break the story either, despite its own investigation and its congressional correspondent being subjected to Packwood's advances. This led to a joke, \\"If it matters to Oregonians, it's in the Washington Post (a twist on the Oregonian's slogan, \\"If it matters to Oregonians, it's in the Oregonian.\\") The paper's editor would later admit to having been less than aggressive in pursuing the story due to concerns about \\"‚Ä¶ruining a man's career.\\" A group of Oregon voters battled Packwood lawyers in briefs before the Senate Rules Committee in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the panel to refuse to seat the senator on the grounds of election fraud for lying about the abuses. The senator admitted to the acts in 1994 and was forced to resign after the Senate Ethics Committee censured him for his conduct in 1995. AuCoin was considered for Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of the Army in the new Clinton administration, though he was not offered either post. When news of Packwood's resignation broke, AuCoin stated that he would not come out of retirement to run for the seat. He also stated that he would not engage in professional lobbying, but was criticized the next year for becoming the chairman of the government relations practice group in the law firm Bogle & Gates. A decade later, Governor Ted Kulongoski nominated AuCoin for the Oregon Board of Forestry, reportedly to balance out the perceived dominance of the timber industry on that board. But the industry mounted an extensive lobbying campaign against the former congressman, accusing him of environmental extremism, and his appointment was derailed in the Oregon State Senate. Life after political office AuCoin in 2014 AuCoin went into higher education five years after leaving the Congress, joining the faculty at Southern Oregon University in Ashland as a visiting professor of political science and business ethics. He was named Outstanding Professor of the Year by the SOU chapter of Phi Kappa Phi, the nation's largest scholarly society. AuCoin was also voted by SOU students as one of the university's four \\"most popular professors.\\" While at SOU, he won an Oregon Associated Press award for political commentary at Jefferson Public Radio. AuCoin writes on national issues for the Huffington Post, freelances magazine articles, and publishes book reviews for regional newspapers. He is co-author of The Wildfire Reader: A Century of Failed Forest Policy.Island Press, 2006 In the 1960s, while working at Pacific University, he won several national awards for excellence in editing the school's official magazine.Pacific Today, Fall, 2007. AuCoin and his wife Sue campaigned in Wisconsin in 2004 for Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry for the last month of his presidential race. In 2008, they drove to Ohio to spend the last five weeks of the election cycle campaigning for Democratic nominee Barack Obama. The former congressman lectures at and serves on the advisory board to the Maxwell School's National Security Studies program at Syracuse University in New York. In 2009, Defense Secretary Robert Gates appointed him to the Transformation Advisory Group of the Pentagon's U.S. Joint Forces Command. AuCoin is a corporate director at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle and Teton Heritage Builders, Inc., a high-end residential housing contractor located in Jackson, Wyoming, and Bozeman, Montana. He has been an expert witness in federal district court on issues regarding fiduciary duties of corporate board directors, and he served as vice chair of the board of trustees of Pacific University.Pacific University Catalog, 1995‚Äì1996. In 2014, Oregon governor John Kitzhaber named AuCoin to the inaugural board of trustees of Southern Oregon University. He is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One. In 2019, AuCoin wrote a political memoir, Catch and Release: An Oregon Life in Politics, published by Oregon State University Press.

Approximately 1800 students from Defiance, Foristell, New Melle, O'Fallon, Saint Peters, Saint Charles, Weldon Spring, and Wentzville attend school at Howell. It is in the Francis Howell School District. History Founded by Francis Howell in 1881, by Lewis Howell. Francis Howell High School opened under the name of Howell Institute in Howell's Prairie. Originally, Francis Howell was a school where children could come to learn the basics of education and move up into high school. After building up the school district, the district finally became Francis Howell School Consolidated District Number 2. On September 28, 1915, the Consolidated District Number 2 school board voted to name the new high school building \\"Francis Howell High School.\\" On February 15, 1916, the new Francis Howell High School was dedicated. The current Francis Howell High School is located between Highway 94 South and Highway D. The property was originally purchased in 1949 from the United States of America under the jurisdiction of the War Assets Administration. Army barracks buildings, which were located on the property, were used by the high school for several years following until they were later demolished in 1991. Today, Francis Howell High School is a large suburban high school due to large population growth in southern St. Charles County. The original Francis Howell mascot was the \\"Dragoons\\", a horse riding soldier. Since at least 1959, they have been known as the \\"Vikings\\". Construction on a new academic building began in the summer of 2009 and was completed in 2011. The new building features a new cafeteria, media center and classrooms. Football The Vikings Football team has a storied past in Saint Charles county and under head coach Bryan Koch's 9-year tenure, the Vikings had 3 final four appearances in the last four years (2011-2014). During Koch's tenure, Howell athletes earned an estimated $2 million in scholarships. Bryan Koch resigned on February 26, 2016 and is recognized as the most successful coach in the program's history. On April 12, 2016 Francis Howell named Corey Snyder as its new head football coach. After two seasons, Cory Snyder resigned in March 2018. In April 2018, Brent Chojnack was hired as its new head football coach.

Except for the period of World War II, Sinha was the chief minister of Bihar from the time of the first Congress Ministry in 1937 until his death in 1961. Along with the Desh Ratna Rajendra PrasadLate Sri Krishna Singh. jamui.bih.nic.in and Bihar Vibhuti Anugrah Narayan Sinha (A.N. Sinha), Sinha is regarded among the 'Architects of Modern Bihar'. He also led the Dalit entry into the Baidyanath Dham temple (Vaidyanath Temple, Deoghar), which reflected his commitment towards the upliftment and social empowerment of the Dalits. He was the first chief minister in the country to abolish the zamindari system. He underwent different terms of imprisonment for a total of about eight years in British India. Sinha's mass meetings brought hordes of people to hear him. He was known as Bihar Kesari for his lionlike roars when he rose to address the masses. His close friend and eminent Gandhian Bihar Vibhuti A.N. Sinha in his essay Mere Shri Babu wrote that, \\"Since 1921, the History of Bihar has been the history of the life of Shri Babu\\". The former President of India, Pratibha Patil, released a book on the letters of exchange between Sinha and prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru titled Freedom and Beyond. The correspondence between Nehru and Sinha touches on subjects such as Indian democracy in the making in early years of Independence, Centre-State relations, role of governor, turbulence in Nepal, zamindari abolition and education scenario. Sinha was known for his scholarship and polymathy and he had given his personal collection of 17,000 books to the public library in Munger in 1959 which is now named after him as Sri Krishna Seva Sadan. Early life and family Shri Krishna Sinha was born in a Bhumihar Brahmin family on 21 October 1887 in the village of Maur, Barbigha in the Munger district of Bengal Presidency (now part of Sheikhpura district). His mother, who was also an unassuming and religious-minded person, died of plague when he was five years old. He was educated in the village school and at Zila School in Munger. In 1906 he joined Patna College, which was then an affiliate of the University of Calcutta. He obtained a master's degree from the University of Calcutta and then doctorate of law from Patna University and started practicing in Munger from 1915. In the meantime, he married and had two sons, Shivshankar and Bandishankar (more commonly known as Swaraj Babu) who later held various posts in the state government. Independence movement Shri Krishna Sinha first met Mahatma Gandhi in 1916 at Central Hindu College, Benares and later at Shah Muhammad Jubair's house in December 1920. At Munger, he vowed to work relentlessly to free India from the British rule. He gave up practising law in 1921 to take part in Gandhi's non-cooperation movement. He was arrested for the first time in 1922 at Jubair's house and Congress Seva Dal was declared illegal. For this he was known as Bihar Kesari by the people. He was released from jail in 1923 and on the day of Tulsi Jayanti performed in the play Bharat Darshan at Central School, Kharagpur. In the same year he became member of the All India Congress Committee. In 1927, Sinha became member of the Legislative Council and in 1929 became General Secretary of the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC). In 1930, he played an important role in the Namak Satyagrah at Garhpura. He suffered severe scalding injuries to his hands and chest while being arrested, was imprisoned for six months and then was again arrested and imprisoned for two years during the civil disobedience movement. He was released after the Gandhi‚ÄìIrwin Pact and again started with his nationalist work and work with the Kisan Sabha. On 9 January 1932 he was sentenced to two years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,000. He was released from Hazaribagh Jail in October 1933. He was involved in relief and rehabilitation after the 1934 Nepal‚ÄìBihar earthquake. He was the President of Munger Zila Parishad from 1934 to 1937. In 1935, he became member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly. Sinha was also the President of the BPCC in 1936 with A.N. Sinha as his deputy, a member of its working committee and in fact, Sinha and A.N. Sinha were the life and soul of the Provincial Working Committee and of the Congress organisation in the state for over thirty years. This long period of service at the help of the state is a proof not only of the great popularity and confidence which he enjoyed in the party but it symbolises also his great qualities as a co-ordinator between party and government. On 20 July 1937, he became the Premier of Bihar province when Congress came to power. Under the Government of India Act of 1935, Sinha formed his Cabinet at Patna on 20 July 1937. He and his colleague A.N. Sinha disagreed with the governor on the issue of the release of political prisoners and resigned. The then-governor had to accede to the demands for release of prisoners from Cellular Jail (Kalapani) and Bihar Tenancy Act was reformed in favour of peasants. They then resumed office. But they again resigned in 1939, as did all Congress chief ministers, over the question of involving India in the Second World War without the consent of the Indian people. Along with A.N. Sinha,the first deputy chief minister cum finance minister of Bihar, he is considered one of the makers of modern Bihar. Sinha was always interested in self-study and his ideas and speeches were noted for their wisdom. He was a staunch opponent of castes and defended the oppressed. Impressed by his courage, in 1940 Gandhi described him as \\"the first Satyagrahi\\" of Bihar while A.N. Sinha was the second. He was jailed for nine months (22 November 1940 ‚Äì 26 August 1941). When the Quit India movement started in 1942, he was arrested on 10 August. He was released in 1944 from Hazaribagh jail after he became seriously ill. In the same year his wife died at Prince of Wales Medical College. As the former chief minister of Bihar he attended the Simla Conference and also became the member of Constituent Assembly of India which framed the Constitution of India. Sinha served Bihar continuously from 1946 until his death on 31 January 1961 at the age of 73. In 1978, the Ministry of Culture established a science museum called Srikrishna Science Centre. The biggest conference hall in Patna, Shri Krishna Memorial Hall is also named after him. Political Legacy Almost all the development projects in Bihar during this period involved the leadership pair of Sinha and A.N. Sinha. It includes several river valley projects right from Koshi, Aghaur and Sakri to other such river projects. The first five-year plan period was given to the development in rural development works mainly in the agricultural sector. Bihar became the top state in the country's first five-year plan. From the second five-year plan period, Sinha brought several heavy industries like Barauni Refinery, Heavy Engineering Corporation at Ranchi, Bokaro Steel Plant, Barauni Fertiliser Plant, Barauni Thermal Power Station, Damodar Valley Corporation, Patratu Thermal Power Station, Scooter Factory in Fatuha, Pyrite Phosphate Chemical Limited and Sulphur mines at Amjhaur, Sindri Fertiliser Plant, Kargali Coal Washery, Garhara locomotive shed. He wanted to built an industrial corridor from Begusarai-Bakhtiyarpur- Fatuha, so he looked to construct Rajendra Setu in Mokama but he died before its completion. Arun Kumar says Sinha made an immense contribution in the cultural and social development of the state. He established the Rajendra Chatra Niwas at Calcutta for Bihari students, the Anugraha Narayan Sinha Institute of Social Studies (ANSISS) at Patna, Netarhat school at Ranchi, Engineering college at Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur, Jamshedpur, Sindri, Gaya, Motihari, Lok Rangshala of the Bihar Bhartiya Nritya Kala Mandir, Sanskrit College at Patna, Rabindra Parishad at Patna, the statue of Buddha at Rajgir Venu Van Vihar, as well as an orphanage at Muzaffarpur were opened by him. The then prime minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru sent Paul H. Appleby to assess the administration in states and in his famous report, he described Bihar as the best governed state in India due to the under excellent leadership of the pair of Sinha and A.N. Sinha. In a formal legal sense, the chief minister can be persuaded or forced in the interim to resign or retire by the legislature to which the Council of Ministers is collectively responsible. Sinha successfully defied a motion of no-confidence on five occasions. Sinha maintained good working relations with the secretariat officials and protected police from demoralization because police, having done away with pre- independence legacy no longer symbolised tyranny, domination, intimidation and oppression. He emphasised that in democratic India, policemen symbolised efficiency, service, protection, and help to the people. Caste played no role in promotion, transfer, posting and in working relationship of police officials with ministers or the chief minister in the fifties. S.Q. Rizvi, a retired senior Indian Police Service official, said, \\"About the qualities of head and heart of this great man, it could be summed up in three words 'Humanism, Integrity and Secularism'. Dr. Shri Krishna Sinha was a great leader and a great idealist endowed with great intellectual attainments. But what to me appeared the most prominent feature was that as a politician he had absolute integrity. A rare quality in a political leader of an area besieged with problems of caste and of low level mental make-up.\\" Sinha was a progressive leader who introduced substantive land reform legislations at the early period of Bihar's history. He favoured the growth of agricultural capitalism and he wanted to do away with the constraints and hindrances in the way of the growth of productive forces in agriculture, but some critics thought he was less enthusiastic about post-zamindari agrarian reforms. Yet, leftists grant credit to Sinha for getting the Bihar Tenancy Act passed in the early years. Justice V. R. Krishna Iyer said that Sinha was among those who were \\"heavyweights in their own right and brought into political administration a texture of nationalism, federalism, realism, and even some touch of pragmatic socialism\\", and that he \\"lived poor, died poor and identified himself with the poor.\\" The present Chief Minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, while observing Sri Babu's 124th Birth Anniversary in 2011, also attended by Sushil Modi, Jagannath Mishra, Ramashray Prasad Singh, Mahachandra Prasad Singh and others said, \\"Mr. Sinha's contributions, as the first Chief Minister of Bihar, cannot be over-stated. He was the first one to sow the seeds of progress in the state by taking series of agricultural and industrial initiative in the Bihar state but it was unfortunate that successive governments after his tenure could not capitalize on it and wasted the opportunity that landed the state in dire economic agricultural and social state and both of Sri Krishna Sinha and Anugrah Narayan Singh administrative skills are yet to be matched.\\"https://m.timesofindia.com/city/patna/CM-lays- foundation-of-engineering-college/articleshow/27761297.cms Indian National Congress Resolution on conferring Bharat Ratna to Sri Babu A unanimous resolution was also adopted to confer Bharat Ratna to Bihar Kesari Sri Babu at Sadaqat Ashram, the Congress headquarters in Patna attended by veteran party leaders like former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar, former Kerala & Nagaland Governor Nikhil Kumar, former union minister of state Shakeel Ahmad, former union minister of state K.K.Tiwary, Congress legislature party leader in the state assembly & former Speaker Sadanand Singh, and National Media Panelist Prem Chandra Mishra , and the AICC general secretary and in charge of Bihar, C. P. Joshi, among others who spoke on Shri Babu's profile and his contributions to social and economic development of the state of Bihar. They, in their turn, recalled several state and national leaders of the party cutting across religion and castes established and promoted by Sinha based on their merit. Bharatiya Janata Party on Sri Babu The Bharatiya Janata Party also organised a function to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sri Babu. The BJP functionaries who addressed the function included Rajya Sabha member and senior BJP leader C. P. Thakur, leader of opposition in the state assembly Prem Kumar and former Union minister Sanjay Paswan. The party's senior functionaries on Sunday hailed the state's first CM, Sinha, a Congress man, as the tallest leader who achieved all-round development of the state under his rule. On the 127th Birth Anniversary of Sinha in 2014, the present minister of communication (independent charge) and minister of state for railways in prime minister Narendra Modi's Cabinet, Shri Manoj Sinha praised Sinha for being a practitioner of good governance from the day he took over the reins of the state. He said, \\"Today everybody in the country and the world over has been talking about good governance. Sri Babu was its 'pratimoorti (embodiment)'\\". The minister, who is a Member of Parliament from Ghazipur in UP, surprised the audience by saying that his elder uncle had been Sinha's private secretary for five years. He said, \\"Sri Babu, earlier, was influenced by Sri Aurobindo and Surendranath Banerjee, and pledged in the Ganga at Munger to dedicate his life to the service of the country, holding a copy of the Gita in one hand and a 'kripan' in another. Later, he came under the spell of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and was considered a 'garam dal neta' like him. However, in 1916, he heard the speech of Mahatma Gandhi at Kamakhya. There he realized that this man alone could lead the struggle for country's independence. After that, he became his lifelong follower.\\" See also * List of Chief Ministers of Bihar References External links *Sri Babu & Anugrah Babu *Bihar's first exemplary government:The Sri Babu-Anugrah Babu regime *Rajendra Prasad :Letters to Sri Babu & Anugrah Babu *Shri Babu, Anugrah Babu & Rajendra Babu:Bihar's builders 1887 births 1961 deaths Indian independence activists from Bihar Indian National Congress politicians Chief Ministers of Bihar Finance Ministers of Bihar Members of the Constituent Assembly of India University of Calcutta alumni Munger district councillors People from Nawada district Members of Central Legislative Assembly of India Bihar MLAs 1952‚Äì1957 Bihar MLAs 1957‚Äì1962 Chief ministers from Indian National Congress People who died in office ","title":"Shri Krishna Sinha"},{"id":"2959879","text":"The Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education (ODCTE, commonly known and branded as CareerTech) is an agency of the state of Oklahoma located in Stillwater, Oklahoma. CareerTech oversees a statewide system of career and technology education. The system comprises 29 technology center districts and 390 comprehensive school districts. CareerTech also has skills centers that serve state correctional facilities and a juvenile detention facility. The State Board of Career and Technology Education is the governing body of the department, composed of the Oklahoma State Superintendent of Public Instruction and eight members appointed by the Governor of Oklahoma with the approval of the Oklahoma Senate. The board appoints the director of Career and Technology Education, who serves as the chief executive officer of the department and serves as a non-voting member of the state board. On February 1, 2015, Dr. Marcie Mack became the system's eighth state director. Together with the Oklahoma State Department of Education and the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, the department forms the core of Oklahoma's public education system. History The Oklahoma CareerTech System began with the passing of the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917 by President Woodrow Wilson. This act made available federal money for the promotion of vocational education. In 1929, the Division of Vocational Education was established as part of the State Department of Education. The department moved from Oklahoma City to Stillwater in 1932, and in 1941, the state legislature established the position of state director of vocational education. J.B Perky was the first director. In 1966, Oklahoma technology center school districts were formed, and in 1967, Tri County Tech became the state's first area vocational- technical school. On July 1, 1968, the Oklahoma State Board of Vocational and Technical Education was established as a separate entity from the State Department of Education. In 1971, the first delivery of training to inmates in a Skills Center at the Ouachita facility took place. On May 19, 2000, Governor of Oklahoma Frank Keating signed House Bill 2128, which officially and immediately changed its name to the Department of Career and Technology Education. Economic Impact Recent Census Bureau survey data indicate that Oklahoma workers who have completed the equivalent of a two-year program with a vocational or occupational emphasis earned 20 percent more than workers with only high school diplomas the past two decades. These income gains can in turn contribute significantly to the overall level of income statewide. Over the work life, a typical career major completer can expect to add more than $475,000, or $188,000 in current dollars, to lifetime earnings relative to completing no additional education beyond high school. In current dollars, the direct benefits are $1.84 billion in future income gains to completers, $138 million in added tax revenue to state and local government, and direct in- state spending of $185 million for the delivery of the career major instructional programs statewide. Indirect benefits include $1.66 billion in estimated spillover income gains to the broader state economy which in turn produce $124 million in tax revenue. Leadership The department is led by the state director and the CareerTech board. Dr. Marcie Mack serves as the state director. =Board of Career and Technology Education= The State Board of Career and Technology Education is a nine-member board composed of the Oklahoma superintendent of public instruction (who serves as the chairman of the board), two members of the Oklahoma State Board of Education, one member from each of the state's congressional districts and one at-large member. All members, except ex officio members, are appointed by the governor of Oklahoma and confirmed by the Oklahoma Senate. As of 2015, the chairman is Joy Hofmeister, Oklahoma superintendent of public instruction. Current members include Major General Leo J. Baxter, Bill Price, Janet Smith, Dave Stewart, Philip Kennedy, Marilyn Harrel, Randy Gilbert and Tim Burg.

He was the touring keyboardist for the Doobie Brothers from 1996 to 2015 and was featured on their 2000 release Sibling Rivalry. Biography His first record deal was signed with a band called Lodgic on A&M; Records in 1985. This band included Michael Sherwood, Billy Sherwood, Jimmy Haun and Gary Starnes. The band was discovered by the 80's group Toto and was subsequently produced by Toto members David Paich and Steve Porcaro (also credited are Greg Ladanyi and Tom Knox). Although the album Nomadic Sands failed to chart in the U.S., the first single Lonely Man was featured in the movie Prince of Bel Air, starring Mark Harmon & Kirstie Alley. In 1987, Allison was selected by Patrick Moraz to fill the second keyboardist chair for the Moody Blues, a position he held until 1990. While touring with the Moodies he was a member of World Trade signed to Polygram Records. Recording their progressive self-titled debut album in 1988, produced by Keith Olsen, this group included ex-Lodgic bandmate Billy Sherwood along with Bruce Gowdy and Mark Williams. While this band found moderate success, appearing on MTV and the Billboard Rock charts, they subsequently broke up in 1990. After the breakup of World Trade, Allison was tapped by Graham Russell to join Air Supply in the recording studio and ultimately on tour. This 7-year relationship generated 4 studio albums, 1 live album and 2 \\"best of\\" releases. Credited with co-writing 6 songs, 3 of these Allison/Russell co-compositions charted internationally. During his time with Air Supply, he and ex-World Trade bandmate, Bruce Gowdy, formed the harder edge Unruly Child with singer Mark Free. Signed by Interscope Records and produced by Beau Hill in 1991, Unruly Child, (whose members included Larry Antonino and Asia's Jay Schellen) found cult status overseas yet remained undiscovered in the U.S. After Unruly Child disbanded, Allison continued to tour with both Air Supply and Japanese artist Eikichi Yazawa. He forged a musical relationship with other Yazawa touring members, John McFee and Keith Knudsen, which led to him joining The Doobie Brothers in 1996 as a touring keyboardist. Allison co-produced the Doobies' 12th studio album, 2000's Sibling Rivalry, on which he also co-wrote three tracks. In August 2015, Allison was called to work on an album project in Japan. Bill Payne was selected to take his place as the Doobies' keyboardist for a few weeks while Allison was away. Upon his return from Japan, Allison briefly returned to the Doobie Brothers. By October 2015, Allison stepped down from his position with the Doobie Brothers after 19 years. Payne took over Allison's keyboard duties for the Doobie Brothers in December of that year.

She was a member of the Legislative Council representing South Eastern Metropolitan Region from 2006 to 2018. Following the 2014 State election, Peulich was appointed the offices of Shadow Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Shadow Minister for Scrutiny of Government, but was removed from the latter role in 2017. Biography Inga Peulich is of Bosnian heritage, being born Inga Do≈°en in Bosnia and Herzegovina and migrating to Australia in 1967 with her family. Peulich is married to small business owner Savo Peulich, and their son, Paul Peulich, is currently a member of the Kingston City Council, serving as mayor in 2013‚Äì2014. Peulich has a Bachelor of Arts and a master's degree in education. Before her election as the Liberal Member for Bentleigh in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, Peulich taught VCE English and Psychology, and was English faculty head in a large government school in the south-east region of Melbourne. She also has extensive experience in small business, which continues today through her involvement in an engineering business in the region. Peulich has been involved with many political, community and not-for-profit organisations, including: * Councillor, City of Moorabbin 1990‚Äì1993 * Director, Marriott Foundation 1999‚Äì2003 * City Chair, Salvation Army Red Shield Appeal * Chair, Moorabbin Arts Council * Past President, Victorian Parents Children in Day Care Association Inc. * Involvement with various community and sporting organisations * Commonwealth Parliamentary Association * Liberal Party of Australia. Political career In 1989, Inga Peulich joined the Moorabbin branch of the Liberal Party and a year later was elected to the Moorabbin City Council. She was a Liberal member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1992 to 2002, representing the electorate of Bentleigh. She was one of many Liberal members elected in Jeff Kennett's landslide win at the 1992 election. In 1992, Peulich expressed opposition to aspects of the proposed expansion of Westfield Southland.http://localhistory.kingston.vic.gov.au/htm/article/243.htm Peulich lost her seat at the 2002 election, but returned to parliament at the 2006 election, being elected to the Legislative Council as one of the members for South Eastern Metropolitan Region. She was re-elected to the Legislative Council in 2010 and 2014. Following a varied parliamentary committee career, Peulich was promoted to Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Education and Communities in February 2008. Following the election of the Baillieu Liberal/National Coalition at the 2010 Victorian state election, Peulich was appointed Secretary to Liberal Parliamentary Party and Coalition, and in March 2013, was promoted to Parliamentary Secretary for Education. In March 2014, Peulich became Cabinet Secretary in the Napthine Ministry. In 2017, Peulich unsuccessfully opposed the trial of a safe injecting room in Richmond, a harm- minimisation strategy modelled on the successful program in Sydney, and assisted dying or euthanasia legislation. In September 2017, Peulich was dropped from her scrutiny of government role, but retained her shadow portfolio of Multicultural Affairs. =Controversial stance on LGBT youth= Peulich has raised ire of some sections of Victorian society for her stance against initiatives such as the Safe Schools Program. In a 2017 edition of the Quarterly Essay, Peulich was cited as stating that the programme ‚Äî designed to keep gender and sexually diverse students safe ‚Äî was, \\"frightening\\", and that it cultivated in children \\"an isolation from their own families and their own values\\". = Multiculturalism = In 2007, Peulich employed race blogger Gary Anderton as an adviser. On his blog in 2004, he had published material maligning both Aborigines and his Indian doctor. At the 2006 Victorian state election he had run as the Liberal candidate for the seat of Lyndhurst. In 2007, Peulich was accused by others in the Liberal Party of being a key supporter of Ken Aldred's attempt to gain Liberal preselelction for the federal electorate of Holt. In 1995, Aldred had tabled documents in the federal parliament linking Mark Leibler, National Chairman of the Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council, to an alleged money-laundering scam run by the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad. The so-called Suriname Papers were later exposed as fakes. When told Aldred had won the Holt ballot, Liebler telephoned Treasurer Peter Costello, and the Prime Minister's office, to demand the result be overturned, and Aldred's endorsement was withdrawn. Following the defeat of the Liberal-National coalition government at the 2014 Victorian State election, Peulich was appointed to the shadow cabinet as the Shadow Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Scrutiny of Government. In 2018, Peulich labelled Victorian Greens MP Samantha Ratnam a \\"pig\\" while Ratnam was speaking in the Victorian parliament about increasing gender and cultural diversity. =Media= Following the 2010 State election, Peulich was credited with playing a significant role in winning several south-east metropolitan \\"sandbelt\\" seats to secure a narrow win for the Victorian Liberal/ National Coalition Government. In November 2012, she accused Liberal member Geoff Gledhill, and conservative fellow-traveller Tamsin Bearsley, of party disloyalty for failing to vote for her son in his mayoral bid. In January 2013, a number of articles were run in The Age newspaper, based on dubious e-mails, accusing Peulich of intervening directly on behalf of her son in his mayoral bid. However, the paper was unable to confirm the source and the authenticity of the e-mails, and acknowledged it could not be sure if Peulich sent them. Family and Personal life When not working in politics Peulich enjoys family activities, community and international affairs, sport and recreation, education and further study, and travel. Peulich's husband Savo, son Paul, and mother Nena Dosen, all ran as candidates at the 2003 election for the Glen Eira City Council.[9] In 2008, Paul was elected to the Kingston City Council. He was unanimously elected Mayor of Kingston for 2013‚Äì2014.

History Drawing musical inspirations the electro-industrial sound of Skinny Puppy and Front Line Assembly, and conceptual inspiration from the 'cyberpunk' works of William Gibson. Alongside fellow Mexican act Hocico and a collection of other similar bands (working in a loose association known as 'Corporacion'), Cenobita spent the early years of their existence performing live and recording demos. The early demos were met to a generally positive response, both in their homeland and around the world. They eventually recorded their debut studio effort 'Neo Millenio' in 1999, releasing it on the independent Mexican label Opcion Sonica. The band began to make inroads into the US market, though Omar Flo left the line-up in 2001, leaving Claus Bita as the sole member of the group. The Matrix Cube label issued their debut album in Europe during the same year, and Cenobita's first European tour followed the release of follow-up album 'Metamorphosis' in 2002.

It is required for a compiler to know certain properties of an identifier (size for memory allocation, data type for type checking, such as type signature of functions), but not other details, like the particular value it holds (in case of variables or constants) or definition (in the case of functions). This is particularly useful for one-pass compilers and separate compilation. Forward declaration is used in languages that require declaration before use; it is necessary for mutual recursion in such languages, as it is impossible to define such functions (or data structures) without a forward reference in one definition: one of the functions (respectively, data structures) must be defined first. It is also useful to allow flexible code organization, for example if one wishes to place the main body at the top, and called functions below it. In other languages forward declarations are not necessary, which generally requires instead a multi-pass compiler and for some compilation to be deferred to link time. In these cases identifiers must be defined (variables initialized, functions defined) before they are used in execution, but do not need to be defined before they are used in source code for compilation or interpretation: identifiers do not need to be immediately resolved to an existing entity. Examples A basic example in C is: void printThisInteger(int); In C and C++, the line above represents a forward declaration of a function and is the function's prototype. After processing this declaration, the compiler would allow the program code to refer to the entity \`printThisInteger\` in the rest of the program. The definition for a function must be provided somewhere (same file or other, where it would be the responsibility of the linker to correctly match references to a particular function in one or several object files with the definition, which must be unique, in another): void printThisInteger(int x) { printf(\\"%d \\", x); } Variables may have only forward declaration and lack definition. During compilation time these are initialized by language specific rules (to undefined values, 0, NULL pointers, ...). Variables that are defined in other source/object files must have a forward declaration specified with a keyword \`extern\`: int foo; //foo might be defined somewhere in this file extern int bar; //bar must be defined in some other file In Pascal and other Wirth programming languages, it is a general rule that all entities must be declared before use, and thus forward declaration is necessary for mutual recursion, for instance. In C, the same general rule applies, but with an exception for undeclared functions and incomplete types. Thus, in C it is possible (although unwise) to implement a pair of mutually recursive functions thus: int first(int x) { if (x  0) return 1; else return second(x-1); // forward reference to second } int second(int x) { if (x  0) return 0; else return first(x-1); // backward reference to first } In Pascal, the same implementation requires a forward declaration of \`second\` to precede its use in \`first\`. Without the forward declaration, the compiler will produce an error message indicating that the identifier \`second\` has been used without being declared. Classes In some object-oriented languages like C++ and Objective-C, it is sometimes necessary to forward-declare classes. This is done in situations when it is necessary to know that the name of the class is a type, but where it is unnecessary to know the structure. In C++, classes and structs can be forward-declared like this: class MyClass; struct MyStruct; In C++, classes can be forward-declared if you only need to use the pointer- to-that-class type (since all object pointers are the same size, and this is what the compiler cares about). This is especially useful inside class definitions, e.g. if a class contains a member that is a pointer (or a reference) to another class. Forward-declaration is used to avoid unnecessary coupling which help reducing compilation time by reducing the number of header inclusion. This has a triple advantage: * reduce the number of files opened by #include (hence the number of operating system calls) * reducing the volume of the pre-processed files (as the header is not included) * reducing recompilation impact when the forward declared class is modified. Forward declaration of a class is not sufficient if you need to use the actual class type, for example, if you have a member whose type is that class directly (not a pointer), or if you need to use it as a base class, or if you need to use the methods of the class in a method. In Objective-C, classes and protocols can be forward-declared like this: @class MyClass; @protocol MyProtocol; In Objective-C, classes and protocols can be forward-declared if you only need to use them as part of an object pointer type, e.g. or . This is especially useful inside class definitions, e.g. if a class contains a member that is a pointer to another class; to avoid circular references (i.e. that class might also contain a member that is a pointer to this class), we simply forward- declare the classes instead. Forward declaration of a class or protocol is not sufficient if you need to subclass that class or implement that protocol. Forward reference The term forward reference is sometimes used as a synonym of forward declaration.MSDN: Converting to a Forward-Reference Class Type However, more often it is taken to refer to the actual use of an entity before any declaration; that is, the first reference to \`second\` in the code above is a forward reference.http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fischer/cs536.s07/lectures/Lecture25.4up.pdfThinking in C++: Inlines & the compiler Thus, we may say that because forward declarations are mandatory in Pascal, forward references are prohibited. An example of (valid) forward reference in C++: class C { public: void mutator(int x) { myValue = x; } int accessor() const { return myValue; } private: int myValue; }; In this example, there are two references to \`myValue\` before it is declared. C++ generally prohibits forward references, but they are allowed in the special case of class members. Since the member function \`accessor\` cannot be compiled until the compiler knows the type of the member variable \`myValue\`, it is the compiler's responsibility to remember the definition of \`accessor\` until it sees \`myValue\`'s declaration. Permitting forward references can greatly increase the complexity and memory requirements of a compiler, and generally prevents the compiler from being implemented in one pass.

It is also known as UnicoWS ( _Unico_ de for _W_ indows 95/98/Me _S_ ystems) or \`UNICOWS.DLL\`, or even \\"cows\\". Microsoft describes it as providing \\"a layer over the Win32 API on Windows 95/98/Me so that you can write a single Unicode version of your application and have it run properly on all platforms.\\" Previously, software developers had to either provide two separate versions of an application, or perform complex string translations and API decisions at runtime. Availability The MSLU was announced in March 2001, and first available in the July 2001 edition of Microsoft's Platform SDK, which is arguably long after the peak popularity of Windows 95/98/Me. It had a codename of Godot, which is a reference to the play Waiting for Godot (centered around the failure of a man named \\"Godot\\" to appear and the endless wait for him), because it was felt to be long overdue. How it works Normally, the Windows API provides both A (ANSI) and W (wide- character) versions of most functions. On Windows 95/98/Me, only the A versions are implemented and attempting to call a W version will fail with an error code that indicates that the function is unimplemented. On the Windows NT line of operating systems, both the A and W versions are implemented (however, the operating system generally only internally implements the W version natively, and the A version is usually a translation thunk to the W version). By adding the \`UNICOWS.LIB\` to the link command-line before \`KERNEL32.LIB\`, \`ADVAPI32.LIB\`, or any other supported Win32 system link library, the linker will resolve referenced symbols with the one provided by \`UNICOWS.LIB\` instead. When a wide-character function is called for the first time at runtime, the function stub in \`UNICOWS.LIB\` first receives control and checks if it is running on a Windows 95/98/Me system: * If so, it dynamically loads \`UNICOWS.DLL\` (if it hasn't been loaded yet) and passes control to the corresponding thunking stub in there. The thunking stub translates the wide- character arguments into ANSI strings and then invokes the native A version from the OS, and then translates any returned strings back into wide-character format. * If the OS natively supports the W version (i.e. the Windows NT line of operating systems), then the function stub updates the in-memory import table so that future calls will directly invoke the native W version without any more overhead. Because of this technique, when an application is linked against MSLU, only Windows 95/98/Me systems will need the \`UNICOWS.DLL\` at runtime, and on all other versions of Windows there is only a slight performance penalty for the first function call. A common problem encountered occurs when some updaters and uninstallers rename or delete the file \`OLEDLG.DLL\`, preventing the operating system from loading \`UNICOWS.DLL\`. This results in applications, such as OpenOffice.org, reporting that \\"Application cannot start because one of the required libraries cannot be found.\\" This occurs even if \`UNICOWS.DLL\` is installed in the system.

He also served as president of Xiamen University in China from 1921 to 1937. Beginning Life Lim was born as the third generation of a Peranakan family in Penang, Straits Settlements, with ancestry from Haicheng Town, Longhai City, Fujian Province. He moved to Singapore with his father, Lim Thean Geow (), and the rest of his family when he was young. He studied at Raffles Institution in Singapore. However, the death of his parents during his childhood inspired him to pursue a career in medicine. In 1887, Lim became the first Malayan to receive a Queen's Scholarship. He gained admission to the University of Edinburgh and graduated in 1892 with a first class honours degree in medicine. Career In 1895, Lim became a member of the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements in Singapore. The following year, he headed a Commission of Inquiry into the sources of poverty in Singapore. He was also a Justice of the Peace and a member of the Chinese Advisory Board. Lim founded the Philomatic society and published the first Chinese-language magazine in the Straits Settlements in 1897 with Song Ong Siang. They were later joined by Dr Wu Lien-teh as a fellow editor. In the same year, he also campaigned against the wearing of queues among Chinese men, with the intention of toppling the Qing dynasty in China. In 1898, Lim co-founded the Tian Nan Xin Bao (Â§©ÂçóÊñ∞Êä•) with Khoo Sook Yuen. In 1899, Lim co-founded the Singapore Chinese Girls' School (SCGS) with his friend, Song Ong Siang, to facilitate the education of Chinese women living in the Straits Settlements. (Chinese girls were not encouraged to be educated before the 20th century, thus many were illiterate.) The next year, Lim founded the Straits Chinese British Association, and later became its president. As a member of the Legislative Council, Lim wanted opium banned so he formed the Anti-Opium Society. However, opium was not banned until 1943 during the Japanese occupation of Singapore. The British reasoned that imposing a ban on opium would mean that the government would lose a source of income from the tax on opium. To make up for the loss, the British governor suggested taxing the people's incomes. The main group that would be affected by this tax would be the merchants. Therefore, the European and Asian merchants opposed to this, and opium was not banned, although heavier taxes on opium were imposed. Lim was created an officer of the Order of the British Empire on 12 March 1918 (backdated to 1 January 1918) for his services as an Unofficial Member of the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements. Together with Lim Nee Soon, Lim co-founded OAC Insurance in 1920. OAC was the first locally owned insurance company to be set up in Singapore. The following year in June, upon the request of Sun Yat-sen, Lim served as the second president of Xiamen University, until the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in July 1937. The university was founded by Lim's friend, Tan Kah Kee. Lim later went into banking, and co-founded the Oversea- Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC). As the president of Xiamen University, Lim published his own English translation of the Chinese poem Li Sao, also known as An Elegy on Encountering Sorrows. In 1937, Lim founded the Straits Chinese China Relief Fund Committee of Singapore to support China in its war efforts against Japan during the Second Sino-Japanese War. President of OCA In 1942, Lim's family were interned at a Japanese concentration camp at Arab Street. Lim was asked by the Japanese to become the leader of the Overseas Chinese Association (OCA). In response, Lim refused, claiming that he was too old to take up the role of a president. Lim's wife was then made to kneel down under the scorching sun for four hours at a stretch, in addition to bearing other insults. After Shinozaki let him drink beer and persuaded him, telling him that Lim's position as president was merely to be a figurehead without needing to do much work, Lim finally relented. In March 1942, Lim was ordered by the Japanese to raise a \\"donation\\" of 50 million straits dollars for Japan. However, only 28 million dollars were raised with much difficulty. In response to the anger of Takase, Lim made an emotional speech: > \\"We never told a lie. When we promised to give the military contribution, we > mean to do it. Financial conditions are now such as to be beyond our > control. If we are unable to pay, then die we will. I wish to point out, > however, that the manner in which the Government raise this military > contribution is without any parallel in any country.\\" In the end, the Japanese agreed to a loan for the remaining sum through the Yokohama Specie Bank. Known as the grand old man of the Singaporean Chinese community, during the Japanese occupation, Lim feigned a drunken stupor rather than cooperate with the Japanese. Later life Lim led his remaining years in recluse in Singapore as an ordinary citizen. He died on 1 January 1957, two months after his 88th birthday. and was buried at Bidadari Cemetery in Singapore. Family Lim married twice. His first marriage was to Margaret Huang (), the eldest daughter of Sibu pioneer Wong Nai Siong, in 1896 at a Presbyterian church. They had four sons: Robert Kho-Seng, Francis Kho-Beng, Walter Kho-Leng, and John Kho-Liau. Lim's wife died in 1905. Lim remarried in 1908, to Grace Yin () the sister of Dr. S.C. Yin(who was the father of Leslie Charteris,famous for his \\"The Saint\\"), with whom he shared a medical practice. They had one son, Peng Han, who later became a race car driver and the first Chinese person to race in Brooklands in the United Kingdom. They also had a daughter, Ena Guat-Kheng. Lim also had another son, Peng Thiam, with Chui Geok, the niece of his second wife. Legacy The area now known as Boon Keng, including Boon Keng MRT station, Boon Keng Road and Upper Boon Keng Road are named after Lim.

It is named after Fran√ßois Fillon, the Minister of Education at the time. Aims of the law * Introduction of a core knowledge for certain subjects. This includes French, mathematics, a foreign language, humanistic and scientific culture, communication and information. This excludes arts subjects from its core knowledge. * Three hours of support for the teachers * Abolition of travaux personnels encadr√©s, guided personal projects combining various subjects, research and free study Public reaction The new law was met with significant backlash from students. On 5 February 2005, hundreds of thousands of students demonstrated against the law by refusing to go to school or by marching. Notable players in the protests were Samuel Morville and Pauline Salingue, who were to be arrested.

Some of them are common to the point of being considered vermin while others are exceedingly rare. Many species are known from just a few zoological specimens in museums collected in the 19th and 20th centuries. Many of the carnivores and larger mammals are restricted in their distribution to forests in protected areas, while others live within cities in the close proximity of humans. They range in size from the Eurasian pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus) to the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). They include nocturnal small mammals endemic to India such as the Malabar large-spotted civet (Viverra civettina). While the status of many of these species is unknown, some are definitely extinct. Populations of many carnivores are threatened. The tiger (Panthera tigris), dhole (Cuon alpinus), Malabar large-spotted civet (Viverra civettina) and Himalayan wolf (Canis lupus chanco) are some of the most endangered carnivore species. Two rhinoceros species are extinct within the Indian region but the remaining species has its last stronghold within India.

History  Port Alfred was established in the early 1820s by British settlers who were moved into the area by Lord Charles Somerset as there was conflict between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa people. Originally, it was two separate towns (settlers arriving on the west bank in 1820 named their settlement Port Kowie, and those arriving on the east bank named theirs Port Franceshttp://home.intekom.com/african_lioness/history~.html). In 1860, when Queen Victoria's son Prince Alfred visited, the name was changed in his honour. = Port = In 1839, William Cock and George Hodgkinson started to block the natural river mouth to the east and canalise the present opening to the sea. By 1841 South Africa's first man-made harbour was opened after completion of the stone lined channel between the ocean and the Kowie river. This allowed high-masted sailing ships with their heavy cargo to dock at the wharf.  Transport  Port Alfred is located on the junction of the R67 and R72 roads. The R67 connects Port Alfred with the N2 at Makhanda to the north, while the R72 joins the N2 near Colchester to the west and follows the coast to East London in the east.  Education  Educational establishments based in Port Alfred include Stenden South Africa (a subsidiary campus of Stenden University in the Netherlands), a private Christian school (El Shaddai Christian Academy), the biggest flying training school in the Southern Hemishpere (43 Air School), Mtyhobo Primary School, Dambuza Primary School, Nomzamo High School,Kuyasa Combined School and Port Alfred High School.

Although catching the ball is also found in other codes of football, along with kicking the ball, it is one of the most prevalent skills in Australian football. Marking can also be one of the most spectacular and distinctive aspects of the game, and the best mark of the AFL season is awarded with the Mark of the Year, with similar competitions running across smaller leagues. The top markers in the Australian Football League, like Jason Dunstall and Jonathan Brown took an average of over eight marks per game.Player statistics An AFL match between St Kilda and Port Adelaide in 2006 set a record of 303 marks in a single game. Rules Upon taking a mark, the umpire will blow the whistle to signify the mark and a player is entitled to an unimpeded kick of the ball, to advance their team towards their goalposts. The nearest opposition player stands on the spot where the player marked the ball, which is also known as the mark and becomes the man on the mark. When taking the set kick, the player must either play on or kick the ball over the mark. The criterion for a mark is that it be caught cleanly, i.e. the player have complete control of the ball, for any length of time. As such, if the ball is caught in one grab, and then punched out from between the player's hands, a mark is paid, even if they have held it for only an instant. Similarly, if a ball is controlled, and then dislodged by another player or the ground, the mark will still be paid. Although the rules make no provision for two players marking the ball simultaneously, by convention the umpire will award the mark to the man in front, i.e. the player who has the front position in the marking contest; if he cannot determine which player is in front, then a ball-up will result. The mark has been included in the compromise rules used in the International Rules Football series between teams from Australia and Ireland since 1984.  Origins of the mark  Various forms of football descended from English public school football games of the 19th century have featured a fair catch. It was abolished early in the development of soccer but still exists in rugby union and American football. The mark has been one of the most distinctive features of Australian football since rules were drawn up in 1859. Some people claim that the origin of the term mark comes from the practice of a player who has just taken a fair catch physically marking the ground with his/her foot (cf. rugby union, in which a mark is awarded only if audibly called for; it was also formerly a requirement to make such a mark but this is no longer the case), or cap which formed part of the attire worn by players in the 19th century, to show where he took the fair catch. Others claim that the origin of the mark comes from the traditional Aboriginal game of Marn Grook, which is said to possibly have influenced Tom Wills' writing of the laws of the game.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-14/afl-latest-stance- proves-history-of-aussie-rules-is-in-debate/11202802 It is claimed that in Marn Grook, jumping to catch the ball, called \\"mumarki\\", an Aboriginal word meaning \\"to catch\\", results in a free kick. Some counterclaim this theory as false etymology.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-14/afl-latest-stance- proves-history-of-aussie-rules-is-in-debate/11202802  Types of marks  An Irish player takes an overhead pack mark in the 2008 AFL International Cup Robert Eddy of St Kilda positions himself for the difficult \\"out in front\\" mark 220px In Australian football, marks are often described in combination of the following ways. * Overhead mark: catching the ball with hands extended above the head[Overhead mark http://www.aflcommunityclub.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Coach_AFL/DrillsSkills_and_Tactics/Coaching_Tips/How_to_Play/AR10_How_to_play_Pt3_Overhead_Mark.pdf] * Contested mark: catching the ball against one or more opponents who are attempting to also mark or spoil the player attempting the mark. This skill is declining in the professional game due to coaches discouraging preferring to avoid contests.Contested Marking Fundamentals Anthony Rocca * Pack mark: catching the ball against one or more opponents and/or teammates all close to the fall of the ball.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-02/from-naitanui-to- howe-to-moorcroft3a-the-afl27s-best-high-fly/6513440 * High mark: catching the ball whilst jumping up in the air. Stewart \\"Buckets\\" Loewe, Matthew Richardson and Simon Madden are notable exponents of the high mark. * Spectacular mark: sometimes nicknamed 'specky', 'screamer' or 'hanger', this term is most often used when a mark taken (sometimes contested) whilst jumping in the air. Additional elevation is achieved by using the legs to spring off the back or shoulders of one or more opponents and/or teammates. The movement of other players beneath the player marking can cause them to lose balance in mid air and land or fall awkwardly, enhancing the spectacle of the mark. The name reflects its popularity among spectators. * Chest mark: catching the ball and drawing it in to the chest. This is considered the easiest mark to take, and is often used in wet weather. At professional level this skill is discouraged by coaches due to it giving opponents a much better chance of intercepting the ball from most directions. * Out in front: catching the ball with arms extended forward from the body. This skill is extremely difficult, particularly with the ball travelling low and at high speeds. At professional level this skill is preferred by coaches, as it gives opponents less chance of spoiling from behind, and if the ball spills, it will be \\"front and centre\\" of the player, which makes it much easier for rovers to predict and to execute game strategy. * One-handed mark: catching the ball with only one hand. Rarely used in a contested situation where one player's arm is impeded by an opponent (which is typically a free kick anyway), or where the player uses upper body strength to physically fend off their opponent. While spectacular, this skill is discouraged by coaches due to a low percentage of success and is sometimes seen as \\"showing off\\" or \\"lairising\\". * Diving mark: leaping horizontally to catch the ball before it hits the ground. * With the flight of the ball: a mark taken running in the direction that the ball is travelling. In order to do this, the player must take their eyes off opposition players sometimes running at fast pace in the opposite direction. This type of mark is often branded \\"courageous\\", because in attempting the mark, the player must ignore the danger of a high speed collision with oncoming players. Wayne Carey and Jonathan Brown were known for their ability to take courageous marks. * Standing one's ground: a mark taken by a player who is standing still. These are particularly difficult, because the player must wait in a stationary position, making it much easier for moving opponents to make better position. There is also a higher risk of collision with incoming players, meaning it requires courage. * Backing into a pack: a mark taken by a player who is running or jogging backwards while facing the ball. These are particularly dangerous with an extremely high risk of collision from behind by players running at the ball at high speed. It is also difficult to keep eyes on the ball whilst expecting a high collision from behind. * Half volley: technically not a mark. Sometimes players catch the ball so close to the ground that it is difficult to tell whether it hit or bounced off the ground. Sometimes a player is awarded a mark by an umpires benefit of the doubt. * Juggled mark: when a player takes two or more touches of the ball to claim the mark. The player must appear to have had control of the ball to be awarded the mark. Importantly, the mark must be completed within the field of play to be paid as a mark; it should not be paid if the first touch was inside the boundary line, but the last outside. *An uncontested overhead mark taken by a player in a suburban western Sydney AFL game between the East Coast Eagles AFC and Campbelltown Kangaroos AFCFingertip mark: when the player is only barely able to hold the ball with his/her fingers at full stretch. This type of mark carries a high risk of injury to fingers. * Slips catch: a fingertip mark taken low to the ground, with terminology borrowed directly from cricket.  Famous marks  While the Mark of the Year competition has produced many famous marks, other marks include: In the 1970 Grand Final before a record crowd of 121,696, Carlton full forward, and giant of the game, Alex Jesaulenko, took one of the most inspirational marks in the history of 'the Australian game' leaping high for a specky over Collingwood's Graeme Jenkin just before half time, to help inspire a Carlton side that was behind by 44 points at the half. Sydney's Leo Barry leapt into history with his match- saving mark in the final seconds of the 2005 grand final against the West Coast Eagles to seal the game. His contested overhead mark was taken in a congested pack of 3 teammates and 3 opposition players. Shaun Smith's and Gary Ablett's shared title of Mark of the Century. St Kilda/South Melbourne player Roy Cazaly was renowned for his high marks, giving rise to the catchphrase and song \\"Up There Cazaly\\".  Spoiling the mark  Spoiling is the technique typically employed by opposition defenders to legally stop a player from catching the ball. Spoiling is performed by hand or fist (as a punching action) either before or shortly after the player has caught the ball in their hands. The rules are quite strict on defensive spoiling methods. Players are not allowed to push other players out of marking contests or make forceful front on contact with an opponent in a marking contest, if they are not simultaneously attempting to mark or spoil the ball. Also, no high contact is allowed unless such contact is incidental to attempting to mark or spoil the ball. =Taking the arms= Deliberately taking, hacking or chopping the arms is an infringement committed by defenders which will result in a free kick. The arm interference free kick was introduced as a specific free kick in the AFL and its affiliates in 2005, although it was paid as a blocking, striking or holding free kick previously. The free kick was designed predominately to make it easier for forwards to take contested marks by not allowing defending player to punch or pull a marking player's outstretched arms in a marking contest. The rule was introduced by the AFL amidst on-going calls from fans and commentators to take action against the defensive tactic of flooding; the rule does directly limit the effectiveness of defenders, but the AFL has never stated whether or not flooding was the reason for the change. Marking- related injuries Marking can cause injuries to hands and fingers, including hyperextension, joint and tendon damage, dislocation and fractures. Over a long period of time and with re-injury there can be long-term effects such as chronic injury and debilitating arthritis. To overcome these injuries, some players will strap problem fingers together, whole hands, wear splints or gloves. Some of these injuries require surgery and extended recovery, threatening professional careers. AFL players whose careers were threatened by such injuries include Robert Campbell, Fraser Gehrig, Brett Backwell and Daniel Chick. Some players, such as Backwell and Chick, have opted for amputation of digits in a bid to extend their playing careers and continue to mark the ball.

There are separate men's and women's races, with many colleges entering more than one crew. The regatta is organized by Christ Church Boat Club. Course The regatta is held on the Isis, the stretch of the River Thames running through Oxford, in Christ Church Meadow (the park in Oxford belonging to Christ Church). The stretch of the river that is used is generally familiar to novice crews as the stretch where they train. The course is only between about 500 and 750 metres long, from a part of the river between \\"Longbridges\\" and the start of the boathouse island to a finish line near the Head of the River pub by Folly Bridge. Racing The competition is run over about four days in total, usually from Wednesday of 7th week in Michaelmas Term to Saturday of 7th Week. Races are head-on-head between two teams that are chosen at random. The winner of the race will progress to the next round of races. The loser may be knocked out so that they no longer race. However, the loser of a first round race will enter the repechage, meaning that they have the chance to stay in the competition. The knock-out rounds of the competition proceed until two teams are left to race against each other in the Final. Problems A regatta of novice crews has potential problems. During the course of the regatta, several races have to be stopped once they have started due to novice crews becoming stranded within the racing lanes. Also, at this time in Michaelmas Term, weather is often not especially agreeable. It is generally quite cold and often raining, with the result that the river can be higher and faster than is perhaps ideal. The regatta in 2006 had to be cancelled two days in because of the river's condition. The entire regatta was cancelled in 2000 and 2007 for the same reason. In 2012, some crews did get out for the first day but rapid stream and weather changes forced a cancellation of the regatta.. The regatta was once again cancelled in 2019 due to high river conditions. In 2020, the regatta was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, marking the first time in recent history the regatta was fully cancelled two years in a row.

Biography Entering the church at an early age, he was rapidly advanced until in 1313 he was made bishop of Beauvais. During the next twenty years he was one of the most notable of the members of the French episcopate, and was particularly in favour with King Philip VI. He devoted himself in 1335 to the completion of the choir of Beauvais Cathedral, the enormous windows of which were filled with the richest glass. But this building activity, which has left one of the most notable Gothic monuments in Europe, was broken into by the Hundred Years' War. Jean de Marigny, a successful administrator and man of affairs rather than a saintly churchman, was made one of the king's lieutenants in southern France in 1341 against the English invasion. His most important military operation, however, was when in 1346 he successfully held out in Beauvais against a siege by the English, who had overrun the country up to the walls of the city. Created archbishop of Rouen in 1347 as a reward for this defence, he enjoyed his new honours only three years. In fiction Marigny is a major character in Les Rois maudits (The Accursed Kings), a series of historical novels by Maurice Druon, which were adapted into two French television miniseries in 1972 and 2005. He was portrayed by Ren√© Roussel in 1972 and by Michel Hermon in 2005.

In bogs, wet heaths and damp coniferous woodland, E. tetralix can become a dominant part of the flora. It has also been introduced to parts of North America.http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/di/erica/erica/erictetv.jpg  Description  It is a perennial subshrub with small pink bell-shaped drooping flowers borne in compact clusters at the ends of its shoots, and leaves in whorls of four (whence the name). The flowers appear in summer and autumn. The distinction between E. tetralix and the related species Erica cinerea is that the linear leaves are usually glandular and in whorls of four, while those of Erica cinerea are glabrous and borne in whorls of three. The leaves of Calluna vulgaris are much smaller and scale-like and borne in opposite and decussate pairs.Clive Stace (2010) New Flora of the British Isles, 3rd edition. Cambridge University Press. The sticky, adhesive glands on leaves, sepals and other parts of the plant prompted Charles Darwin to suggest that this species might be a protocarnivorous plant, but little, if any, research has been done on this.Darwin, Charles. (1875). Insectivorous Plants. London: J. Murray.  Uses  In cultivation, like other heathers, E. tetralix requires an acidic soil, as it is a calcifuge. Numerous cultivars have been developed for garden use, of which E. tetralix f. alba 'Alba Mollis' (a white-flowered variety) and E. tetralix 'Pink Star' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

If the field is not mentioned, the field of rational numbers is generally understood. If the field is the field of real numbers, a rational point is more commonly called a real point. Understanding rational points is a central goal of number theory and Diophantine geometry. For example, Fermat's Last theorem may be restated as: for , the Fermat curve of equation x^n+y^n=1 has no other rational point than , , and, if is even, and . Definition Given a field k, and an algebraically closed extension K of k, an affine variety X over k is the set of common zeros in K^n of a collection of polynomials with coefficients in k: :f_1(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n)=0,\\\\ldots, f_r(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n)=0. These common zeros are called the points of X. A k-rational point (or k-point) of X is a point of X that belongs to kn, that is, a sequence (a1,...,an) of n elements of k such that fj(a1,...,an) = 0 for all j. The set of k-rational points of X is often denoted X(k). Sometimes, when the field k is understood, or when k is the field Q of rational numbers, one says \\"rational point\\" instead of \\"k-rational point\\". For example, the rational points of the unit circle of equation :x^2+y^2=1 are the pairs of rational numbers :\\\\left(\\\\frac ac, \\\\frac bc\\\\right), where (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triple. The concept also makes sense in more general settings. A projective variety X in projective space Pn over a field k can be defined by a collection of homogeneous polynomial equations in variables x0,...,xn. A k-point of Pn, written [a0,...,an], is given by a sequence of n+1 elements of k, not all zero, with the understanding that multiplying all of a0,...an by the same nonzero element of k gives the same point in projective space. Then a k-point of X means a k-point of Pn at which the given polynomials vanish. More generally, let X be a scheme over a field k. This means that a morphism of schemes f: X ‚Üí Spec(k) is given. Then a k-point of X means a section of this morphism, that is, a morphism a: Spec(k) ‚Üí X such that the composition fa is the identity on Spec(k). This agrees with the previous definitions when X is an affine or projective variety (viewed as a scheme over k). When X is a variety over an algebraically closed field k, much of the structure of X is determined by its set X(k) of k-rational points. For a general field k, however, X(k) gives only partial information about X. In particular, for a variety X over a field k and any field extension E of k, X also determines the set X(E) of E-rational points of X, meaning the set of solutions of the equations defining X with values in E. Example: Let X be the conic curve x2 \\\\+ y2 = ‚àí1 in the affine plane A2 over the real numbers R. Then the set of real points X(R) is empty, because the square of any real number is nonnegative. On the other hand, in the terminology of algebraic geometry, the algebraic variety X over R is not empty, because the set of complex points X(C) is not empty. More generally, for a scheme X over a commutative ring R and any commutative R-algebra S, the set X(S) of S-points of X means the set of morphisms Spec(S) ‚Üí X over Spec(R). The scheme X is determined up to isomorphism by the functor S ‚Ü¶ X(S); this is the philosophy of identifying a scheme with its functor of points. Another formulation is that the scheme X over R determines a scheme XS over S by base change, and the S-points of X (over R) can be identified with the S-points of XS (over S). The theory of Diophantine equations traditionally meant the study of integral points, meaning solutions of polynomial equations in the integers Z rather than the rationals Q. For homogeneous polynomial equations such as x3 \\\\+ y3 = z3, the two problems are essentially equivalent, since every rational point can be scaled to become an integral point. Rational points on curves Much of number theory can be viewed as the study of rational points of algebraic varieties, a convenient setting being smooth projective varieties. For smooth projective curves, the behavior of rational points depends strongly on the genus of the curve. =Genus 0= Every smooth projective curve X of genus zero over a field k is isomorphic to a conic (degree 2) curve in P2. If X has a k-rational point, then it is isomorphic to P1 over k, and so its k-rational points are completely understood.Hindry & Silverman (2000), Theorem A.4.3.1. If k is the field Q of rational numbers (or more generally a number field), there is an algorithm to determine whether a given conic has a rational point, based on the Hasse principle: a conic over Q has a rational point if and only if it has a point over all completions of Q, that is, over R and all p-adic fields Qp. =Genus 1= It is harder to determine whether a curve of genus 1 has a rational point. The Hasse principle fails in this case: for example, by Ernst Selmer, the cubic curve 3x3 \\\\+ 4y3 \\\\+ 5z3 = 0 in P2 has a point over all completions of Q, but no rational point.Silverman (2009), Remark X.4.11. The failure of the Hasse principle for curves of genus 1 is measured by the Tate‚ÄìShafarevich group. If X is a curve of genus 1 with a k-rational point p0, then X is called an elliptic curve over k. In this case, X has the structure of a commutative algebraic group (with p0 as the zero element), and so the set X(k) of k-rational points is an abelian group. The Mordell‚ÄìWeil theorem says that for an elliptic curve (or, more generally, an abelian variety) X over a number field k, the abelian group X(k) is finitely generated. Computer algebra programs can determine the Mordell‚ÄìWeil group X(k) in many examples, but it is not known whether there is an algorithm that always succeeds in computing this group. That would follow from the conjecture that the Tate‚ÄìShafarevich group is finite, or from the related Birch‚ÄìSwinnerton-Dyer conjecture.Silverman (2009), Conjecture X.4.13. =Genus at least 2= Faltings's theorem (formerly the Mordell conjecture) says that for any curve X of genus at least 2 over a number field k, the set X(k) is finite.Hindry & Silverman (2000), Theorem E.0.1. Some of the great achievements of number theory amount to determining the rational points on particular curves. For example, Fermat's last theorem (proved by Richard Taylor and Andrew Wiles) is equivalent to the statement that for an integer n at least 3, the only rational points of the curve xn \\\\+ yn = zn in P2 over Q are the obvious ones: [0,1,1] and [1,0,1]; [0,1,‚àí1] and [1,0,‚àí1] for n even; and [1,‚àí1,0] for n odd. The curve X (like any smooth curve of degree n in P2) has genus (n ‚àí 1)(n ‚àí 2)/2. It is not known whether there is an algorithm to find all the rational points on an arbitrary curve of genus at least 2 over a number field. There is an algorithm that works in some cases. Its termination in general would follow from the conjectures that the Tate‚ÄìShafarevich group of an abelian variety over a number field is finite and that the Brauer‚ÄìManin obstruction is the only obstruction to the Hasse principle, in the case of curves.Skorobogatov (2001), section 6,3. Higher dimensions =Varieties with few rational points= In higher dimensions, one unifying goal is the Bombieri‚ÄìLang conjecture that, for any variety X of general type over a number field k, the set of k-rational points of X is not Zariski dense in X. (That is, the k-rational points are contained in a finite union of lower-dimensional subvarieties of X.) In dimension 1, this is exactly Faltings's theorem, since a curve is of general type if and only if it has genus at least 2. Lang also made finer conjectures relating finiteness of rational points to Kobayashi hyperbolicity.Hindry & Silverman (2000), section F.5.2. For example, the Bombieri‚ÄìLang conjecture predicts that a smooth hypersurface of degree d in projective space Pn over a number field does not have Zariski dense rational points if d ‚â• n + 2. Not much is known about that case. The strongest known result on the Bombieri‚ÄìLang conjecture is Faltings's theorem on subvarieties of abelian varieties (generalizing the case of curves). Namely, if X is a subvariety of an abelian variety A over a number field k, then all k-rational points of X are contained in a finite union of translates of abelian subvarieties contained in X.Hindry & Silverman (2000), Theorem F.1.1.1. (So if X contains no translated abelian subvarieties of positive dimension, then X(k) is finite.) =Varieties with many rational points= In the opposite direction, a variety X over a number field k is said to have potentially dense rational points if there is a finite extension field E of k such that the E-rational points of X are Zariski dense in X. Fr√©d√©ric Campana conjectured that a variety is potentially dense if and only if it has no rational fibration over a positive-dimensional orbifold of general type.Campana (2004), Conjecture 9.20. A known case is that every cubic surface in P3 over a number field k has potentially dense rational points, because (more strongly) it becomes rational over some finite extension of k (unless it is the cone over a plane cubic curve). Campana's conjecture would also imply that a K3 surface X (such as a smooth quartic surface in P3) over a number field has potentially dense rational points. That is known only in special cases, for example if X has an elliptic fibration.Hassett (2003), Theorem 6.4. One may ask when a variety has a rational point without extending the base field. In the case of a hypersurface X of degree d in Pn over a number field, there are good results when d is much smaller than n, often based on the Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood circle method. For example, the Hasse‚ÄìMinkowski theorem says that the Hasse principle holds for quadric hypersurfaces over a number field (the case d = 2). Christopher Hooley proved the Hasse principle for smooth cubic hypersurfaces in Pn over Q when n ‚â• 8.Hooley (1988), Theorem. In higher dimensions, even more is true: every smooth cubic in Pn over Q has a rational point when n ‚â• 9, by Roger Heath-Brown.Heath-Brown (1983), Theorem. More generally, Birch's theorem says that for any odd positive integer d, there is an integer N such that for all n ‚â• N, every hypersurface of degree d in Pn over Q has a rational point. For hypersurfaces of smaller dimension (in terms of their degree), things can be more complicated. For example, the Hasse principle fails for the smooth cubic surface 5x3 \\\\+ 9y3 \\\\+ 10z3 \\\\+ 12w3 = 0 in P3 over Q, by Ian Cassels and Richard Guy.Colliot-Th√©l√®ne, Kanevsky & Sansuc (1987), section 7. Jean-Louis Colliot-Th√©l√®ne has conjectured that the Brauer‚ÄìManin obstruction is the only obstruction to the Hasse principle for cubic surfaces. More generally, that should hold for every rationally connected variety over a number field.Colliot-Th√©l√®ne (2015), section 6.1. In some cases, it is known that X has \\"many\\" rational points whenever it has one. For example, extending work of Beniamino Segre and Yuri Manin, J√°nos Koll√°r showed: for a cubic hypersurface X of dimension at least 2 over a perfect field k with X not a cone, X is unirational over k if it has a k-rational point.Koll√°r (2002), Theorem 1.1. (In particular, for k infinite, unirationality implies that the set of k-rational points is Zariski dense in X.) The Manin conjecture is a more precise statement that would describe the asymptotics of the number of rational points of bounded height on a Fano variety. Counting points over finite fields A variety X over a finite field k has only finitely many k-rational points. The Weil conjectures, proved by Andr√© Weil in dimension 1 and by Pierre Deligne in any dimension, give strong estimates for the number of k-points in terms of the Betti numbers of X. For example, if X is a smooth projective curve of genus g over a field k of order q (a prime power), then :\\\\big X(k)-(q+1)\\\\big \\\\leq 2g\\\\sqrt{q}. For a smooth hypersurface X of degree d in Pn over a field k of order q, Deligne's theorem gives the bound:Katz (1980), section II. :\\\\big X(k)-(q^{n-1}+\\\\cdots+q+1)\\\\big \\\\leq \\\\bigg( \\\\frac{(d-1)^{n+1}+(-1)^{n+1}(d-1)}{d}\\\\bigg) q^{(n-1)/2}. There are also significant results about when a projective variety over a finite field k has at least one k-rational point. For example, the Chevalley‚ÄìWarning theorem implies that any hypersurface X of degree d in Pn over a finite field k has a k-rational point if d ‚â§ n. For smooth X, this also follows from H√©l√®ne Esnault's theorem that every smooth projective rationally chain connected variety, for example every Fano variety, over a finite field k has a k-rational point.Esnault (2003), Corollary 1.3.

Cultivation It is the most commonly used species of Agrostis. It is used for turf in gardens and landscapes, particularly on golf courses. Many of the putting greens as well as an increasing number of fairways in the northern USA are creeping bentgrass. Early work in creeping bentgrass transgenics looked at glyphosate-resistance. However, due to easy wind pollination, seeds were dispersed into the environment. A 2004 gene flow study (with scientific sampling methods) documents gene flow on a landscape level, with a maximum at and (respectively) in sentinel and resident plants observed by scientist, located in primarily nonagronomic places such as irrigation ditches. Other work in transgenic bentgrass looks into salinity tolerance. The improved performance of the transgenic plants was associated with higher relative water content, higher sodium uptake and lower solute leakage in leaf tissues, with higher concentrations of Na+, K+, Cl- and total phosphorus in root tissues, and with higher auxin accumulation rate in the root tissue. This transgenic plant can survive in the presence of 1.7% sodium chloride (half seawater salinity concentration), while the non transgenic line and wild type plants cannot.ZHIGANG LI, Christian M.
