For about three years, Malchik lived at the Mendeleyevskaya station on the Moscow Metro. In 2001, he was killed when a 22-year-old woman, Yuliana Romanova, stabbed him with a kitchen knife. The incident sparked a wave of public outrage regarding the treatment of animals, and, in 2007, a monument was erected in Malchik's honour at Mendeleyevskaya station.  Life at Mendeleyevskaya station  Malchik was a black mongrel stray dog, who lived at the Mendeleyevskaya station for about three years. He became a popular station \\"resident\\" among commuters and railway employers, who often brought him food, and he often defended his territory against drunks and other dogs. Death On a winter evening in December 2001, 22-year-old Yuliana Romanova (Volkova) was passing through Mendeleyevska station with her pet Staffordshire Bull Terrier. They encountered Malchik in a pedestrian underpass, and the stray dog barked at the pair. One report holds that Romanova set her dog on the sleeping Malchik. Romanova reached into her purse, removed a kitchen knife, and stabbed Malchik six times in the back, chest and stomach. The dog died several minutes later.Mendeleyevskaya metro station, where Malchik lived until its deathA shopkeeper from a nearby stall tried to prevent the attack, but Malchik died before the police and an ambulance arrived. The woman was said to have fled the scene and there was no formal investigation initially. However, Romanova was traced back as the killer by Irina Ozyornaya, an investigative reporter of the popular newspaper Izvestiya, who started writing articles about the incident, identifying Romanova as a young fashion model. When contacted by the reporter, Romanova reportedly shrugged off the incident. Later it was revealed that Romanova has a long history of cruelty to animals and psychiatric treatment.Contrary to many news reports, Romanova was not a professional model: she made only one occasional shot with a Russian modeling agency \\"Art-Site\\"; see \\"Ну, подумаешь, собачку ножом пырнула\\" After a year of campaigning, however, Romanova was arrested and tried, and underwent one year of psychiatric treatment. The story of Malchik's death received widespread coverage in the Russian media. Monument In February 2007, a monument entitled \\"Compassion\\" (or \\"Sympathy\\"; ) was erected at Mendeleyevskaya station. The monument was funded by public donations. It was erected on the night of 15/16 February 2007 and officially unveiled on 17 February. A bronze sculpture of Malchik was placed on a monolithic pedestal of serpentine. Among the artists responsible for the monument were sculptor Alexander Tsigal, artist Sergey Tsigal, architect Andrey Nalich, and designer Peter Nalich. The unveiling ceremony was attended by notable artists, many of whom had donated money for the monument's installation, including Andrey Makarevich, Mikhail Shirvindt, Veniamin Smekhov, Oleg Anofriev, Ludmila Kasatkina and Sergey Yursky. The Russian inscription on the monument reads \\" 'Compassion' is dedicated to humane relationships with homeless animals.\\" The monument has been cited as one of Moscow's most unusual tourist attractions. Legacy Joanna Bednarek wrote that Malchik's story typifies the \\"peculiar mix of cruelty and sentimentality present in our approach to domesticated animals, particularly dogs.\\" In 2019, the postal department of Russia released a postage stamp portraying the Compassion monument in the memory of Malchik.

Additionally, LGC is the only of these colleges to offer a BA degree in Communication studies. Academics The college currently offers one BA degree with two tracks: (i) Media & Culture and (ii) Global Business. Students There are approximately 200 undergraduate students enrolled in the school. Among these students, each semester LSGB hosts nearly 10 study abroad students from its partnership universities, including Concordia University Irvine, Western Carolina University, Green Mountain University, Arkansas State University, Lynchburg College, Universidad de Costa Rica, University of Calcutta, and De La Salle University, among others. The QS Top Universities 2011 Asian Rankings listed Hannam as the 169th best university in Asia for attracting international students to study on campus. Additionally, LSGB students study abroad typically in their third year at one of Hannam University's partner schools.

Linton, from whom the college borrows its name.http://lgc.hnu.kr/sub1/sub1_01.php Hannam University is also ranked 120th among Asian universities for its high number of foreign faculty (as a percentage of total faculty). The largest number of these faculty are housed in LGC, which began its international programs at Hannam in 2005. It was thus one of the first colleges to offer such an international English-immersion 4-year degree program at the undergraduate level, and the first to do so with an international faculty. All classes are taught in English by English- speaking Korean professors and international faculty from the United States, Britain, Canada, Iran, and the Philippines, among other nations.http://lgc.hnu.kr/sub2/sub2_01.php According to QS Top Universities, Hannam faculty are among the top 100 universities in Asia for knowledge production, as measured by the number of scholarly citations in academic journals.

Gipps who developed it in the late-1970s under S.R.C. grants at the Transport Operations Research Group at the University of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne and the Transport Studies Group at the University College London. It is based directly on driver behavior and expectancy for vehicles in a stream of traffic. Limitations on driver and vehicle parameters for safety purposes mimic the traits of vehicles following vehicles in the front of the traffic stream. Gipps' model is differentiated by other models in that Gipps uses a timestep within the function equal to \\\\tau to reduce the computation required for numerical analysis. Introduction The method of modeling individual cars along a continuous space originates with Chandler et al. (1958), Gazis et al. (1961), Lee (1966) and Bender and Fenton (1972),Gipps, P. G. 1981 A behavioural car- following model for computer simulation. Transportation Research Part B, 15, 105-111 though many other papers proceeded and have since followed. In turn, these papers have bases in several works from the mid-1950s. Of special importance are a few that have analogies to fluid dynamics and movement of gases (Lighthill and Whitman (1955) and Richards (1956) postulated the density of traffic to be a function of position; Newell (1955) makes an analogy between vehicle motion along a sparsely populated roadway and the movement of gases). First mention of simulating traffic with “high speed computers” is given by Gerlough and Mathewson (1956) and Goode (1956). Definition The impetus for modeling vehicles in a stream of traffic and their subsequent actions and reactions comes from the need to analyze changes to roadway parameters. Indeed, many factors (to include driver, traffic flow and roadway conditions, to name a few) affect how traffic behaves. Gipps (1981) describes models current to that time to be in the general form of: :a_n(t+\\\\tau)= l_n \\\\frac {\\\\left [ v_{n-1}(t)-v_n(t)\\\\right] ^k }{\\\\left [ x_{n-1}(t)-x_n(t)\\\\right] ^m} which is defined primarily by one vehicle (noted by subscript n) following another (noted by subscript n-1); reaction time of the following vehicle \\\\tau; the locations x_{n}(t), x_{n-1}(t) and speeds v_{n}(t), v_{n-1}(t) of the following and preceding vehicle; acceleration a_n(t+\\\\tau) of the following vehicle at time (t+\\\\tau); and finally, model constants l_n, k, m to adjust the model to real-life conditions. Gipps states that it is desirable for the interval between successive recalculations of acceleration, speed and location to be a fraction of the reaction time which necessitates the storage of a considerable quantity of historical data if the model is to be used in a simulation program. He also points out that the parameters l_n, k and m has no obvious connection with identifiable characteristics of driver or vehicle. So, he introduces a new and improved model. Gipps’ model should reflect the following properties: # The model should reflect real conditions, # Model parameters should correspond to observable driver characteristics without undue calculation, and, # The model should behave as expected when the interval between successive recalculations of speed and position is the same as driver reaction time. Gipps sets limitations on the model through safety considerations and assuming a driver would estimate his or her speed based on the vehicle in front to be able to come to a full and safe stop if needed (1981). Pipes (1953) and many others have defined following characteristics placed into models based on various driver department codes defining safe following speeds, known informally as a “2 second rule,” though is formally defined through code. ; ;Model notation * a_n is the maximum acceleration which the driver of vehicle n wishes to undertake, * b_n is the most severe braking that the driver of vehicle n wishes to undertake (b_n<0), * s_n is the effective size of vehicle n, that is, the physical length plus a margin into which the following vehicle is not willing to intrude, even when at rest, * V_n is the speed at which the driver of vehicle n wishes to travel, * x_n(t) is the location of the front of vehicle n at time *t, * v_n(t) is the speed of vehicle n at time t, and * \\\\tau is the apparent reaction time, a constant for all vehicles. ;Constraints leading to development Gipps defines the model by a set of limitations. The following vehicle is limited by two constraints: that it will not exceed its driver's desired speed and its free acceleration should first increase with speed as engine torque increases then decrease to zero as the desired speed is reached. :v_n(t+\\\\tau) \\\\le v_n(t)+2.5 a_n \\\\tau( 1-v_n /V_n) ( 0.025+v_n( t)/V_n)^{1/2} The third constraint, braking, is given by :x_{n-1}^\\\\ast = x_{n-1}(t)-v_{n-1}(t)^2/2b_{n-1} for vehicle n-1 at point x_{n-1}^\\\\ast, where x_n^\\\\ast (for vehicle n is given by :x_n^\\\\ast=x_n(t)+\\\\left[v_n(t)+v_n(t+\\\\tau)\\\\right]\\\\tau/2-v_n(t+\\\\tau)^2/2b_n at time t+\\\\tau For safety, the driver of vehicle n (the following vehicle) must ensure that the difference between point where vehicle n-1 stops (x_{n-1}^\\\\ast) and the effective size of vehicle n-1 (s_{n-1}) is greater than the point where vehicle n stops (x_n^\\\\ast). However, Gipps finds the driver of vehicle n allows for an additional buffer and introduces a safety margin, of delay \\\\theta when driver n is traveling at speed v_n(t+\\\\tau). Thus the braking limitation is given by :x_{n-1}(t) - v_{n-1}(t)^2/2b_{n-1}-s_{n-1} \\\\ge x_n(t) + \\\\left[v_n(t)+ v_n(t+\\\\tau)\\\\right]\\\\tau/2+v_n(t+\\\\tau)\\\\theta-v_n(t+\\\\tau)^2/2b_n Because a driver in traffic cannot estimate b_{n-1}, it is replaced by an estimated value \\\\hat{b}. Therefore, the above after replacement yields, :-v_n(t+\\\\tau)^2/2b_n+v_n(t+\\\\tau)(\\\\tau/2+\\\\theta)-\\\\left[x_{n-1}(t)-s_{n-1}-x_n(t)\\\\right]+v_n(t)\\\\tau/2+v_{n-1}(t)^2/2\\\\hat{b} \\\\le 0 If the introduced delay, \\\\theta, is equal to half of the reaction time, \\\\tau/2, and the driver is willing to brake hard, a model system can continue without disruption to flow. Thus, the previous equation can be rewritten with this in mind to yield :v_n(t+\\\\tau) \\\\le b_n\\\\tau+\\\\sqrt{b_n^2\\\\tau^2-b_n\\\\left(2\\\\left[x_{n-1}(t)-s_{n-1}-x_n(t)\\\\right]-v_n(t)\\\\tau- v_{n-1}(t)^2/\\\\hat{b}\\\\right)} If the final assumption is true, that is, the driver travels as fast and safely as possible, the new speed of the driver's vehicle is given by the final equation being Gipps' model: :v_n(t+\\\\tau)= \\\\mbox{min} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{v_n (t)+2.5a_n \\\\tau (1-v_n (t)/V_n) \\\\left(0.025+v_n \\\\left(t \\\\right)/V_n \\\\right)^{1/2} \\\\right ., :::::: \\\\left .b_n\\\\tau+\\\\sqrt{b_n^2\\\\tau^2-b_n\\\\left[ 2\\\\left[x_{n-1}(t)-s_{n-1}-x_n(t)\\\\right] -v_n(t)\\\\tau-v_{n-1}(t)^2/\\\\hat{b}\\\\right]} \\\\right \\\\\\\\} where the first argument of the minimization regimes describes an uncongested roadway and headways are large, and the second argument describes congested conditions where headways are small and speeds are limited by followed vehicles. These two equations used to determine the velocity of a vehicle in the next timestep represent free-flow and congested conditions, respectively. If the vehicle is in free- flow, the free-flow branch of the equation indicates that the speed of the vehicle will increase as a function of its current speed, the speed at which the driver intends to travel, and the acceleration of the vehicle. Analyzing the variables in these two equations, it becomes apparent that as the gap between two vehicles decreases (i.e. a following vehicle approaches a leading vehicle) the velocity given by the congested branch of the equation will decrease and is more likely to prevail. Using numerical methods to generate time-space diagrams After determining the velocity of the vehicle at the next timestep, its position at the next timestep should be calculated. There are several numerical (Runge–Kutta) methods that can be used to do this, depending on the accuracy to which the user would prefer. Using higher order methods to calculate a vehicle's position in the next timestep will yield a result with higher accuracy (if each method uses the same timestep). Numerical methods can also be used to find positions of vehicles in other car following models, such as the intelligent driver model. Eulers Method (first order, and perhaps the simplest of the numerical methods) can be used to obtain accurate results, but the timestep would have to be very small, resulting in a greater amount of computation. Also, as a vehicle comes to a stop and the following vehicle approaches it, the term underneath the square root in the congested part of the velocity equation could potentially fall below zero if Euler's method is being used and the timestep is too large. The position of the vehicle in the next timestep is given by the equation: x(t+τ)= x(t) +v(t)τ Higher order methods not only use the velocity in the current timestep, but velocities from the previous timestep to generate a more accurate result. For instance, Huen’s Method (second order) averages the velocity from the current and previous timestep to determine the next position of a vehicle: Butchers Method (fifth order) uses an even more elegant solution to solve the same problem: x(t+τ) = x(t) + (1/90)(7k1 \\\\+ 32k3 \\\\+ 12k4\\\\+ 32k5 \\\\+ 7k6)τ k1 = v(t-τ) k3 = v(t-τ) + (1/4)(v(t) - v(t-τ)) k4 = v(t-τ) + (1/2)(v(t) - v(t-τ)) k5 = v(t-τ) + (3/4)(v(t) - v(t-τ)) k6 = v(t) Using higher-order methods reduces the probability that the term under the square root in the congested branch of the velocity equation will fall below zero. For the purpose of simulation, it is important to make sure the velocity and position of every vehicle has been calculated for a timestep before determining the moving along to the next timestep. In 2000, Wilson used Gipp's model for simulating driver behavior on a ring road. In this case, every vehicle in the system is following another vehicle – the leader follows the last vehicle. The results of the experiment showed that the cars followed a free-flow time-space trajectory when the density on the ring road was low. However, as the number of vehicles on the road increases (density increases), kinematic waves begin to form as the congested part of the Gipps’ Model velocity equation prevails.

Approximately 80 Native American tribes were living in Oregon before the establishment of European colonialist settlements and ultimately a widespread genocide and displacement of the local indigenous tribes. Trappers and traders were the harbingers of the coming migration of Europeans. Many of these settlers traveled along the nationally renowned Oregon Trail, with estimates of around 53,000 using the trail between 1840 and 1850. World War I stimulated the shipyards and timber trades in Oregon, especially Portland which is still an integral part of the Northwest economy. In the 1930s, New Deal programs such as the Works Projects Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps built many projects around the state, including such Oregon treasures as Timberline Lodge on Mt. Hood. Hydroelectric dams and roads were also built at this time, improving the quality of life of many Oregonians. This encouraged settlement, and irrigation water from the Columbia River aided agricultural development. The Bonneville Dam was a plentiful and cheap source of power, which stimulated the development of industries such as aluminum plants during World War II. Food production, shipbuilding and the lumber were also greatly enhanced by the needs of the nation during World War II. In recent years, electronics and tourism have broadened its economic base. Tourism is now the state's third largest source of revenue, after lumber and agriculture. In agriculture, Oregon is one of the top producers in such crops as greenhouse and nursery products, Christmas trees, grass seed, peppermint, blackberries and filberts. Other crops produced in Oregon are wheat, potatoes, pears, onions, snap beans and sweet corn. The products of Oregon wineries are nationally known, especially the chardonnay and pinot noir from Yamhill and Washington counties. The diversity of berries produced there (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and many other varieties of cane berries) make summer an eagerly awaited season in Oregon. Today, there are statewide groups, such as the Oregon Cultural Trust, that raise new funds to invest in Oregon's arts, humanities and heritage. The annual Oregon State Fair is a major event which has been held since 1861. Farm, garden and floral competitions are held.  Native American culture in Oregon  Oregon has a diverse Indian culture in Oregon with approximately 80 Native American tribes were living in Oregon before the establishment of European pioneer settlements. There are seven reservations in Oregon that belong to seven of the nine federally recognized Oregon tribes: *Burns Paiute Indian Colony, of the Burns Paiute Tribe: 13,738 acres (55.60 km2) in Harney County *Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Reservation, of Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians is less than 10 acres (40,000 m2) *Coquille Reservation includes 5,400 acres (22 km2) of land held in trust for the Coquille Tribe in and around Coos Bay, Oregon. *Grand Ronde Community, of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon: 11,040 acres (44.7 km2), mostly in Yamhill County, with the rest in Polk County. *Siletz Reservation, of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz: 4,204 acres (17.01 km2), 3,666 acres (14.84 km2) of which is in Lincoln County. *Umatilla Reservation, of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation: 172,882 acres (699.63 km2), mostly in Umatilla County, with the rest in Union County. *Warm Springs Reservation, of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs: 641,118 acres (2,594.51 km2), mostly in Wasco County and Jefferson County, with parts in Clackamas, Marion, and Linn counties. Arts Portland Art Museum =Museums= The Jordan Schnitzer Museum on the University of Oregon campus has been a part of Oregon's culture since it opened on June 10, 1933. The museum was built to house the Murray Warner Collection of Oriental Art—more than 3,000 objects given to the University by Gertrude Bass Warner, the museum's first director and \\"curator for life.\\" It is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. Another major art museum in Oregon is the Portland Art Museum (PAM). Founded in late 1892, the Portland Art Museum is the seventh oldest museum in the United States and the oldest in the Pacific Northwest. The Museum is internationally recognized for its permanent collection and ambitious special exhibitions, drawn from the Museum's holdings and the world's finest public and private collections. With a membership of over 23,000 households and serving more than 350,000 visitors annually, the Museum is a premier venue for education in the visual arts. =Performing arts= Another major interest in the art is Oregon is the performing arts. The most notable event for the performing arts in Oregon is the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, a cultural event that has been running in Ashland, Oregon since 1935. The Portland Opera is another walk of the performing arts culture of Oregon and was the world premiere location for both Bernard Herrmann's Wuthering Heights and Christopher Drobny's Lucy's Lapses. Shanghaied in Astoria is a musical melodrama that is performed by the Astor Street Opry Company every summer in Astoria. It has run since 1984, and has been attended by over 55,000 people.http://www.shanghaiedinastoria.com/ Music Schnitzer Hall The Oregon Symphony currently ranks among the largest orchestras in the nation and as one of the largest arts organizations in the Northwest. Their special event concerts and presentations to an audiences totaling around 320,000 annually. One major outlet of music in Oregon is the Oregon Festival of American Music. The Oregon Festival of American Music is an eclectic, thematically-based two-week summer music festival that has been held annually in Eugene since 1992 and has been produced by The John G. Shedd Institute for the Arts. Literature =Authors= The non-profit arts and culture sector of the economic generates more than $680 million annually for Oregon. The state government alongside the non-profit Literary Arts sponsors the Oregon Book Awards, which honors literary excellence in writing and publishing since the 1980s. These factors, alongside a community of independent booksellers such as Powell's Books, has attracted many writers to the area, including Tom Spanbauer (who has been called \\"the Godfather of Portland's Writing Scene\\"), Omar El Akkad, Jean Auel, David Biespiel, Matthew Dickman, Ian Doescher, Dorianne Laux, Elena Passarello, Matthew Minicucci, Karen Russell, Kim Stafford, Cheryl Strayed, Mary Szybist, and Lidia Yuknavitch, among others. Children's author Beverly Cleary was born in McMinnville, Oregon in 1916, and attended Grant High School, in northeast Portland. Although Cleary and her husband would eventually settle in Carmel- by-the-Sea, California, the author continued to write stories set in Portland, and used many references to the city in them. Henry Huggins, for instance, lived on Klickitat Street, while Ramona Quimby was named for Quimby Street. In return, in 1995 fans of the author successfully raised funds to commemorate her work with the Beverly Cleary Sculpture Garden in Grant Park, which features many of her most famous characters. Ken Kesey, best known for his novels One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (later adapted into an Academy Award winning film starring Jack Nicholson) and Sometimes a Great Notion, lived in Oregon for most of his life. Originally from Colorado, Kesey moved to Eugene in 1957 to attend the University of Oregon. After spending six months incarcerated for marijuana possession in Redwood City, California, he settled permanently in Pleasant Hill, Oregon, with his family 1966, where he resided until his death in 2001. In 2017, the city of Eugene renamed the southeast corner of Broadway and Willamette Street Kesey Square in honor of the author. Speculative fiction author Ursula K. Le Guin lived in northwest Portland from 1958 until her death in 2018, having moved to the city after her husband, the historian Charles Le Guin, was hired as an instructor at Portland State University. The Lathe of Heaven, one of LeGuin's most renowned novels, is set in a future Portland.

In the Frankish annals, Unno is described as a Frisian duke. He belonged to the Frisian elite who were willing to cooperate with the Franks after annexation of East Frisia in 772. In exchange for retaining their old privileges they had to become Christian and leave their pagan beliefs. Following the defeat of the revolt of 782–785, the Frisians suffered harsh punishments and forced recruitment for the Frankish Empire's campaign against the Avars in the east. This led Unno, together with Eilrad, to lead another revolt against the Frankish empire of Charlemagne. This revolt resulted in the Frisians temporarily falling back to their old pagan beliefs. Christian missionaries such as Liudger were forced to flee and had to find a safe haven in the south of the Frankish empire. Unlike the earlier rebellion this one was to the area east of the Lauwers. It was beaten down in the same year.  Sources  , Het rijk van de Friese koningen, opkomst en ondergang, Utrecht, 2000, pag. 310.

It was in this school where the members met. Four band members are fully blind while the fifth has partial vision. While buying equipment to form a band, Fauzi had a conversation with the leader of a band called “Banda Reflexo”, whose musicians are still acquainted with him today. There, they worked as hired musicians, playing in São Luis and nearby cities parties, running a repertoire that held all the successful rhythms from that time, such as reggae, lambada, dance, serestas, meringues etc. As a peculiar feature, the band is formed by four visually impaired men who had met each other still young at Escola de Cegos do Maranhão and awake to music using school's old instruments (a music keyboard with missing piano keys, a guitar missing chords and the druumer used to use the writing desk to set the pace). Then, they agreed to follow together the project to form a reggae music band. Contested by the cultural elite, but embraced by the masses, reggae music became one of the most relevant features of maranhense culture, where it was created a very singular way to listen and dance the rhythm, creating an aspect that is unique in the entire world. At that time, the “radiolas”, or sound-systems, recognized in this manner in Jamaica, were responsible for spreading reggae music in the whole state, while different reggae clubs maintained the rhythm on top attending a great public frequency, even though reggae was still not played on radios. In this situation, Tribo de Jah started to propagate its reggae roots, approaching social, political, spiritual subjects with love and peace messages. The band opened a market for reggae music in Brazil, playing in places where the Jamaican rhythm was never heard before attracting a legion of fans in the entire country. The band was the pioneer introducing reggae theme in Brazil: terms like “Jah” (God), “Babylon”, “Roots” (title of their first album), among others, were never been spread nationally until then, what made the culture to be known in large scale by fans and other bands. The band's success out of the borders is due to Tribo de Jah sing in other tree languages besides Portuguese: French, Spanish and English. Beyond international concerts, the band recorded the album “In Version” in Interlaken, Switzerland; “Reggae’n Blues” album in San Diego, California, featuring musicians that followed Peter Tosh, such as the bass player George Fullwood, the drummer Santa Davis, the guitar player Tony Chin, among others. Tribo de Jah also recorded an entirely album in English to the foreign Market, entitled “Love to the World, Peace to the People”. Recorded 2008 in Belem, Pará, the last bands DVD, has as its main song and album title “Live in Amazon”, a global appeal against deforestation: “Cease the fire in the forest or we all shall burn...”, which brought the Jamaican singer featuring ex-Gladiators singer Clinton Fearon. The last album was released in 2014 titled Pedra de Salão, and it makes immersion in the essence of Mararanhão cultural reggae, hearkening back to its genesis. The Reggae Maranhão Museum features relics of reggae, such as a guitar from the Maranhense band Tribo de Jah, used by the band in more than 20 countries, as part of the group's history, having been used in the main recordings of their songs and in national and international major concerts .

Ray Colonel Charles R. Ray (September 14, 1938 – January 18, 1982) was an American officer of the US Army who was murdered on January 18, 1982, in Paris by a Lebanese militant affiliated with the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Faction while serving as an assistant military attaché. A 35-year-old Lebanese man, Georges Ibrahim Abdallah, was accused of shooting and killing Ray outside his Paris apartment on the morning of 18 January 1982. The Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Faction claimed responsibility for the murder. Ray was shot in the head at point-blank range at about 9 AM as he was walking to his car, which was parked about 100 yards from his apartment. The earliest reports simply indicated that a lone armed man shot Ray at close range in the head with a pistol.  Personal  Ray was born in New York City on September 14, 1938. He was commissioned in the U.S. Army in 1960. Ray had been stationed in Paris as the Assistant Army Attaché for 18 months. He was a distinguished military intelligence officer, a decorated Vietnam veteran, and on his first assignment as a military attaché. He was married and had two children. Prior to this assignment he resided in Northern Virginia. He was an active parishioner at St. Bernadette's Roman Catholic Church in Springfield, VA, and was responsible for coordinating the altar servers.  Funeral  Grave at Arlington National Cemetery A state funeral was held for Lieutenant Colonel Ray at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, where he and his family had attended Mass since they first arrived in Paris in 1980. Following the Mass, Ray's body was flown back to the U.S. for a service at St. Bernadette's. Ray was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.  Presidential recognition  President Ronald Reagan promoted Ray to Colonel posthumously on 3 June 1982. The President approved the promotion and met with Ray's wife during a visit to Paris in June 1982. U.S. President Ronald Reagan issued the following statement on the death of Colonel Ray: > Lieutenant Colonel Charles R. Ray, our Assistant Army Attaché in Paris, was > a distinguished career officer. He gave his life in the line of duty as > surely as if he had fallen in battle. Our hearts go out to his family in > their bereavement, and the wanton act of his murderers reinforces our > determination to stamp out international terrorism and prevent similar > tragedies in the future.  Prosecution  Abdallah (aka Salih al-Masri and Abdu-Qadir Saadi) (fr) was captured in 1984 and was sentenced to life in prison in February 1987 for his involvement in the murder. He is currently imprisoned in France.

However June set a then record for tornadoes with 399 in one month (eclipsed in May 2003). July and August continued to see well above average numbers of tornadoes. Finally, November saw a major outbreak from the 21st to 23rd resulting in 26 deaths.

This training is generally focused on the reinforcement of both the department specific and National Fire Protection Association (and National Incident Management System) standard operating procedures and guidelines for improving tactical decisions during a real structure fire. In general terms, the software is a computer-based training tool for handling communication and activity on a fireground. Flame-Sim is developed by Flame- Sim, LLC, which is located in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. The company was established in 2007 with the intent on creating a training platform for firefighters to train in a virtual environment. In June, 2008, they released Flame-Sim 1.0. This was subsequently updated with new features and environments in October, 2009. Usage Flame-Sim has seen adoption in various markets of the fire services. It is an accredited course material by the Florida Bureau of Fire Standards and Training,fireengineering.com and is a current course for Florida State Fire College Virtual Experience Skills Training (VEST)floridafireprograms.com as well as a major portion of the Houston Fire Department’s training program and facility.firechief.com Some of the current users of Flame-Sim are: Allen Fire Department (Allen, TX), Plano Fire Department (Plano, TX), Wheat Ridge Fire Protection District (Wheat Ridge, CO), Dunbar High School (Dayton, OH), Waukesha County Technical College (Pewaukee, WI), Florida State Fire College (Ocala, FL), Wheeling Fire Department (Wheeling, IL), and Red Deer Emergency Services (Alberta, Canada).thebigredguide.comthebigredguide.com The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has assisted some fire departments financially in acquiring the softwarefiregrantshelp.com through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG).firegrantshelp.com Components Dynamic Combustion Model Flame-Sim uses a \\"dynamic\\" combustion model that was built based on the body of work done by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The model supposedly allows the simulated fire to spread in a more \\"dynamic\\" manner, by including such factors as ambient temperature, as well as proximity to other burning objects as a method of fire growth and spread. Situations such as ventilation, volume, pressure, and material properties are also included as factors. Scenario Creation The program includes an editing application which allows users to create their own training scenarios. According to the maker's website, the following items are customizable: residence type, water supply, vehicle staging, ignition points, ignition timers, \\"hazardous materials\\", placement and status of victims, window and door placements, \\"garage status\\", apparatus type, names, inventory, color, arrival delay, turnout gear, arriving personnel, and air supply time. Networking The software also allows networked usage for up to 10 live users.flame-sim.com Networking is performed through LAN or VLAN. All users communicate using in-system command interfaces that are built into the software, however, some users have allegedly found it effective to utilize their standard radios as they would on an actual fireground training exercise to communicate and coordinate their efforts. After Action Reporting The program creates a timeline of events that occur in the simulation that can be printed and reviewed by users. All feedback from the software uses an XML format, and so is portable between a number of different systems and programs. The system tracks 59 different NFPA and NIST guidelines for evaluation by each user for immediate feedback. Current Flame-Sim operates its own website. In addition, the company is actively pursuing teaching classes, such as those offered at the FDIC Trade Show.fireengineering.comfirerescue1.comcommunity.fdic.com The company offers downloads of a demonstration version of the software, as well as numerous website and fire industry trade publications.

The Usri Falls drop some in three separate streams. It is surrounded by dense forest. The character of the gneissic complex of this region is well exposed. Some of the rocks have been split up into blocks of huge dimension whose polished and clean surfaces have been chequered by veins of various hues. The profile of the river bed changes after passing through the falls. The lower portion is mostly flat, slightly undulating, which gives way to gorge like form. The government has taken several steps to develop the area as a prominent tourist spot along with Khandoli Dam and Parasnath.

Based on the Riverworld books by Philip José Farmer, the made-for-TV film is a reboot of the aborted Sci-Fi Channel Riverworld television series, of which only the pilot episode was produced. Riverworld stars Tahmoh Penikett, Laura Vandervoort, Jeananne Goossen, Alan Cumming, Mark Deklin, and Peter Wingfield. It is produced by Reunion Pictures, an award- winning Canadian-based production company. It is written by Robert Hewitt Wolfe and directed by Stuart Gillard. Plot War reporter Matt Ellman is in Singapore with his girlfriend Jessie, to whom he is about to propose marriage. Unfortunately, before he proposes, both of them are killed in a terrorist attack by a suicide bomber. Afterwards, they find themselves on a strange planet called Riverworld, where everyone who has ever lived on Earth has been reborn along the banks of a seemingly endless river. Riverworld functions as a sort of purgatory for deceased human beings to get a second chance. In this world, Matt finds several of his deceased friends as well as historical figures, some of whom are his allies and others who are antagonistic. The antagonists include explorer Richard Francis Burton (who in the books was the main protagonist) and Francisco Pizarro, the Conquistador who conquered the Incas. The friendlier people include American author Samuel Clemens (also known as Mark Twain) and Tomoe Gozen, a 12th-century Japanese warrior from the time of the Genpei War married to Minamoto no Yoshinaka. Along with the other heroes, Matt soon discovers that Riverworld has a deeper purpose and is controlled by otherworldly caretakers who are engaged in a civil war.  Cast  = Caretakers = The caretakers appear as blue-skinned robe-clad figures who watch over the humans. They were the beings who created Riverworld and are occasionally described as \\"demons\\". The caretakers are mostly divided between two separate factions: the Salvationists (those who wish to destroy Riverworld to move on to bigger and better things) and the Second Chancers (those who wish to protect Riverworld). There is a civil war between these two groups and their leaders. The leader of the first group thinks that his opponent is weak and does not see the bigger picture, while the leader of the second group views her enemy as a selfish traitor who only wishes to benefit himself. Both groups seek out their own champions to accomplish their goals, although it is strictly forbidden to do so because their laws state that they are not allowed to directly interfere with humans.  Nature of the river  Riverworld consists of an endless, or seemingly endless, river. In Riverworld, every human is effectively immortal as they are forever young and healthy (regardless of their age at the time of their Earthly death), can recover very fast from wounds, and are resistant to diseases. However, they can die, although they will always be resurrected somewhere else along the river at various different times. Some people use this for travel, calling it the \\"suicide express\\". Every person is also given a solid metal bracelet called a \\"grail band\\" for food and drinks, with the exception of champions who are sent into Riverworld without them as sort of a sign of being free from the bonds of Riverworld. It is later revealed that this also keeps the caretakers from tracking them, keeping the humans involved in the civil war more mobile and invisible to the opposing side. The river also has a \\"source\\" which is not only the start of the river, but also the entirety of Riverworld; it appears as The Dark Tower, which is similar to the name of one of the books in the Riverworld novels, The Dark Design.  Transportation  The two main forms of transportation are the riverboat and the zeppelin. The riverboat Not-for-Hire was built by Samuel Clemens, while the zeppelin was built by the man who built the Hindenburg and is called Herumfurzeln (which means in German to fart around). Both use what is suspected by one of the characters to be a fusion power source.

It was declared a Bien de Interés Cultural in 1931. The first fortress was probably built in the 11th- century, when Jerez was part of the small kingdom of the Taifa of Arcos de la Frontera, on a site settled since prehistoric times in the south-eastern corner of the city. In the 12th-century, a new structure was erected to be used as both residence and fortress by the Almohad rulers of southern Spain. Later, after the Reconquista of Andalusia, it was the seat of the first Christian mayors. The alcázar is one of a few structures that best exemplify Almohad architecture in the Iberian Peninsula. Features include: * a grossly quadrangular line of walls, with a perimeter of approximately 4,000 m * the Octagonal Tower, in Almohad style * the Tower of Ponce de León (14th-century), annexed to the keep. * a mosque, the only remaining of the eighteen once present in the city. After the Christian conquest of the fortress in 1261, it was put under the command of Nuño González de Lara. Later, it was turned into a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary by King Alfonso X of Castile. The minaret, still extant, was turned into a bell tower. The prayer hall, preceded by a small room of ritual ablutions, features a mihrab, indicating the direction of Mecca, and a rib vault with a circular window at the top. * the Palace of the Patio de Doña Blanca, dating to the 12th-century Islamic structure, originally a leisure pavilion * the bathhouse (hammam), they include an entrance area for undressing, leading to the cold and warm rooms, the latter being the largest in the complex. The final room is the hot room, whose heating system is still partially visible. *the Palace of Villavicencio, built in 1664 in Baroque style.  Description  = The Alcázar Complex = The defenses of the complex consisted of a double-walled design wherein a 4-meter-high battlement-topped outer wall was located 4 meters from the inner wall. That inner wall featured towers located at regular intervals; of the original towers, only 7 remain. These were mostly built using rammed earth and brick, though there are portions that utilize stone spolia from nearby sites. The towers themselves are Albarrana Towers and attached to the wall through a short arcade rather than being built into the wall. The castle-fortress itself served as an autonomous fortified city situated within a larger fortified city. This arrangement was a commonplace feature of Almohad building practices. As such, all the essentials of both military defense and everyday civilian life were contained within its walls. These included not only living quarters, baths, and mosques but also supply warehouses and water tanks. The building of a complex of such scale was both due to the Almohad aptitude for refining the construction process to a degree comparable with that of the Romans, and to their diminished use of decorative elements as compared to previous eras.

Her father had to go into exile when she was a child, and committed suicide in Australia. As a young woman she became interested in dance and specifically Vaslav Nijinsky, the noted premier danseur of the Ballets Russes. They married in Buenos Aires in 1913 while the company was on tour. They had two daughters, before he was institutionalized for the remaining 30 years of his life for schizophrenia. In 1934 Romola de Pulszky published her first biography of Nijinsky, covering his early life and dance career. She discovered his diary, written before he went into an asylum, which she published in a \\"bowdlerized\\" version in 1936. She published a biography of her husband's later years in 1952, two years after his death in London. Biography Romola de Pulszky was born in Hungary as the second daughter of Emilia Márkus, the most renowned Hungarian actress of her time, and Károly (Charles) Pulszky (1853-1899), a Hungarian politician, member of Parliament and director of the Hungarian National Gallery of Art. His family came from Poland and were of French Huguenot descent, but had converted to Catholicism.Ostwald, Peter (1991) Nijinsky/ A Leap into Madness', 'p.80 Her older sister Tereza was called Tessa. Their father went into exile because of a political scandal associated with art purchases for the gallery, first to London and then to Australia. Romola was eight years old when he committed suicide at the age of 45 in Brisbane, Australia.Thomas W. Shapcott, \\"A Canticle for Károly Pulszky\\", from Selected Poems, 1956-1988, Australian Poetry Library She was deeply disturbed by the loss and resented her mother's remarriage a few years later.Ostwald (1991), \\"Nijinsky, A Leap\\", pp. 81-82 Romola struggled with studies and direction, trying to work at acting but failed. She became engaged to a Hungarian baron at the age of 21, but called it off in 1912 after having seen the Ballets Russes. She decided to shift her focus to the theatrical world of ballet. She was particularly astounded by and attracted to the dancing of Vaslav Nijinsky, as were all of his audiences. She was fixated on wanting to dance for the Ballets Russes and become close to Nijinsky.Ostwald, Peter (1991) Nijinsky/ A Leap into Madness,' For months she traveled on tour to South America with the Ballets Russes and gained approval from the group's director, Sergei Diaghilev, to take ballet lessons from their ballet master Enrico Cecchetti. Not realizing that he was in an intimate relationship with Diaghilev (who was seventeen years older than Nijinsky), she found it difficult to talk to Nijinsky alone, who was protected by a minder. She eventually got close to them while on a ship headed for South America. Diaghilev had decided against touring with the company and remained in Europe. Days before their arrival to Buenos Aires, Argentina, Nijinsky proposed to Romola and they married in port on 10 September 1913, shortly after they arrived.Buckle, Richard (1971), \\"Nijinsky\\" Their marriage had severe effects on Nijinsky's career. Romola became pregnant right away, and Nijinsky missed performances due to his own symptoms of couvade syndrome. This gave Diaghilev legal grounds to fire him, which he did via a telegram. He generally did not keep any married dancers in the company. Romola gave birth to Kyra Nijinsky in Vienna, Austria on 18 June 1914, ten days before the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. With the outbreak of war, the newlywed couple and their infant daughter were classified as enemy aliens because of Nijinsky's Russian nationality; they were put on house arrest at the home of Romola's mother, Emilia Markus Pulszky. After two years as war prisoners in Hungary, they gained permission to leave for New York with the aid of Diaghilev and international political leaders. They embarked on a tour of North America, followed by a tour to South America.Nijinsky, Romola (1934), Nijinsky by Romola Nijinsky During Nijinsky's final three-year engagements with the Ballets Russes, he had struggled to help manage the tours, which caused him a great deal of stress. The family settled in St Moritz, Switzerland until the end of the Great War. Two months after the armistice at the end of World War I, Nijinsky began to exhibit signs of a severe psychosis. He was committed to a series of Swiss mental institutions, and was confined for most of his remaining 30 years. He was treated at Burghölzli and the Bellevue Sanatorium in Kreuzlingen. He was originally diagnosed as schizophrenic by Eugen Bleuler in 1919. He was treated by a number of psychiatrists with minimal results. In 1920, while he was still undergoing treatment, Romola Nijinsky gave birth to their second daughter, Tamara. After Nijinsky became an invalid and institutionalized, Romola shifted from bisexuality and had only lesbian affairs for the rest of her life.Ostwald (1991), Nijinsky A Leap, p. 87 In 1934 she published what would be her first biography of her husband, Nijinsky by Romola Nijinsky. She discovered the diary her husband wrote over a period of six weeks in 1919 before being committed to an asylum in Switzerland. \\"Nijinsky had long been unreachably psychotic when his wife, Romola, discovered the manuscript in an old trunk, then sanitized and published it to feed the legend of which she had become both guardian and beneficiary.\\"WILLIAM DERESIEWICZ, \\"Dancing With Madness: Review of 'The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky'\\", New York Times, 28 February 1999, accessed 1 December 2014 She published a \\"bowdlerized\\" version in 1936. In 1936, she heard about a new treatment for schizophrenia and contacted the founder, Manfred Sakel, to have her husband treated. In 1938, Nijinsky began to receive regular insulin shock therapy (IST) over the course of a year, until the beginning of World War II. Romola spent most of World War II in Budapest with Nijinsky, whose illness was purported to be in partial remission from the IST.Nijinsky, Romola (1952), The Last Years of Nijinsky Out of concern for her husband's safety after the German invasion of Budapest, Romola took her husband to Sopron, where they stayed until the end of the war. Kyra Nijinsky became a dancer, specializing in a couple of roles her father had done as well as a new dance by Antony Tudor. In 1936 she married Igor Markevitch, with whom she had a son named for her father.Jack Anderson, \\"Kyra Nijinsky, 84; Danced in Father's Shadow\\", New York Times, 15 November 1998, accessed 1 December 2014 They divorced and Markevitch raised their son. Like her younger sister Tamara, she later emigrated to the United States, settling in the San Francisco area. Romola sent her younger daughter Tamara Nijinsky to live with her mother in Budapest for some time. She was too young to have seen her father dance, but became executive director of the Vaslav and Romola Nijinsky Foundation (named after her parents), to preserve and promote her father's art, including paintings and drawings he did late in life. She emigrated to the US and settled in Phoenix, Arizona.Zan Dubin, \\"Memories of a Troubled Father\\", Los Angeles Times, 3 November 1994 Nijinsky died on 8 April 1950 in London, England. In 1952 Romola published her second biography of Nijinsky, called The Last Years of Nijinsky. Romola Nijinsky died in Paris on 9 September 1978. In 1995, an unexpurgated English edition was published of The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky, edited by Joan Acocella, a professional writer about dance, and in a new translation by Kyril FitzLyon. The New York Times review said that this edition showed that his original diary was severely \\"bowdlerized\\" by his wife in the versions she published in 1936 and later. His diary reflected the decline of his household into chaos before he was committed to an asylum. He elevated feeling and action in his writing. A New York Times review said, \\"How ironic that in erasing the real ugliness of his insanity, the old version silenced not only Nijinsky's true voice but the magnificently gifted body from which it came. And how fortunate we are to have them both restored.\\" This version inspired new artistic works - three plays in 1998 alone.

A prison commissary or canteen is a store within a correctional facility, from which inmates may purchase products such as hygiene items, snacks, writing instruments, etc. Typically inmates are not allowed to possess cash; instead, they make purchases through an account with funds from money contributed by friends, family members, etc., or earned as wages. Typically, prisons set a maximum limit of funds that can be spent by each inmate on commissary.  Items used as currency  It is generally prohibited for inmates to trade items purchased on commissary. However, certain items tend to be used as currency. Cigarettes were a classic medium of exchange, but in the wake of prison tobacco bans, postage stamps have become a more common currency item, along with any inexpensive, popular item that has a round number price such as 25 or 50 cents. Ramen is also increasingly popular due to its rarity in prisons as food or trading value.  Popular items  Spices, including those packaged with instant ramen noodles, are a popular item due to the often bland nature of prison food. As prison budgets are cut in the US, ramen has become a popular commodity to supplement food needs. Mylar foil packets of mackerel fish or \\"macks\\" are one such item.  History  In 1930, the U.S. Department of Justice authorized and established a commissary at each federal institution.  Operation  Some prison commissaries are staffed by government employees and inmates, while others have been completely privatized. Significant price markups are common in prison commissaries, although some prison systems set maximum markups; for instance, the Delaware Department of Correction has a 20% maximum markup. $100 million in purchases were made from Texas' prison system alone in 2009.

Since 2002 she has been running a campaign for changing the planned route of the Via Baltica Expressway in order to preserve the Rospuda Valley. In 2010 she won the Goldman Environmental Prize for her achievements as the second Pole in history, after Jadwiga Łopata winning the Prize in 2002. Beside this, together with her husband they run an ecotourism household in the Biebrza Valley.http://www.trzcianne.pl/en/turystyka/baza-noclegowa/22-gorscy- malgorzata-i-krzysztof.html  Contribution to preserving the Rospuda Valley The Rospuda Valley, in the north eastern Poland, is one of Europe’s last undisturbed wildernesses, recognized widely for its beauty and environmental significance. It is home to endangered eagles and other bird species, orchids, lynxes, wolves, elk, wild boars, otters and beavers. When the plans of building Via Baltica Expressway through the unique and unspoilt areas of Rospuda Valley was established, Małgorzata Górska started her campaign in order to urge the politicians to change the plans. In 2002 she galvanized a coalition of activists and organizations, including WWF Poland, Greenpeace, the Polish Green Network and the Polish Society for Protection of Birds. She was a co-organizer of the public movement, during which people wore a green ribbon to show support for her ideas. Małgorzata Górska was active in the media, she gave interviews and took part in numerous debates. Her activities were often a topic for magazine and newspaper articles.http://www.goldmanprize.org/recipient/malgorzata-gorska/ When Poland joined the European Union in 2004, the Rospuda Valley became a protected area thanks to the Natura 2000 programme. However, her negotiations with the Polish government still did not bring the awaited result. In 2007 the European Commission transferred the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. At last, the European Parliament prepared a report on the topic. At the same time, Polish courts announced on three occasions that the planned route is not compatible with Polish Law.http://www.wwf.pl/?4803/ekologiczny-nobel-dla- magorzaty-gorskiej After eight years of fighting, in March 2009, the Polish government declared that the route would be changed and would not intersect with the Rospuda Valley. Despite the original aim having been achieved, Małgorzata Górska did not stop there. A change of route was needed so as not to intrude on the protected areas of Knyszyn Primeval Forest, the Biebrza Marshes and the Augustów Primeval Forest. Eventually, on 20 October 2009 a rerouting was planned for these controversial route sections and these terrains were saved from destruction.http://ec.europa.eu/environment/archives/greenweek2010/content/malgorzata- gorska.html  Application to the Goldman Environmental Prize and the ceremony In 2010, Manana Kochladze, who is associated with Bankwatch and is the winner of the 2004 Goldman Environmental Prize, nominated Małgorzata Górska to that year's Prize.

Early life Woodward was born in Tenterfield, New South Wales, on 8 October 1885 to a pioneering family of Scottish ancestry who had been among the first settlers in the district. He was educated at public schools and for two years at Newington College (1903–04).Newington College Register of Past Students 1863–1998 (Syd, 1999) pp 220 First World War Woodward was made an acting captain on 23 October 1916.

The mines had been earlier laid by the 3rd Canadian Tunnelling Company. At the start of the Battle of Messines, on 7 June 1917, Woodward had the duty of detonating the two mines. Post-war life On 3 September 1920, Woodward married Marjorie Moffat Waddell. They had a daughter and two sons. Woodward later had a distinguished civil mining career.

Owing to the infantry advance being checked, the position on the forward road became very involved.

Football career Stansbridge was born in Southampton and attended Regents Park School. In 1932, he was a member of the Southampton Schools team which won the English Schools Trophy. In May 1936, he joined Southampton as an amateur, signing a professional contract a few months later. He developed into a strong reliable 'keeper, although he spent most of his career at The Dell as a deputy, first to Sam Warhurst and later to Ian Black. Stansbridge made his \\"Saints\\" debut in the final match of the 1937–38 season, when he conceded four goals at Plymouth Argyle. Despite this, he started the following season as the first-choice keeper, but after three defeats he lost his place to Warhurst and only made two further appearances before the outbreak of war brought football to an end. During World War II, Stansbridge joined the Royal Army Medical Corps, playing as a guest for Rotherham United and Swansea Town. At the Battle of Dunkirk, Stansbridge courageously stayed behind to tend to injured troops rather than be evacuated and was captured by the enemy, spending the remainder of the war as a Prisoner of war in Poland. In 1945, he returned to Southampton and was re-engaged by his home-town club, appearing four times in League South matches as well as in all four matches played in the 1945–46 FA Cup tournament. On the re-commencement of League football in 1946, Stansbridge was once again second- choice, this time behind George Ephgrave, who had played for Aston Villa before the war. Stansbridge and Ephgrave competed for the No. 1 jersey over the next season and a half until Ian Black was signed in December 1947. Although Ephgrave left the club in the summer of 1948, Black's form meant that Stansbridge only made four further first-team appearances up to the summer of 1950, during which time Southampton narrowly missed out on promotion to the First Division three seasons in a row. Black moved to Fulham in July 1950, with Northern Irish international Hugh Kelly joining the Saints in exchange. Stansbridge, now in his early thirties, had dropped down the \\"pecking order\\", with manager Sid Cann preferring the young Eddie Thomas when Kelly was unavailable, before signing John Christie in January 1951. With Fred Kiernan being signed in October 1951, Southampton now had four professional goalkeepers on their books and Stansbidge was restricted to reserve team football, before retiring in the 1953 close season. His career as a player at Southampton spanned 17 years, of which six were interrupted by war; during this period, Stansbridge was restricted to 52 first-team appearances, but remained loyal to his hometown club, providing sterling cover whenever called upon. Later career After his professional career was over, Stansbridge made a few appearances for Basingstoke Town and found employment at the Southampton Sports Centre as a groundsman.

The majority of style guides that use a Latin-derived alphabet as a language base now prescribe or recommend the use of a single space after the concluding punctuation of a sentence.; Background Historical style guides before the 20th century typically indicated that wider spaces were to be used between sentences.University of Chicago Press 1911 The Chicago Manual of Style. p. 101. Standard word spaces were about one-third of an em space, but sentences were to be divided by a full em-space. With the arrival of the typewriter in the late 19th century, style guides for writers began diverging from printer's manuals, indicating that writers should double-space between sentences. This held for most of the 20th century until the computer began replacing the typewriter as the primary means of creating text. In the 1990s, style guides reverted to recommending a single-space between sentences. However, instead of a slightly larger sentence space, style guides simply indicated a standard word space. This is now the convention for publishers. Style guides are important to writers since \\"virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication.\\"Stevenson 2005. p. viii. Comprehensive style guides, such as the Oxford Style Manual in the United Kingdom and style guides developed by the American Psychological Association, and the Modern Language Association in the United States, provide standards for a wide variety of writing, design, and English language topics—such as grammar, punctuation, and typographic conventions—and are widely used regardless of profession. Many style guides do not provide guidance on sentence spacing. In some cases, the spacing of the volume or work itself provides an indication on the recommendation for usage of sentence spacing.* A lack of guidance on sentence spacing is also notable for style guides in languages which did not adopt double sentence spacing to accommodate the mechanical limitations of the typewriter, and which conform to the current convention for published work, single sentence spacing.Felici 2003. p. 81; Strizver 2010; ; ; Williams 2003. p. 14. Most language guides for languages with prescriptive guidance provided by an academy also do not provide advice on sentence spacing.  Language guides  Some languages have academies that set language rules. Their publications typically address orthography and grammar as opposed to matters of typography. Style guides are less relevant for these languages since their academies set prescriptive rules. For example, the Académie française publishes the Dictionnaire de l'Académie française for French speakers worldwide. French is spoken in 57 countries and territories throughout the world, including Europe, North America, and Francophone Africa. Qu'est-ce que la Francophonie? Although the 1992 edition does not provide guidance on sentence spacing, its text is single sentence spaced throughoutconsistent with historical French spacing. The German language manual Empfehlungen des Rats für Deutsche Rechtschreibung, or \\"Recommendations of the Council for German Orthography\\" (2006), does not address sentence spacing. However, the manual itself uses one space after terminal punctuation. This is likely because the double-space convention was not prescribed in historical German language guides. Additionally, the Duden, the German language dictionary most commonly used in Germany, indicates that double sentence spacing is an error. The Duden was the primary orthography and language guide in Germany until the German orthography reform of 1996 created a multinational council for German orthography for German-speaking countriescomposed of experts from Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. The current version of the Duden reflects the most recent opinions of this council. The Spanish language is similar. The most important body within the Association of Spanish Language Academies, the Real Academia Española, publishes the Diccionario de la Lengua Española, which is viewed as prescriptive for the Spanish language worldwide. The 1999 edition does not provide sentence spacing guidance, but is itself single sentence-spaced.  International style guides  The European Union's Interinstitutional Style Guide indicates that single sentence spacing is to be used in all European Union publications, encompassing 23 languages. This manual is \\"obligatory\\" for all those in the EU who are involved in preparing EU documents and works . It is intended to encompass 23 languages within the European Union . For the English language, the European Commission's English Style Guide states that sentences are always single-spaced. The Style manual for authors, editors and printers (6th edn, 2002), sponsored by the Australian Government, stipulates that only one space is used after \\"sentence-closing punctuation\\", and that \\"Programs for word processing and desktop publishing offer more sophisticated, variable spacing, so this practice of double spacing is now avoided because it can create distracting gaps on a page.\\" National languages not covered by an authoritative language academy typically have multiple style guides—which may not all discuss sentence spacing. This is the case in the United Kingdom. However, the Oxford Style Manual (2003) and the Modern Humanities Research Association's MHRA Style Guide (2002), state that only single spacing should be used.; In Canada, both the English and French language sections of the Canadian Style, A Guide to Writing and Editing (1997), prescribe single sentence spacing. ; In the United States, many style guides—such as The Chicago Manual of Style (2003)—allow only single sentence spacing. ; ; A comprehensive style guide for general and academic use in Italy, Il Nuovo Manuale di Stile (2009), The style guide itself is single sentence spaced. does not address sentence spacing, but the Guida di Stile Italiano (2010), the official guide for Microsoft translation, tells users to use single sentence spacing \\"instead of the double spacing used in the United States\\". U.S. government style guides Since 1895, the United States Government Publishing Office (GPO) and its predecessors has been authorized by statute to \\"determine the form and style\\" of government publications. Quoting (originally chapter 23, § 51, , enacted January 12, 1895). The 1959 edition of the United States Government Printing Office Style Manual prescribed an em space, equivalent to two word spaces, between sentences. The 1967 edition, however, states: \\"To conform with trade practice, a single justification space (close spacing) will be used between sentences.\\" Subsequent editions of the government's style manual have continued to prescribe a single word space between sentences: \\"A single justified word space will be used between sentences (key one space when typing). This applies to all types of composition.\\" General and academic style guides The 2003 edition of the Oxford Style Manual combined the Oxford Guide to Style (first published as Hart's Rules in 1893) and the Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors (\\"defines the language of the entire English-speaking world, from North America to South Africa, from Australia and New Zealand to the Caribbean\\"). It states, \\"In text, use only a single word space after all sentence punctuation.\\" The Chicago Manual of Style is a comprehensive and widely used style manual for American English writing, and has been called the \\"standard of the book publishing industry\\". The 16th edition, published in 2010, states, \\"Like most publishers, Chicago advises leaving a single character space, not two spaces, between sentences ... and this recommendation applies to both the manuscript and the published work.\\"University of Chicago Press, The Chicago Manual of Style 2003. p. 61. Chicago provides further guidance as follows: > Punctuation and space—one space or two? In typeset matter, one space, not > two should be used between two sentences—whether the first ends in a period, > a question mark, an exclamation point, or a closing quotation mark or > parenthesis.University of Chicago Press, The Chicago Manual of Style 2010. > p. 308. The Turabian Style, published as the Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, is widely used in academic writing. The 7th Edition, published in 2007, stipulates that the use of periods, question marks, and exclamation points as \\"terminal punctuation\\" to end a sentence should be followed by a single space. Until the early 2000s, the Modern Language Association (MLA) left room for its adherents to single or double sentence space. In 2008, it modified its position on sentence spacing to the following: > In an earlier era, writers using a typewriter commonly left two spaces after > a period, a question mark, or an exclamation point. Publications in the > United States today usually have the same spacing after concluding > punctuation marks as between words on the same line. Since word processors > make available the same fonts used by typesetters for printed works, many > writers, influenced by the look of typeset publications, now leave only one > space after a concluding punctuation mark. In addition, some publishers' > guidelines for preparing a manuscript's electronic files ask professional > authors to type only the spaces that are to appear in print. Because it is > increasingly common for manuscripts to be prepared with a single space after > all concluding punctuation marks, this spacing is recommended and shown in > the examples in this manual.Modern Language Association 2008. p. 99. Scientific style guides = APA style = The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, also known as APA style, is a widely used style guide that is favored by the social sciences in the United States. Although 2009 saw a number of changes and reversals for certain aspects of its style recommendations,Although earlier editions of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association provide for the use of a single space following the terminal punctuation of a sentence, the widely criticized 6th Edition, published in 2009, changed the convention to two spaces. (American Psychological Association, Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association 6th Edition. American Psychological Association . p. 88.) For the controversy surrounding the First Printing of the 6th edition of the APA's Publication Manual, see, for example, Tara D. Hudson, \\"The APA's Reputation Management in the Wake of the Error-Laden 6th Edition of its Ubiquitous Publication Manual\\", in Crisis! Communication: Theories and Practice. 25 October 2009. Accessed 31 January 2010., and Customer Reviews: Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association Sixth Edition, Amazon.com. Accessed 31 January 2010. Soon after the publication of the 6th Edition, the American Psychological Association published nineteen pages of corrections for academic papers online, (see American Psychological Association, Corrected Sample Papers, Accessed 31 January 2010.) as well as eight pages of online corrections called \\"Errors in APA Style Rules\\" prior to issuing a corrected second printing of the 6th Edition of the Publication Manual in late 2009. the current guidance from the American Psychological Association (APA) as of July 2009 is a recommendation to use two spaces for draft manuscripts and work. This recommendation does not apply \\"to the published, or final version, of a work\\", where the spacing convention is determined by the publication designer. Since U.S. publishers of print media typically use the single space convention, this means that drafts prepared with the double-space convention would be converted to the single space convention for final publication. Fogarty 2008. p. 85. The APA also notes, \\"the usual convention for published works remains one space after each period\\", and that the practice of publishers removing extra spaces from a manuscript prior to publication \\"is a routine part of the manuscript preparation process here at the APA\\". ; The vacillations by the American Psychological Association have been criticized. See for example, Lloyd and Hallahan 2009. \\"The sixth edition (American Psychological Association, 2009) features many changes from the one issued in 2001 (let alone those issued earlier). Each time that the Manual changes, some of these academics wonder, \\"Why the heck was that done?\\" [...] The 2009 edition brings some sensible changes, and some that make folks scratch their aging heads. Principal among the head-scratching items is this one: Why, after requiring those of us who (because we learned to type on typewriters using fixed-width fonts such as courier) mastered hitting the space bar twice at the end of sentences and then learning to drop the extra space after the end-of- sentence punctuation (see American Psychological Association, 1994, 2001), are we now directed to reintroduce the additional space\\"? (Video follows after the text) = Other scientific style guides = The 2006 edition of the Style Manual for Political Science, published by the American Political Science Association, states that \\"One space, not two, should follow all punctuation that ends a sentence.\\" The 2nd edition of the American Sociological Association Style Guide, published by the American Sociological Association (ASA), provides guidance to use \\"only one space after all punctuation–periods and colons should not be followed by two spaces.\\" The ASA style guide encompasses all ASA publications including \\"eight journals\\", \\"various directories\\" and other \\"substantive, academic, teaching, and career publications\\" (i). Legal style guides In the United States, there are a variety of legal writing style guides available. According to The Chicago Manual of Style, The Bluebook is the \\"most widely used [legal] citation guide\\" in the United States.University of Chicago Press, Chicago Manual of Style 2003. p. 728. The 2006 version of this guide to legal citations does not directly address spacing after the terminal punctuation of a sentence, although it does provide actual citation examples from court documents—some of which are single-spaced and some of which are double sentence spaced. A key statement in this guide, which addresses possible preferential differences between courts that require document submissions, notes that \\"Many state and federal courts promulgate local citation rules, which take precedence over Bluebook rules in documents submitted to those courts.\\" Various other legal style guides provide non-committal positions on this topic, such as the 2006 version of the ALWD Citation Manual, which has been \\"widely adopted by law- school writing courses\\".; University of Chicago Press, The Chicago Manual of Style 2003. p. 728. This guide provides limited coverage on punctuation, referring readers to other style manuals that prescribe single sentence spacing.ALWD 2006. pps. 7,9. The AWLD Citation Manual refers users to the United States Government Office Style Manual, The Chicago Manual of Style ... or The Redbook: A Manual on Legal Style for \\"additional guidance on matters of style, punctuation and other writing conventions\\". These three style guides all indicate that a single space is proper between sentences. The Guide to Legal Writing Style (2007) also does not directly address this topic. Some legal style guides do provide guidance on sentence spacing, such as the 2009 edition of the AP Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law, and the 2006 edition of The Redbook: A Manual on Legal Style—both of which state that a single space follows terminal punctuation. The AP Stylebook indicates that adherents should \\"Use a single space after a period at the end of a sentence.\\" Garner 2006. p. 83. The Redbook directs users to use \\"one space between words and one space after punctuation marks (including colons and periods)\\". The Redbook provides further details on the use of this convention: \\"The custom during the reign of the typewriter was to insert two spaces between sentences\\" due to the use by typewriters of monospaced fonts that are not effective at creating readable text. It indicates that users could continue the use of two spaces if using a typewriter \\"or the Courier font\\", and espouses the advantages of widely available proportional fonts which are degraded by the use of two spaces after terminal punctuation.Garner 2006. p. 83. Of the legal style guides listed in this section, all use proportional fonts with a single space between sentences in their text.The only exceptions, as noted, are the actual citation examples in the Bluebook, some of which are double-spaced.  Professional style guides  A number of style guides exist to provide writing standards for various professions. For example, the 2009 edition of the Associated Press Stylebook calls for a single space following the terminal punctuation of a sentence.Associated Press 2009. p. 361. The Associated Press represents over 300 locations worldwide. For copyeditors, the 2nd edition of the Copyeditor's Handbook: A Guide for Book Publishing and Corporate Communications, published in 2006, states that users should \\"delete any extra word spacing before or after punctuation marks\\" and that \\"The conventions are: One space follows a sentence-ending punctuation mark.\\"Einsohn 2006. pps. 113. Multiple style guides exist within the United States health care industry. The 10th Edition (2007) of the AMA Manual of Style is a comprehensive work which includes a separate section on typography. Although the manual does not provide specific guidance regarding sentence spacing, it provides examples of single-spaced journal pages used for American Medical Association (AMA) publications to show standard AMA elements of design. The 2007 edition (10th Ed.of the Health Professional's Style Manual also does not directly address this topic—referring users to specific style manuals such as The Chicago Manual of Style, the APA style manual, and the Elements of Style.Fondiller 2007. p. 135. The Gregg Reference Manual is a style manual intended for business professionals. The 1985 edition simply indicated that two spaces were to be used following terminal punctuation. The most recent edition, published in 2005, provides detailed guidance for sentence spacing. Its general guidance indicates that, \\"The standard for proportional fonts has always been the same: use only one space between the period and the start of the next sentence\\" and \\"now that the standards of desktop publishing predominate, the use of only one space after the period is quite acceptable with monospace fonts.\\"Sabin 2005. p. 5. However, although the author states that one space is correct in draft manuscripts for typesetting and most other instances, certain specific cases might benefit from additional space between sentences.Sabin 2005. p. 5–6, 10, 12–13, 91. For example, \\"As a general rule, use one space at the end of a sentence, but switch to two spaces whenever you feel a stronger visual break between sentences is needed.\\" The manual identifies specific instances when only one space is to be used between sentences such as \\"If you are preparing manuscript on a computer and the file will be used for typesetting, use only one space and ignore the issue of visual appearance.\\" The manual indicates that writers should also \\"Use only one space if the text will have justified margins,\\" and \\"If the manuscript has already been typed with two spaces at the end of every sentence, use the Replace function to change two spaces to one space throughout.\\" The author adds the caveat that in certain instances a writer may want to use two spaces between sentences. The examples given are: when one space \\"may not provide a clear visual break between sentences\\", if an abbreviation is used at the end of a sentence, or when some very small proportional fonts (such as 10-point Times New Roman) are used. The manual clearly places an emphasis on the use of white space to create a pleasing document by noting spacing rules that differ from current norms such as the use of two spaces before opening a parenthesis, after closing quotation marks, and after opening single quotation marks inside of sentences.Sabin 2005. p. 5-6, 10, 12-13, 91. There are a variety of guides used by screenwriters. Most works identify the Courier 12-point font as the industry \\"standard\\" for manuscripts, such as the Screenwriter's Bible: A Complete Guide to Writing, Formatting, and Selling Your Script.Trotter 1998. p. 112. \\"Here's what is wanted: A good old fashioned PICA (for typewriters) or Courier 12-point, 10-pitch font with a ragged right margins. ... All of the examples in this format guidebook are in Courier so that they appear exactly the way they would appear in a script ... Why all the fuss over a font? Because the 10-pitch font is easier on the eyes of industry people who read dozens of scripts every week. It also retains the \\"one page equals one minute screen time\\" industry standard\\"; Trottier 2005. p. 125. Some works on screenwriting—such as Screenplay: Writing the Picture—indicate that proportional fonts may be used though Courier is preferred.Russin 2003. p. 17. The authors also state that \\"Courier 12-point is preferred, although New York, Bookman, and Times will do.\\" Moira Anderson Allen suggests that publishers are more interested in readable fonts as opposed to maintaining a monospaced font standard.Allen 2001. \\"Amazingly, people get into heated discussions over what types of fonts editors prefer. Some folks claim that all editors want manuscripts in Courier (the font that looks like your typewriter font). Lately, some editors and writers have come to prefer Arial. So what do editors really want? The truth is, most editors really don't care, as long as the font is readable. (I can state this with confidence, having done a survey of about 500 editors; 90% expressed \\"no preference\\" with regard to font.) Very few editors will reject your manuscript because it happens to be in New Century Schoolbook, Palatino, or Times Roman. Generally, it's best to use a 12-point font size, and to choose a font that doesn't 'squinch' letters together too closely. The rationale for Courier dates back to the days when editors did an eyeball 'guesstimate' of line lengths to determine exactly how much space a piece would fill in on the printed page. Courier is a 'fixed-space' font, meaning that each letter takes up exactly the same amount of space. This made it easier to estimate how an article would appear when typeset. Today, however, very few editors need to do this (or even remember that it was done).\\" All of these works illustrate single sentence spacing in their manuscript examples, regardless of font type. Other style guides There are various works that provide design guidance for websites. The 2008 edition of the Web Style Guide does not discuss spacing after the terminal punctuation of a sentence, although it provides a chapter on typography. In this section, the authors assert \\"the basic rules of typography are much the same for both web pages and conventional print documents.\\" Although the guide does not specifically recommend against the use of monospaced fonts, only proportional fonts are presented as \\"common screen fonts\\" and those \\"designed for the screen\\".Lynch and Horton 2008. p. 219. Finally, although HTML ignores additional spacing after the terminal punctuation of a sentence, the authors caution against custom fonts and typefaces because most users' browsers will default to a font defined by their operating system.Lynch and Horton 2008. pps. 217–218. Users can force HTML to recognize the extra space by inputting a formula—in the case of a double word space, by using the characters: \\"&nbsp;&nbsp;\\". Character entity references in HTML 4 A number of style guides do not provide guidance on this convention, especially those that are smaller in scope and rely on other, more comprehensive style guides to provide a framework. However, some of these style guides are well-known, including the 4th edition of Strunk and White's The Elements of Style, a widely used general style guide, which is silent in reference to typography and spacing between sentences. Other U.S. style guides that do not address sentence spacing include, Scientific Style And Format: The CSE Manual for Authors, Editors, And Publishers, the AMA Manual of Style, the Wall Street Journal Essential Guide to Business Style and Usage (2002), the New York Times Manual of Style and Usage, REA's Handbook of English Grammar, Style, and Writing (2009), and the American Sociological Society Style Guide (2007). In the United Kingdom, the Economist Style Guide (2005), Guardian Style Guide, and the Times Style Guide also provide no guidance on this topic.; ; All of these guides themselves use single sentence spacing in their text.

He worked mainly as professor at Upstate Medical Center in State University of New York, Syracuse, and as Director of Orthopedic Surgery at the Veterans Administration Hospital, Syracuse, New York. Becker was known for his work in bioelectricity and leading the early opposition to high-voltage power lines. He has been named as one of the most influential figures in the area of anti-EMF activism. Early life Becker was born May 31, 1923 in River Edge, New Jersey to Otto Julius Becker and Elizabeth Blanck. He earned a bachelor's degree from Gettysburg College in 1946 and a medical degree from the New York University School of Medicine in 1948. Becker was an intern at New York's Bellevue Hospital, then completed a residency Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital in Hanover, New Hampshire. Serving in the United States Army from 1942 to 1946, during World War II. Becker also served from 1951 to 1953 in the United States Army Medical Corps. On September 14, 1946, Becker married Lillian Janet Moller in New Canaan, Connecticut. They resided in New York City and Valley Stream, New York before settling in Syracuse in the late 1950s. There, Becker joined the SUNY Upstate Medical Center. Research Becker has been credited with furthering the awareness of the scientific community to the study of electric potentials in organisms. His work showed that living organisms and animals show a direct current of electric charge which is measurable from their body surface. In the 1960s Becker's research also showed that living bone can piezoelectrically generate electric potentials, which led to work on using electricity in the treatment of ununited fractures. Ultimately, however, the use of electrotherapy for increasing bone healing has not been shown to be effective. Becker believed that extrasensory perception could occur from extremely low frequency (ELF) waves. Awards In 1964, Becker received the William S. Middleton Award from the research and development agency of the United States Veterans Health Administration. The official research history of the SUNY Upstate Medical Center also states that Becker was awarded \\"the Nicolas Andry Award by the American Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons in 1979\\".SUNY Upstate Department of Orthopedic Surgery Research History Later life In the years prior to his death, Becker lived in Lowville, New York.

Toowoomba Grammar has a non-selective enrolment policy and currently caters for approximately 1,150 students from Prep to Year 12, including 300 boarders from Years 5 to 12. Some of the Toowoomba Grammar School buildings are listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. History Toowoomba Grammar School, sketch prior to construction, 1875 Main school building, circa 1902 Hand coloured postcard of the main school building Main school building, 1994 The school was founded in 1875 as a consequence of the Grammar Schools Act of 1860 passed by Queensland's first parliament. The original building was designed by Willoughby Powell. The foundation stone was laid on 5 August 1875; it was to be laid by the Governor of Queensland, William Cairns but due to his illness, Justice Charles Lilley performed the ceremony. A bottle (time capsule) was placed in a cavity in the stone containing two local newspapers, coins of the realm and a parchment commemorating the event and listing the names of the foundation trustees: * James Taylor, Member of the Queensland Legislative Council (treasurer) * S. G. Stephens (secretary) * G. H. Davenport * John Frederick McDougall, Member of the Queensland Legislative Council * William Graham, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Darling Downs * Edward Wilmot Pechey, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Aubigny * G. W. Elliott, P.M. the architect and contractor: *Willoughby Powell (architect) * John Garget (contractor) and the aldermen of Toowoomba: *Robert Aland (mayor) * John Garget *James Campbell * Daniel Donavon * Henry Spiro *Malcolm Geddes * Richard Godsall * R. J. Barry * J. Reuter The building was completed in 1876. It was officially opened on Thursday 1 February 1877. Affiliations The school has been a member of the Great Public Schools' Association Inc (GPS) since 1920. It is also affiliated with the Australian Boarding Schools Association (ABSA), the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), and Independent Schools Queensland (ISQ). Curriculum The school uses the Queensland Curriculum throughout its education with the school broken down into two categories: * Junior School (Prep – Year 6) * Senior School (Year 7 – Year 12) Students from Junior have set subjects which are decided upon by the class teacher whilst students who are in Year 7 and 8 move between classes and are exposed to various subject selections the school offers. During Year 9, a student can select three of their eight subjects as electives, while in Year 11, they are allowed to choose four electives and select their strands in their core subjects. Activities The Student Representative Committee is available for any boys in years 8–10 to join who meet with the headmaster once a term to represent and discuss issues in relation to the school's day-to-day operation. They also put on small events such as sports days from the younger boys in the Senior School Community. Students may also be asked to represent a particular activity at the school and provide feedback on the opinion and operation of this activity. These students provide a liaison between the house pastoral care system and the school prefects. They hold larger events for the entire school community such as the Annual Grammar's Got Talent Talent Competition. Boys also have the opportunity to be members of the school's Spirit Squad, which is a group of boys involved in maintaining the student body's morale and spirit for the school. They lead the school in many war cries as well as other events such as organising the Prefects' Assemblies throughout the year. Houses The school began with a system of nine houses. Originally, these were separate boarding and day houses, with the Junior School utilising the Senior School houses soon after its formation in 1997. These houses have since merged or closed. For consistency and to promote House Spirit, the Junior School maintains the same five houses as the Senior School. Various leadership groups within each house exist, such as a prefects system very similar to that used in British Public Schools. Under the school's colours program, students are encouraged to have their half colours by the time they complete Year 10, and they are required for prefectship applications. =Existing houses= Taylor House Taylor House was named in honour of the Hon. James Taylor, the first chairman of the board of trustees at the school. In the first colonial parliament, he represented the Western Downs in the Legislative Council and then later as Mayor of Toowoomba. He was well known for his contributions to the Benevolent Society and the hospital, as well as being the first president of the School of Arts and his promotion of the foundation of the Darling Downs Agriculture Society. As well as Active Development of the Clifford Park Race Way. Prior to 1992, Taylor House was the boarding house for the year-nine students at the school, and in 2004 combined with Gibson House to form a combined day/boarding house. This boarding house is the smallest of the six currently on campus with plans for a new boarding house to be situated on the Parents and Friends' Oval, and the boarding house be renovated into the new \\"Engineering and Vocational Training Centre\\". The House's colour is black.Toowooomba Grammar School Diary Boyce House Boyce House takes its name from an old boy of the school, Mr Leslie Atherton George Boyce. Mr Boyce entered the school in 1911 as a Scholar of the State. In 1915 he entered the AIF and served in France, later to be wounded in 1917 and hence awarded the Military Cross for \\"conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty when in command of his platoon during an attack\\". On returning to Toowoomba, he became the Chief Executive Officer of the Toowoomba Foundry, remaining as the Director until 1976. Prior to 1992, Boyce House was home to Year 10 students and in 2004 along with the other houses was amalgamated with Henderson. The boarding house exists next to the Margaret School entrance and is planned to be renovated into the \\"Culture Centre\\" focusing on all walks of artistic excellence on campus. With a new boarding house to be constructed alongside the new Taylor Boarding House. Within the boarding house it maintains four internal dormitories, these being Woodward, Fortescue, Robertson, and Clownes in Honour of famous Old Boys who gave their lives in the Great War and World War II. The house's Colour is Maroon. Mackintosh House Mackintosh House is the oldest of the schools houses, and is named after the school's inaugural headmaster, Mr John Mackintosh, who was appointed as headmaster in 1876. Born in Scotland in 1836, he excelled academically at Edinburgh University before sailing to Australia in 1861. He became immortalised at the school after he was killed when he was thrown from his horse while on a riding expedition to Helidon below the range. Mackintosh House was the home to the year-12 boys prior to 1992, and in 2004 merged with Chauvel to form its combined house. It was originally situated in the two upper floors of the school's original building. In 2011 the decision was made to move them out of this facility and renovate it to Staff Offices. As a result of this, the Mackintosh House is situated in the newest boarding house on campus. Located in between the existing Taylor and Boyce Houses. The house's colour is red. Groom House Groom House holds the highest prestige after being named after Sir Littleton Groom. In 1901 Sir Littleton was elected as the first federal representative of the seat of Groom (named after him, although he held the seat of Darling Downs) and later the first speaker of the house. He then held this seat for 36 years. Sir Littleton is listed on the Old Boys' Wall of Achievement. Prior to 1992, Groom House was home to Year 8s, and was merged with Freshney in 2004. The boarding house from Groom House is currently located on the lower floor of the original Stephens House (which was originally a two-story boarding house) when the Junior School occupied its original boarding house to create Corfe House. This boarding facility is located on the Herries Street side of the campus and is in a traditional red brick construction. It is one of few boarding houses where the boarding housemaster lives in the building itself and not a separate detached building. The house's colour is green. Stephens House Stephens House was named after the undisputed founder of Toowoomba Grammar School Mr Samuel George Stephens. Mr Stephens was born in Wales and having been educated at the School for Captains' Sons, joined the Merchant Navy. On one of his adventures, the ship was wrecked on the Victorian Coast near Melbourne. He eventually moved to Toowoomba where he and his wife built a house in Herries Street, where he then raised six daughters. He was the honorary secretary of the first board of trustees, and his oldest son Alfred was the first boy to be enrolled at the school. Prior to 1992, Stephens House was the home for Year-11 students, and further in 2004 was merged with the Day House Partridge to form a combined house. Located in the same boarding house as Groom House, Stephens House also has a boarding house master that lives inside the boarding house rather than a detached building. The house's colour is royal blue. =Amalgamated houses= # Chaulk (removed 1997) # Gibson (removed 2004) # Henderson (removed 2004) # Chauvel (removed 2004) # Freshney (removed 2004) # Partridge (removed 2004) # Baynes (Junior School) (removed 2015) # Lavers (Junior School) (removed 2015) # Parkinson (Junior School) (removed 2015)  Headmasters  J.

It was part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included with the rest of the municipality in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region.Ljubljana municipal site Name The name Mali Lipoglav literally means 'little Lipoglav' (in contrast to the neighboring village of Veliki Lipoglav 'big Lipoglav'). The name was first attested in 1169 as Luppoglau (and as Lipoglaw in 1256, Luppoglau in 1321, Luppoglaw in 1467, and Lippa in 1763–1787). The name appears to be a compound of lipa 'linden' + glava 'hilltop', supposedly meaning 'hilltop covered with linden trees.' However, the early attestations of the name indicate that it is actually derived from *Lupoglav, presumably from *lupъ 'bare, exposed', thus meaning 'bare hilltop'.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimološki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Založba ZRC, p. 235. In the past the German name was Kleinlipoglau. History The remains of a prehistoric Celtic trench were discovered at the Janez Bozja farm. Mali Lipoglav became the seat of a parish in 1782. A part-time school operated in Mali Lipoglav from 1865 until 1910, when a regular school was established. Lessons took place in the rectory until 1938, when a school building was established. The school building was burned in 1942 and rebuilt in 1946. Italian forces burned one house and three outbuildings in the village on 23 March 1942.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971.

The volume is bound in two parts (Romans–Colossians, 1 Thessalonians–Acts), much of the text being lost. The nomina sacra are written in an abbreviated way. At the end of the Pauline epistles, and at the end of the Acts (see image), are two important Arabic colophons, in which the pedigree of the manuscript is given. From these we learn that both portions of this manuscript were written A. Mart. 1024, i.e. A.D. 1308, by Abu Said ben Said al Dar ibn Abu al Fadl, the Christian. They were copied, however, from a previous manuscript in the handwriting of the patriarch Abba Gabriel and bearing the date A. Mart. 966, i.e. A.D 1250.

Princeton University, 2009 Since retiring in 1999, Gossman has resumed his undergraduate studies of German culture. He has written a number of articles on aspects of 19th-century German art and cultural politics, including several studies of the Nazarene movement. On the Nazarenes, he has authored the study \\"Unwilling Moderns: The Nazarene Painters of the Nineteenth Century\\"Gossman, Lionel. \\"Unwilling Moderns: The Nazarene Painters of the Nineteenth Century.\\" Nineteenth-Century Art Worldwide. 2.3 (Autumn 2003). and the book \\"The Making of a Romantic Icon: The Religious Context of Friedrich Overbeck's 'Italia und Germania.'\\"\\"Current Publications.\\" American Philosophical Society. Annotated bibliography Along with articles on a wide range of topics, as of April 2010 Gossman has published 14 books. Here are summaries and reviews of some of his best-known books: *Orpheus Philologus: Bachofen versus Mommsen on the Study of Antiquity (1983) () Though the great German classical scholar Theodor Mommsen was probably unaware of it, he was the object of the passionate and enduring hatred of J. J. Bachofen, an obscure Swiss philologist in the provincial city of Basle. Bachofen, not well known in the English-speaking world, is mentioned by anthropologists for his contribution to the popular 19th-century theory of \\"matriarchy\\", and by classicists such as George Derwent Thomson for his contributions to the study of Greek myth and tragedy.\\"Description: Orpheus Philologus: Bachofen versus Mommsen on the Study of Antiquity.\\" Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, Transactions 73:5 (1983).\\" Diane Publishing Co.: American Philosophical Society. Arnaldo Momigliano writes in The Journal of Modern History: *Towards a Rational Historiography (1989) () Gossman maintains that underlying the argument that historiography cannot be subsumed under a poetics or a rhetoric is a larger claim, namely that a wide range of activities, from literary criticism, through legal debate, theology, ethics, politics, psychology, and medicine to the natural sciences, all constitute rational practices, even if there is considerable variation in the degree of formalism and rigor and in the type of argument most commonly employed in each of these different fields of inquiry. Hence Gossman emphasizes the practice or process of doing history rather than the product. What appeals to him in the idea of reason as a practice is its open, liberal, and democratic character. Historiography as a rational practice supposes a community of participants rather than the \\"anomie\\" of a world in which every man is his own historian that appears to be implied by privileging the historical \\"text.\\" \\"Towards a Rational Historiography; Transactions, American Philosophical Society (vol. 79, Part 3).\\" Diane Publishing Co.: American Philosophical Society. Edward Berenson writes in his book \\"The Trial of Madame Caillaux:\\" *Between History and Literature (1990) () Drawing on English, German and French scholarship, the essays in this volume illuminate the many facets of the problematic relationship between history and literature, and show how each discipline both challenges and undermines the other's absolutist pretensions.\\"Between History and Literature.\\" Harvard University Press Includes Gossman's seminal study on French historian Augustin Thierry (\\"Augustin Thierry and Liberal Historiography\\")Gossman, Lionel. \\"Augustin Theirry and Liberal Historiography.\\" Middletown, Connecticut: Wesleyan University Press, 1976. and two important essays on French historian Jules Michelet. Ceri Crossley writes in the journal French History: *Basel in the Age of Burckhardt: A Study in Unseasonable Ideas (2000) () After co-teaching with Carl Schorske an undergraduate seminar on the civic culture of 19th century Basel, Switzerland, Gossman worked on this book for 20 years. Gossman argues that the peculiar, somewhat anachronistic political and social structure of Basel made it a favorable haven for \\"untimely\\" ideas that challenged the positivism and optimistic progressivism of the time: the philosophy of Nietzsche, the historiography of Bachofen and Burckhardt, and the theology of Franz Overbeck.Gossman, \\"In the Footsteps of Giants\\", p. 29.

Hinde writes in the American Historical Review: *The Making of a Romantic Icon: The Religious Context of Friedrich Overbeck's 'Italia und Germania' (2007) () Gossman focuses on Johann Friedrich Overbeck's painting \\"Italia and Germania\\" to discuss the importance of religious conversion in Romantic thought. This book serves as a thoughtful introduction to the way of thinking of one of the most important of the Nazarene movement painters. It treats the evolution of the Nazarene artists’ preoccupation with religious issues in an engaging manner and offers a social-historical and theological context to Overbeck's painting.\\"Description: The Making of a Romantic Icon: The Religious Context of Friedrich Overbeck's 'Italia und Germania.'\\" Diane Publishing Co.: American Philosophical Society.

Heinrich Vogeler was a well-regarded Jugendstil (Art Nouveau) artist who joined the German Communist Party and later emigrated to the Soviet Union. Ludwig Roselius was a successful Bremen businessman who had made a fortune from his invention of decaffeinated coffee. What was it about the revolutionary climate following Germany's defeat in World War I that induced three such different personalities to collaborate in the production of a slim volume of poetry - entitled Gott in mir (God in Me) - about the indwelling of the divine within the human? Gossman's study provides insight into the sources and character of the \\"Nazi Conscience.\\" Gossman, Lionel. \\"Brownshirt Princess: A Study of the 'Nazi Conscience'\\" Open Book Publishers. *Hermynia Zur Mühlen. The End and the Beginning: The Book of My Life' (2010) () First published in Germany in 1929, this is a new and corrected English translation of a memoir recounting a rebellious young woman's struggle to achieve independence. Born in 1883 into a wealthy aristocratic society of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hermynia Zur Mühlen spent much of her childhood traveling in Europe and North Africa with her diplomat father. After five years on her German husband's estate in Czarist Russia, she broke with both her family and her husband and set out on a precarious career as a professional writer. She also became a convinced and passionate socialist and devoted her considerable literary talent to the propagation of socialism and the struggle against Nazism and anti-Semitism. The author of novels (most of them translated into English), short stories, and highly successful \\"proletarian\\" children's fairy tales, she also translated from French, Russian, and English (notably most of the works of Upton Sinclair) into German. Because of her outspoken opposition to National Socialism, she had to flee first Germany in 1933, then her native Austria in 1938, and seek refuge in England, where she died, virtually penniless in 1951. This edition of her memoir is accompanied by thumbnail sketches of the many individuals and events mentioned in it and thus evokes an entire vanished age. In addition, Gossman contributes a comprehensive study of Zur Mühlen's life and work in the form of a \\"Tribute\\" to a talented and unjustly neglected woman writer. *Figuring History'(2011)() In the past half-century the writing of history has been the object of much critical scrutiny on the part of literary scholars, philosophers, and historians. History painting has traditionally been an important topic in art history. The illustration of history books in contrast, has not attracted much attention. \\"Figuring History\\" is a preliminary inquiry into the changing ways in which graphics, ranging from representational images to statistical charts, have been used to enhance or illuminate historical texts. *The Passion of Max von Oppenheim: Archaeology and Intrigue in the Middle East from Wilhelm II to Hitler' (2013)() Born into a prominent German Jewish banking family, Baron Max von Oppenheim (1860-1946)was a keen amateur archaeologist and ethnographer. His discovery and excavation of Tell Halaf in Syria was a major contribution to knowledge of the ancient Middle East; his massive study of the Bedouins is still consulted by scholars today. Oppenheim was also an ardent German patriot, eager to secure for his country its \\"place in the sun.\\" Excluded by his part-Jewish ancestry from the regular German diplomatic service, he earned a reputation among the British and the French as \\"the Kaiser's spy\\" because of his intriguing with nationalist groups in Egypt and North Africa and his plan, on the outbreak of World War I, to incite Muslims under British, French, and Russian rule to a jihad against their rulers. Despite being \\"half-Jewish\\" according to the Nuremberg Laws, Oppenheim was not molested by the Nazis. In fact, he placed his knowledge of the Middle East and his contacts with Muslim leaders at the service of the regime. \\"The Passion of Max von Oppenheim\\" tells the unsettling story of one part-Jewish man's passion for his country in the face of persistent and, in his later years, genocidal anti-Semitism. Its focus is on the political attitudes of highly acculturated and wealthy German Jews in the Kaiserzeit and in the face of National Socialism. *Andre Maurois (1885-1967): Fortunes and Misfortunes of a Moderate'(2014)() Respected by his peers and hugely successful internationally in the first half of the twentieth century—in 1935 the English translation of one of his fifteen major biographies was the first book to be published in Allen Lane's pioneering Penguin paperback series (Penguin #1) -- Maurois is now hardly read. His liberal humanism, his moderate and conciliatory stance in everything from politics to his lucid and elegant writing style, his \\"politeness\\" as he put it himself, appealed in his own time to a broad educated public. As manners values, and society have changed, and unquestioning respect for a shared European cultural tradition has diminished, have the very characteristics that once ensured Maurois' popularity caused new generations of readers to find his work, when they are aware of it, outdated and of little interest? 'Jules Michelet: On History'(2014)() Three programmatic essays on history by one of the greatest of Romantic historians, interest in whose work was revived by the celebrated modern \\"Annales\\" school. The first, translated by Flora Kimmich, and the second, translated by Lionel Gossman, are available here for the first time in English translation; the third, the Preface to the 1869 edition of the Histoire de France, originally published in its first English translation by Edward K. Kaplan in 1977, has been revised by the translator for this volume. Edited and with a foreword by Lionel Gossman. Gossman continues to work on a book-length study of Heinrich Vogeler, a successful turn-of-the-century German artist and illustrator and a friend of the poet Rilke. Gossman is interested in Vogeler's transformation from a dandy and aesthete in the years before World War I into a left-wing anarchist and then Communist in the years following the war, and in his dogged search for an artistic form appropriate to his changed convictions and worldview.

Rustavi Metallurgical Plant one of Georgia’s largest industrial enterprises, is situated 30 kilometres to the south of Georgia's capital Tbilisi. The Rustavi Metallurgical Plant was founded in 1948 as the first fully integrated metallurgical complex in the South Caucasus and produced steel, hot-rolled seamless pipes and various products made of pig iron, aluminium or iron. The Plant produced seamless pipes to meet the requirements of the oil fields of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and the Middle East. Today, the Plant's new management and owners are embarking on a major program of investment and re-structuring to re-establish the company in regional markets, and expand into new global markets. The Plant is manufacturing reinforcing bars, seamless pipes, square billets, pig-iron castings, metal constructions, mechanical parts, shaped castings, granulated slag, silicon-manganese, lime and limestone. To strengthen its market position, management's first task is to increase the Plant's production capacity.

Also known as the twilight monitor or the long-tailed rock monitor, it is a member of the subgenus Odatria, and is found in the northern part of Australia in the Northern Territory and Western Australia, as well as Queensland. Specifically, its distribution extends from Mount Isa in the east to the Kimberleys in the west. Its habitat is areas of rock escarpment, and large populations may be found in small areas.  Taxonomy  A species first described in 1955 by South Australian curator Francis John Mitchell, nominating the holotype as a specimen obtained at Lake Hubert in the Northern Territory. Mitchell's specimen was the only example available, and was shot by R. R. Miller near a sandstone outcrop during the 1948 American-Australian Scientific Expedition to Arnhem Land. The new species was allied to the infrageneric classification Varanus (Odatria). Common names for the species include black-palmed and long-tailed rock monitor. The specific epithet glebopalma refers to the shiny black pads found on the undersides of their feet. Description The black-palmed rock monitor reaches a total length of just over 100 cm. The coloration of V. glebopalma on the back shows a black ground color with some light brown scales, overall the skin is reddish or gray brown. The scales form a \\"reticulated pattern at the sides or small ocelli with a black central spot on top.\\" Their tail is blackish for the first half of its length, becoming a creamy-yellow color. The top sides of the head and the limbs are black with small, light brown or cream-colored spots which \\"flow together\\". Their limbs have larger spots.  Behaviour  This varanid is secretive, eluding casual observers and poorly recorded in surveys. Varanus glebopalma is extremely timid and able to move quickly, usually hunting in daylight hours; although activity at dusk or night is noted in descriptions this is likely to be a response to disturbance by the observers. Their hunting mode is as an ambush predator. In the wild, black- palmed rock monitors prefer to eat insects, lizards, and other small vertebrates. Orthopterans, species of grasshoppers, are sought in the dry season of Australia's north and skinks make up the majority of the diet during the wet, other prey captured and consumed includes frogs. Individual range may be from 1.25 to over 7 hectares, ambushing prey on the move or foraging at narrow hiding places. A report of males avoiding another male presence is assumed to be a demonstration of territoriality, a behaviour unknown in any other varanid species.  Distribution and habitat  The distribution range of the species extends from the Kimberley, across the Top End and to the west of Queensland in the Mount Isa districts. They occur from the coast to inland regions, with an offshore population recorded at Adolphus Island. The habitat is complex rocky outcrops that provide crevices and boulders and only in association with open woodlands; despite the presence of trees in the local environment the species is not known to be arboreal. In the Yarrangguljna region of the Northern Territory the population's strongly preferred vegetation type is woodland dominated by Allosyncarpia ternata. This same habitat is occupied by another long-tailed monitor Varanus glauerti, and while the two species are closely sympatric they occupy distinct niches within this ecology. The range of habitat includes arid woodland and monsoonal forest near their strongly preferred refuge within crevices and boulders at the outskirts of sandstone escarpments and outcrops. The assessment of the IUCN work group, published in 2017, listed this species as least concern, with a population that is assumed to be stable. As a consumer of amphibians, the species is assumed to be susceptible to the advance of Rhinella marina, a poisonous introduced species known in Australia as the cane toad.

Plot 14-year-old David Morgan, the handsome and academically gifted heir to a South African business empire and fortune, learns to fly with Barney Venter, a gruff but experienced ex-airline pilot. He realises that David is \\"bird\\" – blessed with a natural flying ability. David learns quickly and soon gains his pilot's licence. After school, he opts to join the South African Air Force instead of going to university and business school. He impresses his commanding officer, the crusty Colonel Rastus Naude, who is disappointed when David decides not to accept a longer service contract and instead tries to seek out what he is meant to do. He travels widely in Europe. In Spain, he meets Debra Mordechai, an attractive young Israeli writer and university lecturer, who is traveling with her brother Joe and his fiancée Hannah. Debra rebuffs David's advances and they part on bitter terms. David is drawn to Jerusalem to find her and meets \\"The Brig\\", her father, General Mordechai, a plain-spoken pilot in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and a senior staff officer. Learning that David has much experience of flying Mirage jets, he satisfies himself of David's skills and then offers him a commission in the IDF. He accepts and is granted Israeli citizenship. He is plunged into Israel's struggle for survival. David's memories of his own (Jewish) mother and his growing passion for Debra make his involvement with this new country's cause inescapable. He and Debra set up house together. At Joe and Hannah's wedding, a terrorist attack kills Hannah and Debra is left blind. In her grief, she rebuffs David, who only finds solace in the skies. He and Joe get into a dogfight with Russian-trained Syrian fighters. Joe's aircraft is shot down and David, low on fuel and on the wrong side of the border, is forced to ditch. His jet catches fire and he is badly burned. A year later, after much plastic surgery and no longer the handsome man he was, David is forced to resign his commission on pain of a court-martial. He is now an outcast, as he had brought Israel to the brink of open war. He desperately seeks out Debra, who is now willing to accept him back, not knowing what he now looks like. They marry, despite the misgivings and anger of \\"The Brig\\" and they travel to the now virtually derelict game lodge that David's late father owned in the South African bush. Remembering all the poaching and \\"sport\\" killing that had happened there in his youth, he seeks out the game warden, Conrad Berg, and offers the whole estate as a national park to serve as a haven for animals fleeing poachers. David falls foul of a particularly ruthless poacher and in the ensuing violence, Debra is badly injured. Pregnant, she loses the baby. But the injury has affected her brain and she can now sense some colours. They travel to Cape Town to consult a top ophthalmic surgeon, who decides to operate despite David's objections. The procedure is successful and Debra's sight is restored. But she can now see how David really looks and in her panic, she rebuffs him. David is badly hurt and seeks consolation in the only place he feels safe – the sky. He plans to commit suicide by flying until his fuel runs out, but Debra's father, who is visiting and has friends in Air Traffic Control, establishes radio contact with him and convinces him to return to Debra.

Shimer was remembered as an extremely acute student: \\"the mere consciousness of something unknown was sufficient incentive to arouse ambition to acquire.\\"Sawyer, p. 11. She began school near her parents' house at the age of two and half, quickly learning to read.Sawyer, p. 10 At the age of six, she spent all of her saved allowance to buy a copy of Isaac Watts' The Improvement of the Mind from an itinerant bookseller. At the age of seven, she was briefly sent to a boarding school, but suffered from homesickness. She was fond of pets, and also began to experiment with horticulture from a young age. Because she was much younger than the other children, she was allowed to spend her time freely around the farm, and developed a reputation as a skilled animal trainer. A memorial essay recalls that \\"from childhood she was considered very skilful in managing spirited horses.\\" Her mother died of tuberculosis when Frances was ten, and she was subsequently looked after by her sister Caroline, who was 21 years older. Shortly thereafter, Caroline married Isaac Nash, a prosperous local farmer. Frances was then sent to the Stillwater Academy, a coeducational school in Stillwater, New York. At the age of twelve, however, Frances returned home to attend to the Wood family farm and care for her father. New York teaching career Shimer took up teaching in local Saratoga County schools at the age of fourteen. She also continued to care for her father's farm until it was sold. After the sale of the farm, she and her father lived at the spacious Nash residence. While living with the Nashes, Shimer first made the acquaintance of Cinderella Gregory, who boarded at the Nash house while teaching in the district. Throughout these early teaching years, Shimer saved her income from teaching and farming to pay for her future education. Influenced by her mother's early death, Shimer wished to become a physician, but was unable to find any medical school that would admit women. She therefore sought further education as a teacher. The movement toward state- supported normal schools had begun in New England in 1839, and the New York state legislature established the New York State Normal School in Albany in 1844. Shimer entered the state normal school in 1848, having been granted a full scholarship on the recommendation of her local superintendent. She graduated in 1849, having completed the two-year course in one year so that she could graduate in the same class as Cinderella Gregory. Shimer and Gregory continued to teach at schools in New York, but were unable to find steady positions due to the oversupply of teachers in the East. Shimer also began to suffer from tuberculosis, and sought a change of climate. She and Gregory therefore corresponded with the citizens in a number of Midwestern towns, looking for a teaching position. A business acquaintance of Isaac Nash, the attorney John Wilson, was at this time seeking to establish a seminary in the small frontier town of Mount Carroll, Illinois. After some correspondence, Shimer and Cinderella Gregory left New York together for Mount Carroll in 1853, traveling by the Great Lakes to Illinois and by wagon the rest of the way. A charter for the seminary had been granted by the legislature in 1852, but when Shimer and Gregory arrived, there was no building and no students. On May 11, 1853, they began teaching to a small group of mostly very young students in the Presbyterian Church. Co-principal of Mount Carroll Seminary, 1853–1870 From 1853 to 1870, Shimer operated the Mount Carroll Seminary as a partnership with Cinderella Gregory, who served as the chief academic officer while Shimer handled finances and other non-academic operations. Shimer and Gregory purchased the school from the discouraged incorporators in 1855, when it still occupied only a single building. The subsequent expansion of the seminary to a 25-acre campus with four connected buildings and numerous outbuildings was attributed largely to Shimer's industry and careful management of finances. In 1857, a major expansion of the school was planned, but the Panic of 1857 intervened. In December 1857, she married local naturalist Henry Shimer. Henry subsequently traveled to Chicago to study medicine, obtaining his MD from Chicago Medical College in 1866, and taught classes at the seminary. He was also a noted entomologist. The Shimers lived in separate quarters throughout their marriage. Principal of Mount Carroll Seminary, 1870–1896 Picture from the 1890s of the home of Frances Shimer in DeLand, Florida. Built in 1885 and still standing, this is one of DeLand's oldest homes. In 1870, a number of significant events occurred. Gregory left the school to marry, and sold her interest in the seminary to Shimer. Adelia Joy was brought on to replace Gregory administratively, but the school remained Shimer's sole property until she relinquished control in 1896. Beginning in the 1880s, Shimer began to spend the winters in DeLand, Florida, where she established a large and profitable orange plantation. As with the previous farm operations closer to Mount Carroll, a significant portion of the orchard's harvest was shipped to the Seminary to provide food for students. In 1895, Shimer's husband Henry Shimer committed suicide, either by hanging or gunshot. His death occurred five days after he had drawn up a new will leaving his wife with his entire fortune of approximately $200,000, and his surviving sister and mother with nothing. The will was successfully contested by the Shimer family, in a trial that drew hundreds of spectators each day. In 1896, Frances Shimer arranged to transfer control of the Mount Carroll Seminary to a Board of Trustees under an affiliation with the University of Chicago. She subsequently retired to Florida and took up orange-growing. However, the orange groves were destroyed in a frost. Final years, 1896–1901 Frances Shimer, from the frontispiece of the memorial volume published upon her death Frances Shimer died on November 10, 1901. Her body was returned to Mount Carroll for burial, and interred at the Oak Hill Cemetery where her husband was also buried.

Biography  Wood was born in London in 1948, and went to art school in Liverpool in 1967, before going to Newnham College, Cambridge University, where she studied Chinese. She went to China to study Chinese at Peking University in 1975–1976.

She is also a member of the steering committee of the International Dunhuang Project, and the editor of the Transactions of the Oriental Ceramic Society. She was also a governor of Ashmount Primary School for 20 years, relinquishing this post on the completion of her current term of office in July 2014. She has argued in her 1995 book, Did Marco Polo go to China?, that the book of Marco Polo (Il Milione) is not the account of a single person, but is a collection of travellers' tales. This book's claims about Polo's travels has been heavily criticized by Stephen G. Haw, David Morgan and Peter Jackson as lacking basic academic rigor. In May 2012, she appeared on In Our Time on Radio Four, talking about Marco Polo; she appeared again in the 2015 episode on Chinese legalism.

She was launched in 1918 and completed the following year by the American International Shipbuilding Corp., Hog Island, Pennsylvania as USS Sac City (ID-3861). Service history The U.S. Navy commissioned USS Sac City on 6 January 1919. At the end of January 1919, the ship sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, with a cargo destined for Montevideo, Uruguay. The ship arrived at Montevideo at the beginning of March 1919. She moved to the nearby port of Rosario, and loaded a private commercial cargo, which she took to Gibraltar. She sailed to New York City from Gibraltar in June 1919. Sac City was decommissioned on 17 June 1919 and transferred to the United States Shipping Board. She then entered commercial service as SS Sac City. Sac City ran aground in the Scheldt at Walsoorden, Zeeland, the Netherlands, on 9 December 1926. She was refloated on 16 December 1926. On 11 March 1927, Sac City was steaming in New York Harbor in dense fog when she collided with the Morgan Line cargo ship . El Sol, inbound to New York with a $1,000,000 cargo of pig iron, copper, and bales of cotton, was maneuvering into position to anchor to wait for the fog to lift when the collision occurred at about 07:45. Sac City hit a glancing blow to El Sol, bounced off, and then struck El Sol a second time, ripping through El Sols plating. Sac Citys bow had some slight damage, but El Sol sank quickly in about of water about a half-mile (800 m) south of the Statue of Liberty. Out of El Sol's crew of 45 men, 44 were rescued; the ship's carpenter, who could not swim, was last seen clutching the ship's rail as it went below the surface. El Sol settled on the bottom at a 45° angle with only the tops of her masts protruding above the surface. In hearings before the United States Steamboat Inspection Service, the captain of Sac City and Captain Charles H. Knowles of El Sol both were cleared of wrongdoing in the collision, and the blame was laid on the heavy fog. During her subsequent commercial service, the ship was sold to the Red D. Line and renamed SS Black Falcon in 1932. She was later sold to the Luckenbach Steamship Co. of New York and renamed SS Mary Luckenbach in 1941. In September 1942, Mary Luckenbach was part of Convoy PQ 18, a convoy of 40 merchant ships under heavy escort transiting the Barents Sea en route Murmansk in the Soviet Union. On 14 September 1942 (some sources list 13 September), the convoy was west of North Cape, Norway, when Mary Luckenbach was attacked by several German Junkers 88 torpedo bomber aircraft and was hit by an aerial torpedo. The impact of the torpedo detonated the ship's cargo of 1,000 tons of TNT, vaporizing her along with her entire crew of 41 and the 24 personnel of the United States Navy Armed Guard assigned to her.

They are located around the upper reaches of the Yellow River () and the sacred mountain Amne Machin (). They are not an homogeneous group but are composed of peoples of very different geographic origins across the Khams and Amdo region.Stein (1961), pp. 44, 68. The Golok was a haven for refugees and immigrants from all over the Amdo and Kham and they are an amalgamation of peoples of diverse origin.

The exact boundaries of the historical territory of Golok do not correspond to the boundaries of the modern prefecture. Historically the region knows as Golog included parts of northern Sichuan, Maqu County in Ganlho Prefecture in Gansu, and other places in the traditional Tibetan regions of Amdo and Khams. In 1828 when the great mystic and poet of early 19th century Amdo, Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol, was returning to Amdo from Central Tibet, his caravan, carrying letters of passage from both the Dalai and Panchen Lamas, was brutally attacked and pillaged by Golok tribesmen. Some months later Shabkar told the Qinghai amban, who was the senior Qing administrator in Xining, what had happened. The amban, admitting that the Golok tribes were beyond Imperial control asked Shabkar to try preaching to them in hopes that this might tame them to some extent. The Chinese had never been able to control the Goloks before, some areas of which owed allegiance to Labrang, but many others which were completely independent. Occasional ambushes killed soldiers of the Ninghai Army, causing loss of dispatches and livestock like yaks. The Hui army, with its modern weaponry, retaliated in draconian fashion and exterminated a group of Goloks, and then convoked the Golok tribes for negotiations, only to slaughter them. A Christian missionary, in writing of the Muslim army's extermination of the Goloks as an act of God, wrote of the events of 1921 in the following way: After Tibetans attacked the Ninghai Muslim army in 1922 and 1923, the Ninghai army returned in 1924 and crushed the Tibetans, killing numerous Tibetans.

It flies in June and July and the larva mine the leaves of willows (Salix species) from July to November. Description The wingspan is 5.3 to 6.8 mm. The head is ferruginous to orange, the collar whitish. Antennae are wholly ochreous-whitish. The forewings are blackish or dark fuscous, faintly purplish-tinged ; an ochreous whitish dorsal spot hardly beyond middle ; tips of apical cilia white. Hindwings grey.Meyrick, E., 1895 A Handbook of British Lepidoptera MacMillan, London pdf Keys and description Adults are on wing in June and July and there is one generation per year. Life cycle =Egg= Eggs are laid in June and July on the upperside of the midrib of a willow leaf. It is hard to find, but it is usually approximately 10 mm nearer the petiole then where the larva enters the midrib to start the mine. =Larva= The larva is pale yellow with a green gut and its head is pale brown. At first they mine the midrib and then make a blotch in the leaf. It makes a double line of frass with a passage between the lines of frass leading back to the midrib. When not feeding the larva hides in the midrib and when too large for the midrib it rests between the line of frass. Eventually the larva remains at the feeding edge of the mine and the frass is deposited haphazardly, blocking the passage to the midrib. Occasionally a larva mines the petiole and rarely a lateral rib. If a leaf falls the larva can be found in a green island and waterlogging does not seem to affect the larva. =Pupa= The pupa can be found from November to June, in a pale orcheous to light reddish brown cocoon, on the ground or in leaf litter. Ecology The moth is univoltine (i.e. one generation per year) and can be disturbed from the foliage of the larval food plant. =Host plants= It feeds on eared willow (Salix aurita), Babylon willow (Salix babylonica), goat willow (Salix caprea), grey willow (Salix cinerea), Salix dasyclados, crack willow (Salix fragilis), bay willow (Salix pentandra), tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia) and common osier (Salix viminalis). Distribution Widely distributed in northern, western and central Europe, but not yet recorded from Norway. In the south it is only known from northern Italy, northern former Yugoslavia and Romania.

The defense line was situated behind the Maas Line (about 9 km until 21 km distance). The defense line starts at Grave, where a barrack complex was built as part of the Peel-Raam line. From there, the line passed by Mill, Peel along the Zuid-Willemsvaart until the Belgium border nearby Weert. In the North the defense line was connected with the Grebbe line. The defense line could profit from the natural protection of the swamps, rivers and canals in the area. In the northern part, an artificial barrier was made, the Defensiekanaal (a canal). The defense line was made of Casemates (200m apart) and barbwire obstructions. The railway bridge on the Defensiekanaal near Mill, also had a spargel-obstruction (precursor of the Rommelspargel which the German Army used from 1943 onwards). On the first day of the German invasion, 10 May 1940, a German train crashed into this spargel-obstruction. There were not many communication lines between the Casemates and the main force of the infantry was far behind the line of Casemates. The Dutch would like to have connected the defense line with the defense line along the Albert Canal in Belgium. But the Belgian army wanted a new defenseline (the Orange Line (Dutch Oranjelinie) along the line Tilburg-Waalwijk and the Bergsche Maas. Because of this, the defense line was vulnerable and the enemy could go around the defense line crossing into Belgium soil.  The Line Today  The Peel-Raam Line is, for most part, intact; the northern part, in particular.

The Council of Europe has 47 member States with some 800 million citizens and its seat is in Strasbourg, France. The current president is Anna Rurka. The INGO Conference of the Council of Europe is a space for free and innovative participation of committed citizens, offering the possibility to contribute directly to the construction of Europe. It is the only assembly of NGOs playing an institutional role in an international intergovernmental organization. As the President of the Committee of Ministers, Micheline Calmy-Rey, put it on 25 January 2010 addressing the Parliamentary Assembly: \\"The Council of Europe is playing an irreplaceable role in the building of a single Europe. Its intergovernmental co-operation method is enriched by a prominent parliamentary dimension – so well represented by your Assembly – as well as by a regional and local dimension in the form of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, not forgetting civil society, represented through the Conference of International Non-Governmental Organisations. Thus, the huge diversity of our continent is represented within a single institution. No organisation can claim to be more representative of all Europeans\\". History =First step: Consultative status= At its 8th session, in May 1951, the Committee of Ministers stated that it \\"may, on behalf of the Council of Europe, make suitable arrangements for consultation with international non-governmental Organisations which deal with matters that are within the competence of the Council of Europe\\" (Resolution (51) 30Fe). In October 1972 it adopted the “Rules for Consultative Status” for INGOs (Resolution (72) 35). The Secretary General of the Council of Europe Georg Kahn-Ackermann increased the cooperation with the INGOs and suggested that they should get organised among themselves. This led to establishing in January 1976 the Liaison Committee, a body made up of 17 INGOs elected by the \\"Plenary Conference of the INGOs enjoying consultative status with the Council of Europe\\". In 1979, the Committee of Ministers decided to establish, within the Directorate of Political Affairs, a secretariat for the Liaison Committee and to put interpretation and meeting rooms at the disposal of the INGOs. In order to finance the collective work the Liaison Committee set up, in 1995, the association \\"INGO Service\\" to receive voluntary financial contributions from INGOs. The Committee of Ministers supported this initiative by contributing 15 000 FF (10’200 € in 2009). In 1991 the Plenary Conference of INGOs set up \\"groupings\\" in order to enable the INGOs to work collectively on specific thematic issues and to reinforce their cooperation with the directions concerned, often allowing for more synergy among them. In order to make the cooperation with the INGOs more flexible and easy, and at the same time, to strengthen the conditions set for obtaining the consultative status, the Committee of Ministers adopted, in October 1993, a new resolution “on relations between the Council of Europe and the international non-governmental organisations” (Resolution (93) 38). In October 2001, the Ministers' Deputies decided “to examine possibilities to adapt the Committee of Ministers Resolution (93)38 on relations between the Council of Europe and international non-governmental organisations in order that the Council may take greater advantage of its relations with NGOs in the pursuit of its aims\\". The Liaison Committee and the Plenary Conference were associated to this work. =Second step: Attribution of the participatory status= On 19 November 2003 the Committee of Ministers changed the consultative status into a participatory status (Resolution Res (2003) 8), \\"considering that it is indispensable that the rules governing the relations between the Council of Europe and NGOs evolve to reflect the active participation of international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) in the Organisation's policy and work programme, and to facilitate INGO participation and access to such bodies as the steering committees and governmental expert committees, and other subsidiary bodies of the Committee of Ministers\\" and \\"recognising the important role to be played by the Liaison Committee as the democratically elected representative body of all of the INGOs enjoying participatory status with the Council of Europe, and by the INGO thematic groupings as their collective voice and, thus, of millions of European citizens, working in each of the fields represented by them\\". At the same time, the Committee of Ministers created a status of partnership for national NGOs (Resolution (2003) 9). It is one of the priorities of the INGO Conference to enable national and local NGOs to benefit more from the Council of Europe's achievements and to contribute themselves to its work. =Third step: Political recognition= The INGOs enjoying now participatory status adapt the functioning of their bodies and, in January 2005. The Plenary Conference is given the title of \\"the INGO Conference of the Council of Europe\\" and adopts its new rules of procedure. The Council of Europe’s activity report] of the same year states that \\"this change in the title reflects the political recognition of the INGOs as a partner within the Council of Europe\\". At the 3rd Summit of Head of States and governments of the Council of Europe in May 2005 in Warsaw, for the first time, the president of the INGO Conference is invited to take the floor in one's official capacity. In connection with the Summit, the INGO Conference holds an extraordinary meeting in Warsaw University to confirm its determination to support the Council of Europe through its connection to the grass root level, contributing to reduce the gap between politicians' actions and the needs and visions of the citizens. In December 2005, the Committee of Ministers stipulates that the INGO Conference may delegate its representatives to the steering committees and subordinate bodies, like the Parliamentarian Assembly and the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities (Resolution (2005)47). The political recognition is followed by a progressive increase of the operational budget for the activities, organised by of the INGO Conference and the secretariat, and by the reinforcement of the latter. In June 2008, the INGO Conference reforms its organs to adapt further its functioning to the other pillars of the Council of Europe. Functioning =Voluntary work= INGOs Conference of The Council of Europe is celebrating World NGO Day on 27th February 2019 in Strasbourg, France. A characteristic of the representation of INGOs at the Council of Europe is the fact that it is done on a voluntary basis. On the one hand, the INGO representatives do not get any compensation for their work, regardless if they have an official function in the INGO Conference's structure or not. On the other hand, they themselves or their INGOs pay for their travel and subsistence costs during their stay in Strasbourg. With one exception: The members of the Standing Committee have their travel costs reimbursed by the Council of Europe for the four ordinary annual sessions of the Conference. This means that the representation is subordinated to each INGO's human and financial resources. =Internal organisation and \\"quadrilogue\\"= The INGO Conference of the Council of Europe, in 2010 made up of 366 INGOs enjoying participatory status, is the main decision-making body of the non-governmental organisations. It identifies the general action needed to organise its participation in the Council of Europe \\"quadrilogue\\" (partnership between the four pillars of the Council of Europe: Committee of Ministers, Parliamentary Assembly, Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, and INGO Conference). It ensures that the participatory system functions adequately and so helps to strengthen the political say of the civil society at the Council of Europe. It decides on policy lines and defines and adopts action programmes. The Conference of INGOs meets in Strasbourg three to four times a year during the ordinary sessions of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. It is chaired by its president in office, whom it elects every three years. The current President of the Conference of INGOs, Mr Jean- Marie Heydt, was elected in January 2009. In its Madrid Declaration of May 2009, the Committee of Ministers confirms the role of the INGO Conference in the \\"quadrilogue\\" and states that \\"developing – with the help of the Conference of the International Non-Governmental Organisations (INGO) – interaction with civil society, whose action on the ground we applaud, will also remain one of our priorities\\" (CM(2009)50 final 12 May 2009). A good practice of this \\"quadrilogue\\" is to be found in the Forum for the Future of Democracy, governed by the Council of Europe's quadripartite stakeholders. This is a guarantee of its crosscutting impact. Another example for the \\"quadrilogue\\" is the North-South Center of the Council of Europe, to the creation of which INGOs have contributed. In January 2010, a cooperation agreement was concluded between the North-South Center and the INGO Conference in order to strengthen their collaboration. The Standing Committee is the second decision-making body of the non-governmental organisations. It has a consultative and proposal-making role vis-à-vis the INGO Conference and its Bureau and adopts the recommendations and resolutions expressing their commitment. It is responsible for co-ordination between the INGO Conference and its Committees ; it promotes participation by the INGOs in the work of the other partners in the Council of Europe. The Bureau prepares the agenda for the meetings of the INGO Conference and its Standing Committee and implements the decisions taken by these two bodies. During and between the sessions, the main work is done by the three committees where INGOs involved at local, national and European level cooperate on issues in the competence of the Council of Europe: Committees * Democracy, Social Cohesion and Global Challenges addressing since June 2011 the thematics of three previous committees (\\"Democracy and Civil Society\\", \\"Social cohesion and eradication of poverty\\", \\"Sustainable territorial development\\") and a tranversal group \\"Europe and global challenges\\" * Education and Culture *Human rights A delegate will be elected next January 2012 to deal with the Gender equality theme. The committees prepare the contributions to the steering committees and subordinate bodies, organise with the secretariat the activities on these issues both in the Council of Europe and its member States and elaborate draft declarations and recommendations to the other pillars of the Council of Europe that will be adopted by the INGO Conference or its standing committee. They share their expertise with the directorates general and other constituencies of the Council of Europe. In addition to this collective work, national and international NGOs are cooperating individually as experts with the different organs and directorates general of the Council of Europe. =Relations with the Parliamentary Assembly and the Congress= The committees work in synergy with the committees of the Parliamentary Assembly and the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities. They issue statements on their demand or at own initiative. To strengthen this cooperation, the Parliamentary Assembly adopted, in November 2007, a resolution on the “Co-operation between the Parliamentary Assembly and the Conference of INGOs” (Resolution 1589 (2007)1), noting \\"with satisfaction that the work programme of the Conference of INGOs contains several major themes which are closely related to the priorities of the Assembly. On this basis, it is convinced that additional steps should be taken with a view to an enhanced co-operation aimed at further developing citizen participation and dialogue with civil society\\". In May 2008, the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities and the INGO Conference concluded resolution on Partnership between local and regional authorities and NGOs in Council of Europe member States” \\"to promote progressive and appropriate procedures for citizen participation between elections\\". This memorandum was established mainly to strengthen the position of national and local NGOs, which in their great majority do not have any link with the Council of Europe. On April 2010, during the International Year of Biodiversity, the President of the INGO Conference Jean-Marie Heydt, Parliamentary Assembly President Mevlüt Çavusoglu and Acting President of the Congress Ian Micallef, signed for the first time a joint Declaration “Working together for Biodiversity”. =Strengthening of civil society= The INGO Conference is also committed to strengthening the civil society in Council of Europe member States and in Belarus. Thus, it established the Expert Council on NGO Law which mainly monitors the implementation of the Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the legal status of non-governmental organisations in Europe (CM/Rec (2007)14). In October 2009 it adopted the Code of Good Practice for Civil Participation in the Decision-Making Process, recognised by the Committee of Ministers \\"as a reference document for the Council of Europe, and as a basis for a possible further development of the framework for the empowerment of citizens to be involved in conducting public affairs in European countries\\" (Declaration CM 21 October 2009). Furthermore, since 2006 the INGO Conference organises Regional NGO Congresses designed for NGOs from Central and Eastern European countries. They took place in Warsaw, Kiev, Penza/Russian Federation and, last June 2010, Vilnius/Lithuania.

Mr MacKenzie had bought some at a public judicial auction in February 1779, and the sale was confirmed by the Court of Session after several months.

First published in 1835, it was an immediate success and is considered to be Andersen's breakthrough. The story, reflecting Andersen's own travels in Italy in 1833, reveals much about his own life and aspirations as experienced by Antonio, the novel's principal character.  Background  In September 1833, with financial support from Danish well-wishers, Andersen embarked on a cultural trip to Italy. Deeply impressed with everything he experienced and influenced by Madame de Staël's \\"Corinne ou l'Italie\\", he began writing his travel tale, The Improvisatore. It was published by Reitzels Forlag in 1835. An immediate success and Andersen's breakthrough, the following year it was published in Germany and, in 1838, in France.\\"H. C. Andersen: Improvisatoren (1835)\\" , Epoke – danske romaner før 1900. Retrieved 18 April 2010. For many years, The Improvisatore was the most widely read of all of Andersen's works.  Plot  In this fictionalized autobiography, the hero Antonio does not arrive as a tourist but grows up in Italy, thus able to show not just the sunny side of life but also some of its shadows. In its structure, the novel reflects Andersen's own life and his travels through Italy. The descriptions of the Italian towns and regions are particularly captivating, expressed in the author's colourful language.\\"Improvisatoren af H. C.

He died in a secret CIA prison, or black site, located in northern Kabul, Afghanistan known as the Salt Pit.mirror He had been captured October 29, 2002. His name was kept secret by the United States for more than seven years although his death was announced. In 2010 the Associated Press reported that before his death he was left half-stripped and chained against a concrete wall on a night when the temperature was close to freezing. The United States government did not notify his family (wife and four daughters) of his death, according to the report. Capture and death Gul Rahman was captured and arrested on 29 October 2002 during a joint operation by U.S. agents and Pakistani security forces against Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin. He was reportedly arrested with the physician Ghairat Baheer, the son-in-law of the warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who led the insurgent faction Hezb-e-Islami. Rahman had traveled from Peshawar to Islamabad, Pakistan for a medical checkup when he was arrested at the home of Ghairat Baheer, and subsequently flown by the CIA to Afghanistan. U.S. officials claim Rahman was \\"violently uncooperative\\" while in custody at the Salt Pit, the CIA code name for an abandoned brick factory that had been turned into a CIA black site or covert interrogation center, including threatening to kill his guards – who responded by beating him. Rahman was also subjected to \\"48 hours of sleep deprivation, auditory overload, total darkness, isolation, a cold shower and rough treatment\\". Gul Rahman reportedly died on 20 November 2002 after being stripped naked from the waist down and shackled to a cold cement wall in the Salt Pit, where temperatures were approximately . This technique of shackling is known as \\"short-chaining.\\" The detainee is shackled \\"in a short chain position, which prevents prisoners from standing upright.\\" A CIA pathologist reported that Rahman likely froze to death. His death prompted an internal CIA review and the development of improved guidance. No one was ever charged in his death. Rescue of Hamid Karzai Redacted version of the CIA investigation of Rahman's death, released June 2016 (.pdf file) According to Gul's brother, Habib Rahman, Gul Rahman was involved in a 1994 rescue of Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan since 2004. Karzai had been imprisoned by the government forces, and Rahman was working for Hekmatyar, whose forces fired rockets at the building while Rahman entered and freed Karzai. Rahman took him to a safe house in Kabul. Senate Intelligence Committee's report of CIA torture On December 9, 2014 the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on CIA torture was published. According to that report he had been subjected to total darkness, sensory overload, sleep deprivation, cold shower, rough treatment, short shackling and finally froze to death. The report said he was the only captive known to have died in CIA custody. Steven W. Hawkins, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, writing in The Guardian, reported that he found that the CIA official responsible for Rahman's death, Jose Rodriguez was not only not punished, or sanctioned, rather, he received a cash bonus for his \\"consistently superior work\\". On October 13, 2015 the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of Rahman's estate and two other former detainees against two psychologists, James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, who they maintain were responsible for designing the protocols that resulted in Rahman's death and the torture of the other two plaintifs. The ACLU case is the first lawsuit brought against significant individuals identified in the Senate report since it was published. On July 28, 2017, U.S. District Judge Justin Lowe Quackenbush denied both parties motions for summary judgment, noted that the defendants are indemnified by the United States government, and encouraged the attorneys to reach a settlement before trial.

It was one of the churches whose construction was started during the reign of Constantine the Great. It is thought to have been sited on an island where the Imperial Palace of Antioch used to stand during the Seleucid period. The church became a major point of the controversy between Christians and Julian the Apostate when the latter closed the cathedral in response to the burning of an ancient temple to Apollo in the nearby suburb of Daphne. From 526 to 587 it suffered from a series of earthquakes, fires and Persian attacks, before being finally destroyed in another earthquake in 588, after which it was not rebuilt.  Construction  240 px Construction of the church was started in 327, during the reign of Constantine the Great, and was completed under Constantius II. The new church was dedicated in a ceremony on 6 January 341, in the presence of both Constans and Constantius II and a gathering of ninety-seven bishops, which formed the dedication council. It was built on the island between the two main branches of the Orontes River, where the Imperial Palace was located. It has not proved possible to establish the site of the church with any greater certainty. The only known possible depiction of the Domus Aurea is the Megalopsychia Hunt Mosaic, or \\"Yakto mosaic\\", from the second half of the fifth century, found in the ancient suburb of Antioch, Daphne (Yakto). Part of the border of this hunt scene shows buildings from Antioch, including those interpreted to be the Imperial Palace and the Domus Aurea. Although there is an octagonal building on part of the border it remains uncertain if this represents the great church or whether the relationship to other buildings can be used to identify its location on the island. In the absence of definitive pictorial evidence, it is necessary to rely on written descriptions of the building. Eusebius in his Life of Constantine, describes the Domus Aurea as being octagonal in plan, sited in a large enclosure, with many chambers clustered around it. The domed roof, which was made of wood, reached a great height and was gilded inside. The floor consisted of polished marble and every part of the building was highly decorated with brass, gold and precious stones. It has been proposed that it was similar in structure to the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, which was built in 540.  Julian the Apostate  Julian moved to Antioch in 362, soon after becoming the sole ruler of the eastern empire, following the death of Constantius II. He was the last non-Christian ruler of the Roman Empire, and chose Antioch as his headquarters, partly to lay plans for his proposed campaign against the Persians and partly to further his attempt to restore the eastern empire to Hellenism. He had the body of Saint Babylas removed from the martyrium near the temple of Apollo at Daphne, because he thought that it had silenced the oracle of Apollo. When the temple burned down, shortly thereafter, Julian was furious, suspecting the Christians and in response closed the Great Church, removing its liturgical vessels. This act effectively brought his attempts to restore Hellenism in Antioch to an end.  Earthquakes and fires  The earthquake of late May 526 badly damaged the great church, but still left it standing. However, seven days later the fires that had been burning since the earthquake struck finally destroyed the church. The great church was rebuilt by Ephraim, the comes Orientis, and partly for that reason he was persuaded to become the new Patriarch of Antioch in 528. On 29 November 528 another earthquake struck the city and the great church was again destroyed. It was again rebuilt by Ephraim, being rededicated in 537/538, only for it to be destroyed by fire once more in 540 A.D. when Antioch was burned by the invading Persians under Chosroes I. It was rebuilt for the last time by Justinian I, but was damaged by earthquakes in 551, 557 and 577, giving a northward tilt to the dome.  Destruction  The final destruction of the great church occurred on 31 October 588 (or possibly 587), when Antioch was again struck by a major earthquake. It is said that although the rest of the church was destroyed, that the dome settled on the ruins in an upright position. After this earthquake it appears that no attempt was made to reconstruct the great church. This is in keeping with indications that the area in which it stood had become mainly uninhabited by that time, because Antioch was no longer an imperial residence of the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire and the island was no longer enclosed by the city walls.

Sexuality in Japan developed separately from that of mainland Asia, as Japan did not adopt the Confucian view of marriage, in which chastity is highly valued. Monogamy in marriage is often thought to be less important in Japan, and sometimes married men may seek pleasure from courtesans. Prostitution in Japan has a long history, and became especially popular during the Japanese economic miracle, as evening entertainments were tax-deductible. Decreased sex drive in the 21st century has been blamed for the low Japanese birth rate and declining growth of the Japanese population. Pornography ArguablyPornography or Erotic Art?, Guardian Nov 11, 2015 mass-produced pornography in Japan may have begun as early as the Edo period, (1603 - 1868), as erotic artwork referred to as shunga that was typically produced with woodblock prints in the 1,000’s. These erotic images were declared obscene and banned in 1772 by the Tokugawa shogunate, although they continued to be produced underground in smaller numbers. Between the 1920s and '30s in Japan there was a literary and artistic movement known as ero guro which focused on eroticism, sexual corruption and decadence.Silverberg, Miriam Rom. \\"By Way of a Preface: Defining Erotic Grotesque Nonsense\\" . Galley copy of the preface for Erotic Grotesque Nonsense: The Mass Culture of Japanese Modern Times. December 12, 2005. Softcore pornographic theatrical films known as pink films dominated the domestic cinema in Japan from the mid-1960s through the mid-1980s. In contemporary times Japanese pornography has gained a worldwide following and is frequently translated and exported to other cultures because of its large spectrum of themes and media. Pornography in Japan has in recent times expanded into new mediums such as manga (hentai) and video games (eroge) in addition to the more common film and historic mediums. =Shunga= A shunga woodblock print from 1772 depicting a man and a woman engaging in an erotic wrestling match with a second woman acting as a referee Most shunga are a type of ukiyo-e, the main artistic genre of woodblock printing in Japan. Although scarce, there are however extant erotic painted handscrolls which predate the Ukiyo-e movement. Translated literally, the Japanese word shunga means picture of spring; \\"spring\\" being a common euphemism for sex in Japan. The ukiyo-e movement as a whole sought to express an idealisation of contemporary urban life and appeal to the new chōnin class. Following the aesthetics of everyday life, Edo period shunga varied widely in its depictions of sexuality. In the Edo period it was enjoyed by rich and poor, men and women, despite being out of favour with the shogunate. Almost all ukiyo-e artists made shunga at some point in their careers, and it did not detract from their prestige as artists. Classifying shunga as a kind of medieval pornography can be misleading in this respect. =Film= In the years since the end of World War II, eroticism has gradually made its way into Japanese cinema. The first kiss to be seen in Japanese film—discreetly half- hidden by an umbrella—caused a national sensation in 1946. Foreign films throughout the 1950s introduced female nudity into international cinema and were imported to Japan without problem. Nevertheless, until the early 1960s, graphic depictions of nudity and sex in Japanese film could only be seen in single-reel \\"stag films,\\" made illegally by underground film producers such as those depicted in Imamura's film The Pornographers (1966). Mainstream pornography did not arrive in Japan until the advent of Pink film. Pink film was theatrical film which featured soft core, suggestive themes and later full-on nudity and sexual acts. The first wave of the Pink film in Japan was contemporary with the similar U.S. sexploitation film genres, the \\"nudie- cuties\\" and \\"roughies\\". Nudity and sex officially entered Japanese cinema with Satoru Kobayashi's controversial and popular independent production Flesh Market (Nikutai no Ichiba, 1962), which is considered the first true pink film.Weisser, p.21. In the 1970s, some of Japan's major studios, facing the loss of their theatrical audience, took over the pink film. With their access to higher production-values and talent, some of these films became critical and popular successes. When ownership of VCRs first became widespread in the early 1980s, AVs (adult videos) made their appearance and quickly became highly popular. As early as 1982 the AVs had already attained an approximately equal share of the adult entertainment market with theatrical erotic films.Weisser, p.29. Since then the market for pink films has decreased tremendously and a majority of Japanese seeking pornography go to AVs. Although the pink film genre has declined dramatically since the advent of AVs on VCR the genre is significant in that it paved the way for true pornography in Japan as well as for multiple other genres of Japanese pornographic film including: hamedori, roshutsu, and Japanese bondage. Other Japanese pornography genres include: group sex (with gang bang as a subgenre), lesbian, and fetishes (particularly foot fetishes). Lotion play is a popular element in Japanese pornography.Talmadge, Eric. Getting Wet: Adventures in the Japanese Bath. Tokyo: Kodansha International, 2006, p. 187, 190–191. .Sinclair, Joan. Pink Box: Inside Japan's Sex Clubs, Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 2006, p. 112–113. . =Hentai and seijin manga (adult cartoons)= The genre of erotica known to the West as hentai (erotic cartoons or drawings) was invented in Japan; They are used in erotic manga (Japanese comic books, graphic novels) and anime (Japanese animation). The word \\"hentai\\" has a negative connotation in Japanese and usually means \\"sexually perverted\\",\\"A Short History of 'Hentai'\\", by Mark McLelland, Intersections: Gender, History and Culture in the Asian Context, Issue 12, January 2006. Footnoted HTML version. with those in Japan more often referring to hentai as \\"seijin\\" or \\"adult\\" manga/anime. The adult manga/anime medium carries its own distinct subgenres as well. Futanari or sexual attraction to androgynous people is an extensive subgenre of seijin manga. Bakunyū is the subgenre that features females with very large breasts. In Japan lolicon refers to an attraction to underage girls. Outside Japan lolicon generally refers to the genre of seijin manga wherein childlike female characters are depicted in an erotic manner. Lolicon's male equivalent, shotacon is similarly used in the West to refer to the genre of manga and anime in which pre-pubescent or pubescent male characters are depicted in a suggestive or erotic manner. =International reception= Japanese pornography has gained a worldwide following and is frequently translated and exported to other cultures because of its large spectrum of themes and media. However, critics state that the lolicon genre of seijin manga, wherein childlike females are depicted in an erotic way, contributes to sexual abuse of children. Several countries have attempted to criminalize lolicon's sexually explicit forms as a type of child pornography, Canada, Australia,McLelland, Mark.

New Zealand, Sweden, the Philippines and Ireland are among those that have done so. Prostitution An antique postcard of Tokyo Yoshiwara, a historic district famous for its prostitution Prostitution has existed in some form throughout Japan's history. Despite the Anti-Prostitution Law of 1956, various legal loopholes, liberal interpretations of the law, and loose enforcement have allowed the sex industry to prosper and earn an estimated 2.3 trillion yen a year. Notably, the Anti-Prostitution Law makes prostituting oneself a crime whereas those who use the services of a prostitute are immune from prosecution. In Japan, the \\"sex industry\\" is not synonymous with prostitution. Because Japanese law defines prostitution as \\"intercourse with an unspecified person in exchange for payment,\\" in order to remain legal, most sex clubs offer only non-coital services.Japan Times This has led Joan Sinclair, the author of Pink Box, to observe that the sex industry in Japan ironically \\"offer[s] absolutely everything imaginable but sex.\\"Pink Box Japan =Geisha= A frequent focus of misconceptions in regard to Japanese sexuality is the institution of the geisha. Rather than a prostitute, a geisha was a woman trained in arts such as music and cultured conversation, who was available for non-sexual interactions with her male clientele. Geisha differed from their patrons' wives because, except for the geisha, women were ordinarily not prepared for activity other than household duties. This social limitation was imposed on the majority of women in traditional society and produced a diminution in the pursuits that women could enjoy. This limitation also impacted the ways that a man could enjoy the company of his wife. The geisha fulfilled the non-sexual social roles that ordinary women were prevented from fulfilling, and for this service they were well paid. That being said, the geisha were not deprived of opportunities to express themselves sexually and in other erotic ways. A geisha might have a patron with whom she enjoyed sexual intimacy, but this sexual role was not part of her role or responsibility as a geisha. Fetish scene Probably the most widely recognized fetish to come out of Japan, shibari has been exported to most western markets. Japan has a thriving fetish scene, especially BDSM fetishes. Indeed, Japanese game show-style videos have been created which center around the use of fetishes.www.kokoro-soft.com Among the unique sexual fetishes the Japanese have produced are tentacle erotica and the BDSM fetishes shibari, bukkake, omorashi and tamakeri. Food play is known as wakamezake, which involves nyotaimori, the act of presenting food (typically sushi) on a nude female body. This act has become an icon of Japanese food play. Largely due to Western influence, the attraction to very large breasts (bakunyū) has emerged as a fetish in Japan. Lolicon refers to the sexual attraction to seemingly underage girls. Shibari, as it is typically referred to in the West, is known as kinbaku (also sokubaku) in Japanese and refers to the erotic art of tying people up. Originally in Japanese history the martial art Hojōjutsu, which trained people in tying others up or restraining them with rope, was practiced and developed over long periods of time. Because being tied up with a knot was considered extremely shameful, the art emphasized many techniques for restricting noble men and others of high rank without actually using any knots. However, with the advent of BDSM in modern Japan came an eroticized offspring of Hojōjutsu, called kinbaku, that focuses more on gentler holds and uses the historical shame of being tied up to further humiliate the \\"bottom\\". Today, Hojōjutsu is not commonly practiced and is considered by some to be a dying art, but shibari thrives in the BDSM world and has profoundly influenced the bondage scene, integrating itself into many western schools, creating dozens of fusions of styles, and being practiced by itself in BDSM communities worldwide. Kinbaku has introduced to the West ties and positions that specifically apply pressure on the bottom's erogenous zones, asymmetric uses of patterns that give the bottom two uncomfortable positions to choose from, emphasizing simpler, more elegant ties over the elaborate, decorative knots of the West, as well as use of specific katas (forms) and aesthetic rules. Homosexuality A historic shunga woodblock printing from Japan depicting two women having sex. One has tied a tengu mask around her waist, and penetrates her partner using its long nose. In Japan, sodomy was restricted by legal prohibition in 1873. However, the provision was repealed only seven years later by the Penal Code of 1880, which relied on the Napoleonic Code.Anne Walthall. Review of Pflugfelder, Gregory M., Cartographies of Desire: Male-Male Sexuality in Japanese Discourse 1600–1950. H-Japan, H-Net Reviews. May, 2000. Confucian thought and the government's desire to appear \\"civilized\\" influenced the way that homosexuality was viewed by both the Japanese state and by the population at large during the Meiji period. Despite recent trends that suggest a new level of tolerance, as well as open scenes in more cosmopolitan cities (such as Tokyo and Osaka), Japanese gay men and lesbian women often conceal their sexuality, and many marry persons of the opposite sex to avoid discrimination. =Politics and law= Japan has no laws against homosexual activity and has some legal protections for gay individuals, but the Japanese government does not recognize same-sex marriage. In 2008 however, a law was passed allowing transgender people who have gone through sex reassignment surgery to change their sex on legal documents.What the Diet’s been up to lately: revising the law of transgendered people Consensual sex between adults of the same sex is legal, but some prefectures set the age of consent for same-sex sexual activity higher than for opposite- sex sexual activity. Despite recommendations from the Council for Human Rights Promotion, the Diet has yet to include protections against discrimination for sexual orientation in the country's civil rights code. Although national civil rights laws do not protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation, some local governments have enacted such laws. For example, the government of Tokyo has passed laws that ban discrimination in employment based on sexual identity. The major political parties express little public support for gay rights issues. AIDS, other STDs, and contraceptives In the years since the world first became aware of the AIDS virus, like most industrialized nations, Japan has not suffered the high rates of AIDS disease and death that characterize some nations in Africa and South-East Asia. As of 2007 only about 100 people die each year in Japan due to AIDS.World Factbook In 1992, the government of Japan justified its continued refusal to allow oral contraceptives to be distributed in the country on the belief that it would lead to reduced condom use and increased transmission of AIDS. As of 2004, condoms accounted for 80 percent of birth control used in Japan. This might explain Japan's comparably lower incidence of AIDS. Decreasing sexual activity Sexual desire and sexual activity have been declining in Japan for years, and this is a cause of Japan's decreasing birth rate. Because Japan has one of the lowest birth rates in the world and its population is on course to shrink dramatically by the middle of the century, every five years the government carries out a detailed survey of attitudes to sex and marriage. The studies and surveys have reported loss of sexual drive across several demographics, from adolescent men and women, to married couples. In 2010, the 14th Japanese National Fertility Survey was conducted by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research. Singles between the ages of 18–34 who are not involved in a romantic relationship and do not want one amounted to 28% for men and 23% for women. It was also found that 28% of men and 26% of women aged 35–39 had no sexual experience. However, the possibility of response bias should be taken into consideration with these figures. In 2010, another survey published The Japanese Association for Sex Education Research Journal found that 40.8% (up from 34.6% in 2006) of marriages in Japan could be classified as \\"sexless\\", which the Japan Society of Sexual Sciences generally defines as \\"engaging in sex less than once a month, despite not suffering from any health-related conditions\\". Among the top reasons married couples cite for not having sex, is that after children are in the picture (couples are even discouraged from having intercourse while pregnant), sex can decrease markedly or even become nonexistent for a habit-forming period of time. About 1 in 5 couples say they simply view sex as a nuisance, a small number cite the lack of private space, because elderly or the children often sleep on just the other side of paper-thin walls. Some are too stressed out from work, others have \\"more fun things to do\\". There is also a tendency among Japanese married couples to feel an aversion to sex with their spouse because they've come to feel that they have more of a relative/sibling relationship, and accordingly cannot see their spouse as a sexual partner anymore. Additionally, 36.1% of males and 58.5% of female respondents aged 16 to 19 surveyed described themselves as \\"indifferent or averse\\" towards having sex. A near 18% and 12% increase respectively, since the survey was last conducted in 2008. It was also reported that 83.7% of men who turned 20 that year were not dating anyone, with 49.3% stating they had never had a girlfriend. 59% of female respondents of the same age group responded similarly, a 12% increase from the 2008 survey. Some scholars have criticized the media reporting and scholarship on so-called \\"sexless\\" Japan many of these surveys exclude LGBT people, divorcees, widows, single parents or people who have married between the ages of 18-30. This necessarily exaggerates the number of virgins by excluding a huge segment of the sexually active population. The surveys research methodology are also outdated and based on the faulty assumption that everyone is heterosexual and has never divorced or had a child out of wedlock. The motivations behind the studies are also questionable since they are linked to government attempts to justify the funding of programs for arranged marriage partners. In a global context, a 2005 Sex Survey of 317,000 people in 41 countries conducted by Durex, the largest condom manufacturer in the world, found that the Japanese had the least sex in the world, at 45 times a year, with the second-to-last country of Singapore averaging 73 times a year, and the world average at 103 times a year. Additionally the survey reported that only 24% of Japanese respondents said they were happy with their sex lives, compared to the global average of 44%. The reasons for this decline in sex interest are still widely discussed; There are many theories and different contributing factors. A large part of it may be attributed to the fact that in most respects, men and women live very separate lives socially, and there is little relaxed contact with the opposite sex outside of school ties or friends from the office, and in turn, less opportunity to freely mingle without commercial transaction through the sex- industry. This, combined with young men's growing reliance on pornography, can be thought to have a large impact on the real-world sex interest due to its “overstimulating” effect.

This duty has been codified into the Companies Act 2006 section 171, and arises particularly in cases involving takeover bids. Facts RW Millers was embroiled in a hostile takeover bid, by a large petrol company called Ampol. Ampol already controlled (with an associated company) 55% of the shares. The directors did not want Ampol to buy the shares of RW Millers as Howard Smith had bettered terms for take over by offering employment to the directors even in the future. So the directors of RW Millers issued $10m of new shares. They said it was to finance the completion of two tankers. The shares were given to Howard Smith Ltd who were going to take over RW Millers, and that blocked Ampol’s rival bid. Without the issue, Howard Smith Ltd had no hope of succeeding in taking over the company. But with the new issue, Ampol could not complete its acquisition. Ampol commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of NSW. Street said that the argument of the directors that the tanker purchase was the dominant purpose was ‘unreal and unconvincing’. The issue of shares to Howard Smith was held to be invalid. Howard Smith sought and obtained conditional leave to appeal to the Privy Council.Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd [1972] 2 NSWLR 850 (14 December 1972), Supreme Court (NSW, Australia).1 Judgment The Privy Council dismissed the appeal. Lord Wilberforce held that the issue of shares was within power but that it was exercised for an improper purpose. ‘To define in advance [what that means is] impossible.’ It must be adjudged ‘in the light of modern conditions’, and referred back to Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd.Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd [1967] Ch 254. His judgment continued. > The extreme argument on one side is that, for validity, what is required is > bona fide exercise of the power in the interests of the company: that once > it is found that the directors were not motivated by self-interest—i.e. by a > desire to retain their control of the company or their positions on the > board—the matter is concluded in their favour and that the court will not > inquire into the validity of their reasons for making the issue...

It aired on February 2, 2009. This episode was originally aired in 3-D, as the name suggests, using the same ColorCode 3-D technology as some of the commercials in Super Bowl XLIII. When Chuck foils a plan to kill international rock star Tyler Martin (Dominic Monaghan), the agents kidnap the musician to find out who wants him dead. Meanwhile, Big Mike's old football friend Jimmy Butterman (Jerome Bettis) comes to work at the Buy More. Plot summary At the Buy More, a huge line of people snakes around inside. A gleeful Morgan tells Chuck that rock star Tyler Martin is appearing at their store today, meaning they can slack and no one will notice. Chuck spots a guy in a trench coat planting a grenade on a shelf. After flashing on the grenade, he radios Casey and Sarah. Casey, Chuck and Sarah rush the grenade to the basement and safely insulate the detonation. In the Bunker, Beckman tells them to find out who wants Tyler dead. The grenade is a North African military weapon commonly used by intelligence. Beckman wants them to question Tyler, who just finished an African tour. Flanked by security guards, Tyler struts into the store amid screaming girls. Tyler tells the audience there's one Golden Ticket planted in his new CD for sale, which will grant the winner and a guest backstage access to his concert. When Tyler spots Sarah and drools, they realize getting him alone isn't going to be as hard as they thought. Sarah lures Tyler to the basement where Casey shoots him with a tranquilizer dart. After transferring Tyler to Casey's apartment, they put Chuck on Rock Star Watch while they try to track down the suspect via his car, which was captured on the Buy More security camera. In the suspect's apartment, they realize they're dealing with a pro when they find detailed pictures of Tyler taped to the walls and bomb- making materials littering the desk. Tyler wakes, and thinking he's in a fancy restaurant bathroom, pees in Chuck's fountain. When Tyler asks Chuck who he is, Chuck says he's from Tyler's record label. Tyler isn't concerned when Chuck says he's protecting him from a death threat. He just wants to party and tosses Chuck's cell phone into the fountain so their partying won't be disturbed by the wringing hands at the label. At the bar, surrounded by a smattering of women, Chuck and Tyler pound back drinks. Tyler shouts to everyone that all the drinks are on his record label and points to Chuck. Tyler is just explaining that his manager arranges his tattoos (incidentally, the Chinese character of a tattoo of the left hand which Tyler boasted of is \\"愛(ai),\\" which means \\"love\\"), when two sexy women ask Tyler and Chuck to dance. Casey and Sarah trace Chuck via a homing device to the bar, where they spot the man who planted the grenade. He sees them and slips outside where they stop him at gunpoint. Inside his trench coat, he reveals several grenades and tells them that he's got friends inside helping him to kill Tyler. With no choice, they let him go. Inside, Chuck flashes on one of the women's necklaces. When they want to go to their hotel room, Chuck can't figure out how to warn Tyler without blowing cover. Inside their hotel room, Chuck tries to talk Tyler out of going into the bedroom with the women. Tyler agrees, saying Chuck needs them more than he does. He pushes him inside and shuts him in. After they get Chuck's pants off, he runs, narrowly escaping their flying daggers. In boxers, socks and a T-shirt, Chuck climbs to the rooftop and radios for help. As Casey and Sarah race to the top floor, Chuck is cut off by the Bond-like assassins. He jumps onto an exterior elevator and hangs precariously from the side, where the women enter. The elevator doors open, and Tyler sees them. He's shocked when one points a gun at him. A dart hits his neck and he falls. Casey and Sarah enter the elevator and 32 floors up, as Chuck hangs from the side, they defeat the two assassins. Tyler wakes in Casey's apartment again, and after hearing he's in government custody, starts calling his manager. Casey tranquilizes Tyler again, and he slumps, revealing his back tattoo. Chuck flashes: the tattoo reveals plans for a secret nuclear reactor. Chuck realizes that Tyler's manager, who hires the tattoo artists, has been using Tyler's body to trade secrets. Casey and Sarah chastise Chuck for going to the nightclub. Chuck is angered, saying that he's not a spy with their skill sets and wants time off. Tired of listening to it, Casey shoots a tranquilizer dart at Chuck and he passes out. Back in Castle, Beckman orders the team to persuade Tyler to perform at the concert so they can capture the assassin, Achmed Gambir, a top foot soldier in a private North African army. Chuck worries about Tyler's safety but agrees to talk to him. As they listen, Chuck asks Tyler for one night of bravery for his entire life back. Sarah is moved when Chuck says, \\"I can't even tell you what I'd give for that.\\" So is Tyler, who agrees to perform. When Achmed knocks on Tyler's dressing room door, Chuck radios for help. Achmed breaks open the door and, knife in hand, moves toward the closet where Tyler is hiding. Chuck stops him by showing him a cell phone picture of Tyler's tattoo. As Tyler listens, stunned, Chuck recounts how Achmed and his private army are selling enriched uranium to unstable countries, and that they've been using Tyler's manager to get information to their buyers via Tyler's tattoos. He threatens to e-mail that and the photo to everyone. Achmed puts down his knife. Tyler bursts from the closet, armed with a cymbal. He swings at Achmed, misses, propelling himself and Chuck through the door. They run, passing Tyler's manager whom he punches and fires, ending up onstage. In the wings, Achmed is readying himself to throw his knife at Tyler, who tells Chuck to jump. They stage dive into the crowd, which passes them around. As Achmed tries to get close, Sarah and Casey find him and knock him out. The crowd passes Tyler back to the stage, then, realizing Chuck's not a star, drops him on his back. Back outside Chuck and Casey's apartments, Casey reminds Tyler to have his tattoos removed. Tyler thanks Chuck for everything, especially the lesson to put people first. He hugs him goodbye and after one more pass at Sarah, bids her farewell too. Chuck confronts Sarah about lying to him about shooting the unarmed Fulcrum agent on Christmas Eve. She said that she was trying to protect him, as the agent knew about Chuck, which put him and his whole family in danger. =Buy More= Big Mike tells Morgan that he hired an old football buddy of his, Jimmy Butterman (Jerome Bettis), who just got paroled. He wants Morgan to teach him everything he knows. Meanwhile, in the Buy More break room, Morgan, Lester, Jeff and Butterman slice open stacks of Tyler's CDs to try to find the Golden Ticket. Morgan finds it but can take only one of them. He says they're going to have to settle it \\"The Buy More way.\\" Jeff, Butterman, and Lester do a series of challenges, which Jeff wins. At the Buy More, Jeff and Morgan feel bad for Butterman, since he was in jail for so long. They decide to give him the Golden Ticket. Butterman in turn sells the ticket to Skip for $800, and leaves for Philadelphia. Production The opening credits feature the addition of graphics in the background, as opposed to plain grey or red backgrounds. Presumably, this was done to make the most of the 3D effect that was used. =Flashes= *Chuck flashes on the IG-88 grenade. *Chuck flashes on one of female assassin's necklace. *Chuck flashes on Tyler's tattoo. References to popular culture * The golden ticket hidden inside a CD case is taken directly from the novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and related films. * There are several references to the 1994 prison film The Shawshank Redemption. * The opera music played during two different scenes with the ex- con Butterman is the Mozart duet from the famous scene in The Shawshank Redemption. This prison reference was also used in the Season 1 episode Chuck Versus the Tango * There is a reference to The Thomas Crown Affair. * There are references to Arrested Development with the line \\"No Touching!\\" and the song \\"The Final Countdown.\\" * The grenade type, IG-88, is also the name of the bounty hunter droid in The Empire Strikes Back. * Dominic Monaghan's rock star role is reminiscent of his role in Lost. When arriving in the Buy More, he says \\"Hello Cleveland!\\", a line taken from This Is Spinal Tap, the 1984 mockumentary that satirizes the sort of indulgent behavior Tyler Martin partakes in. * During the confrontation between Achmed and Chuck inside Tyler's dressing room, the doodle often accompanying the phrase Kilroy was here can be seen.

Population: History The exact date of foundation of the settlement is unclear, although it began at some point in the early 1930s as the area's gold reserves were explored, and a labor camp of the gulag was built here. The first official mention was in June 1932, when the first bridge was built over the Palatka River. In 1937, there were around 3,000 held at the prison settlement. The name Palatka is identical with the Russian word for 'tent', which has been suggested as the origin of the town's name as during the early period of the settlement's history it existed largely as a collection of tents and semi-permanent structures. It is also suggested that the name may come from the Evenk words Palja Atken, meaning 'stony river'. In spite of its somewhat chaotic and unplanned nature, by 1939 Palatka was one of the largest settlements on the Kolyma Highway, and in August of that year began the construction of permanent dwellings. A narrow-gauge railway was built from Palatka to the harbor at Magadan, which remained in operation until 1950. In the 1960s, a sovkhoz based around farming reindeer was opened in the settlement. In the 1970s, mining activity began in nearby Karamken, and Palatka became a dormitory town for mine workers. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the closure of the reindeer farm left a great number of local people unemployed (mainly Evenks and Orochs), and the mining industry also saw a general downturn with administration moving to other localities such as Susuman. The settlement maintains sister relations with Palatka in the US state of Florida. The names are only coincidentally identical, with the name of Palatka in Florida being of Native American origin. Palatka lies on the route of the proposed future rail link between the Amur Yakutsk Mainline and Magadan.

She was requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy and fitted out as an auxiliary ammunition ship. She was part of the fleet that landed troops during the Hainan Island Operation on 9 February 1939. She was anchored at Cam Ranh Bay, French Indochina, with Imperial Japanese Navy forces in preparation for the Japanese invasion of Malaysia in December 1941. On 9 July 1942, she landed 250 members of the Hara Construction Force and security troops on Guadalcanal to help build Lunga Airfield, and then transported 50 more men to Gavutu to build installations. Kōtoku Maru left Rabaul in a convoy to resupply Buna and Gona. Disembarkation of her embarked troops of the 15th Independent Engineer Regiment began near the village of Basabua on the afternoon of 29 July 1942. The ships of the convoy came under bombardment from eight United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) A-24 Banshees of the 3rd Bombardment Group from 7-Mile Drome near Port Moresby, New Guinea, escorted by USAAF P-39 Airacobras of the 41st Fighter Squadron and 80th Fighter Squadron at 1445. She took a bomb hit on her No. 5 hatch and began taking on water. She was able to disembark all of the embarked troops, but was unable to unload any of their equipment. After heading back under her own power to Lae, she was quickly patched up to return the following day to offload the much-needed equipment. On 30 July, under the protection of the light cruiser Tatsuta and destroyer Yūzuki, she headed back to Buna at 1330. En route she was attacked by Allied aircraft at around 1515. Later she came under attack by eight B-17 Flying Fortresses of the USAAF 19th Bombardment Group and was hit by at least three 500-pound (227-kg) bombs at 1640 and was disabled. Her crew abandoned ship, and Tatsuta and Yūzuki rescued the survivors and steamed to Rabaul. The unmanned Kōtoku Maru remained afloat and adrift and ran aground near Salamaua at . The Japanese undertook salvage on her wreck, removing some of her cargo. After the Allies occupied Salamaua, they salvaged winches and other gear from her wreck on 15 July 1944. The ship remained upright until sometime after 1945, when she rolled over onto her side.

In the Federal Constitution, the majority of the Grundrechte are contained in the first title, Articles 1 to 19 of the Grundgesetz (GG). These rights have constitutional status, binding each of the country's constitutional institutions. In the event that these rights are violated and a remedy is denied by other courts, the constitution provides for an appeal to the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) (Art. 93 Abs. I Nr. 4a GG). According to this article, the Constitutional Court is entitled to hear appeals concerning not just the Grundrechte contained in Arts. 1-19, but also Art. 20 Abs. I, 33, 38, 101, 103 and 104. These rights are also therefore referred to as grundrechtsgleiche Rechte (rights equal to fundamental rights) or colloquially also as fundamental rights. Limitation In addition to the Grundrechte, the Constitution guarantees a number of other public rights, such as the uniform application of federal law between states (Art.28 (2)(1) GG) and the independence of the church (Art. 137 (3) of the Weimar Constitution and Art. 140 GG). These however are not Grundrechte as they are not contained under the first title of the constitution or in the appeal mechanism to the Federal Constitutional Court. There are also lists of fundamental rights in the majority of state constitutions, which vary slightly from one another but are never capable of ruling out a Grundrecht. Landesrechte (i.e. rights guaranteed by state constitutions) which mirror Bundesrechte (those guaranteed by the Federal Constitution) are therefore disregarded in favour of the Bundesrechte. Many state constitutions which were written after the Federal Constitution do not contain their own lists of fundamental rights at all. Applicability All the Grundrechte have a binding effect on each of the constitutional institutions, regardless of whether it is the executive, legislature or judiciary, federally or in one of the states (Länder). It is also irrelevant whether the state was directly or indirectly involved in the violation, whether it acted through public or private law or through legal entities under private law; public bodies are always bound by the Grundrechte (Art. 1(3) GG). Rights under the German constitution can also be divided between universal fundamental rights (Jedermann-Grundrechte), which are afforded to everyone, and German fundamental rights (Deutschengrundrechte, Staatsbürgerrechte or Deutschenrechte), to which only Germans are entitled. The reason for the separation is largely due to democratic will and the protection of sovereignty. The Deutschengrundrechte include the rights to freedom of assembly (Art. 8 GG), freedom of association (Art. 9 GG), freedom of abode (Art. 11 GG) and freedom to work (Art. 12 GG), as well as the right to vote and stand for public office. The restriction of these rights only to Germans does not just refer to German citizenship, German status being regulated by Art. 116 GG. While some Grundrechte apply only to Germans, there are some on which only non-Germans can rely, e.g. right to asylum (art. 16a GG). Some of the Deutschengrundrechte also apply for other citizens of the European Union with or without residence in Germany regarding their rights to move freely within Germany or to work. Nevertheless it is disputed whether all German fundamental rights apply to them in light of the prohibition of discrimination contained in Art. 18 (1) of the TFEU treaty. This article requires that all citizens of the EU are given equal status and equality of protection under all legal systems in the community. According to their contents, the Grundrechte can also be divided into freedom rights and equality rights. Protection Although the Grundgesetz might be changed with a 2/3 majority of the Bundestag, the original Fundamental Rights are protected by article 19. Modification on the first 18 articles (and article 19) is only allowed as long as the original essential contents are not removed. Where, as has happened in several instances, articles have been amended to provide for rights not spelled out in the original Basic Law, these extended rights are not protected as Fundamental Rights.

It is located 74 km northwest of the state capital Salvador, Bahia, and 22 km north of Pojuca city center. Economy In the 1960s, Miranga area became one of the major oil prospection regions in Brazil, leading to the establishment of large facilities of Petrobras (the Brazilian state-owned sole oil explorer), including several rigs, office buildings and dormitories. The oil production entered decline in the 1980s, leading to a partial economic breakdown. In the 1990s Miranga experienced a certain renaissance, when local politician Antonio 'Biriba' was elected Pojuca city representative. At the same time, a few young Brazilian entrepreneurs moved into the area and invested in rural property. They also adopted modern technology for dairy production and professional strategies for human resource management, which resulted in the marked improvement of the standards of living and overall social welfare. Miranga now has a semi-urban area, on a hill nearby the entrance of the 'farm corridor'. It has several stores, bars, two restaurants, a hostel and a catholic church on the top, dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua. Population Its permanent population is estimated in about 1400, living almost exclusively from agriculture and commerce of agricultural products. =Culture= Possibly due to its high degree of African ancestry, Miranga's people are very open and friendly, with a notable talent for music and dance. Almost every night there is a party somewhere (locally known as 'seresta'), with folk guitar and drum players, dance and even amplified guitars and keyboards. Miranga preserves many aspects of the traditional Brazilian culture that were lost in the big and medium cities. For example, polygamy is largely tolerated (however not legal), and many important business contracts are sealed with no more than a hug and a handshake. =Religion= Almost all permanent residents claim to be Roman Catholic, but rituals of African 'pagan' religions are practiced with frequence. =Ethnicity= Virtually all Miranga permanent residents are a mix of African, Brazilian Native and European. Roughly 60% of the people look African, 30% are obviously mixed and 10% look European. In the 1990s a few South-Brazilian entrepreneurs of German and Italian ancestry have bought property and moved into the area.

Its catchment area covers the north of Beverley, Leconfield, Swinemoor and Molescroft and has a capacity of around 1,500 pupils, including the Sixth Form.  History  Longcroft School has served the community of Beverley and the villages of the wider rural area since it was officially opened in 1951. In 2001 it was accredited with the specialist status of a Performing Arts College (re- accredited in 2006 and 2009), which brought with it the funds to increase class-room space, develop a fully working theatre in the school hall and extend links to the wider community and feeder primary schools. In more recent years, Longcroft acquired funding from the East Riding of Yorkshire Council and the Football Foundation to build a new sports hall and all-weather pitch. The facilities available at the school are used by many community groups and organisations during evenings, at weekends and during school holidays. The school changed its name to Longcroft School at some time between 2009 and 2012, as it was no longer a Performing Arts College. In 2015 it changed names again to become Longcroft School and Sixth Form College.  Location  Longcroft School is situated on the northern outskirts of Beverley, the campus being surrounded by countryside, the Beverley Westwood and Beverley Racecourse. The school had two main buildings, known as the Lower School (Years 7 and 8) and Upper School (Years 9, 10 and 11) up until 2019 when a planned development project was completed meaning that the former upper school now had capacity for pupils from all years. The Arts and Science Block, where the Sixth Form is based (years 12 and 13), has been attached to the Upper School in recent years by additional classrooms and learning spaces. The site is over 50 acres and includes open spaces for sporting activities.  Motto  In his History of the Anglo-Saxons, Sir Francis Palgrave (1788–1861) wrote that King Athelstan, who had prayed at the tomb of St John of Beverley before success in a battle (937 AD), showed his gratitude by giving privileges to the town of Beverley, saying: \\"As free make I thee, as heart may think, or eye may see\\". The quote was adopted as Longcroft’s motto.  Gospel choir  Founded and directed by Jonathan Chapman, the Longcroft Gospel Choir is well known in the local area, and regularly performs at parties, ceremonies, weddings and music concerts. The choir comprises students from Year 9 and above and has a large repertoire of music. Over the choir's period of existence, the choir has performed at venues such as Disneyland Paris and the Apple Store on Oxford Street, London, have released two of their own albums and have featured on a track by singer songwriter Henry Priestman. In May 2015, it was announced that the Longcroft Gospel Choir will be one of twenty choirs in the UK to perform at and open the 2015 Rugby World Cup in London performing for the home team (England).

He became friendly with Wernher von Braun, who was only three years older, although his approach was initially frosty and reticent. He covered all the manned spaceflights as well as the introduction of passenger jets from the Comet IV to Concorde. On 2 March 1969 he was the BBC's reporter on Concorde's maiden flight at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport. In April 1970, he was the first journalist to report on the Apollo 13 catastrophe via the BBC World Service when based at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center on 13 April 1970. After retiring from the BBC staff on his 60th birthday he continued working as a freelance broadcaster, writing many books and continuing as Newsround's Space Editor until the mid-1980s. In 1990 he presented Return Ticket, a five-part Radio 4 series about the Apollo 13 mission. He was largely superseded at the BBC by Christopher Wain. Writer He contributed to series of books notably the Observer's Book of Manned Spaceflight and the Observer's Book of Unmanned Spaceflight in the 1970s, published by Frederick Warne & Co. In the 1980s he edited the Jane's Spaceflight Directory. He was particularly disappointed by the cancellation of the Black Arrow British space programme in July 1971, at the very moment it was providing results. In 2003 he published his book 'The Moonlandings, An eyewitness account' in which he recounted how and why the first men landed on the moon. Turnill wrote many obituaries of people involved in aerospace and other figures for The Guardian, The Times and The Daily Telegraph, the last to appear during his lifetime being of Sir James Hamilton, who helped design Concorde's wing. It appeared in The Guardian in May 2012. Following a few months of poor health Turnill died at the Pilgrim's Hospice in Ashford, Kent, on 12 February 2013. In 2006 he won the Sir Arthur Clarke Award Lifetime Achievement Award. Personal life He married Margaret Hennings in 1938 in Westminster. They have two sons (born 1940 and 1944). He lived in Sandgate, Kent. In his early life, the 18th century poet John Clare had a great affection for the brothers John and Richard Turnill, whose father Robert was a local farmer; Robert was Reg's great-great-grandfather. In his Autobiographical Fragments, Clare says: Clare goes on to say: So the young John Turnill liked books, the stars and was of a generous nature. Clare dedicated a sonnet to him: Turnill, we toiled together all the day, And lived like hermits from the boys at play; We read and walked together round the fields, Not for the beauty that the journey yields – But muddied fish, and bragged o'er what we caught, And talked about the few old books we bought. Though low in price you knew their value well, And I thought nothing could their worth excel; And then we talked of what we wished to buy, And knowledge always kept our pockets dry. We went the nearest ways, and hummed a song, And snatched the pea pods as we went along, And often stooped for hunger on the way To eat the sour grass in the meadow hay.

The Hundru Falls is an example of a Knick point caused by rejuvenation. Knickpoint, also called a nick point or simply nick, represents breaks in slopes in the longitudinal profile of a river caused by rejuvenation.

Nesbit was educated at home and demonstrated an interest in the sciences and studied under John Dalton in Manchester. Adult life Nesbit helped introduce the natural sciences into his father's school in Kennington, in 1841. Later, he took over the school and turned it into a chemical and agricultural college. Nesbit started a consulting practice that undertook the commercial analysis of superphosphates and other artificial manures for farmers and manufacturers. He became a Fellow of the Geological Society of London and the Chemical Society in 1845. Nesbit discovered important phosphate deposits in the Ardennes in 1855, and wrote about guano fertilizers (The History and Properties of Natural Guanos, 1860) and other naturally occurring phosphates.

Line 2 on the Brussels Metro is a rapid transit line in Brussels, Belgium operated by STIB/MIVB. It exists in its current form since April 4, 2009, when the section between Delacroix metro station and Gare de l'Ouest/Weststation was opened, which allowed to close the loop from and to Simonis/Elisabeth . The configuration of the Simonis/Elisabeth metro station though does not allow trains on the line 2 to be able to perform the loop several consecutive times in the same direction, i.e. a train running clockwise from Elisabeth will have to run counterclockwise from Simonis. The two termini of line 2 have thus received different names: originally Simonis (Elisabeth) and Simonis (Leopold II), changed in November 2013 to Elisabeth and Simonis. Between the Yser/IJzer metro station and the Porte de Hal/Hallepoort station, the line runs under the small ring road of Brussels, which is itself built on the former Second walls of Brussels. The first stations on the small ring road were opened in 1970 with tramways connecting Rogier station with Porte de Namur/Naamsepoort metro station. The Louise/Louiza metro station was opened in 1985 and the Simonis metro station in 1986 but it is only in 1988 that the actual metro line 2 was first serviced with metros. The following stations also opened that year: Ribaucourt, Yser/IJzer, Hôtel des Monnaies/Munthof metro station, Porte de Hal/Hallepoort and Brussels-South railway station. The existing stations were converted in order to be serviced by metros. In 1993 the line was expanded to the Clemenceau metro station, and then to Delacroix in 2006.

The aquarium was opened in September 1955, closed on 31 May 1991, reopened as World of Aquarium in 1991 and as Fort Canning Aquarium in 1993 respectively. The Aquarium closed for the last time in 1996 and subsequently demolished in 1998. History The aquarium was named after Karel Willem Benjamin Van Kleef who was Dutch but resided in Singapore in the 19th and early 20th century. When Van Kleef died in the Netherlands in 1930, he donated a sum of $160,000 (equivalent to $8.985 million in 2014), his entire fortune, to the Singaporean government. After some considerations, it was decided in 1933 that the best option was to build an aquarium. In 1935, a site on Fort Canning Hill between Tank Road and River Valley Road was chosen as the site for the aquarium. Construction started in 1940, but it was interrupted by the Japanese invasion during World War II. Construction restarted in 1953, supplemented with funds from the city council. The aquarium eventually opened on 8 September 1955, 25 years after Van Kleef's death. When the aquarium opened, it contained 6,500 marine creatures of 180 different species. There were salt water, fresh water and swamp water tanks. The building was fully air-conditioned. 270,000 visitors came in its first year of operation. During the 1970s the average number of visitors was about 400,000 annually. =Closure= Visitor numbers had fallen to 248,000 in 1985. The aquarium was closed from 1986 to 1987 for renovations costing S$750,000. The number of visitors was not to reached its 1970s peak again. The opening of Underwater World on Sentosa island in 1991 further depressed visitor numbers. The Ministry of National Development of Singapore closed the Van Kleef Aquarium on 31 May 1991. =Further reopenings, closures and demolition= In October 1991, the aquarium was leased out to a private company and was reopened as World of Aquarium. The building's façade was renovated and the aquarium bred and sold tropical fish. World of Aquarium closed in February 1993. Several months later, the aquarium reopened again as Fort Canning Aquarium but this endeavour was also short-lived. The aquarium closed its doors for the last time in 1996. The building was demolished in 1998.

Written by Kurt Sutter and Jack LoGiudice, directed by Guy Ferland, it originally aired on October 22, 2008 in the United States. The title of the episode refers to the gathering of money the episode is centered on, and also refers to Jax and Tara acting upon their attraction to each other. The season three episode titled \\"The Push\\" is also named after a significant event in Jax and Tara's relationship. This episode features the final appearance of Jay Karnes (Josh Kohn), who was shot in the head by Jax Teller. Plot Darby receives an envelope from Kohn which contains a file on SAMCRO's dealings with the True IRA. He sets up a meeting with Alvarez and offers to give him the information if the Mayans kill Clay, which would allow the Nordics to gain a foothold in Charming while the Mayans would take over the gun-running business. Alvarez is hesitant at first, but Darby assures him that law enforcement will not investigate too closely as they will be pleased that criminals are wiping each other out. Alvarez accepts the offer and tells his son, Esai, to kill Clay as well as Darby. SAMCRO are collecting the $70,000 needed to secure another shipment of weapons. A sizeable portion of the money comes from an unwilling Luann, while the rest arrives later that day when Jax comes across a truck driver badly beaten on the highway. He says that the Nordics took his tanker truck because he owes money to them. Jax and Opie then steal the truck back and sell it to Wayne Unser for a knock-down price. Meanwhile, Half-Sack steals an unattended ambulance in a bid to pay back his debt and earn his patch, but the club dismisses the stunt as pointless and unnecessarily risky. Jax goes to the hospital to visit Abel, who Tara says is healthy enough that Jax can hold him for the first time. Gemma worries that Jax and Tara are renewing their relationship. Clay and Tig set up a meeting with McKeavey at a local Irish bar. They are instead met by Cameron Hayes, McKeavey's cousin, whom informs them that McKeavey has been beaten to death in Oakland on the orders of the port authority boss, Brenan Hefner. The deal goes ahead nonetheless, but as they raise their drinks to their fallen comrade, two Mayan gunmen come in through the door. They fire at Clay but are gunned down by Tig and the shotgun-toting barman; Cameron is shot in the buttocks. Simultaneously, the Mayans assault Darby's house and shoot a Nord footsoldier and two women, but Darby survives and manages to escape. The Sons realize that the Mayans and Nordics are allied, and that war is imminent. However, Clay and Tig are worried about Jax's commitment to a gang war. Jax assures them that he is fully committed to SAMCRO, but also voices his worries over violence destroying the club. Clay decides to call in Sons leaders from Washington, Utah and Nevada in a bid to wipe out the Mayans. Meanwhile, the stolen ambulance is used to bring Cameron to the clubhouse for medical treatment. Jax says he will get medical supplies from Tara while Chibs, a former British Army medic, will perform the surgery to remove the bullet. Jax picks up the medical supplies from Tara's house. After he leaves, Kohn emerges from Tara's bathroom and coerces her into having sex with him. At the earliest opportunity, however, she reaches for his gun and shoots him in the stomach.

Life and career Atle Bakken started his music involvement at 5 years of age by copying Glenn Miller's “Moonlight Serenade” on a Hohner melodica. He took up classical studies at 10 with Dr. Norbert Bojanowski, going through the repertoire of Grieg, Bach, Mozart and Liszt, and the likes. At 14 Bakken started his own organ jazz trio and started to perform concerts in the spirit of Larry Young and Jimmy Smith, and recorded his first radio show (at NRK). He also started performing R&B; and soul with a band a la Tower of Power. At age 15, Bakken was discovered by Sony Music A&R;, Kristian Lindeman by having recorded his own material for local talent scout & manager, Fredrik Friis. Bakken was noted nationally in Norway at age 19, at the annual Jazz Symposium in Søgne, Norway in 1980. Jazz notables such as Radka Toneff, Arild Andersen and Jon Eberson heard his talent among other students such as Sidsel Endresen and Eivind Aarset. Eberson invited Atle to join his newly founded band, Jon Eberson Group, which through Kristian Lindeman went to break all records in terms of sales for a “jazz” group in Norway, and in general, selling more than 250,000 albums. Atle consequently joined Sony Music as a producer and arranger for their Norwegian roster. From the beginning, Atle always made it a priority of utilizing electronic instruments and computers in a “human way” in his music. In the mid-seventies, Atle was the first artist in Norway to use the Oberheim 4-voice polyphonic synthesizer. Later, in the mid-80s, he was the first artist in Scandinavia to record with the Synclavier Digital Music System. (Benny Andersson of ABBA was a close second.) Atle joined ECM Records and the group Terje Rypdal & The Chasers, recording and traveling all over Europe, playing symphonic music and jazz. At the same time Atle would produce music for Schlager Records in Oslo with various artists, as well as composing music for dancetheatre, video and multimedia projects. He would also assist Terje Rypdal in his classical scorings and orchestrations for the concert stage and theatre. In 1991 Atle was invited to the US. by gospel legend Andraé Crouch to help him produce his album. He went on to work on multiple CDs and projects for Andrae Crouch, Helen Baylor, Phil Driscoll and others, winning a Grammy for Andraé Crouch's album and getting nominated for Baylor's. His longstanding collaboration with Crouch also resulted in the Gospel legends studio album Pray, which went to the top on the Billboard charts. Atle went on to tour worldwide with Andy Summers for two years and teamed up with Sting, playing at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Stevie Wonder requested Atle for work on Jungle Fever and Diana Ross's The Force Behind the Power. At the same time, Atle attended the prestigious Dick Grove School of music in Los Angeles, studying harmony and orchestration with Dr. Dick Grove and movie composer Thom Sharp. In the mid-1990s, Atle was involved with projects for Sony Music's European division and Stateside, Atle composed for three seasons on the now syndicated TV series Martin. Through his association with TV- and filmwork in Hollywood, Atle also polished his skills, working with the orchestras at various scoring sessions. Atle then formed ALEX MUSIC, and started finding new artists for recording. One of the projects, produced in association with EMI/Toshiba, was released in Japan and sold over 1 million units. Atle & Alex was recently been charted on the top of the Billboard and the European lists by producing LEANA, a Swedish artist. In 2006 Atle was requested to start the online music company Castle Entertainment. The project, with bases in Zurich, Switzerland and Ibiza, Spain has industry endorsers such as Ramon Hervey III and Andy Summers. Atle is annually and recently named in Who Is Who In Hollywood in the Hollywood Reporters Film & TV issue, mentioning the top composers in the world. Currently, of Atle is concentrating on a new personal music album and project, Future Sound of Østerdalen with his deceased great-grandfather, Ingulf Bakken, a recording which also features Wyclef Jean, Andy Summers and others.

Career A former member of the Pentecostal church, Assembly of God, she has been a sexuality educator since 1998, originally working with Planned Parenthood, later as Director of the Sexuality Learning and Resource Center and now serves as the Director of the non-profit Center for Sexual Pleasure and Health (CSPH) in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Andelloux is known for advocating that sexual pleasure is an integral part of overall sexual health, which she calls the \\"female pleasure principle\\". =Appearances= Andelloux has been an invited speaker at various colleges and universities, including Boston University Medical School, Brandeis University, Clark University, Wesleyan University, Blog for students at Wesleyan University. Brown University, Vanderbilt University, Harvard University, the Rhode Island School of Design, Tufts University, the University of Tennessee, and Yale University, as well as numerous other institutions such as the Center for Sex and Culture, and WholeDC. =Author= She is also an author of a chapter for the book We Got Issues!, Preview. a feminist response to cultural attitudes on feminism, as well as once writing for the sex worker magazine, $pread. =Advocacy= In late 2009 and early 2010, Andelloux's attempts to open The CSPH, her non- profit sexuality education center, became the center of a controversy pitting her against anti-prostitution and anti-trafficking activist Donna M. Hughes. Pdf.  The Center for Sexual Pleasure and Health  Although The CSPH was slated to open on September 26, 2009, Pawtucket Mayor James E. Doyle had \\"serious concerns about the Center for Sexual Pleasure and Health locating on Main Street\\" after he and the rest of the Pawtucket City Council received an e-mail one week prior to the scheduled opening. Although originally reported as being sent from an anonymous \\"concerned citizen\\", Lynn Comella later claimed that the e-mail had been sent by Professor Donna M. Hughes from University of Rhode Island. The e-mail read, \\"Hello, A center for 'sexual rights' and 'sexual pleasure' is opening in Pawtucket\\". Rumors circulated that The CSPH would actually function as a brothel, an abortion clinic, and a havenhouse for sex trafficking. Andelloux said the CSPH would be a place where adults can talk openly about sex, and that opposition was founded on \\"a basic fear of talking openly about sexuality\\". Under threat of arrest, Andelloux relocated the CSPH's premier event, which featured speeches such as the keynote by Carol Queen, from her leased space in The Grant Building to a nearby performance space. The Pawtucket City Council cited educational zoning restrictions as cause for their opposition. Despite the presence of other \\"educational\\" businesses that were already operating in the Grant Building, including a chess academy, Director of Administration Harvey E. Goulet denied Anelloux's application for a special permit, which drew criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union because Goulet was quoted as objecting to \\"this type of business\\" as \\"not really something we feel is appropriate for our city\\". Rhode Island ACLU executive director Steven Brown said that Goulet's comments made clear \\"the city's intent is to suppress the speech that would otherwise occur at the Center. Such content-based discrimination raises serious constitutional concerns.\\" In early 2010, the Zoning Board seemed to agree when, after many expressed regret to Ms. Andelloux for the prior tangle, the members cleared The CSPH to finally open. The Center for Sexual Pleasure and Health opened on February 2, 2010. In December 2013, the CSPH attained status as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization making the organization tax- exempt and eligible to apply for government and foundation grants. Furthermore, any donations made to The CSPH are now tax-deductible.

Owed to its high concentration of wildlife, Malka Mari National Park was gazetted in the year 1989. The park is situated along the Kenya- Ethiopia border along the Daua River. The river is in the extreme north eastern part of the country on the Mandera plateau. The climate in Malka Mari National Park is hot and dry, implying that the area scrubby and semi arid grassland is dominant. The Daua River is surrounded by palms and riparian woodland. The major attractions of the Malka Mari National Park include Malkamari fort, valleys and hills. These physical features provide beautiful and attractive scenery, a worthwhile experience for tourists and visitors. Perhaps Malka Mari National Park can be considered as the most remote national park in Kenya. There has been no permanent human settlements owing to the very arid and inhospitable climate of the region. The common inhabitants of the park are nomadic herders of the Gurreh community, though they are few in number and mostly dispersed over a wide region. Karache Urane is located at the southern end of Malka Mari National Park. The Southern part on the other hand hosts the Awara Plains. The boundary of the park to the north terminates on the Kenya-Ethiopia border. Therefore the extreme ends of Malka Mari National Park can serve as major tourist attraction sites. Visitors should be informed that it is extremely difficult and such a long journey to get to Malka Mari National Park by road. The first step is to take the A2 route of the Northern Road to Isiolo and then proceed to Moyale found on the Ethiopian border. From Moyale, you take the D504 road on the eastern side through the Yabdus and Sara hills for around 160 kilometers before reaching Banissa, a semi-permanent village that hosts an airstrip. Another alternative route that drivers may opt to take is that of Wajir. There are two roads leading to Wajir. The first one is along B9 from Mado Gashi while the second route is from Dadaab at the north eastern part of Garissa, and then proceeds along the B9 route to Tarba. A visitor should proceed further north for about 200 kilometers along d500 prior to reaching Banissa. Owed to the long distance as well as the poor road conditions at the north eastern part of the country, visitors should consider another alternative means to reach Malka Mari National Park. The best option that a visitor should consider is to charter a plane. There are two airstrips that can be used as a means of arriving at Malka Mari National Park. The first airstrip is located at Bannissa while the second one is a small airstrip that is situated in the park. Visitors should not worry about their stay at Malka Mari National Park. The park hosts a prestigious and exclusive hotel De L Horloge. The hotel offers a wide range of amenities that are highly attractive to visitors touring Malka Mari National Park. Some of the notable amenities include accessibility to wheelchair, shower or private bath, pets are allowed, air conditioning, exercise facility, handicap rooms, lounge, and business services. In addition to De L Horloge, there are also other comfortable hotels that tourists can stay in the course of their visit. The attractive scenery as well as a wide range of species of wild animals that Malka Mari National Park hosts is a good reason for tourist to make a point of visiting the place while in Kenya.

In October 2010, the team went public about the discovery of an early 15th-century Chinese Yongle Tongbao coin, the remains of an iron smelter accompanied by iron slag, and a jade-green shard of porcelain believed to come from Long Quan, a kiln that made porcelain exclusively for the royal family during the early Ming Dynasty. The discoveries may end up confirming that the date of the first international trade with East Africa is decades before the arrival of Vasco Da Gama, most likely during the expeditions of Zheng He.

The village is located in Githunguchu sub-Location, N'genda Location, Gatundu District, Gatundu South Constituency, Kiambu County. The village lies about 5 kilometres to the east of Gatundu Township. The name mararo, meaning a sleep over place, was derived from workers who used to come to work in a coffee farm established by one, Kiruthu Kimiti. Mr Kimiti used to be a senior employee in a white settler's farm about 10 kilometres further east towards Juja town. Whenever he brought workers from the settlers farm to work on his farm, they would not go back same day but stay over for sometime as he had put up a labour camp. That's how they named the village \\"the place of sleepover\\". The main economic activity in Mararo village is subsistence, dairy, coffee and macadamia farming. In some cases farmers grow bananas and avocado fruits for both subsistence and commercial sale. Like in most rural villages in Kenya, youth unemployment and alcoholism are challenges experienced in the village. Mararo village has produced some galant sons and daughters including: the late Virginia Wanjiru Kiguta, a retired nurse and one of the earliest females to study up-to form four. Fr Mungai Wainaina, a Catholic Priest, among others. The most prominent son of the village is Mr Peter Nginga Kiguta, MBS, the first person from the village to achieve Bachelor's and Masters degrees. Mr Kiguta rose to become a prominent civil servant rising to the position of Chief Economist in the Ministry of Finance, Kenya. Thereafter, he worked internationally as a very senior economist rising to the position of Director General at the East African Community Secretariat, Arusha, Tanzania. He is currently a Senior Economic Advisor in the government of Kenya and also Chairman of the Board of Directors for Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. The bureau is responsible for production of official statistics. Mr Kiguta in 2019 oversaw successful carrying out of the Kenya Household and Population Census. This was the most credible census since the one of 1969. The census report was released in a record period of one and a half months, a world record.

Marigat is a fast-growing town located in the lowlands of Baringo County. The town was named after the Ilchamus name of narrowing corners to the town Lmari lo lgat and the colonialists named if Marigat. Its growth is supported by the Perkerra irrigation scheme where onions, pepper, papaws and maize, among other crops, are grown. Marigat town is about 20 km from both the famous L. Baringo and L. Bogoria; this exposes the town to new ideology through interaction between visitors and the locals. Marketing of local products such as honey (enaisho), goat's meat (nkirri), and cultural artifacts is made effective by the surging local and foreign tourists and travellers. Tourists go for art such as braided callabush, the ilchamus club, ilchamus sheets and the tugen bow and arrows. Passengers buy onions, tomatoes, honey, water, melon, bananas, oranges from the Parkerra irrigation scheme as they wait for the bus at the Matatu stage to surprise their families. Marigat is inhabited by the Tugen (Samor) mainly from the upper regions, i.e. south, southeast and southwest, the Ilchamus mainly from the low regions northwards and at the western Pokot communities who are mainly pastoralists.

Mataara is the home to Mataara Tea Factory that produces some of the best tea in the world. It lies on the edges of the Aberdare ranges, and borders the Kieni forest. It has a very rich history, and contributed immensely during the struggle for Independence by hosting Mau mau fighters. One of the fiercest battle between the Mau mau and the colonial masters was fought here in the 1950s. Blood flowed freely in the market place, and soon after this battle, a state of emergency was declared and the villagers were moved into concentration camps. Mataara, just like many villages in the Central province Mr Peter Gicheha,a community leader says the village is grappling with the problem of illicit liquor that has seen the many young men waste away to this drink. Poor leadership is key contributor to the low education status of this otherwise very rich area. The area representative in parliament is a lowly qualified person, who does not even have a high school certificate. The region is fairly developed but has not exploited its full potential to develop and benefit the local community. there are major prominent people from this region such as former TSC boss Francis Murigi, political Elites Eng Mukora Kimani, Dr Mburu Gicheha of Anthem Group of hospitals, and musicians such as Mugwethe.
