Lee. As a separated wife and then as a widow, she was the head of her household at Lee Corner, Alexandria, Virginia, in what is now known as the Robert E. Lee Boyhood Home. Her chronic pain and straightened circumstances play a significant role in her son Robert's biography. Early life Anne was born at the family seat, Shirley Plantation in Charles City County, on March 26, 1773. She was born into a patrician family of tidewater Virginia, and was the daughter of Charles Carter (1732‚Äì1806), the fifth generation owner of Shirley Plantation, and Anne Butler (n√©e Moore) Carter (1750‚Äì1809). Through her grandfather, John Carter (1696‚Äì1742), she was the great-granddaughter of Robert \\"King\\" Carter, the 25th Speaker of the Virginia House of Burgesses from 1696 to 1697 and the Colonial Governor of Virginia from 1726 to 1727. Marriage On June 18, 1793, she married the 9th Governor of Virginia, the widower Henry \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee (1756‚Äì1818), in the mansion's parlor. After Lee retired from the governorship in December 1794, she followed him to his Lee family holdings in northern Virginia. Six children were born to this marriage:Pryor, Elizabeth Brown (October 29, 2009). \\"Robert E. Lee (ca. 1806‚Äì1870)\\". Encyclopedia Virginia .

Anne Carter Lee's time as a wealthy patrician of northern Virginia would, however, be short. Their principal plantation, Stratford Hall, was relinquished in 1808 by entail to her stepson Henry Lee IV. Her husband had suffered repeated financial reverses, characterized by poor investments, and was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1809 and move to debtor's prison. Anne Carter and \\"Light Horse Harry\\" were separated for one year while the husband was under confinement. In 1810, the reunited couple tried to resume life together in Alexandria. Despite the fall in his honor and standing, the former governor \\"Light Horse Harry\\" had maintained fervent ties to the Federalist Party, and passionately opposed the decision by the other U.S. political party, the Jeffersonians, to declare war on Great Britain in the War of 1812. In a July 1812 outbreak of political violence in Baltimore, War Hawk rioters raided a Federalist strongpoint and tried to lynch its defenders, including Harry Lee. Anne Carter Lee was forced to learn that her husband had suffered serious physical and psychological wounds in the mob outburst. As life for him in Alexandria had become impossible, Henry Lee was forced to leave his wife and family. Lee emigrated to the South Atlantic coast and the Caribbean in a series of futile attempts to find a place to recuperate from his injuries. He died on the Georgia coast on 25 March 1818, leaving Anne Carter Lee a middle-class widow. =Widowhood= As a widow and the head of her household, Anne Carter Lee brought up her surviving children during her remaining eleven years of life. A small bequest from her Carter family enabled her to maintain the house in modest comfort. She suffered, however, from chronic health conditions herself. Her medical diagnosis, if any, is unknown, and her health challenges were primarily recorded as an additional obstacle to the young life of her fourth son Robert. Born in 1807, in his adolescent years Robert E. Lee assisted his mother to run the household. Although not poor, she was not able to face college tuition bills for Robert, who therefore sought higher education opportunities at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Young Lee did not hesitate to use his mother's Carter family kinship ties to co-sign his West Point application. During young Lee's West Point years (1825-1829), Anne Carter Lee's health further declined. She clung to life until the graduation of her son, and was given a place to live and be nursed at the home of an uncle, William Henry Fitzhugh, the Fairfax County plantation of Ravensworth. Anne Hill Carter Lee died in Ravensworth on 26 July 1829. Her son Robert named one of his daughters, Anne Carter Lee (1839-1862), in honor of his mother. =Descendants= Through her son Sydney, she was the grandmother of Confederate Major General Fitzhugh Lee (1835‚Äì1905), who later became Governor of Virginia (from 1886 to 1890), diplomat and writer; and served as Major General of U.S. Volunteers during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, as well as least four more grandsons who served in the Confederate States Army or Navy. Through her son Robert, she was the grandmother of seven, including George Washington Custis Lee (1832‚Äì1913), who served as Major General in the Confederate Army and aide-de-camp to President Jefferson Davis, who died unmarried; Mary Custis Lee (1835‚Äì1918), who died unmarried; William Henry Fitzhugh Lee (1837‚Äì1891), who served as Major General in the Confederate Army who married twice; Anne Carter Lee (1839‚Äì1862), who died unmarried of typhoid fever; Eleanor Agnes Lee (1841‚Äì1873), who died unmarried of tuberculosis; Robert Edward Lee, Jr. (1843‚Äì1914), who served as Captain of the Rockbridge Artillery and who married twice; and Mildred Childe Lee (1846‚Äì1905), who died unmarried.

It is dedicated to Parascheva of the Balkans and to Anthony the Great. History First built around 1680, the church was rebuilt in 1760 by Vasile Roset. In this early phase, it was associated with the traders and craftsmen who lived in the area and desired their own place of worship. In 1792, after the Treaty of Jassy was signed, Metropolitan Iacob II Stamate blessed the church and dedicated it to Parascheva, whose relics were kept at the city's Trei Ierarhi Monastery. During his reign, it came under the jurisdiction of the Moldavia Metropolis. The year 1792 is marked on a small metal inscription placed on the eastern face of the building. Shortly thereafter, it became a monastery. Two houses with cells were built for nuns brought from Socola Monastery. Soon, Prince Alexander Mourousis moved the nuns to Agapia Monastery, and the cells were left in the hands of that establishment, as well as VƒÉratec Monastery. It was during its affiliation with the nuns that the present name was bestowed. Aside from living quarters, the nuns used the cells to teach pupils and to host students and visitors. In 1819, the church was again rebuilt by postelnic Mihail Pascu. Following earthquakes, as well as bombings during World War II, the building was seriously deteriorated, so that exterior repairs were carried out in 1959. A new support pole for the spire cross was installed and interior varnishing was done in 1966. CƒÉtƒÉlina Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site Description The church is trefoil in form, plastered on the exterior and interior. It is made of stone and brick, with a frame roof and six windows. Outside ornamentation is limited to a few simple decorative motifs of Neoclassical or Baroque inspiration. The bell tower sits atop the vestibule, while the church is entered through an added foyer. Another entrance door lies on the south face of the altar. Until the 1863 secularization of monastic estates in Romania, the church was administered by VƒÉratec Monastery. It then passed to Ia»ôi city hall, which paid the clergy's salaries, until 1892, when clerical reform again brought it under the Metropolis of Moldavia, which declared it freestanding. In 1925, when the Romanian Orthodox Church was reorganized, it became a filial of the Banu Church. The interior walls are not painted. The iconostasis is of carved wood, with the icon of the Last Supper is in the Italian style. The rest of the iconostasis icons are post-Byzantine, painted in the early 19th century. Among the valuables in the collection are the silver chalice from 1795, the 1784 Gospel Book from R√¢mnic and the 1821 one from Neam»õ Monastery, and the 1824 silver communion box. There is also a sewn epitaphios from 1880 and a wooden pulpit carved in the early 19th century. While Parascheva is the principal patron, it is not known when the dedication to the secondary patron, Anthony, took place, as no relevant documents survive. Short history at the Mitocul Maicilor parish site The church is close to the palace of Alexandru Ion Cuza, today the Union Museum, and served as his personal chapel. Thus, it has been known as Cuza's Church. His throne forms part of its property. The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

Along with troops form other Warsaw Pact countries, the BNA participated in the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. However, other than this, the BNA did not see any combat during its existence. The Bulgarian People's Army dissolved along with the People's Republic of Bulgaria in 1990 and was succeeded by the Bulgarian Armed Forces. History The People's Republic of Bulgaria formed the BNA on September 8, 1944 after the Soviet Union invaded Bulgaria and installed the communist government. In 1952 it was officially named the Bulgarian People's Army. In the period between 1948 and 1952 it was involved in repelling attacks by the Greek Army. It joined the Warsaw Pact on May 14, 1955 and activities in the alliance include the Warsaw Pact Invasion of Czechoslovakia. On October 23, 1968, the 22 Artillery Regiment that invaded the country withdrew from Czechoslovakia. It advised North Korea in the Korean War and provided medical assistance to the troops of North Korea. It also advised the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War. During the 1950s, 60s and 70s the BNA assisted countries like Algeria, Yemen, Libya, Iraq, Nicaragua, Egypt, and Syria as well as taking part in action in Afghanistan in the 1980s.

Banda, who was in her 30s when she took over the position in 2008, was the youngest First Lady in Zambia's history. She is the current wife of former President Rupiah Banda. Biography Rupiah Banda's first wife, Hope Mwansa Makulu, died in 2000. He and his second wife, Thandiwe Banda, married during the 2000s, despite an age gap of nearly forty years. He was around 70 years at the time of their wedding, while she was in her 30s. Thandiwe and Rupiah Banda are the parents of twin boys, Temwani and Dunia, whose conception came as a surprise to both, according to an interview she gave with BBC Africa. Banda was elected President in 2008, making Thandiwe Banda the youngest First Lady in Zambia's history. During her tenure, Banda advocated for the creation of an official office for the First Lady with a government-funded budget to support her public duties and charities. She focused on women's issues, including healthcare and child care, during her tenure. Banda campaigned for stronger legislation to punish perpetrators of domestic and sexual violence. She was also a proponent of the work of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operating in Zambia. On December 20, 2011, the government-run Times of Zambia newspaper published an article alleging that the government had seized several of Thandiwe Banda's properties, including a hotel in Malawi, worth billions of kwacha. Banda called the allegations false and demanded an apology and a retraction, which the newspaper initially refused. In January 2012, she filed a lawsuit for libel against the Times of Zambia and its editor-in-chief. In October 2012, the newspaper issued an apology and retracted the article, but the suit against the newspaper continued.

New York: Psychology Press. Murphy was instrumental in changing the ways in which children were viewed in psychology‚Äîprevious work tended to focus on pathology, while Murphy emphasized more positive and social elements, including normal development and the development of empathy and ethics in children. She collaborated on 16 works with her husband, Gardner Murphy, published a book about his work after his death as well as several on her own work.Sullivan, P. (January 1, 2004). Child Psychologist Lois Barclay Murphy. The Washington Post. Retrieved from https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2004/01/01/child-psychologist- lois-barclay-murphy/fd3fc28d-85c2-4771-9c77-8a2d5cb00648/ She founded the Early Childhood Center (EEC), a college laboratory school focused on child development, at St Lawrence College in 1937 which is still in operation today. l Murphy was given the G. Stanley Hall Award in developmental psychology in recognition of her contributions to the field. Biography Murphy was born to May (Hartley), a teacher and Wade Barclay Barclay, a pastor. Her parents expected all of their children to make significant contributions to the world, which was an unusual expectation of women at the time. As the oldest of five children, she played a big role in caring for her younger siblings. Due to her parents' careers, the family moved frequently and by her 16th birthday they had moved 13 times. During this time she was struck by how different lives were for rural and urban children and noted how some were neglected and thought of poorly. She married Garner Murphy in 1924 and they had two children together. Murphy's partnership was helpful academically; it allowed her to make great strides in her field. Murphy disliked the behaviorist approach to child psychology that was popular at the time, specifically Watson's ideas about the discipline of children, so it wasn't until she was introduced to her future husband, Gardner Murphy, and other psychologists with less strict views that she kindled a serious interest in developmental psychology. She died of congestive heart failure at the age of 101 on December 24, 2003. Career Focus  Murphy graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a major in economics and minors in religion and psychology from Vassar in 1923. Her honors thesis investigated life at a girls' reform school; the investigation exposed her to a bitter, almost prison-like environment. The school did not reform girls, but Murphy‚Äôs investigative thesis helped reform the institution. She went on to obtain her masters from Union Theological Seminary in 1928, and became a founding faculty member at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, where she taught Comparative Religions. She stayed only a year, and in 1929 enrolled in Columbia College in the graduate psychology program. She earned her doctorate in 1937 and her dissertation was published in a book, Social behavior and child personality (1937). Murphy's research cut against the behaviorist perspectives of John B. Watson, which were dominant at the time. Watson's ideas on children were widely respected, but Murphy stood her ground with her research since she thought Watson didn't really understand children. In order to explore her ideas on child psychology further, she went back to Sarah Lawrence College in 1937 and founded The Nursery School, a laboratory where she could research children's personality development. Murphy also looked at the positive aspects of social development, such as the origin of sympathy. In 1941 she was The Nursery School's first director. The same year she became director, she published Methods for the Study of Personality in Young Children, which was based on the research done at The Nursery School. \\"Theories of free-play, Rorschach analysis of children, and the application of the Miniature Life Toy Technique were all explored during her time at the school.\\" Later she combined many sources of data in a single case, a case study of one child at The Nursery School, Colin: A Normal Child (1956). While she was at Sarah Lawrence College she also published, Emotional Factors in Learning (1944) and Achievement in the College Years (1960). In 1952 Murphy and her husband both accepted positions in Topeka Kansas at the Menninger Foundation, which was a clinic, sanatorium, and a school of psychiatry. Murphy was the coordinator of the Coping Project for the foundation. The project was research on how children deal with the stress of growing up, and got its funding from the National Institute of Mental Health. In 1976 she published her findings as Vulnerability, Coping and Growth from Infancy to Adolescence. While she was in Topeka she also was a consultant on the new Head Start program and was the chair of the Governor's Preschool Committee. Murphy only stayed in Topeka until 1968, when she and her husband obtained positions in Washington D.C. Murphy took a position as a research consultant at the Children's Hospital in D.C. during her stay in Washington, until her husband passed in 1979. While in Washington D.C., she was also a guest scientist at the National Institutes of Health. In 1981, she received the G. Stanley Hall Award from the American Psychological Association for her work in developmental psychology. Not only that, but she was a member in a number of other organizations, the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues, American Orthopsychiatry Association, and the New York Academy of Sciences. Legacy Murphy thought research on children focused too much on aggression and conflict in the years following WWI, and so she went against the common current of those studying child development by exploring sympathy and other positive aspects of child social development. As part of her research, Murphy developed a preschool at Sarah Lawrence College, where she and her research team utilized projective, open-ended and even unstructured tasks to assess children's personalities, instead of using traditional laboratory tests that were more likely to frustrate the children. While this approach was criticized by some, Murphy's methods widened the boundaries of what were considered appropriate methods for studying child development. Following the deaths of Henry Ladd, Eugene Lerner, and Anna Hartoch, three of Murphy's close friends, she expanded her research and founded the study of coping, which wasn't an area of study until after her work. She published a collected volume of her work on coping in 1976, titled Vulnerability, Coping and Growth. In addition to her work within the field of psychology, Murphy was active in work related to other social programs. In 1950, Murphy helped found the B.M. Institute of Child Development and Mental Health in Ahmedabad, India, and in the 1960s she was instrumental in developing the Head Start program as part of Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty.Magai, C. and McFadden, S. H. (1995). The Role of Emotions in Social and Personality Development: History, Theory, and Research. New York: Plenum Press. Murphy left behind a lot for the developmental psychology field to build off of. Throughout her years as a researcher, Murphy successfully published 16 books, many of which have a deep focus on developmental properties of infants and young children. Murphy is recognized as one of the first to document feelings of sympathy in preschoolers. Because of her contributions to the field of psychology, and child care and development, Murphy received multiple awards, including the G. Stanley Hall Award and the Dolly Madison Award of the National Center of Clinical Infant programs. While Murphy had a widely varied career, she is best known for expanding the study of child development to include more positive social aspects. As she said herself: \\"I hope that insofar as I am remembered, it would be as a person who tried to conceptualize and communicate positive aspects of children's development in integrated terms.\\"Murphy, L.B.

It shares boundaries with Oranto in the south, Isiekwulu to the east, Akaezi to the northeast, Akpu to the north and west, all within Ukpo town. Natural resources Orofia's natural resources include bauxite, ceramic, and soil that is nearly 100% arable. Agro-based activities like fishery and farming, as well as land cultivated for pasturing and animal husbandry also add to the rich natural resources of Orofia. Orofia village is the leading rice producer in Ukpo. Economy The Oye market in the area draws buyers and sellers from different parts of the town and the state as a whole, thereby improving economic status of the community. There is also presence of a water- bottling company in the area, owned by the famous philanthropist and oil baron Arthur Eze. The area also hosts the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, Ukpo. It also hosts the bank of agriculture of Ukpo. Geography The village is bordered by the villages of Akpu, Akaezi, Oranto, and Isiekwulu. There are several rivers and streams in the town, some of which act as natural boundaries with neighboring towns like the Ali stream. The soil in the village is rich in nutrients and supports the commercial farming of several local crops, such as yam, cassava, rice and other vegetables. Geology The area is situated in the Anambra basin, one of seven stratigraphic basins in Nigeria. The area is of the Ameki formation from the Eocene epoch, and it consists of ferruginous, unconsolidated sandstone and sand-rich heterolithic bedding. The basal part is the shale, and the sandstone is a prolific aquifer. The presence of some sharp contacts between the sandstone and the shale results in springs and rivers flowing in some areas. This Ameki formation is underlain by the Paleocene Imo formation and overlain by the Oligocene Ogwashi-Asaba formation History The Orofia people are of Igbo descent, with some Igala population. The village is made up of three kindred: Ezuogu kindred, Enuora kindred, and the Adagbe kindred. Izuogu was a warrior, and conquered many hamlets during his time. He brought back the hamlet's properties to a centre in his domicile that was named Amaizuogu. He begot so many sons and grandsons, including Nwokeabia, Nwankwo, Madumelu, Ochife, Afulukwe, Akata, and Ezulu. Madumelu, the son of Nwokeabia, then became a powerful priest and custodian of the Udo dynasty.

It was built from 1840s circa to 1890s circa. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Tarong Homestead was established in about 1842 with the arrival of James Borthwick to the South Burnett region. Soon after the run was acquired by Borthwick's manager, George Clapperton who retained the property until his death in 1875 when it was transferred to his estate. Tarong Homestead remains in the ownership of the Clapperton family. In late 1842, John James Malcolm Borthwick, from Buaraba Homestead near Ipswich, and William Elliott Oliver visited Taromeo Homestead on their way north seeking land for establishing pastoral runs. After leaving Taromeo, Oliver soon discovered land on which he established Nanango Station and Borthwick continued northward where he decided upon 260 square miles of land which was to become Tarong Station. Although he is believed to have established Tarong by the end of 1842, Borthwick did not receive official notification in 1850 of the acceptance of his tender for the 27 400 acres comprising the Tarong run, two years after the Burnett Pastoral District was established. A depasturing license was issued to Borthwick and Oliver by the New South Wales Government in 1844 (the separation of Queensland not occurring until 1859). Borthwick seems to have spent very little time at Tarong from an early date soon after its establishment, leaving the day-to-day running of the property to his manager George Clapperton. In 1857 Clapperton acquired the lease of the property and it is through a series of diaries, journals, ledgers and letterbooks kept by him that a record of much of the history of Tarong Station after the mid 1850s is kept. Clapperton was a prominent local citizen, involved with most local activities, including lobbying the government for the laying out of a township at Nanango. During Clapperton's ownership Tarong changed from principally a sheep station, to a sheep and cattle station in the 1870s, and under his son's ownership to a cattle station toward the end of the nineteenth century reflecting the region's future prominence in cattle production. Although a comprehensive history of the complex of buildings at Tarong Station has not been established, an approximate guide to construction on the station can be discerned from the surviving records. The principal residence was constructed in three stages, the first as the residence of Borthwick, the second as the kitchen wing and the third stage as another general residential wing. It is thought that the first section of the homestead was constructed in the 1840s. This is the south western wing of the extant complex, and is constructed from vertical adze cut timber slabs housed in dressed timber beams at the base and top of the walls. This building originally had a gabled roof clad with shingles and extending, with a lower pitch, over verandahs at the front and rear. There is little evidence to suggest a building date only that it was probably built within a few years of the arrival of Borthwick on the property. The building is similar in construction technique and age to structures on other early homesteads including the first stage of the Canning Downs principal residence built in about 1847 and also to the first stage of Cressbrook also built in the mid 1840s. Substantial building work seems to have been carried out at Tarong in the 1850s, a time when more substantial records exists of life at the station. The woolstore, which no longer stands but was to the south of the residence, was thought to have been completed in the 1850s, as was the kitchen wing. In 1856 reports of the garden suggest that it was \\"in a poor state of cultivation having been for long used as a sheep yard, occasionally as a green barley park, and again as a maize field.\\" attempts were made, therefore, to improve the garden and fences were constructed, and in the next few years a large number of exotic trees and plants were introduced including orange and lemon trees; walnut trees; chestnut trees; peach, nectarine and apricot trees; bergamot plant; pear trees; plum, sage and cherry plants and fig trees. The diaries give very good records of the work completed in the gardens; walks were laid out and a gardener's cottage constructed in 1874 and garden beds were bordered with brick edging in October 1884. In 1856 the kitchen wing was constructed perpendicular to the original house and using slabs of timber from earlier slab huts and shingling from trees on the property. The construction work was completed by general employees of Tarong. In 1870 a chimney was constructed near the kitchen, which collapsed in 1872 and required replacement, which was done in conjunction with the covering of the shingled roof with iron sheeting. On 15 December 1875 George Clapperton died, leaving the property to his wife, Anne Clapperton who later remarried, assuming the name of her husband, George Wilson. As a result of Clapperton's death, a small cemetery to the north west of the residence was established to house his grave stone. The cemetery continues to be used as the Clapperton family grave yard. Throughout the 1870s and 1880s improvements were made to the residence at Tarong, including papering and painting walls and ceilings and constructing a fireplace in the dining room, which was the largest room of the first building and the room closest to the kitchen. The kitchen was white washed in 1881 and extensively refitted internally in November 1887. In June 1874 a brickmaker was employed full-time at Tarong making brick for use at the property and also for selling locally as closer settlement increased the population in the Nanango area. The next major phase of building was the construction of the five roomed square planned wing within the cavity of the L-shaped plan created by the kitchen and original residence. The Wilsons, who now owned Tarong, employed a local carpenter, Mr Hugh Davidson, to plan and calculate the quantity of timber for the proposed building in January 1890 and throughout 1890 the building was constructed firstly by Davidson, who was paid out and left in March, and then by another local carpenter, Jimmy Walsh. Assistance was offered to the entire project by a Mr Moppett who worked at Tarong for many years carrying out small carpentering, painting and papering jobs to the buildings. The new building was planned and timber was both bought from a local timber supplier, Parsons and acquired from the property for shingling. The unusual four panelled timber doors were acquired from a Mr Heimer in Nanango. By November 1890 the carpentering work was complete and Moppett was left with the wall papering and making and laying of carpets. Early in 1891 Moppett constructed and white- washed a chimney, presumably in the new section as he then went about repairing the other chimneys in the residence complex. From April until May 1891 cedar boarded ceilings, skirtings and other mouldings were erected in the residence. In December of that year Moppett constructed wardrobes and lined and papered the original dining room in the eh first wing of the house. At some time in the early twentieth century the verandahs of the 1890 section of the Tarong residence were extended, also necessitating the replacement of the shingled roof with a low pitched corrugated iron clad hipped roof. Many smaller buildings on the site were constructed including the meat room which was converted from an old store in June 1862; a bath house built on the lagoon in 1880; and other removals and reuse of timber among the smaller buildings. The original lease holding of Tarong was reduced with the government encouraging closer settlement in the South Burnett region. This happened over many years from the 1870s, to consolidation in the mid 1880s and to the early twentieth century when two Land Acts (1897 and 1902) allowed the resumption of much of the lease. The resumption in June 1910 generated a long-running court case over the level of compensation. The government offered ¬£1,745 while Clapperton claimed ¬£41,174. Eventually the Land Court determined a compensation of ¬£9,654.  Description  Historic photo of Tarong Station Tarong Homestead comprises 630 acres of land bordered to the north by Cooyar Creek. The principal residence is situated on elevated land, overlooking flats to the south-west and north west. The principal residence at Tarong comprises three timber buildings, of varying ages, separate in structure but joined by verandahs, an internal garden courtyard and a semi open breezeway. The first section, constructed in the 1840s, is a long, one room width, section running south east to north west; the kitchen constructed in 1859, runs perpendicular to the first wing and is joined to it at the south eastern end by a verandah. In the cavity of the L-shaped plan created by the two first buildings is a square planned building surrounded by verandahs built in 1890. The three sections manifest different timber construction methods. Access to the residence at Tarong is via the verandah of either the earliest section or through the wider verandahs of the 1890s buildings. The earliest section of the building is constructed from adze cut, unpainted vertical timber slabs housed in painted timber bearers at the base and top of the walls. The building has a corrugated iron clad gabled roof, steeply pitched over the rooms and changing to a more gradual pitch over the front and rear verandah. At the south eastern end of this section, projecting from the original dining room which was at this end, is another fireplace formed from bricks clad with corrugated iron sheeting projecting from the end of the building. Adjoining the dining room on the north eastern side is a skillion roofed and timber framed extension clad with horizontal chamfered boards. Most of this section of the residence is elevated only very slightly from the ground level, although a gentle tapering downwards to the north west necessitates open tread timber steps providing access to the south western verandah. This wing houses three principal rooms, with additional rooms of modern fitout added to the two ends. The rooms have access both to the front, south western verandah and to the rear verandah via both pairs of French doors and timber four panelled doors. The north eastern wall of this section of the residence is clad with fibrous cement sheeting. Internally this building has raked timber beaded board ceilings, timber boarded floors and timber boarded walls. Later V-J pine boarding lines the internal walls up to the level of the start of the ceiling rake in the two smaller rooms. The larger room, originally the dining room has a dark green hessian backed wall paper and a patterned frieze featuring a stylised landscape design. A small timber lined room, on the original south western verandah is entered from the former dining room. At the north western end of this part of the residence is a small two roomed extension, fitted as a bathroom with small gauge corrugated iron clad walls and fibrous cement internal lining. The kitchen wing, the smallest of the three sections of the residence, comprises only two principal rooms and is of similar vertical slab construction, but the vertical slabs in some places are rounded and chamfered at the top and base. The building has a corrugated iron hipped roof, again steeply pitched over the main rooms and more gradual over the front and rear verandahs. An iron ventilator with decorative cap projects through the ridge of the roof. Attached to the south western end of the kitchen is a substantial brick chimney which services the main kitchen oven and a bread oven in that end of the building. The north eastern end of the kitchen wing supports a large climbing plant which, though picturesque, threatens to overtake the building. Internally the kitchen wing has a raked ceiling clad with unpainted cedar beaded boards, a timber boarded floor and an early white lime paint on all internal walls. The door to the kitchen from the north western verandah comprises three adze cut timber slabs, braced on the rear side. Early internal fittings in the kitchen include small cupboards, a long preparation bench, the stove and associated bread stove; and shelving. At the north eastern end of the kitchen block is a small storage room, with raked ceiling, unpainted timber lining boards and a boarded floor. The 1890 section of the homestead, elevated on round timber posts, comprises five rooms of varying sizes all opening onto a wide verandah which surrounds the section. This section has a low pitched hipped roof clad with corrugated iron sheets, extending over the verandahs where it is lined with fibrous cement lining sheets with timber cover strips concealing edges. The verandah is supported on slender square planned posts which have partially chamfered corners and sit on the hand rail of the chamfer board cladded balustrade. Infilling some of the verandah openings are a series of early timber louvres. The building is constructed from wide, horizontal hardwood slabs housed in dressed vertical studs. Doors and windows in this section are housed frames between the studs. The windows are vertical sash with two sheets of glass per pane. The doors in this section of the building are four panelled with bolection mouldings on the horizontal edges of the panels and chamfered vertical edges. Above most of the doors but separated by two sections of timber slab, are operable transom windows, aligned with the ceiling line. A fireplace is found in the eastern corner of this section, formed by white washed bricks which project from one of the principal rooms onto the verandah space and taper towards the ceiling. A slender chimney, of unpainted cream bricks, projects from the roof and is crowned with a simple corbelled top. Adjacent to the south west side of the base of the chimney, on the verandah, is a timber V-J boarded phone box. Internally this section of Tarong, which comprises five rooms, has cedar beaded board ceilings and timber boarded floors and V-J boarded walls lined with paper. The wall paper is backed with a hessian based lining in most of the rooms and is complete with a frieze paper, complementing the general wall paper. The paper in each room is different but four of the papers are of the same type vertical pattern and water-wave embossing on a satin base. Also in these rooms are sections of early linoleum and oil cloth floor coverings. One of the rooms features another paper, without lining, of an orange and yellow background and printed white large floral design and green and yellow patterned frieze. Early furniture and fittings, including wardrobes, drawers, shelving units, chimney mantle and fireplace survive in this part of the residence. To the south east of the residence are a number of timber outbuildings, of various ages and construction types. Furthest to the south of this group of buildings is a hipped roof building clad with horizontal weatherboards and with a skillioned extension to the south, thought to be an early fowl house. One of the more substantial outbuildings is a timber framed and gable roofed structure, partially of vertical slab construction and most recently in use as a garage but formerly a residence, with two shallow hipped roofed extensions on either end. There are several other gabled roofed structures clad with horizontal weatherboards and in varying states of deterioration. From this section and continuing eastward are a number of aligned round timber posts which are remnant from an early woodshed. To the north west of the residence are two more outbuildings, both with hipped roofs clad with corrugated iron one of masonry and timber construction and the other timber framed and cladded. To the north, north west and north east of the house are remnants of a large garden. Stone terracing and walling and extensive timber paling fences survive as do many established trees and plantings. The trees in this area include a jacaranda, several figs, pepperina, and orange trees. To the north west of this area is a small graveyard containing seven gravestones, mostly of the Clapperton family, dating from 1876 to about 1980. The graveyard is bordered with a course and recent single rail timber log fence without a gate. Extending eastward from the graveyard are a number of established olive trees planted in a line. Further to the north west are timber posts and remnants of an early woolstore and complex built on this site. To the south west of the house at the base of the spur is a substantial lagoon, on the banks of which are timber posts, remnants from an early bath house and water slide. As well many trees and early plantings surround the lagoon. About distant from the house to the north west is a power line supported on large three tiered metal power poles.  Heritage listing  Tarong Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Tarong Homestead was established by John James Malcolm Borthwick in about 1842, one of the first runs taken in the Wide Bay/Burnett area. The run demonstrates the development of Queensland, particularly this area from the establishment of pastoral holdings in the 1840s to closer settlement from the 1870s. The property illustrates the development of pastoral practices in Queensland, particularly the development of the beef industry in the South Burnett Region. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Tarong has many rare built elements including an 1840s slab hut; an 1859 slab kitchen and surviving wallpaper in six rooms probably dating from the late nineteenth century. The site remains remarkably intact, despite continual additions. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The early date of Tarong with its many extant features and extensive early documentation suggest that a potential exists for further historical and archaeological research which may yield information which will contribute to an understanding of early Queensland station life. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of an early Queensland pastoral station. The arrangement of the early buildings and their relationship to outbuildings provides important evidence of early station life. The buildings comprising the residence demonstrate three nineteenth century methods of timber construction; with two forms of vertical slab construction and a later horizontal slab building. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Tarong has aesthetic significance; the entire site has a picturesque quality resulting from the layering of various periods of building construction over many years and the siting of these buildings overlooking the surrounding flats. The residence has architectural significance for its composition and planning, producing an environmentally sensitive and comfortable building. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Tarong has special associations with the South Burnett community as one of their first settled stations and a place of employment for local residents and their families many of whom remain in the area. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place is associated with the Clapperton family who have owned Tarong since 1857 and were instrumental in the development of the South Burnett region and the town of Nanango.

Geoff Todd works between studios in Winnellie, NT, and Ararat, Victoria. Geoff Todd's childhood was one on a small dairy farm in certain isolation in Gippsland, Victoria. \\"For our small family, it was a life constricted by the rigid demands of dairy-farming: we had no television or ready transport and life was, of necessity, restricted to the immediate landscape. However for children, such as an environment provided challenges and adventure and, with barely two years between us, my brother Geoff and I were constant companions outside school, traversing the countryside with dogs and bicycles.\\" \\"The landscape itself had a vitality combined with clarity of line, which reinforced our youthful sense of exploration and discovery; yet even here there was an element of darkness, for the end of World War 11 was still close enough to be tangible. Both our parents had served in the forces and the house was full of books about the war. These books featured the work of war artists as well as photographs and fifty years later Geoff would seek to replace them, for as well as there their obvious impact on childish imaginations, these images continue to resonate through his work. The traces of such early influences surfaces even now in the Victoria Cross Winners series and, more dramatically still, in the blood paintings.\\" In 1978 Todd's \\"Book Sculptures\\" were first exhibited at Powell Street Gallery in Melbourne, they were then re-exhibited at the Victorian Ministry for the Arts in 1980 before he extended the concept to his \\"Dictionary Paintings\\" which were exhibited in Christine Abraham's Gallery in 1984 and then re- exhibited in the Victoria House Gallery, London, UK before travelling back to the Museums and Art Galleries of the Northern Territory. At first Todd worked a concept of using all the actual materials and processes of conventional books but ignored the written content, he finally worked his way to his \\"Comic Book Sculpture\\" which focuses on the story (content) and does not resemble a book in any way. These objects, mostly multiples, he called sculptures. \\"Using silk screen, etching, wood block prints and collage he has made reproductions of a number of well-known magazines, how-to-draw books, children's story books, and even an illustrated dictionary. Carefully bound and presented they seem at first to be identical with the objects of everyday use but once opened are seen to be quite different.\\" The Australian, 31/08/1978 A selection of Todd's book sculptures traveled Australia and the USA in 1978 in the Artists' Books/Bookworks exhibition. \\"\\"Books as books, or books as sculptures? I believe that each is the other: but there is a delightful ambiguous presence within the concept. Artist' Books/Bookworks, Ewing George Paton Galleries, The experimental Art Foundation and the Institute of Modern Art. . \\"What happens when you make a portrait of a well-known book or magazine, using paper pages (printed and bound after many copies are made) yet the visual images are not representational? Though the portrait is the same size and format as the original and appropriate colours are used, the content is vague. Are such portraits realistic sculptures or simply more books?\\" Artist' Books/Bookworks, Ewing George Paton Galleries, The experimental Art Foundation and the Institute of Modern Art. . 1994 was a year of public commissions for Todd in the Northern Territory. The newly constructed State Square in Darwin saw Todd's interpretations of Coats of Arms on the facades of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory and the Northern Territory Parliament House. Within Parliament House he completed the lobby floor stone, brass and steel inlay while a third coat of arms graces the parliamentary chamber. His painterly way of working led to him executing full scale coloured drawings on canvas to work from. Some of these large drawings have been acquired by the Northern territory Museums and Art Galleries' permanent collection, complete with burn marks and scratches suffered during the construction process. Northern Territory Chronicle 1974-1998 Looking North. The Art of Geoff Todd In 1984, Geoff traveled across Australia to Arnhem Land where he worked with traditional Aboriginal artists. During Geoff Todd's time in the Top End of Australia, the proximity of Indonesia allowed for convenient travel there. His work in Indonesia is in many permanent collections within museums in various Indonesian cities. \\"In 1999, Todd held an exhibition at Benteng Vredeberg (The Dutch Fort)in Yogyakarta, Java, which was opened by Prince Prabukusomo (the younger brother to the current Sultan Hamengkubuwono X of Yogyakarta ). The public response to this exhibition established him as a respected artist within Indonesia as well as Australia.\\"http://www.florencebiennale.org/en/past-editions/ Mistik. 9 June 1999. published a cover story. Inilah Partai Pemenang Pemilu (This is the Electoral Winning Party). It appeared that Todd‚Äôs exhibition staged at the time of the Indonesian election had put the Sultan of Yogyakarta under some pressure to stand for election. \\"Opening the exhibition, Prince Prabukusumo, the brother of Java‚Äôs spiritual leader, the Sultan of Yogykarta, likened Todd‚Äôs work to Raden Saleh and Affandi, the acknowledged masters of 19th- and 20th-century Indonesian art. The paintings were a surprise for me because Geoff Todd is a foreigner and he captured the spirit of the son of my great- great-grandfather,\\" Prabukusumo told the Bulletin.The Bulletin 20 April 1999 \\"Indeed, the overwhelming public interest in Todd's exhibition is a reflection of renewed interest in the warrior hero whose uncorrupted leadership qualities are sought like never before. As the first free election in more than three decades is due to take place on 7 June, Todd's work highlights many of the characteristics voters will be searching for among the candidates. \\"We want someone like Diponegoro. Someone clean and daring\\" explains (Indonesian artist) Ardiyanto Pranata\\".The Bulletin 20 April 1999 Many believed Hamengku Buwono X was the man. Geoff Todd is an artist whose strong figurative work reveals intimate, personal and sometimes erotic connections with his subjects, while pursuing broader themes. \\"In a career spanning over forty years Geoff Todd's practice has consistently expressed his commitment to social justice and activism, while also reflecting his responses to wider political issues ranging from the so-called 'Bali Nine' arrests in 2005, to September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. These have also, quite often conflicted with Todd's innate modesty, and his (unwarranted) concern that they might be perceived as grandstanding or in someway manipulative.\\" Walton, Inga, \\"War Paint: Protest & Social Activism in the works of Geoff Todd\\", in Art Monthly Australia Issue 264, October, 2013, p. 25-29 Inspiration for Todd is found across a wide spectrum, but whether concerning himself with simple nude studies Todd, Geoff, Artful Drawing from the Nude, OTH Gallery Publication, 2009 to a portrait of Judas, Todd tends to evoke some feeling. Of his portrait of Judas, Gubar writes \\"Todd's image emphasizes guilt, remorse, a conviction about one's own worthlessness. Less a demon, more a monk or mendicant, a hopeless Judas atoning in desolate silence clarifies how it feels to be John's son of perdition, an anathema.\\"Gubar, Susan, Judas: A Biography, W.W. Norton & Co, New York, 2009, p. 252, 254-55. Figurative art led Todd to pursue the challenge of translating three dimensional form into two dimensional drawing and painting. In doing this he always chooses to work from life, believing that to work from a photograph is allowing the camera to do the difficult work. While he understands the importance of the finished image produced and arriving at this result is different roads for different people, personally he enjoys the conservative idea of hand and eye coordination and experimenting with line to describe 3D illusion on 2D surfaces. He argues for honesty to oneself and suggests the landscape, a still life or even animals allow for a bit of fudging so he spends much time working from the nude model. Todd writes \\"Why the Nude? To be confident in drawing (as opposed to the quaint idea of \\"mark making\\") one does need to be able to draw - that is, to make the mark go where it is wanted. And this can be learned - but of course, it must be remembered, that a lot of fine \\"drawers\\" are not necessarily fine \\"artists\\".\\" Artful Drawing from the Nude, OTH Gallery Publication, 2009 The Darwin gallery, Framed chose to feature Todd's work for their closing exhibition after thirty years. This solo show along with the accompanying book, \\"Reflections\\" revealed thirty years of the artist's work and his thought processes. He has continued to defend the idea that while minor accidents may occur in art works to fine effect, the artist really needs to be in overall control of his/her work to be able to call it Art. \\"Having a need to draw sometimes causes one to look harder. \\"What will I draw?\\" is more easily answered when an artist is looking, not just thinking. After all, we are called Visual Artists.\\" Todd, Geoff, Reflections, Published by Sprout Creative, 2017 ,  Education and employment  *Graduate Diploma Visual Arts, Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education, ( Now Monash University ) *Diploma in Fine Arts, Bendigo Institute of Technology, ( Now LaTrobe University ) *Diploma in Technical Teaching, Hawthorn Institute of Technology, ( Now University of Melbourne ) During the 1970s and 1980s Todd worked as an art teacher in Victorian State Technical schools, Tottenham, Mooroolbark,Shepparton and Monterey.

She is known for her research in the fields of temperament and social development, emotional development, and development of attention. She has founded Birth to Three, which is a parent support and education program. She has written over 159 articles related to educational psychology, developmental psychology, developmental cognitive neuroscience and biological psychology. Rothbart has also authored and co-authored many books, including Becoming Who We Are, for which she received the Eleanor Maccoby Book Award from the American Psychological Association. Two other popular volumes by Rothbart are Temperament, a Handbook of Child Psychology, and Attention in Early Development: Themes and Variations. Personal life Rothbart was born in Lewistown, Montana, in May 1940 to Mary Louise Klevjord. Her father, who came from Norway, was a teacher and her mother was a housewife. Rothbart was the oldest of four daughters. Though born in Montana, Rothbart's father joined the military during World War II, which resulted in most of her early years living in Utah and Washington. After attending high school in Utah, she then enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. This is where her love of learning was sparked and where she met her husband Myron Rothbart, also a social psychologist. After graduating, both Rothbarts went to Stanford, where she graduated with a doctoral degree in social psychology. While at Stanford Rothbart gave birth to her first son, then 20 months later gave birth to her second son. Her second son was born in Montreal, where Rothbart's husband was working. During her son's early years, she took three years off to stay at home with them, which led her to research development and temperament of children. She had looked into what research was available on child temperament at the time and there was not much work beyond an early study by Alexander Thomas and Stella Chess (New York Longitudinal Study). She would go on to spend countless hours interviewing and observing children and their emotional responses to outside stimuli in the process of developing the Infant Behavior Questionnaire in to define temperament in small children. Rothbart then accepted a teaching position from the University of Oregon, where she spent the rest of her teaching and research career. She is now retired from her teaching career, but continues to conduct research. Education Rothbart earned her B.A in Psychology (1962) from Reed College in Portland, Oregon. She went on to earn her Ph.D in Psychology (1966) from Stanford University. Rothbart worked closely with developmental psychologist Eleanor Maccoby who served as her major advisor and mentor while she attended Stanford University. She has dedicated most of her work to the study of child development and temperament. Professional career After receiving her Ph.D., Rothbart became a faculty member at the University of Oregon, where she conducted research on the development of emotions and attention in early childhood and infancy. She is best known for her research with individual differences in infant temperament. Although her primary focus was on researching with infants, Rothbart also conducted research on temperament in early childhood all the way to adolescence. Rothbart has also conducted research on attention, the development of emotions, and social development. Rothbart retired as a Professor Emerita of Psychology from the University of Oregon. Although retired, Rothbart continues to assist her peers including Dr. Michael Posner in her field of expertise. Rothbart continues to focus on educational and developmental psychology. Contributions Rothbart is a leading expert in infant temperament development and has authored many articles and books on this subject. She drew generalizations about the development of temperament in small children by identifying emotional reactions. Rothbart developed parent- and self-report questionnaires for assessing temperament in infancy, childhood, early adolescence, and adulthood. She has also developed standardized laboratory assessments of temperament, and has conducted extensive laboratory work on the early development of the emotions, impulsivity, activity, and attention. In her work, she drew distinctions between \\"effortless control\\" used to inhibit a dominant response in order to perform a subdominant response and \\"effortful control\\" consisting of abilities required to voluntarily manage attention regulation. This work examined the development of control behaviors needed to adapt to situations and suppress impulsivity, especially when the child did not particularly want to do so. Her methods of assessing infant temperament would evolve into the infant Behavior Questionnaire, developed in 1981 and still widely used today. This technique, called the Infant Behavior Questionnaire, is commonly used among researchers studying infant behavior and temperament today. Using this questionnaire in combination with home and laboratory observations has helped infant researchers obtain more accurate data on their participants. Rothbart also uses self-report surveys for her participants, but only when she is assessing participants who are old enough to give accurate self-report data. Rothbart conducted important research with Doug Derryberry to observe the emotional reactions and the different temperaments of children between the ages of three to eight. Another important collaboration involved psychologist Michael Posner, and resulted in a number of seminal papers on development of self- regulation, as well as publication of the book Educating the Human Brain. =Cognitive development= Rothbart has also done significant research on cognitive development. In 2007 she researched the differences in the human brain and how it changes over the years. She also did research on differences in education style and how this influences development. She also worked within the realm of social psychology in 2011 doing research on the brain states involved in hypnosis. She has used her knowledge on temperament in the varying ages of individuals and has begun applying it to other areas of psychology. In 2015 Rothbart did research involving the use of temperament in how mental disorders are viewed and categorized. Her most recent work done in 2016 was the role of temperament in personality. =Birth to Three= Rothbart is also the founder of Birth to Three, a program that aims to serve children who have disabilities in cognitive, physical, communication, emotional, and social development. This program has helped reach parents and children across the United States to offer support and education for infant development. Because of her tremendous contributions to the Birth to Three program, Rothbart was awarded the Birth to Three's Champion of Children award. Awards Dr. Rothbart has received several awards for her contributions in social and developmental psychology. In 2009, she received the Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in the Science of Psychology from the American Psychological Foundation. She is also the recipient of the Block Award from the Society of Personality and Social Psychology, the Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions to Child Development from the Society for Research in Child Development, and the G. Stanley Hall Award for Distinguished Contribution to Developmental Psychology from the American Psychological Association. Dr. Rothbart was also awarded the Elenor Maccoby Book Award from Division 7 (Developmental Psychology) of the American Psychological Association for her book Becoming Who We Are. This book discusses the role of temperament in developing personality traits as well as biological and social influences on temperament. Becoming Who We Are combines theories on temperament with research that Rothbart and other leading temperament researchers have conducted in order to give more detail about temperament and its implications in later life. She also discusses intervention plans in order to help children who have a difficult temperament. =Other major awards= *Birth to Three's Champion of Children Award (Birth to Three) *Block Award (SPSP) award for research accomplishment in personality research.

It was built from the 1850s to the 1870s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Boondooma Homestead is located on the Mundubbera-Durong Road in Boondooma. The Boondooma Run was originally taken up in 1846 by the Lawson brothers and Robert Alexander, and the homestead site today includes a number of historic buildings, including a stone building and timber house erected in the 1850s, and several timber outbuildings. Searches for pastoral land in Queensland extended north in the early 1840s after the Moreton Bay region was opened for selection following the closure of the penal colony. Initial leases were taken up in the Moreton Bay, Darling Downs and Brisbane Valley regions and by 1842, explorations such as those led by Henry Stuart Russell had spread further north. Russell first came to Queensland in 1840 to stay with cousins on the Darling Downs, and in the subsequent year established Eton Vale on the Downs in partnership with his brother, Sydenham. In conjunction with others Russell made exploratory expeditions to the Wide Bay area and in 1842 he was the first European to pass through what was later to become Boondooma whilst exploring the area west of Tiaro with William H Orton and an Aborigine named Jemmy. In the following year, he took up Burrandowan run on the Borne River as a sheep station and other squatters soon followed his example in establishing themselves in the area. Two of these were brothers Alexander Robertson Lawson and Robert Lawson, who set up Boondooma Station as a sheep run in 1846 along with Robert Alexander. Temporary huts and sheds were erected on the site and by 1851 Boondooma comprised the runs of Boondooma, Jua, Waringa and Waagineraganya, while Piar, Dangarabungy and Weir Weir were subsequently acquired. The Boondooma lease was applied for on 31 October 1851 by the Lawson brothers and Alexander, and approved the following year. In 1863 the lease remained in the Lawson family but was transferred to Alexander Robertson Lawson solely. Four years later, in 1867, Boondooma lease was transferred to William Oswald Gilchrist and John Young, before being transferred to Gilchrist solely in 1872 and then held jointly by Gilchrist and John Brown Watt in 1888. It seems unlikely that Gilchrist, Young or Watt resided at the property and it continued to be managed by the Lawsons until 1870 when they were succeeded by George Munro. Despite an outbreak of scab in 1853 which caused the loss of 17,000 sheep, the property prospered during this early period as a successful sheep run. A wool scour and pressing plant were established on the Boyne River, allowing wool to be cleaned and baled before being backloaded by teamsters who arrived with supplies. This continued until the early 1890s when, due to the spread of spear grass, the owners were forced to dispose of the sheep and restock with cattle. The period from the 1850s to the 1870s was in general an era of expansion for Boondooma and this is reflected in its physical growth at the time. In November 1855, Alexander Robertson Lawson married Emily Mountford Ball and the following year a son named Robert was born. By that time, it seems plans had already been made to replace an earlier house, which was reputedly located on an area archaeologically identified as being later used for a fowl house, with a larger residence to accommodate the Lawson family. Station correspondence from this period reveals building supplies and furniture being ordered in September 1855, including door hinges, locks, handles, window glass, wallpaper, calico for the wooden walls, a drawing room table and chairs, a hand basin, cooking stove, and bath. By late 1856, the Boondooma wages book indicates that 2 carpenters, John Groom and John Moules, were employed at the station. Both carpenters worked at Boondooma until mid-1857, along with a team of 5 other tradesmen under their supervision, and it is most likely that the main timber house, which is still standing, was constructed during this period. At much the same time, it seems the stone storeroom and an adjoining timber meat house were also being erected. The stone building was constructed from roughly coursed local rock obtained from a nearby quarry, sawn timbers, logs, and antbed, and was built by Wilhelm Brill, a stonemason. Brill was born in Germany in 1811 and arrived in Brisbane on 12 January 1853 on board the Johan Caesar. With his family, Brill first moved to Toowoomba before making his way to Boondooma by August 1855. In the mid-1850s, the Lawsons were actively recruiting German workers owing to the general \\"scarcity of labour and the satisfaction those already in our service have given us\\" and the Boondooma wages book shows Brill was employed as a stonemason from 24 May 1856 to 21 July 1857. He remained at the station until 1861 working as a shepherd, thereafter moving to Ipswich and then to Toowoomba where he died in 1886. The main stone structure remains well preserved and Brill's familiarity with metric dimensions makes this building one of the earliest in Queensland constructed to metric standards. Although Boondooma was not officially registered as a postal receiving office until 1900, the structure commonly referred to as the post office was built during the early 1860s after Joseph Booth won the contract for the weekly postal run to serve the Burnett district, which passed through Boondooma. Extensions to this building were added during the 1950s. Another structure from the 1860s is often referred to as the cook's room. It was a three-panelled building originally used as a dairy, wash house and cook's room, and the only extant physical remain is one standing post. A separate dining room and cooling shed were reputedly built on the site during the 1870s. The dining room was later used as a kitchen and at some stage was linked to the homestead by a covered walkway. Adjacent to the dining room was a cooling shed built at much the same time from Cyprus pine and with a wooden shingle roof which has since been replaced by corrugated iron. In 1885, the consolidated Boondooma holding was brought under the provisions of the Crown Lands Act of 1884 and was accordingly divided into of leased land in the name of Gilchrist and Watt and of resumed area. At this time, George Munro served as manager of Boondooma and was succeeded by his son, Peter Munro, in 1895. George Munro died on 24 March 1895 at Boondooma and his grave and tombstone remain on the site. In 1898 the lease to Boondooma was obtained by EJ McConnel, a member of the well-known Cressbrook Pastoral Company, and when title was transferred in 1904, it was to DC McConnel & Sons. The McConnel family were pioneer pastoralists in the Brisbane River Valley, establishing Cressbrook in 1841, the first sheep run in the district. The company of DC McConnel and Sons was established by David Cannon McConnel prior to his death in 1885 in partnership with his sons James Henry, David Rose, Eric Walter and Edward John, and daughter Mary McLeod Banks. None of the McConnel family ever resided at Boondooma and it was immediately used as collateral for a stock mortgage of . David Stevens served as manager of the station from 1898 to 1908, succeeded by Archie Graham. In 1905, the government resumed a further of Boondooma, reducing the holding to . Three years later a further of land was resumed from Boondooma, at which time the station was released from the mortgage acquired in 1904 and operated by the Marshlands Pastoral Company, which had 3 McConnel family members as shareholders. In 1913, when the lease on Boondooma expired, it was thrown open for selection. A large portion was retained by the McConnels, including the homestead block, but in 1922 the lease was again open for selection with Fred Palethorpe, who became Deputy Commissioner of Police, successful in obtaining the homestead site. From Palethorpe the property was transferred to Jane Ann Thomson in the mid-1920s and then to her son, Edward Thomson. During the Thomsons' time at Boondooma it was used as a dairy farm as well as for growing cotton and rearing cattle. In 1975, the Wondai Shire Council received a Federal Government grant to acquire the site and the Council in association with the Boondooma Historical Society have since maintained an ongoing programme of conservation. Over the years since the establishment of the Boondooma Run in 1846, land resumptions and tenure changes have resulted in the reduction of the homestead site to its present size. It remains, however, a site of significant historical value. Although natural deterioration and an auction held in 1919 to sell the jackaroo quarters, buggy shed, blacksmith's shop and several other ancillary structures have reduced the number of extant structures at Boondooma, there remains on the site a number of buildings which are important in reflecting Queensland's early pastoral development. The importance of this site has been recognized by the formation of the Boondooma Homestead Committee, instituted to facilitate the ongoing conservation of the homestead and surrounding buildings, and the receipt in 2001 of a Community Garden Grants Award.  Description  The Boondooma Homestead complex is located near the junction of Boondooma Creek and the Boyne River, in a corridor of land between the two waterways that is less than wide. Part of the Boyne River has been dammed to create the Boondooma Dam, which is adjacent to the Homestead site. Its eastern boundary is situated on the Mundubbera- Durong Road, approximately west of the town of Wondai, which is north of Kingaroy. The principal surviving buildings in the homestead complex include a stone building and timber house from the 1850s; a dining room erected during the 1870s, a walkway between the house and the dining room; a cooling shed; cow bails (prior to 1939 used as stables); a structure which functioned as a postal receiving office from the 1860s; and a garage built in the 1950s. The various built elements are disposed around the site according to their functional relationship to one another. = Stone Building = The stone building is located at the southern end of the property, furthermost from the Mundubbera-Durong Road. In plan it comprises a rectangular core of random rubble laid in rough courses, which is flanked by a verandah on each long side. The verandah roof to the south-west is continuous with the main gabled roof, while that to the north-east is separate, meeting the core's wall just below the eaves line. The pitch on both verandah roofs is slightly reduced from that of the main roof. All bargeboards are timber. A single line of guttering is fixed to the north-eastern edge of the main roof. All these roofs are clad in corrugated galvanised iron. The timber rafters are exposed on the interior, and some battening from the original shingle roof is still evident. The walls of the central core are constructed of large sections of stone arranged roughly in courses, between which smaller pieces have been inserted. The whole construction is jointed with mortar made from termite mounds (antbed). The stonework continues to the underside of the main roof, except at each gable end where roughly sawn, vertical timber slabs have been fixed. The lean-to verandahs have post and sapling frames and are enclosed with vertical timber slabs on the western ends of their northern and southern facades, and on their short western facades. All windows and doors have timber lintels and frames. The windows have shutters made of vertical timber slabs, which open onto the interior. They also have vertical iron bars. A window in the north- eastern facade has horizontal and vertical bars. A 1997 archaeological investigation suggests that the timber posts remaining adjacent to the south- western facade were part of the adjoining meat house. Internally, the core space comprises one large room with unlined walls and exposed timber roof framing. A number of ironbark roof ties are in place. Paint on the stonework may be indicative of previous partitioning. The floor is constructed of wide, hardwood shot-edge boards. Beneath this lining are timber joists and bearers. = Timber House = The single-storey house has a broken-back, hipped roof clad in corrugated galvanised iron. A detached single-storey kitchen, with a similarly clad pyramid roof, is centred adjacent to its south-western facade. This roof has a simple vent piece fitted at its peak. A small, skillion-roofed structure is also appended to its south-eastern face. At the western corner of the house, between the kitchen building and another skillion-roofed extension, a covered walkway is attached. This structure links the house to a dining room to its north-west, and is constructed of a post and sapling frame with a curved corrugated iron roof. A short section of the walkway roof, close to the house, is no longer in place. The underside of the front verandah roof is not lined, revealing that a great number of the original timber shingles remain in place under the roof sheeting. The deterioration of this verandah floor, which is lined with shot-edge timber boards like the south-western one, reveals that the floor joists of the house and the timber verandah posts bear on an outer line of bedlogs. The house is laid out with a central band of rooms running north-west to south-east along the length of the rectangle. A long, thin outer room on the north-west wraps around to take a small part of the front verandah facing north-east. This room, and a small one adjacent to it, have been formed by enclosing the former open verandah. A second verandah area remains on the south-west of the house, between the core and the kitchen building. Its southern end has been enclosed to make a small room. A large fireplace projects into this verandah space from one of the main rooms. Its lower half is clad in wide, vertical timber boards, matching those used elsewhere, and its upper half under the roof is clad in sheet steel. The steel-clad chimneystack is visible above the main roof. The external walls are clad in a variety of materials. The north eastern facade to the verandah is clad in wide chamferboards, except for a short section at its eastern end where there are wide, timber boards fitted vertically. This boarding pattern also appears on the south-western facade to the second verandah, which is adjacent to the kitchen. On the north-western facade, and partly on the north- eastern one, there are unpainted weatherboards. Unpainted, horizontal timber boards clad the south-west facing walls of the kitchen building and the small extension next to the walkway. These boards appear to fit between the exposed vertical framing members. The timber wall framing is also exposed on each verandah. The skillion-roofed extension on the south-east of the house is clad in roughly sawn, unpainted timber slabs fitted vertically. Some corrugated iron has been fixed to the remainder of the south-eastern facade of the house, where the brick fireplace has collapsed. Four sets of French or double doors open from the three central rooms onto the north-eastern verandah, while two open onto the south-west facing one. The internal doors are four-panelled with simple bolection mouldings. The timber-framed windows, some of which have fixed- louvre shutters, are generally casement with three or four panes. Joinery to the main section of the house, incorporating the three main rooms, is finely detailed and includes a variety of mouldings. The wall framing is exposed in these rooms, and where it appears around the remaining fireplace and the doors to that room, it is finely moulded. Most joinery elements are painted in either white, or various shades of green and blue-green. The walls are constructed of wide, vertical timber boards that appear to have been stained or oiled. Numerous layers of wallpaper and backing material are evident, some of which have been papered over with magazines cuttings. Remnants of ceiling paper and associated backing materials, and various types of linoleum are also evident in some areas. The floors are largely finished with shot-edge timber boards, while the ceilings in the largest of the three rooms are finished with painted timber boards. In the room with the extant fireplace, there is a simple pattern to the floorboards around its edge. The floor to ceiling height is generally about , however in the larger room on the south- east end of the house it follows the slope of the roof for part of its length. In the main room there is a picture rail fitted at approximately and above this the walls are lined with horizontal timber boards to match the ceiling. The external walls to the secondary rooms, particularly those that infill the verandah space to the north-west are not lined. The internal walls they share with the main part of the house are lined to match those rooms, as are their floors. The ceilings in this external band of rooms are unlined and slope to follow the pitch of the roof. It is here, as in the verandah areas, where the shingles are visible. The walls to the detached kitchen are unlined and the framing is exposed. The boards are painted and simple mouldings fixed at the joints with the framing. The stove recess is lined with corrugated iron. Its pyramid roof ceiling is lined with unpainted, horizontal timber boards, with beading fixed at each joint. = Other Timber Structures on Homestead Site = The other remaining timber structures on the homestead site are similar in terms of design and construction techniques; incorporating post and sapling frames, corrugated iron roof sheeting, and walls lined with vertical and horizontal slabs and weatherboards. Some of the walls to the covered walkway are clad in corrugated iron, while parts of its floor is made with wide, roughly sawn timber slabs apparently laid on the ground. The small, gable- roofed structure to the north-west of the timber house (originally a dining room) currently has open walls, with some wall slab remnants located nearby. Its gables are in-filled with steel mesh. Adjacent to the south-west face of this structure is the cooling shed, which was a part of the creamery. This is also a small gable-roofed structure, however its gables are filled with weatherboards, and its walls are clad in rough-sawn timber slabs fitted horizontally between the exposed frame. To the south-east of the timber house is located the milk or cow bails, and the stockyards. This building is a long rectangle in plan, is gable-roofed and its end walls are clad in rough-sawn timber slabs fitted vertically. There are timber posts and rails still evident inside the shed and marking the pens of the stockyards. The post office is located west of the cow bails. It also is a gable-roofed structure with an attached skillion-roofed garage and awning. The post office walls are clad in rough-sawn timber slabs, fitted vertically, while its gables are clad in weatherboards. The garage walls are also clad in weatherboards. Further west is a stand-alone garage structure with a skillion roof and unevenly clad walls matching those of the post office.  Grounds  The grounds in which the homestead complex is located shows evidence of a formally laid out garden comprising an orchard of citrus trees, and mature plantings such as blackbean, bottle, oak, pine and pepperina trees. Trellises for grape vines, garden beds and various fences are also evident located adjacent to the timber house.  Heritage listing  Boondooma Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Boondooma station was established in 1846 by the Lawson brothers and Robert Alexander in the wake of Henry Stuart Russell's exploration of the Burnett River district in 1842. The Boondooma Homestead site stands as important surviving evidence of the early exploration and settlement of the Upper Burnnett region, and its buildings are indicative of early pastoral life in Queensland. The physical growth of the site reflects periods of economic prosperity in Queensland, whilst periods of rural hardship can be reflected in the abandonment and sale of structures. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Boondooma comprises built elements that are now uncommon examples of construction methods and techniques. The principal historic buildings include an 1850s stone storehouse, which is both rare in its method of construction and an early example of the use of the metric standard in Queensland. The main house and the post office are also important surviving structures. The survival of interior finishes in the main timber house, including wallpapers and linoleums, contributes to its rarity. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The site remains a good example of the early vernacular homestead and contains a range of ancillary buildings in varying states of preservation. It provides present generations the opportunity to observe and understand the operation of early pastoral stations, and through further historical and archaeological research the site also has the potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of early European settlement in the Burnett region. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Boondooma site is an example of a homestead setting, with remnants of other structures including various outbuildings, graves, fences and mature trees. The relationship between these elements contributes to an understanding of early station life and as such it is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Homestead site provides a relatively well-preserved and vivid example of vernacular architecture of the Queensland pastoral frontier and its aesthetic significance is enhanced by the ongoing preservation of the site. The individual buildings that remain reveal a high degree of workmanship and design. The use of local resources for building, as evidenced most notably in the stone building on the site in which rubble obtained from a nearby quarry and antbed are used for construction, demonstrates a high degree of skill and highlights the adaptive lifestyle of Queensland's pastoral pioneers. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Boondooma remains valued by the local community for its strong and very important links with early pioneers of the Burnett district, including the Lawson family.

The centre was officially inaugurated on 2 September 2013 by then-president of UEFA, Michel Platini, after the first stage of construction was completed. History The Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina, aware of the fact that it did not own training facilities for its national team selections, drafted out plans for the construction of a modern training centre in the mid-2000s, quickly securing funds for the project and deciding on the location. A suburb of Zenica was chosen because the town's Bilino Polje Stadium was the national team's home ground at the time. The implementation of the project coincided with large-scale, politically motivated turbulences in the organization that eventually led to a FIFA-issued short-term suspension on all competitive national team selections. The instability in the governing body of Bosnian football led to the shelving of the project, for it to reemerge only after an UEFA-sponsored Normalization Committee was formed, which included the likes of Ivica Osim, Du≈°an Bajeviƒá, Faruk Had≈æibegiƒá, Darko Ljubojeviƒá and Sead Kajtaz. The Committee, being assigned full executive power as a means for solving the aforementioned issues in the FA, immediately sped up the training centre project, with construction beginning in early 2011. Construction was completed in late 2013, with the centre being officially inaugurated by Michel Platini on 2 September 2013. On 21 September 2015, after a two-year expansion project, new facilities, including an indoor arena were opened. Facilities The training centre consists of one artificial and two natural turf pitches, an indoor Futsal arena, terraces, a 27-room hotel, wellness centre, restaurant, indoor and outdoor caf√©s, two large conference rooms, a recreational lobby and designated administration and technical premises. Furthermore, it is encompassed by a large private parking lot, entrance gates and a main square. On 23 October 2015 the centre was granted UEFA and FIFA PRO licences, and has subsequently hosted women's and youth qualifiers.

Kozloff (1923-2012) was an American microbiologist and virologist. He served on the faculty of the University of Chicago, the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, and University of California, San Francisco, where he became dean of the UCSF Graduate Division. Kozloff retired from UCSF in 1993. He died of heart failure in 2012. Early life and education Kozloff was born in 1923 in Chicago. After finishing high school early, he attended University of Chicago and graduated with a degree in biochemistry at age 19. He served in the United States Navy for a time, then returned to Chicago for his Ph.D., which he received in 1948 for work with Earl Evans. Academic career Kozloff was offered a faculty position in the Division of Biological Sciences at University of Chicago following the completion of his Ph.D., and he remained at the school until 1963, when he moved to the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. While there he served as co-founding editor of the Journal of Virology, launched in 1967 under the leadership of Kozloff, Norman Salzman, and founding editor-in-chief Robert R. Wagner. In 1980 Kozloff moved again to University of California, San Francisco, where he served as the dean of the Graduate Division from 1981 to 1991. He retired in 1993. In recognition of his interest in graduate student education, a graduate fellowship was established in his name. Research Kozloff's research in virology concentrated on bacteriophages, or viruses that infect bacteria; he was part of the network of scientists studying similar problems known at the time as the \\"phage group\\". Kozloff was particularly interested in the biochemistry of viral replication and was among the early users of radiolabeling to trace this process. While at Chicago, Kozloff and Frank Putnam reported the then-surprising discovery that a fraction of the phosphorus found in the DNA of a bacteriophage virus would be incorporated into the phage's progeny; this observation was important evidence in establishing the genetic role of DNA. While in Colorado, Kozloff developed a new research interest in ice-nucleating bacteria. Personal life Kozloff and his wife had four children; his daughter Sarah Kozloff is a professor of film at Vassar College. Kozloff died of heart failure in 2012 at age 88.

The group's sound combined striking three-part vocal harmonies and Jody Wence's jangling keyboards, with professional production techniques that were outside of the garage band norm. During the E-Types' recording career, the band released five singles, including their most notable record \\"Put the Clock Back on the Wall\\". Although the band was short-lived, the E-Types had a profound presence in San Francisco's live scene and, years after their disbandment, the group recorded a reunion album. History Formed in 1965, the E-Types featured Bob Wence (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Don Sheppard (lead guitar), Danny Monigold (bass guitar), Jody Wence (keyboards) and Reggie Shaffer (drums), all of whom had some past experience in various folk rock bands. The group's pop-oriented blend of British Invasion and Byrds-esque garage rock, coupled with polished musicianship quickly secured the E-Types' popularity among the San Jose teen community, which bestowed upon the band the title of \\"Salinas Beatles\\". Taking notice of the group's notoriety, a friend of the band and occasional backup guitarist, Larry Hosford, offered the E-Types two of his own self-penned songs \\"I Can't Do It\\" and \\"Long Before\\" for their debut single. After the single was released on Link Records, it achieved considerable airplay, and came to the attention of Dot Records, which distributed it nationally on its own label. The E-Types' next single \\"She Moves Me\\", recorded with producer Ed Cobb and released on Sunburst Records, also received some spins on the radio, which was followed by the group's performance of the song on Dick Clark's Where the Action Is. Its B-side, \\"Love of the Loved\\", is a cover version of an early Lennon-McCartney composition, demoed by the Beatles, but never officially released by the Fab Four until the release of the I Saw Her Standing There compilation album in 1992. During this time, the band embarked on a tour across California, establishing themselves as a live favorite with San Francisco and San Jose hippies. The E-Types often headlined shows with ? and the Mysterians, Paul Revere and the Raiders, and Jefferson Airplane, while breaking an attendance record at Santa Cruz's Coconut Grove (later broken again by the Everly Brothers). In 1967, the E-Types released their third single \\"Put the Clock Back on the Wall\\", a regionally favorite song which received national airplay. Penned by songwriters Alan Gordon and Gary Bonner (best known for writing \\"Happy Together\\" by the Turtles\\"), \\"Put the Clock Back on the Wall\\" is described by critic Beverly Paterson as a psychedelic pop classic \\"bristled with tight orchestration, circled by the E-Types' signature pitch of right on choruses\\". The song is well-documented on compilation albums, including Off the Wall, Nuggets, Volume 4, and the 1998 expanded version of Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965‚Äì1968. Another single, \\"Big City\\", was distributed on Uptown Records later in the year, but Sheppards' recurrent illness and mismanagement of the band lead to line-up changes in 1968. Sheppard and Monigold left the E-Types and were replaced by Terry Shehorn on Larry Hosford respectively. Under the recording alias Charolette Wood, the group released \\"Friendly Indians\\" before disbanding at the end of 1968. In 1995, Sundazed Records released Introducing...The E-Types, an album which contains released material, demos, and live performances. Bob Wence, Monigold, and Shaffer arranged a reunion tour in 1998, and released the studio album Chase the Moon later in the year.

It is considered the last racially motivated lynching to occur in South Carolina. The subsequent trial gained much media attention, and was covered by Rebecca West for The New Yorker. The trial resulted in the acquittal of 31 white men who had been charged with Earle's murder. Arrest and lynching On February 15, a Greenville cab driver named Thomas Watson Brown was robbed and stabbed to death in Pickens County. Based on circumstantial evidence, Earle was charged in Brown's attack, and was arrested at his mother's house the next day and taken to the county jail. On the evening of February 16, a convoy of taxi drivers drove to the jail and forcibly procured Earle's release. They beat, stabbed and shot Earle to death. Strom Thurmond, the newly elected governor of the state, condemned the murder. Thurmond directed state police to work alongside the FBI, and summoned South Carolina's foremost prosecutor, Solicitor Robert T. Ashmore to try the case. More than 150 suspects were questioned in the days after Earle's murder, and 31‚Äîall but three of whom were taxi drivers‚Äîwere charged with the crime. Many of the men signed confessions and some of them implicated Roosevelt Carlos Hurd as the mob's leader as well as the one who killed Earle with a shotgun. Trial The trial opened in the Greenville County Courthouse on May 5, 1947, and was presided over by Judge J. Robert Martin. The jury consisted of 12 white men. In addition to West's coverage for The New Yorker, Life Magazine was represented by a reporter and photographer, and national and international wire services were present in the courtroom. The trial lasted two weeks, during which time the defendants were permitted to sit with their families; the effect, according to West, was that of a \\"church picnic.\\" The defendants were represented by attorneys John Bolt Culbertson and Thomas A. Wofford who later became United States Senator of South Carolina. During the trial, Culbertson proclaimed that \\"Willie Earle is dead and I wish more like him was dead.\\" Christopher Waldrep, Racial Violence on Trial: A Handbook with Cases, Laws, and Documents, 227Culbertson, considered a 'liberal lion' in South Carolina, later called this \\"the only instance that I have ever been ashamed of my role as attorney.\\" Culbertson papers, South Carolina Political Collections, University of South Carolina Libraries, page 4 Wofford criticized law enforcement representatives, and commented that \\"It took a nigger undertaker to find out there had been a lynching.\\" The defense called no witnesses, and the jury convened on the afternoon of May 21. After five hours and 13 minutes, they returned a verdict of not guilty on all counts. Judge Martin was described as \\"shaken and angry\\", and left the courtroom without thanking the jury for its service. Aftermath On May 23, The New York Times editorialized \\"There has been a victory for law, even though Willie Earle's slayers will not be punished for what they did. A precedent has been set. Members of lynching mobs may now know that they do not bask in universal approval, even in their own disgraced communities, and they may begin to fear that someday, on sufficient evidence and with sufficient courage, a Southern lynching case jury will convict.\\" In 1950, lawyers from the NAACP, citing a provision dated 1895 in the state constitution that assessed financial responsibility for a lynching, won a settlement from Greenville County in the amount of $3,000 on behalf of Earle's family. The same year, then state representative Fritz Hollings wrote an anti-lynching bill that was signed into law, specifying the death penalty as punishment for lynching. \\"No further lynchings occurred in South Carolina.\\" References Further reading * External links * Opera in Greenville, Rebecca West, The New Yorker, June 14, 1947 * Historical marker at site of Willie Earle's death Earle, Willie 1947 murders in the United States February 1947 events Lynching deaths in South Carolina Greenville, South Carolina 1947 in South Carolina History of racism in South Carolina ","title":"Lynching of Willie Earle"},{"id":"51449194","text":"Boksburg High School is a public high school in Boksburg, a suburb of Ekurhuleni, South Africa.

Some classes have computers and specialised software for students in specific subject disciplines such as the software used in the teaching of Geography students. Houses The School's houses are Celts, Gauls, Picts and Scots represented by the colours red, purple, green and yellow or gold respectively. The school house system was founded early in the school's history, based on similar systems prevalent in English schools. They were based on European tribes. Each house is overseen by a Dean who is assisted by one or more Deputy Deans. Students are grouped according to classes assigned to a teacher (faculty member) who is a member of that house. Each class elects a Class Representative who is a member of the RCL. Matric students elect tw‚Ä≤o House Captains who act as Deputy Directors on the Executive Committee of the RCL and they elect other members of the executive committee of the RCL as well. All houses have equal representation except when one or both of the Directors come from that House. Houses participate and compete in inter-house cultural and sports competitions against each other such as the Inter House Athletics competition and the Grade 8 Revue. The aggregate performance of each House over the academic year is totalled across four categories (spirit, academics, sport and culture) and ranked at the end of the year. The best house overall is awarded the Viking Cup, while the best house(s) in academics, sport, spirit and culture are awarded the Polaris, Gladiator, Valkyrie and Havamal Cups respectively. Each house holds an assembly at least once a week should the weather permit in one of the school's quadrangles on an annual rotation in which important announcements are made, cheers and chants are rehearsed, registers are taken, and dress and hair are inspected, among other activities.

History Hawthorne Gospel Church was founded on June 5, 1925 but has roots in a campaign in Paterson from April 4 to May 23, 1915, by evangelist Billy Sunday. As a result of the campaign, a ladies‚Äô Bible class was begun, taught by Mrs. Alma Fischer. One of the men, waiting for his wife at the Bible class, suggested that they consider Sunday afternoon meetings that would not be held at ‚Äúchurch time.‚Äù Although all were active in a variety of different churches, they felt the need for steady Bible teaching and to hear evangelistic messages. Two of the men would see about renting the Lafayette Avenue Fire Hall for this purpose. On June 5, 1925, the Sunday afternoon meetings for Bible study began in that Fire Hall and a few months later, Sunday School began with 24 children attending. It did not take long before the group sponsored weeknight meetings with special speakers. These meetings, held during the summers of 1928 to 1933, were conducted in tents, the first located on property on Lafayette Avenue where the Louis Bay II Library now stands. As time passed the group became more and more connected and decided that the area did need another church that would reach out to the people in the Hawthorne community. So on Thanksgiving Day, 1930, there was the dedication of a church building on Lafayette Avenue, a few doors up the street from the Fire Hall. The Hawthorne Gospel Mission as it was originally known became the Hawthorne Gospel Church in 1932.http://hawthornegospel.org/our- history/ *In 1925, Hawthorne Gospel was founded. *In 1932, The Hawthorne Gospel Mission as it was originally known became the Hawthorne Gospel Church *In 1934, Hermann G.

He described numerous species of insect, especially the thrips, catalogued Indian insect pests, taught, and wrote a landmark textbook of entomology, the Handbook of Economic Entomology for South India (1940).  Biography  T.V. Ramakrishna Ayyar in 1919, sitting, fourth from right contemporary calendars made by the US Department of Agriculture Ayyar was born at Tarakad in Palghat to Vaidyanatha Ayyar, an advocate, and Meenakshiammal. The family had moved to Palghat from Tanjore nearly a century ago., he was the second of three brothers. His early schooling was at the Native High School and later at Victoria College, Palghat. He received a degree in zoology from the Madras Christian College in 1898 and was awarded a Buckie studentship to continue postgraduate studies. He then went to teach at Maharajah's College in Cochin from 1900 to 1904. A younger brother T.V. Subrahmaniam also became an entomologist. In 1904, he joined as a Research Assistant to Prof. H. Maxwell-Lefroy at Muzzafarpur. His early work was in examining the natural parasites of bollworm in Surat. In 1905, he moved to the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute at Pusa and in 1906 he obtained a transfer to the Madras Agricultural Department on the recommendation of Lefroy and in 1908 he transferred to Madras Agricultural College, Coimbatore and became a Senior Entomological Assistant to C.A. Barber, the Government Botanist. He taught entomology from 1908 to 1914. He was also first assistant to the Government Entomologist, T. Bainbrigge Fletcher and his successor in 1913, Edward Ballard. In 1915-1916 he gave a talk on agricultural entomology at the Madras Exhibition of Arts and Industries of South India. In 1915 he was asked to examine an attack of thrips on rice crops. He sent specimens and they were described by C.B. Williams as Thrips oryzae. He decided that he needed to gain expertise on this group. The idea of pursuing a Ph.D. from Stanford University was obtained from K. Kunhikannan, his entomologist colleague in Mysore. He applied in 1922 but did not follow up and he applied again in 1924 but did not join again. He renewed his application and joined only in Summer, 1927. His wife had recently died and placing his children to the care of his oldest son-in-law, he took leave from 1 November 1926 and left India on 14 November. He worked under Rennie Wilbur Doane and was also assisted by Gordon Ferris. In 1927 he received a Ph.D. from Stanford University for his work on the thrips of India. On his way back from the US, he visited entomological institutions in Europe and the British Museum, where he examined Indian thrip specimens with F. Laing, He rejoined service on 1 October 1927. T.V. Ramakrishna Ayyar (seated leftmost) with other entomologists at the 1917 meeting Ayyar was a specialist on the thrips and he described numerous new genera and species. Many of his names were derived from Sanskrit rather than Latin or Greek roots. These includes such names as Thilakothrips (thilak being an adornment on the forehead), Veerabahuthrips (for a long-armed thrips species), Arrhenothrips dhumrapaksha (=cloud winged), Mesothrips bhimabahu (a reference to Bhima and strong fore femora), and Ramakrishnaiella nirmalapaksha (nirmala -> clear winged). He influenced the entomologist T.N. Ananthakrishnan who also worked on thrips. Aiyar retired from the Madras Agricultural College on 20 July 1935. In 1941, on the invitation from the Nizam, he helped the State of Hyderabad establish an entomology research station at Himayatnagar. Ayyar was a founder of the Entomological Society of India and a Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society and the Zoological Society, London. Phyllochoreia ramakrishnai was named after him. He was editor of the Madras Agricultural Journal for a few years. In 1934, he was conferred the title of Rao Sahib. In 1940 he published the Handbook of Economic Entomology for South India running to 528 pages and expanded on the earlier 1914 work of T.B. Fletcher.  Personal life  Ayyar married Lakshmi from Palghat and they had three daughters and five sons, one of them was T.R. Vaidyanathan who worked as a physicians in Iran during World War I. Another son T.R. Subramaniam became an entomologist and served as a registrar at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. He died from a stroke in the morning of 13 February 1952 at his home in Tarakad.

Her brother was the Menshevik leader Julius Martov, her husband was fellow Menshevik Fyodor Dan. Biography =Early life= Dan was born in Odessa in 1878. She entered the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in the mid-1890s, and was a member of the first social-democratic circles in St. Petersburg. =Political life= Lydia Dan was attracted to Marxism by its appeal as a 'path of reason', as she called it, which could guide mankind to civilisation, enlightenment and modernity. She also felt drawn to it by its 'sociological and economic optimism, its strong belief, buttressed by facts and figures, that the development of the economy, the development of capitalism, by demoralising and eroding the foundations of the old society, was creating new social forces (including us) which would certainly sweep away the autocratic regime together with its abominations', but also noting that youths like her were drawn to it because of its 'European nature', breaking with the provincialism of Russian society, holding 'out a promise that we would not stay a semi-Asiatic country, but would become a part of the West with its culture, institutions, and attributes of free political system. The West was our guiding light.'Figes, p. 140‚Äì141 During the famine of 1891, Lydia Dan called the co-operation between the Neo-Populists and the Marxists 'a new era', believing it to be a landmark of the revolution as it showed her generation 'that the Russian system was completely bankrupt. It felt as though Russia was on the brink of something'.Figes, p. 161‚Äì2 Dan was critical of Lenin and other Marxists', dubbed 'Politicals', who wanted to organise a centralised party and use for political ends. She would later write that 'many of us associated such a party with what the People's Will had been'.Figes, p. 149 On the writing of Lenin's What Is To Be Done?, Lydia recalled: 'None of us could imagine that there could be a party that might arrest its own members. There was the thought or the certainty that if a party was truly centralised, each member would submit naturally to the instructions or directives.'Figes, p. 151 During the Second Party Congress of the Social Democratic Party, which saw the split of the party into the Menshevik and Bolshevik factions, she came to side with her brother Martov, not because of his abilities or because she believed he was right on the issue, but because she felt Martov was noble, having 'an inexhaustible charm', although 'poorly suited to be a leader'. Writing further, she admitted that 'it was very tragic to have to say that all my sympathies for Lenin (which were considerable) were based upon misunderstanding'.Figes, p. 153 Early in the conference, she had also noted that the relation between Martov and Lenin had become colder than it was in Munich.Liebich, p. 36 Despite her disagreements with Lenin, she still believed that the 'Economists' were a greater enemy than the Bolsheviks.Liebich, p. 42 After losing her first job, she got a job in a company owned by the Bundist American millionaire S.

Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1922. It is now part of the Qantas Founders Outback Museum. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The town of Longreach was gazetted in 1887 as the new terminus of the Central Western railway line extending west from Rockhampton. Prior to this, the site of Longreach was a teamsters stop; however the completion of the railway in 1892 provided the impetus for the rapid development of the town. Interest in air transport was accelerated after the First World War. In 1919, the Australian Government offered to the first Australian who completed the flight from England to Australia in twenty-eight days. Two returned pilots, Wilmot Hudson Fysh and Paul Joseph McGinness, with their former flight sergeant Arthur Baird as engineer, were prepared to attempt the flight but had to abandon their plans when their financial benefactor died shortly after the start of their attempt. Fysh and McGinness were experienced pilots, having been awarded with the Distinguished Flying Cross whilst serving in the Australian Flying Corps. They had also served in the Australian Light Horse and landed at Gallipoli in 1915. Unable to take part in the race, the two pilots were subsequently employed by the Department of Defence to survey the route for the race contestants. This took them through western Queensland and the Northern Territory and it was during this exploration that they realised the potential for an air service linking outback towns not linked by rail. In mid 1920, Fysh and McGinness decided to establish an air taxi and joy ride (for pleasure) service from Cloncurry. They met with grazier Fergus McMaster and two other backers from the Longreach area, who agreed to become financially involved in the project. The Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Limited (Qantas) was registered in November 1920 and the first official meeting was held at the Winton Club. Arthur Baird rejoined Fysh and McGinness as engineer and became the backbone of Qantas in the early years. In the same year, the company moved to Longreach, as it was a more central position from which to operate. Business was slow at first, as most of the interest was in joy rides which, in the early days of aviation, were expensive and sometimes dangerous. However, support from McMaster and the newly formed Country Party, as well as pressure from shire and municipal councils compelled the Australian Government to announce a tender for a mail run from Charleville to Cloncurry. Qantas won this tender in February 1922. The first office in Longreach was located in Eagle Street. After this building was destroyed by fire, the office was moved to a temporary building in Duck Street before relocating to the Graziers Building across the street in May 1922. The first hangar was constructed near the site of the showgrounds in 1921. However, the contract for the mail service necessitated larger premises and a contract for a new hangar was won by Stewarts and Lloyds in March 1922. The hangar was completed in August 1922 and the inaugural mail service flight was made in November of the same year. The new hangar was erected on the site of the new aerodrome which was one and a half miles east of the town. Constructed of a tubular steel frame with galvanised iron cladding, it measured and cost . It initially had a dirt floor, but by 1924 when town water was connected, most of the floor had been concreted. The existing hangar near the showgrounds was dismantled and re-erected of the new site as offices and a store. The mail service was extended to Camooweal and Normanton in the mid 1920s and the flying service grew to include transportation of food and people in times of flood and acted as an aerial ambulance in emergencies. Construction of a Qantas aeroplane at Longreach, circa 1928 In 1926, the development of aerial communications throughout the Commonwealth was encouraged during an Imperial Conference in London, resulting in Prime Minister Stanley Bruce increasing the budget for civil aviation. In the same year, production of DH50 aeroplanes under licence from de Havilland commenced in the Longreach hangar. Although this practice ceased in 1929 when the DH50s were superseded by the more complex DH61s, the construction of aeroplanes became a secondary industry in the grazing district, creating jobs for many local people. This new use necessitated extensions to the hangar which included the additions of workshops at the sides and sliding doors to the front. In June 1930, Qantas ended its occupation of the Longreach hangar when the headquarters were moved to Brisbane. This move was generated by the realisation that a takeover was imminent if they remained a small outback company. In 1934, Qantas merged with Imperial Airways. During the Second World War, the hangar was used by the Royal Australian Air Force and subsequently by the United States Air Force. After the war, the hangar became a terminal for the domestic services of various airlines, including local Longreach airline, Somerset Airways. The most extensive alterations were carried out in the 1960s when a passenger terminal comprising a waiting room, a trolley way for baggage and offices was constructed at the north east corner of the building. At the same time, the roof sheeting, purlins and primary roof trusses were replaced and additional purlins were installed. The plans for these alteration were drawn by the Commonwealth Department in 1960; however the work was not completed until 1963. The signage to the gable ends has been repainted a number of times. The Allom Lovell Marquis-Kyle Conservation Plan states that the positions of the gables were reversed during the 1963 alterations and that the signs were repainted in 1963, 1969 and 1972. The 1969 repainting included the painting over of the sign on the southern end which originally read Qantas Empire Airlines, the name resulting from the 1934 merge with Imperial Airways to enable international flights to England. The hangar remained in use until 1996 when it was altered for re-use as the Qantas Founders Outback Museum illustrating the history of Qantas.  Description  The Qantas hangar is located at the Longreach Airport, on the western side of the complex and is a large, freestanding structure which forms a dominant landmark in the area. The hangar comprises a large open space, or hangarage, with annexes on either side and at the rear. The hangarage has a light frame of tubular steel which comprises a series of trusses supporting a gable roof with a ventilated ridge. The roof trusses are only supported by columns where the roof has been extended over the side annexes. The gable at each end of the hangar is also sheeted with corrugated iron and painted with the words QANTAS LTD on the northern (front) end and QANTAS LTD AIR SERVICES on the southern (rear) end. At each side of the front elevation are new steel frames which support the recently constructed sliding doors when opened. Internally, the hangarage has a concrete floor, whilst the floors to the annexes are of timber boards. The walls and roof of the hangarage and annexes are clad in galvanised corrugated iron and openings are cut in the walls in some areas to allow light to enter the interior. Windows in the form of corrugated iron flaps, hinged at the top are located down each side and at the rear of the annexes. The western annexe has been altered to accommodate offices and amenities associated with the operation of the place as a museum.  Heritage listing  The former Qantas Hangar was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.

It is related to the Avelia Horizon and New Pendolino family of high- speed trains, but adapted for North American railroad standards, including U.S. Federal Railroad Administration crashworthiness standards. Amtrak has ordered 28 trainsets for use on its flagship Acela Express service along the Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington, D.C. via New York City and Philadelphia. Amtrak says that compared to the prior generation, these trainsets would allow for improved frequency and greater capacity on the Acela Express service. two of the trainsets were undergoing testing and construction of the other trainsets was ongoing. The first trainset is expected to enter revenue service in 2021, with all trainsets in service by 2022. History Avelia Liberty will be used on the electrified Acela Express route between Boston and Washington, shown in dark red. In August 2016, Amtrak announced a $2.4 billion loan from the United States Department of Transportation for the purchase of new high-speed trainsets for the Acela Express service from Alstom. Alstom will also provide long-term technical support and supply spare components and parts. These next generation trainsets would replace the 20 existing Bombardier-Alstom trainsets that were nearing the end of their useful service life. Amtrak said that the Avelia Liberty trainsets would allow for improved frequency and greater capacity on the Acela Express service. The 28 trainsets ordered (compared to the 20 older trainsets) would allow for more frequent service on the route, including half-hourly peak service between New York City and Washington, D.C. Each new trainsets will also have 386 seats (25% more than the current Acela Express trainsets) allowing for greater passenger capacity. U.S. assembly of the trainsets is taking place at Alstom's plants in Hornell and Rochester, New York. Initial construction of car bodies and major components began at Hornell in October 2017. The first trainset was sent to the Transportation Technology Center, Inc. (TTCI) in Pueblo, Colorado in February 2020 for testing on the high-speed test track. During the nine months of expected trials, the trainsets were tested at speeds up to . A second trainset was delivered in March 2020 to Amtrak for testing along the service tracks in the Northeast which began in May 2020. The first trainset is expected to enter revenue service in 2021, with all trainsets in service by 2022, at which point Amtrak will retire the previous Acela fleet.  Features and production  Each Avelia Liberty trainset has power cars at each end of the train, and (initially) nine articulated passenger cars. An additional three passenger cars can be added if demand grows. The power cars include a Crash Energy Management system to help meet Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) standards while allowing a 30% reduction in train weight. These trains will also have USB ports, power sockets, Wi-Fi, accessibility features, and other conveniences.A Look Inside Alstom's Avelia Liberty. Railway Age. August 8, 2018. The trainsets will be equipped with an active tilt system, dubbed Tiltronix by Alstom, that will allow higher speeds on curved portions of the corridor track. The new trainsets, along with track and signaling improvements, will allow for an initial improvement in maximum regular service speed to on some portions of the route, with a maximum possible speed of if future investments in track and signaling upgrades are made. The trains themselves are designed for a speed of if the tilting mechanism is deactivated.

He became a member of that order in his late childhood after cultivating a strong devotion to Francis of Assisi during his childhood with his parents who were also Franciscans. His beatification received formal confirmation from Pope Innocent XI on 28 June 1687 after the pontiff ratified the friar's enduring and local 'cultus' - otherwise known as popular veneration. His uncle was the Franciscan friar Giovanni da Stroncone. Life Antonio da Stroncone was born in 1391 in the Umbria province to ancient nobles of the Vici. His parents ‚Äì Lodovico and Isabella ‚Äì were both professed members of the Third Order of Saint Francis. During his childhood his parents instilled in him a great sense of faith and ardent devotion to Francis of Assisi and after he turned twelve he begged the superior of his town's Franciscan convent to admit him into his ranks. The superior believed it better to defer this request to a later time due to Antonio's age and his health, though the latter repeated his pleas three times and was accepted once the superior relented to his tears and allowed him to join the Order of Friars Minor. His superiors acknowledged his great talents and so wanted him to become a priest but he instead begged and succeeded in deferring from that to instead become a professed religious. The end of his probation period saw him moved to Fiesole where his uncle oversaw his spiritual instruction and that in turn was later entrusted to Tommaso Bellacci. In 1428 he was sent to Corsica to aid friars in establishing other convents and he remained there until 1430 when he retired to a quiet convent in Assisi. From 1411 to 1420 he was the assistant novice master in Fiesole and with Bellacci from 1420 to 1425 sought to convert and repress the Fraticelli heretical movement. On one occasion he had a vision of Jesus Christ in which the Lord declared how pleased he was with Antonio when He lit numerous candles; the friar then adopted the practice of lighting as many candles as possible near the altar with an emphasis on doing so on the various feasts of the Lord and the Blessed Virgin Mary. His deep devotion to the Eucharist caused him to beg on his knees for the forgiveness of the other friars for his sins on those days that he was to receive Communion. Antonio also made small wooden crosses in his spare time and placed them in various spots in the convent grounds. He ventured out barefoot as both a penitential act and one of poverty. He died at the beginning of 1461 and was interred under the floor of the San Damiano convent in Assisi where he spent the latter part of his life. Even before he died he pleaded to be allowed to rise from his bed in order to attend Mass. In 1462 a flame burst forth from the site of his grave to which James of the Marches exclaimed that \\"this is a sign of God!\\" He had the floor lifted and the incorrupt remains were found with an odor of perfume before being relocated; the remains were moved once again in 1599 and later to Stroncone on 21 August 1809. In 1649 a woman suffering from demonic possession was brought before the late friar's remains and the remains ‚Äì it was said ‚Äì sat up and one hand raised above the other. Beatification His beatification received official confirmation from Pope Innocent XI on 28 June 1687 after the latter approved a decree that ratified the late friar's local 'cultus' - or enduring popular veneration.

(10 November 1860 ‚Äì 23 February 1933) was a British botanist and specialist on sugarcane, who worked for much of his life in southern India. Saccharum barberi, a species of sugarcane that grows wild in northern India is named after him. He was a pioneer in the nobilization of wild canes in India, by producing hybrids between wild and hardy local species and the high-sugar-yielding cultivated Saccharum officinarum that could survive the cold winters of northern India.  Education  Born on 10 November 1860 at Wynberg, Cape Town, he went to study at New Kingswood, Bath and later at Bonn University. He joined Cambridge University and passed the natural sciences Tripos with first class in 1887 (part I) and 188 (part II). He received an MA in 1892 and a Sc.D. in 1908. He joined in the Leeward Islands as a Superintendent of the Botanical Station in 1892 and worked for four years before joining as a lecturer in botany at the Royal Engineering College at Cooper's Hill. In 1898 he joined the Madras Presidency as Government Botanist. He studied root-parasitism in plants from 1906-1908. He became an expert on sugarcane to the Government in 1912. He became a lecturer on Tropical Agriculture at Cambridge University in 1919. He was made C.I.E. in 1918.  Professional activity  Charles Alfred Barber worked on many aspects of sugarcane breeding and in basic botany. He established a sugarcane research station that is now known as the Sugarcane breeding institute at Coimbatore and along with T.S.

In September, he was nominated as the Libertarian Party of New Hampshire's candidate for Governor of New Hampshire in the 2016 gubernatorial election, garnering 4.3% of the popular vote.

Records show that a Baptist congregation has been in existence in the town since 1623, but the exact date of the present building is unknown. Old Baptist Chapel, Tewkesbury The building was originally a timber-framed house, believed to date from the 15th century, standing in a back alley now known as \\"Old Baptist Chapel Court\\", opposite Tewkesbury Abbey, and may have begun to be used as a meeting place by the local Baptists as early as 1620. The house was adapted, probably in around 1720, for use by the local Baptist congregation in their worship, and a baptistery was installed. The fa√ßade and windows date from this conversion. Later in the 18th century, a new Baptist chapel was built in nearby Cheltenham, and in 1805 a new chapel opened in Tewkesbury, with the old chapel being converted back to residential use. In the 1970s, it was restored by the local authority, Tewkesbury Borough Council, and now appears much as it would have done in 1720. The 1805 building was replaced during the 1980s. The old chapel is now managed by the John Moore Museum on behalf of Tewkesbury's Abbey Lawn Trust. In 2015, it was awarded a grant of ¬£189,500 from the Heritage Lottery Fund towards a three-year programme of refurbishment, resulting in the installation of kitchen and toilet facilities.

The clan heads, Roberto and Victorina Laperal made the house as their vacation home. During World War II, the house was occupied by Japanese soldiers and was used as a garrison. The troops reportedly raped women, tortured and killed suspected spies working for the United States and their allies. The house transferred ownership after the death of the head of the Laperal clan. It was adequately maintained but despite being closed to the public over the years, it did not stop the persistent rumors of the unearthly sightings spotted near the house. The house withstood many natural and man-made casualties, such as the deadly earthquake in 1990 and many more. Chinese Filipino billionaire tycoon Lucio Tan purchased the property in 2007 but never stayed in the place during some of his trips to Baguio. He instead had it renovated and refurbished with proper maintenance then made it into a tourist attraction. From then on, the house was opened to public. In 2013, the tycoon's Tan Yan Kee Foundation transformed the house to a Bamboo Foundation museum where Filipino artworks based on bamboo and wood.

It is New Zealand‚Äôs largest chamber ensemble, able to draw on over 20 players, many of whom are principal players with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra (NZSO). It focuses on music written in the last 100 years, and has been active since 2000. It has commissioned and/or premiered over 50 New Zealand works, and has given repeat performances to another 40. Stroma has also collaborated with musicians and artists from other genres, such as jazz musicians (e.g. Jeff Henderson), taonga p≈´oro players (e.g. Richard Nunns) and choreographers (e.g. Daniel Belton). Because the members are largely affiliated with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, usually fewer than 10 concerts a year are given by Stroma. NZSO principals have included Vesa-Matti Lepp√§nen (violin), Bridget Douglas (flute), and Ed Allen (horn). History Stroma was established in 2000 by Hamish McKeich, Michael Norris, Bridget Douglas and Philip Brownlee. Its first concert, Wind, Rain & Light featured the music of Toru Takemitsu, James Gardner, Philip Brownlee, Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, Kaija Saariaho, Paul Booth, Michael Norris and Jenny McLeod. Since then, it has staged over 50 concerts throughout New Zealand, and has appeared at the New Zealand Festival in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010, the International Jazz Festival 2003, the Wellington Cathedral Festival 2003, the Christchurch Festival of the Arts 2005 and the Tempo and Body Festivals in 2012. They also toured for Chamber Music New Zealand in 2004, and The New Zealand Herald music critic William Dart commented that for their eclectic mixing of pieces by composers from New Zealand (Ross Harris), the United States (George Crumb), and France (Olivier Messiaen; they played his Quatuor pour la fin du temps), they gained \\"cheers all round\\". While Stroma's programmes are primarily focused on New Zealand composers and performers, it has also worked with international musicians as Roberto Fabbriciani, Nicholas Isherwood, Richard Nunns, Madeleine Pierard (performing Pierrot Lunaire in 2012), Lars Mlekusch, the Duo Stump-Linshalm, Simon Docking, Adam Page, Richard Haynes, Warren Maxwell and Pedro Carneiro. In 2015, Stroma gave a tribute concert Nine Echoes to New Zealand composer Douglas Lilburn on his 100th birthday at the Sacred Heart Cathedral in Wellington. In 2016, ten of their players accompanied the opera Brass Poppies, produced by Ross Harris and Vincent O'Sullivan and set in Wellington at a time when soldiers were leaving for Gallipoli. Stroma contributed one piece to the double album set Passing By of compositions by New Zealand composer Jack Body. The album was released on 30 April 2015, only days before Body's death.

In 1967, Dundee's medical school became independent in its own right having started in 1889 as a joint venture between the University of St Andrews and University College Dundee. In 1974 the medical school moved to a large teaching facility based at Ninewells Hospital in the west of Dundee. The School of Medicine now encompasses undergraduate, postgraduate, specialist teaching centres and four research divisions. History =The Conjoint Medical School (1887-1967)= In 1881, when University College Dundee was founded, the city of Dundee contained the Royal Infirmary and the Royal Lunatic Asylum which would provide medical teaching space for the new institution. The College however, had no power to award degrees and thus in 1887 proposed a merger with the nearby University of St Andrews. The Universities (Scotland) Act 1889 paved the way for an affiliation between St Andrews and University College Dundee. During the 1894-95 session, there were nine Professors engaged in teaching fifty matriculated students. Formal Union between St Andrews University and College of Dundee was achieved in 1897. Buildings for the Dundee Medical School were officially opened in 1904, with the intention of accommodating 100‚Äì150 students. The buildings were designed by Dundee-based architect John Murray Robertson before his death in 1901 and were completed by James Findlay and David Smith from 1903-04. On their first visit to the new medical school examiners from the General Medical Council judged it to be \\"sufficient\\". By 1949, the Dundee Royal Infirmary and the Maryfield Hospital were both being used for teaching medical students, but it was already apparent that to expand capacity it would be more economical to build a new facility away from the centre of the city. By 1961, plans were being exhibited for a new building that would allow the medical school to increase to a capacity of 500 students. Old Medical School, Dundee =The Independent Medical School (1967-present)= In 1967, a University Charter was awarded to Queens College, formerly University College, and it became the University of Dundee Medical School, now separate from St Andrews. Opened in 1974 by the Queen Mother, the Ninewells Hospital & Medical School took over from the Dundee Royal Infirmary as the principal site of medical teaching for the University and eventually led to the closure of the Royal Infirmary in 1998. In August 2015 the University had a reorganisation into a new academic school structure with nine schools. The medical school had previously been part of the \\"College of Medicine, Dentistry & Nursing\\". As well as undergraduate and postgraduate medical courses, the School of Medicine also incorporates skills centres and research units. , there are 1,009 undergraduates and 2,645 postgraduate students enrolled at the School of Medicine. Recent developments Ninewells Hospital & Medical School Together with Ninewells Hospital, Perth Royal Infirmary to the west and Stracathro Hospital to the north provide clinical experience and teaching facilities for the University's medical students. A modern clinical simulation area was opened in November 2011. In 2011, plans for a glass-fronted extension to the medical school buildings at Ninewells were announced. By 2012, work on the first phase was underway on the site at Ninewells, with the development expected to cost around ¬£11million. An ¬£8million upgrade of the Gannochy Trust Lecture Theatre won a commendation from the Dundee Civic Trust. In April 2015, a reduction of fifteen academic staff posts was announced. Research The School of Medicine contains five research divisions with themes influenced by the University's partnership with NHS Tayside: * Division of Cancer Research * Division of Molecular & Clinical Medicine * Division of Neuroscience * Division of Population Health and Genomics * Division of Imaging Science and Technology The Academic Health Science Partnership in Tayside was established jointly by the University of Dundee, the Scottish Government and NHS Tayside with the goal of strengthening the links between academia and the health service. Research at the School of Medicine is the means by which the AHSP's aim to improve clinical care and the education of health professionals is intended to be achieved. Reputation As of 2019, Dundee is ranked between 101-125th in the world for medicine by Times Higher Education, while Quacquarelli Symonds ranks it 151-200th. On average, over the four years Dundee has been ranked by the Times, it places 92nd, the QS average over seven years puts Dundee at 119th. According to the major 2020 national rankings, medicine at Dundee has the highest academic entry requirements in the UK, at 239 UCAS points. In 2015, the medical school's Technology and Innovation in Learning team won the Innovation Technology Excellence Award at The Herald higher education awards.

The theory proposes that the 2011‚Äì2017 drought was a deliberate, man- made phenomenon, created by weather modification. The theory has been dismissed by the scientific community and mainstream media as fringe science or pseudoscience. Key claims and components The 2011‚Äì2017 drought inspired alarm among many, leading to the emergence of alternative theories, or \\"conspiracy theories\\", purporting to explain its cause. Many of the proponents claim that chemtrails are used to affect storm clouds, in a manner of suppressing the development of precipitation. This would occur because of the presence of too many cloud condensation nuclei, or \\"cloud seeds\\", in a single area. Others say that technologies similar to HAARP (a federal ionospheric research program, which was decommissioned in 2015), are being used to create a large and stubborn high-pressure area over the West Coast of the United States. They claim that this, also, discourages storms and rainfall. Prominent was Dane Wigington of www.GeoEngineeringwatch.org. He said that government agencies and other entities have economic and geopolitical motivations to manipulate the weather on the West Coast and elsewhere. Proponents have claimed credibility for the theory, in part, as a result of a Los Angeles County cloud seeding program, begun in early 2016. This reinforces their view that government continues to engage in weather modification and/or climate engineering. Shasta County action In July 2014, the Shasta County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously in favor of a formal inquiry into chemtrail conspiracy claims. One of the reasons given was their potential to affect weather and rainfall. The action was cheered by supporters, but mocked by many in the media.

Nineteenth-century examples During the 1790s, there was considerable sympathy outside France with the ideals of the French Revolution; but a decade later, after Napoleon had come to sole power, active sympathisers were much reduced in numbers:Boyd Hilton, A Mad, Bad and Dangerous People?

Tangye Lean, The Napoleonists (1970) p. 377 The common factor in that syndrome is taken to be an ambivalent relationship to the parent or parent of origins, leading to a rejection of national authority, and its projection abroad.Boyd Hilton, A Mad, Bad and Dangerous People? (Oxford 2008) p. 210 The argument is particularly convincing in the case of a group of Radicals including Leigh Hunt and William Godwin, as well as Hazlitt - all the sons of dissenting ministers, whose religious beliefs they had rejected but whose influence on them remained substantial nevertheless.A.

Eduardo Toda y G√ºell (9 January 1852, in Reus ‚Äì 26 April 1941, in Reus) was a Spanish diplomat, historian, Egyptologist and numismatist.  Career  After studying law at the Central University of Madrid, Eduardo was appointed Vice-Consul in Macao, Hong Kong, Canton, and Shanghai. He was subsequently Consul General in Cairo, Egypt (1884-1886) and became friends with Gaston Maspero. During his post, he became very interested in ancient Egypt and while at Deir el-Medina, he discovered and opened the intact tomb of Sennedjem. After being posted to Helsinki and Le Havre, he decided to abandon his diplomatic career and move to London. He didn't return to Spain until 1918 where he created the collection Estudios Egiptol√≥gicos and later tried to establish a school of Egyptology. After being unsuccessful in his attempts, he moved to the Ch√¢teau-monastere d'Escornalbou where he devoted himself to the history of the Poblet Abbey. He became Professor at the School of Librarians of the Provincial Diputaci√≥n of Barcelona, Corresponding Member of the Catalan Studies Institute and Member of the Real Academia de Buenas Letras de Barcelona.

Lord Pavadairayan. One of the Male Tamil Deity. Son of Goddess Angalaparameswari. Lord Pavadairayan - At Panrutti Angalamman Mayanakollai Festival. Lord Pavadairayan is a popular regional Tamil male deity in rural Tamil Nadu, India. He is one of the Kaaval Dheivams of Tamil Nadu, India, and is of particular notability because he is the son of Angala Parameswari. In most temples he is depicted on the right knee of Angala Parameswari and is also said to be her guard.  Myths  = Mythological origin = In Hindu mythology, when Shakthi was reborn as Parvati, she mistook Brahma for Shiva and fell at his feet. When Parvati realized that Brahma was not Shiva, she became angry and prayed to Shiva that Brahma's fifth head would be destroyed. In response, Shiva cut off one of Brahma's heads as Rudra, which became a Brahmahathi Dosha. The four-headed Brahma cursed Shiva and fixed the fifth head to Shiva's hand, cursing Shiva to be perpetually hungry and unable to sleep. Shiva descended to earth and wandered with no definite destination. He begged and ate, but half of all the food he received was eaten by the fifth head of Brahma or \\"Kabala\\". While Shiva was roaming the earth, a leader of Kalvikkadu‚ÄîPethandavan‚Äîwas robbing neighboring areas to provide for his people. He was powerful and rich but was troubled by his inability to have children. He and his wife Pethandachi prayed to Shiva for a child. After they prayed, Shiva appeared at Pethandavan and Pethandachi's house as a beggar. They fed him, and in return, Lord Shiva offered Pathandachi a prasadam and said, \\"A male child will be born to you and he will bring fame to your family and he will become famous around the world\\" before leaving. = Birth = Pethandavan and Pethandachi had a son. They named him \\"Kalvikaathaan\\" (the protector of Kalvikkadu) and treated the child as a gift of god. He was instructed in all the arts when he became five years old and became skilled at everything he learned. As time passed, Pethandavan grew old and he ordered his son to take his position and protect his region, but Kalvikaathaan was not interested in taking his father's job as they robbed, killed, and harassed residents to serve his people. He spoke to his father about his disinterest but Pethandavan did not listen. Kalvikaathaan left as a result. On his travels he saw the shape of a flame and grew afraid. He asked, \\"who is this?\\" The flame replied, \\"My son, I am the goddess Angala Parameswari. I was waiting for you these many years. Don't be afraid. I will be there for you, my son.\\" = Angala Parameswari's order = \\"Only you can do a favour for me. A temple needs to be constructed for me by tomorrow morning (Amavasai). But for this, you need to do certain things.\\" After following Angala Parameswari's instructions, Kalvikaththaan completed all of his tasks and submitted at the foot of Goddess Angala Parameswari. She asked him for one more thing: to put his kudal and eeru (tonsils and intestines) on a Paavadai. With no hesitation he took a sword and cut his tonsils and intestines and dedicated them to the goddess on the paavadai. = Pavadairayan as family deity = Angala Parameswari was pleased and took him up and kissed him so that he became Aangaara Sakthi (the power of a god status). The temple was consecrated successfully with all the proper rituals. The temple was Melmalayanoor Angala Parameswari Amman Temple. She gave authority to him that he would be her Mun Kaavalan (the protector from the front). Wherever I have a temple you will be having a sannidhi outside my temple. People offer you goat, hen, pig, etc. By this true dedication of you,\\" let you be the Kula Dheivam (family deity) for the laity people.\\" Since this time, Pavadairayan serves as a family deity or Kula Dheivam for most of the people. In Melmalayanoor Angala Parameswari Amman Temple, Tandavarayan sits next to Goddess Angala Parameswari Amman inside the temple. Outside the temple, Pavadairayan has a separate sannadhi that faces Angala Parameswari Amman along with his two wives Aranatchi Amman and Muthunatchi Amman to bless their devotees. = Parudhesiyappar Pavadairayar = Another story about Pavadairayan revolves around his meeting with Shiva. Due to Brahma's curse, Shiva suffered as a beggar in need of food. At that time, Pavadairayan ruled over the village of Vallam Padugai. Shiva, as a beggar, entered Vallam Padugai in need of food. Pavadairayan did not recognize Shiva and arrested him on suspicion of being a spy. When Sabam was complete devas came to search for Shiva and found he was in jail. After being told of the beggar's true identity, Pavadairayan prostrated himself at Shiva's feet and apologised. Shiva accepted him and blessed Pavadairayan to become the guard of Shiva with his two wives. As Shiva came as a beggar (Paradhesi Kola), the temple was named Parudhesiyappar Pavadairayar Temple. = Vallala Kandan = Lord Brahma lusted for Thilothama and sired 5 children that were born on earth‚ÄîVallala Kandan and 4 sons‚Äîwho bothered the devas all day. To solve this, sage Naradar came and confused Vallala Kandan to meditate on Shiva to be the most powerful being in the world. Kandan took Nardar's advice and started to meditate on Shiva, who appeared before him and asked for the boons. He asked Shiva itself to be born as his son on his wife's womb. Shiva granted his wish and Kandan's wife conceived immediately. Shakthi, Shiva's wife, was shocked with Kandan's boons as she would lose her husband, so she ran to her brother Vishnu for help. Vishnu advised her that \\"you have only one chance during the time of birth of the child\\". Shakthi waited and at the end of the tenth month of conception, Kandan's wife shouted out in pain. During this time, Vishnu disappeared all the humans in the earth except Vallala Kandan and his four brothers to impede Kandan's search for a women to take care of his wife and to deliver the baby safely. Angala Parameswari disguised herself as an old lady and Pavadairayan as a small boy appeared before appearing in front of Vallala Kandan. Kandan approached her to deliver the baby safely. She accepted. Vallala Kandan promised the old lady to give her whatever she wished. The old lady asked for a knife and something else. Vallala Kandan had a doubt on giving knife but gave as to deliver the baby. She took Kandan's wife to a separate place and asked Pavadairayan to stand outside as a protector for her. Angala Parameswari took the opportunity and teared the stomach, womb of Vallala Kandan's wife and killed the baby. Vallala Kandan heard the screaming of his wife and came to witness her. At that time, Angala Parameswari ordered Pavadairayan and Veerabathrar to kill Kandan and his four brothers. Pavadairayan along with Veerabathrar killed them. = Rayanpuram and Royapuram = Branching off of Parudhesiyappar Pavadairayar, Pavadairayan arresting Shiva was sacrilegious. In order to forgive the sacrilege, Shiva advised Pavadairayan, \\"In the north, there is a place called Aadhipuri, nearby there is a place called Palmgrove. In Palmgrove, Goddess Kali Devi, sits in the shadow of a palm tree and rules that place as an apparition. You must go to her and live as a protector for her, only then will you be cleansed.\\" Pavadairayan went to the Palmgrove where Kali was ruling. During worship, Pavadairayan heard Kali's laughter. He worshiped her in the direction of her laughter, which Kali accepted. After that, Pavadairayan brought all of his people and army to Palmgrove and lived as a protector for her. The place where Pavadairayan and his people lived was called Rayampuram before being renamed Royapuram. The place where Pavadairayan served as a protector for Kali is Royapuram, Kalmandapam Angalaparameswari Amman Temple.  Speciality  Kaval Dheivam deities are usually placed outside the sannadhi of the main god. Pavadairayan is the only Kaaval Dheivam or Parivara Moorthy who has been portrayed sitting in the lap of Angala Parameswari.  Statue at Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History  Lord Aiyanar on Horse. Lord Pavadairayan sits on the left of Lord Aiyanar The statue depicts Aiyanar mounted on a steed with three horns growing out of its head. He holds a rein in his left hand and a whip in his right.

It is currently housed at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University. The statue is placed in the museum under the section of arts and culture of Asia, India.Lord Aiyanar on Horse. Lord Pavadairayan sits on the left of Lord Aiyanar.  Worship  Lord Pavadairayan is worshipped mostly with \\"stones\\" and \\"trees\\".

Promotion in the Bailiwick of Guernsey being undertaken by La Soci√©t√© Guernesiaise, Guernsey Museums, the Alderney Society with World War II work also undertaken by Festung Guernsey. Archaeologists in each island give regular talks on their work and summer digs in the islands usually require helpers and volunteers. Interest in the archaeology of the islands is first recorded in the 16th century. By the 18th century articles were being published in magazines with engravings explaining interesting historic sites. La Hougue Bie entrance and chapel, Jersey Bailiwick of Jersey The Soci√©t√© Jersiaise was founded in 1873. Over the years the Soci√©t√© Jersiaise has purchased archaeological sites for preservation and presentation, the two most important sites are La Hougue Bie, purchased in 1919, and La Cotte de Saint- Br√©lade, purchased in 1955. The Museum, founded in 1893 by the Soci√©t√© Jersiaise and its extensive Museum collections are now looked after by Jersey Heritage. Jersey Heritage, founded in 1981, is a local charity that protects and promotes the Island‚Äôs rich heritage and cultural environment. Planning permissions may include a requirement for archaeological monitoring and/or works. In 2014, 24 planning permissions included this requirement. Jersey Heritage reach out to engage the public, for example in 2014, the Soci√©t√© Jersiaise held a programme of archaeological events as part of the nationwide Council for British Archaeology Festival. Bailiwick of Guernsey Guernsey Museums holds a wide range of archaeological collections. The Museums also holds important collections of antiquarian finds, dominated by 250 prehistoric stone tools, mostly gathered together by the Lukis family mainly in the 1830s and 1840s. Guernsey employs a States Archaeologist who undertakes excavations or who approves visiting archaeologists. Long term projects have included: * Herm. Island of the dead? The buried Neolithic landscape of Herm being undertaken by Durham University * Stepping stones to the Neolithic? Islands, maritime connectivity and the 'western seaways' of Britain, 5,000-3,500 BC by the Universities of Reading, Southampton and Liverpool. * Alderney Nunnery, undertaken by Guernsey Museums Maritime archaeology is similarly regulated and protected by laws, with displays at the Shipwreck Museum at Fort Grey and the Maritime Museum at Castle Cornet The ‚ÄúGuernsey Sites and Monument Record‚Äù is compiled and maintained by the Archaeology Officer. It is a register of known archaeological sites and find spots within the Bailiwick of Guernsey, including Ancient Monuments. Sections of early archaeological evidence on Alderney has sadly been destroyed, firstly during the Victorian era of quarrying and building fortifications and later by the German occupiers repeating the process. However the Alderney Society is thriving and has an excellent museum. Sea level changes in the Channel Islands Understanding the changes to the sea level is vital when considering the early archaeology of the islands. The islands were never covered in ice, but suffered early erosion from rivers such as the Seine and Ay. Over the last million years sea levels have changed significantly. 800,000 years ago sea levels were likely to have been 35m higher than now. This fell gradually, with the formation of ice elsewhere and the land rising, to 30m higher than now around 400,000 years ago to 21m 300,000 years ago, to 13m 200,000 years ago to 2m 120,000 years ago, when it was thought a catastrophic outburst flood permanently diverted the Rhine into the English Channel. Sea levels continued to fall, but more rapidly over the next 100,000 years. Looking at the last 20,000 years, which started with a glacial period, the sea level was around 100m lower than now, making the sea coast some 120 km west of the islands. There followed a dramatic rise, by 9,400 BC the sea had risen to come close to where it now lies, but with the islands still connected to mainland France. The separation of Alderney probably occurred first, the Guernsey/Sark landmass occurred around 9,200 BC with the Bailiwick of Guernsey becoming separate islands of Guernsey, Sark and Herm around 5,000 BC. Jersey being finally separated from the French coast about 1,000 years later, although there are traditions that a land bridge between Jersey and France lasted until finally broken in a storm or series of storms in 709 AD, the same storm separating Herm from Jethou. The islands contain raised beaches including one 8-9m above current heights from about 130,000 years ago and evidence of a forest (in Vazon Bay, Guernsey) below the current sea levels. There are very high tides and swift currents in the Mont Saint-Michel Bay which caused additional erosion between Jersey and the French coast. Buildings, key archaeology sites and evidence from various periods =Palaeolithic period= Cave at La Cotte de St Brelade Whilst connected to mainland Europe. * La Cotte de St Brelade, Jersey. First investigated in 1904. The Site was first occupied by humans in the Middle Paleolithic, 240,000 years ago based on thermoluminescence dating, during a cold glacial period when most of the present seabed would have been uncovered. Dated at approximately 180,000 BP, two impressive piles of animal bones, of mammoths and woolly rhinoceros, are located beneath an overhang having being butchered. * La Cotte √† la Ch√®vre is a small cave in Jersey. Flints and a hand axe have been found here, also indicating Neanderthal occupation. =Ice Age period= 14,000 BC ‚Äì 12,000 BC whilst connected to mainland Europe following extinction of Neanderthals. * Over 3,000 stone tools and Ice Age engravings dating from at least 12,000 BC have been found at Les Varines site in south east Jersey, showing occupation by Homo sapiens. =Mesolithic period= 12,000 BC to 4,500 BC when rising sea levels created the islands. * La Cotte de St Brelade was also found to have had more recent human occupants, flint and stone tools, animal bones and hearths have been found in the cave. * On Jethou evidence of flint manufacturing in an area exposed only at low water between the island and Crevichon shows occupation around 10,000 BC. * There is evidence on Little Sark of human farming dating from around 5,000 BC. * A number of sites show evidence of Mesolithic communities including Lihou and the Royal Hotel site in Guernsey and Les Landes, Jersey. =Neolithic period= 4,500 BC ‚Äì1,800 BC The archaeological community debate whether the Neolithic Revolution was brought to the British Isles through adoption by natives, or by migrating groups of continental Europeans who settled there, however evidence of a farming lifestyle exists in Guernsey from the start of the Neolithic period, a thousand years earlier than on mainland Britain. Sites excavated include: Jersey * La Hougue Bie, Jersey. Excavated in 1924. Neolithic ritual site which was in use around 3,500 BC comprising an passage chamber covered by a earth mound.

Some of the largest celebrations were held in 2019, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary, which included a military parade of the Slovak Armed Forces, an official visit of Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babi≈° and the release of a documentary film called Leaving. While it is often seen as a celebration of Anti-fascism, it is also seen as having a strong connotation with the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and its communist system. As a result, many politicians steer clear of associating themselves with the holiday. Many Catholic nationalists actively condemn the uprising and its commemoration in public speeches.

The film is produced by Cornwell, David Lancaster and Simon Cornwell and stars Chadwick Boseman, Luke Evans, Teresa Palmer, and Alfred Molina. The film's plot revolves around Jacob King (Boseman), a man from Cape Town, South Africa who travels to Los Angeles in order to find his younger sister and after finding out she is dead, he works to avenge her death. The project was announced on November 4, 2014, along with Boseman's casting. Principal photography began in February 2015 in Los Angeles, California. Other filming locations included Cape Town, South Africa, Glendale, Beverly Hills and Topanga. The film premiered at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2016. It received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics, with praise directed at Boseman's performance and criticism aimed at the script and the overall pacing. Netflix released the film on August 4, 2017.  Plot  Jacob King, who lives in Cape Town receives a message from his estranged sister Bianca, who lives in Los Angeles with her husband and stepson, that she is in trouble and has something \\"they\\" want. King flies to Los Angeles with a return ticket dated seven days later, intent on finding his sister and booking cheap lodging. Upon arriving at his sister's address, he meets a neighbor who held some of Bianca's belongings, given to her shortly before Bianca disappeared. The neighbor also informs King that his sister's husband had disappeared earlier, leaving his son with Bianca. Jacob finds Bianca's landlady, who says that a local business owner, Zico, suddenly paid Bianca's rent before she left, and that Bianca had been strung out and beat up before departing. King finds Zico with a group of men, and they deny any knowledge of Bianca. A local shopkeeper tips King to look for his sister in the morgue, and King finds her corpse there, tortured and mutilated. Among Bianca's belongings, King finds several photographs of her with various men, including the gang member who had paid her rent but denied knowing her, a dentist's business card, and a pack of cigarettes. King confronts Zico and mutilates his face, telling him to relate to his superior, Duke, that this is \\"a message from the King\\", and then steals Zico's phone. At a party held by Bianca's neighbor Trish, King learns that Bianca had been associated with the gang and a drug dealer, named Frankie. He lures Bianca's dealer Frankie to the party and beats him for information, then steals his phone. Back at the motel, King accidentally interrupts a prostitute. The prostitute, glad he has not called the police, allows King to \\"rent\\" her car. King goes to the dentist under the guise of a referral from his sister and he meets the connected Dr. Wentworth, who says that Bianca was being pimped out to pay her husband's debts and that she often disappeared. After the meeting, it is revealed that she was involved with a politician running for office, Frank Leary, who gives Wentworth the contact details for two hitmen to make the problem disappear. King follows Wentworth to the home of a wealthy Hollywood producer, Mike Preston, whom Wentworth shakes down for $100,000 to cover the cost of the hitmen, and another $750,000 of blackmail money due to his involvement with Bianca's death. At the house, King notices his sister's stepson, Armand, living at the mansion. Wentworth notices King's car when leaving Preston's house and calls the hitmen. Later that day, the hitmen, two LAPD officers, arrest King. King, realizing he is going to be killed, manages to escape, taking a beating in the process. His motel neighbor, Kelly, the prostitute who had lent King her car, finds him near the motel and nurses him back to health in her room. The gang realizes that Kelly's car was not stolen. King recovers from his beating and creates a bomb out of materials from a hardware store, then finds an encrypted SD card in Bianca's belongings, hidden in a pack of cigarettes. Realizing this is what her killers wanted, he is only able to listen to snippets of audio but understands that Preston is the target. He sneaks into Preston's home and forces him to decrypt the file, which reveals camera footage of Preston committing acts of pedophilia on Armand during a party. Preston reveals that Bianca's husband had fallen into serious debts, and the debtors forced Bianca to take drugs and pimped her out to pay them back. They killed her husband but continued to pimp her out, so she sold her stepson to Preston for money. When she realized that he was raping Armand, she stole the footage and called King for help. Preston asked Wentworth to fix the issue, and Wentworth hired the gang members to kill Bianca. King lures Duke, his gang members, and Wentworth to Preston's mansion, kills Preston, and then plants a bomb in a packet of money. Duke and Wentworth open the packet, and both are killed. King takes Armand back to Kelly's motel, intent on rescuing the boy, but the sole surviving member of the gang‚Äîthe one King maimed a few days earlier‚Äîambushes him in the room. The boy escapes before King is able to win. King gives chase to Armand but ultimately gives up. King drops Kelly and her daughter at the bus stop where she will return to her home town in New Mexico. He hands her a bag which has money he took from Preston's mansion earlier. As he is walking away, Leary's posters can be seen on the walls of the city of Los Angeles. King returns to South Africa where he is welcomed back and is revealed to be a detective with the local police force.

The city also known as Acilisene and Keltzene.Cuinet, La Turquie d'Asie, I ( Paris , 1892), p210-216. The town was also known as Acilisene and Keltzene, Eliza and Erzindjan.

Bishopric It is hard to tell when Acilisene became a bishopric. The first bishop is attested in the mid-5th century, Le Quien mentions six bishops: *Ioannes, who in 459 signed the decree of Patriarch Gennadius I of Constantinople against the simoniacs. *Georgius or Gregorius (both forms are found) was one of the Fathers of the Second Council of Constantinople (553), appearing as \\"bishop of Justinianopolis\\". *Theodorus was at the Third Council of Constantinople in 681, signing as \\"bishop of Justinianopolis or the region of Ecclenzine\\". *Georgius was at the Photian Council of Constantinople (879). Until the 10th century, the diocese itself appears in none of the Notitiae Episcopatuum. By 980, they present it as an autocephalous archdiocese, and those of the 11th century present it as a metropolitan see with 21 suffragans.

Train overcrowding, technically known as \\"passengers in excess of capacity\\" is a major source of public complaint about railway travel in the United Kingdom. Large numbers of commuters have to stand on trains into and out of London, and other major cities, with more than a third of passengers standing on some services. Public resentment about overcrowding, combined with the high prices of tickets, have made this a political issue. Most overcrowded services of the ten most overcrowded train services, six were services to and from the London mainline stations London Paddington, London Victoria, and London Waterloo stations, three were services to or from Manchester Airport, and the other was part of the Thameslink Brighton to Bedford service, passing through London Blackfriars station which, , has been described as the most overcrowded in the country. Reasons for overcrowding The growth in train overcrowding is largely attributed to increased passenger demand, and the 'walk-up' nature of British railways, in which seat reservations are not required, combined with the inability to run extra trains due to the limitations of the current railway signalling system. To resolve the latter problem, a transition to the European Train Control System (ETCS) is planned, which would allow many more trains to be run; by permitting them to be run closer together, while maintaining similar safety margins, potentially doubling capacity on some routes at busy times. Passenger demand can often reach up to double the available seat capacity. Because of the different classes of train tickets, passengers with second class tickets often have to stand, even when empty seats are available in first class carriages. Although reserved seats on many trains may be occupied if they are not taken up by the passenger who has booked them, many passengers are not aware of this. Solutions to overcrowding To further increase rail transport capacity, there is a large ongoing programme of upgrades to the network, including Thameslink, Crossrail, electrification of lines, in-cab signalling, the Northern Hub, new inter-city trains, and a new high-speed line. Other In August 2016, Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, was featured in a video showing him sitting on the floor of a train, in which he made a statement about overcrowding. The video, and the subsequent controversy regarding it, became known as 'Traingate'.

He is sometimes also recorded as Neil Bass Mackay or Neil Wasse Mackay which was a nickname taken from the fact that for a time he was a prisoner on the Bass Rock. Early life and imprisonment The Bass Rock where Neil Mackay was imprisoned as a hostage after the parliament of 1427 and was afterwards known as Neil Bass Mackay Neil Mackay, 8th of Strathnaver was the eldest son of Angus Du Mackay, 7th of Strathnaver and his wife Elizabeth, sister of Donald of Islay, Lord of the Isles. In 1427 his father, Angus Du Mackay, was called by James I of Scotland to a parliament at Inverness and King James having returned from captivity in England found his country in a very distracted state.Mackay, Angus. p. 57. The result was that although Angus Du Mackay was released, his son Neil was kept as a hostage and imprisoned on the Bass Rock.Mackay, Angus. p. 59. While Neil was kept as a prisoner his father‚Äôs cousins, Neil Neilson Mackay and Morgan Neilson Mackay, attempted to take over the Mackay lands of Strathnaver with the support of the Murrays of Aberscross and the Clan Sutherland.Mackay, Angus. p. 59-60. However, they were defeated by Angus‚Äôs forces who were led by his second son, John Mackay, I of Aberach at the Battle of Drumnacoub in 1433, although Angus was killed. Neil Mackay remained in captivity for some years after his father‚Äôs death and in the meantime maintenance of the Mackay interests devolved upon his brother, John Mackay of Aberach. Escape from the Bass Rock In 1436, or 1437, King James was murdered at Perth and Neil Mackay escaped from imprisonment on the Bass Rock. This was apparently achieved with help from the wife of the governor, Lauder. John Mackay of Aberach handed over governance of the clan to Neil upon his return and Neil rewarded him with lands in Strathnaver. In 1437, Neil Mackay having returned home led an expedition into Caithness at the head of his clansmen. This conflict became known as the Sandside Chase in which the Caithness men, believed to have been of the Clan Gunn, were defeated. Family Neil Mackay, 8th of Strahtnaver, married a daughter of George Munro, 10th Baron of Foulis, chief of Clan Munro, and his wife who was a daughter of Ross of Balnagown, chief of Clan Ross. They had the following children: #Angus Roy Mackay, 9th of Strathnaver, who was killed at the Battle of Tarbat in 1486. #John Roy Mackay, who had a son called William Roy Mackay. #Elizabeth Mackay who married John MacGillion of Lochbuie, chief of the Clan Maclaine of Lochbuie.

Rainer was the world's first actor to win back to back Oscars in 1936 & 1937\\\\. Rainer had been forgotten when the Boulevard der Stars opened in 2010 in Potsdamerplatz, Berlin, despite being Germany's only Academy Award-winning actor. In 2011, Rainer was nominated for a star but was then rejected by the jury (Senta Berger, Gero Gandert, Uwe Kammann, Dieter Kosslick and Hans Helmut Prinzler). Baylay campaigned across Germany, lobbying press and politicians to support the campaign to have the actress and her work recognised. The campaign was supported by the German Central Council of Jews. In August 2011, the Boulevard der Stars finally relented acknowledging the social media, email and letter campaign led by Baylay had been key in their decision to awarding an additional star in favour of Luise Rainer. In September 2011, Rainer then aged 101, flew to Berlin from her London home to formally receive her star on the Boulevard der Stars together with Paul Baylay and Klaus Wowerweit, the mayor of Berlin.

He is best known as a textile artist, with work held in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Museum of English Rural Life in Reading, and the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra.  Biography  Michael was son of Patrick O'Connell and his wife Mary Cecilia, and was born in Dalton, Cumbria, in 1898. After the death of his father from Typhoid in 1900, he was brought up solely by his mother and was educated at Ushaw College, County Durham. He joined an Irish regiment in 1916 to fight in World War I but was taken prisoner in 1918. After the war he took some training in agriculture before emigrating to Australia in 1920 to attend an agricultural college in Wagga Wagga. O'Connell soon abandoned agriculture and moved to Beaumaris, near Melbourne. He built his own house, 'Barbizon', in 1923 when his previous home ‚Äì a tent ‚Äì was condemned by a health inspector. He became a member and councilor of the Arts and Crafts Society in Melbourne, where he met his wife Ella Moody (n√©e Evans-Vaughan) (1900‚Äì1981), a textile artist and embroiderer. They married on 4 April 1931 in Melbourne. Michael and Ella moved to England in 1937. They built their new home 'The Chase' at Perry Green, Hertfordshire. Michael was commissioned to create a series of wall hangings depicting rural Britain for the Festival of Britain in 1951, after which he received various new commissions for other public and private murals. His work was then exhibited in New York, Melbourne and London. In the 1960s he traveled widely and taught at art schools. In 1970 a devastating fire destroyed his workshop, including most of his notebooks and records. The house was rebuilt with the help of students and friends, but it was also in this period that his eyesight began to fail. O'Connell died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds on 9 December 1976 at his home.  Work  Michael O'Connell was primarily a textile artist, but was also noted for his work in architecture and home furnishings. = Architecture and home furnishings = Michael O'Connell was the architect of two buildings in his lifetime, both of which he lived in.  Barbizon  O'Connell built 'Barbizon' in 1923 in Beaumaris, Victoria. Its design was that of a large, open-plan cruciform building made primarily of homemade concrete blocks. Its name was probably a reference to the Barbizon school of art, but its design and functionalism were born of necessity and looked to modernism, and has been called the first modernist house built in Melbourne. Barbizon became his personal studio and became a gathering place for fellow artists. It was here that O'Connell first experimented with the concrete garden sculpture, the linocuts, and the textiles that were to make his name. The house was destroyed in a fire in 1947.  The Chase  O'Connell built The Chase in Perry Green, Hertfordshire, with his wife Ella in 1937. They had both recently returned to England from Australia. They continued to produce printed textiles identified as Mael Fabrics, possibly a combination of their names and a recognition of Ella's contribution. A fire broke out at The Chase's studio in 1970, burning much of O'Connell's records and artwork. The home was rebuilt with the help of friends and students. = Textiles =  Australian work  O'Connell began experimenting with textiles in the 1920s, a time when he was an active member of the Arts and Craft Society in Melbourne. While working with garden designer Edna Walling on local exhibitions, he began experimenting with the dyeing and printing techniques that would eventually make his name. His work during his period is colorful and vibrant, with obvious influences from aboriginal culture. The most important Australian work is Pandemonium, a fabric frieze made in 1930, and in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia.  Post-1937 work  Shortly before the Second World War, O'Connell and Christopher Heal (of Heal's, London) developed a close working relationship. The friendship continued through the war years, and it is probably during this time that Michael developed his techniques and moved into freehand drawing with the resist pastes. Christopher Heal was instrumental in obtaining supplies of fabric for the Festival of Britain wall hangings. O'Connell was commissioned to create wall hangings depicting British rural life, architecture and landscapes. He traveled across the country, taking observations for what would become seven gigantic hangings, each measuring 7x3.8 metres. These were sewn together into a long curtain measuring 56x4 meters, which was then hung from a railing in the Country Pavilion at the Festival of Britain. After their display they were toured to New Zealand and Australia before being acquired by the Museum of English Rural Life, where they were used as backdrops to their tents at country shows before being put into storage for around 55 years. Two, Cheshire and Kent, have now been conserved and will be displayed in rotation for five years each at the Museum of English Rural Life. The regions represented on the wall hangings are: * Rutlandshire * Scotland and Wales * Yorkshire * The Fens * Kent * Cheshire After the Festival of Britain the popularity of O'Connell's work increased and he received commissions to create murals for public buildings, restaurants, factory canteens and showrooms. His work was exhibited in New York, Melbourne and London. In the 1960s, he began to travel widely and to teach his techniques in art schools. He also worked with architects, producing murals for universities and churches.

Filmed in 2016, the film had its world premiere at the Rome Film Festival on October 16, 2019. It was released on February 28, 2020, by Screen Media Films. Plot Like the original Going Places, it follows a trio of sexually depraved misfits, played by John Turturro, Bobby Cannavale and Audrey Tautou.

However, John Turturro expressed keen interest in reprising his role as Jesus at least since 2002. Despite not being one of the film's writers, most of Jesus' character came from Turturro's own ideas, which led the Coens to give him a bigger place in the film. In 2014, Turturro announced that he had requested permission from the Coens to use the character. In August 2016, it was announced that Turturro, after being granted the right to use the character of Jesus by the Coens (who are not involved in the production), had already started filming the spin-off, which he would also write and direct. Filming locations included New York City and Los Angeles.

It stars Mikkel Vadsholt, Siir Tilif, Brian Hjulmann and Mia Lerdam. The movie evolved from a previous project, White Pig, whose scope was too large to shoot independently, so the filmmaker took one character and developed a movie about him. Mikkel Vadsholt's portrayal of the Bakerman character won the 2017 Best Male Actor Award at the Nordic International Film Festival in New York. Plot \\"A Nordic FALLING DOWN, Jens (Mikkel Vadsholdt) has accepted far too much for too long. Being the shy night-owl he is, he keeps to himself, but the world will not let him be. The new master baker's quality starts slackening, and when a bunch of yobs one day smash the window of Jens's car, he takes one of them out. Intoxicated by his own new unexpressed vigour, Jens comes out of his shell, but the destructive driving force leads him towards a free fall. A film that is as shocking with its vigilante story as it is captivating with its determination. Headed by Mikkel Vadsholdt, who here manages to arouse our empathy in a role of a reserved man who has difficulty coping with the light of day.\\" The film's tagline is \\"Man shall not live by bread alone...\\" Film festivals and awards Bakerman had its world premier at Denmark's biggest film festival, CPH:PIX.

His true form is the legendary warrior , he chased his twisted doppelg√§nger Dark Zagi and managed to defeat the villain but the battle cost him his true form, causing him revert first into where he chased the Space Beast, Beast the One to Earth and bonded with an Air Force pilot named Shunichi Maki. Five years later in 2009, he evolved into Ultraman Nexus and bonded with several hosts, called Dunamists to fight against a wave of Space Beasts and the dark giants. When Dark Zagi rose to prominence once more, Nexus bonded with Kazuki Komon and regained his true form, Noa, defeated the evil warrior and finally killed him for good. Nexus has become the main Ultra Warrior in the ULTRA N PROJECT media of the Ultra Series and continues to appear in later installments in this form despite his true and strongest form being Noa, although the latter did had several appearances. A distinction of Nexus from the other Ultra Warriors is his Energy Core, which he retained in all of his forms, which is used as the main logo of the ULTRA N PROJECT. As Noa, he is acknowledged by the franchise to be the oldest Ultra in existence at the age of 350,000 years old, surpassing Ultraman King from Ultraman Leo whose age is 300,000 years old. Ultraman Nexus' grunts were provided by , who did Noa's grunts as well. As Ultraman The Next, he was voiced by , the current voice actor of Zoffy in the Heisei Era of Ultra Series. In the series, Ultraman Nexus was played by suit actors , who was also Ultraman Noa's suit actor and sometimes by , the suit actor of dark giants Dark Faust, Dark Mephisto and Dark Zagi. For Ultraman The Next, his suit actor was . Character Conception The prototype design for Junis Modes of Ultraman Nexus, drawn by Hiroshi Maruyama. All of Nexus' forms (including The Next and Noa), were designed by Hiroshi Maruyama. His original design was meant to be neutral but was soon enhanced with Japanese clothing. Nexus's head resembled the kabuto helmet and his entire body is based on hakama. The black lining on his body was themed after calligraphy. When he transforms into Junis, the suit would feature another resemblance to kamishimo. Hiroshi Maruyama had also proposed three design variations for Junis Modes for Ultraman Nexus. Ultraman Nexus, alongside the series itself, was originally meant to be named Ultraman Cross. Reminiscing on his younger days in Chigasaki, Kanagawa, producer Hiroyasu Shibuya remembered the Hakone Ekiden, which is a popular relay marathon races held between Tokyo and Hakone in Japan on 2 and 3 January, around the New Year and decided to use the sport as the plann for Dunamists, Nexus' Ultra Hosts that passed the baton of Ultraman to each other in a similar way to said participants. It also refers to Kazuki Komon, the series' main character, who has made multiple connections with every Dunamists he came across and eventually envisioned the series as a \\"mystery relay race\\". When still in the Ultraman Cross stages, the protagonist was never meant to be a member of an attack team and said team was originally meant to be a bunch of drop-outs, who eventually ranked up into a first-class team, fitting with the series' main theme, \\"to connect the bonds\\". According to Yuichi Abe, the production team also thought of the \\"Meta-Field\\" concept, which involves fighting in an alternate dimension, becoming one of the plot points of the story, considering that not many characters in the story had any awareness of either Ultraman or the monsters. Ultraman The Next's design was combined from Ultraman Nexus and the original Ultraman's Type A and Type B suits. The Next's Anphans mode was particularly based on Ultra Type A, due to their similar \\"wrinkled\\" appearances. Before his suit was made, a clay model of the Next was sculpted. Maruyama stressed the difficulty of reinventing the Ultraman design, stating, \\"Ultraman is a very simple design. This, unfortunately, removed some of the simplicity which is a big part of the design‚Äôs charm. But it really can‚Äôt be helped. If you tried to remove anything form that design what would you have? It would look like Pepsi Man!\\" Maruyama originally wanted to give Ultraman \\"transparent skin\\" with \\"glowing streams of red energy\\" but stated that the executives found the idea \\"a bit too shocking\\". Keeping director Konaka's concept of \\"mutant Ultraman\\" in mind, Maruyama also emphasizes the image of lava instead of muscles and blood vessels, with Anphans being based on solidified cold lava whereas Junis is burning red. Ultraman Noa's design was proposed to be a break away from conventional designs of Ultra Warriors. His original design lacked the Noa Aegis on his back. Another break from the tradition was his energy core, which was located in the same place where an Ultra Warriors' Color Timer was supposed to be. The suit also has silver plating in addition to the color paint, but because the paint took time to dry, Noa's first photo session had his suit with visible fingerprints and scratches. =Name= Ultraman Nexus was never mentioned by his full name through most of the series, only being called \\"Ultraman\\" or the \\"giant of light\\". His personal name, Nexus was brought up by Kazuki Komon in the final episode after inheriting the Ultra's light. As the Next, it was a code name by Sara Mizuhara due to him being a countermeasure against Beast the One. As Ultraman Noa, his name was derived from the prophet in the Abrahamic religions, Noah. History =Ultraman Noa: Battle of Dream= Known as the legendary giant that protected the galaxy in ancient times, eventually gaining the title . 20,000 years prior to Ultraman Nexus, Nebula M80 of the globular cluster of Scorpius is at the edge of extinction from the attacks of Space Beasts, carnivorous monsters whose sole purpose in existence was to feed on the fears of other beings. Noa engaged in a fierce fight against these monsters, bonding with various beings called Dunamists, whose desired to protect those closest to them, giving the silver giant the strength he needed to fight. Exhausted from the battle, Noa descended into a long slumber and at that time a group of alien beings (who would be called the \\"Visitors\\") attempted to create a protector of their own, known as Ultinoid Zagi. This giant was inspired from Ultraman Noa but once awakened, he developed a twisted consciousness upon discovering his status as a fake Ultraman and began to rampage as Dark Zagi. This leaves his creators with no choice but to destroy their own planet by detonating their sun, in an attempt to destroy their mistake. Dark Zagi, however, survived and entered a portal that was created by said explosion, leading him towards the Universe of the Land of Light in the Nebula M78, facing the Ultra Brothers while leading his own army of monsters. The Land of Light at that time was in an era of crisis and during the confrontation with the Ultra Brothers, Zagi briefly held Zoffy as a hostage. Noa joined forces with the Space Garrison and finally sent both himself and Zagi back to their dimension. While Zagi lost his physical form, Noa sealed the dimensional portal with Noa The Final but the cost was being reverted into Ultraman the Next. =Ultraman The Next= Ultraman The Next in Anphans vs Beast the One in Reputiria Pursuing the Space Beast called The One to Earth in 2004, The Next soon bonded with Air Force pilot Shunichi Maki, a family man whose only wish was to take his son on a flight before his possible death from an incurable disease. When Maki was used as bait to lure The One, he soon transformed into The Next, using his newfound power to defend himself before The One retreated and the Ultra reverted to Maki from his injuries. Although refusing to transform again, Maki used The Next once more to fight Beast the One in a tunnel and rescue a mother-child pair from a falling building, simultaneously evolved into Junis Mode. As this form was bigger than before, The Next engaged in a final battle against The One, receiving support from the Air Force and finally defeated the One with the Evol Ray Schtrom beam attack. In the aftermath, The Next separated from Maki and fully healed him before going into a deep slumber. =Ultraman Nexus= In 2008 (the story eventually progressed to 2009 for the finale), The Next reawakened and evolved into Nexus. He first bonded with former cameraman Jun Himeya. Through this bond, it provided Nexus with the ability to evolve into Junis. Despite his mission to fight against the Space Beasts and save civilians, he was treated as a monster by the Night Raiders except one of them, Komon, who saw him as an ally due to being saved by the Ultraman before and the two became fast friends. Nexus faced several trials and his strength was put to test when facing against Dark Faust and Dark Mephisto. In addition, because of his ties to Nexus, Himeya was caught by the TLT and forced to be used in an experiment in creating a weapon that is capable of taking down the Space Beast. Ultraman Nexus Junis vs Dark Mephisto Although he managed to escape, the Illustrator warned him that due to his body condition, one more transformation would kill him. In the Land of the Dead, Nexus fought against Kutuura with Himeya's long time friend who was held captive by Dark Mephisto but his injuries took effect and in the aftermath, he was captured and seemingly died from the depletion of his energy. The Night Raiders entered the land of the dead and managed to defeat Kutuura with the Ultimate Vanisher, a new beam weapon developed from Nexus' energy beam. Through Himeya's renewed spirit, Nexus was partially revived but while still in weakened state, the Night Raiders used the Ultimate Vanisher's last bit of energy to revive Nexus, allowing the Ultra Warrior to turn the tables and defeat Mephisto but seemingly died in the explosion. Before departing, Himeya had a last talk with Komon and reassured him that the light would be passed on to someone else. Ultraman Nexus Junis Blue killing a second Galberos. The baton of light was soon passed to Ren Senjyu, a child who was born from an experiment who worked in an amusement park. Nexus bonded with the youth and received Junis Blue as a result. In a similar way to Himeya, Ren befriended with Komon, who was also aware of the latter's inheritance to Nexus' light and alongside other Night Raiders, he revolted the TLT's decision to have Ren be a test subject like Himeya was. Junis Blue also fought Mephisto Zwei, a Dark Mephisto clone from a corrupted Memory Police officer. During this battle, Nexus gained assistance from the original Mephisto (who wished to redeem himself) and the latter sacrificed himself to have the warrior of light kill his clone. However, his final days as a Dunamist nearing close, due to the flaws in his DNA during his creation. In a similar state to his predecessor Himeya, Ren's condition affected his prowess when fighting against Ezmael, a combination of past Space Beasts until Night Raiders provide cover for him long enough to come up with a new attack that could finally defeat the monster. Nexus soon ended their merger and Ren survived due to the cure for his condition. As the light choose Nagi, the deputy captain of Night Raider, the villain, prior called Unknown Hand, revealed himself, and that he had orchestrated the incidents during the series' course and did so for Nagi to gain the light. With few available TLT forces left, they faced Unknown but an enraged Nagi transformed into Nexus, which lead to her capture and Unknown Hand's resurrection into Dark Zagi. His revival caused simultaneous Space Beast attacks worldwide while he was rampaging in Japan. Komon managed to save Nagi and his actions lead him to inherit of Nexus' light. Transforming into the giant, Komon used all of Nexus' past forms with memories of his predecessors encouraging him to keep on fighting until he evolved into the true form that Nexus had lost long ago, Ultraman Noa. As Noa, Komon easily overpowered Zagi in terms of strength and quickly finished him off when their beams clashed with each other. =Dreams= In a novel that was bundled with the release of Ultraman Nexus TV Complete DVD Box, three years after Dark Zagi's destruction (2012), Komon was appointed to the captain of Japan's branch of the Night Raider with Noa having already left him. However, when an unknown man revealed himself to be the Dark Giant, Dark Lucifer, both him and Nagi bonded with Ultraman Noa once more to counter this threat. =Subsequent and other historical parts= Chatamu and the Noa statue in episode 7 of Ultraman. *Ultraman (1966): In episode 7, it was revealed that a figure named had once protected Baradhi civilization from Antlar through the blue stone of Baradhi. This figure is portrayed in an identical resemblance to the original Ultraman, so much that when the titular character appeared, he was hailed as such by the locals of that civilization. This eventually led to a popular theory that the figure in question is indeed Ultraman Noa by fans, which was acknowledged in episode 28 of Shin Ultraman Retsuden by Ultraman Zero. *Ultraman Zero: The Revenge of Belial (2010): In this movie, Ultraman Noa was revealed to have been created the Shield of Baradhi, which placed alongside his statue underneath the surface of the Planet of Mirrors. When Run, Nao and Emerana tried to retrieve it, the shield crumbled to dust due to its age but soon appeared for real when the resistances do not surrender to Belial's tyranny, causing Ultraman Noa to appear in Zero's mind, reviving him and providing the young warrior with the Shield of Baraj's true form: Ultimate Aegis. With the shield itself, Zero was able to turn the tables against Belial and killed him with a single blow. *Ultraman Ginga S The Movie (2015): Nexus was among the Heisei Ultras that were held captive by Etelgar until the UPG members freed them. While the other Heisei Ultras made their way to the top Etelgar's tower, Nexus was forced to stay behind to fight against a replica of Dark Mephisto before joining other Heisei Ultras to destroy Etelgar's castle. According to the official website, Nexus briefly fought Etelgar as Noa but the stress from that battle forced him to devolved. He was voiced by and Joe Chambrello in the English Dub. As with all Heisei Ultraman, Nexus's dialogue is accompanied with him shouting the name of his attacks. This part was made intentional by movie director Koichi Sakamoto, who wants the young audiences (children) to remember their attacks. *Ultraman X (2015): Nexus appeared in episode 20 of the series. Arrived on an alternate Earth after Space Beasts appeared in that universe first. Nexus bonded with Sayuri Tachibana, Xio's lieutenant, to help her with defending her family in Canada against Bemular and assisted X in defeating a giant Bugbuzun Brood. Before departing, he told Daichi to never give up in his dreams and gave him a Cyber Card. In this episode, Nexus and X first met Bugbuzun Brood in Shinjuku before being taken into the Meta-Field. The city's skyline was recycled from Ultraman: The Next movie and initially the battle scene was meant to be in said city before the production team decided to film it in the Meta-Field instead. *Ultraman X The Movie (2016): Nexus' card was among the Ultra Warrior Cyber Cards in Xio's possession. The Ultramen cards resonated with people's hopes and brought them to fight against Tsurugi Demaaga that rampaged worldwide. Nexus Junis Mode fought against one in Cairo, Egypt and like the rest of the Ultra Warriors, he was given an additional power boost to destroy the monsters. The Ultra Warriors later regrouped, meeting with X before leaving. *Ultraman Z (2020): Nexus' power inhabited the , one of the many Ultra Medals developed on the Land of Light. After its theft and destruction of Genegarg on Earth, Nexus was among those salvaged by GAFJ and retrieved by Ultraman Z, using it alongside Cosmos and Mebius to execute . Profile Ultraman Nexus's statistics below were never mentioned in the original series, but were brought up in magazines and official websites: *Height: micro ~ 49 m (can also shrink to 10 ~ 20 m, depending on locations) *Weight: 40,000 t (Anphans), 44,000 t (Junis), 42,000 t (Junis Blue) *Flight Speed: Mach 3 (Anphans), Mach 4 (Junis), Mach 5 (Junis Blue) *Time Limit: 3 minutes (in Meta Field) *Birthplace: Unknown *Year Debut: 2004 *First Appearance: Ultraman Nexus (2004) =Description= As the official website of Tsuburaya Productions stated: \\"An Ultraman whose power is transformed by the Dunamists. The baton of Dunamist has been passed to multiple individuals such as news cameraman Jun Himeya, amusement park worker Ren Senjyu, TLT-J Vice Captain Nagi Saijyo and officer Kazuki Komon.

It functions in a similar manner to an Ultra Warrior's standard Color Timer and blinks when Nexus reaches his limits. Aside from being a power source, several of Nexus' attacks are directly channeled through said organ. *: A Color Timer-like organ which is spotted in Nexus' Junis modes. It functions like a normal Color Timer, notifying the Ultra Warrior of his time limit when entering Meta Field. *: A pair of bracers on Nexus' arms, which provided him with multiple techniques and attacks. Underneath these bracers are blade protrusions which can be used for melee combat or generating beam projectiles. **: Once assuming Junis Blue, the right Armed Nexus transforms into the Arrow Armed Nexus. The bracer possess four modes, with one being its default form and the other three initiate corresponding attacks. =Forms and abilities= Unlike most Ultras, Nexus' flight method did not require him to perform hand maneuvers.

It also can use the Energy Core activate a hidden function called , allowing Nexus to unleash his hidden energy. This technique was used by Himeya in episode 24 to partially revive Nexus, director's cut version of episode 29 by Ren to escape from Banpira's webbing and in final episode by Komon to evolve Nexus to his Junis forms and finally regaining Ultraman Noa. *: An evolved form of Ultraman Nexus from Anphans, gained through his bonding with Himeya. When in this mode, Nexus can utilize summoning the Meta Field that transports himself and any opponent to an alternate dimension so that he can safely battle without causing damage to their surroundings. The analysis later showed that the Meta Field is actually a manifestation of the host's physical body, which was why every battle affected Himeya so greatly and continued to weaken him. Junis mode's ultimate attack is the , an L-shape beam attack fired from Nexus' right forearm and through the use of Energy Core. This form is usually utilized by Himeya but was once used by Komon and Sayuri. **: A momentary power boost that is nigh- identical to Ultraman Tiga's Glitter Tiga. Appeared in Ginga S The Movie, this form is used by all Heisei Ultras to empower their finishers and destroy Etelgar's castle. *: An evolved version of the original Junis, which trades the red markings for a blue coloration and was acquired through Nexus' bonding with Ren Senjyu. This form retained the abilities used by Anphans and the original Junis, such as Cross Ray Schtrom and Board Ray Feather. This form reflects its user (Ren)'s disregard of his own safety due to his status as a short-lived human, hence the Junis Blue being generally sleeker and overall faster than the previous modes. He also gained the Arrow Armed Nexus, which allows him to use and utilize the energy bow attack . However, his strongest attack is by combining the former two attacks into the . This form is generally used by Ren and was once utilized by Komon in his final battle against Dark Zagi before evolving into Ultraman Noa. =Ultraman the Next= *Height: 10 m (Anphans), 40 m (Junis) *Weight: 2.5 ton (Anphans), 26,000 t (Junis) The Next is Nexus' lowest forms possible, which was first shown after Noa used the ability Noa The Final, regressing him into this state. When chasing The One to Earth, he bonded with Shunichi Maki but was originally at his weakest form Anphans, he soon evolved into Junis with their merging being completed. Unlike other Dunamists after him, Maki transformed through sheer willpower. *Anphans: The Next's original form, which is an analogous to Ultraman Type A and Nexus' Anphans. Because of his incomplete merging, The Next is only 10 meters tall, which was enough to face The One in Reputiria stage. The Next's fighting style involves the use of brute strength and normal physical attacks. His only ranged attack is , which launches energy blade projection. *Junis: The Next's evolved form, which is an analogous to Ultraman Type B and Nexus junis. This form is achieved upon his complete merging with Maki, thus making its appearance higher and nearing close to Nexus. The Next gained a pair of bracers called , which allows him to utilize energy-based attacks, such as , an improved variant of Anphans' Elbow Cutter. His finisher is , which decomposes his opponents to molecular levels. =Ultraman Noa= Ultraman Noa *Height: micro ~ 50 m (55 m with Noa Aegis) *Weight: 55,000 t *Age: 350,000 years old *Flight speed: Unmeasurable *Running speed: Mach 27 *Underwater speed: Mach 17 *Latent speed: Mach 15 *Jumping height: 10,000 m *Grip strength: 250,000 t *Brute strength: 220,000 t The true form of Nexus, Noa is in fact the strongest of all previous forms and possess the on his back. He originally lost this form a long time ago after sealing a dimensional portal to the Land of Light via technique but regained it after multiple mergers with past Dunamists and the most recent one being Komon. In this form, Noa managed to turn the tables against his revived adversary, Dark Zagi and defeated him when their finishers clashed. Noa's finishing attack is called , but has three stronger attacks, being the aforementioned Noa The Final, the dimensional travelling ability and the yet to be revealed . =Ultra Warriors with Nexus' powers= The list below refers to later Ultras who possess a replica of or inherited their powers from Ultraman Nexus or his strongest form, Noa. *Ultimate Zero *Ultraman Ginga Victory *Ultraman X **Ultraman Zero Armor (indirectly via Ultimate Zero) **Ultraman Nexus Cyber Card *Ultraman Orb Spacium Schtrom *Ultraman Geed Noactive Succeed In other media =Video Games= *Ultraman Nexus is one of the playable characters in the crossover game HEROES' VS. He is voiced by Takuji Kawakubo, the actor for Kazuki Komon. *As a tie-in to the Ginga S Movie, a smartphone game was released, called the . Nexus was reimagined as the original ninja from Sanada Ten Braves, , also called as . His main weapon is a Yari. *Ultraman Nexus is part of the characters in Ultraman:Be Ultra, a mobile game based on the Ultraman manga. He is represented as an Ultraman Suit modeled after his Junis Blue Mode. Dunamists are beings who bonded with Nexus due to their willingness to risk themselves when protecting their loved ones from Space Beasts. All Dunamists exhibited the ability to use extrasensory perception and superhuman abilities. In Nexus' cases, they also gained the , a gun which fires vacuum bullet ammunition and is also capable of exorcising dark influences on humans and creating a protective barrier. Although only demonstrated by Himeya, they also utilized a transportation called that can heal the injuries they sustained. =Shunichi Maki= is the first Dunamist on Earth, bonded with Noa's devolved form The Next and the main character of Ultraman: The Next 2004 movie. An air force pilot whose content on flying with his ill son, Shunichi encountered the light, who was revealed to be Ultraman The Next and bonded with him. Although originally discharged, his connection to the light was soon exploited by BSCT in hopes of killing The One, a monster with a similar origin to Maki. When The One attacked BSCT's headquarters, it was then when Maki transformed into The Next in Anphans, successfully fending off against The One before it retreated. Maki reverted to himself after exhausted and chastised the team for using him as a life bait, though one of them, Sara stated that he was fated to be The One's enemy due to his inheritance of the strange light, dubbed as \\"The Next\\". Although BSCT offered Maki to assist them, he refused and wished to spend more time with his son. Promising the boy to take a flight with him again, Maki finally joined the BSCT in pursuing The One. When The One grew into a gigantic monster, Maki transformed into The Next and this time evolved into Junis, capable of fighting in a more stabilized form and finally put an end to The One's assaults by killing him with Evol Ray Storm. The Next severed his bonds with Maki and gave him another life force to fulfill his promise on taking his son to a flight. Maki was briefly mentioned in episode 33 of Ultraman Nexus when Sara Mizuhara explained him to TLT-J members, now with their secrets were quickly discovered. Shunichi Maki was portrayed by . =Jun Himeya= is the second Deunamist, first appeared in episode 1 to 24 before reappearing in the finale. He as a serious, somewhat brooding individual, not given to trusting institutions such as the Night Raiders. He eventually struck up some sort of kinship with Komon, rescuing him from danger a few times. Himeya was a photojournalist, specializing in war photos. During one assignment (presumably somewhere in Southeast Asia), he was injured and subsequently treated by an orphan named Sera. tragically, Sera was caught up in armed conflict, and was killed as she rushed towards Himeya. A distraught Himeya returned; ironically, he became famous for the collection of pictures he took. Sometime after, Himeya encountered the Light. Trying to make up for what he was unable to do in the past, Himeya used the power of the Light to protect humanity and battle the Space Beasts, sacrificing everything within battle. After a climactic battle with Dark Mephisto, Himeya is presumed to have died; at the end of the series, the viewer learns that Himeya had survived, very much alive and well. Jun Himeya was portrayed by . While planning, the crew also thought up of mature side for the characters. One such example was Jun Himeya, who they thought up of using the Devilman concept by having the character drunk with power and somewhat having internal conflicts with himself. This darker concept been had long planned but was forced to be scrapped due to the events of September 11 attacks and instead created a milder storyline which came into realization as Ultraman: The Next. =Ren Senjyu= is the third Dunamist, receiving the Light after Himeya's disappearance. Outwardly, he is cheerful, optimistic and simple to the point of ditsy ‚Äî this, however, conceals his past experiences. Ren is not a normal human, but rather a 'son of Prometheus': a human created through genetic engineering under the flag of \\"Prometheus Project\\" (an experiment performed in Dallas, Texas in the United States). He has faster reflexes, physical strength and ESP than a normal human. However, Ren suffered from a genetic imbalance in his DNA which cuts his lifespan to only 17‚Äì18 years. His only hope to prolong his life was a drug known only as 'Raphael'. Running away from the institute in Dallas, Ren came to Japan hoping to live his last days as a 'normal' human, but instead encountered the Light and become Nexus' third Dunamist. By the end of the series, Ren survived and presumably continues to live a normal life in Japan. Ren Senjyu was portrayed by . =Nagi Saijyo= is the deputy captain of the Night Raiders. She is very strict, especially to Komon and can be quite brutal in certain situations. She hates Space Beasts, stemming from incidents regarding her childhood and her former lover Shinya Mizorogi, the former deputy leader of the team. When she was younger, her parents were murdered by a Space Beast (In the end revealed as Dark Zagi in human form). After she joined the Night Raiders to fulfill her vow to destroy the beings that killed her mother, she met and eventually fell in love with Mizorogi Shinya, the former deputy leader of Night Raider. When Mizorogi fell to the dark side, she deepened her hatred and was willing to do anything to bring down a Space Beast, which she does not know that the hatred is actually a trap set up by Dark Zagi to make her surrender all of the light to him when she became a Dunamist. In the final episode, she is saved by Komon when the darkness tries to devour her. Nagi Saijyo was portrayed by . According to the production crew, Nagi was meant to be Komon's savior in the past. To completely shroud the character, she was given the appearance of Himeya's shadow while retaining a Night Raider glove. This plan however never came to realization after the series was forced to be ended quickly due to poor ratings. =Kazuki Komon= is the main viewpoint character and sometimes narrator of the series. Komon is a kind-hearted, straightforward person who is always willing to help others. Before he was recruited by TLT, Komon was from a rescue team. When Komon was a child, he fell into a river and almost drowned, only to be rescued by a mysterious person he believes to be an alien. Because of the incident, Komon decided to help others and joining the Night Raiders was a good opportunity to do so. He is later revealed to be the last Dunamist chosen by The Light. Because of his interaction with the first two Dunamists enabling him to inherit their light, during his battle against Dark Zagi not only he was able to switch to both Junis and Junis Blue modes, but he was able to evolve into his ultimate form: Ultraman Noa. Kazuki Komon is portrayed by . Komon is already considered as an important character during the show's planning, as the production crew compared his meeting newer Dunamists and befriended them in a similar manner to the Dunamists' concept of \\"relay race\\". During the audition of said characters, the production crew asked the actors to describe \\"hero\\" from their own point of view. Takuji Kawakubo answered, \\"It's a longing. Its what you want yourself to become.\\" This eventually made Komon as the final Dunamist of the series. =Sayuri Tachibana= is the 40-year-old female deputy captain of Xio, an expert in search and rescue missions and a tactical leader due to her past as a member of a rescue team. She is also observant of Xio members and acts as a parental figure despite her stoic demeanor. She has two daughters, who immigrated to Canada with Tachibana's husband due to safety measures. In episode 20, she was temporary elected as the sixth Dunamist by Ultraman Nexus, using the opportunity to rescue her family in Canada and helped Ultraman X fight Bugbuzun Brood. Her temporary bonding with Nexus leaves her a clue to Ultraman X's identity. Sayuri Tachibana is portrayed by . The reason Sayuri was chosen as a Dunamist is a tribute to Nagi Saijyo from Ultraman Nexus, who was supposedly to have a deeper plot involvement as the fourth Dunamist but was quickly cancelled and given a slight chance in the final episode due to the series' poor ratings. Reception =Critical Commentary= During an interview with the production crew of Ultraman Nexus, Yuichi Abe noted that the most surprising part for Nexus is how the Ultra's human host changes from time to time, which is considered as the originality of the show. Kazuya Konaka also added that had the series did not shortened, he would have expanded said concept. =Popularity= In the Ultra Series' 45th anniversary (2011), Nexus was placed tenth in the popularity poll and ranked sixth in 2013 with a total of 4084 voters. =Merchandise= Ultraman Nexus himself had been sold several times as soft-vinyl figures by Bandai. Nexus received his own articulated action figure in Tsuburaya's ULTRA-ACT, with the first one is Junis, which released on February 27, 2013 and Junis Blue on July 27, 2013. Junis Blue itself is a remold of the original Junis' figure. Ultraman Noa's figure was released in January 2014 as a P-Bandai exclusive release, with his figure being a remold of Dark Zagi, who was released a month earlier in December 2013.

He was originally an Ultra Warrior of the Land of Light, but his proud nature caused him to try and harness the power of the Land of Light's power source, the Plasma Spark, which led to his banishment and transformation into his current monstrous state after being merged with Alien Raybrad. He was imprisoned by Ultraman King for attempting to invade the Land of Light, but was eventually freed by Alien Zarab many years later and defeated by Ultraman Zero. Ever since then, the two have been archenemies, constantly clashing should they cross paths. Uniquely among other evil Ultras, Belial is the first whose origin is from the Land of Light, like most of the Showa Ultras. In Ultraman Geed, Belial was revealed to have fathered the series namesake Ultraman, who was born from his own genetic material. In Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy and Revenge of Belial, Ultraman Belial was voiced by comedian of the manzai duo Ameagari Kesshitai. Starting from Ultra Zero Fight 2 and so on, he was voiced by . His suit actor was in the first movie and as of Kaiser Belial. Character conception Belial is designed by Masayuki Gotou and Junya Okabe, who used a shark as his motif basis. As for his movements, this was instructed by the director Koichi Sakamoto. Belial's suit was simultaneously made with Ultraman Zero, based on wetsuits with the materials shaped in a three- dimensional appearance. As a result, his body pattern is three-dimensional instead of coloured. The element of wire fu is also included in Belial's actions, and thus two wires were used: up and action. Although the mask was originally moulded integrally with the head, Belial and Zero were structured out of plane. In the original plan, the mask was supposed to have a mouth- opening mechanism but this was removed to better fit the suit actor. In hopes of emphasizing the concept of \\"evil Ultraman\\", his body posture and neck hunch forward. In Ultraman Geed, Koichi Sakamoto regarded the season as Ultraman Belial's final chapter from his first appearance in Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy and is also his first time fighting on Earth. Writer Otsuichi decided to tone down his chimpira-esque trait towards one that is worthy of an evil emperor. Arch Belial as designed by Masayuki Gotou. Other forms are as follows: *Early Style: Belial's original form prior to his corruption, this suit was made by modifying Ultraman Zearth's. *Belyudra: The gigantic chimera monster Belial constructs and 'pilots', made from the inhabitants of the Monster Graveyard. Initially assumed to be CGI, an actual suit was made. The suit is moving one by one to the head, torso, right arm and left arm. After creating a three-dimensional mould, the suit was fully materialised through 3D printing. *Kaiser Belial: The design drawing is based on a photo of Belial's suit. The original draft was meant for Belial to wear a set of armour but due to the lack of improvement, it was reduced to face scar and mantle. Kaiser Belial's suit was modified from the original Belial, where it received new mask and the neck portion modified to better fit the mantle. Under request of director Yuichi Abe, the claws are elongated, forming Kaiser Belial Claws. Suit actor Hiroshi Suenaga mentions that Belial is supposedly to have the calmness of an emperor in contrast to his brutish trait from the last movie. He also complains on how he struggled wearing the Belial Mantle due to weighing about 10 kg. *Arch Belial: It was labelled as during the initial concept. Since the antagonist characters are all robots and humanoid, a monstrous character was proposed. The staffs have troubles in maintaining the suit due to its fragile structure as a result of deciding its appearance late. The design aims to unify the image of Belial by retaining the colouring pattern. Much decoration was made so that its image would not be compared to final villains of past Ultra Series. His designer likewise is also Masayuki Gotou, who previously did for the original Belial and was manufactured by Light Sculpture Studios. *Zero Darkness: This form (or rather, possession) uses the body shape of Ultraman Zero augmented with Belial's colourings. *Chimeraberus: Masayuki designed it to not resemble any of the Monster Capsule component it uses (Zog and Five King), but instead a simplified version of Belyudra. As a differentiation from Arch Belial, Koichi Sakamoto proposes a half-man/beast hybrid themed monster and he also implemented its ability to absorb Ultraman Geed as a frame by frame replication of Alien Rayblood's assimilation with Belial from Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy. *Ultraman Belial Atrocious: Based on the early design of Ultraman Geed, Masayuki chooses a stylish appearance that is closer to normal Ultras, rather than Belial's original hunching position and the skeleton-like detail is designed with three dimensional parts. Instead of grotesque monster forms like Ultraman X and Ultraman Orb proposed, Atrocious was given as a conflict between two Ultras. His fight with Geed on a night scene in episode 25 took cues from that of the heroic Ultra and Skull Gomora from the first episode. =Naming= His name, Belial, is a reference to the similarly named devil in the Judaism and Christianity religions. History =Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy= Long ago, Belial was a powerful Ultra Warrior and a friend to Father and Mother of Ultra in their younger age. After participating in the Great Ultra War, Belial seek inspiration in Alien Empera's army and grew envious to the Father of Ultra's election as the Supreme Commander of the Space Garrison. This jealously tempted Belial to steal energy from the Plasma Spark in hopes of obtaining greater power, only for the energies to inflict him pain in the attempt as he was banished soon after for his selfish act of endangering Planet Ultra. It was then that Belial encounters the spirit of Alien Raybrad, who further corrupted Belial by forcefully entering the Ultraman's body and transforming him. Now an Ultraman Reionics with an army of 100 monsters at his command, Belial orchestrated the to attack the Land of Light until he was defeated by Ultraman King and imprisoned in the while his Giga Battle Nizer was sealed in the Valley of Flames. Belial attacking the Land of Light During the events of Ultra Galaxy, Belial was freed by Alien Zarab, who assumed they can form an alliance before his liberator killed him. Belial fought his way through the numerous Ultramen in the Land of Light to successfully steal the Plasma Spark, turning his homeworld into a frozen wasteland. Belial uses the Plasma Spark's power to revive the Monster Graveyard's residents before being challenged by Ultraman, Ultraseven, and Ultraman Mebius, who brought the Human Reinoics Rei for additional aid. But Belial, learning of their ties as Reinoics, corrupts Rei to attack his comrades until his ZAP Spacy teammates restore his senses. All seemed lost until Ultraman Zero appears and avenges his father Ultraseven by effortlessly defeating the remnants of Belial's army and then Belial himself. But Belial summons the souls of the Monster Graveyard's monsters to join with him to create the gigantic Belyudra with the evil Ultraman as its brain. Belial has Belyudra overpower everyone present until Rei uses hijacked the Giga Battle Nizer to take control of the composing the monsters, leaving Belial as Zero apparently kills him while the others destroy Belyudra. But as the Plasma Spark is restored, it would be revealed that Belial survived. In the English dub, Belial is voiced by Beau Rue Marie. =Ultraman Zero: The Revenge of Belial= Following his defeat at the Monster Graveyard, gaining a large scar from Zero's attempted death blow, Belial established the Belial Galactic Empire under the name Kaiser Belial. His forces based in the hand-like Malebrandes space station, Belial led his army to conquer the planet Esmeralda in another universe to usurp its supplies of emeralds. During that invasion, Belial drove off all resistances while corrupting Esmeralda's protector Mirror Knight and had the whole planet chained to his base, Malebrandes. He also send the mass-produced army of Darklopses, robots based on Zero's specs, to invade Planet Ultra before they are destroyed by the Space Garrison. When Zero (in his human host Run) was captured by Iaron, Belial had his rival imprisoned in his command center and forced him to watch his homeworld invaded while holding his Ultra Zero Eye before Mirror Knight freed him. When Zero regained his Ultraman form, Belial absorbed all of the emeralds he harvested to become Arch Belial, successfully overpowering Zero and holding off against the resistant forces. Setting his sight on Planet Esmeralda, Belial prepared to destroy the planet, but not before Zero and his allies formed an energy shield and died from exhaustion. It was then that the hopes from the resistance brought forth the Shield of Baraj, which transformed into the Ultimate Aegis and for Ultraman Noa to revive Zero. Transforming into Ultimate Zero, the rest of his comrades delay Belial long enough for him to deliver the finishing blow, successfully killing him in the process. In the English dub, he is voiced by Kyle Rea. =Ultra Zero Fight= Ultraman Belial's spirit soon made his way to the Monster Graveyard and possessed Armored Darkness, forming another army called the Darkness Five, consisting of five evil aliens whose races had fought the Ultra Warriors before. After successfully rescuing Pygmon and defeating Sly of the Dark Magic, Zero soon met Armored Darkness, then revealed to be housing Belial and re-dubbed as Kaizer Darkness, fully healed to the point that his previous scar had vanished. When the two archenemies clashed once more, Zero managed to deliver a killing blow, but this was a part of Belial's plan to possess his rival and be reborn as Zero Darkness, using Ultraman Zero's own power to assassinate the Ultimate Force Zero. With victory in his grasp, Belial was about to lead the Darkness Five in a conquest of the whole universe but while attempting to kill a helpless Pygmon, it was then that Zero regained control. Lashing Belial for not being a true Ultra Warrior, Zero expelled the evil Ultra from his body. Revealing a new form, Shining Zero, the gilded warrior reversed time in the immediate area to undo all the damage done by Belial and revived his fallen friends. The Darkness Five soon retreated, but because of Shining Zero, Belial was also revived. Belial resorted to make himself stronger as he led the Darkness Five. =Subsequent history= *Ultraman Retsuden (2011-2013): Belial and the Darkness Five appeared during the 100th episode anniversary of Ultraman Retsuden, hijacking the television program from Ultraman Zero. As a commemoration, Belial tried to narrate all 100 monsters that make up the fusion of Beryudora but because of the time limit, he could only narrate 13 monsters, lashing out at the series for having a short running time. In a similar fashion to Zero, Belial acted as the straight man, often clashing with Glocken of the Freezing in a manner similar to a manzai. Amusingly enough, he also narrated Ultraman Joneus' fight with Red Smog from the 1979 anime Ultra Series The Ultraman and desired to star on his own anime, calling it as . In the 103rd episode, after narrating the episode, Belial took his leave, noting how Zero became stronger due to his desire to protect the weak, resolving to find something that he can protect to become stronger. **Shin Ultraman Retsuden (2013-2016): Belial made his only appearance in episode 49. Upon his arrival and Jathar's return to the Darkness Five, they decided to invade the world of Plasma Soul. This episode marked the promotion for Ultraman Belial and the Darkness Five's availability as playable characters in the digital card game, Mega Monster Rush: Ultra Frontier. During their invasion, the team appeared in a manner of 3D animation. *Ultra Zone (2011): Belyudra appeared in the late night show of the Ultra Series in the second episode as part of a Mansai duo with Giga Khimaira. Later on, it was featured in one of the show's eye catch by decorating the Tokyo Tower a la Christmas tree. *Ultraman Ginga S: Showdown! Ultra 10 Warriors!! (2015): Ultraman Belial was cloned by Etelgar into an and stationed at the fourth floor of his space-time castle. Facing Ultraman Zero, the two fought in an intense battle before Zero used his Mode Changes and finished Belial with Shining Zero's Shining Emerium Slash. *Ultraman Orb (2016): An Ultra Fusion Card of Ultraman Belial was originally in possession of Alien Mefilas Nostra. Jugglus acquired the card after he assassinated Nostra, to which he declared as the . Juggler unsealed Maga-Orochi through Ultraman Belial's card, destroying Zoffy's card in turn and eventually given to Gai/Ultraman Orb alongside Zoffy's card by Tamayura. While Gai has no problems with Zoffy, he was never able to call out Belial's power due to the card's refusal, but Tamayura's sacrifice allowed Gai to use the card in full anger and gave birth to his new form, Thunder Breastar, therefore defeating Maga-Orochi. Usage of this form, however, puts his mind into the state of a berserk, which almost cost the life of Naomi, Gai's friend and caretaker when he faced the robot Galactron which put her life as a hostage. It was not until Gai started to be confident in his powers, not only being able to control the form but also regaining Orb Origin. During the final episode of the series, Belial and the other Ultra Fusion Cards in Gai's possession transform into physical projections of themselves to assist Ultraman Orb in delivering the finishing blow on Magata no Orochi, while Juggler held off the monster long enough to expose its weak spot. In episode 25, he is portrayed by suit actor . *Ultra Fight Orb (2017): Reibatos, a fellow Reionics, tried to revive Belial's original legacy by recreating the Giga Battle Nizer. After surviving Orb's attacks, he tried to revive Belial as a final act of revenge. But Reibatos finds out that the spell is not working and realizes that the evil Ultraman is already alive as Belial, initially appearing as Geed in his Primitive form. Belial quickly killed Reibatos and reclaimed his weapon. =Ultraman Geed= Prior to the series, after killing off Reibatos, Belial battled the Ultramen once more as they developed the Ultra Capsules as a way to fight him before he detonated a Super Dimension Eradication Bomb as a last resort, destroying himself while wiping out the known universe in an event that came to be known as the . But through Ultraman King's intervention, the universe was restored with Belial reduced to an incorporeal state as he takes refuge in a dimensional tear while entrusting the Alien Sturm Kei Fukuide to steal the Ultra Capsules and Risers from Planet Ultra to orchestrate his restoration. To that end, Kei created the Nebula House and used a sample of Belial's DNA to create Riku Asakura as the Sturm's pawn. 19 years later, their plan were put into motion as they orchestrate Riku's transformation into Ultraman Geed (destroying his house and leaving behind a set of Ultra Capsules (among them being the - his own power) and a Riser) and had him collect the Ultra Capsules in hopes of restoring Belial's corporeal form. He also had Kei play the role of the monsters by providing him means of transforming into , a classification of chimeric monsters who bear Belial's . As a result of AIB's investigation, Belial chastised Kei for his failure to secure all eight Capsules from Riku and the vulnerability of exposing their hideout, forcing him to utilize them within his Sturm Organ as Pedanium Zetton. Although Zero managed to seal the entrance to Belial's dimension, he easily escaped sometime later as he raced towards Earth and absorbed Geed as the Belial Fusion Beast Chimeraberus. Belial's attempt to completely absorb his son while winning him over with illusions failed due to Zero, Laiha and King's intervention, allowing Geed to escape, obtain King's Ultra Capsule and destroy Chimeraberus with his new Royal Mega Master form. Despite his apparent death, Belial lived on, having chosen a young woman named Arie Ishikari as his host to keep tabs on Kei until his Sturm Organ was ready for him to take as his own. Abandoning his host and Kei, having incorporated the Sturm Organ into his body to siphon King's essence to use a power source, Belial uses the Dark Lugiel and Alien Empira Monster Capsules to assume his Atrocious form. While his ability to absorb King's power is severed, Belial manages to overwhelm his opposition before Geed manages to drag his father into a dimensional void and, making a final attempt to reason with his father after seeing his memories. Unfortunately as Belial was too focused on his grudges, Geed was forced to kill in a beam struggle. His death in the final episode sealed his fate to remain spiritually trapped in the dimensional void whereas Geed escaped not long after. =Legacy= *Ultraman Geed The Movie (2018): Belial was mentioned in a passing by Airu Higa when explaining the origin of Giga Battle Nizer, which she revealed as a simultaneous/accidental creation by the Kushia People while creating the Giga Finalizer. *Ultraman R/B (2018): Representing the element of darkness, Belial's R/B Crystal was obtained from Planet Sanja by the Ultraman brothers, Rosso and Blu. In addition to its massive power, it was meant to be used with Ultraman Crystal but they failed to realize its power due to their lack of synchronization with their little sister, Saki. She would keep the Crystal for 13 centuries after their deaths and eventually relinquish it to the Minato brothers, which they finally used to combine into Ultraman R/B. *Ultraman R/B The Movie (2019): During his stay in the Minato family's household area, Riku brought up his origin and association to Belial towards Asahi while the latter was questioning her own existence. *Ultra Galaxy Fight: New Generation Heroes (2019): The emotional trauma from being possessed by Belial caused Zero to have his own Darkness Copy modeled after Zero Darkness. The doppelganger exhibits different abilities (Wide Zero Shot and energy bullets) and was defeated by Ultraman R/B, later Zero Beyond after his brief revival by Tregear. *Ultraman Taiga (2019): After Belial's death, his DNA factor had been sold in Villain Guild's black market dealings. An Alien Chibull named Mabuze used Belial's DNA on two occasions, first synthesizing a Skull Gomora with the DNA Factors of a Red King and a Gomora and then using Belial's DNA by itself to creating a clone known as Imit-Ultraman Belial. *Ultraman Z (2020): Because of his wounds from sustaining various fights in the past, several of Belial's remains scattered into in various dimensions, turning monsters into rampant while Celebro used them for his own ends. On Earth, the Celebro-possessed Kaburagi used Riku's DNA and the Devil Splinter to forge an , allowing him to assume a Belial Fusion Monster to his liking. After giving the Medal to Haruki, Ultraman Z would gain access to Delta Rise Claw, a form which uses some of Belial's powers.

The building is currently (February 2017) being used as a used car lot. As of January 2019 work has stalled on its renovation. According to a source the restaurant is supposed to open in mid-February 2019.  History  This is an excellent example of a picturesquely conceived interwar road house, designed in a medieval idiom. The architect, A. E. Sewell, was Truman's in-house architect. Plans dated October 1929 were approved in November 1929. The building, located opposite Edgware parish church, is a notable interwar feature of what was to become one of the classic suburbs in Greater London. It exemplifies the modern idea of wayside hospitality, as revised for motor car-borne trade (viz the large car park to rear), but expressed in a highly romanticized style. It is among the best examples of a picturesque historicist road-house in the country. The historic building closed in 2006 after, apparently, not reaching health and safety standards.  Damage and uncertainty  Through the 2010s there were several owners, none making any significant progress. In 2016 an arson attack left a portion of the ground floor destroyed and the public began to fear developers would build new apartments after a lack of support from the council. A petition was launched in 2016 to Historic England in an attempt to try and restore the building and received 2,287 signatures. In early 2018 it was sold for ¬£2 Million and the outside was used as a car wash and coach stop point, causing upset online.  Renovation  In September 2018 it was announced that it was to be renovated and turned into a restaurant. Work on this is currently underway.

The most famous ancient example of such an order is the Colosseum at Rome, which had no less than four storeys of superposed orders. The superposition rules were developed in ancient Greece and were also actively used in the architecture of ancient Rome. Later, the order was used in the architecture of the Renaissance and Baroque. Composition The heaviest orders are at the bottom of a building, whilst the lightest come at the top. This rule means that the Doric order is a preferred order for the ground floor, the Ionic order is used for the middle storey, while the Corinthian or the Composite order is used for the top storey. The ground floor may also have rustication. Initially, the top story usually featured the Composite order, but, after Vincenzo Scamozzi published his treatise L'idea dell'architettura universale (The Idea of a Universal Architecture) (Venice, 1615), architects switched to the Corinthian order. The superposed order allowed storeys without columns, but rearrangement of order styles was strictly forbidden.

Biography  Whinyates was the son of Major Thomas Whinyates of Abbotsleigh, Devon, and his wife Katharine Frankland, and was educated at Newcombe's School in Hackney. In 1796 he entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich as a cadet and was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 1 March 1798. He became lieutenant in 1799 and accompanied the expedition in that year to Den Helder in the Netherlands and the expedition to Madeira in 1801. When Madeira was evacuated at the Peace of Amiens, he went with his company to Jamaica and was made adjutant. In 1805 he was promoted second captain and came home. He served as adjutant to the artillery in the attack on Copenhagen in 1807 and the following year was posted to D troop of the Royal Horse Artillery. In February 1810 he embarked with his unit for the Peninsula, but their transport ship Camilla nearly sank and had to put back. Owing to this, D troop did not take the field as a unit until 1811. However, Whinyates was present at Busaco in 1810, acting as adjutant to the officer commanding the artillery. He was also at the Battle of Albuera on 16 May 1811 with four guns, the cavalry affair at Usagre on 25 May, and in the actions at Fuentes de Guinaldo and Aldea de Ponte on 25 and 27 Sep In 1812 D troop was with Rowland Hill's corps on the Tagus river. At Ribera, Whinyates made such good use of two guns that the French commander Lallemand inquired his name, and sent him a message: ‚ÄòTell that brave man that if it had not been for him, I should have beaten your cavalry‚Äô. When the captain of D troop died at Madrid in October Whinyates took over the command for the next four months, during which time the troop distinguished itself at San Mu√±oz on 17 November, at the close of the retreat from Burgos, five out of its six guns being injured. General Long, who commanded the cavalry to which it was attached, afterwards wrote of the troop that he had never witnessed 'more exemplary conduct in quarters, nor more distinguished zeal and gallantry in the field.‚Äô In 1813 Whinyates was made captain, and consequently left the Peninsula in March. In 1814 he was appointed to the second rocket troop, and he commanded it at Waterloo. Wellington, who did not believe in rockets, ordered that they should be left behind. When he was told that this would break Whinyates's heart, he replied: ‚ÄòDamn his heart; let my orders be obeyed.‚Äô However, Whinyates eventually obtained leave to bring them into the field, together with his six guns. When Ponsonby's brigade charged D'Erlon's corps, he followed it with his rocket sections, and fired several volleys of ground-rockets with good effect against the French cavalry. He then rejoined his guns, which were placed in front of Picton's division. In the course of the day he had three horses shot under him, was struck on the leg, and severely wounded in the left arm. He received a brevet majority and the Waterloo medal, and afterwards the Peninsular silver medal with clasps for Busaco and Albuera. At the end of 1815, the rocket troop were sent to England to be reduced, and Whinyates remained behind until 1818, appointed to a troop of drivers in the army of occupation. He commanded H troop of horse artillery from 1823 to 22 July 1830, when he became regimental lieutenant-colonel and was made KH in 1823 and CB in 1831. He had command of the horse artillery at Woolwich from November 1834 to May 1840, and of the artillery in the northern district for eleven years afterwards, having become regimental colonel on 23 November 1841. On 1 April 1852 he was appointed director-general of artillery, and on 19 August commandant at Woolwich, where he remained till 1 June 1856. He had been promoted major-general on 20 June 1854, and became lieutenant- general on 7 June 1856, and general on 10 December 1864. He was elevated to KCB on 18 May 1860. He had become colonel-commandant of a battalion on 1 April 1855, and was transferred to the horse artillery on 22 July 1864. He died at Cheltenham on 25 December 1865. In 1827 he had married Elizabeth, only daughter of Samuel Compton of Wood End, North Riding, Yorkshire but left no children. He did have five brothers, of whom four served with distinction in the army and navy.

As a signatory of the Boxer Protocol, the final act at the Algeciras Conference and the Colonial Charter in which Congo Free State was ceded to Belgium, Joostens was an important Belgian diplomat in the age of New Imperialism. Throughout his career, Joostens was able to gain the absolute confidence of king Leopold II of Belgium and eventually he became one of the monarch's favourite diplomats.  Background  Maurice Joostens was born in one of the richest and most prominent families of the Belgian city of Antwerp. The wealth and influence of the Joostens family had, according to the legend, their origins in a lucky investment that Mathias Joostens had made during the age of Napoleon Bonaparte. He accidentally put an extra '0' on an order and bought 5,000 instead of 500 bales of coffee. Because of inflation during the Continental Blockade he suddenly had a fortune in his hands and was no longer a modest merchant. This story even inspired Hendrik Conscience to fictionalize this anecdote and write the book Eene 0 te veel. The family was subsequently able to rise among the ranks of the Antwerp bourgeoisie and Maurice Joostens his grandfather Constantin Joostens became a senator for the Belgian Liberal Party. Besides from the influence and capital of his family Joostens had also other assets to become a diplomat. His trip to Egypt with his influential uncle Arthur Van Den Nest in 1882 and Joostens orientalist report Du Caire au Tropique are for example prime examples of his fascination for foreign countries. In the meantime Joostens had completed his studies at the University of Paris, the University of Leuven and the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles and he obtained his degree in arts. Before he pursued a career in the diplomacy, Joostens shortly followed in the footsteps of his father being active in the Antwerp banking scene where he had a job at the Handelsbank.  Diplomatic career  = Early career = On 7 December 1885, Joostens filed his request at the Belgian ministry for foreign affairs to become a so-called attach√© de l√©gation and this was the start of his diplomatic career. First, he was, from April 1886 until January 1889, the second-class secretary at the legation in Madrid, then headed by Edouard Anspach, the brother of Jules Anspach. In 1889, Joostens made promotion to the legation in Cairo, where he served the Belgian imperial interests of, for example, √âdouard Empain and the Tramways d'Alexandrie. Shortly after his displacement to Egypt, Joostens was again promoted. This time he became first-class secretary in the highly ranked legation in London. There he could further develop his diplomatic skills both on the European and the imperial diplomatic theatre. = Washington D.C. = As a result of an internal reorganisation in the Belgian diplomatic corps, Joostens was able to further develop his career. The new minister for foreign affairs Paul de Favereau promoted him in 1896 to Washington D.C. where he would be the new conseiller de la l√©gation or advisor of the legation. Under the auspices of Gontran de Lichtervelde Joostens showed remarkable diplomatic skill. In 1898 the Belgian the then prince Albert of Belgium made a visit to the United States together with his physician L. Melis and Harry Jungbluth. For this occasion Joostens was named the diplomatic attach√© to this group. This was because of the commercial and imperialist agenda of this voyage, not only was Alberts visit a way for the future king to learn the country better, his uncle Leopold II of Belgium saw in this trip a great opportunity to tighten the Belgian-American relations on the imperialistic scene. By order of Leopold II, Joostens used the allure of the royal visit to attract investors for a Belgian-American cooperation to build the Beijing‚ÄìHankou Railway. It was in this context that Joostens had several contacts with the American senator Calvin S. Brice who to Joostens his great regret died during the American- Belgian negotiations. Although he didn't succeed to forge a cooperation between the American China Development Company and the Belgian investments backed by Leopold II, Joostens was able to show his feel for the diplomatic game in this episode and obtain the appreciation of the king. Next to the royal visit of prince Albert and the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the remarkable plan to make the Philippines a Belgian protectorate after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War was a third case in which Joostens was active. = The Hague = During his holidays in Belgium recovering from an uninterrupted three years stay in the United States, Joostens was named secretary for the Belgian delegation for the Hague Peace Conference of 1899. This conference was an initiative of the Russian Tsar Nicolas II and is one of the prime examples of pacifism in the eve of the First World War. During this conference Joostens could gain more experience in the field of international relations under the guidance of delegation leader and well-known disarmament advocate Auguste Beernaert. The latter would even win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1909 for his presence at The Hague Conventions. = Peking =  Arrival  Only fourteen years after his first application at the Belgian ministry of foreign affairs, Joostens was promoted in the winter of 1899 to the rank of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the court of the Chinese emperor and the king of Siam. When Joostens arrived in Peking to replace baron Carl de Vinck de Deux-Orp, he ended up in the so-called Legation Quarter. This was the diplomatic compound south of the Forbidden City where all the foreign legations were situated and in which there was a very distinctive diplomatic culture with its own practices and rules. In this context, Joostens could rely on a competent team of Belgian lower-ranking diplomats and officials. The most remarkable members of the Belgian legation in this time were, for example, Alphonse Splingaerd, son of the Belgian Mandarin Paul Splingaerd, Leopold Merghelynck and Emile de Cartier de Marchienne, who would become the Belgian ambassador to both China and the United States.  Boxer Rebellion and the Siege of the International Legations  The location of the Belgian Legation in the Legation Quarter during the Siege of the International Legations in the summer of 1900. Shortly after Joostens' arrival, the Boxer Rebellion, of which the first features showed in the winter of 1899, would reach its peak. This rebellion had anti- foreign, anti-Christian and mystical features and had among other things its origins in a crop failure in 1899, decades of frustrations about the Western presence in China and the chaos and internal struggles at the Chinese court following the failed Hundred Days' Reform. The wrath of the rebels was first aimed at Chinese Christians but later faced towards the foreign presence in China. Since the Belgians were not unlike the other foreign investments deemed unwanted elements in the Chinese society, the Beijing-Hankou Railway was also attacked and several Belgian engineers, missionaries and officials were killed. During the first quarrels in the streets of the Legation Quarters Joostens was accused of having killed several rebels, but since the Austro- Hungarian government offered to protect the Belgian legation, it is more likely that these soldiers have fired these shots. After the assassination of the German envoy Klemens von Ketteler near the Belgian legation and the refusal of the foreign diplomats to leave the Legation Quarter after Empress Dowager Cixi ordered them to do so, the rebellion reached a turning point. From now on, the Chinese Empire was at war with the foreign countries, and in this context, Joostens had to defend from 13 June until 16 June 1900, together with the other Belgians and the Austro-Hungarian marines, the Belgian legation. Despite their efforts, they were not able to repel the rebels and had to retreat to first the French and later the British legation. In the meantime, the Belgian legation, which was located in an isolated corner in the Legation Quarter, was plundered and set on fire. On 20 June 1901, the rebels sieged, in collaboration with Imperial Chinese Army, the Legation Quarter and with this act the so-called Siege of the International Legations was put in place. Shortly after the rebels sieged the Legation Quarter, the foreign powers gathered their forces and formed the Eight-Nation Alliance to crush the rebellion '. Leopold II had also been very keen to participate and even privately funded a Belgian Expeditionary Corps but Kaiser Wilhelm II strongly opposed this idea and the king had to give up this plan.  Conference of Peking  Maurice Joostens, fourth from the right, during the signing of the Boxer Protocol on 7 September 1901 When Peking was relieved on 14 August 1901 by the Eight-Nation Alliance, the Boxer Rebellion came to an end, but this meant by no means the end of instability in China. Nevertheless, both the foreign powers ( France, Germany, Japan, United States, United Kingdom, Russia, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands and Spain) and the pro-foreign officials at the Chinese court such as Li Hongzhang and Yikuang (Prince Qing) wanted to reach a settlement over the Chinese responsibility in the rebellion. The negotiations that took place in this context, between 26 October 1900 and 7 September 1901, are known as the Conference of Peking and they would among other things focus on the indemnities on the one hand and the punishment of the leaders of the rebellion on the other hand. Although Ernest Mason Satow and Alfons Mumm von Schwarzenstein, respectively the British and German envoy, preferred from the start on that only the members of the Eight- Nation Alliance settled these matters, Joostens succeeded to conquer his place at the negotiation table. He was able to do so thanks to his active role since the first meeting on 26 October 1900 and the support of French envoy Stephen Pichon. From then on, Joostens nevertheless was not able to have strong voice. This was a result of the small state position of Belgium because of the lack of military input in the Eight-Nation Alliance, a reflection of the quite unimportant status of Belgium in Europe and the omnipresent influence of his minister for foreign affairs Paul de Favereau. Although Joostens was not seen as one of the most important envoys present, the lack of cooperation between the different nations offered the possibility to have a certain influence. The Belgian envoy was for example the chairman of the Committee on the Indemnities and inspired by the losses of the Societ√© d‚Äô√âtude de chemins de fer en Chine, the Belgian company behind the Beijing-Hankou Railway, he proposed to include also indirect losses of companies and societies in the indemnity claims. Next to that, Joostens also persuaded his colleagues to lower the proposed embargo on the trade and production of arms to a span of only two years and by doing so, he favoured the interests of FN Herstal and the Belgian arms factories in general. The most important contribution of Joostens from a Belgian perspective was his role in the compilation of the Belgian indemnities. Cooperating very closely with Paul de Favereau Joostens was active in almost every aspect of this task. He verified the indemnity claims, he communicated and negotiated with the French envoys and Stephen Pichon about the indemnities of Beijing-Hankou Railway and questioned the claims of other countries in order to safeguard the payment of the Belgian claims. Other projects in which Joostens was involved were, for example, the plan to invite Zaifeng, Prince Chun for a visit to Belgium. Since the prince proposed this visit himself, he accepted the offer but when he was in Germany to convey his regrets to the Kaiser Empress Dowager Cixi became ill and the prince had to cancel the rest of his trip to Europe. Joostens was also very active to claim the right to install the Belgian Legation Guard in Peking. Belgian boots on Chinese soil offered in Joostens' eyes a big potential, but since the Belgian Legation Guard only consisted of about 20 soldiers, the guard can't possibly be seen as the fulfillment of Leopold II his military ambitions in China. Joostens diplomacy during the Conference is at best summarized as an execution of the orders of his minister Paul de Favereau with the addition of personal initiatives within a typical Leopoldistic imperial mindset.  Other activities  The Belgian concession in Tientsin (yellow) along the Pei Ho River In the margin of the Conference of Peking, Joostens was also active in other cases. In cooperation with Henri Ketels, the consul in Tientsin, Joostens succeeded to claim a Belgian concession in Tientsin. Despite the failed development of this concession because of a lack of interest from Belgian investors, Joostens succeeded to obtain this parcel despite the criticism of the other powers. Besides from this territorial achievement, Joostens also kept playing his role in the cases of finances and more specifically the indemnities. Even after the signature of the Boxer Protocol, the payment of the indemnities was still an unsolved problem and in this context Joostens tried to convince his government not to found a Belgian bank. In Joostens' opinion the Chinese indemnities for Belgium could also be paid to a foreign bank and subsequently be transferred to an already existing Belgian bank in Europe. Nevertheless, the Belgian government did found a Sino-Belgian Bank. A third important aspect of Joostens' diplomacy in China aimed at protecting the Belgian missionaries. Although the Belgian missionaries officially were French citizens as a result of the French Protectorate in China, Joostens repeatedly defended the rights of the missionaries of Belgian origin. He checked reports of attacks on Belgian manned missions and urged the Chinese government to repel the attacks of what used to be Boxer rebels. Finally Joostens also acted as a spokesman of the Belgian imperial lobby. Both in China and Belgium, he promoted several times the Belgian project. On several occasions Joostens highlighted for example the prospects of an investment in China and tried to convince investors and ordinary people to come to China and work in Belgian companies or invest in them. Despite the efforts of Joostens and other Belgian officials the Belgian presence would never be able to match the success of the pre-war era. The Boxer Rebellion had showed that an investment in China could be risky and from 1901 onwards the interest of Belgian investors further diminished.  Aftermath  left Thanks to fact that Joostens was one of the diplomats who were sieged in the summer of 1900, the Belgian envoy became a prominent and well-known figure not only within diplomatic circles, but also within the public sphere. Whereas stories like these were not available in the European press before, the development of the press as a mass medium throughout the nineteenth century had made possible that the messages concerning the Siege of the International Legations reached big audiences in the western world. Where diplomats were often depicted as lazy, money spoiling and useless bureaucrats, the siege had pointed out the dangers and usefulness of the job. Nevertheless, the coverage of Joostens in Belgian and international press was quite one-sided and although some media covered also the diplomatic work of the Belgian envoy, the main focus was put on his role during the siege. Joostens remarkable performance at the Conference of Peking did not pass unnoticed at the Belgian royal court. In 1904 Leopold II gave Joostens the hereditary title of baron as a final reward for his time in Peking. This focus on his own person enabled Joostens to use this attention to put the Belgian expansion on the agenda of the Belgian economic scene as pointed out before. On the other hand, the attention for Joostens also played a great part in the awareness of the Belgian presence in China and raised the tangibility of the project for a great deal of people who had never heard of the activities of the Belgian missionaries, Belgian investors and Belgian diplomats before. Finally the different receptions, dinners and ceremonies celebrating Joostens' return to Belgium tightened to bonds within the Belgian imperialist lobby. Since diplomats usually hided behind the curtains of diplomacy Joostens' public performance is very noteworthy. Although Joostens' residence in Peking was undoubtedly the most important and notable time in his career, it had also its side-effects. Because of the harsh living conditions in Peking, Joostens unstable health fastly declined and in 1904 an emotionally and physically weak Joostens finally got the displacement he had been asking for since 1902. Being appointed as the envoy in Madrid Joostens was for the first time in his career promoted to be the highest-ranking official in a legation of a traditional European power. Since the living conditions in such a wealthy city were far better than in Peking the promotion took Joostens wishes into account. = Madrid = The first years of Joostens' stay in Spain were characterized by a focus on the improvement of the Belgian-Spanish economic relations. Joostens was for example very active in the preparations of the Spanish pavilion at the world's fair in Li√®ge in 1905. During his Spanish years, Joostens would also be again in the center of the imperialist world theater. Spain was after all an important imperial power and the neighbourhood of Morocco posed both a lot of opportunities and problems. Joostens was first active in the Belgian imperialist penetration of Morocco through the establishment of Belgian companies in the country. Following the First Moroccan Crisis Joostens was appointed by Leopold II to attend the Algeciras Conference together with . The international meeting was installed to figure out a solution for the German contestation of the growing French and Spanish control over Morocco. Leopold II told Joostens that he was not allowed to gain any profits for Belgium at the conference and Joostens loyally followed these orders. = End of career = As showed before Joostens was as a Belgian envoy in Madrid still very active in the imperialist schemes of Leopold II. The king even appointed him during his yearly holidays in Belgium as a member of the diplomatic team that had to negotiate the transfer of Congo Free State to Belgium. After the Congo Free State propaganda war led by Edmund Dene Morel had pointed out the atrocities in the king's private country in Africa, Leopold II could no longer resist or repel the criticism and he prepared to hand the Congo over to the Belgian state. In this context Joostens was one of the architects of the Colonial Charter that settled this matter. Joostens' role in this transition from a royal Belgian colonial empire towards a Belgian state-led colonialism would be his last achievement of importance. In his last years in the legation in Madrid, Joostens' health would further decline. When on a leave to recover in Belgium in 1910, Joostens died on 21 July, Belgium's national holiday, suffering from a heart stroke despite the fact that his sister Alice had been taking care of him for several weeks.

In 1909 graduated from the Working Man's College (now Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) with the highest marks in Mechanical Engineering. He then undertook a 5-year apprenticeship with Anderson and Son, an engineering firm in Richmond, Melbourne. From February 1916 to June 1919 in World War I, he served in the Australian Flying Corps and, on loan, in the Royal Flying Corps, mostly in the Middle East.

Around this time he reverted to the traditional Scottish spelling of his surname Baird. In the early years of Qantas they constructed their own aircraft and Baird supervised the construction of seven DH-50 airliners and a DH-9. As Qantas grew, Baird became responsible for their engineering work at Archerfield Airport in Brisbane and the seaplanes at Rose Bay in Sydney. Baird assisted the Rev.

Ferrari took their advice and started to use the black Prancing Horse on a yellow background (yellow being one of the colours of the city flag of his native Modena) as the official Ferrari logo. Initially, all Scuderia Ferrari's cars were manufactured by Alfa Romeo, but after the foundation of Auto Avio Costruzioni (later known as \\"Ferrari\\"), Ferrari began to use his Ferrari cars. Uses The Prancing Horse is used as part of Ferrari and Scuderia Ferrari logos, on tifosi's flags and as a Ferrari symbol.

Portrayed by comedian Grant Lobban, Damo first appeared over several years in a guest role before becoming a regular character in 2017. Primarily written as comic relief, Damo has also featured in storylines such as his diagnosis of bowel cancer. Creation and casting The character of Damo was created for a one-off guest appearance in 2015, with comedian Grant Lobban securing the role. He knew the role was short term so believed, \\"I'm going to give it everything I've got and play with it and be this big dorky guy', so I just went for it really.\\" His performance lead to Damo being written into further episodes, in a \\"on and off\\" basis before returning as a full-time character in 2017. Lobban was pleased to have a regular role in Damo and hoped for it to be permanent, stating, \\"I'd love it to continue.\\" Storylines Damo first arrived to the hospital when he purchased Kylie Brown's (Kerry-Lee Dewing) dress online believing it to instead be a date and resulting in him being rebuffed. Damo later appeared when as Head of the IT department, he vindictively changed hospital CEO Chris Warner (Michael Galvin) passwords before backing down after mistakingly believing Chris' best friend Mo (Jarrod Rawiri) was a gang member. Several months later Damo moved into Esther Samuels (Ngahuia Piripi), Lucy Rickman (Grace Palmer) and Ali Karim's (Tane Williams) flat and confused many with his strange hobbies and quest for love. Damo clashed dramatically with elder hospital receptionist Leanne Black (Jennifer Ludlam) especially when she received a promotion, making him accountable to her. Leanne set up Damo with a patient's daughter Erin (Kayleigh Haworth) but following her mother's death, she left Damo. After months of connecting through shared loneliness, Damo realised he was in love with Leanne and despite her reservations, she too fell in love and the two became a secret couple. The relationship was short lived when Damo pushed a pregnant Lucy during an earthquake but came round to eventually loving her child when Lucy died from childbirth, making him want to father a child himself. The return of Erin saw her relationship with Damo rekindle much to Leanne's jealousy, leading to her spitefully revealing Erin was unable to have children. However it soon became apparent Erin was psychotic when she kidnapped Damo and attacked both Ali and Leanne. This resulted in Damo and Leanne reuniting and committing to raising a child together eventually. Whilst Leanne was overseas, Damo was shocked to be diagnosed with bowel cancer and eventually opted to have surgery, removing the disease. Erin soon returned to Ferndale and revealed her pregnancy to Damo, and a custody arrangement was organised where their son, Donny would spend time with Damo and Leanne. Damo shocked Drew McCaskill (Ben Barrington) when he revealed he was secretly very wealthy and bought into co-ownership of the IV Bar. Damo and Leanne got engaged in 2019 but briefly separated when considering retirement home living. The two exchanged vowels in an unofficial ceremony dressed in the couple's favourite fantasy roleplaying characters in their IV bar courtyard. However when Damo lost the bar gambling, and Leanne's first-love Willy Marsh (Jim Moriarty) confessed his love to her, the couple broke up and Leanne fled New Zealand. Whilst trying to stop an armed robbery, Damo was shot and required a liver transplant. Drew volunteered and during Damo's subsequent recovery, he started a relationship with Leanne's rival Desdemona Schmitt (Kura Forrester). Leanne returned several months later and confessed her love for Damo, but he announced that he had moved on. Following the death of his father, Damo underwent severe depressive episodes and suffered suicidal thoughts. Leanne helped him through and he used his newfound understanding of loss to help Louis King (Henry Rolleston) when he too lost his father. Character development =Characterisation= The New Zealand TV Guide described the character as \\"socially awkward, over-confident and unlucky-in-love\\". Damo was written as primarily a comic relief character which pleased Lobban who came from a comedy background, describing Damo as \\"the clown\\". He believed \\"The comedy is very natural to me\\", and had no dramatic training leading him to think that, \\"With comedy you can do anything and it doesn't have to be believable, just funny, whereas serious subjects ... you are quite conscious of making it look as real as possible.\\" Co-star Luke Patrick (Frank Warner coached Lobban to act out Damo's dramatic scenes. Damo was said to be a \\"coward\\" after a storyline saw him push a pregnant Lucy Rickman (Grace Palmer) during an earthquake, something Lobban said proved the difference between himself and his character, \\"I know I am not Damo, I just didn't feel comfortable being this coward.\\" =Bowel cancer= In an attempt to raise awareness of startling bowel cancer diagnosis rates in New Zealand, advertising agency TBWA approached Television New Zealand to feature a storyline that saw the cancer affect one of the characters. It was decided that the character of Damo would undergo the cancer storyline due to the belief from the campaigns Chief Executive that, \\"Working with such a well- loved character gave people a reason to care: it means a huge portion of the population now has a friend who has experienced bowel cancer. That provided great traction we can draw upon to educate Kiwis about this disease, which affects so people, but which still flies under the radar.\\" It was believed that the comedic nature of the Damo character would be a suitable medium to convey the wide-reaching nature of the cancer and Lobban believed Damo was an obvious target for such a disease as, \\"He's an unhealthy eater. He's always got those junk-food wrappers on his desk. He's just an unhealthy, disgusting guy.\\" Over a three-week period, Damo was shown to undergo the symptoms of bowel cancer, but actively ignore them and turn them into \\"toilet-humour\\" based jokes. Bowel Cancer New Zealand actively consulted Shortland Street on how best to portray the symptoms, testing, diagnosis, surgery, and aftermath. The episodes were also accompanied by warning's suggesting the \\"disease could strike anyone\\". Lobban enjoyed the storyline and thought overall that the, \\"message, of course, being check yourself early and you can survive these things.\\" Reception Damo was hugely popular with the public, and critics alike. His first appearances were well received online with Shorty Street Scandal satirically named Damo and Kylie as the \\"Hookup of the week\\". The Spinoff writer Tara Ward gave him the \\"Shortland Street power ranking\\" of number 1 of the week, calling the character \\"batshit crazy\\" and suggesting the show was better for it. She concluded her review by suggesting, \\"Damo for Prime Minister\\". The character of Damo was so popular, he was purposefully chosen to undertake his prostate cancer storyline as it was believed this would be the most effective measure to impact such an issue to the audience. Lobban was not prepared for the amount of affection audiences would have for his character and noted one particular incident where he thought he was going to be assaulted by a motorbike driver but was instead unexpectedly applauded for his portrayal. Lobban's co-star Tane Williams (Ali Karim) praised Damo as \\"just ridiculous\\" and thought working with the actor was, \\"just so crazy that it's hard to stay in the scene and hold it together when they are cracking some of their ridiculous jokes.\\" References Shortland Street characters Television characters introduced in 2015 Male characters in television ","title":"Damo Johnson"},{"id":"51451642","title":"Naamkarann"},{"id":"51451643","text":"Josefa Kellner (born 12 March 1891, date of death unknown) was an Austrian swimmer.

Early life Angus Roy Mackay, 9th of Strathnaver, was the eldest son of Neil Mackay, 8th of Strathnaver, and his wife who was a daughter of George Munro, 10th Baron of Foulis, chief of Clan Munro. His maternal grandmother, through Munro of Foulis, was a daughter of Ross of Balnagown, chief of Clan Ross. The blood feud that had raged since 1370 between the Clan Mackay and the Clan Sutherland had become assuaged, so much so that one of Angus Roy Mackay's daughters married Sutherland of Dirlot. Feud with the Clan Gunn Map showing the Mackay chief's territory of Strathnaver in relation to Caithness, Sutherland and Ross to the south The Keiths who lived in Caithness were akin to the Sutherlands of Dirlot, both families having obtained their lands in Caithness through marriage with daughters of Reginald Cheyne (of Clan Cheyne). According to historian Angus Mackay, it is probable that the chief of Clan Gunn, who was a man of great power and the Crowner of Caithness, resented the intrusion of the Keiths who were newcomers to the area. The Clan Keith of Aberdeenshire had great influence at court through their chief, the Earl Marischal. In Caithness relations became so hostile that the Keiths were determined to crush the Gunns if possible. According to Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet, the Keiths \\"mistrusting\\" their own forces \\"sent to Angus Mackay entreating him to come to their aid\\", which he did.Mackay, Angus. (1906). The Book of Mackay. pp. 67. Quoting: Gordon, Sir Robert, A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland. According to historian Angus Mackay it is not known exactly why Mackay chose to support the Keiths, but it could have been partly because of the prospect of plunder, but also because at the time Sir Gilbert Keith of Inverguie was collector of customs for Caithness, Strathnaver and Sutherland, and in this function might have crossed the Gunns and befriended the Mackays, securing Mackay's help. As such in 1464 Angus Roy Mackay advanced on Caithness where the Battle of Tannach took place. The Mackays were joined by the Keiths and the MacLeods of Assynt. The Gunns were defeated being overwhelmed by numbers, but not without great slaughter on both sides. Soon after this the Keiths massacred the Gunn chief and some his sons in what is now known as the Battle of Champions. The Parliament of 1478 took measures to end the blood- shed in Ross, Sutherland and Caithness. Feud with the Clan Ross A feud later broke out with the Clan Ross whose chiefs were the Rosses of Balnagown Castle. According to the Blackcastle MS (which was written by Alexander Mackay of Blackcastle who had access to the Mackay chief's family charters and papers) the Rosses had made \\"a predatory incursion\\" into the territory of the Mackays. Sir Robert Gordon however says that the Mackays \\"often molested with incursions and invasions\\" the lands of the Rosses.Mackay, Angus. (1906). The Book of Mackay. pp. 68. Quoting: Gordon, Sir Robert, A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland. According to historian Angus Mackay the evidence is ample that the Mackays managed to recover some of the lands in Ross-shire that had belonged to their relatives and enemies, Neil Neilson Mackay, his brother Morgan Neilson Mackay and Neil and Morgan's father-in-law Murray of Cubin, all three of whom had been defeated and killed by the Mackays of Strathnaver at the Battle of Drumnacoub in 1433. The evidence is also ample that the Rosses managed to secure some of these lands lying in the parishes of Edderton and Kincardine in Ross-shire. So it appears that the feud between the Mackays and the Rosses arose out of a scramble for disputed lands. Angus Roy Mackay having made various expeditions into Ross was at last overpowered in what is now known as the Battle of Tarbat, and taking refuge in the church of Tarbat which was set on fire, he was burnt to death in 1486. Family Angus Roy Mackay married a daughter of Mackenzie of Kintail, chief of Clan Mackenzie and had the following children: #Iye Roy Mackay, 10th of Strathnaver, successor as chief of the Clan Mackay. #John Rivach Mackay, who led the Mackays to avenge his father's death and defeated the Rosses at the Battle of Aldy Charrish in 1487 where the Ross chief was killed. However, John Rivach Mackay himself was killed in 1513 fighting the English at the Battle of Flodden. #A daughter who married Hector Mackenzie of Auchterned, son of Hector Roy Mackenzie of Gairloch. #A daughter who married Sutherland of Dirlot.

Biography  Lenglet Du Fresnoy first studied theology but quickly left it for diplomacy and politics. In 1705, Jean-Baptiste Colbert de Torcy appointed him Secretary for Latin and French languages to the Elector of Cologne, who lived in Lille. During the Regence, he returned to Paris and in 1718 the Regent took advantage of his skill to discover the accomplices of the Cellamare Conspiracy. Afterwards Lenglet occupied himself only of his scholarly work and refused all offers made to him in France or abroad. Biting and sarcastic, he had many enemies, of which he derived vanity, saying: I want to be a frank Gaul in my style, as in my actions. His love of independence and opposition to royal censors earned him, under Louis XV, five periods of imprisonment in the Bastille, once in the another time in the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes. He died at almost 82 years after falling in the fireplace close to which he was reading. He was buried in the church or in the cemetery of the √âglise Saint-S√©verin in Paris. Lenglet, whose books contain treasures of erudition, was interested both in literary criticism as in hermetic philosophy, history or geography. He also edited the Roman de la Rose, Marot, Sigogne, R√©gnier, Motin, Berthelot, Maynard, La Henriade by Voltaire, M√©moires by Philippe de Comines, Pierre de L'Estoile, etc. He reviewed articles on history and even wrote some in full for the Encyclop√©die by Diderot and D‚ÄôAlembert. He wrote under the pseudonyms \\"Edward Melton\\", \\"Albert Van Heussen\\", \\"C. Gordon de Percel\\" and \\"Gosford\\". He also wrote in Latin under the pen name \\"Lengletius\\".

Under her leadership, the ' (KAD; Women Workers' Union of Denmark) gained prominence as agreements resulted from effective strike action. In 1901, the organization gained national status as the KAD, which Nielsen chaired until her death in 1910. Biography Born in Helsing√∏r on 7 June 1873, Nielsen was the daughter of J√∏rgen Christensen, a farmhand, and his wife Anne Marie Olsdatter. Brought up in a working-class environment, she married the factory worker Oluf Nielsen when she was 20 and already pregnant. She went on to have nine children, two of whom died in infancy. In order to provide for the children, Nielsen was forced to work in Helsing√∏r, probably as a laundress. In the 1880s, the family moved to Copenhagen where it was easier to find work. Union work In Copenhagen, Nielsen became associated with the Kvindeligt Arbejderforbund (KAF) which was founded in 1885 as a union for cleaners and washerwomen and from 1890 for women industrial workers. In 1891, Nielsen became a member of the union's steering committee and in 1892 its president. She introduced a more structured approach with monthly meetings and membership fees, resolving the association's financial problems. Over the following years, she arranged information meetings with prominent speakers, including Johanne Meyer of the Kvindelig Fremskridtsforening (Women's Progressive Society) and M.C. Lyngsie, head of the working men's organization Arbejdsm√¶ndenes Forbund. As a result, women joined from various branches of industry such as breweries, printing works, ropemaking and cable factories. The KAF's first successful wage agreement was concluded in 1986 with the Tuborg Breweries but negotiations with Jacob Holm og S√∏nners Reberbane, a ropeworks, proved more difficult. After a seven-week strike and a court case for the KAF's defamatory press articles, there was nevertheless a settlement. In the late 1890s, provincial branches of the KAF were established in Randers, Svendborg, N√¶stved and K√∏ge. By 1900, the organization had around 1,000 members. This led in 1901 to the launching of the Danish Women Workers' Union (KAD), the first formal national trade union for women in the country. Nielsen served as secretary general of the KAD while maintaining leadership of its Copenhagen branch. By the time of her death in 1910, KAD membership had increased to 2,000. Nielsen also served as a council member of De samvirkende Fagforbund (Federation of Danish Trade Unions) established in 1898, becoming a member of the executive committee in 1909. Politics Nielsen was a supporter of the Socialdemokratiske arbejderbev√¶gelse (Social Democratic Workers Movement), addressing a May Day demonstration in Copenhagen in 1899 together with Andrea Brochman leader of De kvindelige Herreskr√¶dderes Fagforening (Women's Union of Men's Tailors). In 1909, after women were permitted to participate in local elections, she was co-convenor of a meeting of women workers, later serving as a Social Democratic member of the municipal council along with two other women trade unionists, Henriette Crone and Anna Johansen. Death and assessment Olivia Nielsen died on 11 July 1910 while she was in Aarhus in connection with a congress of the Dansk Arbejdsmandsforbund (Union of Unskilled Labourers). On her deathbed, she encouraged the executive committee to continue her life's work and successfully urged them to elect her daughter Gudrun Bod√∏ as her successor. She is now considered to have been one of the most prominent pioneers of the Danish women's trade union movement, succeeding in improving unskilled women's pay and working conditions.

The similar ' classification is in the same axle configuration, but without the inter-bogie connection.South African Railways Index and Diagrams Electric and Diesel Locomotives, 610mm and 1065mm Gauges, Ref LXD 14/1/100/20, 28 January 1975, as amended Other equivalent classifications are: * AAR classification: 1-C+C-1 * UIC classification: (1‚Ä≤Co)+(Co1‚Ä≤) Overview The 1Co+Co1 wheel arrangement for electric and diesel-electric locomotives was a development of the Co+Co wheel arrangement to enable a relatively heavy locomotive to work on light rail by reducing the axle load. This was accomplished by the addition of a non-powered axle in an integral pony truck to the three traction motored Co powered bogie. In the United States of America, the South African Class 32-000 is credited with being a major factor in the demise of the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) and the rise of General Electric (GE) in the locomotive building business. In 1957, the South African Railways (SAR) called for tenders with two options. * 115 locomotives with a 1Co+Co1 wheel arrangement. * 230 locomotives with a Co+Co wheel arrangement. General Steel Castings' bogie The SAR was not very enthusiastic about the General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD) two-stroke cycle engines and had a strong preference for ALCO's Model 251 engine and GE's transmission systems. As a prior supplier of steam locomotives for the SAR, ALCO appeared to be virtually assured of receiving the order. General Steel Castings had a design on paper for a 1Co bogie which could be utilised by either ALCO or GE and which would enable the SAR's specification to be met for the heavier units. The SAR made it clear that, despite the two options afforded by the tender, its strong preference was for a 1Co+Co1 locomotive. However, the use of a bogie with an integral pony truck was not universally accepted by ALCO's engineering management. The result was that ALCO bid on only the Co+Co option and lost out to GE, who had bid on both options. In South Africa, this virtually opened the floodgates for GE, since more than half of the SAR's vast diesel-electric locomotive fleet which would be acquired between 1959 and 1981 were GE products. Usage =South Africa= Class 4E electric The 3 kV DC Class 4E electric locomotive was designed for the SAR by the General Electric Company (GEC) and was built by the North British Locomotive Company (NBL) between 1952 and 1953. The Class 4E was amongst the most powerful electric locomotives in the world at that time and at , it was a heavy locomotive for . The reasons for the leading pony truck were both to improve stability at speed and to reduce the axle load. Class 32-200 diesel-electric Between 1959 and 1961, the SAR placed 115 high-nosed Class GE type U18C1 diesel-electric locomotives in service in South West Africa, where very light rail conditions necessitated lighter axle loadings which could not be achieved with conventional three-axle bogies under a heavy locomotive. In June and July 1966, ten low-nosed GE type U20C1 diesel-electric locomotives entered service on the SAR. The Class 32-200 was actually a Class locomotive on the 1Co bogies of the Class , which reduced its axle load from the of the Class 33-000 to . Apart from the bogies, which necessitated a smaller fuel tank, its physical dimensions and exterior appearance were identical to that of the Co+Co Class and it used the same V12 prime mover. = Japan = EF10 in 1938 A number of Japanese electrics from the 1930s, also on Cape gauge, such as the EF10 also used this arrangement.

The Synagogue The synagogue was built in the beginning of the 3rd century AD during the reign of the Severan dynasty as a basilica-like building with three naves (a central one and two aisles) located in North-South direction. The width of the central nave was twice as long as the width of the aisles. The purpose of the building was determined when two mosaic floors were found during archeological researches. They were built one over another with great craftsmanship and extremely rich colors. The floor mosaics depicted images of Menorah and palm branch which are symbolic for the Jewish community and other geometrical shapes. A four-line inscription in Greek was found as well which provide information for the names of the donors of the temple. The synagogue was almost destroyed during the invasion of the Goths in 250 AD but later it was rebuilt in its original design. The building was destroyed again in the beginning of the 5th century during the persecution of Jews in the Roman Empire. Then, the building was restored and expanded. The second layer of floor mosaics which excluded Jewish symbols is evidence of that period. The synagogue was completely abandoned and destroyed in the end of the 6th century AD.

He is best known for creating the leading tenor roles in La damnation de Faust by Berlioz in 1846 and Meyerbeer's Le proph√®te in 1849. Early years and education Born in Paris and orphaned at an early age, Roger was brought up in Paris by his uncle. He entered the Paris Conservatoire and studied with Bl√®s Martin. At the completion of his training, he won first prize in singing and declamation. Career In 1838, Roger made his professional debut at the Op√©ra-Comique, Paris, in L‚Äô√©clair by Fromental Hal√©vy. He went on to create numerous leading roles in new operas with that company, including works by Daniel Auber (Rapha√´l in La Part du Diable, 1843 and Lor√©dan in Hayd√©e, 1847, and others), Hal√©vy (Edgard in Le sh√©rif, 1839, Olivier in Les Mousquetaires de la Reine, 1846, and others). Roger was the first Marquis in Perruquier de la R√©gence by Ambroise Thomas in 1838 and at the same theatre in 1846, the first Faust in La damnation de Faust by Hector Berlioz. He won praise for his clear, pure tone, his skill as a stage performer, and his musical intelligence. In 1848, after a tour of England with soprano Jenny Lind he moved from the Op√©ra-Comique to the Op√©ra where he created the title role in Meyerbeer's extremely successful opera Le proph√®te in 1849. He also created roles there in L‚ÄôEnfant prodigue by Auber, 1850, in Le Juif errant of Hal√©vy, 1852, and in Herculanum by F√©licien David, 1859, as well as singing in revivals of popular works such as La favorite and Lucia di Lammermoor of Donizetti and Les Huguenots of Meyerbeer. Between 1850 and 1860, Roger made seven highly successful concert tours of Germany. Later years In 1859, Roger had to have an arm amputated after a hunting accident. Nevertheless, with an artificial arm, he continued to sing in concerts and in opera productions. From 1868 until his death, Roger taught singing at the Paris Conservatoire. Critical assessment In the opinion of some contemporary critics, Gustave-Hippolyte Roger was perfectly suited, both as singer and actor, for the kind of roles with which he began his career at the Op√©ra- Comique, but some of the music he had to sing in roles at the larger Paris Opera,such as his most famous part, Jean in Le proph√®te, was too heavy for his voice and caused vocal decline.

It provides direct financial assistance and indirect support to the residents of sustainable use protected areas of Brazil in exchange for their engaging in conservation measures. History The Amazonas Sustainability Foundation (Funda√ß√£o Amazonas Sustent√°vel: FAS) is a private NGO based in Manaus, Amazonas, that promotes environmental conservation through sustainable development in state conservation units. It is a partnership between the government of the state of Amazonas and Banco Bradesco. The FAS was created in December 2007 to manage environmental products and services from State conservation units, and manage the Bolsa Floresta program. It is funded by affiliated NGOs, government bodies and private individuals and enterprises. Most of the funding comes from private sources such as Coca-Cola, Samsung, Grupo Abril and Marriott International. The Bolsa Floresta Program (Programa Bolsa Floresta: PBF) has its origins in the Zona Franca Verde initiatives launched in 2003 by The Amazonas State Secretariat of the Environment and Sustainable Development (SDS) to promote sustainable use of natural resources in order to increase the environmental benefits of the forests. The SDS initiated the program in September 2007 and assigned it to the FAS in March 2008. Bolsa Floresta is the main FAS program. The main funding comes from Bradesco and the Amazon Fund, which is supported by the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) and the Government of Norway. Deforestation is monitored annually by the FAS, SDS, and analysis of satellite images by partner organisations. Participation The Bolsa Floresta program, which is voluntary, involves families living along the rivers within state-run conservation units in Amazonas. The initial focus on conservation units is due to the availability of an existing legal framework. It is planned is to later extend the program to other areas. The formal income of most of the eligible families would place them at the extreme poverty level. However, this is raised considerably after accounting for the value of slash-and-burn cultivation of cassava, hunting, fishing and collection of forest products. The program provides social benefits and support for community associations in return for participation in workshops on environmental services, commitment not to open new areas of cultivation in the primary forest, and permanent enrolment of children in school. The basic goal is to improve the quality of life by valuing the standing forest. Bolsa Floresta imposes slightly more stringent rules than those set out in the conservation unit management plans. The family must join the reserve association and pay the association fee, must send their children to school, cannot increase the area under cultivation and can only clear secondary growth for crop rotation. However, enrolment in Bolsa Floresta by eligible families is close to 100%. By the end of 2008, the program covered the Uatum√£, Mamirau√°, Piaga√ßu-Purus, Uacari and Cujubim sustainable development reserves and the Catu√°-Ipixuna Extractive Reserve. There were plans to extend the program by 2010 to also include Mau√©s State Forest, the Aman√£, Juma, Rio Madeira, and Rio Amap√° sustainable development reserves and the Rio Greg√≥rio Extractive Reserve. As of 2016 the program was operating in fifteen conservation units covering a total of more than . Of these the Juma Sustainable Development Reserve was a certified REDD+ initiative and the other fourteen were in the REDD+ readiness phase. Program components The program has four components: income, family, association and social. The income component of the program supports sustainable income-generation activities including local processing of products to add value, ecotourism, fish farming, natural honey production and breeding of small livestock. The family component gives a small monthly payment of R$50 (US$30) to each household in exchange for a commitment to preserve the forest. The stipend is paid to the mothers of families who live in conservation units as a reward for conserving the forest. The association component provides funds to associations of residents of the reserves, who may freely decide how they want to use the funds. The association component, which aims to strengthen community organisation and control of the program, is equal to about 10% of the family component. The social component, coordinated with government institutions, improves education, sanitation, health, communications and transport infrastructure. Health is seen as an essential part of the program, since the other benefits have limited value if not accompanied by improved health. The program works with other state and private organisations to improve health among the Bolsa Floresta participants. Malaria, diarrhea, influenza and helminthiasis (worm infection) together make up about 95% of diseases in Bolsa Floresta conservation units. The FAS is involved in training health care workers in ways of preventing these diseases, and in developing plans for each conservation unit. For example, distribution of sachets for purifying water in Rio Greg√≥rio Extractive Reserve in 2015 resulted in a drastic drop in cases of diarrhea.  Replacement of the program  In 2018, it was replaced by a new program called \\"Programa Floresta em P√©\\" (\\"Standing Forests\\"). Notes Sources .

He was a member of an important family of artists operating a large workshop with various branches in Mechelen. As it is not always possible to attribute a particular artwork to one or the other family member due to compositional, stylistic, and iconographic similarities, it has been suggested that the works should be attributed to the 'Verbeeck group'. The works were typically executed in tempera or watercolor on linen.Frans Verbeeck at Dorotheum Life There is very little known with certainty about Frans Verbeeck. He was a member of the Verbeeck family of artists based in Mechelen. There were about 15 painters recorded in the archives of Mechelen with the name Frans Verbeeck.Frans Verbeeck at the Netherlands Institute for Art History There were also multiple artists with the name Jan Verbeeck active in Mechelen.Paul Vandenbroeck, 'Verbeeck's peasant weddings: a study of iconography and social function', Simiolus 14 (1984), pp. 79‚Äì124 Frans Verbeeck is the best-known of the artists in the family. The temptation of Saint Anthony He was likely born around 1510. According to the early Flemish biographer Karel van Mander, Frans Verbeeck was a pupil of Frans Minnebroer in Mechelen.Frans Verbeeck at Jean Moust Frans Verbeeck became a master of the local painter's guild in Mechelen in 1531. He was dean of the guild on multiple occasions including in 1563, 1564 and 1565. The Verbeeck family formed a dynasty of artists producing a large output of paintings in a workshop with multiple branches. They produced mainly compositions of a small scale using tempera rather than oil. The art historian Paul Vandenbroeck proposed in 1981 that the works created in the workshop should be attributed to the 'Verbeeck group', due to the close proximity in composition, style and iconographic language applied. Vandenbroeck felt it was impossible and meaningless to attempt to distinguish between individual family members such as Frans and Jan Verbeeck and attribute these paintings to one or the other artist. Despite the difficulty of distinguishing between the artists in the Verbeeck group, some works have been attributed specifically to Frans Verbeeck. The composition The Mocking of Human Follies (Auctioned at Dorotheum, 21 October 2014, lot 33) was listed in 2003 in the catalogue of exhibition 'De Zotte Schilders' ('The Mad Painters') as a painting by Frans Verbeeck, with the addition 'de Oude', which translates to 'the Elder'. There was also a Frans Verbeeck the Younger who is recorded having pupils between 1608 and 1614. Work Burlesque Feast (formerly attributed to Jan Mandijn) Frans Verbeeck did not leave any known signed paintings. A fair number of compositions with Hieronymus Bosch-like subjects, that could not be attributed to Bosch followers such as Jan Mandijn or to Pieter Huys, have been attributed to him. The range of his subject matter is very wide and includes religious scenes like The Temptation of St Anthony, satirical subjects of vernacular peasant life, such as The Mocking of Human Follies (Bilbao, Museo de Bellas Artes de Bilbao), allegorical works like The Mocking of Human Follies (Auctioned at Dorotheum, 21 October 2014, lot 33) as well as scenes of witches such as Temptation of Saint Anthony (At Gallerie De Jonckheere) or the Witches' Sabbath (Christie's London sale of 6 December 2018 lot 3).Frans Verbeeck, Witches' Sabbath at Christie's Frans Verbeeck is known for his depictions of peasant weddings and similar subject matter dealing with satirical and moralistic themes, inspired by Hieronymus Bosch and by the plays performed in the local chambers of rhetoric. Many of his compositions were painted in watercolor, which was the favoured medium of Mechelen artists in the 16th and 17th centuries.Golahny, Amy, Mia M. Mochizuki, Lisa Vergara, and John Michael Montias (2006). Neil de Marchi and Hans van Miegroet , The Antwerp-Mechelen Production and Export Complex, in: Album Amicorum J. Michael Montias, edited by M Misozuki, 133-147 (University of Amsterdam Press, Amsterdam, 2007. p. 133. . The family Verbeeck seems to be one of the first to have developed the theme of the peasant wedding. Three watercolor paintings on the theme are known, two of which depict carnavalesque weddings and one a joust. One of these paintings entitled Burlesque Feast (Bilbao Fine Arts Museum) was previously ascribed to Jan Mandijn, an attribution which is no longer accepted by art historian Paul Vandenbroeck and the RKD. A satire on avarice and the mutual hostility between the classes Another representative work attributed to Frans Verbeeck is The Mocking of Human Follies, of which there exist two versions, one the original (Auctioned at Dorotheum, 21 October 2014, lot 33) and the other a smaller workshop copy (Auctioned at Dorotheum in 16 October 2007, lot 38). The subjects of peasant weddings and human follies aimed to criticise in a funny and absurd manner the foolish, animal-like behaviour of man led by lust, desire and impulse. By mocking human follies these scenes were to serve as negative examples of improper behaviour for the urban elite of the Low Countries. The motivation behind, or key to deciphering, many of the allusive, rebuslike details of the compositions in the Verbeeck group can be traced to the satirical texts of the chambers of rhetoric, whose members loved elegantly poking fun at human vices and folly. The humour used in these compositions was direct, obscene and scabrous, with no trace of refinement. These subjects and motives stand in a long line that goes from Hieronymus Bosch (ca. 1450‚Äì1516) over Jan Wellens de Cock (ca. 1470‚Äì1521), Jan Mandijn (ca. 1500‚Äìca. 1560), Pieter Huys (ca. 1519‚Äìca. 1581) and Frans Verbeeck (ca. 1510/15‚Äì1570) to Pieter Brueghel the Elder (1526/30‚Äì1569) and further to Pieter Brueghel the Younger (1564‚Äì1638). The Verbeeck family had developed and maintained an individual style with a unique and rich iconography that can be distinguished from the two great Flemish masters of the fantastic and bizarre Hieronymous Bosch and Pieter Brueghel the Elder. The Verbeeck family's world of imagery with its strangeness and sometimes bizarre, caricature-like characteristics offers a very personal vision of the human race inspired by Flemish folklore.

History The origins of the union lay in the Wallpaper Stainers' Trade Union Federation, founded in 1917 by Charles Kean of the Amalgamated Union of Engravers to Calico Printers and Paper Stainers. Two years later, two other members of the federation, the Amalgamated Society of Machine Paper Stainers and Colour Mixers of Great Britain and the Paper Stainers' Union of General Workers, agreed to merge, forming the Wallpaper Workers' Union (WPWU). The Engravers' members in the wallpaper industry appear also to have joined, and Kean resigned as secretary of that union in 1920; its remaining members, concentrated in the cotton industry, became the United Society of Engravers of Great Britain and Ireland.Arthur Marsh and John B. Smethurst, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, vol.5, pp.65, 78-79University of Warwick, \\"National Union of Wallcoverings, Decorative and Allied Trades \\" The new union was also joined by the London Paperstainers' Trade Union and Benevolent Society, which appears to have become the core of the Wallpaper Blockprinters' Trade Union, a small union affiliated to the WPWU. The Wallpaper Blockprinters, the WPWU, and the Print Block, Roller and Stamp Cutters' Society continued to work together in the Wallpaper Stainers' Trade Union Federation and also the Wallpaper Makers' Industrial Council. This council-based strategy of negotiations with employers and avoidance of industrial action became central to the WPWU under Kean's leadership, and that of his successor, Cecil Heap. From the start, the WPWU represented workers in both the handmade and factory-production parts of the wallpaper industry; over time, it also recruited clerical staff and supervisors. Membership was fairly constant, from just under 3,000 in 1927, to 2,000 in the 1930s, peaking at 4,700 in 1975, then falling to 3,820 by 1979. The collapse of the Trade Union Federation in 1951 gradually brought about a change in strategy. The Wallpaper Blockprinters was merged in to the WPWU in 1966, the same year that Duncan McIntosh became general secretary, and the Print, Block, Roller and Stamp Cutters' Society merged in 1969. In 1971, he attempted to attract more non-manual workers by creating their own affiliated union, the Wallcoverings Staff Association, but this never attracted enough members to be sustainable, and rejoined the union in 1975, which then changed its name to the \\"National Union of Wallcoverings, Decorative and Allied Trades\\". However, McIntosh resigned in 1974, following a censure vote by the union's Darwen branch. By the 1970s, the union was considering a merger with a larger union, either Society of Lithographic Artists, Designers and Engravers or the National Graphical Association (NGA). In the end, it merged into the NGA in 1979.

After Kent State alum Tom Viggiano headed the program for the 1987‚Äì88 season, Bill Switaj was brought in once it was confirmed that the program would continue to exist beyond 1988 despite budgetary concerns. The program's entire season was cancelled that September in response to a hazing incident. The Golden Flashes would finally debut with Switaj as their coach in 1989. After three seasons they were eventually accepted into the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) but Kent State's program ended in the spring of 1994 when university president Carol Cartwright made a recommendation to the board of trustees that the program be discontinued.

During his career spanning over five decades, Barda has created a collection of over a million photographs of performers, composers, and conductors. Early life Barda was born in 1945 and spent his early childhood in Alexandria, Egypt, where his father was a lawyer and his mother a painter. The family returned to England in 1956.Exhibition leaflet for An Eye for an Ear. Royal Festival Hall, London (1 March - 8 April 1979). Barda attended Bryanston School and graduated from Birkbeck College, University of London (BA Hons Modern Langs), aspiring to apply his knowledge of modern languages as a commodities broker in the City. His early interest in photography was mostly documentary; while studying for his degree, he travelled to Romania to photograph the painted monasteries of Moldavia. When he was twenty, following a friend's suggestion, he attended his first concert of classical music: an evening of Viennese music conducted by John Barbirolli. Soon after, he started attending concerts several times per week, and listening regularly to BBC Radio 3. Career Barda decided to combine his interests in photography and classical music, and a chance encounter with a journalist for South Wales Magazine led to his first commission: photographing the harpist Susan Drake at home, on 12 November 1968. At the time, Drake's husband, John Wilbraham, was recording the Haydn and Hummel trumpet concertos and the producer asked Barda to shoot the album's sleeve. Retrieved on 6 September 2016. Drake then showed Barda's work to her agent, who recommended him to other artists, thus opening up opportunities for further engagements. Within a few months, Barda had his big break: The rehearsal took place at the Queen Elizabeth Hall the following Tuesday, and Barda showed the resulting contact sheets to Barenboim a few days later, in the Royal Festival Hall's green room. There, he also met Peter Andry, a senior executive at EMI, who suggested that Barda show his pictures to the art department at EMI. This immediately led to Barda's first major commission: to photograph Yehudi Menuhin, at EMI's No. 1 Studio, Abbey Road. Sarah Beth Briggs (29 September 2010) by Barda During the following decades, Barda has portrayed the world's leading classical musicians, as well as performers in opera, dance, theatre and musicals, as a freelance photographer. In her review of Barda's book Performance! (2000) for The Guardian, Charlotte Higgins stated: Barda has been closely associated with major British locations, such as the Barbican Hall, Edinburgh International Festival, English National Opera, Glyndebourne Festival Opera, Her Majesty's Theatre, National Theatre, Opera North, Queen Elizabeth Hall, Queen's Hall, Royal Albert Hall, Royal Festival Hall, Royal Lyceum Theatre, Royal Opera House, Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford-upon-Avon, St John's, Smith Square, Usher Hall, and Welsh National Opera. He has also worked abroad: in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia, the U.S., and China. He has taken photographs during rehearsals and recordings in the studios of AIR Studios, the BBC, CBS, EMI's Abbey Road Studios, Olympic Studios, among others, as well as at the home venues of major orchestras such as the LSO. By 2012, Barda had already produced more than a million photographs, and has been referred to as the doyen of British music photography. Method Scott Ellaway conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra in Guildford (18 March 2006) by Barda When commissioned for a project, Barda asks what music will be played, since it is his understanding of the piece that will enable him to anticipate the decisive split second at which a good picture might be taken. As he explained: \\"Music is constantly punctuated. (...) There are narrative passages, there are peaks and troughs. The pictures occur at the peaks, the climaxes. Even if you don't know the music--though it helps if you do--you develop a sixth sense for these highs.\\" Vladimir Ashkenazy has stated that one of the secrets of Barda‚Äôs success \\"is his rare gift of being unnoticed, discreet and unobtrusive while doing his work.\\" Personal life In 1970, Barda married Rosalind Mary Whiteley; they have three sons.

The memorial, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, is today a grade II listed building. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations, as well as the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing‚Äîthe largest British war memorial anywhere in the world‚Äîand the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens's civic war memorials. Miserden's is one of fifteen War Crosses by Lutyens, all sharing a similar design. Many of Lutyens' commissions for war memorials originated from friends and previous clients. His commission for Miserden's memorial appears to have come through local landowner Noel Wills for whom Lutyens carried out work at nearby Misarden Park after it was severely damaged by a fire in 1919.Skelton, p. 83. History and design The memorial stands opposite the village church. It is a typical Lutyens War Cross with a tapering shaft and short arms, of limestone construction. The cross sits on an unusually large plinth of three rectangular stone blocks which itself sits on a small square base. Unusually among war crosses, the names of the fallen are inscribed on the lowest section of the plinth in bronze lettering. The second stage of the plinth contains the memorial's dedication: \\"TO THE MEMORY OF OUR GLORIOUS DEAD 1914‚Äì1919\\". Above, on the top section of the plinth, the dates of the Second World War and the names of the village's fallen from that conflict were added at a later date. From the markings \\"VH 1920\\" on the back, it is believed that Victor Hayward, the stonemason on the Misarden Park estate constructed the memorial. Details of the unveiling ceremony are unknown, but it likely took place in 1920.Skelton, p. 173. Miserden War Memorial was designated a grade II listed building on 25 August 1960. In March 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a \\"national collection\\" and all of his free- standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries were updated and expanded.

It is dedicated to the Dormition of the Mother of God and to Saints Joachim and Anna. History Building of the church began in 1627, in the second year of Prince Miron Barnovschi-MovilƒÉ's reign. In the foundation act, he listed himself and his mother, the nun Elisafta, as ktitors. As he left the country in 1629, to return only briefly, completion of the work fell to his executors, Iancu Costin and Matei Gavrila»ô. At some point prior to June 1633, Barnovschi asked them to sell his properties in Poland and use the money to finish the church, which he had already placed under control of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Prior to departing for Constantinople, where he was beheaded, he also asked that he be buried in Moldavia. Vasile Lupu carried out this wish, but no record was kept of where the burial took place. Paul of Aleppo claimed that Miron was interred in his own church. During archaeological digs in 1998, an arched brick crypt was identified under the floor in the middle of the nave. It is believed that the bones belong to Barnovschi. Andi Emanuel Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site When the original roof burned, it was rebuilt by Lupu. It is believed that the church was covered in tiles, but following an 1836 fire that affected large parts of the city, a new roof of tin plates was installed. The church functioned as a monastery for a time, and was the official guesthouse for Orthodox patriarchs visiting Moldavia. Its cells hosted a school taught in Greek. In 1983, during systematization, the annexed buildings were demolished, and apartment blocks were built on the land, up to the church door. Aside from the church, only the bell tower and an adjacent basement remained. Renovation work on the interior and exterior began in 1994. Barnovschi donated an epitaphios to the church, presumably stitched by his mother. In the middle, the Burial of Jesus is depicted, and there is an inscription in Greek. The prince also asked Metropolitan Varlaam Mo»õoc to order several icons from Moscow. Although these were painted and paid, they never arrived in Ia»ôi, in spite of numerous requests, including to Tsar Michael I. In 1653, Paul of Aleppo saw a painting of Barnovschi astride a while horse. At the time, it was said that at the moment of the latter's execution, a deep crack appeared on the portrait. Paul also reported that the church was made entirely of limestone and had a closed foyer with a dome above; during the 18th century, an open foyer was added in front of this. History at the Barnovschi parish site While researching the church prior to 1885, Melchisedec »òtefƒÉnescu saw no inscription, instead finding only a portrait of Miron and his mother in the foyer, holding an image of the church; and a portrait of the prince in the nave. These are the last remnants of the original painting. Description Above and below the windows, the facade is decorated with a row of lengthy recesses. Entry is through the open foyer, which is supported by six stone columns. The interior painting dates to 1880, but over half the walls have only plaster and whitewash on them. The linden iconostasis, from 1788, is 7 meters long. It includes 40 icons painted in red, green, black and brown, dating to the 18th century. The 1971 icons on the royal doors feature, respectively, the Madonna and Child, and the crowned Christ holding an open Gospel. The oldest icon in the iconostasis, painted on wood in 1734 by an unknown artist, depicts the Dormition; in 1806, it was encased in silvered metal. The 1791 icon of John the Baptist was done by a deacon from Mouth Athos. The style is similar, but the classical elements more pronounced. The deacon's doors show the Archangels Michael and Gabriel. Above this row and separated by a cornice there are eight more icons, rather than the usual twelve. There is a rectangular arched space above the royal doors featuring, above, Christ on the Throne of God; and below, a western-inspired Last Supper. Elsewhere, an icon of the Virgin Mary has a cross above, the old one having disappeared. An icon of Saint Anne holding the Virgin Mary, reportedly wonderworking and dated to 1625, is painted on wood and set up in a special iconostasis. The bell tower is located 50 meters south of the church. Built in large blocks of stone and brick, it has a roof of zinc. The tower is on two arched levels. It has a staircase and a hiding place, both carved into the walls. The large bell was donated by Barnovschi in 1628. Cast at Lviv and weighing 400 kg, it is inscribed in Old Church Slavonic and with a Latin translation of a Psalm of David. Being cracked, it is not presently in use. The small bell, of 70 kg, is carved in the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet and features a date of 1715. A third bell weighs 300 kg. The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs, with a date of 1628. Also listed are the 1786 basements and the 17th-century cell ruins and bell tower.

The genus has a pan tropical distribution,being known from Oriental, Neotropical, Australian, eastern Palearctic, and Madagascan Zoogeographic regions being best represented in the Neotropics. Irenangelus is closely related to the more widespread genus Ceropales, the two genera forming a monophyletic subfamily, Ceropalinae within the Pompilidae. This is regarded as the most basal grouping of the Pompilidae but this view is problematic because of the kleptoparasitic life history of the Ceropalines, it is now considered that they Ceropalines and other pompilids evolved from a common ectoparasitoid ancestor.

After 3 seasons of reserve football at Southampton he made his debut in the final game of the 1970‚Äì71 season against Crystal Palace at The Dell.

His grandfather was Sir William Willoughby, who first acquired the lands of Turners Puddle, Turners Puddle church and his great- grandfather was John Willoughby, 8th Baron Latimer. His sister Margaret Willoughby married another Dorset landowner and MP, John Wadham of Catherston Leweston, who was Captain of Sandsfoot Castle in 1550 and Recorder of Lyme Regis in 1558. Life Primarily occupied with his estates, he had land on the outskirts of Wareham, together with an annuity of ¬£10 out of the dissolved Wareham Priory, and also holdings in Devon and Cornwall. On the death of his father in 1542, he inherited Turners Puddle. In October 1553, possibly through the influence of his wife's brother James Turberville, an associate of Stephen Gardiner, he was one of two MPs elected for the constituency of Wareham in the first Parliament of Queen Mary's reign. Neither he nor his fellow-member Thomas Phelips opposed the initial measures in Parliament towards the restoration of Catholicism in England but, unlike Phelips, he did not stand again.

History The federation was established at a conference in Manchester on 8 September 1890, organised on the initiative of George D. Kelley. The conference was attended by eleven unions in the printing industry: * Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Artists * Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Printers * Bookbinders' and Machine Rulers' Consolidated Union * Leeds Typographical Society * London Consolidated Lodge of Journeymen Bookbinders * London Printing Machine Managers' Trade Society * London Society of Compositors * Scottish Typographical Association * Typographical Association The federation agreed to focus on recognising employers who conformed to the best practice of all its member unions, and to assist affiliates in supporting the pay and conditions of their members. But it would not organise strike action, or ask affiliates to financially support each other. The eleven unions each put membership of the new federation to their members; those based in London rejected it, while the five based outside approved it, and were joined by the Dublin Typographical Society and the Edinburgh Machinemen. During the 1890s, the organisation achieved little, beyond forming local federations in various towns around the country. By 1896, it was said to exist only on paper, and proposals that year for affiliates to pay a membership fee were defeated, alternative proposals being successful in 1899. That year, new rules were drawn up to expand its remit, but affiliates were very slow to vote on whether to approve them. In the meantime, the London-based societies were planning their own rival federation. A conference in December 1900 between them and the P&KTF; agreed the terms for a national federation, and this was finally established in 1902 as the National Printing and Kindred Trades Federation.Arthur Marsh and John B. Smethurst, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, vol.5, pp.66-67University of Warwick, \\"Printing and Kindred Trades Federation\\" By 1903, the following unions were affiliated: * Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Artists * Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Printers * Amalgamated Society of Pressmen * Bookbinders' and Machine Rulers' Consolidated Union * Lithographic Music Printers * Lithographic Stone and Plate Preparers * London Consolidated Society of Journeymen Bookbinders * London Society of Compositors * London Society of Lithographic Printers * London Society of Machine Rulers * National Amalgamated Society of Printers' Warehousemen and Cutters * Operative Printers' Assistants' Society * Scottish Typographical Association * Stereotypers' Assistants' Society * Typographical Association * Vellum Binders' Society Following its re-establishment, the federation held an annual conference, and from 1903 it elected an executive committee, which tried to maintain control over strikes by affiliates. A conciliation board was established in 1908, in conjunction with the Federation of Master Printers and Allied Trades,John Rylands Library Catalogue of an exhibition of books and broadsides illustrating the early history of printing on the occasion of the visit of the Federation of Master Printers and Allied Trades in June, MCMVII. Manchester: the governors of the John Rylands Library, 1907 and the aim of avoiding industrial action, but as its use was voluntary, it did little. In 1919, the federation supported the establishment of the Joint Industrial Council for the Printing and Allied Trades, and organised an industry-wide agreement on holidays and working hours. It grew to include 23 members in 1927,Trades Union Congress, Annual Report of the 1927 Trades Union Congress, p.129 and although there was a gradual process of mergers among its affiliates, the total number of workers it represented generally grew, reaching 320,000 in 1956, and 405,000 in 1971. The federation continued to negotiate agreements on sick pay, redundancy and pensions, although it never involved itself in the setting of wages themselves.Peter Bain and John Gennard, A History of the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades, p. 255 The P&KTF; was run by a large administrative council, on which each union had at least one representative, but larger unions had several - at its peak, the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades (SOGAT) had 33 members of the council. One seat was reserved for a woman, while the other seats were consistently filled by men. The administrative council elected an executive committee of fifteen members, a president and vice president, while a general secretary, assistant general secretary and assistant secretary carried out most of the work of the federation.Peter Bain and John Gennard, A History of the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades, pp.255-256 By the 1970s, continued mergers had reduced the role of the P&KTF.; Two of the three unions with the largest number of print workers, the National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants (NATSOPA) and SOGAT, voted to disband the federation in 1972. Although they were defeated by the smaller members, SOGAT decided not to attend any further meetings of the federation. The remaining members attempted to reorganise the federation as the \\"Printing Trade Unions Co-ordinating Bureau\\", but NATSOPA was unhappy with the planned financial arrangements, and declared it would not remain part of such an organisation. The organisation decided that there was no point in continuing without the two largest unions in the sector and voted to dissolve in December 1973.Peter Bain and John Gennard, A History of the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades, pp.265-269 Membership Members in 1969 included: * National Graphical Association * National Union of Journalists * National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants * National Union of Wallcoverings, Decorative and Allied Trades * Sign and Display Trade Union * Society of Graphical and Allied Trades * Society of Lithographic Artists, Designers and Engravers * Scottish Typographical Association General Secretaries :1891: George Davy Kelley :1911: Albert Edward Holmes :1941: John Fletcher :1958: Granville Eastwood :1974: Gloria Hart (acting) Presidents :1891: C.

It is aligned with the Syrian opposition and are heavily supported by Turkey, who provides funding and military training along with artillery and aerial support. It is the most notable group among Syrian Turkmen Brigades supported by Turkey. Ideology and structure Named after Ottoman Sultan Murad II, the flag of the Sultan Murad Division quotes the Shahada to express a political commitment to political Islam (Islamism), while the red field symbolizes Ottomanism. Among the commanders of the group are Ahmed Othman, Fehim ƒ∞sa and Ali ≈ûeyh Salih, who is an ethnic Arab. I≈ûƒ∞D Tarafƒ±ndan √ñld√ºr√ºlen Komutan: Ali ≈ûeyh Salih Equipment Among the Syrian rebel groups participating in the Turkish military intervention in Syria, the Sultan Murad Division is the group that receives the most support from the Turkish Armed Forces. It operates at least 8 FNSS ACV-15 armoured personnel carriers during the operation. The group also operate Milkor MGL grenade launchers. The main heavy weapons of the group consist of technical vehicles armed with heavy machine guns and autocannons. Previously it has also received BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missiles from the United States, although more support is given by Turkey than the US since the former's intervention. History The Sultan Murad Brigade was formed in early 2013 and mainly operated in the Aleppo Governorate. By 2016, the group claimed to have around 1,300 fighters. In mid-2017, it formed the \\"Sultan Murad Bloc\\" with other units within the Syrian National Army (SNA). It took part in the Turkish military intervention in Syria. Between 4 and 15 June, heavy fighting broke out between SNA factions led by the Sultan Murad Division and Ahrar al-Sham and its allies in and near al-Bab. By 15 June, 33 people were killed and 55 injured in the infighting. On 8 June, between 60 and 70 SNA fighters, including several Sultan Murad Division commanders, defected to the Syrian Army and the Syrian Democratic Forces during the clashes. According to the Hawar Kilis Operations Room, of which the Sultan Murad Division is a part, the unit led by Abu al-Kheir al-Munbaji that defected to the government had run criminal activities and was supposed to be arrested when it deserted. In early November 2019, the Homs al-Adiyyeh Brigade of the Sultan Murad Division defected to Jaysh al-Izza after the unilateral release of several Syrian Army prisoners of war by the Turkish government in the context of the Second Northern Syria Buffer Zone. According to Turkish sources and an activist in Afrin, the Sultan Murad Division was one of the groups which volunteered to send fighters to Libya as part of a Turkish operation to aid the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord in December 2019. Allegations of war crimes = Torture of POWs = After their capture of the town of Jarabulus from ISIL in September 2016, Sultan Murad Division fighters published pictures of themselves torturing four YPG members prisoners of war, who were captured by the rebel group while, according to YPG claims, trying to evacuate civilians. According to the YPG, two of the Sultan Murad Division fighters who had been involved in the torture of POWs were later captured and questioned by the Anti-Terror Units. =Shelling of civilian areas= On 25 October 2013, the Sultan Murad Division shelled a monastery in Aleppo. According to an Amnesty International report from May 2016, indiscriminate shelling of Sheikh Maqsoud by Islamist rebel groups, including the Sultan Murad Division, killed between February and April 2016 at least 83 civilians, including 30 children, and injured more than 700 civilians. Amnesty International‚Äôs regional director suggested that these repeated indiscriminate attacks constitute war crimes. A United Nations report in February 2017 came to the conclusion that during the siege of Eastern Aleppo the joint operations room of Syrian rebel factions Fatah Halab including the Sultan Murad Division, after vowing to take revenge on the Kurds in Sheikh Maqsoud, intentionally attacked civilian inhabited neighbourhoods of the Kurdish enclave, killing and maiming dozens of civilians, and that these acts constitute the war crime of directing attacks against a civilian population.

The union was founded in 1809 as the Dublin Typographical Provident Society.

However, the NGA merged with some small unions in Dublin during the 1960s, and attempted to recruit further members in the city, resulting in demarcation disputes between the two unions. In 1983, the society merged with the Electrotypers' and Stereotypers' Society of Dublin and District and the Irish Bookbinders' and Allied Trades Union, forming the Irish Print Union; this ultimately joined the Services Industrial Professional Technical Union in 1998.

Already in the Early Christian period, there was disagreement within the Church as to the appropriateness of religious art. While the use of religious art gradually came to be accepted by the mainstream, its rejection within certain limits remained a constant throughout the Middle Ages. In the twelfth century, certain elements within reform monasticism (especially the Cistercians but also others) saw the use of art by monks as inappropriate for a number of reasons. Criticism of the use of monastic art was seen as a criticism of the greatest patrons of religious art of the time, traditional Benedictine monasticism (virtually all of the greatest medieval art up until this time had been religious). Since traditional Benedictine monasticism was one of the richest and most influential segments of society‚Äîand since art was one of the great vehicles of interaction between traditional monasticism and the lay public, this interaction being an important source of wealth for monasticism‚Äîthe controversy over art that arose involved far more than aesthetic questions. The Apologia is the most articulate document we have for this controversy and one of the most important in understanding how medieval art was used and perceived. In it, Bernard takes up five major criticisms of the use of monastic art.  Art to attract donations  = The monastic investment = Perhaps Bernard's harshest criticism of the monastic use of art addresses the economic base of monastic art production: the monastic investment in art for the purpose of attracting donations from the visiting public. In doing so, he takes up a number of different themes such as the justification of investing in art, art for the honor of God, the relation between material and spiritual prosperity, and the financial necessity of pilgrimage art. = The liturgical artwork = The Mass of Saint Giles, by the Master of Saint Giles, c. 1500 (National Gallery, London) In discussing the artistic means by which the investment in art was carried out, Bernard particularly criticizes excess in art, focusing especially on excess in material, craftsmanship, size, and quantity. In this criticism, what he most objects to is not monumental sculpture and painting but rather liturgical art, that is, works often of gold, silver, and jewels that were used in the liturgy and often in the Cult of Relics. = The equation between excessive art and holiness = In his critique of the reception of art on the part of the general public, Bernard took up the indispensable element of medieval pilgrimage art: the equation between excessive art and holiness, that is, the use of excessive art in order to create a sense of praesentia (the physical presence of the holy). = Art in opposition to the care of the poor = Following in the patristic tradition, Bernard also sees art as in opposition to the care of the poor, his most significant social objection external to monasticism properly speaking. = Art as a spiritual distraction to the monk = One of Bernard's most important criticisms of the monastic use of art is that of art as a spiritual distraction to the monk. Aside from simple distraction, this criticism includes such dangers to the medieval monk as curiosity and materiality. = To Whom the Apologia Was Addressed = While the traditional view has been that the Apologia was directed at the art of the monastery of Cluny in particular and that of other offending Cluniac and traditional Benedictine monasteries in general, more recent scholarship has shown that the Apologia was instead directed at not only all of traditional monasticism but also marginal traditional Benedictine monasteries, the new ascetic orders (Carthusians, Gilbertines, Premonstratensians, and so on), and Bernard's own Cistercian Order.

He is most remembered for his endorsement of the campaign against the veiling of Muslim women.  Early career  Ibrahim Fejiƒá was born into a prominent Bosniak family in the Herzegovinian town of Mostar, then part of the Austro- Hungarian Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he attended primary school and madrasah and received his ijazah. He was fluent in Turkish, Arabic and Persian, and had a working command of German language. Fejiƒá functioned as theology teacher and publicist in his hometown. In 1920 he entered the ulema of the majlis in Sarajevo, and in 1929 he was elected mayor of Mostar, by then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During the Second World War, following the Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia, Fejiƒá stood with the Yugoslav Partisans, took an active part in the resistance movement and denounced the Holocaust and the persecution of Serbs and the Romani people.  Religious leadership  The end of the Second World War saw the Partisans as victors in Yugoslavia. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia took power and in 1947 reached an accord with the Islamic Community, requiring the election of reformist leaders. In August a new constitution of the Islamic Community was promulgated, with Fejiƒá being elected the first grand mufti (reisu-l-ulema) in the \\"Second Yugoslavia\\" on 26 August. The ceremonial inauguration took place on 12 September in the Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque rather than the Emperor's Mosque, as had been traditional. In the year of Fejiƒá's inauguration, with the aim of accelerating the emancipation of women, the Women's Antifascist Front of Bosnia and Herzegovina launched a campaign against the wearing of hijab () and niqƒÅb (zar, the face veil). Already in his inaugural address Grand Mufti Fejiƒá voiced his support of the campaign, stating: \\"One valuable legacy of the liberation war of our peoples is the proclamation of women's equality. But unfortunately women cannot achieve the full expression of that equality, as they are inhibited by wearing the veil and gown.\\" On 1 November the Islamic Community declared that \\"the veiling of women is not required by religious code. Muslim women, as regards religion, are free to walk about unveiled and tend to their affairs.\\" In 1950, Fejiƒá published a text in which he further explained that veiling the face was not mandated by the religion.  Death  In November 1957, Fejiƒá requested that he be relieved of his office. He died on 15 December 1962, and was buried two days later in Sarajevo.

The C√Æteaux Moralia in Job is an illuminated copy of Gregory the Great's Moralia in Job made at the reform monastery of C√Æteaux in Burgundy around 1111. It is one of the most familiar but least understood illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages. The manuscript is housed at the municipal library in Dijon (Biblioth√®que municipale de Dijon). Close analysis of these illuminations reveals a gradual transformation from the conventional and textually unrelated images that were common at the time and that are found at the beginning of the manuscript (the famous frontispiece is an exception, having been added later) to largely unique and textually based ones further on. This indicates a change in attitude toward the illuminated initial on the part of the artist only after production had begun, something that was not part of the original conception. More specifically, after initially illuminating this patristic work in a conventional and unexceptional manner in the illuminations in the beginning of the book, the artist gradually began to internalize the exegetical principals laid out by Gregory in the Letter to Leander (that is part of the prefatory matter of the book), in particular, Gregory's demand that one \\"become\\" what one reads. In the same way that Gregory found it acceptable to analyze a line or even a word of text out of context, according to modern sensibilities, so the artist was quite willing to do the same, often with reference to the contemporary monastic polemics of reform. The end result was the exegetical spiritualization of the first generation Cistercian experience, the visual expression of Gregory's exegetical method. Initial to Book 21, Moralia in Job; Dijon, Biblioth√®que municipale, ms 173:41. An example of this may be found in the illuminated initial \\"I\\" to Book Twenty-one (Dijon, Biblioth√®que municipale, ms 173:41). The initial depicts a tattered monk with his knife in his belt and his leggings slipping down, chopping away at the base of a tree that is unusually large for a medieval manuscript and that forms the body of the initial. Meanwhile, above, a layman is also busy cutting, but this time branch by branch. One of the main themes of Book Twenty-one is the importance of the avoidance of temptation. According to Gregory, the senses of the body are the windows of the soul, and it is by thoughtlessly looking out through these windows that a person may fall into the pleasure of sin‚Äîespecially lust‚Äîthrough desire, even though this was against the person's original intention and even though the person never actually acts upon that desire (Moralia 21:4-5). It is for this reason that such danger should be anticipated and the source of such temptation‚Äîin this passage, primarily women‚Äîbe avoided, even if this only involves the sense of sight and nothing more. As an example of the seriousness of the role of the sense of sight in the process of sin, Gregory points out that \\"Eve would not have touched the forbidden tree if she had not first thoughtlessly looked at it.\\" And so in the initial to this book, the ragged monk cuts the tree of temptation in accordance with the biblical injunction, \\"at the root\\" (Mat. 3:10, Lk. 3:9). That is, he cuts himself off from the sight of all such temptations by fleeing the world and seeking shelter in monastic seclusion. The layman, in conceptual antithesis to the monk, cuts the tree branch by branch while perched precariously in its midst, ignoring his impending doom as implied in the inevitable fall of the tree. In other words, the pious lay person is contented with half measures by continuing to live \\"in the world\\" and will inevitably pay the price for that decision.

The museum was founded on December 23, 1980, by Reina Torres de Ara√∫z in the building of the Former Christian Mission Chapel. The building was constructed between 1909 and 1910, which was the meeting place for a group of Barbadian Protestants. It is currently administered by the Ministry of Culture of Panama, and supported by the Society of Friends of the Afro-Antillean Museum of Panama. It is in charge of spreading the Afro- Antillean culture and its contribution to Panamanian history and culture. Among its exhibits there are articles for personal use, work tools and household objects, photographs, documents and videos. It has an exhibition that explains the construction of the Christian Mission Chapel and others that show the arrival of Afro-Antilleans to Panama, their way of life and contribution to the culture of Panama.  History  = Christian Mission Chapel = The Christian Mission Chapel in 1915. The building that currently houses the Afro-Caribbean Museum of Panama was built between 1909 and 1910, by a group of Protestant religious from present-day Barbados. The land where it is currently located was obtained with the support of the Panama Railroad Company, in the current neighborhood of El Mara√±√≥n. The foundation stone was installed in 1909, in a ceremony presided over by Priest Beckles and Reverend Thorburne. The construction was carried out under the direction of priest Burke and the assistance of Brothers Brooms and King, and culminated in the inauguration of five constructed buildings, on January 16, 1910. The Christian Mission left the building and moved to R√≠o Abajo in the mid-20th century, which was later abandoned. The building was in great disrepair at the end of the 1970s. = Museum = On December 23, 1980, the museum was inaugurated in the building of the Chapel of the Christian Mission, by Dr. Reina Torres de Ara√∫z, founder of many of the museums administered by the Ministry of Culture, former National Institute of Culture (INAC). The current museum building became part of the cultural heritage of the National Institute of Culture through Law 43 of 2017 that, among other provisions, authorized the National Mortgage Bank to transfer to INAC, free of charge, a plot of 2,408.93 m¬≤, which contains to the MAAP building, its garden and outbuildings. The Society of Friends of the Afro-Antillean Museum has taken steps to promote the segregation and transfer of the land since 2010.  Collections  The collection at its foundation consisted mainly of photographs from different times. The altar in the chapel, dating from 1910, was an important element of the exhibition. At present, the museum consists of two domestic dioramas with a bedroom and a kitchen that show the Afro-Antillean daily life and clothing. There is also one that represents a work scene during the excavation of the Panama Canal, which consists of a section of track and a metal dump truck. The museum also has an administrative area for the sale of thematic books, souvenirs and orientation for visitors. The central space consists of panels with historical photographs, mannequins, machines, scale models of the wooden rental houses characteristic of the late 19th to mid-20th century, and historical furniture, especially from the time of the construction of the Canal. In addition, there is a luggage trunk and a shopping coupon book to be used in the commissariats of the Silver Roll.

History In 1050 the first church was built; it was destroyed several times over the centuries. The current cathedral was built on the remains of the previous churches, and was built between 1728 and 1774 in Baroque style. Most of the documents were lost eighteenth century, and the architect's name is uncertain. The cathedral was probably designed by Andreas Fischer Emanuel Mayerhoffera or Josef von Erlach, though it may have been designed by someone else. Part of the baroque church burned down in the late eighteenth century. The stucco on the ceiling was made by Italian masters, while the altarpiece of the Assumption is the work of Leopold Kupelwieser, a native of Vienna.

Early life and marriage Son and heir of Sir Humphrey Stafford (died 1413), he had been knighted by 1397. Some time before then he had married Elizabeth, daughter and coheiress of Sir John Maltravers of Hooke, Dorset. Elizabeth's mother, also called Elizabeth, had already wed Humphrey's father, and the younger Elizabeth was intended to marry John, Lord Lovell, but the king, Richard II, forbade the match. The newly-weds received the manor of Perton, Staffordshire as a residence from Humphrey's father, where they lived until 1413 (when both Humphrey's father and Elizabeth's mother died within a fortnight of each other). As his grandmother was a daughter of the first earl of Stafford, he was cousin to the current duke of Buckingham, Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham. Within a few years, Stafford the younger had become involved in an old property dispute with the Erdswick family; by 1406 he was elected M.P. for Staffordshire; and a year later he participated in that county's parliamentary elections. Military career and the 'silver hand' At some point ‚Äì Professor J. S. Roskell has suggested due to \\"a bellicose engagement\\" ‚Äì Stafford lost a hand and used a prosthesis; the antiquarian William Dugdale later called him \\"Humphrey Stafford with the Silver Hand.\\" Although the date of this occurrence is unknown, he was an active soldier at the turn of the fifteenth century; there were, therefore, plenty of opportunities for him to have lost a limb. He served as a Lancer for the Earl of Stafford, and in January 1400 he joined his uncle Ralph Stafford in suppressing the Epiphany Rising against the new king, King Henry IV. He took part in the English invasion of Scotland later that summer, and by 1403 had been retained by the Prince of Wales.Castor, H., The King, the Crown and the Duchy of Lancaster (Oxford, 2004), 217, n. 114. Present at the Battle of Shrewsbury, he fought with the Prince in a party of 'four esquires and 100 archers.' Possibly as a result of this service, he was granted an annuity by Henry in 1406, and Humphrey continued serving Henry in Wales in the long campaign against Owain Glynd≈µr's rebellion, for instance taking part in the siege of Aberystwyth in 1407. Most recently it has been suggested that it was in Henry's Welsh service ‚Äì possibly at this siege ‚Äì that he lost his hand, and replaced it \\"with an artificial one made out of silver\\". Stafford received further favour from the Crown soon after, being granted the wardship of the son and heir of John Tuchet, 4th Baron Audley, and, when that was taken back in 1409, he received estates in Shropshire and Cambridgeshire in compensation. Unusually (\\"striking\\", says Helen Castor) he was not a retainer of the crown or the Duchy of Lancaster, in Staffordshire, but rather of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham,Castor, H., The King, the Crown and the Duchy of Lancaster (Oxford, 2004), 210. for whom Humphrey represented the interests of the main Stafford family.Castor, H., The King, the Crown and the Duchy of Lancaster (Oxford, 2004), 213. Later life Abbotsbury Abbey in 2008 When his parents died in 1413 Stafford became a wealthy man; K.B. McFarlane assessed him as \\"wealthier and more worshipful\\" than many of the lower-ranking barons of the period.McFarlane, K.B., The English Nobility in Later Medieval England (Oxford, 1973), 7. He inherited both the Stafford estates and also those from the Maltravers family, which were centred around Hooke. The Stafford inheritance, however, was scattered over ten English counties and worth about ¬£570 a year, while those in Dorset were assessed in the 1412 tax as around ¬£660 (and so was taxed at the highest rate).Pugh, T.B., 'The Magnates, Knights and Gentry', in Fifteenth Century England 1399‚Äì1509, eds S.B. Chrimes, C.D. Ross and R.A. Griffiths (Manchester, 1972), 100. His new wealth enabled him to improve the marriage prospects of his daughters, one of whom soon married James, a nephew of Thomas, Lord Berkeley. This marriage gave the Staffords an interest when Berkeley inheritance dispute broke out and the whole Berkeley inheritance was claimed by the earl of Warwick. This was refuted by James (later Baron Berkeley), whose claim was backed by Humphrey,. Rawcliffe, 'Baronial Councils in the Later Middle Ages', in Patronage, Pedigree and Power, ed. C.D. Ross (Gloucester, 1979), 90. and who had been nominated heir by Thomas, Lord Berkeley. The grand Dunster Castle, joint- custody of which was the result of a profitable partnership with his brother. Stafford attended the coronation of Queen Catherine of Valois in 1421, in his role of King's knight, and in the same period, spent time defending his estates (one of his Shropshire manors, for example, had been seized by Welshmen in the employ of Edmund, Earl of March). In doing so, he appears to have taken full advantage of the influential position of his brother, John, on the King's Council. According to Roskell and Woodger, \\"relations between the two were, despite John's illegitimate birth, always intimate.\\" They were also profitable: in 1431 they were jointly granted custody of two-thirds of the Dunster Castle, and later, the manor of Tothill in Lincolnshire, and the next year they received Chiselborough manor in Somerset. Humphrey Stafford wrote his will at the end of 1441; particular bequests included Abbotsbury, Cerne and Sherborne Benedictine Abbeys, the Cistercian Abbey at Forde, and other friaries and priories. His only surviving son, William, received plate; he also left ¬£100 for poor relief. His brother John received arras, flagons and some religious icons, and was also appointed executor of the will. Humphrey died on 27 May 1442; he was buried in Abbotsbury Abbey alongside his parents, wife, and those of his children who had predeceased him. Offices held Stafford was Member of Parliament eleven times in his career: firstly in 1406 for Staffordshire, and then in 1414, 1417, 1419, 1420, 1421, 1422, 1426, 1427, and 1432 for Dorset. He was also High Sheriff of Staffordshire for 1403‚Äì4 and Somerset and Dorset for 1415‚Äì16.

The choir and the altar were designed by the famous Austrian architect Franz Anton Hillebrand, the interior frescoes depicting scenes from the life of King Stephen I, the altarpiece represents the Stephen king kneeling in front of the Mother of God and was made by Vinzenz Fischer, while imposing ceiling paintings are from Johan Cymbala. Pulpit View of the pulpitThe Late Baroque pulpit was built in a sumptuous classicizing style similar to Franz Anton Hillebrandt's main altar. The sculpture group on the top of the abat-voix (Triumph of the Church over Idolatry) represents the same topic as the fresco on the first vault. The frescoes of the church were finished by Johann Cymbal in 1768 giving an approximate date after which the pulpit could have been erected. The pulpit is a monumental red marble structure with gilt wood sculptures. Cherublike angels are sitting on the ledge with the symbols of the tetramorph. The balustrade is decorated with three gilt reliefs (The Good Shepherd, The Sower and Two Sons). An orb of flowers forms a hanging finial under rich garlands. There is sculpted relief above the door with a group of symbols: the Eye of Providence, a horn, a violin, a wreath and a palm branch. The underside of the abat-voix is decorated with a dove, and there is sculptural group on the top depicting the Triumph of the Church over Idolatry.

Biography  Portrait of Constanze Mozart (1802) Carl and Franz Xaver Mozart (1798) Hansen was born at Skelby in N√¶stved Municipality, Denmark. Hansen's father worked in the War Chancellery and later became a farm manager. When he displayed some artistic ability, he won the support of Carl Adolph von Plessen, a court chamberlain, which enabled him to enroll at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. Erik Mortensen. Hans Hansen Biographical notes Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbach Kunstnerleksikon While there, he won silver medals in 1789 and 1791. According to his diaries from this period, he took Jens Juel as his model. From 1793 to 1797, he travelled as an itinerant portrait painter in Jutland and Funen, then received more financial support from Plessen, allowing him to visit Hamburg and Vienna to continue his studies. He was awarded funding from the Fonden ad usus publicos, a fund first established in 1765 by King Frederick V to support artistic and scientific endeavors. Shortly after. he was able to study briefly in Rome, then he went back to Vienna. After returning to Copenhagen, he became a candidate for membership in the Royal Academy and a full member in 1809. His attempts to become a Professor were unsuccessful, but he became an Artist in Residence at Charlottenborg Palace in 1815. From 1817 to 1825, he was a lecturer at the Academy, where he taught perspective and mathematics. In his last years, he spent most of his time restoring old portraits at Frederiksborg Palace. He is best known for his portraits of the Mozart family, painted during his second stay in Vienna: Constanze Mozart and a double portrait of her sons, Karl Thomas and Franz Xaver, which are currently on display in Salzburg. He met his future wife, J√∏rgine Henriette Lie (born 1778), while painting Constanze Mozart, widow of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756‚Äì1791), who was then married to the Danish diplomat, Georg Nikolaus von Nissen (1761‚Äì1826). They were married in 1803 and had a son, Constantin Hansen (1804‚Äì1880), named after Constanze, who stood as his godparent. He also became a well-known painter. Hansen's other portrait sitters include Eline Heger, Christian Ditlev Frederik Reventlow, Anders Sand√∏e √òrsted, C. A. Lorentzen, Adam Wilhelm Moltke, Andreas Hallander, Princess Vilhelmine Marie, Friederich M√ºnter and King Frederick VI. Hansen and his wife died of typhus within a month of each other. They are buried at Garnisons Cemetery in Copenhagen.

It was originally developed for the LUNAR-A project, but it has been used as a liquid apogee engine in some geostationary communications satellite based on the Lockheed Martin A2100 and GEOStar-2 satellite buses. It has also been used on the HTV and Cygnus automated cargo spacecraft. History During the 1970s, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries had built under license the Rocketdyne MB-3 for the N-I rocket, for which it had also developed the second stage attitude control system. In the 1980s it also developed the thrusters for ETS-4 (Kiku-3), the first to be built in Japan. In 2000 it acquired and merged with the aerospace division of Nissan and became IHI Aerospace. IHI Aerospace started developing the BT-4 for the later cancelled LUNAR-A mission to the moon. While the mission was cancelled, the thruster has seen success as a liquid apogee engine on the Lockheed Martin A2100 and Orbital ATK GEOStar-2 platforms. Two other Orbital ATK products that use the BT-4 due to their leverage of the GEOStar-2 platform are the Cygnus spacecraft and the Antares Bi-propellant Third Stage (BTS). The use on the A2100 platform has allowed IHI to export the BT-4 even to American military programs such programs as the MUOS and AEHF. On March 9, 2006, IHI Aerospace announced that the AEHF-2 BT-4 engine had successfully performed its mission, unlike AEHF-1's. On November 29, 2010 IHI Aerospace announced that it had received and order from Lockheed Martin of four BT-4 engines for AEHF-4, MUOS-4, MUOS-5 and Vinasat-2. With this order, it achieved its 100th-unit foreign engine export since it started selling abroad in 1999. For the HTV project, IHI developed a new version, the HBT-5, which enabled them to replace the American R-4D from the third flight onward. On October 3, 2013, with the successful berthing of the Cygnus Orb-D1 mission, IHI announced that the propulsion was based on their 500N Delta-Velocity Engines. In January 2018, a BT-4 kick motor was used on the GovSat-1 geosynchronous commsat flight.https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/01/spacex- govsat-1-falcon-9-launch/ Versions The BT-4 is a family that has been used as liquid apogee engine, orbital maneuvering engine and as a thruster.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays and Chicago Cubs. High school and college Dermody attended Norwalk High School in his hometown of Norwalk, Iowa. In his senior season, he pitched to a 10‚Äì3 win‚Äìloss record, 1.26 earned run average (ERA), and 164 strikeouts. He also recorded the first six-inning, 18 strikeout perfect game in Iowa state history. In addition, Dermody hit .434 with 51 runs batted in (RBI). His pitching performance that year earned him the Bob Feller Pitching Award. Dermody was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 26th round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign and instead attended the University of Iowa. With the Hawkeyes in 2010, Dermody made 10 appearances, seven of which were starts, and posted a 7.93 ERA. The following season he made 14 starts and went 4‚Äì6 with a 4.15 ERA and 75 strikeouts in 84 innings pitched. In 2010 and 2011, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Hyannis Harbor Hawks of the Cape Cod Baseball League. The Colorado Rockies drafted Dermody in the 29th round of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft, but he did not sign. In 2012, Dermody won Iowa's Big Ten Sportsmanship Award, and pitched to a 1‚Äì7 record, 4.50 ERA, and 60 strikeouts in 76 innings. He was drafted for a third time, this time by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 23rd round of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft. Dermody declared his intention to sign with the Diamondbacks, and went to Arizona for a physical examination. The Diamondbacks organization determined that he had a 40 percent tear of the left ulnar collateral ligament, and fearing the injury would require Tommy John surgery, declined to offer him a contract. Dermody then returned to the Hawkeyes for his senior year, making 14 starts in 2013. He had the best season of his college career, posting a 7‚Äì2 win‚Äìloss record, 3.64 ERA, and 68 strikeouts in 94 total innings. Professional career =Toronto Blue Jays= Minor Leagues The Toronto Blue Jays selected Dermody in the 28th round of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft, and he signed on June 14. He was assigned to the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League Blue Jays, where he made one scoreless relief appearance before being promoted to the Short Season-A Vancouver Canadians of the Northwest League. In 43 total innings that season, Dermody posed a 5‚Äì1 record, 1.66 ERA, and 51 strikeouts. In 2014, Dermody was promoted to the Class-A Lansing Lugnuts, where he pitched to a 4‚Äì6 record, 4.69 ERA, and 65 strikeouts in a career-high 96 innings. Dermody was assigned to the Advanced-A Dunedin Blue Jays for the 2015 season. In 77 total innings that season, he was 4‚Äì1 with a 4.21 ERA and 62 strikeouts. Dermody remained in Dunedin to open the 2016 season, and made 16 relief appearances with a 1.96 ERA before being promoted to the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats. He excelled at the Double-A level, making another 16 relief appearances and posting a 0.92 ERA, which led to his promotion to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. Major Leagues On September 1, 2016, Dermody was called up by the Blue Jays. He made his MLB debut on September 3, 2016, against the Tampa Bay Rays. In relief of Joe Biagini, he pitched two-thirds of an inning, faced four batters, gave up two hits with no earned runs and got two outs while striking out one. Dermody wound up making 5 appearances with Toronto, failing to retire a batter in the final two en route to a 12.00 ERA. After the 2016 season, the Blue Jays assigned Dermody to the Mesa Solar Sox of the Arizona Fall League. On October 31, Dermody was named an AFL All-Star. He appeared in 10 games for Mesa and pitched to a 5.40 ERA with eight strikeouts. On April 16, 2017, Dermody was recalled by the Blue Jays from the Buffalo Bisons. He was optioned back to Buffalo on April 17, recalled again on April 28, and sent back down on April 30. On March 21, 2018, Dermody was designated for assignment. He was outrighted to Triple-A Buffalo on March 24. Dermody underwent Tommy John surgery in May 2018. He was assigned to Triple-A Buffalo and put on the Injured list to start the 2019 season. He became a free agent following the 2019 season. =Sugar Land Skeeters= On March 9, 2020, Dermody signed with the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. =Chicago Cubs= On August 6, 2020, Dermody was signed to a minor league contract by the Chicago Cubs organization. He was added to the team's major league roster on September 6, 2020, and pitched a scoreless inning in relief. Dermody was designated for assignment on September 7, 2020. Dermody elected free agency on September 28.

These proteins are about 200-250 residues in length and exhibit 7 TMSs.  Homology  Homologues are found in a variety of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, yeast, fungi, plants, animals and viruses. The E. coli genome encodes three paralogues, YbhL, YbhM and YccA. Distant homologues found in Drosophilia melanogaster and the rat are the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor- associated protein (NMDARAI) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor glutamate binding chain, respectively. Two others are the rat neural membrane protein 35 and the Arabidopsis thaliana Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) protein capable of suppressing Bax-induced cell death in yeast.  BI-1  One of these proteins, TEGT or the Bax Inhibitor-1 (TC# 1.A.14.1.1), has a C-terminal domain that forms a Ca2+-permeable channel. BI-1 is an ER-localized protein that protects against apoptosis and ER stress. BI-1 has been proposed to modulate ER Ca2+ homeostasis by acting as a Ca2+-leak channel. These proteins are distantly related to the ionotropic glutamate-binding protein of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor of man. Homologues include a putative cold shock inducible protein and a SecY stabilizing protein.  Function  Based on experimental determination of the BI-1 topology, Bultynck et al. proposes that its C-terminal Œ±-helical 20 amino acid peptide catalyzes Ca2+ flux both in vivo and in vitro. The Ca2+-leak properties were conserved among animal, but not plant and yeast orthologs. By mutating one of the critical aspartate residues (D213) in the proposed Ca2+-channel pore in full-length BI-1, D213 proved to be essential for BI-1 dependent ER Ca2+-leak.  Structure  Chang et al. published crystal structures of a bacterial homolog, YetJ (TC# 1.A.14.2.3) at 1.9 √Ö resolution and characterized its calcium leak activity. Its seven-transmembrane-helix fold features two triple-helix sandwiches wrapped around a central C-terminal helix. Structures obtained in closed and open conformations are reversibly interconvertible by changes in the pH. A hydrogen-bonded perturbed pair of conserved aspartyl residues explains the pH dependence of this transition, and the pH regulates calcium influx in proteoliposomes. Homology models for human BI-1 provided insight into its cytoprotective activity.

Biography  Former civil servant of Ancien R√©gime in the French Royal Navy, at Saint- Domingue, he was then a lawyer of the Parliament of Paris in 1788. At the outbreak of the French Revolution, he was involved as a journalist for the Mercure National, writing especially for press freedom. He enlisted in the French Revolutionary Army in 1790 as an officer in the 1st Regiment of Riflemen, first as second lieutenant, and later as lieutenant, in 1792; he then served as aide-de-camp to general officers in the Army of the Rhine. Masclet, who was friend to Rouget de Lisle, wrote the last two verses of La Marseillaise. In an anonymous letter published in the Journal de Paris (1791) under his pseudonym \\"Eleuthere\\", he opposed Collot d'Herbois in the case of the Swiss of the Ch√¢teau-Vieux Regiment, that paradoxically became the symbol of freedom, and, in 1792, expressed with Andr√© Ch√©nier his strongest claims against festivities given in their honnor by the municipality of Paris. He was pro-Lafayette at that time and went to England during the Reign of Terror to save his life. He constantly wrote defending him, asking for his release from Prussian and Austrian prisons. He published numerous articles in The Morning Chronicle using the pseudonym Eleutheros (freeman). He worked to Lafayette's deliverance and succeeded in establishing a correspondence with Lafayette with the assistance of active agents. They became friends at that time. Later, he served as sub-prefect during Napoleonic era, respectively in Boulogne-sur-Mer, Lille, Douai and Cosne until 1814. In Boulogne, he was slandered as a double agent, a spy and a traitor. After the First Restoration, he was French consul at Liverpool from where he went to Edinburgh, and later to Bucharest, in 1824. He was French consul at Nice at the time of his death.

Frame synchronization must be achieved before a data stream can be decommutated. Etymology Commutation is named by analogy with electric commutators, which engage multiple electrical contacts in sequence as they rotate; similarly, telemetry commutation involves sampling a sequence of data points in turn, before returning to the first data point. Hardware or software which performs commutation is referred to as a commutator; its opposite at the receiving end is a decommutator. Dedicated hardware generally supports faster commutation and decommutation than software on a general purpose architecture. Mechanism A set of data words, together with synchronization and ID or counter words, constitute a minor frame; a set number of minor frames are combined to form a major frame. Measurands occupy fixed positions within each major frame, with these positions defined in a database, allowing them to be extracted. Measurands may be sampled multiple times within each minor frame (supercommutation), or they may only be sampled once in several frames (subcommutation), depending on the required data rate for each measurand. Commutated frames may also contain asynchronous data, which require further processing to extract. Decommutators may be equipped to handle multiple frame formats, containing different sets of measurands in different positions, for use in different operating modes; a switch in format may be signaled with a specific measurand. Translators exist to allow support for equipment-specific database formats. Decommutated measurand values may be stored in a \\"current value table\\" or other architecture.

A polyglot (he speaks fluently Spanish, German, English, French and Catalan), he has translated into Spanish several works and poems by Shakespeare, Walpole, Walter Scott, Shelley, John Henry Newman, Joseph Conrad, Robert Frost, Rainer M. Rilke, Theodor Da√ºbler and Joanna Walsh. He was awarded the 1987 National Youth Prize granted by Mexican government, and the 2009 Colima Narrative Prize from the National Insititute of Fine Artes (Mexico). He has been a member of the National Artists System of Mexico. His literary contributions to world- renowned artists such as the like of Gabriel Orozco and Anish Kapoor are well known. Early life and career Pablo Soler Frost was born in Mexico City. He is the first son of Mart√≠ Soler and Elsa Cecilia Frost, both known as translators and scholars. As a child, he was a collector, which might explain the many interests portrayed in his writings from insects and fossils to legends of the silver screen. Very early he was briefly encouraged by Isaac Asimov; other writers with whom he corresponded were Ernst J√ºnger and √Ålvaro Mutis, but his true mentors were the Mexican writers Salvador Elizondo and Hugo Hiriart. Pablo graduated from The College of Mexico in 1992 with a dissertation on \\"The symbol and its political roles in international relations\\". In 2007 he was invited by Mexican director Juan Carlos Martin to write the screenplay for a road movie about Americans in Mexico. The resulting Film, 40 d√≠as (2008) was received with hostility, even though respected Mexican critics such as Rafael Avi√±a and Fernanda Sol√≥rzano praised it, as much as John Anderson in Variety. He writes about English, German and Mexican writers and culture in journals like Conspiratio, Ixtus, Letras Libres, L√≠neas de fuga, Nexos, Revista de la Universidad and La Tempestad, among others. He also collaborates in Mexican newspapers El Universal, Reforma and La Jornada.

The school is a part of the Faculty of the Arts of Tel Aviv University and is operated in collaboration with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra (IPO). The school is named after German Jewish philanthropist Josef Buchmann and conductor Zubin Mehta, then music director of the IPO. Mehta is the honorary president of the school and has conducted the school's orchestra regularly in Israel and on tours abroad. The BMSM mission is to train elite young musicians in performance, composition and research in music and prepare them for professional careers in these fields. The BMSM's orchestral training program is an integral part of the school and aims to educate orchestral musicians to supply the artistic future of the IPO and other orchestras. History The school is named after philanthropist Josef Buchmann and conductor Zubin Mehta (pictured), who is the BMSM's honorary president. The school's origins were as the Israel Conservatory and Academy of Music, founded in 1945 by senior members of the IPO (until 1948 named the Palestine Symphony Orchestra) who had fled Europe on the brink of World War II. In 1966 it was merged into the newly formed Tel Aviv University and in 1972 became a cornerstone for the university's Faculty of the Arts. The heads of the academy were among the founding fathers of the music world in Israel: violist and composer √ñd√∂n P√°rtos, pianist and conductor Arie Vardi, composers Yehezkel Braun, Yizhak Sadai and Joseph Dorfman, violinist Yair Kless and composers Ami Maayani and Noam Sheriff. The school's three honorary presidents were Arnold Schoenberg, Leonard Bernstein, and Zubin Mehta. The Buchmann-Mehta School of Music was founded in March 2005 as a partnership between Tel Aviv University and the Israel Philharmonic. The school's foundation was made possible by the donation of Josef Buchmann and conductor Zubin Mehta, who has been actively involved in the school since its inception. The first head of the school and one of its founders was pianist and pedagogue Tomer Lev. In 2009 he was succeeded by conductor and bassoonist Zeev Dorman, who had served as the IPO's principal bassoon player as well as chairman of the orchestra's executive board for nearly 25 years. In August 2015 Lev resumed his post as head of the BMSM. Academics The school trains students in performing, singing, conducting, composition and theoretical research and grants B.A/B.Mus and M.A/M.Mus academic degrees as well as PhDs in musicology. The school has a department of bow string instruments, keyboard instruments, wind instruments, vocal studies, composition, conducting, and musicology. International students program The BMSM \\"Adler-Buchmann International Free Tuition Program offers students who come from outside of Israel tuition free-of-charge,\\" and on a selective basis also living stipends and housing. Ensembles and orchestral training program BMSM has \\"a full symphony orchestra, opera ensemble, oratorio choir, chamber choir, contemporary music ensemble and around 50 different other ensembles.\\" Students in the school's orchestral training program have weekly sessions and sectional rehearsals with the principal players of the IPO. The BMSM Symphony Orchestra serves as the cadet orchestra for the Israel Philharmonic and its members are coached by IPO's musicians. The orchestra performs in Israel and abroad. Campus and facilities BMSM is based at the Ramat-Aviv campus of TAU. The school has three performance spaces and a recording studio. The 450-seat Clairmont Concert Hall, built in 1998, is the school's primary performance venue, followed by the 120-seat Targ Auditorium. Israeli composer Ami Maayani designed and supervised the building of Clairmont Concert Hall, both architecturally and acoustically.

Clapp (1814‚Äì1889) was the only president of the St. Louis Ladies' Union Aid Society and helped supply for those wounded during the American Civil War. She advocated for women to step outside of their homes and join the efforts to help during the war. She made medical supplies available for injured soldiers and provided shelter for refugees of all color as well. Even when the war was over, she continued to make a difference by creating homes for women and orphans. She was president of the Western Female Guardian Home and the director of the St. Louis Protestant Orphan Asylum.  Early life  Anna L. Clapp was born on August 15, 1814. Anna's maiden name was Wendell. She was born in Cambridge, New York and is of Dutch descent. For three years, she was a teacher in Newburgh, New York. Her desire to do good started before the American Civil War. She served as the treasurer for the Industrial School Association. The Industrial School Association was created in 1854 to provide food, shelter, and education to orphan children. At the age of twenty four, she married Alfred Clapp who was an enterprising merchant. They resided in Brooklyn, New York up until the American Civil War began. Mrs. Clapp and her husband emigrated to St. Louis, Missouri. The reason for the couples move is unknown, but they found the right place to put Anna's benevolent nature into action. Every public building was overwhelmingly taken over by wounded soldiers and the St.Louis area was in desperate need for help. Shortly after arriving in St. Louis, Anna discovered the St. Louis Ladies' Union Aid Society and her efforts to help those in need during the American Civil War began.  St. Louis Ladies' Union Aid Society  Anna started her work by joining the local Ladies' Union Aid Society. The St. Louis Ladies' Union Aid Society was formed in 1861 to provide funds, supplies, and volunteers for the wounded and sick soldiers during the American Civil War. The organization was the largest and most active female aid group in St. Louis during this time. The society worked closely with the Western Sanitary Commission to help Union soldiers. The St. Louis Ladies' Union Aid Society, an all-female organization, assigned Mrs. Clapp as president in the fall of 1861. She remained the only president throughout the society's existence in St. Louis. As president she was in charge of ensuring that hospital garments, medical supplies, grief counselling, and family support were available for the needy during this time. The society did not affiliate with any religious connections, but all members were of Christian faith. Jessie Benton Freemont and Adaline Weston Couzins were among many of the women in the Ladies' Union Aid Society.  Post-Civil War and death  After the American Civil War ended, Anna continued her benevolent efforts in the St. Louis area. She was the president of the Western Female Guardian Home and the St. Louis Protestant Orphan Asylum. The St. Louis Protestant Orphan Asylum was established in 1832 due to the cholera epidemic. Many children were left without family to care for them during the epidemic. The orphan asylum has transformed into what is now known as Great Circle and still provides services to those struggling. Anna L. Clapp died on December 3, 1889 in Lee Center, Illinois. Her husband, Alfred Clapp, died only two years following Anna's death. They are buried next to each other at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.

Sternberg (August 2, 1942 ‚Äì September 26, 1995) was an American molecular biologist and bacteriophage researcher, particularly known for his work on DNA recombination and the phage P1. Early life and education Born in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York, Sternberg gained a BSc at Brooklyn College, followed by a master's at Long Island University. In 1969, he received a PhD from Purdue University, Indiana, researching T-even phage head proteins under the supervision of Sewell Champe. Career In 1970‚Äì72, Sternberg held a postdoctoral fellowship at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) in Paris, under the direction of Fran√ßois Gros, where he researched the head proteins of phage Œª. He then returned to the US, taking up the position of staff fellow in the laboratory of Robert Weisberg at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, where he continued to study Œª, in collaboration with Lynn W. Enquist and others. Dimer of P1 Cre recombinase bound to DNA In 1976, Sternberg joined the group being established by Michael Yarmolinsky in the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the National Cancer Institute's Frederick Cancer Research Center at Fort Detrick, Frederick, Maryland, where he started to study the phage P1. From 1981 he directed his own group, continuing to research the P1 phage, as well as branching out to study DNA recombination in mammalian cells. In 1984, his group moved to the Central Research and Development Department of DuPont, in Wilmington, Delaware, and Sternberg was a senior research fellow at DuPont Merck at the time of his death. Sternberg advised the NIH on human genome research. He served on the editorial board of the academic journal, Journal of Molecular Biology. Research P1 phage had been discovered in 1951, but was little understood when Sternberg began to research the virus. He discovered the Cre‚Äìlox site-specific recombination system, in which the Cre recombinase enzyme acts at the lox recombination site to allow P1's double- stranded DNA genome to circularise after infection. Sternberg, Brian Sauer and others in his group subsequently showed that Cre‚Äìlox is a flexible recombination system which also functions in eukaryotic cells, and it is now widely used in genetic engineering. Sternberg elucidated multiple other features of the phage and its life cycle, including lytic and lysogenic replication cyles, DNA methylation and viral packaging, as well as immunity to the phage. He and his coworkers also developed P1-derived cloning vectors, enabling the cloning of very long stretches of DNA, which have been used in mapping the human genome. Personal life and legacy Sternberg married Ilene Harfenist, also from Brooklyn, in July 1967. The couple had a daughter, Rebecca. He was diagnosed with cancer in 1987, from which he died in 1995 at West Chester, Pennsylvania. The Nat L. Sternberg Thesis Prize, an annual award for PhD theses in the field of prokaryotic molecular biology, was founded in his memory by former colleagues Lynn W. Enquist and Thomas J. Silhavy.

Williams Beal established what would become a successful architectural practice in Boston. He would have three sons, the elder two of which would come to work for him. These were John W. Beal and Horatio W. Beal. A third son, Robert Washburn Beal, would be a landscape architect.Commonwealth Shoe & Leather Co. NRHP Nomination. 2014. The firm of J. Williams Beal, Sons was established in early 1920, following the death of J. Williams Beal. The Beal brothers were the sole partners until 1960, when they added H. Story Granger and Raymond W. Dyer, as which point the firm became known as J. Williams Beal, Sons, Granger & Dyer. After Dyer's departure a new partner, Edward A. J. Poskus, was added. Horatio Williams Beal died in 1964. J. Williams Beal, Sons, Granger & Poskus was dissolved upon the death of Granger in 1969. John Woodbridge Beal died in 1971, after which Poskus managed the firm alone. J. Williams Beal, Sons & Poskus lasted at least until the mid-1980s. Partners John Woodbridge Beal was born on July 11, 1887, in Hanover, Massachusetts. Beal worked in his father's office for a number of years, until his father's death in 1919. At this point he established the firm of J. Williams Beal, Sons with his brother, Horatio.

Sudhakaran. The film stars Kalaiyarasan and Satna Titus in the leading roles and '96' movie director C. Premkumar handling the camera. The music was composed by Paartav Barggo, and editing was done by I. J. Alen. The film released on 12 May 2017 and was a blockbuster. Plot The film begins with Krishna (Kalaiyarasan) narrating to the audience that he wants to kill two people. One of them, Sarathi (Valavan), is right in front of him, and he starts following him on his bike. Sarathi goes into a dark place and is blocked by two guys. Sarathi takes out his gun and tries to shoot them. Krishna, who has been watching this, pounces on Sarathi and saves the two guys, Sagaa (Sarithiran) and Dharman (Krishna Kumar). Dharma kills Sarathi and thanks Krishna, and they become friends. A flashback reveals Krishna's story. He has a family, and his sister wants to become a doctor. Despite getting good marks in her +2 exams, she is unable to secure a seat in the Govt. Medical College. Because of this, Krishna decides to admit her in a private college. He somehow manages to find a seat with help from some middlemen and pays around 60 lakhs for that. Soon, he comes to know that the college has been denied NCA approval, and the students who got admitted there are now helpless. When Krishna enquires in the college, he gets a reply that he paid the capitation to middlemen and should contact them further. Sarathi happens to be the middleman, and he attacks Krishna when he asks for the money. Krishna then files a police complaint with the help of his fianc√©e Janani (Satna Titus), who is a sub-inspector. Meanwhile, a youngster is robbed off his money and car by a group of thieves at night, and he is Gourav (Goutham), who is the rich son of Gupta, an industrialist and the owner of the medical college. The thief ties Gourav almost naked to a pole and takes away his BMW. Gourav is rescued in the morning by an ongoer, and Gourav vows to take revenge against the thief. The affected students now start their protests, and suddenly, Krishna's sister is killed in what appears to be an accident. Krishna vows to take revenge against the killers, whom he believes to be the owner of the college, Gourav, but he controls his anger. He decides to help the students and plans to get his revenge slowly. Meanwhile, Gourav's BMW is found, and the thief is revealed to be Dharman. Gourav's men track Dharman, and they capture him and take him to Gourav, who wants him killed. However, Dharman attacks the driver and slams the car onto Krishna's sister, thus killing her. Dharman escapes and vows to take revenge against Gourav. Hearing this story from Dharman, Krishna too reveals to Dharman that his second target is Gourav, and they both decide to help each other and kill Gourav. However, Krishna silently plots his revenge against Dharman too, who happened to kill his sister in the accident. Krishna threatens Gourav's assistant Karna (Aadukalam Naren) and gets important details regarding the capitation fee and uses this as a bait against Gourav. Gourav is searching for the guy who is the reason behind this, and he is unable to find. Krishna and Dharman plan to lure Gourav into a trap and kill him. They plan that Dharman will inform Gourav about Krishna and his plans and will make him come to a place with cash, in exchange for Krishna. However, Gourav asks Dharman to kill Krishna and take the money. Dharman backstabs Krishna and attacks him. Gourav uses this to kill Sagaa with a gun and hurt Dharman. Krishna manages to fight off Gourav and gain control. When he is about to kill him, the students come in and request Krishna not to kill Gourav, as they all wanted to become doctors and they do not want to kill someone to get back their money. Krishna insults Gourav that he is worse than Dharman, who will do anything for money, but even after being so rich, Gourav is doing dirty things to get more money, which makes him nothing more than a scumbag. Gourav is touched by this and feels guilty. As Krishna and the students leave the place, a gunshot is heard and the film ends, implying that Gourav has shot himself.

He was well known in the Cevennes for his brutal repression of french protestants On 24 July 1702, about fifty peasents, led by Mazel and √âsprit S√©guier, marched onto the archpriest's residence at Pont-de-Montvert, to inflict vengeance upon him, and release the imprisioned huguenots. At night, they raided Langlade's residence, first releasing the prisioners from their cells underground, and then set the house on fire. Langlade fell and was injured while trying to flee from a window, and was then finished by the peasants. In 1704, while Jean Cavalier was negotiating peace with field marshal de Villars, leader of the royal troops, others kept on fighting, and among them Abraham Mazel. In January 1705 he was arrested but spared thanks to the help of the parish priest of Saint Martin de Coronac whose life Mazel had formerly spared. On 24 July, 1705, he escaped from the Tour de Constance (Gard) with seventy-six other prisoners. With the guarantee that he would be taken to a foreign country, he surrendered and managed to join up with his friend Elie Marion. With his comrades he went to Geneva and Lausanne where he received an allowance as an officer in the ‚Äúcamisard regiment‚Äù. In November 1705 he took part in the attempted landing of the camisards and Savoyard partisans in Savoie. He sought refuge in England and participated in the ¬´ C√©vennes prophets ¬ª group activities. He felt called to go back to the C√©vennes, where he returned. In March 1709 with Daniel Guy nicknamed ‚ÄúBillard‚Äù and Antoine Dupont, he went to the Vivarais region and formed a troop of young men led by Jean Justet de Vals. On June 22 the camisards attacked the Swiss regiment de Courten but the latter withdrew without fighting. On July 8 they were defeated at Leyrisse, where Justet and probably Dupont were killed. The remainder of Mazel‚Äôs troops were dispersed at Font-R√©al near Saint-Jean Chambre (Ard√®che). Guy Billard was killed near Vors, but Mazel managed to escape once more. He took refuge in the C√©vennes, met up with lay preachers who were still active, such as Claris, Corteiz and others. He then prepared another armed uprising. On October 17, 1710, he was made prisoner and killed at the Mas de Couteau near Uz√®s (Gard). A commemorative tablet was placed in the Reformed church in Uz√®s, a former Franciscan convent taken by the Reformed in 1791.

It is only thermodynamically stable under a small composition range. Despite this limitation, it has useful properties for band gap and strain engineering of silicon integrated optoelectronic and microelectronic semiconductor devices. Synthesis Germanium-tin alloys must be kinetically stabilized in order to prevent decomposition. Therefore, low temperature molecular beam epitaxy or chemical vapor deposition techniques are typically used for their synthesis. Microelectronic Applications Germanium-tin alloys have higher carrier mobilities than either silicon or germanium. Therefore it has been proposed that they can be used as a channel material in high speed metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors. In addition, the alloys' larger lattice constant relative to germanium makes it possible to use them as stressors to enhance the carrier mobility of germanium channel transistors. Optoelectronic Applications At a Sn content beyond approximately 9%, germanium-tin alloys become direct gap semiconductors having efficient light emission suitable for the fabrication of lasers. Since the constituent elements are chemically compatible with silicon, it is possible to integrate such lasers directly onto silicon microelectronic devices, enabling on-chip optical communication. This is still an active research area, but germanium-tin lasers operating at low temperatures have already been demonstrated. In addition, germanium-tin light emitting diodes operating at room temperature have also been reported.

These flanking lines generally occur in the vicinity of supercell thunderstorms or large multicell thunderstorms.  Structure of a flanking line  A flanking line often has a stairstep appearance where the tallest cells are connected to the main cumulonimbus. Figure 1 shows this layering: * In the forefront, there are different cumulus species evolving from the cumulus mediocris to the cumulus congestus; * Behind, there are cumulonimbus calvus; * Finally, the huge cumulonimbus capillatus incus dominates the background showing a probable supercell thunderstorm. The bases of the clouds making the flanking line are merged. The forefront area usually has no precipitation. In the picture, it is possible to detect precipitation in the background just above the horizon below the main cloud.  Formation of the flanking line  Figure 2: Formation of a flanking line generated by a downburst and the gust front The flanking line is generated by the downburst that builds a cold air wedge beneath the warmer airmass in front of the thunderstorm. This warm air is forced upward and generates cumuliform clouds when the air column becomes saturated. These feeder clouds will merge with the main cumulonimbus and will regenerate the storm. These new feeder clouds are located, in the northern hemisphere, at the west or southwest of the main cloud. Since these updrafts do not originate from the ground, the lifted condensation level will be higher than the convective condensation level associated with the main cumulonimbus. The fact that the cloud base of the flanking line is higher than the main cloud base is shown in the area D of the figure in Jeff Habby's article. When the difference between these two levels increases, it indicates that the downburst has become stronger and thus that the severity of the thunderstorm has increased.  Soaring  A widespread misconception in the world of soaring is that the updrafts associated with an incoming thunderstorm are almost always very strong and turbulent, which is most of the time incorrect. If one believes this myth, then he would consider it safe (from thunderstorms, at least) to fly in an area with plentiful weak to moderate updrafts, since the updrafts associated with thunderstorms are always supposed to be strong and turbulent. In fact, the turbulence zone is located in and at the vicinity of the downdraft. The updrafts under the flanking line are smooth. The refutation of this myth is poetically expressed by Dominique Musto who says the following: The author means that when flying under a flanking line, the updrafts will be widespread and smooth. Since the cells making the flanking line will fuse with the main cell, the soaring conditions will \\"improve\\", the updrafts will become stronger and stronger and the cloud base will become darker and darker. Another clue of imminent danger is that the cloud base is significantly higher than the theoretical cloud base based on the difference between the temperature and dew point on the ground. Eventually, the pilot may inadvertently fly under the main cell. If the pilot ignores these harbingers, he may hit a tornado generated under a wall cloud and disintegrate his fragile skiff. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, Dennis Pagen experimented the exploitation of a flanking line (that he calls a bench) with a hang glider along a severe thunderstorm. He was able to fly at high speed for . This flight was performed during the preliminaries of the 1990 hang glider world championship in Brazil. The author admits that this achievement was dubious.

QSP can be viewed as a sub- discipline of pharmacometrics that focuses on modeling the mechanisms of drug pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and disease processes using a systems pharmacology point of view. QSP models are typically defined by systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE) that depict the dynamical properties of the interaction between the drug and the biological system. QSP can be used to generate biological/pharmacological hypotheses in silico to aid in the design of in vitro or in vivo non-clinical and clinical experiments. This can help to guide biomedical experiments so that they yield more meaningful data. QSP is increasingly being used for this purpose in pharmaceutical research & development to help guide the discovery and development of new therapies.

At age thirty, she found herself \\"single and heartbroken\\" and she resolved to explore why that was the case. Her focus shifted to dating and technology and sexuality; she traveled to San Francisco, dated often, and wrote about her encounters. She profiled the dating app Tinder. Witt noted that many coming-of-age novels rarely addressed the issue of sexuality from a feminine perspective. In Slate magazine in 2013, she noted that, in many classic novels, the subject of female sexuality was missing or subdued, in addition to having female characters being defined simply in opposition to dynamic male characters; when she turned to books written by men, she was turned off.

Of those, 1,462 individuals were born in Norway to immigrant parents. In 2019 the number have risen to 34,112. Socioeconomics According to Statistics Norway, as of 2012-2014, the percentage of Syria-born immigrants in Norway with a persistently low income averaged out at 52.8%. This was a higher proportion than the native population and many other immigrant groups, largely because most Syrian individuals arrived as asylum immigrants, who tend to have lower incomes. The percentage of Syria-born immigrants with a persistently low income has also steadily declined the longer that the individuals have resided in Norway, with proportions of 86.9% among 3 year Syria-born residents, 53.2% among 4-9 year residents, and 38.4% among residents of 10 years or longer. This was relative to immigrant averages of 26.3% overall, 50.3% among 3 year residents, 28.5% among 4-9 year residents, and 20.2% among residents of 10 years or more.

Located in a narrow valley on the banks of the Black River, the town's architecture is primarily reflective of its importance as a manufacturing center in the late 19th and early-to-mid 20th centuries, with a cluster of commercial buildings surrounded by residential and industrial areas. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and enlarged slightly in 1986. Description and history The town of Springfield was first settled by colonists in the 1750s, but significant settlement did not take place until the construction of the Crown Point Road and the end of the French and Indian War in 1762. Its first sawmill was built on the falls of the Black River, near the present downtown. The first bridge spanning the river was built in the 1770s, and the town center grew around that and a growing number of mills. In the late 19th century, the town became a center for the manufacture of precision machine tools. The town suffered repeated disasters by flood and fire, all of which shaped the development of the town center. The historic district extends primarily along Main Street (Vermont Route 106), north from its crossing of the Black River to Elm Hill Street, and several industrial buildings on the west side of the river, notably including a large industrial complex on Pearl Street. It was expanded in 1986 to include the two bridges crossing the river, as well as the dams that provided water power to the town's industries. The commercial and civic heart is at the junction of Main and Park Streets, the latter providing one of the village's river crossings. Commercial buildings are typically one to three stories in height, built of either brick or wood, and there are churches and other civic buildings clustered around Central Square, just north of the junction. The area just across the river is industrial, while residences are mainly found just east of the downtown area See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Windsor County, Vermont References Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont National Register of Historic Places in Windsor County, Vermont Italianate architecture in Vermont Queen Anne architecture in Vermont Springfield, Vermont Historic districts in Windsor County, Vermont ","title":"Springfield Downtown Historic District"},{"id":"51455174","text":"Frida Anders√©n (born 9 June 1990) is a Swedish Olympic eventing rider.

The building was partially destroyed later during the Turkish occupation. In the eighteenth century the church was restored in the Romanesque and Gothic styles, the surviving baroque elements were eliminated in the restoration of 1907-1910. Between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the cathedral hosted musical events such as concerts of works by famous European composers such as Mozart, Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven. In 1981 the cathedral was elevated by Pope John Paul II to the rank of minor basilica.

These spider wasps often hunt huntsman spiders. Description T. analis is a medium-sized to large wasp with females in mainland China measuring between 16 and 21 mm, while the smaller males measure 11 mm in length; island populations tend to be smaller. It is almost completely black except for the last four, in females, or last five , in males, metasomal segments, which are bright orange or red and give rise to the common name, red-tailed spider wasp. left Biology T. anailis preys on spiders from the families Sparassidae, Agelenidae, and Amaurobiidae. In Japan, Heteropoda venatoria has been recorded being preyed on by this species. The wasp can easily penetrate the most complex webs and the prey is flushed and pursued; the web does provide some protection for the spider, but the wasp persists in attacking until the spider drops out of the web to the ground, where the wasp stings and paralyses the spider. Once captured, the prey is dragged backwards by its pedipalps, sometimes leaving the prey to inspect either the route or the nest at which point the prey could be kleptoparasitised by other females of T. analis, although females will fight to defend their prey in these circumstances. The prey is placed in a conical cavity excavated by the female, which may fold its legs to fit it in, and once oviposition has taken place the spoil is used to cover the nest, although pre-existing cavities may also be used. As in other spider wasps, the males often patrol the nesting areas so that they can mate with the newly emerged females. Irenangelus luzonensis is recorded as kleptoparasitising T. analis in the Philippines, while other species of Irenangelus are also recorded as kleptoprarasites of T. analis. Tachinid flies are known to attack and consume spiders which have been immobilised by T. analis, and scuttle flies and satellite flies may also consume spiders preyed on by these wasps. Distribution T. analis is a widespread species, being found from the Nansei Islands of Japan through Taiwan and the Philippines and across southeast and southern Asia; it is also found in Hawaii.

After a great fire of 1064 was carried out construction of the Romanesque basilica, with the participation of Italian architects. In the Middle Ages, the church was enlarged with two lateral towers and Gothic chapels. After the damage and degradation caused by the Turkish occupation (1543-1686) there were attempts to restore the building. The neo-Romanesque appearance today is the result of the reconstruction carried out between 1882 and 1891, faithfully fulfilled the original plans of the cathedral architect Friedrich von Schmidt Viennese.

The park is named after the song \\"The Maple Leaf Forever\\" composed by Alexander Muir. The park was created in 1933 by public subscription to honour the composer, and is located in Leslieville south of Queen Street East between Leslie Street and Greenwood Avenue. Park features The main features of the park, all related to Alexander Muir, are: * Maple Cottage, allegedly Muir's former residence, built circa 1871. * The remains of a 150-year old silver maple that allegedly inspired Muir to write the song: The tree was felled by a wind storm on July 19, 2013, and only its lower trunk remains at the north- east corner of the front yard of Maple Cottage. Prior to the wind storm, the tree was dying. * A young silver maple that is the offspring of Muir's tree: Seeing that the 150-year old maple was dying, a couple living in The Beaches acquired more than a dozen maple keys from the tree; only one survived which the couple raised in their backyard. In 2007, the young tree was transplanted into the middle of Maple Leaf Forever Park where it can be seen today. In the front yard of Maple Cottage, there is a plaque commemorating Muir and his song. It was erected in 1958 by the Grand Orange Lodge to replace an earlier plaque erected in 1930. Legend Plaque erected by the Orange Lodge in 1958 supporting the legend According to legend, Alexander Muir was the owner of Maple Cottage when he composed the song \\"The Maple Leaf Forever\\" in 1867. He was inspired to write the song when he saw a leaf fall from the silver maple tree standing in front of the cottage. Unlike local residents, historians are skeptical that the 150-year-old tree at Maple Cottage was the inspiration for Muir‚Äôs song. George Leslie, after whom Leslieville is named, wrote in a local newspaper that he and Muir were walking together when a maple leaf landed on Leslie's arm. Leslie turned to Muir and suggested he write a poem about the maple leaf. Leslie recalled the location was on Queen Street East rather than on Laing Street where the alleged tree of inspiration grew. In January 2009, Muir's widow told a similar version of the story to John Ross Robertson, who wrote a chapter on Muir in his book \\"Landmarks of Toronto\\". According to Robin Elliott, editor of the Institute for Canadian Music, the 1930 Orange Lodge plaque may be the first mention of the Maple Cottage tree being the inspiration for \\"The Maple Leaf for Ever.\\" Elliott casts doubt that Muir ever lived at Maple Cottage citing John Ross Robertson's 1914 book Landmarks of Toronto which details Muir's residences from the age of three to his death but makes no mention of 62 Laing Street. However, the book cited 2 nearby residences where Muir dwelled between 1863 and 1869. Also, according to the Toronto Historical Board, the cottage was built in 1873 ‚Äì 6 years after the song was composed in October 1867. In 1991, the provincial Conservation Review Board recommended the \\"designation of the property at 62 Laing Street as a property of historical value or interest\\"; however, it noted that Maple Cottage was built in 1871 after the composition of the song. The board also wrote: \\"In assessing the evidence that was presented in favour of designation, this Board is aware that there are many gaps that cast some doubt on the historical testimony\\".  In 1991, John J.G. Blumenson, Preservation Officer, Toronto Historical Board, described Maple Cottage as: :A variant on the Ontario cottage style with a central gable, the 1873 structure, one of the earliest in the neighbourhood, is a rare example of early residential construction in the area. The house is a one-and-one-half storey frame and brick cottage on a raised foundation. On the facade, the doorway is flanked by large sash windows. These windows are also found in the north and south sides. A verandah runs the full length of the ground floor facade. The original house, however, has been altered. The roofline was changed when the gable was truncated, much of the original detailing of the verandah has been removed; the sides were bricked some years after construction; the door was replaced. Two rear additions to the house were built one about 1900 and another later still. The fence was built sometime in the 1950s. Maple Cottage became a community centre in 2002. At that time, the cottage had a large meeting room, two offices, a kitchen, and a smaller room.

Personal life Roger Morgan Spanswick was born on June 24, 1939 in Barford St. John and St. Michael, Oxfordshire, England. He was the son of Lucy and Arthur Spanswick. Roger married Helen Walker in 1963. Andrew Spanswick and Robert Spanswick are their sons. Roger died at his hillside home overlooking Cayuga Lake on February 12, 2014. His gravestone in Pleasant Grove Cemetery in Ithaca, New York has the phrase only connect from the book Howards End engraved on it. University life In 1960 Roger graduated from the University of Birmingham with an honours degree in physics. He received a Diploma in Biophysics with Jack Dainty and then a Ph.D. in Biophysics with E. J. Williams at the Department of Biophysics in the University of Edinburgh in 1964. Roger then moved to Cambridge University where he was Enid MacRobbie‚Äôs first postdoc. Enid MacRobbie reported that Roger played a huge part in the development of the Plant Biophysics group, and his legacy and legend lasted for years. It was one of the best and most stimulating periods in my group said Enid and Roger played a key role in this. Roger Spanswick joined the plant physiology group at Cornell University that included Andr√© Jagendorf, Rod Clayton, and Peter J. Davies. Roger became an Assistant Professor of Plant Physiology in 1967, an Association Professor in 1973, and a Full Professor in 1979. Roger Spanswick was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1980-81 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the World Innovation Foundation in 2004. Roger was a great mentor and an active member of the Friday Lunch Club, which included A. Carl Leopold, Randy Wayne and Michael Rutzke. A symposium celebrating his life was held at Cornell University on June 2, 2014. Spanswick's unfunded grant proposals, which are rich in ideas, as well as his personal collection of materials concerning the history of the Genomics Initiative are available in the Cornell University Archives (collection number #21-51-4251). Research Roger's highly cited research focused on various aspects of ion transport. He proved the presence of an electrogenic ion pump in plant cells. Subsequent biochemical work led to the identification of proton transport ATPases at the plasma membrane and vacuolar membranes. Along with Christopher Faraday, he discovered a membrane skeleton in plants. Enid MacRobbie characterized Roger Spanswick‚Äôs scientific legacy as follows: Roger made major contributions to our understanding of basic ion transport processes in plants, and was a true pioneer. He was both a very original thinker and a very versatile, thorough and careful experimentalist. He initiated a revolution in our understanding of ion transport in plant cells. His demonstration (in 1972) that the most important transport system in the plasmalemma of Characean cells is a proton-pumping ATPase, generating membrane potentials well negative of the potassium equilibrium potential, was a major advance‚Ä¶ Previously plant physiologists had assumed that plant cells were like animal cells, with an ATP-dependent sodium-potassium exchange pump as the major process of active ion transport. There was opposition to this new view, but by the time of his review in the 1981 Annual Review of Plant Physiology further experimental work made it clear that he was right. In the period of the 1970s and 1980s he continued to make major contributions to the new thinking. He showed that two distinct proton pumping ATPases were present in plasmalemma and tonoplast, with different inhibitor characteristics. He also showed that the gradients of pH and membrane potential generated by the primary proton pump in the plasmalemma could be used to drive secondary active transport of other solutes, sugars, amino acids and other ions. Thus his original idea led to a very large volume of experimental work, in which he also had a major input, and the consequence was a revolution in the field. He later went on to work successfully on more applied problems over a wide range of topics, but it is important to recognize the lasting legacy of his work in the field of basic ion transport. Spanswick also pioneered the use of electrophysiological methods to investigate intercellular transport through plasmodesmata. Books *Spanswick, R. M., W. J. Lucas, and J. Dainty, eds.

Demographics Population of Syrian origin in Denmark by sex, yearly fourth quarter 2008-2017 (Statistics Denmark). Syrians in Denmark arrived primarily as asylum seekers after the Syrian civil war. According to Statistics Denmark, as of 2017, there are a total 40,477 persons of Syrian origin living in Denmark. Of those individuals, 35,262 are Syria-born immigrants and 5,215 are descendants of Syria-born persons. 33,283 individuals are citizens of Syria (18,726 men, 14,557 women). As of 2016, a total of 2,955 Syria-born persons have been granted residence permits in Denmark for family reunification, 5,300 for asylum, 7 for study, 14 for work, 2 for EU/EEA residing family members, 4 for adoption, and 124 for other reasons. Syrian residents are generally young, with most belonging to the 5-9 years (5,371 individuals), 0-4 years (5,352 individuals), 30-34 years (4,294 individuals), 10-14 years (4,167 individuals), and 25-29 years (4,029 individuals) age groups. Socioeconomics According to Statistics Denmark, as of 2016, among Syria-born adults aged 30-59 in Denmark, around 87% of men and 94% of women live full-time in public housing units. This is because many arrived via family reunification or as refugees, and such immigrants usually settle in government-owned properties. Syrians primarily inhabit the regions of Syddanmark (11,345), Midtjylland (10,837), Hovedstaden (7,349), Sj√¶lland (6,901), and Nordjylland (4,045), and the cities of Aarhus (1,910), Copenhagen (1,471), Odense (1,161), and Vejle (1,068). According to Statistics Denmark, as of 2016, male immigrants from Syria aged 20-59 have an annual income of just over 150,000 Danish krone before taxation. Most of that income comprises public transfers, with the remainder consisting of earned income, investment income and second income. As of 2017, a total of 17,451 persons of Syrian origin in Denmark received public benefits. Of these individuals, the government funds were primarily allocated toward guidance and activities upgrading skills (5,666 persons), social benefits (3,747 persons), net unemployment (2,820 persons), subsidized employment (2,575 persons), the Danish State Education Grant and Loan Scheme Authority (2,138 persons), disability pension (412), job-based sickness benefits (50 persons), maternity benefits (38 persons), persons receiving holiday benefits (3 persons), and early retirement pay (1 person). = Crime = According to Statistics Denmark, Syrian migrants and their descendants are over-represented as perpetrators of crime. Male Syrian descendants are about 15 times more likely to commit violent crime. As of 2016, Syria-born male immigrants in Denmark aged 15-79 have a total crime index of 97 when adjusted for age only, with an adjustment of 61 for age and socioeconomic status. Their male descendants have a total crime index of 300 when adjusted for age only, with adjustments of 293 for age and socioeconomic status, 241 for age and family education, and 239 for age and family income. With regard to type of infringement, the male descendants of Syria-born individuals have a penal code crime index of 475 when adjusted for age only (with adjustments of 400 for age and socioeconomic status, 304 age and family education, and 278 for age and family income), of which the crime index when adjusted for age only is 552 for violent offences (with adjustments of 465 for age and socioeconomic status, 343 age and family education, and 319 for age and family income) and 421 for property offences (with adjustments of 356 for age and socioeconomic status, 268 age and family education, and 240 for age and family income).

The average crime index among the general Danish population is set at 100 and percentage points above or below that baseline reflect greater or lesser prevalence, depending on a population's most common age group and its relative socioeconomic status. As of 2016, a total of 1,033 persons of Syrian origin were found guilty of crimes. Of these individuals, 923 were males and 110 were females, with males between the ages of 15-29 years (465 individuals) and 30-49 years (407 individuals) constituting most of the total. The most common types of offences were violations of traffic law (602 individuals, of which 570 breached the Road Traffic Act), followed by violations of the penal code (269 individuals, of which 176 made offences against property) and special laws (238 individuals, of which 117 breached other special laws). Most of the persons received a fine (869 individuals), with the remainder given unsuspended imprisonment (75 individuals), suspended imprisonment (71 individuals), withdrawal of charges (8 individuals), no charges (5 individuals), other decisions (3 individuals), or preventive measures (2 individuals). Employment According to Statistics Denmark, as of 2014, Syria-born immigrants aged 30-64 in Denmark have an employment rate of approximately 14%. Syria-born individuals aged 16-64 also have a self- employment rate of around 14%. According to the Institute of Labor Economics, as of 2014, Syria-born residents in Denmark have an employment population ratio of about 28%. They also have an unemployment rate of roughly 13%. \\\\- cf.

A similar law, the Act in Relation to Service, which had made slavery legal in the territory, had been passed on February 4, 1852. Background Although illegal throughout Mexico, the Indian slave trade was well established when the Mormon pioneers arrived in Utah. At the encouragement of Mormon leaders, the Mormon pioneers began buying Indian slaves. They also acquired other prisoners through wars such as Battle at Fort Utah. At the end of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Utah became a part of the United States, and the issue of slavery in the new territories became a highly political subject. Finally, members of Congress passed the Compromise of 1850, which allowed the Territories of Utah and New Mexico to choose by popular sovereignty whether to make slavery legal in those territories. Brigham Young began seeking to stop the Mexican slave trade while encouraging the local market, and notified the Mexicans. Many of Walker's Band were upset by the interruption with the Mexican slave trade. In one graphic incident, Ute Indian Chief Arrapine, a brother of Chief Walkara, insisted that because the Mormons had stopped the Mexicans from buying these children, the Mormons were obligated to purchase them. In his book, Forty Years Among the Indians, Daniel Jones wrote, \\"[s]everal of us were present when he took one of these children by the heels and dashed its brains out on the hard ground, after which he threw the body towards us, telling us we had no hearts, or we would have bought it and saved its life.\\" In 1851, Don Pedro Leon Lujan, who had been trading slaves with a New Mexico license, sought a Utah license from Brigham Young but he refused. Later, Lujan was discovered with Indian slaves and was charged with trading with Indians without a license. The trial was in progress and the ambiguous status of slavery had become an issue in the trial.  Reasoning for act  While the Mormons were not opposed to using the slaves for their own purposes, they opposed the harsh conditions of Mexican slavery. On January 5, 1852, Brigham Young addressed the joint session of the Utah Territory legislature. He discussed the ongoing trial of Don Pedro Leon Lujan and the importance of explicitly indicating the true policy for slavery in Utah. He explained that although he didn't think people should be treated as property, he felt because Indians were so low and degraded, that transferring them to \\"the more favored portions of the human race\\", would be a benefit and relief. He argued that it is proper for persons thus purchased to owe a debt to the man or woman who saved them, and that it was \\"necessary that some law should provide for the suitable regulations under which all such indebtedness should be defrayed\\". He said this was superior to drudgery of Mexican slavery, because the Mexicans were \\"scarcely superior\\" to the Indians. He argued that this type of service was necessary and honorable to improve the condition of Indians.  Passing of the act  The Legislative Assembly of the Territory of Utah legalized slavery in February 1852 and dealt with Indian slavery in March 1852. The act was divided into four sections. The first section required that an Indian slave be in possession of a white person and be either a prisoner, a woman or a child. The prospective slave owner would bring the slave to the probate judge, who was then required to verify the slave owner was \\"properly qualified to raise or retain said Indian\\". If approved, the slave was then bound for up to twenty years. This could be renewed. The second section mandated that the probate officer record the slave's name, age, place of birth, name of parents, tribe, name of slave owner, name of slave trader, and date of being bound. The third section gave the probate officer power to obtain additional Indian prisoners and find slave owners for them. The fourth section required the master to send children between the ages of seven and sixteen years to school for a period of three months each year if a school was available. Masters were also required to clothe them \\"in a comfortable and becoming manner, according to his, said master‚Äôs, condition in life.\\" Masters were answerable to the probate judge for the treatment of these slaves. The total education requirement was significantly greater than for blacks, and slightly less than white indentured servants, whose masters were required to send them to school at age six.  Effects of the act  As a result of this act, many Mormon families took small Indian children into their homes to protect them from Mexican slavery or from being left destitute. John D. Lee, for example, wrote in his journal about a group of Indians who \\"brought me two more girls for which I gave them two horses. I named the girls Annette and Elnora.\\" This act concerned the Republican Party, who had made anti-slavery one of the pillars of their platform. While considering appropriations for Utah Territory, Representative Justin Smith Morrill criticized The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for its laws on Indian slavery. He said that the laws were unconcerned about the way the Indian slaves were captured, noting that the only requirement was that the Indian be possessed by a white person through purchase or otherwise. He said that Utah was the only American government to enslave Indians, and said that state-sanctioned slavery \\"is a dreg placed at the bottom of the cup by Utah alone\\". The Republicans' abhorrence of slavery in Utah delayed Utah's entrance as a state into the Union. In 1857, Representative Justin Smith Morrill estimated that there were 400 Indian slaves in Utah. Richard Kitchen has identified at least 400 Indian slaves taken into Mormon homes, but estimates, even more, went unrecorded because of the high mortality rate of Indian slaves. Many of them tried to escape.  Similar acts  On the following day, March 8, 1852, the Act in relation to the assembling of Indians was passed, which prohibited the assembling of Indians near white settlements.

Biography  Ruth Anna Jacobs was born in Berlin on 20 September 1927. Her father, born Karl Adolf Rudolf Hermann Jacobs in 1901 in Gotha, was Hermann Jacobs, the great great grandson of the German scholar Friedrich Jacobs.Deutsches Geschlechterbuch, vol. 214, Limburg 2002, p. 267-946 Her mother Marie Jacobs, born Marie Kohn in 1901, was the daughter of Hans Nathan Kohn, the German physician after whom the \\"Pores of Kohn\\" were named. Ruth was the couple's only child. Ruth Jacob's parents were, respectively, Jewish and Christian by birth, but saw themselves as atheists. When she was five years old, she was sent to live with her Christian grandparents when her anti-Nazi parents went into hiding. Ruth Anna emigrated to the United States in 1948, aged 21, where she was finally reunited with her parents in Los Angeles. Her father, having been a well-known Communist in Germany and thus fearful of deportation from the US, had changed his name to 'Martin Hall'. And Ruth went by this surname as a young adult though, as she would tell her family, she did not legally change her birth name before marriage. She studied chemistry at UCLA, obtaining a B.S. degree in 1954. During her undergraduate studies she \\"fell in love with Philosophy of Science.\\" And she would go on to gain a Ph.D. in philosophy at UCLA in 1962 with a dissertation on \\"The Interpretation of Theoretical Statements\\" written under the supervision of Rudolf Carnap. After three years as Acting Assistant Professor in Philosophy at the University of Oregon, Ruth Anna moved to Wellesley College as a lecturer in 1963, and taught there until 1998, becoming Professor of Philosophy, and serving as chair of the Department of Philosophy in 1979‚Äì1982 and 1990‚Äì1993. In retirement she held the title of Professor Emerita. Much of her work focused on the philosopher William James and she edited (and contributed to) The Cambridge Companion to William James (1997). She also worked on John Dewey. She married the philosopher Hilary Putnam on August 11, 1962. Both brought up by atheist parents, they decided to bring their children up as a Jewish family. Ruth had her bat mitzvah in 1998, saying that it sent the message that \\"We are not going to finish Hitler's work for him. We are not going to assimilate\\". At the time of Hilary's death, age 89, in 2016 they had two daughters, two sons and four granddaughters. In 2017 a book collecting articles on pragmatism by both Ruth Anna and Hilary Putnam was published under the title Pragmatism as a Way of Life: The Lasting Legacy of William James and John Dewey. In its introduction, the volume's editor David Macarthur of the University of Sydney hailed her as \\"an internationally renowned interpreter of James‚Äôs and Dewey‚Äôs visions of pragmatism.‚Äù Ruth Putnam died at her home on 4 May 2019, aged 91 of complications from Parkinson's disease.

Goytain and Quamme identified a Mg2+--related transporter whose expression or function was affected by an implantation-associated protein precursor. They designated this protein, MagT1. MagT1 is expressed as a 335 amino acid polypeptide which includes five transmembrane helices. The nascent polypeptide possesses a cleavage site after the N-terminal signal sequence helix, rendering a mature MagT1 protein with four transmembrane helices. MagT1 additionally contains a number of phosphorylation sites. Recent evidence demonstrates that the primary function of MagT1 is protein glycosylation, mediated by MagT1's function as a component of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST).  Function  When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, MagT1 mediates saturable Mg2+ uptake with a Km of 0.23 mM. Transport of Mg2+ by MagT1 is rheogenic, voltage-dependent, and does not display time-dependent inactivation. Transport is specific to Mg2+, as other divalent cations do not evoke currents. Large external concentrations of some cations inhibited Mg2+ transport (Ni2+, Zn2+, Mn2+) in MagT1-expressing oocytes although Ca2+and Fe2+ were without effect. MagT1 has an N-terminal thioredoxin domain of unknown function. Zhou and Clapham identified two mammalian genes, MagT1 and TUSC3, catalyzing Mg2+ influx. MagT1 is universally expressed in all human tissues, and its expression level is upregulated in low extracellular Mg2+. Knockdown of either MagT1 or TUSC3 protein lowered the total and free intracellular Mg2+concentrations in mammalian cell lines. Morpholino knockdown of MagT1 and TUSC3 protein expression in zebrafish embryos resulted in early developmental arrest; excess Mg2+ or supplementation with mammalian mRNAs rescued these effects. Thus, MagT1 and TUSC3 are vertebrate plasma membrane Mg2+ transport system.  Transport reaction  The reaction catalyzed by MagT1, or a potential downstream glycosylation target (e.g. a Mg2+ transporter), is: : Mg2+ (out) ‚Üí Mg2+ (in)  Role in magnesium deficiency  The identification of genetic changes and their functional consequences in patients with immunodeficiency resulting from loss of MAGT1 revealed that magnesium and MagT1 are key molecular players for T cell-mediated immune responses. This led to the description of XMEN (X-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect, Epstein- Barr Virus infection, and neoplasia) syndrome, for which Mg2+ supplementation has been shown to be beneficial. Similarly, the identification of copy-number variation leading to dysfunctional MAGT1 in a family with atypical ATR-X syndrome and skin abnormalities, suggested that the MAGT1 defect is responsible for the cutaneous problems.  Role in protein glycosylation  MagT1 and its homologue TUSC3 are both bona fide components of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST).

It is a rendering of one common vocalization for a six-note musical figure which is associated with children, is found in many European-derived cultures and is often used in taunting. Variations \\"Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah\\" is seen particularly in the eastern United States and modern Britain. There are many other vocalizations for the tune, as well as other ways of rendering the nyah- nyah version (such as \\"Nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh\\"). Other manifestations include: *\\"Neener neener neener\\" in the United States *\\"Nanny nanny boo boo\\" in the Southern United States *\\"Na-na na-na boo-boo\\" in the United States *\\"Du kan ikke fange mig\\" in Denmark (meaning \\"You can't catch me\\") *\\"Na na na na n√®re\\" (also \\"nananan√®re\\") in France *\\"Naa na na naa na\\" in the Netherlands *\\"Na-na-na banana\\" in Israel *\\"–•–∞ —Ö–∞-—Ö–∞ —Ö–∞-—Ö–∞ —Ö–∞\\" in Russia *\\"L√§l-l√§l-l√§l-l√§l lie-ru\\" in Finland *\\"Skvallerbytta bing b√•ng\\" (meaning \\"Gossipmonger ding dong\\") or \\"Du kan inte ta mig\\" in Sweden (meaning \\"You can't catch me\\") *\\"√Üdda b√¶dda buse\\" in Norway The tune is also seen in Canada, Australia, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Scotland, Poland, and Iceland. Children in Korea use a different figure for teasing, la-so-la-so mi-re-mi-re with the vocalization ÏñºÎ†àÎ¶¨ Íº¥Î†àÎ¶¨ (eol-re-ri kkol-re-ri) while a Japanese variant is so-so-mi-mi so-mi-mi and in Mexico a so-la-so-mi, so-la- so-mi figure is found. The initial taunt is sometimes followed by further verses using the same tune, for instance in America \\"Nanny nanny nanny goat, cannot catch a billy goat\\" or following \\"Nanny nanny boo boo\\" with \\"Stick your head in doo-doo\\". French children might follow \\"Na na na na n√®re\\" with \\"Pouette pouette camembert\\". In Croatia, children sing \\"Ulovi me, ulovi me, kupit ƒáu ti novine. Novine su skupe, poljubi me u dupe\\" (which means: \\"Catch me, catch me, [if you do that] I'll buy you a newspaper. Newspapers are pricey, kiss my tushie\\"). While the word \\"nyah\\" is now defined as being in and of itself an expression of contemptuous superiority over another, this is by derivation from the \\"nyah-nyah...\\" chant rather than vice versa so the \\"nyah- nyah...\\" vocalization version of the chant is, at least in origin, an example of communication entirely by paralanguage. Context-meaningful words are sometimes applied ad hoc, though, such as \\"Johnny is a sis-sy\\" or \\"I can see your underwear!\\" Shirley Jackson referred to it as the \\"da da, da-da da\\" or \\"I know a secret\\" chant in Life Among the Savages.Shirley Jackson, Life Among the Savages. Farrar Straus Giroux, 1963. Other uses Non-taunting uses are also seen, also associated with children. One tune for Ring a Ring o' Roses (which is sung to many variant tunes) uses the \\"Nyah nyah...\\" musical figure; a common tune for Bye, baby Bunting uses a similar figure, and one for Olly olly in free does also. Benjamin Britten used the figure in his 1946 opera The Rape of Lucretia for a scene where the Roman and Etruscan generals mock each other.
