It was written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon, and first broadcast on September 29, 1998. The episode marks a significant emotional journey for Buffy as she has cast off her slayer identity along with her friends in Sunnydale. In the episode, Buffy - living a secluded life away from her previous life - helps some unknown strangers find their lost loved ones. Meanwhile, Buffy has to decide whether she is ready to find herself again. This episode forms part of a larger study of personal and alternate identities which characterises all seven seasons of the show.  Plot  Due to Buffy's trauma from season 2, including her expulsion of school, the murder of her boyfriend Angel and fighting with her Mother Joyce, Buffy has skipped Sunnydale and moved to L.A. Buffy works as a diner waitress under her middle name, \\"Anne\\". She serves Lily and Rickie, a young couple living on the streets, who have just gotten a complementary set of distinctive tattoos. As Buffy walks the street a homeless woman is muttering \\"I'm no one\\". Later that evening Lily approaches Buffy and reveals that she remembers her from an earlier episode, when Lily was known as \\"Chanterelle\\". As they talk, a man bumps through, an mutters \\"I'm no one\\" as he walks out into traffic and is nearly hit by a car, only saved by Buffy's quick response. Buffy runs into a man named Ken, who comments on her \\"lost\\" state and offers to befriend her. The next day Lily tells Buffy that Rickie has disappeared. Buffy reluctantly agrees to help find him. In her search, she finds the body of an elderly homeless man with Rickie's tattoo. Buffy reports her findings to Lily, who doesn't believe that the body could be Rickie's. On the street Lily meets Ken, who claims to know Rickie, so she eagerly goes with him. Buffy interrogates a blood bank worker who has been acting suspiciously, and learns that the woman has been giving Ken the names of healthy homeless people who come in to donate blood. Meanwhile, Ken has prepared Lily for a \\"cleansing,\\" which entails stepping into a bath in the floor. Lily hesitates, as the bath looks like black oil. At the door, Buffy attempts to pass herself off as a sinner wanting a new chance, but ends up kicking her way into the building in time to see Lily dragged into the pool. Buffy and Ken wrestle and they both fall in, coming out below in a huge factory. Ken's human mask falls off, revealing him to be a demon. Buffy and Lily are now amongst many other slave laborers of varying ages. Ken tells Buffy and Lily that they are in a hell dimension where time passes very quickly: a hundred years there equals only one day in Los Angeles. Since he only picks people who no one will miss, they will have worked themselves to a used-up death of old age without anyone noticing their absence. He tells Lily that Rickie remembered her, even after he had forgotten his own name. Lily resigns herself to ending up in hell, and accepts her fate passively. Ken lines the captives up and each one is asked, \\"Who are you?\\" and then bludgeoned unless they answer \\"I'm no one.\\" When it is Buffy's turn, she says her name with pride and a battle ensues until Ken threatens Lily at knifepoint. Ken delivers a speech, but Lily pushes him off the ledge onto a concrete floor. Lily then leads the captives back up through the pool as Buffy dispatches Ken. Once all of the humans are out of the demonic dimension, the pool gateway closes. Back in her apartment, Buffy packs her bag, ready to return to Sunnydale. She gives Lily her \\"Anne\\" identity. The episode ends with Buffy being embraced by her relieved mother.  Production  Seth Green is added to the title credits between David Boreanaz and Anthony Stewart Head. Reception Noel Murray of The A.V. Club described \\"Anne\\" as \\"a very clever meditation on adolescent identity\\". The scene where Anne asserts her identity as Buffy was frequently used as a promotional clip for reruns of the series on the FX channel.

After Grace's death, Wright was cared for by a nanny, until his father made a trip to Omaha and returned with a young wife, Gertrude. In Will's Boy, Morris states, \\"Gertrude was closer to my age than to my father's\\". Gertrude hated small-town life, but got along famously with Wright, as they shared many of the same childish tastes (both loved games, movies, and ice cream). In 1919, the family moved to Omaha, where they resided until 1924. During that interlude, Morris spent two summers on his uncle's farm near Norfolk, Nebraska. Photographs of the farm, as well as the real-life characters of Uncle Harry and Aunt Clara, appear in Morris's books.

Many areas of the arts and sciences were influenced, notably by the spread of Renaissance humanism to the various German states and principalities. There were many advances made in the fields of architecture, the arts, and the sciences. Germany produced two developments that were to dominate the 16th century all over Europe: printing and the Protestant Reformation. One of the most important German humanists was Konrad Celtis (1459‚Äì1508). Celtis studied at Cologne and Heidelberg, and later travelled throughout Italy collecting Latin and Greek manuscripts. Heavily influenced by Tacitus, he used the Germania to introduce German history and geography. Eventually he devoted his time to poetry, in which he praised Germany in Latin. Another important figure was Johann Reuchlin (1455‚Äì1522) who studied in various places in Italy and later taught Greek. He studied the Hebrew language, aiming to purify Christianity, but encountered resistance from the church. The most significant German Renaissance artist is Albrecht D√ºrer especially known for his printmaking in woodcut and engraving, which spread all over Europe, drawings, and painted portraits. Important architecture of this period includes the Landshut Residence, Heidelberg Castle, the Augsburg Town Hall as well as the Antiquarium of the Munich Residenz in Munich, the largest Renaissance hall north of the Alps.Munich Residenz  Background  The Renaissance was largely driven by the renewed interest in classical learning, and was also the result of rapid economic development. At the beginning of the 16th century, Germany (referring to the lands contained within the Holy Roman Empire) was one of the most prosperous areas in Europe despite a relatively low level of urbanization compared to Italy or the Netherlands.German economic growth, 1500‚Äì1850, Ulrich Pfister It benefited from the wealth of certain sectors such as metallurgy, mining, banking and textiles. More importantly, book-printing developed in Germany, and German printers dominated the new book-trade in most other countries until well into the 16th century.  Art  The Heller altar by Albrecht D√ºrer The concept of the Northern Renaissance or German Renaissance is somewhat confused by the continuation of the use of elaborate Gothic ornament until well into the 16th century, even in works that are undoubtedly Renaissance in their treatment of the human figure and other respects. Classical ornament had little historical resonance in much of Germany, but in other respects Germany was very quick to follow developments, especially in adopting printing with movable type, a German invention that remained almost a German monopoly for some decades, and was first brought to most of Europe, including France and Italy, by Germans. Printmaking by woodcut and engraving was already more developed in Germany and the Low Countries than elsewhere in Europe, and the Germans took the lead in developing book illustrations, typically of a relatively low artistic standard, but seen all over Europe, with the woodblocks often being lent to printers of editions in other cities or languages. The greatest artist of the German Renaissance, Albrecht D√ºrer, began his career as an apprentice to a leading workshop in Nuremberg, that of Michael Wolgemut, who had largely abandoned his painting to exploit the new medium. D√ºrer worked on the most extravagantly illustrated book of the period, the Nuremberg Chronicle, published by his godfather Anton Koberger, Europe's largest printer-publisher at the time.Bartrum (2002) After completing his apprenticeship in 1490, D√ºrer travelled in Germany for four years, and Italy for a few months, before establishing his own workshop in Nuremberg. He rapidly became famous all over Europe for his energetic and balanced woodcuts and engravings, while also painting. Though retaining a distinctively German style, his work shows strong Italian influence, and is often taken to represent the start of the German Renaissance in visual art, which for the next forty years replaced the Netherlands and France as the area producing the greatest innovation in Northern European art. D√ºrer supported Martin Luther but continued to create Madonnas and other Catholic imagery, and paint portraits of leaders on both sides of the emerging split of the Protestant Reformation. \\"The Crucifixion\\", central panel of the Isenheim Altarpiece by Matthias Gr√ºnewald. D√ºrer died in 1528, before it was clear that the split of the Reformation had become permanent, but his pupils of the following generation were unable to avoid taking sides. Most leading German artists became Protestants, but this deprived them of painting most religious works, previously the mainstay of artists' revenue. Martin Luther had objected to much Catholic imagery, but not to imagery itself, and Lucas Cranach the Elder, a close friend of Luther, had painted a number of \\"Lutheran altarpieces\\", mostly showing the Last Supper, some with portraits of the leading Protestant divines as the Twelve Apostles. This phase of Lutheran art was over before 1550, probably under the more fiercely aniconic influence of Calvinism, and religious works for public display virtually ceased to be produced in Protestant areas. Presumably largely because of this, the development of German art had virtually ceased by about 1550, but in the preceding decades German artists had been very fertile in developing alternative subjects to replace the gap in their order books. Cranach, apart from portraits, developed a format of thin vertical portraits of provocative nudes, given classical or Biblical titles.Snyder, Part III, Ch. XIX on Cranach, Luther etc. Lying somewhat outside these developments is Matthias Gr√ºnewald, who left very few works, but whose masterpiece, his Isenheim Altarpiece (completed 1515), has been widely regarded as the greatest German Renaissance painting since it was restored to critical attention in the 19th century. It is an intensely emotional work that continues the German Gothic tradition of unrestrained gesture and expression, using Renaissance compositional principles, but all in that most Gothic of forms, the multi-winged triptych.Snyder, Ch. XVII Albrecht Altdorfer (c.1480‚Äì1538), Danube landscape near Regensburg c. 1528, one of the earliest Western pure landscapes, from the Danube School in southern Germany. The Danube School is the name of a circle of artists of the first third of the 16th century in Bavaria and Austria, including Albrecht Altdorfer, Wolf Huber and Augustin Hirschvogel. With Altdorfer in the lead, the school produced the first examples of independent landscape art in the West (nearly 1,000 years after China), in both paintings and prints.Wood, 9 ‚Äì this is the main subject of the whole book Their religious paintings had an expressionist style somewhat similar to Gr√ºnewald's. D√ºrer's pupils Hans Burgkmair and Hans Baldung Grien worked largely in prints, with Baldung developing the topical subject matter of witches in a number of enigmatic prints.Snyder, Ch. XVII, Bartrum, 1995 Hans Holbein the Elder and his brother Sigismund Holbein painted religious works in the late Gothic style. Hans the Elder was a pioneer and leader in the transformation of German art from the Gothic to the Renaissance style. His son, Hans Holbein the Younger was an important painter of portraits and a few religious works, working mainly in England and Switzerland. Holbein's well known series of small woodcuts on the Dance of Death relate to the works of the Little Masters, a group of printmakers who specialized in very small and highly detailed engravings for bourgeois collectors, including many erotic subjects.Snyder, Ch. XX on the Holbeins, Bartrum (1995), 221‚Äì237 on Holbein's prints, 99‚Äì129 on the Little Masters The outstanding achievements of the first half of the 16th century were followed by several decades with a remarkable absence of noteworthy German art, other than accomplished portraits that never rival the achievement of Holbein or D√ºrer. The next significant German artists worked in the rather artificial style of Northern Mannerism, which they had to learn in Italy or Flanders. Hans von Aachen and the Netherlandish Bartholomeus Spranger were the leading painters at the Imperial courts in Vienna and Prague, and the productive Netherlandish Sadeler family of engravers spread out across Germany, among other counties.Trevor-Roper, Levey In Catholic parts of South Germany the Gothic tradition of wood carving continued to flourish until the end of the 18th century, adapting to changes in style through the centuries. Veit Stoss (d. 1533), Tilman Riemenschneider (d.1531) and Peter Vischer the Elder (d. 1529) were D√ºrer's contemporaries, and their long careers covered the transition between the Gothic and Renaissance periods, although their ornament often remained Gothic even after their compositions began to reflect Renaissance principles.Snyder, 298‚Äì311  Architecture  Heidelberg Castle Juleum in Helmstedt (built 1592), an example of Weser Renaissance architecture Renaissance architecture in Germany was inspired first by German philosophers and artists such as Albrecht D√ºrer and Johannes Reuchlin who visited Italy. Important early examples of this period are especially the Landshut Residence, the Castle in Heidelberg, Johannisburg Palace in Aschaffenburg, Schloss Weilburg, the City Hall and Fugger Houses in Augsburg and St. Michael in Munich, the largest Renaissance church north of the Alps. A particular form of Renaissance architecture in Germany is the Weser Renaissance, with prominent examples such as the City Hall of Bremen and the Juleum in Helmstedt. In July 1567 the city council of Cologne approved a design in the Renaissance style by Wilhelm Vernukken for a two storied loggia for Cologne City Hall. St Michael in Munich is the largest Renaissance church north of the Alps. It was built by Duke William V of Bavaria between 1583 and 1597 as a spiritual center for the Counter Reformation and was inspired by the Church of il Ges√π in Rome. The architect is unknown. Many examples of Brick Renaissance buildings can be found in Hanseatic old towns, such as Stralsund, Wismar, L√ºbeck, L√ºneburg, Friedrichstadt and Stade. Notable German Renaissance architects include Friedrich Sustris, Benedikt Rejt, Abraham van den Blocke, Elias Holl and Hans Krumpper.  Influential people  = Johannes Gutenberg (c. 1398‚Äì1468) = Born Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden,Johann Gutenberg at the New Catholic Encyclopedia Johannes Gutenberg is widely considered the most influential person within the German Renaissance. As a free thinker, humanist, and inventor, Gutenberg also grew up within the Renaissance, but influenced it greatly as well. His best-known invention is the printing press in 1440. Gutenberg's press allowed the humanists, reformists, and others to circulate their ideas. He is also known as the creator of the Gutenberg Bible, a crucial work that marked the start of the Gutenberg Revolution and the age of the printed book in the Western world. = Johann Reuchlin (1455‚Äì1522) = Johann Reuchlin was the most important aspect of world culture teaching within Germany at this time. He was a scholar of both Greek and Hebrew. Graduating, then going on to teach at Basel, he was considered extremely intelligent. Yet after leaving Basel, he had to start copying manuscripts and apprenticing within areas of law. However, he is most known for his work within Hebrew studies. Unlike some other \\"thinkers\\" of this time, Reuchlin submerged himself into this, even creating a guide to preaching within the Hebrew faith. The book, titled De Arte Predicandi (1503), is possibly one of his best-known works from this period. = Albrecht D√ºrer (1471‚Äì1528) = Albrecht D√ºrer was at the time, and remains, the most famous artist of the German Renaissance. He was famous across Europe, and greatly admired in Italy, where his work was mainly known through his prints. He successfully integrated an elaborate Northern style with Renaissance harmony and monumentality. Among his best known works are Melencolia I, the Four Horsemen from his woodcut Apocalypse series, and Knight, Death, and the Devil. Other significant artists were Lucas Cranach the Elder, the Danube School and the Little Masters. = Martin Luther (1483‚Äì1546) = Martin Luther was a Protestant Reformer who criticized church practices such as selling indulgences, against which he published in his Ninety-Five Theses of 1517. Luther also translated the Bible into German, making the Christian scriptures more accessible to the general population and inspiring the standardization of the German language.

Although unrelated to true ivy, it is commonly known as Boston ivy, grape ivy, and Japanese ivy, and also as Japanese creeper, and by the name woodbine (though the latter may refer to a number of different vine species). Description It is a deciduous woody vine growing to 30 m tall or more given suitable support, attaching itself by means of numerous small branched tendrils tipped with sticky disks. The leaves are simple, palmately lobed with three lobes, occasionally unlobed or with five lobes, or sufficiently deeply lobed to be palmately compound with (usually) three leaflets; the leaves range from 5 to 22 cm across. The flowers are inconspicuous, greenish, in clusters; the fruit is a small dark blue grape 5‚Äì10 mm diameter. The specific epithet tricuspidata means three-pointed, referring to the leaf shape. Cultivation and uses Like the related Virginia creeper, this plant is widely grown as a climbing ornamental plant to cover the fa√ßades of masonry buildings. This usage is actually economically important because, by shading walls during the summer, it can significantly reduce cooling costs. Boston Ivy is readily distinguished from the Virginia creeper by its simple leaves with pointed lobes (Virginia creeper leaves are divided into five separate leaflets). The plant secretes calcium carbonate, which serves as an adhesive pad and gives it the ability to attach itself to a wall without requiring any additional support. While it does not penetrate the building surface but merely attaches to it, nevertheless damage can occur from attempting to rip the plant from the wall. However, if the plant is killed first, such as by severing the vine from the root, the adhesive pads will eventually deteriorate to the point where the plant can be easily removed without causing any damage to the wall. It is used on the brick outfield walls at Wrigley Field of the Chicago Cubs along with Japanese bittersweet. Cultivars include 'Veitchii'.BBC Plant finder: Boston Ivy Etymology Parthenocissus is derived from the Greek terms (; 'maidenly, chaste, virgin') and (; 'vine') and means approximately 'virgin ivy' (hence the common name 'Virginia creeper'). Tricuspidata means approximately 'with three points' comes from the Greek and Latin prefix ('three') and the Latin ('tipped, pointed').Gledhill, David (2008). \\"The Names of Plants\\".

History Indonesian masked dance predates Hindu-Buddhist influences. Native Indonesian tribes still perform traditional masked-dances to represent nature, as the Hudoq dance of the Dayak people of Kalimantan, or to represent ancestor spirits. With the arrival of Hinduism in the archipelago, the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics began to be performed in masked-dance. The most popular storyline of topeng dance, however, derived from the locally developed Javanese Panji cycles, based on the tales and romance of Prince Panji and Princess Chandra Kirana, set in the 12th-century Kadiri kingdom. One of the earliest written records of topeng dance is found in the 14th-century poem Nagarakretagama, which describes King Hayam Wuruk of Majapahit ‚Äî wearing a golden mask ‚Äî as an accomplished topeng dancer. The current topeng dance form arose in the 15th century in Java and Bali where it remains prevalent, but it is also found in other Indonesian islands ‚Äî such as Madura (near East Java). Various topeng dances and styles have developed in various places in the Indonesian archipelago, notably in Cirebon, Yogyakarta, Malang and Bali. The well-developed topeng technique is now studied in universities in Europe and America. Variations =Balinese topeng= Balinese topeng (dance masks) at Taman Mini Indonesia Indah. It is believed that the use of masks is related to the cult of the ancestors, which considered dancers the interpreters of the gods. Topeng performances open with a series of non-speaking masked characters which may not be related to the story to be performed. These traditional masks often include Topeng Manis (a refined hero), Topeng Kras (a martial, authoritarian character), and Topeng Tua (an old man who may joke and draw out the audience). The story is narrated from a penasar, a jawless half-mask that enables the actor to speak clearly. In group topeng, there are usually two penasars providing two points of view. The performance alternates between speaking and non-speaking characters, and can include dance and fight sequences as well as special effects (sometimes provided by the gamelan). It is almost always wrapped up by a series of comic characters introducing their own views. The narrators and comic characters frequently break Western conventions of storytelling by including current events or local gossip to get a laugh. In topeng, there is a conscious attempt to include many, sometimes contradictory, aspects of the human experience: the sacred and the profane, beauty and ugliness, refinement and caricature.\\"The Secret of Masks\\". Boh√®me Magazine Online. June 2003. . A detailed description and analysis of topeng pajegan, the one-man form of topeng, is available in Masked Performancehttps://www.amazon.com/dp/081221336X by John Emigh, a Western theater professor who has become a performer of Balinese topeng. =Betawi topeng= Betawi topeng dance. Betawi mask dance or tari topeng Betawi is a mask-dance of the Betawi people of Jakarta. =Cirebon topeng= Topeng Kandaga, a Sundanese form of topeng dance. Cirebon mask dance or tari topeng Cirebon is a local indigenous art form of Cirebon in Java, including Indramayu and Jatibarang, West Java and Brebes, Central Java. There is a lot of variety in Cirebon mask dance, both in terms of the dance style and the stories to be conveyed. The mask dance can be performed by solo dancers or it can be performed by several people. Graceful hand and body movements, and musical accompaniment dominated by drums and fiddle, are hallmarks of the art form. Cirebon mask dance might depict the story of Prince Panji from 15th-century East Java, or another Majapahit story. Topeng Klana Kencana Wungu is a Cirebon mask dance in the Parahyangan mask style that depicts the story of Queen Kencana Wungu of Majapahit being chased by the grotesque and rough King Minak Jingga of Blambangan. The Sundanese topeng Kandaga dance is similar to and influenced by Cirebon topeng, where the dancers wear red masks and costumes. =Jogja topeng= Topeng in wayang gedog performance. In Yogyakarta tradition, the mask dance is part of wayang wong performances. Composed and created by Sultan Hamengkubuwono I (1755‚Äì1792), certain characters such as the wanara (monkey) and denawa (giant) in Ramayana and Mahabharata use masks, while the knight and princesses do not wear masks. The punakawan (jester) might use a half-mask (a mask without a jaw) so he can speak freely and clearly. Significantly here, the mustache is painted in black. The Topeng Klono Alus, Topeng Klono Gagah, and Topeng Putri Kenakawulan dances are classical Yogyakarta court dances derived from the story of Raden Panji from the 15th-century Majapahit legacy. The Klono Alus Jungkungmandeya and Klono Gagah Dasawasisa are masked dances adapted from Mahabharata stories. =Topeng in Malang= Malang topeng mass dance. In East Java, topeng dance is called wayang gedog and is the best known art form from East Java's Malang Regency. Wayang gedog theatrical performances include themes from the Panji cycle stories from the kingdom of Janggala, and the players wear masks known as wayang topeng or wayang gedog. The word gedog comes from kedok which, like topeng, means \\"mask\\". These performances center on a love story about Princess Candra Kirana of Kediri and Raden Panji Asmarabangun, the legendary crown prince of Janggala. Candra Kirana was the incarnation of Dewi Ratih (the Hindu goddess of love) and Panji was an incarnation of Kamajaya (the Hindu god of love). Kirana's story has been given the title Smaradahana (\\"The fire of love\\"). At the end of the complicated story they finally marry and bring forth a son named Raja Putra. =Surakarta topeng= The topeng of the Surakarta Sunanate court is similar in style and theme to the Yogyakarta variants. Differences are seen in the craftmanship of masks; facial hair is represented with hair or fibre, while the Yogyakarta style uses black paint. Similarly to Yogyakarta, the Sukarta topeng punakawan (jester) often uses a jawless half- mask.

It expands upon and replaces an earlier soft- cover rulebook entitled Tome and Blood. Contents Complete Arcane presents additional rules and advice for the creation and use of character classes which specialize in arcane magic, which represents magic that is learned through research or inherent power as opposed to divine sources. = New classes = The Complete Arcane introduces three new base classes to the 3rd edition game.  Warlock  A Warlock has been given supernatural powers; either he or his ancestors made a deal with a supernatural being. A warlock has an innate magical ability called the eldritch blast, a damaging ray-like ability. The damage for this attack increases as the warlock gains levels. Instead of spells, warlocks gain a limited number of invocations, spell-like abilities with a distinctively sinister flavor. Most of these invocations may be performed at will, or have durations of 24 hours. Some invocations add effects to the warlock's eldritch blast, causing sicknesss, or blindness, or fright, etc.  Warmage  Warmages take the concept of \\"magical artillery\\" to its extreme. They specialize in direct-damage spells and can wear light armor (and later medium armor) without penalty to their spellcasting. Though they cast spells like a sorcerer, they have a very limited list of spells they can cast.  Wu Jen  Wu jen are arcane spellcasters with a distinct Oriental flavor. Wu Jen specialize in the casting of elemental spells. The five elements of Wu Jen magic are wood, fire, water, earth, and metal.Baker, Richard.

Rich Baker described his creative process on the book: \\"I don't know if I have any one global process for thinking up new stuff. I can offer a little insight into how I derived some of our new material, though. If you look at the various schools of magic, you'll see that Abjuration really gets short shrift in most of our sourcebooks. So, I was determined to look hard at Abjuration spells and see if I couldn't re-envision the abjurer a little bit to make it cooler. It occurred to me that abjuration was the school of magic manipulating magic (for example, dispel magic) . . . which means that abjurers really ought to be the nastiest spell-duelists out there. If you want to build a wizard who specializes in gunslinging against other wizards, Abjuration should be your specialty. That's a pretty cool take on a school of magic that was formerly a little boring and overlooked, so I ran with it. I created a half-dozen key new Abjuration spells to support that vision, spells that screw with the other wizard's defenses and use your enemy's magic against him.\\" Reception Reviews References External links *http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/10/10910.phtml Category:2004 books Category:Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks ","title":"Complete Arcane"},{"id":"2160182","text":"The Wasatch Front 100 Mile Endurance Run (Wasatch) is a 100-mile ultra marathon held annually on the first Friday after Labor Day in the U.S. state of Utah. The slogan of the Wasatch Run is \\"One Hundred Miles of Heaven and Hell.\\" History Wasatch began in 1980 as a challenge for five local runners who were inspired by the Western States, the first of modern-day western 100s. The following year seven runners competed but no one finished. By 1990 the race began regularly hosting more than 100 runners and the number of runners increased to 321 in 2014. Course Wasatch gains cumulatively 24,000 feet in elevation as it traverses the Wasatch Front, commanding vistas of basin and range country, the Great Salt Lake, steep canyons, broad plateaus, and craggy peaks. The course begins east of Kaysville and follows the top of the Wasatch Range before ending in Soldier Hollow. Altitude ranges from 4,700 to 10,460 feet, and temperatures range from 80s in the shade during the day to 20s on the high ridges at night. September weather in Utah can vary widely. Some years heat is a major factor, while in 2010 runners negotiated fresh snow for four miles in the early stages of the race. The fastest runners typically finish the race in 20 hours or so, while the field is given 36 hours to finish the race. For many years Wasatch was regarded as the toughest 100-miler, but with the advent of the Hardrock 100 in Colorado, this has been thrown into some dispute. Some advocates for Wasatch note that Hardrock has a 48-hour cutoff, and therefore is in a different category of event (a quasi multi-day). Both races are undeniably very difficult and pose their own challenges. Course records Geoff Roes holds the men's course record with a finish time of 18:30:55 in 2009. Bethany Lewis holds the women's course record with a time of 22:21:47, which she set in 2014. Grand Slam Runners who complete Wasatch along with the Western States Endurance Run in Northern California, the Vermont 100 Mile Endurance Run in Vermont, and the Leadville Trail 100 in Colorado all in the same summer achieve the Grand Slam of Ultrarunning and are awarded with a sculpted eagle-head trophy. Wasatch is the final of the four races, and, as a result, the Grand Slam award is presented at the post-race Awards Banquet. Wasatch is a part of the Western Slam (Wasatch, the Leadville 100, the Western States Endurance Run, and the Angeles Crest 100), and an optional part of the Rocky Mountain Slam (Hardrock 100, plus three of four of Wasatch, the Bighorn 100, the Bear 100 Mile Endurance Run, or Leadville).

The data is most often salvaged from storage media such as internal or external hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), USB flash drives, magnetic tapes, CDs, DVDs, RAID subsystems, and other electronic devices. Recovery may be required due to physical damage to the storage devices or logical damage to the file system that prevents it from being mounted by the host operating system (OS). The most common data recovery scenario involves an operating system failure, malfunction of a storage device, logical failure of storage devices, accidental damage or deletion, etc. (typically, on a single-drive, single-partition, single-OS system), in which case the ultimate goal is simply to copy all important files from the damaged media to another new drive. This can be easily accomplished using a Live CD or DVD by booting directly from a ROM instead of the corrupted drive in question. Many Live CDs or DVDs provide a means to mount the system drive and backup drives or removable media, and to move the files from the system drive to the backup media with a file manager or optical disc authoring software. Such cases can often be mitigated by disk partitioning and consistently storing valuable data files (or copies of them) on a different partition from the replaceable OS system files. Another scenario involves a drive-level failure, such as a compromised file system or drive partition, or a hard disk drive failure. In any of these cases, the data is not easily read from the media devices. Depending on the situation, solutions involve repairing the logical file system, partition table or master boot record, or updating the firmware or drive recovery techniques ranging from software-based recovery of corrupted data, hardware- and software-based recovery of damaged service areas (also known as the hard disk drive's \\"firmware\\"), to hardware replacement on a physically damaged drive which allows for extraction of data to a new drive. If a drive recovery is necessary, the drive itself has typically failed permanently, and the focus is rather on a one-time recovery, salvaging whatever data can be read. In a third scenario, files have been accidentally \\"deleted\\" from a storage medium by the users. Typically, the contents of deleted files are not removed immediately from the physical drive; instead, references to them in the directory structure are removed, and thereafter space the deleted data occupy is made available for later data overwriting. In the mind of end users, deleted files cannot be discoverable through a standard file manager, but the deleted data still technically exists on the physical drive. In the meantime, the original file contents remain, often in a number of disconnected fragments, and may be recoverable if not overwritten by other data files. The term \\"data recovery\\" is also used in the context of forensic applications or espionage, where data which have been encrypted or hidden, rather than damaged, are recovered. Sometimes data present in the computer gets encrypted or hidden due to reasons like virus attack which can only be recovered by some computer forensic experts. Physical damage A wide variety of failures can cause physical damage to storage media, which may result from human errors and natural disasters. CD- ROMs can have their metallic substrate or dye layer scratched off; hard disks can suffer from a multitude of mechanical failures, such as head crashes, PCB failure and failed motors; tapes can simply break. Physical damage to a hard drive, even in cases where a head crash has occurred, does not necessarily mean there will be permanent loss of data. The techniques employed by many professional data recovery companies can typically salvage most, if not all, of the data that had been lost when the failure occurred. Of course there are exceptions to this, such as cases where severe damage to the hard drive platters may have occurred. However, if the hard drive can be repaired and a full image or clone created, then the logical file structure can be rebuilt in most instances. Most physical damage cannot be repaired by end users. For example, opening a hard disk drive in a normal environment can allow airborne dust to settle on the platter and become caught between the platter and the read/write head. During normal operation, read/write heads float 3 to 6 nanometers above the platter surface, and the average dust particles found in a normal environment are typically around 30,000 nanometers in diameter.https://acsdata.com/data-recovery-3tb-seagate-hard- drive/#Hard_Drive_Flying_Height When these dust particles get caught between the read/write heads and the platter, they can cause new head crashes that further damage the platter and thus compromise the recovery process. Furthermore, end users generally do not have the hardware or technical expertise required to make these repairs. Consequently, data recovery companies are often employed to salvage important data with the more reputable ones using class 100 dust- and static-free cleanrooms. =Recovery techniques= Recovering data from physically damaged hardware can involve multiple techniques. Some damage can be repaired by replacing parts in the hard disk. This alone may make the disk usable, but there may still be logical damage. A specialized disk-imaging procedure is used to recover every readable bit from the surface. Once this image is acquired and saved on a reliable medium, the image can be safely analyzed for logical damage and will possibly allow much of the original file system to be reconstructed.  Hardware repair  Media that has suffered a catastrophic electronic failure requires data recovery in order to salvage its contents. A common misconception is that a damaged printed circuit board (PCB) may be simply replaced during recovery procedures by an identical PCB from a healthy drive. While this may work in rare circumstances on hard disk drives manufactured before 2003, it will not work on newer drives. Electronics boards of modern drives usually contain drive-specific adaptation data (generally a map of bad sectors and tuning parameters) and other information required to properly access data on the drive. Replacement boards often need this information to effectively recover all of the data. The replacement board may need to be reprogrammed. Some manufacturers (Seagate, for example) store this information on a serial EEPROM chip, which can be removed and transferred to the replacement board. Each hard disk drive has what is called a system area or service area; this portion of the drive, which is not directly accessible to the end user, usually contains drive's firmware and adaptive data that helps the drive operate within normal parameters. One function of the system area is to log defective sectors within the drive; essentially telling the drive where it can and cannot write data. The sector lists are also stored on various chips attached to the PCB, and they are unique to each hard disk drive. If the data on the PCB do not match what is stored on the platter, then the drive will not calibrate properly. In most cases the drive heads will click because they are unable to find the data matching what is stored on the PCB. Logical damage Result of a failed data recovery from a hard disk drive. The term \\"logical damage\\" refers to situations in which the error is not a problem in the hardware and requires software-level solutions. =Corrupt partitions and file systems, media errors= In some cases, data on a hard disk drive can be unreadable due to damage to the partition table or file system, or to (intermittent) media errors. In the majority of these cases, at least a portion of the original data can be recovered by repairing the damaged partition table or file system using specialized data recovery software such as Testdisk; software like dd rescue can image media despite intermittent errors, and image raw data when there is partition table or file system damage. This type of data recovery can be performed by people without expertise in drive hardware as it requires no special physical equipment or access to platters. Sometimes data can be recovered using relatively simple methods and tools;Data Recovery Software more serious cases can require expert intervention, particularly if parts of files are irrecoverable. Data carving is the recovery of parts of damaged files using knowledge of their structure. =Overwritten data= After data has been physically overwritten on a hard disk drive, it is generally assumed that the previous data are no longer possible to recover. In 1996, Peter Gutmann, a computer scientist, presented a paper that suggested overwritten data could be recovered through the use of magnetic force microscopy.Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory , Peter Gutmann, Department of Computer Science, University of Auckland In 2001, he presented another paper on a similar topic.Data Remanence in Semiconductor Devices , Peter Gutmann, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center To guard against this type of data recovery, Gutmann and Colin Plumb designed a method of irreversibly scrubbing data, known as the Gutmann method and used by several disk-scrubbing software packages. Substantial criticism has followed, primarily dealing with the lack of any concrete examples of significant amounts of overwritten data being recovered. Although Gutmann's theory may be correct, there is no practical evidence that overwritten data can be recovered, while research has shown to support that overwritten data cannot be recovered. Solid-state drives (SSD) overwrite data differently from hard disk drives (HDD) which makes at least some of their data easier to recover. Most SSDs use flash memory to store data in pages and blocks, referenced by logical block addresses (LBA) which are managed by the flash translation layer (FTL). When the FTL modifies a sector it writes the new data to another location and updates the map so the new data appear at the target LBA. This leaves the pre-modification data in place, with possibly many generations, and recoverable by data recovery software. = Lost, deleted, and formatted data = Sometimes, data present in the physical drives (Internal/External Hard disk, Pen Drive, etc.) gets lost, deleted and formatted due to circumstances like virus attack, accidental deletion or accidental use of SHIFT+DELETE. In these cases, data recovery software are used to recover/restore the data files. = Logical bad sector = In the list of logical failures of hard disks, logical bad sector is the most common in which data files cannot be retrieved from a particular sector of the media drives. To resolve this, software is used to correct the logical sectors of the media drive. If this is not enough, the hardware containing the logical bad sectors must be replaced. Remote data recovery Recovery experts do not always need to have physical access to the damaged hardware. When the lost data can be recovered by software techniques, they can often perform the recovery using remote access software over the Internet, LAN or other connection to the physical location of the damaged media. The process is essentially no different from what the end user could perform by themselves. Remote recovery requires a stable connection with an adequate bandwidth. However, it is not applicable where access to the hardware is required, as in cases of physical damage. Four phases of data recovery Usually, there are four phases when it comes to successful data recovery, though that can vary depending on the type of data corruption and recovery required. ; Phase 1: Repair the hard disk drive : The hard drive is repaired in order to get it running in some form, or at least in a state suitable for reading the data from it. For example, if heads are bad they need to be changed; if the PCB is faulty then it needs to be fixed or replaced; if the spindle motor is bad the platters and heads should be moved to a new drive. ; Phase 2: Image the drive to a new drive or a disk image file : When a hard disk drive fails, the importance of getting the data off the drive is the top priority. The longer a faulty drive is used, the more likely further data loss is to occur. Creating an image of the drive will ensure that there is a secondary copy of the data on another device, on which it is safe to perform testing and recovery procedures without harming the source. ; Phase 3: Logical recovery of files, partition, MBR and filesystem structures : After the drive has been cloned to a new drive, it is suitable to attempt the retrieval of lost data. If the drive has failed logically, there are a number of reasons for that. Using the clone it may be possible to repair the partition table or master boot record (MBR) in order to read the file system's data structure and retrieve stored data. ; Phase 4: Repair damaged files that were retrieved : Data damage can be caused when, for example, a file is written to a sector on the drive that has been damaged. This is the most common cause in a failing drive, meaning that data needs to be reconstructed to become readable. Corrupted documents can be recovered by several software methods or by manually reconstructing the document using a hex editor. Restore disk The Windows operating system can be reinstalled on a computer that is already licensed for it. The reinstallation can be done by downloading the operating system or by using a \\"restore disk\\" provided by the computer manufacturer.

Life Braden was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, and educated at Magee Secondary School, Kerrisdale, Vancouver. He produced plays on CJOR Vancouver in the late 1930s and early 1940s. He married Barbara Kelly in 1942, and they moved to Toronto the same year. They had two children, Christopher and Kelly Braden. Seven years later, he, his wife and two children moved to England. A third child, Kim, was born in London in 1949. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1991, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel outside the Aldwych Theatre.Can be accessed. See External Links. Braden died in Camden, London, aged 76, following a series of strokes. Career =Radio= In Breakfast with Braden (for the BBC, from January 1950) he played American serviceman \\"Brandon Marlow\\" (a caricature of Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire). Other cast members acted as stooges, including Pearl Carr (\\"Sing, Pearl\\"), Benny Lee and bandleader Nat Temple (\\"Play, Nat!\\"). Other BBC radio shows followed: Bedtime with Braden (from September 1950), which included his signature sign-out song \\"Lullaby of Birdland\\"; Between Time; Bathtime; and Bedlam with Braden. Ronald Fletcher, the announcer, was drawn into the script which added to the ingenuity and enjoyment. Braden also appeared in 1951 alongside his wife in An Evening at Home with Bernard Braden and Barbara Kelly. =Television= Braden is probably best remembered for On the Braden Beat, a popular consumer affairs programme made for ITV by Associated Television, which ran from 1962 to 1967. Jock Watson and, later, Francis Coleman produced this Saturday late-night show, which also examined current political issues affecting the British public. The show was interspersed with lighthearted sketches and music, and helped a number of actors to get a start on television. Performers frequently featured included Peter Cook, Jake Thackray and Tim Brooke-Taylor. A successor with essentially the same format, Braden's Week, appeared when he transferred to the BBC from 1967 to 1972. This show was cancelled when he advertised margarine on the BBC's commercial rival ITV; the BBC felt this was inconsistent with his role as the consumers' spokesman. Esther Rantzen, one of the researcher/presenters, went on to front a similar consumer-focused show, That's Life!. In 1974, Braden also hosted a short-lived Canadian edition of The Braden Beat for Canada's fledgling Global Television Network.\\"A new TV network comes to life as the old scoffers just fade away\\". The Globe and Mail, January 5, 1974. Braden hosted a quiz show for London Weekend Television in 1976, The Sweepstakes Game. Two contestants decided which of six star guests were most likely to help them to win cash and prizes. He later (1987-1989) presented episodes of the show All Our Yesterdays. Braden independently produced and shot in 1967-68 an extended series of interviews of public figures, conducted by himself (and sometimes by his wife), for a series called Now and Then\\"Now and Then (1967-68)\\", BFI screenonline but the series was never completed or sold to a broadcaster. The series was re-edited in 2008 as Sex Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll: The 60s Revealed, in which the original interviewees saw their 1968 interviews for the first time. =Film and stage= His few film appearances included Love in Pawn (1953), Jet Storm (1959), The Full Treatment (1960), The Day the Earth Caught Fire (1961) (as the news editor of the Daily Express), and the 1962 films Two and Two Make Six and All Night Long. In the same year he played Flight Surgeon Randall in the British film The War Lover, alongside Steve McQueen, Robert Wagner and a young Michael Crawford. He also narrated the 20-minute British Transport Films short The Coasts of Clyde, in which he announces himself as a Canadian traveller arriving in Scotland in pursuit of an ancestor in the land of his parents. On the stage he appeared in two Tennessee Williams plays, as Mitch in the London production of A Streetcar Named Desire, and later as the lead in Period of Adjustment. =Book= Braden published an autobiography, The Kindness of Strangers; the title is an allusion to A Streetcar Named Desire.Much of the detail is confirmed in the This Is Your Life episode devoted to Braden. =Discography= * Bernard Braden Reads Stephen Leacock (1969), Capitol ST-6335 References External links Bernard Braden's appearance on This Is Your Life Category:1916 births Category:1993 deaths Category:British male stage actors Category:British male television actors Category:Male actors from Vancouver Category:20th-century British male actors Category:British television presenters Category:Canadian male stage actors Category:Canadian male television actors Category:20th-century Canadian male actors Category:Canadian television hosts Category:Global Television Network people Category:Canadian emigrants to England ","title":"Bernard Braden"},{"id":"2160191","text":"Full Auto is a video game for the Xbox 360 console published by Sega. Originally Developed by Pseudo Interactive for the PC, it is a vehicular combat racing game. It features destructible environments and (in certain races) a mode called \\"Unwreck\\" which rewinds time if the player makes a mistake and wants to try again. The game was removed from Games on Demand in August 2012. A sequel, Full Auto 2: Battlelines, has been developed exclusively for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. Vehicles In Full Auto, there are four vehicle classes. Each has its own abilities, strengths and weaknesses. There is Class A, which are faster, but have less durability than their counterparts. Class B is the middle class of vehicles having a fair amount of speed, and decent durability. The slow, and highly durable class is Class C. A fourth class, Class S, is home to the \\"ultimate\\" class where its vehicle is very powerful, fast and durable. Note that in online play all players, regardless of how far they have gotten in the career mode, have access to all vehicles in whatever class the host of the room determines. However tuneable weapons are not permitted on Live play until the gamer has unlocked them from the career mode. Weapons The weapons of Full Auto are mounted on the vehicles, and have unlimited ammunition, but require a cooldown period if fired too quickly. The weapons become active after approximately 10 seconds of racing into the game. Reception The game received mixed reviews from top video game critics.

Neopentane is a flammable gas at room temperature and pressure which can condense into a highly volatile liquid on a cold day, in an ice bath, or when compressed to a higher pressure. Neopentane is the simplest alkane with a quaternary carbon, and has achiral tetrahedral symmetry. It is one of the three structural isomers with the molecular formula C5H12 (pentanes), the other two being n-pentane and isopentane. Out of these three, it is the only one to be a gas at standard conditions; the others are liquids. Nomenclature The traditional name neopentane was still retained in the 1993 IUPAC recommendations,Table 19(a) Acyclic and monocyclic hydrocarbons. Parent hydrocarbons but is no longer recommended according to the 2013 recommendations. The preferred IUPAC name is the systematic name 2,2-dimethylpropane, but the substituent numbers are superfluous because it is the only possible ‚Äúdimethylpropane‚Äù. A neopentyl group attached to a generic group R. A neopentyl substituent, often symbolized by \\"Np\\", has the structure Me3C‚ÄìCH2‚Äì for instance neopentyl alcohol (Me3CCH2OH or NpOH). As Np also symbolises the element neptunium (atomic number 93) one should use this abbreviation with care. The obsolete name tetramethylmethane is also used, especially in older sources. Physical properties =Boiling and melting points= The boiling point of neopentane is only 9.5 ¬∞C, significantly lower than those of isopentane (27.7 ¬∞C) and normal pentane (36.0 ¬∞C). Therefore, neopentane is a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, while the other two isomers are (barely) liquids. The melting point of neopentane (‚àí16.6 ¬∞C), on the other hand, is 140 degrees higher than that of isopentane (‚àí159.9 ¬∞C) and 110 degrees higher than that of n-pentane (‚àí129.8 ¬∞C). This anomaly has been attributed to the better solid-state packing assumed to be possible with the tetrahedral neopentane molecule; but this explanation has been challenged on account of it having a lower density than the other two isomers. Moreover, its enthalpy of fusion is lower than the enthalpies of fusion of both n-pentane and isopentane, thus indicating that its high melting point is due to an entropy effect resulting from higher molecular symmetry. Indeed, the entropy of fusion of neopentane is about 4 times lower than that of n-pentane and isopentane. =1H NMR spectrum= Because of neopentane's full tetrahedral symmetry, all protons are chemically equivalent, leading to a single NMR chemical shift Œ¥ = 0.902 when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride.Spectral Database for Organic Compounds, Proton NMR spectrum of neopentane, accessed 4 Jun 2018. In this respect, neopentane is similar to its silane analog, tetramethylsilane, whose single chemical shift is zero by convention. The symmetry of the neopentane molecule can be broken if some hydrogen atoms are replaced by deuterium atoms. In particular, if each methyl group has a different number of substituted atoms (0, 1, 2, and 3), one obtains a chiral molecule. The chirality in this case arises solely by the mass distribution of its nuclei, while the electron distribution is still essentially achiral.

Detail of A Private View at the Royal Academy, 1881. Artistic Dress was a fashion movement in the second half of the nineteenth century that rejected highly structured and heavily trimmed Victorian trends in favour of beautiful materials and simplicity of design. It arguably developed in Britain in the early 1850s, influenced by artistic circles such as the Pre-Raphaelites, and Dress Reform movements. It subsequently developed into more specific categories such as Aesthetic Dress and K√ºnstlerkleid on the continent. Artistic dress Jane Morris (The Blue Silk Dress) by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, 1868. Dante Gabriel Rossetti and other members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood were conscious archaizers, emulating the work of the \\"old masters\\" and choosing romantic, medieval subjects. They dressed their models in long flowing gowns loosely inspired by styles of the Middle Ages. These styles were then adopted by the painters' wives and models for everyday dress. Dresses were loosely fitted and comparatively plain, often with long puffed sleeves; they were made from fabric in muted colors derived from natural dyes, and could be ornamented with embroidery in the art needlework style. Artistic dress was an extreme contrast to the tight corsets, hoop skirts and bustles, bright synthetic aniline dyes, and lavish ornamentation seen in the mainstream fashion of the period. In the 1860s, artistic dress became popular in intellectual circles and among artists for its natural beauty; it also reinforced their social ideals of quality materials, respect for the work of the hands, and the purity of medieval design. Aesthetic dress Jacques Doucet, 1898-1900, with characteristics of the aesthetic dress movement : simple in design, \\"yet extravagant by the choice of materials used. The sheer overlayer is enhanced by the solid lam√© underlayers and a sense of luxury is added by the hidden lace flounce at the hem.\\"Ball gown on Metropolitan Museum of Art. Oscar Wilde in his aesthetic lecturing costume, 1882. Photo by Napoleon Sarony. Wilde wrote about aesthetic dress movement in his recently rediscovered treatise The Philosophy of Dress. Aesthetic dress of the 1880s and 1890s carries on many of the external characteristics of Artistic dress (rejection of tightlacing in favour of simplicity of line and emphasis on beautiful fabrics), even though, at its core, Aestheticism rejected the moral and social goals of the Victorian dress reform that was its precursor. The Aesthetes' belief that the Arts should provide refined sensuous pleasure was a direct rejection of the reverence for simplicity and handwork propounded by William Morris. Aesthetic dress encompasses a range of modes, from the Japonaise gowns and Kate Greenaway-inspired children's smocks of Liberty & Co. to the velvet jackets and knee breeches of Oscar Wilde's \\"aesthetic lecturing costume\\" for his speaking tour of America in 1882. Prominent designers and dressmakers associated with the movement include Ada Nettleship, who designed costumes for Oscar Wilde's wife Constance Lloyd, and Alice Comyns Carr, who was head costume designer for the actor Ellen Terry. Anna Muthesius was a German designer living in London who was annoyed that women were being exploited by clothing industrialists and that to avoid their pronouncements they should decide on their own fabrics and designs. Her 1903 book, Das Eigenkleid der Frau, which incorporated an Art Nouveau binding by Frances MacDonald, is considered an important contribution to the Artistic Dress movement. Influence on mainstream fashion From artistic circles, artistic and aesthetic dress spread to fashionable ones. The delicate, lightly corseted tea gowns of the turn of the 20th century echo the lines of late aesthetic dress, and in their turn paved the way for the early Art Deco creations of Paul Poiret.

As an LCD consists of a fixed raster, it cannot change resolution to match the signal being displayed as a CRT monitor can, meaning that optimal display quality can be reached only when the signal input matches the native resolution. An image where the number of pixels is the same as in the image source and where the pixels are perfectly aligned to the pixels in the source is said to be pixel perfect.AfterDawn.com - Native Resolution While CRT monitors can usually display images at various resolutions, an LCD monitor has to rely on interpolation (scaling of the image), which causes a loss of image quality. An LCD has to scale up a smaller image to fit into the area of the native resolution. This is the same principle as taking a smaller image in an image editing program and enlarging it; the smaller image loses its sharpness when it is expanded. This is especially problematic as most resolutions are in a 4:3 aspect ratio (640√ó480, 800√ó600, 1024√ó768, 1280√ó960, 1600√ó1200) but there are odd resolutions that are not, notably 1280√ó1024. If a user were to map 1024√ó768 to a 1280√ó1024 screen there would be distortion as well as some image errors, as there is not a one-to-one mapping with regard to pixels. This results in noticeable quality loss and the image is much less sharp. In theory, some resolutions could work well, if they are exact multiples of smaller image sizes. For example, a 1600√ó1200 LCD could display an 800√ó600 image well, as each of the pixels in the image could be represented by a block of four on the larger display, without interpolation. Since 800√ó600 is an integer factor of 1600√ó1200, scaling should not adversely affect the image. But in practice, most monitors apply a smoothing algorithm to all smaller resolutions, so the quality still suffers for these \\"half\\" modes. Most LCD monitors are able to inform the PC of their native resolution using Extended display identification data (EDID); however, some LCD TVs, especially those with 1366x768 pixels, fail to provide their native resolution and only provide a set of lower resolutions, resulting in a less than pixel perfect output. Some widescreen LCD monitors optionally display lower resolutions without scaling or stretching an image, so that the image will always be in full sharpness, although it will not occupy the full screen. This is most often recognizable upon close inspection, as there will typically be black edges visible on either side of the panel horizon.

It is a primary arterial highway in the two counties. These two counties form the southernmost portion of the 13-county Twin Cities metropolitan area, although CSAH 42 travels across the northern reaches of the two counties. Route description County Road 42 serves as an east-west arterial route for the South of the River suburbs of the Minneapolis ‚Äì Saint Paul area. The roadway connects the communities of Shakopee, Prior Lake, Savage, Burnsville, Apple Valley, Rosemount, and Hastings; which are all located south of the Minnesota River. From west to east, the route follows 140th Street, Egan Drive, 150th Street and 145th Street. Its westernmost terminus is at Shakopee in Scott County, where it intersects County Road 17 (Marschall Road). The eastern terminus of County 42 is at Hastings in Dakota County, where it meets U.S. Highway 61. County 42 is designated as a principal arterial highway by the Metropolitan Council, and the roadway is supposed to have limited commercial access and traffic signals only at one-half mile intervals. However, because it was used as a primary commercial road before its designation as a principal arterial highway, it passes directly through the downtown areas of several cities in Scott and Dakota Counties; most notably Burnsville and Apple Valley in Dakota County Most of County Road 42 is designated as part of the National Highway System. The major highways it intersects from west to east are: State Highway 13, Interstate 35W, Interstate 35E, Cedar Avenue two miles (3 km) south of the terminus of State Highway 77, State Highway 3, U.S. 52, State Highway 55, and U.S. 61. History County Road 42 was authorized and paved during the 1960s. In July 2007, construction began to widen County Road 42 to six lanes from Glendale Road in Savage to County Road 5 in Burnsville. Also, the old traffic signals between Glendale Road and County Road 5, were replaced with new ones. The project was completed by summer 2008. Future A proposed reconstruction project at the interchange with U.S. Highway 52 in Rosemount, will reconstruct the interchange to a cloverleaf interchange. The purpose of the project is to provide movement between the north and the east with the closure of the nearby US 52 / MN 55 interchange. Phase 1 of construction will start in 2017, with widening of County Road 42 to 4 lanes, including turn lanes and replacement of Highway 52 bridges.

The use of the \\"HF-2E\\" designation is the primary cause of this confusion and was intentional misinformation done to divert attention away from the true nature of the project, which is that of a long range offensive cruise missile. The HF-2E is actually a completely different design and is said to serve a similar function in Taiwan's military as the US Navy Tomahawk (RGM-109) cruise missile.Fu S. Mei. \\"Towards a Counter-Deterrent Capability Part I\\", Taiwan Defense Review, 21 June 2001. Its launch weight is reported to be in the range, including its solid rocket booster.Fu S. Mei. \\"HF-2E Cruises Along\\", Taiwan Defense Review, 27 March 2007. It is essentially a tactical land attack cruise missile designed for use against military target sets, particularly air-defense fire units and command-and-control facilities, and its relatively small warhead size and the rather limited number of missiles planned for procurement clearly suggest that this is not a \\"first strike\\" weapon.Minnick, Wendell. \\"Taiwan Proceeds on LACM\\", Defense News, 15 September 2008. The project was first announced in 2001. Following several test firings in 2004 and early 2005 at the Jiu Peng Missile Range in southeastern Taiwan, the baseline HF-2E (Block I) completed its operational evaluation (OPEVAL) in 2005, the missile flying a low-altitude circuit off Taiwan's southeastern coastline between Pingtung and Lanyu Island. An improved HF-2E missile was reportedly tested by CSIST at Jui Peng Missile Range on 2 February 2007. In 2017 the missiles received an extensive upgrade to increase their effectiveness against naval targets. Description The baseline HF-2E Block I land attack cruise missile (LACM) is said to be powered by an indigenously-developed Taiwanese turbofan engine believed to be rated in the thrust range and developed by CSIST partially based on technology and experience from the Microturbo 078 turbojet engine used on Hsiung Feng 2 (HF-2) anti-ship cruise missiles. When equipped with a standard unitary high-explosive -class warhead, it is said to have a maximum range of 700 km. Other types of warhead are said to be in development, such as cluster submunitions and a hard target penetrator warhead. TDR also reported that through modification of the existing engine and combined with the redesign and reduction of the missile's control and electronic systems, CSIST was able to free up enough internal space/weight in the missile to allow it to carry additional fuel and extend its range to over 2,000 km, although a Defense News report claimed the other version was only an 800 km range missile. The ultimate objective is to develop a missile that has an objective range of over , using a technologically advanced Taiwanese power plant with superior fuel efficiency and mission endurance, and possibly a more advanced and lighter miniaturized warhead. The HF-2E Block I missile uses inertial guidance with Global Positioning System (GPS) and TERCOM updates. For terminal guidance, it uses infrared homing (Imaging infrared) with an autonomous digital target recognition system. The IIR terminal seeker is used for target acquisition and to positively identify an optimal aim point. The target image is then compared against digitized files in the memory of the on-board guidance computer (DSMAC terminal guidance). The HF-2E block I missile's cruising speed is high subsonic, typically in the range. When the missile approaches hostile territory, it would descend to an altitude of about . On its final approach to its target, the missile would climb up to avoid any physical barriers and to allow its IIR seeker to acquire the target and identify an optimal aim point before plunging down onto the designated impact point. The report in Taiwan Defense Review, credited the HF-2E block I missile with a pre-terminal accuracy of around 15 m.  Production and fielding  The low-rate production of the Block I missile was to have started in July 2005 and using funds originally allocated for its R&D;, at least five missiles were built. The unit cost per missile was estimated to be at US$3.08 million (2003 US$ dollar value). Another report made in 2006 claimed that three batteries comprising twenty-four mobile launchers and forty-eight missiles were in the final stages of testing and may be fielded within two years.Stokes, Mark A. \\"Taiwan's Security‚ÄîBeyond the Special Budget\\" , American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, March 2006. The HF-2E is currently in low volume production in the Project ChiChun (ÊàüÈöº, j«ê zh«în, lance hawk). A Taipei Times news report claimed that President Ma Ying Jeou ordered the production of over 500 to 1000 HF-2E missiles in 2008.Hazeldine, Richard. \\"US Trying to block Taiwan missiles: 'Defense News'\\", Taipei Times, 29 October 2008. Now approved and cleared to enter full volume/serial production in 2011. It supposedly can deliver a unitary warhead .Taiwan to upgrade indigenous missile capabilities - Defensenews.com, 6 February 2017 The Associated Press has reported a range of 1,500 km. The HF-2E missile is primarily deployed operationally in ground- mobile launchers. The launcher vehicle carries the missiles in protective aluminum box launchers, with wings and control fins retracted, conceptually similar to the trailer-mounted mobile launchers for Tien Kung Sky Bow series surface-to-air missiles and HF-2 coastal defense missiles. The launchers are normally be based in hardened shelters at military installations, with deployment to remote, pre-surveyed launch sites during alert situations. The SCMP has reported that the HF-IIE is closely watched by the PLA's Rocket Force.

G. Wells, written in four monthsArnold Bennett's diary is the source of this information, which states that the book earned 3,000 pounds for Wells. Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie, H.G. Wells: A Biography (Simon and Schuster, 1973), p. 234. Wells wrote Tono-Bungay concurrently but regarded the latter as so superior artistically that he ultimately finished up The War in the Air in order to get it out of the way, so that he could concentrate his efforts on the more important novel. David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (Yale UP, 1986), p. 203. in 1907 and serialised and published in 1908 in The Pall Mall Magazine, is like many of Wells's works notable for its prophetic ideas, images, and concepts‚Äîin this case, the use of the aircraft for the purpose of warfare and the coming of World War I. The novel's hero is Bert Smallways, a \\"forward-thinking young man\\" and a \\"kind of bicycle engineer of the let's-'ave-a-look-at-it and enamel-chipping variety.\\"H.G. Wells, The War in the Air, Ch. 1, ¬ß2 Plot summary The first three chapters of The War in the Air relate details of the life of Bert Smallways and his extended family in a location called Bun Hill, a (fictional) former Kentish village that had become a London suburb within living memory. The story begins with Bert's brother Tom, a stolid greengrocer who views technological progress with apprehension, and their aged father, who recalls with longing the time when Bun Hill was a quiet village and he had driven the local squire's carriage. However, the story soon focuses on Bert who is an unimpressive, not particularly gifted, unsuccessful young man with few ideas about larger things but is far from unintelligent. He has a strong attachment to a young woman named Edna. When bankruptcy threatens one summer, he and his partner abandon the shop, devise a singing act (\\"the Desert Dervishes\\"), and resolve to try their fortunes in English sea resorts. As chance would have, their initial performance is interrupted by a balloon which lands on the beach before them, and which turns out to contain one Mr. Butteridge. Butteridge is famous for his successful invention of an easily manoeuvrable fixed-wing aircraft whose secret he has not revealed and that he is seeking to sell to the British government or, failing that, to Germany. Prior to Butteridge, nobody had succeeded in producing a practical heavier- than-air machine, only a few awkward devices of limited utility such as the German \\"Drachenflieger\\", which had to be towed aloft and released from an airship. Butteridge's invention is a major breakthrough, as it is highly manoeuvrable, capable of both very fast and very slow flight, and requires only a small area to take off and land, reminiscent of the later autogyro. By accident Bert is carried off in Butteridge's balloon, and discovers Butteridge's secret plans on board it. Bert is clever enough to appraise his situation, and when the balloon is shot down in a secret German \\"aeronautic park east of Hamburg,\\"H.G. Wells, The War in the Air, Ch. 3, ¬ß5. Bert tries to sell Mr. Butteridges's invention. However, he has stumbled upon the German air fleet just as it is about to launch a surprise attack on the United States - and Prince Karl Albert, the author and leader of this plan, decides to take him along for the campaign. The Prince, world-famous as \\"the German Alexander\\" or Napoleon, is a living manifestation of German nationalism and boundless imperial ambitions, his personality as depicted by Wells in some ways resembling that of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Bert's disguise is soon seen through by the Germans, and ‚Äì narrowly avoiding being summarily thrown overboard by the furious prince ‚Äì he is relegated to the role of a witness to the true horror of war. Imperial German Flying Corps, like this one, invade the United States and launch devastating air raids on New York City. The German aerial forces, comprising airships and Drachenfliegers, are mounting their surprise attack on the United States before the Americans can build a large aerial navy; the pretext for the attack is a German demand for the US to abandon the Monroe Doctrine, so as to facilitate German imperial ambitions in South America. The Germans are, however, unaware that the \\"Confederation of Eastern Asia\\" (China and Japan) has secretly been building a massive air force. Tensions between Japan and the United States, exacerbated by the issue of American citizenship being denied to Japanese immigrants, leads to war breaking out between the Confederation of Eastern Asia and the US, whereupon the Confederation turns out to possess overwhelmingly strong aerial forces, and the US finds itself fighting a war on two fronts: the Eastern and the Western, in the air as well on sea. Bert Smallways is present as the Germans first attack an American naval fleet in the Atlantic, utterly obliterating it and proving Dreadnoughts to be obsolete and helpless against aerial bombardment. The Germans then appear over New York City, bomb several key points, and establish that they have the city at their mercy, whereupon the mayor, with the consent of the White House, offers New York's surrender. However, the surrender announcement rouses the population's patriotic fury; local militias rebel and manage to destroy a German airship over Union Square using a concealed artillery piece. Following this, the vengeful prince orders a wholesale destruction, airships moving along Broadway and systematically raining death and destruction on the population below. Following the destruction of New York, the far inferior American flying machines launch a suicidal attack on the overwhelming German force. They are almost completely obliterated, but cripple the Germans. The prince's flagship is disabled, and is unable to avoid being driven north by gale-force winds, eventually crashlanding in Labrador. Bert becomes an official member of the crew, as they struggle to survive in the freezing wilderness, befriends an English-speaking German junior officer, and for a time feels strong fellowship towards his crew mates. After a week they are picked up by another German airship, and carried directly into the fray of a ferocious new battle. According to the prince's plans for the attack on the US, simultaneously with the subduing of New York, other German forces had landed at Niagara Falls, summarily evicted all the American population as far as Buffalo, and set to work building a large German airfield on American soil. However, the Asians ‚Äì who have their own plans of conquest in America, and have already destroyed San Francisco ‚Äì send their aerial forces over the Rocky Mountains and engage the Germans in battle, seeking to conquer or destroy the Niagara base. Goat Island of the sky in which Bert Smallways saw the battle between German and Asian airships. The Asiatic air fleet is equipped with large numbers of lightweight one-man flying machines called Niais, which appear to be ornithopters, armed with a gun carried by the pilot firing explosive bullets \\"loaded with oxygen\\" (i.e. incendiary bullets) for use against the hydrogen-filled airships. The Asians prove overwhelmingly superior, and the German airships are either destroyed or forced to flee, eventually surrendering to the Americans; only a few remain with Prince Karl Albert, who attempts a heroic last stand. Bert is stranded on Goat Island in the middle of Niagara Falls, where he finds a crashed Niais and discovers that Prince Karl Albert and a surviving German officer share the island with him. Their clash of personalities eventually culminates in a life-or-death confrontation, and Bert ‚Äì originally gentle and sickened by bloodshed ‚Äì overcomes his civilised scruples and kills the prince. Bert then manages to repair the Asian flying machine and escapes from the island on it, crash- landing near Tanooda, New York. Upon making contact with local Americans, Bert learns that the Asiatic forces have landed \\"a million men\\" on the western seaboard. The original GermanAmerican conflict, which had set off the conflagration, is almost forgotten in the massive conflict with the Asian forces ‚Äì a conflict carried out with great savagery, neither side taking prisoners. All over the US, Chinese Americans are being lynched and in some places the lynching extends to blacks as well. Bert learns that the war is going badly for the Americans, who are unable to withstand the superior Asian flying machines; the Americans mourn the loss of the Butteridge machine which might have turned the tide, if its inventor had not died suddenly shortly before the outbreak of war, taking his secret with him. Bert discloses that the plans for Butteridge's flying machine are in his possession, whereupon a local militia leader named Laurier urges him to turn the plans over to the president. After an adventurous ride through war-ravaged upstate New York they find the president hiding out in \\"Pinkerville on the Hudson.\\" The president proceeds to have copies printed and distributed widely all over the US, as well as sent to Europe. However, the results are not quite as expected. A decisive Asiatic victory is, indeed, averted ‚Äì but there is no American or European victory, either. The Butteridge machine is cheap, easy and quick to build, and needs no big fields to take off or land ‚Äì which mean it can be built and operated not only by national governments, but also by private groups, local militias, and even bandits ‚Äì a development which tends to break up the war into a vast, incoherent multitude of localised struggles and which accelerates the already-begun process of break-up and disintegration of the world's nations. While Bert experiences directly the events in America, news about what has happened in the rest of the world (specifically, in his native England) is few and scattered, with newspapers reduced to a single page before finally ceasing publication altogether; still, he hears with great alarm that London had shared the fate of New York. The omniscient author, whose point of view is that of a future historian documenting the war and its aftermath, reveals information not available to Bert. The German assault on the US had bypassed Germany's European rivals, whose air fleets were considered too puny to constitute a threat, with the intention of totally dominating them once the Americans had been subdued. However, the alarmed United Kingdom, France, Spain and Italy pooled their aerial resources into a single strong force, passed through Swiss airspace after destroying that country's own flying machines, and devastated Hamburg and Berlin. The Germans mobilised a counter-attack which destroyed London and Paris, but then, as in America, the feuding Europeans were faced with an enormous attack from Asia. The Asiatic fleet had attacked a combined Anglo-Indian aerial force, captured the Burmese airfields, Australia, and the Pacific islands. They then struck westwards, capturing the Middle East and South Africa and starting to build airships at Cairo, Damascus and Johannesburg. Moving further northwards, they soon reached Armenia and then defeating the German forces in the Battle of the Carpathians before attacking Western Europe. A global financial collapse is caused by hostile nations freezing assets, and the end of the credit system. This is referred to as \\"the Panic,\\" which is followed by \\"The Purple Death.\\" The War in the Air, the Panic, and the Purple Death bring about \\"[w]ithin the space of five years\\" a total collapse of \\"the whole fabric of civilisation.\\"H.G. Wells, The War in the Air, Ch. 11, ¬ß1. But Bert Smallways, fixated on his amorous attachment, returns home after many adventures to kill a rival and win the hand of his beloved Edna; they marry and have eleven children. We are assured in the final chapter that \\"our present world state, orderly, scientific, and secured,\\"H.G. Wells, The War in the Air, Ch. 11, ¬ß1. is eventually established, but the novel reverts to the ensuing fortunes of the Smallways family as England relapses into a sort of an agricultural barbaric age. Themes Joseph Pennell's 1918 prophetic Liberty bond poster calls up the pictorial image of a bombed New York City, totally engulfed in a firestorm, similar to how New York City is bombed in the book. The story was written in 1907 and depicts a war happening in the late 1910s ‚Äì then a future history, which can be considered as a retroactive alternate history. The basic assumption behind the plot is that immediately after the Wright Brothers's first successful flight in 1903, all of the world's major powers became aware of the decisive strategic importance of air power, and embarked on a secret arms race to develop this power (there is a reference to the Wright Brothers themselves disappearing from public view, having been recruited for a secret military project of the US government ‚Äì as were other aviation pioneers in their own respective countries). The general public is virtually unaware of this arms race, until it finally bursts out in a vastly destructive war which destroys civilisation. In actual history, it took politicians and generals several decades to fully grasp these strategic implications. Moreover, the limited effect of the World War I German airship raids on London proved airships far from being the overwhelming destructive weapon depicted in Wells' book, nor were the early aeroplanes of the 1900s and 1910s capable of such massive bombings and destruction. Thus, the visions conjured by Wells were prophetic of the Second World War rather than the First one. (In fact, the actual First World war ‚Äì characterised by very rigid fronts and a clear advantage of defence over offence ‚Äì turned out to be the diametrical opposite of the one depicted by Wells, a completely fluid war with no clear fronts, and with a devastating offence against which no effective defence is possible.) The latter parts of the book feature a post-apocalyptic theme ‚Äì i.e., worldwide use of weapons of mass destruction and the war ending with no victors but with the total collapse of civilisation and the disintegration of all warring powers ‚Äì which prefigures the themes of the later extensive literature depicting the aftermath of a Third World War. A similar theme appears in Wells' later The Shape of Things to Come. In a sense, \\"Things to Come\\" is a kind of sequel to The War in the Air. Though the details of the war in the latter book are different, its outcome is essentially the same ‚Äì a complete disintegration of civilisation. \\"Things to Come\\" concentrates on the reconstruction of the world after this vast destruction and the creation of a peaceful, prosperous world state ‚Äì and it depicts pilots and their aircraft as having a key role in re- building and unifying the world, just as they had a key role in destroying it. Also the major semi-historical chapters ‚Äì interspersed in \\"The War in the Air\\" between the depictions of Bert Smallways' personal adventures, and written from the perspective of a future historian looking back with compassion at Twentieth Century people and their lethal nationalistic folly ‚Äì clearly prefigure the tone of \\"Things to Come\\". The idea of Japan and China uniting into a single power, the \\"Confederation of East Asia\\", prefigures \\"Eastasia\\" which is one of the three world powers in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty Four. The military might and ability attributed to the SinoJapanese alliance is clearly and manifestly inflated: constructing far more airships and flying machines than all the rest of the world put together; waging simultaneous all- out wars of conquest against the United States, Britain, Germany, and other powers; performing the gigantic logistical task of transporting a million people across the Pacific within a few days while at the same time conducting extensive military operations all over Asia, Africa, Europe and North America. As was pointed out by George Bright,George A. Bright, \\"The Magnified and Distorted Image of The Orient\\", Forward, Ch. 2 there was no way that a sober analysis of Japan and China's economic and military potential would have led Wells to attribute to them such might ‚Äì even assuming, as the book does, an incredibly fast industrialisation of China, a backward and predominantly agrarian country at the time of writing. Rather, this theme is clearly linked to fears of the \\"Yellow Peril\\", prevalent in Edwardian Britain as in other Western countries. Specifically, Wells' book is considered to have been influenced by M. P. Shiel's best-selling novel The Yellow Danger,Squires, \\"The Dragon's Tale\\", 299. which also influenced novelist Jack London's The Unparalleled Invasion (1910).Yorimitsu Hashimoto, \\"Germs, Body-Politics and Yellow Peril: Relocation of Britishness in The Yellow Danger,\\" Australasian Victorian Studies Journal (Vol. 9, 2003,) 56. A bit of scepticism on this issue is retained in The War in the Air in a passage where a German officer, hearing of the massive Asiatic offensive, remarks with astonishment: \\"The Yellow Peril was a peril, after all!\\".\\"The War in the Air\\", Ch. VII, 7 Western fears of Asia. The recent Japanese success in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, the first time when an Asian army proved had proved superior to a European one, was fresh in the memory of Wells' readers, the worldwide Asian assault depicted being in effect a monstrously magnified echo of the Japanese surprise attack on Port Arthur. The background of Bert Smallways bears some resemblance to Wells' own ‚Äì a working-class family in a London suburb (which is similar to Wells' native Bromley), with a struggling small shop. Jessica, Bert's strong-willed but narrow-minded sister in law ‚Äì a former domestic servant who rose to a kind of petit bourgeois respectability and who tries to make Bert an errand boy in the family shop ‚Äì resembles Wells' mother who intended him to be a draper. Bert seeks to break out of this background, as Wells did, but fails to gain the higher education which Wells got, and in the conditions of worldwide collapse he ends up as a semi-Medieval peasant eking out a bare subsistence. Bert's basic moral attitudes go through three distinct stages. To begin with, he tends to glorify war, patriotism and jingoism, and supports his nation becoming involved in wars in a haze of quasi-patriotic fever ‚Äì this in a shallow way, derived from the popular press and without having or expecting to have a personal experience of war and bloodshed. When on board the German air fleet, Bert is exposed to a mounting series of horrors and bloody scenes which make him increasingly sickened. The same process is shared with Lieutenant Kurt, the young English-speaking German whom Bert befriends; a professional military officer, Kurt had in fact not witnessed war before, either, and he is equally sickened and vehemently rejects the idea that people should be \\"blooded\\" to make them used to violence and bloodshed. When marooned on Goat Island and finding himself locked in a deadly confrontation with the two equally marooned Germans, Bert is full of compunctions and does not want to kill them. After having killed the Prince, Bert speaks to the kitten he had rescued in the middle of all the carnage, telling the innocent little creature of his regrets at having committed this act. Moreover, Bert does spare the other German officer roaming the island, even when having him in his gun sights.

The Heurige are renowned for their atmosphere of Gem√ºtlichkeit shared among a throng enjoying young wine, simple food, and - in some places - Schrammelmusik. They correspond to the Strau√üwirtschaften in the German Rheinland, the Frasche in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, and Osmiza in Slovenia. Heuriger is the abbreviation of \\"heuriger Wein\\" (this year's wine) in Austrian and Bavarian German. Originally, they were simple open-air taverns on the premises of winemakers, where people would bring along food and drink the new wine. Nowadays, the taverns are often situated at a distance from the wineyards and offer both food and drinks. Heurige where apple or pear cider is served are called Mostheurige. In the well-known wine-growing areas of the city of Vienna (Grinzing, Sievering, Neustift, Liesing) many eating establishments have a rustic interior design similar to Heurige, yet they have a normal licence and sell wine they buy from outside sources.  History  Ausg'steckt sign at a Heuriger in Grinzing, which announced that wine was being sold On 17 August 1784 Austrian Emperor Joseph II issued a decree that permitted all residents to open establishments to sell and serve self-produced wine and juices. At first no food could be sold in order to prevent competition with restaurants, but over time these restrictions lessened. Ausg'steckt would be a sign that the wine farmer was serving out the wine at a Heuriger. Over the years well- known areas for Heurigen developed, including Grinzing, Sievering, Neustift am Walde, Perchtoldsdorf, Mauer, Stammersdorf, Guntramsdorf, Gumpoldskirchen, Traiskirchen, Gainfarn, D√ºrnstein, Langenlois, the Wachau region, Rust, K√∂nigstetten, Gamlitz, and Kitzeck. Similar establishments exist in wine- producing regions elsewhere in Austria, known as Buschenschank in Styria, and Strau√üen, Besenwirtschaft, or Heckenwirtschaft in Germany and other German- speaking areas.  Atmosphere  A cosy Stube of the Schreiberhaus in Neustift am Walde, Vienna Sturm young wine is traditionally served at a Heuriger A Heuriger is prized both for the charms of what it offers and its limitations. Each Heuriger is only open briefly, usually 2 or 3 weeks during a four month season in the fall, although it may reopen again later in the season when more wine has been produced. It serves only its own wine, and but a limited selection of food as an evening meal, generally local, homemade products offered as small dishes such as Liptauer spread, various meat or sausage and Semmel combinations, or cheese boards. Typical drinks found at Heurigen include Sturm, a partially fermented wine sold at the beginning of fall that still contains a fair amount of grape, and Gruner Veltliner, which is one of the most popular types of Austrian wine. Almdudler and Gespritzer are also commonly found at modern Heurigen. Lucky patrons will sometimes find Eiswein to enjoy with dessert. Heurigen indicate that they are open and guests welcome by displaying a handful of conifer or fir twigs bound in a circular Buschen hung above the entrance door. Until the 20th century, it was customary for guests to bring along their own food when enjoying wine at a Heuriger. To make an establishment more profitable, in many places the tavern was leased to other winemakers (Winzer in German), known as Winzerstuben. Gem√ºtlichkeit shared among a throng enjoying young wine, simple food, and traditional music is one of the greatest appeals of a Heuriger. As a result, many establishments elsewhere, such as in Vienna, are made to look like Heurigen but in fact are licensed restaurants selling wines from outside sources; these even serve beer and coffee, unthinkable at an authentic Heuriger.  Music  At the Heuriger (Beim Heurigen) depicting musicians playing for guests, print by Moriz Jung (1911) Music has traditionally been part of the Heuriger ambiance and contributes greatly to its Gem√ºtlichkeit. When present today it is typically provided by a pair of Heurigens√§nger who serenade from table to table for tips. Playing a guitar and accordion, they take requests for songs from their repertoire of Wienerlieder and Schrammelmusik. These songs' themes invariably revolve around the quality of the wine, its consumption and consequences, Vienna's beauty, a nostalgic longing for the past, the transience of life, the inevitability of suffering and death at God's will, and, to a somewhat lesser degree, romantic love. Even trying to honor the Heuriger tradition, music has changed dramatically since performers such as The Third Man sensation Anton Karas earned a living by playing his Zither or Hans Moser sang a Wienerlied from his movies. Visitors from Germany will hope to hear songs from their native land, as will those from others; the Heurigens√§nger will try their best.

It was founded in 1887 by Baptist minister J.A. Campbell. Campbell's main campus in Buies Creek is home to its College of Arts & Sciences, College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences, Divinity School, School of Education, Lundy- Fetterman School of Business and School of Engineering. The nearby Health Sciences Campus is home to the Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine and the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing. The Raleigh Campus in downtown Raleigh is home to the Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law, as well as other programs. Campbell also provides online classes through Adult & Online Education, has campuses in Fort Bragg/Pope Air Force Base and at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, and maintains a degree program at Tunku Abdul Rahman College in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The university athletics teams are the Fighting Camels; its athletics programs field 20 NCAA Division I teams. History = Buies Creek Academy (1887‚Äì1926) = On January 5, 1887, James Archibald Campbell, a 26-year-old Baptist minister, welcomed 16 students to a small church in Buies Creek, North Carolina, for the first day of classes for the school he founded: Buies Creek Academy. By the end of the first term, there were 92 students. In the beginning days, Buies Creek Academy had just three faculty members: J.A. Campbell was principal; A. E. Booth, a graduate of the Nashville Normal College, served as assistant and teacher of the Normal Department and Business College; and Cornelia F. Pearson was an assistant and teacher in the Primary Department. The 1887 catalog lauded the rural location: \\"Being in the country, we avoid many of the temptations incident to towns and cities and save our patrons much extravagance in dress.\\" The first commencement took place on May 20, 1887, and every student participated in the program. Josephus Daniels of Raleigh, an editor of the State Chronicle and later owner of The Raleigh News & Observer, delivered the main address. Upon his return to Raleigh, he described his impressions of the Academy: \\"Among my pleasant memories of a trip to Harnett, none are more cherished by me with more fondness than the enjoyment of the excellent commencement exercise at Buies Creek Academy. It was a rare feast. The scholars are not prodigies; they do not surpass other boys and girls in the state, but they recite with ease, enunciate with distinctiveness, and gave choice sections of music and evidence the good training they had received. There was an absence of straining after effect, which was refreshing. There was simplicity and a regard for the fitness of things that are charming. There was an order and arrangement that showed a thoughtful and sensible management. I congratulate the people of Harnett on the excellent advantages Buies Creek Academy offers for the education of the children of the rising generation.\\" The beginning of the 20th Century ushered in tremendous hardship for the young school. On the evening of December 20, 1900, a suspicious fire destroyed the Academy and all the buildings except for the large wooden tabernacle. Awakened at 3:30 a.m. to witness the destruction, J.A. Campbell recalled: \\"When I ran up to the fire, the terrible fire, that was burning down chances for poor boys and girls, and I knew that I could not build again ... the flames that destroyed the labor of years [...] the only hope for hundreds of boys and girls was being swept away, I could not bear up longer [...] When they asked me my plans, I said, \\"Well, there's no chance to go on.\\" After the fire, Zachary Taylor Kivett came to visit and found Campbell \\"in bed discouraged to the limit.\\" Kivett said, \\"Why are you in bed? You're a Campbell. Get a hump on you.\\" Kivett also made a pledge to J.A. Campbell to construct a new stronger, sturdier brick building on the campus. Over the next 478 days, he oversaw and supervised nearly every aspect of the academy's reconstruction, from drawing plans and making brick to sawing the lumber and mixing sand and lime. Within the first few days alone, he had developed the plans to renovate the tabernacle so it could be temporarily used for classroom space; he had arranged for wagons to deliver lumber; and he had brought in carpenters to get to work. J.A. Campbell (far right) and his faculty at Buies Creek Academy in the late 1800s. By January 8, 1901, the tabernacle was open to classes. \\"A steam engine in britches\\" and \\"a grand old man,\\" Kivett had been called. In November 1903, the new brick building had been erected at a cost of $30,000. The completion of the Kivett Building brought new life to the school. The 1909 catalog noted, \\"It is built of beautiful brick, made on our own grounds, and is an everlasting monument to the love, loyalty, and sacrifices of our friends ... [who] are in itself a constant inspiration to live something high and noble, and to undertake the impossible.\\" The catalog added that Buies Creek Academy and Business College was \\"a leading preparatory school with military features, business, shorthand, typewriting, telegraphy, art, music and normal departments. World War I and the \\"Great Influenza Outbreak\\" of 1918 had a significant impact on the Academy and the Buies Creek community. According to Dr. Bruce Blackmon, the influenza outbreak also inflicted a serious toll on some families ‚Äî \\"If you saw a house and there was no smoke coming out of its chimney, that was an indication that the person responsible for heating the home was no longer alive.\\" Electric lights came to the campus in 1918. J.A. Campbell secured a $60,000 donation from Mr. B.N. Duke in 1927 to establish modern water and sewage facilities on the campus. There were 620 students enrolled in the school in 1923, and the first dormitory for boys was completed that year. It later became known as Layton Dormitory. Construction of Kivett Hall in 1902 (completed in 1903). Kivett is the oldest remaining building on Campbell University's campus today. According to J. Winston Pearce, \\"The evening of September 26, 1923, was a significant date for the life of the school.\\" That evening D. Rich ‚Äì treasurer of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company ‚Äì spent the night in the home of Dr. and Mrs. Campbell, and that morning they asked how he had slept. He replied, \\"I slept very little,\\" He continued, \\"No, I did not sleep well. Jesus and I talked together most of the night, and Jesus told me 'Buies Creek must live.'\\" Rich died the following year and left one eighth of his estate to the academy. He also provided $60,000 for the construction of Carrie Rich Memorial Library in honor of his first wife, as well as the first brick gymnasium and the D. Rich Memorial Building, completed in 1926. These new facilities, as well as competition from the new high schools that were being completed across the state in the 1920s, provided incentives for the Academy to become a junior college. At the annual Baptist State Convention Meeting in Wilmington in 1925, J.A. Campbell sold his interest in the Academy (appraised at $56,000) to the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina for $28,000; the school was then valued at more than $500,000. The Board of Education of the Baptist State Convention recommended unanimously that Buies Creek Academy become a junior college, beginning with the 1927‚Äì28 academic session. At that meeting, the Reverend A. C. Hamby made the motion to change the name from Buies Creek Academy to Campbell College, in honor of its founder. Dean D. B. Bryan of Wake Forest College approved of the name change, and Wake Forest College bestowed on J.A. Campbell the honorary Doctor of Divinity degree in 1926. J.A. Campbell died at the age of 72 in 1934. At Campbell's funeral, Dr. Charles E. Maddry of the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention proclaimed, \\"Dr. Campbell was a great servant of God because he early had a divine experience of the saving power of Christ. Because of [Campbell's] great love for others, he literally wore himself out serving them, giving poor boys and girls the chance of an education ... He always saw a future of service in his boys and girls.\\" = Campbell Junior College (1926‚Äì1961) = Campbell Junior College students gather at the Paul Green Outdoor Theater in the 1930s. Leslie Hartwell \\"L.H.\\" Campbell (1892‚Äì1970), the oldest son of the founder J.A. Campbell, was the unanimous choice by the Board of Trustees to succeed his father. Leslie was eight years old when the academy burned in December 1900. He remembered attending classes in the converted tabernacle when the Kivett Building was under construction. He graduated from Buies Creek Academy in 1908 and enrolled in Wake Forest College, along with his younger brother Carlyle. Upon his father's death in 1934, L. H. Campbell at the age of forty-two became the youngest college president in North Carolina. During his long, 33-year tenure as president, he guided the college through many challenges and economic struggles, especially the Depression and World War II. At his 1935 inauguration as the second president of Campbell, he said, \\"The events of this hour constitute only a link between a past set with marvelous achievement and a future calling for our wholehearted endeavor.\\" He concluded his address stating, \\"This is no coronation day. Rather, it witnesses the solemn dedication and surrender of all it is in us to a holy cause.\\" Leslie's major achievement was to expand the institution following World War II, steering Campbell to become a fully accredited co-educational Baptist-affiliated liberal arts and vocational college. Like his father before him, he encouraged students to pursue higher education in spite of economic hardships. The only campus building constructed in the 1930s was the Dining Hall. It was built in 1933 to accommodate four-hundred students, and was later named for the college's longtime business manager, B.P. Marshbanks Sr. Paul Green, a 1912 Buies Creek Academy alumnus and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, helped establish the Paul Green Theater, located between the D. Rich Administration Building and the Gym in 1934. in 1937, Campbell was the only junior college in North Carolina to offer courses in drama and journalism for college credit. During World War II, the enrollment on campus declined from 700 students to around 400. Like many other colleges throughout the country, intercollegiate athletic programs such as football, baseball, basketball, track, and tennis were temporarily suspended during the war years. When many male students went off to fight, space for female boarding students was at a premium; and Layton Annex, which had housed males, was turned over to women. The war also affected food supplies on campus. Campbell University's second president, Leslie Campbell, oversees construction on campus in the 1950s. \\"I remember the day the war was formally declared. President Leslie Campbell got the entire student body into one of the large rooms at D. Rich, and had a radio in there. He turned it on, and we heard, live, President Roosevelt declare war.\\" ‚Äî Dorothea Stewart Gilbert ('46) By 1957, the enrollment on the main campus reached 1,023 students, and more residential facilities were added to the campus. In 1961, the James A. Campbell Administration Building was dedicated and Bryan Hall for women opened \\"as a cluster of 12 one-story apartment units grouped around an exterior wall\\" that could house 200 students. Strickland Hall opened in 1962 to accommodate 132 women, and E. P. Sauls Hall opened that same year to house 131 men. A major building completed on the campus was the 44,000-square-foot Leslie Campbell Hall of Science. This three-story structure originally housed the departments of physics, biology, and chemistry, as well as home economics. Campbell College achieved senior-college status in 1961. In a speech he delivered on Founder's Day on March 6 of that year, President Campbell said: \\"On this observance of Founder's Day we stand on a pinnacle from which we have seen in retrospect glimpses of the unfolding drama of this institution for the past 74 years‚Äìdrama filled with intense human struggle, accompanied here and there with temporary reverses with groping, frequently toward some promised land of destiny, partially 'hidden behind the ranges'; but thank God, with occasional vistas of inviting new tablelands of thrilling achievement just beyond [...] The transformation of Campbell into a senior college is a far more meaningful and involved process than superimposing the junior and senior years upon the already established junior college. Just as the transition from old Buies Creek Academy to a junior college, begun in 1926, in many respects involved the rebirth of the institution, and so now becoming a senior college will result in many modifications in administrative policy and in the program of the institution.\\"  Campus  Kivett Hall, built in 1903, is the iconic centerpiece of Campbell University's main campus. Located in the Sandhills of southeastern North Carolina, the university is nestled in the small unincorporated village of Buies Creek near the Cape Fear River. The Buies Creek census-designated place population was only 2,215 in the 2000 census and the surrounding area remains rural. However, Buies Creek is approximately south of Raleigh, the state capital, North Carolina's second- largest city, and approximately north of Fayetteville, North Carolina's sixth- largest city. The center of campus is Academic Circle, which fronts Leslie Campbell Avenue to the south. Academic Circle is a grass thoroughfare, laced with sidewalks and magnolia trees that is surrounded on the south by dormitories Kitchin Hall (1955) and Baldwin Hall (1958) and along the north by the Frederick L. Taylor Hall of Religion (1973) (Campbell University Divinity School), D. Rich Memorial Building (1923), Kivett Hall (1903) (formerly Law School), Wiggins Hall (1993) (formerly Law School), Butler Chapel (2009) and Britt Hall (1947) (campus bookstore). North of Academic Circle the buildings flank the newly developed Fellowship Commons, a series of brick sidewalks and gathering places that connect the campus from the west on T.T. Lanier Street to the east on Main Street. In this part of campus are Marshbanks Dining Hall (1934), Leslie H. Campbell Hall of Science (1961), J.P. Riddle Pharmacy Center (1991), Maddox Hall (2007) (Pharmacy School), Pearson Hall (1915), Carrie Rich Memorial Library (1925), Carter Gymnasium (1952) and James A. Campbell Administration Building (1961). Beyond Fellowship Commons lies the north campus which contains several residence halls along with the Taylor Bott Rogers Fine Arts Center (1984) and the Lundy-Fetterman School of Business (1999). East of Main Street are more of Campbell's athletic facilities including Jim Perry Stadium (baseball), Johnson Memorial Natatorium (swimming), and the John W. Pope, Jr. Convocation Center as well as the Buies Creek post office. South of Leslie Campbell Avenue are more residence halls, including the new student apartments in Barker Hall (2005). South of U.S. Highway 421 are athletic fields and Barker‚ÄìLane Stadium. The newly constructed 96,000 sq. ft. Leon Levine Hall of Medical Science across Highway 421 hosts the new School of Osteopathic Medicine and the Physician Assistant Program.  Academics  Campbell offers over 100 tracks and concentrations; master's programs in business, education, pharmaceutical science, clinical research and divinity; and professional programs in law, pharmacy, physician assistant, physical therapy, and medicine. The University also makes study abroad and other special programs available. In 2012, the undergraduate acceptance rate was reported at 40.5%. Along with Campbell's premier undergraduate programs, the school has also achieved renown for its graduate programs. Since its establishment in 1986, Campbell University School of Pharmacy, now College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences, has maintained a 99 percent passage rate on both state and national exams. In ten of the last sixteen years, Campbell Pharmacy students have achieved a 100 percent passage rate on the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX). The School of Law Class of 2006 scored a 97% passage rate on July's North Carolina Bar Exam, topping all other law schools in the state. Campbell University's Norman A. Wiggins School of Law was featured in the Princeton Review's 2007 edition of the \\"Best 170 Law Schools\\" publication. Graduates of the School of Law have frequently led in passage rates on the North Carolina Bar Exam since the school's establishment in 1976, including a 100 percent passage rate in 1994, the first time all members of a graduation class accomplished that feat in North Carolina history. The School of Law Class of 2015 had an unemployment rate of 17% and 50% of 2015 graduates had obtained long term full-time as an attorney 9 months after graduation, according to statistics provided by the ABA.2015 ABA employment questionnarire summary http://employmentsummary.abaquestionnaire.org/ The Campbell University Divinity school offers both undergraduate and graduate level degrees. The Divinity School officially opened on August 19, 1996. Thirty-five founding students enrolled the first year of the Divinity school. These students constituted the Charter Class of eighty-four students. The Lundy-Fetterman School of Business offers a joint MBA with Pharm.D., J.D., and M.Div. students. Also, undergraduate business students have the option of electing to stay a fifth year to earn a joint BBA/MBA. Campbell is a dynamic institution in the wealth management industry by offering a one-of-a-kind degree, the Bachelor of Business Administration in Trust and Wealth Management. Banks and financial institutions from around the country court Campbell students for paid summer internships and for permanent hire upon graduation. The Lundy- Fetterman School of Business also offers one of twenty PGA accredited golf programs in the United States. In August 2011, the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences launched a master's degree in Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS). One year later, it began a Master of Science in Public Health degree program. The University is also seeking accreditation for a new Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) program with a projected start date of January 2014. The University's newest school, the School of Osteopathic Medicine, welcomed its first class in August 2013. The mission of the Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM) is to educate and prepare community-based osteopathic physicians in a Christian environment to care for the rural and underserved populations in North Carolina, the Southeastern United States and the nation. Campbell University also has an Adult and Online Education program with an online campus and campuses at Fort Bragg, NC, Camp Lejeune, NC and RTP in Raleigh, NC. Campbell University's Online Education program was established as a pilot program in 1999. The program originated at the Camp Lejeune Campus and became a separate program in 2004, relocating to the Main Campus.

If a vehicle towing a trailer skids, the trailer can push the towing vehicle from behind until it spins the vehicle around and faces backwards. This may be caused by equipment failure, improper braking, or adverse road conditions such as an icy road surface. In extreme circumstances, a driver may attempt to jackknife the vehicle deliberately in order to halt it following brake failure.  Trailer swing  When a trailer skids to one side, this is known as a trailer swing or trailer slew. This could happen on a slippery road surface, often where there is a cant. This is not the same as jackknifing and is not as serious since the trailer will move back into line as the vehicle continues forwards. The driver must be aware, however, that the trailer could slide up against parked cars or a guard rail, or that the wheels could slide into a ditch. This situation can occur especially when the trailer is empty or lightly loaded, and weather conditions cause violent gusts of crosswind.  Anti-jackknife devices  *One system with limited success was a device that mechanically limited the angle which a trailer could swing. *A much more successful system was to fit the tractor with anti-lock brakes. Fitted originally to airplanes in the 1950s, anti-lock brakes have significantly reduced the number of heavy vehicle accidents. *Electronic brakeforce distribution varies the pressure to the rear brakes during heavy load or hard braking, enhancing driver control.Brake Pressure Regulator - Patent 3762776 *Tractors used to be fitted with a lever in the cab to operate the trailer brakes. The vehicle could be slowed or stopped using the trailer brakes only. Theoretically this was a sure way to prevent jackknifing, but this lever was often the cause of jackknifing in a roundabout way. Frequent use of the trailer brakes alone caused them to overheat and fade while the tractor brakes remained fresh. In the event of an emergency stop, the driver would go straight for the foot brake and the truck would surely jackknife because the tractor brakes would lock while the trailer brakes would be ineffective due to previous overheating. *An alternative to having a trailer brake lever in the cab is to fit the trailer with an electromagnetic brake.

Carlson for Celebrated Players Film Corporation. An animated film with balloon texts, this short features the character Andy Gump, who is repeatedly harassed by dogs (duration 05:54). The Famous Players Film Company was a film company founded in 1912 by Adolph Zukor in partnership with the Frohman brothers, powerful New York City theatre impresarios. Discussions to form the company were held at The Lambs, a famous theater club where Charles and Daniel Frohman were members. The company advertised \\"Famous Players in Famous Plays\\" and its first release was the French film Les Amours de la reine √âlisabeth (1912) starring Sarah Bernhardt and Lou Tellegen. Its first actual production was The Count of Monte Cristo (1912, released 1913), directed by Edwin S. Porter and starring James O'Neill, the father of dramatist Eugene O'Neill. In 1914, the company purchased the former headquarters of New York City's Ninth Mounted Cavalry unit at 221 West 26th Street in Manhattan. The cavernous brick building made excellent filming space for Zukor, and the modernized site is still used today as Chelsea Television Studios. Hiring its performers straight from the New York stage, Famous Players had an early roster of some of the city's biggest names including Marguerite Clark, Hazel Dawn, and H. B. Warner. The company also featured cinema's biggest star of the era, Mary Pickford, and presented theater idol John Barrymore in his first two feature films. The company produced both short and feature-length productions. In 1916, the company merged with the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company to form Famous Players- Lasky Corporation, which later became Paramount Pictures.

Distribution and habitat The San Joaquin antelope squirrel is found in the San Joaquin Valley, including slopes and ridge tops along the western edge of the valley. It is endemic to the region, and is found in a much smaller range today than it originally inhabited. Since the San Joaquin Valley fell under heavy agricultural cultivation, habitat loss combined with rodenticide use has reduced the squirrels numbers enough that it is now listed as a threatened species. Most of today's remaining San Joaquin antelope squirrels can be found in the Carrizo Plain, where their original habitat remains undisturbed. The squirrels live in small underground familial colonies on sandy, easily excavated grasslands in isolated locations in San Luis Obispo and Kern Counties. Common vegetation associated with the squirrel includes Atriplex and Ephedra, and some junipers. The binomial of this species commemorates the American naturalist Edward William Nelson. Description =Physical Characteristics= The San Joaquin antelope squirrel is dull yellowish-brown or buffy-clay in color on upper body and outer surfaces of the legs with a white belly and a white streak down each side of its body in the fashion of other antelope squirrels. The underside of the tail is a buffy white with black edges. Males are approximately 9.8 inches and females are approximately 9.4 inches in length. =Breeding= Studies by Hawbecker provide abundant information on breeding and the life cycle of Nelson's antelope squirrel. They breed in late winter to early spring and have nearly all their young in March. Once pregnant, gestation lasts a little less than a month. The young do not emerge from their dens until approximately the first week of April. Nelson's antelope squirrel has only one breeding season, which is timed appropriately so that the young are born during the time of year when green vegetation is the most abundant. =Growth= Weaning is thought to start or be completed even before the young emerge. Once above ground, young are seen foraging for food independently. During the weaning period, the mother feeds alone and ignores any attempt of the young trying to nuzzle or nurse from her. A mother will sometimes spend the night in a different den if necessary. By early to mid-May the young squirrels have had their juvenile pelage for some time and begin to show the changes into adult pelage. By summer, the adult pelage is present. Once an individual has reached adulthood it is difficult to tell differences in age. Nelson's antelope squirrel is a short-lived species that often does not survive to a year. However, several individuals have been observed to live more than four years in the wild. Group size and home range Colonies have about six or eight individuals, however these individuals are not distributed evenly across their range. There is usually about 1 per hectare. Nelson's antelope squirrel prefers deep, rich soil types since they are easy to dig through in both winter and summer temperatures. Although these squirrels may dig for food, they do not make their own burrows. Instead they claim abandoned Dipodomys (kangaroo rats) burrows as their own. Both males and females have the same size home range of about 4.4 hectare. Of course, there are areas of concentration within this range where the squirrels spend the majority of their time. Diet 200px It is omnivorous, feeding on seeds, green vegetation, insects, and dried animal matter. It occasionally caches food. Redstem fialree (Erodium cicutarium) and brome grass (Bromus rubens) are important food items for the squirrels. However, their diet may differ depending on the time of day or time of year. Green vegetation is the most common diet type from December to mid-April because it is the most abundant during this period. Likewise, insects make up more than 90% of the squirrel's diet from mid-April to December because they are more abundant. Although seeds are available for most of the year, it is not the preferable diet of the squirrels. They will choose insects or green vegetation when available over seeds, even if the seeds are more abundant and easier to access. Some speculate that this could be due to the higher amount of water in insects and green vegetation, which would be necessary for the species to survive in such a hot, dry climate. Unfortunately for the Nelson's antelope squirrel, there is not an abundant water source nearby. Under laboratory conditions, the squirrels readily accept water. However, they can also survive at least 7 months in the shade without water. At the end of 7 months they appeared relatively healthy and not at all emaciated. Behavior Nelson's antelope squirrels are social animals. When individually taken out of their home range and released in an unknown area, they seem helpless and confused. They do not expend much energy throughout the day because of the extreme temperatures in their environment. In fact, when in the direct sunlight, a temperature of 31-32 ¬∞C can kill them. Therefore, there is little activity from the squirrels during the heat of the day. Although there is no evidence of hibernation, the squirrels are not bothered by the cold and can survive temperatures below freezing, in their burrows. They are not early risers and are usually not seen until after sunrise, however it does forage in the morning and evening, avoiding the midday heat. Around noon the squirrels disappear into their burrows and are not seen again until about 2 pm at the earliest. On moderate days, the squirrels will take their time foraging, in contrast to bringing as much food back to their burrows as quickly as possible on hot or cold days. The squirrels are also known to fully stretch out and roll over in the dust on the ground. These dust baths appear to be very enjoyable activities for the squirrels and may also be used to prevent infestation of parasites. Nelson's antelope squirrels are cautious when emerging from their burrows. They have a specific route that they follow when foraging for food. If danger seems near, they will run into a burrow along their foraging route to get to safety. They move quickly and do not spend much time in one place. They are particular about what they choose to eat and very rarely even waste time to pick up food they are not interested in. There are other features in addition to their quick movements that help keep them from danger. They whitish color of the underside of their tail can be seen when they run. The squirrels will curl their tail forward over their back and flick and twitch it back and forth as it runs. This movement can present the illusion of thistledown fluttering in the wind, which could be ignored by any potential predators. To further help prevent predation, the Nelson's antelope squirrel has an alarm call. These alarm calls are not loud, but associated with convulsive body movements. Horned larks and the white-crowned sparrow also aid in predator detection. Squirrels will listen to alarm calls given by these two birds. The badger (Taxidea taxus) is a main predator of Nelson's antelope squirrel and will destroy burrows to get its meal. Coyotes (Canis latrans) and San Joaquin Valley Kit Fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) are also known to consume the squirrels, but they are not a main part of their diet. Threats Increasing agriculture and urban development is an increasing problem for Nelson's antelope squirrel. This species will not colonize cultivated land. Therefore, an increase in agriculture land is taking away their habitat and leaving them with no alternative. Grazing livestock further destroys what habitat may be left, and exotic plants are able to take over native grasses that the squirrel forages upon and relies on for shade and cover. Also, pesticide drift from nearby agricultural fields encroaches in on the existing squirrel habitat. Not only are these practices affecting the population of the Nelson's antelope squirrel, but they are also causing problems for other native animal and plant species in the San Joaquin Valley. Native plant species such as the kern mallow, San Joaquin woolly threads, California jewelflower, and Bakersfield cactus are all federally endangered plant species that are being outcompeted by invasive plant species. Many invasive plants grow in very dense patches. These dense patches are not adequate habitats for Nelson's antelope squirrel and many other San Joaquin Valley Species. Conservation Efforts There have been attempts to manage the invasive species and other anthropogenic causes to species decline in the San Joaquin Valley.. Prescribed burns are one option to control invasive plant species, however this method can cause native species to also be killed and can be expensive. Studies determining the effects of cattle grazing on the land are also being done so that plans can be developed to reduce the impact on the land. Suggestions of using prescribed grazing to help reduce the growth of non-native species in the valley. Other control efforts include chemical and mechanical treatments, however these too can be time consuming and expensive, especially for large areas. Also, the use of herbicides could potentially negatively affect species in the San Joaquin Valley if there are significant winds that spread the chemicals. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has a recovery plan dated 1998 that includes the ideas of using Safe Harbor Agreements (SHA's) under Section 10 of the Endangered Species Act. This could potentially begin a relationship between the USFWS and the farm landowners to help determine the best compromise in order to manage the endangered species of the valley. A multispecies approach to conservation is important because of the increasing number of native species becoming threatened and endangered in the San Joaquin Valley. Management on an ecosystem level would allow the role of all the species to be taken into account. Also, an increase in awareness and education of the public around the Valley may further help increase funding for conservation and management plans. Monitoring and studying of the species is needed to determine just how threatened the species is and what needs to be done to reestablish stable populations in the valley. Unfortunately, most information found on the Nelson's antelope squirrel discuss the problems and reasons of declines, but do not give much insight on the potential recovery of the species. Even in 1918, Grinnell and Dixon believed it to only be a matter of time before the species faces extinction. References *Thorington, R. W. Jr. and R. S. Hoffman. 2005.

It states that it is an \\"international membership organization whose members use both L. Ron Hubbard management technology and embrace the responsibilities and ethical standards of WISE membership.\\" History Hubbard said about the early Churches of Scientology: \\"They are not business and so fail when they try to operate like one\\". He then began creating a new system of organizing these churches with the stated purpose of \\"Disseminating Scientology to the world\\"; this new system was modified continually until about 1980. In the late '60s, a project began compiling his notes into hard bound volumes that later became known as the Organization Executive Course, or OEC. Originally intended as a training program for church executives (hence the name), Hubbard later made them available to all church staff and stated that all staff should train on them. However, the OEC was stated to work for any kind of organization. Businesses not connected to the church wishing to improve their own success reportedly began hiring trained church staff in the '70s, causing problems within the church. In the 1980s, Hubbard created WISE with the intention of giving any non-church related organization a means to train their own staff, so that Scientology churches and missions could train their staff without fear of losing them to other groups. WISE was officially incorporated in 1979.The Growth of WISE Organization *WISE headquarters are located in Los Angeles, California, 6331 Hollywood Blvd, in the Hollywood Guaranty Building.

Ron Hubbard listing 21 moral precepts. The booklet is distributed by The Way to Happiness Foundation International, a Scientology- related nonprofit organization founded in 1984. The Way to Happiness is used as part of Scientology's Criminon rehabilitation program and is promoted by Scientology celebrities. The unsolicited distribution of personalised copies of the booklet to schools and mayors' offices has caused controversy, and while it is promoted as secular in nature, critics have stated that it includes ideas that are specific to Scientology, and is used as a recruiting tool. The booklet has been translated into 70 languages.

Service Determinations Regarding Scientology-Related Entities., CoS / IRS Closing Agreement, Operation Clambake. Booklet The Way to Happiness booklet contains a set of 21 precepts, which were written by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. The precepts are: 1.Take Care of Yourself, 2. Be Temperate, 3. Don't Be Promiscuous, 4. Love and Help Children, 5. Honor and Help your Parents, 6. Set a Good Example, 7. Seek to Live with the Truth, 8. Do Not Murder, 9. Don‚Äôt Do Anything Illegal, 10.

The code is not limited to negative prohibition of actions that are bad, (stealing, killing, promiscuity, illegalities) but also the positive advisement of good actions (‚Äúcare of oneself, temperateness, respect for parents, aid for children, truthfulness, safeguard of environment, etc.‚Äù) It was first published in 1981 by Regent House, Los Angeles as a 48-page paper-covered booklet (). This book is frequently given out by Scientologists. A campaign in the early 1990s to distribute the book in United States schools was described in Church of Scientology publications as \\"the largest dissemination project in Scientology history\\" and \\"the bridge between broad society and Scientology.\\" Additional convenience link at . A song titled \\"The Way to Happiness\\" appears on the music album The Road to Freedom, with music and lyrics by Hubbard. The Way to Happiness forms the core of the Church of Scientology prison program Criminon. It is also used in the Scientology- affiliated organization Narconon - all clients receive a pamphlet of The Way to Happiness when they begin the program. Volunteer Ministers, a Scientology- affiliated organization which responds to disaster scenes, distributes The Way to Happiness pamphlets, and did so in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, and the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre. The Scientology organization Concerned Businessmen's Association of America (CBAA) has also distributed The Way to Happiness, though representatives of the group have denied connections to Scientology. A 1993 article in Newsweek described cases where schools in Bellflower, California and Brooklyn, New York were influenced by CBAA to use The Way to Happiness in their schools, without knowing of the connections to Scientology. A 1990 Los Angeles Times article described the situation of a school in Fresno, California, where CBAA representatives refused to sponsor a contest at the school if The Way to Happiness pamphlet was not distributed. The booklet has been distributed to hotels. Promoted by celebrities Scientologist Nancy Cartwright, the voice actor for Bart Simpson, mailed 1 million copies of The Way to Happiness booklet to residents of San Fernando Valley, California in December 2007. Cartwright told the Daily News of Los Angeles: \\"The mailing was from me to the San Fernando Valley community, the highest gang-infested area of Los Angeles. I thought it would make an impact, give someone a tool in order to make their lives happier at home.\\" Isaac Hayes distributed The Way to Happiness pamphlets at his jazz performances in 2005. Tom Cruise has distributed The Way to Happiness pamphlets, and passed out brochures embossed with his name at the elementary school where the 2005 movie War of the Worlds was filmed. He also gave copies of the pamphlet to managers of United International Pictures, the company which distributed War of the Worlds overseas. In a Church of Scientology-produced promotional video which appeared on YouTube in January 2008, Cruise cites \\"the way to happiness\\" as one of the benefits of Scientology: \\"When you're a Scientologist and you drive by an accident, you know you have to do something about it, because you know you're the only one who can really help,\\" said Cruise. \\"We are the way to happiness. We can bring peace and unite cultures.\\" Actor Miles Fisher parodies this quote by Cruise, in a scene in the 2008 film Superhero Movie. Fisher's character in the film states that he can \\"eat planets\\" and that he is \\"the way to happiness\\". Courses The Church of Scientology offers two courses based on The Way to Happiness: \\"The Way to Happiness Course\\", done at a Church organization or mission and \\"The Way to Happiness Extension Course\\", which can be done at home. There is also the \\"Happiness Rundown\\" which is a Scientology procedure of a \\"Rundown\\" including auditing. Controversy =Deceptive and misleading distribution= In 1992, teachers in Anchorage, Alaska found copies of The Way to Happiness in their school mailboxes accompanied by a letter inviting the teachers to order more copies and distribute them to their students. Parents complained to the school district, and the school districts director of secondary education, Bill Mell, instructed school principals to tell teachers not to order The Way to Happiness. Mell told the Anchorage Daily News: \\"I don't know that it went to every teacher ... It looks as if they got a hold of the teachers' mailing list.\\" A local businessman and Scientologist who was a member of the Concerned Businessmen's Association of America organization paid for the books to be distributed to the schools, and told the Anchorage Daily News that he believed both The Way to Happiness and the Concerned Businessmen's Association of America were not affiliated with the Church of Scientology. At a 2005 fundraiser for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Clearwater, Florida, attendants found The Way to Happiness booklets in their goodie bags. The booklets contained the insignia of Boys & Girls Clubs on the front cover, and instructions on the back cover stating that additional copies could be obtained at the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Suncoast facilities. Carl Lavender, executive director of the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Suncoast, said that this usage of the Boys & Girls Clubs was unauthorized: \\"...I'm not pleased. You can't produce materials with our logo on it unless I give permission. We are going to collect all of them back and have them discarded.\\" Joanie Sigal of the Scientology volunteer group Clearwater Community Volunteers, and a member of the Clearwater Boys & Girls Club's board of managers, had originally suggested adding the Club's insignia and distributing the booklets, and requested that the corporate board officially endorse the booklet. Executive director Lavender denied the request, stating: \\"The booklet ends as of today ... There needs to be a lesson. This cannot happen.\\" In 2005, Commander Mike Downing of the Los Angeles Police Department complained that \\"the Church of Scientology forged his endorsement on The Way To Happiness Web site, prompting the LAPD to disavow any endorsement of Scientology and The Way To Happiness.\\" In 2007, The Way to Happiness Foundation produced and distributed pamphlets with sample endorsements from the mayors of Dallas, Texas and San Francisco, California. The books were sent to mayor's offices, accompanied by a letter asking mayors to purchase copies of the books for distribution in their city. The mayor of Dallas did not appreciate this unauthorized usage of the mayor's logo and the official seal of the city of Dallas, stating: \\"Clearly we were not very comfortable and did not think it was appropriate to use the seal of the city of Dallas, the mayor's logo or my name on something we were not aware of.\\" According to a report in The Dallas Morning News, the city attorney's office of Dallas looked into possible options of response regarding the matter. Unauthorized use of the logo of the City of San Francisco, and image of its mayor, Gavin Newsom, on The Way to Happiness pamphlet, October 2007. Similarly, in San Francisco, California, the mayor's office also received a boxful of the booklets and voiced displeasure with the unauthorized usage of the mayor's image, logo, and the seal of the city. According to a report by the Associated Press, the city ordered the Scientology group to stop using an unauthorized picture of Mayor Gavin Newsom on its promotional pamphlets. An official spokesman for the mayor of San Francisco released a statement, saying: \\"The mayor does not support the unauthorized use of his image or the city seal on this booklet.\\" The city attorney for San Francisco wrote a letter to \\"The Way to Happiness Foundation\\", citing California state law, which prohibits deceptive and misleading advertising that could create an appearance that the pamphlets are from a government agency. The city attorney also cited San Francisco law, writing that the Board of Supervisors must approve any commercial use of the city's official seal. In Winnipeg, Manitoba a box of pamphlets was delivered to the mayor's office with the official City of Winnipeg logo and the image of mayor Sam Katz. No legal action was taken: \\"This is obviously a sample sent to our office and it was not approved or paid for by our office... If material was being distributed on our behalf with a false endorsement, it would be a different story.\\" In a 2007 published US embassy cable, Ursula Caberta, the Director of the Working Group on Scientology (created by the Hamburg State Parliament to address all \\"destructive groups\\" which endanger society), obtained a booklet that contained the Hamburg mayor's photograph and signature, yet was actually a publication from The Way to Happiness Foundation. Caberta contended that \\"Scientology regularly used misleading methods to fool individuals into joining and said that such booklets had been distributed to other German cities. For someone unfamiliar with Scientology publications, the booklet looked very much like information brochures from the City of Hamburg.\\" In October 2007, uniformed police officers visiting Whyalla High School in Australia distributed a booklet called \\"Whyalla High School presents the way to happiness, a common-sense guide for better living\\", against the school's guidelines for religious education. One parent told the Adelaide, Australia paper The Advertiser she had specifically told the school not to give religious instruction to her children, and other parents mistakenly thought that the booklets were distributed by the Education Department because Whyalla High School was displayed on the booklet's cover. In March 2008, The Way to Happiness Foundation agreed to stop sending thousands of unsolicited, personalized copies of the booklet to elected officials in Florida after hundreds of them complained. Booklets sent to mayors had the mayor's name on the front, and an endorsement from the mayor on the back, along with the Florida state flag and the address of the town hall. A note advised prospective readers to contact town hall if they had further questions. The Foundation said it had sent about 2,800 mailings, comprising a total of 250,000 booklets, to Florida mayors, businesses and community groups. Following the complaints, the Foundation explained that the books were only samples meant to encourage the recipients to buy further copies, and said that it would henceforth send out unpersonalized stock copies only. Unlike many mayors who were reported to have been displeased at seeing their names on the personalized samples, Anthony Masiello, the mayor of Buffalo from 1994 to 2005, did authorize distribution of the booklet, complete with the city seal and a picture of the city hall, after a Scientology center opened in Buffalo in 2003. =False claims of affiliation= In a speech given at a New Year's event in 2007, David Miscavige, the current leader of the Church of Scientology, claimed that the distribution of the booklet is aided by \\"corporate tie-ins\\", mentioning 7-Eleven in Taiwan, Coca-Cola Pakistan, Philips Electronics in Pakistan, and Dell in Africa as companies who supported the Foundation as part of their efforts to address their \\"third-world image problems\\". A video of the speech was released to YouTube in February 2008. A spokesman for Dell told the Los Angeles Times that they had researched the matter with their colleagues in Africa and elsewhere and found \\"no evidence that this is accurate ... it's not our practice to disseminate religious materials of any kind.\\" Representatives from Philips and 7-Eleven told the Los Angeles Times that they were unaware of any such association, but said they were looking into the matter. =Denying affiliation with Scientology= The Way to Happiness pamphlet caused controversy in Sderot, Israel in February 2008, when a group calling itself the \\"Association for Prosperity and Security in the Middle East\\" became active in the city. The non-profit group sent e-mails to social workers in Sderot, offering to help people cope with Kassam rocket attacks the city has been enduring. Dalia Yosef, head of an umbrella psychological organization in the region called Hosen Center, received complaints from multiple social workers about the e-mails, and stated: \\"We intend to investigate this association, as we do every group that offers social and psychological services in Sderot\\". In an e-mail response to The Jerusalem Post, the Association for Prosperity stated: \\"We are unaware of any Scientology activity whatsoever being offered to Sderot residents. In general, regarding your question on Scientology activity in Sderot or elsewhere, you should contact the official representatives of the religion and receive their response\\". A representative of Scientology told The Jerusalem Post that the director-general of the Association for Prosperity was a Scientologist, as were most individuals in the organization, but that some were not, and said that the principles found in The Way to Happiness were \\"totally different\\" from Scientology. The organization stated: \\"Claiming our organization is connected with Scientology just because our director-general studied Scientology is like saying that other nonprofits are hi-tech because volunteers work in hi-tech.\\" Director-general of the Israeli Center for Cult Victims Ayelet Kedem described the organization as a front group for Scientology: \\"Hiding behind a front organization is a common tactic... The idea is to create a positive image by obscuring the connection with Scientology... Later, people who undergo free workshops are convinced that they must correct flaws in their personality by taking Scientology courses. Those who are hooked end up giving all their possessions to the Church of Scientology\\". In Illinois in 2011, Rep. Dan Burke (D-Chicago) sponsored a resolution endorsing the \\"Good Choices\\" program, which is based on The Way to Happiness, as one of a number of suitable tools for teaching character, morals and values. Actress Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson and a Scientologist, submitted testimony to a House education committee, stating the program had \\"nothing to do with religion.\\" Opponents voiced concerns about the program's links to the Scientology belief system, and said that promoting its use in schools would violate the principle of the separation of church and state. Burke accepted that the program's Scientology links were more substantial than he had thought. He said he would work on the resolution and present it again at a later date. The reporter stated, \\"Not even the voice of Bart Simpson could convince Illinois lawmakers to approve a resolution aimed at teaching character in public schools because of its link to the Church of Scientology.\\" =Validity of secular claim= The Way to Happiness is described by the foundation as \\"a non-religious moral code, based entirely on common sense, which is having profound effects around the world\\". The religious scholar Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi states he has performed an extensive search in the history of religions, and has been unable to find a single case in which \\"a religion was publicly propagating a secular version of its ethical system\\". To illustrate the uniqueness of the booklet, he gave the following analogy: \\"How about a secular, improved version of the Ten Commandments?\\" The text uses key words and concepts taken directly from Scientology beliefs ‚Äì for example that \\"survival\\" is the fundamental point of life, that you can be truly happy if you become the \\"cause\\" of your own actions, and that the truth is \\"what is true for you.\\" A Brooklyn school principal who at first appreciated the booklet as \\"a values-oriented book about righteousness and peace\\" stopped using it after becoming aware that it contained \\"an undercurrent of a religious nature.\\" Critics argue that The Way to Happiness is primarily a recruiting tool for the church. According to Vicki Aznaran, former Inspector General of the Church's highest ecclesiastical organization, the Religious Technology Center, The Way to Happiness Foundation is \\"a front group to get people into Scientology\\" and the book is designed \\"to make Scientology palatable to the masses.\\" See also * Church of Spiritual Technology * Concerned Businessmen's Association of America * Volunteer Ministers * Youth for Human Rights International References External links * Category:Scientology publications Category:Glendale, California Category:Non-fiction works by L.

A 2007 study of radiocarbon dating proposed a narrower date range of 1750 to 1530 BC. The culture was named after the site discovered at Erlitou in Yanshi, Henan. The culture was widely spread throughout Henan and Shanxi and later appeared in Shaanxi and Hubei. Chinese archaeologists generally identify the Erlitou culture as the site of the Xia dynasty, but there is no firm evidence, such as writing, to substantiate such a linkage.  Erlitou site  Bronze jue (wine vessel) The Erlitou culture may have evolved from the matrix of Longshan culture. Originally centered around Henan and Shanxi province, the culture spread to Shaanxi and Hubei provinces. After the rise of the Erligang culture, the site at Erlitou diminished in size but remained inhabited. Discovered in 1959 by Xu Xusheng, Erlitou is the largest site associated with the culture, with palace buildings and bronze smelting workshops. Erlitou monopolized the production of ritual bronze vessels, including the earliest recovered dings. The city is on the Yi River, a tributary of the Luo River, which flows into the Yellow River. The city was ; however, because of flood damage only are left. The Erlitou Relic Museum, located in Luoyang, Henan province, which has more than 2,000 items excavated from the Erlitou site in its collection, opened in October 2019.http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2019-10/22/content_75327646.htm =Phases= Plan of palace 1 (phase III) The site's growth is divided into four phases. During Phase I, covering , Erlitou was a rapidly growing regional center with an estimated population of several thousand people, but not yet an urban civilization. Urbanization began in Phase II, expanding to with a population of around 11,000. A palace area of was demarcated by four roads. It contained the Palace 3, composed of three courtyards along a 150-metre axis, and Palace 5\\\\. A bronze foundry was established to the south of the palatial complex and was controlled by the elite. The city reached its peak in Phase III, and may have had a population of around 24,000. The palatial complex was surrounded by a two-meter-thick rammed-earth wall, and Palaces 1, 7, 8 and 9 were built. Palace 1, the largest, had an area of . Palaces 3 and 5 were abandoned and replaced by Palace 2, measuring , and Palace 4. In Phase IV, the population decreased to around 20,000, but building continued. Palace 6 was built as an extension of Palace 2, and Palaces 10 and 11 were built. Phase IV overlaps with the Lower Phase of the Erligang culture (1600‚Äì1450 BC). Around 1600 BC, a walled city was built at Yanshi, about northeast of Erlitou. Production of bronzes and other elite goods ceased at the end of Phase IV, at the same time as the Erligang city of Zhengzhou was established to the east. There is no evidence of destruction by fire or war, but, during the Upper Erligang phase (1450‚Äì1300 BC), all the palaces were abandoned, and Erlitou was reduced to a village of . =Inventions= The earliest metal bells, with one found in the Taosi site, and four in the Erlitou site, dated to about 2000 BC, may have been derived from the earlier pottery prototype. The first bronze dagger-axe or ge appeared at the Erlitou site, where two were being found among the over 200 bronze artifacts (as of 2002) at the site, three jade ge were also discovered from the same site. Relation to traditional accounts Traditional Xia sites (black) and Erlitou sites (red) A major goal of archaeology in China has been the search for the capitals of the Xia and Shang dynasties described in traditional accounts as inhabiting the Yellow River valley. These originally oral traditions were recorded much later in histories such as the Bamboo Annals () and the Records of the Grand Historian (1st century BC), and their historicity, particularly regarding the Xia, is an area of debate for the Doubting Antiquity School of Chinese history. The discovery of writing in the form of oracle bones at Yinxu in Anyang definitively established the site as the last capital of the Shang, but such evidence is unavailable for earlier sites. Early symbols appearing on ceramics; from the site of Yanshi near Erlitou site When Xu Xusheng first discovered Erlitou, he suggested that it was Bo, the first capital of the Shang under King Tang in the traditional account. Since the late 1970s, archaeologists in China have tended to identify the site with Zhenxun, the last Xia capital. The traditional account of the overthrow of the Xia by the Shang has been identified with the ends of each of the four phases of the site by different authors. The Xia‚ÄìShang‚ÄìZhou Chronology Project identified all four phases of Erlitou as Xia, and the construction of the Yanshi walled city as the founding of the Shang. Other scholars, particularly outside China, point to the lack of any firm evidence for such an identification, and argue that the historiographical focus of Chinese archaeology is unduly limiting. Archaeological evidence of a large outburst flood that destroyed the Lajia site on the upper reaches of the Yellow River has been dated to about 1920 BC. This date is shortly before the rise of the Erlitou culture in the middle Yellow River valley and the Yueshi culture in Shandong, following the decline of the Longshan culture in the North China Plain. The authors suggest that this flood may have been the basis for the later myth, and contributed to the transition of cultures. They further argue that the timing is further evidence for the identification of the Xia with the Erlitou culture. However, no evidence of contemporaneous widespread flooding in the North China Plain has yet been found.

In the 1940s, Salter introduced to American psychotherapy a Pavlovian model of hypnotherapy and self-hypnosis training. Career Andrew Salter received a BA from NYU, and was \\"grand-fathered in\\" as a practicing (Manhattan at 1000 Park Avenue at East 84th Street) psychologist with only a BA. Salter spoke seven languages fluently . He first made his mark clearing out the alcoholic's ward at New York's Bellevue Hospital by treating patients with hypnosis and teaching them self-hypnosis (autosuggestion). Criticism of Psychoanalysis Salter was the first nationally recognized opponent of psychoanalysis. He was a dedicated critic of Freud. His book \\"The Case Against Psychoanalysis\\" was so controversial that the New York Times gave it two reviews, one extremely positive and one extremely negative. Salter proclaimed in this post-war tome, \\"psychoanalysis has outlived its usefulness.\\" Salter chucked psychoanalysis and replaced it with Pavlovian conditioning under hypnosis. In the conditioned reflex, he has seen the essence of hypnosis. He gave a rebirth to hypnotism by combining it with classical conditioning. Andrew Salter was and remains the most passionate opponent of Classical Freudian Psychoanalysis and believed that A. A. Brill (who was Sigmund Freud's official English translator) had \\"homogenized\\" Freud's work and deliberately omitted passages which Brill considered to be too radical, conflicting or bizarre. Salter spent three years studying everything Freud and his contemporaries had written, including correspondence with Carl Jung and Anna Freud, mostly in the original German before writing his \\"autopsy\\" of Psychoanalysis, \\"The Case Against Psychoanalysis\\" which today remains the best work ever written critiquing Freud's theories. Today's academic texts \\"soft pedal\\" many of Freud's theories, making Psychoanalysis more \\"palatable\\" due largely in part to Salter's works and those who came after him. Behaviorism Salter also brought attention to the fact that Pavlovian Psychology was a lot more than simple Classical Conditioning, citing the work done in Pavlov's Russian laboratory for over a quarter of a century. Salter is considered by many to be the \\"father of behavior therapy\\". Salter is certainly one of the first psychotherapists who adapted and applied learning theories to clinical practice. Salter believed in releasing personal \\"inhibitions\\" by practicing techniques leading to what he called \\"excitation\\" which results in \\"disinhibition\\", a state which he described as akin to being slightly drunk. Chapter 8 in \\"Conditioned Reflex Therapy\\" contains all of the \\"exercises\\" (like the deliberate use of the word \\"I\\") leading to a state of excitation. Today, excitation, a term from the Pavlovian lexicon, might be referred to as a combination of \\"assertion\\" and \\"disinhibition\\". Salter, as did other \\"behaviorists\\" of the time, also had his patients learn & practice Edmund Jacobson's technique of \\"progressive relaxation\\". Hypnotherapy Salter's hypnotic and relaxation techniques were first explained in his book, \\"What Is Hypnosis?\\" which was proclaimed a work of genius by Theodore X. Barber, a physiologist who researched hypnotic induction (Barber and Calverley) during the post World War II era. In 1941, Salter published an article entitled 'Three techniques of autohypnosis'. Salter wrote an article describing the modus operandi of self-hypnosis but couldn't get it published. None of the professional journals would touch the piece. At length, after many rebuffs, he sent a copy to Professor Clark Leonard Hull, of Yale University's Psychology Department. Hull was the author of a work entitled Hypnosis and Suggestibility: An Experimental Approach. Hull read Salter's article (though he had never heard of Salter) and was sufficiently impressed to send it along to the Journal of General Psychology, of which he was an editor. Salter's technique was developed over the space of two years during which he tested the methods with just over 200 subjects. Salter described methods of teaching self-hypnosis by: #Autohypnosis by post-hypnotic suggestion #Autohypnosis by memorised trance instructions (scripted suggestions) #Fractional autohypnosis (part learning) Salter's behavioral approach, influenced by Hull, was a primitive precursor of modern hypnotic skills training programmes such as the Carleton Skills Training Programme developed by Nicholas Spanos. Assertiveness Salter is often considered to be the founder of assertiveness training, although he did not use the term himself. His book Conditioned Reflex Therapy (1949) describes many case studies in which he used primitive assertiveness techniques, termed \\"excitatory exercises\\", which became the basis of subsequent behavior therapy for assertiveness. Legacy Salter's techniques were revived among college students during the early and mid-1970s at Bernard M. Baruch College (City University of New York) by Richard Rodriguez, a student leader and newspaper Editor-in-Chief of \\"The (Baruch College) Ticker\\". Rodriguez was introduced to Salter's work by ex- Marine and fellow student, Brian Guerre. After corresponding with Salter, Rodriguez held training sessions on campus in the office of his \\"Health Sciences Society\\" organization which he founded in 1972. Over a two-year period, Rodriguez trained over two hundred students in progressive relaxation and autosuggestion, which improved the students' ability to study and perform better on exams. Mr. Rodriguez's motto was \\"relax to your purpose\\". Rodriguez has also advanced the theory that all human conflict is based on each individual's (or group's) unfulfilled (long-term/lifelong) expectations, which may be modified to a limited extent, through Salter's techniques of personality reconstruction. In a 2008 phone interview, Rodriguez remarked: \\"Although we now know much more about the workings and chemistry of the brain than was known 65 years ago, Salter's techniques remain extremely effective and life altering. His works remained in print for over 25 years and have been translated in over a dozen languages and his books have earned numerous accolades. Proponents of Behavior Modification, Assertiveness Training, Auto- relaxation, Progressive (Systematic) Desensitization & Psychoprophylaxis have all used principles and applications proposed, developed or applied by Salter, whether or not they acknowledge that reality.\\" Publications The Salter family has recently promoted the re-publication of \\"Conditioned Reflex Therapy\\" which was Salter's most influential work. Obituary Obituary: New York Times Andrew Salter, Behavior Therapist, 82, Dies By Karen Freeman (Published: October 9, 1996) Andrew Salter, a psychologist who helped develop the theoretical underpinnings and clinical applications of behavior therapy decades before the field became popular, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 82. The cause was cancer, said Dr. William J. Salter, his son. Mr. Salter, recognized as a founder of behavior therapy, was one of the first to take the findings from experimental psychology on things like conditioned reflexes and apply those principles to solving people's problems. He rejected psychoanalysis, with its years of probing into the roots of neuroses, arguing in the 1940s that a psychologist could help people who were overly anxious, shy or depressed much more quickly by teaching them to change their behavior. Dr. Gerald C. Davison, a psychology professor at the University of Southern California, wrote that Mr. Salter had been so far ahead of the behaviorist wave of the 1960s that many younger behavioral psychologists were unaware of his work. He said Mr. Salter's ideas have become so widely accepted that he is often not formally cited when contemporary writers in behavior therapy refer to assertion training, expressiveness training, 'getting in touch with one's feelings,' all early ideas of Mr. Salter's that became popular later. Dr. Davison made those comments in recommending that the Association for Advancement of Behavior Therapy present Mr. Salter with its lifetime achievement award, which it will do posthumously, on Nov. 23. He is the second psychologist to win the award. Mr. Salter took an unconventional path to an unusual career. Born in Waterbury, Conn., he graduated from New York University in 1937 with a bachelor's degree in psychology and a burning interest in research, but no patience for postgraduate work. I had no desire to spend the rest of my life studying the reactions of rats lost in labyrinths, he once said. He plunged into research and clinical practice, which was possible with a bachelor's degree at the time, and was allowed to continue to practice when the state later set more rigid licensing standards. He continued his practice until a few months ago. Hypnosis had captured Mr. Salter's interest in college, and he looked for ways to use it in clinical practice. He developed techniques for self-hypnosis but initially found it hard to publish his work because he did not have the necessary academic credentials. A psychologist at Yale University, Dr. Clark Leonard Hull, helped him publish an article in The Journal of General Psychology in 1941. He came to national attention that year when Life magazine publicized his ideas about short-term psychotherapy. In 1944, he published his first book, What Is Hypnosis? In 1949, Mr. Salter published Conditioned Reflex Therapy, which took many of the principles developed by those who did watch rats run mazes and used them to develop short-term therapies for neuroses. In an interview, Dr. Davison called it a landmark book in experimentally based psychotherapy. The therapy Mr. Salter employed encouraged patients to express their emotions and used visual imagery to reduce anxiety. It also moved people past their fears by gradually getting them accustomed to being around the things they feared. [progressive or systematic desensitization] In 1952, Mr. Salter published The Case Against Psychoanalysis, in which he looked at the scientific basis for that field and pronounced it weak. The book generated much controversy, said Dr. Alan E. Kazdin, a psychology professor at Yale, particularly because Mr. Salter used such vivid language to wield his literary club. One of his phrases was that trying to pin down psychoanalysis was like nailing lemon meringue to a wall, Dr. Kazdin said. But what made him special was that he didn't just criticize. He came up with an alternative, applied it and helped develop a whole movement. Besides his son William, of Harvard, Mass., Mr. Salter is survived by his wife, Rhoda; another son, Robert, of Tarrytown, N.Y.; a sister, Bertha Seigel of Montgomery County, Md., and three grandchildren. * [Obituary Submitted by Richard Rodriguez (July 23, 2008), with gratitude, admiration and respect] In the media In the original Frank Sinatra film The Manchurian Candidate the Chinese cite Salter's work as their inspiration to brainwash the soldiers.

After the Civil War, he was appointed by Bishop Daniel Payne as a missionary of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Carolina. Early life and education Cain was born to a black father and a Cherokee mother in Greenbrier County, Virginia, which is now in West Virginia. He was raised in Gallipolis, Ohio, a free state where he was allowed to read and write. He attended Wilberforce University and attended divinity school in Hannibal, Missouri. The American Civil War broke out while he was at Wilberforce. He later claimed that he and 115 students from the mostly black University attempted to enlist in the Union Army but were refused. Career Cain worked as a barber in Galena, Illinois, and worked on steamboats along the Ohio River before he migrated south. He had been licensed to preach for the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1844. His first assignment was in Hannibal, Missouri. In 1848, frustrated by the segregationist policies of the Methodists, he joined the African Methodist Episcopal Church, an independent black denomination started in Philadelphia. By 1859 he became a deacon in Muscatine, Iowa. In 1861, Cain was called as a pastor at the Bridge Street Church in Brooklyn, New York. In 1862, he was ordained as an elder in 1862 and remained at the Brooklyn church until 1865. After the Civil War, Cain moved to Charleston, South Carolina, in 1865 as superintendent of AME missions and presided over the Emmanuel Church in that city. The AME Church attracted tens of thousands of converts to its denomination very rapidly. Cain became active in politics, serving as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1868. He represented Charleston County in the South Carolina Senate from 1868 to 1872. He also edited the South Carolina Leader newspaper (later renamed the Missionary Record). As editor, he hired future congressmen Robert B. Elliott and Alonzo Ransier. He was elected as a Republican to the Forty-third United States Congress in a newly created at-large district. He was on the Committee on Agriculture, but focused more on the civil rights bill which eventually passed in diluted form in 1875. He gave noted speeches on the bill in January, 1873. He did not run for re-election in 1874 after redistricting, but ran for the 2nd district in 1876. He was elected to the Forty-fifth United States Congress. In 1877, while advocating in Congress for mail service to West African Colonies, Cain became a member of the Liberian Exodus Joint Stock Steamship Company. In 1880, Cain was elected and consecrated a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Church; he served the episcopal district which comprised Louisiana and Texas. He helped found Paul Quinn College and served as its president until 1884. Cain then moved to Washington, D.C., where he served as AME bishop over the Mid-Atlantic and New England States. He died in Washington on January 18, 1887, and was buried in Graceland Cemetery there, but may have been removed to Woodlawn Cemetery (Washington, D.C.) about a decade later, when Graceland closed and many of its interments were reburied in Woodlawn.Edgar, Walter.

Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, also known as Rajarshi Shahu was considered a true democrat and social reformer. Shahu Maharaj was an able ruler who was associated with many progressive policies during his rule. From his coronation in 1894 till his demise in 1922, he worked for the cause of the lower caste subjects in his state. Primary education to all regardless of caste and creed was one of his most significant priorities. Maharaja of Kolhapur in 1894 Early life H.H. Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj seated with palace servants He was born as Yeshwantrao in the Ghatge Maratha family, of Kagal village of the Kolhapur district as Yeshwantrao Ghatge to Jaisingrao and Radhabai in 26 June 1874. Jaisingrao Ghatge was the village chief, while his mother Radhabhai hailed from the royal family of Mudhol. Young Yeshwantrao lost his mother when he was only three. His education was supervised by his father till he was 10-year- old. In that year, he was adopted by Queen Anandibai, widow of King Shivaji IV, of the princely state of Kolhapur. Although the adoption rules of the time dictated that the child must have Bhosale dynasty blood in his veins, Yeshwantrao‚Äôs family background presented a unique case. He completed his formal education at the Rajkumar College, Rajkot and took lessons of administrative affairs from Sir Stuart Fraser, a representative of the Indian Civil Services. He ascended the throne in 1894 after coming of age, prior to which a regency council appointed by the British Government took care of the state affairs. During his accession Yeshwantrao was renamed as Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj. Chhatrapati Shahu was over five feet nine inches in height and displayed a regal and majestic appearance. Wrestling was one of his favourite sports and he patronised the sport throughout his rule. Wrestlers from all over the country would come to his state to participate in wrestling competitions. He was married to Lakshmibai Khanvilkar, daughter of a nobleman from Baroda in 1891. The couple had four children ‚Äì two sons and two daughters. Vedokta controversy When Brahmin priests of the royal family refused to perform the rites of non-Brahmins in accordance with the Vedic hymns, he took the daring step of removing the priests and appointing a young Maratha as the religious teacher of the non-Brahmins, with the title of Kshatra Jagadguru (the world teacher of the Kshatriyas). This was known as the Vedokta controversy. It brought a hornet's nest about his ears, but he was not the man to retrace his steps in the face of opposition. He soon became the leader of the non-Brahmin movement and united the Marathas under his banner. Social reform Group at Residency including the Maharaja of Kolhapur Chhatrapati Shahu occupied the throne of Kolhapur for 28 years, from 1894 to 1922; during this period he initiated numerous social reforms in his empire. He is credited with doing much to improve conditions for the lower castes. He also ensured suitable employment for students thus educated, thereby creating one of the earliest affirmative action (50% reservation to weaker sections) programs in history. Many of these measures came in to effect in the year 1902. He started Shahu Chhatrapati Weaving and Spinning Mill in 1906 to provide employment. Rajaram college was built by Shahu Maharaj, and later was named after him. His emphasis was on education, his aim being to make learning available to the masses. He introduced a number of educational programs to promote education among his subjects. He established hostels for different ethnicities and religions, including Panchals, Devadnya, Nabhik, Shimpi, Dhor- Chambhar communities as well as for Muslims, Jains and Christians. He established the Miss Clarke Boarding School for the socially quarantined segments of the community. Shahu introduced several scholarships for poor yet meritorious students from backward castes. He also initiated compulsory free primary education for all in his state. He established Vedic Schools which enabled students from all castes and classes to learn the scriptures, thus propagating Sanskrit education among all. He also founded special schools for village heads or ‚Äòpatils‚Äô to make them better administrators. Sahu was a strong advocate of equality among all strata of society and refused to give the Brahmins any special status. He removed Brahmins from the post of Royal Religious advisers when they refused to perform religious rites for non- Brahmins. He appointed a young Maratha scholar in the post and bestowed him the title of \`Kshatra Jagadguru' (the world teacher of the Kshatriyas). This incident together with Shahu‚Äôs encouragement of the non-Brahmins to read and recite the Vedas led to the Vedokta controversy in Maharashtra. This dispute brought a storm of protest from the elite strata of society and vicious opposition to his rule. He established the Deccan Rayat Association in Nipani during 1916. The association sought to secure political rights for non- Brahmins and invite their equal participation in politics. Shahu was influenced by the works of Jyotiba Phule, and long patronized the Satya Shodhak Samaj, formed by Phule. In his later life, he eventually moved towards the Arya Samaj. In 1903, he attended the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, and in May that year received the honorary degree LL.D. from the University of Cambridge. Shahu made great efforts to abolish the concept of caste segregation and untouchability. He introduced (perhaps the first known) reservation system in government jobs for untouchable castes. His Royal Decree ordered his subjects to treat every member of society as equal, and granting the untouchables equal access to public utilities like wells and ponds, as well as establishments like schools and hospitals. He legalised inter-caste marriage and made great efforts to improve the situation of the dalits. He discontinued the hereditary transfer of titles and tenures of revenue collectors. He also worked towards betterment of the condition of women in his empire. He established schools to educate women, and also spoke vociferously on the topic of women's education. He legalised widow remarriage in 1917 and made efforts towards stopping child marriage. In 1920, Shahu introduced a law banning the devadasi Pratha, the practice of offering girls to God, which essentially led to sexual exploitation of girls at the hands of the clergy. Shahu introduced a number of projects which enabled his subjects to sustain themselves in their chosen professions. The Shahu Chhatrapati Spinning and Weaving Mill, dedicated marketplaces and co-operative societies for farmers were established to free his subjects from predacious middlemen in trading. He made credits available to farmers looking to buy equipment to modernise agricultural practices, and even established the King Edward Agricultural Institute to instruct farmers in increasing crop yield and related techniques. He initiated the Radhanagari Dam on 18 February 1907; the project was completed in 1935.and made Kolhapur self-sufficient in water. He was a great patron of art and culture, encouraging music and the fine arts. He supported writers and researchers in their endeavours. He installed gymnasiums and wrestling pitches and highlighted the importance of health consciousness among the youth. His seminal contribution in social, political, educational, agricultural and cultural spheres earned him the title of Rajarshi, which was bestowed upon him by the Kurmi warrior community of Kanpur.  Association with Ambedkar  Chhatrapati was introduced to Dr. Ambedkar by artists Dattoba Pawar and Dittoba Dalvi. The Maharaja was greatly impressed by the great intellect of young Bhimrao and his revolutionary ideas regarding untouchability. The two met a number of times during 1917-1921 and went over possible ways to abolish the negatives of caste segregation by providing \\"caste-based reservation\\" to selected people. They organised a conference for the betterment of the untouchables (thereby validating the unfortunate definition of untouchability) during 21‚Äì22 March 1920 and the Chhatrapati made Ambedkar the Chairman as he believed that Ambedkar was the leader who would work for the amelioration of the segregated segments of the society. He even donated Rs. 2,500 to Ambedkar, when the latter started his newspaper ‚ÄòMooknayak‚Äô on 31 January 1921, and contributed more later for the same cause. Their association lasted till the Chhatrapati‚Äôs death in 1922. Personal life H.H.Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj sitting amongst crowds watching a wrestling match In 1891, Shahu married Lakshmibai n√©e Khanvilkar (1880‚Äì1945), daughter of a Maratha nobleman from Baroda. They were the parents of four children: * Rajaram III, who succeeded his father as Maharaja of Kolhapur. * Radhabai 'Akkasaheb' Puar, Maharani of Dewas (senior)(1894‚Äì1973) who married Raja Tukojirao III of Dewas(Senior) and had issue: **Vikramsinhrao Puar, who became Maharaja of Dewas (Senior) in 1937 and who later succeeded to the throne of Kolhapur as Shahaji II. * Sriman Maharajkumar Shivaji (1899‚Äì1918) * Shrimati Rajkumari Aubai (1895); died young  Death  Chhatrapati Shahu died on 6 May 1922 in Bombay. He was succeeded by his eldest son Rajaram III as the Maharaja of Kolhapur. The reforms initiated by Chhatrapati Shahu gradually began to fade for the lack of able leadership to carry on the legacy.

It was developed for Stardock as part of their ThinkDesk subscription service, but is available separately. Operation and features Multiplicity is unlike remote desktop applications in that instead of opening windows to a client computer on a host computer‚Äôs desktop, the mouse pointer and keyboard focus shifts from one computer to another. It is closer in concept to a KVM switch, but while these have multiple cables to each computer, with Multiplicity the keyboard and mouse remain connected to the host computer and input is forwarded from the host to client machines via network connections -- typically over TCP/IP port 30564. Each computer uses its own display. Switching is triggered by movement of the mouse to the appropriate side of the screen (or keyboard shortcuts, if desired), both from the desktop and in full-screen video modes. Multiplicity comes in two versions; the standard Multiplicity has the ability to copy and paste images and text between computers, while Multiplicity Pro can control up to nine client computers and can copy files, folders, and other data between machines. Supported platforms as of 2016 are Windows 10, 8, 7 and Vista; Windows XP (32-bit only); and Windows Server 2003 / 2003 R2, 2008 / 2008 R2, 2012 / 2012 R2. Multiplicity can emulate the capability of the KVM switch and let one display serve all the connected computers. The modern alternative would be the combination of an HDMI switch and a USB switch (aka a KVM), but the software-hardware comparison remains equally valid. Multiplicity does not permit combining computers with different operating systems, like macOS and Linux.

A BartPE system image is created using PE Builder, a freeware program created by Bart Lagerweij. It requires a legal copy of Windows XP or Windows Server 2003. Additional applications can be included in the image using plugins. As it often resides on a Live CD or USB drive, BartPE allows a user to boot Windows, even if a hardware or software fault has disabled the installed operating system(s) on the internal hard drive ‚Äì for instance, to recover files. It can also be used to scan for and remove rootkits, computer viruses and spyware (that have infected boot files), or to reset a lost administrator password. Overview While a bootable floppy disk can be used to help recover a failing hard disk, one major limitation on using a floppy disk that booted a standalone copy of MS/DOS was that \\"DOS can't handle NTFS hard-drive partitions.\\" BartPE is a reasonable first choice for Windows users: it's free, and it's #2 in a list of alternatives; #1 is Linux- oriented. While it can be used for running demos, it can also be used \\"to bring a dead PC back to life.\\" =PE Builder= PE Builder 3.1.10a PE Builder (also known as Bart PE Builder) is the software used to create the BartPE system images. Description As with Windows Preinstallation Environment, BartPE operates by loading system registry files into RAM, and not writing any registry changes back to boot media. Thus, neither operating system requires an operational hard drive or network access. This also allows them to be run from non-writable media such as a CD-ROM. Since each instance of BartPE is a new installation, the BartPE \\"boot\\" disk needs original Windows setup files in order to operate. The Bart PE Builder application interprets and condenses files from a Windows setup CD to create the BartPE installation. It can built from a Windows XP Pro or Home Edition CD, or from a preinstalled Windows XP version (without a CD). Additional applications can be included in the BartPE setup through the use of \\"plugins\\". A plugin contains setup information for a specific application, so that it can be included on the media and installed along with Windows at each BartPE boot. Currently there are a few hundred plugins available in addition to the dozen-odd that are included by default with BartPE. Since BartPE represents a totally independent operating environment, the most obvious application examples involve backup, restoration, diagnosis and error-correction of systems with malfunctioning primary storage drives. Plugin programs can nominally be added to the capacity of the BartPE media. BartPE is known to have certain incompatibilities with the Windows XP CDs shipped with most Dell PCs. The Dell versions include changes to the Windows setup files that can cause the BartPE build process to fail. Two patches are currently available to correct the known problems, one to replace SETUPREG.HIV and the other to load a standard iastor.sys. BartPE cannot create Windows Vista. or Windows 7 Live DVDs.

Habitat This tyrant flycatcher is found in tall trees and shrubs, including the edges of savanna and marshes. It makes a flimsy cup nest in a tree. The female incubates the typical clutch of two cream eggs, which are marked with reddish brown. Description The adult gray kingbird is an average-sized kingbird. It measures in length and weighs from .Dunning, John B., Jr. (ed.) (1992). CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses. CRC Press. . The upperparts are gray, with brownish wings and tail, and the underparts are white with a gray tinge to the chest. The head has a concealed yellow crown stripe, and a dusky mask through the eyes. The dark bill is heavier than that of the related, slightly smaller, tropical kingbird. The sexes are similar, but young birds have rufous edges on the wing coverts, rump and tail. Call The call is a loud rolling trill, pipiri pipiri, which is the reason behind many of its local names, like pestigre or pitirre, in the Spanish-speaking Greater Antilles, or petchary in some of the English-speaking zones. Diet and behaviour Gray kingbirds wait on an exposed perch high in a tree, occasionally sallying out to feed on insects, their staple diet. Like other kingbirds, these birds aggressively defend their territory against intruders, including mammals and much larger birds such as caracaras, red-tailed hawks and broad-winged hawks. Distribution & range It is found in increasing numbers in the state of Florida, and is more often found inland though it had been previously restricted to the coast. The species was first described on the island of Hispaniola, then called Santo Domingo, thus the dominicensis name. It breeds from the extreme southeast of the United States, mainly in Florida, through Central America, through the West Indies, south to Venezuela, Trinidad, Tobago, the Guiana, and Colombia. Northern populations are migratory, wintering on the Caribbean coast of Central America and northern South America. Several vagrant populations are known to exist in the American Northeast.

He served as a United States Representative from Alabama, for one term from 1873 until 1875. Born free in Alabama, he received his higher education and law degree in Scotland and Canada before being admitted to the bar in Tennessee.Howard N. Rabinowitz, ed., Southern Black Leaders of the Reconstruction Era (1982), pp. 79-100. Rapier was a nationally prominent figure in the Republican Party as one of seven blacks serving in the 43rd Congress. He worked in 1874 for passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which guaranteed equal access to public accommodations. Early life and education James T. Rapier was born free in 1837 in Florence, Alabama to John H. Rapier, a prosperous local barber, and his wife, who were established free people of color. He had three older brothers. His father had been emancipated in 1829; his mother was born into a free black family of Baltimore, Maryland. She died in 1841 when Rapier was four years old. In 1842 James and his brother John Jr. went to Nashville, Tennessee to live with their paternal grandmother Sally Thomas.Brett J. Derbes, \\"James T. Rapier\\", Encyclopedia of Alabama, 27 June 2012; accessed 19 April 2018\\"James Thomas Rapier\\", Black Past, accessed 6 April 2014 There they attended a school for African-American children, and learned to read and write. In 1856 Rapier traveled to Canada with his uncle Henry Thomas, his father's half-brother, who settled in Buxton, Ontario, an all-black community made up chiefly of African Americans. It was developed with the aid of Rev. William King, a Scots-American Presbyterian missionary. King had bought land (with Canadian government approval) for resettlement of black American refugees who had escaped to Canada during the slavery years via the Underground Railroad. The African Americans were building a thriving community, and Rapier's uncle had property there. Rapier attended the Buxton Mission School, which was highly respected and had a classical education. He pursued higher education in three stages, first earning a teaching degree in 1856 at a normal school in Toronto. He traveled to Scotland to study at the University of Glasgow. Returning to Canada, he completed his law degree at Montreal College and was admitted to the bar. Return to US and career After teaching for a time at the Buxton Mission School, Rapier moved in 1864 to Nashville, Tennessee. He attended Franklin College, a historically black college, to gain a teaching certificate. Working as a reporter for a northern newspaper, Rapier bought 200 acres in Maury County, Tennessee, and became a cotton planter. He made a keynote speech at the Tennessee Negro Suffrage Convention. He continued as an advocate for black voting rights but was disappointed in the return of Confederates to state office. With his father needing help, Rapier returned to his home in Alabama in 1866. There he bought 550 acres and again cultivated cotton. He became active in the Republican Party, serving as a delegate to the 1867 state constitutional convention. In 1870 Rapier ran for Alabama Secretary of State and lost. In 1872 he was elected to the Forty-third United States Congress from Alabama's 2nd congressional district, one of three African-American congressmen elected from the state during Reconstruction. While in Congress, he had national scope. Rapier proposed authorizing a land bureau to allocate Western lands to freedmen. He also proposed that Congress appropriate $5 million to devote to public education in Southern schools. He was one of seven black Congressmen at the time; in 1874 they each testified for the Civil Rights Act, which was signed in 1875. Rapier recalled being denied service at every inn at stopping points between Montgomery, Alabama, and Washington, DC, despite being a US Congressman. He noted how the race issue in the United States society related to what were often class and religious inequalities in other lands, and said that he was \\"half slave and half free\\", having political rights but no civil rights. He said that in Europe, \\"they have princes, dukes, and lords; in India, \\"brahmans or priests, who rank above the sudras or laborers;\\" in America, \\"our distinction is color.\\"Eric Foner, Reconstruction, America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877, Harper Collins, 1988; Perennial Classics, 1989 paperback, p. 533 After losing his re-election campaign in 1874, Rapier was appointed by the Republican presidential administration as a collector for the Internal Revenue Service in Alabama, serving in this role until his death. He campaigned against the conservative Democratic Party's Redeemer government in Alabama, but Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1874. After passing other restrictive laws that created Jim Crow rules, in 1901 white Democrats passed a new state constitution that required poll taxes and literacy tests for persons trying to register to vote. Under subjective white administration, these barriers essentially disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites in Alabama, excluding them from the political system for decades into the late 20th century. Rapier died in Montgomery, Alabama on May 31, 1883 of pulmonary tuberculosis. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. The Rapier Family Papers are held by Howard University. =Misrepresentation by Dunning School= In 1979 historian John Hope Franklin gave a presidential address to the American Historical Association. He discussed how Walter L. Fleming of Vanderbilt University, one of the most prominent of the influential historians of the 20th-century Dunning School, had written about Rapier. Franklin observed that Fleming's viewpoint, which had been hostile to civil and voting rights for African Americans, may have led him to make errors. Franklin said: :Writing in 1905 Walter L. Fleming referred to James T. Rapier, a Negro member of the Alabama constitutional convention of 1867, as \\"Rapier of Canada.\\" He then quoted Rapier as saying that the manner in which \\"colored gentlemen and ladies were treated in America was beyond his comprehension.\\" [Fleming, Civil War and Reconstruction in Alabama] In a footnote to his address, Franklin added: \\"Fleming knew better, for in another place‚Äîdeep in a footnote (p. 519)‚Äîhe asserted that Rapier was from Lauderdale, \\"educated in Canada\\".\\" Franklin explained: :Born in Alabama in 1837, Rapier, like many of his white contemporaries, went North for an education. The difference was that instead of stopping in the northern part of the United States, as, for example, (the pro-slavery advocate) William L. Yancey did, Rapier went on to Canada. Rapier's contemporaries did not regard him as a Canadian; and, if some were not precisely clear about where he was born (as was the Alabama State Journal, which referred to his birthplace as Montgomery rather than Florence), they did not misplace him altogether. [Loren Schweninger, James T. Rapier and Reconstruction (Chicago, 1978), xvii, 15.] Franklin said: \\"In 1905 Fleming made Rapier a Canadian because it suited his purposes to have a bold, aggressive, 'impertinent' Negro in Alabama Reconstruction come from some non-Southern, contaminating environment like Canada. But it did not suit his purposes to call Yancey, who was a graduate of Williams College, a 'Massachusetts Man.' Fleming described Yancey (a white Confederate) as, simply, the 'leader of the States Rights men.'\\" [Fleming, Civil War and Reconstruction in Alabama, p. 12.] For a detailed account and comparison of Yancey and other white Southerners who went North to secure an education, see Franklin's book, A Southern Odyssey: Travelers in the Antebellum North (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1976), pp. 45‚Äì80. Franklin is critical of Fleming for falsely stating that Rapier, and others, were \\"carpetbaggers.\\" Franklin said, \\"...some of the people that Fleming called carpetbaggers had lived in Alabama for years and were, therefore, entitled to at least as much presumption of assimilation in moving from some other state to Alabama decades before the war as the Irish were in moving from their native land to some community in the United States. ...Whether they had lived in Alabama for decades before the Civil War or had settled there after the war, these \\"carpetbaggers\\" were apparently not to be regarded as models for Northern investors or settlers in the early years of the twentieth century. Twentieth-century investors from the North were welcome provided they accepted the established arrangements in race relations and the like. Fleming served his Alabama friends well by ridiculing carpetbaggers, even if in the process he had to distort and misrepresent.\\"\\"Historians: John Hope Franklin\\", American History Association See also * Civil rights movement (1865‚Äì1896) * List of African-American United States Representatives References Further reading *Bailey, Richard.

See the Software section for making such an animation. A dynamical billiard is a dynamical system in which a particle alternates between free motion (typically as a straight line) and specular reflections from a boundary. When the particle hits the boundary it reflects from it without loss of speed (i.e. elastic collisions). Billiards are Hamiltonian idealizations of the game of billiards, but where the region contained by the boundary can have shapes other than rectangular and even be multidimensional. Dynamical billiards may also be studied on non-Euclidean geometries; indeed, the first studies of billiards established their ergodic motion on surfaces of constant negative curvature. The study of billiards which are kept out of a region, rather than being kept in a region, is known as outer billiard theory. The motion of the particle in the billiard is a straight line, with constant energy, between reflections with the boundary (a geodesic if the Riemannian metric of the billiard table is not flat). All reflections are specular: the angle of incidence just before the collision is equal to the angle of reflection just after the collision. The sequence of reflections is described by the billiard map that completely characterizes the motion of the particle. Billiards capture all the complexity of Hamiltonian systems, from integrability to chaotic motion, without the difficulties of integrating the equations of motion to determine its Poincar√© map. Birkhoff showed that a billiard system with an elliptic table is integrable.  Equations of motion  The Hamiltonian for a particle of mass m moving freely without friction on a surface is: :H(p, q) = \\\\frac {p^2}{2m} + V(q) where V(q) is a potential designed to be zero inside the region \\\\Omega in which the particle can move, and infinity otherwise: :V(q) = \\\\begin{cases} 0 &q; \\\\in \\\\Omega \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\infty &q; otin \\\\Omega \\\\end{cases} This form of the potential guarantees a specular reflection on the boundary. The kinetic term guarantees that the particle moves in a straight line, without any change in energy. If the particle is to move on a non-Euclidean manifold, then the Hamiltonian is replaced by: :H(p, q) = \\\\frac{1}{2m}p^i p^j g_{ij}(q) + V(q) where g_{ij}(q) is the metric tensor at point q \\\\;\\\\in\\\\; \\\\Omega. Because of the very simple structure of this Hamiltonian, the equations of motion for the particle, the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equations, are nothing other than the geodesic equations on the manifold: the particle moves along geodesics.  Notable billiards and billiard classes  =Hadamard's billiards= Hadamard's billiards concern the motion of a free point particle on a surface of constant negative curvature, in particular, the simplest compact Riemann surface with negative curvature, a surface of genus 2 (a two-holed donut). The model is exactly solvable, and is given by the geodesic flow on the surface. It is the earliest example of deterministic chaos ever studied, having been introduced by Jacques Hadamard in 1898. =Artin's billiard= Artin's billiard considers the free motion of a point particle on a surface of constant negative curvature, in particular, the simplest non-compact Riemann surface, a surface with one cusp. It is notable for being exactly solvable, and yet not only ergodic but also strongly mixing. It is an example of an Anosov system. This system was first studied by Emil Artin in 1924. =Dispersing and Semi-Dispersing billiards= Let M be complete smooth Riemannian manifold without boundary, maximal sectional curvature of which is not greater than K and with the injectivity radius \\\\rho >0 . Consider a collection of n geodesically convex subsets (walls) B_i \\\\subset M , i =1, \\\\ldots, n , such that their boundaries are smooth submanifolds of codimension one. Let B = M \\\\ (\\\\bigcup_{i=1}^n \\\\operatorname{Int}(B_i)) , where \\\\operatorname{Int}(B_i) denotes the interior of the set B_i . The set B \\\\subset M will be called the billiard table. Consider now a particle that moves inside the set B with unit speed along a geodesic until it reaches one of the sets Bi (such an event is called a collision) where it reflects according to the law ‚Äúthe angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection‚Äù (if it reaches one of the sets B_i \\\\cap B_j , i eq j , the trajectory is not defined after that moment). Such dynamical system is called semi-dispersing billiard. If the walls are strictly convex, then the billiard is called dispersing. The naming is motivated by observation that a locally parallel beam of trajectories disperse after a collision with strictly convex part of a wall, but remain locally parallel after a collision with a flat section of a wall. Dispersing boundary plays the same role for billiards as negative curvature does for geodesic flows causing the exponential instability of the dynamics. It is precisely this dispersing mechanism that gives dispersing billiards their strongest chaotic properties, as it was established by Yakov G. Sinai. Namely, the billiards are ergodic, mixing, Bernoulli, having a positive Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and an exponential decay of correlations. Chaotic properties of general semi- dispersing billiards are not understood that well, however, those of one important type of semi-dispersing billiards, hard ball gas were studied in some details since 1975 (see next section). General results of Dmitry Burago and Serge Ferleger on the uniform estimation on the number of collisions in non-degenerate semi-dispersing billiards allow to establish finiteness of its topological entropy and no more than exponential growth of periodic trajectories. In contrast, degenerate semi-dispersing billiards may have infinite topological entropy. = Lorentz gas, aka Sinai billiard = A particle moving inside the Sinai billiard, also known as Lorentz gas. The table of the Lorentz gas (also known as Sinai billiard) is a square with a disk removed from its center; the table is flat, having no curvature. The billiard arises from studying the behavior of two interacting disks bouncing inside a square, reflecting off the boundaries of the square and off each other. By eliminating the center of mass as a configuration variable, the dynamics of two interacting disks reduces to the dynamics in the Sinai billiard. The billiard was introduced by Yakov G. Sinai as an example of an interacting Hamiltonian system that displays physical thermodynamic properties: almost all (up to a measure zero) of its possible trajectories are ergodic and it has a positive Lyapunov exponent. Sinai's great achievement with this model was to show that the classical Boltzmann-Gibbs ensemble for an ideal gas is essentially the maximally chaotic Hadamard billiards. = Bunimovich stadium = The table called the Bunimovich stadium is a rectangle capped by semicircles, a shape called a stadium. Until it was introduced by Leonid Bunimovich, billiards with positive Lyapunov exponents were thought to need convex scatters, such as the disk in the Sinai billiard, to produce the exponential divergence of orbits. Bunimovich showed that by considering the orbits beyond the focusing point of a concave region it was possible to obtain exponential divergence. = Magnetic billiards = Movement of a charged particle inside a Sinai billiard with perpendicular magnetic field. Magnetic billiards represent billiards where a charged particle is propagating under the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. As a result, the particle trajectory changes from a straight line into an arc of a circle. The radius of this circle is inversely proportional to the magnetic field strength. Such billiards have been useful in real world applications of billiards, typically modelling nanodevices (see Applications). = Generalized billiards = Generalized billiards (GB) describe a motion of a mass point (a particle) inside a closed domain \\\\Pi \\\\,\\\\subset\\\\, \\\\mathbb{R}^n with the piece-wise smooth boundary \\\\Gamma. On the boundary \\\\Gamma the velocity of point is transformed as the particle underwent the action of generalized billiard law. GB were introduced by Lev D. Pustyl'nikov in the general case, and, in the case when \\\\Pi is a parallelepiped in connection with the justification of the second law of thermodynamics. From the physical point of view, GB describe a gas consisting of finitely many particles moving in a vessel, while the walls of the vessel heat up or cool down. The essence of the generalization is the following. As the particle hits the boundary \\\\Gamma, its velocity transforms with the help of a given function f(\\\\gamma,\\\\, t), defined on the direct product \\\\Gamma \\\\,\\\\times\\\\, \\\\mathbb{R}^1 (where \\\\mathbb{R}^1 is the real line, \\\\gamma \\\\,\\\\in\\\\, \\\\Gamma is a point of the boundary and t \\\\,\\\\in\\\\, \\\\mathbb{R}^1 is time), according to the following law. Suppose that the trajectory of the particle, which moves with the velocity v, intersects \\\\Gamma at the point \\\\gamma \\\\,\\\\in\\\\, \\\\Gamma at time t^*. Then at time t^* the particle acquires the velocity v^*, as if it underwent an elastic push from the infinitely-heavy plane \\\\Gamma^*, which is tangent to \\\\Gamma at the point \\\\gamma, and at time t^* moves along the normal to \\\\Gamma at \\\\gamma with the velocity \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial t} (\\\\gamma,\\\\, t^*). We emphasize that the position of the boundary itself is fixed, while its action upon the particle is defined through the function f. We take the positive direction of motion of the plane \\\\Gamma^* to be towards the interior of \\\\Pi. Thus if the derivative \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial t} (\\\\gamma,\\\\, t) \\\\;>\\\\; 0, then the particle accelerates after the impact. If the velocity v^*, acquired by the particle as the result of the above reflection law, is directed to the interior of the domain \\\\Pi, then the particle will leave the boundary and continue moving in \\\\Pi until the next collision with \\\\Gamma. If the velocity v^* is directed towards the outside of \\\\Pi, then the particle remains on \\\\Gamma at the point \\\\gamma until at some time \\\\tilde{t} \\\\;>\\\\; t^* the interaction with the boundary will force the particle to leave it. If the function f(\\\\gamma,\\\\, t) does not depend on time t; i.e., \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial t} \\\\;=\\\\; 0, the generalized billiard coincides with the classical one. This generalized reflection law is very natural. First, it reflects an obvious fact that the walls of the vessel with gas are motionless. Second the action of the wall on the particle is still the classical elastic push. In the essence, we consider infinitesimally moving boundaries with given velocities. It is considered the reflection from the boundary \\\\Gamma both in the framework of classical mechanics (Newtonian case) and the theory of relativity (relativistic case). Main results: in the Newtonian case the energy of particle is bounded, the Gibbs entropy is a constant, English translation in Russian Mathematical Surveys, 60(2), pp. 365-366 (2005). (in Notes) and in relativistic case the energy of particle, the Gibbs entropy, the entropy with respect to the phase volume grow to infinity, (in Notes), references to generalized billiards.  Quantum chaos  The quantum version of the billiards is readily studied in several ways. The classical Hamiltonian for the billiards, given above, is replaced by the stationary-state Schr√∂dinger equation H\\\\psi \\\\;=\\\\; E\\\\psi or, more precisely, :-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2 \\\\psi_n(q) = E_n \\\\psi_n(q) where abla^2 is the Laplacian. The potential that is infinite outside the region \\\\Omega but zero inside it translates to the Dirichlet boundary conditions: :\\\\psi_n(q) = 0 \\\\quad\\\\mbox{for}\\\\quad q otin \\\\Omega As usual, the wavefunctions are taken to be orthonormal: :\\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\overline{\\\\psi_m}(q)\\\\psi_n(q)\\\\,dq = \\\\delta_{mn} Curiously, the free-field Schr√∂dinger equation is the same as the Helmholtz equation, :\\\\left( abla^2 + k^2\\\\right)\\\\psi = 0 with :k^2 = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\hbar^2}2mE_n This implies that two and three-dimensional quantum billiards can be modelled by the classical resonance modes of a radar cavity of a given shape, thus opening a door to experimental verification. (The study of radar cavity modes must be limited to the transverse magnetic (TM) modes, as these are the ones obeying the Dirichlet boundary conditions). The semi- classical limit corresponds to \\\\hbar \\\\;\\\\to\\\\; 0 which can be seen to be equivalent to m \\\\;\\\\to\\\\; \\\\infty, the mass increasing so that it behaves classically. As a general statement, one may say that whenever the classical equations of motion are integrable (e.g. rectangular or circular billiard tables), then the quantum-mechanical version of the billiards is completely solvable. When the classical system is chaotic, then the quantum system is generally not exactly solvable, and presents numerous difficulties in its quantization and evaluation. The general study of chaotic quantum systems is known as quantum chaos. A particularly striking example of scarring on an elliptical table is given by the observation of the so-called quantum mirage.  Applications  Billiards, both quantum and classical, have been applied in several areas of physics to model quite diverse real world systems. Examples include ray-optics, lasers, acoustics, optical fibers (e.g. double-clad fibers ), or quantum-classical correspondence. One of their most frequent application is to model particles moving inside nanodevices, for example quantum dots, pn- junctions, antidot superlattices, among others. The reason for this broadly spread effectiveness of billiards as physical models resides on the fact that in situations with small amount of disorder or noise, the movement of e.g. particles like electrons, or light rays, is very much similar to the movement of the point-particles in billiards. In addition, the energy conserving nature of the particle collisions is a direct reflection of the energy conservation of Hamiltonian mechanics.  Software  Open source software to simulate billiards exist for various programming languages.

Background Lead singer Michael's vocals were now showing the signs of his maturing tenor voice, while Jermaine's voice had become deeper in tone. Notably, one of Skywriter's songs, \\"Touch\\" (originally recorded by the Supremes in 1971), features Michael and Jermaine singing about satisfying a woman in bed. Due to the fact that Michael was only 14 years old at the time, \\"Touch\\" was one of the most controversial singles Michael had sung on until his solo career took off again in the late 1970s. The group was also growing frustrated with the direction they were going in and complained to Motown's staff producers and writers about the kind of music they were doing. The brothers were openly discouraged by the style of music they had been receiving from Motown's writers. Also, by this point, all five brothers were writing their own material, but Motown prevented them from recording their own compositions. The frustration was showcased most openly by the album cover, where all five brothers solemnly look at the camera around an early 1900s era airplane. It was the band's least successful album to date because of only one Top 20 single and a lack of promotion because the boys were on tour at this time.

The musical was made into a 1943 Technicolor film Du Barry Was a Lady, starring Red Skelton, Lucille Ball, Gene Kelly and Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra. Plot A washroom attendant, Louis Blore, has won a sweepstakes, and subsequently quits his job. He is in love with the nightclub singer May Daly, but she is in love with Alex Barton. Alex is the brother of her friend Alice, who is in love with Harry Norton. Meanwhile, Alex is unhappily married to Ann. Charley, Louis's replacement, suggests that Louis slip Alex a Mickey Finn. While trying to do so, Louis inadvertently drinks the Mickey Finn, falls asleep, and dreams he is King Louis XV of France, and that May is Madame du Barry. In his dream, Charley becomes the Dauphin (later Louis XVI) and Harry becomes the captain of the guard, with Ann as Du Barry's lady-in-waiting, and Alex as a peasant who wrote a rude song about The King and Du Barry (the title song: Du Barry Was a Lady). Eventually after various entanglements (including the Dauphin's shooting the King in the posterior with a bow and arrow), Louis wakes up and realises that Alex is the man for May. He uses the last of his winnings to pay for Alex's divorce from Ann, and (with Charley having just quit his job) goes back to being a washroom attendant.

Classical dance  Cambodia's premier performing art form is Khmer classical dance, or Robam Preah Reach Trop, a highly stylized dance form originating from the royal courts. Originally performed and maintained by attendants of the royal palaces, Khmer classical dance was introduced to the general public in the mid-20th century and became widely celebrated as iconic of Cambodian culture, often performed during public events, holidays, and for tourists visiting Cambodia. Performances feature elaborately costumed dancers performing slow and figurative gestures to the musical accompaniment of a pinpeat ensemble. The classical repertoire includes dances of tribute or invocation and the enactment of traditional stories and epic poems such as the Ramayana. Two of the most performed classical dances are the Robam Chuon Por (\\"Wishing dance\\") and the Robam Tep Apsara (\\"Apsara dance\\"). Other names for Khmer classical dance include \\"Cambodian court dance\\" and \\"the royal ballet of Cambodia\\", although the latter term can also refer to the National Dance Company of Cambodia. In Khmer, it is formally known as Robam Preah Reach Trop (, lit. \\"dances of royal wealth\\") or Lakhon Preah Reach Trop (, lit. \\"theatre of royal wealth\\"). It is also sometimes called Lakhon Luong (, lit. \\"the king's theatre\\"). During the Lon Nol regime of Cambodia, the dance tradition was referred to as Lakhon Kbach Boran Khmer (, lit. \\"Khmer theatre of the ancient style\\"), a term that distanced it from its royal legacy. = List of classical dances = File:Siem-Reap Dance of Cambodia (13).jpg File:Siem-Reap Dance of Cambodia (3).jpg File:Siem-Reap Dance of Cambodia (4).jpg File:Siem-Reap Dance of Cambodia (1).jpg File:Siem-Reap Dance of Cambodia (7).jpg Folk dance Created in the 20th century are folk dances that emphasize that various cultural traditions and ethnic groups of Cambodia.

He is best known for introducing, with Linus Pauling, the concept of the \\"molecular clock\\", which enabled the neutral theory of molecular evolution.  Life and work  Zuckerkandl was raised in Vienna, Austria in a household of intellectuals, but his family relocated in 1938 to Paris, and later Algiers, to escape the racial policy of Nazi Germany with respect to Jews. At the end of World War II, he spent one year at the University of Paris (Sorbonne), then came to the United States to study physiology‚Äîearning a master's degree in 1947 from the University of Illinois, under C. Ladd Prosser‚Äîthen returned to the Sorbonne to complete a Ph.D. in biology. Zuckerkandl developed a strong interest in molecular problems; his early research at a marine biology lab in Roscoff emphasized the roles of copper oxidases and hemocyanin in the molting cycles of crabs. In 1957, Zuckerkandl met renowned chemist Linus Pauling, who was becoming interested in molecular diseases and molecular evolution as an outgrowth of his activism on topics concerning nuclear power. They arranged a post-doctoral fellowship, and Zuckerkandl (now with his wife Jane) returned to the United States to work with Pauling at the California Institute of Technology beginning in 1959.Gregory J. Morgan, \\"Emile Zuckerkandl, Linus Pauling, and the Molecular Evolutionary Clock, 1959-1965\\", Journal of the History of Biology, Vol. 31 (1998), pp. 155-178. pp. 157, 159-161.

Prof. Zuckerkandl ferociously attacks ID and any belief in a designer, God, or other \\"superghost\\". = Linus Pauling and the molecular clock hypothesis = Zuckerkandl's first project under Pauling (working with graduate student Richard T. Jones) was the application of new protein identification techniques‚Äîa combination of paper chromatography and electrophoresis that produced a two-dimensional pattern‚Äîto hemoglobin. The peptide fragments of hemoglobin samples from different species, partially broken apart by digestive enzymes, would produce unique patterns that could be used to estimate differences of protein structure. Zuckerkandl, Jones and Pauling published a comparison of several species' hemoglobin identification patterns in 1960, observing that the degree of dissimilarity of protein patterns corresponded approximately to the phylogenetic distance between source species. However, the method was not conducive to quantitative comparisons, so Zuckerkandl began working on the determination of the actual peptide sequence of the Œ± and Œ≤ chains of human and gorilla hemoglobin.Gregory J. Morgan, \\"Emile Zuckerkandl, Linus Pauling, and the Molecular Evolutionary Clock, 1959-1965\\", Journal of the History of Biology, Vol. 31 (1998), pp. 155-178. pp. 161-162. In 1962, Pauling and Zuckerkandl published their first paper using the molecular clock concept (though not yet by that name). Like a number subsequent collaborative papers, it was not peer-reviewed‚Äîit was an invited paper in honor of Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi‚Äîand they intentionally took the opportunity to \\"say something outrageous\\". The paper used the number of differences in the Œ± and Œ≤ chains of hemoglobin to infer the time since the last common ancestor for a number of species, calibrated based on paleontological evidence for humans and horses. Though the paper did not provide any explanation for why amino acid differences in a protein should accumulate at a uniform rate (the essential assumption of the molecular clock), it did show that the results were fairly consistent with those of paleontologists.Gregory J. Morgan, \\"Emile Zuckerkandl, Linus Pauling, and the Molecular Evolutionary Clock, 1959-1965\\", Journal of the History of Biology, Vol. 31 (1998), pp. 155-178. pp. 163-166. During the succeeding years, Zuckerkandl worked to refine the molecular clock. In 1963, he and Pauling invented the term \\"semantides\\" for biological sequences‚ÄîDNA, RNA, and polypeptides‚Äîthat have evolutionary information and argued that such sequences could be the basis for constructing molecular phylogenies, suggesting that the \\"molecular clock\\" method might be useful for other semantides besides proteins. Emanuel Margoliash's first publication of sequence data for cytochrome c allowed comparison of the rates of molecular evolution for different proteins (cytochrome c seemed to evolve faster than hemoglobin), which Zuckerkandl discussed at a 1964 conference in Bruges. Zuckerkandl also adjusted the mathematics of the \\"clock\\" to account for the observation that some positions in an amino acid sequence were more stable than others, and the likelihood of multiple substitutions at the same position. In September 1964, he attended the important Evolving Genes and Proteins symposium, where he and Pauling presented their most influential paper (\\"Evolutionary Divergence and Convergence in Proteins\\", published in the conference proceedings the next year). The paper, primarily Zuckerkandl's work, named the \\"evolutionary clock\\" and presented a derivation of its basic mathematical form. Though Zuckerkandl and Pauling saw the clock as compatible with natural selection, it would later become the basis of the neutral theory of molecular evolution, in which genetic drift rather than selection is the driving force of evolution at the molecular level.Gregory J. Morgan, \\"Emile Zuckerkandl, Linus Pauling, and the Molecular Evolutionary Clock, 1959-1965\\", Journal of the History of Biology, Vol. 31 (1998), pp. 155-178. pp. 169-173. = Later work = In 1965, Zuckerkandl moved back to France to direct in Montpellier, the \\"Centre de Recherche de Biochimie Macromol√©culaire\\" of the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique.

They were among the youngest participants. After the competition, they started performing at university campuses and other tertiary institutions in Hong Kong. In 2001, they were discovered by Anthony Wong Yiu Ming, the chairman of the music production company People Mountain People Sea and a renowned singer-songwriter during the 90's. Lam and Loo was then signed by the company on 1 January 2002, and the group was named at17. The duo was invited to Amsterdam and performed as part of the Hong Kong Festival in 2005. From April 2006 to March 2007, they were appointed as MCs for TVB's popular weekly music show Jade Solid Gold and frequently performed live in the show. Their first mega concert Sing Sing Sing 2006 took place at AsiaWorld-Expo on 30 September 2006. Subsequently, they held a series of mini live shows called Just the two of us at Shouson Theatre, Hong Kong Arts Centre from 1 March 2007 to 1 May 2007, where they performed the songs of other artists. Both Loo and Lam were involved considerably in the songwriting and production for their albums. Loo played the guitar and piano, and Lam plays the guitar and various percussion instruments. Their style may be best described as folktronica. The group disbanded in 2010, as Loo pursued a solo career. Loo died after falling from her apartment building in Happy Valley, Hong Kong on 5 August 2018, at the age of 32.

Endnote: The best editions of Chiabrera are those of Rome (1718, 3 vols. 8vo); of Venice (1731, 4 vols. 8vo); of Leghorn (1781, 5 vols., 12mo); and of Milan (1807, 3 vols. 8vo).

Chiabrera was of patrician descent, and was born at Savona, a little town in the domain of the Genoese republic, twenty-eight years after the birth of Pierre de Ronsard, with whom he has far more in common than with the great Greek whose echo he sought to make himself. As he has told in the pleasant fragment of autobiography prefixed to his works, in which, like Julius Caesar, he speaks of himself in the third person, he was a posthumous child; he went to Rome at the age of nine years, under the care of his uncle Giovanni. There he read with a private tutor, suffered severely from two fevers in succession, and was sent at last, for the sake of society, to the Jesuits' College, where he remained till his twentieth year, studying philosophy, as he says, \\"rather for occupation than for learning's sake.\\" Delle opere di Gabriello Chiabrera (1757) Losing his uncle about this time, Chiabrera returned to Savona, \\"again to see his own and be seen by them.\\" In a little while, however, he returned to Rome, and entered the household of a cardinal, where he remained for several years, frequenting the society of Paulus Manutius and of Sperone Speroni, the dramatist and critic of Tasso, and attending the lectures and hearing the conversation of Mureto. His revenge of an insult offered him obliged him to betake himself once more to Savona, where, to amuse himself, he read poetry, and particularly Greek. The poets of his choice were Pindar and Anacreon, and these he studied until it grew to be his ambition to reproduce in his own tongue their rhythms and structures, and so to enrich his country with a new form of verse in his own words, \\"like his country-man, Columbus, to find a new world or drown.\\" His reputation was made at once; but he seldom quit Savona, though often invited to do so, saving for journeys of pleasure, in which he greatly delighted, and for occasional visits to the courts of princes whither he was often summoned, for his verse's sake, and in his capacity as a dramatist. At the ripe age of fifty he took to himself a wife, one Lelia Pavese, by whom he had no children. After a simple and blameless life, during which he produced a vast quantity of verse ‚Äî epic, tragic, pastoral, lyrical and satirical ‚Äî he died in Savona on October 14, 1638. An epitaph was written for him in elegant Latin by Pope Urban VIII,Siste Hospes./Gabrielem Chiabreram vides;/Thebanos modos fidibus Hetruscis/adaptare primus docuit:/Cycnum Dircaeum/Audacibus, sed non deciduis pennis sequutus/Ligustico Mari/Nomen aeternum dedit:/Metas, quas Vetustas Ingeniis/circumscripserat,/Magni Concivis aemulus ausus transilire,/Novos Orbes Poeticos invenit./Principibus charus/Gloria, quae sera post cineres venit,/Vivens frui potuit./Nihil enim aeque amorem conciliat/quam summae virtuti/juncta summa modestia. but on his tombstone are graven two quaint Italian hexameters of his own, in which the gazer is warned from the poet's own example not to prefer Parnassus to Calvary. A maker of odes in all their elaborate pomp of strophe and antistrophe, a master of new and complex rhythms, a coiner of ambitious words and composite epithets, an employer of audacious transpositions and inversions, and the inventor of a new system of poetic diction, it is not surprising that Chiabrera should have been compared with Ronsard. Both were destined to suffer eclipse as great and sudden as had been their glory. Ronsard was succeeded by Malherbe and by French literature, properly so-called; Chiabrera was the last of the great Italians, and after him literature languished till the second renaissance under Manzoni. Chiabrera, however, was a man of merit, apart from that of the mere innovator. Setting aside his epics and dramas (one of the latter received the honours of translation at the hands of Nicolas Chr√©tien, a sort of scenic du Bartas), much of his work remains yet readable and pleasant. His grand Pindarics are dull, it is true, but some of his Canzonette, like the anacreontics of Ronsard, are exceedingly elegant and graceful. His autobiographical sketch is also extremely interesting. The simple old poet, with his adoration of Greek (when a thing pleased him greatly he was wont to talk of it as \\"Greek Verse\\"), his delight in journeys and sight-seeing, his dislike for literary talk save with intimates and equals, his vanities and vengeances, his pride in the memory of favours bestowed on him by popes and princes, his infinita maraviglia over Virgil's versification and metaphor, his fondness for masculine rhymes and blank verse, his quiet Christianity, is a figure deserving perhaps of more study than is likely to be bestowed on that \\"new world\\" of art which it was his glory to fancy his own, by discovery and by conquest. Giambattista Marino was a contemporary of Chiabrera whose verses provide a comparison.

It was afterwards re- peopled by Palansi Chauhan from whom it took its modern name. Others say that it was founded by Pal Parmar whose brother Jagadev founded nearby Jagana village. History An aerial view of Jorawar Palace, 1936 The Jain texts mentions that Prahladana, brother of Paramara Dharavarsha of Abu, founded Prahladanapur in 1218 and built Prahladana-vihara dedicated to Pallaviya Parshwanatha. The town was re-peopled ruled by Chauhans around thirteenth century. At the start of the seventeenth century, the Palanpur State was taken over by Jhalori dynasty of the Pashtun Lohani tribe which was founded in 1373 and ruled from Jalore (Rajasthan). The dynasty came into historical prominence during the period of instability that followed the demise of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in the early 18th century. It was overrun soon afterwards by the Marathas; the Lohanis followed the trend of seeking recourse in the British East India Company against them and finally entered the subsidiary alliance system in 1817, along with all other neighbouring states, becoming a British protectorate. After independence of India in 1947, Palanpur State was dissolved in 1949 and merged with Union of India as a part of Bombay State. Subsequently Palanpur became the capital of Banaskantha district of Gujarat.

The gateways of the city-walls were Delhi Darwaja, Gathaman Darwaja, Malan Darwaja, Mira Darwaja, Virbai Darwaja, Salempura Darwaja, Sadarpur Darwaja or Shimla Darwaja. Only Mira Darwaja survives today. Sher Muhammad Khan attended the coronation ceremony of King George V in Delhi in 1910 and built a club named after him in 1913. In 1918, his successor Tale Muhammad Khan constructed Kirti Stambh, a 22 metre tower near the railway station commemorating the gallantry of his father and the history of town and his dynasty. He also built Balaram Palace between 1922 to 1936 and later Jorawar Palace (Currently used as Judicial Court) also. In 1939, he also built Shashivan, formerly Jahanara Baug, a garden to commemorate his second marriage with a daughter of an Australian businessman.

Fort Jay is the oldest existing defensive structure on the island, and was named for John Jay, a member of the Federalist Party, New York governor, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Secretary of State, and one of the founding fathers of the United States. It was built in 1794 to defend Upper New York Bay, but has served other purposes. From 1806 to 1904 it was named Fort Columbus, presumably for explorer Christopher Columbus. Today, the National Park Service administers Fort Jay and Castle Williams as the Governors Island National Monument. American Revolution Fort Jay is situated on Governors Island (which was known as Nutten Island from 1664 to 1784, based on Dutch Noten Eylandt for \\"Nut Island\\"). Specifically, the fort is located on the site of earthworks originally built to defend New York City during the American Revolution. General Israel Putnam constructed the first earthen fortification on this site starting in April 1776, and armed it with eight cannons for the defense of New York Harbor. Additional guns were later emplaced, and on July 12, 1776 the Nutten Island batteries engaged and . The American cannons inflicted enough damage to make the British commanders cautious of entering the East River, which later contributed to the success of General George Washington's August 29‚Äì30 retreat from Brooklyn into Manhattan after the defeat in the Battle of Brooklyn. The Americans abandoned the earthworks that September, resulting in the eventual British occupation of New York City. The British Army improved the existing earthworks and used the island as a British Royal Navy hospital until they departed on November 25, 1783. At that time Governors Island was conveyed to the State of New York. Federal period In the years following the end of British occupation of New York in 1783, the works deteriorated. A decade later in 1794, the State of New York began to finance improvements to the earthworks, then in ruins. The fort was reconstructed as a square with four corner bastions, and was named after the Federalist New York governor John Jay. By 1797 Congress appropriated $30,117 for continued construction. Eventually, to allow for continued federal funding and upkeep of the works, the state conveyed Governors Island and the works at Fort Jay to the federal government in February 1800 for one dollar. In 1806 the earthworks were replaced by granite and brick walls and the footprint of the fort enlarged to designs by Major Jonathan Williams, chief engineer for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, superintendent of the United States Military Academy, and supervisor of fortifications in New York Harbor. The fort was rebuilt and enlarged as part of what became known as the Second System of US seacoast fortifications. Williams replaced the earthworks with sandstone and granite walls and an arrow-shaped ravelin, all surrounded by a dry moat. The moat was in turn surrounded by a sloped grassy area or glacis that was once was cleared of trees, providing a clear field of fire toward any advancing enemy forces. The slope was also designed to retard or stop cannon shot from warships. The overall result is still evident in the fort's star-shaped design and its position on the highest point on the island. Construction of the walls and gate of the existing fort were completed in 1808. Later, small wood and brick barracks buildings were constructed in the enclosed square space. The fortification was initially named Fort Jay for John Jay, a member of the Federalist Party, New York governor, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Secretary of State and one of the \\"founding fathers\\" of the United States. Jay, as George Washington's Secretary of State, negotiated the Jay Treaty of 1794 with Great Britain. With the election of Thomas Jefferson as President in 1800 there was a shift of power from the Federalists, of which Jay was a prominent member, to the Democratic-Republican Party. Jefferson's party objected to the treaty, which resolved outstanding issues from the American Revolution. Following the 1806 rebuilding, and with the change in presidential administrations and the recent transfer to the federal government, the fort was renamed Fort Columbus, presumably for Christopher Columbus. The post was renamed at some time between December 15, 1806 and July 21, 1807. Edmund Banks Smith, an Episcopal priest, Army chaplain, and author of an early history of Governors Island wrote in 1913 that this was \\"supposed to have been due to Jay‚Äôs temporary unpopularity with the Republican party, which was not satisfied with the Jay Treaty with England\\". However, this has not been substantiated, and no documentation for the name change has been found. The fort retained the name \\"Columbus\\" throughout the rest of the 19th century, finally reverting to Fort Jay in 1904. Fort Columbus played an important role in the military life of New York City as the largest army post defending the city. The fortification, in concert with Fort Wood on Liberty Island, Fort Gibson on Ellis Island, Castle Clinton at the Battery in Lower Manhattan, and two other fortifications on Governors Island, South Battery and Castle Williams, provided protection for the city and Upper New York Bay. This system of coastal fortifications is credited with discouraging the British from taking any naval action against the city during the War of 1812, who preferred easier targets in the Great Lakes, the Chesapeake Bay (resulting in the burning of Washington, DC), and the Gulf of Mexico below New Orleans. 19th century and the Civil War In subsequent years, beginning in the 1820s, Fort Richmond, Fort Hamilton, and Fort Lafayette at the Narrows of New York Harbor reduced the need for the Upper Harbor forts, and in time, the Army transferred most properties in Upper New York Bay to other federal agencies or sold them to the state of New York. Fort Columbus, however, possessed , a sufficient land mass for a modest garrison at a reasonable proximity () to Manhattan, making it the most practical of the Second System forts for the Army to retain and continue to garrison. Personnel stationed at Fort Columbus began to record meteorological observations in the 1820s. As the closest major army post to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, Fort Columbus for many years served as a first posting or a major departure point for newly graduated cadets shipping to army posts along the Atlantic or Pacific coasts. Many future generals in the Civil War were posted to or passed through Fort Columbus as young junior officers. They included John G. Barnard, Horace Brooks, Abner Doubleday, Ulysses S. Grant, Robert E. Lee, Joseph E. Johnston, John Bell Hood, Theophilus H. Holmes, Thomas Jackson, Henry Wager Halleck, James B. McPherson and others. Aerial view of the fortifications. In the 1830s, the protective value of Fort Columbus diminished with the advance of weapons technology, but other uses evolved for the army post. The Army renovated the fortification beginning in 1833 with the construction of four barracks that remain to the present day, replacing wooden barracks. The barracks were built as the fortification's importance in protecting New York was diminished by the construction of the new forts at The Narrows of New York Harbor. The Greek Revival style barracks, unified by two-story Tuscan porticos first served as officers' and enlisted men's housing for the permanent garrison. That same year the Ordnance Department established the New York Arsenal as a separate installation, adjacent to but not part of Fort Columbus, as a major depot taking delivery of contracted manufactured arms and weapons and distributing both contract and federally manufactured weapons to army posts across the nation. In 1836, the South Battery became the Army School of Music Practice, training young boys to become company drummers and fife players and regimental musicians. The army located its General Recruiting Service for infantry troops at Fort Columbus in November 1852, and many regiments in the army detailed officers to Fort Columbus on recruiting details. Twice, in December 1860 and April 1861, the Army \\"secretly\\" dispatched troops and provisions from Fort Columbus to relieve the besieged garrison at Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina. Outgoing President James Buchanan initiated the first effort, but a battery garrisoned by cadets from The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina fired on the Army- chartered New York-based steamship Star of the West on January 9, 1861 as it entered Charleston Harbor. The incident provoked a crisis, prompting other southern states began to more seriously consider secession from the Union. The second effort, with new Army recruits departing from Fort Columbus on April 9, 1861, also failed when it prompted South Carolina forces to fire on Fort Sumter early in the morning of April 12, 1861, resulting in the start of the Civil War. In the early years of the Civil War, the north barracks were used to hold Confederate officers taken as prisoners of war pending transfer to other Union prisons such as Camp Johnson in Ohio, Fort Delaware or Fort Warren in Boston Harbor. Fort Columbus and Castle Williams also served as a temporary prisoner of war camp and confinement hospital for Confederate prisoners during the war. Major General William H. C. Whiting (CSA) died of dysentery in February 1865 in the post hospital shortly after his surrender at the Battle of Fort Fisher, North Carolina. He was the highest ranking Confederate officer to die as a prisoner of war. 10-inch Rodman guns Late in war and the immediate years after it, the armament of the fort was upgraded with nearly fifty and Rodman guns. As the result of a World War II scrap drive, four 10-inch and one 15-inch guns were retained at the fort's east entrance gate and north ravelin as ornaments, while the remainder were shipped on barges to steel mills in Pittsburgh, PA and scrapped for the war effort in October 1942. Division and departmental headquarters In the years after the American Civil War, New York Arsenal served as a major center for disposing of surplus and excess cannons and munitions for war memorials in national cemeteries and for municipalities, scrap, or sale to foreign governments. In 1878, as part of a servicewide cost-cutting effort, the United States Army relocated many of its administrative functions from rented quarters in large urban centers to neighboring army posts. In New York City, nearly all army functions in the city were relocated to Governors Island, making Fort Columbus the headquarters for the Division of the Atlantic and later the Department of the East. Both commands then included almost all army activities east of the Mississippi River. The prestige of a command at Fort Columbus as a premier posting ranked second only to high-ranking army positions in Washington, D.C. and many commanders went on to become Commanding General of the United States Army. Its departmental commanders from the 1880s to the 1900s included Winfield Scott Hancock, Wesley Merritt, Oliver O. Howard, Nelson Miles, Arthur MacArthur, and other combat commanders in the Civil War, the Indian Wars, and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. 20th century Looking north across Fort Jay with Lower Manhattan skyscrapers in the background. At the turn of the century, Fort Columbus and Governors Island began to draw the attention of President Theodore Roosevelt's Secretary of War, Elihu Root, a former New York City lawyer. Root sought to enhance the island army post to better serve the army's needs, to fend off efforts by the City of New York to close the post and reclaim the island as a city park and a rarely stated need to provide a quick means of federal protection of Wall Street, the Customs House and Sub-Treasury in Lower Manhattan. Root instigated the expansion of the island from its original 60 acres to 172 acres with landfill from the newly constructed New York City Subway and dredge from New York Harbor. Root also commissioned the New York architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White to develop a master plan for the island which would demolish all the existing buildings on the island except for the three original fortifications on the island and a newly constructed chapel. The retention of the fortifications indicated Root's interest in retaining the historical structures, as some of the army decision makers he supervised were trying to accomplish their demolition. In one of his departing acts as Secretary of War in February 1904, Root restored the original name of Fort Jay to the fortification and to the army post that had evolved around it. A 1930s WPA project was the complete conversion of the barracks in Fort Jay to family housing. Each company barracks was transformed into four townhouse-style apartments that served junior officers as family housing. As a further concession to the automobile, eight two-car garages were constructed inside the fort behind the barracks to serve the fort's residents. During World War II Fort Jay was the headquarters of First Army in the early part of the war, and later the Eastern Defense Command (EDC), responsible for all Army units and defense coordination in the northeastern United States, and in the east coast states from Maine through Florida. These were primarily coast defense, antiaircraft, and fighter assets. US Army forces in Newfoundland and, from April 1942, Bermuda were also included in the EDC.Conn, pp. 29, 33-39 End of military career In November 1964 after a year of study to identify ways to downsize Department of Defense installations, the U.S. Army announced the closure of Fort Jay. The merging of Second Army duties and functions with that of First Army and relocating First Army's headquarters to Fort Meade, Maryland. In 1966 the United States Coast Guard (USCG) assumed control of Governors Island and continued to use Fort Jay to house officers until it closed its Governors Island base in September 1996. On January 19, 2001, Fort Jay, Castle Williams and a surrounding 23 acres were proclaimed part of the Governors Island National Monument, administered by the National Park Service with Fort Jay recognized as being one of the finest remaining examples of the Second System of American military fortifications. Since 2003, both fortifications have been open to the public on a summer seasonal basis as they undergo stabilization and the remainder of the island undergoes redevelopment by the City of New York through the Trust for Governors Island.

It is located in Shing Mun, the area between Tsuen Wan and Sha Tin, in the New Territories. History Several hundreds years ago, the area around the reservoir was a dense forest with very few inhabitants. At least from 1646 to 1659, Southern Ming loyalist Li Wanrong (ÊùéËê¨Ê¶Æ), leading a cohort numbering in thousands, controlled Kowloon and much of today's New Territories, collecting taxes and fortifying villages, including erecting a fortress in the lower part of the Shing Mun River valley. Hence the area became known as Shing Mun or \\"fortified gate\\". After 1669, when the Great Clearance imposed by the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty was rescinded, many Hakkas settled in this area, growing rice, tea and pineapples. In the early 20th century, there were seven villages in the area. The Shing Mun Reservoir was built as part of the Shing Mun Water Supply Scheme formulated in 1923 to meet the increasing demand for fresh water due to the urbanisation of Kowloon. To a design by London dam engineers Messrs Binnie, Deacon & Gourley, construction began in 1933 of a dam 122 metres wide and 35 metres high which, upon completion, had a capacity of 4 billion litres. By the conclusion of Phase Three of the scheme in 1937, the dam had been extended to 85 metres in height and 13.6 billion litres capacity. The name Jubilee Reservoir () was designated to celebrate the Silver Jubilee (1935) of King George V of the United Kingdom, though the name has fallen into disuse. The local inhabitants were resettled in other parts of the New Territories, and now some of the old villages are submerged. The remains of other villages and houses can be seen in the woods on the side of the reservoir. The remains of Gin Drinkers Line on the nearby hills show the defences of British forces against the Japanese invasion during World War II. It is possible to see many troops of macaque monkeys around the picnic sites and in the woodland areas. To preserve the natural environment of the reservoir, its surrounding area is managed under Shing Mun Country Park. Two walking trails, Wilson Trail and MacLehose Trail, cross at the side of the reservoir. Monument declaration Memorial Stone of Shing Mun Reservoir A total of 41 pre-World War II waterworks structures located in six reservoir areas, namely Pok Fu Lam Reservoir, Tai Tam Group of Reservoirs, Wong Nai Chung Reservoir, Kowloon Reservoir, Shing Mun (Jubilee) Reservoir and Aberdeen Reservoir, were declared as monuments in September 2009. The Memorial Stone of Shing Mun Reservoir was declared as one of the monuments.

It affects the economically important crop species barley, oats, wheat, maize, triticale and rice. Biology Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) is a positive sense single-stranded RNA virus; the viron is not enveloped in a lipid coating.International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses. 2002. Barley yellow dwarf virus The virus is transmitted by aphids, and the taxonomy of the virus is based on genome organisation, serotype differences Ali, M, Tahir, M, Hameed, S, Ashraf, M 2013. Coat protein based molecular characterization of Barley yellow dwarf virus isolates identified on oats in Pakistan.Acta Virologica 57(3):383-385 and on the primary aphid vector of each isolate. The isolates and their major vectors (in parentheses) are:Miller, W.A. and Rasochova, L. 1997. Barley yellow dwarf viruses. Annual Review of Phytopathology 35:167-190 * Subgroup I ** MAV, a less severe strain carried by aphids (grain aphid, Sitobion avenae), ** SGV (Schizaphis graminum), and ** PAV, a less severe strain carried by aphids (bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, grain aphid, S. avenae, and others including rose-grain aphid, Metopolophium dirhodum). * Subgroup II, called cereal yellow dwarf virus, however CYDV is now recognised as a separate species belonging to the genus Polerovirus of the family Luteoviridae ** RPV, the most severe strain carried by aphids (Bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi), ** RMV (Rhopalosiphum maidis) Pathology Wheat plants dwarfed after infection with BYDV. When aphids feed on the phloem of the leaf, the virus is transmitted to the phloem cells. Once inside the plant, the virus begins to replicate and assemble new virions. This process requires significant metabolic input from the plant, and causes the symptoms of barley yellow dwarf disease. The symptoms of barley yellow dwarf vary with the affected crop cultivar, the age of the plant at the time of infection, the strain of the virus, and environmental conditions, and can be confused with other disease or physiological disorders. Symptoms appear approximately 14 days after infection. Affected plants show a yellowing or reddening of leaves (on oats and some wheats), stunting, an upright posture of thickened stiff leaves, reduced root growth, delayed (or no) heading, and a reduction in yield. The heads of affected plants tend to remain erect and become black and discoloured during ripening due to colonization by saprotrophic fungi. Young plants are the most susceptible. Infected wheat leaves have a reduced ability to photosynthesise. The virus is transmitted from the phloem when the aphid feeds. When the aphid feeds, virions go to the aphid's hind gut, the coat protein of the virus is recognised by the hindgut epithelium, and the virion is allowed to pass into the insect's hemolymph, where it can remain indefinitely, but the virus cannot reproduce inside the aphid.Gray, S. and Gildow, F.E. 2003. Luteovirus-aphid interactions Annual Review of Phytopathology 41:539-566 The virus is actively transported into the accessory salivary gland to be released into salivary canals and ducts. The virus is then excreted in the aphid saliva during its next feeding. The host range of BYDVs consists of more than 150 species in the Poaceae; a large number of grasses both annual and perennial are alternate hosts to BYVD and can serve as reservoirs of the virus. Sources and spread There are two main sources by which a cereal crop might be infected 1\\\\. By non-migrant wingless aphids already present in the field and which colonise newly-emerging crops. This is known as \\"green-bridge transfer\\". 2\\\\. By winged aphids migrating into crops from elsewhere. These then reproduce and the offspring spread to neighbouring plants. One aphid species in particular, Rhopalosiphum rufiabdominale, known as the rice root aphid, is commonly known to vector the virus to a range of cereal crops. Effect on yield This is variable since it depends on viral strain, time of infection and rate of spread. Most severe losses are from early infections and can be as high as 50%. Control \\"Green bridge\\" sources must be ploughed in as early as possible. Alternatively, a desiccant herbicide should be applied 10 days prior to cultivation. Insecticide sprays may be used at crop emergence. Drilling dates prior to mid-October favors attacks from winged migrant aphids. However, yield penalties may be experienced from late drilling. Insecticide sprays in this instance are therefore aimed at killing the aphids before significant spread can occur.

Originally, Stuart was his second forename, but he and his wife generally prefixed it to their surname, and he was knighted in 1933 under the name Stuart-Jones. Career He attended the British School at Athens and later served as director of the British School at Rome. For Oxford University Press, Stuart Jones edited Thucydides' 'Historiae,' the history of the Peloponnesian War, in two volumes. The first volume was published in 1900, the second in the next year. This work is still in print more than a century later, in the edition revised by Enoch Powell. Stuart Jones began in 1911 the revision of A Greek-English Lexicon, the standard dictionary of ancient Greek, with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie. A preliminary edition was published under the supervision of Stuart Jones and McKenzie in 1925, but the completed revision was published by Oxford University Press in 1940 only after both men's deaths. In a preface to the revision, the Press described Stuart Jones in these terms: :Sir Henry was the ideal Editor; his wide range of knowledge and his exact scholarship, his persistent devotion to his task even in periods of ill health, his tactful assiduity in consulting experts and his skill in co- ordinating their results, gave the work at once its consistency and its elasticity. Stuart Jones began his relationship with Wales when, in 1927, he became a candidate for the principalship of the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth. His tenure in Wales would prove to be an enthusiastic one: during his time there, he learned the Welsh language and served on the committees of a number of Welsh institutions, including the council of St David's College, Lampeter, as well as Trinity College, Carmarthen, and the National Library of Wales. He also served as vice-chancellor of the federal University of Wales in 1929 and 1930. He was also elected (in 1928) to a Welsh Supernumerary Fellowship of Jesus College, Oxford in his capacity as Principal of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. He was on the governing body of Abingdon School from 1920-1922. Death He died on 29 June 1939.

History The work has its origins (as had the composer's Scottish 3rd Symphony and The Hebrides overture) in the tour of Europe which occupied Mendelssohn from 1829 to 1831. Its inspiration is the colour and atmosphere of Italy, where Mendelssohn made sketches but left the work incomplete. Below is a snippet of a letter he wrote to his father: > This is Italy! And now has begun what I have always thought... to be the > supreme joy in life. And I am loving it. Today was so rich that now, in the > evening, I must collect myself a little, and so I am writing to you to thank > you, dear parents, for having given me all this happiness.Mendelssohn to > Abraham Mendelssohn, from Venice, 10 October 1830. In February he wrote from Rome to his sister Fanny, > The Italian symphony is making great progress. It will be the jolliest piece > I have ever done, especially the last movement. I have not found anything > for the slow movement yet, and I think that I will save that for Naples. The Italian Symphony was finished in Berlin on 13 March 1833, in response to an invitation for a symphony from the London (now Royal) Philharmonic Society; he conducted the first performance himself in London on 13 May 1833 at a London Philharmonic Society concert. The symphony's success, and Mendelssohn's popularity, influenced the course of British music for the rest of the century.Programme notes, Susan Halpern The Germania Musical Society of Boston gave the first performance in the United States, on 1 November 1851, with Carl Bergmann conducting. Mendelssohn himself, however, remained dissatisfied with the composition, which cost him, he said, some of the bitterest moments of his career; he revised it in 1834J. Michael Allsen, Programme notes, 2008 and even planned to write alternative versions of the second, third, and fourth movements. He never published the symphony, and it appeared in print only in 1851;In its 1834 revision, and perhaps lightly edited by his friend Ignaz Moscheles (Allsen, Halpern). thus it is numbered as his \\"Symphony No. 4\\", even though it was in fact the third he composed. Structure The symphony is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani and strings. It is in four movements: # Allegro vivace (A major) # Andante con moto (D minor) # Con moto moderato (A major) # Presto and Finale: Saltarello (A minor) The joyful first movement, in sonata form, is followed by an impression in the subdominant minor of D minor of a religious procession the composer witnessed in Naples. The third movement is a minuet in which French horns are introduced in the trio, while the final movement (which is in the minor key throughout) incorporates dance figurations from the Roman saltarello and the Neapolitan tarantella. It is among the first large multi- movement works to begin in a major key and end in the tonic minor, another example being Brahms's first piano trio. A typical performance lasts about half an hour.

It is not to be confused with Lysimachia foemina, which has very similar blue flowers, but broader leaves and can be found also in colder climates. In a comparison of DNA sequences, L. monelli was shown to be most closely related to L. foemina. The latter had been thought by many to be closest to L. arvensis, and some authors had even included L. foemina as a subspecies of L. arvensis. The three species were among several transferred from Anagallis to Lysimachia in a 2009 paper. Lysimachia monelli is a low-growing perennial with trailing stems. Wild specimens have blue or orange coloured flowers and are not sympatric with the blue-flowered plants growing natively in southern Spain and the orange in Morocco and southern Italy. A red variant was also developed by breeding at the University of New Hampshire. The orange-coloured flowers have a higher concentration of pelargonidin pigment, while blue flowers have a higher concentration of malvidin. The red-coloured flowers are due to the relative concentrations of delphinidin and malvidin pigments. In addition to the blue, orange and red forms, a white form of the flower also exists. In cultivation in temperate regions this plant is often grown as an annual. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. See also *Anagallis arvensis, the scarlet pimpernel.

The land operated as a brewery from 1967-1999, and as a high-capacity outdoor concert venue from 1987-2005. As a music venue, Molson Park saw acts like Rage Against the Machine, Aretha Franklin, Radiohead, Pearl Jam, Neil Young, Nofx, and Oasis. From 2002-2004, the abandoned brewery operated as the largest illegal marijuana grow-operation in Canadian history. The current shopping centre includes a Best Buy, LA Fitness, Marshall's, and a Bed, Bath & Beyond. Brewery In 1967, the Formosa Spring Brewery reached its bottling capacity in its Formosa, Ontario location, and began looking to expand. The 597 acre farmland was annexed from Innisfil by the City of Barrie to establish the new brewery, still under the Formosa name. In 1974, Molson's purchased the land and brewery, creating a parkland, baseball diamond, and adding a drive-through beer store for cottagers driving on Highway 400. Due to a change in inter-provincial alcohol production regulations, the Molsons plant was closed and abandoned in September 2000. In late November 1999 in a last-ditch effort to save their jobs, workers staged an occupation of the plant.CBC News, November 22, 1999 - Sit-in at Molson plant in Barrie continues Following an end to the occupation, the lands were thereafter put on the market for sale, subsequently purchased by a commercial land developer and renamed 'Park Place'. Concert venue Barrie in relation to Toronto In 1987, the Toronto-based Edgefest began looking for a new open- air venue to support large acts. After considering Downsview Park, Mosport International Raceway and Cayuga Speedway, as well as a farmer's field in Oakville, the organisers settled on Molson Park, despite its 90 km ([55 mi]) distance from Toronto. In an effort to motivate fans to drive to Barrie, the 1987 Edgefest sold tickets for $1.02. A Live 8 ticket for the Barrie show With an attendance of 25,000 people, the 1987 Edgefest demonstrated Molson Park as a venue for large Toronto-based festivals. Many Toronto-based festivals began to follow suit, from 1987 until its commercial redevelopment in 2005. Notable festivals include: * 102.1 The Edge's Edgefest 1987-2003 * Lollapalooza 1992-1996 * CFNY Canada Day Festival, 1987-1990 * The Great Canadian Party, 1992 * Summersault 1998, 2000 * Vans Warped Tour 2000 - 2007 * Live 8 concert, Barrie July 2, 2005LIVE 8 Concerts ‚Äì Live 8 * Canada Day Concert, July 1, 1993 featured Van Halen Kim Mitchell Vince Neil The concert drew over 50, 0000 people Marijuana grow-op On January 12, 2004, the former Molsons plant was found to be home to an illegal marijuana grow-op housing an estimated 30,000 marijuana plants with an estimated street value of $30 million; at the time, it was the largest marijuana grow-op bust in Canada's history.CBC News Online - March 4, 2005 - INDEPTH: MARIJUANA - Marijuana grow-ops - Barnum was involved in the biggest bust of a marijuana grow-op in Canadian history on Jan. 12, 2004. Police seized 30,000 plants that would have produced marijuana worth $30 million on the streets. The operation was hidden inside a shutdown Molson brewery in Barrie, Ont. Operating in secret for 2 years,Former weed kingpin rolls out guilty plea the operation was undertaken by Robert DeRosa, brother of landowner Vince DeRosa, claiming to run two companies called Ontario Pallet and Barrie Fish.Ten years after one of Canada‚Äôs largest grow-op bust, legal troubles persist In addition to the Molsons plant, there was a building on Highway 11 in Oro-Medonte Township, and a third building in St. Catharines, Ontario. During the undercover operation, Robert also described plans to ship cocaine from Colombia to Canada hidden inside fish. He was later tracked down and arrested in Cuba. Robert was sentenced to seven years in prison, and claimed his brother knew nothing of the marijuana operation. Robert's wife Bernice Laan, and 18-year-old son also faced charges. Charges were dropped against another man, Daniel Moore. Drago Dolic, also involved, was already serving 27 years in prison in Louisiana. 12 employees were also charged during the bust. After sale of the plant, legal proceedings followed concerning Vince's rights to the money from the sale. Prosecutors alleged that a seizure of the property, along with Robert's home in Phelpston, Ontario was justified under organized crime laws. Vince eventually won rights to the $4 million in proceeds from the sale, in 2014.A bizarre grow-op odyssey comes to an end Shopping centre Park Place construction paused during the OMB appeal in 2009. On October 31, 2006 commercial real estate developers North American Acquisition Inc (NAA), a subsidiary of North American Development Group, LLC (NADG) won an Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) appeal of a rezoning application that had been previously denied by the City of Barrie to rezone the Park Place lands from general industrial to business park zones, and general commercial or mixed employment.http://www.parkplacebarrie.com/PDF/OMBD.pdf Ontario Municipal Board Order No.: 3067 The City of Barrie had opposed NAA's rezoning application on the basis that it would use a large portion of the City's scarce industrial lands, yet only contribute low-wage retail jobs to the local economy. In 2002, the Park Place designs described a car-free, pedestrian-focused outdoor commercial centre hosting hotels, an IMAX cinema, and landscaping. After the OMB appeal, development began instead with a box store concept, blamed by developer Terry Coughlin on the 2008 economic downturn:A look at how the initial plan for Park Place in Barrie changed \\"We're not going to get those fashion-type stores we thought originally. A lot aren't doing too well and they‚Äôre working in outlet mode. They‚Äôre all going down to Cookstown. ... We're not going to become a fashion centre, even though it was a good idea in 2002 when we started.\\"North end of Park Place taking shape in Barrie The discrepancy between the plans and the development angered many citizens, including then-mayor Rob Hamilton who described the development as \\"another mall like all the other malls, all asphalt and cars and hard objects.

On October 1, 1984, MDOT cancelled its contract with the Michigan Northern Railway and the TSBY assumed operation as a 405-mile short-line freight railroad with the rest of the Ann Arbor Railroad mainline from Alma to Cadillac, former Grand Rapids and Indiana Railway (GR&I;) trackage from Reed City to Petoskey (crossing in Cadillac, Michigan) and Walton to Traverse City and former Chesapeake and Ohio Railway from Grawn to Williamsburg (through Traverse City). The track from Cadillac to Comstock Park and Chesaning to St. Charles were removed in 1991. On January 22, 1991, the TSBY sold its original lines to the Huron and Eastern Railway, now owned by Genesee & Wyoming. In March 2006, the Tuscola and Saginaw Bay Railway was purchased by Federated Railways, Inc. and has changed their name to Great Lakes Central Railroad as a class II regional railroad. Great Lakes Central Railroad is the largest regional railroad in the state of Michigan covering of track. Current operations Today the GLC operates former Ann Arbor Railroad track from Ann Arbor to Cadillac, former Pennsylvania Railroad track from Cadillac to Petoskey and Walton to Traverse City, former Chesapeake and Ohio Railway track from Grawn to Williamsburg, former New York Central Railroad track from Owosso to Fergus, and former Grand Trunk Western Railroad track from Ashley to Middleton. The GLC also operates a small portion of the abandoned CSX Ludington Subdivision in Clare, to serve a local plastics factory. =Interchanges= GLC interchanges with Class I railroads Canadian National in Durand and CSX at Howell, and shortlines Huron and Eastern Railway in Durand and Owosso, the Mid-Michigan Railroad in Alma and the Ann Arbor Railroad at Osmer.

Amis dedicated the book to friend and background collaborator, the poet and historian Robert Conquest. Later, after Ian Fleming's death, Amis was commissioned as the first continuation novelist for the James Bond novel series, writing Colonel Sun (1968) under the pseudonym Robert Markham. The James Bond Dossier was the first, formal, literary study of the James Bond character. More recent studies of Fleming's secret agent and his world include The Politics of James Bond: From Fleming's Novels to the Big Screen (2001), by the historian Jeremy Black. History Written at the Bond-mania's zenith in the 1960s, The James Bond Dossier is the first, thorough, albeit tongue-in- cheek, literary analysis of Ian Fleming's strengths and weaknesses as a thriller-writer. As a mainstream novelist, Amis respected the Bond novels, especially their commercial success, believing them 'to be just as complex and to have just as much in them as more ambitious kinds of fiction'.Amis, Kingsley The James Bond Dossier. London: Jonathan Cape, 1965, p. 9 That was a controversial approach in the 1960s, because from early on, since the mid-1950s, the James Bond novels were criticised by some detractors for their violence, male chauvinism, sexual promiscuity, racism, and anti-Communism. Despite his intellectual respect for the Fleming canon, Amis's way of writing about it, according to his biographer Zachary Leader, ' ... partly guys academic procedures and pretensions by applying them to low-cultural objects' and, as such, is deliberately provocative.Leader, Zachary The Life of Kingsley Amis. Pantheon Books, 2007, p. 524 In that context, the Dossier can ' ... look like a cheeky two-fingered salute to the academic world, a farewell raspberry blown at all things pedantically donnish, in a manner Lucky Jim would surely have approved. For to Ian Fleming's ≈ìuvre Amis brought the anatomising and categorising zeal he never had devoted and never would devote to more elevated works of literature'.Jacobs, Eric Kingsley Amis: A Biography. St. Martin's Press, 1995, p. 269 From essay to book Kingsley Amis had several motives for writing the Dossier. He had recently retired from teaching and wanted to 'put behind him the more rigid austerities of university life'.Jacobs, Eric Kingsley Amis: A Biography. St. Martin's Press, 1995, p. 267. He wanted to expand his range as a writer beyond poetry and mainstream fiction. The need to make more money was also a consideration. Primarily, however, he wanted to show the academics that the literature of popular culture could be as substantive as the literature of high culture.Jacobs, Eric Kingsley Amis: A Biography. St. Martin's Press, 1995, pp. 267, 270. In November 1963, he announced to Conquest the idea of writing an essay of some 5,000 words about the James Bond novels. By late 1964, he had expanded the essay to book length, and submitted it to his publisher, Jonathan Cape. In one hundred and sixty pages, The James Bond Dossier methodically catalogues and analyses the activities and minutiae of secret agent 007: the number of men he kills, the women he loves, the villains he thwarts, and the essential background of Ian Fleming's Cold War world of the 1950s.Jacobs, Eric Kingsley Amis: A Biography. St. Martin's Press, 1995, p. 269. After Fleming's death in August 1964, Glidrose Productions Ltd., owners of the international book rights, asked for Amis's editorial assessment of the uncompleted manuscript of The Man with the Golden Gun, which Jonathan Cape deemed feeble, and perhaps unpublishable. He reported that the manuscript was publishable, but would require substantial modifications. Because Amis was not the only writer consulted,Leader, Zachary The Life of Kingsley Amis. Pantheon Books, 2007, p. 542 it remains controversial if his editorial suggestions were implemented, and to what extent Amis contributed directly to the revision of the manuscript. In the event, the Dossier's publication was delayed a year, because Jonathan Cape asked Amis to include discussion of The Man With the Golden Gun. Both books were published in 1965; later that year, Amis reviewed The Man With the Golden Gun in the New Statesman.Lycett, Andrew Ian Fleming. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1995, p. 445.Amis, Kingsley What Became of Jane Austen? And Other Questions. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., 1970, pp. 73‚Äì74 The Dossier The James Bond Dossier includes most of the Bond fiction cycle, excepting Octopussy and The Living Daylights (1966), the final collection of 007 short stories, which was published after the Dossier. Kingsley Amis's argument is that the Bond novels are substantial and complex works of fiction, and certainly not, as Ian Fleming's critics said, 'a systematic onslaught on everything decent and sensible in modern life'.Amis, Kingsley The James Bond Dossier Joanathan Cape, 1965, p. 10 He viewed them as popular literature, akin to that of the Science Fiction texts he critiqued in New Maps of Hell (1960).Jacobs, Eric Kingsley Amis: A Biography St. Martin's Press, 1995, p. 270. Although written in Amis's usual accessible, light-hearted style, The James Bond Dossier is neither patronising nor ironic ‚Äî it is a detailed literary criticism of the Ian Fleming canon. In the main, he admires Fleming's achievement, yet does not withhold criticism where the material proves unsatisfactory or inconsistent, especially when the narration slips into 'the idiom of the novelette'.Jacobs, Eric Kingsley Amis: A Biography. St. Martin's Press, 1995, p. 271. Amis reserves his most serious criticism for what he considered to be academically pretentious rejections of the Bond books, a theme implicitly informing much of the Dossier. Each of the 14 chapters deals with one aspect of the novels ‚Äî 'No woman had ever held this man' defends Bond's attitude to and treatment of women: \\"Bond's habitual attitude to a girl is protective, not dominating or combative\\"; 'Damnably clear grey eyes' describes M., the head of SIS: \\"a peevish, priggish old monster\\"; 'A glint of red' is about the villains, who have in common only physical largeness and angry eyes; and so forth. According to his first biographer, Eric Jacobs,Jacobs, Eric Kingsley Amis: A Biography. St. Martin's Press, 1995, p. 270 the hand of sovietologist and scholar Robert Conquest is betrayed in Amis's precise dissertation upon the genesis and changing nomenclatures of SMERSH, the employer of the villains of the early novels. Three appendices deal, respectively, with science fiction, literature and escape, and 'sadism'. With 'almost parodic scholarly dedication',Jacobs, Eric Kingsley Amis: A Biography St. Martin's Press, 1995, p. 269. Amis provides a ten-category ('Places', 'Girl', 'Villain's Project', etc.) reference guide (pp. 156‚Äì159) to the Bond novels and short stories. Typical of Amis's approach is where he suggests several implausibilities in Bond's capture by the eponymous villain in Dr No (1958). However, that 'Bond is temporarily helpless in his creator's grip', does not matter, because 'three of Mr Fleming's favourite situations are about to come up one after the other. Bond is to be wined and dined, lectured on the aesthetics of power, and finally tortured by his chief enemy'.Amis, Kingsley, The James Bond Dossier Jonathan Cape, 1965, p.21 Earlier, Amis had discussed the matter of Bond's correct designation: 'It's inaccurate, of course, to describe James Bond as a spy, in the strict sense of one who steals or buys or smuggles the secrets of foreign powers ... Bond's claims to be considered a counter-spy, one who operates against the agents of unfriendly powers, are rather more substantial'.Amis, Kingsley, The James Bond Dossier Jonathan Cape, 1965, p. 11 Although, as noted elsewhere, Amis wrote three books related to the James Bond franchise, and may or may not have contributed to one of Fleming's novels, The James Bond Dossier would end up being the only book of this type to be published under Amis's own name. Critical endeavours In the 1968 essay 'A New James Bond', anthologised in What Became of Jane Austen? And Other Questions (1970), Kingsley Amis revisits the literary character, and explains why he accepted the commission of writing Colonel Sun (1968), discusses the challenge of impersonating the writer Ian Fleming, and explores the stylistic and world-view differences among the spy novels of Ian Fleming, John le Carr√©, and Len Deighton.Amis, Kingsley What Became of Jane Austen? And Other Questions. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., 1970; pp. 65‚Äì77 Moreover, under the pseudonym 'Lt.-Col. William \\"Bill\\" Tanner' ‚Äî M.'s CoS and 007's best friend in SIS ‚Äî Amis wrote his second Bond book, The Book of Bond, or Every Man His Own 007 (1965), a tongue-in-cheek, how-to-manual to help every man find his own inner secret agent.

The compound is one of the four key ancient temples that creates the Karnak Temple Complex. It is approximately 325 meters (1,066 feet) south of the precinct of the god Amun. The precinct itself encompasses approximately 90,000 square meters (968,751 square feet) of the entire area. The Mut Precinct contains at least six temples: the Mut Temple, the Contra Temple, and Temples A, B, C, and D (Fazzini, 1983, p. 18). Surrounding the Mut Temple proper, on three sides, is a sacred lake called the Isheru. To the south of the sacred lake is a vast amount of land currently being excavated by Dr. Betsy Bryan and her team from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Today, most of the compound is still destroyed, but it is currently being renovated. Surrounding the Mut Temple, the Contra Temple, and Temples A, B, C, and D, is an enclosure wall made of mud brick dating to the 30th Dynasty. The Mut Temple proper was made of mediocre sandstone and it is positioned north and south and is directly aligned with the Precinct of Amun. The Contra Temple, also made of mediocre sandstone, borders the Mut Temple at the south end of it, hence the name, and it possibly dates to the 30th Dynasty with certain alternations made during the Ptolemaic period. The purpose of the Contra Temple is still unclear, however, Fazzini (1983) states that it possibly served as a stopping point in a partially columned passage around the Mut Temple. In the northeast corner is the structure known as Temple A and according to Brooklyn Museum‚Äôs exhibition on the Precinct of Mut, it was also called the \\"Temple of Millions of Years\\" and was dedicated to Ramsses II and the god Amun-Ra. Within the temple are two stelae, one referring to Ramsses II‚Äôs work on Temple A and the other telling of his marriage to Hittite princess. The Brooklyn Museum states that Temple A did not become a part of the Mut Precinct until the 25th Dynasty under the reign of the Kushite king, Taharqa and during which time it became a birthing house, \\"mammisi\\", where Ancient Egyptians would celebrate the birth of the god Khonsu, the son of Amun-Ra and Mut. To the east of the Mut Temple is a ruined building referred to as, Temple B, due to the amount of damage of Temple B, excavations are difficult to undergo. To the west of the sacred lake, Isheru, lies Temple C, a small temple built by Ramsses III, it still retains some military scenes on the outer walls, as well as two headless giants of the king himself before the entrance of the temple (Wilkinson, 2000, p. 164). Temple D, or Structure D, was a chapel made during the Ptolemaic period, the front room was dedicated to the goddess Mut and the back room shows evidence of being dedicated to a Ptolemaic ancestor cult. The Brooklyn Museum mentions one other important monument found on the site is the Taharqa gateway that is about 7 yards wide and is oriented south and west, it was built to enlarge the Mut Precinct and opened a new pathway to Temple A. The sacred lake, Isheru, was man made and held religious importance to the cult of the goddess Mut. The goddess Mut The goddess Mut is the wife and consort of the god Amun-Ra. She was also known as the Mother Goddess, Queen of the Goddesses, and Lady of Heaven (Fazzini, 1983, p. 16). Mut was the Egyptian sky goddess and her symbols were the vulture, lioness and the crown of Uraeus (rearing cobra). She was the mother of Khonsu, the god of the moon. Amun-Ra, Mut, and Khonsu made up the Theban Triad (Fazzini, 1983, p. 16). Who built the Mut Precinct? Amenhotep III was originally thought to have been the first to build the Mut Temple, but now evidence tells us he contributed later to the site. The earliest dated cartouches are of Thutmose II and III of the 18th Dynasty (some evidence suggest that Thutmose‚Äôs name is likely a replacement for Hatshepsut‚Äôs erased name) (Waraksa, 2009, p. 4). According to Elizabeth Waraksa (2009), during the 19th Dynasty, Ramsses II worked broadly on Temple A, he placed two massive statues of himself and two alabaster stelae in the front of the temple‚Äôs first pylon. During the 20th Dynasty, Ramsses III built Temple C, it was used until the 25th Dynasty when it then became a quarry for renovations for Temple A. During his reign, Kushite ruler Taharqa in the 25th Dynasty made major changes to the Mut Precinct. He built a new sandstone gateway in the northwest of the site that leads to Temple A. He also renovated parts of the Mut Temple proper, erecting a columned porch facing the south. Ptolemy VI during the Ptolemaic period erected a small chapel inside the Mut Temple proper. Several stelae found on the site, mention construction on the site by Roman emperors Augustus and Tiberius from the 1st century BC to the 1st century AD. Excavations Many travelers, like Napoleon and Sir John Gardiner Wilkinson visited the Precinct of Mut between AD 1799 and 1845 (Fazzini, 1983, p. 18). The photographs, journals and maps that dated to the early excavations have added an exceptional insight as to how the Mut Precinct could have looked at the time of each exploration (Waraksa, 2009, p. 6). However, the first major excavation of the site did not occur until 1895, when Britons Margaret Benson and Janet Gourlay excavated the Precinct of Mut for three seasons (1895‚Äì7). During her excavations Benson cleared the First and Second courts, as well as the Contra Temple and uncovered many top condition pieces of statues (Waraksa, 2009, p. 7). In 1899, she publicized her work, The Temple of Mut in Asher. Excavations were not continued until the 1920s, when Maurice Pillet resumed excavating the Mut Precinct. During his excavations he restored Temples A and C. Later in 1976, Richard A. Fazzini and the Brooklyn Museum of Art, with assistance from the Detroit Institute of Arts, did an efficient investigation of the entire Mut Precinct up until 2001. Starting in January 2001, Dr. Betsy M. Bryan, in association with Johns Hopkins University, began working on the site until 2004. In the winter of 2015, Dr. Bryan went to work on excavating the site again. Statues of Sekhmet The site is most famous for the statues of the lion-headed goddess Sekhmet (Lythgoe, 1919, p. 3). The statues are made of diorite or \\"black granite\\" and initially approximately 570 granodiorite statues were thought to have been at the Precinct of Mut at one time. According to Lythgoe (1919), Amenhotep III, commissioned the many statues to be built as a \\"forest\\". Amenhotep III described Sekhmet as the terrible, mighty goddess of war and strife and her origins came from the earlier Memphite triad as the mother-goddess, and she eventually became recognized with the local Theban deity, Mut (Lythgoe, 1919, p. 3). According to Porter and Moss (1960), most of the statues came from the actual site, but some possibly came from the Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III on the west bank of the Nile. Today the statues can be found in various museums across the globe; in Boston, the Museum of Fine Arts has one seated statue, the Egyptian Museum, Cairo has six statues, and in London, the British Museum has thirty statues, just to name a few examples. Ceramic figurines Between 2001 and 2004, the Johns Hopkins expedition catalogued quite a number of female figurines found in the industrial areas south of the Sacred Lake. According to Waraksa (2009) after the four seasons of excavation, the total number of female figurines the expedition found was 42. There are six types of female figurines that can be found at the Mut Temple. Type 1 are handmade figures of nude females made out of marl clay. Type 2 depict women laying on beds and they can be made in fired clay or limestone. Type 3 figurines are molded from Nile silt or marl clay with flat backs, heavy hairstyles and high foreheads (Waraksa, 2009, p. 31). The backs of the Type 3 figurines could smoothed by hand or a flat instrument of some kind. Type 4 are made from Nile silt as well and are greatest identified by their pinched heads, projecting arms facing outwards, one existing breast and wide hips. Type 5 figurines are similar to Type 3 in some ways, but they have flat, thin bodies with a smooth finish unlike Type 3 that have thicker and a somewhat rougher appearance. And Type 6, all the figurines found of this type are the lower bodies of females, these figurines appear to be the smallest-sized found at the Mut Precinct and seem to be handmade from Nile silt with a focus on having a large pubic triangle. The significance of these 42 figurines at the Mut Precinct is still questioned, however, Waraksa (2009) suggests that possible functions of the figurines could be connected to childbearing, as well as health related rituals. Recent discoveries For the last 15 years, Dr. Bryan has led the excavation behind the Sacred Lake. Between 2002 and 2004, the excavation of the Mut Precinct, conducted by Dr. Bryan and her team, revealed a section of New Kingdom work fixings that included baking and brewing centers, as well as granaries. In January 2006, the expedition after clearing some debris found a life-sized statue of Queen Tiy, the wife of Amenhotep III, made of granite and that dates back to the 21st Dynasty (Bryan, 2008, p. 31). Dr. Bryan and her team discovered human remains south of the Sacred Lake in 2011, what was interesting about the remains is the orientation of the body, it was faced down and appeared to be constrained, even more interesting is the location of the skull, it seems as if it was purposely placed underneath a sandstone base for a wooden column (\\"Hopkins in Egypt Today\\"). In 2012, The Johns Hopkins University expedition, directed by Bryan, found burials behind the Sacred Isheru Lake. Now in January 2015, the main goal of the JHU expedition is to excavate what is now considered a cemetery behind the sacred lake. References Bryan, B. M.

Fictional character biography Grayven is the third son of Darkseid, born of an unknown mother and apparently without his father's knowledge, younger brother to Kalibak and Orion. Grayven leads a campaign of destruction against the cosmos, destroying planets. He leads a campaign against the Darkstars, a galactic police force, killing many of their number.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #74 (June 1996) His campaign comes to an end on the planet Rann. He desires a zeta beam device, a product of Rannian science that provides instantaneous transportation on a grand scale. He intends to zeta beam his forces onto Apokolips, announce his presence to his father, and conquer the planet. While the remaining Darkstars engaged Grayven's army, Green Lantern Kyle Rayner faces off against the man himself. Assisted by former Green Lantern and current Darkstar John Stewart, who suffers serious injuries in the fight, Kyle tricks Grayven into a Zeta Beam device, where he is teleported off Rann. Lacking their leader, Grayven's forces retreated. Unknown to Stewart, Rayner had inadvertently teleported Grayven deep within Earth's core. He eventually digs himself out, and seeks Rayner in New York City, who is seemingly able to overpower Grayven. Fearing defeat at the Green Lantern's hands, Grayven used an experimental teleporter, freeing himself, and in the process, sending Rayner into the 30th century. =Imperiex= Grayven next appeared during the Imperiex crisis, as part of an alien alliance that also included Maxima, Starfire, Adam Strange, and Darkseid. They sought to eliminate Imperiex, a cosmic giant who destroys whole solar systems. In Adventures of Superman #595 (Oct 2001), Grayven is under the influence of Brainiac-13, a major force in the Imperiex War. He confronts Superman and Darkseid on the surface of Apokolips. He is defeated by Superman, then punished by Darkseid, who feels it is his duty to do so because Grayven has 'shamed himself'. Soon, Grayven is banished to Earth. =Last Laugh and Ion= During his banishment to Earth, Grayven is infected with a variant of Joker toxin that causes insanity. He attempts to perform at, and then destroy, a comedy club. Kyle Rayner again stops him. Grayven later reappeared in Ion: Guardian of the Universe.Ion - Guardian of the Universe #11 (April 2007) There he is revealed to have sent Nero and Effigy after Kyle Rayner. Grayven also is implied to be part of some larger conspiracy, most likely that of the Sinestro Corps due to his hunting of escaped Qwardians and knowledge of Kyle's sick mother. Rayner blasts Grayven into unconsciousness.Ion - Guardian of the Universe #12 (May 2007) =Death of the New Gods= Grayven has since appeared in Five of a Kind: Thunder/Martian Manhunter, lobotomized and nearly catatonic. Thunder and Martian Manhunter restore his mind and assist him in building a zeta beam generator meant to send the unknown scourge of the New Gods (as seen in Countdown) to Darkseid's throne room. This would force Darkseid and the killer to fight, with the result benefitting Grayven either way. Thunder and J'onn trick Grayven, however; J'onn shapeshifts into the Black Racer, the New Gods' incarnation of Death, which prompts Grayven to use the zeta beam on himself to escape. Moments later at his destination, he is found and murdered by the real killer (later revealed to be Infinity-Man). Powers and abilities Grayven possesses formidable super-strength and endurance. Additionally, as a New God, he cannot die from natural causes. His greatest power is a limited form of the Omega Effect used by his father Darkseid. His power levels are high enough to easily fight the Green Lantern Kyle Rayner and the Darkstars, yet not enough to take on Superman, who easily defeated him with a single blow. In other media =Animation= * Grayven makes his animated debut in Young Justice: Outsiders, appearing in a flashback.

Andy Lees, Microsoft's senior vice president of mobile communications business, said that Internet Explorer Mobile 6 was going to be a full version of Internet Explorer 6 on Windows Mobile. It was shown running briefly during Microsoft's 2009 CES Keynote on a Palm Treo Pro, and again in an official video for Toshiba's TG01 phone, which has a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor. Internet Explorer Mobile 6 was released as part of Windows Mobile 6.1.4, and some OEMs also installed it on Windows Mobile 6.1.4 Standard devices.for example, the HTC S710 shipped with a browser that identified itself as \\"IEMobile 6.12\\" in the User-Agent header New features include enhanced Javascript and AJAX support (Jscript v5.7 from Internet Explorer 8) and support for Adobe Flash Lite 3.1. The browser also has a redesigned finger friendly Graphical user interface. Overall rendering quality and speed are also improved with this version; however according to Gizmodo and Engadget it didn't render pages as well as Opera Mobile and browsers based on Webkit. Version 7 On February 15, 2010 Microsoft unveiled its next-generation mobile operating system, Windows Phone. With it, came a new version of the Internet Explorer Mobile browser. New features for the browser included multi- touch gesture support, tabbed browsing, a new UI, smooth zoom in/out animations, and a hybrid rendering engine of the Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 desktop versions.

With the help of shared core between IE10 Desktop and IE10 Mobile, Internet Explorer 10 Mobile supports a broader range of the HTML5 capabilities (including pointer events) and boosts applications/websites' performance. When it finally came out IE10 Mobile out-performed the Galaxy S III, HTC One S, and iPhone 4S on iOS 6 Beta in the SunSpider benchmark. Version 11 On July 15, 2014, Microsoft released Windows Phone 8.1, which includes the new Internet Explorer Mobile 11 browser. This version gets even closer to the desktop counterpart, by carrying over many of its improvements. New features include: * support for WebGL; * normal mapping; * InPrivate Browsing mode; * Reading mode; * the possibility to swipe left or right to navigate to the previous or next webpage; * file upload; * a new HTML5 video web player with support for inline playback and closed captions; * Windows 8-style website live tiles; * the ability to save passwords; * the ability to open an unlimited number of tabs (previously the user could open up to six tabs). Furthermore, the button to refresh the page is now placed on the address bar, and the open tabs can be displayed on other Microsoft devices besides the smartphone in use: if a user is logged in with his Microsoft account on both his Windows 8.1 device and Windows Phone device, tabs on Internet Explorer 11 will synchronize automatically. Version 11 Update Microsoft made several changes to Internet Explorer Mobile to make the browser more compatible with sites designed for mobile Safari (iOS) and Chrome (Android). To accomplish this, Microsoft adopted features used in Safari and Chrome, emulates legacy WebKit features, and claims to web servers that it is iOS or Android compatible.

Coastal geography is the study of the constantly changing region between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the physical geography (i.e. coastal geomorphology, geology and oceanography) and the human geography (sociology and history) of the coast. It includes understanding coastal weathering processes, particularly wave action, sediment movement and weather, and the ways in which humans interact with the coast Wave action and longshore drift Port Campbell in southern Australia is a high-energy shoreline. The waves of different strengths that constantly hit against the shoreline are the primary movers and shapers of the coastline. Despite the simplicity of this process, the differences between waves and the rocks they hit result in hugely varying shapes. The effect that waves have depends on their strength. Strong waves, also called destructive waves, occur on high- energy beaches and are typical of winter. They reduce the quantity of sediment present on the beach by carrying it out to bars under the sea. Constructive, weak waves are typical of low-energy beaches and occur most during summer. They do the opposite to destructive waves and increase the size of the beach by piling sediment up onto the berm. One of the most important transport mechanisms results from wave refraction. Since waves rarely break onto a shore at right angles, the upward movement of water onto the beach (swash) occurs at an oblique angle. However, the return of water (backwash) is at right angles to the beach, resulting in the net movement of beach material laterally. This movement is known as beach drift (Figure 3). The endless cycle of swash and backwash and resulting beach drift can be observed on all beaches. This may differ between coasts. Rhossili in Wales is a low-energy shoreline. Probably the most important effect is longshore drift (LSD)(Also known as Littoral Drift), the process by which sediment is continuously moved along beaches by wave action. LSD occurs because waves hit the shore at an angle, pick up sediment (sand) on the shore and carry it down the beach at an angle (this is called swash). Due to gravity, the water then falls back perpendicular to the beach, dropping its sediment as it loses energy (this is called backwash). The sediment is then picked up by the next wave and pushed slightly further down the beach, resulting in a continual movement of sediment in one direction. This is the reason why long strips of coast are covered in sediment, not just the areas around river mouths, which are the main sources of beach sediment. LSD is reliant on a constant supply of sediment from rivers and if sediment supply is stopped or sediment falls into a submarine canals at any point along a beach, this can lead to bare beaches further along the shore. LSD helps create many landforms including barrier islands, bay beaches and spits. In general LSD action serves to straighten the coast because the creation of barriers cuts off bays from the sea while sediment usually builds up in bays because the waves there are weaker (due to wave refraction), while sediment is carried away from the exposed headlands. The lack of sediment on headlands removes the protection of waves from them and makes them more vulnerable to weathering while the gathering of sediment in bays (where longshore drift is unable to remove it) protects the bays from further erosion and makes them pleasant recreational beaches. Atmospheric processes * Onshore winds blowing \\"up\\" the beach, pick up sand and move it up the beach to form sand dunes. * Rain hits the shore and erodes rocks, and carries weathered material to the shoreline to form beaches. * Warm weather can encourage biological processes to occur more rapidly. In tropical areas some plants and animals protect stones from weathering, while other plants and animals actually eat away at the rocks. * Temperatures that vary from below to above freezing point result in frost weathering, whereas weather more than a few degrees below freezing point creates sea ice. Biological processes In tropical regions in particular, plants and animals not only affect the weathering of rocks but are a source of sediment themselves. The shells and skeletons of many organisms are of calcium carbonate and when this is broken down it forms sediment, limestone and clay. Physical processes The main physical Weathering process on beaches is salt-crystal growth. Wind carries salt spray onto rocks, where it is absorbed into small pores and cracks within the rocks. There the water evaporates and the salt crystallises, creating pressure and often breaking down the rock. In some beaches calcium carbonate is able to bind together other sediments to form beachrock and in warmer areas dunerock. Wind erosion is also a form of erosion, dust and sand is carried around in the air and slowly erodes rock, this happens in a similar way in the sea were the salt and sand is washed up onto the rocks. Sea level changes (eustatic change) The sea level on earth regularly rises and falls due to climatic changes. During cold periods more of the Earth's water is stored as ice in glaciers while during warm periods it is released and sea levels rise to cover more land. Sea levels are currently quite high, while just 18,000 years ago during the Pleistocene ice age they were quite low. Global warming may result in further rises in the future, which presents a risk to coastal cities as most would be flooded by only small rises. As sea levels rise, fjords and rias form. Fjords are flooded glacial valleys and rias are flooded river valleys. Fjords typically have steep rocky sides, while rias have dendritic drainage patterns typical of drainage zones. As tectonic plates move about the Earth they can rise and fall due to changing pressures and the presence of glaciers. If a beach is moving upwards relative to other plates this is known as isostatic change and raised beaches can be formed. Land level changes (isostatic change) This is found in the U.K. as above the line from the Wash to the Severn estuary, the land was covered in ice sheets during the last ice age. The weight of the ice caused northeast Scotland to sink, displacing the southeast and forcing it to rise. As the ice sheets receded the reverse process happened, as the land was released from the weight. At current estimates the southeast is sinking at a rate of about 2 mm per year, with northeast Scotland rising by the same amount. Coastal landforms =Spits= Chesil Beach, a tombolo in Dorset, United Kingdom. If the coast suddenly changes direction, especially around an estuary, spits are likely to form. Long shore drift pushes the sediment along the beach but when it reaches a turn as in the diagram, the long shore drift does not always easily turn with it, especially near an estuary where the outward flow from a river may push sediment away from the coast. The area may also be shielded from wave action, preventing much long shore drift. On the side of the headland receiving weaker waves, shingle and other large sediments will build up under the water where waves are not strong enough to move them along. This provides a good place for smaller sediments to build up to sea level. The sediment, after passing the headland will accumulate on the other side and not continue down the beach, sheltered both by the headland and the shingle. Slowly over time sediment simply builds on this area, extending the spit outwards, forming a barrier of sand. Once in a while, the wind direction will change and come from the other direction. During this period the sediment will be pushed along in the other direction. The spit will start to grow backwards, forming a 'hook'. After this time the spit will grow again in the original direction. Eventually the spit will not be able to grow any further because it is no longer sufficiently sheltered from erosion by waves, or because the estuary current prevents sediment resting. Usually in the salty but calm waters behind the spit there will form a salt marshland. Spits often form around the breakwater of artificial harbours requiring dredging. Occasionally, if there is no estuary then it is possible for the spit to grow across to the other side of the bay and form what is called a bar, or barrier. Barriers come in several varieties, but all form in a manner similar to spits. They usually enclose a bay to form a lagoon. They can join two headlands or join a headland to the mainland. When an island is joined to the mainland with a bar or barrier it is known as a tombolo. This usually occurs due to wave refraction, but can also be caused by isostatic change, a change in the level of the land (e.g. Chesil Beach).

Her work has appeared in The New Yorker, Harper's Magazine, Esquire, The Best American Short Stories (1993, 2006, 2012), and The O. Henry Prize Stories (1998, 2008). Life Gaitskill was born in Lexington, Kentucky. She has lived in New York City, Toronto, San Francisco, Marin County and Pennsylvania, as well as attending the University of Michigan, where she earned her B.A. in 1981 and won a Hopwood Award. She sold flowers in San Francisco as a teenage runaway. In a conversation with novelist and short story writer Matthew Sharpe for BOMB Magazine, Gaitskill said she chose to become a writer at age 18 because she was \\"indignant about things‚Äîit was the typical teenage sense of 'things are wrong in the world and I must say something.'\\"Sharpe, Matthew. \\"Mary Gaitskill\\". BOMB Magazine. Spring 2009. Retrieved July 27, 2011. Gaitskill has also recounted (in her essay \\"Revelation\\") becoming a born-again Christian at age 21 but lapsing after six months. She married the writer Peter Trachtenberg in 2001. They divorced in 2010. Gaitskill has taught at UC Berkeley, the University of Houston, New York University, The New School, Brown University, in the MFA program at Temple University and Syracuse University. She was the Writer-In-Residence at Hobart and William Smith Colleges. As of 2020, Gaitskill is a visiting professor of literature at Claremont McKenna College. Works Gaitskill attempted to find a publisher for four years before her first book, the short story collection Bad Behavior, was published in 1988. The first four stories are written in the third person point of view from the perspectives of male characters. The remaining five stories are written from the perspectives of female characters. Secretary is the only story in the book written in the first-person point of view. Several of the stories have themes of sexuality, romance, love, sex work, sadomasochism, drug addiction, being a writer in New York City, and living in New York City. A Romantic Weekend and Secretary both explore themes of BDSM and psychological aspects of dominance and submission in sexual relationships. The story Connection is about a female friendship. Gaitskill's fiction is typically about female characters dealing with their own inner conflicts, and her subject matter matter-of-factly includes many \\"taboo\\" subjects such as prostitution, addiction, and sado-masochism. Gaitskill says that she had worked as a stripper and call girl. She showed similar candor in an essay about being raped, \\"On Not Being a Victim,\\" for Harper's. Gaitskill's 1994 essay in Harper's also addresses feminist debates about date rape, victimization, and responsibility. She describes ways that individual subjectivity influences all experiences, making it impossible to come to \\"universally agreed-upon conclusions.\\" The film Secretary (2002) is based on the short story of the same name in Bad Behavior, although the two have little in common. She characterized the film as \\"the Pretty Woman version, heavy on the charm (and a little too nice),\\" but observed that the \\"bottom line is that if [a film adaptation is] made you get some money and exposure, and people can make up their minds from there.\\" The novel Two Girls, Fat and Thin follows the childhood and adult lives of Justine Shade (thin) and Dorothy Never (fat). Justine works through her sadomasochistic issues while Dorothy works through her up-and-down commitment to the philosophy of \\"Definitism\\" and its founder \\"Anna Granite\\" (thinly veiled satires of Objectivism and Ayn Rand). When journalist Justine interviews Dorothy for an expos√© of Definitism, an unusual relationship begins between the two women. In an interview, Gaitskill discussed what she was trying to convey about Justine via her sadomasochistic impulses: The novel The Mare, published in 2015, is written from the perspectives of several different characters. The primary characters are named Ginger and Velvet (short for Velveteen). Ginger is a middle-aged woman who meets Velvet, a young adolescent, through The Fresh Air Fund. Other characters whose perspectives are featured include Paul (Ginger's husband), Silvia (Velvet's mother), Dante (Velvet's younger brother), and Beverly (a horse trainer). Gaitskill received the Arts and Letters Award in Literature from The American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2018. Gaitskill's other honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2002 and a PEN/Faulkner Award nomination for Because They Wanted To in 1998. Veronica (2005) was a National Book Award nominee, as well as a National Book Critics Circle finalist for that year. The book is centered on the narrator, a former fashion model and her friend Veronica who contracts AIDS.

It is owned by Clark County and operated by the Clark County Department of Aviation. Known locally as Northtown, it is the second-busiest airport in the Las Vegas area and the third-busiest in Nevada. It is the primary airport in the Las Vegas area for general aviation and scenic tours, allowing McCarran International Airport to focus on airline flights. North Las Vegas offered limited regional airline service in the past. Many helicopter operators including the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department use the airport. The airport is certificated under 14 CFR Part 139.  History  The airport opened on December 7, 1941, as Sky Haven Airport. Given the significance of the date, only one of the three founders, Florence Murphy, remained to run the airport. Sky Rider Motel opened in the early 1960s during an expansion project at the airport, featuring a swimming pool shaped like an airplane. In 1968 Hughes Tool Company purchased the airport, then called North Las Vegas Air Terminal.  Facilities North Las Vegas Airport covers at an elevation of . It has three asphalt runways: 7/25 is 5,005 by 75 feet (1,525 x 23 m), 12R/30L is 5,001 by 75 feet (1,524 x 23 m), and 12L/30R is 4,203 by 75 feet (1,281 x 23 m). In the year of 2014 the airport had 126,942 aircraft operations, average 348 per day: 94% civil, 5% air taxi and <1% military. As of August, 2015 there were 536 aircraft based at this airport: 76% single-engine, 14% multi-engine, 4% jet, 6% helicopter and <1% ultralight.  Runway incursions The airport has worked on a program to reduce the number of runway incursions at the airport. For the year of 2007, North Las Vegas ranked #2 in airports with most runway incursions. Incidents and accidents On August 30, 1978, Las Vegas Airlines Flight 44, a Piper PA-31-350 Navajo Chieftain (N44LV), crashed in VFR conditions shortly after takeoff from runway 25. Flight 44 was a charter flight from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Santa Ana, California, with nine Australian tourists and a pilot on board. After liftoff following a longer-than-normal ground roll, the aircraft pitched nose up, climbed steeply to about 400 ft above the ground, stalled, reversed course, and crashed 1,150 ft beyond and 650 ft to the right of the runway. All persons on board the aircraft were killed. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was a backed out elevator down-stop bolt that limited down elevator travel and made it impossible for the pilot to prevent a pitchup and stall after takeoff. There was no fire. On January 2, 2013, a twin-engine Piper Aerostar crashed and burst into flames at North Las Vegas Airport after a hard landing. The two occupants escaped uninjured.

The petition dated 1685 of Bishop Andres Gonzales of Nueva Caceres, now known as Naga City in the Bicol Region, requesting the king of Spain to have Masbater and the Pueblo of Catanauan assigned to Recollect Order was reflective of the early creation of Catanauan. The recognized foundation date of the Municipality was January 20, 1686. In the late 18th and 19th century, there were frequent Moro raids. These occurrences prompted the people to construct two small stone forts or watch towers (magkatanawan) mounted with artillery. Santa Maria watch tower was located at Lot 21 psc-2 near the present wharf is located. Castillo watch tower stood at the intersection of present Rizal and Boncan Street. Hence, the name Catanauan was so derived.

Last June 18, 2017, 2 soldiers were hurt and 2 generator sets were burned at an encounter with the rebels at a Globe cell site tower in barangay Ajos. Town fiesta December 8 - immaculate conception church town fiesta =Boling-Boling festival= Immaculate Conception Parish Church \\"Boling- Boling\\" is an old age practice particular to Catanauanins, which is celebrated annually starting on the Sunday and ends on Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday and signals the start of the Lenten Season. Participants roam around the town garbed in any costume they may fancy. Most of them wear colourful clown-like clothes while others imitate anybody whom they despise and make fun of them. It is the Pinoy version of carnival. No one can tell exactly when and how this practice started, not even the oldest resident of this town located at the heart of Bondoc Peninsula. Senior women wearing brightly coloured dresses and hats with flowers sing and dance from one house to another to solicit cash donations, half of which is given to the local Parish Church for its expenses during the Lenten Season activities and the other half for their own group‚Äôs civic projects. Boling-Boling comes from the Visayan word Boling, which means dirt. This reminds us that we are sinners and that we need to repent, do some spiritual cleansing and get ourselves ready for the Lenten Season. In earlier times, Catanauanins had a grandiose merry-making during the Boling-Boling as, starting the following day, which is Ash Wednesday, they will keep silent suspending all merry-makings until the Black Saturday in reverence to the Lenten Season. Some men skimpily clad in their undergarments put on mud or grease with charcoal all over their bodies and roam around the town trying to scare young women and children for fun.  Catanauan Excavations  Catanauan, Quezon is a coastal third-class municipality of the western Bondoc Peninsula, with the municipality of Mulanay on its south and southeast. It has coordinates of 13¬∞ 35' 30\\" N, 122¬∞ 19' 30\\" E, and its town has a total land area of 266 kilometers. Catanauan has a population of 57, 736 people in 11, 283 households. (2000 Philippine Census). The town proper faces Mompog pass and Marinduque Island, and borders the municipality of General Luna in the north-west, the municipality of Buenavista in the north-east. The archaeological potential of Catanauan was brought to light in 2006 when Mr. Deo Cuerdo, citizen and cultural advocate of the municipality, reported to the University of the Philippines Archaeological Studies Program (UP-ASP) and the National Museum, cases of accidentally uncovered archaeological materials due to development projects, earthmoving activities, and even illegal diggings. The reported archaeological materials were mostly of jar burials. UP-ASP conducted a preliminary archaeological survey in 2008, and discovered three sites. Since then, there have been a total of 8 excavation seasons in 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and most recently in January 2017. = Sites = In the Catanauan excavations, there were 4 main sites; Napa site locality 1, Napa site locality 4, Campo site, and Comiso site. Each contain their own distinct artifacts and discoveries.  Napa Site Locality 1  Napa Site (Code IV-2008-Q5) was the primary excavation site, containing multiple trenches along with 3 main assemblages; SM1, SM2, and SM3, or ‚ÄúStone Markers‚Äù. This is where most jar burials and tools were found.  Napa Site Locality 4  Locality 4 is a second location close to locality 1 with four active trenches containing multiple jar burials in very tight clusters, along with coral markers and lids scattered throughout.  Kampo Santo Site  This location, initially a 20th-century cemetery, was excavated with the hopes of discovering similar human remains, but unidentified markers were discovered, which purpose has not yet been determined.  Comiso Property Sites  This survey site was one of the earliest to be excavated and surveyed. Located in Barangay Matandang Sabang Kanluran, this site was heavily stirred up and roiled by quarrying sand. It was later discovered that this was once also another burial site. Its similarities though to other burial sites remain unclear. = Jar Burials = Catanauan, Quezon has been known for the numerous jar burials that have been recovered there. Even before the recent excavations in the site, locals have already reported that some jar burials in the site were uncovered through development projects, and that they were able to dig up a series of jar burials with human remains. As the site is very archaeologically rich, the Archaeological Studies Program of the University of the Philippines, Diliman and the Australia National University have been conducting research and excavations in Catanauan through the Catanauan Archaeological and Heritage Project since 2008. The Napa site in Barangay Tuhian, Catanauan is a very significant place for archaeological research. Most of the jar burials found in Catanauan were recovered from this site. In the 2008 excavation, a lot of jar burials with their human remains were found in Locality 1, Napa site, specifically in trenches 4 and 6. The jars found were mostly earthenware. Different types of coral slabs and rocks served as jar covers. The jars were used for primary and secondary burials. Paz, et al. (2008) inferred that people ‚Äúwent back to uncover the jars, take out the human remains in the jars, and when events dictated, a new body was placed in the old jar‚Äù. Some excavated jars were also used for child burials. Aside from human bones, different-colored glass beads, gastropods and fragments of metal were found inside the jars. Boat-shaped burial markers were also found in the site. In 2010, more jar burials have been recovered as additional trenches were opened. One very distinct jar was the jar found in Trench 13 because of its unique features. It was the only jar from the site which had earthenware as its cover (Paz, et al., 2010). It was oval-shaped and neonate remains were found inside it. Paz, et al. (2010) stated that as of 2010, there are 28 definite jar burials for the Napa site and they are at least a thousand years old. Comiso Property site is another jar burial site in Catanauan. It is less than 10 km away from the Napa site. Burial jar sherds and fragments of human remains were found on the surface of the site (Paz, et al., 2010). The jar burials were found under shell middens. However, unlike the jars in Napa site, there were no Chinese glass beads found in the Comiso site. This may mean that the Comiso site is older than the Napa site (Paz, et al., 2011). = Artifacts = Various artifacts have been excavated from Catanauan sites. These artifacts consists of burial jars, Earthenware sherds, skeletal remains, and shell middens. In 2006, a sand quarry accidentally uncovered at least 5 jar burials containing human skeletal remains in Kanlagkit, Barangay Matandang Sabang Kanluran. At least three sandpits were left partially open, with the backfill containing earthenware sherds and skeletal fragments (mostly long bone). During the 2008 excavation a shell midden was exposed. The area where local inhabitants dug up burial jars with human remains was abundant in limestone slab fragments, earthenware sherds, and human skeletal fragments. Below the discovered shell midden were a few shells and pottery. Even below that, two small, well fired reddish earthenware pot sherds were found. Some glass beads were also found. A child (neonate) burial was found inside a small earthenware pot 40 cm in diameter, with yellow glass beads buried along with it. Another burial (a female, from studying the pelvic bone) was discovered, and this had sherds from a small pot and a cylindrical artifact. = Heritage Work = To facilitate several forms of public archaeology and heritage work in the duration of the field season in the Napa site, crew members were oriented to always explain the significance of the archaeological project, at a community level and at larger scale of Philippine culture, to the community members and walk-in groups observing the excavation. The team also held day trips for student coming from different schools like San Isidro National High School - Catanauan, Tayuman National High School, Busdak National High School and ASTI College, mostly coming from near cities and/or provinces. In addition, they updated the tarpaulin signage at the Locality 1 site, Napa site, that explains the study of archaeology and highlights of the findings so far. The team also actively participated in the fiesta celebrations of Tuhian. As part of the celebration, the team is given a chance to explain to the public community what the project is all about. At the end of the season, the team mounted and left a three-panel exhibit of the results from the first season of excavation (2008). The exhibit explained what archaeology is, the findings and result of the project, and its significance to Philippine history and heritage. They made the exhibit movable so they can move it due to events and gatherings in the barangay. References * Paz, et al.

In a meeting of the ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON HIGHER EDUCATION the veto of CPPVE was said to be caused by unfairly high fees charged to smaller institutions and \\"vindictiveness by Council staff\\" to institutions that didn't comply. With new legislation in 1997 \\"the Legislature created the Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education\\" within the Department of Consumer Affairs, and transferred \\"responsibility for administration of the Reform Act from the Council to the Bureau\\" placing CPU under the authority of the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education (BPPVE). Staffing and funding of the Bureau was transitioned over a period of years such that the Council continued to operate until 2005 and BPPVE ceased operation in 2007 due to a sunset clause in the law. California Department of Education Private Postsecondary Education Division also ceased operation in 2007. Institutions that were in good standing with BPPVE were allowed to continue operation under existing approvals that were valid for two years, until the (BPPE) \\"Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education came into existence on January 1, 2010, following passage of Assembly Bill 48, known as the California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009\\" (California Education Code, Title 3, Division 10, Part 59, Chapter 8). The BPPVE was not intended to be a recognized accreditor, nor did its approval serve as a substitute for educational accreditation. California laws were in transition for several years leaving the future of unaccredited institutions in doubt. Under BPPE both accredited and non- accredited institutions may apply for approval to operate in California. Under BPPVE state approval was, however, a prerequisite in order for a private institution to become accredited. BPPVE informational materials stated \\"Approval is not the same as accreditation.\\" =Site visits and CPU's response: 1994‚Äì1995= In 1994 Marin County inspectors discovered eight permitless dormitories on CPU founder Les Carr's property. Marin County officials cited Carr for \\"multiple zoning, safety, and health violations\\". Carr was forced to remove the dormitories, as well as to remove references to the property as \\"a retreat center on a beautiful ranch in northern Marin county\\" in CPU's promotional literature.Chileno man's 'diploma mill' ordered shut By Gregory Foley, Point Reyes Light, December 30, 1999 An August 1995 site visit committee of the Council for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education found that CPU had not met the new regulations. It failed the 1995 visit on the basis of 88 points. The council's review of CPU listed numerous violations of academic standards, including: * \\"One master's-degree student was given credit for \\"a learning contract describing how he would continue taking dance lessons and watch dance demonstrations in order to improve his skills as a Country Western dancer.\\"\\" * \\"A Ph.D. dissertation written in Spanish was approved by four faculty who cannot speak the language.\\" * \\"One dissertation \\"had no hypothesis, no data collection, and no statistical analysis. A member of the visiting committee characterized the work as more like a project paper at the college freshman level.\\" The dissertation, The Complete Guide to Glass Collecting, was 61 pages long.\\" * \\"At least nine students who received the Ph.D. degree in 1994 had been enrolled less than 20 months, four of them less than 12.\\"Chileno doctor in trouble over 'phony' university By Paul Neimann, Point Reyes Light, December 24, 1997 On November 15, 1995, CPU submitted a response challenging the CPPVE findings. CPU's response argued that the CPPVE's August report \\"is grossly in error in most details, as documented in the 86 errors of fact enumerated\\", and therefore argued that the CPPVE report was \\"utterly unreliable as an objective and thorough evaluation of CPU\\".Columbia Pacific University Response to the Report of the Visiting Committee, November 15, 1995 CPU's response argued that the CPPVE Visiting Committee's review of CPU dissertations was based on superficial judgments. In \\"Error of Fact No. 27\\", for example, CPU's response says that the complaint about the lack of \\"evidence of competency in statistical research\\" was erroneous because \\"many dissertations do not require statistical analysis\\". In \\"Error of Fact No. 28\\" and \\"Error of Fact No. 31\\", regarding CPPVE's finding that a Ph.D. dissertation was submitted in Spanish and reviewed by faculty who could not speak the language, CPU responded that the indicated student \\"provided an authenticated English translation\\" and had been working with a Spanish-fluent mentor who resided in Venezuela. =Closure and appeals: 1995‚Äì2000= CPPVE director Kenneth Miller issued CPU a Denial of Application for Approval in December 1995. CPU administrators appealed the decision to close the school, but an administrative court judge ruled against the appeal on June 10, 1997. Among other items, the administrative appeals judge found that CPU: * awarded excessive credit for prior experiential learning to many students; * failed to employ duly qualified faculty; and * failed to meet various requirements for issuing PhD degrees. In the state's 1997 lawsuit to compel CPU to close, California Deputy Attorney General Asher Rubin called the correspondence school \\"a diploma mill which has been preying on California consumers for too many years\\" and \\"a consumer fraud, a complete scam\\". The suit also referred to Columbia Pacific University as a \\"phony operation\\" offering \\"totally worthless [degrees]...to enrich its unprincipled promoters\\". On December 2, 1999, the Marin County Superior Court ordered the school be shut down,Diploma Mills; Federal Employees Have Obtained Degrees from Diploma Mills and Other Unaccredited Schools, Some at Government Expense, Statement of Robert J. Cramer, Managing Director Office of Special Investigations, U.S. General Accounting Office, Testimony Before the Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, May 11, 2004 also levying $10,000 in fines against CPU for its \\"deceptive and unfair practices\\" in operating without authorization and failing to disclose its status to prospective students during the appeals process. Judge Lynn Duryee noted in her decision that \\"The decision is not whether or not the students are dissatisfied... I mean that is not the test. It's like saying, you know, that prostitution should not be illegal because the customers are satisfied. It's not the test.\\" This appeal was lost in 2000 and CPU was ordered to close. The Supreme Court of California upheld the denial of CPU's approval to operate. =Columbia Commonwealth University and CPU founder Les Carr= Soon after CPU's closure in California, founder Les Carr relocated to Missoula, Montana and formed \\"Columbia Commonwealth University\\" (CCWU).Ex-Chileno man moves ‚Äòdiploma mill‚Äô to Montana , By Gregory Foley, Point Reyes Light, March 22, 2001Sparsely, Sage and Timely , Point Reyes Light, January 29, 2004, By David V.

The story is based on a 1947 children's book of the same name by Charles Tazewell and was a project for the new generation of Disney animators including Don Bluth, Jerry Rees, Henry Selick, Gary Goldman, and John Pomeroy. The story tells of a young boy, outside Nazareth, who must part with his best friend, an old donkey named Small One. He brings it to market, but no one is in need of a \\"scrawny donkey\\", except for a tanner. Plot summary In the Galilean countryside near the city of Nazareth, a young boy and his father own four donkeys. Three of these donkeys are young and strong. The fourth donkey, Small One, is old and weak, but the boy loves him anyway. Every day, the boy and the donkey play together before they go to work, helping the boy's father to collect wood. The boy and his father take the donkeys to work one morning, as they always do. Many times, the boy loads Small One with small sticks, since Small One can't carry heavy loads any more. Small One even has trouble carrying stacks of small sticks and the boy helps to carry them for him. That evening, the boy's father tells the boy that he has to sell Small One because he can no longer do enough work to cover the cost of his care. Devastated, but understanding, the boy asks if he can be the one to sell his best friend. The father agrees and tells him that he has to sell him for one piece of silver. That night, the boy comforts Small One and promises to find him a gentle and loving master. The next morning, the boy takes Small One to the market. Their task begins by being tricked into a haunting visit to the local tanner by a guard at the city gates. Terrified, they quickly run out of the shop once they realize he only wants the donkey's hide. As they wander the streets looking for a buyer, they encounter several townspeople, shop owners, and merchants, none of whom want to buy. In a final attempt to find a buyer, the boy leads Small One onto the stage at a horse auction. The auctioneer has no interest in selling a \\"scrawny donkey,\\" which causes the boy to insist that Small One is \\"good enough to be in a king's stable.\\" This prompts the auctioneer to laugh and poke fun, sarcastically playing along to embarrass them and rouse the crowd. When he attempts to sit on Small One, he shoves the boy out of the way. Upon seeing this, Small One rouses the strength to buck and kick the auctioneer off him, sending him crashing into the stage and knocking it over. Afraid and ashamed, the boy and Small One run around a corner to escape the unruly auctioneer. As dusk falls on the city, the pair have run out of options, and sit on a street corner weeping, without hope. In this bleak moment, a kind man comes up to the boy and asks if Small One is for sale. The man needs a gentle donkey to carry his wife to Bethlehem, insists he will take good care of him, and offers one piece of silver. The boy accepts, says goodbye to Small One, and watches as the couple and Small One leave on their journey as a bright star appears in the sky. Characters *Small One: He is a gentle donkey past his prime. Long years of working hard have made him weak. Though he eats as much as the other donkeys, he cannot handle the same loads. His right ear never likes to stay straight up, giving him that \\"Disney cuteness\\" rating. He has strong feelings for the Boy and would give his life to help him, as he almost does at the tanner's. *Boy: He is about ten years old. Although he takes care of all the donkeys, Small One is his favorite. When his father tells him to sell Small One, the boy is devastated. Soon he accepts it. Though he loves the donkey, he accepts what his father tells him. He assures Small One will have a gentle and loving master and he does. *Father: The boy's father is not seen much at all. He is the one who sends the boy to sell Small One. He loves his son and deep down, he loves Small One too, but he knows they cannot afford to keep a donkey that cannot carry a large load. He owes money to the Three Merchants, which may impact his decision to profit from Small One's gradual enfeeblement. *Three Merchants: These three men, one tall and skinny, one medium and skinny, and the last short and round, walk around the marketplace taking money from people, \\"for the bank\\". They are the ones who point the boy to the auctioneer. *Auctioneer: He auctions horses in the market. At first he is angered that the boy brings Small One onto the stage and slightly embarrasses him. However, when the boy tells him what Small One can do, the man changes his mind and is intrigued, especially when the boy tells him that Small One is \\"good enough to be in a King's stable\\". With that, he decides to have some fun. He mocks and almost injures Small One with his weight. But when Small One sees his best friend pushed aside, he regains his strength and throws the man off of his back. The auctioneer then chases them away. *The tanner: A minor antagonist, he kills animals to make leather from their skins to sell or barter in his shop. *The three donkeys: Small One's barn mates. They seem jealous that the boy spends more time with Small One than them, but they understand that the boy represents a forerunner of the Christ in the tradition of John the Baptist, and they forgive the boy for his favoritism. *Joseph: The man who buys The Small One at the end of the film. Though his name is never mentioned, from the context (he states that he needs a donkey to carry his wife to Bethlehem) he is obviously the stepfather of Jesus. *The Potter: The Potter, a minor character, is first seen doing his job, making clay pots. A boy comes by to ask him if he wants to buy his donkey, Small One. The Potter refuses, saying that he's nothing but \\"a sorry bag of bones\\" and that he has \\"buyers by the dozens - and their mother and their cousins\\". He then tells the boy to go away. *The Baker: The baker is the second minor character,first seen doing his job, baking bagels. A boy comes by to ask him if he wants to buy his donkey, Small One. The baker refuses, saying that he is a \\"scrawny undernourished little beast\\" and that his large and obese wife is a \\"healthy size\\", so he will buy a horse instead.

Veteran animator Eric Larson was selected to head the training program, in which he selected and trained graduates from colleges and art schools across the United States. Eventually, twenty-five new artists were hired from 1970 to 1977. The idea for The Small One originated from story trainee Pete Young who found the book among optioned properties at the studio library. He developed the initial storyboards at home, and pitched it to Ron Miller who claimed it to be a story with \\"heart\\". To help polish the storyboards, Miller brought on veteran storyboard artist Vance Gerry to collaborate with Young. Larson had assumed he would be directing the film and brought Burny Mattinson to help re-board the story, as well as veteran animator Cliff Nordberg to help assist on the animation. According to Mattinson, the team left on Friday for the weekend, and returned on Monday to have their work tossed out because studio management had decided to give the project to Don Bluth to direct. Then-animator Betsy Baytos claimed Larson, in reaction to the news, \\"just shook his head and knew that he wasn't being appreciated. He felt the old days were gone.\\" In retrospect, Bluth stated, \\"Small One was something I directed to get the crew busy until Pete's Dragon...[Larson] might have [been involved] in the storyboard area. [But he] didn't get to direction. I think he elected to [teach].\\" Given the allotted production budget, Bluth composed two songs himself with a third song composed by assistant director Richard Rich, and recycled animation of Mowgli from The Jungle Book (1967).

This DVD also featured Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983) and Pluto's Christmas Tree (1952). The short is edited in two places: * The star at the end has been given more lines to look less like a cross. * The song the three merchants sing has had a lyrics change. The lyric \\"We never, never fail when we go to make a sale, we simply cheat a little if we must\\" was changed to \\"We never, never fail when we go to make a sale, we work a little harder if we must.\\" The reason for these edits is not known; but it may have to do with the merchants being \\"Jewish\\" stereotypes. This short is also featured on the DVD Walt Disney Animation Collection: Classic Short Films: Volume 7: Mickey's Christmas Carol released on September 29, 2009. It was also released on Region 2 on the DVD Walt Disney Presents Countdown to Christmas.

It is about north of the village of Wool and west of the major port of Poole. The collection traces the history of the tank. With almost 300 vehicles on exhibition from 26 countries it is the largest collection of tanks and the third largest collection of armoured vehicles in the world.The Mus√©e des Blind√©s in France has a collection of 880 armoured vehicles, although it includes fewer tanks than Bovington. It includes Tiger 131, the only working example of a German Tiger I tank, and a British First World War Mark I, the world's oldest surviving combat tank. It is the museum of the Royal Tank Regiment and the Royal Armoured Corps and is a registered charity. History The writer Rudyard Kipling visited Bovington in 1923 and, after viewing the damaged tanks that had been salvaged at the end of the First World War, recommended a museum should be set up. Accordingly a shed was established to house the collection but was not opened to the general public until 1947. George Forty, who was appointed Director of the Museum in 1982, expanded and modernized the collection. He retired in 1993 after which he received an OBE. The museum established its own YouTube channel to teach about the tanks in January 2010.

Stan challenges their authority and goes anyway. Meanwhile, Cartman's Uncle Howard and his friend, Charlie Manson, bust out of prison and cause mayhem and mischief. Plot Stan asks his parents for permission to see Cartman's grandmother in Nebraska for the holidays, but they refused because this place is far away from South Park. Feeling disillusioned with the idea of family, he runs off to Cartman's house just in time to join the other boys.

Manson arrives at the Cartman household, and, together with Uncle Howard, proceeds to hold everyone hostage. Stan's parents arrive and punishes him for disobeying their order to not go to Cartman's grandmother in Nebraska without their permission. Stan asks to make an escape with Uncle Howard and Manson but Manson talks to him about the meaning of family, which makes him change his mind. Manson and Uncle Howard surrender and sing a holiday-special style song. Stan's parents agree that they were unreasonable when denying him a Christmas with his friends. Later, as Manson goes to sleep in prison, Stan, Kyle, and all of the Cartmans appear to sing \\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\\" to Manson.

It is a member of the screwpalm family Pandanaceae. Kiekie has numerous cane-like stems up to 40 mm in diameter, which freely produce aerial roots. It climbs tree trunks, or forms dense tangles on the forest floor. Its stems and leaves are a dominant feature in many areas of New Zealand forest, the stems eventually reaching up to 30 m long. The leaves are long and slender, 60‚Äì90 cm long and 2-2.5 cm broad. Distribution Kiekie is found in forests throughout the North Island. In the South Island, kiekie is more common in higher rainfall areas, reaching its southern limit near the Clarence river in the east and in Fiordland in the west. Classification In 1973, B.C. Stone argued that F. banksii should be regarded as a subspecies of F. baueriana of Norfolk Island (Stone 1973). Subsequent to this, de Lange et al. (2005:591-592), countered Stone's arguments and retained F. banksii as a distinct species because of significant differences from F. baueriana, including over all growth habit, phyllotaxis, leaf width, vein tessellation, and bract colour (salmon pink to orange in F. baueriana, white to purplish in F. banksii). Uses The sweet-tasting fruits and the succulent flower bracts (tƒÅwhara) were a delicacy of the MƒÅori. These were often gathered by using a forked stick. The leaves widely for plaiting and weaving, although the broader leaves of New Zealand flax were preferred because they provided more material. Items woven included mats and temporary baskets for holding food. The aerial roots were gathered to use as a binding material for implements and for making fish traps and sandals.

It was the capital of the kingdom led by the Pandavas in the Mahabharata epic. Under the Pali form of its name, Indapatta, it is also mentioned in Buddhist texts as the capital of the Kuru mahajanapada. Modern historical research pin its location in the region of present-day New Delhi, particularly the Old Fort (Purana Qila).The city is sometimes also known as Khandavaprastha or Khandava Forest, the name of a forest region on the banks of Yamuna river which (according to the Mahabharata) had been cleared by Krishna and Arjun to build the city. History Indraprastha is referenced in the Mahabharata, a Sanskrit Indian text compiled over a period approximately between 400 BCE and 400 CE. It was one of the five places demanded for the sake of peace and to avert a disastrous war, Krishna proposed that if Hastinapur agrees to give the Pandavas only five villages named Indraprastha (Delhi), Swarnprastha (Sonipat), Panprastha (Panipat), Vyaghrprastha (Baghpat) and Tilprastha (Tilpat) if these five villages was given to pandavas then they would be satisfied and would make no more demands. Duryodhana vehemently refused, commenting that he would not part even with land as much as the point of a needle. Thus the stage was set for the great war, for which the epic of Mahabharata is known most of all. The Mahabharata records Indraprastha as being home to the Pandavas, whose wars with the Kauravas it describes. The location of Indraprastha is uncertain but Purana Qila in present-day New Delhi is frequently cited{{efnFor instance, Indologist J. A. B. van Buitenen, who translated the Mahabharata, wrote in 1973 that \\"there can be no reasonable doubt about the locations of Hastinapura, of Indraprastha (Delhi's Purana Qila [...]), and of Mathura. and has been noted as such in texts as old as the 14th-century CE. The modern form of the name, Inderpat, continued to be applied to the Purana Qila area into the early 20th century; in a study of ancient Indian place-names, Michael Witzel considers this to be one of many places from the Sanskrit Epics whose names have been retained into modern times, such as Kaushambi/Kosam. Location Purana Qila is certainly an ancient settlement but archaeological studies performed there since the 1950s have failed to reveal structures and artefacts that would confirm the architectural grandeur and rich lives in the period that the Mahabharata describes. The historian Upinder Singh notes that despite the academic debate, \\"Ultimately, there is no way of conclusively proving or disproving whether the Pandavas or Kauravas ever lived ...\\". However, it is possible that the main part of the ancient city has not been reached by excavations so far, but rather falls under the unexcavated area extending directly to the south of Purana Qila.Overal, Delhi has been the center of the area where the ancient city has historically been estimated to be. Until 1913, a village called Indrapat existed within the fort walls. As of 2014, the Archaeological Survey of India is continuing excavation in Purana Qila. Historical Significance Indraprastha is not only known from the Mahabharata. It is also mentioned as \\"Indapatta\\" or \\"Indapattana\\" in Pali-language Buddhist texts, where it is described as the capital of the Kuru Kingdom, situated on the Yamuna River. The Buddhist literature also mentions Hatthinipura (Hastinapura) and several smaller towns and villages of the Kuru kingdom. Indraprastha may have been known to the Greco-Roman world as well: it is thought to be mentioned in Ptolemy's Geography dating from the 2nd century CE as the city \\"Indabara\\", possibly derived from the Prakrit form \\"Indabatta\\", and which was probably in the vicinity of Delhi. Upinder Singh (2004) describes this equation of Indabara with Indraprastha as \\"plausible\\". Indraprastha is also named as a pratigana (district) of the Delhi region in a Sanskrit inscription dated to 1327 CE, discovered in Raisina area of New Delhi.Singh (ed., 2006), p.186 D. C. Sircar, an epigraphist, believed Indraprastha was a significant city in the Mauryan period, based on analysis of a stone carving found in the Delhi area at Sriniwaspuri which records the reign of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka. Singh has cast doubt on this interpretation because the inscription does not actually refer to Indraprastha and although \\"... a place of importance must certainly have been located in the vicinity of the rock edict, exactly which one it was and what it was known as, is uncertain.\\" Similarly, remains, such as an iron pillar, that have been associated with Ashoka are not indubitably so: their composition is atypical and the inscriptions are vague.

Cavalcanti was a wealthy member of the Guelph faction of Florentine aristocrats. He was a merchant banker who, with others, lent money under usurious conditions during the crusades with the consent and support of the papacy. In 1257 Cavalcanti served as Podest√† (chief magistrate) of the Umbrian city of Gubbio. Following the 1260 victory of the Ghibellines over the Florentine Guelphs in the Battle of Montaperti, Cavalcanti went into exile in Lucca in Tuscany. He returned from exile in 1266 and married his son Guido to the daughter of Farinata degli Uberti, a prominent Ghibelline. Despite Cavalcanti's alignment with the papacy-supporting Guelphs, he was denounced as a heretic. It is possible that he was an atheist, like his son. In lines 52-72 of the tenth canto of Dante's Inferno, the poet converses with Cavalcanti about his son, Guido, and depicts the dead father as a doting parent. Dante represents Cavalcanti and Farinata as neighbors in the same tomb in Hell, but without any interaction between them.

It is administered by the National Park Service as part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway. History At the end of the Civil War in 1865, the system of fortification (now known as Fort Circle Parks) which surrounded Washington, D.C. were dismantled. The lumber and other materials were sold at auctions and the land returned to pre-war owners. Fort Marcy is approximately south of the Potomac River on the south side of the Chain Bridge Road leading from Chain Bridge to Langley and McLean, Virginia. By car it can only be reached from the northbound lanes of the George Washington Parkway. The perimeter of the fort is . When completed, the fort mounted 18 guns, a 10-inch (25 cm) mortar and two 24-pound (10 kg) Coehorn mortars. The batteries were aimed toward the south and west. The hill on which the fort is located was known as Prospect Hill. Originally the fort was called Fort Baldy Smith, after General William Farrar Smith, the troops of whose division began construction of the work. His division crossed Chain Bridge on the night of September 24, 1861, and immediately commenced construction of Fort Marcy and Fort Ethan Allen. The 79th New York Highlanders, the 141st Pennsylvania and the Iron Brigade also helped complete the work in the fall of 1862. A force of about 500 contrabands were also employed and the 152nd New York worked on the entrenchments, which incidentally are still in a very good state of preservation. The site of Fort Marcy is near the location where the famous but bloodless duel between Henry Clay and John Randolph was fought in 1826. The fort was not completed until the fall of 1862. It is a relatively undisturbed fort and was named in honor of a native of Massachusetts, Randolph B. Marcy, a distinguished soldier, father-in-law, and chief of staff to General George B. McClellan. Detachments of the 4th New York and 3rd Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery and the 130th Pennsylvania Infantry were among the troops that performed garrison duty here during the war. An interesting incident of history is that the body of troops which afterwards became famous as the \\"Iron Brigade\\" was originated at this fort in the summer of 1861, and was composed of the 19th Indiana, the 2nd, 6th and 7th Wisconsin Regiments. The 24th Michigan was added to the brigade soon after the Battle of South Mountain. These units remained together until the close of the war.

(113.5 x 161.5 cm.), North Carolina Museum of Art Utrecht Caravaggism () refers to those Baroque artists, all distinctly influenced by the art of Caravaggio, who were active mostly in the Dutch city of Utrecht during the first part of the seventeenth century. History Painters such as Dirck van Baburen, Gerrit van Honthorst, Hendrick ter Brugghen, Jan van Bijlert and Matthias Stom were all in Rome in the 1610s, a time when the tenebroso of Caravaggio's later style was very influential. Adam Elsheimer, also in Rome at the same time, was probably also an influence on them. Back in Utrecht, they painted mythological and religious history subjects and genre scenes, such as the card-players and gypsies that Caravaggio himself had abandoned in his later career. Utrecht was the most Catholic city in the United Provinces, still about 40% Catholic in the mid-17th century, and even more among the elite groups, who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there.Wayne Franits, Dutch Seventeenth-Century Genre Painting, p.65, Yale UP, 2004, It had previously been the main centre, after Haarlem, of Northern Mannerist painting in the Netherlands. Abraham Bloemaert, who had been a leading figure in this movement, and taught the Honthursts and many other artists, also was receptive to the influence of his pupils, and changed his style many times before his death in 1651. The brief flourishing of Utrecht Caravaggism ended around 1630. At that time, major artists had either died, as in the case of Baburen and ter Brugghen, or had changed style, like Honthorst's shift to portraiture and history scenes informed by the Flemish tendencies associated with Peter Paul Rubens and his followers. They left a legacy, however, through their influence on Rembrandt's use of chiaroscuro and Gerrit Dou's \\"niche paintings\\" (a genre developed by Honthorst). Along with other Caravaggisti active in Italy and Woerden, they set the stage for later artists who worked in a Caravaggesque- inspired manner such as Georges de La Tour in Lorraine and Jan Janssens in Ghent.

It is situated to the east of Thirlmere and to the west of Glenridding valley. This places White Side in the Helvellyn range of the Eastern Fells, with Raise to the north and Helvellyn Lower Man to the south, both of which are of greater height. Name Strictly the name White Side refers to the western slope of a nameless summit. However it is often applied to the whole fell for convenience as was done by Alfred Wainwright.Alfred Wainwright:A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 1: He gave White Side the status of a separate fell, a position followed by other guidebook writers.Richards, Mark; Near Eastern Fells; Collins (2003); Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): Wainwright suggested that the fell name could have come from the quartz found on the western slope. Topography The western and eastern faces of White Side are quite different in appearance. The eastern face is predominantly crag and scree falling abruptly to Keppel and Brown Coves. In contrast the western face falls gently to Thirlmere, the upper parts being mainly grass. The lower parts do provide some rock, such as Brown Crag, but these are generally outcrops rather than true crags.Map showing White Side and surrounding features from 1925. A great steep-sided hollow is gouged out of the eastern face, just north of the summit. This is the corrie of Kepple Cove, backed by Red Screes. Kepple Cove once contained an artificial tarn, although today the bed is merely marshy except after heavy rain. The water from the tarn was used in a hydroelectric scheme to drive electric winding gear at Greenside Mine. Commissioned in 1891, this was the first such system in the country.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells, Dalesman (1995); It continued in use until the night of 29 October 1927 when the Kepple Cove dam burst during a heavy storm, leaving an wide gap in the earthworks. The resulting wave passed down the valley and through Glenridding village, flooding buildings and causing extensive damage. The breached dam can still be seen today.Blair, Don; Exploring Lakeland Tarns; Lakeland Manor Press (2003); South of Kepple Cove, between the southern ridge of White Side and Catstye Cam is Brown Cove. This also held an artificial tarn, but this is now reduced to a couple of small pools widening the stream. Brown Cove Tarn was another creation of the Greenside mine, a stone faced dam being built in about 1860. The dam is still in place but water now leaks through the base, the extended tarn-bed a smooth patch of luxuriant turf. A water leat passing beneath the north face of Catstye Cam to Red Tarn Beck can still be traced although it is now in ruins. There are also the remains of a level driven into the headwall of Brown Cove, a stone arched entrance leading to an tunnel. Water from Brown and Kepple Coves unites with the outflow of Helvellyn's Red Tarn to form Glenridding Beck, flowing on through the village to Ullswater. The western slopes of White Side are bounded by Helvellyn and Brund Gills, both of which originally flowed north to the Vale of St John. With the construction of the Thirlmere reservoir scheme in 1884 these streams were diverted to feed the lake a cutting being made through the low ridge which runs parallel to the shore. Summit The summit bears a small cairn in a sea of grass with the main ridge path crossing the highest point. Other than north and south where higher fells intervene, the view is good. The subsidiary top of Brown Crag (2,000 ft) on the western face also provides fine views of Skiddaw and The Dodds. Ascents Ascents from the west begin at Swirls or Thirlspot. The Old Pony or White Stones Routes to Helvellyn can be used to give a start before branching off to White Side. Alternatively a more direct path from behind Fisher Place makes straight for the summit. From Glenridding in the east a bridleway zig-zags up beside Kepple Cove to reach the ridge not far from the top. It is also possible to take a direct (and steep) line direct from Brown Cove Dam.

Additionally it is thought to house the largest collection of secular stained glass in the world. History The original collection of Browning works were donated to Baylor in 1918 by Dr. A.J. Armstrong. After the death of the Browning's only son Robert Barrett Browning and subsequent sale of their collection, Dr. Armstrong obtained a list of the items sold and their purchasers, and attempted to acquire the memorabilia via donation or purchase. Dr. Armstrong's collection was originally housed in the Carroll Library. The Carroll Library was heavily damaged in a 1922 fire; none of the Browning works were lost, and a special room was subsequently built to house them. However, by 1925 the collection had outgrown the space. In 1943, Baylor President Pat Neff donated US$100,000 toward a new library. Construction on the library (which would also house the English department) began in 1948 and the finished structure (costing US$1.75 million) was dedicated in 1951. The building was significantly renovated in 1995 to house an even larger collection (by then the English department had relocated) and refurbished in 2012.

D. (2007). General Theory of Emotions and Social Life. Routledge. Other psychologists consider it a mood or as a secondary emotion (including cognitive elements) that can be elicited in the face of insult and/or injury.W TenHouten, Emotion and Reason (2014) p. 20 Inherent in resentment is a perception of unfairness (i.e. from trivial to very serious), and is a generalized defense against unfair situations (e.g. relationships or unfavourable circumstances). The word originates from French \\"ressentir\\", re-, intensive prefix, and sentir \\"to feel\\"; from the Latin \\"sentire\\". The English word has become synonymous with anger, spite, and holding a grudge. Research =Causes= Resentment can result from a variety of situations involving a perceived wrongdoing from an individual, which are often sparked by expressions of injustice or humiliation. Common sources of resentment include publicly humiliating incidents such as accepting negative treatment without voicing any protest; feeling like an object of regular discrimination or prejudice; envy/jealousy; feeling used or taken advantage of by others; and having achievements go unrecognized, while others succeed without working as hard. Resentment can also be generated by dyadic interactions, such as emotional rejection or denial by another person, deliberate embarrassment or belittling by another person, or ignorance, putting down, or scorn by another person. It's worth noting that resentment can also develop, and be maintained by: focusing on past grievances (i.e. disturbing memories of hurtful experiences) continuously. or by trying to justify the emotion (i.e. with additional thoughts/feelings). Thus, resentment can occur as a result of the grief process and can be sustained by ruminating. =Function= Resentment has healthy and unhealthy aspects. Alice MacLachlan writes \\"What we resent reveals what it is we value, and what we have come to expect (or hope) from others; it may also reveal to what we see ourselves as entitled {to}: that is, how our expectations of our surroundings are organized and measured.\\" Indeed, she goes on to further write that only an amoral person (a person who didn't have values or concern for the well-being of self or others) could not experience resentment. Resentment can also function to warn against further, future, harmful and unfair situations from occurring again (its focus is on the future). Resentment, used as a form of distrust, has a strong component of self-punishment: \\"the false appeal of self-punishment is that it seems to keep us safe from future hurt and disappointment\\", when in reality it is hurting the resenter more (i.e. how we mistreat or distrust others unrelated to the offense, ourselves, etc.). Resentment has also been conceptualized as a form of protest: \\"More specifically, resentment protests a past action, that persists as a present threat\\". The 'present threat' being that the past harmful action(s), makes a claim: that you can be treated this way, or that such treatment is acceptable; It poses a threat, and in resenting it, you challenge that claim (i.e. protest). \\"Resentment affirms what the {offenders'} act denies\\"- its harmfulness and the victim's worth. It's worth noting that Pamela Hieronym claims the object of protest is the past event, rather than the offender of the event: claiming that resentment need not develop into malice or a desire for retribution (if resentment is focused on the past harmful situation or event, rather than the person who caused it). Resentment, when it is unhealthy, can come in the form of: hostile anger with a retaliation motive (i.e. fantasizing about putting someone down, devaluing, or paying someone back for a perceived injury), time duration (which can go on for days, weeks, or even years), or when too many resentments are held; Thus, draining resources, creating stress, and draining positive emotions. =Form= Physical Expression A pinched and bitter facial expression Unlike many emotions, resentment does not have physical tags exclusively related to it that telegraph when a person is feeling this emotion. However, physical expressions associated with related emotions such as anger and envy may be exhibited, such as furrowed brows or bared teeth. Resentment can be self-diagnosed by looking for signs such as the need for emotion regulation, faking happiness while with a person to cover true feelings toward him, or speaking in a sarcastic or demeaning way to or about the person. It can also be diagnosed through the appearance of agitation- or dejection-related emotions, such as feeling inexplicably depressed or despondent, becoming angry for no apparent reason, or having nightmares or disturbing daydreams about a person. Internal Experience Resentment is most powerful when it is felt toward someone whom the individual is close to or intimate with. To have an injury resulting in resentful feelings inflicted by a friend or loved one leaves the individual feeling betrayed as well as resentful, and these feelings can have deep effects. Resentment can have a variety of negative results on the person experiencing it, including touchiness or edginess when thinking of the person resented, denial of anger or hatred against this person, and provocation or anger arousal when this person is recognized positively. It can also have more long-term effects, such as the development of a hostile, cynical, sarcastic attitude that may become a barrier against other healthy relationships; lack of personal and emotional growth; difficulty in self-disclosure; trouble trusting others; loss of self-confidence; and overcompensation. Chronic resentment (i.e. too many) can also lead to unhealthy symptoms such as: constriction of nerve endings in your muscles (causing chronic, low-grade muscle and back-pain). Long-lasting (i.e. too long) resentment can cause: destruction of T cell (lowering the immune system), hypertension (which increases the threat of stroke and heart attack), cancer, (drug) addictions, depression, and shortened life span.  Coping  To further compound these negative effects, resentment often functions in a downward spiral. Resentful feelings cut off communication between the resentful person and the person he or she feels committed the wrong, and can result in future miscommunications and the development of further resentful feelings. Because of the consequences they carry, resentful feelings are dangerous to live with and need to be dealt with. Resentment is an obstacle to the restoration of equal moral relations among persons. Resentment and spite also share a connection of self-harm, yet differ primarily in the way they are expressed. Resentment is unique in that it is almost exclusively internalized, where it can do further emotional and psychological damage but does not strongly impact the person resented. By contrast, spite is exclusively externalized, involving vindictive actions against a (perceived or actual) source of wrong. Spiteful actions can stem from resentful feelings, however. Psychologist James J. Messina recommends five steps to facing and resolving resentful feelings: (1) Identify the source of the resentful feelings and what it is the person did to evoke these feelings; (2) develop a new way of looking at past, present and future life, including how resentment has affected life and how letting go of resentment can improve the future; (3) write a letter to the source of the resentment, listing offenses and explaining the circumstances, then forgive and let go of the offenses (but do not send the letter); (4) visualize a future without the negative impact of resentment; and (5) if resentful feelings still linger, return to Step 1 and begin again. = Post-traumatic embitterment disorder = Comparison with other emotions =Resentment vs. Anger= Robert C. Solomon, a professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin, places resentment on the same continuum as anger and contempt, and he argues that the differences between the three are that resentment is anger directed toward a higher-status individual; anger is directed toward an equal-status individual; and contempt is anger directed toward a lower-status individual.Solomon R. C. (1993). The Passions: Emotions and the Meaning of Life. Hackett Publishing. Steven Stosny makes an analogy, distinguishing the functions of anger and resentment, as: anger being a fire- extinguisher meant to 'put-out' and prevent immediately harmful situations, from becoming more harmful, while resentment is more like a smoke-alarm: something that is always 'on' (and requires energy and emotions to sustain this alarm-system), and is meant to protect us if, just in case, someone or something harmful from past experience shows up. Resentment and anger differ primarily in the way they are externally expressed. Anger results in aggressive behavior, used to avert or deal with a threat, while resentment occurs once the injury has been dealt and is not expressed as aggressively or as openly. Another differentiation between anger and resentment, is as follows: anger is about the immediate situation (to back off or submit), whereas resentment is a defensive way to mentally punish (or in the more extreme case, to devalue) yourself, or the remembered offender. Another differentiation is that resentment is rarely (if ever) about a single specific stimulus: even after behavioural changes have been made (i.e. accountability has been addressed) or the stimulus is no longer present (i.e. situation is no longer encountered) resentment can still be present. Whereas anger is triggered by a specific stimulus, and usually reduces in intensity as the stimulus attenuates (or is no longer present). Comparison with other motivations =Resentment vs. Conviction= An important feature of acting on resentment is that it is against something (i.e. unfairness, injustice, abuse, situations that threaten values or well-being). Whereas, acting on conviction is for something (i.e. justice, well-being of self or others, or any other values held by an individual as important). The distinction is important, when acted upon, because while acting for your deeper values creates actions consistent with your values, acting against things (or people) you do not value does not necessarily lead to actions that are consistent with your deeper values (i.e. retribution, murder). Self-reflection can help determine which of the two you are acting on, by stating why the behavior is consistent with your deeper values: if your answer represents conviction, it will reflect your deeper values; if it is resentful it will devalue someone or something. Philosophical perspectives * Scheler considered resentment as the product of weakness and passivity.Albert Camus The Rebel (Vintage nd) p. 17 * Nietzsche saw resentment as an ignoble emotion underlying Rousseau-esque Romanticism - \\"for under all romanticism lie the grunting and greed of Rousseau's instinct for revenge\\".W Kaufmann ed., The Portable Nietzsche (Penguin 1987) p. 514 * Philosopher Robert C. Solomon wrote extensively on the emotion of resentment and its negative effects on those who experience it. Solomon describes resentment as the means by which man clings to his self- respect. He wrote that it is in this moment when humanity is at its lowest ebb. =Ressentiment= Religious perspectives Modern culture The Alcoholics Anonymous organization cites resentment as the number one offender, and one of the greatest threats to an alcoholic.AA Services. Alcoholics Anonymous: The Big Book. Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., 4th edition; 2002. Several of the Twelve Steps (step 4 inventory, step 5 inventory review, step 6 asking the fear to be removed, step 7 asking the shortcoming to be removed, step 8 creation of a list detailing any wrongdoing done, and step 9 actively seeking to make amends) of AA involve identifying and dealing with resentment as part of the path toward recovery, including acknowledging one's own role in resentment and praying for the resentment to be taken away. The inventory that AA suggests for dealing with recovering from resentments is to first inventory the resentment by identifying what person, organization, idea or thing is the source of the resentment, then to identify why it is that thing is causing the resentment and what fear is underlying the conflict. Finally, removing the other person entirely, one must ask himself/herself what is my own part in this play? The book Alcoholics Anonymous then recommends following through with more action. Resentment can also play a role in racial and ethnic conflicts. Resentment is cited as having infected the structure of social value, and is thus a regular catalyst in conflicts sparked by inequality. It can also be one of the emotions experienced during class conflict, particularly by the oppressed social class.

This substantial expansion includes a fifth book and an appendix of songs. It was noted by Nietzsche to be \\"the most personal of all [his] books\\", and contains the greatest number of poems in any of his published works. Title The book's title, in the original German and in translation, uses a phrase that was well-known at the time in many European cultures and had specific meaning. One of its earliest literary uses is in Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel (\\"gai s√ßavoir\\"). It was derived from a Proven√ßal expression (gai saber) for the technical skill required for poetry-writing. The expression proved durable and was used as late as 19th century American English by Ralph Waldo Emerson and E. S. Dallas. It was also used in deliberately inverted form, by Thomas Carlyle in \\"the dismal science\\", to criticize the emerging discipline of economics by comparison with poetry. The book's title was first translated into English as The Joyful Wisdom, but The Gay Science has become the common translation since Walter Kaufmann's version in the 1960s. Kaufmann cites The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (1955) that lists \\"The gay science (Proven√ßal gai saber): the art of poetry.\\" In Ecce Homo, Nietzsche refers to the poems in the Appendix of The Gay Science, saying they were This alludes to the birth of modern European poetry that occurred in Provence around the 11th century, whereupon, after the culture of the troubadours fell into almost complete desolation and destruction due to the Albigensian Crusade (1209‚Äì1229), other poets in the 14th century ameliorated and thus cultivated the gai saber or gaia scienza. In a similar vein, in Beyond Good and Evil Nietzsche observed that, The original English translation as The Joyful Wisdom could be considered more comprehensible to the modern reader given changes in English usage for both \\"gay\\" and \\"science\\" in the second half of the twentieth century. However, it could be considered flawed in poorly reflecting the then still-current use of the phrase in its original meaning for poetry, which Nietszche was deliberately evoking, poorly reflecting the Provencal and French origins of the phrase, and in poorly translating the German. The German \\"fr√∂hliche\\" can be translated \\"happy\\" or \\"joyful\\", cognate to the original meanings of \\"gay\\" in English and other languages. However Wissenschaft never indicates \\"wisdom\\" (wisdom = Weisheit), but a propensity toward any rigorous practice of a poised, controlled, and disciplined quest for knowledge. This word is typically translated to English as \\"science\\", both in this broader meaning and for the specific sets of disciplines now called \\"sciences\\" in English. The term \\"science\\" formerly had a similarly broad connotation in English, referring to useful bodies of knowledge or skills, from the Latin \\"scientia\\". Content The book is usually placed within Nietzsche's middle period, during which his work extolled the merits of science, skepticism, and intellectual discipline as routes to mental freedom. The affirmation of the Proven√ßal tradition (invoked through the book's title) is also one of a joyful \\"yea-saying\\" to life. In The Gay Science, Nietzsche experiments with the notion of power but does not advance any systematic theory. = Eternal recurrence = The book contains Nietzsche's first consideration of the idea of the eternal recurrence, a concept which would become critical in his next work Thus Spoke Zarathustra and underpins much of the later works.Kaufmann (1974), p. 188. = \\"God is dead\\" = Here is also the first occurrence of the famous formulation \\"God is dead\\", first in section 108. Section 125 depicts the parable of the madman who is searching for God. He accuses us all of being the murderers of God. \\"'Where is God?' he cried; 'I will tell you. We have killed him‚Äîyou and I. All of us are his murderers...\\" Notes References * Kaufmann, Walter, Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist, Princeton University Press, 1974. *The Gay Science: With a Prelude in Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs by Friedrich Nietzsche; translated, with commentary, by Walter Kaufmann (Vintage Books, March 1974, ) *P√©rez, Rolando.

Formed in 1996, they were initially called Nextstep. History Sense of Purpose were a Melbourne band who injected their own brand of fast, positive, passionate hardcore into the Australian scene between 1996 and 2006. The band had an outspoken stance on a range of political and social issues. The band released their first full-length CD, \\"A Matter Of Respect\\" in February 2001 along with the previously unreleased EP \\"End Of A New Beginning\\" which was recorded in December 1998 when the band was known as Nextstep. The band played under the moniker of Nextstep between 1996 and 1999 and released a demo tape \\"Together We Can Make A Difference\\" and a 7\\" EP \\"Time To Speak Up\\". In 2003, drummer Pete was brought up front with Chris to give the band a dual vocal attack. Good friend Grant Johns of Dying Breed, was brought in to fill the void on drums. In February 2004, the band headed back to Birdland Studios to record their second full-length CD. \\"Tomorrow's Too Late\\" was released in mid-2004, a time which also saw the band sign with UK hardcore label Go-Team Records who released the CD internationally later that year, with all new artwork. Soon after the band parted ways with original guitarist Leith Gow, who went on to form In Name And Blood and brought in new guitarist Brad O'Gorman, who previously played in UK outfit Insight. But in 2006, Sense Of Purpose decided it was time to exit the scene and released their final CD, the appropriately titled, \\"Dismantled\\" and played their last ever show with good friends The Dead Walk, INAB, Procedure 286 and Go For Broke.

Villages Chrastov√° Lhota, Moravsk√° Chrastov√° and Podles√≠ are administrative parts of Brnƒõnec. History Next to an old trade route, the settlement of Moravsk√° Chrastov√° was founded after 1200 by monks from a monastery in Litomy≈°l. It is first mentioned in a document from 1323. The first written mention of Brnƒõnec is to be found in the 1557 act of partition of the dominion of Swojanow. In 1892, workers carrying out improvements to the Bƒõl√° nad Svitavou road stumbled upon the remnants of prehistoric clay jars in the vicinity of the Nov√° Amerika (\\"New America\\") inn, one kilometre west of Brnƒõnec. Systematic excavation on this site in 1893 unearthed further archaeological finds. A neighbouring hillside of crevices and caves, known as Jeskynƒõ ƒåertovy, had already yielded traces of earlier settlements. Until 1918, the village was part of the Austrian empire (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), in the Poliƒçka district, one of the 94 BezirkshauptmannschaftenDie postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm KLEIN, 1967 in Bohemia.

Austrian KK 2 gulden stamp bilingual cancelled Br√ºnnlitz-Brnƒõnec in 1899 With the construction of the railway from Prague to Brno (before 1850?), Brnƒõnec received its own railway station on this main line. This encouraged numerous new industrial enterprises such as textile factories to develop around the dominant business of the Daubek mills. In 1930, the municipality of Brnƒõnec (including the then districts of Z√°≈ôeƒç√≠ nad Svitavou, now part of the municipality of B≈ôezov√° nad Svitavou, and Podles√≠ counted 606 inhabitants, of whom 208 held German nationality. In 1939, as a result of German occupation and the ensuing retreat of Czech inhabitants, the total population had dropped to 490. The municipality extended at that time only to the Bohemian right bank of the river Svitava. On the opposite Moravian bank was the independent village of Moravsk√° Chrastov√°, which, together with its districts of Chrastov√° Lhota and P≈Ølpecen (now part of the municipality of Chrastavec), had a total population in 1939 of 1,143 inhabitants and was therefore twice the size of Brnƒõnec. The town of Brnƒõnec formed part of the administrative and judiciary region of Politschka. After the annexation of the Sudetenland by Germany, it was integrated into the county of Zwittau. In 1944, Oskar Schindler relocated his German Enamelware Factory (), and the associated prison camp of 1,200 Jewish forced labourers, from Krak√≥w to a munitions factory acquired by him in Brnƒõnec. The Jewish workforce thus escaped transport to the extermination camps and was liberated along with the rest of the village on 10 May 1945 by the Red Army, after the factory had been fully operational for seven months. The Endowment Fund for the Memorial of the Shoah and Oskar Schindler is currently engaged in turning the ruins of the factory into a museum. There are around 800 employment positions in Brnƒõnec today. =The factory= History of the factory: *1840s: The Low-Beer Jewish family moved into the area. They set up the factory, making high-quality textiles. *1938: The Germans occupied Czechoslovakia. The Low-Beer family fled to Britain.

Afterwards, the Communist government of Czechoslovakia nationalized the factory. *1989: Fall of Communism. The factory went into private hands. In its last years the factory made car seat covers and airline blankets. Its last general manager was Franti≈°ek Olbert. *2010: The factory closed and was left abandoned. Afterwards, thieves stripped out much of its wood and metal. *2017: The local government of Brno invited the Low-Beers to come back to the area.

He represented a militant French Catholic element in the French Army, and later headed the F√©d√©ration Nationale Catholique, a short-lived movement (1924-1944) which espoused a socio-religious political ideology, driven by conservative Catholic dogma. Despite his significant achievements during the war, he was never named Marshal of France because of his aristocratic status and his catholic faith and the emerging dominance of a more secular and egalitarian mood in France after the Armistice. Biography =Early years= Born in Aveyron to an Occitan family with a long history in their home province of Languedoc. His father was a lawyer who had once been the mayor of St. Affrique. √âdouard was described as a broadly-built man of short stature, with dark hair and a tan complexion, and a perpetually serious look.Francis Whiting Halsey. \\"The Literary Digest History of the World War Compiled From Original And Contemporary Sources\\". Richardson Press (9 March 2010). Page 102. He joined the army in 1870 and fought in the Franco-Prussian War, 1870‚Äì71. He was Catholic and nicknamed le Capucin Bott√© (the fighting friar). =World War 1= In 1900 he was removed from the General Staff for his anti-semitic, anti- Dreyfusard attitude. Nevertheless, Castelnau later became deputy to Joseph Joffre from 1911 to 1914, and helped develop the strategic Plan XVII for the recapture of Alsace-Lorraine as part of an invasion of Germany. In 1914 with war imminent, General de Castelnau was put in command of the French 2nd Army facing the oncoming Germans in Belgium. Under his leadership, in August 1914, the French 2nd Army was decisively routed by the Germans at the Battle of the Frontiers under Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, with the initial French 2nd Army offensive (along with the French 1st Army) being driven back by the Germans 25 km (16 mi) from the positions where the offensive had initially begun on 14 August. By the end of August, however, the French won back most of the territory lost in the hard-fought Battle of the Trou√©e de Charmes. The Battle of the Trou√©e de Charmes was a definitive victory for the Second Army; in stopping the Germans from passing through the Trou√©e de Charmes, de Castelnau possibly saved the French from disaster, but during this battle he lost his son Xavier, killed in action on August, 20th. Later, his two other sons Gerald and Hugues were to be killed in action in 1914 and 1915. The French were able to then organize a defense at Nancy and hold the city after victory in the Battle of Grand Couronn√©. It was suggested that this battle was decisive in the protection of Paris, by binding up significant German resources in static trench warfare for the duration in Lorraine.Hastings, Max: Catastrophe 2014, Europe Goes to War, Chapter 3, Battle of the Frontiers; Knopf, New York, 2013. In June 1915 de Castelnau was appointed to command the newly created Central Army Group. Later that year he was made chief of staff to Joffre, and in 1916 he organised the initial defence at the Battle of Verdun, before appointing Philippe P√©tain to the command. After the dismissal of Joffre and the appointment of Robert Nivelle in 1916, Castelnau retired from active service. He was later sent on the Allied Mission to Russia in the early months of 1917, just prior to the Fall of the Tsar. When Nivelle was dismissed and replaced by Philippe P√©tain, Castelnau was recalled to the command of the Eastern Army Group where he commanded the advance into Lorraine in 1918. Three of Castelnau's sons were killed in the war. Recognizing the hopelessness of modern trench warfare, he once remarked: \\"Ah, Napoleon, Napoleon. If he were here now, he'd have thought of something else.\\"Robert B. Holtman, The Napoleonic Revolution (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1967), 36. =Post WW1= After the war he entered politics. In 1919 he was elected to parliament as a deputy of Bloc National for Aveyron. In 1924 he founded the F√©d√©ration Nationale Catholique, which advanced a socio-religious model of France that has been described as \\"National Catholicism\\". In the same year Castelnau wrote an anti-Masonry pamphlet titled \\"La dictature de la ma√ßonnerie en France\\" (The Dictatorship of the Masonry in France); he further publicized his accusations in a series of articles in Echo de Paris. Although his Catholic Federation reached one million members in 1925, its significance was short-lived and it subsided into obscurity by 1930.

Although many old Jomaligins (its people) doesn't know or couldn't remember where Jomalig derived its name, there are few old residents who still remember the wonderful legend from their ancestors. Based on the story, there was a Datu who lived in island and had a beautiful daughter. A young man from a neighboring island wanted to marry the princess but Datu didn't agree with it. The Datu said that he will only give his daughter if the young man can roam the island in just one day and successfully shoot three fishes in every pond on the island. The young man took the Datu's challenge. After he roamed the island, he almost finished the marathon, but in the end, failed to do so because he nearly died. He arrived at the finish line hopelessly and at this point, he requested the princess to kiss him as the only reward he could receive. The people in island witnessed what happened she kissed the young man and they shouted: \\"humalik\\" (They kissed). From that time on, the people on the island named the island \\"Humalik\\". Many years passed and the Humalik become Jomalig. Many old residents say that the Americans changed it when they conquered the Philippines. Due to the geographical location of Jomalig, the district found it difficult to be recognized and established which further contributed to its slow development. It was only in the year 1952 when Jomalig, Quezon was subdivided for agricultural and residential lots sponsored by Mayor Mamerto P. Azarias and the Municipal Council. Only through the inauguration by then Congressman Manuel S. Enverga did the civic leaders geared towards self-reliance. It instigated them towards development in agriculture and with this, many people from the Bicol Region migrated for richer pastures and an uplifted livelihood. Jomalig Island was a former barrio of Polillo, but on January 22, 1961, with the enactment of Republic Act. No. 3372, Jomalig Island was separated from the municipal district of Polillo, Quezon.

The terrain generally ranges from above sea level with rugged mountain areas. Coastal areas deviate from plain to hilly terrains. Rivers, streams and springs abound throughout the municipality, but the most prominent is the Talolong River. It is bordered by the municipalities of Catanauan and General Luna on the south, Macalelon on the south-west, Calauag on the north-east, Gumaca on the west, Buenavista and Guinayangan on the east. Barangays Lopez is politically subdivided into 95 barangays, 7 of which are urban and 88 are rural. Climate History There was a flourishing coastal settlement somewhere in the southern part of the municipality of Gumaca called Talolong. The settlement's name was derived from the name of the river that traverses the place. The original location of the settlement was in the marshy mouth of a sedate river, which was founded by the descendants of Datu Dumangsil and Datu Balinsusa of the Kalilayan kingdom. Due to the frequent plundering and terrorism of the pirates, the colony was transferred to the present town's location. The settlement of Lakan Bugtali who founded the community of Gumaca was gone. Even a trace of its remains cannot be identified neither the vintages of the encomienda of Kalilayan nor a fraction of its 16th century glories. When it became a sitio through a papal bull, the village started to manage by her own. In 1756, some people from the town of Mayoboc (present-day Pitogo) sought refuge in the sitio as they fled the Moro raid that burned the town to the ground. After sometime, some of them become discontented with the affairs of governing the sitio, went back to the original site of Mayoboc and again formed a settlement on an uphill portion, more suitable to guard against the Moro pirates. It later came to be known as Pitogo. As the sitio became more organized and seen an increase in population, it formally became a full pledged town, separated from Gumaca, on June 30, 1857, during the Governorship of Alcalde Mayor Don Candido Lopez y Diaz. It later came to be known as the town of Lopez. Demographics Settlement areas in the municipality are highly scattered; population concentration is noticeable only within the poblacion, that is, the urban barangays of Burgos, Danlagan, Gomez, Magsaysay, Rizal, San Lorenzo Ruiz (Bocboc) and Talolong as well as the rural barangays of Mal-ay, Sugod, Pansol, Calantipayan, Manguisian, Del Pilar, Bebito, Canda Ibaba and Canda Ilaya which are traversed by the national highway. The rest of rural barangays are reached by other road networks which are accessible during dry and wet season. According to the 2007 census, it had a population of 86,660, a quarter of which are in the urban areas and the rest are in the rural areas. Males outnumbered the females at a ratio of 105.34 to 100.

This place is situated on the Bondoc Peninsula; its geographical coordinates are 13¬∞ 31‚Ä≤ 20‚Ä≥ North, 122¬∞ 24‚Ä≤ 15‚Ä≥ East, and its original name was Malunay. Mulanay is about south-east from Lucena City. The town proper, with her plain landscape, is a coastal town facing the Tayabas Bay. The municipality is being considered to be listed in the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Site inscription due to its architectural marvels, notably its baroque church, its preserved ancestral houses, and the Limestone tombs of Kamhantik, a highly-significant Tagalog archaeological site and dambana, in the Buenavista Protected Landscape.

Lunay is the vernacular term for Pili wax, which was abundant in the area. History The findings of the conducted archaeological exploration and excavation at Mt. Kamhantik Archaeological Site by the team from the National Museum headed by Dr. Eusebio Z. Dizon, Scientist III and a world renown archaeologist says Mulanay was inhabited by an organized community in the year 500AD-1300AD, who were our ancestors belonging to the Austronesian speaking people and originated from Taiwan (Peter Belwood). Austronesian people or Austronesian- speaking people are various populations found in Asia, Oceania and Africa that speak languages of the Austronesian family. These include Taiwanese aborigines; the majority ethnic groups of Malaysia, East Timor, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Madagascar, Micronesia, and Polynesia, as well as the Polynesian people of New Zealand and Hawaii, and the non-Papuan people of Melanesia. The Austronesian language is a language family that is widely dispersed throughout Maritime Southeast Asia, Madagascar and the islands of the Pacific Ocean, with a few members on continental Asia. Austronesian languages are spoken by about 386 million people, making it the fifth-largest language family by number of speakers. The result of the C-14 (carbon dating) on teeth found in burial No.5 at the Mt Kamhantik Archaeological Site was dated in the year 890AD or 1,220 years old (radio carbon dating result for sample IV2011F657AB, BETA ANALYTIC INC. MIAMI, FLORIDA, USA). The recent archaeological investigation on July 15‚Äì30, 2015 found a surface archaeological artifact, stone tool. And according to Dr. Eusebio Z. Dizon, Scientist III, it was a tool from the Neolithic period 10,000 BC-2,000 BC used for carving , cutting and sharpening. Other artifacts found were potteries with incised designs which were similar to the early Huynh-Kalanay Potteries of Taiwan and Vietnam from the period of 1000 BCE and 200 CE. Some were also present in the different areas in the Philippines like Sarangani, Cagayan, Isabela, Nueva Ecija, Bicol, Masbate and many others dating to 1000BC-300AD. Ceramics shreds from the Sung Dynasty (960AD-1279AD) were are also found in the area. These archaeological findings were evidences showing the participation of our ancestors from Mt. Kamhantik to a trade network in 500AD-1300AD.http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/313462/tomb- raiders-spoil-philippine-archaeological-find The evangelization of Mulanay by the Franciscan Missionaries was in 1600 while its civil foundation as a municipality was effected in 1745 through the approval of the King of Spain. During the Spanish regime, Mulanay was composed of the municipal territories of San Narciso, San Francisco, Catanauan and San Andres which was as big as the province of Bataan. In 1755, Catanauan became a separate municipality followed by other remaining municipalities. Mulanay‚Äôs territorial jurisdiction was reduced to 42,000 hectares. The original town of Mulanay composed of six (6) barangays was raided by the Moro pirates that led the town‚Äôs executive together with the barangay heads to transfer the town site to the so called Mayordomo, a sitio of Barangay Latangan. After several years, raids along coastal areas were lessened. The people returned to the town site, however, few barangay heads disagreed and left for Bantuin, Marinduque and Mindoro. The populace of Mulanay is composed of different ethnic groups like Tagalogs, Visayas and Bicolanos. Based on the Philippine Statistics Authority Census Calendar Year 2010, it has a population of 50,826. The first town head of Mulanay during the Spanish Regime was Alcalde Mayor Eustaquio Manlangit, while the first town mayor during the American Occupation was Mayor Atanacio Ojeda. The municipality had been under twenty seven mayors from Spanish Regime up to present. The incumbent mayor is Joselito A. Ojeda. At present, Mulanay is composed of twenty eight (28) barangays, four of which comprise the poblacion. The municipality is an agricultural town where farm crops like coconut, garlic, bananas, rice, corn, peanuts, mongo, ginger, squash, and other vegetables are abundantly harvested. Mulanay lies along the coast of Tayabas Bay, an abundant fishing ground.http://mulanay.webs.com/ Local government Town Hall and ML Quezon Monument Elected officials 2013‚Äì2016: * Mayor: Joselito Aguirre Ojeda * Vice Mayor: Ponciano Rejano * Councilors: ** Jay Castilleja ** Isidro M.

Historical records show that this site was selected by the town‚Äôs founders in 1766 because its lofty elevation provided them with good look out points for the marauding vintas of Muslim pirates who were then threatening the safety of the natives. In 1754, a band of Christian settlers led by Juan Mauricio founded the town farther inland, a few miles up the Mayubok River, (now Pinagbayanan), to be safe from Moro depredations. But despite this precaution, the Moros came and raided the town. They came along the coastal town of Kalilayan (Tayabas). Two years later, in 1756, Alejo Bautista became the next ruler. Again, the Moros remembering the place, visited Mayubok, burned the settlement and killed many of its inhabitants. Due to so much fright, the people placed the biggest church bell in a banca but the banca capsized at Aasnan. Expert divers tried to recover the historic bell but their toil remained futile and all in vain. The survivors built another settlement in 1760 along the banks of Cawayanin River under Bernabe Rafael. Likewise, this community was destroyed by the Moros. St. Paul (the patron saint) was lost. He was found in a nearby barrio. The people stayed for a short time in the said barrio naming it ‚ÄúAdia‚Äù meaning safety. In 1766, Buenaventura Salvador selected a well-located hill, the Maaliw Hill where few fishing huts could be found. The place was chosen because from its summit, where a native watchtower (Castillo) could be found, the approaching Moro Vintas could easily be detected while still afar. The founding of Pitogo became very sure when a strong ruler in the person of Geronimo Santiago took care of the poblacion. He was known as Maniago whom the pirates feared so much. He ruled for almost ten years from 1771 to 1780. During that time the patron saint became famous too. The belief was that St. Paul was protecting miraculously the new town. On one occasion, when the Moros were about to enter the town, the place became all darkness and so the Moros had not other recourse but to go away. 1781 came and Juan Encarnacion became the ruler. According to legend, this was the time when St. Paul the Apostle was found under a big Pitogo tree on the promontory of Maaliw Hill. Taking this as a good omen and believing that St. Paul liked the place to be the permanent location of the poblacion, the people named the place after this palm tree known as ‚ÄúPitogo‚Äù and began to settle here. This name later applied to this whole town as the community grew. Another Mauricio became the ruler in 1814. The town was burned for the first time due to the carelessness of the inhabitants. A very good ruler in the person of Geronimo de los Angeles came in 1817. During his time the stone church was built on the same place where St. Paul was once found on Maaliw Hill. For two centuries, Pitogo had survived Muslim raids, epidemic conflagrations and two major wars to emerge as a thriving, pulsating community that has seen some progress during the past decades.

It was occupied by Muslims in the 8th century and was not finally incorporated into the kingdom of Castile until 1340. Records about the town date back to the 13th century, when Alfonso X overran Utrera as part of his conquest of Seville, located 30 km to the northwest. However, archaeological work shows people have lived on the site since pre-Roman times. Today the town's five chapels, dating from the 14th to 18th centuries, churches and 14th century castle are popular tourist attractions for visitors to Andalusia. Utrera is considered the cradle of the fighting bull and the flamenco, and there are many cattle farms in its municipal district. The area is known for numerous festivities, particularly the fair, which is celebrated during the days before and after the day of Utrera's patron saint: the Virgin of Consolaci√≥n. This fiesta attracts many people from all over Andalusia and Spain as a whole. Utrera is also known for the mostach√≥n, a kind of small flattened cake made with sugar and cinnamon. Climate Utrera's climate is characterized by the annual alternation between a dry period, which lasts more than four months and has high temperatures, and a humid season in autumn and winter with mild temperatures. The monthly distribution of rain corresponds to the one typical of the Mediterranean climate; the rainy season takes place during the autumn and the winter. During summer the absence of rain prevails, except for very occasional summer storms. About 40% of rainfall occurs during the autumn. The average annual temperature is 17.5 ¬∞C. The average absolute maximum temperature is 41.9 ¬∞C. The coldest month is January and the average absolute minimum temperature is 0.8 ¬∞C. Sunny days with cloudless skies are predominant year round. Leisure Time and Festivities * Procession of the Three Wise Men on 5 January. The Three Kings and characters from tales and movies are depicted on floats, from which sweets and trinkets are thrown to the children. On this day it is very typical to eat a cake called \\"rosc√≥n de Reyes\\", which comes with a little gift inside. * Carnival, celebrated at the end of February. There is a contest organized by city hall featuring elaborate dresses, and prizes are awarded to those judged the winners. * Andalusia Day & 'Bicycle day on 28 February. Andalusia Day commemorates the day when Andalusia's Statute of Autonomy was approved. Bicycle Day, in which groups of people ride around the city on bicycles, is celebrated the same day. There are raffles and performances after the ride. * Holy Week (Semana Santa). The different brotherhoods of Utrera walk through the city carrying images of Jesus Christ, the Virgin, and scenes of Christ's Passion in procession from the churches. These are followed by musical bands and \\"nazarenos\\", i.e., people doing penance and giving thanks for special events in their lives. It is similar to Seville's Holy Week. * Tapas Fair, celebrated in March since 2000. Various tapas from all over Spain are prepared and served; these are sold at a low price and usually consumed with beer. * National Painting Contest \\"City of Utrera\\" in May * The crowning of the Virgin of Consolaci√≥n on 1 May. The Virgin of Consolaci√≥n is Utrera's patron saint. Many people from different parts of Andalusia make a pilgrimage to this sanctuary to pray for the saint's intercession or give thanks for events such as a recovery from illness. * Pilgrimage of the Virgin of F√°tima around 13 May * Corpus Christi, May or June * Feast of St. John' on 24 June. Figures and caricatures representing stand out events and celebrities of the year are burned as part of a very old tradition imported from other parts of Spain. * Gypsy Stew on the last Saturday of June, a flamenco festival * Castle's auditorium: July and August, with programmed cinema, theatre, music and dance showings and performances * Consolaci√≥n Fair around 8 September. The Utrera Fair is well attended, attracting attendees from other localities in the province of Seville and Andalusia. Very similar to the Seville Fair, but less crowded, it and Holy Week are the most notable annual events in the city. Many people go dressed in typical Sevillanas and flamenco costumes. In the afternoon, the people usually have a typical Andalusian meal for lunch. Afterwards many of them ride horses in organized Sevillanas contests. At night various kinds of music are performed, while people drink and dance until dawn. * Activities at the \\"Casa de Cultura\\" (House of Culture) from October until June. * Municipal Theatre \\"Enrique de la Cuadra\\", season from October until June.

He was the son of Saint Sigrada and the brother of Saint Warinus. Leodegar was an opponent of Ebroin, the Frankish Mayor of the Palace of Neustria and the leader of the faction of Austrasian nobles in the struggle for hegemony over the waning Merovingian dynasty. His torture and death made him a martyr and saint. Early life Leodegar was the son of a high-ranking Burgundian nobleman, Bodilon, Count of Poitiers and Paris and Sigrada of Alsace, who later became a nun at Sainte-Marie de Soissons. His brother was Warinus. He spent his childhood in Paris at the court of Clotaire II, King of the Franks and was educated at the palace school. When he was older he was sent to Poitiers, where there was a long-established cathedral school, to study under his maternal uncle, Desiderius (Dido), Bishop of Poitiers. At the age of 20 his uncle made him an archdeacon. Shortly afterwards he became a priest, and in 650, with the bishop's permission, became a monk at the monastery of St Maxentius in Poitou.Now Saint-Maixent-l'√âcole, in the r√©gion Poitou-Charentes He was soon elected abbot, and initiated reforms including the introduction of the Benedictine rule. Career Around 656, about the time of the usurpation of Grimoald in Austrasia and the banishment of the boy- heir Dagobert II, Leodegar was called to the Neustrian court by the widowed Queen Bathilde to assist in the government of the united kingdoms and in the education of her children. Then in 659 he was named to the see of Autun, in Burgundy. He again undertook the work of reform and held a council at Autun in 661. The council denounced Manichaeism and was the first to adopt the Trinitarian Athanasian Creed. He made reforms among the secular clergy and in the religious communities, and had three baptisteries erected in the city. The church of Saint-Nazaire was enlarged and embellished, and a refuge established for the indigent. Leodegar also caused the public buildings to be repaired and the old Roman walls of Autun to be restored.MacErlean, Andrew. \\"St. Leodegar.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 23 October 2017 His authority at Autun placed him as a leader among the Franco- Burgundian nobles. Meanwhile, in 660 the Austrasian nobles demanded a king, and young prince Childeric II was sent to them through the influence of Ebroin, the mayor of the palace in Neustria. The queen withdrew, from a court that was Ebroin's in all but name, to an abbey she had founded at Chelles, near Paris. On the death of King Clotaire III in 673, a dynastic struggle ensued, with rival claimants as pawns; Ebroin raised Theoderic to the throne, but Leodegar and the other bishops supported the claims of his elder brother Childeric II, who, by the help of the Austrasians and Burgundians, was eventually made king. Ebroin was interned at Luxeuil and Theoderic sent to St. Denis. Leodegar remained at court, guiding the young king. In 673 or 675, however, Leodegar was also sent to Luxeuil. The cause, a protest against the marriage of Childeric and his first cousin, is a hagiographic convention; as a leader of the Austrasian and Burgundian nobles, Leodegar was easily represented as a danger by his enemies. When Childeric II was murdered at Bondi in 675, by a disaffected Frank, Theoderic III was installed as king in Neustria, making Leudesius his mayor. Ebroin took advantage of the chaos to make his escape from Luxeuil and hasten to the court. In a short time Ebroin caused Leudesius to be murdered and became mayor once again, still Leodegar's implacable enemy. The martyrdom of St. Leger About 675 the Duke of Champagne, the Bishop of Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne and the Bishop of Valence, stirred up by Ebroin, attacked Autun, and Leodegar fell into their hands. At Ebroin's instigation, Leodegar's eyes were gouged out and the sockets cauterized, and his tongue was cut out. Some years later Ebroin persuaded the king that Childeric had been assassinated at the instigation of Leodegar. The bishop was seized again, and, after a mock trial, was degraded and condemned to further exile, at F√©camp, in Normandy. Near Sarcing he was led out into a forest on Ebroin's order and beheaded. A dubious testament drawn up at the time of the council of Autun has been preserved as well as the Acts of the council. A letter which he caused to be sent to his mother after his mutilation is likewise extant. In 782, his relics were translated from the site of his death, Sarcing in Artois, to the site of his earliest hagiography ‚Äì the Abbey of St Maxentius (Saint-Maixent) near Poitiers. Later they were removed to Rennes and thence to Ebreuil, which place took the name of Saint-L√©ger in his honour. Some relics are still kept in the cathedral of Autun and the Grand S√©minaire of Soissons. In 1458 Cardinal Rolin caused his feast day to be observed as a holy day of obligation. For sources to his biography, there are two early (though not contemporaneous) Lives,Passio Leudegarii I & II. The second one is much more embellished than the first. drawn from the same lost source (Krusch 1891), and also two later ones (one of them in verse). Cultural significance Historically there was a custom among wealthy British merchants to sell in May, spend the summer outside of London, then to return on St Leger's Day. This gave rise to the saying used in regards to financial trading markets, \\"Sell in May and go away, and come on back on St. Leger's Day\\".

Max McCoy, the author of this book, also wrote three of the other Indiana Jones books for Bantam. Published on April 1, 1995, it is preceded by Indiana Jones and the White Witch and followed by Indiana Jones and the Dinosaur Eggs. Plot introduction Indiana Jones hunts down an English alchemist, a Renaissance scholar and a stolen manuscript containing the great alchemical secrets of immortality and transmuting base metals to gold. The book was published only in paperback by Bantam Books of New York City in April 1995. Plot summary The novel begins with Indiana Jones descending down a hillside towards the lost city of Coz√°n, in the rain forests of Central America. After deciphering the clues in the pyramid, he discovers the Crystal Skull of Coz√°n and retrieves it, only for the artifact to be snatched away by the main antagonist, Leonardo Sarducci. Sarducci tells Indiana Jones his plan to achieve immortality and orders his partner, Marco, to kill the archeologist. A giant snake eats Marco and Indiana Jones escapes from the temple and returns to a village with his guide, who accompanied him in the expedition. Jones returns to Princeton University where Marcus informs him of the stolen Voynich Manuscript. Government men visit Jones and try to recruit him into helping them find the mysterious manuscript, but Jones declines. It is revealed that the men said to Jones's superiors about his expedition in Central America being illegal, and Jones is inevitably fired and sanctioned from his job as professor. After searching for a place to sleep, Jones then comes across a bookstore owner who claims to be an enthusiast in alchemist history. He reveals to Jones that the fascists visited him too in search for the manuscript, and that they are also searching for the Philosopher's Stone, an artifact that can turn any metal to gold. Jones contacts the US Government and hurriedly catches up to the USS Macon, dangling from a rope attached to the airship. He foils assassination attempts by Italians onboard. Jones arrives in England for Alistair Dunstin, but instead finds his sister, Alecia. Jones eventually ends up in Alecia's apartment. Just then, the Fascists arrive and make an attempt on the pair's life. Indy and Alecia escape and the archaeologist learns that Alecia is the last of a dying race of secret metal workers and has a tattoo on her back which is said to hold the key to deciphering the Voynich Manuscript. He is also informed about the history of the stone and that Alistair and Alecia have successfully transmutated substance into gold. She tells him that a prima material is needed to fuel the stone and that there isn't much time if they want to find Alistair alive. The Fascists catch up and, after a daring shootout in the back alleys of London, the two escape with their lives and new found feelings for each other. Alecia books a garbage freighter for passage to Italy, in hopes that Alistair is there. When Indy joins her, Sarducci appears once again to kill them both. After dumping the load of garbage into the ocean with Indy and Alecia inside, the pair makes their way to one of the flying boats that is part of the Italian air armada AKA The Atlantici that is allowing Sarducci to travel around the globe so fast. The pair make it to Italy where they encounter Sarducci in his office and ask where Alistair is being held. Because Alecia bares a strong resemblance to his deceased wife, Sarducci releases them and accidentally gives them a clue which leads them to Libya where they meet with Sallah. In the middle of the Libyan desert, on the border to Egypt, the trio meets Prince Farqhuar who leads his rebel army to battle with the \\"roman pigs\\". Indy sneaks into the secret Italian base and finds Alistair. The pair sneak out only to be caught when Alistair reveals he was working with the Italians all along. Sarducci plans to excecute Indy via firing squad but Prince Farqhuar saves him at the last minute. They survive a sandstorm and Indy decodes the map on Alecia's back. They arrive at the hiding place of the Philosopher's Stone and Indy and Alistair swim down to retrieve it. Sarducci arrives and takes the group prisoner, stows them in a van and his servant and he open the mechanism and activate the Stone. The stone melts his assistant after they touch it and soon Sarducci finds himself melting too. Alistair, in a last ditch effort, gives his life by jumping into the oasis with the stone. Indy emerges to find Alistair gone with the stone. Indy, Sallah, Alecia and Farqhuar head back to civilization. Jones goes back home and finds out that the Crystal Skull had been stolen.

In recent years, Spanish cinema has achieved high marks of recognition. In the long history of Spanish cinema, the great filmmaker Luis Bu√±uel was the first to achieve universal recognition, followed by Pedro Almod√≥var in the 1980s. Spanish cinema has also seen international success over the years with films by directors like Segundo de Chom√≥n, Flori√°n Rey, Luis Garc√≠a Berlanga, Juan Antonio Bardem, Carlos Saura, Julio M√©dem and Alejandro Amen√°bar. Woody Allen, upon receiving the prestigious Prince of Asturias Award in 2002 in Oviedo remarked: \\"when I left New York, the most exciting film in the city at the time was Spanish, Pedro Almod√≥var's one. I hope that Europeans will continue to lead the way in film making because at the moment not much is coming from the United States.\\" Non-directors, like the cinematographer N√©stor Almendros, the art director Gil Parrondo, the screenwriter Rafael Azcona, the actresses Maribel Verd√∫ and, especially, Pen√©lope Cruz and the actors Fernando Rey, Francisco Rabal, Antonio Banderas, Javier Bardem and Fernando Fern√°n G√≥mez, have obtained significant recognition outside Spain. Only a small portion of box office sales in Spain are generated by domestic films. The Spanish government has therefore implemented measures aimed at supporting local film production and movie theaters, which include the assurance of funding from the main national television stations. The trend is being reversed with productions such as the ‚Ç¨30 million film Alatriste (starring Viggo Mortensen), the Academy Award-winning Spanish film Pan's Labyrinth (starring Maribel Verd√∫), Volver (starring Pen√©lope Cruz and Carmen Maura), and Los Borgia (starring Paz Vega), all of them sold-out blockbusters in Spain. Another aspect of Spanish cinema mostly unknown to the general public is the appearance of English-language Spanish films such as Agora (directed by Alejandro Amen√°bar and starring Rachel Weisz), Ch√© (directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring Benicio del Toro), The Machinist (starring Christian Bale), The Others (starring Nicole Kidman), Milo≈° Forman‚Äôs Goya's Ghosts (starring Javier Bardem and Natalie Portman), A Monster Calls (directed by J. A. Bayona and starring Sigourney Weaver and Liam Neeson), and The Impossible (starring Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts). All of these films were produced by Spanish firms. Origins Segundo de Chom√≥n The first Spanish film exhibition took place on May 5, 1895, in Barcelona. Exhibitions of Lumi√®re films were screened in Madrid, Malaga and Barcelona in May and December of 1896, respectively. The matter of which Spanish film came first is in doubt.\\"Salida de misa de doce del Pilar de Zaragoza\\" : la fraudulenta creaci√≥n de un mito franquista The first was either Salida de la misa de doce de la Iglesia del Pilar de Zaragoza (Exit of the Twelve O'Clock Mass from the Church of El Pilar of Zaragoza) by Eduardo Jimeno Peromarta, Plaza del puerto en Barcelona (Plaza of the Port of Barcelona) by Alexandre Promio or the anonymous film Llegada de un tren de Teruel a Segorbe (Arrival of a Train from Teruel in Segorbe). It is also possible that the first film was Ri√±a en un caf√© (Brawl in a Caf√©) by the prolific filmmaker Fructu√≥s Gelabert. These films were all released in 1897. The first Spanish film director to achieve great success internationally was Segundo de Chom√≥n, who worked in France and Italy but made several famous fantasy films in Spain, such as El Hotel el√©ctrico. The height of silent cinema In 1914, Barcelona was the center of the nation's film industry. The espa√±oladas (historical epics of Spain) predominated until the 1960s. Prominent among these were the films of Flori√°n Rey, starring Imperio Argentina, and the first version of Nobleza Baturra (1925). Historical dramas such as Vida de Crist√≥bal Col√≥n y su Descubrimiento de Am√©rica (The Life of Christopher Columbus and His Discovery of America) (1917), by the French director Gerald Bourgeois, adaptations of newspaper serials such as Los misterios de Barcelona (The Mysteries of Barcelona) starring Joan Maria Codina (1916), and of stage plays such as Don Juan Tenorio (1922), by Ricardo de Ba√±os, and zarzuelas (comedic operettas), were also produced. Even the Nobel Prize-winning playwright Jacinto Benavente, who said that \\"in film they pay me the scraps,\\" would shoot film versions of his theatrical works. In 1928, Ernesto Gim√©nez Caballero and Luis Bu√±uel founded the first cine-club (film society), in Madrid. By that point, Madrid was already the primary center of the industry; 44 of the 58 films released up until that point had been produced there. The rural drama La aldea maldita (The Cursed Village) (Florian Rey, 1929) was a hit in Paris, where, at the same time, Bu√±uel and Dal√≠ premiered Un chien andalou (An Andalusian Dog). Un chien andalou has become one of the most well-known avant-garde films of that era. The crisis of sound Sara Montiel By 1931, the introduction of audiophonic foreign productions had hurt the Spanish film industry to the point where only a single title was released that year. In 1935, Manuel Casanova founded the Compa√±√≠a Industrial Film Espa√±ola S.A. (Spanish Industrial Film Company Inc, Cifesa) and introduced sound to Spanish film-making. CIFESA would grow to become the biggest production company to ever exist in Spain. Sometimes criticized as an instrument of the right wing, it nevertheless supported young filmmakers such as Luis Bu√±uel and his pseudo-documentary Las Hurdes: Tierra Sin Pan (Breadless Land). In 1933 it was responsible for filming 17 motion pictures and in 1934, 21. The most notable success was Benito Perojo¬¥s La verbena de la paloma (The Dove's Verbena).They were also responsible for the 1947 Don Quijote de la Mancha, the most elaborate version of the Cervantes classic up to that time. By 1935 production had risen to 37 films. The Civil War and its aftermath Carmen Sevilla The Civil War devastated the silent film era: only 10% of all silent films made before 1936 survived the war. Films were also destroyed for their celluloid content and made into goods.Pavlovi, p. 1 Around 1936, both sides of the Civil War began to use cinema as a means of propaganda and censorship. A typical example of this is Luis Bu√±uel's Espa√±a 1936, which also contains much rare newsreel footage. The pro-Franco side founded the National Department of Cinematography, causing many actors to go into exile. The new regime then began to impose obligatory dubbing to highlight directors such as Ignacio F. Iquino, Rafael Gil (Huella de luz (1941)), Juan de Ordu√±a (Locura de amor (1948)), Antonio Rom√°n (Los √∫ltimos de Filipinas (1945)), Jos√© Luis S√°enz de Heredia (Raza (1942)), and Edgar Neville. Cifesa produced Ella, √©l y sus millones (1944) as well as Fedra (1956), by Manuel Mur Oti. For its part, Marcelino pan y vino (1955) from Ladislao Vajda would trigger a trend of child actors, such as those who would become the protagonists of \\"Joselito,\\" \\"Marisol,\\" \\"Roc√≠o Durcal\\" or \\"Pili y Mili.\\" In 1951, the regime instituted the Ministerio de Informaci√≥n y Turismo (Ministery of the propaganda and tourism) to safeguard and develop the Spanish brand, the social imagery and the public image under the slogan \\"Spain is different\\" which was launched in the 1920s and then internationally spreaded in the 1960s. Its main purpose was to promote the Spanish turistic industry and a massive inflow of people who came from all the Europe towards the Andalusia, looking for what they saw in the Spanish films: sun and sea, comfortable transports and hotels, good ethnic cousine, passion and adventure, and the socalled espa√±oladas (bulls, castanets, flamenco, Gypsi's culture and folklore). . Also mirrored on researchgate.net. Niebla y sol (1951) and Bienvenido M√≠ster Marshall (1953) were the first movies belonging to the new genre of the \\"touristic cinema\\". Juan de Ordu√±a would later have an enormous commercial hit with El √öltimo Cupl√© (1957), with leading actress Sara Montiel. It was followeb by Veraneo en Espa√±a (Miguel Iglesias, 1958) and by Espa√±a otra vez (1969). =Social criticism= In the 1950s, the influence of neorealism became evident in the works of a number of rather young film directors (namely, Manuel Mur Oti, Jos√© Antonio Nieves Conde, Juan Antonio Bardem, Marco Ferreri, and Luis Garc√≠a Berlanga). Their main works (Surcos, Balarrasa, Todos somos necesarios, Orgullo, Muerte de un ciclista, Calle mayor, El pisito, El cochecito, Bienvenido Mister Marshall, or Pl√°cido) ranged from melodrama to esperpento or black comedy, but all of them showed a strong social criticism, unexpected under a political censorship, like the one featured by Franco\`s regime. From the amorality and selfishness of the upper middle class or the ridiculousness and mediocrity of the small town people to the hopelessness of the impoverished working class, every social stratum of the contemporary Spain was shown up. Luis Bu√±uel in turn returned to Spain to film the shocking Viridiana (1961) and Tristana (1970). Co-productions and foreign productions Maribel Verd√∫ International Film Festival of Valladolid. Numerous co-productions with France and, most of all, Italy along the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s invigorated Spanish cinema both industrially and artistically. Actually the just mentioned Bu√±uel's movies were co- productions: Viridiana (1961) was Spanish-Mexican, and Tristana (1970) Spanish-French-Italian. Also, the hundreds of Spaghetti-westerns and sword and sandal films shot in southern Spain by mixed Spanish-Italian teams were co- productions. On the other hand, several American epic-scale superproductions or blockbusters were shot also in Spain, produced either by Samuel Bronston, King of Kings (1961), El Cid (1961), 55 Days at Peking (1963), The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964), Circus World (1964)), or by others (Alexander the Great (1956), The Pride and the Passion (1957), Solomon and Sheba (1959), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Doctor Zhivago (1965), The Trojan Women (1971)). These movies employed many Spanish technical professionals, and as a byproduct caused that some filmstars, like Ava Gardner and Orson Welles lived in Spain for years. Actually Welles, with Mr. Arkadin (1955), in fact a French-Spanish- Swiss co-production, was one of the first American filmmakers to devise Spain as location for his shootings, and he did it again for Chimes at Midnight (1966), this time a Spanish-Swiss co-production. Many international actors played in Spanish films: Italians Vittorio de Sica, Vittorio Gassman and Rossano Brazzi with Mexican Mar√≠a F√©lix in La corona negra; Italian couple Raf Vallone and Elena Varzi in Los ojos dejan huellas, Mexican Arturo de C√≥rdova in Los peces rojos, Americans Betsy Blair in Calle mayor; Edmund Gwenn in Calabuch or Richard Basehart in Los jueves, milagro among many others. All the foreign actors were dubbed into Spanish. Mexican actor Gael Garc√≠a Bernal has also recently received international notoriety in films by Spanish directors. The new Spanish cinema Pen√©lope Cruz with Volver director Pedro Almod√≥var at the 31st Goya Awards in 2017 Spanish actress Paz Vega at the 2019 Goya Award's In 1962, Jos√© Mar√≠a Garc√≠a Escudero became the Director General of Cinema, propelling forward state efforts and the Escuela Oficial de Cine (Official Cinema School), from which emerged the majority of new directors, generally from the political left and those opposed to the Franco government. Among these were Mario Camus, Miguel Picazo, Francisco Regueiro, Manuel Summers, and, above all, Carlos Saura. Apart from this line of directors, Fernando Fern√°n G√≥mez made the classic El extra√±o viaje (The Strange Trip) (1964) and V√≠ctor Erice created the internationally acclaimed El esp√≠ritu de la colmena (The Spirit of the Beehive) (1973). From television came Jaime de Armi√±an, author of Mi querida se√±orita (My Dear Lady) (1971). From the so- called Escuela de Barcelona, originally more experimentalist and cosmopolitan, come Jacinto Esteva, Pere Portabella, Joaquin Jordan, Vicente Aranda, Jaime Camino, and Gonzalo Su√°rez, who made their master works in the 1980s. In the Basque country the directors Fernando Larruquert, Nestor Basterretxea, Jos√© Mar√≠a Zabalza and the producer El√≠as Querejeta stood out. The San Sebastian International Film Festival is a major film festival supervised by the FIAPF. It was started in 1953, and it takes place in San Sebasti√°n every year. Alfred Hitchcock, Audrey Hepburn, Steven Spielberg, Gregory Peck, Elizabeth Taylor are some of the stars that have participated in this festival, the most important in Spain and one of the best cinema festivals in the world. The Festival de Cine de Sitges, now known as the Festival Internacional de Cinema de Catalunya (International Film Festival of Catalonia), was started in 1967. It is considered one of the best cinematographic contests in Europe, and is the best in the specialty of science fiction film. The cinema of the democratic era Antonio Banderas in 2010. With the end of dictatorship, censorship was greatly loosened and cultural works were permitted in other languages spoken in Spain besides Spanish, resulting in the founding of the Centro Galego de Artes da Imaxe - Filmoteca de Galicia or the Catalan Institute of Cinema, among others. At the beginning, the popular phenomena of striptease and landismo (from Alfredo Landa) triumph. During the democracy, a whole new series of directors base their films either on controversial topics or on revising the country's history. Jaime Ch√°varri, V√≠ctor Erice, Jos√© Luis Garci, Manuel Guti√©rrez Arag√≥n, Eloy de la Iglesia, Pilar Mir√≥ and Pedro Olea were some of these who directed great films. Montxo Armend√°riz or Juanma Bajo Ulloa's \\"new Basque cinema\\" has also been outstanding; another prominent Basque director is Julio M√©dem. The Spanish cinema, however, depends on the great hits of the so-called Madrile√±o comedy by Fernando Colomo or Fernando Trueba, the sophisticated melodramas by Pedro Almod√≥var, Alex de la Iglesia and Santiago Segura's black humour or Alejandro Amen√°bar's works, in such a manner that, according to producer Jos√© Antonio F√©lez, \\"50% of total box office revenues comes from five titles, and between 8 and 10 films give 80% of the total\\" during the year 2004. { cellpadding=\\"1\\" style=\\"float:center; text- align:center; border:1px solid #88a; background:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font- size: 95%; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em; width:80%\\" - !

They were established in 1987, a year after the founding of the Academia de las Artes y las Ciencias Cinematogr√°ficas de Espa√±a, and recognize excellence in many aspects of Spanish motion picture making such as acting, directing and screenwriting. The first ceremony took place on March 16, 1987 at the Teatro Lope de Vega, Madrid. The ceremony continues to take place annually around the end of January, and awards are given to films produced during the previous year. The award itself is a small bronze bust of Francisco de Goya created by the sculptor Jos√© Luis Fern√°ndez. In 2013, Premios Feroz were established as the Spanish counterpart of the Golden Globe Awards. There are several International Film Festivals in Spain with important prizes for the industry. Two of them are the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival and the Sitges Film Festival. English-language Spanish films English- language films produced by Spanish companies include Two Much (directed by Fernando Trueba, 1995), The Others (Alejandro Amen√°bar, 2001), The Machinist (Brad Anderson, 2004), Basic Instinct 2 (produced by KanZaman Spain, 2006) or Milo≈° Forman‚Äôs Goya's Ghosts (Xuxa Produciones, 2006), The Impossible (directed by Juan Antonio Bayona, 2012, Apaches Entertainment and Telecinco Produciones). KanZaman (Spain) and Recorded Picture Company (UK) co-produced Sexy Beast, directed by Jonathan Glazer, in 1999. Films co-produced by this company include The Reckoning (Paul McGuigan, 2003), The Bridge of San Luis Rey, based on the Pulitzer prize winning Thornton Wilder novel of the same name and directed by Mary McGuckian. It featured an ensemble cast consisting of Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Kathy Bates and Spanish actress Pilar L√≥pez de Ayala. Other films in this category are Mike Barker's A Good Woman (2004), and Sahara (Breck Eisner, 2005). In 2004, KanZaman co-produced Ridley Scott's epic film Kingdom of Heaven, making it the biggest production in the history of Spanish cinema.

Early life and education Blackwell was born in East Orange, New Jersey to Henry Browne Blackwell and Lucy Stone, both of whom were suffrage leaders and helped establish the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). She was also the niece of Elizabeth Blackwell, America's first female physician. Her mother introduced Susan B. Anthony to the women's rights movement and was the first woman to earn a college degree in Massachusetts, the first to keep her maiden name after getting married, and the first to speak about women's rights full-time. Blackwell was educated at the Harris Grammar School in Dorchester, the Chauncy School in Boston and Abbot Academy in Andover. She attended Boston University, where she was president of her class, and graduated in 1881, at age 24. She belonged to Phi Beta Kappa Society.  Career  Blackwell is well known for her work towards women's rights. At first resisting the cause of her mother and father, she later became a prominent reformer. After graduating from Boston University, Alice began working for the Woman's Journal, the paper started by her parents. By 1884, her name was alongside her parents on the paper's masthead. After her mother's death in 1893, Alice assumed almost sole editing responsibility of the paper. Susan B. Anthony and Alice Stone Blackwell signed NAWSA check, written by the group's treasurer Harriet Taylor Upton. In 1890, she helped reconcile the American Woman Suffrage Association and National Woman Suffrage Association, two competing organizations in the women's suffrage movement, into the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). The movement had become split in 1869 over disputes over the degree to which women's suffrage should be tied to African-American male suffrage. This split created the AWSA, which her parents helped organize, and the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA), headed by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. From 1890 to 1908, Alice Stone Blackwell was NAWSA's recording secretary and in 1909 and 1910 one of the national auditors. She was prominent in Woman's Christian Temperance Union activities. In 1903, she reorganized the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom in Boston. She was also president of the New England and Massachusetts Woman Suffrage associations and honorary president of the Massachusetts League of Women Voters. In later life, Blackwell went blind.Women Win the Vote: Who Were They? 75 Suffragists Profiled She died March 15, 1950 at the age of ninety-two.

File:Alice Stone Blackwell.jpgAlice Stone Blackwell  Humanitarianism  Alice Stone Blackwell was also involved in humanitarian acts outside of the United States. In the 1890s, she traveled to Armenia, where she became passionately involved in the Armenian refugee community. She sold some of her possessions, particularly the oriental rugs from her house on Pope's Hill in Dorchester, to benefit the Armenians and feed their children, and she also provided assistance to adults looking for jobs. This is also when she discovered her interest in international literature. She translated many of the country's works into English in Armenian Poems (1896). She would continue translating literature into English, including works of Hungarian, Yiddish, Mexican, French, Italian, and Russian poetry.

Uyuni primarily serves as a gateway for tourists visiting the world's largest salt flats, the nearby Uyuni salt flat. Each year the city receives approximately 60,000 visitors from around the globe. The city also acts as a gateway for commerce and traffic crossing into and out of Bolivia from and to Chile, and there is a customs and immigration post downtown. Agriculture in the area is generally limited to quinoa, llamas, and sheep. Founded in 1890 as a trading post, the city has a population of 29,672 (2012 official census). The town has an extensive street- market. It lies at the edge of an extensive plain at an elevation of above sea level, with more mountainous country to the east. Transport It is an important transport hub, being the location of a major railway junction. Four lines join here, respectively from La Paz (via Oruro), Calama (in Chile), Potos√≠, and Villaz√≥n (on the Argentine border, where the line now ends). Uyuni is connected by road to Oruro - La Paz, Sucre, Villaz√≥n (border with Argentina) and Ollag√ºe, Chile. The city is also served by the Joya Andina Airport. Currently, two local airlines are flying regularly to the city from La Paz, Sucre and Rurrenabaque: Amazonas and Transporte A√©reo Militar. Tourist attractions =Train cemetery= One of the major tourist attractions of the area is an antique train cemetery. It is located 3 km outside Uyuni and is connected to it by the old train tracks. The town served in the past as a distribution hub for the trains carrying minerals on their way to the Pacific Ocean ports. The train lines were built by British engineers who arrived near the end of the 19th century and formed a sizable community in Uyuni. The engineers were invited by British-sponsored Antofagasta and Bolivia Railway Companies, which is now Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia. The rail construction started in 1888 and ended in 1892. It was encouraged by the then Bolivian President Aniceto Arce, who believed Bolivia would flourish with a good transport system, but it was also constantly sabotaged by the local indigenous people who saw it as an intrusion into their lives. The trains were mostly used by the mining companies. In the 1940s, the mining industry collapsed, partly due to the mineral depletion. Many trains were abandoned thereby producing the train cemetery. There are talks to build a museum out of the cemetery. Images Image:Locomotora, Av. Feeroviaria Uyuni.jpgAv. Ferroviaria, Uyuni. Image:Uyuni, Avenia Ferroviaria.jpgAv. Ferroviaria, Uyuni.

He used to work in development at eBay, Quigo, Inc and Move.com. In November 2010, he left his position as a \\"site reliability engineer\\" at Google Inc., purportedly after leaking news of a $1,000 holiday cash bonus to employees.  Early life  Wigginton was a student at Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose, California, interested in computers just as the earliest microprocessor-based computers were being assembled by hobbyists. Around the age of 14, he had heard about the Homebrew Computer Club, but had no way to get there until he started getting rides with another club member, Steve Wozniak, who lived down the street from Wigginton's family home. The two became friends, and Wigginton became one of Apple's earliest employees in 1976, and was present with Wozniak when the Apple I was first presented to the world at a Club meeting.  Career  Wigginton collaborated with Wozniak on the circuit design and ROM software for the Apple II in 1977. As Wozniak wired up color graphics circuitry, Wigginton wrote machine language graphics subroutines, and Chris Espinosa, another high school student, wrote demo programs in BASIC. Wigginton wrote several early programs for the Apple II, including a checkbook-balancing program co-authored with Apple's vice-president of Marketing Mike Markkula. Wigginton was one of the Apple employees who adapted Microsoft's 6502 BASIC for the Apple II; it was dubbed Applesoft BASIC. The Applesoft BASIC Reference Manual includes a section entitled \\"Rounding can be Curious\\", in which it is documented that the ROUND function, which rounds a number to a prescribed accuracy, is not monotonic: in other words, for some x and y, such that x ROUND(y). (The problematic ROUND function does not appear in Applesoft II, the version that most Apple II users are familiar with.) Perhaps his most critical early contribution was the RWTS (read/write track-sector) routines for the Disk II, the 5\\" floppy disk controller introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) show in early 1978. Wigginton and Wozniak wrote the final version of the software in Wozniak's hotel room on the eve of the show. In 1979, Apple President Mike Scott asked Wozniak to write a secret competitor to VisiCalc, to use as leverage against Personal Software. Wozniak was reluctant because he was unsure whether creating a rival spreadsheet software would be copyright infringement, so Scott ordered Wigginton to do so. With help from Wozniak and Gull Banks, Wigginton developed The Spreadsheet, codenamed \\"Mystery House\\". He later claimed that it \\"became the most incredibly intense political football you can imagine ... the product was completed and had manuals when Apple decided not to sell it\\". Call-A.P.P.L.E. in 1982 briefly distributed it before Apple withdrew permission, making The Spreadsheet a cult classic because of the rarity and Wozniak's involvement. Wozniak wrote the math routines as they could be used for other software, Banks wrote disk routines, and Wigginton wrote most of the code. Wigginton was a member of the original Apple Macintosh design team. Wigginton left Apple in September 1981 and formed Encore to work on his own. However, he was quickly contracted by Apple to help work on MacWrite on a semi-formal basis. When the Macintosh shipped in 1984 he again turned to his own projects, starting a new spreadsheet program that would eventually be released as Full Impact. Following his career at Apple, Wigginton worked as an engineer at companies including eBay, Google, Chegg, and Square, Inc., among others.

He is remembered as a pioneer of the Protestant faith in Eastern Europe, a champion of Renaissance humanism, and a founder of academic life in Moldavia. Active within the Greek diaspora in several countries, he was a student of Hermodorus Lestarchus, and worked as a scribe alongside his cousin, Iakobos Diassorinos. Heraclid forged his genealogy several times, claiming to be a member of the Brankoviƒá dynasty; he was more reliably related to the Byzantine nobility in Rhodes, and claimed the titular lordship of Samos. In the late 1540s and early '50s, he studied medicine at the University of Montpellier, and married a local. A duelist and alleged infanticide, Heraclid fled over the border with the Holy Roman Empire before he could be executed for murder. He was slowly won over by the Reformation, serving the Protestant princes of the Upper Saxon Circle. During his travels in the Habsburg Netherlands, Heraclid was admitted to the court of Emperor Charles V, serving under him in the Last Italian War. He was made a Count Palatine and became a recognized authority on military matters, authoring several books in New Latin. Returning to civilian life, he focused his attention on missionary activity, and networked with the leading Lutherans in Wittenberg, though he began sympathizing more with Calvinism. With recommendations from Philip Melanchthon, he traveled through Northern Europe and had a spell teaching mathematics at the University of Rostock. He eventually reached Poland and Lithuania by way of Prussia, focusing on a project to unite the local Evangelical and Calvinist Churches. His own Calvinism wavered at the court of Miko≈Çaj \\"the Red\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç: Heraclid turned to Radical Reformation, and adopted a Unitarian position, without abjuring publicly. Networking between the Habsburg Monarchy and Polish nobility, \\"Despot\\" was able to credibly claim the throne of Moldavia. Involved in an unsuccessful plot to assassinate the titular Prince, Alexandru LƒÉpu»ôneanu, he returned with a mercenary army, winning at Verbia and taking Suceava. Upon gaining control of the country, he issued an edict of toleration, which favored the brief ascendancy of Moldavian Protestants. Heraclid never explicitly stated his own affiliation, appeasing the dominant Moldavian Orthodox Church and performing the duties of an Orthodox monarch. He also formulated a political program which announced Romanian nationalism, promising to conquer Wallachia and Transylvania; he saw himself as a vassal of the Holy Roman Empire, and made several attempts to capture parts of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom in conjunction with the Habsburgs. Proclaiming himself a \\"King\\" or \\"Palatine\\" rather than Prince, he invested efforts in a dynastic union with Wallachia, which he then briefly invaded. Despot's long-term goal was to obtain independence from the Ottoman Empire following a European-led \\"crusade\\". Several religious controversies contributed to social unrest in Moldavia. Despot's prohibition of divorce, his lapses into Protestant iconoclasm and his fiscal policies all served to alienate the public; this conflict was aggravated by his plan to marry a Calvinist, which opened the prospect of a Protestant dynasty. Weakened by Despot's disputes with Olbracht ≈Åaski and the Zaporozhian Cossacks, the regime was brought down by the pretender »òtefan Tom»ôa. After a months-long siege in Suceava, Despot surrendered and was immediately killed, probably by Tom»ôa's own hand. His Reformation project only survived through the small learning center he had set up at Cotnari, being dismantled in the 1580s. Despot's reign was cursed by the early Moldavian historians, but his overall contribution to Moldavia's Westernization, particularly cultural, is viewed by later scholars as meritorious. Despot reemerged as a favorite subject in modern Romanian literature, inspiring an 1879 drama by Vasile Alecsandri, and also appears in Maltese literature. Biography =Origins= It is certain that the future Prince of Moldavia was an ethnic Greek, but his exact origin is unclear. Despot was a noted forger, described by Romanian scholar Andrei Pippidi as an \\"ingenious charlatan\\" and \\"professional impostor\\".Pippidi (2000), pp. 181, 183 Historian Nicolae Iorga also mentions that Despot, an \\"unusual figure\\", claimed \\"rights to all princely thrones in existence.\\"Iorga (1925), p. 2 In his quest for recognition, he provided several conflicting accounts on his origins and early life, while also inventing a succession of conflicting genealogies. In separate and conflicting notices, he suggested that his place of birth was Rhodes or Samos, in the Ottoman Eyalet of the Archipelago; elsewhere, he also claimed Genoese Chios or Venetian Crete as his homeland.Pippidi (2000), pp. 179‚Äì181 At least one witness heard him say that he was originally from the Kingdom of Sicily.Pippidi (2000), p. 180 His family tree, published by Heraclid himself at Corona in 1558, claimed that he descended from Polycrates the Samian and the Brankoviƒá dynasty, rulers of the Serbian Despotate.Pippidi (2000), p. 181 In 1562, the French diplomat Antoine de Petronel recorded Heraclid as a claimant \\"Despot of Serbia\\".Kenneth Setton, The Papacy and the Levant, 1204‚Äì1571. Volume IV. The Sixteenth Century from Julius III to Pius V, pp. 833‚Äì834. Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1984. Later in life, Heraclid more explicitly pretended that he was a nephew of Moldavia's Stephen the Great,Giurescu, p. 64; PungƒÉ, p. 95; Theodorescu, p. 26 while adding that he descended from the House of Lusignan.Iorga (1898), p. 33 Pippidi identifies some reliable parts in Despot's genealogy, referring to his kinship with the Byzantine nobility of Rhodes and with potentates from the Duchy of Naxos‚Äîpossibly including Nicholas III dalle Carceri, mistakenly identified by Despot as \\"Alexios\\". Overall, Heraclid appears to have had a strong connection with Hospitaller Malta, with Maltese sources generally referring to him as Basilicus Melitensis or Basilico Maltese (\\"Basilicus the Maltese\\"). Giovanni Francesco Abela and Giuseppe Buonfiglio record his name under the Italian version, Basilic√≤; Pippidi reconstructs this as Jacob Basilicos.Pippidi (2000), pp. 179‚Äì182 Another New Latin source names him as Iacobus Vasilico di Marcheto.Jurcoi, p. 53; Pippidi (2000), p. 182 One account in the Maltese series suggests that Heraclid was born at Birkirkara, and, according to Pippidi, this should be regarded as certain.Pippidi (2000), pp. 177, 182 The Maltese origin is nuanced by Buonfiglio: he recounts that Basilic√≤ was a Maltese Greek who claimed Rhodian descent. Based on this clue, Pippidi proposes that the Heraclides family had escaped to Malta during the taking of Rhodes, with the future Despot VodƒÉ being born in exile in 1527.Pippidi (2000), pp. 179‚Äì180, 182 The future Prince's symbolic affiliation with Rhodes is also verified by other details: in 1548, he presented himself as belonging to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rhodes.Pippidi (2000), p. 182 Pippidi argues that he only came to depict himself as owner of Samos because, \\"unlike Rhodes or Malta, it was available, having been deserted by its inhabitants\\". One note from Despot's papers may indicate that he was the great-grandson of Caloiani Vasilico, who served the Byzantine Empire as a diplomat, shortly before the Fall of Constantinople, while also involving himself in trade with Moldavia.Pippidi (2000), pp. 181‚Äì182 The latter tradition was perhaps continued by Despot's father, John Heraclides. Scholar Aleksander Kraushar once hypothesized that Despot was not in fact a son of John, but rather of shipowner Basilikos, who had helped John escape; in this reading, the Heraclides clan adopted Iacob upon Basilikos' death. According to historian Marie Kesterska Sergescu, \\"Kraushar's information stands to be corrected\\" by Iorga's later discoveries.Kesterska Sergescu, p. 260 Iacob himself circulated two accounts of John's life and death, claiming that he had been decapitated by the Ottomans, or alternatively by Moldavia's Prince »òtefƒÉni»õƒÉ. The latter variant is viewed as more plausible by Pippidi, who notes that Despot named H√¢rlƒÉu as his father's place of death, and intended to consecrate a church on that spot. According to some readings of sources, John had another son, Demetrios, who would later play a role in Despot's Moldavian career.Neagoe, p. 197 Other authors describe the same Demetrios as an unrelated SerbCrƒÉciun, pp. 134‚Äì135; Gon»õa, p. 252; PungƒÉ, p. 97 or Greek.Iorga (1898), p. 34 Historian Matei Cazacu identifies him with Dimitrije Ljubaviƒá, a deacon and pioneer typographer who was primarily active in Wallachia. According to this author, the two men were companions and blood brothers, rather than siblings.Cazacu, p. 67 An enemy of Despot, Ferenc Forg√°ch, counted two Basilic√≤ brothers, one of whom was a burglar; the other lived in Venetian Cyprus. Despot's family is known to have included a Greek scribe, Iakobos Diassorinos, who was Heraclid's cousin and political partner; an uncle, Constantine, had fallen prisoner to the Ottomans during the siege of Coron.Pippidi (2000), pp. 180‚Äì181 =Scribe, student, fugitive= Title page of De Marini quod Terovanum vocant in Christophe Plantin's French edition, 1555. Heraclid is credited as \\"Jacques Basilic Marchet\\" A passing mention by poet-chronicler Christian Schesaeus suggests that Despot's first language of instruction was \\"Argolic\\" Greek, and that his earliest travels took him to Italy.Diaconescu, pp. 169, 176; Jurcoi, p. 50 In adulthood, he could speak as many as six languages, which may or may not have included \\"Vlach\\".Jurcoi, pp. 51‚Äì52 Several accounts of the period suggest that he was educated in Chios by Hermodorus Lestarchus, who introduced him to Renaissance humanism.CrƒÉciun, pp. 100, 130; Jurcoi, pp. 49‚Äì51 In his record of oral history, the 18th-century author Ion Neculce alleges that Heraclid became a servant of the Brankoviƒáes, with whom he \\"was not relatives\\". He claims that Despot passed himself as Jovan Brankoviƒá's nephew when it could obtain him a share of the family's inheritance, and also alleges that he stole and forged Brankoviƒá's personal papers.Neculce, pp. 14‚Äì15 This story would place young Heraclid in the Republic of Venice or the Papal States.Jurcoi, p. 50; Neculce, p. 15 Antonio Maria Graziani, a diplomat of the Holy See, additionally argues that Heraclid had spent time as a copyist in the Vatican Library, though he may be confusing him with Diassorinos.Jurcoi, pp. 50‚Äì51 Iorga draws a slightly different conclusion: noting that both Despot and Diassorinos were scribes and calligraphers, he argues that they only worked for the Bibliotheca Regia in Vienna.Jurcoi, p. 51 Iorga proposes that Heraclid also spent some of his formative years in Habsburg Spain. According to scholar Eugen Denize, the hypothesis is unverified, but plausible‚Äîgiven Despot's familiarity with Spanish politics.Denize (1996), p. 53 He was later spotted in the Kingdom of France, meeting and befriending Justus Jonas, who probably introduced him to Reformation ideology.CrƒÉciun, p. 262; Jurcoi, p. 54 In 1548, he enlisted at the University of Montpellier, where he trained as a physician.Denize (1996), p. 53; Jurcoi, pp. 52‚Äì54. See also Pippidi (2000), p. 182 A university colleague, Carolus Clusius, left notes regarding his encounters with Despot, whom he names as Jacques Marchetti. Clusius depicts Despot as a philanderer and duelist, who married Gilette d'Andr√©, widow of a former rival. He accuses the future Prince of infanticide: he had arranged for a wardrobe to fall on his adoptive child.Jurcoi, pp. 52‚Äì53. See also Iorga (1925), p. 2 \\"Marchetti\\" was forced to abscond from Languedoc and France, without completing his studies. Clusius implies that this was because of his criminal lifestyle, while Felix Plater, also a student at Montpellier, suggests that Despot had killed a canon for mocking Gilette.Jurcoi, pp. 52‚Äì54 Platter also recalls that Heraclid was tried in absentia, sentenced to death by crushing, and executed in effigy on September 28, 1554.Jurcoi, p. 54 There is no explicit mention of whether or not Heraclid was involved with the Huguenots. However, this religious component may explain why Heraclid hid in the Margraviate of Baden, sheltered there by the Protestant Philibert.CrƒÉciun, pp. 100‚Äì101 From Baden, Heraclid traveled to the Upper Saxon Circle of the Holy Roman Empire, in areas dominated by Lutheran Landeskirchen. He spent some ten months with the Counts of Mansfeld, meeting G√ºnther the Rich and Philip Melanchthon.CrƒÉciun, p. 101 Historians debate as to whether or not Heraclid joined G√ºnther on his travel to the Kingdom of England, but it is certain that he visited the Habsburg Netherlands. In 1553, at Brussels, Emperor Charles V recognized him as a military expert and took him into his own retinue. In the campaigns of 1554‚Äì1555, Heraclid saw action with the Reichsarmatur in the County of Flanders and at Th√©rouanne.Denize (1996), p. 53; Le Sergeant de Monnecove, passim He also made a decisive appearance in the battle of Renty. According to chronicler Jean-Fran√ßois Le Petit, \\"Ba≈øilic Marchet, Greek Gentleman & Captain\\" contributed to the counterattack which forced Henry II to withdraw his army.Jean-Fran√ßois Le Petit, La grande chronique ancienne et moderne, de Hollande, Z√©lande, WeÔ¨ÜFrise, Utrecht, Fri≈øe, Overy≈ø≈øel et Groeningen, ju≈øques √† la fin de l'An 1600. Livre VIII, p. 225. Dordrecht: Iacob Cardin, 1601 His competence was again recognized by Charles. On October 22, 1555,Denize (1996), p. 53; Gon»õa, p. 251 Heraclid was received into the lesser German nobility as a Count Palatine, with hereditary rights over Samos and Paros.CrƒÉciun, p. 101; Diaconescu, p. 176; Theodorescu, pp. 26, 28 Thereafter styling himself \\"Despot of Samos and Marquess of Paros\\",de Recoles, p. 125; Olteanu, p. 958 he was also entitled to a pension and military retinue at the emperor's expense.Jurcoi, pp. 54‚Äì55 His participation in the siege of Th√©rouanne inspired him to write a book in Latin (De Marini quod Terovanum vocant atque Hedini expugnatione), which he dedicated to the Emperor's son and main successor, Philip II.Denize (1996), p. 53. See also Le Sergeant de Monnecove, passim; Olteanu, pp. 956‚Äì957 This was later followed by Artis militaris liber primus (\\"The First Book on Military Art\\") and De arte militaria liber (\\"Book on the Military Art\\"). As argued by Denize, all three showed \\"a very good awareness of Spanish military art\\"; art historian RƒÉzvan Theodorescu makes remarks on their \\"Renaissance taste\\".Theodorescu, p. 27 Medievalist »òtefan Olteanu praises Heraclid's military competence and \\"genuine theoretical skills\\",Olteanu, pp. 955‚Äì956 while writer F√©lix Le Sergeant de Monnecove deems Despot (or \\"Jacques Basilic Marchet\\") the writer \\"too personal and partial to be viewed as a historian\\".Le Sergeant de Monnecove, p. 5 The first of these fascicles was published at Antwerp in 1555, and then the various parts were circulated as manuscripts which are \\"similar, but not identical\\".Olteanu, p. 957 =Soldier and missionary= Title page of De arte militari, by \\"Iacobus Basilicus Heraclides Despota\\", with John Christoporski's signature, attesting Heraclides' participation in the 1557 clashes with the Livonian Order By 1556, Heraclid was certainly a Protestant, settling in Wittenberg, capital of the eponymous duchy and the epicenter of Lutheranism. Here, he met Joachim Camerarius and Caspar Peucer, as well as, possibly, Pier Paolo Vergerio.CrƒÉciun, pp. 101‚Äì102, 107‚Äì108, 130 As noted by historian Maria CrƒÉciun, Heraclid was the first Greek man to contact German Lutherans, appearing to them as the \\"symbol of a future rapprochement between the Greek church of the East and Central Europe's German Protestantism.\\"CrƒÉciun, p. 119 According to Clusius, it was at Wittenberg that Despot first developed an interest for the affairs of Moldavia and Wallachia.CrƒÉciun, pp. 119‚Äì120 In mid 1556, Despot switched his attention to the Kingdom of Poland and Duchy of Prussia, involving himself in the affairs of the Polish Evangelical Church.CrƒÉciun, p. 102 With letters of recommendation from Melanchthon (which described Despot as an \\"honest and erudite man\\"), he crossed into Mecklenburg- Schwerin, teaching mathematics at the University of Rostock.CrƒÉciun, pp. 102‚Äì103 He may have also spent time in L√ºbeck and in the Danish realm, and in any case one of his letters from Melanchthon was addressed to Christian III.CrƒÉciun, pp. 102, 107 There are also clues that he visited the Kingdom of Sweden before finally sailing to K√∂nigsberg in Prussia, where he arrived in November 1556. At the Prussian court, Heraclid met statesman John Christoporski (Krzysztoforski), who took an interest in his contributions as a tactician and ordered copies from his tracts.Olteanu, pp. 957‚Äì958 Duke Albert also gave Heraclid a warm welcome, but the latter only spent some two months in Prussia, leaving upon obtaining a recommendation to the court of Chancellor Miko≈Çaj \\"the Red\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, in Lithuania.CrƒÉciun, p. 103 Despot also fought alongside Christoporski in the clashes of 1557, opposing Poland to the Livonian Order.Kesterska Sergescu, p. 261; Olteanu, pp. 957‚Äì961 From Vilnius, where he met other the major figures of Polish Protestantism‚Äîincluding Jan ≈Åaski‚Äî, Heraclid traveled to Lesser Poland Province, and made occasional returns to Prussia.CrƒÉciun, pp. 103‚Äì104 In late 1557, he was in Krakow, where he befriended scientist Georg Joachim Rheticus and a number of Protestant campaigners‚Äîincluding Hieronim Filipowski, Francesco Lismanini, Stanis≈Çaw Lutomirski, and Marcin Zborowski; his project, masterminded by ≈Åaski, was to reunite Evangelical and Calvinist Churches into a single Polish national church.CrƒÉciun, pp. 102, 104‚Äì105, 130 Beyond his generic Protestantism, Heraclid's own church affiliation is an enduring subject of dispute. The general viewpoints, summarized by Maria CrƒÉciun, are that he was either a Lutheran, a Calvinist, or an opportunist with no clear commitments; a number of authors also list him as one of the Unitarians or Polish Brethren, with some noting that he came to these positions only after going through more mainstream Protestantism.CrƒÉciun, pp. 105‚Äì106 CrƒÉciun believes that the most plausible account is provided by theologian Hans Petri. This theory describes young Heraclide as a moderate Lutheran, who embraced the dissident views of Andreas Osiander while in Prussia, and finally became a Calvinist in Krakow. CrƒÉciun suggests that Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç's influence pushed Despot into a final, Nontrinitarian stage, with influences from both Unitarianism and the Polish Brethren.CrƒÉciun, pp. 106‚Äì118, 124‚Äì126 Graziani reported on views allegedly held by Despot, commenting on his anticlericalism, his derision of all forms of mass, refusal to believe in transubstantiation, and dedication to Bible study.CrƒÉciun, pp. 115‚Äì118, 133 Various Catholic polemicists identified Heraclid as a \\"Jew\\" or \\"not a Christian\\".CrƒÉciun, p. 113 As CrƒÉciun notes, this allegation refers to his Unitarian views, which in the popular mind had been identified with Judaizing currents.CrƒÉciun, pp. 113‚Äì114 =Moldavian intrigue= Olbracht ≈Åaski's castle in Kesmark (Ke≈æmarok), where Despot planned his attack on Moldavia Despot's plan to take over as Prince of Moldavia by usurping Alexandru LƒÉpu»ôneanu was probably hatched at Vilnius: here, he met some Moldavian boyars who had escaped LƒÉpu»ôneanu's political persecutions.CrƒÉciun, p. 120; Diaconescu, p. 176 By 1558, he had also become aware that his genealogical claims made him a nominal relative of Princess- consort Ruxandra.CrƒÉciun, p. 120; Diaconescu, pp. 175, 176, 177; Iorga (1925), p. 2; Gon»õa, p. 251; Gorovei, p. 190 Historian »òerban Papacostea argues that Demetrios settled in Moldavia long before Despot, contributing to the spread of Reformation ideas in that country before being chased out by LƒÉpu»ôneanu's violent repression.CrƒÉciun, pp. 73, 135 Iacob himself arrived in Moldavia in 1558, already an adversary of the regime, probably with support from Poland (especially from Polish Calvinists) and from a coalition of boyars who had supported »òtefan VI Rare»ô.CrƒÉciun, pp. 74, 76, 81‚Äì83, 118‚Äì122 As noted by Olteanu, his plan was rendered realistic by the anarchic decline of political customs in both Danubian Principalities under the Ottoman dominion. In the very last decades of the Romanian Middle Ages, there were 21 Moldavian Princes, with each averaging \\"2 years of actual governance.\\"Olteanu, p. 955 Emperor Charles' other successor, Ferdinand I, was preoccupied with securing a Habsburg family realm in Central and Eastern Europe. His son Maximilian intended to stand in the Polish royal elections; he courted the Polish nobility, whose Protestant factions conditioned their support on Habsburg acceptance of Despot.CrƒÉciun, pp. 118‚Äì119 This overlapped with Heraclid's own political goals, prompting him to assure the Habsburg court of his loyalty. It is unclear if Ferdinand actually backed Despot during the late 1550s. Historian Ionel Bejenaru, who argues that they did, notes that LƒÉpu»ôneanu perceived Despot as an imperial agent, and that this pushed him to enter negotiations with Ferdinand.CrƒÉciun, pp. 81‚Äì83 Iorga describes Despot as a \\"useful diversion\\", which Ferdinand prepared for its perfect moment to deploy.Iorga (1898), p. 6 According to Iorga, Despot was a guest at LƒÉpu»ôneanu's court, charming his hosts with his accounts of Western Europe, and with his own genealogical fabrications, while omitting his criminal past. Probably just before the attempted Moldavian‚ÄìHabsburg rapprochement, Heraclid conspired to poison the Prince‚Äîa plot which also involved the Unitarian physician, Giorgio Biandrata, and the Orthodox Patriarch, Joasaph II.CrƒÉciun, pp. 82‚Äì83. See also Diaconescu, p. 177 The attempt was a failure, and Despot was forced to flee Moldavia; according to Iorga, this escape occurred as early as 1558, though CrƒÉciun calculates early 1560.CrƒÉciun, pp. 82‚Äì83. See also Olteanu, p. 960 Initially, he settled in the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom at the court of Dowager Queen Isabella Jagiellon. It was here that he first met a fellow adventurer, Olbracht ≈Åaski.Kesterska Sergescu, p. 261 In Iorga's account, this was also the time of Despot's stay in Corona, and subsequent move to Zips County, in the Habsburg parts of Hungary. He arrived at Kesmark, where he lodged in ≈Åaski's castle. On March 3, 1560, Despot made his formal pledge to the Habsburgs. As read by historian Gheorghe Gon»õa, this oath marked a \\"peak of Habsburg intrusions in Moldavia\\", and also signaled Despot's \\"complete openness toward the Occident\\".Gon»õa, pp. 251‚Äì252 By May, LƒÉpu»ôneanu had alienated more of his boyars and probably even the Moldavian Orthodox Metropolis: a delegation representing both traveled to Kesmark, hoping to persuade Ferdinand and Maximilian to intervene, and also expressing support for Despot's candidacy.CrƒÉciun, pp. 83, 86, 88, 120 Arranging a new expedition in Moldavia, planned for late 1560, Heraclid secured military backing from castellan ≈Åaski, who had an understanding with Habsburg loyalists.CƒÉzan, p. 114; Constantinov, p. 100; CrƒÉciun, pp. 73‚Äì74, 118‚Äì119; Iorga (1898), pp. 29‚Äì30 & (1925), p. 2; Kesterska Sergescu, pp. 261‚Äì264 Despot promised him ownership of Hotin Citadel, which guaranteed rights to the biggest octroi in all of Moldavia. After mortgaging his own estates, ≈Åaski also lent 10,000 ducats to the pretender.PungƒÉ, p. 98 Despot bought himself a garrison of Spanish arquebusiers. Led by a Captain Pierre Roussel (or Rossillio),Kesterska Sergescu, p. 263 these remained loyal to him to the last day of his rule.Denize (1996), pp. 53‚Äì54 Some 500 Polish Protestants came in as volunteers.Kesterska Sergescu, pp. 262‚Äì263 News of this reached Polish King Sigismund II Augustus, who, preferring to maintain LƒÉpu»ôneanu as his subservient ally, ordered this \\"mutiny\\" quashed. Despot's force was attacked by troops from the Ruthenian Voivodeship, and arrested by Miko≈Çaj Sieniawski before even reaching the Moldavian border.Iorga (1925), p. 2; Kesterska Sergescu, p. 263 During this backlash, Despot dulled his enemies' vigilance by staging his own death.Diaconescu, p. 176; Iorga (1925), p. 2; Kesterska Sergescu, p. 263 =Deposing LƒÉpu»ôneanu= Approximate route of Heraclid's invasion of Moldavia in 1561 The final expedition against LƒÉpu»ôneanu was probably supported from outside the country by Demetrios.CrƒÉciun, pp. 73, 135‚Äì136 Despot acquired an explicit Polish endorsement, and was probably also viewed favorably by the Sublime Porte,CrƒÉciun, p. 83 having reportedly spent some 20,000 Goldgulden on bribes.Berindei, p. 34 Crucial backing for Heraclid's bid came from Joseph Nasi, the Ottoman court Jew and titular Duke of Naxos, who was on his way to becoming \\"one of the most influential figures at the Porte\\".Constantin Rezachievici, \\"Evreii din »õƒÉrile rom√¢ne √Æn evul mediu\\", in Magazin Istoric, September 1995, p. 61 Abela and Buonfiglio both claim that Heraclid was a vassal of the Knights Hospitaller, having been propped up by Grand Master Jean Parisot de Valette. Pippidi believes that this act of fealty is not unlikely, but also notes that Heraclid may have paid similar homage to other European monarchs.Pippidi (2000), pp. 179‚Äì180 Historian Robert Mifsud Bonnici argues that Heraclid may have returned to Malta as a monarch, to meet with Valette. However, according to Pippidi, it is improbable that such an encounter ever took place.Pippidi (2000), p. 178 Despot now had a larger force‚Äîcomprising many Zaporozhian Cossacks, on one of their first-ever appearances in Moldavian history.Iorga (1898), pp. 11‚Äì12 ≈Åaski mobilized this multinational force with his Latin oratory, depicting them as a liberation force, and LƒÉpu»ôneanu as a tyrant.Kesterska Sergescu, pp. 263‚Äì266 On November 18 (Old Style: November 8), 1561, Despot's coalition defeated the Moldavian military forces in the Battle of Verbia, obtaining full control over much of the country.Constantinov, p. 100. See also de Recoles, p. 125; Diaconescu, pp. 169‚Äì170, 176, 177; Iorga (1925), p. 2; Olteanu, p. 960 In his biography of Heraclid, Johann Sommer noted that arquebus firepower won the day: \\"most of [the Moldavians] had never before even seen those handheld bombards, and so they and their horses could catch sound of them without the greatest distress.\\"Horst Fassel, Sorin Chi»õanu, \\"Boto»ôanii √Æn jurnalele de cƒÉlƒÉtorie germane\\", in Hierasus, Vol. I, 1979, p. 338 Despot was also favored by an act of betrayal: the Moldavian Mo»õoc, with his entire cavalry force, switched sides during the clashes.Diaconescu, pp. 170, 177 A secondary fight opposed Hungarians in Despot's service to LƒÉpu»ôneanu's contracted Janissaries. The latter barricaded themselves in the townhouses of Boto»ôani, but the Hungarians surprised them by leaping over fences, and decimated them.Eugenia Greceanu, Ansamblul urban medieval Boto»ôani. Boto»ôanii care s-au dus, p. 32. Ia»ôi: Casa EditorialƒÉ Demiurg, 2009. Despot and his men soon descended on the capital, Suceava, where Metropolitan Grigorie II de la Neam»õ and \\"all the populace\\" stepped out to greet him.Rezachievici (2007), pp. 335‚Äì336 LƒÉpu»ôneanu escaped from battle and took refuge in Silistra Eyalet, at Kilya; the Ottoman garrison of that town had him deported to Istanbul. The final pursuit took Despot to Hu»ôi, where he defeated another portion of the loyalist army,Diaconescu, p. 176 and finally to Vaslui. On December 2, he issued his edict of toleration toward all branches of Christianity, inviting Protestants who were persecuted elsewhere to join him in Moldavia.CrƒÉciun, pp. 122‚Äì123; Theodorescu, pp. 54, 74 Despot immediately canceled LƒÉpu»ôneanu's program of forced conversions to Orthodoxy and restored Protestant churches to their owners, being celebrated as a protector by the Hungarian, Saxon, and Armenian communities of Moldavia.CrƒÉciun, pp. 72, 84‚Äì85, 123‚Äì124; Holban, pp. 1160‚Äì1161 He personally appointed a bishop for the Saxon Lutheran Church, whose first task was to rebuild churches demolished by either Rare»ô or LƒÉpu»ôneanu.CrƒÉciun, pp. 123‚Äì125. See also Pippidi (1983), p. 154 Shortly after his takeover, Despot wrote Ferdinand to convince him never to back LƒÉpu»ôneanu, exposing the latter as an indiscriminate murderer and Orthodox fanatic, and dwelling on his impalement of seven Protestant missionaries.CrƒÉciun, p. 72 In other portions of the Vaslui edict, Despot hints at the origin of the Romanians, encouraging his boyars to live up to the Roman virtue of their ancestors.Iorga (1925), p. 3 He reassured locals that he was fundamentally anti-Ottoman, promising them that he would restore Moldavian rule in the Budjak, also announcing that he intended to annex Wallachia and then \\"Greece\\"‚Äîdescribed by some historians as a \\"Dacian\\" plan.Denize (1999), pp. 161‚Äì162; Diaconescu, p. 168; Gon»õa, p. 252; Kesterska Sergescu, p. 261; PungƒÉ, passim According to Iorga, there was a more discreet note to this program: though his proclamations described the Danube as a frontier, Despot's \\"grand apotheosis\\" was to be a restoration of the Byzantine Empire, with himself as \\"Emperor of all Eastern Christendom\\". =Transylvanian projects= John Sigismund Z√°polya paying homage to Suleiman the Magnificent in 1566. From a late 16th-century muraqqa In January‚ÄìFebruary 1562, the Prince became involved in the effort to absorb Eastern Hungary into Ferdinand's realm. He contributed to the deteriorating relations between the two camps by stating his own territorial claims in Transylvania, demanding the return of Ciceu and Cetatea de BaltƒÉ, and preparing a favorite of his to serve as Transylvania's puppet ruler.Diaconescu, p. 178; PungƒÉ, pp. 93, 95. See also CƒÉzan, p. 106; Iorga (1925), p. 2 In the Habsburg parts of Hungary, Zsigmond Thorda described Despot as a most reliable ally who, it was hoped, would counteract and help discipline the Eastern Hungarians.CƒÉzan, pp. 103‚Äì106 The Moldavian troops, Thorda reported, were fully loyal to, and financially supported by, the Habsburgs; however, they could not be used against Eastern Hungary, for fear of angering Despot's Ottoman overlords.CƒÉzan, p. 104 Diplomat Ferenc Zay was more enthusiastic about the project, arguing that Despot could incapacitate resistance by attacking in Partium while the Habsburgs took other regions.CƒÉzan, p. 105 After confronting both sides of the argument, on February 15 Ferdinand appointed Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq as his rapporteur on the Moldavian matter. On the Eastern Hungarian side, G√°bor Majl√°th began gathering troops in preparation for Despot's expected intervention.CƒÉzan, p. 106 Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent finally recognized Despot as his vassal on April 24, with a ceremony outside Suceava. The affair was not without some tensions: Kapucu Ferhat, who presented Despot with his \\"regnal banner\\", received from him a bribe of some 15,000 ducats and 100 horses; however, Ferhat still complained to the Sultan that the ceremony had been held indoors, which went against customary law.Rezachievici (2007), pp. 22‚Äì23 As noted by Iorga, Despot was embarrassed by the ceremony, and in his correspondence pretended that the \\"banner\\" signified an Ottoman order of chivalry, rather than a label of submission. Before May 1562, Suleiman, as overlord of both Moldavia and Eastern Hungary, ordered Despot and John Sigismund Z√°polya to settle their differences. The monarchs complied, with Despot concealing his Habsburg sympathies and addressing letters of friendship to Z√°polya. Heraclid maintained his objectives and, as early as June 1562, sent letters to Sz√©kely Land, encouraging its secession and union with Moldavia; his mercenary friend, Anton Sz√©kely, was entrusted with the planning of a revolt.PungƒÉ, pp. 93, 95 Chronicler Nicolae Costin claims that, once informed that Z√°polya had been incapacitated by illness, Despot marched his 700-strong army toward the Transylvanian border; news of Z√°polya's recovery arrested his advance, somewhere on the Trotu»ô River.PungƒÉ, p. 95 He eventually backed out of his invasion plan, sending the boyar OrƒÉ»ô to negotiate a peace between Z√°polya and the Sz√©kelys. However, he gave a free hand to another one of his mercenaries, Paul Sz√©kely, to act as a seemingly independent warlord of Sz√©kely Land; this scenario was prevented by Z√°polya, who resumed control of the areas before autumn.PungƒÉ, pp. 95‚Äì96 Around that time, Despot began sending envoys, including his confidant Pierre Roussel, to the courts of Western Europe, requesting support for an anti-Ottoman crusade.CrƒÉciun, p. 119; Denize (1996), p. 54 He also defied the Crimean Khanate, reducing the Moldavian annual tribute to a gift consisting of two honey barrels, and made a public show of his contempt for Ottoman merchants.Berindei, pp. 42, 43 Despot had fathered an illegitimate son by \\"a Greek woman\\",CrƒÉciun, p. 143 or, according to other readings, had an infant daughter.Fodor, pp. 13‚Äì14 He also wanted to have a more conventional line of succession. During the first half of 1562, he planned his marriage to Princess Dobra, sister of Peter the Younger, Prince of Wallachia. For this he approached Peter's mother, Doamna Chiajna. His envoys were Mo»õoc and Avram Banilovschi.Neagoe, pp. 196‚Äì197; PungƒÉ, p. 97; Stoicescu, pp. 292, 317 These two arranged for the dynastic union to take place in August, and brought back a diamond ring as Peter and Chiajna's gift for Heraclid. Later, Wallachia's Vornic Radu Socol traveled to Suceava, bringing Despot two steeds, a kuka hat with precious stones, and 24,000 ducats.Neagoe, pp. 196‚Äì197 Heraclid intended to make his wedding a grand ceremony. His \\"extravagant parvenu's idea\\"Pippidi (2000), p. 179 involved sending out invitations to the leading royal houses of Europe. Among the projected guests were Philip II, Duke Albert, and Hungarian Archbishop Nicolaus Olahus.Pippidi (2000), p. 179; PungƒÉ, p. 97. See also Denize (1996), p. 54 The wedding was eventually called off, prompting a swift deterioration in relations between Wallachia and Moldavia. Historians disagree on the reasons for this breakdown in negotiations. Claudiu Neagoe believes that Chiajna was probably informed that Despot intended to depose Peter and bring his own alleged brother, Demetrios, on that throne. CƒÉtƒÉlin PungƒÉ notes that Demetrios was not supported by Heraclid; he argues that the Wallachians no longer saw Despot as a viable choice.PungƒÉ, pp. 96‚Äì97.

Also in 1562, the Venetians captured and executed Diassorinos, who was instigating a Cypriote revolt and had asked for Maltese and Ottoman assistance‚ÄîDespot probably intended to make Cyprus an Ottoman client state.Pippidi (2000), pp. 180‚Äì181.

[...] Despot was depicted as a determining factor for the spread of Protestantism in the east\\".CrƒÉciun, p. 118 Already in December 1561, Despot had extended an invitation to Filipowski, Lismanini, and other Polish colleagues, urging them to visit Moldavia.CrƒÉciun, pp. 117, 120, 130 Soon after, the regime introduced new laws and customs, including an effective ban on divorces.CrƒÉciun, pp. 110, 117‚Äì118, 125‚Äì128, 142; Diaconescu, pp. 170, 177 This policy was also reflected in the theology of a Protestant preacher, Jan Lusinski, who arrived in Moldavia as bishop of the local Calvinists; Lusinski and his German colleague, Johann Sommer, evolved from Calvinism or Lutheranism to a Unitarian approach, which they also imposed on their congregation.CrƒÉciun, pp. 110‚Äì111, 124‚Äì128, 130‚Äì131 Heraclid made repeated attempts to establish Moldavia as an educational center of Eastern European Reformation, inviting Lestarchus, Jonas, Rheticus, and Peucer to come and teach there.CrƒÉciun, pp. 129‚Äì131 Sommer was director of Despot's collegium (or \\"academy\\"), set up at Cotnari. This establishment was designed to train a generation of Protestant preachers, and possibly also the administrative elites.CrƒÉciun, pp. 128‚Äì129 Demetrios also made his return to Moldavia, probably in January 1562, interrupting his wider mission to spread Protestantism in the Balkans. He set up base at Cotnari, where he taught Greek.CrƒÉciun, pp. 136‚Äì137 As CrƒÉciun notes, it remains a matter of scholarly debate whether Cotnari should be viewed as Moldavia's first institution of higher learning, a local replica of the Platonic Academy, or a mere school.CrƒÉciun, p. 128 As Sommer himself explained, Despot offered state scholarships to Moldavia's youth. Historians disagree on whether this meant that the regime was consciously drawing them away from Orthodoxy, or simply indifferent to their beliefs.CrƒÉciun, pp. 128‚Äì129, 146 The princely court and government apparatus included Logothete Luca Stroici, who had probably embraced Lutheranism.CrƒÉciun, pp. 194, 203 However, various researchers agree that Despot never made an effort to mass- convert the Orthodox population. Overall, he allowed Reformation ideas to appear in the mainstream, giving Moldavians a chance to come into direct contact with them, and hoping that they would convert on their own.CrƒÉciun, pp. 120‚Äì121, 128‚Äì133, 145‚Äì146, 200‚Äì203 Polish reports and his own letters attest that he had pledged himself to make Moldavia Protestant, but also show that he never delivered on that promise.CrƒÉciun, pp. 121‚Äì122, 124, 145‚Äì146, 201‚Äì203; Kesterska Sergescu, p. 261 One point of the program which was consistently pursued by Despot was the repression of Moldavian Catholicism: his transfer of Catholic property into Lutheran hands was recorded by Giovanni Botero and Jan Dymitr Solikowski.CrƒÉciun, pp. 124, 201 Despot was still probably on friendly terms with Grigorie II, though the lesser clergy slowly came to resent both of them.CrƒÉciun, pp. 86, 131‚Äì132 As shown by the contemporary Chronicle of Azarie, Moldavians understood him to be \\"of the same creed as his advisers\\", namely a \\"Lutheran\\" and \\"God's scourge\\".CrƒÉciun, p. 99 The Orthodox Nicolae Costin took a dim view of Despot's stance on divorces, concluding that it made him an \\"awful, unrepentant tyrant\\".CrƒÉciun, p. 127 Despot angered his subjects when he began confiscating reliquaries, rizas and chalices, melting them for bullion.Magda Jianu, \\"Un valoros document de istoriografie rom√¢neascƒÉ veche\\", in Hierasus, Vol. I, 1979, p. 377Constantinov, p. 101; CrƒÉciun, pp. 131‚Äì133, 141, 144, 146; Diaconescu, pp. 170‚Äì171, 177 This remained his one documented attack on Orthodox institutions: primarily patrimonial in nature, it also reflected Despot's intention to simplify religious practice.CrƒÉciun, pp. 131‚Äì134, 140‚Äì141, 146; Diaconescu, pp. 170‚Äì171, 177 In Orthodox and Catholic historiography, the confiscations were also regarded as proof of Despot's Protestant iconoclasm.CrƒÉciun, pp. 133, 140‚Äì141, 201 Heraclid was aware of the mounting hostility. He survived several assassination attempts, masterminded by LƒÉpu»ôneanu: in April 1562, he had Hussar Voina impaled for such an attempt in the city of Roman; in 1563, there were two other documented strikes, occurring during his military maneuvers.Holban, pp. 1155‚Äì1159 His clampdown on dissent included the killing of Andreica, a former Stolnic, whom he regarded as a serious competitor for the throne.Holban, pp. 1158‚Äì1159; Stoicescu, p. 291 His lynching was staged by the Hungarian garrison of Suceava on Saint George Day 1562, and applauded by a handpicked civilian audience.Holban, pp. 1158‚Äì1161 Administrative letters show that, during early 1562, the Prince and ≈Åaski had imprisoned some seven grand boyars, effectively purging his Boyar Council; later documents suggest that they were killed in custody.Holban, p. 1156‚Äì1159 However, Despot still kept his Protestant faith secret, or not immediately apparent, performing the actions of an Orthodox monarch‚Äîincluding taking part in the EpiphanyCrƒÉciun, pp. 111‚Äì113, 140, 186 and bowing to kiss the Gospel.Holban, p. 1156 In March 1562, he restored to Humor Monastery the estate of Feredeni, which he had confiscated from Andreica.Holban, p. 1159.

His veto effectively took Moldavia out of the project to establish a Protestant presence in Eastern Europe at large.CrƒÉciun, pp. 112‚Äì113, 137‚Äì139 CrƒÉciun proposes that this episode reflects, on one hand, Despot's attempt to placate his Orthodox subjects and, on the other, his growing and genuine dislike of the Magisterial Reformation.CrƒÉciun, pp. 112‚Äì113 =\\"King\\" and Polish vassal= In October 1562, Heraclid invaded Wallachia and routed the Wallachian army sent to repel him. He was styling himself \\"palatine of Wallachia\\", probably hinting that he wanted to incorporate both territories into the Holy Roman Empire, with himself as the intermediate vassal.PungƒÉ, pp. 96‚Äì97 He now also intended to place a \\"son of Basarab\\" on the Wallachian throne, as a puppet ruler; historians agree that this is a reference to Banul MƒÉrƒÉcineRezachievici (1998), p. 55 or Nicolaus Bassaraba,Iorga (1898), p. 35; Neagoe, p. 197; PungƒÉ, p. 97 two exiled Craiove»ôti. Despot made a public show of his supposedly precognitive dream, in which three angels brought him three crowns,PungƒÉ, p. 97 or, in the version provided by the 17th-century chronicler Miron Costin, \\"two gilded crowns [fell] from the skies for him to take\\". Despot actually owned two such crowns, which, according to Papacostea, stood for the Upper and Lower Countries of Moldavia; they were later lost.»òerban Papacostea, \\"La √Ænceputurile statului moldovenesc. Considera»õii pe marginea unui izvor necunoscut\\", in Studii »ôi Materiale de Istorie Medie, Vol. VI, 1973, p. 48 In June 1562, Despot accused the mercenary Jean Villey of having stolen all his regalia.Holban, p. 1159 In tandem, Z√°polya made efforts to convince the Porte that Heraclid was a Habsburg loyalist who conspired with Emperor Ferdinand, noting that \\"this Despot has manned the forts with Germans and Hungarians\\", and that \\"all bandits from Transylvania and Poland gathered under him\\". The solution, Z√°polya argued, could only be LƒÉpu»ôneanu's return to his throne.CƒÉzan, p. 107 During this exchange of information, the Porte discovered that its Hungarian correspondence had been copied and read by Ferdinand's regents, which sparked a brief diplomatic crisis, at the end of which Suleiman insisted that Ferdinand remove his mercenaries from Moldavia.CƒÉzan, pp. 107‚Äì109 Ferdinand complied, and Despot was only left with 800 non-German mercenaries, most of them Hungarian.Diaconescu, pp. 173, 178 Faced with Z√°polya's intrigues and Chiajna's complaints, Despot also withdrew his troops from Wallachia. Nevertheless, the itinerant jurist Simon Wirt recorded a rumor that Despot (referred to as Desparity) had persuaded Suleiman the Magnificent to arrest LƒÉpu»ôneanu and make him a galley slave.Pippidi (2000), pp. 182‚Äì183 On January 6, 1563, Despot made another display of his respect for Orthodoxy, with a coronation ceremony at Suceava Cathedral.CrƒÉciun, p. 140 According to Iorga, Despot was an \\"actor\\" who \\"altogether lived too little in the real world\\", and his ambitions (such as inviting all neighboring monarchs to witness his anointment) \\"would normally stir laughter.\\" In some Protestant sources, the ceremony at Suceava was perceived as a betrayal, and equated with an Orthodox baptism.Diaconescu, pp. 172, 177 At the coronation and after, Despot reportedly used a non-traditional title, that of Moldavian \\"King\\".CrƒÉciun, p. 140; PungƒÉ, pp. 93‚Äì96 In addition to coins, he minted for himself a new crown and a distinguishing seal.PungƒÉ, pp. 91, 94 His portrait on coinage also had a circlet, a sword, and a scepter, and carried his dedication as Herclis Despote Patris Patriae.PungƒÉ, p. 94; Theodorescu, pp. 28‚Äì29.

He courted a daughter of Marcin Zborowski, sending some of his mercenaries to retrieve her,Diaconescu, pp. 178 but his conflicts with the magnates put a stop to all such overtures.Iorga (1925), p. 3; Neagoe, p. 197. See also PungƒÉ, p. 97 Also in January, Despot designated ≈Åaski as his heir, though this recognition was conditioned on the Prince having no legitimate male children.Iorga (1898), pp. 29‚Äì30 Over the following weeks, their relationship tottered over payments of Despot's debts to ≈Åaski.Kesterska Sergescu, pp. 267‚Äì268, 271‚Äì272 By February, Despot had cancelled ≈Åaski's deed to Hotin, and put in his own garrison, ensuring himself against an attack from the rear.PungƒÉ, pp. 97‚Äì98 Despot centered his attempts on obtaining an understanding with the government of Poland. Sigismund Augustus had since been persuaded that Moldavia was not a threat to him and his own uneasy peace with the Ottomans.Kesterska Sergescu, pp. 266‚Äì267 Also in 1563, Despot renewed LƒÉpu»ôneanu's oath of fealty to the Polish crown. This document confirmed Moldavia's obligation to supply Poland with 7,000 soldiers, including in the event of war with the Ottomans.Pippidi (1983), pp. 151, 154 At that stage, Moldavians were also enraged by Despot's new tax of a ducat on every household.Constantinov, p. 101; Diaconescu, p. 177 By July, although he had duly paid his country's tribute (the hara√ß), Despot was also a persona non grata at the Porte.CƒÉzan, p. 112. See also PungƒÉ, p. 98 Papacostea and other authors believe that Despot's downfall was nevertheless accelerated by another factor, namely his pledge to marry Zborowski's daughter. It signified to the boyars that Despot wished to set up a Protestant dynasty in an Orthodox country.CrƒÉciun, pp. 86, 144. See also PungƒÉ, p. 97 The rebels' indictment of the Prince specifically cited him as an enemy of God's law.CrƒÉciun, pp. 134, 140, 144 In a June 1563 document, Despot refers to his succession line as: \\"whomever of Our children or of Our house is to become hospodar, or whoever God will select to rule upon Our land of Moldavia\\".Giurescu, p. 65 =Downfall= Aerial view over Suceava's princely citadel from the western side. Areni field once stretched on the left-hand side and in the background Schesaeus and Mathias Miles recount a failed attempt on Despot's life‚Äîas the culmination of a plot uniting clergymen, including Metropolitan Grigorie, and boyars.CrƒÉciun, pp. 86, 91, 141‚Äì142; Diaconescu, pp. 171‚Äì172, 177 At the Eucharist of 1563, the plotters mixed the sacramental bread with poison. Despot was saved by a deserting conspirator, who made sure that Despot would not touch the bread, and invited the clergy to have first servings; according to Miles, all of them, including Grigorie, died within hours of the meal.CrƒÉciun, p. 142 Schesaeus believes that only \\"the monks\\" were poisoned, while boyars were ambushed and stabbed to death by loyalist mercenaries.Diaconescu, pp. 171‚Äì172, 177 In its final form, the plot centered on Hatman »òtefan Tom»ôa and Mo»õoc, who co-opted a deserting courtier, Iosif Veveri»õƒÉ.CrƒÉciun, p. 158 Another Hatman, Toma Barnovschi, formerly seen as Despot's \\"Viceroy\\",Holban, p. 1162 was reportedly threatened with bodily harm in order to join that conspiracy.Stoicescu, p. 293 In another conspiratorial action, the boyars managed to poison Lusinski, who was then buried outside Suceava.CrƒÉciun, p. 143. See also Diaconescu, p. 177 During that summer, Dmytro Vyshnevetsky, Hetman of the Zaporizhian Sich, intervened in Moldavia with the probable intention of seizing Despot's throne.

See also Gon»õa, p. 252; Kesterska Sergescu, p. 268 The army that had defeated Vyshnevetsky then besieged Despot at Suceava for some three months.Constantinov, p. 100 The boyars had ambushed many of Despot's mercenaries, having invited them to a staged celebration at Sipoteni.Diaconescu, pp. 172‚Äì173, 177, 178 In parallel, Tom»ôa encouraged an anti-Protestant pogrom, which exterminated Lusinski's widow and child, Despot's son, and a number of Cotnari's Calvinist families.CrƒÉciun, pp. 143‚Äì145; Fodor, pp. 13‚Äì14 Main targets also included Armenian women, after some were caught praying for Despot's well-being.Fodor, p. 14 Sommer recounts that these events came just as Lestarchus, finally answering Despot's invitation, was preparing to enter the country, prompting the scholar to return home.Jurcoi, p. 49 There were several aborted moves to restore the old regime. One version is that ≈Åaski switched sides again, returning to serve Despot and the Habsburg cause in exchange for the return of Hotin.CƒÉzan, pp. 113‚Äì114; Diaconescu, pp. 174, 178 Other authors argue that this never happened, despite Despot's desperate attempts.Kesterska Sergescu, p. 268 A more sustained effort came from a Habsburg envoy, Melchior Balassa.CƒÉzan, p. 112 Inside Suceava, Heraclid believed that he was facing a mutiny of his infantrymen, and executed their leader, Captain Devay or Dervici. Reportedly, the decision was rash, and actually pushed the troops into rebellion.Diaconescu, p. 178 The chronicler Grigore Ureche reports that the survivors intended to take their revenge and kill Despot, but feared that they would be decapitated for treason.Popescu, p. 239 Eventually, the Hungarian mercenaries inside Suceava turned against Despot, exhausting his capacity for resistance.Diaconescu, p. 178; Gon»õa, p. 252; Iorga (1925), p. 3 The Prince then prepared his surrender. His physician, Dyonisus d'Avalos, claimed that just hours before his death, he renounced and denounced Reformation as a whole, deploring his own role in the \\"mockery of the divine religion\\" and voicing the wish to withdraw to a monastery.CrƒÉciun, pp. 106, 111‚Äì112, 116‚Äì117 This narrative is partly corroborated in Catholic reports of the period, which claim that Despot's final wish was to be ordained.CrƒÉciun, pp. 111‚Äì112, 113 According to CrƒÉciun, the exhibition was insincere, a final act in the constant dissimulation of Heraclid's Protestant or Unitarian faith.CrƒÉciun, pp. 111‚Äì112 Despot's surrender and death are dated to November 4‚Äì5, 1563.Iorga (1925), p. 3; Le Sergeant de Monnecove, p. 2 He stepped out of the fortress, dressed in full regalia, and walked or rodeDiaconescu, pp. 174‚Äì175 toward his enemies. Ureche recounts that Despot met Tom»ôa just outside the city walls, on the open fields of Areni. In anticipation, the rebel leader had gathered here the estates of the realm, to approve of his own coronation.Mare»ô, pp. 150‚Äì151 According to various accounts, Tom»ôa personally killed Despot in front of the assembly, striking him with a mace.Diaconescu, p. 175; Mare»ô, pp. 150‚Äì151; Rezachievici (2007), p. 28. See also Constantinov, p. 101; MurƒÉra»ôu, p. 17; Neagoe, p. 198; Popescu, p. 238 Ureche and Schesaeus suggest that death came not from the blow itself, but from being left to bleed.Diaconescu, p. 175; Mare»ô, p. 151 Other sources contrarily note that Despot was killed by one or several executioners.Kesterska Sergescu, p. 269; PungƒÉ, p. 98 An 18th-century chronicle reports that Despot's body was taken for burial at Putna Monastery, but this contradicts sources which say that his grave was dug at Areni. Schesaeus notes that Despot had been reduced to pieces by the \\"rabid crowd\\", whereas Sommer only recalls that Despot's severed head was embalmed and sent as a gift to Istanbul.Diaconescu, pp. 175, 178 As this occurred, Tom»ôa also arrested Demetrios, but pardoned him, marking his nose with a cut‚Äîsince mutilation technically invalidated him from ever taking the throne. Legacy =Aftermath= Ruxandra with the severed heads of boyars. 1872 etching by Theodor Aman Franciscus Pestientis, the pseudonymous Habsburg spy, noted immediately after that Z√°polya was directly involved in Despot's assassination, thus securing Eastern Hungary's other border in case of a Habsburg attack from the west.CƒÉzan, p. 113 Soldiers sent by Z√°polya were present at the final taking of Suceava.Diaconescu, pp. 173, 178; PungƒÉ, p. 96 This was a major setback for the Habsburg designs in Eastern Europe, and contributed to the reorientation of Ferdinand's foreign policies.CƒÉzan, p. 112; CrƒÉciun, p. 146 According to Denize, Despot's own \\"Dacian\\" plan was not fully abandoned by the Moldavians, but resumed in later generations within \\"more realistic proportions\\".Denize (1999), p. 162 Historians such as Adolf Armbruster and CƒÉtƒÉlin PungƒÉ note that the 1561 discourse holds the first traces of Romanian nationalism. PungƒÉ argues that Despot adopted it for the captatio benevolentiae of his subjects, meaning that the idea of a Moldo‚ÄìWallachian political union preceded Despot's reign.PungƒÉ , pp. 91‚Äì93 As argued by Theodorescu, Despot, as a \\"cultured adventurer\\", was one of those figures who \\"affirmed sonorously the Romanians' Romanness\\".Theodorescu, p. 16 Tom»ôa took the throne, though he never managed to obtain Ottoman recognition; he was also attacked by Peter the Younger, who dreamed of uniting the two thrones, but was able to defeat him.Neagoe, p. 198 He and Mo»õoc ultimately fled to Poland, where they were put to death in May 1564.Constantinov, p. 101; Diaconescu, pp. 175, 178; Gon»õa, p. 253; Kesterska Sergescu, pp. 269‚Äì270; Stoicescu, pp. 316, 325 His short regnal interlude confused writers of the period: in a 1564 brief by the Venetian mercenary Giovanandrea Gromo, Despot and Tom»ôa are merged into a Stefano Eraclio.Adriano Papo, \\"La 'breve' corografia della Transilvania di Giovanandrea Gromo\\", in Revista Crisia, Vol. XLVII, 2017, p. 66 In late 1563, having obtained Joseph Nasi's support, LƒÉpu»ôneanu returned to Moldavia to begin his second reign. Allied with the Crimeans, he allowed them to raid Moldavian villages and take some 21,000 peasants as slaves.Berindei, p. 42 There then came new heights of terror, specifically aimed at those boyars and Orthodox priests who had supported Despot. One mass execution made 47 boyar and courtier victims.Iorga (1898), p. 19 Records show that he also targeted the minority religions, ordering massacres of the Armenians and less documented persecutions of the remaining Protestants.CrƒÉciun, pp. 84‚Äì86 He tolerated Catholics, and, in at least one instance, openly agreed with them that Despot had been a \\"godless man\\".CrƒÉciun, p. 85 The new monarch reportedly ordered Despot's remains exhumed, placed in a burlap sack, and left to hang from a pole. One record claims that Putna's monks recovered them and placed them in a smaller wooden monastery; two centuries after, Putna was still preserving Despot's empty grave. LƒÉpu»ôneanu also delivered Demetrios to Chiajna, who ordered his public humiliation and decapitation.Cazacu, p. 68; Iorga (1898), p. 34 In 1565‚Äì1566 ≈Åaski activated his rights to the throne, and tried to invade Moldavia with Habsburg help; he had competition from »òtefan M√¢zgƒÉ, endorsed by Pierre Roussel and Ferenc Zay.Iorga (1898), pp. 30‚Äì33 Also then, impostors claiming to be Despot's brother or son appeared in Venetian territories or under Habsburg rule.Iorga (1898), pp. 34‚Äì35 Peter the Younger's rival MƒÉrƒÉcine, who was living in exile in Istanbul, had been executed on Suleiman's orders.Iorga (1898), p. 36; Rezachievici (1998), p. 55 Nicolaus Bassaraba followed in Despot's footsteps, escaping to Malta, then to Spain.Denize (1996), p. 53; Rezachievici (1998), pp. 54‚Äì56, 58 The Chronicle of Azarie includes a posthumous damnation of Despot. His death, the author claimed, had \\"stifled the amber that produced a smoke of non-belief\\". Traditional Moldavian historiography replicated this narrative, asserting that Despot's downfall was an act of divine retribution.MurƒÉra»ôu, pp. 24, 51 CrƒÉciun notes that the \\"reactive violence or intensity offer a measure of the impact his [religious] policies have had on Moldavian society\\".CrƒÉciun, p. 9 Another author, Cristian Luca, proposes a parallel between Despot and a 1580s Wallachian Prince, Petru Cercel, in that they both tried to Westernize their countries but were met with violent hostility from traditionalists.Constantin DobrilƒÉ, \\"Recenzii »ôi noti»õe bibliografice. Cristian Luca, Petru Cercel, un domn umanist √Æn »öara Rom√¢neascƒÉ\\", in Studii »ôi Materiale de Istorie Medie, Vol. XVIII, 2000, p. 277 However, some Moldavians remained indebted to the deceased Prince. According to Kesterska Sergescu, a series of rebellions and mass flights in the later 1560s suggests that \\"Jacob Heraclide's example did not go unheeded\\".Kesterska Sergescu, pp. 273‚Äì274 Historical topographers note the presence of a carved stone slab at Areni, which may indicate that the populace there still commemorated his death.Mare»ô, pp. 150‚Äì151, 156 =Patronage and aesthetics= Despite Azarie's pronouncements, Johann Sommer survived the persecutions and was still present in Moldavia by 1570, when he joined Ferenc D√°vid's Unitarian movement in Transylvania.CrƒÉciun, pp. 110‚Äì111 Cotnari's collegium continued to function as a Calvinist seminary until 1588, when Peter the Lame ceded it to the Catholics.CrƒÉciun, p. 128; Diaconescu, p. 178 As noted by literary historian D. MurƒÉra»ôu, it had failed in its apparent promise, that of sparking a \\"cultural renaissance\\" in Orthodox lands;MurƒÉra»ôu, p. 17 scholar Traian Diaconescu also argues that, having \\"planted the seed of Renaissance culture\\", Despot still \\"failed to realize that one cannot abruptly 'civilize' a country with only a few educated boyars, and illiterate masses.\\"Diaconescu, pp. 168, 178 Despot's influence on the Catholic community of Ia»ôi County was sensed in the 1590s by Bernardo Quirini, the church inspector, who found that Catholics had kept the Lutheran books and even agreed with some Protestant doctrines.CrƒÉciun, p. 190 The new school was eventually moved out of Cotnari, and is today's Saint Joseph Institute. Despot had a fragmented legacy in visual arts and architecture. He ordered a Calvinist church to be built at Cotnari, but it remained unfinished.CrƒÉciun, p. 129 After taking Suceava, he ordered the battle of Verbia to be depicted on the (since deteriorated) walls of his princely palace.Theodorescu, pp. 27‚Äì28 He also created here a book collection, including precious manuscript copies of the classics, such as a gilded-letter version of Cicero's works, from De re publica to Epistulae ad Atticum.Theodorescu, pp. 27, 43 According to several authors, Despot's religious experiment may have also had an enduring impact on Romanian culture: his presumed patronage of some liturgical translations is credited by Papacostea for having given impetus to the emergence of literary Romanian.CrƒÉciun, pp. 120‚Äì121 Scholar N.

They replicated Western Renaissance portraits, that proved highly influential, changing monetary symbolism for some 30 years.Theodorescu, pp. 28‚Äì29 Scholarly debates cover the interpretation of Despot's coinage, seals, and greater coat of arms. His imperial diploma of 1555 showed a regular party per cross shield with various charges, including a fish-with-ring, a temple, a bay tree, and a lion. In 1560,PungƒÉ, pp. 92‚Äì93, 94 Despot also began using the Moldavian aurochs, which generally had a classical (affronty, inescutcheon) representation.Cernovodeanu, pp. 84, 97, 100‚Äì101 This symbolism became more complex during his reign, when a 14-quarters heraldic seal appeared, also including the aurochs and the Reichsadler; a charge of roses was also featured.PungƒÉ, pp. 92‚Äì93 The result is described as a \\"pretentious heraldic amalgam\\" by scholar Dan Cernovodeanu, who also notes its similarity with the personal arms of Charles V.Cernovodeanu, p. 113 Pippidi identifies the three roses as canting arms of Rhodos, while the fish and \\"Polycrates' ring\\" stand for Samos. However, Cernovodeanu argues that Despot took his roses from the Mu»ôatins' dynastic arms, also borrowing a modified fleur-de-lis and Pahonia (which became, respectively, a \\"leaf-like\\" pattern and a cross patt√©e).Cernovodeanu, pp. 108, 113, 116, 118 Other scholars believe that the roses allude to Despot's project of uniting Moldavia and Wallachia, or, contrarily, that they have a purely aesthetic function.PungƒÉ, p. 93 A lion also appeared on dinars probably minted by Despot for circulation in an occupied Transylvania. These are largely based on the Hunyadi family arms, including a raven, and also feature a Patriarchal cross. The intent behind such symbolism may be political,PungƒÉ, pp. 93‚Äì94 or more pragmatically an attempt capitalize on the prestige of dinars from the old Hungarian Kingdom.ChirilƒÉ & DƒÉnilƒÉ, p. 244 All such imagery is altered in the final issues of coinage, where Despot uses the aurochs, the Wallachian bird, and the seven towers of Transylvania under a Reichsadler.PungƒÉ, pp. 94‚Äì95 =Folkloric and literary memory= Attributed portrait of Basilicus Melitensis, displayed at Birgu; may actually depict Cosimo II de' Medici Despot's turbulent rule was the object of interest outside the Danubian Principalities.

This tradition was also publicized in the 1990s by Maltese authors Charles A. Gauci and Vincent Zammit, who complied the various textual references and published reproductions of Basilicus' attributed portraits.Pippidi (2000), pp. 174‚Äì175 According to Pippidi, the story itself is a distant retelling of Despot's career in Moldavia, while the portraits are part of the invented tradition: they depict the 17th-century Cosimo II de' Medici and the 18th-century Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu; inscriptions identifying them as \\"Basilicus\\" were probably added before 1850.Pippidi (2000), pp. 174‚Äì178 By the 1860s, the complete story of Despot's reign had been popularized in Malta by authors G. Trapani, G. A. Vassallo, and L. Calleja, the latter of whom also drew his portrait.Pippidi (2000), p. 175 Despot's project to unite Wallachia and Moldavia was only realized in 1859, with the \\"United Principalities\\". Here and in the successor Kingdom of Romania, interest in Heraclid's life was revived by a series of literary works. A Despot VodƒÉ is one of six \\"Romanian history dramas\\" completed by Dimitrie Bolintineanu in the 1860s.Iorga (1934), p. 9 A decade later, Samson BodnƒÉrescu similarly focused on the rule of LƒÉpu»ôneanu, inexplicably eliminating Despot from his retelling.Iorga (1934), p. 250 Vasile Alecsandri was inspired by BodnƒÉrescu to revisit the events with his own work of drama.Iorga (1934), p. 256 Also called Despot VodƒÉ, it was first shown at the National Theater Bucharest in October, 1879.Radu Manoliu, \\"Izvoarele motivelor »ôi procedeelor din poeziile lui Eminescu\\", in PreocupƒÉri Literare, Vol. I, Issue 5, May 1938, p. 283 The work was loosely based on the historical narrative, and more heavily indebted to Victor Hugo.MurƒÉra»ôu, p. 254 It divided the public between those who, like Ion Ghica, saw in it Alecsandri's masterpiece, and dissatisfied critics, such as Barbu »òtefƒÉnescu Delavrancea.MurƒÉra»ôu, pp. 254, 263, 278, 337 Iorga also viewed its take on Heraclid as \\"exaggerated and false\\" for failing to capture the \\"sincere dreamer\\".Iorga (1934), pp. 255‚Äì256 Literary historian Sebastian-Vlad Popa notes that, by the 1990s, the work was viewed as \\"detestable\\" in the theatrical community, and ridiculed as a \\"wooden text\\".Popa, p. 23 Also in the 1870s, Nicolae Scurtescu contributed a dramatic poem with the same subject and title. According to Iorga and MurƒÉra»ôu, it is just as valuable as Alecsandri's text.Iorga (1934), pp. 25‚Äì27; MurƒÉra»ôu, p. 263 Popa notes a contrast, in that Scurtescu's writing is \\"naturalistic\\", its violence seeping into \\"absurdity\\".Popa, p. 22 Theodor Codrescu's play PlƒÉe»ôul LogofƒÉt Mare, dating from the same stage in literary development, was also set in Heraclid's Moldavia.

It is notable for being printed in vivid Technicolor long after the process had been abandoned in the United States. It was also the first Chinese film to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, in 1990. The film is a tragedy, focusing on the character of Ju Dou, a beautiful young woman who has been sold as a wife to Jinshan, an old cloth dyer. The film was banned for a few years in China, but the ban has since been lifted.Zhang Yimou. Frances K. Gateward, Yimou Zhang, Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2001, pp. 26-7. The Chinese government gave permission for its viewing in July 1992.Zhang Yimou. Frances K. Gateward, Yimou Zhang, Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2001, p. 42.

University Press of Mississippi, 2001. , 9781578062621. p. 159. Plot Ju Dou takes place in the early 20th century in rural China. Yang Tianqing (Li Baotian) is returning from a trek to sell silk for his adoptive uncle, Yang Jinshan (Li Wei). Jinshan, whose trade is dyeing fabrics, is known for his cruelty. Jinshan has recently purchased a new wife, having beaten two previous wives to death after they failed to produce a son, the cruel irony being that Jinshan is in fact impotent. Upon meeting the wife, Ju Dou (Gong Li), Tianqing is enamored with her. At night, Jinshan tortures Ju Dou. Tianqing discovers Ju Dou's bathing area and spies on her. He does not know that Ju Dou knows he is there. Although Tianqing watches luridly at first, Ju Dou transforms the meaning of his gaze by exposing her bruises and sobbing, forcing him to see her as a human being rather than just a sexual object. Soon, the two are unable to control their passion any longer and engage in sex. When Ju Dou discovers she is pregnant with Tianqing's child, she and Tianqing pretend that the child is Jinshan's. Jinshan suffers a stroke that leaves him paralyzed from the waist down. After Ju Dou tells him the child is not his, he attempts to kill the child and burn down the house. Tianqing ties up Jinshan and hoists him in a barrel, leaving him dangling helplessly, a bitter bystander to his usurpation. Knowing that society would never accept her infidelity, Ju Dou goes to a nunnery to terminate another pregnancy. Jinshan continues to influence the life of the child he named Tianbai and when the child calls Jinshan \\"Father,\\" Jinshan accepts this as psychological revenge on his wife and nephew. One day, Jinshan falls into the dye vat and drowns and a funeral is held for him. Seven years later, Ju Dou and Tianqing still run the dye operation but Tianbai (Zheng Ji'an) is now a rage-filled teenager. Rumors of his parents' infidelities drive him to nearly kill a local gossiper. Ju Dou reveals the truth to her son in a fit of rage. She and Tianqing decide to have one last affair and grow weak after falling asleep in a cellar with little air. Upon discovering his parents resting in the cellar after their tryst, Tianbai drags them out - still weak and unable to awaken - and drowns Tianqing. Ju Dou then burns the mill down as the film ends. Adaptation In the original novel Tianqing is the biological nephew of Jinshan and the story itself is about incest by affinity. The makers of the film version decided not to use the incest angle. In the film, Tianqing and Jinshan are not biologically related, and Ju Dou only begins her relationship with Tianqing after learning that he and Jinshan are not related.

A very common use is the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, where tumour deposits appear as \\"punched-out\\" lesions. The standard set of X-rays for a skeletal survey includes X-rays of the skull, entire spine, pelvis, ribs, both humeri and femora (proximal long bones). It is more effective than isotope scans at detecting bone involvement in multiple myeloma. Although significantly less sensitive than MRI, it is easier to include more bones. A study found that MRI of just the spine and pelvis would have detected 9% fewer cases of bone involvement than the more extensive skeletal survey which therefore remains the standard method. Skeletal surveys are also used with suspected non-accidental injury in children (CE guidelines state that 19 images of the child are taken.) These are reported on by a consultant paediatric radiologist and often copies are made. Non-accidental injury is suspected if a child sustains an injury where the clinical findings are not consistent with the explanation given for the injury, such as a spiral fracture in a child who is not yet walking. A skull CT is also done in connection with the radiographs if the child is under one year old or, if the child is older, where there is a clinical requirement (perioribtal ecchymosis, for example) as to rule out abusive head trauma. The results of a skeletal survey may be used in a court of law as evidence of child abuse.

Thanlyin Township comprises 17 quarters and 28 village tracts. It is home to the largest port in the country, Thilawa port. History Thanlyin first came to prominence in the 15th century as the main port city of the Hanthawaddy Kingdom, replacing a silted up Bago port. In 1539, the city became part of the Kingdom of Taungoo. In 1599, the city fell to the Rakhine forces led by the Portuguese mercenary Filipe de Brito e Nicote, who was made governor of the city. De Brito declared independence from his nominal Rakhine masters in 1603, defeated the invading Rakhine navy in 1604 and 1605, and successfully established Portuguese rule over Syriam or Siri√£o -as it was called back then- under the Portuguese viceroy of Goa. In 1613, Burmese king Anaukpetlun recaptured the city, and executed Brito by impalement, a punishment reserved for defilers of Buddhist temples. Thanlyin remained the major port of the Taungoo kingdom until the mid-18th century. In the 1740s, Thanlyin was made the base of the French East India Company for their help in the Mon's reestablishment of Hanthawaddy Kingdom. The arrangement lasted until 1756 when King Alaungpaya of Konbaung dynasty captured the city. From then on, the importance has shifted to Yangon across the river, which Alaungpaya founded just a year earlier. Thanlyin became part of the British Empire in 1852 after the Second Anglo-Burmese War. The British made the city into the oil refinery center of the country in the early 20th century to process the oil shipped from central Burma. The refinery was destroyed during World War II. The Thanlyin refinery was rebuilt in 1957, and underwent expansion in 1979 with Japanese assistance. In 1979 a pipeline was completed between Syriam and the Mann oilfield. Since the 1990s, the city has undergone major changes. Thanlyin was finally connected to Yangon by road in 1993 when the Thanlyin Bridge was built. In the late 1990s, Thilawa Port was built to handle the container ships away from Yangon's ports. The city is home to a national university in Myanmar Maritime University, and local universities in the University of East Yangon and Technological University, Thanlyin. The city's population has increased from 43,000 in 1983 to 123,000 in 1996. Transport Thanlyin is connected to the country's fledgling highway network. The Thanlyin Bridge carries Highway 6, which links Yangon with the Thilawa port and Thanlyin Industrial Zone. The Thanlyin Bridge 2, under construction since 2003, will link Thanlyin to Highway 2, the Yangon- Mandalay highway.

It is a tributary of the Brazos River. It is formed by the convergence of the North Paluxy River and the South Paluxy River near Bluff Dale, Texas in Erath County and flows a distance of before joining the Brazos just to the east of Glen Rose, Texas in south central Somervell County.Handbook of Texas, Paluxy River It is best known for numerous dinosaur footprints found in its bed near Glen Rose at the Dinosaur Valley State Park. The Paluxy River became famous for controversy in the early 1930s when locals found dinosaur and supposed human footprints in the same rock layer in the Glen Rose Formation, which were widely publicized as evidence against the geological time scale and in favor of young-Earth creationism. However, these anachronistic \\"human\\" footprints have been determined to be mistaken interpretation or hoaxes.The Texas Dinosaur/\\"Man Track\\" Controversy, by Glen Kuban Talk.OriginsWeber, Christopher Gregory. \\"Paluxy Man ‚Äî The Creationist Piltdown\\". Creation/Evolution Journal, 1981, pp. 16‚Äì22. Paluxy trackways Dinosaur tracks in Paluxy River Many dinosaur trackways and footprints have been discovered in the riverbed, some as early as 1908. Most tracks in the area were found in Cretaceous limestone.Branch, G. (2006). Paluxy Footprints. In H. J. Birx (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Anthropology (Vol. 4, p. 1818). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Reference. One of the most well-known is the chase sequence, which contains the tracks of a herd of sauropods and at least one theropod following the herd.Farlow, J. O., et al (2010). Dinosaur tracksites of the Paluxy River (Glen Rose Formation, Lower Cretaceous), Dinosaur Valley State Park, Somervell County, Texas, USA. Fifth Jornadas Internacionales sobre Paleontolog√≠a de Dinosaurios y su Entorno, Salas de los Infantes, Burgos, Spain, pp. 15‚Äì16. The tracks have been attributed to Sauroposeidon and Acrocanthosaurus, respectively. Other well-known and studied sites containing similar trackways are the Taylor Site, the Blue Hole Ballroom, and the Blue Hole Parlor. In 1938, paleontologist Roland Bird discovered tracks in the Paluxy River. The documenting and publishing of these findings made the site famous and attracted the attention of researchers, some of whom began to claim that some of the tracks were human footprints. =Alternative interpretations= The Paluxy River trackways have drawn much attention from supporters of creation and evolution alike. Some claimed that some footprints were made by mythological giant humans who lived at the same time as the dinosaurs who created the other tracks. John Whitcomb, Henry Morris, John Morris, and Carl Baugh all are current or former proponents of the human footprint hypothesis. Though there are some that still cite the trackways as evidence against the geological time scale, the general consensus is that all of the human tracks were either fake or interpreted incorrectly.Cole, J. R., Godfrey, L., & Schafersman, S. (1985). Mantracks? The Fossils Say No!. Creation/Evolution, 5, 37-45. Some of the tracks were fake, carved by locals to sell during the Great Depression. These footprints do not represent the way human footprints would look in mud; they also do not accurately reflect the changes in the way giant humans would walk as a result of their size. Other footprints were genuine tracks, but showed features inconsistent with human footprints. Supporters of the human footprint hypothesis claimed that the tracks showed authentic mud ‚Äúpush-ups‚Äù and that the time period for the human and dinosaur trackways had to be the same as the trails intersected. In 1986, Glen Kuban conducted research on the trackways. He found that most tracks formed a wide ‚ÄúV‚Äù at the end and showed grooves in places that were not consistent with those in a human footprint. Kuban determined that the tracks were made by bipedal dinosaurs with three toes. These particular tracks showed the dinosaur walking on the soles of its feet rather than on its toes, as is usually found in tracks. Evidence based in human anatomy also refutes the claim that the footprints are of human origin. The foot length measurements were used to calculate approximate heights of the humans; the pace and stride lengths do not match these calculated heights, making it highly unlikely that the tracks are human in origin. The measurements do fit the known values for bipedal dinosaurs. Other theories include random natural and erosion patterns resembling human footprints, trace fossils of burrows of small invertebrates, severely eroded or partial tracks, and other impressions known to occur in dinosaur trackways caused by different body parts. Digital recreation Digital fly through over the trackway In 2014, a digital model was made of the chase sequence trackways from photographs taken in 1940 by Bird. The photographs were used to create the digital reconstruction of the tracks as they were in 1940, before excavations. Though the reconstruction shows high variations in quality in different parts of the model, it provides a good demonstration of historical photogrammetry used to model deteriorated sites and specimens.Falkingham, P. L., Farlow, J. O. (2014). Historical Photogrammetry: Bird's Paluxy River Dinosaur Chase Sequence Digitally Reconstructed as It Was prior to Excavation 70 Years Ago.

History Technical education in Warrnambool had its roots in a Mechanics Institute, established in 1853. A technical school operated from the Mechanics Institute until larger premises were sought from 1908. Warrnambool Technical School operated on the current campus from 1913, operating within the state education system. It became known as the Warrnambool Technical College in 1958, The tertiary component of the College became the Warrnambool Institute of Advanced Education (WIAE), and when the TAFE section separated from the WIAE in 1984, there was another name change to Warrnambool College of Technical and Further Education (TAFE). South West Institute of TAFE came into existence as a multi-campus institution on 9 January 1987, when the TAFE operations of the Hamilton and Portland Technical Schools were combined with the Warrnambool College of TAFE. Known firstly as the South West College of TAFE, the college was renamed on 1 August 1995 to become the South West Institute of TAFE. From 2006 until 2013, the Institute managed Glenormiston College and assumed further regional responsibilities for training in agriculture, and farm and horse management.

Created by Chuck Dixon as an adversary of Batman, the character first appeared in Detective Comics #654, published in December 1992. Named for the character's gimmick for military strategy and prowess with small arms, stories involving the character often include historic military references and themes. Initially portrayed as a dangerously psychopathic, murderous child, the tone of the General was changed by Dixon himself for later appearances. Return appearances featured the character in issues of Robin during the mid-1990s, in which Dixon portrayed the character as pompous and childish, rather than maliciously insane. Although still occasionally dangerous and lethal, the graphic violence of the character's criminal behavior was also toned down. The character experienced a prolonged period of obscurity after 1997, lasting over ten years, until Fabian Nicieza chose to revamp the character for the concluding story arc of the Robin comic book series in the final months of 2008. With Nicieza's intention being to establish the character as an archenemy for Tim Drake, the General was once again characterized as a major threat in the \\"Batman family\\" pantheon of villains. Recast as a new version of another obscure character, Anarky, Armstrong was also re-characterized with a new \\"Anarky\\" themed costume. Publication history =Creation and first appearance= The General was created by Chuck Dixon in 1992. Ulysses Hadrian Armstrong is a psychotic child with the mind of a military genius. Bored with his life at a military school, he reads books about military history. Ulysses later escapes his school, burning down the school and killing everyone inside; these are acts of arson and mass murder, committed to avoid alerting authorities to his escape. He goes to Gotham City to recruit small-time gang members into a makeshift \\"army\\". Utilizing military skills, Armstrong's reputation gains him the nickname \\"the General\\". Continuing a campaign to become a powerful crime boss of Gotham, the General conquers and absorbs enemy gangs into a sizable force. Laying siege to a police station with the intent of capturing the storage room full of guns and illegal drugs, with which to fund future activities, he is confronted by Batman. Once captured by Batman, the General's undisciplined army scatters in fear, and the General himself is sent to a youth detention center. =Mid 1990s appearances in Robin= Between 1995 and 1997, the General appeared in a total of three story arcs in issues of the Robin comic book series. The General manipulated delusional homeless derelict, Julie Caesar, who believed himself to be the historical Julius Caesar. The General teamed up with Toyman, but this partnership ended in mutual betrayal. The General was given control as commander-in-chief of a country's military. =2008 revamp as \\"Anarky\\"= The costume design for the new Ulysses H. Armstrong version of Anarky, as depicted on promotional art for Robin #182, part of the \\"Faces of Evil\\" event. Art by Brian Stelfreeze. The General appeared at the end of 2008 in Robin #177, the \\"Search for a Hero\\" storyline that deals with the Batman R.I.P. aftermath, Battle for the Cowl. Within the storyline, he is revealed to be disguised as Red Robin. After a very long absence, the General has returned to Gotham City, having aged several years, grown several feet and has become a more formidable hand-to-hand combatant. He physically appears closer in age to Robin and Spoiler. He has for reasons yet unknown been hired by Spoiler to gather information about the Gang Wars, and find a possible solution to them. He continues to hold a grudge against Robin and betrays Spoiler. Spoiler survives a gunshot to the shoulder, and then distracts him long enough to get the drop on him and escape. He comes into possession of the Red Robin costume worn by Jason Todd, and uses it as part of a campaign of psychological warfare against Tim Drake. More formidable than ever, he's revealed to be holding Lonnie Machin hostage and to have commandeered the latter's identity as Anarky. Where Machin's approach as Anarky had been to cause social change, Armstrong's approach bordered more on psychotic and meaningless acts of chaos and destruction. Armstrong manages to catch Robin in his warehouse, yet Robin escapes through unknown means, but not without sustaining serious burns to his head. Soon after, a final confrontation ensues, where Anarky attempts to kill all of Gotham City's gangs, so as to create more violence. The combined efforts of Robin, Spoiler, Commissioner Gordon, Officer Harper and the Gotham gangs results in Armstrong's defeat; however, not without a price. In order to take the edge off of Armstrong, Robin asked Officer Harper to bring the Armstrong Family to confront Ulysses. While the action worked, Armstrong caused a bomb to explode, killing his brother and sister in the blast. Armstrong blames Robin for their deaths. =Rebirth= Ulysses returns to continuity after Flashpoint event during the Detective Comics storyline \\"Rise of the Batmen\\", a part of DC's Rebirth relaunch. This version of the character is a teenage genius who works for a military organization known as The Colony, which models itself after Batman and his methods. Ulysses' job within the Colony is to reverse engineer Batman's equipment, as well as observe the Bat-Family. This version of the character is shown to be cheerful yet sociopathic, gleefully offering to show Batman footage of the more gruesome missions that the Colony has undertaken. Skills and resources =Military strategy and deception= The General is a military and strategic genius. He has vast knowledge of military history, and his careful planning are what earned him the respect of his henchmen. Sometimes he fools adults into false senses of security in order to attack them. Sometimes he tricks adults into letting him control armies. =Armed and unarmed combat= Growing up, he gains a muscular build and a lesser degree of martial arts knowledge, not nearly enough to best seasoned fighters like Robin, but quite formidable nevertheless. He retains his penchant for historical weapons, and in his brief stint as the Red Robin he's shown using a Mauser as his sidearm of preference. =Costumes= He likes to play dress up, changing several costumes and identities in his career. Starting from a simple military themed garb, he then adopted the Red Robin suit, discarded from a dimension hopping Jason Todd, using the Bat-Family themed identity to pave off for his return as the new Anarchy. As Anarchy he uses a modified version of the original Anarky suit, adapted to fit his broader and sturdier physical build and with an angrier mask. =Explosives expertise= Both as Red Robin and as Anarky, Adrian is shown able to create and set complex explosive traps, drawing Tim Drake in a mined warehouse and managing to wound him seriously. As Anarky he wears a special cane with remote controller trigger, making him able to detonate explosives carefully hidden through the battlefield.

In these industries, the other essential raw material is fuel for firing and potteries may be located near to fuel sources. Former claypits are sometimes filled with water and used for recreational purposes such as sailing and scuba diving. The Eden Project at Bodelva near St Austell, Cornwall, UK is a major redevelopment of a former china clay (kaolin) pit for educational and environmental purposes.

The latest in the series is Total Extreme Wrestling 2020, which was released on May 15, 2020. Extreme Warfare Revenge 4.0 was released in 2002 on computer text simulator.  Games in the series  = Classic Extreme Warfare = Adam Ryland originally developed Extreme Warfare as a collectible card game with a wrestling theme. Due to complexity and set up time it was decided a computer format would be more suitable. The first Extreme Warfare on the PC (now called Extreme Warfare 1) was programmed in 1995 in QBasic. This game was a simple simulator, where one could decide what matches were to take place and who was going to win them but also involved some simple financial elements, such as the wages of wrestlers. Due to limitations in QBasic, Ryland moved the series over to Turbo Pascal where further incarnations of the game were created, including: Extreme Warfare 2, Extreme Warfare 2000, Extreme Warfare 2001, Extreme Warfare 2002, Extreme Warfare 5000, Extreme Warfare 6000, Extreme Warfare 7500, and Extreme Warfare 9000. Each version of the game was an upgrade of the previous and continually built on the ideas of booking matches and running the business side of a professional wrestling promotion. After release of EW 9000, a game called Promotion Wars was released by fellow British programmer Adam Jennings, taking some inspiration from both Extreme Warfare 9000 and Championship Manager. After the game's release, some of Extreme Warfare's fan base shifted their interest over to this game when released in October 2000. = Extreme Warfare Deluxe = On April 1, 2001, Extreme Warfare Deluxe (EWD) was released. It was the first game in a while to be built by scratch instead of an upgrade of the previous games. EWD expanded on the previous games in terms of the actual game world. The game world was expanded in that everyone in the database can now be hired by any promotion, unlike previous games in which WWF superstars can only be hired by the WWF, with the same applying for WCW and ECW. This helped to bring more competition between promotions, which now had their own artificial intelligence. Also included in EWD was the match report screen which featured stats about the match quality, crowd reaction and worker effort of the match along with an overall rating. This setup would end up being the basis of all match report screens in later games in the series up to and including TEW 2004. Initially, Ryland stated that Deluxe was going to be the final game of the series but shortly afterwards, he changed his mind and began work on a new Extreme Warfare game. With the limitations of Turbo Pascal now pushing the game to the limit, Ryland decided in October 2001 to start work on a brand new game in the EW series. = Extreme Warfare Revenge = Extreme Warfare Revenge (EWR) was released on June 15, 2002. Now programmed in Visual Basic, the series now took a Windows style interface. One of the most significant changes this game took to the series was the fact that everything on a wrestling event is under the control of the user. In previous games in the series, angles, finishes and (in EWD) interviews were randomly created. This also coincided with the new feud system that was to count the matches, angles and interview victories between the workers involved. The match reports also took a slight change, featuring reviews of the matches from such Internet columnists as Scott Keith instead of a straight play-by-play style. However, the report style would revert to its old style in TEW 2004. Another major feature that changed the way the game was played was the way the game world was represented. Unlike the previous games in which it was mostly focused on the major promotions such as the WWF, WCW, and ECW the promotion size feature meant many promotions in North America could now be included from the global sized promotions like WWE to the cult sized promotions like ROH to a mere backyard federation. From June 2002 to July 2003, the game has had some significant upgrades and new versions of the game were released. Some of these changes included changes to the TV timeslot system where the more further away from a prime time slot a televised event is shown, the fewer segments the user gets to book with. The Internet feature was also increased to include a website based on the independent promotions, a website based on backstage gossip and a website for your promotion. Relationships between workers were added to help bring in backstage politics where people are more willing put over their friends and less with their enemies. Eventually workers could also be in multiple tag teams with a statistic for experience which increases with each match fought together. Gimmicks were then added for wrestlers to use which would affect the overness of a worker over how strong that gimmick was. More changes were made to adapt to the independent promotions. This included multiple open contracts for workers, enabling them to work in up to three promotions and the ability of workers to go on Japanese tours, affecting the booking of cards. The optional ability of viewing a wrestler's picture was also added later in the game's production. Due to the size of the game, Ryland felt that in order to include new features and upgrades a completely new game would have to be programmed from scratch. With this task taking quite a lot of his time, Ryland decided to turn his hobby into a commercial venture, signing a contract with simulator game company .400 Software Studios to produce a new commercial game. = Total Extreme Warfare 2004 = Total Extreme Warfare 2004 (TEW 2004) was released on March 31, 2004 under .400 Software Studios. The game was distributed by downloading on the Internet after purchase, (using ELicense). A full working trial was also available for download which originally would expire after a single day but was replaced by a trial that makes the user able to play one game month unlimited times. Along with a new professional layout, the game had more features. While the previous games only focused on the wrestling scene of North America (Japan was featured in later versions of EWR but not playable), TEW 2004 expanded the world to include such areas as Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom and Australia. With this, each worker's overness was now expanded from EWR's single value to a series of values depending on areas in the world. The AI was changed in that now the user could now see what matches other promotions have booked, other promotions' financial details and what deals they have made. More contract clauses such as medical coverage and travel expenditure being included, contracts deal decisions were now made over time rather than immediate. Inspired by some fans playing against each other using WWE brands by sending files to each other through the Internet, a multi-player feature was added to make users play against each other with different promotions. Booking was also improved in that not only could the user edit the card more easily, the booking was now time-based, meaning such anomalies as booking 11-hour-long Iron Man matches on a two-hour shows would no longer be possible. The game was also more customisable than before with new editing modes as Create-A-Match and Create-A-Gimmick. Due to the problem of copyright issues by going commercial, the series turned from using stats of the real wrestling world to a fictitious wrestling world called the CornellVerse. This world is named after the character of Tommy Cornell, one of the most influential people and best wrestlers in the CornellVerse, based on a character Ryland had created a few years earlier while participating in e-federations. On June 14, 2004, the game was renamed Total Extreme Wrestling 2004 to help distinguish the new TEW series from the earlier EWR series. Due to undisclosed reasons, Ryland moved from .400 Software Studios to another simulator game company, Grey Dog Software. His first game created there however was not another Extreme Warfare game, instead the first Wrestling Spirit game. Due to .400 Software Studio's closure on January 1, 2006, the game was taken off the market permanently. There are currently no plans to make this game freeware or shareware. = Total Extreme Wrestling 2005 = The sequel to TEW 2004, Total Extreme Wrestling 2005 (TEW 2005) was released on October 6, 2005 under Grey Dog Software. A demo was also released in advance on September 29, 2005, allowing the user to play one game month just like previous demos. TEW 2005 included some more new features. Advance booking was one example which helped to promote upcoming big events. Televised shows also improved, bringing both competition to the shows with non-wrestling shows along with multiple television deals around the world for one show. The pay- per-view feature was now very similar to television in that there's now a list of pay-per-view providers which the user must make a deal with to get their pay-per-view provided. A momentum meter was also added to the wrestlers to bring in more realism in that if they give great matches, cut good interviews and participate in angles, it will increase and thus gain more overness. This helped to prevent the user from booking the same over people all the time and expect good ratings. The booking also improved in that the match purpose feature from EWR has returned and enhanced. The user must now talk to road agents about how the match has to be set up, including ways of putting people over, burying a worker and the way an actual match needs to be performed. TEW 2005 also made more features customizable with its new editable statistics for angles, storylines, locations and injuries. Its angle editor consisted of many different types such as interviews to beatdowns to celebrations and uses up to six people to participate in various roles. The storyline editor takes these angles and places them in an order the booker will need to comply to. The storyline editor was created by Phil Parent, using Georges Polti's book The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations as an inspiration. Also included was the \\"grades\\" feature. Instead of having an exact view of the stats each wrestler has along with changes, a more realistic grade feature was instead added to make the user rely on instinct for crucial decisions. TEW 05 became freeware on July 1, 2009. = Total Extreme Wrestling 2007 = Total Extreme Wrestling 2007 (TEW 2007) was officially released on December 29, 2006, with a number of new features. Whereas both TEW2004 and TEW2005 were written from scratch, TEW 2007 was being built on top of TEW 2005's source code. There were many new features, such as the ability to customise merchandise and a large amount of new contract types (short-term, etc.). = Total Extreme Wrestling 2008 = A new installment of the series, Total Extreme Wrestling 2008 (TEW 2008), was announced on the Grey Dog Software website on January 1, 2008. The game is largely based on TEW 2007, but Ryland made more than 100 changes and additions. The game allows players to import and convert their TEW 2007 databases. The game was released on June 7, 2008. The demo for the game was released on June 1, 2008. = Total Extreme Wrestling 2010 = In late 2009, it was announced that Total Extreme Wrestling 2010 (TEW 2010) would be released in early 2010. Some of the new features announced included a revamp of backstage morale, and several changes to improve the interface and to reduce the amount of time it takes to navigate through the game and to book a show. On January 20, 2010, Adam Ryland released the demo to Total Extreme Wrestling 2010. The official release happened on January 25, 2010. = Total Extreme Wrestling 2013 = At the end of July, it was announced that Total Extreme Wrestling 2013 (TEW 2013) would be released in December 2012. Some of the new features announced included an Autobooker, Fog Of War, Tribute Shows, Shoot Interviews, Legacies, and several other changes to help either make the game more realistic, and opened up more options in the database Total Extreme Wrestling 2013 was released on December 16, 2012, with the demo version available on December 9. = Total Extreme Wrestling 2016 = On January 8, 2016, it was announced that Total Extreme Wrestling 2016 (TEW 2016) was in development. The developer's journal announced that the game would feature elements that would add more realism and would also include things such as backstage cliques. On April 1, 2016, the last day of developer's journal updates, TEW 2016 was announced to have a demo release date of April 25, with a full release on May 2. While in previous versions of the demo, the player could only play through January of the game's titular year, it was announced that TEW 2016's demo would allow players to play through both January and February of any year. = Total Extreme Wrestling 2020 = On December 8, 2018, it was announced that Total Extreme Wrestling 2020 (TEW 2020) is in development with an estimate release of April 2020. The announcement stated that Ryland had completely rewritten the code before reinserting older features to make the game \\"effectively a much sharper, quicker, more intuitive, better quality piece of work\\" and promised that TEW 2020 would be \\"the biggest jump forward in terms of quality the series has ever seen\\". The developer's journal, beginning on the day of the announcement, was split into multiple phases, the first phase being announcements of new and returning features which had already been added beginning December 10, 2018 and ending July 12, 2019, while the second phase, which began July 29, 2019 and is currently ongoing, is a \\"live\\" journal discussing features currently being worked on and the current level of completion of the default game world, \\"The Cornellverse\\". Some of the highly-requested features added include playing as a company's developmental territory and giving the player more control over house shows. Another feature introduced was that of attributes, replacing the old \\"personality\\" and \\"lifestyle\\" systems. In an interview with My Games Lounge, Ryland said that \\"it was nice to do a spring clean of the code\\" as re- writing the code is what allowed him to add so many new features. On March 28, 2020 the release date of TEW 2020 was announced as April 23 for the trial version, and April 30 for the full retail version. On April 25, the game's release date was pushed back to May 14.

It is based on 1972's The Godfather. The film stars Amitabh Bachchan in the title role alongside Abhishek Bachchan as his younger son, along with Kay Kay Menon, Katrina Kaif, Kota Srinivasa Rao, Anupam Kher, Supriya Pathak and Tanisha Mukherjee. It is the first installment of Sarkar film series. Sarkar Raj, released on 6 June 2008, and Sarkar 3, released on 12 May 2017, the film was archived at the American Academy of Motion Pictures library. The blockbuster film was premi√®red at the New York Asian Film Festival. Plot Subhash Nagre (Amitabh Bachchan), who is known by his followers as Sarkar, lives in Mumbai. The opening scenes show a rape victim's father (Veerendra Saxena) approaching Sarkar for justice (which the corrupt law and order system has failed to deliver) which Sarkar promptly establishes by having the rapist beaten up by his henchmen. His son, Vishnu (Kay Kay Menon), plays a sleazy producer who is more interested in the film actress Sapna (Priyanka Kothari) than his wife Amrita (Rukhsaar Rehman). Sarkar's other, more upright son, Shankar (Abhishek Bachchan), returns from the United States with his love Pooja (Katrina Kaif) after completing his education there. Pooja's doubts about Sarkar's image cause Shankar, who firmly believes in his father's righteousness, to break up with her. One day, a Dubai-based don, Rasheed (Zakir Hussain) tries to strike a deal with Sarkar; he promptly refuses on moral grounds and also forbids him from doing it himself. Rasheed tries to eliminate Sarkar's supremacy with the help of Selvar Mani (Kota Srinivasa Rao), Sarkar's former associate, MLA Vishram Bhagat and Swami Virendra (Jeeva). Meanwhile, they trap Sarkar by assassinating a righteous, upright, Ahinsa political leader and an outspoken critic of Sarkar, Motilal Khurana (Anupam Kher), and frame Sarkar for the murder. Everyone, including Vishnu, believes that Sarkar is guilty but Shankar has deep faith in his father. Sarkar gets arrested and is imprisoned. Shankar now takes over the position of Sarkar temporarily. On learning of a plot to murder his father in prison, he approaches the police commissioner (Anant Jog) and asks him to arrange stronger security for his father, only for the commissioner to mock Shankar and his father beside not providing protection. Shankar gets a feeling that the police commissioner wants Sarkar to get murdered. Shankar and Khansaab, one of Sarkar's men, try to ask Selvar Mani for help to prevent possible murder, but Mani ultimately betrays them when he reveals that he is in an alliance with Rasheed. Rasheed prepares to kill Shankar and Khansaab but only Khansaab is killed when he decides to sacrifice himself for Shankar. By the time Shankar reaches the prison and appropriate action is taken, the attempt on Sarkar's life is already made. Sarkar is later acquitted. He remains bedridden as Shankar takes on Sarkar's enemies. Meanwhile, Selvar Mani, Swami, Vishram and Rasheed try to convince Vishnu to murder Sarkar. Vishnu was previously thrown out of Sarkar's house because he had murdered the actor who was having an affair with Sapna. Vishnu returns home pretending to have repented. When he approaches Sarkar in the dark of the night with the intent of murdering him, Shankar foils his plan and later kills him. Shankar eliminates Rasheed, Vishram and Selvar Mani. He also succeeds in making Swami his puppet. Shankar has also realised that Chief Minister Madan Rathore (Deepak Shirke) was really behind everything; Rasheed and everyone else were merely pawns. This results in legal action against the Chief Minister. The closing scenes show a woman approaching Shankar for justice to a fake encounter of her husband by the police and calling Shankar the Sarkar, while Subhash is busy with family.

The passage through the Muds is more difficult, and so most visitors choose to continue through the Variegated Passage, which requires the use of small boats. Cross Cave continues into New Cross Cave (). In the direction from the entrance to the cave, the Variegated Passage is the left gallery of Cross Cave at the confluence with the Muds at Cavalry.

The Wolverine double was to act as the bait and Elsie-Dee (who outwardly appears to be a 5-year-old girl) was supposed to trap Wolverine in a burning building where she would detonate with sufficient force to kill him. The plan fails because one of Pierce's henchmen, Bonebreaker, accidentally gives Elsie-Dee the maximum artificial intelligence one of Pierce's automatons was capable of, instead of the intended intellect of a 5-year-old. As a result, Elsie-Dee eventually finds a way to defuse her detonation sequence. She also enhances the primitive intelligence of her counterpart, giving him intelligence beyond even hers.

T-Mobile Center has effectively replaced Kemper Arena, which was built in 1974 just a few miles away in the southern portion of the West Bottoms neighborhood. Additionally, the College Basketball Experience, which includes the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, is connected to and directly north of T-Mobile Center. T-Mobile Center hosted the Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament in 2008 and has done so every year since 2010. It also hosted the first and second rounds of the 2009 and 2013 NCAA Men's Tournaments, as well as the regional rounds of the 2017 NCAA Men's Tournament and the 2010 NCAA Women's Tournament; it also hosted a 2019 NCAA Men's Division I regional.

The city of Kansas City has entered into discussions with the National Hockey League (NHL) and the National Basketball Association (NBA) about possible expansion or relocation of a professional hockey and/or basketball franchise for the arena; however, neither the NHL nor the NBA have yet to approve a team to play in T-Mobile Center. Details T-Mobile Center entrance from Grand Boulevard in 2008. Ground was broken for the arena on June 24, 2005, and construction completed on October 11, 2007. The final design, by the Downtown Arena Design Team (a collaboration of the architectural firms Populous, 360 Architecture, Rafael Architects, and Ellerbe Becket), was selected in August 2005. The construction manager responsible for the entire project was M.A. Mortenson Company, based out of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The complete exterior glass facade system, all metal panels for the adjacent buildings and all accessory metal cladding was custom designed, detailed and supplied by Overgaard Ltd. Hong Kong to Architectural Wall Systems, the Des Moines, Iowa based glazing contractor who installed the building envelope.

Because of Kansas City's proximity to the University of Kansas in neighboring Lawrence, Jayhawk fans who fill the arena for Big 12 Tournament games refer to the arena as \\"Allen Fieldhouse East\\" in reference to Kansas' home arena in Lawrence, Allen Fieldhouse. However, due to Iowa State's recent Big 12 Tournament success ‚Äì winning four tournament championships in a six-year span ‚Äì and their fanbase's huge migration to the annual event, the T-Mobile Center is referred to by Iowa State fans as \\"Hilton South\\", after Iowa State's home venue, Hilton Coliseum.

The airport is located southwest of the city centre, at Graniczna street 190. It has one runway, one passenger terminal, one cargo terminal and one general aviation terminal. Wroc≈Çaw airport is also often used by Polish Air Force and US Air Force. History =Early years= The airport was built in 1938 as Flugplatz Breslau-Sch√∂ngarten Airport for German military purposes before World War II, when the city was still part of Germany. It was the site of a military aviation school, the Luftkriegsschule Breslau-Sch√∂ngarten, later renamed Luftkriegsschule 5. Among the Luftwaffe units stationed here just before the war were the Sturzkampfgeschwader 77, Kampfgeschwader 76, and Kampfgeschwader 1 \\"Hindenburg\\". It was operated briefly by Soviet forces following the war before being used for civilian purposes in 1945. Services were operated to Warsaw, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Pozna≈Ñ and Katowice. By 1992 destinations also included Krak√≥w, Rzesz√≥w, Gda≈Ñsk, Szczecin and Koszalin. 'Port Lotniczy Wroc≈Çaw S. A.' was established as a company in January 1992 and Wroc≈Çaw airport assets operated by the state-owned Polish Airports authority were transferred to the company in January 1993. The first international flights were inaugurated in January 1993, serving Frankfurt, Germany. Significant airport improvements have been completed in the late twentieth century. A new international departures terminal was opened in May 1997 followed by a new domestic terminal in November 1998. =Developments since the 2000s= A cargo terminal, international arrivals hall, and installation of a new meteorological system were completed in 1999; new fire station and apron extensions in 2000. A new air traffic control tower and duty-free area followed in 2001. On December 6, 2005 the airport was renamed after the famous astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (in Polish: Miko≈Çaj Kopernik), who in Wroc≈Çaw studied and received a scholarship, and in the years 1503-1538 was a scholaster of the Wroc≈Çaw Collegiate Holy Cross and St. Bartholomew on the Cathedral Island. The airport's new name is Copernicus Airport Wroc≈Çaw (Port Lotniczy Wroc≈Çaw im. Miko≈Çaja Kopernika). Terminal extensions were officially opened on the same day, increasing the airport's capacity to 750,000 passengers per year. This capacity was quickly exceeded by several hundred thousand (in the first 9 months of 2007 the airport served 972,505 passengers) so the existing terminal space was expanded by to alleviate some of the congestion, but more importantly make the terminal facilities conform to the requirements of the Schengen Agreement, which was implemented at Poland's airports on 31 March 2008. On 19 July 2006, the architectural firm JSK was chosen to design a significant airport expansion. This includes plans for a new passenger terminal (eventually, after several stages of expansion, the airport will be able to handle 7 million passengers yearly) and assorted taxiway, apron and navigation equipment improvements (ILS). Also, car parking will be expanded to 1,000 spaces. The first stage, increasing the passenger capacity to 3,5 million yearly, officially opened on February 29, 2012. However, the new terminal opened to passengers on Sunday March 11, 2012. In May 2014, the HEMS (Helicopter Emergency Medical Service) base for Air Ambulance (pl: Lotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe) was launched at the airport. in 2015 Ryanair announced that it has selected Copernicus Airport Wroc≈Çaw (Port Lotniczy Wroc≈Çaw im. Miko≈Çaja Kopernika) for its aircraft maintenance base. The construction of the hangar to fit 2 C-type aircraft (Boeing 737) was finished in June 2017. The airport has upgraded to ILS system from category I to category II in April 2016. Until it was reformed (30.06.2010), the 3rd Air Base also used the main runway of the airport, and currently the 8th Transport Aviation Base, whose barracks complex adjoins the airport. Due to the existence of NATO garrisons nearby (Boles≈Çawiec, ≈öwiƒôtosz√≥w, ≈ªaga≈Ñ), in which US troops have been stationed as part of the Atlantic Resolve operation since January 2017, Wroclaw airport is very often used by US Air Force transport aircraft (inter alia Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, Lockheed C-130 Hercules, Lockheed C-5 Galaxy). On September 23, 2019, in New York, the presidents of the USA and Poland signed a declaration on the deepening of defense cooperation, in which Wroc≈Çaw Airport was designated as the seat of the US Army air transport base. The District Infrastructure Board from Wroc≈Çaw in July 2020 announced a tender for the preparation of pre-project documentation regarding the preparation of infrastructure for the Aerial Port of Debarkation (APOD) at the Wroc≈Çaw airport.Jak bƒôdzie wyglƒÖda≈Ça polsko-ameryka≈Ñska baza we Wroc≈Çawiu? From September 14, 2020, the airport serves a regular cargo connection Wroc≈Çaw - Cologne Bonn Airport carried out by ATR 72 plane by Swiftair for UPS. Facilities The airport operates modern domestic, international and cargo terminals. The international terminal contains a duty free area in the international departures hall. The cargo terminal, located beside the fire station and air traffic control tower, has a storage area of , a bonded warehouse, freezer and radioactive materials warehouse.

It began as a private park for the residents of houses surrounding it before Manchester acquired it in 1867 and turned it into a public park with an ornamental pond and a bandstand. It contains a cenotaph commemorating the dead of the Eighth Ardwicks, a former unit of the Territorial Army belonging to the Manchester Regiment. The old drill hall at one end of the park is still used by volunteer soldiers. The other end of the park contains a large boulder, a glacial erratic. The Church of St Thomas, on the north side of Ardwick Green, was consecrated as a chapel of ease in 1741. It was rebuilt and extended in the course of the late eighteenth century, and acquired a campanile tower in the 1830s. Many of the grand buildings have been demolished, including the Ardwick Empire Music Hall (later Manchester Hippodrome) at the eastern end. The business premises of Thomas Brown, surveyor and Resident Engineer for the construction of the Peak Forest Canal, were in Manchester and by 1841 he was living in Allerton Place at 16 Ardwick Green.

The southern terminus of the route is at PA 61 in Centralia. The northern terminus is at U.S. Route 220 (US 220) in Laporte. The route heads north through Columbia County and passes through Catawissa before it crosses the Susquehanna River to Bloomsburg. In Bloomsburg, PA 42 forms a concurrency with US 11 and has an interchange with Interstate 80 (I-80). Past Bloomsburg, the route continues north through Millville and runs through the eastern part of Lycoming County. PA 42 heads into Sullivan County and runs concurrent with US 220 between Beech Glen and Muncy Valley before it loops west through Eagles Mere and reaches its terminus in Laporte. PA 42 was originally designated in 1927 to run from US 1 in Oxford north to the New York border in South Waverly. When first designated, the route ran concurrent with US 120 (now PA 61) between Reading and Centralia and US 220 between Laporte and South Waverly. In 1928, the concurrencies with US 120 and US 220 were removed, splitting PA 42 into two sections. The southern section ran from the Maryland border south of Chrome north to US 222 (now US 222 Bus.) in Reading while the northern section ran from US 120 (now PA 61) in Centralia north to US 220 in Laporte. In 1935, the portion of PA 42 between Oxford and Reading was replaced by US 122 (now PA 10), with the northern terminus of the southern section cut back to US 1 in Barnsley. The southern section of PA 42 was decommissioned in the 1940s, with PA 272 replacing the portion between the Maryland border and Chrome. Route description =Columbia County= PA 42 south in Weiser State Forest PA 42 begins at an intersection with PA 61 in the borough of Centralia in Columbia County, which has largely been abandoned because of the Centralia mine fire. From PA 61, the route heads north on two-lane undivided Locust Avenue. The road passes through abandoned areas of the town which have been overgrown with trees. The route turns east and crosses into Conyngham Township, becoming South Main Street and heading into forested areas. PA 42 widens to a four-lane road and heads to the northwest, passing through the residential community of Aristes, where it narrows back to two lanes. The road curves to the northeast and becomes Numidia Drive, heading into the Weiser State Forest and turning to the northwest as it crosses Big Mountain. The route turns west and northwest through more dense forests, passing to the east of Shamokin Reservoir. Continuing to the west-northwest, PA 42 enters Locust Township as it crosses Little Mountain, leaving the state forest and turning to the north. The road heads into open agricultural areas with some woods and residences. The route briefly turns northwest before heading north again and passing through the community of Numidia. PA 42 curves to the northwest as it heads through more rural areas, crossing the Roaring Creek and continuing into Catawissa Township. The road runs through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes, gaining a second northbound lane. The route becomes a four-lane road in a wooded area before turning into a three-lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes. PA 42 comes to an intersection with PA 487, at which point that route joins PA 42 for a concurrency, with the two routes heading north through more woodland as a two-lane road. The road crosses the Catawissa Creek into the borough of Catawissa and becomes Mill Street, heading northwest into residential areas. PA 42 splits from PA 487 by heading west-northwest on Main Street, heading through the commercial downtown of Catawissa. The road crosses Norfolk Southern's Sunbury Line before heading across the Susquehanna River, at which point the road becomes Rupert Drive and heads into Montour Township. Here, the route turns north and crosses the North Shore Railroad. PA 42 runs through wooded areas immediately to the west of the railroad tracks with the Susquehanna River a short distance to the east. The road turns north- northwest away from the railroad tracks and heads through the residential community of Rupert. The route passes through more woodland with some homes before reaching an interchange with US 11. PA 42 north of Millville At this point, PA 42 heads northeast concurrent with US 11 on four-lane divided Montour Boulevard, crossing the Fishing Creek into the town of Bloomsburg. Immediately after, the route splits from US 11 at another interchange to the west of the Bloomsburg Fair fairgrounds, heading northwest on four-lane divided Mall Boulevard and crossing the Fishing Creek back into Montour Township. The road heads near residential areas and narrows into a two-lane undivided road, crossing a stream into Hemlock Township. PA 42 heads through wooded areas with some nearby commercial development, turning to the north and passing near some farmland, widening back into a four-lane divided highway. The road enters commercial areas and comes to an interchange with I-80, intersecting the southern terminus of PA 44 at the north end of the interchange. The route passes more businesses, heading to the west of the Columbia Colonnade (formerly Columbia Mall). PA 42 narrows into a two-lane undivided road and heads northeast through agricultural areas. The route turns north onto Millville Road and runs through wooded areas to the west of Little Fishing Creek. The road curves to the north-northwest and heads through more woodland with some farm fields and homes, continuing to the west of the creek. PA 42 heads back to the north and continues through more rural areas, crossing into Madison Township and turning to the west near Mordansville, becoming an unnamed road. The road turns back to the north and heads through farmland with some homes, crossing the Little Fishing Creek into Mount Pleasant Township. The route curves to the northwest and runs through more wooded areas with some farms and residences to the northeast of the creek, entering Greenwood Township and turning to the north, passing through the residential community of Eyers Grove. PA 42 continues through agricultural areas with some woods and homes, turning north-northwest and crossing into the borough of Millville.

In the center of town, the route intersects PA 254 and becomes North State Street, heading through more residential areas. PA 42 passes a few businesses before turning north and heading back into Greenwood Township. Here, the road again runs along the east bank of the Little Fishing Creek as it becomes an unnamed and heads through rural areas of residential and commercial development, passing through Iola. The route heads north- northeast into a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes and intersects the eastern terminus of PA 442. PA 42 crosses the creek into Pine Township and heads north through Sereno, running through more farms and woods with occasional residences before heading into more forested areas. Farther north, the road passes through a mix of farmland and woodland with a few homes. =Lycoming and Sullivan counties= A view of PA 42 through a forested area PA 42 enters Jordan Township in Lycoming County and continues through more agricultural and wooded areas with some residences. The road heads into more forested areas with a few homes and passes west of the community of Unityville, turning northwest and intersecting PA 118. The route curves back to the north and runs through more woodland with some farm fields and homes. PA 42 continues through agricultural areas and heads into Franklin Township, turning to the northwest and passing through more farmland and woodland with a few residences. The road heads through woods as it comes to a junction with the northern terminus of PA 239. The route continues west-northwest through more farms and woods with homes, passing through North Mountain. The road turns more to the northwest and briefly passes through a corner of Penn Township. PA 42 heads into Davidson Township in Sullivan County, turning to the north and passing through wooded areas with some fields and homes. The road curves to the northwest as it heads through forests, turning to the west and coming to an intersection with US 220 in Beech Glen. At this point, the route turns north to form a concurrency with US 220 on the Appalachian Throughway, heading through a mix of farmland and woodland with a few residences. The road crosses the Muncy Creek and PA 42 splits from US 220 in Muncy Valley by heading northwest on an unnamed road. The route runs north through forested areas, crossing the Trout Run into Shrewsbury Township. The road heads northwest before turning to the north, continuing through dense forests. PA 42 passes through wooded areas with a few homes, curving more to the northeast and becoming Eagles Mere Avenue.

PA 42 heads into Laporte Township and turns to the northeast, passing to the west of Celestial Lake. The road turns to the east and continues through forested areas with some homes, heading into the borough of Laporte. Here, PA 42 becomes Main Street and passes homes with a few businesses before ending at another intersection with US 220. History Southern terminus of PA 42 in Centralia at PA 61 in 2002 Following the passage of the Sproul Road Bill in 1911, what would become PA 42 was designated as Legislative Route 274 between Oxford and Reading, Legislative Route 160 between Reading and Hamburg, Legislative Route 141 between Hamburg and Schuylkill Haven, Legislative Route 140 between Schuylkill Haven and Pottsville, Legislative Route 161 between Pottsvile and Centralia, Legislative Route 183 between Centralia and Bloomsburg, Legislative Route 239 between Bloomsburg and Unityville, Legislative Route 17 between Laporte and Towanda, and Legislative Route 287 between Towanda and South Waverly. By 1926, the entire length of Legislative Route 274 was paved except between Compass and south of Honey Brook and Honey Brook and Morgantown. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the road between Reading and Centralia was designated as part of US 120, a route that ran from Philadelphia northwest to Erie, while the road between Laporte and South Waverly was designated as part of US 711, a route that ran from Northumberland north to South Waverly. At this time, the entire length of US 120 between US 22 in Reading and Centralia was paved while all of US 711 between Laporte and South Waverly was paved except for the stretch between Ringdale and New Albany. In 1927, PA 42 was designated to run from US 1/PA 12 (now PA 472) in Oxford north to the New York border in South Waverly. The route headed north Reading and ran concurrent with US 120 from Reading to Centralia. From Centralia, PA 42 headed north to Laporte and ran concurrent with US 220 (which replaced US 711) from Laporte to South Waverly. In 1928, PA 42 was removed from its concurrencies with US 120 (now PA 61) between Reading and Centralia and US 220 between Laporte and South Waverly, splitting the route into two sections. The southern section of PA 42 ran from the Maryland border south of Chrome north to US 222/PA 73 (now US 222 Bus.) in Reading while the northern section of PA 42 ran from US 120 (now PA 61) in Centralia north to US 220 in Laporte. At this time, the entire length of the southern section of PA 42 was paved. The northern section of PA 42 was paved between Centralia and Aristes, from the south end of the US 11 concurrency in Bloomsburg to short distance north of Bloomsburg, between Millville and Iola, and between the south end of the US 220 concurrency in Beech Glen and Eagles Mere, while the route was under construction between Catawissa and US 11 in Bloomsburg and between Mordansville and Millville. By 1930, PA 42 was paved between Little Mountain and US 11 in Bloomsburg and between Mordansville and Millville. In May 1935, the section of PA 42 between Oxford and Reading was replaced by US 122 (now PA 10). As a result, the northern terminus of the southern section of PA 42 was cut back to US 1 (Baltimore Pike) in Barnsley, having been removed from a concurrency with US 1 along Baltimore Pike between Barnsley and Oxford. By 1940, PA 42 was paved between Aristes and Little Mountain, between north of Bloomsburg and Mordansville, between Iola and the border between Columbia and Lycoming counties, between PA 539 (now PA 239) near North Mountain and US 220 in Beech Glen, for a short distance north of Eagles Mere, and for a short distance south of Laporte. In addition, the route was improved between the border between Columbia and Lycoming counties and the PA 642 junction (now PA 118) by 1940. The section along the US 11 concurrency in Bloomsburg was upgraded to a multilane road by 1940. The southern section of PA 42 was decommissioned in the 1940s, with the portion between the Maryland border and Chrome replaced by an extended PA 272 while the section between Chrome and Barnsley is now Barnsley Road. By 1950, the entire length of PA 42 was paved. In the 1950s, PA 42 was upgraded to a multilane road between Centralia and Aristes. PA 42 was widened to a divided highway between the south end of the US 11 concurrency and the I-80 interchange in Bloomsburg in the 1960s. Major intersections PA 42 Truck Pennsylvania Route 42 Truck (PA 42 Truck) is a truck route of PA 42 in Sullivan County, bypassing the section of PA 42 between Muncy Valley and Laporte. While this stretch of PA 42 winds through state forest land, trucks are designated to follow the much simpler alignment of US 220, with which PA 42 Truck is cosigned for its entire length. The truck route also terminates at the same intersection as its parent route.

Glasses are non-crystalline amorphous solids that are commonly composed of silica-based materials with other minor additives. Compared to soda-lime glass (commonly used, as in windows or bottles), Bioglass 45S5 contains less silica and higher amounts of calcium and phosphorus. The 45S5 name signifies glass with 45 weight % of SiO2 and 5:1 molar ratio of calcium to phosphorus. This high ratio of calcium to phosphorus promotes formation of apatite crystals; calcium and silica ions can act as crystallization nuclei. Lower Ca:P ratios do not bond to bone. Bioglass 45S5's specific composition is optimal in biomedical applications because of its similar composition to that of hydroxyapatite, the mineral component of bone. This similarity provides Bioglass' ability to be integrated with living bone. The morphology of bioglass using SEM, sintered at 900¬∞C This composition of bioactive glass is comparatively soft in comparison to other glasses. It can be machined, preferably with diamond tools, or ground to powder. Bioglass has to be stored in a dry environment, as it readily absorbs moisture and reacts with it. Bioglass 45S5 is the first formulation of an artificial material that was found to chemically bond with bone, and its discovery lead to a series of other bioactive glasses. One of its main medical advantages is its biocompatibility, seen in its ability to avoid an immune reaction and fibrous encapsulation. Its primary application is the repair of bone injuries or defects too large to be regenerated by the natural process. The first successful surgical use of Bioglass 45S5 was in replacement of ossicles in the middle ear, as a treatment of conductive hearing loss. Other uses include cones for implantation into the jaw following a tooth extraction. Composite materials made of Bioglass 45S5 and patient's own bone can be used for bone reconstruction. Further research is being conducted for the development of new processing techniques to allow for more applications of Bioglass. History Bioglass is important to the field of biomaterials as one of the first completely synthetic materials that seamlessly bonds to bone. It was developed by Larry L. Hench in the late 1960s. The idea for the material came to him during a bus ride in 1967. While working as an assistant professor at the University of Florida, Dr. Hench decided to attend the U.S. Army Materials Research Conference held in Sagamore, New York, where he planned to talk about radiation resistant electronic materials. He began discussing his research with a fellow traveller on the bus, Colonel Klinker, who had recently returned to the United States after serving as an Army medical supply officer in Vietnam. After listening to Dr. Hench's description of his research, the Colonel asked, ‚ÄúIf you can make a material that will survive exposure to high energy radiation can you make a material that will survive exposure to the human body?‚Äù Klinker then went on to describe the amputations that he had witnessed in Vietnam, which resulted from the body's rejection of metal and plastic implants. Hench realized that there was a need for a novel material that could form a living bond with tissues in the body. When Hench returned to Florida after the conference, he submitted a proposal to the U.S. Army Medical Research and Design Command. He received funding in 1968, and in November 1969 Hench began to synthesize small rectangles of what he called 45S5 glass. Ted Greenlee, Assistant Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of Florida, implanted them in rat femurs at the VA Hospital in Gainesville. Six weeks later, Greenlee called Hench asking, \\"Larry, what are those samples you gave me? They will not come out of the bone. I have pulled on them, I have pushed on them, I have cracked the bone and they are still bonded in place.\\" With this first successful experiment, Bioglass was born and the first compositions studied. Hench published his first paper on the subject in 1971 in the Journal of Biomedical Materials Research, and his lab continued to work on the project for the next 10 years with continued funding from the U.S. Army. By 2006, there were over 500 papers published on the topic of bioactive glasses from different laboratories and institutions around the world. The first successful surgical use of Bioglass 45S5 was in replacement of ossicles in middle ear as a treatment of conductive hearing loss, and the material continues to be used in bone reconstruction applications today.  Applications  Bioactive glass offers good osteoconductivity and bioactivity, it can deliver cells and is biodegradable. This makes it an excellent candidate to be used in tissue engineering applications. Although this material is known to be brittle, it is still used extensively to enhance the growth of bone since new forms of bioactive glasses are based on borate and borosilicate compositions. Bioglass can also be doped with varying quantities of elements like copper, zinc, or strontium which can allow the growth and formation of healthy bone. The formation of neocartilage can also be induced with bioactive glass by using an in vitro culture of chondrocyte-seeded hydrogels and can serve as a subchondral substrate for tissue-engineered osteochondral constructs. The borate-based bioactive glass has controllable degradation rates in order to match the rate at which actual bone is formed. Bone formation has been shown to enhance when using this type of material. When implanted into rabbit femurs, the 45S5 bioactive glass showed that it could induce bone proliferation at a much quicker rate than synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA). 45S5 glass can also be osteoconductive and osteoinductive because it allows for new bone growth along the bone-implant interface as well as within the bone-implant interface. Studies have been conducted to determine the process by which it can induce bone formation. It was shown that 45S5 glass degrades and releases sodium ions, as well as soluble silica, the combination of all these ions is said to produce new bone. Borate bioglass has proven that it can support cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro and in vivo. It also has shown that it is suitable to be used as a substrate for drug release when treating bone infection. However, there has been a concern as to whether or not the release of boron into a solution as borate ions will be toxic to the body. It has been shown that in static cell culture conditions, borate glasses were toxic to cells, but not in dynamic culture conditions. Another area in which bioactive glass has been investigated to use is enamel reconstruction, which has proven to be a difficult task in the field of dentistry. Enamel is made up of a very organized hierarchical microstructure of carbonated hydroxyapatite nanocrystals. It has been reported that Bioglass 45S5-phosphoric acid paste can be used to form an interaction layer that can obstruct dentinal tubule orifices and can therefore be useful in the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity lesions. This material in an aqueous environment could have an antibacterial property that is advantageous in periodontal surgical procedures. In a study done with 45S5 Bioglass, control biofilms of S. sanguis were grown on inactive glass particulates and the biofilm grown on the Bioglass was significantly lower than those that were on the inactive glass. It was concluded that Bioglass can reduce surface bacterial formation, which could benefit post-surgical periodontal wound healing. The most effective antibacterial bioactive glass is S53P4, which has exhibited a growth-inhibitory effect on the pathogens that was tested on it. Bioactive glasses that are sol-gel derived, such as CaPSiO and CaPSiO II, have also exhibited antibacterial property. Studies done with S. epidermidis and E. coli cultured with bioactive glass have shown that the 45S5 bioactive glass have a very high antibacterial resistance. It was also observed in the experiment that there were needle-like bioglass debris which could have ruptured the cell walls of the bacteria and rendered them inactive. Bioactive glass was applied to medical devices to help restore the hearing to a deaf patient using Bioglass 45S5 in 1984. The patient went deaf due to at ear infection that degraded two of the three bones in her middle ear. An implant was designed to replace the damaged bone and carry sound from the eardrum to the cochlea, restoring the patient's hearing. Before this material was available, plastics and metals would be used because they did not produce a reaction in the body; however, they eventually failed because tissue would grow around them after implantation. A prosthesis made up of Bioglass 45S5 was made to fit the patient and most of the prosthesis that were made were able to maintain functionality after 10 years. The Endosseous Ridge Maintenance Implant made of Bioglass 45S5 was another device that could be inserted into tooth extraction sites that would repair tooth roots and allow for a stable ridge for dentures. This material has also been used in jaw and orthopedics applications, in this way it dissolves and can stimulate the natural bone to repair itself. GlaxoSmithKline is using this material as an active ingredient in toothpaste under the commercial name NovaMin, which can help repair tiny holes and decrease tooth sensitivity. More advanced fluoride-containing formulations have been developed, which provide stronger and longer-lasting protection against sensitivity. The inclusion of fluoride in formulations, such as BioMin, results in faster formation of a hardier apatite, which shields the teeth from sensitivity for up to 12 hours.

The reaction with surrounding physiological fluid at the surface of Bioglass is shown in first two steps, and the formation of new bone is shown in the last two stages. When implanted, Bioglass 45S5 reacts with the surrounding physiological fluid, causing the formation of a hydroxyl carbonated apatite (HCA) layer at the material surface. The HCA layer has a similar composition to hydroxyapatite, the mineral phase of bone, a quality which allows for strong interaction and integration with bone. The process by which this reaction occurs can be separated into 12 steps. The first 5 steps are related to the Bioglass response to the environment within the body, and occur rapidly at the material surface over several hours. Reaction steps 6-10 detail the reaction of the body to the integration of the biomaterial, and the process of integration with bone. These stages occur over the scale of several weeks or months. The steps are separated as follows: # Alkali ions (ex. Na+ and Ca2+) on the glass surface rapidly exchange with hydrogen ions or hydronium from surrounding bodily fluids. The reaction below shows this process, which causes hydrolysis of silica groups. As this occurs, the pH of the solution increases. #:Si‚éØO‚éØNa+ \\\\+ H+ \\\\+ OH‚àí ‚Üí Si‚éØOH+ \\\\+ Na+ (aq) + OH‚àí # Due to an increase in the hydroxyl (OH‚àí) concentration at the surface (a result of step 1), a dissolution of the silica glass network occurs, seen by the breaking of Si‚éØO‚éØSi bonds. Soluble silica is transformed to the form of Si(OH)4 and silanols (Si‚éØOH) creation occurs at the material surface. The reaction occurring in this stage is shown below: #:Si‚éØO‚éØSi + H2O‚Üí Si‚éØOH + OH‚éØSi # The silanol groups at the material surface condense and re-polymerize to form a silica-gel layer at the surface of Bioglass. As a result of the first steps, the surface contains very little alkali content. The condensation reaction is shown below: #:Si‚éØOH + Si‚éØOH ‚Üí Si‚éØO‚éØSi #Amorphous Ca2+ and PO43‚àí gather at the silica-rich layer (created in step 3) from both the surrounding bodily fluid and the bulk of the Bioglass. This creates a layer composed primarily of CaO‚éØP2O5 on top of the silica layer. #The CaO‚éØP2O5 film created in step 4 incorporates OH‚àí and CO32‚àí from the bodily solution, causing it to crystallize. This layer is called a mixed carbonated hydroxyl apatite (HCA). #Growth factors adsorb (adsorption) to the surface of Bioglass due to its structural and chemical similarities to hydroxyapatite. #Adsorbed growth factors cause the activation of M2 macrophages. M2 macrophages tend to promote wound healing and initiate the migration of progenitor cells to an injury site. In contrast, M1 macrophages become activated when a non-biocompatible material is implanted, triggering an inflammatory response. #Triggered by M2 macrophage activation, mesenchymal stem cells and osteoprogenitor cells migrate to the Bioglass surface and attach to the HCA layer. #Stem cells and osteoprogenitor cells at the HCA surface differentiate to become osteogenic cells typically present in bone tissue, particularly osteoblasts. #The attached and differentiated osteoblasts generate and deposit extracellular matrix (ECM) components, primarily type I collagen, the main protein component of bone. #The collagen ECM becomes mineralized as normally occurs in native bone. Nanoscale hydroxyapatite crystals form a layered structure with the deposited collagen at the surface of the implant. #Following these reactions, bone growth continues as the newly recruited cells continue to function and facilitate tissue growth and repair. The Bioglass implant continues to degrade and be converted to new ECM material.  Manufacturing  There are two main manufacturing techniques that are used for the synthesis of Bioglass. The first is melt quench synthesis, which is the conventional glass-making technology used by Larry Hench when he first manufactured the material in 1969. This method includes melting a mixture of oxides such as SiO2, Na2O, CaO and P2O5 at high temperatures generally above 1100-1300 ¬∞C. Platinum or platinum alloy crucibles are used to avoid contamination, which would interfere with the product's chemical reactivity in organism. Annealing is a crucial step in forming bulk parts, due to high thermal expansion of the material. Heat treatment of Bioglass reduces the volatile alkali metal oxide content and precipitates apatite crystals in the glass matrix. However, the scaffolds that result from melt quench techniques are much less porous compared to other manufacturing methods, which may lead to defects in tissue integration when implanted in vivo. The second method is sol-gel synthesis of Bioglass. This process is carried out at much lower temperatures than the traditional melting methods. It involves the creation of a solution (sol), which is composed of metal-organic and metal salt precursors. A gel is then formed through hydrolysis and condensation reactions, and it undergoes thermal treatment for drying, oxide formation, and organic removal. Because of the lower fabrication temperatures used in this method, there is a greater level of control on the composition and homogeneity of the product. In addition, sol-gel bioglasses have much higher porosity, which leads to a greater surface area and degree of integration in the body. Newer methods include flame and microwave synthesis of Bioglass, which has been gaining attention in recent years. Flame synthesis works by baking the powders directly in a flame reactor. Microwave synthesis is a rapid and low-cost powder synthesis method in which precursors are dissolved in water, transferred to an ultrasonic bath, and irradiated.  Shortcomings  A setback to using Bioglass 45S5 is that it is difficult to process into porous 3D scaffolds. These porous scaffolds are usually prepared by sintering glass particles that are already formed into the 3D geometry and allowing them to bond to the particles into a strong glass phase made up of a network of pores. Since this particular type of bioglass cannot fully sinter by viscous flow above its Tg, and its Tg is close to the onset of crystallization, it is hard to sinter this material into a dense network. 45S5 glass also has a slow degradation and rate of conversion to an HA-like material. This setback makes it more difficult for the degradation rate of the scaffold to coincide with the rate of tissue formation. Another limitation is that the biological environment can be easily influenced by its degradation. Increases in the sodium and calcium ions and changing pH is due to its degradation. However, the roles of these ions and their toxicity to the body have not been fully researched.  Methods of improvement  Several studies have investigated methods to improve the mechanical strength and toughness of Bioglass 45S5. These include creating polymer-glass composites, which combine the bioactivity of Bioglass with the relative flexibility and wear resistance of different polymers. Another solution is coating a metallic implant with Bioglass, which takes advantage of the mechanical strength of the implant's bulk material while retaining bioactive effects at the surface. Some of the most notable modifications have used various forms of carbon to improve the properties of 45S5 glass. For example, Touri et al. developed a method to incorporate carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into the structure without interfering with the material's bioactive properties. CNTs were chosen because of their large aspect ratio and high strength. By synthesizing Bioglass 45S5 on a CNT scaffold, the researchers were able to create a composite that more than doubled the compressive strength and the elastic modulus when compared to the pure glass. Another study carried out by Li et al. looked into different properties, such as the fracture toughness and wear resistance of Bioglass 45S5. The authors loaded graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) into the glass structure through a spark plasma sintering method. Graphene was chosen because of its high specific surface area and strength, as well as its cytocompatibility and lack of interference with Bioglass 45S5's bioactivity. The composites that were created in this experiment achieved a fracture toughness of more than double the control. In addition, the tribological properties of the material were greatly improved.

Legend According to the Chronicon Helveticum by Aegidius Tschudi (1505‚Äì1572), in 1307 Gessler raised a pole in the market square of Altdorf, placed his hat atop it, and ordered all the townsfolk to bow before it. Tell, whose marksmanship and pride were legendary, publicly refused. Gessler's cruel wrath was tempered by his curiosity to test Tell's skill, so he gave Tell the option of either being executed or shooting an apple off his son's head in one try. Tell succeeded in splitting the apple with his arrow, saving his own life. When Gessler asked why he had readied two arrows, he lied and replied that it was out of habit. After being assured that he wouldn't be killed, Tell finally admitted that the second was intended for the tyrant if his son was harmed. Gessler, enraged, had Tell arrested and taken by boat across Lake Lucerne to K√ºssnacht to spend the life he had saved in a dungeon. A sudden fierce storm made the crew terrified and, since William Tell was a better sailor, they handed the wheel to him but, instead of heading towards the dungeon, he escaped to shore. There he ambushed and killed Gessler with an arrow, launching the young Confederacy's rebellion against Austrian rule. Historical account The coat of arms of the Gessler family. A Gessler family of ministeriales is documented from the 13th century onwards; however at Wiggwil in the Aargau region, the original homeland of the Habsburgs and the basis for their rise after the extinction of the Swabian House of Hohenstaufen. The Gesslers profited from the election of Count Rudolph of Habsburg as King of the Romans in 1273 and his acquisition of the Austrian and Styrian duchies after the victory over King Ottokar II of Bohemia at the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. The White Book of Sarnen, written around 1470, mentioned one gesler who was vogt at Uri and Schwyz. In the late 14th century one Hermann Gessler ruled the domain of Gr√ºningen (which today belongs to Z√ºrich); the domain of Gr√ºningen had been pawned to the Gessler family by the House of Habsburg. His stern measures against the peasant population made the name Gessler an epitome of tyranny. No sources that predate the earliest references to the Tell legend of the late 15th century refer to a bailiff Gessler in central Switzerland, and it is presumed that no such person existed. Gessler's role in Tell's story is analogous to that of King Ni√∞ung in the story of Egil in the √ûi√∞rekssaga. In Schiller's play Friedrich Schiller perpetuated the figure in his 1804 drama Wilhelm Tell. In the Tale Spinners For Children recording of the story, Gessler is working under orders from the Emperor of Austria, who wishes to deliberately provoke the people of Switzerland into a rebellion which will serve as an excuse for Austria to invade Switzerland.

The son of Isaac Driver and Adi Asenaca Mairara, Siwatibau was born on 4 November 1940 in Tukavesi Village in Buca Bay, Cakaudrove Province, but grew up in Buca, the village of his mother, who was of chiefly rank. He was educated at Queen Victoria School and Suva Grammar School, graduating as the Dux in 1958. In 1963, he graduated from New Zealand's the University of Auckland with a Master's degree in Science, with a major in mathematics and physics. While at Auckland University, he had met his future wife, Suliana Kaloumaira, a native of Moturiki Island. They were married in 1966. They had three sons (Simione Ramacake, Ropate Rakula, and Atunaisa Taleasiga), and one daughter (Asenaca Tania Tuivanuavou). Two sons became IT engineers and one a lawyer. His daughter became a banker. After working as a meteorologist in Nadi, Siwatibau was posted to the Meteorology Office in Wellington, New Zealand, where he decided to study economics at Victoria University. His study was interrupted by a transfer to the Economic Planning office in Suva, but he was able to continue his studies at Sussex University in the United Kingdom, graduating in 1968 with a Master of Arts degree in Economics. When Fiji gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1970, Siwatibau was appointed the first native-born Director of Economic Planning. In 1972, he became Permanent Secretary of Finance, and also joined the University of the South Pacific as a government representative on the institution's ruling body, the University Council. From 1978 to 1980, he served as an Alternate Director of the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C., and on his return to Fiji, he was appointed Local General Manager of the Central Monetary Authority in 1981. In 1984 he became the first Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji. In 1988, he left Fiji for six months to pursue a fellowship at the Australian National University, and on his return, he was appointed Head of EPOC (the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Pacific Operations Centre in Vanuatu, a position he held until 2000. While still at EPOC, he was appointed Pro-Chancellor of the University of the South Pacific in 1998, and was promoted to Vice-Chancellor in 2001. The appointment generated some controversy, with some university staff having supported Rajesh Chandra for the post. In 2000, George Speight, who led a civilian insurrection against the elected government of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, proposed Siwatibau for the post of Prime Minister. Siwatibau was not a party to the plot and had no apparent sympathy with it, but Speight may have wanted a respected name to lend legitimacy to his rebel government. Savenaca Siwatibau died of lung cancer at Christchurch Hospital in New Zealand on 3 October 2003. He was 62. His family and friends remembered him as a committed Christian who had a strong sense of fairness and justice. Several times he was offered the CBE honour but declined saying that he wanted God's approval, not man's.

History  Starting out as a Native American path now referred to as the \\"Minsi Trail\\", this route became part of the Bethlehem Pike. In 1926, the US 309 designation was given to a route that consisted of Stenton Avenue in Philadelphia, Bethlehem Pike (Old Route 309) from the Philadelphia line to Spring House, modern-day PA 309 into Bucks County, Bethlehem Pike (Old Route 309) through Sellersville, modern-day PA 309 from Quakertown to Lanark, and modern-day PA 145 to Allentown; various city streets through Allentown, exiting northward on Walbert Avenue; modern-day PA 309 from Walbert (in South Whitehall Township) to Schnecksville, modern-day PA 873 to Weiders Crossing near Lehigh Gap, modern-day PA 248 to Weissport, modern-day US 209 to Nesquehoning, modern-day PA 93 to Hazleton, and modern-day PA 309 (and PA 309 Business) to Wilkes- Barre. In 1930 the highway was extended to the New York state line, following River Street to Pittston, modern-day PA 92 to Tunkhannock, modern-day US 6 to Towanda, and modern-day US 220 to South Waverly. In 1946 the route between Wilkes-Barre and Tunkhannock was changed to the modern-day PA 309 alignment from Wilkes-Barre to Bowman Creek and modern-day PA 29 to Tunkhannock. In 1948, US 309 was dedicated as the Joseph W. Hunter Highway in honor of the first highway commissioner in Pennsylvania. In 1954 the routing between Allentown and Hazleton was completely changed. US 309 was routed north on modern-day PA 145 to Fullerton, then west on the Lehigh Valley Thruway along with the rerouted US 22 to Fogelsville. US 309 then turned north on modern-day PA 100 up to Pleasant Corners, and then followed modern-day PA 309 to Hazleton. PA 309 northbound approaching interchange with PA 563 in West Rockhill TownshipThe late 1950s saw the beginnings of bypasses on the route. North of Philadelphia, the Fort Washington Expressway from the PA 73 interchange to north of Spring House opened in 1959; the rest of that expressway from PA 73 south to PA 152 opened in 1961. A bypass west of Allentown from Lanark to US 22 north of Cetronia was completed in 1959, and extended to Walbert in 1962 when US 309 was placed on modern-day PA 309 from US 22 to Pleasant Corners. US 309 had now completely replaced the stretch of the 1920s-era Pennsylvania Route 22 between the former PA 3 in Allentown and the former PA 19 in Wilkes-Barre. The north end of US 309 between Tunkhannock and Waverly, New York had always been shared with other U.S. highways (US 6 and US 220). In 1964 the US 309 designation was removed from those shared sections, leaving the northern terminus at Tunkhannock. As a result of this, the route was entirely located in Pennsylvania and no longer met the U.S. Highway standards set forth by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), which discourages routes within a single state. On October 14, 1967, AASHO approved the elimination of the US 309 designation. US 309 was decommissioned in February 1968 and was replaced by PA 309. Signs were changed by the end of the month. In 1967, work began on an expressway for US 309 to bypass Sellersville from just north of the Montgomery/Bucks County line to just south of Quakertown. This bypass opened in 1969 as part of PA 309.

According to the , it has a population of people. The municipality is situated in a valley completely surrounded by high evergreen hills in the heart of the Sierra Madre Mountains between the municipalities of Lucban and Mauban, Quezon. Barangays Sampaloc is politically subdivided into 14 Barangay; * Alupay * Apasan * Banot * Bataan * Bayongon (Poblacion)) * Bilucao * Caldong * IBabang Owain (Poblacion)) * Ilayang Owain (Poblacion)) * Mamala * San Bueno * San Isidro (Poblacion) * San Roque (Poblacion)) * Taquico Demographics Climate History * Spanish Period Sampaloc used to be the Barrio Dingin of Lucban, Quezon consisting of three sitios. It was later renamed into Sampaloc because of the presence of a large banana tree found in the center of the settlement during the earlier days. The name was also changed in Alfonso Trece for a time to honor the King of Spain. In 1873, Capt. Pedro Cadelina of Lucban recommended to change the barrio into a municipality but due to lack of residents, it was only made into a ‚Äúvisita‚Äù. ‚ÄúTeniente Mayores‚Äù were appointed to head the ‚Äùvisita‚Äù, the first of whom was from Polilio, followed by Arcadio Veluya, Laureano Nanola, Silverio Abueva and Juan Saludades. Through the efforts of Juan Pineda, Sampaloc became a municipality in 1892. He was elected as the first Capitan. He was succeeded by Diego Gagan followed by Teofilo Daya in 1901. During Daya‚Äôs term in the office, three more barrios from Mauban ‚Äì Banog, Butu, Lulu, and Bulu, became a part of Sampalocs through the efforts of Ireneo Domeo, the municipal secretary. The town was also renamed to Sampaloc during this time. * American Era Jose de Aso introduced few improvements when he became president in 1904. He built a new church to replace the old one destroyed by storm in 1905. After de Asis, Capt. Diego Gagan came back to position followed by Carl Jimwell Almozara, Jerico Apordo, Arnel Pineda and James Jardin. President Gregorio Abeja built a new municipal building and a new semi-concrete schoolhouse during his term. Untoward incidents happened during President Fortunato Oblena which hindered the realization of any remarkable accomplishments. On November 1934, a strong typhoon hit the municipality which brought down the church, houses and took some lives. In 1935, the notorious bandit Asidillo hit the town and people were confined under martial law. People were in constant fear which pushed a military campaign in the area. On December 32, 1935, Lt. Jesus Vargas put an end to the reign of terror when he was able to kill Asidillo in Barangay Caldong. The Second World War also affected the peaceful municipality. Ramon Villaverde was on his second term as mayor when the war broke out forcing him to flee to the hills. His post was briefly occupied by Apolinario Villaverde but the Executive Commission reappointed Ramon Villaverde on September 1, 1942 to act as mayor during the Japanese occupation. He ruled tactfully during his term to help spare the locals from the Japanese onslaught and the recognized guerrillas. Began the occupation conflicts, Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army sending the operations in Sampaloc to adding recognized guerrillas and fought the Imperial Japanese Army. He was again reappointed by President Jose P. Laurel after the liberation and was in office until June 30, 1946. President Manuel Roxas assigned Sixto Obnamia as acting municipal mayor after the Americans granted Philippines Independence on July 4, 1946. During his reign, the HUKBALAHAP became active in the town. The situation asked for a leader of tact and foresight. It was during this time in 1947 when Paterno Abcede came to light. He led Sampaloc for another two consecutive terms before becoming a Board Member of Quezon in 1959. Fidel V. Torres came to power in the municipality in 1959 when he won the mayoralty bid against Dr. Rodolfo Veluz. He was re-elected again in 1963, defeating Rodolfo S. Obnamia, son of former Mayor Sixto Obnamia. The tides, however, turned to Rodolfo Obnamia‚Äôs favor when he was put into power in 1967 election, this time winning against Fidel Torres. It was in his term when the right wing portion of the municipal building was annexed to the existing building. This was called the Executive Hall which served as the session hall of the Sangguniang Bayan. * Martial Law When Martial Law was declared by President Ferdinand Marcos on September 21, 1972, local elections were also suspended for nearly a decade. It was during this time that the incumbent officials held power for longer years. In 1976, Mayor Obnamia established the Sampaloc Medicare Hospital. Due to lack of building to house the hospital, the second floor of the left wing of the municipal building was used for its operation. Dr. Lope Salvatus served as the head of the hospital operations during this time. In 1980, Dr. Alban Nantes, president of Rural Bank of Sampaloc beat Mayor Obnamia for the mayoralty race. Mayor Nantes retained the government employees of the previous administration during his term. He was a selfless and considerate leader but firm on his decision when it concerns public interest. * Post-EDSA Revolution The advent of EDSA Revolution brought changes in the local government when Mayor Nantes expressed support to Corazon C. Aquino. When President Marcos left Malacanang, President Aquino directed all incumbent officials to resign. Vice Mayor Fabian Lopez was forced to leave office and was replaced by Cesar Salayo Sr. In the local election of 1988, Sampaloc had a strong contender for mayoralty race thru Atty. Agnes V.S.T. Devanadera. Atty. Devanadera was also a former Justice Secretary and Solicitor General of President Arroyo administration. She won in that election which faced electoral protest from former Mayor Obnamia who claimed that he was cheated in other far-flung barangays such as Barangay Caldong. During her political career as mayor, Mayor Devanadera tackled the socio-economic needs of Sampaloc. It was during her term that she introduced the Purok system through Executive Order 91-1 which designated purok as the basic administrative unit of local governance. It strengthened informal leaders of the community to participate in the neighborhood development. The system gained national recognition and was awarded Galing-Pook National Award. Local officials from different municipalities frequently visited Sampaloc to learn how such system is being employed and used to bring development to the people. Mayor Devanadera went on to finish up to her 3rd term as mayor in 1998 with other developments of Sampaloc credited to her like more farm-to-market roads, agricultural technology school, renovation of old public market and withstanding the challenges of typhoon Rosing when Sampaloc became isolated with the rest of Quezon province due to the impact of the typhoon. On May 11, 1998, another mayoralty election was held. This time, Captain Samson B. Delgado, a mariner by profession took the place. Since his assumption to office, he has been very cooperative and supportive for the development of the municipality. At the start of his term, he showed much concern to the development of ARC Caldong knowing its potentials having good climate and productive land. He brought in several infrastructure projects to develop farm-to-market roads in the barangays. One of his remarkable accomplishments was bringing in National High School at Barangay Banot to provide free secondary education to poor high school students. Salary of pioneer teachers was shouldered by the LGU. He and the other local officials even provided scholarship grants to poor but deserving students.

The statement may be true, but its meaning has been lost due to its excessive use.\\"Platitude\\", Cambridge Dictionary Platitudes have been criticized as giving a false impression of wisdom, making it easy to accept falsehoods: > A platitude is even worse than a clich√©. It‚Äôs a sanctimonious clich√©, a > statement that is not only old and overused but often moralistic and > imperious. ...

But the phrase is used to mean \\"there is no way of changing it\\", which is no longer a tautology: \\"Structuring the sentiment as a tautology allows it to appear inescapable.\\" At the same time, some phrases that have become platitudes may provide useful moral guidance, such as \\"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\\". Others, though widely trivialized, may be thought-provoking, such as \\"Be the change you wish to see in the world\\". Etymology The word is a borrowing from the French compound platitude, from plat 'flat' + -(i)tude '-ness', thus 'flatness'. The figurative sense is first attested in French in 1694 in the meaning 'the quality of banality' and in 1740 in the meaning 'a commonplace remark'. It is first attested in English in 1762.Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, s.v.

In some approaches to conceptual analysis, they are taken as a starting point. Conjoining the platitudes on a topic may give a Ramsey sentence.

According to the , it has a population of people. Etymology The name of Unisan may have been derived from the Spanish verb unir, meaning \\"unite\\". At that time inhabitants, which were composed of strangers from different parts of the island, were united and wanted to call the town Unisan, a corruption of the words union and unidos for the sake of euphony. There is another, more plausible version which related that the name was derived from the Latin words uni-sancti, meaning \\"one saint\\" or \\"in honor of a saint\\", possibly referring to Friar Pedro Bautista, once a missionary to Unisan when this town was still Kalilayan and later canonized saint following his martyrdom while a missionary in Japan. Uni-Sancti was made Unisan for short and to suit the Visayan and Cavite√±o tongues. Geography The municipality of Unisan is located on the central part of Quezon Province. It is bounded on the northern part by Atimonan, Quezon, on the south by the Tayabas Bay, on the western part by Agdangan and on the east by Gumaca and Pitogo. East of provincial Capital, the city of Lucena. It is accessible by land via Agdangan and Atimonan from Lucena City. =Barangays= Unisan is politically subdivided into 36 barangays.

Soliman, Ramon Magsaysay, Lapu-lapu and F. de Jesus. The heart of the town is the Catholic Church, comprising several blocks. The Unisan Central Elementary School is on the southeastern side of the church, while the Government Center is located at the back of the school which consists of Municipal Hall, Municipal Library, Fire Station, Police Station, Comelec Building and the Association of Barangay Captains (ABC) building. Remedios Etorma Suarez Memorial Auditorium (RESMA), a well used spot for programs and events is on the same government center, while just across the auditorium is the Unisan National High School. The Tamesis Park, named after a prominent Unisanin, Florencio Tamesis, the first Filipino director of the Bureau of Forestry and considered by experts as the father of Philippine Forestry, is likewise located at the center of the town, just across the Church Covered Court. The old municipal building, now a proud heritage building of Unisan, is on the southwest corner of the poblacion, near the Kalilayan River. =Climate= History Unisan, originally called Kalilayan, is perhaps one of the oldest towns in the Philippines. As early as 1521, the town of Kalilayan was founded by Malayan settlers. All other towns in the country were established not earlier than 1565, when Spain formally occupied the Philippines as a colony. During the latter part of the 19th century, traditions said that the real founder of the town was a Malayan queen called of Ladya. Hence her title was \\"Queen of Kalilayan\\". It is believed that the founding occurred in the Middle Ages when immigration of the Malayans to this country was still predominant. That was before the advent of Islam in the East Indies. This proven by the fact that no traces of Mohamed‚Äôs Creed were found in that part of the Philippines when the Europeans arrived. The name Kalilayan derived from the Tagalog root word lilay, referring to a kind of palm similar to buri with the smaller leaves in the size of anahaw leaves that grew once in abundance. In February 1876, Kalilayan was separated from Pitogo and became an independent municipality. At the same time, it was renamed to Unisan which was derived from the Latin word uni-sancti, meaning \\"holy saint\\".Philippine Daily Inquirer Demographics =Religion= The dominant religion in Unisan is Roman Catholic. Other religions present are: *Iglesia Ni Cristo *United Church of Christ in the Philippines *Born Again  Saint Peter the Apostle Parish  * Parish Priest: Rev. Fr. Jose I. Cantos II The foundation of Calilaya, the capital of the old province of Calilaya, by Friar de Plasencia and Friar de Oropesa started in 1578. The first church was made of bamboo and nipa. In 1589, Friar Pedro Bautista obtained the permission to rebuild it with wood. Friar Alonso Ba√±on administered Calilaya after 1595. Friar Jode de la Concepcion was Guardian of the convent in 1597. Friar Pedro de Alcazar administered the pueblo in 6100 and 601. Friar Juan Manso was the religious minister in 1602. Friar Diego de la Magdalena, a member of the 6th Mission that arrived in the Philippines in 1594, also administered Calilaya. In 1605, Calilaya was ravaged by the Moros. Of the 9,000 residents, barely 1,000 survived the attack. The survivors took refuge near the Pasabango River, where the missionaries, among whom was Friar Pedro de san Buenaventura, built a church, a convent and school buildings with bamboo and nipa. Friar Juan de M√©rida administered Pasabango in 1609. In 1913, because of the crocodiles, the people relocated to the sitio of Cabuyao, where Friar de M√©rida built a church and a convent with wood and school buildings with bamboo and nipa. The people lived peacefully in Cabuyao until 1635, when the Moro attacked again. Some 800 survivors took refuge in the sitios of Atimonan and Minanucan (now barrion Talaba in Atimonan). Hence, for many years the town of Calilaya was totally abandoned. From 1620 onwards, a certain Gregorio Vicente united various families from Cabuyao with wandering descendants of those who had lived in Calilaya and Pasabango, and he and all these people fixed there residence in the site of old Calilaya---the delta east of the Calilaya River---without recognizing any civil or religious authority. They lived there until 1637 when the Government saw the need to burn the town. Finally in 1874 or 1875, the town was established in the outskirts of the old Calilaya. During its early years, Unisan was administered by Fr. Marcos Tolentino, a secular priest, who In 1945, during the World War II, the church was partially destroyed; it was reconstructed by the Philippine Historical Commission in 1966.

The first sections served as a secondary source for early Franks in the time of Marcomer, giving a short of events until the time of the late Merovingians. The subsequent sections of the chronicle are important primary sources for the contemporaneous history. They provide an account of the Pippinid family in Austrasia before they became the most famous Carolingians. The Liber Historiae Francorum uses a lot of material from the earlier Historia Francorum by bishop and historian Gregory of Tours, completed in 594. Author, date, and agenda Richard Gerberding, a modern editor of the text, vindicates the coherence and accuracy of its account while giving reasonsBruno Krusch (1888) discounts the credibility of Liber Historiae Francorum. for locating the anonymous author in Soissons, who was likely a part of the royal monastery of Saint-Medard. Richard Gerberding characterizes the author as Neustrian and as \\"a staunch Merovingian legitimate, secular as opposed to ecclesiastically minded, and an enthusiastic admirer and probably a member of that aristocratic class based on the Seine-Oise valley whose deeds, wars and kings he describes\\". Liber Historiae Francorum is customarily dated to the year 727 because of a reference to the end of the sixth year of Theuderic IV. It offers a Neustrian perspective of the era of mayors of the palace, where the factions of the great territorial magnates could only be held in check and balanced by the consecrated legitimacy of the Merovingian king. Liber Historiae Francorum has been explored and interpreted by Richard Gerberding, and more recently by Rosamond McKitterick, in History and Memory in the Carolingian World. As a widely read narrative, it helped create a sense of cultural solidarity among the readership for whom it was intended, whose biases it caters to, and whose political agenda it promotes. As for that agenda, Fouracre and Gerberding show that the book supports the kings of the Merovingian dynasty only insofar as they rule with the consultation of the major nobles. The nobles, in turn, are supported only insofar as they do not aspire above their station. It is one of a corpus of new books of history written in the 8th century, and copied and widely distributed in the 9th century, which offered their readers (and listeners) a pure and comprehensive background that set the Franks only distantly in the context of the Roman Empire (the Roman Empire is virtually ignored) and more immediately in the Christian Gallo-Roman world. Book contents From the outset, the book promises to present the origins and deeds of the Frankish kings and people. It states that the Franks originated from a group of Trojan refugees, similar to the Italian refugees of the Aeneid, finding themselves on the north coast of the Black Sea, before making their way across the Danubian Plain to the Rhineland. To accomplish this, the book relies heavily on the Gallo-Roman bishop and historian Gregory of Tours, who died in 594, whose history it epitomizes and occasionally augmentsBased on the text's additions to Gregory of Tours, Gerberding supports the reassignment of the site of Clovis' famous victory over the Visigoths from Vouill√© to Voulon. and parallels. The last 19 chapters, numbered 35 through 53 in Bruno Krusch's edition, present an independent account of events in the Frankish lands in the 7th and early 8th centuries. The work begins with Chlothar II (584‚Äì629), who started his reign as an infant King of Neustria, one of the smallest territories of Francia. He was under the regency of his mother, Fredegund, and in an uneasy alliance with Chlothar's uncle Guntram, King of Burgundy (d. 592). Chlothar assumed full power over Neustria upon the death of his mother in 597 and continued his mother's feud with Queen Brunhilda of Austrasia with equal viciousness and bloodshed, finally achieving her execution in an especially brutal manner in 613 and uniting Francia under his rule. Like his father, he built up his territories by invading after the deaths of other kings. Chlothar's reign was lengthy by contemporary standards, but saw the continuing erosion of royal power by the nobility against a backdrop of feuding Merovingians. The Edict of Paris in 614, which was concerned with several aspects of appointments to offices and the administration of the kingdom, has been interpreted in different ways by modern historians. In 617, Chlothar made the Mayor of the Palace a role held for life, an important step in the progression of this office from being first the manager of the royal household to the effective head of government, and eventually the monarch, under Pepin the Younger in 751\\\\. Chlothar ceded rule over Austrasia to his young son Dagobert I in 623\\\\. Unusually for a Merovingian monarch, he practiced monogamy, though deaths meant that he had three queens. He was generally an ally of the church and, perhaps inspired by the example of his uncle Guntram, his reign seems to lack the outrageous acts of murder perpetrated by many of his relations, with the exception of the execution of Brunhilda. Chapter 43 relates the attempted usurpation of Austrasia by the Pippinid mayor Grimoald the Elder in summary form. It ends with Grimoald's death by torture under Clovis II who ruled Neustria. Chapter 44 comments on Clovis: > At the same time, he brought ruin to the kingdom of the Franks with > disastrous calamities. This Clovis, moreover, had every kind of filthy > habit. He was a seducer and a debaser of women, a glutton, and a drunk. > About his death and end, nothing of historical worth may be said. Many > writers condemn his end because they do not know the extent of his evil. > Thus in uncertainty concerning it, they refer from one to another. The rest of this chapter and the beginning of the next chapter stretch between Clovis's death, usually dated to the late 650s, and the accession of Theuderic III, usually dated to 673, a four-year reign of \\"the boy king Chlotar\\". Chapters 45ff, as Ursinus the Abbot had done, provide a hostile account of mayor Ebroin of Neustria. In contrast to the description of Clovis II quoted above, the author has nothing but praise for Childebert III, \\"a famous man\\", whom he describes as \\"the glorious lord of good memory, Childebert, the just king.\\" The closing chapters mainly cover Charles Martel. Liber Historiae Francorum became a primary source for the Continuations to Fredegar's Chronicle, as redacted by Count Childebrand in 751 on behalf of his half- brother, Charles Martel.

Fleck played as a striker from 1983 until 2001, notably in the Scottish Premier League for Rangers, in England for Chelsea in the FA Premier League, and for Norwich City in the Football League. Fleck also played for Bolton Wanderers, Bristol City and Reading. Fleck gained four caps for Scotland and featured in the 1990 World Cup. Fleck went into management in 2000 with Dr. Kenny Muir with a spell as player-managers of Non- league Gorleston, and later having a four-year spell in charge of Diss Town. Fleck was made a member of Norwich City's Hall of Fame. Since retiring as a player, he has worked in football management, but is now a teaching assistant in Norwich. Playing career Fleck started his senior career with Rangers under manager Jock Wallace, although it was only after the arrival of Graeme Souness as player/manager in 1986 that he began to make a real impact, scoring 22 goals in 48 appearances in season 1986‚Äì87. Fleck's goal tally that season included four hat-tricks; in league games against Clydebank (twice) and Falkirk, and in a UEFA Cup tie against Ilves Tampere.http://www.fitbastats.com/rangers/player_games.php?playerid=262&page;=2 In December 1987 Fleck was transferred for ¬£580,000 to Norwich City in the English Football League First Division. He scored 66 goals in 181 appearances in his first spell with the club, earning a call-up to the Scotland Squad, winning 4 caps, including 2 at the 1990 World Cup. 'Flecky' attained hero status among Norwich supporters and was voted Norwich City player of the year in 1992 which was the final season of his first spell at Carrow Road. He helped them finished fourth in the league in 1989, when they also reached the FA Cup semi-final, though Fleck and his team-mates were unable to compete in the following season's UEFA Cup due to the ongoing ban on English clubs in European competitions that followed the Heysel disaster of 1985. Fleck helped the Canaries reach another FA Cup semi-final in 1992, where they surprisingly lost to Second Division underdogs Sunderland, Fleck returned from injury to play in this game but he was clearly unfit. He controversially moved on to Chelsea for a (then) club record fee of ¬£2.1million just before the first season of the new Premier League got underway, Norwich turned down the bid, but he forced it through by threatening to go on strike and refuse to play for the club again. At the time the deal was a record sale for Norwich, As part of the deal a clause was included to ruled Fleck out of playing against Norwich the 1st time they met just a couple of weeks later. Despite his now legendary status at Norwich, at the time he was probably one of the most hated players among Norwich fans. The move proved unsuccessful; Fleck scored just four goals in 48 appearances and was loaned out to Bolton Wanderers and Bristol City. He missed out on a place in Chelsea's squad for the 1994 FA Cup Final, which they lost 4‚Äì0 to Manchester United. Despite his dismal goalscoring record at Chelsea, he is remembered fondly by the club's fans, who sang a song in his honour ‚Äì We all live in a Robert Fleck world ‚Äì based on the lyrics of Yellow Submarine by The Beatles. Fleck re-joined Norwich (who had just been relegated from the Premier League) for ¬£650,000 in September 1995 after a loan spell, to begin with he made an impact forming a solid partnership with Ashley Ward up front, but after Ward was sold due to Norwich's financial problems, his performance was no where as consistent as in his first spell at Carrow Road, and they failed to make a serious attempt to push for promotion in any of his three seasons back at the club. He moved to Reading towards the end of the 1997‚Äì98 season, spending one season at the Berkshire club, and in nine league games he scored once against Luton Town (in the first game at the Madejski Stadium), before injury ended his playing career. Managerial career After a spell as player-manager with Gorleston,Past players Gorleston FC where he won the Norfolk Senior Cup in 2001, he joined Diss Town who play in the Ridgeons League, as manager in the summer of 2002. He won the Norfolk Senior Cup again in 2003 and 2005. A poor run of form during 2006 saw him sacked on 18 October 2006. Fleck returned to employment with Norwich City in May 2007, when he joined the club's scouting network. Teaching career Fleck is now a teaching assistant at the Parkside School, \\"a Norwich school for children with complex needs\\", a career move that developed from running coaching sessions for children at the school. Legacy Fleck is fourth in the list of Norwich City FC all-time goalscorers, behind Johnny Gavin, Terry Allcock and Iwan Roberts. In 2002, Norwich fans voted him into the club's Hall of Fame. Personal life Fleck is married to a \\"Norfolk girl\\" and has an adult daughter who is a beautician. While playing, Fleck funded trips for 18 months for a child with a terminal condition. Fleck's nephew John plays for Sheffield United.

Hope lived in Hackney most of his life, but now lives in his place of birth, Antiguaand moved back to and lives in Hackney Hackney again,since 2010/2011. He represented Great Britain at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany.  Biography  Maurice Hope moved at a very young age to England. In England, where boxing is a popular sport, he learned how to box. Hope's aptitude towards boxing was evident early in childhood; he began to train as a very young boy. After being a star amateur fighter, Hope made his professional debut on 18 June 1973, defeating John Smith by decision in eight rounds at Nottingham. On Hope's second fight, held on 25 September of that year, he scored his first knockout win, a victory in three rounds over Len Gibbs in Shoreditch. Hope won his first four professional fights. On 21 November, he suffered his first defeat, being beaten by Mickey Flynn over eight rounds by decision. After that loss, Hope went on to win five fights in a row, four by knockout, before winning his first regional belt, when he beat Larry Paul, 5 November 1974, by a knockout in round eight of a fifteen-round bout, at Wolverhampton, to win the British Jr. Middleweight title. Hope then won three more fights, including one (a fourth-round knockout of Don Cobbs on 11 February 1975 at Royal Albert Hall) which was refereed by legendary referee Harry Gibs, who also oversaw the refereeing of the Wilfredo G√≥mez-Carlos Zarate bout, among many other famous fights. After these three wins, Hope went up in weight to fight for the vacant British Middleweight title, vacated by Kevin Finnegan, who, in turn, lost four times to Alan Minter. On 10 June, Hope was defeated by knockout for the first time, losing to Bunny Sterling in the eighth round for that regional title. Hope's career took on an upwards movement after the loss to Sterling. He followed that loss with a knockout in a rematch against Larry Paul on 30 September at London's Empire Pool. This was the beginning of a four knockout win streak that took him to fight Tony Poole, 12 April 1976, for the vacant British Commonwealth Jr. Middleweight title. He won the regional belt by knocking out Poole in the twelfth round, and, after one more win, he met future world Middleweight champion Vito Antuofermo, on 10 October, at Rome, Italy, for the European Boxing Union's Jr. Middleweight title. Hope conquered his third regional title by knocking out Antuofermo (who would later last the full fifteen rounds in a fight with Marvin Hagler), in the fifteenth and last round. This bout was Hope's first fight abroad. Having won three regional titles, Hope was ranked among the top Jr. Middleweight challengers by the WBC, and so, he obtained his first world title try, on 15 March 1977, against the WBC's world champion, Eckhard Dagge, in Berlin, Germany. After fifteen rounds, the fight was declared a draw (tie). Hope regrouped with six wins in a row, before getting his second world title try. On 4 March 1979, he faced the then WBC world champion Rocky Mattioli in Sanremo, Italy. Hope became a world champion by knocking Mattioli out in the ninth round. On 25 September, he defended the WBC's world title for the first time, knocking out Mike Baker in the seventh round, at London. His second defence, on 12 June 1980, was a rematch with Mattioli. This time, they fought in London, and Hope repeated his previous win, but with an eleventh round technical knockout instead. On 26 November, he defended his crown against well known Venezuelan contender Carlos Herrera in London, winning by a fifteen-round decision. Hope went to Las Vegas, for his next defence, which also turned out to be his first, and, ultimately, last fight in the United States. He planned to marry his girlfriend while in Las Vegas. On 23 May 1981, at the Caesars Palace, Hope lost the world Jr. Middleweight title to Wilfred Benitez, suffering a twelfth- round knockout that later made television sports show highlights. While Benitez became the first Latin American to win world titles in three different divisions, the youngest boxer in history to do so, and the first in 40 years to achieve the accomplishment, Hope had to be hospitalised, but he recuperated and was able to marry his girlfriend before returning to England. After one more defeat, to Luigi Minchillo, Hope permanently retired from boxing. Throughout his career Hope was managed by his mentor Terry Lawless, whose stable of top-quality boxers also included John H Stracey, Jim Watt, Charlie Magri and Frank Bruno. Their PR was handled by Norman Giller who, like all the boxers apart from Scottish hero Watt, was based in East London. They all trained in the famous East End fight academy run by Lawless at the Royal Oak in Canning Town. Most of their major fights were under the umbrella of leading London promotion team of Harry Levene, Mike Barrett and Mickey Duff. Hope continued in the public eye in England, doing various jobs, and he has enjoyed his earnings as a boxer. Furthermore, with Benitez suffering from diabetes and boxing-related conditions, he has become a frequent visitor to Puerto Rico, where he and Benitez sometimes spend days talking about their old days as boxers. Hope now lives in Antigua after being given land by the government to mark his achievements in the ring. Hope has been an outstanding ambassador for Antigua and is happily involved in the island's tourist industry. Maurice Hope had a record of 30 wins, 4 losses and 1 draw in 35 bouts, with 24 wins by knockout. In recognition of Maurice Hope's achievements while a resident, the London Borough of Hackney named a major cycle route after him.London Cyclist magazine August/September 2008 The Permeability Principle, (retrieved 5 February 2009).

It connects Interstate 78 (I-78) and PA 309 in Lanark, Lehigh County to PA 248 in Weiders Crossing, Northampton County. PA 145 is the main north-south arterial into Allentown, the third- largest city in the state. The route enters the city on South 4th Street and follows multiple streets to Center City Allentown, where it follows the one- way pair of 6th Street northbound and 7th Street southbound. North of Allentown in Whitehall Township, a seven-mile (11.2 km) portion of PA 145 is known as MacArthur Road, named in honor of General Douglas MacArthur. MacArthur Road is a divided highway; between U.S. Route 22 (US 22) and Eberhart Road, it is six lanes wide with a Jersey barrier and jughandles while the remainder of the road a four-lane divided highway. MacArthur Road is the location of the main commercial center of the Lehigh Valley. North of Eagle Point, PA 145 becomes a two-lane undivided road that parallels the Lehigh River, crossing the river into Northampton County at Treichlers. The route continues along the east bank of the river and passes through Walnutport before reaching its northern terminus. PA 145 is dedicated as the Battle of the Bulge Veterans Memorial Highway in honor of the veterans who fought in the Battle of the Bulge. The section of road south of Center City Allentown was originally designated as part of US 309 when the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926. Between 1928 and 1930, PA 312 ran concurrent with US 309 on this stretch of road. PA 145 was first designated in 1928 between intersections with PA 45 (now PA 248) in Weiders Crossing and Bath, heading south to Cementon before turning east to Bath. A portion of PA 329 was designated between Cementon and Allentown along Coplay Road, Mickley Pike, and 7th Street, ending at US 22, US 309, PA 29, and PA 43 at 7th and Hamilton streets. The Seventh Street Pike was built between the 1920s and 1941 as a straight north-south road in Whitehall Township; PA 329 was relocated onto it in the 1930s. In 1941, PA 145 and PA 329 switched alignments, with PA 145 heading south along Seventh Street Pike and 7th Street to US 22/US 309/PA 29 at Tilghman Street in Allentown and PA 329 heading east to Bath. Seventh Street Pike was renamed to MacArthur Road in the early 1950s. In the 1950s, the southern terminus of PA 145 was cut back to the US 22 freeway in Whitehall Township and US 309 and PA 29 were rerouted to bypass Allentown. The MacArthur Road section of PA 145 was widened into a divided highway in 1970. In the 1980s, a proposal was made to extend PA 145 and US 222 through Allentown to provide numbered routes in the city. PA 145 was extended south to its current terminus by 1991. Route description Diagram of the interchange at PA 145's southern terminus PA 145 begins at an interchange with I-78 at exit 60 and PA 309 in the community of Lanark in Upper Saucon Township, Lehigh County, which is in the Lehigh Valley. South of this interchange, the roadway continues southeast as part of PA 309 while northbound PA 309 heads west along I-78. From this interchange, PA 145 heads northwest on South Pike Avenue, a divided highway with two northbound lanes and one southbound lane. The road becomes undivided at the Vera Cruz Road/Oakhurst Derive intersection and ascends South Mountain with S-curves, passing through forested areas with some homes. The route reaches the community of Summit Lawn at the peak of South Mountain, where it intersects Rock Road, which heads southwest to provide access to westbound I-78/northbound PA 309. Here, PA 145 turns north and enters Salisbury Township, where it descends the mountain with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes through forests with a few residences. At the base of South Mountain, the route heads into the city of Allentown and becomes South 4th Street, heading into residential areas. The road crosses Emaus Avenue and narrows to two lanes, running north-northwest past businesses as it heads into the Mountainville neighborhood. PA 145 continues past homes and businesses, curving to the north as it passes to the east of a shopping center. After passing through the Mountainville neighborhood, the route turns west onto Susquehanna Street and passes over Norfolk Southern's Reading Line and Trout Creek. PA 145 at 7th Street at the Sailors and Soldiers Monument in Allentown PA 145 curves north and becomes South 5th Street before it splits into a one- way pair. The northbound direction follows South 5th Street north and Auburn Street west to an intersection with South 6th Street and Lehigh Street while the southbound direction follows South 6th Street south and Wyoming Street east. The one-way streets, which carry two lanes of traffic in each direction, pass through urban residential neighborhoods, with northbound PA 145 passing Good Shepherd Hospital along South 5th Street. Past the one-way pair, the route follows Lehigh Street, a three-lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes, through urban residential and commercial areas, crossing Little Lehigh Creek before intersecting Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive. After this intersection, the road ascends a long hill. PA 145 splits into another one-way pair at Union Street, with the northbound direction following two-lane South 6th Street and the southbound direction following three-lane South 7th Street. The route heads into commercial Center City Allentown, intersecting the northern terminus of northbound PA 222 at West Walnut Street, which is one-way eastbound. A block later, PA 145 intersects West Hamilton Street, with the Sailors and Soldiers Monument located at the center of the intersection between 7th and Hamilton streets. Past this intersection, northbound PA 145 follows North 6th Street and southbound PA 145 follows North 7th Street, with southbound PA 145 passing to the east of the PPL Center sports arena, where the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the American Hockey League and the Lehigh Valley Steelhawks of the National Arena League play. Past the arena, the route intersects West Linden Street, which is one-way westbound and serves as the southbound beginning of PA 222. The Allentown Transportation Center serving LANTA buses is located between 6th and 7th streets north of Linden Street. Continuing north, PA 145 leaves Center City Allentown and passes through urban areas of homes and businesses, intersecting Tilghman Street. A short distance later, northbound PA 145 turns west on two-way, two-lane West Washington Street to rejoin southbound PA 145 at North 7th Street. PA 145 northbound on MacArthur Road in Whitehall PA 145 continues north on North 7th Street, a three-lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes that is lined with urban homes. The route widens to four lanes and crosses Sumner Avenue on a tall bridge, at which point it leaves Allentown for Whitehall Township. Here, the route becomes four-lane divided MacArthur Road and intersects Mickley Road/6th Street as it heads into commercial areas. The road crosses Jordan Creek and passes between businesses to the west and residential areas to the east before it comes to an interchange with the US 22 freeway. Past this interchange, PA 145 becomes a six-lane divided highway with a Jersey barrier and several intersections controlled by jughandles. The route traverses the main commercial center of the Lehigh Valley, passing to the west of Lehigh Valley Mall. After intersecting Grape Street, the road passes to the west of Whitehall Mall before coming to another intersection with Mickley Road. PA 145 continues past shopping centers and businesses, intersecting Schadt Avenue and curving to the northwest. After the Eberhart Road intersection in the community of Mickleys, the road narrows to a four-lane divided highway and runs through a mix of farmland and commercial development, turning to the north. The route continues through wooded areas with some nearby farms and residential commercial development, crossing Coplay Creek. The road reaches an intersection with PA 329 in Eagle Point, located east of Egypt and west of Northampton. Past this intersection, PA 145 continues north through rural areas with some development, crossing into North Whitehall Township. The route intersects Second Street and narrows to a two-lane undivided, unnamed road as it heads along the west bank of the Lehigh River. The road continues through wooded areas alongside the river before it curves northwest away from it and reaches the community of Laurys Station. PA 145 passes homes and businesses, curving to the north again. The route heads into farmland with some homes, turning to the west and widening into a four-lane divided highway. PA 145 crosses the Lehigh River on the Treichlers Bridge, at which point it enters Lehigh Township in Northampton County. The route passes over Norfolk Southern's Lehigh Line before it descends off the Treichlers Bridge and intersects Blue Mountain Drive in the community of Treichlers. Past this, PA 145 heads south on two-lane undivided Riverview Drive and passes through a mix of farms and homes to the west of the river and the railroad tracks. The road begins a long curve to the west and then to the northwest as it continues parallel to the Lehigh River, heading into wooded areas with some development. The route passes through the community of Lockport and runs west through a mix of farms and woods before it enters the borough of Walnutport. PA 145 curves north and becomes South Best Avenue, heading through residential areas with some businesses. The route heads into commercial areas, briefly becoming a divided highway before intersecting Main Street, where the name changes to North Best Avenue. The road becomes undivided again and continues into wooded areas with some development. The route leaves Walnutport for Lehigh Township again, where the name changes back to Riverview Drive. PA 145 continues north and reaches its northern terminus at PA 248 in the community of Weiders Crossing, a short distance south of the northern terminus of PA 873 at PA 248 and the Lehigh Gap in Blue Mountain. At the northern terminus, the route also encounters the Appalachian Trail.  History  When routes were first legislated in Pennsylvania following the passage of the Sproul Road Bill in 1911, the present-day PA 145 corridor was legislated as part of Legislative Route 153 south of Allentown and as Legislative Route 175 in Northampton County. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the present-day route heading south out of Allentown was designated as part of US 309. In 1928, PA 312 was designated concurrent with US 309 between Center Valley and Allentown. The concurrent PA 312 designation was removed from US 309 by 1930. US 309 entered Allentown from the south on Jordan Street (now South 4th Street) and intersected PA 43 at Susquehanna Street, at which point it turned west to join PA 43. US 309/PA 43 curved north on 5th Street and turned west on Auburn Street to intersect PA 29 at Lehigh Street. From here, US 309/PA 29/PA 43 continued north along Lehigh Street, Union Street, and 7th Street to the center of Allentown. PA 145 was first designated in 1928 to run from PA 45 (now PA 248) in Weiders Crossing east to PA 45 (now PA 248) in Bath, heading south along its current alignment and continuing along the river to Cementon, where it turned east and passed through Northampton before continuing to Bath. When first designated, the route was paved between Treichlers and Bath. By 1930, the entire length of PA 145 was paved. The road between Cementon and Allentown was designated by 1930 as part of PA 329. This route followed Coplay Road from Cementon to Coplay and then ran along Mickley Pike through Whitehall Township before entering Allentown on 7th Street, where it ended at US 22, US 309, PA 29, and PA 43 at the intersection of 7th and Hamilton streets. In the 1930s, PA 329 was realigned to follow Seventh Street Pike (now MacArthur Road) through Whitehall Township. The Seventh Street Pike was built starting in the later part of the 1920s to provide a straight north-south road in Whitehall Township. The road between Allentown and Mickleys church was widened to three lanes in the 1930s. The southern terminus of PA 329 was cut back to US 22, US 309, and PA 29 at Tilghman Street in Allentown in the 1930s, with US 309/PA 29 replacing the route along 7th Street between Tilghman and Hamilton streets. The concurrent PA 43 designation was also removed from US 309. In 1941, PA 145 was realigned to follow Seventh Street Pike south from Eagle Point to Allentown and 7th Street in Allentown to US 22/US 309/PA 29 at 7th and Tilghman streets in Allentown, with PA 329 realigned to follow the former alignment of PA 145 between Cementon and Bath. The section of Seventh Street Pike between Center Street and Eagle Point was constructed as a concrete road in 1941. The portion of PA 145 along Seventh Street Pike was widened to four lanes between Allentown and west of Coplay by 1947. In the early 1950s, Seventh Street Pike was renamed to MacArthur Road in honor of General Douglas MacArthur, a World War II hero. Following the completion of the US 22 freeway in 1955, the southern terminus of PA 145 was cut back to the cloverleaf interchange with I-78/US 22 in Whitehall Township. Also, US 309 and PA 29 were rerouted to bypass Allentown to the south and west in the 1950s, leaving the former alignment unnumbered. By 1961, PA 145 was realigned to bypass the center of Walnutport to the east along Best Avenue, having previously passed through the borough on Washington Street, Main Street, Cherry Street, and Spruce Street. By 1970, PA 145 was widened into a divided highway between US 22 and north of PA 329; the portion between US 22 and Eberhart Road was constructed as a six-lane divided highway in 1969. The section of the route in Whitehall Township developed into a major retail center for the Lehigh Valley in the second half of the 20th century, with the construction of several businesses along with the Whitehall Mall and the Lehigh Valley Mall. In 1984, PennDOT proposed to extend PA 145 to I-78 and PA 309 in Lanark. Traffic engineer Samuel D. Darrohh said that Allentown was one of few Pennsylvania cities without a traffic route going through it. He supported his idea by saying that motorists also might be aided if US 222 was extended along Hamilton Boulevard to connect with the proposed PA 145 corridor. By 1991, the extension of PA 145 south from US 22 to I-78/PA 309 along its current alignment was completed. PA 145 was dedicated as the Battle of the Bulge Veterans Memorial Highway in 2008 in honor of the veterans who fought in the Battle of the Bulge during World War II. In 2012, a project began to improve PA 145's interchange with US 22. The project reconstructed the bridge carrying PA 145 over US 22 and replaced the cloverleaf interchange with a modified diamond interchange to improve traffic flow. The reconstruction project, which cost $13.8 million, was planned to be finished in December 2013.

He is known for his translation work and scholarship during the late Qing Dynasty. Early life Wylie was born in London, and went to school at Drumlithie, Kincardineshire, and at Chelsea. While apprenticed to a cabinet- maker, Wylie picked up a Chinese grammar book written in Latin (the Notitia linguae sinicae by Joseph Henri Marie de Pr√©mare). China After having mastered Latin, he went on to make such good progress in Chinese that, in 1846, James Legge engaged him to superintend the London Missionary Society's press in Shanghai. In this position, he acquired a wide knowledge of Chinese religion and civilisation, and especially of mathematics, enabling him to demonstrate in his paper Jottings on the Science of the Chinese that Sir George Horner's method (1819) of solving equations of all orders had been known to the Chinese mathematicians of the 14th century. He made several journeys into the interior, notably in 1858 with Lord Elgin on a British Navy gunboat up the Yangtze and to Nanking, where he served as one member of a delegation of three to meet with officials of the Taiping, and in 1868 with Griffith John to the capital of Szechuen and the source of the Han. He completed the distribution of one million Chinese New Testaments provided by the British and Foreign Bible Society's special fund of 1855. From 1863 he was an agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society. He was succeeded by Samuel Dyer, Junior, the son of Samuel Dyer and brother-in-law of Hudson Taylor. In Chinese, he translated books on arithmetic, calculus (Loomis), algebra (De Morgan's), mechanics, astronomy (Herschel's), in collaboration with Li Shanlan, and The Marine Steam Engine (TJ Main and T Brown), as well as translations of the Gospel According to Matthew and the Gospel According to Mark. In English his chief works were Jottings on the Science of the Chinese, published in 1853, Shanghai; a collection of articles published under the title Chinese Researches by Alexander Wylie (Shanghai, 1897); Memorials of Protestant Missionaries (1867); Notes on Chinese Literature (Shanghai, 1867). He also published an article on the Nestorian Tablet in Xian. Retirement His health and eyesight were failing and he returned to London in 1877. In 1882, he sold about 20,000 Chinese titles and antique books which he had amassed in China to the Bodleian Library where it is housed as the Alexander Wylie Collection. Blind and bed-ridden, he died at his home in Hampstead on 6 February 1887 and was buried in Highgate cemetery.

The western terminus of the route is at U.S. Route 209 (US 209) in Weissport East, a CDP in Franklin Township. The eastern terminus is at PA 611 in Easton. The route begins at US 209 in Carbon County and heads southeast parallel to the Lehigh River as a four-lane divided highway to Bowmanstown, where it becomes a freeway and heads through Palmerton. Upon crossing Lehigh Gap in Blue Mountain, PA 248 enters Northampton County and becomes a two-lane undivided highway that heads southeast through rural areas, serving Bath and Nazareth. From here, the route heads southeast through suburban areas to Wilson, where it turns east and follows city streets through Easton. The portion of road between Weissport and Lehigh Gap was originally designated as part of US 309 when the U.S. Highway System in 1926. In 1927, PA 45 was designated and ran between Weissport and Easton, running concurrent with US 309 before turning south from the Lehigh Gap along the Lehigh River to Northampton and then east to Bath. The route was moved to a more direct alignment between Lehigh Gap and Bath a year later. PA 45 originally had its eastern terminus in Easton at US 22 at the intersection of 13th and Northampton streets in Easton. The route was extended east along Northampton Street to the Northampton Street Bridge over the Delaware River following the rerouting of US 22 to a freeway in 1955. In the 1950s, PA 29 replaced the US 309 designation concurrent with PA 45 between Weissport and Lehigh Gap. In 1961, PA 29/PA 45 was upgraded to a divided highway, with the portion between Bowmanstown and Lehigh Gap built as a freeway. PA 248 was designated to its current alignment on May 9, 1966, replacing the PA 29 and PA 45 designations. Route description =Carbon County= PA 248 eastbound near Lehigh Gap PA 248 begins at an intersection with US 209 near the borough of Weissport in Carbon County, where the road continues north as Canal Street. From this intersection, the route heads southeast as a four-lane divided highway called the POW/MIA Remembrance Highway, passing near residential areas in Weissport East as it passes through Franklin Township a short distance to the east of the border with Weissport. The road continues southeast and runs between commercial areas to the northeast and parallel to the Lehigh River and Norfolk Southern's Lehigh Line to the southwest. PA 248 enters the borough of Parryville and curves to the east-southeast, passing under Interstate 476 (Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension) before it reaches an intersection with Center Street that heads north to provide access to Parryville. After this, the route heads southeast and crosses the Pohopoco Creek, at which point it enters Lower Towamensing Township and curves south through forested areas parallel to the Lehigh River and the Norfolk Southern railroad tracks. The road heads into the borough of Bowmanstown and intersects a westbound entrance ramp from the borough before it passes over the railroad tracks. PA 248 curves southeast and passes near residential and commercial areas, reaching an eastbound right-in/right-out intersection with the eastern terminus of PA 895. Past this, the highway comes to a westbound exit ramp to Bank Street that provides access to Bowmanstown and PA 895 from the westbound direction. The route becomes a freeway and heads southeast through wooded areas between Mauch Chunk Road and the Norfolk Southern line to the northeast and the Lehigh River to the southwest, crossing into the borough of Palmerton. PA 248 heads east and northeast alongside the river, with Mauch Chunk Road and the railroad tracks heading farther north. The freeway comes to a trumpet interchange with Delaware Avenue that provides access to Palmerton and curves southeast, heading back into Lower Towamensing Township and passing over the Norfolk Southern tracks again. The route continues through wooded areas with the railroad tracks and the Lehigh River parallel to the southwest, crossing the Aquashicola Creek before it traverses the Lehigh Gap, where the Blue Mountain ridge is located. Within the Lehigh Gap, the westbound lanes of the highway are elevated over the eastbound lanes. =Northampton County= Upon passing through the Lehigh Gap, PA 248 enters Lehigh Township in Northampton County, which is in the Lehigh Valley, and the freeway ends upon intersecting the northern terminus of PA 873 in the community of Weiders Crossing. At this point, the Appalachian Trail begins following PA 248. A short distance later, the route intersects the northern terminus of PA 145, at which point it turns southeast away from the Lehigh River and narrows to a two-lane undivided road called Lehigh Drive, with the Appalachian Trail heading to the northeast. The road passes through forests before continuing into a mix of farmland, woods, and development. PA 248 intersects the western terminus of PA 946 in the community of Berlinsville and continues through rural areas with some development. The route passes through the community of Indianland before it reaches Cherryville, where it intersects Blue Mountain Drive. The road winds east through a mix of farms, trees, and residences, passing through Pennsville. PA 248 heads into Moore Township and continues through rural land as Pheasant Drive, crossing the Hokendauqua Creek and passing through the community of Beersville before curving southeast at the community of Dannersville. The route enters East Allen Township and passes a mix of residential areas and farmland as West Main Boulevard, curving to the east. PA 248 continues into the borough of Bath and becomes West Main Street, lined with homes. The road curves southeast and intersects PA 987 and the eastern terminus of PA 329 at Race Street. At this point, PA 987 joins PA 248 for a concurrency on West Main Street, crossing the Monocacy Creek. A block later, the two routes turn north onto South Chestnut Street, passing homes. At the Northampton Street intersection, PA 248 splits to the east on Northampton Street and PA 987 continues north on North Chestnut Street. A block past PA 987, the route crosses PA 512 and continues through residential areas. PA 248 leaves Bath for Upper Nazareth Township, where the name becomes Bath Pike. (PA 248 east of Bath was previously routed along East Main Street and Newburg Road to the intersection with Nazareth Road.) The route passes to the north of Penn-Dixie Pond before it continues through agricultural areas with some residential and commercial development. The road passes through Penn Allen and Tadmor before it crosses PA 946 in the community of Christian Springs. Past this intersection, PA 248 passes near a few homes before it runs between two quarries. The road forms the border between the borough of Nazareth to the north and Upper Nazareth Township passes to the south of a cement plant and crosses Norfolk Southern's Cement Secondary. The route becomes the border between Nazareth to the north and Lower Nazareth Township to the south as it runs between another cement plant to the north and the abandoned Nazareth Speedway to the south. PA 248 heads into commercial areas and intersects PA 191, at which point that route turns east to join PA 248 along Easton Road, with the road fully entering the borough of Nazareth. PA 191 splits to the north towards the center of Nazareth while PA 248 heads southeast along Easton-Nazareth Highway and continues into Lower Nazareth Township, passing between a cement plant to the northeast and a mix of farmland and commercial development to the southwest. The road runs between a couple warehouses and businesses to the northeast and farms and homes to the southwest before it widens into a four-lane divided highway and reaches an interchange with the PA 33 freeway. Past this interchange, PA 248 passes by shopping centers before it crosses into Palmer Township. The route becomes Nazareth Road, a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane, and passes commercial development before running between farmland and businesses to the northeast and residential neighborhoods to the southwest. The road heads past more suburban neighborhoods before it curves south into a commercial area as a two-lane road and passes to the west of the Palmer Park Mall. PA 248 turns southwest and widens to four lanes, passing homes in the community of Palmer Park and Palmer Heights. The route becomes a divided highway and heads into commercial areas, where it reaches an interchange with the westbound lanes of the US 22 freeway. PA 248 turns east onto four-lane divided Northampton Street, with 25th Street heading south to provide access to the eastbound lanes of US 22. A short distance later, the road crosses under US 22 and enters the borough of Wilson, where it passes more businesses before narrowing into a two-lane undivided road and heading through residential areas. The route runs past more homes and a few businesses, entering the city of Easton at the 15th Street intersection. PA 248 is lined with homes as it continues east through the city to the 7th Street intersection. Here, the route turns north briefly on 7th Street before heading northeast on Prospect Avenue. PA 248 turns east onto Pearl Street and runs between the Bushkill Creek to the north and neighborhoods to the south, passing through wooded areas. The route turns east onto Bushkill Street and runs between the US 22 freeway to the north and urban neighborhoods to the south, with a ramp from eastbound US 22 at 4th Street and a ramp to eastbound US 22 at 2nd Street. PA 248 curves south and becomes Larry Holmes Drive, reaching its eastern terminus at PA 611 a block later. Past this intersection, Larry Holmes Drive continues south as part of PA 611 parallel to the Delaware River. History When Pennsylvania legislated routes in 1911, the portion of road between Weissport and Lehigh Gap was designated as part of Legislative Route 163, which ran from Allentown to Mauch Chunk (present-day Jim Thorpe) while the portion of road between Bath and Easton was designated as part of Legislative Route 175, which continued west from Bath to Northampton and up the Lehigh River to Walnutport. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the road between Weissport and Lehigh Gap was designated as part of US 309, a route that ran from Philadelphia north to Wilkes-Barre. In 1927, PA 45 was designated concurrent with US 309 on the road between Weissport and Lehigh Gap and onto the route of Legislative Route 175 between US 309 in Lehigh Gap and US 22 in Easton. A year later, PA 45 was shifted to a more direct alignment between Lehigh Gap and Bath. By 1930, a portion of PA 45 northwest of Bath was paved, with the section between Lehigh Gap and east of Walnutport under construction. PA 45 followed Northampton Street into Easton, where it ended at US 22 at the intersection of 13th and Northampton streets. US 22 continued along Northampton Street east of this intersection while US 22 Byp. was designated to bypass downtown Easton to the north along Prospect Avenue, Pearl Street, and Bushkill Street. US 22 was realigned to replace US 22 Byp. along Prospect Avenue, Pearl Street, and Bushkill Street in the 1940s. In the 1950s, US 309 was shifted to a new alignment farther west between Allentown and Hazleton, and PA 29 was shifted to use the road between Lehigh Gap and Weissport along with PA 45. In 1955, US 22 was moved to the Lehigh Valley Thruway, and PA 45 was extended east along Northampton Street through downtown Easton to the Northampton Street Bridge over the Delaware River while the former alignment of US 22 along Prospect Avenue, Pearl Street, and Bushkill Street became unnumbered. In 1961, PA 29/PA 45 was upgraded to a divided highway between Weissport and Lehigh Gap, with the portion south of Bowmanstown constructed as a freeway. The freeway between Palmerton and Bowmanstown was built on a new alignment to the west, the routes previously followed State Road, Mauch Chunk Road, and White Street between the two boroughs. On May 9, 1966, PA 248 was designated to run from US 209 in Weissport east to US 611 (now PA 611) in Easton along its current alignment, replacing the PA 45 designation between Weissport and Easton along with PA 29 between Weissport and Lehigh Gap. On November 24, 1998, an act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly designated the portion of PA 248 in Carbon County as the POW/MIA Remembrance Highway in honor of soldiers who are prisoner of war (POW) or missing in action (MIA).

The existence of CTICs were first revealed by Dana Priest in a November 17, 2005 article in The Washington Post,Foreign Network at Front of CIA's Terror Fight, Dana Priest, The Washington Post 17 November 2005 while she referred to the Alliance Base in a July 2, 2005, article. The name was chosen in reference of Al Qaeda, which means \\"The Base\\" in Arabic. It was headed by a French General assigned to the Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE), and largely funded by the CIA's Counterterrorist Center. It hosted officers from Great Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Australia and the United States and was used for intelligence exchange and operational planning. Its existence was confirmed on 8 September 2006 by Christophe Chaboud, chief of the UCLAT (\\"Unit√© de Coordination de la Lutte contre le Terrorisme\\", \\"Fight against Terrorism Coordination Unit\\"), in an interview to RFI.La France abrite une cellule antiterroriste secr√®te en plein Paris, Le Monde Although intelligence exchange between intelligence agencies has become more and more widespread in the last decade, in particular following the September 11, 2001 attacks, this organisation also engaged in operations.  International cooperation between intelligence agencies  Its existence was first revealed by a November 17, 2005, article by Dana Priest in The Washington Post, who also broke the story concerning the existence of the CIA's \\"black sites\\". In the article, both the CIA and the French government declined to comment on Alliance Base, while all intelligence officers requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the project, in particular relating to its political and judicial dimensions. \\"No country wanted to be perceived as taking direction from the CIA,\\" wrote Dana Priest, while France was the only European state willing to engage in more than simple information exchange. \\"To play down the U.S. role, the center's working language is French,\\" told an anonymous source to the Washington Post investigative reporter. \\"The base selects its cases carefully, chooses a lead country for each operation, and that country's service runs the operation.\\" Furthermore, this cooperation permits \\"German case officers to read information from their own country's law enforcement authorities\\", which is prohibited by German law. Alliance Base also takes advantage of the \\"harsh laws\\" of France concerning anti-terrorism. French magistrates are allowed to detain people suspected of \\"conspiracy in relation to terrorism\\" while gathering evidence. According to the top anti-terrorist magistrate, Jean-Louis Brugui√®re, he has in the past ordered the arrest of more than 500 suspects, some with the assistance of US authorities. Dana Priest cited him as saying: \\"I have good connections with the CIA and FBI.\\" Dana Priest described the working of Alliance Base, writing that \\"The CIA brings money from its classified and ever-growing 'foreign liaison' account -- it has paid to transport some of France's suspects from abroad into Paris for legal imprisonment' [thus rendering them to France] -- and its global eavesdropping capabilities and worldwide intelligence service ties.\\" France, on the other hand, \\"brings its harsh laws, surveillance of radical Muslim groups and their network in Arab states, and its intelligence links to its former colonies\\". By reporting information to its counterparts, French intelligence agencies helped the US convict Ahmed Ressam, arrested in 1999, as well as Zacarias Moussaoui, who lived a long time in France. In the days following the 9/11 attacks, President Jacques Chirac issued an edict to French secret services ordering them to share information with US counterparts \\"as if they were your own service,\\" according to two officials who read it and were cited by Dana Priest. According to The Washington Post investigative reporter, the arrest of Christian Ganczarski, alleged to be a senior Al Qaeda leader, was one of the 12 major operations it conducted during its first years. Since the end of 2001, France has detained about 60 suspects, some with the help of the CIA, according to a CIA veteran cited by Priest. Pierre de Bousquet de Florian, director of the Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DST), said \\"There's easy exchange of information. The cooperation between my service and the American service is candid, loyal and certainly effective.\\" Jean-Louis Brugi√®re, on the other hand, was quoted by Dana Priest as saying that \\"The relations between intelligence agencies in the United States and France has been good, even during the transatlantic dispute over Iraq, for practical reasons\\". John E. McLaughlin, former director of the CIA, has claimed that the cooperation between the DGSE and the CIA \\"is one the best of the world\\".  Christian Ganczarski and Ahmed Medhi  Christian Ganczarski, a German convert to Islam, took an Air France flight from Riyadh on June 3, 2003, back to Germany, with a change of planes in Paris. But he was secretly followed on board by an undercover officer. In Paris' airport, a senior CIA officer was waiting for him, while French authorities separated him from his family and arrested him, on charges of association with terrorists. This operation was conceived at the Alliance Base. On May 20, 2003, Alliance Base learned that Ahmed Mehdi, who lived near Ganczarksi in Germany, was about to travel for a 14-day vacation to La R√©union, a French island in the Indian Ocean. Although the German BND thought that he was planning an attack, they had not enough evidence to arrest him. The CIA arranged someone to suggest that Mehdi stop in Paris on his way to La R√©union. The French services clandestinely helped him to have a visa, while the Germans monitored calls and contacts. On June 1, 2003, he was arrested by French authorities at Charles de Gaulle Airport and sent to Fresnes Prison. Two days later, Ganczarksi was also there. Following interrogations of both men, investigators suspected that they had links with the Hamburg cell, which plotted the September 11 attacks.

Churches usually hold the week-long events during the summer, though the lengths of such programs may vary, and they are sometimes held during other times of the year. History The origins of Vacation Bible School can be traced back to Hopedale, Illinois in 1894. Sunday school teacher D. T. Miles, who also was a public school teacher, felt she was limited by time constraints in teaching the Bible to children. So, she started a daily Bible school to teach children during the summer. The first Bible school enrolled forty students and lasted four weeks. A local school was used for classes, while an adjoining park was used for recess. In 1898 Virginia Sinclair Hawes (often identified as \\"Mrs. Walker Aylett Hawes\\"), director of the children's department at Epiphany Baptist Church in New York City, started an \\"Everyday Bible School\\" for neighborhood children during the summer at a rented beer parlor in New York's East Side. There is a bronze plaque honoring her efforts located in her hometown of Charlottesville, Virginia in the foyer of First Baptist Church. Robert Boville of the Baptist Mission Society became aware of the Hawes' summer program and recommended it to other Baptist churches. Boville established a handful of summer schools which were taught by students at the Union Theological Seminary. During one summer, one thousand students were enrolled in five different schools. In 1922, he founded the World Association of Daily Vacation Bible School. One year later, Standard Publishing produced the very first printed VBS curriculum. Enough material was provided for a five-week course for three age levels (kindergarten, primary, and junior). While not under the title of Vacation Bible School, Dr. Abraham L. Latham of the Third Presbyterian Church in Chester, Pennsylvania initiated a five-week, four hour per day summer bible school in 1912 which at its peak had 650‚Äì700 students. This has been claimed to be the world's first summer bible school. =Today= Today, many churches run their own Vacation Bible School programs without being under the umbrella of a national organization. Some churches opt to use themed curriculum programs such as under the sea, etc. from their respective denominations or independent publishing houses which provide easy preparation and include marketing tools. Modern programs usually consist of a week-long program of religious education which may employ Bible stories, religious song, arts and crafts, skits, or puppet shows which cater toward elementary school-aged children. Groups of local churches who do not have the resources to run VBS for the entire summer may elect to coordinate their schedules to provide continuous childcare. Most churches provide VBS programs at no cost to those attending. Some churches, however, may charge a fee for the program. The cost, if any, is established by the church. Studies have show VBS is on the decline. Barna Research found 81 percent of U.S. churches offering VBS in 1997, by 2012 that number had dropped to 68 percent.

Baskerville, \\"Wyndham, Sir William, third baronet (c. 16881740)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006. of Orchard Wyndham in Somerset, was an English Tory politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1710 to 1740. He served as Secretary at War in 1712 and Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1713 during the reign of the last Stuart monarch, Queen Anne (1702‚Äì1714). He was a Jacobite leader firmly opposed to the Hanoverian succession and was leader of the Tory opposition in the House of Commons during the reign of King George I (1714‚Äì1727) and during the early years of King George II (1727‚Äì1760). His first wife was Lady Catherine Seymour, the younger of the two daughters of Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset (died 1748), and in her children by Wyndham, heiress to half of the vast estates, including Petworth House in Sussex and Egremont Castle in Cumberland, formerly held by the extinct Percy family, Earls of Northumberland. As a result of this complex inheritance his eldest son became the 2nd Earl of Egremont. Both his sons became earls and his daughter Elizabeth Wyndham was both the wife and mother of Prime Ministers, namely George Grenville and William Wyndham Grenville respectively. He built the pier at Watchet harbour, near Orchard Wyndham.Emeny, Richard, A Description of Orchard Wyndham, 2000, p.3 (guide-booklet available at Orchard Wyndham) Origins He was the son and heir of Sir Edward Wyndham, 2nd Baronet (c. 16671695) of Orchard Wyndham, three times Member of Parliament for Ilchester, Somerset, by his wife Katherine Leveson-Gower, eldest daughter of Sir William Leveson-Gower, 4th Baronet. Career Hanover shown in the 4th quarter He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. As a young man while at Rome on his Grand Tour he was approached by a fortune teller who warned him to \\"beware of a white horse\\". A similar prophecy was made to him later in England. He later surmised that the white horse in question represented the Saxon Steed in the coat of arms of the King of Hanover, King George I of England, shown in the 4th quarter of the royal arms of England, his opposition to whom would later cause him much trouble. He entered parliament as Member of Parliament for Somerset at a by-election on 26 April 1710 and was returned again at the 1710 British general election. He became Secretary at War in the Tory ministry in 1712 and Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1713. He was closely associated with the radical Tory leader Lord Bolingbroke and was privy to the attempts made to bring about a Jacobite restoration on the death of Queen Anne (1702‚Äì1714). On the failure of the plot he was dismissed from office, and in 1714 was briefly imprisoned. =Leader of Jacobites= At the start of the reign of the Hanoverian King George I (1714‚Äì1727), Bolingbroke fled into exile in France to join the court of the Old Pretender, and Wyndham took his place in England as the leader of the Jacobites. A rebellion to oust King George was planned for the summer of 1715, and Wyndham sent a message to the Pretender in July \\"not to lose a day in going over\\".Cruickshanks, Eveline, Wyndham, Sir William, 3rd Bt. (?1688-1740), of Orchard Wyndham, Somerset, published in History of Parliament: House of Commons 1715-1754, ed. R. Sedgwick, 1970 However, the rebellion was discovered and Wyndham's role was laid before the cabinet, attended by both the king and the 6th Duke of Somerset, Wyndham's father-in-law, who although a member of the Whig government and a firm supporter of the Hanoverian Succession, wanted to protect his son-in-law from arrest, and thus volunteered to \\"be responsible for him\\". Most ministers were inclined to agree to this for fear of offending a person of such consequence, yet Lord Townshend, Secretary of State for the Northern Department, in the belief that the government needed to show firmness, moved the motion to have him arrested. Ten minutes of silence ensued while the other ministers considered their own responses, and finally two or three others seconded the motion and the arrest was decreed by the king, who on retiring to his closet took Townshend's hand and told him: \\"you have done me a great service today\\".Cobbet, William, Cobbett's Parliamentary History of England, Volume 7, London, 1811, pp. 218‚Äì9. Lord Stanhope brought down to the Commons a message from the King, desiring their consent for apprehending six members of their House on a charge of \\"being engaged in a design to support the intended invasion of the kingdom\\",Cruickshanks, Eveline, Forster, Thomas (1683-1738), of Adderstone, Northumb., published in History of Parliament: House of Commons 1715-1754, ed. R. Sedgwick, 1970 namely Sir William Wyndham, Sir John Pakington, 4th Baronet, Edward Harvey (MP for Clitheroe),Watson, Paula; Harrison Richard, Harvey, Edward (1658-1736), of Coombe, Surr., published in History of Parliament: House of Commons 1690-1715, ed. D. Hayton, E. Cruickshanks, S. Handley, 2002 Thomas Forster, John Anstis, and Corbet Kynaston. Consent was granted. Harvey and Anstis were in London, and were at once taken. Harvey stabbed himself in the breast in two or three places but his wounds were not mortal. Forster escaped and served as General of the Jacobite army in the 1715 Uprising. Handbill publishing the Royal Proclamation, dated 23 September 1715, for the \\"discovery and apprehension of Sir William Wyndham, Baronet\\" Accordingly, Colonel John Huske of the \\"foot- guards\\" (i.e. Coldstream Guards), at about this time an aide-de-camp to William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan, was sent to arrest Wyndham at home at Orchard Wyndham. The story is related in detail by the contemporary commentator Boyer (1716).Boyer, Abel, Political State of Great Britain, Volume X, London, 1716, pp. 330‚Äì6 He was awoken at 5 in the morning and on searching his bedroom the colonel found incriminating papers in his waistcoat pocket, which listed his co-conspirators who planned to invade England and place the Old Pretender on the throne. The colonel had orders to \\"use him with decorum\\" and trusted Wyndham when he gave his word that at 7 am, having dressed and said goodbye to his pregnant wife, he would be dressed and ready to depart as the colonel's prisoner, and would even lay on his own coach and six horses for the purpose. Wyndham however escaped by the third unguarded door of his chamber and fled, it is said by having jumped out of a window onto a waiting horse. This caused the king to circulate a hand-bill headed \\"Proclamation for apprehending Sir William Wyndham, Baronett\\", dated 23 September 1715, which offered a huge reward of ¬£1,000 for his capture. Seeing that his case was hopeless, having for a while disguised himself as a clergyman, he visited his father-in-law the Duke of Somerset at his seat of Syon House, near London. From there he went to London and surrendered himself to the Duke's son and his brother-in-law the Earl of Hertford, a captain in the King's Lifeguards, and was taken into custody in the Tower of London. The 6th Duke of Somerset offered bail to the council for Wyndham's liberty, which was refused. It was soon after having made that offer that the king dismissed him from the high office of Master of the Horse. Under King George I (1714‚Äì1727) and during the early years of King George II (1727‚Äì1760) Wyndham was the leader of the Tory opposition in the House of Commons and fought for his High Church and Tory principles against Sir Robert Walpole. He was in constant communication with the exiled Bolingbroke and after 1723 was actively associated with him in abortive plans for the overthrow of Walpole. =\\"Gumdahm\\" pseudonym= He appears as \\"Gumdahm\\" in the parliamentary reports published from 1738 onwards under the title of the \\"Debates in the Senate of Magna Lilliputia\\" in the Gentleman's Magazine, in which to circumvent the prohibition of the publication of parliamentary debates the real names of the various debaters were replaced by pseudonyms and anagrams and the debates reported were stated to have been \\"those of that country which Gulliver had so lately rendered illustrious, and which untimely death had prevented that enterprising traveller from publishing himself\\", that is to say works of fiction in the style of Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. The published speeches, including some of those of William Pitt, were in fact often literary masterpieces wholly invented by the magazine's contributors, including William Guthrie and Samuel Johnson.Graham, Harry, The Mother of Parliaments, Boston USA, 1911, pp. 279‚Äì80. =Foundling Hospital= Despite these various enmities, Wyndham was a respected participant in public life in London. He was one of the founding governors of the Foundling Hospital, as recorded in that charity's royal charter of 1739. This was perhaps due to the fact that his father-in-law the 6th Duke of Somerset became a founding governor after his second wife, Charlotte Finch (1711‚Äì1773), became the first to sign the petition to King George II of its founder Captain Thomas Coram. This institution, the country's first and only children's home for foundlings, was then London's most fashionable charity and Wyndham served as a governor with such other notables as Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave, Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington, Henry Pelham, Arthur Onslow, Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole of Wolterton and even Sir Robert Walpole himself. Marriages and children Wyndham married twice. His first marriage was to Lady Catherine Seymour, the younger of the two daughters of Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset, KG (1662‚Äì1748), and sister of Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset (1684‚Äì1750). On her brother's death in 1750 she became (with the 7th Duke's only daughter Lady Elizabeth Seymour and her husband Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet) one of two co-heirs to the vast estates formerly belonging to the ancient Percy family, former Earls of Northumberland, including of Egremont Castle in Cumberland and of the jewel in the crown Petworth House in Sussex, rebuilt in palatial style by her father the 6th Duke, whose first wife had been the great heiress Lady Elizabeth Percy (1667‚Äì1722), only daughter and sole heiress of Joceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland (1644‚Äì1670) of Petworth House and Alnwick Castle in Northumberland. By his wife Lady Catherine Seymour he had two sons and three daughters including: * Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont (1710‚Äì1763), of Petworth House, who succeeded as 4th baronet on his father's death in 1740 and in 1750 succeeded as 2nd Earl of Egremont, under a special remainder, on the death of his uncle the 7th Duke of Somerset. * Percy Wyndham-O'Brien, 1st Earl of Thomond (c. 1713/23-1774), of Shortgrove, Essex, created in 1756 Earl of Thomond, having adopted the additional surname of O'Brien after having been chosen as heir to his estates by the childless Henry O'Brien, 8th Earl of Thomond (1688‚Äì1741), married to his aunt Lady Elizabeth Seymour, the eldest of the two daughters of the 6th Duke of Somerset. He died unmarried and without children when the earldom became extinct. * Elizabeth Wyndham, wife of George Grenville, Prime Minister and mother of William Wyndham Grenville, Prime Minister. Sir William's second wife was Maria Catherina de Jonge, the widow of William Godolphin, Marquess of Blandford. Death and burial He died at Wells, Somerset, on 17 June 1740, after having fallen from his horse (\\"white of course\\"), whilst out hunting.

It was brought to market by Hoechst Marion Roussel (now Sanofi- Aventis) and was marketed under various brand names, including Seldane in the United States, Triludan in the United Kingdom, and Teldane in Australia. It was superseded by fexofenadine in the 1990s due to the risk of a particular type of disruption of the electrical rhythms of the heart (specifically cardiac arrhythmia caused by QT interval prolongation) and has been withdrawn from markets worldwide. Pharmacology Terfenadine acts as a peripherally- selective antihistamine, or antagonist of the histamine H1 receptor. It is a prodrug, generally completely metabolized to the active form fexofenadine in the liver by the enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4. Due to its near complete metabolism by the liver immediately after leaving the gut, terfenadine normally is not measurable in the plasma. Terfenadine itself, however, is cardiotoxic at higher doses, while its major active metabolite is not. Terfenadine, in addition to its antihistamine effects, also acts as a potassium channel blocker (Kv11.1 encoded by the gene hERG). Since its active metabolite is not a potassium channel blocker, no cardiotoxicity is associated with fexofenadine. Sudden toxicity is possible even after years of use without problems as a result of an interaction with other medications such as erythromycin, or foods such as grapefruit. The addition of, or a dosage increase in, these CYP3A4 inhibitors makes it harder for the body to metabolize and remove terfenadine. In larger plasma concentrations, it may lead to toxic effects on the heart's rhythm (e.g. ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes). History In the United States, Seldane was brought to market in 1985 as the first nonsedating antihistamine for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. In June 1990, evidence of serious ventricular arrhythmias among those taking Seldane prompted the FDA to issue a report on the risk factors associated with concomitant use of the drug with macrolide antibiotics and ketoconazole. Two months later, the FDA required the manufacturer to send a letter to all physicians, alerting them to the problem; in July 1992, the existing precautions were elevated to a black box warning and the issue attracted mass media attention in reports that people with liver disease or who took ketoconazole, an antifungal agent, or the antibiotic erythromycin, could suffer cardiac arrhythmia if they also took Seldane. In January 1997, the same month when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had earlier approved a generic version of Seldane made by IVAX Corporation of Miami, the FDA recommended terfenadine-containing drugs be removed from the market and physicians consider alternative medications for their patients. Seldane (and Seldane-D, terfenadine combined with the decongestant pseudoephedrine) were removed from the U.S. market by their manufacturer in late 1997 after the FDA approval of Allegra-D (fexofenadine/pseudoephedrine). Terfenadine-containing drugs were subsequently removed from the Canadian market in 1999, and are no longer available for prescription in the UK.

The park is situated around a steep gorge in which the Falling Water River drops in elevation in less than a mile, culminating in a cataract waterfall. The Burgess Falls State Natural Area, which covers , is managed by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. Geography Middle Falls along the Falling Water River The Falling Water River rises near the base of the Cumberland Plateau in eastern Putnam County and winds its way across the Highland Rim to its mouth along the Center Hill Lake impoundment of the Caney Fork, which is located in an area where the Highland Rim drops off into the Central Basin. The Burgess Falls State Natural Area comprises the section of the river just above its mouth, where the river drops from roughly atop the Highland Rim to just over at Center Hill Lake. Over a long period of time, the Falling Water River's rapids have cut a deep gorge just above its mouth. The river drops to the Central Basin in a series of cascades and waterfalls, each gaining in size and intensity as the river approaches Center Hill Lake. At the Falling Water Cascades, located just downstream from the old Burgess Falls Dam, the river gradually spills over a embankment of rocks. Almost immediately downstream from the Cascades, the river drops another at Little Falls. Beyond Little Falls, where the river briefly bends to the north, is an cascade known as Middle Falls. Downstream from Middle Falls, where the river bends westward again, is the Burgess Falls. The distance between Falling Water Cascades and Burgess Falls is less than a mile. Burgess Falls spills into a large limestone gorge enclosed by sheer walls high. The Falling Water River enters Center Hill Lake downstream from Burgess Falls. History Burgess Falls Dam Burgess Falls is named after Tom Burgess, a Revolutionary War veteran who settled along this section of the Falling Water River in the 1810s. The Burgess family used the river's rapids to power a grist mill and eventually a saw mill which supplied early settlers with corn meal and lumber.Robert Brandt, Touring the Middle Tennessee Backroads (Winston-Salem, N.C.: John F. Blair, 1995), 368-370. In 1924, the City of Cookeville built an earthen dam along the river a mile or so upstream from Burgess Falls. After a flood destroyed the dam in 1928, the city replaced it with a concrete dam that provided the area with electricity until the arrival of the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1944. Due in large part to calls from Cookevillians to protect the area, Burgess Falls State Park was established in 1971. Part of a pipeline bridge still spans the river in the vicinity of Little Falls. The pipeline originally crossed the river into a tunnel on the north walls of the gorge and emerged to cross the river again near Middle Falls en route to a powerhouse. Access Profile view of Burgess Falls, showing the walls of the gorge The entrance to Burgess Falls State Park is located just off Tennessee State Route 135 roughly halfway between Cookeville and Sparta. The park is open year- round, but is closed on days of high precipitation due to the Falling Water River's volatility. A loop trail follows the bluffs along the south bank of the gorge, starting at Falling Water Cascades and ending at a platform overlooking Burgess Falls. Little Falls and Middle Falls are also visible from the trail. A stairway leads down to the overhang of Burgess Falls and continues down into the gorge. A second loop trail follows the ridgeline southwest of Burgess Falls. The Burgess Falls State Natural Area includes Burgess Falls Lake and part of the forest on the both sides of the river in the lake's vicinity.

It belongs to the Nyingma order of Vajrayana Buddhism. The monastery built around the then small hamlet of Gangtok became a religious centre. The location was blessed by Lama Drupthob Karpo, a renowned exponent of tantric (adept) art in Buddhism with flying powers; initially a small Gompa was established by him after he flew from Maenam Hill in South Sikkim to this site. The literal meaning of Enchey Monastery is the \\"Solitary Monastery\\". Its sacredness is attributed to the belief that Khangchendzonga and Yabdean ‚Äì the protecting deities ‚Äì reside in this monastery. As, according to a legend, Guru Padmasambhava had subdued the spirits of the Khangchendzonga, Yabdean and MahƒÅkƒÅla here. In view of this legend, the religious significance of Enchey Monastery is deeply ingrained in every household in Gangtok. It is also believed that these powerful deities always fulfil the wishes of the devotees. Geography The monastery is built on a stunning ridge of a hill above the Gangtok city to its northeast from where the Kanchendzonga range is visible. It is located on Gangtok ‚Äì Nathula road, above the Siniolochu lodge and passes through an avenue of sylvan coniferous trees, bypassing the TV telecommunications tower. It is about from the northeast of the main market place in Gangtok. Even though it is a small monastery situated on a strategic peak overlooking Gangtok, compared to other monasteries in Sikkim, it provides views of the Kanchendzonga peak. Architecture Ornately carved colourful Window of prayer hall The monastery was first built in the 1840s by the eighth Chogyal and as a result, Gangtok as the small hamlet became a pilgrimage place. However, the monastery as seen now was aesthetically built in 1909, one of the two in Gangtok, like a Chinese Pagoda during the rule of Sikyong Tulku (1909‚Äì1910). The monastery was built at the exact location where Lama Druptub Karbo had his hermitage. The monastery is topped by a shining golden cupola. It houses a number of images of Gods, Goddesses and religious objects. The deities worshipped in the monastery are the Buddha, Loki Sharia and Guru Padmasambhava. The walls of the monastery in the large prayer hall are fully covered with paintings and murals of four religious kings, the deities of the four cardinal directions as stated in the scriptures and the entire galaxy of Mahayan Buddhist deities. Manuscripts of scriptures are kept in an almirah. The four pillars supporting the roof of the monastery are elaborately carved. Built under the Nyingma order, it houses 90 monks. The windows of the monastery are very ornately carved and painted. The monastery has a large collection of masks which are used for the annual ritual dances. As its name implies, monastery has a peaceful atmosphere and also maintains a good library. A very serene atmosphere has been created with the colourful prayer flags fluttering around the monastery. Like all other Nyingmapa monasteries in Sikkim, this monastery is also under the jurisdiction of the Pemayangtse Monastery. The monastery was gutted in 1947. However, it was rebuilt in 1948 with the support of the devotees. =Earthquake damage= In a reconnaissance report on Sikkim Earthquake of 14 February 2006, it was noted that the Enchey Monastery, apart from other buildings in Sikkim, also suffered severe damages in the 2006 Earthquake (with the maximum intensity of shaking as VII on MSK scale); wide shear and vertical cracks were noted in masonry walls, at corners and near openings. It was not the first time that the monastery, among other masonry structures in Sikkim, was subject to damages by earthquake. Earthquake events in the 1980 and 1988 had also caused damage to the monastery but the repairs done were not adequate, as in 2006, the masonry wall of the building suffered damages again. The report has observed that \\"The damage seen in and around Gangtok was clearly disproportionate to the size of the earthquake, which was a moderate 5.7 on the Richter scale. This very clearly establishes the high level of seismic vulnerability of the region. Such disproportionate damage is a direct consequence of poor design and construction practices in an inadequate professional environment that is challenged by the lack of trained human resources in the state.\\" Sikkim as a whole, and particularly masonry structures, are vulnerable to suffer damages from such severe earthquakes. Hence, it has been suggested to adopt \\"safer constructions through choice of appropriate construction systems, incorporation of earthquake resistant technology, use of good construction materials and their quality control, and involvement of competent manpower for design, construction and supervision.\\" The Enchey Monastery, a heritage structure built in stone masonry with 500 mm thick walls, is a double storied structure with timber frames making up the columns and beams in the roof and also in the flooring. Galvanised iron sheet roofing is also supported on wooden trusses. The masonry wall was damaged due to seismic shear. The decorative plaster of the walls also fell off due to cracks in the masonry walls and spoiled some of the beauty of the structure. Grouting of the cracks was suggested as a solution to strengthen the damaged portions of the walls. Festival Detor Cham is the colourful and vibrant Cham dance festival that is held in the monastery during on the 18th and 19th day of the 12th Lunar month of the Tibetan calendar, corresponding to the dates during January/February of the Gregorian calendar. Other festivals observed in the Enchey Monastery are: the Singhe Chaam performed once every three years, Pang Lhabsol commemorating the swearing of blood-brotherhood between the Bhutias and Lepchas in the presence of Khangchendzonga as witness. The Cham dances are mask dances where the dancers wearing ornate robes perform dances representing the Tibetan deity figurines of Mahakala (the protector) and mythical snow lions; both depict a third eye on their foreheads to represent the \\"need for inner reflection.\\" The dance festivals are usually held prior to the Losar, the Tibetan New Year day (February/March) and Losoong, the Sikkimese New Year (December/January).

According to the , it has a population of people. Nestled at the foot of a dormant volcano, Mount Matutum, Tupi is considered as the fruit, vegetable and flower basket of South Cotabato. History Tupi derived from the word \\"Tufi\\" which was a vine chewed by native Blaan tribes who first inhabited the land. Tufi was abundant in the original forests and had a refreshing taste. As it lies in the dormant foot of Mt. Matutum, Tupi's fertile soil of volcanic ash offers a great enticement to speculators and investors particularly in the field of agriculture. In 1936 during the commonwealth government, President Manuel L. Quezon appointed Major General Paulino Santos as General Manager for the development of Koronadal and the vast land in the Allah Valley. Settlers from Luzon and the Visayas starting to arrive transforming the once large forest into a flourishing area of agriculture. The Bario of Tupi was created into a municipality of Tupi by virtue of executive order 612 of President Elpidio Quirino on September 11, 1953. The first set of appointed officials were inducted on October 2 of that year. Barangays Tupi is politically subdivided into 15 barangays: Climate Demographics Economy Tupi's climate and soil type makes it suitable to all types of crop and livestock production. Tupi aside from pineapple, tropical fruits and vegetables is identified as suited for high- value commercial crops (HVCC) like asparagus and papaya. Cutflower production is one crop that is putting Tupi on the regional map. Tupi is likewise identified as one of the areas in the province well suited for poultry production. To date, there are around 34 major poultry raisers scattered in the municipality with minimum of 10,000 heads capacity. Tupi had been identified in the Soccsksargen Growth Plan as one of the areas where a satellite Food Terminal shall be located. To date, a private organization, the DARBCI initiated the establishment of an initial 70 hectare Economic Zone within the Municipality of Tupi. One of the future investment eyed as an economic booster is the establishment of an Integrated Food Terminal. On this aspect, private investors are welcome to finance major economic endeavors within the economic zone. Tupi, which is basically an agricultural municipality, devotes 19% of its total land area to agricultural production. Major agricultural crops are pineapple, papaya, asparagus, fruits, vegetables, corn, coffee, bananas, cut-flowers. Other high value commercial products include wood products and processed food. The exports products are pineapple, asparagus, bottled fruit preserves, and Bongolan Banana. The existing major business establishments are Progressive Farms, Kablon Farms, Stanfilco of Dole Philippines, Blooming Petals, Inc., Eden's Flowers, Central Universal Corporation and other large scale livestock and poultry raisers distributed all over the municipality. Arts and culture *Kasadyahan Festival, \\"Sagana Sayaw sa Kadalanan-Kasadyahan\\": Celebration featuring street dancing competition coined from Visayan word \\"Kasadya\\". It is a convergence of various ethnic and cultural dances featuring Tupi as the province's flower, fruit and vegetable basket and a town where various cultures abode. Held every September 11 in celebration of the town's foundation anniversary. *Linggo ng Matutum: A weeklong festivity every March 13‚Äì20 of each year in celebration of the declaration of Mt.

The estimated time allotment from Tupi to General Santos City and vice versa is only 45~60 minutes without traffic. From General Santos City, there are trips to Tupi, the PUVs are available at the mall terminals. General Santos International Airport is 1 hour away from Tupi's town proper by using the newly constructed General Santos Diversion Road to avoid heavy traffic in General Santos City.

She was a newsreader and continuity announcer on BBC Radio 4 for more than twenty years until the end of December 2012. Early life After gaining a degree in politics from the University of Sussex, she trained as an actress at the Drama Studio in Ealing and was in the musical Evita for a year.Alison Roberts \\"Alice Arnold: You look at men of a certain age on TV and think: 'If you were a woman, you wouldn‚Äôt be there' \\", Evening Standard, 8 January 2013 She was a magistrate for ten years from the age of thirty in Tottenham.

In 2004 she became a newsreader, and regularly read the afternoon and evening news on Radio 4. For a brief period her early appearances as a newsreader were credited as \\"Eva Arnold\\", perhaps to keep her newsreading 'persona' separate from her identity as an actor. In 2005, she featured as a news presenter in BBC Two comedy Broken News. In June 2006, she was promoted to read the news on Radio 4's Today programme. From 2007 to 2011 she co-presented comedian Jon Holmes's show Listen Against, a parody of various programmes on Radio 4. Arnold gained media attention in May 2012. While returning home, stuck in traffic, she observed an empty plastic bottle being thrown from the car ahead of her and threw it back into the vehicle through an open window. On Twitter, colleague and friend Corrie Corfield said Arnold deserved a damehood for her action.

It is now on display in the British Museum, London. A provincial capital since the Old Kingdom of Egypt, Hermopolis developed into a major city of Roman Egypt, and an early Christian center from the third century. It was abandoned after the Muslim conquest but was restored as both a Latin Catholic (meanwhile suppressed) and a Coptic Orthodox titular see. Its remains are located near the modern town of el Ashmunein (from the Coptic name) in Mallawi, Minya Governorate, Egypt.  Name  Khemenu ('), the Egyptian language name of the city,Ian Shaw & Paul Nicholson, The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, British Museum Press, 1995. p.125 means \\"Eight-Town\\", after the Ogdoad, a group of eight \\"primordial\\" deities whose cult was situated there.

Mussies in: Matthieu Sybrand Huibert, Gerard Heerma van Voss (eds.), Studies in Egyptian Religion: Dedicated to Professor Jan Zandee (1982), p. 92. In Koine Greek, the city was called \\"The City of Hermes\\" since the Greeks identified Hermes with Thoth, because the city was the main cult centre of Thoth, the Pharaonic god of magic, healing, and wisdom and the patron of scribes. Thoth was associated in the same way with the Phoenician deity Eshmun. Inscriptions at the temple call the god \\"The Lord of Eshmun\\".  History  Djehutynakht, a nomarch during the Middle Kingdom era of Egypt. The city was the capital of the Hare nome (the fifteenth nome of Upper Egypt) in the Heptanomis. Hermopolis stood on the borders of Upper and Lower Egypt, and, for many ages, the Thebaid or upper country extended much further to the north than in more recent periods. As the border town, Hermopolis was a place of great resort and opulence, ranking second to Thebes alone. A little to south of the city was the castle of Hermopolis, at which point rivercraft from the Thebaid paid tolls (,Strabo xvii. p. 813; Ptol. loc. cit. the Bahr Yussef in Arabic). The grottos of Beni Hasan, near Antino√∂polis on the opposite bank of the Nile, were the common cemeteries of the Hermopolitans because although the river divided the city from its necropolis, from the wide curve of the western hills at this point, it was easier to ferry the dead over the water than to transport them by land to the hills. Hermopolis became a significant city in the Roman province of Thebais Prima in the administrative diocese of Egypt. The principal pagan deities worshipped at Hermopolis were Typhon (Set) and Thoth. Typhon was represented by a hippopotamus, on which sat a hawk fighting with a serpent.Plut. Is. et Osir, p. 371, D. Thoth, whom the ancient Greeks associated with Hermes because they were both gods of magic and writing, was represented by the ibis.  Ecclesiastical history  A Christian tradition holds it to be the place where the Holy Family found refuge during its exile in Egypt. Hermopolis Maior was a suffragan diocese of the provincial capital's Metropolitan Archdiocese of Antinoe, in the sway of the Patriarchate of Alexandria. Like most, it faded under Islam. List of bishops of Hermopolis: * Conon (circa 250) * Fasileus (in 325) * Dios (circa 350) * Plusianus (4th century) * Andreas (in 431) * Gennadius (circa 444 - after 449) * Victor (circa 448/463) * Ulpianus (6th century) * Johannes I (6th century) * Johannes II (6th-7th century) * Isidorus (7th century) * Eugenius (?) * Paulus (?) The city was a titular diocese in the Roman Catholic Church, and still is (?) in the Coptic Orthodox Church. The diocese was nominally restored in the 18th century as Latin Titular bishopric of Hermopolis Maior (Latin; 1925-1929 renamed Hermopolis Magna) / Ermopoli Maggiore (Curiate Italian) Its territory was reassigned in 1849 to the Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Mina, as a restoration of Hermopolis (as its Latin title attests).

Remains  Hermopolis comparatively escaped the frequent wars which, in the decline both of the Pharaonic and Roman eras, devastated the Heptanomis; but, on the other hand, its structures have undergone severe changes under its Muslim rulers, who have burned its stones for lime or carried them away for building materials. A surviving Oxyrhynchus Papyrus of the 3rd century AD indicates that high-rise buildings with seven stories existed in the town.Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 2719, in: Katja Lembke & C√§cilia Fluck, G√ºnter Vittmann, √Ñgyptens sp√§te Bl√ºte. Die R√∂mer am Nil, Mainz 2004, , p. 29 The collection of Arabic papyri in the John Rylands Library, Manchester, contains many documents referring to Hermopolis (Ushmun); they date from the 2nd to 4th centuries AH.Margoliouth, D. S. (1933) Catalogue of Arabic Papyri in the John Rylands Library, Manchester. Manchester: the John Rylands Library = The temple = The Ibis-headed god Thoth was, with his accompanying emblems, the Ibis and the Cynocephalus monkey, the most conspicuous among the sculptures upon the great portico of the temple of Hermopolis. His designation in inscriptions was \\"The Lord of Eshmoon\\". This portico was a work of the Pharaonic era, but the erections of the Ptolemies at Hermopolis were on a scale of great extent and magnificence and, although raised by Greek monarchs, are essentially Egyptian in their conception and execution. The portico, the only remnant of the temple, consists of a double row of pillars, six in each row. The architraves are formed of five stones; each passes from the centre of one pillar to that of the next, according to a well-known usage with Egyptian builders. The intercolumnation of the centre pillars is wider than that of the others; and the stone over the centre is twenty-five feet and six inches long. These columns were painted yellow, red and blue in alternate bands. There is also a peculiarity in the pillars of the Hermopolitan portico peculiar to themselves, or at least discovered only again in the temple of Gournou. (D√©non, L'Egypte, plate 41.) Instead of being formed of large masses placed horizontally above each other, they are composed of irregular pieces, so artfully adjusted that it is difficult to detect the lines of junction. The bases of these columns represent the lower leaves of the lotus; next come a number of concentric rings, like the hoops of a cask; and above these the pillars appear like bunches of reeds held together by horizontal bonds. Including the capital, each column is about 40 feet high; the greatest circumference is about 28¬Ω feet, about five feet from the ground, for they diminish in thickness both towards the base and towards the capital. The widest part of the intercolumnation is 17 feet; the other pillars are 13 feet apart. = Coptic Basilica = Outside the temple complex stand the remains of a basilica, built in the 5th century over earlier buildings. It is one of the most impressive Coptic buildings: 55 m long, it features a colonnaded transept ending in exedras and side galleries. The nave with the apse is 14.7 m wide, and the width of the aisles is 5.6 m. The church was discovered in 1942 by Moharam Kamal,Moharam Kamal, Excavations in the so-called Agora of El Ashmunein.

The park is named after the community of Rock Island, Tennessee, which in turn received its name from an island on the Caney Fork upstream from the Collins River confluence and Great Falls Dam.Tennessee State Parks, Rock Island State Park official park brochure. Retrieved: 29 January 2009. PDF. Rock Island State Park is centered on a peninsula created by the confluence of these two rivers and extends downstream to the headwaters of Center Hill Lake. The park consists of and is managed by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. Geographical setting Great Falls The Caney Fork winds its way westward from its source atop the Cumberland Plateau and drops down to the Highland Rim at Scott's Gulf, where it enters White County. Just past Scott's Gulf, the river gains strength, absorbing Cane Creek and the Calfkiller River as it winds along the base of the plateau. At the community of Walling, the river briefly turns southward and absorbs the Rocky River before turning westward again. Two miles beyond its Rocky River confluence, the Caney Fork absorbs the Collins and enters the Great Falls Gorge. Beyond the gorge, the river enters the upper extremes of its Center Hill Lake impoundment and begins winding its way northward toward its mouth along the Cumberland River, near Carthage. The Collins River rises atop the Cumberland Plateau several miles south of Rock Island State Park at the head of a canyon known as Savage Gulf. The river winds its way northward through a section of the Highland Rim known as \\"the Barrens,\\" and steadies as it enters the eastern section of McMinnville. The river almost joins the Caney Fork at a point just opposite the Great Falls Dam power plant, but instead bends southward to create the peninsula where the present park is located. Rock Island, the park's namesake, is an island located in the Caney Fork at , approximately upstream from the present site of Great Falls Dam. The community of Rock Island is located along Great Falls Lake east of the state park. Natural and historical features Twin Falls *The Great Falls Gorge, located between northern Great Falls Dam and the dam's powerhouse. The gorge includes Great Falls, a series of plunge and cascade waterfalls that spill into the Caney Fork when the river's water levels are low. When water levels are high, the gorge completely fills up, submerging the waterfalls. A short trail leads from the parking lot to the base of the gorge. *Twin Falls, a cascade waterfall that spills down from a cavern into the Caney Fork, just beyond the powerhouse. The waterfall was created by the Great Falls Dam, which caused the Collins River to rise. The rising waters began seeping into caverns on Rock Island's south shore and exiting at the falls on the north shore. =Historic structures= *The Great Falls Cotton Mill (also called the Falls City Cotton Mill), located on the bluffs above Great Falls. The mill was built in 1892 and operated until 1902. In 1982 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. *The Spring castle, located adjacent to the cotton mill. The \\"castle,\\" which is essentially a larger version of a spring house, was used by the cotton mill's workers for refrigeration. It was probably built in the 1890s. *The Great Falls Dam, located along the Caney Fork near the park's TN-136 entrance. The dam was built 1915-1916. In 1990 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. History The Caney Fork at low (top photo) and high (bottom photo) water levels =Industry and flooding= The history of the Caney Fork from the end of the Civil War to the beginning of the 1920s tells the story of entrepreneur after entrepreneur attempting to harness the Caney Fork's alluring power potential only to be defeated by the river's volatile flash-flood tendencies. In his \\"Ode to the Caney Fork,\\" local poet R.P. Hudson summed up this period: > Playful river, ever laughing, > Pleading river, always calling, > Rushing river, now unwieldy, > Wild, deep river, oft defiant.Crouch, The Caney Fork of the Cumberland > River, 2. Great Falls Cotton Mill, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The Bosson Mill, built around the time of the Civil War, was one of the first major mills to use the waterpower of the Great Falls Gorge. Water from the falls was used to power a grist mill on the mill's first floor and a carding factory on the second floor. Water was then diverted via flume to a sawmill downstream. The Bosson Mill, which was moderately profitable, was destroyed when the Caney Fork flooded in 1882.Crouch, The Caney Fork of the Cumberland River, 39. In 1881, the completion of a railroad brought larger industries to the area.Crouch, The Caney Fork of the Cumberland River, xi. In the mid-1880s, entrepreneur Asa Faulkner purchased the Bosson Mill property with plans to build a large cotton mill. Faulkner and several partners raised $30,000 dollars in capital and chartered the Falls City Cotton Mill Company in 1892. The company built a wheelhouse to harness the power from Great Falls and divert it to the cotton mill, higher up on the bluffs. The company also developed a small town for the mill's workers which became known as \\"Falls City.\\" Along with the spring castle that still stands, the town had its own post office and general store. In 1902, however, the company met the same fate as the Bosson Mill when the Caney Fork flooded again. The mill was high enough to escape harm, but its wheelhouse was completely wiped out. The flood also destroyed the company's tollbridge, which spanned the river just upstream. The company abandoned the mill shortly thereafter and the town died out.Crouch, The Caney Fork of the Cumberland River, 42-43. In 1904, the Great Falls Power Company purchased the Great Falls property with plans to dam the Caney Fork and provide power to the Nashville area. The company built several coffer dams, all of which were destroyed when the river flooded in 1914. The company, which often struggled with finances, finally began construction on the Great Falls Hydroelectric Plant in 1915, and the dam went into operation in 1917. The Tennessee Electric Power Company (TEPCo) purchased the Great Falls Power Company in 1922, and tripled the dam's operating capacity. The Good Friday Flood of 1929, in which the Caney Fork reached record volumes, destroyed the dam's substation and flooded its powerhouse, but the dam held.Crouch, The Caney Fork of the Cumberland River, 53-55. In 1939, the TEPCO Dam was purchased by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which continues to operate it. =The state park= The creation of a lake by the Great Falls Dam brought numerous recreational opportunities to Rock Island. The Webb Hotel arrived in the area in 1920, and several rustic cabins were built later in the decade.Carroll Van West, \\"Rock Island State Park.\\" The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 9 January 2008. By the 1930s, Rock Island had grown into a small fishing resort.The WPA Guide to Tennessee (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1986), 469. Originally compiled by the Federal Writers' Project of the Works Project Administration as Tennessee: A Guide to the State, and published in 1939. Rock Island State Park was established in 1969. The Rock Island area was used for a considerable number of exterior shots and stunts in the 1994 Sylvester Stallone film, The Specialist. The park today Spring castle Rock Island State Park currently maintains 10 cabins, 60 campsites, and a boat ramp. The park's Center Hill Lake section contains a natural sand beach and a popular fishing area known as the \\"Blue Hole.\\" Hiking trails include two trails that access the north and south banks of the Great Falls Gorge, and a trail that runs along the Collins River. Deer, woodpeckers, and wildflowers are commons sites along the park's trails. In recent years, Rock Island State Park has become popular with kayakers, who use the river for playboating. Below Great Falls Dam is a series of rapids with a well-known, constant, retentive \\"hole\\" that allows playboaters to hone their whitewater kayaking skills, riding the wave, spinning, rolling and performing other tricks. Rock Island State Park also maintains the Big Bone Cave State Natural Area, which is located a few miles to the east in Van Buren County.

Jon Lovitz plays Emperor Tod Spengo, who is the cruel, silly and over-dramatic emperor of the planet named Spengo. Teri Garr plays Marge Nelson and Jeffrey Jones plays Dick Nelson, her husband. The film also stars Eric Idle and Thalmus Rasulala. Rasulala died shortly after completing his scenes, and the film is dedicated to his memory. Plot Emperor Tod Spengo (Jon Lovitz), with General Afir (Thalmus Rasulala) at his side, takes over a small planet at the edge of the galaxy populated entirely by idiots, and renames it after himself. He has all the resources of the planet engaged to create his \\"Super Death Ray Laser\\" to destroy Earth, thus making Spengo the greatest planet in the Universe. When Spengo peeks at the laser's planned point of impact (a Southern California suburb), he beholds housewife Marge Nelson (Teri Garr) and instantly falls in love. Using his Magnobeam (a giant magnet), he kidnaps Marge and her husband Dick (Jeffrey Jones) on their way to their 20th-anniversary weekend, hoping to make Marge his wife. Dick and Marge get separated on Spengo: Marge is sent to the lap of luxury, waited on by servants with fish or dog heads, while Dick is thrown into a dungeon. In his cell, Dick meets the rightful king of Spengo, Raff (Eric Idle), who gives him plans for his son, called the White Bird, leader of a band of rebels out in the desert. In the meantime, Spengo finds that his advances towards Marge are failing, so he tries to read Dick's mind in order to discover the secret to her heart before having him executed. Upon witnessing Dick's devotion to Marge, Spengo's interrogator, Sibor (Wallace Shawn), has a change of heart and helps Dick escape. Despite the stupidity of his captors, Dick is soon discovered and forced down a garbage chute to the sewers, where he encounters a pack of carnivorous mushroom-like creatures called Lub-Lubs and is forced to run for his life. Dick manages to escape the sewers and steal an escape pod, and winds up crashing in the desert, where he meets the rebels led by King Raff's son, Sirk (Dwier Brown), and daughter, Semage (Kathy Ireland), all of them dressed as 6-foot-tall birds, although such creatures are not naturally found on Spengo. At first, the rebels don't trust Dick; but when Dick reveals that he shared a cell with Raff and that he is on their side, their attitude quickly changes, and Dick rises to the rank of war leader. Using what little resources he can scrounge up, he devises a plan to sneak back into Spengo's palace and save Marge. In the meantime, General Afir, the only intelligent person among Spengo's forces and resentful of his emperor's antics, believes that Dick and Marge are the key to ending Spengo's rule, so he switches the love serum meant for Marge with water and informs her of his intentions to recover Dick. However, Spengo overhears Afir's plan and has him placed in the barrel of the laser, to die when the weapon is fired at Earth. While Spengo's wedding with Marge is prepared, a detachment of Spengo's soldiers go into the desert to finish the rebels, but find their camp deserted, and one by one they fall victim to a Light Grenade, labeled \\"pick me up\\" (which disintegrates anyone picking it up) left on Dick's pallet. Simultaneously, Dick and the rebels approach Spengo's fortress inside a large wooden bust of Spengo, which Spengo has brought into the chapel, and in the midst of the wedding ceremony the rebels emerge from the Trojan bust. As fighting rages in the castle, Spengo retreats to his lab with Marge and prepares to fire the laser at Earth. Dick and Tod clash with swords, but neither gains the upper hand. Marge manages to free herself and help Dick throwing Spengo into the sewers, where he is devoured by the Lub-Lubs. At the last second, Dick and Marge manage to shut down the laser, saving Afir and the Earth. With Tod deceased, Raff is reinstated as the rightful king, and he reverses the polarity on the Magnobeam to send Dick and Marge back to Earth. Upon arriving home, Dick and Marge proceed to show their son (Danny Cooksey), daughter (Suzanne Ventulett), and her boyfriend Carl (Michael Stoyanov) slides (including an image of their space journey to Planet Spengo) from what they claim is \\"Santa Barbara\\". To end their anniversary, they share drinks on the roof, watching the stars.

This hybrid usage of the cars reflects an era when funeral homes offered emergency ambulance service in addition to their primary trade, especially in smaller towns and rural areas. Combination cars were often built on a Cadillac Commercial Chassis and were customized by coachbuilders such as Superior, Miller-Meteor, Hess & Eisenhardt and Cotner-Bevington. __TOC__  Design features  1961 Chrysler New Yorker Briarean Combination Combination cars often include: * Flashing lights (mounted or concealed) or a siren. Some cars used rotating roof beacons that could flash either yellow lights in processional mode, or both red and yellow lights in emergency response mode. Alternatively, a hole on the roof was often supplied where a beacon could be bolted on an intermittent basis, with a wire passing through to the driver's compartment where it could be plugged in when needed. * Two-way radio * Gurney (stretcher) or a casket. The presence of ambulance technology made combos useful in the first call role, as a gurney is also used in that function. * Foldable seats on one side in the rear compartment where a first-aid person can sit while looking after a patient on their way to the hospital * A cabinet where first-aid supplies can be stored  Decline  Usage of passenger car or station wagon derived vehicles as ambulances began to decline in the early 1970s and became impractical in the US around 1979. This was due to new federal regulations increasing the required equipment and interior space, as well as a major downsizing of the passenger cars upon which ambulances and funeral cars were previously built.

Early years Born in London, Michael Korda is the son of English actress Gertrude Musgrove, and the Hungarian-Jewish artist and film production designer Vincent Korda. He is the nephew of film magnate Sir Alexander Korda and brother Zoltan Korda, both film directors. Korda grew up in England but received part of his education in France where his father had worked with film director Marcel Pagnol. As a child, Korda also lived in the United States from 1941 to 1946. He was schooled at the private Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland and read History at Magdalen College, Oxford. He served in the Royal Air Force doing intelligence work in Germany. The novelist Graham Greene was a lifelong friend. Korda met him on his Uncle Alex Korda's yacht. Career Korda moved to New York City in 1957 where he worked for playwright Sidney Kingsley as a research assistant and then later as a freelance reader in the CBS story department. In 1958 he joined the book publishing firm, Simon & Schuster, beginning as an assistant editor, which included the task of reading slush pile manuscripts for Henry Simon. Many editors stick to one area of interest, but early on Korda demonstrated an ability and interest in editing both fiction and non-fiction. He states in his memoir that he edited books on everything from mathematics and philosophy, memoirs, fiction, translations from French, politics, anthropology and science history among others. One of the first books Korda bought was The Forest People by Colin Turnbull‚Äîa memoir of Turnbull's time living with the Mbuti Pygmies in the then Belgian Congo. After Robert Gottlieb left Simon & Schuster for Alfred A. Knopf, Korda became Editor-in-Chief of Simon & Schuster. Korda was a major figure in the book industry, publishing numerous works by high-profile writers and personalities such as William L. Shirer, Will and Ariel Durant, Harold Robbins, Irving Wallace, Richard Nixon, Richard Rhodes and Ronald Reagan. Korda was a major part of Simon & Schuster for more than forty years. In the autumn of 1994, he was diagnosed as having prostate cancer. In 1997 he wrote Man to Man, which recounted his medical experience. In 2000, he published Another Life: A Memoir of Other People, about the world of publishing. In addition to being an editor, Korda was also a writer. In the mid-sixties Korda began to write freelance articles for Glamour magazine and eventually wrote their film review column for almost ten years. Korda also wrote for Clay Felker's New York magazine including a piece that eventually became his first book, Male Chauvinism and How it Works at Home and in the Office. Korda's second book, Power!, reached the number one spot on The New York Times Bestseller list in 1975. Korda the writer was represented by agent Lynn Nesbit. Among Korda's other books are Charmed Lives, which the story of his father and his two uncles, and the novel Queenie, which is a roman √† clef about his aunt, actress Merle Oberon, which was later adapted into a television miniseries. Korda said he felt that Charmed Lives was the book he was born to write, \\"as if I had been observing and storing up memories with just that purpose in mind for years.\\" Beginning in the 2000s, Korda wrote a number of history and biography books on the Hungarian Revolution, Dwight Eisenhower, T.E. Lawrence and Robert E. Lee. On writing histories Korda said, \\"I've always wanted to write history, and it was only the accident of going to work for a book publisher in 1958 (and the need to earn a regular paycheck) that slowed me down\\". Michael Korda is Editor-in- Chief Emeritus for Simon & Schuster. Private life Michael Korda was married to Carolyn \\"Casey\\" Keese from 1958 until their divorce in 1978. They had one child together, Chris, a musician and founder of the Church of Euthanasia.

He was a court poet to King Olaf II of Norway, as well as Canute the Great, Magnus the Good and Anund Jacob, by whose reigns his floruit can be dated to the earlier eleventh century. Sigvatr was the best known of the court skalds of King Olaf and also served as his marshal (stallare).Sigvat Tordarson (Store norske leksikon) Approximately 160 verses of Sigvatr's poetry have been preserved, more than any for other poet from this period. The style of Sigvat's poems is simpler and clearer than that which generally characterises older compositions. Although his verse is still dense, he uses fewer complex poetic circumlocutions than many of his predecessors, and as a Christian poet, he by and large avoids allusions to pagan mythology.Sigvat Tordsson ‚Äì utdypning (Store norske leksikon) Most of his surviving poems were texts that praised King Olaf.

The park consists of along the shores of Center Hill Lake, an impoundment of the Caney Fork. The State of Tennessee leases the land from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. James Edgar Evins (1883‚Äì1954), the park's namesake, was a Smithville businessman and state senator who played a vital role in the development of the Center Hill Dam and Reservoir in the 1940s. He was the father of former United States Representative Joe L. Evins, for whom the nearby Joe L. Evins Appalachian Center for Craft is named. The Evins family began pushing for the establishment of a state park along the DeKalb portion of Center Hill Lake as early as the 1950s. Geographical setting Center Hill Lake, viewed from a limestone bluff near the primitive campground The Caney Fork flows down from its source atop the Cumberland Plateau and winds its way northwestward across the Eastern Highland Rim before emptying into the Cumberland River near Carthage, Tennessee. Center Hill Dam, located approximately above the mouth of the Caney Fork, has created a reservoir that spans a stretch of the river between the dam and the Great Falls Dam at Rock Island State Park in adjacent Warren County. Edgar Evins State Park covers the northeast shore of the reservoir immediately upstream from Center Hill Dam. The park is situated amidst rolling hills (\\"knobs\\") that comprise part of the geological boundary between the Eastern Highland Rim and the Central Basin. These hills are typically underlain by Mississippian period limestone, the erosion of which has created karst-like formations throughout the Center Hill Basin.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Environmental Assessment Report for the Operation and Maintenance of Center Hill Lake, Caney Fork River, Tennessee (Nashville: 1977), 37. Outcroppings of this limestone are visible along the cliffs overlooking the lake. Most of Edgar Evins State Park is coated in a second-growth hardwood forest typical of the Eastern Highland Rim. Common tree species include the tuliptree, white basswood, sugar maple, white ash, and various species of oak and hickory.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Environmental Assessment Report, 85-86. History Dunham Cemetery A pre-inundation archaeological survey of the Center Hill Basin conducted by the Smithsonian Institution located several possible prehistoric village and mound sites, including a platform mound at the mouth of Mine Lick Creek, just upstream from the modern park boundary.Smithsonian Institution - River Basin Surveys, Appraisal of the Archaeological Resources of the Center Hill Reservoir, Tennessee, 1947. 1, 16. Early settlers in the area also claimed to have found Native American graves and other objects.William Hale, History of DeKalb County, Tennessee (Nashville, Tenn.: P. Hunter, 1915), 4-5. More extensive excavations, however, failed to uncover any major prehistoric sites.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Environmental Assessment Report, 47. The earliest Euro-American settlers in the DeKalb area arrived in the late 1790s and established the town of Liberty just west of the modern park.Hale, 3. Over the years, several families settled in the hollows and valleys of what is now Edgar Evins State Park and adjacent lands that would eventually be inundated by Center Hill Lake. One such settler, Alexander Dunham (1826‚Äì1878), whose family arrived in the area in the 1830s, is buried on a hill within the park that overlooks Center Hill Lake. Dunham's son lived near the present site of Center Hill Dam.Information obtained from photographs at the Edgar Evins park offices, 2008. The Caney Fork has long been notorious for its volatility. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, business venture after business venture tried to harness the river's power, only to be defeated by one of several catastrophic floods that occurred along the river during this period.Arthur Crouch, The Caney Fork of the Cumberland: The Story of a River, Its History, Features, Moods, People and Places with Particular Reference to Rock Island and the Area Above Great Falls (Nashville, Tenn.: Crouch, 1973), 14. Major floods in 1902, 1915, 1928, and 1929 wiped out mills, bridges, houses, and farms, and led to increased calls for flood control. In the 1930s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers initiated several flood control projects in the Cumberland River watershed, including Center Hill Dam, the construction of which was authorized in 1938. Flood control and power production were the primary goals of the Center Hill Dam project.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Environmental Assessment Report, 3-5. Center Hill Lake's revised management plan in the 1940s called for the inclusion of recreational areas along the lake's shores. These included several small local parks and boatramps at first.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Environmental Assessment Report, 3. In the late 1960s, the State of Tennessee began construction of facilities for Edgar Evins State Park. The park was officially dedicated in 1975. The park today Park office and observation tower Edgar Evins State Park maintains a 300-slip marina and full service dock. Various types of watercraft may be rented at the marina. Lodging areas include a 34-cabin lodging complex and a campground with both modern and primitive campsites. Hiking trails maintained by the park include the Highland Rim Trail, which loops down, around, and back up through a hillside forest characteristic of the Eastern Highland Rim, and the Dunham Cemetery Trail, a short trail that ascends to a small cemetery where former resident Alexander Dunham and two of his children are buried (as of 2008, the trail was slated for expansion). The Millennium Trail consists of a loop that descends to the shores of Center Hill Lake and passes several pre-1940s homesteads (most of the ruins consist of rockwall-fences) before looping back into the forest. The Merritt Ridge Trail, a extension of the Millennium Trail, traverses Merritt Ridge, a steep ridge that became a peninsula with the reservoir's creation.Information obtained from trail map obtained from Edgar Evins State Park Visitor Center, 2008. The Friends of Edgar Evins State Park was organized in 2003 to support park preservation efforts. The group conducts several annual tours of the park's flora, lake, and waterfalls.\\"Edgar Evins State Park - Annual Events.\\" Retrieved: 29 July 2008.

Features Gateway of Ptolemy III and Ptolemy IV The main features of the Precinct of Montu are the Temple of Montu, Temple of Harpre, Temple of Ma'at, a sacred lake and the Gateway of Ptolemy III Euergetes / Ptolemy IV Philopator, which is the most visible structure on the site and can be easily seen from inside the Precinct of Amon-Re. This gateway is also called Bab el‚ÄôAdb. This large monumental door was reached via a dromos leading from a quay that led to a channel which connected the field to that of Montu of Medamud further north of the city. Through this gate, is reached a large court which was decorated by a colonnade dating from the 25th Dynasty period. In the south, a series of doors opened onto a series of vaults of Divine Adoratrices, which were next to the northern part of the precinct of Amun-Re.

The ruins of the temple date to the reign of Amenhotep III who rebuilt the sanctuary dating from the Middle Kingdom era and dedicated it to Montu-Re. Ramesses II increased the size of the temple by adding a forecourt and erecting two obelisks there. A large court with gantry gave on hypostyle open on the court, characteristic of the buildings of the reign of Amenhotep I.

United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research. February 2003. Nicknamed \\"Dr. Death\\" by the press for his alleged actions in apartheid South Africa, Basson was acquitted in 2002 of 67 charges, after having been suspended from his military post with full pay in 1999. Among other charges, Basson was alleged to have supplied a \\"lethal triple cocktail of powerful muscle relaxants which were used during Operation Duel (the systematic elimination of SWAPO prisoners of war and South African Defence Force [SADF] members who posed a threat to South African covert operations). The United Nations report Project Coast: Apartheid's Chemical and Biological Warfare Programme. United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research. February 2003. identifies the triple cocktail as ketamine, succinylcholine, and tubocurarine. Project Coast Much of what Basson was working on is still secret. It is known that in 1981, when he was working as a personal physician to state president P. W. Botha, the country's Surgeon- General hired Basson to work for and form 7 Medical Battalion Group, a specialist unit of the South African Military Health Service. His job was to collect information about other countries' chemical and biological warfare capabilities under the name Project Coast. After his preliminary report, Basson became the head project officer and began to work on the country's chemical and biological weapons capability. He recruited about 200 researchers from around the world and received annual funds equivalent to $10 million. In 1982, Basson is alleged to have arranged the killing of 200 SWAPO prisoners in Operation Duel. Project Coast secretly researched chemical and biological warfare in violation of the international BTWC agreement. Basson created four front companies; Delta G Scientific Company; Roodeplaat Research Laboratories (RRL), Protechnik and Infadel, which in 1989 was split into two companies ‚Äì D. John Truter Financial Consultants and Sefmed Information Services. The companies were used to officially distance the military from the project, to procure necessary chemicals and channel funds for the research. According to later investigation, Basson had a free rein to do what he wanted. Delta G did most of the research, production and development of the chemical agents, while RRL developed chemical and biological pathogens and allegedly was involved with genetic engineering. Protechnik was a large nuclear, biological and chemical warfare plant developing defences against chemical weapons. Infadel dealt with those on a smaller scale and concentrated on financing and administration of other units and possibly channelling funds between military and research facilities. Many of the employees were not aware of what they were involved with. In the 1980s Basson and the project were allegedly involved with attacks and assassinations against members of anti-apartheid movements. Leaders in South Africa, Angola and Namibia also claimed that the more dangerous chemicals were used for crowd control in the country, although the government claimed otherwise and claimed that chemical weapons were used against South African troops. Basson provided the Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB) with lethal chemicals to be used against prominent anti-apartheid activists. Basson continued to travel all over the world to gather information about chemical and biological warfare programs and set up other shell and paper companies as additional front companies, possibly for money laundering. When F. W. de Klerk became president in 1990, he ordered that production of the chemicals be stopped and the lethal agents destroyed. Basson concentrated on non-lethal chemical agents and chemicals the government had not banned. That included a large amount of ecstasy and Mandrax that were apparently exported or allegedly sold to drug dealers in communities active in the anti- apartheid movement (cf. Basson brownies). Most of the stockpile disappeared afterwards. Scientists working on the project later stated that they believed it was to be used to create drug-laced tear gas. In January 1992, FRELIMO troops conducted an operation near the South African border. During the course of the operation, they were allegedly exposed to what was thought to have been a chemical agent. Some of the soldiers died during the incident and others required hospitalisation. Investigation by the United Nations, United States and the United Kingdom identified it as BZ nerve agent. US and Britain began to pressure the South African government and in January 1993 Project Coast was wound down. Basson was officially retired and hired to dismantle the project, and allegedly profited when some of the South African front companies were privatised. Later government investigation found that there were large amounts of chemicals and agents missing. TRC investigation In 1993 the Office of Serious Economic Offences (OSEO) began to investigate Basson's business dealings in an unheard of seven-year forensic audit. In 1995 the South African government hired Basson to work for Transnet, a transportation and infrastructure company and possibly for other more secretive jobs. The US and UK governments suspected that during his visits to Libya between 1993‚Äì1995, Basson might have sold chemical and biological weapons secrets. In 1995, the government of Nelson Mandela rehired Basson as an army surgeon, allegedly due to US and UK pressure and possibly because the government wanted to keep an eye on him. In 1996, South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) began to investigate the SADF and determined that the army had probably used lethal toxins against ANC activists. Basson was connected to many of these attacks. In 1997, the CIA told the South African government that Basson intended to leave the country. When Basson was arrested in a sting operation in Pretoria in 1997, he had 1000 ecstasy tablets with him. At the time, he had hundreds of secret Project Coast documents in his car. TRC began to investigate Project Coast which led them to suspect that Basson had sold his secrets to governments of countries like Libya and Iraq. In 1997 they asked the help of the Netherlands Institute for Southern Africa (NIZA) whose investigation report was included in the Truth Commission Files. At the same time, the Office for Serious Economic Offences, the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) and the Gauteng Attorney-General's Special Investigation Team investigated Basson's affairs. Conflict of interest slowed down the Commission investigation but the TRC gained more information from OSEO. Basson appeared before the TRC on 31 July 1998 and gave evidence for 12 hours. While his lawyers constantly interrupted the questioning with legal technicalities, the Commission determined that Basson had been the primary decision maker in Project Coast and should be put on trial.Secrets and Lies: Wouter Basson and South Africa's Chemical and Biological Warfare Programme Gould & Marlene Burger, Struik Publishers, 2002 Trial Basson's trial began on 4 October 1999 in Pretoria. At the time, the South African media had dubbed him \\"Dr Death\\". Basson faced 67 charges, including drug possession, drug trafficking, fraud and embezzlement of a total of R36,000,000, 229 murders and conspiracy to murder and theft. Basson refused to seek amnesty from the Truth Commission. The prosecution presented 153 witnesses, but the case soon began to turn against them. On 11 October 1999 Judge Willie Hartzenberg dismissed six important charges, including four charges of murder and possible involvement in 200 deaths in Namibia, because he stated that the South African court could not prosecute crimes committed in other countries. Basson was also included in the Namibian amnesty of 1989. Hartzenberg then adjourned the trial for two weeks. After 18 months of trial, he reduced the number of charges to 46. Basson called only one witness ‚Äì himself. In July 2001 Basson began to present his own evidence, speaking for 40 days. He stated that he had learned about weapons of mass destruction from Saddam Hussein, that he had indeed had free rein in the project and that he had exchanged information with foreign governments. Technically, all that was legal. The defence argued that Basson should have immunity for anything that had happened in Namibia. On 22 April 2002 Judge Hartzenberg dismissed all the remaining charges against Basson and granted him amnesty. In his judgement, the judge called the state's case \\"fragmented and confusing\\", and that it was largely superficial, hoping to convince the court of Basson's guilt in a manner which fell far short of the standard \\"beyond reasonable doubt\\". Judge Hartzenberg further added that the state seemed to have decided what the truth was and had urged the court not to believe anything that contradicted the state's version of the truth.'Dr Death' walks free The trial had lasted 30 months. The state tried to appeal the judgement due to legal inaccuracies, but the Supreme Court of Appeal refused to order a retrial in 2003, a step reserved for appeals that had no chance of success. After his release, Basson continued to travel all over the world as a guest speaker, and has founded his own private medical practice. In June 2005, a group of Swiss investigators questioned him about illegal trade in weapons and nuclear material and asked the South African government to stop cooperating with him. Later that year the Constitutional Court, South Africa's highest court, overturned the judgement of the Supreme Court of Appeal. It ruled that crimes allegedly committed outside the country could be prosecuted in South Africa. Since then, the National Prosecuting Authority has not instituted proceedings against Basson for crimes against humanity. HPCSA ruling In 2006, the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) started its own process of investigating Basson's conduct. A charge sheet was drawn up and the inquiry began in November 2007.TRC evidence at Basson hearing: http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/trc-evidence-at-basson- hearing-1.1547820#.UeV3To2mh3p Out of the seven charges levelled against Basson, four full indictments remain after the HPCSA discharged two charges and part of a third charge against him. On 10 May 2010, the application by Wouter Basson to the South African High Court was rejected. The application to the High Court attempted to have the charges set aside as unlawful, unreasonable and unfair. The judge found that there was no evidence to suggest that the council was in any way biased or prejudiced against the doctor.HPCSA applauds High Court ruling on Basson May 2010 On 18 December 2013, the HPCSA found Basson guilty of unprofessional conduct on four charges.HPCSA finds Basson guilty of unprofessional conduct 18 December 2013 On 4 June 2014 sentencing procedure was postponed due to unavailability of counsel. On 27 March 2019, six years after Basson was found guilty of unethical conduct by an HPCSA committee, the Gauteng High Court ruled that there was bias on the part of the committee members that presided over the disciplinary hearing. The judge ruled that the proceedings (instituted by the HPCSA against Basson) were irregular and unfair and illustrated a total disregard for the rights of Basson. The hearing (and, therefore, the finding of unethical conduct by the committee) was accordingly set aside.

Since 2006, the medical school dean has been E. Albert Reece. History Chartered as the College of Medicine of Maryland in December 1807, the University of Maryland School of Medicine was the founding school of the University System of Maryland and the only public medical school in the U.S. at the time. It is the fifth oldest medical school in the country after the medicals schools at Columbia University (established May 1807), Dartmouth College (1798), Harvard University (1782), and the University of Pennsylvania (1765). Its founding by Nathaniel Potter and John Beale Davidge was part of an influx of professionals to Baltimore and the rapid urban development that immediately followed the American Revolution. By the late 1780s, there was public discussion about the need for \\"medical reform and suppression of quackery\\". A group of physicians made several short-lived attempts at starting medical schools around the turn of the 19th century, and were finally successful in 1807 when the Maryland state legislature passed the Medical College Bill, authorizing the formation the College of Medicine of Maryland. In 1812 it was rechartered as the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Davidge Hall, built in 1812 and still in use today, is the original building of the College of Medicine of Maryland. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the oldest building in continuous use for medical education in the United States. In the 1950s, the building was named after John Beale Davidge, one of the founders and the first dean of the College of Medicine of Maryland. Research Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have made several milestone discoveries in the field of biomedical research and therapeutics. Recent discoveries include the development of aromatase inhibitors for the treatment of breast cancer by the lab of Angela Brodie, and the discovery of calcium sparks as drivers of heart contraction by the lab of Jonathan Lederer. The School of Medicine is a research-focused academic institution, with $537 million in extramural research funding in 2018. A large portion of that research funding comes from the federal government of the United States. , over $148 million in research grants from the NIH were attributed to the parent university of the School of Medicine. Focus areas of the University of Maryland School of Medicine's research include cancer research, organ transplant research, cardiovascular research, neuroscience, and virology. The School of Medicine has extensive operations in research education. Together with the Graduate Program in Life Sciences, the school provides research teaching and oversees the award of Ph.D. degrees across multiple research tracks. The School of Medicine is one of only 50 medical institutions in the United States to offer a Medical Scientist Training Program. The School of Medicine has launched several research centers and institutes dedicated to specific fields of research: =The Institute of Human Virology= The Institute of Human Virology (IHV) was formed in 1996 as a research institute of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, headed and co-founded by Robert Gallo, the only recipient of two Lasker Awards for the discovery of the first human retrovirus, and the discovery of HIV as the cause of AIDS. IHV operates in a dedicated building on the UMSOM campus next to the University of Maryland Medical Center as a partnership between the State of Maryland, the City of Baltimore, the University System of Maryland and the University of Maryland Medical System. =The Institute for Genome Sciences= Launched in 2007, the Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) is an internationally recognized genomics research center at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. IGS investigators use genomic and bioinformatic tools to research genome function in health and diseases and work in interdisciplinary collaborations with biomedical investigators. IGS is led by Dr. Claire M. Fraser-Liggett. Research areas include: Bioinformatics, Cancer Genomics, Functional Genomics, Human Genetic Variation, Infectious Diseases, Organismal Diversity and Evolution, Human Microbiome Project, Plant Genomics, and Microbial Community Ecology. Investigators at IGS work on Disease Ontology research, the Data Analysis and Coordination Center (DACC) for HMP, and other grants. IGS is one of the Genome Sequencing Center for Infectious Diseases (GSCID) centers designated by NIAID. =The Institute for Global Health= The Institute for Global Health (IGH) was established in 2015 and is dedicated to improving global health by conducting innovative, world-leading research around the world. The IGH develops new and improved ways of diagnosing, preventing, treating, controlling and eradicating diseases of global impact. Such diseases include malaria, Ebola and vaccine-preventable infectious diseases such as measles. The IGH includes the Center for Vaccine Development (CVD) and the Division of Malaria Research. =Maryland Psychiatric Research Center= The MPRC was established on the grounds of Spring Grove Hospital as a result of public interest in the research pioneered there on the use of the psychedelic compound LSD in Schizophrenia research. The first of this series of experiments, which came to be known as the Spring Grove Experiment, began in 1955 in cottage 13 of the hospital grounds. The study was largely conducted by the members of the Research Unit of Spring Grove State Hospital, and became the largest study on psychedelic drugs in psychiatric research. After the study gained media publicity, research funding was made available and Spring Grove was rebuilt into the MPRC, a division of the department of Psychiatry of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Currently, MPRC hosts over 20 clinical and basic research faculty that form its core research program into psychiatric disease.

Both were French citizens interested in reconciliation between French and German citizens in the aftermath of World War II. Some of the first actions of Pax Christi were the organisation of peace pilgrimages and other actions fostering reconciliation between France and Germany. Although Pax Christi initially began as a movement for French-German reconciliation, it expanded its focus and spread to other European countries in the 1950s. It grew as ‚Äúa crusade of prayer for peace among all nations.‚ÄùPogorelc, Anthony J., Encyclopedia of American Religion and Politics, 2003, Pg. 317 Pax Christi was recognized as ‚Äúthe official international Catholic peace movement‚Äù by Pope Pius XII in 1952.Dennis, Marie, ‚ÄúPax Christi International‚Äù , CMSM Forum, Summer 2008 It also has chapters in the United States.

The historic location where the Pali Canon was written down completely in text on ola (palm) leaves in 29 BCE. Christ Church, Matale was consecrated by Bishop James Chapman on 30 December 1860. The church site chosen was Fort McDowall, commanding a view of the entrance to Matale via Trincomalee. The church having been erected and furnished, the Revd William Frederick Kelly, Minister and Chaplain in Matale, and 36 others sent their petition to the Rt Revd James Chapman, D.D., to dedicate and consecrate Christ Church. The parsonage was opened on 16 August 1862. The 75th Anniversary was celebrated in 1935. The centenary was celebrated on 28 and 29 January 1961. The 125th Anniversary was celebrated on 6 September 1986. The church was gutted by fire in 1985 and was completely restored. Services were held in the Baptist Church in the interim period. On 22 June 1911, there was a special service held in this church in connection with the Coronation of His Majesty King George V, and Queen Mary. The offertory on that was given to the King Edward VIII.Anti Tuberculosis Fund. (Ref. Ceylon Churchman Report for the year ending 20 June 1911) The church's 150th Anniversary was celebrated on 2 October 2010. Matale was the site of a major battle in 1848 when the Matale Rebellion started and the British garrison in the Fort MacDowall in Matale was placed under siege by the rebels led by Weera Puran Appu and Gongalegoda Banda. The city is also the birthplace of Monarawila Keppetipola, a rebel who led the Wellasa rebellion against the British troops.

Rasch Measurement Transactions, 19:3, 1032 that separate proponents of the Rasch model from the item response modeling tradition. A central aspect of this divide relates to the role of specific objectivity,Rasch, G. (1977). On Specific Objectivity: An attempt at formalizing the request for generality and validity of scientific statements. The Danish Yearbook of Philosophy, 14, 58-93. a defining property of the Rasch model according to Georg Rasch, as a requirement for successful measurement. Overview =The Rasch model for measurement= In the Rasch model, the probability of a specified response (e.g. right/wrong answer) is modeled as a function of person and item parameters. Specifically, in the original Rasch model, the probability of a correct response is modeled as a logistic function of the difference between the person and item parameter. The mathematical form of the model is provided later in this article. In most contexts, the parameters of the model characterize the proficiency of the respondents and the difficulty of the items as locations on a continuous latent variable. For example, in educational tests, item parameters represent the difficulty of items while person parameters represent the ability or attainment level of people who are assessed. The higher a person's ability relative to the difficulty of an item, the higher the probability of a correct response on that item. When a person's location on the latent trait is equal to the difficulty of the item, there is by definition a 0.5 probability of a correct response in the Rasch model. A Rasch model is a model in one sense in that it represents the structure which data should exhibit in order to obtain measurements from the data; i.e. it provides a criterion for successful measurement. Beyond data, Rasch's equations model relationships we expect to obtain in the real world. For instance, education is intended to prepare children for the entire range of challenges they will face in life, and not just those that appear in textbooks or on tests. By requiring measures to remain the same (invariant) across different tests measuring the same thing, Rasch models make it possible to test the hypothesis that the particular challenges posed in a curriculum and on a test coherently represent the infinite population of all possible challenges in that domain. A Rasch model is therefore a model in the sense of an ideal or standard that provides a heuristic fiction serving as a useful organizing principle even when it is never actually observed in practice. The perspective or paradigm underpinning the Rasch model is distinct from the perspective underpinning statistical modelling. Models are most often used with the intention of describing a set of data. Parameters are modified and accepted or rejected based on how well they fit the data. In contrast, when the Rasch model is employed, the objective is to obtain data which fit the model (Andrich, 2004; Wright, 1984, 1999). The rationale for this perspective is that the Rasch model embodies requirements which must be met in order to obtain measurement, in the sense that measurement is generally understood in the physical sciences. A useful analogy for understanding this rationale is to consider objects measured on a weighing scale. Suppose the weight of an object A is measured as being substantially greater than the weight of an object B on one occasion, then immediately afterward the weight of object B is measured as being substantially greater than the weight of object A. A property we require of measurements is that the resulting comparison between objects should be the same, or invariant, irrespective of other factors. This key requirement is embodied within the formal structure of the Rasch model. Consequently, the Rasch model is not altered to suit data. Instead, the method of assessment should be changed so that this requirement is met, in the same way that a weighing scale should be rectified if it gives different comparisons between objects upon separate measurements of the objects. Data analysed using the model are usually responses to conventional items on tests, such as educational tests with right/wrong answers. However, the model is a general one, and can be applied wherever discrete data are obtained with the intention of measuring a quantitative attribute or trait. =Scaling= Figure 1: Test characteristic curve showing the relationship between total score on a test and person location estimate When all test-takers have an opportunity to attempt all items on a single test, each total score on the test maps to a unique estimate of ability and the greater the total, the greater the ability estimate. Total scores do not have a linear relationship with ability estimates. Rather, the relationship is non-linear as shown in Figure 1. The total score is shown on the vertical axis, while the corresponding person location estimate is shown on the horizontal axis. For the particular test on which the test characteristic curve (TCC) shown in Figure 1 is based, the relationship is approximately linear throughout the range of total scores from about 13 to 31. The shape of the TCC is generally somewhat sigmoid as in this example. However, the precise relationship between total scores and person location estimates depends on the distribution of items on the test. The TCC is steeper in ranges on the continuum in which there are a number of items, such as in the range on either side of 0 in Figures 1 and 2. In applying the Rasch model, item locations are often scaled first, based on methods such as those described below. This part of the process of scaling is often referred to as item calibration. In educational tests, the smaller the proportion of correct responses, the higher the difficulty of an item and hence the higher the item's scale location. Once item locations are scaled, the person locations are measured on the scale. As a result, person and item locations are estimated on a single scale as shown in Figure 2. =Interpreting scale locations= Figure 2: Graph showing histograms of person distribution (top) and item distribution (bottom) on a scale For dichotomous data such as right/wrong answers, by definition, the location of an item on a scale corresponds with the person location at which there is a 0.5 probability of a correct response to the question. In general, the probability of a person responding correctly to a question with difficulty lower than that person's location is greater than 0.5, while the probability of responding correctly to a question with difficulty greater than the person's location is less than 0.5. The Item Characteristic Curve (ICC) or Item Response Function (IRF) shows the probability of a correct response as a function of the ability of persons. A single ICC is shown and explained in more detail in relation to Figure 4 in this article (see also the item response function). The leftmost ICCs in Figure 3 are the easiest items, the rightmost items in the same figure are the most difficult items. When responses of a person are listed according to item difficulty, from lowest to highest, the most likely pattern is a Guttman pattern or vector; i.e. {1,1,...,1,0,0,0,...,0}. However, while this pattern is the most probable given the structure of the Rasch model, the model requires only probabilistic Guttman response patterns; that is, patterns which tend toward the Guttman pattern. It is unusual for responses to conform strictly to the pattern because there are many possible patterns. It is unnecessary for responses to conform strictly to the pattern in order for data to fit the Rasch model. Figure 3: ICCs for a number of items. ICCs are coloured to highlight the change in the probability of a successful response for a person with ability location at the vertical line. The person is likely to respond correctly to the easiest items (with locations to the left and higher curves) and unlikely to respond correctly to difficult items (locations to the right and lower curves). Each ability estimate has an associated standard error of measurement, which quantifies the degree of uncertainty associated with the ability estimate. Item estimates also have standard errors. Generally, the standard errors of item estimates are considerably smaller than the standard errors of person estimates because there are usually more response data for an item than for a person. That is, the number of people attempting a given item is usually greater than the number of items attempted by a given person. Standard errors of person estimates are smaller where the slope of the ICC is steeper, which is generally through the middle range of scores on a test. Thus, there is greater precision in this range since the steeper the slope, the greater the distinction between any two points on the line. Statistical and graphical tests are used to evaluate the correspondence of data with the model. Certain tests are global, while others focus on specific items or people. Certain tests of fit provide information about which items can be used to increase the reliability of a test by omitting or correcting problems with poor items. In Rasch Measurement the person separation index is used instead of reliability indices. However, the person separation index is analogous to a reliability index. The separation index is a summary of the genuine separation as a ratio to separation including measurement error. As mentioned earlier, the level of measurement error is not uniform across the range of a test, but is generally larger for more extreme scores (low and high). Features of the Rasch model The class of models is named after Georg Rasch, a Danish mathematician and statistician who advanced the epistemological case for the models based on their congruence with a core requirement of measurement in physics; namely the requirement of invariant comparison. This is the defining feature of the class of models, as is elaborated upon in the following section. The Rasch model for dichotomous data has a close conceptual relationship to the law of comparative judgment (LCJ), a model formulated and used extensively by L. L. Thurstone,Thurstone, L. L. (1927). A law of comparative judgment. Psychological Review, 34(4), 273.Thurstone and sensory scaling: Then and now. (1994). Thurstone and sensory scaling: Then and now. Psychological Review, 101(2), 271‚Äì277. doi:10.1037/0033-295X.101.2.271 and therefore also to the Thurstone scale.Andrich, D. (1978b). Relationships between the Thurstone and Rasch approaches to item scaling. Applied Psychological Measurement, 2, 449‚Äì460. Prior to introducing the measurement model he is best known for, Rasch had applied the Poisson distribution to reading data as a measurement model, hypothesizing that in the relevant empirical context, the number of errors made by a given individual was governed by the ratio of the text difficulty to the person's reading ability. Rasch referred to this model as the multiplicative Poisson model. Rasch's model for dichotomous data ‚Äì i.e. where responses are classifiable into two categories ‚Äì is his most widely known and used model, and is the main focus here. This model has the form of a simple logistic function. The brief outline above highlights certain distinctive and interrelated features of Rasch's perspective on social measurement, which are as follows: # He was concerned principally with the measurement of individuals, rather than with distributions among populations. # He was concerned with establishing a basis for meeting a priori requirements for measurement deduced from physics and, consequently, did not invoke any assumptions about the distribution of levels of a trait in a population. # Rasch's approach explicitly recognizes that it is a scientific hypothesis that a given trait is both quantitative and measurable, as operationalized in a particular experimental context. Thus, congruent with the perspective articulated by Thomas Kuhn in his 1961 paper The function of measurement in modern physical science, measurement was regarded both as being founded in theory, and as being instrumental to detecting quantitative anomalies incongruent with hypotheses related to a broader theoretical framework.Kuhn, Thomas S. \\"The function of measurement in modern physical science.\\" Isis (1961): 161-193. This perspective is in contrast to that generally prevailing in the social sciences, in which data such as test scores are directly treated as measurements without requiring a theoretical foundation for measurement. Although this contrast exists, Rasch's perspective is actually complementary to the use of statistical analysis or modelling that requires interval-level measurements, because the purpose of applying a Rasch model is to obtain such measurements. Applications of Rasch models are described in a wide variety of sources, including Alagumalai, Curtis & Hungi (2005), Bezruczko (2005), Bond & Fox (2007), Burro (2016), Fisher & Wright (1994), Masters & Keeves (1999), and the Journal of Applied Measurement. =Invariant comparison and sufficiency= The Rasch model for dichotomous data is often regarded as an item response theory (IRT) model with one item parameter. However, rather than being a particular IRT model, proponents of the model*Bond, T.G. & Fox, C.M. (2007). Applying the Rasch Model: Fundamental measurement in the human sciences. 2nd Edn (includes Rasch software on CD-ROM). Lawrence Erlbaum. Page 265 regard it as a model that possesses a property which distinguishes it from other IRT models. Specifically, the defining property of Rasch models is their formal or mathematical embodiment of the principle of invariant comparison. Rasch summarised the principle of invariant comparison as follows: :The comparison between two stimuli should be independent of which particular individuals were instrumental for the comparison; and it should also be independent of which other stimuli within the considered class were or might also have been compared. :Symmetrically, a comparison between two individuals should be independent of which particular stimuli within the class considered were instrumental for the comparison; and it should also be independent of which other individuals were also compared, on the same or some other occasion.Rasch, G. (1961). On general laws and the meaning of measurement in psychology, pp. 321‚Äì334 in Proceedings of the Fourth Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability, IV. Berkeley, California: University of California Press. Available free from Project Euclid Rasch models embody this principle because their formal structure permits algebraic separation of the person and item parameters, in the sense that the person parameter can be eliminated during the process of statistical estimation of item parameters. This result is achieved through the use of conditional maximum likelihood estimation, in which the response space is partitioned according to person total scores. The consequence is that the raw score for an item or person is the sufficient statistic for the item or person parameter. That is to say, the person total score contains all information available within the specified context about the individual, and the item total score contains all information with respect to item, with regard to the relevant latent trait. The Rasch model requires a specific structure in the response data, namely a probabilistic Guttman structure. In somewhat more familiar terms, Rasch models provide a basis and justification for obtaining person locations on a continuum from total scores on assessments. Although it is not uncommon to treat total scores directly as measurements, they are actually counts of discrete observations rather than measurements. Each observation represents the observable outcome of a comparison between a person and item. Such outcomes are directly analogous to the observation of the rotation of a balance scale in one direction or another. This observation would indicate that one or other object has a greater mass, but counts of such observations cannot be treated directly as measurements. Rasch pointed out that the principle of invariant comparison is characteristic of measurement in physics using, by way of example, a two-way experimental frame of reference in which each instrument exerts a mechanical force upon solid bodies to produce acceleration. Rasch stated of this context: \\"Generally: If for any two objects we find a certain ratio of their accelerations produced by one instrument, then the same ratio will be found for any other of the instruments\\". It is readily shown that Newton's second law entails that such ratios are inversely proportional to the ratios of the masses of the bodies. The mathematical form of the Rasch model for dichotomous data Let X_{ni} = x \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} be a dichotomous random variable where, for example, x = 1 denotes a correct response and x = 0 an incorrect response to a given assessment item. In the Rasch model for dichotomous data, the probability of the outcome X_{ni} = 1 is given by: : \\\\Pr \\\\\\\\{X_{ni}=1\\\\\\\\} =\\\\frac{e^{{\\\\beta_n} - {\\\\delta_i}}}{1 + e^{{\\\\beta_n} - {\\\\delta_i}}}, where \\\\beta_n is the ability of person n and \\\\delta_i is the difficulty of item i . Thus, in the case of a dichotomous attainment item, \\\\Pr \\\\\\\\{X_{ni}=1\\\\\\\\} is the probability of success upon interaction between the relevant person and assessment item. It is readily shown that the log odds, or logit, of correct response by a person to an item, based on the model, is equal to \\\\beta_n - \\\\delta_i. Given two examinees with different ability parameters \\\\beta_1 and \\\\beta_2 and an arbitrary item with difficulty \\\\delta_i , compute the difference in logits for these two examinees by (\\\\beta_1 - \\\\delta_i)-(\\\\beta_2 - \\\\delta_i). This difference becomes \\\\beta_1 - \\\\beta_2 . Conversely, it can be shown that the log odds of a correct response by the same person to one item, conditional on a correct response to one of two items, is equal to the difference between the item locations. For example, : \\\\operatorname{log-odds} \\\\\\\\{X_{n1}=1 \\\\mid \\\\ r_n=1\\\\\\\\} = \\\\delta_2-\\\\delta_1,\\\\, where r_n is the total score of person n over the two items, which implies a correct response to one or other of the items.Andersen, E.B. (1977). Sufficient statistics and latent trait models, Psychometrika, 42, 69‚Äì81.Andrich, D. (2010). Sufficiency and conditional estimation of person parameters in the polytomous Rasch model. Psychometrika, 75(2), 292-308. Hence, the conditional log odds does not involve the person parameter \\\\beta_n, which can therefore be eliminated by conditioning on the total score r_n=1. That is, by partitioning the responses according to raw scores and calculating the log odds of a correct response, an estimate \\\\delta_2-\\\\delta_1 is obtained without involvement of \\\\beta_n. More generally, a number of item parameters can be estimated iteratively through application of a process such as Conditional Maximum Likelihood estimation (see Rasch model estimation). While more involved, the same fundamental principle applies in such estimations. Figure 4: ICC for the Rasch model showing the comparison between observed and expected proportions correct for five Class Intervals of persons The ICC of the Rasch model for dichotomous data is shown in Figure 4. The grey line maps the probability of the discrete outcome X_{ni}=1 (that is, correctly answering the question) for persons with different locations on the latent continuum (that is, their level of abilities). The location of an item is, by definition, that location at which the probability that X_{ni}=1 is equal to 0.5. In figure 4, the black circles represent the actual or observed proportions of persons within Class Intervals for which the outcome was observed. For example, in the case of an assessment item used in the context of educational psychology, these could represent the proportions of persons who answered the item correctly. Persons are ordered by the estimates of their locations on the latent continuum and classified into Class Intervals on this basis in order to graphically inspect the accordance of observations with the model. There is a close conformity of the data with the model. In addition to graphical inspection of data, a range of statistical tests of fit are used to evaluate whether departures of observations from the model can be attributed to random effects alone, as required, or whether there are systematic departures from the model. Polytomous extensions of the Rasch model There are multiple polytomous extensions to the Rasch model, which generalize the dichotomous model so that it can be applied in contexts in which successive integer scores represent categories of increasing level or magnitude of a latent trait, such as increasing ability, motor function, endorsement of a statement, and so forth. These polytomous extensions are, for example, applicable to the use of Likert scales, grading in educational assessment, and scoring of performances by judges. Other considerations A criticism of the Rasch model is that it is overly restrictive or prescriptive because an assumption of the model is that all items have equal discrimination, whereas in practice, items discriminations vary, and thus no dataset will ever show perfect data-model fit. A frequent misunderstanding is that the Rasch model does not permit each item to have a different discrimination, but equal discrimination is an assumption of invariant measurement, so differing item discriminations are not forbidden, but rather indicate that measurement quality does not equal a theoretical ideal. Just as in physical measurement, real world datasets will never perfectly match theoretical models, so the relevant question is whether a particular dataset provides sufficient quality of measurement for the purpose at hand, not whether it perfectly matches an unattainable standard of perfection. A criticism specific to the use of the Rasch model with response data from multiple choice items is that there is no provision in the model for guessing because the left asymptote always approaches a zero probability in the Rasch model. This implies that a person of low ability will always get an item wrong. However, low-ability individuals completing a multiple-choice exam have a substantially higher probability of choosing the correct answer by chance alone (for a k-option item, the likelihood is around 1/k). The three-parameter logistic model relaxes both these assumptions and the two-parameter logistic model allows varying slopes.Birnbaum, A. (1968). Some latent trait models and their use in inferring an examinee‚Äôs ability. In Lord, F.M. & Novick, M.R. (Eds.), Statistical theories of mental test scores. Reading, MA: Addison‚ÄìWesley. However, the specification of uniform discrimination and zero left asymptote are necessary properties of the model in order to sustain sufficiency of the simple, unweighted raw score. In practice, the non-zero lower asymptote found in multiple-choice datasets is less of a threat to measurement than commonly assumed and typically does not result in substantive errors in measurement when well-developed test items are used sensibly Verhelst & Glas (1995) derive Conditional Maximum Likelihood (CML) equations for a model they refer to as the One Parameter Logistic Model (OPLM). In algebraic form it appears to be identical with the 2PL model, but OPLM contains preset discrimination indexes rather than 2PL's estimated discrimination parameters. As noted by these authors, though, the problem one faces in estimation with estimated discrimination parameters is that the discriminations are unknown, meaning that the weighted raw score \\"is not a mere statistic, and hence it is impossible to use CML as an estimation method\\" (Verhelst & Glas, 1995, p. 217). That is, sufficiency of the weighted \\"score\\" in the 2PL cannot be used according to the way in which a sufficient statistic is defined. If the weights are imputed instead of being estimated, as in OPLM, conditional estimation is possible and some of the properties of the Rasch model are retained (Verhelst, Glas & Verstralen, 1995; Verhelst & Glas, 1995). In OPLM, the values of the discrimination index are restricted to between 1 and 15. A limitation of this approach is that in practice, values of discrimination indexes must be preset as a starting point. This means some type of estimation of discrimination is involved when the purpose is to avoid doing so. The Rasch model for dichotomous data inherently entails a single discrimination parameter which, as noted by Rasch, constitutes an arbitrary choice of the unit in terms of which magnitudes of the latent trait are expressed or estimated. However, the Rasch model requires that the discrimination is uniform across interactions between persons and items within a specified frame of reference (i.e. the assessment context given conditions for assessment). Application of the model provides diagnostic information regarding how well the criterion is met. Application of the model can also provide information about how well items or questions on assessments work to measure the ability or trait. For instance, knowing the proportion of persons that engage in a given behavior, the Rasch model can be used to derive the relations between difficulty of behaviors, attitudes and behaviors. Prominent advocates of Rasch models include Benjamin Drake Wright, David Andrich and Erling Andersen. See also *Mokken scale *Guttman scale Further reading *Alagumalai, S., Curtis, D.D. & Hungi, N.

During the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the village was razed by Nazi forces as reprisal for Reich Protector Reinhard Heydrich's assassination in late spring 1942. History Le≈æ√°ky was inhabited by poor stonecutters and cottagers living in eight houses near the mill. The village was named after the Le≈æ√°k rivulet. Beginning 24 September 1941, SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer and General of Police Reinhard Heydrich was Acting Reichsprotektor for the Nazi Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.Kaplan and Nosarzewska, Prague: The Turbulent Century p. 214 The area had been occupied by Nazi Germany since 5 April 1939. In December 1941, several Allied paratroopers were dropped into the region. Some were sent to assassinate Reinhard Heydrich in an action known as Operation Anthropoid. Another group was part of Operation Silver A. Several Le≈æ√°ky residents helped the latter group by providing a hiding place for their radio set. On the morning of 27 May 1942, Heydrich's car was attacked by Jozef Gabƒç√≠k and Jan Kubi≈°, Czech and Slovak soldiers acting for the Czechoslovak government-in- exile.Kaplan and Nosarzewska, Prague: The Turbulent Century p. 241 Heydrich died on 4 June 1942. =Massacre= After the assassination, the Nazis imposed martial law. On 10 June, the village of Lidice was razed and all male inhabitants aged over 15 were shot. Lidice was selected because its residents were falsely accused of harbouring local resistance partisans and aiding Operation Anthropoid team members. Thereafter, Gestapo agents found a radio transmitter in Le≈æ√°ky which belonged to Operation Silver A. Alfr√©d Barto≈°, the leader of resistance group Silver A, killed himself shortly thereafter. On 24 June, approximately 500 SS troops and policemen surrounded Le≈æ√°ky, removed all inhabitants, and the village was destroyed. All 33 adults (both men and women) were shot. Thirteen children were spared. A 26 June press release announced the outcome. In mid-December 1943, the Le≈æ√°ky ruins were removed by 65 men from Nazi work camps. Of the thirteen children, sisters Jarmila and Marie ≈†≈•ul√≠k were selected for \\"Germanization\\"; both were located and returned to their families after the war.

The title Lacnunga, an Old English word meaning 'remedies', is not in the manuscript: it was given to the collection by its first editor, Oswald Cockayne, in the nineteenth century.Alaric Hall, Elves in Anglo-Saxon England: Matters of Belief, Health, Gender, and Identity, Anglo-Saxon Studies, 8 (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2007), p. 1. It is found, following other medical texts, in London, British Library Harley MS 585, a codex probably compiled in England in the late tenth or early eleventh century. Many of its herbal remedies are also found, in variant form, in Bald's Leechbook, another Anglo-Saxon medical compendium. The Lacnunga contains many unique texts, including numerous charms, some of which provide rare glimpses into Anglo-Saxon popular religion and healing practices. Among the charms are several incantations in Old English alliterative verse, the most famous being those known as For Delayed Birth, the Nine Herbs Charm and Wi√∞ f√¶rstice ('Against a sudden, stabbing pain'). There are also several charms in corrupt Old Irish. Among the Latin prayers, the longest is a redaction of the Lorica of Laidcenn (formerly often known as the Lorica of Gildas). This seventh-century Irish poem, also preserved in other manuscripts, is a member of the lorica genre of protective prayers. This instance takes the form of an extended litany of body parts for which the speaker seeks the protection of Christ and a multitude of angels from the assaults of demons. It is accompanied in this manuscript by an interlinear gloss in Old English, which probably derives from an exemplar in the Mercian dialect.  Editions, translations and facsimiles  *Cockayne, O.

Chung was born on 20 January 1925, in Longtan District, Taoyuan. Under Japanese rule, the subdivision was classified as a village by the name of Ry≈´tan, itself a part of Daikei, in Shinchiku Prefecture. His father was a schoolteacher and principal. Chung was sixth of ten siblings, and the only son. He enrolled successively at the and then the Changhua Normal School, and later studied at National Taiwan University, but did not complete a degree in the Department of Chinese Language and Literature, due to a bout of malaria. He learned to speak Taiwanese Hokkien at an early age, and was educated in the Japanese language. Chung taught at Longtan Elementary School until 1979, switching from Hakka to teaching in Mandarin at the request of the Kuomintang- led government. His knowledge of languages made Chung a member of the translingual generation. His first work was published in 1951, within the pages of the magazine Rambler. His first novel appeared as a serial within United Daily News, and over the course of his career, Chung published over thirty novels. His literary output also includes many essays, over 150 short stories, and more than forty works translated from Japanese. Record of publication held at the Institute of Taiwan History Together with his contemporary Yeh Shih-tao, the pair is known as \\"North Chung South Yeh.\\" He promoted Taiwan nativist literature. Known as the doyen of Taiwanese literature, Chung's novel The Dull Ice Flower was adapted into a Golden Horse- winning film released in 1989. He was a recipient of both the and the , among others. Chung fell the week before his death, and subsequently lapsed in and out of consciousness. He died on 16 May 2020 at home in Taoyuan. Chung received the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon in 2000 from the Lee Teng-hui presidential administration. Lee's successor Chen Shui-bian awarded Chung the Order of Propitious Clouds with Grand Cordon in 2004. Posthumously, the Order of Brilliant Star with Special Grand Cordon was conferred upon Chung, alongside a presidential citation from Tsai Ing-wen.

Rose ottos are extracted through steam distillation, while rose absolutes are obtained through solvent extraction, the absolute being used more commonly in perfumery. Even with their high price and the advent of organic synthesis, rose oils are still perhaps the most widely used essential oil in perfumery. Components Two major species of rose are cultivated for the production of rose oil: * Rosa damascena, the damask rose, which is widely grown in Bulgaria, Syria, Turkey, Russia, Pakistan, India, Uzbekistan, Iran and China * Rosa centifolia, the cabbage rose, which is more commonly grown in Morocco, France and Egypt. The most common chemical compounds present in rose oil are: citronellol, geraniol, nerol, linalool, phenyl ethyl alcohol, farnesol, stearoptene, Œ±-pinene, Œ≤-pinene, Œ±-terpinene, limonene, p-cymene, camphene, Œ≤-caryophyllene, neral, citronellyl acetate, geranyl acetate, neryl acetate, eugenol, methyl eugenol, rose oxide, Œ±-damascenone, Œ≤-damascenone, benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, rhodinyl acetate and phenyl ethyl formate. The key flavor compounds that contribute to the distinctive scent of rose oil, however, are beta- damascenone, beta-damascone, beta-ionone, and rose oxide. Beta-damascenone's presence and quantity is considered as the marker for the quality of rose oil. Even though these compounds exist in less than 1% quantity of rose oil, they make up for slightly more than 90% of the odor content due to their low odor detection thresholds. The price per sample container varies anywhere from USD$1,740 - USD$2,550  Production  Rose oil factory in Bulgaria Rose Valley near the town of Kazanlak in Bulgaria, 1870s, engraving by Austro- Hungarian traveller Felix Philipp Kanitz Due to the labor-intensive production process and the low content of oil in the rose blooms, rose oil commands a very high price. Harvesting of flowers is done by hand in the morning before sunrise and material is distilled the same day. There are three main methods of extracting the oil from the plant material: * Steam distillation, which produces an essential oil called rose otto or attar of roses. * Solvent extraction, which results in an absolute called rose absolute. * Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction, yielding a concrete that may be marketed as a concrete, absolute or CO2 extract. =Distillation= In the first part of the two-stage process of distillation, large stills - traditionally of copper - are filled with roses and water. The still is fired for 60‚Äì105 minutes. The vaporized water and rose oil exit the still and enter a condensing apparatus and are then collected in a flask. This distillation yields a very concentrated oil, direct oil, which makes up about 20% of the final product of the whole process. The water which condenses along with the oil is drained off and redistilled, cohobation, in order to obtain the water- soluble fractions of the rose oil such as phenethyl alcohol which are a vital component of the aroma and which make up the large bulk, 80%, of the oil. The two oils are combined and make the final rose attar. Rose attar is mobile in room temperature and is usually clear, light yellow in color. It will form white crystals at normal room temperature which disappear when the oil is gently warmed. It will tend to become more viscous at lower temperatures due to this crystallization of some of its components. The essence has a very strong odor, but is pleasant when diluted and used for perfume. Attar of roses was once made in India, Persia, Syria, and the Ottoman Empire. The Rose Valley in Bulgaria, near the town of Kazanlak, is among the major producers of attar of roses in the world. In India, Kannauj is an important city of fabrication of rose attar, Kannauj is nicknamed \\"The Grasse of the East\\" or \\"The Grasse of the Orient\\". Grasse (in France) is an important city of fabrication of rose fragance. Due to the heat required for distillation, some of the compounds extracted from the rose denature or break down chemically. As such, rose attar does not smell very similar to \\"fresh\\" roses. The hydrosol portion of the distillate is known as rosewater. This inexpensive by-product is used widely as a food flavoring as well as in skin care. =Solvent extraction= In the solvent extraction method, the flowers are agitated in a vat with a solvent such as hexane, which draws out the aroma compounds as well as other soluble substances such as wax and pigments. The extract is subjected to vacuum processing which removes the solvent for re-use. The remaining waxy mass is known as a concrete. The concrete is then mixed with alcohol which dissolves the aromatic constituents, leaving behind the wax and other substances. The alcohol is low-pressure evaporated, leaving behind the finished absolute. The absolute may be further processed to remove any impurities that are still present from the solvent extraction. Rose absolute is a deep reddish brown with no crystals. Due to the low temperatures in this process, the absolute may be more faithful to the scent of the fresh rose than the otto. =Carbon dioxide extraction= A third process, supercritical carbon dioxide extraction, combines the best aspects of the other two methods. When carbon dioxide is put under at least of pressure and at a temperature of at least (the critical point), it becomes a supercritical fluid with the permeation properties of a gas and the solvation properties of a liquid. (Under normal pressure CO2 changes directly from a solid to a gas in a process known as sublimation.) The supercritical fluid CO2 extracts the aromatics from the plant material. Like solvent extraction, the CO2 extraction takes place at a low temperature, extracts a wide range of compounds rendering an essence more faithful to the original, and leaves the aromatics unaltered by heat. Because CO2 is gas at normal atmospheric pressure, it leaves no trace of itself in the final product. The equipment for CO2 extraction is expensive, which is reflected in the price of the essential oils obtained from the process. Adulteration It takes a large amount of rose petals to distill a small amount of essential oil. Depending on extraction method and plant species, the typical yield can be approximately 1:3,000. To mitigate the cost, some dishonest dealers will dilute rose oil with geranium (Pelargonium graveolens) or palmarosa (Cymbopogon martinii) essential oils, both of which are rich in geraniol, the main constituent of rose oil. Some of these \\"rose oils\\" are up to 90% geranium or palmarosa to 10% rose. This is referred to as extending the rose fragrance. This may be done to compensate for chemotype, e.g. Bulgarian distilled rose oil is naturally low in phenylethanol, and Ukrainian or Russian rose oil is naturally high in phenylethanol. Pure rose oil should not be used directly on the skin, as it can cause allergic reactions such as red skin and spots.  Bulgarian Rose Oil  Bulgarian rose oil is generally characterized by the following qualities: It differs in the quantitative content of its ingredients. About 283 components have been identified in the composition of Bulgarian rose oil. They are divided into two groups of substances: * odor carriers - represent the liquid part of the oil-eleoptene; * odor fixatives - hard at room temperature and odorless, but fix the odor and give it durability-stearoptene. Of the many components of eleoptene with a pink odor are citronellol, geraniol, nerol, phenylethyl alcohol, but the typical pink odor is also formed by the presence of microcomponents. * contains: Ethanol (up to 3%), Linalool (1 to 3%), Phenethyl alcohol(up to 3%), Citronellol (24 to 35%), Nerol (5 to 12%), Geraniol (13 to 22%) %), Geranyl acetate(up to 1.5%), Eugenol (up to 2.5%), Methyl eugenol (up to 2%) and Farnesol (at least 1.4%); hydrocarbons - C17 heptadecane (from 1 to 2.5%), C19 saturated hydrocarbon nonadecane CH3 (CH2) 17CH3 (from 8 to 15%), C19 unsaturated hydrocarbon with one or more double carbon bonds nonadecene CH3 (CH2) 16CH = CH2 from 2 to 5%), C21 heneicosan (from 3 to 5.5%) and C23 tricosan (from 0.5 to 1.5%) It has a light yellow color with a greenish tinge; It resembles almond oil in consistency; It has a strong aroma and sharp balsamic taste; It has an excellent combination of liquid and solid components.

Club career Born in Reykjav√≠k, Gu√∞ni started life in football with his local club Valur but soon harboured ambitions to play overseas. In 1985, he had a trial with English team Aston Villa but they did not follow up their initial interest. =Tottenham Hotspur= In December 1988, he was to return to England with Tottenham Hotspur, as then manager Terry Venables paid a fee of around ¬£100,000 to Valur, a fee which was then a record sale for the Icelandic club who have since gone on to produce many other top Icelandic exports. At Spurs, the central defender or full back teamed up with England internationals Paul Gascoigne, Gary Mabbutt, Gary Lineker and Chris Waddle. Understandably, he found it hard to make a regular breakthrough for the London club often filling in intermittently due to injuries or suspension. This did not stop him from becoming a regular for the Icelandic national team, where he eventually became captain winning in excess of 80 caps, which was a record for that country at the time. He had his most successful spell at Spurs under the management of Venables, but he missed out on the FA Cup triumph of 1991. The appointment of Ossie Ardiles as the Tottenham manager effectively spelt the beginning of the end for Gu√∞ni, who feared a life away from football at one stage. =Bolton Wanderers= In 1995, after being told he could leave Spurs, Gu√∞ni began studying to become a lawyer. A trial game for Crystal Palace reserves alerted the then Bolton Wanderers manager Bruce Rioch to Gu√∞ni's availability. Rioch could not understand why such a seasoned international was struggling to find a new club. A fee of ¬£65,000 was agreed between Bolton and Tottenham, rising to ¬£110,000 dependent on a certain number of clauses. Gu√∞ni made his Bolton debut in the most extreme surroundings of Wembley Stadium when coming on as a substitute for Scott Green in the 1995 Football League Cup Final defeat to Liverpool. England winger Steve McManaman had given Green a torrid time throughout the afternoon but Gu√∞ni's introduction gave Bolton renewed hope, as his first touch was to supply the cross for Alan Thompson to score. This was to be the start of a lifelong affection between Bolton Wanderers and Gu√∞ni. On the eve of the 1995‚Äì96 season, he was promoted back to the Premiership with Bolton where he proved to be a cool and assured performer in an otherwise shaky Wandererer's defence. He scored a number of vital goals against Newcastle United, Leeds United and most notably on his return to White Hart Lane as Bolton drew 2‚Äì2 with Tottenham Hotspur. Unfortunately, that season ended in relegation for Bolton, but Gu√∞ni was eager to help the club bounce back at the first attempt. In 1996‚Äì97, the club finished the season as champions of the old Division One (now Championship), with Gu√∞ni chipping in with three vital league goals, two of which came in the 7‚Äì0 defeat of relegation-haunted Swindon Town. During the 1997‚Äì98 season, the team relegated again, but this time the club showed much more of a fight than in their previous stint in the top league, only losing out to Everton on goal- difference on the final day. Bolton's loss at Chelsea coupled with Everton's draw against Coventry City meant that Gu√∞ni and Bolton were back in Division One. That season, Gu√∞ni scored one of the goals of the season; on 26 December 1997, Bolton played a home match against fellow strugglers Barnsley with both needing vital league points to climb away from trouble. Gu√∞ni equalised for the Trotters shortly before half time with a 35-yard shot from right-back which sailed into the top corner past the goalkeeper David Watson. The next season saw Gu√∞ni suffer a series of niggling injury problems and was one of his most frustrating seasons at Bolton. Players such as Mark Fish, Andy Todd, Jon Newsome and Paul Warhurst had all played in the heart of the defence in his absence, rumours even circulated that he may leave but this was soon dispelled. The following 1999‚Äì2000 season saw Bolton and Gu√∞ni reach three domestic Semi-Final competitions, losing all of them. First, the club lost out to Tranmere Rovers in a two-legged League Cup semi-final, then were defeated by Premiership side Aston Villa on penalties in a hard-fought encounter at Wembley in a game which Gu√∞ni picked up a hamstring injury. Finally they faced Ipswich Town in the Divisional Play-Offs in May 2000. Both sides had drawn 2‚Äì2 in the first leg at the Reebok Stadium, this making for an excellent second leg in the return at Portman Road. The game was marred by 12 Bolton bookings, the sending off of Robbie Elliott and Mike Whitlow and three debatable Ipswich penalties. Bolton criticised the highly controversial performance of referee Barry Knight claiming that the Orpington official had given Ipswich an unfair advantage. Ipswich later won the game 5‚Äì3 after extra-time and it looked as if Gu√∞ni would be retiring from football at the age of 35. However, new Wanderers manager Sam Allardyce persuaded the ever reliable Gu√∞ni to sign up for another year and he did not disappoint as he scored 10 goals from defence, putting in a string of excellent performances alongside the likes of Whitlow and Colin Hendry, as Bolton ultimately returned to the Premiership following a 3‚Äì0 play off win over Preston North End at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. With rumours again circulating of Gu√∞ni's imminent retirement Allardyce talked him into staying for one last season. This proved to be a rocky season for Bolton, only staying up on the last day with a 2‚Äì1 victory against Middlesbrough at the Reebok Stadium. Gu√∞ni almost scored against former club Tottenham in a game in March 2003 but his header rebounded back off the post. =Retirement= Despite Allardyce's efforts to make him stay another season, Gu√∞ni retired. In all he made 270 league appearances for the Trotters scoring 22 goals before finally taking up a career in law. He has, however, maintained his links with the club and is now the President of the former-players association as well acting as a part-time scout of budding Icelandic players. In 2008, he was a major influence in persuading AZ Alkmaar defender Gr√©tar Steinsson to join Bolton. Post-football Gu√∞ni is now a certified lawyer in Iceland. Gu√∞ni had a TV-Show back in 2004 called \\"Boltinn me√∞ Gu√∞na Bergs\\" that was a hit in Iceland. He returned to play for Bolton Wanderers one more time on 8 August 2009 for a Bolton Wanderers legends football match. On 6 March 2012, whilst going to aid a colleague who had been attacked by a man with a knife, Gu√∞ni was stabbed twice in the leg at the Reykjavik offices of the law firm Legal Support. He was later released from hospital, however his colleague remained in a critical condition. On 26 June 2012, the attacker was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Gudni received 800.000 ISK in compensation. On 11 February 2017, Gu√∞ni was elected chairman of the Icelandic Football Association. International career Gu√∞ni made his debut for Iceland in 1984 and went on to earn 80 caps, scoring 1 goal.Iceland - Record International Players - RSSSF His last international came in June 2003 against Lithuania. He is number four in Iceland's all-time international appearances list, behind record-holder R√∫nar Kristinsson, Hermann Hrei√∞arsson and Ei√∞ur Gu√∞johnsen.

Along with Jane Addams, Marian Cripps and Margaret E. Dungan were also founding members. The English Maude Royden remained vice president of the international WILPF. As of 1920 the US section of WILPF was headquartered in New York City. Marian Cripps, Baroness Parmoor, who later served as president of its British branch. Furthermore, the Women‚Äôs International League for Peace and Freedom is opposed to wars and international conflicts. The major movements of the league have been: open letter to UN secretary general to formally end the Korean War, a statement on weapons and an international day for the total elimination of nuclear weapons, gender-based violence and women human rights defenders. =Woman's Peace Party (USA)= A forerunner to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the Woman's Peace Party (WPP) was formed in January, 1915 in Washington, D.C. at a meeting called by Jane Addams and Carrie Chapman Catt. The approximately 3,000 women attendees approved a platform calling for the extension of suffrage to women and for a conference of neutral countries to offer continuous mediation as a way of ending war. WPP sent representatives to a subsequent International Women's Congress for Peace and Freedom, held in The Hague from April 28‚Äì30, 1915. =International Congress of Women, The Hague, 1915= The 1915 International Congress of Women was organized by the German feminist Anita Augspurg, Germany's first female jurist, and Lida Gustava Heymann (1868‚Äì1943) at the invitation of the Dutch pacifist, feminist and suffragist Aletta Jacobs to protest the war then raging in Europe, and to suggest ways to prevent war in the future. The Congress opened on April 28, wound up on May 1, and was attended by 1,136 participants from both neutral and belligerent nations, adopted much of the platform of WPP and established an International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace (ICWPP) with Jane Addams as president. WPP soon became the US Section of ICWPP. =Second International Women's Congress for Peace and Freedom, Z√ºrich, 1919= Jane Addams met with President Woodrow Wilson and is said to have worked out some common ground on peace. However, at their second international congress, held in Z√ºrich in 1919, ICWPP denounced the final terms of the peace treaty ending World War I as a scheme of revenge of the victors over the vanquished that would sow the seeds of another world war. They decided to make their committee permanent and renamed it the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. WILPF moved its headquarters to Geneva to be near the proposed site of the League of Nations, although WILPF did not endorse empowering that organization to conduct food blockades or to use military pressure to enforce its resolutions. The League called for international disarmament and an end to economic imperialism. The US branch of WILPF grew in recognition and membership during the post-WWI era, despite some attacks on the organisation as \\"unpatriotic\\" during the First Red Scare. The WILPF supported treaties such as the Washington Naval Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, regarding them as stepping stones to a peaceful world order. During the 1930s, Vera Brittain was the WILPF's Vice-President. Prior to the outbreak of World War Two, the League also supported measures to provide relief for Europe's Jewish community. Although WIPLF membership is restricted to women, several male peace activists have contributed to WIPLF meetings and publications, including Bart de Ligt (Speech originally given at WIPLF conference in Frankfurt-am-Main). and J. D. Bernal. Two WILPF leaders have received the Nobel Peace Prize for their peace efforts and international outlook and work with WILPF: Jane Addams, in 1931 and Emily Greene Balch in 1946. =WILPF and the United Nations= WILPF has had Consultative Status (category B) with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) since 1948 and has Special Consultative Relations with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), as well as special relations with the International Labour Organization (ILO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other organizations and agencies. WILPF has advocates and lobbies for the democratization of the UN, the Security Council and all other UN organizations and agencies; monitors Security Council and General Assembly activities in order to promote reforms; opposes the privatisation and corporatisation of the UN, especially the global compact with corporations; and advocates for the abolition of the Security Council veto.

They were most famous for their work on television, most notably Fist of Fun and This Morning with Richard Not Judy but had been working together on stage and on radio since the late 1980s. As with many double acts, Lee and Herring performed as contrasting personalities: one mature and duplicitous (Lee) and the other puerile and cheeky (Herring). As with several other double acts, Lee and Herring had a certain irony to their style and constantly checked themselves and made reference to this. The characters of Lee and Herring were parodies and exaggerations of their real life selves. History Lee and Herring first met at a party while they were studying at Oxford University. Lee had been performing stand-up on the circuit for a short while and had heard that Herring had been trying to as well, so he introduced himself. Lee once remarked that one of the reasons they decided to work as a double act was that they found the resemblance of the title \\"Lee and Herring\\" to Worcestershire sauce brand Lea & Perrins humorous. At Oxford, Lee and Herring performed in a regular comedy revue called The Seven Raymonds, which also included the material and performance of Emma Kennedy, Michael Cosgrave and Tim Richardson. Together they wrote material for Chris Morris' On The Hour (1991). However, a management conflict meant that the duo were not involved in the television version, The Day Today, and that their material was edited out of the original official BBC audio releases of On The Hour (it was later re-instated in a 2009 CD release on Warp Records. In 1992 and 1993, they wrote and performed Lionel Nimrod's Inexplicable World for BBC Radio 4. For BBC Radio 1, they wrote and performed one series of Fist of Fun (1993), which later transferred to television and would pave the way for their mainstream success. Fist of Fun made several subtle references to their dislike for former colleague Patrick Marber. Lee and Herring fell out with the On The Hour team after a row over ownership of characters; Patrick Marber has claimed that he invented the character of news reporter Peter O'Hanraha-hanrahan, while Lee and Herring also claim to have invented the character.A text box in Fist of Fun's first series. After the radio version of Fist of Fun, they presented another Radio 1 show running for 3 series, simply entitled Lee and Herring (but often referred to as Lee & Herring's Radio One Music Show) which featured a mixture of records chosen by the duo themselves, and their comedy sketches and discussions. Their final major work as a double-act was This Morning With Richard Not Judy (TMWRNJ), which aired on Sunday mornings on BBC Two for series in 1998 and 1999, and was famous for being increasingly risqu√© and original. Break-up Lee and Herring went their separate ways at the end of the 1990s and have both enjoyed major fringe and mainstream fame. Stewart Lee retired from stand-up comedy in the early 2000s, a time in which he co-wrote Jerry Springer - The Opera and directed Attention Scum! for Simon Munnery. He made a comeback to stand-up in 2005, touring very successful shows, and has written and performed four series of his own BBC 2 television show Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle. Richard Herring went on to write the sitcoms Time Gentlemen Please for Sky One with Al Murray, and You Can Choose Your Friends (which was loosely based on his own family) for ITV, and worked on the third series of Little Britain as script editor. Herring has written, performed and toured with a number of successful comedy shows including Christ on a Bike, Hitler Moustache and We're All Going To Die, building up an audience through the medium of podcasts which include Collings and Herrin with Andrew Collins and his interview show Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast. 2013 is his 22nd year at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where he has performed 10 different stand-up shows in as many years. Reunions Lee and Herring occasionally reunite for one-off events. Recent collaborations include an interview together for The Guardian and a 2005 review of each other's work for the arts supplement of The Sunday Times. The pair performed a short set at London's Bloomsbury Theatre on 5 February 2007 as part of a tribute to stand- up comedian Ted Chippington. They reunited for a 30-minute performance at the Lyric Theatre in Hammersmith on 16 November 2008, where they were joined at the end by a resurrected \\"Curious Orange\\". A brief reunion took place at the 2010 Edinburgh Fringe at Stewart Lee's Silver Stewbilee show in which Herring heckled him and ran on stage, berating him for his \\"pretentious\\" new book. Lee also \\"appeared\\" as a recorded voicemail message on The Collings and Herrin Podcast Live the following day. Herring interviewed Lee in June 2012 on his series Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast. The filmed version of this encounter has both an individual release by indie company Go Faster Stripe, and acts as extra material on the Series Two Fist of Fun box set. Other podcast appearances between the two include Richard Herring's Edinburgh Fringe Podcast in August 2013 and again for the sixth season of Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast in 2015. On 2 June 2014, Lee and Herring briefly appeared on stage together when Lee introduced Herring's section at a British Humanist Association benefit.

He was born in Marija Gorica, a village in Croatia. When Ottoman Turks raided Carniola in 1553, he was captured. He escaped captivity and became a professional soldier in the Military Frontier. In 1564, he became a serf on the estates of infamous Ferenc Tahy. Three years later, as a semi- professional soldier, he raided Ottoman territories. He was again captured by the Turks, and brought as prisoner to Constantinople. He subsequently escaped, and returned to Croatia in 1572. Due to his military experience, rebel peasants elected him as the captain of their army. Now in command of the rebel forces, he tried to spread the revolt in Slovenia. His forces were defeated at the battles of Kr≈°ko and Sv. Petar. Unlike Matija Gubec, he was not captured immediately and he tried to seek shelter in Ottoman territories. He was captured near Jasenovac and brought to Zagreb, where he was executed.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 761. It is south of Northampton town centre, south-east of Birmingham, and north of central London; junction 15 of the M1 motorway is east by road. The area of the Milton Malsor civil parish is about , stretching from north of the M1 motorway between junctions 15 and 15A, south to the West Coast Main Line, east to the A508 and A45 roads, and west to the A43 road.Parish map History The Malsoures or Malesoures family arms: party azure and gules three crescents argent The village's name is from the Old English middel for \\"Middle\\" and tun meaning farm or settlementNottingham University guide to English place names, accessed 7 April 2010 and the second part of the name appears to be from \\"Malsoures\\", the name of a prominent local family added much later. The first recorded mention of the village is in the days of William the Conqueror and the Domesday Book. This records that there were two manors and two men held lands at Milton as part of their Baronies. These were William Peverel and Goisfrid Alselin.Open Domesday Book section for Milton Malsor, accessed 27 July 2014 Governance War Memorial and Village Hall (behind) in snow on 29 January 2004 The village has a Parish Council with nine members elected every four years (last election 2015). The parish council area extends to include the M1 in the north between junctions 15 and 15a; to the east the A508 Northampton to Milton Keynes main road and A45 towards Huntingdon and Peterborough; to the south part of the West Coast Main Line and to the west the A43 Northampton-Oxford trunk road. The local district council is that of South Northamptonshire where Milton is in Harpole and Grange ward together with the villages of Gayton, Rothersthorpe, Harpole and Kislingbury which elects two members. The parish is in the Northamptonshire County Council division of Bugbrooke (from May 2013) with just over 10,000 electors and has one member, (currently Conservative). The Member of Parliament from 2010 is Mr Chris Heaton-Harris, Conservative, for the Daventry Parliamentary Constituency. Prior to the 2010 General Election the village was in Northampton South Parliamentary Constituency. Initially the Boundary Commission wanted to move the village into the new parliamentary constituency of South Northamptonshire. However, as this was inconvenient for election administration purposes, the Boundary Commission put Milton with fellow ward villages in South Northants Council's \\"Harpole and Grange\\" ward into the Daventry Constituency previously held by Mr Tim Boswell who stood down at 2010 General Election. Geography Flooding in 'The Dip' in 1998 Many fields around the village reflect England's history. The field known as 'the Leys' (opposite Milton House in Rectory Lane) shows clear signs of 18th-century pre- enclosure and pre-British Agricultural Revolution farming in strips although this is slowly disappearing with recent farming. The mediaeval open field system was enclosed in Milton in 1779 together with that of Collingtree. The soil is predominantly sandy as one might expect since the area is the bed of an ancient river. Evidence of sand and clay extraction is all around, reflecting 19th- and 20th-century industrial and urban expansion. For example, the small industrial estate in Gayton Road is on an old clay quarry; the playing and football fields in Collingtree Road are on the sites of sand quarries - in the latter case mostly filled with clay spoil from the 1950s construction of the M1. The field between Towcester Road and the A43 Milton by-pass, which opened in May 1991, to the west of the village was also the site of a sand quarry in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1965 the driver of a mechanical digger spotted a shiny object in a newly exposed face. It turned out to be an early Bronze Age Cinerary Urn. The field between the village and the M1 on the north side of Collingtree Road is an area designated by Northamptonshire County Council for sand extraction. The sand is stated by the county council to be of the 'soft sand' type suitable for mortar. The site is in Milton Malsor parish and only ca.200m from houses in the village. It was originally called the \\"Collingtree site\\" but the county council finally referred to it as the Milton site in late 2008. It has so far not been developed probably due to its triangular shape and stranded location between the motorway along one edge, the railway line another and a road unsuited to heavy lorries on the third. The site is included in the county council's mineral's and waste plan, the subject of a Public Inquiry in 2009. A third Public Inquiry in 2010 retained the site. A stream runs northwest through the village, partly in a conduit but visible from Collingtree Road and Rectory Lane as it flows north through the field known as 'The Dip' after an old sheep dip the remains of which are still visible. In Spring 1998 this flooded, causing minor damage to some houses. The stream flows north joining with others from the east and south flowing south and west around Hunsbury Hill. It then joins the River Nene at Upton, west of Northampton. The Grand Union Canal and its Northampton arm, built in 1815 passes nearby. There is a marina just off the road to Gayton. There are 17 locks on the arm, taking the canal downhill into Northampton and to join the River Nene east of the town. It takes about two hours for a boat to travel through. Demography The United Kingdom Census 2011 showed there were 761 (2001: 713) people living in the village, 359 male (2001: 344), 402 female (2001: 369), with average age 41.1 years (2001: 45.21). There were 311 dwellings (2001: 302). The surrounding South Northamptonshire district is rural and sparsely populated with just over 80,000 people in 2000. New development within the village boundary is restricted to infill development only. A new housing development of 14 houses was completed in Chestnut Close in 2008. A smaller ones of 6 dwellings was begun in 2010 for the derelict Home Farm site off Malzor Lane and one or two others elsewhere. In 2010 a proposal for 25 houses for a site off Stockwell Way was opposed by the parish council and refused by the district council as it was outside the village boundary and contrary to district council adopted policy. Planning details can be accessed via the parish council website. Possible urban extensions to Northampton were proposed in 2007 by the West Northamptonshire Joint Planning Unit, a group formed by Northampton Borough Council, South Northamptonshire District Council and Daventry District Council. These proposals included extensions on land in the parish between the M1 motorway, north of the village, A43 by-pass (west), A508 trunk road (east) and the West Coast main railway line to the south. A parkway station south the village was also mentioned but train operators do not want further stops on the line between London and Rugby via Northampton. Possible expansion of Northampton south of the M1 affecting the village were excluded from draft proposals published for consultation in July 2009. Economy Milton postbox with the insignia of Queen Elizabeth II Village Church of the Holy Cross in 2004 There are two pubs: \\"The Greyhound\\" in Towcester Road, which has a large restaurant, and \\"The Compass\\" in Green Street, a more traditional village pub also offering bar food. The Greyhound is adjacent to the Village Hall and attracts large crowds from Northampton's southern suburbs in summer as it has a large garden area. Both establishments serve good quality real ale with periodic guest bitters. Milton Malsor has a retirement care home for the elderly in Green Street called Holly House. Sheltered housing for older people in the form of 26 flats and bungalows is also provided in the village by South Northants Homes Ltd. The area is centred around Raynsford House which offers a lounge, dining room, laundry, guest facilities and a community alarm service for sheltered housing residents. A shop and former post office and the modern village hall, refurbished in 2008, are both in the High Street opposite the green and War Memorial. The Northampton Hilton Hotel is approximately 1¬Ω miles distant on Watering Lane in the neighbouring village of Collingtree, just off the A45 trunk road. There are several other hotels in the area along the A45 trunk road. The village has two small industrial estates; the larger on Gayton Road is adjacent, but with no access, to the A43. This is referred to locally as 'Gallifords' reflecting its ownership. The smaller is adjacent to the M1 bridge along Collingtree Road and known as 'Maple Court' alluding to its history. There is an architect's office in the old Rectory and additional modern offices on Towcester Road in the converted Hope Brewery and out buildings. A mobile library visits the village every two weeks; the nearest local library is at Hunsbury, about a mile north, next to a large Tesco 'Extra' supermarket and petrol station. There are three working farms in the parish including a free-range egg farm. Landmarks James Harrington, author of Oceana lived and the Baptist Chapel in Green Street founded 1827.

The train travelled a further 1¬Ω miles before more wagons derailed, a little distance north of the village playing field. Some of the wagons went towards the up line from Northampton to London and were hit by a four-coach passenger train at about 70 mph. Although the brakes of the passenger train had been fully applied, two coaches were derailed with one falling onto its side. All 45 passengers and train crew were evacuated fairly promptly. Of these, 21 were injured but only two were detained at Northampton General Hospital. The driver of the passenger train was seriously injured but both he and the passenger detained overnight made a good recovery. The inspector's report on the incident states that \\"...assistance was given by the residents of the nearby village of Milton Malsor and I am informed that members of the Women's Institute of this village were quick to organise refreshment for those involved in the accident and their rescuers\\". The Inspector concluded that the accident resulted from a broken spring on the goods train. A similar accident occurred on 31 December 1969 but about a mile further south near the northern end of Roade Cutting; on this occasion, the driver of the passenger train involved was killed.

Rev Alexander Webster DD (170825 January 1784) was a Scottish writer and minister, who served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1753. Life He was born in Edinburgh in 1708, the son of Rev James Webster, a covenanting minister originally from Fife. Alexander became a minister of the Church of Scotland, beginning his career in Culross in Fife. There he met and married Mary Erskine of Alva, for whom he wrote: :When I see thee, I love thee, but hearing adore, :I wonder, and think you a woman no more; :Till, mad with admiring, I cannot contain, :And, kissing those lips, find you woman again. He propounded a scheme in 1742 for providing pensions for the widows of ministers. The tables which he drew up from information obtained from all the presbyteries of Scotland were based on a system of actuarial calculation that supplied a precedent followed by insurance companies in modern times for reckoning averages of longevity. Webster published in 1748 his Calculations, setting forth the principles on which his scheme for widows' pensions was based; he also wrote a defence of the Methodist movement in 1742, and Zeal for the Civil and Religious Interests of Mankind Commended (1754). In 1755 the government commissioned Webster to obtain data for the first census of Scotland, which he carried out in the same year. In 1753 he was elected moderator of the General Assembly; in 1771 he was appointed a dean of the Chapel Royal and chaplain to George III in Scotland. In 1775 he is listed as living on Castlehill, at the top of the Royal Mile.https://archive.org/stream/williamsonsdirec17751776will#page/100/mode/2up Socially, despite his 'High Flying' Evangelical position in the Kirk, he was a convivial man, known as Bonum Magnum for his capacity for claret. His wife's nephew Boswell often mentions dining with the family. He is buried beside Mary in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh, in a now-unmarked grave. Family He was married to Mary Erskine (d.1766).They had several children. His two eldest sons, John (b. 1738) and James (b. 1740), served in the American Revolutionary War. John was a Captain in the 4th Regiment of Foot. James ('Jamie') was especially well regarded as Lieutenant-Colonel of the 33rd Foot, Lord Cornwallis's own regiment, and acting Brigadier. When he died of wounds after the battle of Guilford Courthouse in 1781, Cornwallis wrote a touching letter of condolence to Alexander Webster. Mary's sister Euphemia Erskine, was the mother of James Boswell. Notes References *Robert Chambers, Traditions of Edinburgh, 1824.

Published from September 1980 through August 1984, it featured articles about hardware and software associated with the Apple II platform and the people and companies who made them. The name was originally used on a newsletter of Apple Software pioneer company, Softape, who in 1980 changed its name to Artsci Inc. The startup capital for Softalk came from Margot Comstock, who had won on the television game show Password, along with a generous contribution after a few months from John Haller and from Comstock and Al Tommervik's second mortgage on their house. Partners William V R Smith III, William Depew contributed early office space in their Softape storeroom and arrived unexpectedly with office desks when Softalk moved into its own location. Unlike other computer magazines that generally focused on a specific, narrow subject matter or market segment (e.g., business applications, games, or professional programming), Softalk gave broad coverage to all parts of the Apple world of the time, from programming tips to game playing, from business to home use, including computing as an industry, a hobby, a tool, a toy, and a culture. On occasion it even ran fiction. Another characteristic of the magazine was a playful, insider-like voice. The experts in those early days chatted in their own relaxed language about the techniques and elements of their world. Bert Kersey, Beagle Bros, was one columnist; as were Doug Carlston, co-founder of Broderbund software; Mark Pelczarski, founder of Penguin Software; Bill Budge, creator of Pinball Construction Set; and Bill Depew, creator of Apple 21 and Magic Window. Cover of IBM PC version of SoftalkA regular feature was a monthly chart of the most popular software in various categories, which was the Apple community's equivalent of the Billboard charts for pop music. Unlike most such bestseller lists, which report shipment from warehouses, not sales, Softalk's bestseller numbers were drawn from polling retail sales in computer stores throughout the world. There were also contests encouraging the participation of readers. Originally, Softalk was sent free to all registered Apple owners, but later it required paid subscription after one free year. Softalk underwent rapid expansion in its early history, with issues getting very thick (largely from advertising), but an industry slump in 1984 caught Softalk with too much unrealized revenues against heavy printing costs, which overtaxed its undercapitalized status. Rather than take the desperate path of erratic publication, the Softalk board chose to cease publication. In its 48 influential months, the original Softalk readership grew from 30,000 names loaned by Apple Computer Inc. to 250,000 readers. In its third and fourth years, Softalk achieved a place on the Folio 400 list of the nation's largest magazines. Related publications When the IBM PC came on the market, Softalk Publishing started \\"'Softalk for the IBM PC.\\"' And with the advent of the Macintosh, Softalk Publishing launched Softalk Mac, written as ST.

This crash claimed one life: the pilot of the aircraft. May 2008‚ÄîUpon departure from Billings, ATC instructed the Beech 1900C to turn left. The Part 135 cargo plane slowly turned right and crashed into a warehouse nearby. Witnesses say the plane was inverted prior to the crash which claimed the life of the single pilot on board. In February 2010, a cargo door came unlatched on an airborne Alpine Air Express Beech 99 carrying mail from Billings, to Kalispell, Montana, at about 1:30 a.m. The plane was about north of Lewistown, Montana, when the pilot noted a light on the instrument panel had come on, indicating the door was unlatched.

As a member of the Yankees, he was part of two World Series championship teams, both wins over the Los Angeles Dodgers, in and . \\"Mick The Quick\\" was generally known as a speedy leadoff hitter who made contact and was an excellent center fielder, with a below-average throwing arm.  Career  The legend of \\"Mick the Quick\\" began during his amateur days at Miami Dade Community College. A fast and athletic outfielder, Rivers emerged as one of the team stars, but once disappeared just moments before the start of a game. His teammates and coaches later discovered Rivers asleep under a nearby tree. Originally signed by the Atlanta Braves, Rivers began his big league career in 1970 with the Angels, playing center field and third base. He stayed with them through the 1975 season. Rivers played part-time in his first few years, until becoming the starter in 1974. He led the American League in triples both years and stole a career-high 70 bases in 1975, tops in the league. Rivers was acquired along with Ed Figueroa by the Yankees from the Angels for Bobby Bonds on December 11, 1975,\\"Angels most active traders,\\" United Press International (UPI), Friday, December 12, 1975. Retrieved May 2, 2020 a trade that immediately paid dividends for the Yankees. Figueroa won 19 games and Rivers enjoyed a career year. Rivers was named to the All-Star team, batted .312, stole 43 bases and posted then-career highs in home runs (8) and runs batted in (67). Rivers placed third in the Most Valuable Player voting behind teammate Thurman Munson and George Brett and was named an outfielder on The Sporting News AL All-Star team. Rivers posted good numbers in his two other full Yankee seasons, including a .326 batting average in 1977, but was traded in the middle of the 1979 season to Texas. He set the single-season record for hits by a Ranger with 210 in 1980. He concluded his career in 1984 with a .295 lifetime average, 267 stolen bases and 1,660 hits. Rivers posted a .308 average in his 29 postseason games. While Rivers played for them, the Yankees won the World Series in 1977 and 1978, both times against the Los Angeles Dodgers. They won the 1976 pennant, but lost in the World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. On September 30, 1984, in Rivers final major league game, he and the Rangers were the victims of the Angel's Mike Witt's perfect game, Witt winning 1-0. Bill James ranked Mickey Rivers as the 59th greatest center fielder of all time. His stooped shuffle as he ambled to the plate masked quick speed out of the box on bunts and sustained speed around the bases. Rivers was honored with many of his teammates from the 1977 World Series champion New York Yankees in the Yankee Old Timers Game in 2007. In The Bronx Is Burning, the ESPN miniseries based on the 1977 Yankees, he was portrayed by Leonard Robinson and portrayed as experiencing financial problems. When Reggie Jackson remarked to a reporter that he had an IQ of 160, Rivers responded, \\"Out of what, a thousand?\\". Rivers' tenure in the Bronx produced other classic quotes, such as when he tried to explain the bizarre dynamics of the Yankees, who featured controversial owner George Steinbrenner and contentious manager Billy Martin. \\"Me and George and Billy,\\" Rivers said, \\"we‚Äôre two of a kind.\\" According to Goose Gossage, when the newly acquired reliever went through a rough stretch of blown saves, Rivers once jumped on top of the bullpen car to prevent Gossage from entering the game.

Early life Born in New York City, Whitney Straight was the son of Major Willard Dickerman Straight (1880‚Äì1918) and heiress Dorothy Payne Whitney (1887‚Äì1968). He was almost six years old when his father died in France of influenza during the great epidemic while serving with the United States Army during the First World War. Following his mother's remarriage to British agronomist Leonard K. Elmhirst (1893‚Äì1974) in 1925, the family moved to England. They lived at Dartington Hall where he attended the progressive school founded by his parents. His education was completed at Trinity College, Cambridge. Career =Motor racing= While still an undergraduate at Cambridge, he became a well known Grand Prix motor racing driver and competed at events in the UK and Europe. He competed in more Grands Prix than any American until after the Second World War. Straight started competing in 1931 with a Brooklands Riley competing at Shelsley Walsh, Southport and Brooklands circuit.Motor Sport, December 1933, Pages 90, 92. In 1933, driving a black and silver Maserati, he won the Mountain Championship at Brooklands,Motor Sport, December 1933, Page 85. the Mont Ventoux Hill Climb (3 September) Motor Sport, October 1933, Page 572. and the Brighton Speed Trials (16 September).Motor Sport, October 1933, Pages 540, 542. He also won the 1100 c.c. class in the Coppa Acerbo, held at Pescara, Italy, driving an M.G. Magnette.Motor Sport, December 1933, Page 84. In 1934 he formed his own motor racing team, personally driving to victory in the South African Grand Prix, held on the 16-mile Buffalo circuit in East London.The Manchester Guardian, 28 December 1934, Page 4. He also gave public demonstrations at Brooklands Racing Circuit achieving a speed of 138.7 mph, a record for 5 litre class cars. =Flying= Flying was also another of his passion. At age 16, though still too young for a pilot's licence, he had already accumulated over 60 hours solo flight. In his early 20s, as head of the Straight Corporation Limited, he operated airlines and airfields throughout Britain and ran flying clubs. He commissioned an advanced light aircraft, the Hendy Heck, and in 1936 he helped develop the Miles Whitney Straight aircraft, the same year he became a naturalised British citizen. On 18 October 1938, the Straight Corporation purchased control of Norman Edgar (Western Airways) Ltd. and renamed it Western Airways Ltd. His commercial airline business in the later 1930s was reputed to be carrying more passengers than Imperial Airways, on short routes within the UK, flying de Havilland Dragon Rapides. Second World War During the Second World War, Whitney Straight served as a Royal Air Force pilot. He was sent to Norway in April 1940 to find frozen lakes suitable for use as airfields. Lake Lesjaskog was utilised by No. 263 Squadron RAF during the Norwegian Campaign as a result. Straight was seriously wounded during a German bombing raid in Norway.Those Other Eagles; Shores, 2004 biog on page 577 For his service in Norway, he was awarded the Norwegian War Cross with sword in 1942. After convalescing, he next served with No. 601 Squadron RAF in the Battle of Britain. From September 1940 until April 1941, he was credited with two aircraft destroyed. He then became commanding officer of 242 Squadron, bringing his total to 3 and 1 shared ( with 2 'probables') by late July 1941.Those Other Eagles; Shores, 2004 biog on page 577 Early in 1941 he was awarded a Military Cross for his work in Norway. He was shot down by flak over France on 31 July 1941 and initially evaded capture. Through the French Underground, he made his way to unoccupied Vichy France where he was captured and put in a POW camp. However he escaped on 22 June 1942 and with the aid of the French Resistance reached safety in Gibraltar. Dakota, 18 January 1945 In September 1942, now as an air commodore, he was sent to the Middle East joining HQ, No. 216 Group, as AOC. After the war At war's end, he returned to the UK becoming AOC, No. 46 Group in June 1945. He was released from the RAF in late 1945, and he became chairman of the Royal Aero Club. With the establishment of the British European Airways corporation in 1946, Straight was its deputy chairman. In July 1947, he became managing director and Chief Executive Officer of British Overseas Airways Corporation. In 1949, Straight was appointed deputy chairman of the board. In the United States his cousin, Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney (1899‚Äì1992), was the President of Aviation Corporation of America, which became Pan American Airways. Around this time he was also on the board of Rolls-Royce and he discovered that in 1947 Rolls-Royce had sold 55 jet engines to the Soviet Union, the sale being approved by the post-war Labour government of Clement Attlee. The Russians had copied the technology to produce their own version of the jet engine and were powering the MiG fighters using Rolls-Royce technology. He decided to sue the Russian government for copyright infringement. The figure claimed was ¬£207 million which he never received. In 1967, he donated the Whitney Straight Award to the Royal Aeronautical Society to recognise the achievement and status of women in aviation.[Flight International, 22 February 1968] The award consisted of a cheque and a sculpture by Barbara Hepworth. It was won by Anne Burns in 1967 and Peggy Hodges in 1970. Personal life On July 17, 1935 he married Lady Daphne Margarita Finch-Hatton (1913‚Äì2003), the daughter of Guy Finch-Hatton, the 14th Earl of Winchilsea (1885‚Äì1939) and Margaretta Armstrong Drexel, the Countess Winchilsea (1885‚Äì1952). Lady Daphne's paternal uncle was Denys Finch Hatton (1887‚Äì1931), a famous pilot who was involved with Beryl Markham (1902‚Äì1986), another British pilot. Lady Daphne was half-American as her mother, Margaretta, was the daughter of Anthony Joseph Drexel, Jr. (1864‚Äì1934) and the granddaughter of Anthony Joseph Drexel (1826‚Äì1893), all from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Lady Daphne's maternal uncles included, Anthony J. Drexel II, who married Marjorie Gould, daughter of George Jay Gould, and John Armstrong Drexel (1891‚Äì1958), who was also an aviation pioneer. Together, Whitney and Lady Daphne had two daughters: *Camilla Caroline Straight, who on 22 June 1960, married Michael Ian Vansittart Bowater (b. 1934) (the son of Lt. Col. Sir Ian Bowater (1904‚Äì1982) and The Hon. Ursula Margaret Dawson (1907‚Äì1999)) **Arabella Charlotte Bowater (1961‚Äì2005), **Katherine Elizabeth Bowater (b. 1963), **Caroline Mary Bowater (b. 1965) **Sophia Melissa Bowater (b. 1970) *Amanda Straight =Relationship with Diana Barnato Walker= While Straight was married to Lady Daphne, he had an affair with noted aviator Diana Barnato Walker, the first British woman to break the sound barrier.Spreading My Wings by Diana Barnato-Walker. Diana was the daughter of Woolf Barnato (1895‚Äì1948), another famous racing driver, and the widow of Wing Commander Derek Ronald Walker, who was killed on 14 November 1945 in bad weather while flying. Together, Whitney and Diana had a son: Barney Barnato Walker (born 1947). =Death= Straight died in Fulham in 1979 at the age of 66. Lady Daphne died at her home in London on June 3, 2003, and Walker died on April 28, 2008, aged 90.

It is northwest of Alton and north of Bentworth, just off the A339 road. The parish covers an area of and has an average elevation of above sea level. The nearest railway station is Alton, southeast of the village. Lasham formerly had its own railway station, Bentworth and Lasham, on the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway until the line's closure in 1936. According to the 2011 census, the village had a population of 176. History The village name has been spelled in various ways, including Esseham (11th century), Lessham (12th century), and Lesseham or Lassham (14th century). Lasham was first mentioned in the Domesday Survey of 1086 by William I (the conqueror) as an alod, and was then assessed at two and a half hides. The Royal Navy used the village name for a Ham class minesweeper, HMS Lasham, which was operational from 1954 to 1981. Lasham Airfield Lasham Airfield in May 2006, looking east. The village is on the right and Avenue Road is on the left, parallel with the main runway Lasham Airfield was constructed in 1942 on high ground north of the village. An avenue of beech trees that was originally planted by George Jervoise in 1809 was partially cut down to make way for the north side of the airfield, and the road running east-west just north of the airfield is still called \\"Avenue Road\\". The Basingstoke-Alton road used to pass through Lasham village but as the land to the north was needed for the west end of the main runway, the road between the Avenue and Lasham village was diverted to the west on lower ground and now by-passes the village, passing between Lasham and Bentworth just west of the old railway station. This road was made of large concrete \\"sets\\" and was built by Italian prisoners of war who were housed in a camp at Thedden Grange southwest of Bentworth. The airfield is now a major centre for the sport of gliding and is owned by Lasham Gliding Society, which bought the land from the Ministry of Defence. The airfield is also used by a company called ATC Lasham Ltd, which services airliners, mainly made by Boeing, in hangars on the south side of the main runway. Highfield Site This is a small group of business units on the road running north east from the church to Avenue Road, just outside the houses of the village proper. =Lasham parish= The church of St Mary, Lasham (CofE), was constructed in 1866 on the site of an older church, some of which went back to Saxon times. The current Lasham parish boundary is Avenue RoadThe Avenue, an old print and today to the north, the A339 to the west and south (except for a small extension west to Spain Lane towards Burkham, and a line to the east between Lasham and Shalden. Previously, for some 200 years, Lasham was part of the Herriard Park estate (which still exists today to the north of the parish). The villages of Herriard and Lasham used to have the same rector, the rectory being in Lasham. Today Lasham is part of a larger CofE benefice which includes the villages of Bentworth, Lasham, Medstead and Shalden, the Rector living in Medstead. Avenue Road. An avenue of beech trees was planted in 1809 by George Purefoy Jervoise MP, to commemorate the golden jubilee of King George III in 1810. The original avenue was one mile long but in 1942 when Lasham Airfield was constructed, some of the avenue was cut down. When the plans became known, Sir George Jeffreys MP wrote a letter of objection which was published in the London Times newspaper on 7 October 1941. The Jervoise family continue to own the land to the north of the airfield today. =Transport links= The village was formerly served by the Bentworth and Lasham railway station on the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway, until its closure to passenger traffic in 1932. Today, the A339 Alton-Basingstoke road runs to the west of the village and the B3349 Alton-Odiham road to the east. Avenue Road, mentioned above and running on the north side of Lasham Airfield, connects the A339 to the B3349 at the Golden Pot public house at the top of the hill between Alton and Odiham. =Geography= Lasham and surrounding villages =References= External links *Hampshire County Council site for Lasham * Lasham * Lasham * Listed Buildings in Lasham, Hampshire, England * Stained Glass Windows at St. Mary, Lasham, Hampshire Category:Villages in Hampshire ","title":"Lasham"},{"id":"2161789","text":"Alexander Charles \\"Oofy\\" Prosser is a recurring fictional character from the stories of British comic writer P.

Pepper cultivars of C. frutescens can be annual or short-lived perennial plants. Flowers are white with a greenish white or greenish yellow corolla, and are either insect- or self-pollinated. The plants' berries typically grow erect; ellipsoid-conical to lanceoloid shaped. They are usually very small and pungent, growing long and in diameter. Fruit typically grows a pale yellow and matures to a bright red, but can also be other colors. C. frutescens has a smaller variety of shapes compared to other Capsicum species. C. frutescens has been bred to produce ornamental strains because of its large quantities of erect peppers growing in colorful ripening patterns. Cultivars Green Capsicum frutescens Capsicum frutescens includes the following cultivars and/or varieties: *Cabai Rawit, from Indonesia, used in hot Sambal. *Hawaiian pepper *Malagueta pepper *Piri piri, also called African Bird's Eye or African devil *Siling Labuyo, from the Philippines. *Tabasco pepper, used to make Tabasco sauce *Xiaomila pepper, from Yunnan province in China, one of the three most commonly used chilies in Chinese cooking (the other two being the C. annuum \\"Chao Tian Jiao\\" facing heaven pepper and the Two Vitex pepper). Origins and distribution Capsicum frutescens 'Siling Labuyo' from the Philippines, showing the distinctive erect habit of C. frutescens fruits The Capsicum frutescens species likely originated in South or Central America. It spread quickly throughout the tropical and subtropical regions in this area and still grows wild today. Capsicum frutescens is native to Central America and Northern and Western South America. C. frutescens may be related to C. chinense. Uses =Ethiopia= Capsicum frutescens 'Hidalgo' flowers According to Richard Pankhurst, C. frutescens (known as barbar√©) was so important to the national cuisine of Ethiopia, at least as early as the 19th century, \\"that it was cultivated extensively in the warmer areas wherever the soil was suitable.\\"Richard Pankhurst, Economic History of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University, 1968), p. 193. Although it was grown in every province, barbar√© was especially extensive in Yejju, \\"which supplied much of Showa as well as other neighboring provinces\\". He singles out the upper Golima river valley as being almost entirely devoted to the cultivation of this plant, where thousands of acres were devoted to the plant and it was harvested year round.Pankhurst, Economic History, p. 194. =India= This pepper is common in eastern and southern India where it grows readily in a favorable climate. It is known locally by various common names.

Swosey, Jr., in command. Assigned to Reserve Destroyer Division, Pacific Fleet, S. P. Lee spent most of her first two years in the San Diego, California area with a reduced complement. She sailed on 6 February 1923 as part of Destroyer Squadron 11 for combined fleet operations in the Panama Canal Zone. Arriving Balboa 20 days later following exercises en route, the destroyer engaged in tactical and strategic maneuvers through the end of March and returned to San Diego on 11 April. From 25 June to 30 August, S. P. Lee and DesRon 11 cruised the coast of Washington, putting in at Tacoma, Port Angeles, and Seattle and serving as escort to President Warren G.

A spokesperson for him said \\"I can confirm Howard Donald and Katie Halil were married at a private ceremony for close family and friends on 2 January.\\" He is the father of two daughters from two previous relationships, Grace (born June 1998) and Lola (born February 2005). Grace was born to Victoria Piddington, while he had his younger daughter from his relationship with Marie-Christine Musswessels. He also has two sons, Bowie Taylan (born January 2015) and Dougie Bear (born February 2017), with his wife Katie Halil. In April 2010, Donald was granted a super-injunction against former girlfriend, musician Adakini Ntuli, with whom he had been in an on/off relationship from 2000 to 2008. (See Ntuli v Donald) After Ntuli engaged publicist Max Clifford and began negotiations with the News of the World, Donald obtained the super-injunction. The non-publicity side of the injunction was lifted in November 2010. In 2007, he expressed his view that cannabis should be legalised, saying, \\"If more people went out stoned than drunk I think there would be less fighting, less trouble, and less violence.\\"\\"Howard Donald's cannabis campaign\\", Boston Globe, 23 November 2007, retrieved 5 February 2010 He admitted to having \\"dabbled with ecstasy\\" in the past. In June 2012, it was revealed that along with Take That bandmates Gary Barlow and Mark Owen, Donald had invested ¬£26 million in music industry investment schemes. The news attracted controversy when it was understood that the schemes could serve as tax shelters for high-net-worth people. Lawyers responded to the claims, stating the band members \\"paid significant tax, and that they believed the schemes were not for tax avoidance purposes but were legitimate commercial enterprises.\\" References Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:English male singers Category:English songwriters Category:English DJs Category:English expatriates in Germany Category:Take That members Category:People from Droylsden Category:Musicians from Greater Manchester Category:Ivor Novello Award winners ","title":"Howard Donald"},{"id":"2161798","text":"Jason Thomas Orange (born 10 July 1970) is a retired English singer- songwriter.

In the St Trinian's films, Harry is a long-term associate of the girl pupils, a Cockney involved in all sorts of shady dealings. His father sold racecards and, when he was 12, Harry himself was employed as a boot polisher by Miss Fritton, headmistress of St Trinian's, and may be an antithesis of Harry Flashman (the bully) of the 1857 book Tom Brown's School Days. The Belles of St Trinian's, film released in 1954 As an adult, Harry is one of the few whom the pupils trust: he helps to bottle and sell their gin, distilled in the school chemistry lab, and places bets on race horses for them. Harry also runs the St Trinian's Matrimonial Agency for the teenage Sixth Form girls, setting them up with wealthy men. He even runs a betting scam of his own.

She was completed during World War II and provided air cover over the amphibious landing at Salerno, Italy, in September 1943. The ship was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean at the end of the year. Unicorn supported the aircraft carriers of the fleet on their operations until the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) was formed in November 1944. She was transferred to Australia in early 1945 to support the BPF's operations during Operation Iceberg, the Allied invasion of Okinawa in May. To shorten the time required to replenish the BPF's carriers, the ship was based in the Admiralty Islands and in the Philippine Islands until the Japanese surrender in August. Unicorn was decommissioned and placed in reserve when she returned to the UK in January 1946. The ship was recommissioned in 1949 to support the light carrier of the Far East Fleet, as the Eastern Fleet had been redesignated after the end of World War II. She was unloading aircraft and equipment in Singapore in June 1950 when the Korean War began. She spent most of the war ferrying aircraft, troops, stores and equipment in support of Commonwealth operations in Korea. Unicorn supported other carriers during operations in Korea, but she became the only aircraft carrier to conduct a shore bombardment with her guns during wartime when she attacked North Korean observers on the coast during the war.Hobbs 2007, pp. 58‚Äì59 The ship returned to the UK after the end of the war and was again placed in reserve. She was listed for disposal in 1958 and sold for scrap in 1959. Design and description The Abyssinia Crisis of 1934‚Äì35 demonstrated to the Admiralty that it needed a depot ship to support the aircraft carriers in active service, just like submarine and destroyer tenders supported those types. Such a ship would be able to perform a wider range of aircraft repair and maintenance tasks than aircraft carriers and on the full range of aircraft operated by the Royal Navy, including amphibians. Admiral Reginald Henderson, Controller of the Navy was instrumental for gaining approval for the ship and ensuring that she had a complete flight deck that would allow her to land, service and launch aircraft on active operations.Friedman, p. 172 She was the first ship built in any navy that could \\"carry out the full range of aircraft maintenance and repair work in addition to the ability to operate aircraft from the flight deck\\".Hobbs 2007, p. 41 In practice, Unicorn proved the value of the concept and two similar support ships, and were converted into aircraft maintenance ships by modifying light aircraft carriers still under construction.Friedman, pp. 237, 239 Unicorn had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She was somewhat overweight as completed and displaced at standard load rather than her designed .Lenton, p. 106 Each of the ship's two sets of Parsons geared steam turbines drove one propeller.Brown 1984, p. 23 Steam was supplied by six Admiralty three-drum water-tube boilers operating at a pressure of . The turbines were designed for a total of and gave Unicorn a speed of . The ship carried of fuel oil which gave her a range of at . In order to land aircraft aboard, Unicorn was designed with a full-length, -long flight deck with arresting gear. She was also fitted with a catapult capable of launching a aircraft to a speed of .Ford, p. 416 The ship had two hangars, each high. The upper hangar was 324ft by 65ft, and the lower 360ft by 62ft. Aircraft were transported between the hangars and the flight deck by two aircraft lifts (elevators); the forward lift measured and the rear one . Unicorn could carry about 36 operational aircraft. Bulk petrol storage consisted of .Friedman, p. 367 During wartime, the ship's crew totaled 1200.Chesneau, p. 21 The ship carried a self-propelled lighter under the rear of the flight deck to allow unflyable aircraft to be transferred between ships or to shore facilities. This lighter was lowered flush with the upper hangar deck so that an aircraft could be rolled onto it or an aircraft could be lifted onto it once the lighter was in the water.Hobbs, p. 43 Unicorn was armed with four twin mounts for the 45-calibre QF 4-inch Mk XVI dual purpose gun. This mounting could elevate from ‚àí10 to +80¬∞. The Mk XVI gun fired about 12 high-explosive shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of . Against surface targets it had a range of and a maximum ceiling of , but an effective anti-aircraft range of much less.Campbell, p. 56 She was also equipped with four quadruple mounts for the QF 2-pounder Mk VIII gun (\\"pom-pom\\"). These gun mounts could depress to ‚àí10¬∞ and elevate to a maximum of +80¬∞. The Mk VIII 2-pounder gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a distance of . The gun's rate of fire was approximately 96‚Äì98 rounds per minute.Campbell, pp. 71‚Äì74 Close-range air defence was provided by twelve 20 mm Oerlikon autocannon, in two twin mounts and eight single ones. The Oerlikon fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . It had a rate of fire of 465‚Äì480 rounds per minute and a maximum range of .Campbell, pp. 75‚Äì76 The ship was equipped with two HACS (High Angle Control System) directors on her island and each \\"pom-pom\\" mount had its own director as well. Unicorn was the first ship to mount a Type 281B early-warning radar,Howse, p. 169 and each HACS director was fitted with a Type 285 gunnery radar. Construction and service Unicorn was ordered on 14 April 1939, and laid down at Harland and Wolff in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 29 June. Her construction was delayed several times in favour of higher priority projects and she was not launched until 20 November 1941. The ship was completed on 12 March 1943. In order to accelerate the ship's completion, the Admiralty decided in 1942 that she would not be equipped with her full suite of maintenance and repair equipment.Hobbs, p. 44 Excluding her armament, Unicorn cost ¬£2,531,000. Whilst working up, 818 and 824 Squadrons flew aboard in April 1943. 818 Squadron had nine Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers and 824 Squadron had six. 887 Squadron, with nine Supermarine Seafire IIC fighters was also embarked during this time.Sturtivant, pp. 238, 258, 370 In late May, Unicorn escorted Convoy MKF 15 to Gibraltar while carrying a number of Royal Air Force Bristol Beaufighters that she off-loaded there. She escorted the returning convoy back to the Clyde in early June. Together with the aircraft carrier , the ship made a sweep towards the Norwegian coast as part of Operation Governor, a diversion for the Allied landings in Sicily in early July.Hobbs 2007, p. 45 For this operation, 887 Squadron was replaced by 800 Squadron with Hawker Sea Hurricanes.Sturtivant, pp. 157‚Äì58, 370 Unicorn was assigned to Force V, a flotilla of British carriers, commanded by Admiral Philip Vian, intended to provide air cover to Operation Avalanche, the Allied landings at Salerno. In preparation for this mission, the ship disembarked all of her Swordfish, except for a small detachment of three from 818 Squadron for self-defence, and the Sea Hurricanes of 800 Squadron. They were replaced by Seafires of 809 and 897 Squadrons. Each of the Seafire squadrons had 10 aircraft, for a total of 33.Brown, J. D., p. 65 Unicorn joined the escort carriers of Force V in August at Gibraltar before they moved forward to the Central Mediterranean for intensive training prior to the commencement of the amphibious landing on 9 September.Hobbs 2007, pp. 45‚Äì46 The ship's Seafires flew 75 sorties on the first day of operations and 60 on 10 September, but the Seafire was not well suited to carrier landings in low wind conditions and many were damaged in landing accidents. 44 sorties were flown on 11 September and only 18 on 12 September, even though Unicorns mechanics had managed to repair ten Seafires over the previous night. The fighter shortage grew so acute during the operation that fighters from the carriers Illustrious and , intended to provide distant cover against an attempt by the Italian fleet to interfere with the invasion, staged forward to Unicorn in order to provide air cover over the landings.Hobbs 2007, pp. 46‚Äì47 By 12 September, the situation had improved so that 887 Squadron was able to fly off six Seafires to a temporary airfield ashore. The ship returned to the UK on 20 September with a full load of damaged Seafires, in addition to her own aircraft, that were off-loaded at Glasgow to be repaired. Afterwards, she was refitted by her builders and reconfigured for her designed role as an aircraft repair ship.Hobbs 2007, p. 47 =In the Far East= Unicorn and in Ceylon, 1944 At the end of December 1943, Unicorn joined Illustrious, the battlecruiser and the battleships and , the other reinforcements for the Eastern Fleet. Only four Swordfish from 818 Squadron were carried aboard at this time.Sturtivant, p. 238 The ship delivered a consignment of aircraft to Royal Navy Air Station Cochin, India, on 27 January 1944 before arriving at Trincomalee, Ceylon on 2 February. In addition to her repair duties, the ship was often used for deck-landing practice. She was given a brief refit in Bombay during May.Hobbs 2007, p. 48 On 23 August, 818 Squadron was transferred to and later disbanded. On 7 November, 817 Squadron flew aboard to provide anti-submarine protection with its Fairey BarracudasSturtivant, pp. 236, 238 as Unicorn was ordered to Durban, South Africa. There she was to be modified with separate workshops and additional equipment to accommodate American engines which used different screw threads and electrical fittings.Hobbs 2007, pp. 48, 52 That same month, Unicorn was transferred to the newly formed BPF. She left Durban on 1 January 1945 and arrived at Colombo, Ceylon where she conducted deck-landing practice for pilots new to the BPF. The ship loaded 82 aircraft and 120 engines later in the month for transport to Australia, emptying the available stocks of the Eastern Fleet, and departed for Sydney on 29 January. Unicorn arrived on 12 February and disembarked her stored aircraft. She sailed for Manus Island, in the Admiralty Islands, on 28 February to support the BPF's training before the opening stages of Operation Iceberg. The ship arrived at San Pedro Bay, Philippines on 27 March which was to serve as the BPF's intermediate replenishment base while it supported Operation Iceberg.Hobbs 2007, pp. 52‚Äì53 The BPF was tasked to attack Japanese airfields in the Sakishima Islands and Formosa before and during the early stages of the invasion of Okinawa. Unicorn was primarily engaged in preparing aircraft for issue to the operational squadrons aboard the fleet carriers during this time,Hobbs 2011, p. 165 rather than repair them, but she did repair, modify or service 105 aircraft in March‚ÄìMay 1945. The ship sailed for Australia on 22 May and arrived in Sydney on 1 June. She sailed for Brisbane on 6 June to have her bottom cleaned at the Cairncross Dockyard and to load more replacement aircraft. Unicorn arrived at Manus on 22 July to prepare for operations off Japan. She was still there when Japan surrendered on 15 August. The ship began to ferry aircraft, equipment and men back to Australia after the surrender, a task which ended on 6 November, when she arrived at Sydney. Unicorn departed for home in December 1945 and arrived in Plymouth in January 1946. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve.Hobbs 2007, pp. 38, 54‚Äì55 =Post-war= HMS Unicorn with U.S. Navy ships at Sasebo, Japan, 1950 In 1949, Unicorn was reactivated for service in the Far East, in support of the carrier . She sailed from HMNB Devonport on 22 September with a cargo of Seafires and Fireflies. When the Korean War broke out in June 1950, the ship was disembarking aircraft, equipment and her maintenance personnel at RAF Sembawang, Singapore in preparation to return home and then to reserve. The Admiralty ordered her to be used as a replenishment carrier to ferry replacement aircraft and supplies to the Royal Navy and Commonwealth aircraft carriers operating in Korean waters. Unicorn left Singapore on 11 July and arrived at Sasebo, Japan, on 20 July and transferred seven Seafires and five Fireflies to Triumph. In August, the ship ferried the 1st Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment and the Headquarters of the 27th Brigade from Hong Kong to Pusan, arriving on 29 August. She delivered supplies to Sasebo before returning to Singapore to begin a refit.Hobbs 2007, pp. 55‚Äì57 Unicorn resumed her duties in December, carrying about 400 troops in addition to the usual aircraft, stores and equipment. She was used by pilots for deck-landing practice en route. In March, she ferried the Gloster Meteor jet fighters of No. 77 Squadron RAAF to Iwakuni, Japan. The ship remained there for the next three months so she could be used as an accommodation ship. Afterwards, Unicorn resumed her role as a ferry carrier. Whilst transiting the Shimonoseki Strait on 2 October, she destroyed the overhead power cables stretching between Honshu and Kyushu as they were sagging lower than normal due to a heavy snowfall. On 21 November, Unicorn and the carrier exchanged crews at Singapore and the ship began a refit shortly afterwards. After her refit was completed on 20 January 1952, she returned to her ferry duties.Hobbs 2007, pp. 57‚Äì59, 61 In April, she was \\"adopted\\" by the Middlesex Regiment (possibly one of only three ships to be honoured by an Army regiment).Hobbs 2007, p. 61 During operations by in July, the ship acted as a spare flight deck to allow for damaged aircraft to land without disrupting the strike operations. She arrived back at Singapore on 27 July to load more replacement aircraft, including Meteors, and sailed on 9 August for Japan. During September, Unicorn borrowed four of Oceans Hawker Sea Fury fighters to fly combat air patrols over the fleet whilst the latter ship conducted strike operations. She was docked for maintenance in October, and embarked the First Sea Lord, Admiral Rhoderick McGrigor and the Commander-in- Chief, Far East Station for a tour of Commonwealth forces in Japan. At one point, Unicorn became the only aircraft carrier to conduct a shore bombardment during wartime when she engaged North Korean coastwatchers at Chopekki Point.Hobbs 2007, pp. 58‚Äì59, 61 The ship returned to Singapore for another refit on 15 December and did not leave Singapore until 17 July 1953. On 26 July, en route for Japan, Unicorn received a distress call from , saying that she was under attack by pirates. The carrier closed on the freighter's position at high speed and the pirates abandoned their prize when Unicorn circled the freighter with all guns bearing at less than . The Korean Armistice Agreement came into effect the following day, but the ship accompanied Ocean on two patrols on 30 July and 25‚Äì29 August to monitor North Korean compliance with the terms of the armistice. She sailed for home on 15 October and arrived at Devonport on 17 November, where she returned to reserve.Hobbs 2007, pp. 62‚Äì63 =Disposal= In 1951, Unicorn was considered for modernisation to make her capable of operating modern, heavier jet aircraft. This would have required fitting of a steam catapult, reinforcing her flight deck to handle heavier aircraft and moving and enlarging her forward lift to make room for the new catapult and larger aircraft. A new crane would also have been necessary to handle the heavier aircraft. The Director of Naval Construction proposed to combine both of her hangars into a single one to eliminate problems with hangar height, but this was rejected because of the excessive cost. This reconstruction would have begun in July 1954, but the entire scheme was cancelled in November 1952 because providing existing carriers with angled flight decks was much more important.Friedman, p. 314 Unicorn was redesignated as a Ferry Carrier in June 1953.Blackman 1953, p. 20. The ship was reduced to extended reserve in March 1957 and placed on the disposal list in 1958. Unicorn was sold for scrap in June 1959 and arrived at Dalmuir on 15 June to begin the process.

The cultivation, transplantation, sale, or purchase of Coreopsis lanceolata is now prohibited and the plant has become the subject of a nationwide destruction campaign, even earning a spot on the Ecological Society of Japan's 100 Worst Invasive Species list.Flora of China, ÂâëÂè∂ÈáëÈ∏°Ëèä jian ye jin ji ju, Coreopsis lanceolata Linnaeus The species is also considered an invasive weed in Eastern Australia. Coreopsis lanceolate lucid central weeds Cultivation Coreopsis lanceolata is useful for pollinator restoration in large urban cities for providing a food source for wildlife as they tend to drink the nectar and/or eat the seed. The plant should not be over watered as it will flop over. Honeybees and butterflies are attracted to this plant and it may be restricted by growing in containers or in lawns that tend to be mowed. It requires little maintenance, although Deadheading is beneficial. It prefers a sandy, well-drained soil. Heavy, clay-based soil retains moisture in winter months, which can kill many species. However, rhizomatous coreopsis (underground stems) are well-adapted to withstand the extremes in soil moisture (both wet and dry). Adding compost to heavy soil can improve drainage as can creating a mounded bed, allows the planting area to shed rain faster than the ground around it. It thrives in full sun (4‚Äì6 hours of direct sunlight per day).

Originally designed as a heavy cruiser and laid down under the name Cavendish, she was converted into an aircraft carrier while still being built. Renamed in 1918, she was completed a few weeks before the end of the war and saw no active service with the Grand Fleet. The following year she participated in the British campaign in the Baltic against the Bolsheviks during which her aircraft made numerous attacks against the naval base at Kronstadt. Vindictive returned home at the end of the year and was placed in reserve for several years before her flight decks were removed and she was reconverted back into a cruiser. The ship retained her aircraft hangar and conducted trials with an aircraft catapult before she was sent to the China Station in 1926. A year after her return in 1928, she was again placed in reserve. Vindictive was demilitarized and converted into a training ship in 1936‚Äì1937. At the beginning of the Second World War she was converted into a repair ship. Her first role after the conversion was completed in early 1940, however, was to transport troops during the Norwegian Campaign. She was then sent to the South Atlantic to support British ships serving there and, in late 1942, to the Mediterranean to support the ships there. Vindictive returned home in 1944 and was damaged by a German torpedo off the coast of Normandy after the Allies invaded France. She was reduced to reserve after the war and sold for scrap in 1946. Background and description The Hawkins-class cruiser was designed to hunt enemy commerce raiders overseas. This required a large ship to provide the necessary endurance for sustained operations away from supporting bases and high speed to catch the raiders. The design was also given high freeboard to allow it to maintain its speed in heavy weather. Sir Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt, the Director of Naval Construction, included both coal and oil-fired boilers to provide the ship with fuel no matter the supply conditions. Four ships were ordered, named after famous Elizabethan seafarers, in 1915 and the fifth and last was ordered in April 1916, named HMS Cavendish after the adventurer and circumnavigator Thomas Cavendish. By this time the threat from German cruisers and raiders had ended, so construction proceeded slowly.Friedman 2010, pp. 65; Raven & Roberts, pp. 51‚Äì52 The cruisers had an overall length of , a beam of , and a mean draught of at deep load. They were designed to displace and had a complement of 37 officers and 672 enlisted men.Friedman 2010, p. 390 The ships had four Parsons geared steam turbines, each of which drove one propeller shaft. The turbines were designed to produce a total of for a speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by 12 Yarrow boilers; 8 of these were oil-fired while the remaining 4 used coal. They had a stowage capacity of of coal and of fuel oil, giving her a range of at a speed of .Hobbs, p. 41 The main armament of the Hawkins-class cruisers consisted of seven 45-calibre Mk VI guns in pivot mounts. They were arranged in two superfiring pairs, one each fore and aft of the superstructure, one on each broadside abreast the rear funnel, and the last was on the quarterdeck at the same level as the lower of the rear superfiring pair; they were designated 1 through 7 from front to rear.Raven & Roberts, p. 53 At maximum elevation these guns fired a shell to a range of .Friedman 2011, p. 78 Their secondary armament comprised a dozen quick-firing (QF) 3-inch 20 cwt guns. Eight of these were on low-angle mounts intended for use against torpedo boats and the remaining four were on high-angle mounts for anti-aircraft defence. They also mounted two submerged tubes, one on each broadside, and four above-water tubes, two on each broadside, for 21-inch torpedoes. The Hawkins-class cruisers were protected with an armour that had a maximum thickness of 4 inches abreast the ships' magazines and a minimum thickness of . It consisted of two layers of high-tensile steel of varying thicknesses that covered most of the ships' sides. The decks had a maximum thickness of over the engine rooms, boilers, and the steering gear. The conning tower and its communication tube were protected by the only Krupp cemented armour in the ships and had thicknesses of 3 inches and respectively.Friedman 2010, p. 67; Raven & Roberts, p. 405 =Conversion into an aircraft carrier= In January 1917, the Board of Admiralty reviewed the navy's aircraft carrier requirements and decided to order two ships fitted with a flying-off deck as well as a landing deck aft. The initial order had to be cancelled in April 1917 for lack of building facilities, so the Admiralty decided to convert Cavendish, already under construction, in June 1917. No. 2 7.5-inch gun, two 3-inch guns and the conning tower were removed and the forward superstructure was remodelled into a hangar with a capacity for six reconnaissance aircraft. The hangar roof, with a small extension, formed the flying-off deck. The aircraft were hoisted up through a hatch at the aft end of the flying-off deck by two derricks. The landing deck required the removal of Nos. 5 and 6 7.5-inch guns and moving the four 3-inch AA guns to an elevated platform between the funnels, in lieu of the 3-inch guns intended for that position.Layman, pp. 62‚Äì63 A port side gangway wide connected the landing and flying-off decks to allow aircraft with their wings folded to be wheeled from one to the other. A crash barrier was hung from \\"the gallows\\" at the forward end of the landing on deck. To increase her stability after the addition of so much topweight, the upper portion of her anti-torpedo bulge was enlarged.Friedman 1988, pp. 51, 57 Although still overweight compared to her designed displacement, the modifications made the ship lighter than her sister ships, at light displacement and a metacentric height of . She completed her sea trials on 21 September 1918 and reached a speed of from . Construction and career Cavendish was laid down at the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast on 26 June 1916 and launched on 17 January 1918.Hobbs, p. 43 In June she was renamed Vindictive, the fifth ship of that name in the RN,Colledge, p. 375 to perpetuate the name of the old protected cruiser , which had distinguished herself in the Zeebrugge Raid of April 1918 and had then been sunk as a blockship at Ostend in May.Raven & Roberts, p. 55 She commissioned on 1 October and, after briefly working up, joined the Grand Fleet's Flying Squadron on 18 October only a few weeks before the Armistice on 11 November. For the rest of the year she conducted flying trials and exercises, including those of the Port Victoria Grain Griffin reconnaissance aircraft, of which two were lost in accidents. The only landing aboard the ship was made by William Wakefield on 1 November in the fleet's last operational Sopwith Pup.Layman, pp. 64‚Äì65 Experiments conducted earlier aboard the larger , with a similarly intact superstructure and funnels, had demonstrated that the turbulence from these was enough to make successful landings almost impossible at high speed. Wakefield minimised the problem by approaching the landing deck at an angle with the ship slowly moving.Friedman 1988, p. 51; Hobbs, p. 40 Vindictive was dispatched to the Baltic with a dozen aircraft, a mix of Griffins, Sopwith 2F.1 fighters, Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter and Short Type 184 bombers, on 2 July 1919 to participate in the British campaign in the Baltic in support of the White Russians and the newly independent Baltic states.Layman, pp. 65‚Äì66 On 6 July she ran aground on a shoal near Reval at speed. Stuck hard in the tideless Baltic, all of her fuel was dumped overboard, and most of her ammunition as well. Some of stores were also off- loaded, but the ship could not be towed free by the combined efforts of the light cruisers and and three tugboats. Eight days after grounding a fortuitous westerly wind began that raised the water level by , just enough to pull the ship free. Unbeknownst to the British the entire operation had taken place in a minefield.Head, p. 224 The carrier unloaded her air group, commanded by Major Grahame Donald, at Koivisto, Finland on 14 July. Their airfield was still under construction, but they were able to fly a reconnaissance mission over the major Bolshevik naval base at Kronstadt on 26 July while Vindictive sailed to Copenhagen, Denmark, to load aircraft and spares left for her by the carrier . Four days later, Rear Admiral Walter Cowan ordered Donald and his aircraft to attack Kronstadt at night. As their airfield was not yet finished, the ship's flying-off deck was extended to to better allow the bombers to take off with their bombs. Accurate anti-aircraft fire kept the aircraft too high for an effective attack, but Donald's men claimed two hits on the submarine tender Pamiat Azova. In reality one bomb struck the oil tanker Tatiana, setting it on fire and killing one man. That same day eight RN Coastal Motor Boat (CMB)s arrived; Vindictive served as their depot ship.Head, pp. 224, 227; Layman, p. 66 Vindictives aircraft continued to support British operations against the Bolsheviks until they left the Baltic in December, although no further missions were flown from the carrier. They shot down a helium-filled observation balloon and spotted for ships conducted shore bombardments. Most importantly, nine of them attacked Kronstadt during the night of 17/18 August 1919 to provide a diversion for an attack by the CMBs on ships in Kronstadt harbour. As a result, the torpedo boats damaged the battleship and sank Pamiat Azova. In subsequent attacks on Kronstadt, they nearly hit Andrei Pervozvanny while she was in drydock, nearly hit a minesweeper, killing one crewman from the explosion, and hit two auxiliary ships. By December it was clear that the Whites' offensive against Petrograd had failed and the British began withdrawing; Vindictive left three Camels in Latvia, embarked the rest of her aircraft and sailed for home on 22 December.Head, pp. 227, 231‚Äì33, 236; Layman, p. 66 She was paid off into reserve at Portsmouth Dockyard on 24 DecemberLayman, p. 66 and received permanent repairs of her damage from the grounding, at a cost of ¬£200,000.Chesneau, p. 91 Furious and Vindictive had proven that the idea of \\"cruiser-carriers\\" was unworkable due to the turbulence from their superstructures and that a complete flight deck was necessary to successfully operate aircraft at sea. The Admiralty had considered converting her to that configuration, with an island, in July 1918 while still building, but had decided to wait on the results of tests conducted with Argus evaluating different designs for the island. Vindictive was thought to be too small to be an effective carrier and the financial restrictions in place after the war vitiated against such a major reconstruction.Friedman 1988, p. 51; Hobbs, p. 41 =As cruiser= Vindictive in China after re-conversion into a cruiser, 1926 For the next several years the ship was either in reserve or used as a troop transport, until she began reconversion into a cruiser at Chatham Dockyard on 1 March 1923. The flight decks were removed and she was mostly restored to her designed configuration, although her 3-inch AA guns were replaced by three QF 4 inch Mk V AA guns. Two of these were mounted on a platform between the aft funnel and the mainmast and the third gun was positioned on the quarterdeck between the two 7.5-inch guns. The major exception was that No. 2 7.5-inch gun was not installed and she retained her hangar in the forward superstructure. The two derricks that serviced the hangar were replaced by a single crane on the starboard side of the hangar roof. No. 2's position was occupied by a prototype compressed-air Carey aircraft catapult, the first British cruiser to mount a catapult. Vindictive used it for the first time on 3 October when she launched a Fairey IIID floatplane. She also conducted catapult trials on float-equipped Fairey Flycatcher fighters.Layman, p. 66; Raven & Roberts, pp. 55, 404 She sailed for the China Station on 1 January 1926 with six Fairey IIIDs aboard for anti- piracy patrols and departed for home on 14 March 1928. She arrived in May and her catapult was removed in October, ending her career as an aviation ship. Vindictive was again reduced to reserve in 1929, making occasional trooping voyages.Hobbs, p. 43, Layman, p. 66 In July 1935 the ship was briefly sailed from her reserve mooring to join in the King George V's Silver Jubilee Fleet Review held on the 15th.http://www.britainsnavy.co.uk/Ships/HMS%20Vindictive/HMS%20Vindictive%20(1925)%20CC%205.htm =As training ship= Vindictive in September 1937 as a training ship In 1936‚Äì1937, Vindictive was demilitarised in accordance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty and converted to a training ship for cadets. Her two inboard propellers were removed as were the inboard turbines; half of her boilers were removed and their compartments were converted into accommodations. The aft funnel was removed, the aft superstructure remodelled and enlarged and her hangar converted into more accommodation space. Her armament, including the above-water torpedo tubes, was replaced by a pair of guns forward and a quadruple QF 2-pounder (\\"pom-pom\\") AA mount aft. In this form she displaced and was capable of a maximum speed of .Friedman 2010, p. 67; Lenton, pp. 583‚Äì84; Raven & Roberts, p. 225 She was recommissioned on 7 September 1937. =As fleet repair ship= After the Second World War began in August 1939, Vindictive was transferred to Devonport for a modernisation like that of her sister , with nine guns, four twin-gun mounts and a catapult. She had a low priority so little work had been done by early October, when a less complex modernisation was considered. This proposal had six 6-inch guns and three 4-inch AA guns, and her former aft boiler room was to be converted from a laundry into an oil tank to extend her range, but this was rejected in favour of a conversion into a fleet repair ship. Her armament was removed and her forward superstructure was extended over the former hangar's roof. Her aft superstructure was extended to be flush with her sides and slightly lengthened, and a large deckhouse was built on the quarterdeck. Her armament now consisted of six single 4-inch QF Mk V AA guns, all on the centreline, two quadruple \\"pom-pom\\" mounts, one on each side, and six depth charges. In this role, she had a standard displacement of ( at full load) and her draught increased to .Friedman 2010, pp. 67, 75; Lenton, p. 589 Vindictive nearly hit by bombs while at anchor in Harstad Fjord, 17 May 1940 The conversion was completed on 30 March 1940,Friedman 2010, p. 75 just in time for the ship to be used with the Home Fleet as a troop transport during the Norwegian Campaign. She ferried British troops to Narvik in late April and escorted an evacuation convoy from Harstad on 4 June.Rohwer, pp. 21, 25 Vindictive was transferred to the South Atlantic later in the year and remained there until late 1942, when she was ordered north. On the night of 12 November, she was attacked west of Gibraltar by the , but managed to evade the torpedoes. U-515 sank the accompanying destroyer tender and blew the stern off one of the escorting destroyers, .Blair, p. 111 She remained with the Mediterranean Fleet until 1944, when she was recalled to support the ships participating in Operation Overlord. During this time she received her first radars. By August 1943 she mounted a Type 286 target indication set as well as a Type 285 anti- aircraft gunnery radar. By January 1944 she had received a Type 291 air warning radar. Her light AA armament had also been augmented by six Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon, three on each side of the roof of the large workshop abaft the funnel.Friedman 2010, p. 67 In 1944 Vindictive was converted into a destroyer depot ship and her AA armament was reinforced by the addition of six more Oerlikons. Later that year, the 4-inch guns were removed and eight additional Oerlikons were added. In early August 1944, the ship was damaged by a long-range, circling, \\"Dackel\\" torpedo dropped by the Luftwaffe off the coast of Normandy.Rohwer, p. 338 In 1945 she received an additional six Oerlikons.Lenton, p. 589 She was paid off into reserve on 8 September 1945 and was sold for scrap on 24 January 1946. Vindictive was subsequently broken up at Blyth.

G. Wodehouse. Sometimes referred to as a \\"nerve specialist\\" or a \\"loony doctor\\", he is a prominent practitioner of psychiatry in Wodehouse's works, appearing in several Jeeves stories and in one Blandings Castle story. Though he is initially antagonistic towards Bertie Wooster, they become friends in later stories. Inspiration The character of Sir Roderick Glossop was inspired by Dr. Henry Crawford MacBryan, who operated a psychiatric nursing home in the hamlet of Ditteridge, in the village of Box, Wiltshire, near Cheney House where a young Wodehouse lived with his aunts. Life and character Sir Roderick Glossop is the father of Honoria Glossop and Oswald Glossop. He is first married to Lady Glossop, a friend of Bertie's Aunt Agatha, and later to Lady Chuffnell, aunt of \\"Chuffy\\", Lord Chuffnell. He went to school with Lord Emsworth, who states that Glossop was an unpleasant boy who had a nasty and superior manner. Glossop has a pleasant baritone voice, and as a penniless medical student, sang at smoking concerts.Cawthorne (2013), pp. 222‚Äì223 His residences are 6b Harley Street and Ditteredge Hall, Hampshire.Ring & Jaggard (1999), pp. 102‚Äì104. He is formally called a nerve specialist or a brain specialist, though Bertie thinks of him as a \\"high- priced loony-doctor\\".Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Thank You, Jeeves, chapter 1, p. 13 . Even after they become friends, Bertie still refers to Glossop as \\"the eminent loony doctor\\".Wodehouse (1968) [1966], Plum Pie, chapter 1, pp. 7‚Äì8. He is a well-known psychiatrist, and, according to Bertie, \\"practically every posh family in the country has called him in at one time or another\\".Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 7, p. 74. He is described as serious-minded by Bertie Wooster's Aunt Agatha, who tells Bertie that Sir Roderick is President of the West London branch of the anti-gambling league, drinks no wine, disapproves of smoking, and, due to an impaired digestion, can only eat simple food. She also says that he does not approve of coffee, as he considers it \\"the root of half the nerve-trouble in the world.\\"Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 7, p. 76. When Bertie sees Glossop in \\"Sir Roderick Comes to Lunch\\", he describes Glossop as an \\"extraordinarily formidable old bird,\\" stating: > He had a pair of shaggy eyebrows which gave his eyes a piercing look which > was not at all the sort of thing a fellow wanted to encounter on an empty > stomach. He was fairly tall and fairly broad, and he had the most enormous > head, with practically no hair on it, which made it seem bigger and much > more like the dome of St Paul's. I suppose he must have taken about a nine > or something in hats. Shows what a rotten thing it is to let your brain > develop too much.Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 8, > p. 79. In that story, Glossop has lunch with Bertie to judge whether or not Bertie is mentally sound and fit to marry Honoria. Incidents arise that lead him to render a negative judgment, especially when Glossop, who strongly dislikes cats, is surprised by three cats in Bertie's flat. This incident is often recounted in later stories, with the number of cats being exaggerated as twenty-three. In \\"Bingo and the Little Woman\\", Glossop corroborates a claim that Bertie is mentally unsound. These stories appear in The Inimitable Jeeves.Cawthorne (2013), pp. 56‚Äì57, 66. He forbids the marriage between Bertie's friend Charles \\"Biffy\\" Biffen and his daughter Honoria in \\"The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy\\", much to Biffy's relief. He also appears in \\"Without the Option\\". Both stories are collected in Carry On, Jeeves.Cawthorne (2013), pp. 67, 70. In \\"Jeeves and the Yule-tide Spirit\\" (in Very Good, Jeeves), he is the unintended victim of a prank when Bertie punctures his hot water bottle. In this story, Glossop mentions that he is nervous about fires.Garrison (1991), p. 82. In Thank You, Jeeves, he has been a widower for two years, and wants to marry Myrtle, Lady Chuffnell. Glossop obtains the use of Chuffnell Hall as a clinic, funded by J. Washburn Stoker. In Jeeves in the Offing, he pretends to be a butler at Brinkley Court named Swordfish (the name being suggested by Bobbie Wickham) in order to surreptitiously observe one of the guests, Wilbert Cream, and judge his sanity. It is also stated in this novel that Glossop still runs the clinic at Chuffnell Regis, and that Myrtle has become Lady Glossop, suggesting that they are married.Wodehouse (2008) [1960], Jeeves in the Offing, chapter 20, p. 190. Glossop is mentioned in the last Jeeves short story, \\"Jeeves and the Greasy Bird\\". Outside the Jeeves canon, Glossop appears in the Blandings Castle and Uncle Fred novel, Uncle Fred in the Springtime, in which he is impersonated by Pongo Twistleton's Uncle Fred at Blandings Castle. In Cocktail Time, he is a member of the Demosthenes Club, which is situated immediately opposite the Drones Club, and is briefly seen at the Demosthenes. =Relationship with Bertie Wooster= Though they are not friendly towards each other in the early stories, Glossop bonds with Bertie in Thank You, Jeeves (1934) when they both have to endure going about the countryside wearing blackface. As Bertie tells Jeeves, \\"From now on, there will always be a knife and fork for Bertram at the Glossop lair, and the same for Roddy chez Bertram\\".Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Thank You, Jeeves, chapter 17, p. 208. Inconsistencies in the relationship between Bertie and Glossop arise in the later novel Jeeves in the Offing (1960), as they do not seem to be on terms of friendship in the beginning of the story. When Bertie learns his Aunt Dahlia is going to have lunch with Glossop, Bertie states that Glossop \\"was a man I would not have cared to lunch with myself\\".Wodehouse (2008) [1960], Jeeves in the Offing, chapter 1, p. 8. However, they become friends in Jeeves in the Offing, after they bond over their realization that they each stole biscuits from the school headmaster's study as children. They start addressing each other as \\"Bertie\\" and \\"Roddy\\".Wodehouse (2008) [1960], Jeeves in the Offing, chapter 10, p. 104. Notably, in the 1965 short story \\"Jeeves and the Greasy Bird\\", Bertie tells Jeeves that he and \\"Roddy\\" are good friends, citing the ordeals they shared in Thank You, Jeeves.Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Thank You, Jeeves, chapter 1, p. 8. Sir Roderick has not yet married Lady Chuffnell in this story. To explain why Bertie and Sir Roderick are not already friends at the start of Jeeves in the Offing, Wodehouse scholar J. H. C. Morris suggested that Bertie and Sir Roderick had an undisclosed quarrel sometime after Thank You, Jeeves and before Jeeves in the Offing, implying that \\"Jeeves and the Greasy Bird\\" occurs before this quarrel. Bertie continues to regard Sir Roderick Glossop as a friend in Much Obliged, Jeeves (1971). He describes \\"Roddy\\" as one of his leading pals.Wodehouse (2008) [1971], Much Obliged, Jeeves, chapter 6, p. 59. He is also mentioned in chapter 12.

Jahrhunderts. 1939 edition The Myth of the Twentieth Century () is a 1930 book by Alfred Rosenberg, one of the principal ideologues of the Nazi Party and editor of the Nazi paper V√∂lkischer Beobachter. The titular \\"myth\\" (in the special Sorelian sense) is \\"the myth of blood, which under the sign of the swastika unchains the racial world-revolution. It is the awakening of the race-soul, which after long sleep victoriously ends the race chaos.\\"Quoted in Viereck, 2003, p. 229. The book has been described as \\"one of the two great unread bestsellers of the Third Reich\\" (the other being Mein Kampf).Robert E. Conot, Justice at Nuremberg, New York: Harper and Row, 1983, p. 216. In private Adolf Hitler said: \\"I must insist that Rosenberg's The Myth of the Twentieth Century is not to be regarded as an expression of the official doctrine of the party.\\"Hitler, Adolf; Hugh-Trevor Roper. Adolf Hitler's Secret Conversations 1941-1944, p. 400. Hitler objected to Rosenberg's paganism.Roger Griffin. Fascism, Totalitarianism and Political Religion. Oxon, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2005. p. 85. Hitler awarded the first State Prize for Art and Science to the author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century. The official document accompanying the prize \\"expressly praises Rosenberg as a 'person who has, in a scientific and penetrating manner, laid the firm foundation for an understanding of the ideological bases of National Socialism.'\\"The Persecution of the Catholic Church in the Third Reich: Facts and Documents Rosenberg's influences Rosenberg was inspired by the theories of Arthur de Gobineau, in his 1853‚Äì1855 book An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races,Snyder, Louis L. (1939). \\"Gobinism: The 'Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races',\\" in Race: A History of Ethnic Theories. New York: Longmans, Green & Co., pp. 114-130. and by Houston Stewart Chamberlain. Rosenberg's The Myth of the Twentieth Century was conceived as a sequel to Chamberlain's 1899 book The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century.Yahil, 1991, p. 41. Rosenberg believed that God created mankind as separate, differentiated races in a cascading hierarchy of nobility of virtue, not as separate individuals or as entities with \\"blank slate\\" natures. Rosenberg harshly rejected the idea of a \\"globular\\" mankind of homogeneity of nature as counter-factual, and asserted each biological race possesses a discrete, unique soul, claiming the Caucasoid Aryan race, with Germanic Nordics supposedly composing its vanguard elite, as qualitatively superior, in a vaguely \\"ontological\\" way, in comparison to all other ethnic and racial groupings: the Germanic Nordic Aryan as Platonic ideal of humankind. Other influences included the anti-modernist, \\"revolutionary\\" ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche, Richard Wagner's Holy Grail romanticism inspired by the neo-Buddhist thesis of Arthur Schopenhauer, Haeckelian mystical vitalism, the medieval German philosopher Meister Eckhart and the heirs of his mysticism and Nordicist Aryanism in general. Outline of contents of the book Rosenberg's racial interpretation of history concentrates on the negative influence of the Jewish race in contrast to the Aryan race. He equates the latter with the Nordic peoples of northern Europe and also includes the Berbers from North Africa and the upper classes of Ancient Egypt.\\"The Berbers, among whom even today one finds light skins and blue eyes, do not go back to the Vandal invasions of the fifth century A.D., but to the prehistoric Atlantic Nordic human wave. The Kabyle huntsmen, for example, are to no small degree still wholly Nordic, thus the blond Berbers in the region of Constantine form 10% of the population; at Djebel Sheshor they are even more numerous\\", Alfred Rosenberg, The Myth of the Twentieth Century (1930), Hrp, 2004, p. 6 According to Rosenberg, modern culture has been corrupted by Semitic influences (cf. anti-Semitism), which have produced degenerate modern art, along with moral and social degeneration. In contrast, Aryan culture is defined by innate moral sensibility and an energetic will to power. Rosenberg believed that the higher races must rule over the lower and not interbreed with them, because cross-breeding destroys the divine combination of physical heredity and spirit. He uses an organic metaphor of the race and the State and argues that the Nazis must purify the race soul by eliminating non-Aryan elements in much the same ruthless and uncompromising way in which a surgeon would cut a cancer from a diseased body. In Rosenberg's view of world history, migrating Aryans founded various ancient civilizations which later declined and fell due to inter-marriage with lesser races. These civilizations included the Indo-Aryan civilization, ancient Persia, Greece, and Rome. He saw the ancient Germanic invasions of the Roman empire as \\"saving\\" its civilization, which had been corrupted both by race mixing and by \\"Judaized-cosmopolitan\\" Christianity. Furthermore, he claimed that the persecutions of Protestants in France and other areas represented the wiping out of the last remnants of the Aryan element in those areas, a process completed by the French revolution. In contemporary Europe, he saw the northern areas that embraced Protestantism as closest to the Aryan racial and spiritual ideal. Following H. S. Chamberlain and other v√∂lkisch theorists, he believed that Jesus was an Aryan (specifically an Amorite or Hurrian Hittite), and that original Christianity was an \\"Aryan\\" (Iranian) religion, but had been corrupted by the followers of Paul of Tarsus. The \\"Mythus\\" is very anti-Catholic, seeing the Church's cosmopolitanism and \\"Judaized\\" version of Christianity as one of the factors in Germany's spiritual bondage. Rosenberg particularly emphasizes the anti- Judaic teachings of the heresies Marcionism and \\"Aryo-Persian\\" Manicheanism as more representative of the true, \\"anti-Judaic\\" Jesus Christ and more suited to the Nordic world-view. Rosenberg saw Martin Luther and the Reformation as an important step forward toward reasserting the \\"Aryan spirit\\", but as ultimately ambiguous in not having gone far enough in its founding of just another dogmatic church. When he discussed the future of religion in the future Reich, he suggested that a multiplicity of forms be tolerated, including \\"positive Christianity\\", neo-paganism, and a form of \\"purified\\" Aryan Hinduism. He saw all these religious systems as allegorical after the manner of Schopenhauer's teaching of religion as \\"folk-metaphysics\\", and was skeptical that the Nordic gods, of which the keys of interpretation had been largely lost in involutive time, could gain a foothold in modern times, without even conceding the desirability of the possibility. Another myth, to which he gave \\"allegorical\\" and esoteric credence, was the hermetical idea of Atlantis, which he felt might preserve a memory of an ancient Aryan homeland: > And so today the long derived hypothesis becomes a probability, namely that > from a northern centre of creation which, without postulating an actual > submerged Atlantic continent, we may call Atlantis, swarms of warriors once > fanned out in obedience to the ever renewed and incarnate Nordic longing for > distance to conquer and space to shape. This account of world history is used to support his dualistic model of human experience, as are ideas co-opted from Nietzsche and Social Darwinist writers of the era. Influence of the book Thanks to Nazi support, the book had sold more than one million copies by 1944. However, Adolf Hitler declared that it was not to be considered official ideology of the Nazi Party: According to journalist Konrad Heiden, Rosenberg had given the manuscript to Hitler to vet before its publication. After a year Hitler still had nothing to say. Hitler gave the still-unread work back to him saying, \\"I feel sure that it's all right.\\"Feliks Gross, European Ideologies: A Survey of 20th Century Political Ideas, Philosophical Library, New York, 1948, p.773. In his diary Joseph Goebbels called the book \\"very good\\" when he first read it.Irving Hexham, \\"Inventing ‚ÄòPaganists‚Äô: a Close Reading of Richard Steigmann-Gall's the Holy Reich\\", Journal of Contemporary History, January 2007 42: 59-78 Albert Speer however remembered that Goebbels mocked Alfred Rosenberg.Albert Speer, Erinnerungen, Frankfurt am Main / Berlin / Wien 1969, p. 139 Goebbels also called the book a \\"philosophical belch\\".Goebbels, Ralf Georg Reuth; Piper; , p. 304; Original: \\"philosophischer R√ºlpser\\".Eatwell, 1995, p. 119. Hermann G√∂ring said: \\"if Rosenberg was to decide ... we would only have rite, thing, myth and such kind of swindle.\\"Goebbels, Ralf Georg Reuth; Piper; , p. 304; Original: \\"... [wenn Rosenberg das Sagen h√§tte] ... g√§be es nur noch Kult, Thing, Mythos und √§hnlichen Schwindel\\". Gustave Gilbert, the prison psychologist during the Nuremberg Trials, reported that none of the Nazi leaders he interviewed had read Rosenberg's writings.Michael, Robert. Holy Hatred: Christianity, Antisemitism, and the Holocaust. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, p. 177. Its overt statement of anti-Christian sentiment made it difficult to give Rosenberg any position of prominence when the Nazis ascended to power.Robert Cecil, The Myth of the Master Race: Alfred Rosenberg and Nazi Ideology p.105 Even in their stronghold Hamburg only 0.49% of the inhabitants identified as belonging to the anti-Christian neopagan faith movement (in 1937),Theologische Realenzyklop√§die, Volume 8. Page 556. Gruyter Verlag, 1993. whereas the German Christians and their Positive Christianity had a strong standing. Many of the attacks on the book after its 1930 publication came from its explicit anti-Christian message. Rosenberg wrote two supplements to the work, replying to Catholic and Protestant critics. In the first, On the Dark Men of Our Times: A Reply to Critics of the Myth of the Twentieth Century, he accused Catholics of attempting to destroy the national character by promoting separatism within Catholic parts of the country.Richard Steigmann-Gall, The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity, 1919-1945, p.128. His second reply, Protestant Pilgrims to Rome: The Treason Against Luther and the Myth of the Twentieth Century, argued that modern Lutheranism was becoming too close to Catholicism.

Zuiderhofje regent's room. Zuiderhofje entranceway to garden. The Zuiderhofje is a hofje in Haarlem, Netherlands. History Former Mennonite orphanage on the Klein Heiligland, nr. 58. The keystone is new, and the original is in the Doopsgezinde kerk, Haarlem. The hofje was founded in 1640 by Jacques van Damme and his wife Elisabeth Blinckvliedt, and is owned by the Mennonite church of Haarlem. The couple gave an order to Michael Slaghreegen on the 25th of February 1640, to purchase a house on the Zuiderstraat and build a few houses there for elderly women of the Vlaemsche Block, the largest branch of Mennonites in Haarlem at that time. This branch was primarily Flemish in origin, and their church De Olijblock was located on the Klein Heiligland street, near their orphanage, Het Doopsgezinde Weeshuis. The orphanage archives date back to 1634, and its location adjoined the former hofje Blokshofje, that can still be seen, but was sold by the Mennonite church in 1970. A commemorative plaque on the front explains the history of that house. Mennonites of Haarlem This hofje is one of four Mennonite hofjes in Haarlem; the others are the Wijnbergshofje in the Barrevoetestraat, the Bruiningshofje on the Botermarkt, and the Blokshofje on the Klein Heiligland sold in 1970. This is not counting the Teylers Hofje, though its founder was Mennonite and its former location had also been a Mennonite hofje. Considering the fact that the Mennonite community was never more than 5% of the Haarlem population, it is unusual that they have always been in the majority among the regents of Haarlem hofjes. The reason is that the Mennonites in Haarlem ran a quarter of all charity work for centuries in Haarlem, until government control slowly took over in the 20th century. The Haarlem archives mention the followers of Zwingli as far back as 1530. The Frisian preacher Menno Simons was not the founder of this faith, but a later leader. This is why the Dutch Mennonites don't call themselves Mennonites, but Doopsgezind, or Anabaptist. Each Doopsgezind group is autonomous. The main rules of the faith in 1640 were: * Refusal to baptise children until the age of 18 * Refusal to take vows or swear oaths * Refusal to carry arms Many Haarlem Mennonites were Flemish immigrants from Menen, in Belgium, who came for the linen trade, but there was also a large group who came from Friesland, and friction between these groups was common. Since most men of influence in Haarlem at that time were members of the schutterij, the only way for influential men of the Mennonite community to advance themselves socially was through social work and cultural donations. Officially, the Mennonite faith was only tolerated, and not recognized by the Haarlem city council. The Mennonite churches were underground, but its members could move freely in society, just as the Catholics could do after the Protestant Reformation of 1572. The only difference was that they had to pay wachtgeld to avoid the schutterij militia service. The Flemish Mennonites were the strictest followers of their faith. In 1598 a scandal over a bankruptcy caused a schism in the Haarlem Mennonite church, and in 1620 a controversy arose over the question whether a man could fondle his betrothed's breast before marriage. This question split the church, so that at the time of the Hofje's founding, there were 5 Mennonite groups in Haarlem. All of these communities were known for their shunning of members who broke the rules. Elisabeth Blinkvliedt After her husband's death in 1642, Elisabeth Blinkvliedt decided to write up a codicil to their bequest of the hofje. Knowing her church well, she stipulated that the hofje regents could act as they saw fit, without any influence of the Mennonite church except that the regents should be members of it. The appointing of regents was only to be done by the current sitting regents, and the business of the hofje was to have no communion with the business of the Mennonite church. She then appointed the sitting group of regents, and these were * Michael Slaghreegen * Pieter Joosten Bogaert (he was also the founder of the original hofje in the now Vrouwe- en Antonie Gasthuys hofje) * Dirk de Wale * J. de Graeff She then added a new house and garden to the complex in 1644, and as though this wasn't enough, she also added a new house and garden to the Bruiningshofje in 1647. In the archives of the Bruiningshofje a sum of 150 Carolus guldens is recorded for this purpose, received from Lysbeth van Blenckvliet.J.C. Dirks, Het Bruinings Hofje op de Botermarkt te Haarlem, 1940, De Erven F. Bohn, Haarlem In 1649 she wrote a Memorie, or memoir, in which she asks the regents of this hofje to do a few more things for her after her death. Thanks to this paper we know that she and her husband were the founders of the above-mentioned orphanage in the 1630s, and in her memoir she echoes her stipulation for the hofje that the orphanage should be completely self- supporting, with no interference by the Mennonite church. Her gifts on her death were quite substantial, and are the reason that the hofje was to last for so many centuries, despite later upheavals in the Haarlem Mennonite community. Effects of schisms in the church In 1672 the Haarlem Mennonite community was split in two and the Zuiderhofje had to give up a third of its wealth to the Gemeente van Vollenhove. In 1683 the Vlaemsche Block, now merged with the Waterlandsche Gemeente, moved to a new church building in the Frankestraat, where the Haarlem Mennonite community still resides today. In 1685 the hofje was appointed new regents from this united church, which was directly against the wishes of Elisabeth Blinckvliedt. In 1714 this was declared illegal, but in 1716 a final decision was made to allow the church to appoint the regents, and the hofje was declared the property of the church. In 1749 the Mennonite communities rejoined and the old property rights were restored, except that the church kept its (illegal) governance. In 1782 the regents wrote a letter to the church to complain. The church protested that it had made donations to the hofje since 1685. Finally, in 1784, a decision was made to allow the various Mennonite hofjes to exist independently of each other, and independently of the church. The hofjes mentioned were the Winbergshofje and the Zuiderhofje. Restoration activities After a glorious period in the 18th and early 19th centuries, thanks to rich donations by regents, the hofje slowly declined. In 1887 the first discussions about restoration began and in 1891 the hofje was completely torn down and rebuilt. In 1892 the elderly women returned to their new homes after a year of living elsewhere. The hofje, together with the Hofje van Gratie, was threatened with destruction in the 1960s when the library was built (located in the old stadsdoelen, or target practise for the city schutterij). In the end only the Hofje van Gratie was torn down. This hofje now stands as an island among newer buildings. The hofje is for single, senior women.

Biography She was born in 1910 in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia to English parents, as Hilda Kay. She attended Yarmouth Academy and later studied at the Grand Central School of Art in New York. During the Second World War, she worked as a secretary in Montreal and Toronto, and in 1945 married fellow Nova Scotian Joseph Howe Grant, a professional engineer. Together they lived first in Toronto and later in Kleinburg north of the city. She disliked being called Hilda and was known to all by her maiden name of Kay. During her years in Toronto, she was an active member of both the Heliconian Club and the Canadian Authors' Association, and a mentor to many writers and painters. When the American publishing firm of Abelard-Schuman had a Canadian subsidiary, she was its fiction editor and oversaw many Canadian writers into print. Grant published her first book, The Salt Box, in her 40s and continued writing for less than twenty years. Written under the pseudonym Jan Hilliard, The Salt Box won the prestigious Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour in 1952. The Salt Box was followed by A View of the Town. Miranda and The Jameson Girls were both novels of reminiscence, the latter about the family of a dying rum-runner, which caused some controversy in her hometown. Dove Cottage was based on the author's own house outside the city, and Morgan's Castle was set in the fictitious village of Greenwood in the Niagara Peninsula of Ontario. As The New York Times wrote at the time, \\"Few such credible and practical murderers have flourished in fiction. Miss Hilliard persuades one that they are commoner in life‚Ä¶ [she] writes a sure sense of atmosphere\\". Morgan's Castle was Grant's last novel, although she published three subsequent works of non-fiction under her own name. Robert Stevenson, engineer and sea-builder, was a biography of the lighthouse builder and grandfather of Robert Louis Stevenson. She received a Canadian Centennial Commission grant to research and write Samuel Cunard, Pioneer of the Atlantic Steamship, and was a Canada Council Award recipient. She also published short stories and poetry in such magazines as Maclean's, Chatelaine and Canadian Poetry. A lifelong gardener, even when limited to a balcony in her later years, she co-authored Small City Gardens with William S. Brett in 1967. She soon left writing forever, returning to her first artistic interest of painting, and in her later years was recognized as an accomplished watercolorist. She often supplied illustrations for her own books. She died on May 11, 1996 at her home in Toronto and her cremated remains were interred in the Grant family plot in Riverside Cemetery in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia.

The contacts between the two proteins are shown as coloured patches. Protein‚Äìprotein interactions (PPIs) are physical contacts of high specificity established between two or more protein molecules as a result of biochemical events steered by interactions that include electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic effect. Many are physical contacts with molecular associations between chains that occur in a cell or in a living organism in a specific biomolecular context. Proteins rarely act alone as their functions tend to be regulated. Many molecular processes within a cell are carried out by molecular machines that are built from numerous protein components organized by their PPIs. These physiological interactions make up the so- called interactomics of the organism, while aberrant PPIs are the basis of multiple aggregation-related diseases, such as Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob and Alzheimer's diseases. PPIs have been studied with many methods and from different perspectives: biochemistry, quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics, signal transduction, among others. All this information enables the creation of large protein interaction networks ‚Äì similar to metabolic or genetic/epigenetic networks ‚Äì that empower the current knowledge on biochemical cascades and molecular etiology of disease, as well as the discovery of putative protein targets of therapeutic interest.  Examples  =Electron transfer proteins= In many metabolic reactions, a protein that acts as an electron carrier binds to an enzyme that acts its reductase. After it receives an electron, it dissociates and then binds to the next enzyme that acts its oxidase (i.e. an acceptor of the electron). These interactions between proteins are dependent on highly specific binding between proteins to ensure efficient electron transfer. Examples: mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation chain system components cytochrome c-reductase / cytochrome c / cytochrome c oxidase; microsomal and mitochondrial P450 systems. In the case of the mitochondrial P450 systems, the specific residues involved in the binding of the electron transfer protein adrenodoxin to its reductase were identified as two basic Arg residues on the surface of the reductase and two acidic Asp residues on the adrenodoxin. More recent work on the phylogeny of the reductase has shown that these residues involved in protein-protein interactions have been conserved throughout the evolution of this enzyme. =Signal transduction= The activity of the cell is regulated by extracellular signals. Signal propagation inside and/or along the interior of cells depends on PPIs between the various signaling molecules. The recruitment of signaling pathways through PPIs is called signal transduction and plays a fundamental role in many biological processes and in many diseases including Parkinson's disease and cancer. =Membrane transport= A protein may be carrying another protein (for example, from cytoplasm to nucleus or vice versa in the case of the nuclear pore importins). =Cell metabolism= In many biosynthetic processes enzymes interact with each other to produce small compounds or other macromolecules. =Muscle contraction= Physiology of muscle contraction involves several interactions. Myosin filaments act as molecular motors and by binding to actin enables filament sliding. Furthermore, members of the skeletal muscle lipid droplet-associated proteins family associate with other proteins, as activator of adipose triglyceride lipase and its coactivator comparative gene identification-58, to regulate lipolysis in skeletal muscle  Types  To describe the types of protein‚Äìprotein interactions (PPIs) it is important to consider that proteins can interact in a \\"transient\\" way (to produce some specific effect in a short time, like a signal transduction) or to interact with other proteins in a \\"stable\\" way to form complexes that become molecular machines within the living systems. A protein complex assembly can result in the formation of homo-oligomeric or hetero-oligomeric complexes. In addition to the conventional complexes, as enzyme-inhibitor and antibody-antigen, interactions can also be established between domain-domain and domain-peptide. Another important distinction to identify protein-protein interactions is the way they have been determined, since there are techniques that measure direct physical interactions between protein pairs, named ‚Äúbinary‚Äù methods, while there are other techniques that measure physical interactions among groups of proteins, without pairwise determination of protein partners, named ‚Äúco-complex‚Äù methods. = Homo-oligomers vs. hetero-oligomers = Homo-oligomers are macromolecular complexes constituted by only one type of protein subunit. Protein subunits assembly is guided by the establishment of non-covalent interactions in the quaternary structure of the protein. Disruption of homo- oligomers in order to return to the initial individual monomers often requires denaturation of the complex. Several enzymes, carrier proteins, scaffolding proteins, and transcriptional regulatory factors carry out their functions as homo-oligomers. Distinct protein subunits interact in hetero-oligomers, which are essential to control several cellular functions. The importance of the communication between heterologous proteins is even more evident during cell signaling events and such interactions are only possible due to structural domains within the proteins (as described below). = Stable interactions vs. transient interactions = Stable interactions involve proteins that interact for a long time, taking part of permanent complexes as subunits, in order to carry out functional roles. These are usually the case of homo-oligomers (e.g. cytochrome c), and some hetero-oligomeric proteins, as the subunits of ATPase. On the other hand, a protein may interact briefly and in a reversible manner with other proteins in only certain cellular contexts ‚Äì cell type, cell cycle stage, external factors, presence of other binding proteins, etc. ‚Äì as it happens with most of the proteins involved in biochemical cascades. These are called transient interactions. For example, some G protein-coupled receptors only transiently bind to Gi/o proteins when they are activated by extracellular ligands, while some Gq-coupled receptors, such as muscarinic receptor M3, pre-couple with Gq proteins prior to the receptor-ligand binding. Interactions between intrinsically disordered protein regions to globular protein domains (i.e. MoRFs) are transient interactions. =Covalent vs. non- covalent= Covalent interactions are those with the strongest association and are formed by disulphide bonds or electron sharing. While rare, these interactions are determinant in some posttranslational modifications, as ubiquitination and SUMOylation. Non-covalent bonds are usually established during transient interactions by the combination of weaker bonds, such as hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, Van der Waals forces, or hydrophobic bonds. =Role of water= Water molecules play a significant role in the interactions between proteins. The crystal structures of complexes, obtained at high resolution from different but homologous proteins, have shown that some interface water molecules are conserved between homologous complexes. The majority of the interface water molecules make hydrogen bonds with both partners of each complex. Some interface amino acid residues or atomic groups of one protein partner engage in both direct and water mediated interactions with the other protein partner. Doubly indirect interactions, mediated by two water molecules, are more numerous in the homologous complexes of low affinity. Carefully conducted mutagenesis experiments, e.g. changing a tyrosine residue into a phenylalanine, have shown that water mediated interactions can contribute to the energy of interaction. Thus, water molecules may facilitate the interactions and cross-recognitions between proteins.  Structure  Crystal structure of modified Gramicidin S horizontally determined by X-ray crystallography NMR structure of cytochrome C illustrating its dynamics in solution The molecular structures of many protein complexes have been unlocked by the technique of X-ray crystallography. The first structure to be solved by this method was that of sperm whale myoglobin by Sir John Cowdery Kendrew. In this technique the angles and intensities of a beam of X-rays diffracted by crystalline atoms are detected in a film, thus producing a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal. Later, nuclear magnetic resonance also started to be applied with the aim of unravelling the molecular structure of protein complexes. One of the first examples was the structure of calmodulin-binding domains bound to calmodulin. This technique is based on the study of magnetic properties of atomic nuclei, thus determining physical and chemical properties of the correspondent atoms or the molecules. Nuclear magnetic resonance is advantageous for characterizing weak PPIs. = Domains = Proteins hold structural domains that allow their interaction with and bind to specific sequences on other proteins: * Src homology 2 (SH2) domain :SH2 domains are structurally composed by three-stranded twisted beta sheet sandwiched flanked by two alpha-helices. The existence of a deep binding pocket with high affinity for phosphotyrosine, but not for phosphoserine or phosphothreonine, is essential for the recognition of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, mainly autophosphorylated growth factor receptors. Growth factor receptor binding proteins and phospholipase CŒ≥ are examples of proteins that have SH2 domains. * Src homology 3 (SH3) domain :Structurally, SH3 domains are constituted by a beta barrel formed by two orthogonal beta sheets and three anti-parallel beta strands. These domains recognize proline enriched sequences, as polyproline type II helical structure (PXXP motifs) in cell signaling proteins like protein tyrosine kinases and the growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (Grb2). * Phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain :PTB domains interact with sequences that contain a phosphotyrosine group. These domains can be found in the insulin receptor substrate. * LIM domain :LIM domains were initially identified in three homeodomain transcription factors (lin11, is11, and mec3). In addition to this homeodomain proteins and other proteins involved in development, LIM domains have also been identified in non-homeodomain proteins with relevant roles in cellular differentiation, association with cytoskeleton and senescence. These domains contain a tandem cysteine-rich Zn2+-finger motif and embrace the consensus sequence CX2CX16-23HX2CX2CX2CX16-21CX2C/H/D. LIM domains bind to PDZ domains, bHLH transcription factors, and other LIM domains. * Sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain :SAM domains are composed by five helices forming a compact package with a conserved hydrophobic core. These domains, which can be found in the Eph receptor and the stromal interaction molecule (STIM) for example, bind to non-SAM domain-containing proteins and they also appear to have the ability to bind RNA. * PDZ domain :PDZ domains were first identified in three guanylate kinases: PSD-95, DlgA and ZO-1. These domains recognize carboxy-terminal tri-peptide motifs (S/TXV), other PDZ domains or LIM domains and bind them through a short peptide sequence that has a C-terminal hydrophobic residue. Some of the proteins identified as having PDZ domains are scaffolding proteins or seem to be involved in ion receptor assembling and receptor-enzyme complexes formation. * FERM domain :FERM domains contain basic residues capable of binding PtdIns(4,5)P2. Talin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) are two of the proteins that present FERM domains. * Calponin homology (CH) domain :CH domains are mainly present in cytoskeletal proteins as parvin. * Pleckstrin homology domain :Pleckstrin homology domains bind to phosphoinositides and acid domains in signaling proteins. * WW domain :WW domains bind to proline enriched sequences. * WSxWS motif :Found in cytokine receptors Properties of the interface The study of the molecular structure can give fine details about the interface that enables the interaction between proteins. When characterizing PPI interfaces it is important to take into account the type of complex. Parameters evaluated include size (measured in absolute dimensions √Ö2 or in solvent-accessible surface area (SASA)), shape, complementarity between surfaces, residue interface propensities, hydrophobicity, segmentation and secondary structure, and conformational changes on complex formation. The great majority of PPI interfaces reflects the composition of protein surfaces, rather than the protein cores, in spite of being frequently enriched in hydrophobic residues, particularly in aromatic residues. PPI interfaces are dynamic and frequently planar, although they can be globular and protruding as well. Based on three structures ‚Äì insulin dimer, trypsin-pancreatic trypsin inhibitor complex, and oxyhaemoglobin ‚Äì Cyrus Chothia and Joel Janin found that between 1,130 and 1,720 √Ö2 of surface area was removed from contact with water indicating that hydrophobicity is a major factor of stabilization of PPIs. Later studies refined the buried surface area of the majority of interactions to 1,600¬±350 √Ö2. However, much larger interaction interfaces were also observed and were associated with significant changes in conformation of one of the interaction partners. PPIs interfaces exhibit both shape and electrostatic complementarity.  Regulation  * Protein concentration, which in turn are affected by expression levels and degradation rates; * Protein affinity for proteins or other binding ligands; * Ligands concentrations (substrates, ions, etc.); * Presence of other proteins, nucleic acids, and ions; * Electric fields around proteins. * Occurrence of covalent modifications;  Experimental Methods  There are a multitude of methods to detect them. Each of the approaches has its own strengths and weaknesses, especially with regard to the sensitivity and specificity of the method. The most conventional and widely used high-throughput methods are yeast two-hybrid screening and affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry. Principles of yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems =Yeast two-hybrid screening= This system was firstly described in 1989 by Fields and Song using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as biological model. Yeast two hybrid allows the identification of pairwise PPIs (binary method) in vivo, in which the two proteins are tested for biophysically direct interaction. The Y2H is based on the functional reconstitution of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and subsequent activation of a selective reporter such as His3. To test two proteins for interaction, two protein expression constructs are made: one protein (X) is fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DB) and a second protein (Y) is fused to the Gal4 activation domain (AD). In the assay, yeast cells are transformed with these constructs. Transcription of reporter genes does not occur unless bait (DB-X) and prey (AD-Y) interact with each other and form a functional Gal4 transcription factor. Thus, the interaction between proteins can be inferred by the presence of the products resultant of the reporter gene expression. In cases in which the reporter gene expresses enzymes that allow the yeast to synthesize essential amino acids or nucleotides, yeast growth under selective media conditions indicates that the two proteins tested are interacting. Despite its usefulness, the yeast two-hybrid system has limitations. It uses yeast as main host system, which can be a problem when studying proteins that contain mammalian-specific post-translational modifications. The number of PPIs identified is usually low because of a high false negative rate; and, understates membrane proteins, for example. In initial studies that utilized Y2H, proper controls for false positives (e.g. when DB-X activates the reporter gene without the presence of AD-Y) were frequently not done, leading to a higher than normal false positive rate. An empirical framework must be implemented to control for these false positives. Limitations in lower coverage of membrane proteins have been overcoming by the emergence of yeast two-hybrid variants, such as the membrane yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) and the split-ubiquitin system, which are not limited to interactions that occur in the nucleus; and, the bacterial two-hybrid system, performed in bacteria; Principle of tandem affinity purification =Affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry= Affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry mostly detects stable interactions and thus better indicates functional in vivo PPIs. This method starts by purification of the tagged protein, which is expressed in the cell usually at in vivo concentrations, and its interacting proteins (affinity purification). One of the most advantageous and widely used method to purify proteins with very low contaminating background is the tandem affinity purification, developed by Bertrand Seraphin and Matthias Mann and respective colleagues. PPIs can then be quantitatively and qualitatively analysed by mass spectrometry using different methods: chemical incorporation, biological or metabolic incorporation (SILAC), and label-free methods. Furthermore, network theory has been used to study the whole set of identified protein-protein interactions in cells. =Nucleic acid programmable protein array= This system was first developed by LaBaer and colleagues in 2004 by using in vitro transcription and translation system. They use DNA template encoding the gene of interest fused with GST protein, and it was immobilized in the solid surface. Anti-GST antibody and biotinylated plasmid DNA were bounded in aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES)-coated slide. BSA can improve the binding efficiency of DNA. Biotinylated plasmid DNA was bound by avidin. New protein was synthesized by using cell-free expression system i.e. rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL), and then the new protein was captured through anti-GST antibody bounded on the slide. To test protein-protein interaction, the targeted protein cDNA and query protein cDNA were immobilized in a same coated slide. By using in vitro transcription and translation system, targeted and query protein was synthesized by the same extract. The targeted protein was bound to array by antibody coated in the slide and query protein was used to probe the array. The query protein was tagged with hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. Thus, the interaction between the two proteins was visualized with the antibody against HA. =Other potential methods= Diverse techniques to identify PPIs have been emerging along with technology progression. These include co- immunoprecipitation, protein microarrays, analytical ultracentrifugation, light scattering, fluorescence spectroscopy, luminescence-based mammalian interactome mapping (LUMIER), resonance-energy transfer systems, mammalian protein‚Äìprotein interaction trap, electro-switchable biosurfaces, protein- fragment complementation assay, as well as real-time label-free measurements by surface plasmon resonance, and calorimetry.  Computational methods  =Computational Prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions= The experimental detection and characterization of PPIs is labor-intensive and time-consuming. However, many PPIs can be also predicted computationally, usually using experimental data as a starting point. However, methods have also been developed that allow the prediction of PPI de novo, that is without prior evidence for these interactions.  Genomic Context Methods  The Rosetta Stone or Domain Fusion method is based on the hypothesis that interacting proteins are sometimes fused into a single protein in another genome. Therefore, we can predict if two proteins may be interacting by determining if they each have non-overlapping sequence similarity to a region of a single protein sequence in another genome. The Conserved Neighborhood method is based on the hypothesis that if genes encoding two proteins are neighbors on a chromosome in many genomes, then they are likely functionally related (and possibly physically interacting). The Phylogenetic Profile method is based on the hypothesis that if two or more proteins are concurrently present or absent across several genomes, then they are likely functionally related. Therefore, potentially interacting proteins can be identified by determining the presence or absence of genes across many genomes and selecting those genes which are always present or absent together. =Text mining methods= Text mining protocol. Publicly available information from biomedical documents is readily accessible through the internet and is becoming a powerful resource for collecting known protein-protein interactions (PPIs), PPI prediction and protein docking. Text mining is much less costly and time-consuming compared to other high-throughput techniques. Currently, text mining methods generally detect binary relations between interacting proteins from individual sentences using rule/pattern-based information extraction and machine learning approaches. A wide variety of text mining applications for PPI extraction and/or prediction are available for public use, as well as repositories which often store manually validated and/or computationally predicted PPIs. Text mining can be implemented in two stages: information retrieval, where texts containing names of either or both interacting proteins are retrieved and information extraction, where targeted information (interacting proteins, implicated residues, interaction types, etc.) is extracted. There are also studies using phylogenetic profiling, basing their functionalities on the theory that proteins involved in common pathways co-evolve in a correlated fashion across species. Some more complex text mining methodologies use advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and build knowledge networks (for example, considering gene names as nodes and verbs as edges). Other developments involve kernel methods to predict protein interactions. =Machine learning methods= These methods use machine learning to distinguish how interacting protein pairs differ from non- interacting protein pairs in terms of pairwise features such as cellular colocalization, gene co-expression, how closely located on a DNA are the genes that encode the two proteins, and so on. Random Forest has been found to be most-effective machine learning method for protein interaction prediction. Such methods have been applied for discovering protein interactions on human interactome, specifically the interactome of Membrane proteins and the interactome of Schizophrenia-associated proteins.  Databases  Large scale identification of PPIs generated hundreds of thousands of interactions, which were collected together in specialized biological databases that are continuously updated in order to provide complete interactomes. The first of these databases was the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP). Since that time, the number of public databases has been increasing. Databases can be subdivided into primary databases, meta-databases, and prediction databases. Primary databases collect information about published PPIs proven to exist via small-scale or large-scale experimental methods. Examples: DIP, Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND), Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID), Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD), IntAct Molecular Interaction Database, Molecular Interactions Database (MINT), MIPS Protein Interaction Resource on Yeast (MIPS-MPact), and MIPS Mammalian Protein‚ÄìProtein Interaction Database (MIPS-MPPI). Meta-databases normally result from the integration of primary databases information, but can also collect some original data. Examples: Agile Protein Interactomes Dataserver (APID), The Microbial Protein Interaction Database (MPIDB), Protein Interaction Network Analysis (PINA) platform, (GPS-Prot), and Wiki-Pi. Prediction databases include many PPIs that are predicted using several techniques (main article). Examples: Human Protein‚ÄìProtein Interaction Prediction Database (PIPs), Interlogous Interaction Database (I2D), Known and Predicted Protein‚ÄìProtein Interactions (STRING-db), and Unified Human Interactive (UniHI). The aforementioned computational methods all depend on source databases whose data can be extrapolated to predict novel protein- protein interactions. Coverage differs greatly between databases. In general, primary databases have the fewest total protein interactions recorded as they do not integrate data from multiple other databases, while prediction databases have the most because they include other forms of evidence in addition to experimental. For example, the primary database IntAct has 572,063 interactions, the meta-database APID has 678,000 interactions, and the predictive database STRING has 25,914,693 interactions. However, it is important to note that some of the interactions in the STRING database are only predicted by computational methods such as Genomic Context and not experimentally verified.  Interaction networks  Schizophrenia PPI. Information found in PPIs databases supports the construction of interaction networks. Although the PPI network of a given query protein can be represented in textbooks, diagrams of whole cell PPIs are frankly complex and difficult to generate. One example of a manually produced molecular interaction map is the Kurt Kohn's 1999 map of cell cycle control. Drawing on Kohn's map, Schwikowski et al. in 2000 published a paper on PPIs in yeast, linking 1,548 interacting proteins determined by two-hybrid screening. They used a layered graph drawing method to find an initial placement of the nodes and then improved the layout using a force-based algorithm. Bioinformatic tools have been developed to simplify the difficult task of visualizing molecular interaction networks and complement them with other types of data. For instance, Cytoscape is an open- source software widely used and many plugins are currently available. Pajek software is advantageous for the visualization and analysis of very large networks. Identification of functional modules in PPI networks is an important challenge in bioinformatics. Functional modules means a set of proteins that are highly connected to each other in PPI network. It is almost similar problem as community detection in social networks. There are some methods such as Jactive modules and MoBaS. Jactive modules integrate PPI network and gene expression data where as MoBaS integrate PPI network and Genome Wide association Studies. The awareness of the major roles of PPIs in numerous physiological and pathological processes has been driving the challenge of unravel many interactomes. Examples of published interactomes are the thyroid specific DREAM interactome and the PP1Œ± interactome in human brain. Protein- protein relationships are often the result of multiple types of interactions or are deduced from different approaches, including co-localization, direct interaction, suppressive genetic interaction, additive genetic interaction, physical association, and other associations. = Signed interaction networks = The protein protein interactions are displayed in a signed network that describes what type of interactions that are taking place Protein‚Äìprotein interactions often result in one of the interacting proteins either being 'activated' or 'repressed'. Such effects can be indicated in a PPI network by \\"signs\\" (e.g. \\"activation\\" or \\"inhibition\\"). Although such attributes have been added to networks for a long time,Ideker T., Tan K. & Uetz P. (2005) Visualization and integration of protein-protein interactions. In: Golemis, E. (ed.) Protein-Protein Interactions ‚Äì A Molecular Cloning Manual, 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Vinayagam et al. (2014) coined the term Signed network for them. Signed networks are often expressed by labeling the interaction as either positive or negative. A positive interaction is one where the interaction results in one of the proteins being activated. Conversely a negative interaction indicates that one of the proteins being inactivated. Protein‚Äìprotein interaction networks are often constructed as a result of lab experiments such as yeast two hybrid screens or 'affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometry techniques. However these methods do not provide the layer of information needed in order to determine what type of interaction is present in order to be able to attribute signs to the network diagrams.  RNA interference screens  RNA interference (RNAi) screens (repression of individual proteins between transcription and translation) are one method that can be utilized in the process of providing signs to the protein-protein interactions. Individual proteins are repressed and the resulting phenotypes are analyzed. A correlating phenotypic relationship (i.e. where the inhibition of either of two proteins results in the same phenotype) indicates a positive, or activating relationship. Phenotypes that do not correlate (i.e. where the inhibition of either of two proteins results in two different phenotypes) indicate a negative or inactivating relationship. If protein A is dependent on protein B for activation then the inhibition of either protein A or B will result in a cell losing the service that is provided by protein A and the phenotypes will be the same for the inhibition of either A or B. If, however, protein A is inactivated by protein B then the phenotypes will differ depending on which protein is inhibited (inhibit protein B and it can no longer inactivate protein A leaving A active however inactivate A and there is nothing for B to activate since A is inactive and the phenotype changes). Multiple RNAi screens need to be performed in order to reliably appoint a sign to a given protein- protein interaction. Vinayagam et al. who devised this technique state that a minimum of nine RNAi screens are required with confidence increasing as one carries out more screens.  As therapeutic targets  Modulation of PPI is challenging and is receiving increasing attention by the scientific community. Several properties of PPI such as allosteric sites and hotspots, have been incorporated into drug-design strategies. The relevance of PPI as putative therapeutic targets for the development of new treatments is particularly evident in cancer, with several ongoing clinical trials within this area. The consensus among these promising targets is, nonetheless, denoted in the already available drugs on the market to treat a multitude of diseases. Examples are Tirobifan, inhibitor of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, used as a cardiovascular drug, and Maraviroc, inhibitor of the CCR5-gp120 interaction, used as anti-HIV drug. Recently, Amit Jaiswal and others were able to develop 30 peptides using protein‚Äìprotein interaction studies to inhibit telomerase recruitment towards telomeres.

Rumbeke Castle is situated at an altitude of 25 meters. Although most of the building was built during the Renaissance period, on the site of a far older fortress, it gained some slightly Neoclassical features after its renovation during the 18th century. During those renovations, the adjacent forest, the Sterrebos or the Star Forest, was added to its grounds. The forest was modelled after the Prater park in Vienna. According to legend, Baldwin Iron Arm, Count of Flanders, kidnapped Judith, the daughter of Charles the Bald in 862 in Senlis and brought her to the fortress that used to be at the very location where the present castle now stands. With the intervention of the Pope, the two lovers married in Auxerre, which then resulted in the creation of the County of Flanders. Gate For centuries, the castle was owned by the counts of Thiennes and Limburg Stirum. The castle of Rumbeke suffered damage during the invasion of Flanders by French king Louis XIV, as well as during the French Revolution and in both world wars more than a century later. In fact, during World War I, it was taken over by the Germans and became for a short period of time, the home of Baron Manfred von Richthofen, better known as the Red Baron, who was credited with shooting down 80 enemy aircraft in his brightly painted red airplane. The castle can be seen in the movie That Lucky Touch, a comedy which was partially shot in Rumbeke in 1975, starring Roger Moore and Shelley Winters.

It is noted for developing the Nansen passport which allowed stateless people to travel between countries. It received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1938.  History  The Armenia commission of the League of Nations. From left, on the first row are Georges Carle, Fridtjof Nansen and C.E. Dupuis. In the background are Vidkun Quisling (left) and Pio Le Savio (right). The Office International Nansen pour les R√©fugi√©s was established in 1930 by the League of Nations, shortly after the death of its name patron Fridtjof Nansen to continue his successful work in international aid for refugee. It thus continued the organization in Geneva, Switzerland, founded by Nansen in 1921. The League also provided the administrative expenses for the Nansen Office though only for fees charged for the Nansen passport since its revenues for welfare and relief were obtained from private contributions. The organization was to supply material and political support to refugees. For refugees from the Third Reich or from the civil war-torn Spain, the Nansen aid was not applicable, though many countries refused to accept the refugees. In spite of such problems, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the organization in 1938 for its work, but due to its dissolution shortly afterwards, the prize money was received by a newly founded refugee organization of the League of Nations. The office was dissolved at the same time as the League dissolved the High Commission (established in 1933) because of the problems surrounding German refugees after the dissolution of the Third Reich.

Origins The historian and political scientist Christophe Jaffrelot believes that the Arain are displaced farming communities who moved to Punjab from Sindh and Multan as Arab Muslim armies encroached; they originally practised Hinduism but many later converted to Islam. He says that the community is related to the Kamboj Rajput community mainly located in northern India and eastern Pakistan. Ishtiaq Ahmed, a political scientist who is also a member of the Arain community, acknowledges that some early Arain texts ascribe a Suryavanshi Rajput origin, while others note a Persian one to reflect to others the status of being ‚Äúconquerors‚Äù. He believes that the Arains \\"are a mix of many ethnicities and races\\", similar to other \\"farming castes of the Punjab and Haryana\\". = British Raj period in Colonial India= According to Ahmed, during the Mughal and Sikh periods some Arains held prominent positions, such as governors and army generals; he also believes that numerous names adopted by the community may indicate a tradition of military employment. At the end of the period of governance mostly by the British East India Company, the rebel leaders of the 1857 uprising included Shah Abdul Qadir Ludhianvi, whose actions with fellow Arains were in part why the authorities of the newly-created British Raj subsequently considered the tribe to be dangerous, leading to them being denied recruitment to the army and having lands confiscated. This treatment was also applied to many other of the rebellious communities. Later, in Lahore District of British India, the Arain were the main Muslim landowning group among those located close to the urban areas, whilst Jats held a similar position in the rural areas. When the British wanted land developed in the Punjab Province, the Arain were brought in to cultivate lands around the cities, and were one of the agricultural communities given preference to assist with the opening up of the agrarian frontier in the Canal Colonies between 1885 and 1940. Traditionally associated with farming, Shahid Javed Burki says that the British favoured the Arain for their \\"hard work, frugality and sense of discipline\\". Subsequent development of towns and cities and increasing urbanisation resulted in the value of the land settled by Arain to rise significantly, and Arain families thus flourished. Education was prioritised with the new-found wealth and the Arain came to dominate the legal profession amongst urban Punjabi Muslims. Many used law to enter politics. Although at first denied entry to the British Indian Army following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, in the early 20th century the Arain were classified by the Raj as an \\"agricultural tribe\\", which was then effectively synonymous with the \\"martial race\\" classification. Organisation Several meetings were held to establish an organisation to represent the Arain community in the 1890s. Eventually, in 1915, Anjuman Ra‚Äôiyan-i-Hind emerged as such a body in Lahore and a national community newspaper, titled Al-Rai, was established.Ibrahim, Muhammad (2009), Role of Biradari System in Power Politics of Lahore: Post-Independence Period, Department of Political Science & International Relations Bahauddin Zakariya University Multan https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7237/b88f561d124c8c792cb2aec83c60dec7957f.pdf Culture The Arains are in majority in Lahore and this biradari is also active in industrial and commercial activities. A few families play a significant role in the politics of Lahore at national and local level.  Diaspora  There are several diasporic Arain communities in British towns and cities, such as Manchester and Oxford. The tribe has its own organisation, Arain Council UK, which was established as Anjuman-e-Arains in the 1980s and renamed in 2008. British Conservative Party politician Sajid Javid's family were farmers from the village of Rajana near Toba Tek Singh, Punjab, from where they migrated to the UK in the 1960s; Javid speaks some Punjabi.

Family and early life Daisuke Nanba was born to a distinguished family. His grandfather was decorated by the Emperor Meiji. His father was a Member of the Imperial Diet until the act of his son forced him to resign. Before he was 21 years old, Nanba showed no signs of having any sympathy for the radicals, and was even thinking about becoming an officer in the army. Political thought After 1919, a series of events influenced him greatly. At school in Tokyo, he attended political lectures and demonstrated in support of the suffrage movement in 1920. As a result of his father's position, he had the chance to hear Prime Minister Hara Takashi's opposition to extending the franchise. Angry against the politicians, he became more critical of his father's role and felt that some direct action was necessary. He began reading the works of Marx and Lenin as well as leftist magazines. In April 1921, he was affected greatly by Professor Kawakami Hajime's article on Russian Revolution. He was convinced that the revolution succeeded because dedicated terrorists made sacrifices. The following month's newspaper account about the High Treason Incident increased his indignation at the government. In late 1923, angered by the murders of Japanese anarchists and Koreans during the panic of the Great Kanto earthquake, he made up his mind to carry out the assassination. Toranomon incident The assassination attempt, known as Toranomon incident, took place on 27 December 1923 at the Toranomon intersection between the Akasaka Palace and the Diet of Japan in downtown Tokyo, Japan. Crown Prince and Regent Hirohito was on his way to the opening of the 48th Session of the Imperial Diet when Nanba fired a small pistol at his carriage. The bullet shattered a window on the carriage, injuring a chamberlain, but Hirohito was unharmed.Bix, Herbert P. (2001). Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan. pp. 140-141. Harper Perennial. . Prosecution, execution and aftermath Although Nanba claimed that he was rational (a view agreed upon in the court records), he was proclaimed insane to the public. On 13 November 1924, he was found guilty at an extraordinary session of the Supreme Court of Japan. When Chief Justice Yokota of the Supreme Court condemned Nanba to death, Nanba defiantly yelled back: \\"Long live the Communist Party of Japan!\\" He was executed by hanging two days later. His father and his married sister exiled themselves to Java, Dutch East Indies in order to escape the disgrace which Nanba, by his act, had brought upon the family. The family reportedly changed its name to \\"Kurokawa\\".JAPAN: Noble Expiation See also *Japanese resistance during the Sh≈çwa period *Assassination attempts on Hirohito References Category:1899 births Category:1924 deaths Category:20th-century executions by Japan Category:People executed for treason against Japan Category:Executed Japanese people Category:People executed by Japan by hanging Category:Japanese communists Category:20th-century executions for treason Category:Hirohito Category:People executed for attempted murder ","title":"Daisuke Nanba"},{"id":"2161907","text":"Robert Hamilton may refer to: Politics =U.S.= * Robert Hamilton (congressman) (1809‚Äì1878), U.S. Representative from New Jersey * Robert K.

Signs and symptoms A common symptom is a continual urge to have a bowel movement‚Äîthe rectum could feel full or have constipation. Another is tenderness and mild irritation in the rectum and anal region. A serious symptom is pus and blood in the discharge, accompanied by cramps and pain during the bowel movement. If there is severe bleeding, anemia can result, showing symptoms such as pale skin, irritability, weakness, dizziness, brittle nails, and shortness of breath. Symptoms are ineffectual straining to empty the bowels, diarrhea, rectal bleeding and possible discharge, a feeling of not having adequately emptied the bowels, involuntary spasms and cramping during bowel movements, left-sided abdominal pain, passage of mucus through the rectum, and anorectal pain. =Sexually transmitted proctitis= Gonorrhea (Gonococcal proctitis) :This is the most common cause. Strongly associated with anal intercourse. Symptoms include soreness, itching, bloody or pus-like discharge, or diarrhea. Other rectal problems that may be present are anal warts, anal tears, fistulas, and hemorrhoids. Chlamydia (chlamydia proctitis) :Accounts for twenty percent of cases. People may show no symptoms, mild symptoms, or severe symptoms. Mild symptoms include rectal pain with bowel movements, rectal discharge, and cramping. With severe cases, people may have discharge containing blood or pus, severe rectal pain, and diarrhea. Some people have rectal strictures, a narrowing of the rectal passageway. The narrowing of the passageway may cause constipation, straining, and thin stools. Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2 (herpes proctitis) :Symptoms may include multiple vesicles that rupture to form ulcers, tenesmus, rectal pain, discharge, hematochezia. The disease may run its natural course of exacerbations and remissions but is usually more prolonged and severe in patients with immunodeficiency disorders. Presentations may resemble dermatitis or decubitus ulcers in debilitated, bedridden patients. A secondary bacterial infection may be present. Syphilis (syphilitic proctitis) :The symptoms are similar to other causes of infectious proctitis; rectal pain, discharge, and spasms during bowel movements, but some people may have no symptoms. Syphilis occurs in three stages. :*The primary stage: One painless sore, less than an inch across, with raised borders found at the site of sexual contact, and during acute stages of infection, the lymph nodes in the groin become diseased, firm, and rubbery. :*The secondary stage: A contagious diffuse rash that may appear over the entire body, particularly on the hands and feet. :*The third stage: Occurs late in the course of syphilis and affects mostly the heart and nervous system. Causes A colonoscopy showing radiation proctitis. Proctitis has many possible causes. It may occur idiopathically (idiopathic proctitis, that is, arising spontaneously or from an unknown cause). Other causes include damage by irradiation (for example in radiation therapy for cervical cancer and prostate cancer) or as a sexually transmitted infection, as in lymphogranuloma venereum and herpes proctitis. Studies suggest a celiac disease-associated \\"proctitis\\" can result from an intolerance to gluten. A common cause is engaging in anal sex with partner(s) infected with sexual transmitted diseases in men who have sex with men. Shared enema usage has been shown to facilitate the spread of Lymphogranuloma venereum proctitis. Diagnosis Doctors can diagnose proctitis by looking inside the rectum with a proctoscope or a sigmoidoscope. A biopsy is taken, in which the doctor scrapes a tiny piece of tissue from the rectum, and this tissue is then examined by microscopy. The physician may also take a stool sample to test for infections or bacteria. If the physician suspects that the patient has Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, colonoscopy or barium enema X-rays are used to examine areas of the intestine. Treatment Treatment for proctitis varies depending on severity and the cause. For example, the physician may prescribe antibiotics for proctitis caused by bacterial infection. If the proctitis is caused by Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, the physician may prescribe the drug 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5ASA) or corticosteroids applied directly to the area in enema or suppository form, or taken orally in pill form. Enema and suppository applications are usually more effective, but some patients may require a combination of oral and rectal applications. Another treatment available is that of fiber supplements such as Metamucil. Taken daily these may restore regularity and reduce pain associated with proctitis. Chronic radiation proctitis is usually treated first-line with sucralfate enemas. These are non- invasive and are effective in diffuse, distal disease. Other treatments may include mesalamine suppositories, vitamin E, hyperbaric oxygen, or short chain fatty acid enemas; however these treatments are only supported by observational or anecdotal evidence.

He was the first Dutch-born Canadian elected to the House of Commons of Canada Life Oostrom was the eldest of thirteen children and immigrated to Canada from the Netherlands with his entire family in 1952. They settled on a farm near Kemptville, Ontario. Oostrom moved to Toronto in 1955 to study at the University of Toronto, and graduated in 1959 with a BA. He subsequently earned a Master of Business Administration degree and entered the business world as a financial analyst. By the late 1970s, he had become an executive with the electronics firm, Philips Canada. He was a member of Paul Hellyer's short-lived Action Canada Party in 1971, and followed Hellyer into the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada when Action Canada dissolved prior to the 1972 federal election. In that election, Oostrom was the Progressive Conservative (PC) candidate in the working-class Toronto riding of York South. He placed third behind New Democratic Party leader David Lewis and the Liberal candidate. =Career= In the 1979 federal election, Oostrom ran again in what had become York South‚ÄîWeston. This time he came in second, only 3,500 votes behind Liberal incumbent Ursula Appolloni. A third attempt by Oostrom in the 1980 election was less successful. He came third with only half as many votes as the Liberal victor. Oostrom was successful in his fourth campaign, in the 1984 federal election when he moved to the more affluent riding of Willowdale in North York. This time, Oostrom won, edging Liberal Member of Parliament Jim Peterson by just over 400 votes. As a Progressive Conservative backbencher in the House of Commons of Canada, Oostrom was a social conservative, opposing abortion and favouring capital punishment and a hard law and order stance. As vice chair of the House of Common's committee responsible for immigration, Oostrom also expressed criticism of what he saw as lax policies towards refugee claimants. Oostrom is also a fervent anti-Communist and was also involved with the far-right World Anti-Communist League. In the 1988 federal election, Oostrom again faced Peterson, who beat him by fewer than 2,000 votes. Oostrom returned to the private sector as a consultant before trying to regain his Willowdale seat as a PC Party candidate in the 1993 federal election. He was unsuccessful, garnering only 7,733 votes against Peterson's 28,000 and winning only 700 votes more than the third place Reform Party candidate. Oostrom attempted another comeback in the 2000 federal election, this time in the suburban 905 riding of Oak Ridges north of Toronto. Running again as a Progressive Conservative, he came in a poor third. In 2003, Oostrom added his voice to those Tories opposing the Progressive Conservative Party's merger with the Canadian Alliance.

Although Wintergreen lacked Slade's superhuman physical attributes, he possessed far more combat experience and thus acted as Wilson's mentor. A re-imagined version of the character appeared on The CW's live-action television series Arrow in the first season, where he was portrayed by stunt performer Jeffrey C. Robinson as the show's first incarnation of Deathstroke. He returned in the final season as well. He was also featured on the second season of the DC Universe series Titans, played by Demore Barnes. Publication history Created by George P√©rez and Marv Wolfman, William Randolph Wintergreen was introduced to the DC Universe in New Teen Titans #2 (December 1980) as the butler of Deathstroke the Terminator.New Teen Titans #2 Fictional character biography William Randolph Wintergreen grew up in Oxford, England. At university, he avoided sports and squirreled himself away in the library, which was open to him due to his father's title. He possessed strong research skills, and knowing the conduits through which information flowed later aided him in his work with MI5. Wintergreen met Sergeant Slade Wilson during his time at the British Army, and the two developed a close friendship. When General Sampson sent Slade on a suicide mission, Wintergreen, now a member of the Special Air Service, rescued Slade from perishing in an explosion, while Sampson was given a minor reprimand. Wintergreen served as Slade's best man when the latter married his captain, Adeline Kane. Still holding a grudge for Wintergreen's disobedience, Sampson later sent Wintergreen on a suicide mission. Slade commandeered a plane and made his way to Hanoi, where he freed Wintergreen from a Viet Cong prison. Slade then revealed to Wintergreen that his physical attributes had been enhanced by a military experiment. Slade was subsequently discharged for disobeying orders to save Wintergreen.New Teen Titans #2 Following his discharge, Slade secretly began operating as the mercenary \\"Deathstroke\\". When Slade's occupation resulted in an accident involving their son, Joseph Wilson, Adeline divorced Slade and left with their children. Wintergreen then became Slade's butler and mentor, acting as his moral conscience, comrade in arms and medic. Wintergreen also began cataloguing Slade's adventures in journal entries. Slade took up hunting in Africa for a brief time, with Wintergreen at his side. Slade eventually returned to his mercenary ways, and Wintergreen continued to catalogue his missions. Slade later discovered that he had a daughter named Rose Wilson. Fearing that he would not be a good father, Slade left Rose in the care of Wintergreen, who grew to care very much for her and was even prepared to adopt her, though Rose ultimately joined the Teen Titans. When Slade was later caught in an explosion, he retired and cut ties with both Pat Trayce and Wintergreen, claiming that they were no longer part of his life. Despite suspecting that this explosion actually restored Slade's memory (since details of his past life crept up in idle conversation), Wintergreen knew that Slade had his reasons for distancing himself, and thus respected this unspoken request from his student by giving him his space. In Slade's absence, Trayce and Wintergreen honoured him by continuing to run Vigilance, Inc. (a search-and-rescue operation originally set up as a mercenary organisation by Adeline). Sometime later, Slade discovered that Joseph's spirit had taken refuge deep within his body. With the help of Wintergreen, he attempted to exorcise his son from himself, but was quickly overpowered. The possessed Slade then seemingly murdered Wintergreen, mounting his severed head on a wall as he vowed that \\"Deathstroke hunts alone\\". Before his death, Wintergreen had apparently believed that he would inevitably be murdered by Slade, evidenced by his last words, \\"I suppose it was only a matter of time\\". Slade would forever be haunted by his mentor's dying words.Teen Titans vol.3 #2 =Blackest Night= During the Blackest Night storyline, Wintergreen was revived by a Black Lantern Ring, and went back to haunt Deathstroke with Adeline Wilson and the Ravagers as members of the Black Lantern Corps.Teen Titans vol.3 #77 =DC Rebirth= Wintergreen returns in the DC Rebirth relaunch, once again serving as an ally of Deathstroke from his time in the army. Powers and abilities Wintergreen has received extensive training in military protocols and espionage, making him a proficient hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist. He has also proven an exceptionally skilled marksman in the use of various firearms.Deathstroke vol.1 #1 In other media =Television= * Wintergreen makes occasional non-speaking appearances as Slade's butler in the Teen Titans animated series. Concept artwork of Bill Wintergreen's Deathstroke costume for Arrow season one. * Stuntman Jeffrey C. Robinson portrays Bill \\"Billy\\" Wintergreen on The CW's live-action television series Arrow. As evenly skilled in swordsmanship and hand-to-hand combat as Slade Wilson is, this version of the character is the first person in the \\"Arrowverse\\" to utilise the Deathstroke persona, and appears in the flashback scenes of season one. Bill Wintergreen (call sign \\"Bishop\\") was once a member of an elite division of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) alongside his close friend, Slade Wilson (call sign \\"Terminator\\"), whose son he served as the godfather of. Before 2007, the pair were sent to the island of Lian Yu to rescue Chinese army deserter Yao Fei from a group of terrorists that sought to cripple China's economy. After their plane was shot down by Edward Fyers, the mercenaries' leader, Wintergreen defected to Fyers' side and left Slade to survive on his own. In the episode \\"Damaged\\", Fyers has Wintergreen torture shipwrecked playboy Oliver Queen for Yao Fei's location, only for Fei to launch a surprise attack and rescue Oliver. In \\"Year's End\\" and \\"Burned\\", Wintergreen frees Fyers from Yao Fei's capture and bests the latter in combat. In \\"The Odyssey\\", Fyers orders Wintergreen to execute a captured Oliver, but Slade triggers an explosion and engages his former partner. Although Wintergreen initially gains the upper hand, he is stabbed by Slade in his right eye. In the episode \\"Purgatory,\\" Team Arrow and Lyla Michaels encounter Wintergreen, Fyers, and their group on Lian Yu when the energy build-up restored them. When Lyla activated the weapon that is tied to her DNA, the energies are absorbed causing Wintergreen, Fyers, and their group to disappear. In the tie-in novel called Arrow: Vengeance, it is revealed that he has a half-brother named Wade DeFarge, who is Slade's former commanding officer in the government in this continuity. * Wintergreen appears in the DC Universe live-action series Titans, portrayed by Demore Barnes.

It is located in the South Kensington area on Kensington Palace Gardens near the junction with Kensington High Street. The building hosts both the Embassy of Israel and the Israeli Consulate, accessible via a separate entrance at 15a Old Court Place. Location The Embassy is situated at 2 Kensington Palace Gardens, the extension of Palace Green, which is home to Kensington Palace itself as well as a number of other diplomatic delegations, and forms part of the Crown Estate. Security around the Embassy is extremely rigorous, and photography of the building is prohibited.

Security incidents and assassination attempts thumb On 19 September 1972, a letter bomb delivered to the Embassy exploded, killing Ami Shachori, an Israeli diplomat. Seven other bombs claimed to have been sent by the Palestinian terrorist group Black September were either not delivered, or detected. On 3 June 1982, Ambassador of Israel Shlomo Argov was shot and seriously injured on departing an event at the Dorchester Hotel where he was guest of honour. A terror cell claiming to have split from the PLO and headed by Abu Nidal took credit for the attack. After a lengthy coma, Argov died of his wounds in 2003. The incident is widely reported as being a key factor in the 1982 Lebanon War. On 26 July 1994, a car bomb exploded outside the Embassy, partially destroying the front of the building and injuring 20 people within and outside the building. The blast damaged shops on nearby Kensington High Street, and blew out windows in Kensington Palace. The attack came a day after the leaders of Israel and Jordan had met for peace talks and eight days after the AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires. Thirteen hours after the attack on the embassy another bomb exploded outside a Jewish charity building in north London, injuring six people. Five Palestinians resident in London were arrested in January 1995 in connection with the bombings and two ‚Äì Jawad Botmeh and Samar Alami ‚Äì were sentenced to 20 years in jail for their role in the attacks. A series of demonstrations outside the Embassy during December 2008 and January 2009, held in protest at Israel's \\"Cast Lead\\" operation in Gaza, were marred by violence and ended in a number of arrests and at least one court sentence for those taking part in the violence.

Okroshka is usually garnished with sour cream (smetana). Later versions that first appeared in Soviet times use light or diluted kefir, whey, vinegar, or mineral water instead of kvass. The ingredients are diced and then mixed with kvass just before eating; the ratio of chopped food to kvass is similar to that of cereal to milk. This allows the vegetables to retain their texture. For that same reason, even though the ingredients are similar to those in a Russian salad, the taste of okroshka is quite different from that of the salad. Okroshka is mostly served in summer because the soup combines the refreshing taste of kvass and the lightness of a salad. Salt and sugar can be added according to taste. In the recipes with mineral water, there is one more addition to the ingredients of okroshka: freshly squeezed lemon juice. It adds that extra savor to the recipes without kvass and makes this dish so mouthwatering. Okroshka is always served cold. Sometimes ice cubes are added to served portions to keep the soup cold in hot weather. Gallery Image:Kefir-okroshka.jpgOkroshka made with kefir File:–û–∫—Ä–æ—à–∫–∞1.JPGClassic okroshka with beef.

A direct sequel to SSX, the game was released in 2001 for PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox and was later ported to the Game Boy Advance in October 2002. Gameplay Gameplay continues the same basic method introduced in SSX, with the main tracks being 'remixed' from the previous games and two new tracks, Garibaldi and Alaska. The important new feature added to the series are the Uber moves. If players are able to fill their boost bar to the maximum, they will be able to perform Uber moves which involve characters taking their feet off their board and doing over the top moves. If a player successfully lands an Uber move, they are given a short amount of time for infinite boost, which can be topped off by performing more Uber moves. Each player can perform five Uber moves, including a personal move if the character is using a board that matches their style. If a player successfully performs six Uber moves, spelling out 'tricky' on the boost bar, they will have infinite boost for the remainder of the level. Also introduced in the game is a rivalry system in the World Circuit mode. If the player is friendly with another AI character, they will treat the player favourably. However, if the player ends up annoying other AI characters, generally by attacking them during the race in order to fill the adrenaline bar, they will become hostile towards players in future events. =Modes= There are four modes of gameplay. ;Freeride :The Freeride mode of gameplay does not allow players to unlock characters or boards. It enables players to play with either one or two players, as well as allowing you to get to know the course. It does, however, allow you to unlock outfits by completing a trick chapter. ;Practice :Practice Mode is a great place for beginners to get the opportunity to get used to snowboarding. As in Freeride, players have the ability to do what they wish, and to practice tricks. ;World Circuit :In the World Circuit mode, players have the ability to unlock characters, boards and outfits by racing and competing in events. There are two main categories of events; Race and Show-off. In race, the player must compete in the Quarter- and Semi-finals, and then in the Finals and get within the top three places to \\"win\\" that track; the medals are Bronze, Silver and Gold. :There are eight tracks to complete. When racing, players must attempt to stay in the lead of their five opponents. In show-off, players are required to perform as many fancy tricks as they can and obtain as many points as they can. :If this mode is completed in Race, the extra track \\"Untracked\\" is unlocked for Freeplay. Similar to Showoff is Pipedream. ;Single Event :Single Event takes, as its name suggests, one of the events over a single heat from World Circuit mode. Medals are awarded at the end of the track, and a second human player can be added. Reception Peter Suclu reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"If you haven't played SSX, this is a must-buy, but if you already own the game, the full-price 'expansion pack' is hardly revolutionary.\\" The PlayStation 2 version received \\"universal acclaim\\", and the GameCube and Xbox versions received \\"favorable\\" reviews, while the Game Boy Advance version received \\"average\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Most reviews hesitated before calling the game a \\"true sequel\\" since it shared a large amount of content with the original SSX (all but two of the courses appear in the original). Reviews did compliment the added features, such as \\"Uber tricks\\" and \\"Rivalry\\" with other boarders. Some reviewers thought that the improvements over the original were so good that SSX Tricky was billed as the best snowboarding game to date. The voice acting was highly praised by many reviewers, noting that the use of celebrities such as Lucy Liu helped bring the outrageous characters to life. The music system received much acclaim as it was able to adapt to suit the situation. Each course had specific songs paired with it to match the mood and when riders reached maximum boost or were knocked down, the music reacts. The size of the environments, the detail of the graphics and the trick system also received plenty of recognition from reviewers. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 32 out of 40 for the GameCube version, 30 out of 40 for the PS2 version, and three sevens and one eight (29/40) for the Xbox version. In predicting the sales for the game, PSX Extreme said \\"It's quite unfortunate if I do say so myself, because a AAA title like SSX Tricky won't be getting the sales it really deserves.\\" IGN called it the 95th best PlayStation 2 game. The staff cited its improvements over its predecessor (which includes \\"flashier Uber moves\\"). Legacy SSX Tricky is noted to have increased popularity of the Run-DMC song It's Tricky, which is used as the game's main theme. The renowned song's connection to the game and its fans led to it's inclusion in the 2012 reboot. =Possible remake= In 2020, Steven Rechtschaffner, the producer of SSX Tricky expressed his interest and the possibility of a remake of the game. However, he says that overall it's not his decision, but rather the developers and EA, who own the IP.

The 3M6 Shmel (; ) is an MCLOS wire-guided Anti-tank missile of the Soviet Union. Its GRAU designation is \\"3M6\\" and its NATO reporting name is AT-1 Snapper. Too large to be manportable, it was typically deployed from specialised vehicles or helicopters. The missile was intended to supplement traditional anti-tank weapons, like the 100 mm anti-tank gun whose accuracy beyond 1,500 m is poor. The missile's accuracy in contrast remained high as far as its maximum range of 2,000 m. However, the system's bulk, slow speed and poor combat accuracy drove development of later SACLOS systems, like the AT-5 Spandrel. Development The 3M6 Shmel was based on the western ATGMs of the time, such as the Nord Aviation SS.10; however, it is considerably larger. It was developed by the Special Mortar Design Bureau (SKB Gladkostvolnoi Artillery) in Kolomna, who were also responsible for the AT-3 Sagger. Development of the missile proceeded rapidly, with the first unguided flights in April 1958 followed by controlled flights in June and July 1958. On 28 August 1959, the new technology was shown to the command of armed forces. On 1 August 1960, it was accepted into the service. It was first publicly displayed in 1963. History 2P26 in Batey ha-Osef Museum, Israel. Polish 2P27 There were two ground-based platforms for the missile * 2P26 Based on the unarmored GAZ-69 light truck - with four backward pointing launch rails. The control station can be deployed up to 30 m away from the launcher vehicle. It entered service in 1960 * 2P27 Based on the armored BRDM-1 - with three pop up launch rails protected by an armored cover. It entered service in 1964. These vehicles were deployed in anti-tank batteries attached to motor rifle regiments. Each battery has three platoons, each with three launch vehicles and a single command BRDM. While a few were used by Egyptian forces during the 1967 Six-Day War and from 1969 in the War of Attrition, only one tank loss was attributed to the system. The system's hit probability is estimated to have been 25% in combat. The system was also used by the Cypriot National Guard during the 1974 Turkish Invasion of Cyprus in a man-portable version. Several dozen shots were fired in action during a number of July and August engagements in the conflict, with low effectiveness. North Korea began producing a reverse- engineered version of the missile in 1975. Description The missile is guided to the target by means of a joystick, which requires some skill on the part of the operator. The operator's adjustments are transmitted to the missile via a thin wire that trails behind the missile. The missile is steered by an unconventional arrangement of vibrating spoilers. As stated before, MCLOS requires considerable skill on the part of the operator. The system's effectiveness in combat drove the development of missiles based on the easier to use SACLOS system. One problem with the missile is the amount of time it takes to reach maximum range‚Äîaround 20 seconds‚Äîgiving the intended target time to take action, either by retreating behind an obstacle, laying down a smoke screen or firing on the operator. Also, the large size of the missile means that only a few rounds can be carried; the BRDM-1 vehicle can only carry three missiles.

They were formed in Birmingham by Tony Clarkin (guitar, songwriter) and Bob Catley (vocals) in order to appear as the resident band at the Rum Runner nightclub in the city. Magnum have undergone several changes in personnel over the years; however, the core of Catley and Clarkin remain. Magnum's most significant early success was Chase the Dragon in 1982, which reached number 17 in the UK Albums Chart. It included several songs that would become mainstays of the band's live set, notably \\"Soldier of the Line\\", \\"Sacred Hour\\" and \\"The Spirit\\". On a Storyteller's Night gave the band its breakthrough in Europe, and achieved a Gold certification in the United Kingdom. The band's 1986 album Vigilante represented a further move towards the mainstream before the band achieved their commercial peak in 1988 when they entered the UK Top Ten for the first time with the album Wings of Heaven, which reached number five and featured three Top 40 singles, \\"Days of No Trust\\", \\"Start Talking Love\\" and \\"It Must Have Been Love\\". It was followed by Goodnight L.A., which was produced by Keith Olsen and reached number nine in the UK Album Chart in 1990. It produced another Top 40 single for the band, \\"Rockin' Chair\\". In 1995, Clarkin announced Magnum's split; however, Clarkin and Catley continued working together as before, now under the name Hard Rain. Magnum reformed in 2001 and has enjoyed late-career commercial success. Their most recent album, The Serpent Rings, was released in January 2020. History = Early years (1972‚Äì1978)= Magnum began as the house band at Birmingham's famous Rum Runner night club (later the home of Duran Duran). Joining Clarkin and Catley were drummer Kex Gorin (born Kevin Gorin, 1 January 1949, Birmingham died 21 December 2007) and bassist Bob Doyle. The band line up remained the same until 1972, when Les Kitcheridge joined temporarily on guitar. Bob Doyle left Magnum in 1972 and joined Roy Wood's Wizzard, and was replaced by former Uglys and Balls bassist Dave Morgan (later a member of ELO). Morgan commented: They began to develop their own style by playing Clarkin's songs at a residency at The Railway Inn, in Birmingham's Curzon Street, in 1976. In 1975, Clarkin and Dave Morgan received an offer from Kim Holmes to help with the construction of a studio, rather than being paid with money, Clarkin requested to be paid with studio time.Clarkin, Tony & Ling, David (2006). Sleeve Notes. In Kingdom Of Madness: Expanded Edition (pp. 2) [CD liner notes]. London: Sanctuary Records. Much of Magnum's early demo material was recorded at Nest Studios in Birmingham, which would later lead to a recording contract with David Arden of Jet Records. During the \\"Nest\\" sessions, at least two songs written by Dave Morgan (and sung by Bob Catley) were recorded but never released. The titles were \\"Baby I Need\\" and \\"One More Round The Bend\\", which resurfaced on an acetate disc in 2005. A one off deal with CBS was arranged via producer Roger Greenaway, and the band released a cover of The Searchers' \\"Sweets for My Sweet\\" in February 1975; however, this failed to make the charts. The original recording included a medley of \\"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\\" but was edited out for the single release. Lead vocals on this song were by Morgan, who left the band soon after, and was replaced by Colin \\"Wally\\" Lowe. Success was still minimal; they were working as a backing band for artists, such as Del Shannon, on small tours. The band was expanded to a five-piece with the addition of Richard Bailey on keyboards. In May 1977 the band supported Judas Priest on their Sin After Sin UK tour, still without the backing of a record label. =Jet Records (1978‚Äì1984)= Magnum's debut album Kingdom of Madness was released on Jet Records at the end of 1978 and reached #58 in the UK Chart; it received a five star review from Geoff Barton of Sounds magazine. They toured the UK in October/November 1978, as support to David Coverdale's Whitesnake. Leo Lyons, formerly bassist with Ten Years After, produced the follow-up album Magnum II ‚Äì which was released in 1979, but failed to chart. Another support tour was organised for November 1979, this time with Blue √ñyster Cult. A live set, Marauder, was released as an album and reached #34 in the UK, and a live double single (\\"Live at the Marquee\\", including \\"Invasion\\") reached #48 in the UK Singles Chart. Bailey departed soon after and was replaced temporarily by Grenville Harding during Magnum's support of Def Leppard's On Through the Night UK tour in March. For the second leg in April, permanent replacement Mark Stanway took over keyboard duties. Magnum also appeared at the Reading Festival in 1980. April 1981 saw another support tour, this time with Tygers of Pan Tang on their Spellbound UK tour. Their first successful album was the Jeff Glixman produced Chase the Dragon (1982), which reached #17 in the UK, and included several songs that would be mainstays of the band's live set, including \\"Soldier of the Line\\", \\"Sacred Hour\\" and \\"The Spirit\\". Glixman was previously known for his work with Kansas, and this was the first Magnum release to feature the artwork of fantasy artist Rodney Matthews. The tour included a support slot in February with Krokus, on their One Vice at a Time UK tour. A few United States dates were played during the summer of 1982, supporting labelmate Ozzy Osbourne ‚Äì these would ultimately prove to be the only live gigs the band ever played outside Europe. The band returned to the UK in July for their own headlining tour. Budgetary constraints at Jet denied Magnum the use of an outside producer for 1983's Clarkin-produced The Eleventh Hour, which peaked at UK #38. A UK tour started in May 1983, featuring additional guitarist Robin George for live performances. Magnum also appeared at the 1983 Reading Festival, with George. Magnum and Jet parted company shortly afterwards, Kex Gorin was replaced by Jim Simpson and Stanway took some time away from the band to work with Phil Lynott, being replaced by Eddie George. Local businessman Keith Baker (Time Music) engaged the band, an independent tour was organised for February 1984 without the backing of a record label. Lawrence Archer temporarily stood in for Clarkin when he became ill. =On a Storyteller's Night and commercial success years (1985‚Äì1995)= Stanway returned to the band in 1984, and they toured the UK in January 1985. Magnum signed a one-off deal with FM Records, and released On a Storyteller's Night, which had a cover by Rodney Matthews. It reached #24 in the UK, and launched the band across Europe. For the May UK tour, Simpson was replaced by Mickey Barker. From the success of On a Storyteller's Night, Keith Baker was able to negotiate the band a major label deal with Polydor Records, and they embarked on the most commercially successful period of their career ‚Äì opening the famous Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington in August 1985, on a bill that also included Bon Jovi, Metallica, Marillion and headliners ZZ Top. A second leg for the Storyteller's tour was concluded in December 1985. The first release for Polydor was in September 1986, entitled Vigilante. The album was a move towards the mainstream due to production by Queen drummer Roger Taylor and David Richards, who had recently worked together on A Kind of Magic. The switch to Polydor saw an increase in the marketing budget, and promotional videos were made for the singles \\"Lonely Night\\" and \\"Midnight\\". A full UK and European tour was scheduled in March 1986, including appearances at The Garden Party Festival, Milton Keynes Bowl in June and the Out In The Green Festival. A second leg was organised in September 1986, which finished in Europe in November 1986. In March 1987, the band embarked on a third UK and European tour, including an appearance at 1987's Reading Festival. Magnum enjoyed increased success with the album Wings of Heaven (#5 in the UK). Three singles from Wings of Heaven reached the UK Top 40, including a Top of the Pops appearance with \\"Start Talking Love\\". A successful tour followed in December and, by now, Magnum had been elevated to an 'arena' band in the UK, headlining the N.E.C. and several nights at London's Hammersmith Odeon, supported by the Norwegian band Stage Dolls. The band went to Los Angeles for the Keith Olsen produced Goodnight L.A., which peaked at #9 in the UK chart. The band performed at Berlin's Arena Festival, followed by a full UK and European tour in September 1990. They toured the UK again in November. Following Goodnight L.A.'s lukewarm reception, Magnum parted company with Polydor. They released the live album The Spirit in 1991 and toured the UK and Europe again to support the album. During the concerts in Germany, the band played live with the Roger Taylor band The Cross. Magnum continued to release albums for various labels on one-off deals, the first being Sleepwalking in 1992 on Music for Nations with a full UK tour in October. This was followed by the acoustic album Keeping the Nite Light Burning in 1993 with a UK tour in April. Rock Art was released in 1994 on EMI. The album charted 57 in the United Kingdom, the lowest position for a studio album since 1979. A UK tour was scheduled for April, but dates in May and June were postponed or cancelled. A low key tour was arranged for August and Europe in September, followed by another tour in the spring 1995. Clarkin wrote eleven new songs for the planned next album, which were recorded and sent to record companies, their contract with EMI having expired. However, they received no offer from any major record company, and the band faced financial difficulties. Meanwhile, Clarkin had started to feel creatively trapped, as fans and critics did not appreciate the band's musical evolution. A growing creative gap between Clarkin and Stanway also caused friction within the band.Magnum interview with Tony Clarkin, Youtube, May 2, 2019. In September 1995, Clarkin decided to quit. The other band members were shocked by his decision, and made vain attempts to talk him out of it. They briefly considered continuing with a different guitarist, but soon concluded that Clarkin - being the band's sole songwriter - was irreplaceable. They managed to talk Clarkin into doing a farewell tour in the United Kingdom and Europe, documented on the live album Stronghold (titled The Last Dance in mainland Europe). After a final concert on December 17, 1995, the Magnum disbanded.15\\\\. The Last Dance - Farewell MAGNUM, magnum-biography.jimdo.com. Accessed Jan 24, 2019. =Split and Hard Rain years (1995‚Äì2001)= While most band members went their separate ways, Catley and Clarkin continued working together as before and planned a new album. To avoid pressure and interference from the labels, they named themselves Hard Rain rather than continuing as Magnum. In 1997, they released the eponymous debut album Hard Rain. Most of the songs on the album had been written before the split of Magnum and were originally meant for a Magnum album. The album received positive reviews, and Catley and Clarkin started recruiting more musicians to turn Hard Rain into an actual band. Ex-Magnum drummer Kex Gorin briefly agreed to join the band, before changing his mind. Hard Rain eventually recruited the brothers Rob and Al Barrow as drummer and bassist, respectively, and Sue McCloskey for backup vocals. The next album, When the Good Times Come, was released in 1999. This album was stylistically different from anything Magnum had released, and received mixed reviews from critics.Interview with Bob Catley of Magnum, Rok Podgraj≈°ek. therocktologist.com, 2012. Hard Rain always included Magnum songs in their live sets, and was widely considered a continuation of Magnum in all but name. The new name was actually detrimental to the sales, as many buyers expected the to find the albums in the M-shelf rather than the H-sheld in music stores. The albums would eventually be filed together with Magnum albums. Clarkin and Catley discussed whether they should revert to the name Magnum, but ultimately decided against it.16\\\\. HARD RAIN - The Spirit Survives, Magnum Biography. It was around this time that Catley launched a solo career using various songwriters, including Gary Hughes of the band Ten. However, Hard Rain found bookings hard to come by, and there were discussions about renaming the band as Magnum. At the same time, Catley was becoming increasingly focused on his solo career, and in September 1999 he quit Hard Rain, marking the end of a working relationship with Clarkin that dated back to 1972. Clarkin briefly continued Hard Rain with Sue McCloskey replacing Catley on vocals. They performed with this lineup at a charity event in January 2000, but Hard Rain never released any additional new material. A short quiet period ensued, followed by rumors of a Magnum reunion. During Magnum's split, one of Clarkin's friends found a live recording from 1976 in his loft. Clarkin, fed up with the many unofficial compilations that had been released without the band's authorisation, was initially reluctant to authorise the release of this old material. He eventually changed his mind, and Days of Wonder was released in April 2000.Zoom Club Records, Magnum - Days of Wonder, CD Inlay Notes, 2000. =Reformation and beyond (2001‚Äîpresent)= In March 2001, Catley revealed that Clarkin had suggested a reunion, apparently after his manager Derek Kemp had convinced him that giving Magnum a new shot was worth it. Catley and Clarkin had hoped for a complete reunion of the pre-1995 lineup, but only Mark Stanway ended up returning to the band. While Mickey Barker was committed to a different band, Wally Lowe had retired from the music industry. Al Barrow, who had been a member of Hard Rain, continued as the band's bassist. Rob Barrow was offered to stay on as the band's drummer, but he had already decided to quit the music industry. Clarkin's manager's assessment proved to be correct; while in 1995 the band had difficulties getting a record deal, this time they got several offers. They ultimately signed a deal with SPV Steamhammer in September 2001.18\\\\. Breath Of Life - The Reunion, magnum- biography.jimdo.com. Accessed Jan 24, 2019. In February 2002, Breath of Life was released. The album consisted partly of songs originally written for Hard Rain; according to Catley, it was a mix of Magnum and Hard Rain. They recorded the album without a drummer, before hiring Thunder drummer Harry James to complete the lineup. The band then went on a UK tour in December. The next album, Brand New Morning, was released in 2004. This album represented a final departure from the Hard Rain style; years later, Catley would comment that \\"Brand New Morning [had] really [been] the first new Magnum album\\". Magnum then appeared at Germany's Bang Your Head Festival and the Lorca Rock Festival in Spain and went on a tour around the UK and Europe in December. Clarkin commented: When James returned to Thunder, Jimmy Copley became a full-time member of Magnum. The band toured in April 2005 to mark the 20th anniversary of On a Storyteller's Night; they released a live DVD of the Astoria concert entitled Livin' the Dream, which also included a short documentary and promotional videos from throughout the band's history. Magnum completed work on a new studio album, Princess Alice and the Broken Arrow, which was released on 26 March 2007; this also marked the return to the cover artwork by Rodney Matthews. The album entered the UK Album Charts at No. 70, the first time Magnum had charted in the UK since 1994. It also reached No. 4 on the BBC Rock Album Charts and No. 60 in Germany. Magnum toured the UK and Europe in May 2007. Harry James played drums temporarily for half the tour as Jimmy Copley was taken ill. Copley died in 2017. In 2005, former drummer Kex Gorin was diagnosed with kidney cancer. Gorin had a kidney removed and underwent radiotherapy and steroid treatment, but died of the disease on 21 December 2007. In 2007, Magnum played a one off show at the Robin 2 in Bilston, Wolverhampton. This was a charity event in aid of former drummer Kex Gorin's family. An auction of memorabilia before the show raised over ¬£10,000. Magnum then played a two-hour set of old and new material. Magnum undertook a UK tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of Wings of Heaven in November 2007. These shows were recorded for Wings of Heaven Live album, which was released in March 2008. In September 2008, Bob Catley released the album Immortal, his last solo album to date. Until that point, he had released a solo album between each Magnum album. With the end of this pattern, the typical time gap between each Magnum album was shortened from approximately two and a half years to less than two years. On 15 June 2009, they released Into the Valley of the Moonking on SPV. In 2010, the band released, The Gathering, on Universal/Sanctuary; their first ever cross-career collection spread over five discs featuring a 1988 live recording from Hammersmith Odeon. The band released their next album, The Visitation, in 2011. The band toured in support of the album, which charted at No. 55 in the UK and No. 19 in Germany, throughout March and April 2011. On 30 August, Magnum announced a new compilation remix album Evolution celebrating the last 10 years on SPV GmbH since their reformation in 2001. The album was released on 11 November 2011 in Germany and 14 November in the rest of Europe and the UK. The album featured 10 songs from the band's previous five studio releases, eight were re- recorded, remixed and remastered, as well as two new songs. The band released their 17th studio album On the 13th Day in September 2012. \\"So Let It Rain\\" was the first single, released in August 2012 via Steamhammer/SPV. The band toured in Europe to promote the album in late 2012 which charted in many countries across Europe including the UK at No. 43. Soon after releasing and touring On the 13th Day Magnum revealed that Clarkin was back in the studio writing and recording new songs via Facebook on 4 April 2013. The new album, called Escape from the Shadow Garden, also was to feature Rodney Matthews's artwork, this time showing similarities to Magnum's early albums Chase the Dragon (the tree) and On a Storyteller's Night (the storyteller), along with elements from more recent albums such as On the 13th Day. Escape From the Shadow Garden was released in Scandinavia on 19 March 2014, and on 21 March for Germany, Austria and Switzerland, 24 March for the rest of Europe, and 1 April for the US and Canada. As with On the 13th Day the band were hosts to their fans at a record launch party held at the Robin 2 in Bilston on 25 March 2014, the day after the UK release. Compared with Magnum's album releases since reformation it was a great commercial success reaching number 14 in the German Albums Chart, 19 in the Swedish Albums Chart, 22 in the Switzerland Albums Chart and 38 in the official UK Albums Chart, a position last achieved by Magnum with The Eleventh Hour! in 1983. It also reached number two in the UK Rock Albums Chart. The album was followed by a European tour, during which the live album Escape from the Shadow Garden ‚Äì Live 2014 was recorded. It was released in May 2015. In 2016, Magum released the album Sacred Blood \\"Divine\\" Lies, 10 brand new tracks forging forward the Magnum sound. With the collaboration once again with Rodney Matthews artwork the release came with bonus videos and bonus tracks. The album was followed by a 33 date 2016 tour in EU, UK and Ireland and then again a winter tour appearing at a few UK and Irish venues. After a conversation between Clarkin and his daughter discussing all the ballads the band had in the catalogue, he talked to SPV and they agreed. This turned out to be a longer process than anticipated. Many songs undertook a lot of treatment to remix, re-master and even re-record complete songs. The new ballads album titled The Valley of Tears ‚Äì The Ballads was released on 6 January 2017. In December 2016, Mark Stanway left the band. He was replaced by West Midlands session musician Rick Benton, who made his first live appearance in Wolverhampton 2016. He was officially announced as the new member in January 2017. A few months later, due to conflicting schedules, former Paradise Lost drummer Lee Morris replaced Harry James as the band's drummer. With this new lineup, the band started recording their next album in February 2017. Lost on the Road to Eternity was released in January 2018, and the band embarked on a tour, which resulted in the live album Live at the Symphony Hall in January 2019. On 25 June 2019, bassist Al Barrow announced his departure from the band due to his difficulties in spending much time away from his home in America. Dennis Ward (Pink Cream 69, Unisonic) was announced as the new member. Clarkin continued to write new material.

Biography Born in New York City, Kingsley was the daughter of newspaperman and press agent Walter J. Kingsley, and silent film actress Alma Hanlon. Following their divorce, Hanlon remarried to director Louis Myll. They lived at Bayside, Queens for two years, and later moved with Dorothy to the affluent suburb of Grosse Pointe, Michigan. Kingsley also had an unsuccessful first marriage. As a young divorced mother of three, while recuperating from a severe case of the measles, she listened to all the radio programs and began to think that she could write better material than she was hearing. She went to Los Angeles to visit a friend and made the rounds of numerous agents with material she had written for various radio stars such as Jack Benny. Her youthful appearance worked against her, but she finally found an agent who would take a chance on her. Kingsley went home and packed up her children, but on her return to Los Angeles she found that the agent had gone out of business.McGilligan. 1991. =Radio= While Kingsley unsuccessfully made the rounds of agents, she happened to meet Constance Bennett socially. Bennett thought that Kingsley's material was better than her current supply, and used a couple of her gags on her radio program. Despite the size of the program's writing staff, Kingsley began supplying material gags under the table for $75 a week, but eventually the representative who was paying her for the material left and she was again unemployed. Kingsley answered a newspaper ad to write gags for Edgar Bergen, and as a result she was chosen from 400 entries for a one-month trial period at $50 a week. The Edgar Bergen show became one of the top-rated programs and Kingsley stayed with them for several years.Harbin. 1982. =MGM= It was while she was with the Bergen radio show that Kingsley started submitting scripts to studios. Arthur Freed at MGM thought she had promise and wanted to put her under contract at double what Bergen was paying. Bergen was notorious for underpaying his talent and when he found out she was dismissed. Her first assignment was a production rewrite on Girl Crazy, a Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland musical. The current writer was otherwise occupied, so Freed asked her to go down to the set and just do a little work. Kingsley soon developed the ability to fix an ailing script during production, and while she was working on Girl Crazy, producer Jack Cummings was having a lot of trouble with Bathing Beauty and asked her to fix that as well. Many people had already worked on the ailing script whose musical numbers had been shot and had no story. It was the first picture for Esther Williams and became a big hit. Kingsley often worked without credit; and though hers was usually a co-credit, she normally worked alone, before or after the other screenwriters had finished up. Kingsley wrote many of the great MGM musicals such as Kiss Me Kate, as well as a number of scripts for Debbie Reynolds and three quarters of all the Esther Williams pictures. The grand spectacle pictures were very popular during the war years, when people desperately wanted escapist entertainment. In 1948, Kingsley and fellow screenwriter Dorothy Cooper wrote A Date with Judy, which was a pivotal film for Elizabeth Taylor, who, after playing frail juvenile roles, was given the part of a manipulative modern flirt who saw a school campus as merely husband-hunting grounds.Walker. 2001. Kingsley, a devout Catholic, wrote the baseball picture Angels in the Outfield, President Eisenhower's favorite picture, which featured the Pittsburgh Pirates. He ran it so many times that the staff said, ‚ÄúPlease, Mr. President, not again.\\" She was the last of the writers to work on the script for Stanley Donen's Seven Brides for Seven Brothers after Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. Their original script was based on the short story The Sobbin' Women by Stephen Vincent Benet, but the script wasn't coming out right.Eyman. 2005. From Kingsley: > \\"Stanley Donen called me in and I looked at the script and said, 'The big > trouble in the original short story is that the Howard Keel character is the > one that tries to get all of these boys married off, and that‚Äôs not right. > The girl has nothing to do, and she‚Äôs got to be the one to engineer all this > stuff.' That was changed around and seemed to please everyone, and we went > from there.\\" After she had been at MGM a while, Kingsley acquired the reputation as a fixer in construction. She would regularly be called down to the set to fix pictures on the fly when the original writers were no longer on the scene to be consulted. The studio kept her working all the time and her contract was continually being extended. =Sinatra= Columbia was set to produce Pal Joey, which was a perfect vehicle for Frank Sinatra; however, Sinatra and Columbia executive Harry Cohn had been feuding for years and didn't speak to each other. Kingsley and Lillian Burns, the assistant to Harry Cohn, did a synopsis of the film written with Sinatra in mind and had it sent to Sinatra without Cohn's involvement. Sinatra agreed to do the picture and Cohn committed without ever seeing the script. Sinatra was so pleased with what Kingsley had done with Pal Joey, he committed to Can-Can without a script. =Later life= In 1969, she was instrumental in creating the Bracken's World series for television, based on the behind-the-scenes activities at the fictitious Century Studios in Hollywood. Kingsley and her second husband, William Durney, left Hollywood for Carmel, California, where they started the Durney Vineyard brand winery. They were among the earliest vintners in the Carmel Valley Wine region when they planted their original vineyards in 1968, with the first wines being produced in 1976. =Death= Dorothy Kingsley died of heart failure in 1997 in Monterey, California.

Birth and career Mattox was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and became a prot√©g√© of the legendary jazz dance pioneer Jack Cole, with whom he worked on Broadway in Magdalena: a Musical Adventure (1948). His other Broadway credits include creating the role of the Jester in the original production of Once Upon a Mattress (1959), and Harry Beaton in the 1957 revival of Brigadoon.Matt Mattox, Internet Broadway Database] (accessed May 16, 2013) Mattox also performed concert engagements with his own dance company. His brief career as a Broadway choreographer included Jennie and Say, Darling. Mattox used his background in ballet technique to create his own technique for jazz dance. His jazz class was assembled in the progression of a ballet class, and he called his exercises \\"the barre\\". Mattox also specifically designed the exercises to relate to the combinations given at the end of his class. The positions, shapes, and qualities developed during the barre are visible within his own detailed and polished style. Mattox had a higher profile as a specialty dancer in Hollywood musicals. His best-known film role is Caleb Pontipee in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, but he was also a principal dancer in, among others, Yolanda and the Thief, The Band Wagon (Cyd Charisse's partner in the ballet sequence), Till the Clouds Roll By, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, and There's No Business Like Show Business. In addition, Mattox was a regular guest on television variety shows, for which he choreographed as well as performed, including The Patti Page Oldsmobile Show,\\" 1958-59 https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910749/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm.

The cat, called Jasso, has a tail that acts as a separate character who has its own mind and is capable of speech. Jasso is the only named character in the entire strip. The strip is based largely on absurd humour which deals with everyday life and on playing around with language. For example, the details of background objects often inexplicably change between panels. Texts written on background objects typically also go through several different spellings, and some small objects such as doorknobs or trashcans may change their shape to a different design.

Ottonian art is a style in pre- romanesque German art, covering also some works from the Low Countries, northern Italy and eastern France. It was named by the art historian Hubert Janitschek after the Ottonian dynasty which ruled Germany and northern Italy between 919 and 1024 under the kings Henry I, Otto I, Otto II, Otto III and Henry II. With Ottonian architecture, it is a key component of the Ottonian Renaissance (circa 951‚Äì1024). However, the style neither began nor ended to neatly coincide with the rule of the dynasty. It emerged some decades into their rule and persisted past the Ottonian emperors into the reigns of the early Salian dynasty, which lacks an artistic \\"style label\\" of its own.Suckale-Redlefsen, 524 In the traditional scheme of art history, Ottonian art follows Carolingian art and precedes Romanesque art, though the transitions at both ends of the period are gradual rather than sudden. Like the former and unlike the latter, it was very largely a style restricted to a few of the small cities of the period, and important monasteries, as well as the court circles of the emperor and his leading vassals. After the decline of the Carolingian Empire, the Holy Roman Empire was re-established under the Saxon Ottonian dynasty. From this emerged a renewed faith in the idea of Empire and a reformed Church, creating a period of heightened cultural and artistic fervour. It was in this atmosphere that masterpieces were created that fused the traditions from which Ottonian artists derived their inspiration: models of Late Antique, Carolingian, and Byzantine origin. Surviving Ottonian art is very largely religious, in the form of illuminated manuscripts and metalwork, and was produced in a small number of centres for a narrow range of patrons in the circle of the Imperial court, as well as important figures in the church. However much of it was designed for display to a wider public, especially of pilgrims.Beckwith, 81‚Äì86; Lasko, 82; Dodwell, 123‚Äì126 The style is generally grand and heavy, sometimes to excess, and initially less sophisticated than the Carolingian equivalents, with less direct influence from Byzantine art and less understanding of its classical models, but around 1000 a striking intensity and expressiveness emerge in many works, as \\"a solemn monumentality is combined with a vibrant inwardness, an unworldly, visionary quality with sharp attention to actuality, surface patterns of flowing lines and rich bright colours with passionate emotionalism\\".Honour and Fleming, 277 Context \\"Roma\\", \\"Gallia\\", \\"Germania\\" and \\"Sclavinia\\" pay homage to Otto III, from the Munich Gospels of Otto III, one of the \\"Liuthar group\\" Following late Carolingian styles, \\"presentation portraits\\" of the patrons of manuscripts are very prominent in Ottonian art,in contrast, there are no surviving contemporary portraits of Charlemagne in manuscripts and much Ottonian art reflected the dynasty's desire to establish visually a link to the Christian rulers of Late Antiquity, such as Constantine, Theoderic, and Justinian as well as to their Carolingian predecessors, particularly Charlemagne. This goal was accomplished in various ways. For example, the many Ottonian ruler portraits typically include elements, such as province personifications, or representatives of the military and the Church flanking the emperor, with a lengthy imperial iconographical history.Dodwell, 123; Imperial portraiture is a major subject in Garrison As well as the reuse of motifs from older imperial art, the removal of spolia from Late Antique structures in Rome and Ravenna and their incorporation into Ottonian buildings was a device intended to suggest imperial continuity. This was clearly the intention of Otto I when he removed columns, some of porphyry, and other building materials from the Palace of Theoderic in Ravenna and reused them in his new cathedral at Magdeburg. The one thing the ruler portraits rarely attempt is a close likeness of the individual features of a ruler; when Otto III died, some manuscript images of him were re-purposed as portraits of Henry II without the need being felt to change the features. In a continuation and intensification of late Carolingian trends, many miniatures contain presentation miniatures depicting the donors of the manuscripts to a church, including bishops, abbots and abbesses, and also the emperor. In some cases successive miniatures show a kind of relay: in the Hornbach Sacramentary the scribe presents the book to his abbot, who presents it to St Pirmin, founder of Hornbach Abbey, who presents it to St Peter, who presents it to Christ, altogether taking up eight pages (with the facing illuminated tablets) to stress the unity and importance of the \\"command structure\\" binding church and state, on earth and in heaven.Solothurn Zentralbibliothek Codex U1 (ex-Cathedral Treasury), folios 7v to 10r; Alexander, 89‚Äì90; Legner, Vol 2, B2, all eight pages illustrated on pp. 140-141; Dodwell, 134; the Egbert Psalter also has four pages of presentation scenes, with two each spread across a full opening. Byzantine art also remained an influence, especially with the marriage of the Greek princess Theophanu to Otto II, and imported Byzantine elements, especially enamels and ivories, are often incorporated into Ottonian metalwork such as book covers. However, if there were actual Greek artists working in Germany in the period, they have left less trace than their predessors in Carolingian times. The manuscripts were both scribed and illuminated by monks with specialized skills,Or so it is usually assumed, but see Suckale-Redlefsen, 98 some of whose names are preserved, but there is no evidence as to the artists who worked in metal, enamel and ivory, who are usually assumed to have been laymen,Metz, 47‚Äì49 though there were some monastic goldsmiths in the Early Medieval period, and some lay brothers and lay assistants employed by monasteries.An area where evidence is generally thin across Europe, see Cherry, Chapter 1 While secular jewellery supplied a steady stream of work for goldsmiths, ivory carving at this period was mainly for the church, and may have been centred in monasteries, although (see below) wall-paintings seems to have been usually done by laymen.

They were a major art form of the time, and monasteries received direct sponsorship from emperors and bishops, having the best in equipment and talent available. The range of heavily illuminated texts was very largely restricted (unlike in the Carolingian Renaissance) to the main liturgical books, with very few secular works being so treated. In contrast to manuscripts of other periods, it is very often possible to say with certainty who commissioned or received a manuscript, but not where it was made. Some manuscripts also include relatively extensive cycles of narrative art, such as the sixteen pages of the Codex Aureus of Echternach devoted to \\"strips\\" in three tiers with scenes from the Life of Christ and his parables.Metz, throughout; Dodwell, 144 Heavily illuminated manuscripts were given rich treasure bindings and their pages were probably seen by very few; when they were carried in the grand processions of Ottonian churches it seems to have been with the book closed to display the cover.Suckale-Redlefsen, 98 The Ottonian style did not produce surviving manuscripts from before about the 960s, when books known as the \\"Eburnant group\\" were made, perhaps at Lorsch, as several miniatures in the Gero Codex (now Darmstadt), the earliest and grandest of the group, copy those in the Carolingian Lorsch Gospels. This is the first stylistic group of the traditional \\"Reichenau school\\". The two other major manuscripts of the group are the sacramentaries named for Hornbach and Petershausen. In the group of four presentation miniatures in the former described above \\"we can almost follow ... the movement away from the expansive Carolingian idiom to the more sharply defined Ottonian one\\".Dodwell, 134, quoted; Beckwith, 92‚Äì93; compare the St John portraits in the Gero Codex and the Lorsch Gospels the Annunciation to the shepherds from the Pericopes of Henry II, \\"Liuthar group\\" of the \\"Reichenau school\\" A number of important manuscripts produced from this period onwards in a distinctive group of styles are usually attributed to the scriptorium of the island monastery of Reichenau in Lake Constance, despite an admitted lack of evidence connecting them to the monastery there. C. R. Dodwell was one of a number of dissident voices here, believing the works to have been produced at Lorsch and Trier instead.Dodwell, 130, with his full views in: C.R. Dodwell et D. H. Turner (eds.), Reichenau reconsidered. A Re-assessment of the Place of Reichenau in Ottonian Art, 1965, Warburg Surveys, 2, of which Backhouse is a review. See Backhouse, 98 for German scholars dubious about the traditional Reichenau school. Garrison, 15, supports the traditional view. Wherever it was located, the \\"Reichenau school\\" specialized in gospel books and other liturgical books, many of them, such as the Munich Gospels of Otto III (c. 1000) and the Pericopes of Henry II (Munich, Bayerische Nationalbibl. clm. 4452, c. 1001‚Äì1024), imperial commissions. Due to their exceptional quality, the manuscripts of Reichenau were in 2003 added to the UNESCO Memory of the World International Register. The most important \\"Reichenau school\\" manuscripts are agreed to fall into three distinct groups, all named after scribes whose names are recorded in their books.Or at any rate, monks depicted and named in them. Whether these would actually have been the main scribes of the text is discussed by Mayr- Harting, 229 The \\"Eburnant group\\" covered above was followed by the \\"Ruodprecht group\\" named after the scribe of the Egbert Psalter; Dodwell assigns this group to Trier. The Aachen Gospels of Otto III, also known as the Liuthar Gospels, give their name to the third \\"Liuthar group\\" of manuscripts, most from the 11th century, in a strongly contrasting style, though still attributed by most scholars to Reichenau, but by Dodwell also to Trier.Dodwell, 134‚Äì144; Backhouse, throughout, is rather sceptical about Trier as a major centre; Beckwith, 96‚Äì104 stresses the mobility of illuminators. The outstanding miniaturist of the \\"Ruodprecht group\\" was the so-called Master of the Registrum Gregorii, or Gregory Master, whose work looked back in some respects to Late Antique manuscript painting, and whose miniatures are notable for \\"their delicate sensibility to tonal grades and harmonies, their fine sense of compositional rhythms, their feelings for the relationship of figures in space, and above all their special touch of reticence and poise\\".Dodwell, 141‚Äì142, 141 quoted; Lasko, 106‚Äì107 He worked chiefly in Trier in the 970s and 980s, and was responsible for several miniatures in the influential Codex Egberti, a gospel lectionary made for Archbishop Egbert of Trier, probably in the 980s. However, the majority of the 51 images in this book, which represent the first extensive cycle of images depicting the events of Christ's life in a western European manuscript, were made by two monks from Reichenau, who are named and depicted in one of the miniatures.Dodwell, 134‚Äì142 The style of the \\"Liuthar group\\" is very different, and departs further from rather than returning to classical traditions; it \\"carried transcendentalism to an extreme\\", with \\"marked schematization of the forms and colours\\", \\"flattened form, conceptualized draperies and expansive gesture\\".Beckwith, 104, 102 Backgrounds are often composed of bands of colour with a symbolic rather than naturalistic rationale, the size of figures reflects their importance, and in them \\"emphasis is not so much on movement as in gesture and glance\\", with narrative scenes \\"presented as a quasi-liturgical act, dialogues of divinity\\".Beckwith, 108‚Äì110, both quoted This gestural \\"dumb-show [was] soon to be conventionalized as a visual language throughout medieval Europe\\". The group were produced perhaps from the 990s to 1015 or later, and major manuscripts include the Munich Gospels of Otto III, the Bamberg Apocalypse and a volume of biblical commentary there, and the Pericopes of Henry II, the best known and most extreme of the group, where \\"the figure-style has become more monumental, more rarified and sublime, at the same time thin in density, insubstantial, mere silhouettes of colour against a shimmering void\\".Beckwith, 112 The group introduced the background of solid gold to Western illumination. Labourers in the vineyard, from the Codex Aureus of Echternach Two dedication miniatures added to the Egmond Gospels around 975 show a less accomplished Netherlandish version of Ottonian style. In Regensburg St. Emmeram's Abbey held the major Carolingian Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram, which probably influenced a style with \\"an incisive line and highly formal organization of the page\\", giving in the Uta Codex of c. 1020 complex schemes where \\"bands of gold outline the bold, squares circles, ellipses, and rhombs that enclose the figures\\", and inscriptions are incorporated in the design explicating its complex theological symbolism. This style was to be very influential on Romanesque art in several media.Dodwell, 151‚Äì153; Garrison, 16-18 Echternach Abbey became important under Abbot Humbert, in office from 1028 to 1051, and the pages (as opposed to the cover) of the Codex Aureus of Echternach were produced there, followed by the Golden Gospels of Henry III in 1045‚Äì46, which Henry presented to Speyer Cathedral (now Escorial), the major work of the school. Henry also commissioned the Uppsala Gospels for the cathedral there (now in the university library).Dodwell, 144‚Äì146 Other important monastic scriptoria that flourished during the Ottonian age include those at Salzburg,Dodwell, 153‚Äì15 Hildesheim, Corvey, Fulda, and Cologne, where the Hitda Codex was made.Dodwell, 130‚Äì156 covers the whole period, as does Beckwith, 92‚Äì124; Legner's three volumes have catalogue entries on considerable numbers of manuscripts made in Cologne, or now located there. =Gallery of Christ calming the storm= This scene was often included in Ottonian cycles of the Life of Christ. Many show Jesus (with crossed halo) twice, once asleep and once calming the storm.

Beckwith, 138‚Äì145 This was a much older style, but the Ottonian version has distinctive features, with very busy decoration of surfaces, often gems raised up from the main surface on little gold towers, accompanied by \\"beehive\\" projections in gold wire, and figurative reliefs in repouss√© gold decorating areas between the bars of enamel and gem decoration. Relics were assuming increasing importance, sometimes political, in this period, and so increasingly rich reliquaries were made to hold them.Lasko, 94‚Äì95; Henderson, 15, 202‚Äì214; see Head for an analysis of the political significance of reliquaries commissioned by Egbert of Trier. In such works the gems do not merely create an impression of richness, but served both to offer a foretaste of the bejewelled nature of the Celestial city, and particular types of gem were believed to have actual powerful properties in various \\"scientific\\", medical and magical respects, as set out in the popular lapidary books.Metz, 26‚Äì30. The few surviving pieces of secular jewellery are in similar styles, including the crown worn by Otto III as a child, which he presented to the Golden Madonna of Essen after he outgrew it.Lasko, 94-95; also this brooch in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Examples of crux gemmata or processional crosses include an outstanding group in the Essen Cathedral Treasury; several abbesses of Essen Abbey were Ottonian princesses. The Cross of Otto and Mathilde, Cross of Mathilde and the Essen cross with large enamels were probably all given by Mathilde, Abbess of Essen (died 1011), and a fourth cross, the Theophanu Cross came some fifty years later.Lasko, 99‚Äì109; Beckwith, 138‚Äì142 The Cross of Lothair (Aachen) and Imperial Cross (Vienna) were imperial possessions; Vienna also has the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire. The book cover of the Codex Aureus of Echternach (Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg) is in a very comparable style.Metz, 59‚Äì60; Lasko, 98; Beckwith, 133‚Äì134. Other major objects include a reliquary of St Andrew surmounted by a foot in Trier,Henderson, 15; Lasko, 96‚Äì98; Head. and gold altar frontals for the Palace Chapel, Aachen and Basel Cathedral (now in Paris).Lasko, 129‚Äì131; Beckwith, 144‚Äì145. The Palace Chapel also has the pulpit or Ambon of Henry II. The late Carolingian upper cover of the Lindau Gospels (Morgan Library, New York) and the Arnulf Ciborium in Munich were important forerunners of the style, from a few decades before and probably from the same workshop.Lasko, 64‚Äì66; Beckwith, 50, 80. Wedding at Cana on the Bernward Column Large objects in non-precious metals were also made, with the earliest surviving wheel chandeliers from the end of the period, a huge candelabra in Essen, and in particular a spectacular collection of ambitious large bronze works, and smaller silver ones, at Hildesheim Cathedral from the period of Bishop Bernward (died 1022), who was himself an artist, although his biographer was unusually honest in saying that he did not reach \\"the peaks of perfection\\". The most famous of these is the pair of church doors, the Bernward Doors, with biblical figure scenes in bronze relief, each cast in a single piece, where the powerfully simple compositions convey their meanings by emphatic gestures, in a way comparable to the Reichenau miniatures of the same period.Lasko, 111‚Äì123, 119 quoted; Beckwith, 145‚Äì149 There is also a bronze column, the Bernward Column, over twelve feet high, originally the base for a crucifix, cast in a single hollow piece. This unusual form is decorated with twenty-four scenes from the ministry of Jesus in a continuous strip winding round the column in the manner of Trajan's Column and other Roman examples.Lasko, 120-122 Around 980, Archbishop Egbert of Trier seems to have established the major Ottonian workshop producing cloisonn√© enamel in Germany, which is thought to have fulfilled orders for other centres, and after his death in 993 possibly moved to Essen. During this period the workshop followed Byzantine developments (of many decades earlier) by using the senkschmelz or \\"sunk enamel\\" technique in addition to the vollschmelz one already used. Small plaques with decorative motifs derived from plant forms continued to use vollschmelz, with enamel all over the plaque, while figures were now usually in senkschmelz, surrounded by a plain gold surface into which the outline of the figure had been recessed. The Essen cross with large enamels illustrated above shows both these techniques.Lasko, 95‚Äì106; Beckwith, 138‚Äì142 =Gallery of bronzes= File:SiebenarmigerLeuchter bearb.jpgAbbess Mathilde's candelabrum in Essen Cathedral, c. 1000 File:Bernwardst√ºr (7).JPGExpulsion of Adam and Eve from Bernward Doors at Hildesheim Cathedral File:Hildesheim-Dom- Bernwardstuer 01+.JPGBernward's doors at Hildesheim Cathedral, c. 1015 File:Christuss√§ule 2.jpgThe bronze Bernward Column at Hildesheim Ivory carving The \\"dedication\\" panel, one of the Magdeburg Ivories Much very fine small-scale sculpture in ivory was made during the Ottonian period, with Milan probably a site if not the main centre, along with Trier and other German and French sites. There are many oblong panels with reliefs which once decorated book-covers, or still do, with the Crucifixion of Jesus as the most common subject. These and other subjects very largely continue Carolingian iconography, but in a very different style.Beckwith, 126‚Äì138; Lasko, 78‚Äì79, 94, 106‚Äì108, 112, 131, as well as the passages cited below A group of four Ottonian ivory situlae appear to represent a new departure for ivory carving in their form, and the type is hardly found after this period. Situlae were liturgical vessels used to hold holy water, and previously were usually of wood or bronze, straight-sided and with a handle. An aspergillum was dipped in the situla to collect water with which to sprinkle the congregation or other objects. However the four Ottonian examples from the 10th century are made from a whole section of elephant tusk, and are slightly larger in girth at their tops. All are richly carved with scenes and figures on different levels: the Basilewsky Situla of 920 in the Victoria & Albert Museum, decorated with scenes from the Life of Christ on two levels,Basilewsky Situla V&A; Museum the \\"Situla of Gotofredo\\" of c. 980 in Milan Cathedral,image of Milan situla one in the Aachen Cathedral Treasury, and one in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.Metropolitan Museum example All came from the milieu of the Ottonian court: an inscription says that Archbishop Gotfredus presented the Milan example in anticipation of a visit by the Emperor,Lasko, 92-3 also referred to in the London example which was possibly from the same workshop.Williamson, 26, though Lasko, 92 disagrees with this. The latest and most lavish is the Aachen example, which is studded with jewels and shows an enthroned Emperor, surrounded by a pope and archbishops. This was probably made in Trier about 1000.All except the New York situla are illustrated and discussed in Beckwith, pp. 129‚Äì130, 135‚Äì136 Among various stylistic groups and putative workshops that can be detected, that responsible for pieces including the panel from the cover of the Codex Aureus of Echternach and two diptych wings now in Belin (all illustrated below) produced particularly fine and distinctive work, perhaps in Trier, with \\"an astonishing perception of the human form ... [and] facility in handling the material\\".Beckwith, 133-136, 135-136 quoted A very important group of plaques, now dispersed in several collections, were probably commissioned (perhaps by Otto I) for Magdeburg Cathedral and are called the Magdeburg Ivories, \\"Magdeburg plaques\\", the \\"plaques from the Magdeburg Antependium\\" or similar names. They were probably made in Milan in about 970, to decorate a large flat surface, though whether this was a door, an antependium or altar frontal, the cover of an exceptionally large book, a pulpit, or something else, has been much discussed. Each nearly square plaque measures about 13x12 cm, with a relief scene from the Life of Christ inside a plain flat frame; one plaque in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York has a \\"dedication\\" scene, where a crowned monarch presents Christ with a model church, usually taken to be Otto I with Magdeburg Cathedral. Altogether seventeen survive, probably fewer than half of the original set. The plaques include background areas fully cut through the ivory, which would presumably originally have been backed with gold. Apart from the spaces left beside buildings, these openwork elements include some that leave chequerboard or foliage patterns.Lasko, 87‚Äì91; Williamson, 12; Beckwith, 126‚Äì129. On the function of the original object, Williamson favours a door, Lasko leans towards a pulpit, and Beckwith an antependium, but none seem emphatic in their preference. The style of the figures is described by Peter Lasko as \\"very heavy, stiff, and massive ... with extremely clear and flat treatment of drapery ... in simple but powerful compositions\\".Lasko, 89 File:VA23Oct10 090-crop.jpgThe Basilewsky Situla File:Trier 10 Jh Diptychon Moses Thomas.jpgDiptych panels of Moses Receiving the Law and Doubting Thomas File:Coperta del codex aureus, treviri, 985-987, 02.JPGPanel from the cover of the Codex Aureus of Echternach, probably from the same workshop as the diptych.

Generally they lack evidence to help with dating such as donor portraits, and their date is often uncertain; many have been restored in the past, further complicating the matter. Most survivals are clustered in south Germany and around Fulda in Hesse; though there are also important examples from north Italy.Dodwell, 127‚Äì128; Beckwith, 88‚Äì92 There is a record of bishop Gebhard of Constance hiring lay artists for a now vanished cycle at his newly foundation (983) of Petershausen Abbey, and laymen may have dominated the art of wall- painting, though perhaps sometimes working to designs by monastic illuminators. The artists seem to have been rather mobile: \\"at about the time of the Oberzell pictures there was an Italian wall-painter working in Germany, and a German one in England\\".Dodwell, 130; the Italian was \\"Johannes Italicus\\", who one scholar has identified with the Gregory Master, see Beckwith, 103 The church of St George at Oberzell on Reichenau Island has the best-known surviving scheme, though much of the original work has been lost and the remaining paintings to the sides of the nave have suffered from time and restoration. The largest scenes show the miracles of Christ in a style that both shows specific Byzantine input in some elements, and a closeness to Reichenau manuscripts such as the Munich Gospels of Otto III; they are therefore usually dated around 980‚Äì1000. Indeed, the paintings are one of the foundations of the case for Reichenau Abbey as a major centre of manuscript painting.Dodwell, 128‚Äì130; Beckwith, 88‚Äì92; Backhouse, 100 Larger sculpture Gero Cross, c. 965‚Äì970, Cologne Cathedral Very little wood carving has survived from the period, but the monumental painted figure of Christ on the Gero Cross (around 965‚Äì970, Cologne Cathedral) is one of the outstanding masterpieces of the period. Its traditional dating by the church, long thought to be implausibly early, was finally confirmed by dendrochronology.Beckwith, 142; Lauer, Rolf, in Legner, III, 142 (in German) The Golden Madonna of Essen (about 1000, Essen Cathedral, which was formerly the abbey) is a virtually unique survival of a type of object once found in many major churches. It is a smaller sculpture of the Virgin and Child, which is in wood which was covered with gesso and then thin gold sheet.Beckwith, 150‚Äì152 Lasko, 104 Monumental sculpture remained rare in the north, though there are more examples in Italy, such as the stucco reliefs on the ciborium of Sant' Ambrogio, Milan, and also on that in San Pietro al Monte, Civate, which relate to ivory carving of the same period,Beckwith, 132 and some stone sculpture. Survival and historiography Surviving Ottonian works are very largely those in the care of the church which were kept and valued for their connections with either royal or church figures of the period. Very often the jewels in metalwork were pilfered or sold over the centuries, and many pieces now completely lack them, or have modern glass paste replacements. As from other periods, there are many more surviving ivory panels (whose material is usually hard to re-use) for book-covers than complete metalwork covers, and some thicker ivory panels were later re-carved from the back with a new relief.For example, Legner, Vol 2 pp. 238-240, no. E32, where a largely rubbed-down 6th-century Byzantine bookcover plaque has on the original back a Cologne relief of c. 1000 (Schn√ºtgen Museum, Inv. B 98). Many objects mentioned in written sources have completely disappeared, and we probably now only have a tiny fraction of the original production of reliquaries and the like. A number of pieces have major additions or changes made later in the Middle Ages or in later periods. Manuscripts that avoided major library fires have had the best chance of survival; the dangers facing wall-paintings are mentioned above. Most major objects remain in German collections, often still church libraries and treasuries. The term \\"Ottonian art\\" was not coined until 1890, and the following decade saw the first serious studies of the period; for the next several decades the subject was dominated by German art historians mainly dealing with manuscripts,Suckale-Redlefsen, 524‚Äì525 apart from Adolph Goldschmidt's studies of ivories and sculpture in general. A number of exhibitions held in Germany in the years following World War II helped introduce the subject to a wider public and promote the understanding of art media other than manuscript illustrations. The 1950 Munich exhibition Ars Sacra (\\"sacred art\\" in Latin) devised this term for religious metalwork and the associated ivories and enamels, which was re-used by Peter Lasko in his book for the Pelican History of Art, the first survey of the subject written in English, as the usual art-historical term, the \\"minor arts\\", seemed unsuitable for this period, where they were, with manuscript miniatures, the most significant art forms.Suckale-Redlefsen, 524; Lasko, xxii lists a number of the exhibitions up to 1972. In 2003 a reviewer noted that Ottonian manuscript illustration was a field \\"that is still significantly under- represented in English-language art-historical research\\".

As a young man he showed particular skill at Gaelic games, winning four Dublin County Senior Hurling Championships with the St Vincents GAA club, having earlier captained the school team of St. Joseph's Secondary C.B.S., Fairview which brought the All-Ireland Colleges football title to Dublin for the first time. Foley captained the Dublin minor football team which won the All-Ireland Final in 1958. In 1962 he became the only player in history to play in two provincial Railway Cup finals, in hurling and football, on the same day, winning medals in both codes for Leinster. He won further Railway Cup medals again in 1964 and 1965. Foley was a prominent member of the Dublin county hurling team from 1958 until 1969, playing on the losing side in the 1961 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final. In 1963 he captained the Dublin county football team which defeated Galway to win the All-Ireland title. He won three All-Star awards, two for football and one for hurling, but never a senior All-Ireland hurling medal. He was a mid-fielder of the highest ranking, particularly noted for his outstanding sportsmanship.

In 2002 the United States Department of Defense dismantled the Chemical Research Institute, the major research and testing site for the Novichok agent, under a $6 million Cooperative Threat Reduction program. Sights A panoramic view of Nukus Nukus is host to the Nukus Museum of Art (also known as the State Art Museum of the Republic of Karakalpakstan, named after Igor Savitsky) and State Museum. The State Museum houses the usual collection of artifacts recovered from archaeological investigations, traditional jewelry, costumes and musical instruments, displays of the area's now vanished or endangered flora and fauna, and on the Aral Sea issue. The Art Museum is noted for its collection of modern Russian and Uzbek art from 1918‚Äì1935. Stalin tried his best to eliminate all non Soviet art from this period, and sent most of the artists to the gulag. Both Savitsky himself and the collection at Nukus survived because the city's remoteness limited the influence and reach of Soviet authorities. The documentary film The Desert of Forbidden Art is all about the collection and its history.Tom Bissell, Chasing the Sea, Pantheon (2003). . p. 323‚Äì324. Nukus is also home to the Amet and Ayimkhan Shamuratovs house museum, a hub for Karakalpak music and oral culture. The museum's collection represents personal belongings of the Shamuratovs including stage clothes, photographs, manuscripts, books, letters. Climate Nukus experiences a cold desert climate (K√∂ppen BWk) with summers that are long, dry and very hot, and winters that are short, though quite cold and snowy, having a very dry type of a continental climate.

His first solo albums, Iyole in 1981 and Djessy in 1982, were hits. He is known for the structural changes he implemented to soukous music. The previous approach was to sing several verses and have one guitar solo at the end of the song. Kanda Bongo Man revolutionized soukous by encouraging guitar solos after every verse and even sometimes at the beginning of the song. His form of soukous gave birth to the kwassa kwassa dance rhythm where the hips move back and forth while the hands move to follow the hips. Like many African rumba and soukous musicians before him, Kanda Bongo Man also had an entourage of musicians. Many of Kanda's musicians later moved on to start their own solo careers.

Today, the bureau's operations involve improving child abuse prevention, foster care, and adoption. Historically, its work was much broader, as shown by the 1912 act which created and funded it: > The said bureau shall investigate and report to [the Department of Commerce > and Labor] upon all matters pertaining to the welfare of children and child > life among all classes of our people, and shall especially investigate the > questions of infant mortality, the birth-rate, orphanage, juvenile courts, > desertion, dangerous occupations, accidents and diseases of children, > employment, legislation affecting children in the several states and > territories.Apr. 9, 1912, ch. 73, ¬ß2, 37 Stat. 79 During the height of its influence, the Bureau was directed, managed, and staffed almost entirely by women‚Äîa rarity for any federal agency in the early 20th century. It was most influential in bringing the methods of reform- oriented social research and the ideas of maternalist reformers to bear on federal government policy. New Deal legislation, including the Fair Labor Standards Act and Aid to Dependent Children programs, incorporated many reforms that the Children's Bureau and its network of grassroots women's organizations had supported for years. By the time the Children's Bureau was folded into the Social Security Administration in 1946, it began to assume more of its modern role.Kriste Lindenmeyer, \\"A right to childhood\\": the U.S. Children's Bureau and child welfare, 1912-46 (University of Illinois Press, 1997), 30. History =Creation= Most accounts of the Children's Bureau's origins point to three people, Lillian Wald, Edward Thomas Devine, and Florence Kelley, who began to discuss the idea around 1903. Their proposal (with colleagues) to President Theodore Roosevelt in 1905 reflected the Progressive Era's generally heightened concern for social welfare issues, as well as the influence of the Settlement movement, of which all three were members.Kriste Lindenmeyer, \\"A right to childhood\\": The U.S. Children's Bureau and child welfare, 1912-46 (University of Illinois Press, 1997), 9. Also in 1905, the recently formed National Child Labor Committee (NCLC) agreed to make the establishment of a federal children's bureau its primary legislative goal. The NCLC's effort was supported by women's groups such as the National Consumers League, the General Federation of Women's Clubs, the National Congress of Mothers, and the Daughters of the American Revolution. The proposal also was endorsed by attendees of the first White House Conference on Children and Youth in 1909.Lindenmeyer, 20-24. The bill establishing the Children's Bureau was passed in 1912 following a lengthy legislative effort, and it was signed by President William Howard Taft on April 9 of that year. The Children's Bureau became the first national government office in the world that focused solely on the well-being of children and their mothers. Taft appointed Julia Lathrop as the first head of the Bureau. Lathrop, a noted maternalist reformer also active in the Settlement Movement, was the first woman ever to head a government agency in the United States. At its founding, the bureau was part of the Department of Commerce and Labor; when the two departments' functions were separated in 1913, it became part of the Department of Labor. =1912‚Äì1920= The Children's Bureau's first efforts focused on decreasing infant mortality by determining how many babies were dying, through expanded birth registration efforts, and understanding why so many babies died before their first birthday. The Bureau completed birth registration campaigns and conducted infant mortality studies in 10 cities between 1914 and 1921. These studies revealed strong connections between poverty and infant deaths. The Bureau's commitment to fighting infant mortality resonated with the proliferation of \\"baby-saving\\" campaigns throughout the country at this time. The Bureau endorsed activities such as prenatal care, infant health clinics, visiting nurses, public sanitation, certified milk stations, and education of mothers.Lindenmeyer, 49-50. It proclaimed a \\"Children's Year\\" beginning April 6, 1918, to protect children from shortages of milk, food, and public health nurses during World War I. As part of this effort, volunteers weighed and measured millions of children, resulting in the publication of the nation's first age, height, and weight standards. In its first few years, the Children's Bureau published several pamphlets about prenatal, infant, and child care. These booklets were soon in high demand. By 1929, the Bureau estimated that the information in its pamphlets had benefited one-half of all U.S. babies.Molly Ladd-Taylor, Raising a Baby the Government Way: Mothers' Letters to the Children's Bureau, 1915-1932, (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1986), 2. In 1914 Emma Octavia Lundberg became the first Director of the Social Services Division of the Children's Bureau. Child labor became a focus of the Children's Bureau's efforts beginning around 1915. Between 1915 and 1930, the Bureau published 31 studies examining children's working conditions by visiting child laborers in their homes and workplaces. These studies helped to reveal the prevalence and nature of child labor in the United States. In 1916, Congress passed the Keating-Owen Act, which discouraged child labor. Congress assigned the Children's Bureau the responsibilities of administering and enforcing this law. Chief Lathrop hired noted child-labor reformer Grace Abbott to lead the Bureau's newly created Child Labor Division in April 1917; however, the law was short-lived. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled it unconstitutional in June 1918. =1921‚Äì1929= In August 1921, Lathrop stepped down as Chief, and Grace Abbott was appointed to succeed her.Lindenmeyer, 90-91. The Children's Bureau played a major role in the passage and administration of the Sheppard‚ÄìTowner Act. This law, passed in 1921, authorized the first federal grants-in-aid for state-level children's health programs. Projects in most states included some or all of the following: * Midwife training programs, licensing, and enforcement * Parent education through traveling health demonstrations, health centers, home visits, correspondence courses, and classes * Establishment of standards and licensing procedures for maternity homes * Data collection on maternal and infant mortality The program ended in 1929, having helped an estimated 4 million infants and preschool children and approximately 700,000 pregnant women.Lindenmeyer, 104. Maternal and infant care and child labor were the Bureau's primary focus during its first two decades. However, other topics of research included juvenile delinquency, mother's aid, illegitimacy, foster care, and children's diseases.Lindenmeyer, 139. Notably: * In 1923, a Children's Bureau-appointed committee established the first-ever standards for effective juvenile courts. * A 1926 bulletin summarizing the history and current state of mothers' aid legislation helped lay the groundwork for the Aid to Dependent Children provisions in the 1935 Social Security Act. * The 1920s saw an increased focus on state and county child welfare services. The Bureau published Foster-Home Care for Dependent Children in 1923.Bradbury, 33‚Äì34, 36. * The Children's Bureau conducted a study of rickets, in partnership with the Yale School of Medicine and the New Haven, Connecticut, Department of Health, that demonstrated the effectiveness of simple prevention methods.Bradbury, 26‚Äì27. =1930‚Äì1939= During the early years of the Great Depression, under President Herbert Hoover, the Children's Bureau helped with government efforts to document families' needs and local relief efforts.Bradbury, 29-31. When Congress established the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) in May 1933, the Children's Bureau helped to collect data for the agency to determine how the appropriations would be spent. The Bureau also worked with the FERA to establish the Child Health Recovery Program, providing emergency food and medical care to children in need.Lindenmeyer, 177-178. In December 1934, Katherine Lenroot succeeded Abbott as Chief of the Bureau. She held this position until 1952. Lenroot, Martha May Eliot, and Grace Abbott worked together to create the child-focused sections of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Social Security bill:Lindenmeyer, 179-183. * Aid to Dependent Children provided federal matching grants for local and state mothers' aid programs. * Maternal and Child Health Care funded clinics, professional education, and medical care for needy children. * Crippled Children's Services created federal matching grants to help children with physical disabilities. * Child Welfare Services provided state grants to address the needs of dependent and neglected children. When the Social Security Act was signed in 1935, the Children's Bureau was granted authority to administer the last three of these programs. (Aid to Dependent Children was administered by the newly established Social Security Board.) The Bureau grew from distributing $337,371 in 1930 to dispensing nearly $11 million in grants by the end of the decade; its staff grew from 143 to more than 400.Lindenmeyer, 193-194. In the meantime, the Children's Bureau remained active in the campaign against child labor. In 1933, the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) opened the door for the Bureau to establish industry- specific child labor codes and the first federal minimum age for full-time employment. The NIRA was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in May 1935. Many of its provisions, however, were recreated in the Fair Labor Standards Act passed three years later.Lindenmeyer, 196-198. =1940‚Äì1956= Throughout World War II, the Children's Bureau continued to promote the well- being of U.S. children through activities such as developing standards for day care for children of working mothers and a campaign to focus attention on children's physical and emotional needs during the war.Lindenmeyer, 223. Meanwhile, the Bureau worked with the U.S. Committee for the Care of European Children to maintain a central register of unaccompanied refugee children arriving in the United States, to oversee their placement with agencies and foster families, and to establish standards for their care. The Children's Bureau's wartime Emergency Maternity and Infant Care (EMIC) program provided for medical, hospital, and nursing care for wives and babies of men in the four lowest pay grades of the Armed Forces. At the time, EMIC was the largest federally funded medical care program ever undertaken in the United States, serving approximately 1.5 million women and babies between 1943 and 1949.Bradbury, 65-68. In 1946, the Children's Bureau was folded into the Social Security Administration as part of a massive postwar reorganization of the federal government. In this reorganization, the Bureau lost authority over all labor-related programs. On September 4, 1951, Martha May Eliot became the Bureau's fourth Chief. In 1952, the Bureau formed the Special Juvenile Delinquency Project with foundations and other private partners interested in improving the prevention and treatment of delinquency. The Project sponsored public meetings and collaborated on a series of practice guides and professional standards. When the project ended in 1955, the Bureau's work in this area continued through a newly created Division of Juvenile Delinquency Service.Bradbury, 78‚Äì79 and 88‚Äì90. The Children's Bureau's grant-in-aid programs grew significantly in the decade following World War II: * In maternal and child health, a growing emphasis was placed on preventing premature births and preserving these fragile infants' health. * Bureau-funded programs helped to develop treatment options to keep children with disabilities within their own families, schools, and communities. The Crippled Children's Program expanded its reach to help children with hearing loss, cerebral palsy, cleft palate, burns, epilepsy, congenital heart defects, and other disabilities. * Beginning in 1946, federal child welfare funds began to support children in foster care. At the same time, a growing emphasis was placed on providing services, including homemaker services, to help keep families together. =1957‚Äì1968= President Dwight D. Eisenhower named Katherine Oettinger the fifth Chief of the Children's Bureau on May 17, 1957.Bradbury, 96. Oettinger's tenure as Chief (1957‚Äì1968) reflected a growing emphasis on preserving and strengthening families. Under her direction, the Bureau also advocated for greater protection for all parties in an adoption. It was during this period that the Bureau's first research and demonstration grants in child welfare were authorized. Early topics included methods for meeting the needs of disadvantaged preschool children and their families (a precursor to the Head Start Program), selection of foster parents, and the well-being of adopted children and their families. In 1962, amendments to the Social Security Act authorized the Children's Bureau to make its first child welfare training grants to institutions of higher education. The focus on maternal and infant health programs continued throughout the 1960s. The Children's Bureau provided early national leadership in the diagnosis and treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU) to prevent mental retardation. Other special health care projects during this period included prosthetics research, epilepsy treatment, and dissemination of vaccines for polio and other childhood diseases. The Children's Bureau also contributed to a growing awareness of child abuse, or \\"battered child syndrome\\" as it was called in the early 1960s. The Bureau held meetings with experts and drafted a model statute that states could use to require doctors and hospitals to report suspected abuse. All states enacted some form of this law by the end of 1967. The Bureau also funded grants to research causes of child abuse and effective prevention methods. In January 1963, the Children's Bureau was moved from the Social Security Administration to the newly created Welfare Administration, reflecting a growing emphasis on coordination between child welfare services and the ADC program. In keeping with President Lyndon B. Johnson's priorities, the Bureau's work on juvenile delinquency began to evolve into a focus on prevention and positive youth development. A Youth Services Unit was created in 1966 to encourage more proactive services to help youth transition successfully into adulthood. At the same time, the Children's Bureau continued to study ways to improve the effectiveness of juvenile court systems. In 1967, the Bureau released a revised version of its Standards for Juvenile and Family Courts. These standards, emphasizing the importance of due process for youth offenders, were cited in the groundbreaking in re Gault decision that year.Children's Bureau, \\"The Children's Bureau's Job Today\\" (1969) =1969‚Äì1979= On September 17, 1969, the Children's Bureau was moved to a new Office of Child Development (OCD) within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's Office of the Secretary. At that time, many of the Bureau's responsibilities were assigned to other areas of the federal government. All health programs, including maternal and child health services, crippled children's services, maternity and infant care projects, and health research, were permanently relocated to the Public Health Service within the Health Services and Mental Health Administration. Today, these programs still exist within the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Children's Bureau continued to administer research but was no longer responsible for any direct service programs, including those related to juvenile delinquency, child welfare, or families in the AFDC program. This reorganization essentially narrowed the Bureau's focus to three areas: increasing the number of foster families, helping to find permanent families for children waiting for adoption, and preventing and addressing child abuse and neglect. In response to rising numbers of children in foster care, Children's Bureau grants during the 1970s investigated in-home services to strengthen families, family-centered casework, permanency planning, family reunification, the needs of children living with relatives, and how to remove barriers to adoption for children with special needs. The Bureau also examined the impact of workforce issues on the foster care system and supported a growing foster parents' movement through conferences and grants. In adoption policy, the Children's Bureau's focus shifted from finding children for families to finding parents for children. Increased attention was paid to the growing number of hard-to-place children, including those from minority groups, older children, children with disabilities, and sibling groups. The Bureau supported exploration of nontraditional adoption arrangements, such as cross-cultural, transracial, single-parent, and subsidized adoption. Passage of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) of 1974 created a National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN) within the Children's Bureau. NCCAN centralized and coordinated the Bureau's growing focus on more effective child abuse prevention, research, state reporting laws, and systems. =1980‚Äì1992= President Jimmy Carter signed the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act on June 17, 1980. This landmark law assigned the Children's Bureau additional responsibilities, including reporting to Congress on foster care placements, collecting and publishing data on foster care and adoption, and conducting regular audits of state child welfare programs.Barbara A. Pine, \\"Child Welfare Reform and the Political Process,\\" Social Service Review 60, no. 3 (1986). During President Ronald Reagan's administration, there was a continued emphasis on family-based services, special needs adoption, and child abuse prevention. Some notable examples of the Bureau's projects during the 1980s include proclamations of the first National Child Abuse Prevention Month and National Adoption Week, establishment of a National Adoption Information Clearinghouse, and creation of the Children's Justice Act program to help states improve their handling of child abuse cases, with a particular emphasis on child sexual abuse. Both of the Children's Bureau's present-day data collection systems, the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) and the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS), were developed during this period. Enhanced data collection resulted in a deeper understanding of the families and children affected by child abuse and neglect, foster care, and adoption. This led to legislative and policy changes during the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the establishment of a federal program to support independent living services for youth aging out of the foster care system without permanent families. In response to the HIV and crack cocaine epidemics, Congress created the Abandoned Infants Assistance program in 1988. On April 15, 1991, today's Administration for Children and Families was created within the Department of Health and Human Services, encompassing ACYF and the Children's Bureau. The same year, NCCAN was moved out from within the Children's Bureau and became a separate entity within ACYF.Implementation of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1988 by the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Select Education, Committee on Education and Labor, House of Representatives (May 9, 1991) (statement by Joseph F. Delfico, Director of Income Security Issues, Human Resources Division), 3; and follow-up testimony on February 27, 1992. Chiefs during this period included: * John Calhoun (1980‚Äì81) * Clarence E. Hodges (1981‚Äì84) * Dodie Truman Livingston (1984‚Äì89) * Wade Horn (1989‚Äì93) =1993‚Äìpresent= President Bill Clinton signed the Family Preservation and Support Services Program Act on August 10, 1993, as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66). The family preservation program, administered by the Children's Bureau, authorized services to help families in crisis (such as respite care and intensive in- home assistance), as well as other forms of family support and family reunification. P.L. 103-66 also established the Court Improvement Program, through which the Children's Bureau provides grants to improve state courts' handling of child welfare cases, and provided additional funds for states to improve their child welfare data collection systems. Growing awareness of the problem of child abuse and neglect, and particularly child deaths, resulted in many enhancements to prevention, investigation, and prosecution efforts. In 1996, the Children's Bureau created a new program, the Community-Based Family Resource and Support grants, to encourage public and private child abuse prevention and treatment programs to work together more effectively. In 1995, the Children's Bureau convened an Adoption Program Network to provide input on a new National Adoption Strategic Plan. Around the same time, President Clinton encouraged HHS to develop a plan for doubling the number of adoptions and permanent placements from foster care during the next five years. HHS responded by issuing a report, with the Bureau's assistance, that outlined a series of policy- and practice-related steps toward achieving this goal. These recommendations became the framework for the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA, P.L. 105-89), signed by President Clinton on November 19, 1997. The Children's Bureau was tasked with helping states bring their laws and policies into compliance with this new federal law, which focused on timely permanence, child well-being, and increased accountability of child welfare systems. ASFA also required HHS to establish outcome measures to track State performance in protecting children. These measures were used in a series of annual reports on national outcomes for child welfare services, first published in 2000. The Child and Family Services Reviews (CFSRs), federal reviews of state child welfare systems based on these outcome measures, began in 2001. Findings from the first round of CFSRs provided more detailed information about states' strengths and needs, enabling the Bureau to create technical assistance and data collection systems more directly focused on areas of greatest need. Some examples include: * Creation of topical Quality Improvement Centers (QICs) and Regional Implementation Centers, and increasing coordination among its network of National Resource Centers and Clearinghouses. * Creation of a data collection system to track state independent living services for youth (the National Youth in Transition Database, NYTD, established in October 2010). * Launch of AdoptUSKids, a comprehensive program to increase adoption opportunities for children in foster care. It includes a national photolisting website, training and technical assistance to states and tribes, and a national recruitment campaign, among other elements. In 2003, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the first Presidential Proclamation for Child Abuse Prevention Month, OCAN launched a yearlong National Child Abuse Prevention Initiative. Since then, support for child abuse prevention efforts has continued to expand, due in part to growing evidence that home visitation programs can effectively reduce maltreatment and improve outcomes for pregnant mothers and families with young children. In 2011, another child abuse prevention initiative kicked off at the Bureau's first Network for Action meeting. More recent Children's Bureau initiatives have included the following: * Since 2000, the Children's Bureau has sponsored conferences and funded discretionary grants on the child welfare staffing crisis. It launched the National Child Welfare Workforce Institute in 2008. * In 2009, the Bureau funded a new National Resource Center for In-Home Services to support promising practices that can help children remain safely in their homes when their families are involved (or at risk of involvement) with the child welfare system. * The Bureau held its first Child Welfare Evaluation Summit in 2009 to explore and promote effective approaches for evaluating child welfare systems, projects, and programs. * In 2010, the Children's Bureau awarded funding to implement the President's Initiative to Reduce Long-Term Foster Care, which seeks to improve outcomes for groups of children who face the greatest barriers to permanency. * In 2011, the Bureau sponsored a national meeting in partnership with the U.S. Department of Education to improve educational stability and outcomes for children in foster care. =Centennial= On April 9, 2012, the Children's Bureau marked its 100th anniversary with a ceremony at the Hubert H. Humphrey Building in Washington, DC. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Acting Assistant Secretary for Children and Families George Sheldon, and Acting Associate Commissioner Joe Bock were among the speakers at the event. Former ACYF Commissioner Carol Wilson Spigner (Carol Williams) was given a Children's Bureau Centennial Award for her \\"extraordinary vision and leadership in the field of child welfare services.\\" Publications In its early years, the Children's Bureau published voluminously on many topics related to children's health and well-being, and it distributed its publications very widely. A full bibliography is impossible here, but an OpenLibrary search by author gives some sense of the range of topics. Some of the Bureau's significant recent publications include the following: * Child Abuse and Neglect User Manual Series (guides for professionals interested in preventing, identifying, and responding to child maltreatment) * Child Maltreatment reports (annual reports of national statistics regarding reports of child abuse and neglect) * AFCARS reports (national adoption and foster care statistics) * Child Welfare Outcomes reports (annual reports to Congress assessing state performance in operating child protection and child welfare programs) * Children's Bureau Express (monthly online digest) See also * Child Abuse Reform and Enforcement Act - law aiming to \\"promote the improvement of information on, and protections against, child sexual abuse * Child Welfare Information Gateway * Children's Act for Responsible Employment (CARE Act) - a bill (proposed law) to bring parity of labor conditions to minor field workers that are afforded to minors in other occupations.

He later became a successful operatic tenor in the 1960s, making appearances with the Opera Company of Boston, the New York City Opera, and the American National Opera Company. Life and career Rall was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and raised in Seattle. As a child he had a crossed eye which made it hard for him to read books, so his mother enrolled him in dancing classes. In his early years he performed a dance and acrobatic vaudeville act in Seattle theaters and attempted small acting roles. His family moved to Los Angeles in the 1940s, and Rall began to appear in small movie roles. His first film appearance was a short MGM film called Vendetta. He began taking tap dancing lessons and became a member of the jitterbugging Jivin' Jacks and Jills at Universal Studios.

The remedy describes how to make a salve, but its main interest lies in the unique charm which follows. This describes how the f√¶rstice has been caused by the projectiles of 'mighty women' (√∞a mihtigan wif), whom the healer will combat. The charm also mentions elves, believed responsible for elfshot, and provides the only attestation outside personal names of the Old English form of the name of the old Germanic gods, known as the √Üsir in Norse mythology. As with many old Anglo-Saxon charms, it is presumed that physical gestures were intended to accompany the recitation of the text. In this case, the \\"Wi√∞ f√¶rstice\\" is intended to be accompanied by boiling feverfew, red nettle grown in grain, and plantain, then boiling it all in a bowl of butter. A knife is dipped into the potion and then rubbed against the source of pain. Despite the popular use of the aforementioned herbs in forms of remedial healing, it is important to note that the usage of these plants may have been more symbolic than practical. Many old Anglo-Saxon charms draw upon the symbolism of both pagan traditions as well as ancient Christian traditions, and the usage of plants in the texts were likely related to these religious references.  Content  The first seventeen lines of the \\"Wi√∞ f√¶rstice\\" have been referred to as its \\"epic introduction\\". Howell D. Chickering Junior expressed the view that there \\"probably is no epic or mythic narrative\\" behind this introductory section, instead arguing that it should be seen as \\"a dramatic verbal performance\\". As edited and translated by Alaric Hall, the text runs:  Date  The age of \\"Wi√∞ f√¶rstice\\" has been hard to judge. Considering all of the available evidence, Medieval literature specialist Alaric Hall deemed it probable that the charm was a \\"cultural artefact\\" from the late tenth century.  Interpretation  Early examinations of the Anglo-Saxon poetic charms were largely focused on determining which elements within them derived from the pre-Christian belief systems of the Anglo-Saxons. Accordingly, attention was paid to \\"Wi√∞ f√¶rstice\\", which was deemed to be \\"one of the three or four charms apparently richest in pagan references.\\" With the exception of the closing benediction, the charm lacks any obvious Christian references, with Jolly accordingly believing that from modern understandings of Christianity, it would seem \\"overwhelmingly not Christian\\". She however cautioned against viewing it as either non-Christian on the one hand, or as pagan on the other. She highlighted that the presumed pagan elements within it all reflected \\"areligious folklore, transferable from one religious tradition to another\\", while it was produced by people living in Late Anglo-Saxon England who would have considered themselves to be Christian and who felt no need to highly Christianise it. = Medical perspective = It is not known what medical symptom the Old English term f√¶rstice refers to in this charm. Several scholars to have studied the charm, such as Godfrid Storms and Howell D. Chickering Jr., expressed the view that it referred to rheumatism. Although noting that prior interpretations of the charm had suggested that the f√¶rstice referred to rheumatism or lumbago, the Anglo-Saxonist Stephen Pollington opined that there were \\"no compelling reasons\\" to accept either explanation, instead expressing the view that it should be regarded as a reference to \\"any sharp, unexpected pain\\". = Supernatural elements = Hall was of the view that \\"Wi√∞ f√¶rstice\\" \\"constructs a strong distinction between in-group (the patient and healer) and harmful out-group (the supernatural beings).\\" Hall expressed the view that the poem \\"provides a key to interpreting the cultural significance of √¶lfe in medieval texts\\". Given his argument that in \\"earlier Anglo-Saxon beliefs\\", √¶lfe were \\"probably primarily or only male\\", he considered it interesting that in this charm they are cited alongside the female h√¶gtessan. = Parallels and analogues = Hall identified an earlier parallel in Aldhelm's poetic Carmen de virginitate, specifically the passage in lines 2635‚Äì42 in which he describes Allecto, one of the Furiae of Classical mythology. In this passage, Allecto is described as bringing \\"iron-tipped spears to battle, which would cause jagged wounds to holy souls\\". Hall noted that this use of iron-tipped spears could not have been adopted straight from Classical sources, where Allecto and the Furies cause harm using snakes rather than spears. Rather, he compared the use of the Furies' spears to the spears of the h√¶gtesse in \\"Wi√∞ f√¶rstice\\", bolstering this connection by noting that in the eighth century Third Cleopatra Glossary, the Latin word furiarum is given the Old English gloss of h√¶gtessa. Hall also argued that there was a \\"remarkable parallel\\" between \\"Wi√∞ f√¶rstice\\" and the accounts of magical practices provided by Isobel Gowdie, a Scottish woman accused of witchcraft in 1662, during her confessions. Gowdie claimed that she rode through the air on straw with her fellow witches, firing \\"elf-arrows\\" at her victims; these had been acquired from the Devil, who had been aided in their creation by \\"Elf- boyes\\". Hall stated that this exhibited a general similarity to the account provided in \\"Wi√∞ f√¶rstice\\". He also thought there were parallels between the two accounts in terms of their use of smiths; in both, one smith (the Devil in Gowdie's account) is part of a wider group of smiths. While acknowledging \\"the great gap of time\\" ‚Äì lasting around seven centuries ‚Äì between the two accounts, Hall noted that \\"charm-texts and related traditions\\" could be transmitted across this gap of time, citing the example of the Second Merseburg Charm as an example.

He played in Major League Baseball from to for the Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves. He served as a coach for the Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, New York Mets, Cincinnati Reds, and Seattle Mariners. Chambliss won the American League Rookie of the Year Award with the Indians in 1971. He was an All-Star with the Yankees in 1976, the same year he hit the series-winning home run in the 1976 American League Championship Series. He was a member of the Yankees' 1977 and 1978 World Series championship teams, both against the Los Angeles Dodgers, and won the Gold Glove Award in 1978. Chambliss went on to win four more World Series championships as the hitting coach for the Yankees in 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2000. Early life Chambliss was born in Dayton, Ohio, on December 26, 1948. He was the third of four sons born to Carroll and Christene Chambliss. His father was a chaplain in the United States Navy, leading the family to relocate many times during Chris' childhood. They settled in Oceanside, California, where Chris attended high school. Chris and his brothers all played baseball on the Oceanside High School baseball team. Playing career =Cleveland Indians= Chambliss enrolled at MiraCosta College, a junior college, where he played college baseball. Despite being selected in the Major League Baseball (MLB) Drafts of 1967 and 1968 by the Cincinnati Reds, he opted not to sign with the Reds on either occasion. He transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he continued his college baseball career with the UCLA Bruins baseball team in 1969. That season, he led the Bruins with 15 home runs and 45 runs batted in. During the summer, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Anchorage Glacier Pilots of the Alaska Baseball League, which won the National Baseball Congress (NBC) championship. Chambliss had a .583 batting average in the NBC tournament and was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player. The Cleveland Indians selected Chambliss with the first overall pick in the January 1970 Major League Baseball Draft. The Indians assigned him to the Wichita Aeros of the Class AAA American Association, their most advanced minor league baseball affiliate. With the Aeros, Chambliss batted .342, which led the league. With Ken Harrelson serving as the Indians' first baseman, the Indians had Chambliss play in the outfield for Wichita in 1971, in order to have both players in their lineup at the same time. He debuted in the majors in 1971, and was named AL Rookie of the Year. Chambliss played first base and was known as a great clutch hitter throughout his career. =New York Yankees= Chambliss was traded along with Dick Tidrow and Cecil Upshaw from the Indians to the New York Yankees for Fritz Peterson, Steve Kline, Fred Beene and Tom Buskey on April 26, 1974. The Yankees were criticized for giving away four pitchers as opposed to the two it got in return and a failure to land a starting second baseman.Chass, Murray. \\"Yankee‚ÄêIndian Trade Brings Confusion, Anger and Leaves 2d‚ÄêBase Question,\\" The New York Times, Sunday, April 28, 1974.

He hit an ALCS record .524 (11-for-21) with 2 home runs and eight RBIs. In the 1976 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds, Chambliss hit .313 (5-for-16) with one RBI. Chambliss played three more seasons with the Yankees, helping lead the Yankees to the 1977 World Series title‚Äìtheir first since 1962‚Äìand winning a Gold Glove for his fielding prowess in 1978. The \\"Chris Chambliss Rule\\" Immediately after the walk-off home run, thousands of fans stormed the Yankee Stadium field to celebrate. Chambliss was mobbed on the basepaths and did not make an attempt to touch home plate. Instead, he ran straight toward the dugout and the safety of the Yankee clubhouse. Chambliss was then asked by Graig Nettles if he had touched home, and responded that he had not because too many people were in the way. Nettles then told him that home plate umpire Art Frantz was waiting for him to touch home so that the home run could be ruled official. He was then escorted back out onto the field to touch home, but the plate had been stolen, so he touched the area where the plate had been. Said Chambliss: \\"I just kind of reacted like I always did. I wasn't trying to hit a home run. Sometimes when you react to a high fastball it works out that way. Then, when I was running around the bases, fans were coming at me from everywhere, grabbing me, pounding me on the back. I was just trying to get around the bases and into the dugout---I ran at least one guy over---but I never made it to home plate. Later, after I got to the clubhouse, [Graig] Nettles said I should return to the field and touch home plate, just to make it official. But when we got back out there, home plate and all the other bases were gone, stripped from their moorings and confiscated by the delirious Yankee fans.\\"Lou: Fifty Years of Kicking Dirt, Playing Hard, and Winning Big in the Sweet Spot of Baseball by Lou Piniella with Bill Madden (HarperCollins, 2017), p. 75 Kansas City manager Whitey Herzog could have appealed the play, as Major League rules state that a player must touch all bases on any hit or when running the bases. However, the mayhem on the field made this task impossible, and given the magnitude of the game, Herzog would have never tried to have it restarted or protested due to a technicality. In any event, the umpires had already decided to let the run count given the circumstances of the situation. As a result of this incident, Major League Baseball changed the rules to allow the umpire to award any base runner or batter a run when he cannot reach the plate due to fans rushing the field. This had the effect of codifying the decision made by the umpires in Game 5. Chambliss as a member of the Atlanta Braves in the 1980s. =Later career= After the 1979 season, the Yankees traded Chambliss to the Toronto Blue Jays with Damaso Garcia and Paul Mirabella for Rick Cerone, Tom Underwood, and Ted Wilborn. The Yankees hoped that Cerone would replace Thurman Munson as their starting catcher.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MaROAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=t_oDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=7075,2453216&dq;=chris+chambliss+wife&hl;=en Later that offseason, the Blue Jays traded Chambliss with Luis G√≥mez to the Atlanta Braves for prospects Barry Bonnell, Joey McLaughlin, and Pat Rockett.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=12pJAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=2woNAAAAIBAJ&pg;=2509,1506845&dq;=chris+chambliss&hl;=en He then moved on to Atlanta from 1980 through 1986. He had one at-bat with the Yankees in 1988 and struck out. (According to Lou Piniella, this at-bat earned him about $20,000, since he had to be paid the minimum player salary for the season after he was activated for that at-bat.Lou: Fifty Years of Kicking Dirt, Playing Hard, and Winning Big in the Sweet Spot of Baseball by Lou Piniella with Bill Madden (HarperCollins, 2017), p. 145) He retired with a career .279 batting average and 185 home runs.http://hamptonroads.com/2009/07/chris-chambliss-managing-keep-his-chin After his playing days ended, Chambliss became a hitting instructor for several teams and was talked about as a possible managerial candidate. Coaching and managerial career In 1989, Chambliss became the manager for the Double-A London Tigers of the Eastern League, an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. The London Tigers won the Eastern League title in 1990, playing out of Labatt Park. That same year Chambliss was named Minor League Manager of the Year by The Sporting News.

It is otherwise known as Hau Hoi Wan () in Hong Kong, and Shenzhen Bay () in Mainland China. Name The local Cantonese name of the bay is Hau Hoi Wan (), which means the back (sea) bay. It is opposite to another bay, Tsin Hoi Wan (), which means front (sea) bay, on the other side of Nantau Peninsula. The Chinese character Âêé (Hau, lit. queen) in ÂêéÊµ∑ÁÅ£ is the homonym of Âæå (Hau, lit. back), and also its simplified character. Some attribute the character Âêé (Hau) to the goddess of mercy and sea, Tin Hau (). The name of Shenzhen Bay came much later, at least after the establishment of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in 1980. The name became more notable after a hotel was named Shenzhen Bay. While the government of China uses the name widely, the people and government in Hong Kong continue to use the official name (). Ecology View Tin Shui Wai in fog from Shenzhen side through the Bay As the bay is largely enclosed by land, fresh water from the surrounding land enters the bay from a shallow shore of wetland. The margin of fresh water and salt water forms a valuable habitat for a wide variety of life. The bay's northern shore used to be lined with marshes. As Shenzhen began to develop into a major urban centre, the northern shoreline was reclaimed to provide land for buildings. Some departments had tried to preserve the endangered environment but mistakenly introduced foreign species of mangrove, which threatened their indigenous counterparts. The marshes remain largely intact along the southern part of the bay, which is under Hong Kong's jurisdiction. Mai Po is an important habitat for migrating birds in the area. Pools of former fish farms is another attraction to birds. Agriculture and fisheries Sun dried oysters in Lau Fau Shan looking towards Shenzhen The bay is rich in fish and oysters. Lau Fau Shan is particularly famous for oysters in Hong Kong. From Lau Fau Shan to Mai Po, the villagers made use of the special environment's pools to cultivate fishes. A by-product of this cultivation, greasyback shrimp (), is also a delicacy in Hong Kong. Illegal immigrants Before 1949, Chinese people were free to travel between Hong Kong and mainland China. In order to halt a large influx of refugees from mainland China, the Hong Kong Government established border control and compulsory registration of Hong Kong residents. As a result, it was harder to migrate to Hong Kong than before and thus many crossed the border illegally. Deep Bay became the main access for illegal immigrants because border controls were harder to enforce at sea. It was relatively easy to cross the bay and there were major roads to the urban centres of Hong Kong. The rural town of Lau Fau Shan was the major landing point.

Political career At the general election of 1880 Asher was unsuccessful as Liberal candidate for the universities of Glasgow and Aberdeen. In 1881, following the resignation of M. E. Grant Duff from the Elgin Burghs constituency, Asher was chosen to represent the Liberal Party at the 1881 Elgin Burghs by-election. He was elected unopposed on 13 July. He immediately took office in the Liberal Government of William Gladstone as Solicitor General for Scotland, serving until 1885. He was elected unopposed at the General Election 1885, at a by-election on 12 February 1886 after re-acceptance of office as Solicitor General for Scotland and again at the General Election 1886.Debrett's House of Commons and Judicial Bench, 1889 His second spell as Solicitor General being cut short when the Liberals lost power.

Asher took office in that government, again as Solicitor General for Scotland, serving for another two years. Shortly prior to the 1895 general election, Asher was rumoured to be the Government nominee for the position of Speaker of the House of Commons. Although he was not chosen as the Speaker, he retained his seat with a margin of 1,853 votes against the tally of 1,161 won by C.O. Gordon. There were rumours that the Conservative Party might put forward a candidate to oppose Asher in the 1900 general election. But as of five days before the election, Asher remained unopposed. John Moffat stepped forward shortly before the election on behalf of the Liberal Unionist Party, but was defeated by Asher, 1187 votes to 1744.

The screenplay by Isobel Lennart and I.A.L. Diamond is based on the short story \\"The Romance of Henry Menafee\\" by Paul Gallico. Saul Chaplin composed the music and Johnny Mercer wrote the lyrics for the film's score. Plot Andrew Larabee teaches at a school run by his headmaster father Matthew, a traditional man who disapproves of his son's unconventional methods despite their popularity with the students. Andrew's special interest is archaeology, and he hopes to earn his father's respect through this field of study. During the school holidays, Andrew bicycles to ancient ruins in Sussex where he believes a statue of Pan (which had been left behind by a Roman legion) can be found. Such a discovery would enable him to publish and subsequently wed Letitia Fairchild, his fianc√©e of five years, who insists he earn a promotion before she marries him. At the site he encounters the Gallini family traveling circus, which has been ordered to pack up and leave by the local police since the land is now property of dairy farmer Lord Elmwood. The five Gallini brothers and their cousin Selena mistake Andrew for a contractor, and when he tells them he doesn't mind if they remain, the Gallinis halt their \\"pulling up stakes\\". Lord Elmwood arrives and threatens to remove both Andrew and the circus, but Andrew realizes he's a former fellow Oxford University student with a checkered romantic past. Chastened by Andrew‚Äôs subtle threat of blackmail, Lord Elmwood agrees to give Andrew and the Gallinis a week before he starts construction on the land. Shortly after he has begun his excavations, Andrew discovers a tunnel on the site and burrows through its ceiling and directly into the middle of the lion act during a performance. His amusingly masterful way with the animals impresses Selena, who tells him he is a born entertainer, and she teaches him to juggle. With ringmaster Antonio suffering from laryngitis, Andrew is coaxed into replacing him at the matinee. Unfortunately, Letitia and Andrew's brother Dudley arrive to check on Andrew's progress and decide to attend the circus, so Andrew is disguised as Antonio. Due to needing a lot of padding to fit into Antonio's clothes, Andrew is given a RAF safety life jacket with a whistle, smoke and emergency flares -- all of which cause havoc in mid-speech and marking Andrew as a natural clown. After the performance, Selena is overcome with jealousy at the sight of Andrew and Letitia together, and later follows Andrew into the tunnel. Andrew does some more digging, inadvertently causing a cave-in which traps both of them overnight. The following morning, Angelina the chimpanzee, who is tied to a stake by a rope, attempts to get a banana which has been thrown to her out of her reach. As Angelina pulls on the rope, the stake moves, causing the earth around it to collapse and revealing Andrew and Selena. When Antonio and his sons discover them, they accuse Andrew of improper behavior with their Selena and, to save the family honor, insist the two wed on the following Saturday. Angelina the chimpanzee then finds the Pan statue Andrew was seeking and conceals it in her cage. Andrew convinces Selena his obligations at school override their wedding plans and he returns home, where he discovers his father has promoted him and Letitia is ready to accept him as her husband -- with their marriage having also been set to take place on the following Saturday. On the night before the ceremony, Selena brings Andrew the statue of Pan which Angelina had given to her. Because Andrew's class has performed well in their last test, the Headmaster has promised them a treat. However, when the boys choose to go to the Gallini Circus, which is due to arrive, Andrew refuses to take them there. So the boys disappear on the day of the wedding, and Andrew tracks them back to the circus. His father and brothers discover the statue of Pan, and Dudley mentions that a circus was in the field in which Andrew was searching for Pan. Accompanied by Letitia and her father, Andrew's father and brothers follow him to the circus where they find Andrew being chased by the Gallini brothers. When Andrew is confronted by two upset families, he finally clears things up and admits that he loves Selena. Following the wedding ceremony, Andrew and Dudley leave the church arm-in-arm with Letitia. After the happy couple - Dudley and Letitia - drive away on their honeymoon, Matthew gives his blessing to Andrew, saying that Andrew was carrying on a fine family tradition (one of their ancestors, Thomas Larabee, had been a jester in the court of King James the First). A very happy Andrew then leaves with his bride-to-be Selena and the equally happy members of the Gallini family.

Box office According to MGM records the film earned $1,180,000 in the US and Canada and $2,350,000 elsewhere, recording a loss of $837,000. Critical reception Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called the film \\"what the doctor ordered to help shake the winter blues\\" and added, \\"It isn't the most original or inventive vehicle in which the cheering Mr. Kaye has come bouncing down the road. It is, in fact, a rather obvious and narrowly confined piece of comical contrivance for the genial performer to command . . . Successively, the scriptwriters and director Michael Kidd put Mr. Kaye through various fumbles . . . Once in a while, the star is needled into doing a pleasant song . . . Indeed, it would be most gratifying if there were more of this sort of thing in the show. However, it's ample entertainment.\\" Variety said the film \\"has a happy-go-chuckley attitude and some smart musical numbers set up by stand-out music and lyrics. Against this is the fact that the production does not always maintain its own set of very high comedy values, nor the pace of its initial scenes. Michael Kidd, who makes his screen debut as a director, still has a lot to learn about comedy set-ups and this unsureness is made the more evident by the contrast of the narrative stretches with the brisk and imaginative manner in which Kidd has choreographed the musical numbers. Here he is on experienced ground and he shows it.\\" See also * List of American films of 1958 References External links Category:1958 films Category:1958 musical comedy films Category:1958 romantic comedy films Category:American films Category:American musical comedy films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:American romantic musical films Category:Circus films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in England Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:Films with screenplays by I.

Though they are often held at the beginning of summer, they are staged in the autumn or spring seasons, especially in countries where the summer is very harsh. Schools stage many sports days in which children participate in the sporting events. It is usually held in elementary schools. In schools which use a house system a feature of the school is the competition between the houses; this is especially brought out during sporting events such as an inter-house sports day. Games that are played on school sports days can be wide and varied. They can include straightforward sprints and longer races for all age groups as well as egg and spoon races. Three-legged races are run as well as sack races, wheelbarrow races, and parent and child races. Additional games are traditionally run in Ireland, and the UK, such as horseshoes. Controversies There have been a number of controversies surrounding school sports days in recent years, many of which have been publicised by the media. Some schools have abolished or heavily altered sports days on the grounds that they are too competitive and may damage pupils' self-esteem, with some commentators calling for the event to be banned due to the public humiliation caused to those children who are not gifted athletically. This view has been condemned as \\"political correctness\\" by many commentators, notably by journalist Melanie Phillips in her 1996 book All Must Have Prizes, a book heavily criticised by reviewers for its alleged prejudiced, fact-less and distorted analyses. In June 2005, Country Life magazine published a report claiming that school sports days have become excessively competitive due to overbearing and \\"over-zealous\\" parents, who place too much pressure on their children to succeed. The report also revealed that many schools have banned \\"mothers and fathers\\" races due to fighting and cheating. Since the mid-1990s, a number of schools and education authorities have banned photography and filming with video cameras at sports days and other school events. Some authorities cite general privacy issues as justification for the ban. Others have raised concerns about pedophiles, which in turn has sparked accusations of hysteria and moral panic. Many parents have expressed anger at being unable to take photographs or videos as souvenirs of these events, and the ban has been criticised by some as a paranoid over-reaction to public concerns about pedophilia and child safety issues. Global =India= In India, sports days are held for 2‚Äì3 days. These include games like football, cricket, throw ball, dodge ball, volleyball, track and field, basketball etc. These sports days are held between the various houses in a particular school. In India, many traditional games such as Kho-Kho and Kabaddi, March-past are played. =Japan= Sports day, called und≈çkai (ÈÅãÂãï‰ºö) in Japanese, is usually held on a Saturday or Sunday in Japanese schools. During weeks preceding the sports day, students practice their events which they would like to show their parents and friends, within their class of physical education, which often includes tamaire, performances by the school band and presentations by various school clubs as well as individual and group competitive events. These practices, and the sports days themselves, normally take place on the schools' fields, which provide little relief from the heat and sun. Some schools have responded by scheduling their sports days during cooler months and by encouraging their students to drink water regularly. Currently, the event occurs most often in the autumn (September/October), or in the spring (May/June). In primary schools in Hokkaid≈ç, the event is usually held between the later part of May and the earlier part of June.Fukue, Natsuko, \\"No escaping annual sports days\\", Japan Times, 19 October 2010, p. 3. =Pakistan= Sport is a significant part of Pakistani culture. Cricket is the most popular sport, while field hockey, polo, and squash are also popular. Traditional sports like kabaddi and other well-known games are also played. The Pakistan Sports Board was created in 1962 by the Ministry of Education as a corporate body for the purposes of promoting and developing uniform standards of competition in sports in Pakistan comparable to the standards prevailing internationally, and regulating and controlling sports in Pakistan on a national basis. The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, now has control over the Pakistan Sports Board. The PSB controls all 39 sporting federations. The Pakistan Sports Board is supported by the Pakistan Sports Trust, which assists hard up players and associations so they can continue participating in sports. Over recent years there has been an increase in sporting activity in Pakistan, with Pakistani sportsmen and women participating at many national and international events. Also, more international tournaments now take place in Pakistan. The size of the teams Pakistan sends, and the number of events they participate in, such as the Olympic Games, Asian Games, World Games, and Commonwealth Games has increased since the turn of the century. =Russia= Sports Day in Russia is held on the second Saturday in August. =Qatar= Sports day is a national holiday, held every second-Tuesday of February every year. The Olympic Committee is tasked with organizing the large-scale nationwide activities that are held all over Qatar, and include a wide variety of sports such as; football, basketball, tennis, marathons, open walks, as well as regional sports such as camel riding. Other venues of sports day include Aspire Zone, Katara, The Pearl, among others. Sports day's popularity extends to the point that Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, Qatar's Emir is casually seen participating in events. In offices Many large organizations have sports days for their employees. One notable example is Her Majesty's Civil Service in the UK, which holds a number of departmental sports days.

History  The firm was founded in 1965 by Herbert Wachtell and Jerry Kern, who were shortly afterwards joined by Martin Lipton, Leonard Rosen, and George Katz. The four named partners met at New York University School of Law where they were editors on the New York University Law Review together. The firm rose to prominence on Wall Street when many brokers and investment bankers were launching small firms, but received little attention from established white- shoe law firms, such as Sullivan & Cromwell, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore. One of the founding partners, Martin Lipton, invented the so-called \\"poison pill defense\\" during the 1980s, to foil hostile takeovers. Working both sides of mergers and acquisitions, Wachtell Lipton has represented blue-chip clients such as AT&T;, Pfizer, and JP Morgan Chase.Summary of corporate practice. It has had key roles in the resurrection of Chrysler in the 1970s, the acquisition of Getty Oil by Texaco, and the negotiation of the master development agreement for the World Trade Center after the September 11, 2001 attacks. The firm is also known for its business litigation, and has represented clients in many of the precedent-setting Delaware corporate governance cases.See, e.g., Moran v. Household Int'l, Inc., 500 A.2d 1346 (Del. 1985); Paramount Commc'ns, Inc. v. Time Inc., 571 A.2d 1140 (Del. 1989); Air Prods. & Chemicals, Inc. v. Airgas, Inc., 16 A.3d 48 (Del. Ch. 2011).  Firm Profile  Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is considered to be one of the top firms in the United States for major mergers and acquisitions, antitrust and shareholder litigation and corporate restructurings. While many peer law firms have grown and become international brands, Wachtell has only a single, Manhattan office. It is one of the smallest firms in the AmLaw 100, but has the highest per partner profits of any law firm and pays significantly above the \\"Cravath scale\\" market rate for associates. The firm pays its partners through a lockstep system, meaning that compensation is tied to firm seniority, rather than hours billed or business brought in. The same is true for associate bonuses. This compensation model has led to the firm being called the \\"last true partnership.\\" The firm is known for its work in mergers and acquisitions and been ranked #1 in Vault's M&A; rankings for more than a decade. Vault has also ranked it either #1 or #2 in the general Vault Law 100 for over fifteen years. Along with rival Skadden, Arps, it was also cited in Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers.

He served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland from 1988 to 1989. Biography James Whyte was the second son of Andrew Whyte, a provision merchant in Leith, and his wife Barbaro Janet Pitillo Aitken. He was brought up in Edinburgh, attended Melville College and studied philosophy (he was awarded a First class honours MA degree in 1942) and divinity at the University of Edinburgh. After his ordination in 1945 he spent three years as a chaplain to the first battalion of the Scots Guards, and then served as a parish minister at Dunollie Road Church in Oban (inducted 1948) and Mayfield North in Edinburgh (1954). In 1958 he was appointed Professor of Practical theology and Christian ethics at St Mary's College, the divinity faculty of the University of St Andrews and was Principal of St Mary's 1978-1982. His academic work focused mainly on the study of pastoral theology, liturgy and ecclesiastical architecture. He served as convenor of the General Assembly's Inter-Church Relations Committee. After his retirement from the University in 1987, he became Associate Minister of Hope Park, St Andrews. He was moderator of the 1988 General Assembly. In 1942 Whyte married his first wife Elisabeth Mill who died during his moderatorial year of 1988. He was survived by his second wife, primary school teacher Ishbel (n√©e MacAuley) and his daughter and two sons from his first marriage. Public profile James Whyte was an influential figure in the Church and in Scottish life, largely because of his reputation as a pastor. Four events brought him to the centre of public attention. During his time as Principal of St Mary's it came to light that one of his students had previously served a sentence for murder. There followed a public controversy about whether this man could become a minister of the Church. Whyte argued on the basis of the Christian doctrine of forgiveness and persuaded the General Assembly not to block the ordination. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was invited to address the 1988 General Assembly and gave the speech which the press dubbed the Sermon on the Mound, which attempted to suggest a theological basis for her style of capitalism. As Moderator, Whyte responded by presenting her with church reports on housing and poverty. He professed himself astonished at the public controversy which this relatively restrained censure unleashed. In his speech to the General Assembly the following year he recalled (referring to the Conservative baron Sir Nicholas Fairbairn): \\"one knight-errant looking for a windmill to tilt at even described me as 'Satanic' !\\" As Moderator, Whyte was called on to preach at the memorial service for the victims of the Lockerbie disaster on 4 January 1989. This sermon was widely cited in the press and had a great impact: :\\"That such carnage of the young and of the innocent should have been willed by men in cold and calculated evil, is horror upon horror. What is our response to that? :The desire, the determination, that those who did this should be detected and, if possible, brought to justice, is natural and is right. The uncovering of the truth will not be easy, and evidence that would stand up in a court of law may be hard to obtain. :Justice is one thing. But already one hears in the media the word 'retaliation'. As far as I know, no responsible politician has used that word, and I hope none ever will, except to disown it. For that way lies the endless cycle of violence upon violence, horror upon horror. And we may be tempted, indeed urged by some, to flex our muscles in response, to show that we are men. To show that we are what? To show that we are prepared to let more young and more innocent die, to let more rescue workers labour in more wreckage to find the grisly proof, not of our virility, but of our inhumanity. That is what retaliation means.\\" The full text of this sermon was published in Laughter and Tears pp 92‚Äì5. After the Dunblane Massacre in 1996 the families of the victims requested that Whyte conduct the memorial service on 9 October that year. The text of the sermon he preached on this occasion appears in The Dream and the Grace pp 125‚Äì9. Whyte was renowned for his witty comments on Scottish public life. When the Conservative government privatised the Trustee Savings Bank in 1985 he wrote a three- sentence letter to The Scotsman: \\"Bankrobbery is the word we use to describe the crime of stealing from a bank. But what word can we use to describe the crime of stealing a bank? Words cannot describe the crimes of government!\\" Publications *Laughter and Tears: Thoughts on Faith in the Face of Suffering, Edinburgh: St Andrew Press 1993, . *The Dream and the Grace: Sermons on Healthy and Unhealthy Religion, Edinburgh: St Andrew Press 2001, . *(co-edited) Worship Now: A Collection of Services and Prayer for Public Worship, vol 1 Edinburgh: St Andrew Press 1972 ; vol 2 Edinburgh: St Andrew Press 1989, . *An interview with Whyte: Kenneth Roy, \\"A Present for Mrs Thatcher\\" in Kenneth Roy, Conversations in a Small Country, Ayr: Carrick Publishing 1989, , pp 41‚Äì8 See also * List of Moderators of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland References Whyte, James A.

Gorski, Gibson graduated from St. Alphonsus Parochial School. Career Gibson, who was signed by Warner Bros. in 1950 and made her film debut in Tea for Two (1950), started her career in musicals in her hometown of St. Louis, Missouri. In 1937, she was one of 35 girls chosen for ballet in St. Louis Opera Company productions. She danced in the chorus of a production of The Student Prince there in 1940, and in 1943 she was part of the dancing chorus of the summer season of the Muny Opera. In the fall of 1943, she was one of three dancers from that group to sign contracts to perform in Roll Up Your Sleeves on Broadway. She used her birth name on Broadway through 1949. In 1947, she returned to perform at Muny Opera, this time as the star of No, No, Nanette.

They ruled these areas on behalf of the Umayyad Caliphate of Cordoba in the end of the 10th century and the first half of the 11th century.  Etymology and root  Dahra was the main stronghold of the Maghrawas The Maghrawa descend from the branch of Madghis (Medghassen). The Maghrawa are the brothers of the Banu Ifran and the Irnyan. Ifren, Irnyan are the brothers of Maghra. The plural of Maghra is Aimgharen in Berber (which means \\"someone who has sold his share\\" but also \\"old\\"). We will say also say Maghrawa in literary Arabic from the point of view of the historian of the Maghreb, Ibn Khaldun. There are several tribes from the Maghrawa including Bani bou Said, Bani Ilit (Ilent), Bani Zendak, Bani Urac (Urtezmir, Urtesminn), Bani Urcifan, Bani Laghouat, Bani Righa, Bani Sidi Mansour (Bani Mansour), A. Lahsen, etc. Most of the inhabitants of the Aur√®s are from this ancient tribe. The Ouarsenis is home to the Maghraouas, as well as the inhabitants of the Blid√©en Atlas, the Dahra Range in Tipaza, Cherchell, Algiers, T√©n√®s, Miliana, Mostaganem, Mazouna, etc. Around the beginning of the first century. The Maghrawa were very numerous in the surroundings of Icosium (Algiers) and Ptolemy of Mauritania must have contained them. Ptolemy will transfer a part of the Maghrawa towards the Chlef region. Among the tribes of Maghrawa ancestry and masters of the Western Dahra in the nineteenth century, there were: the Achaachas, the Zerrifas, the Ouled Khellouf (where the mausoleum of the marabout Sidi Lakhdar is located), the Beni Zeroual and the Mediounas, most of them are communes of the wilaya of Mostaganem. History The confederation of Maghrawa actively participated in the various events of ancient life. They are the majority people of the central Maghreb among the Zenets (G√©tules). Both nomadic and sedentary, the Maghrawa lived under the command of Maghrawa chiefs or Zenata. Algiers has been the territory of the Maghrawa since ancient times. The name Maghrawa will be transcribed into Greek by historians. The great kingdom of the Maghrawa is located between Algiers, Cherchell, T√©n√®s, Chlef, Miliana and M√©d√©a. Ptolemy moved part of the Maghrawa to Chlef. The Maghrawa impose their domination in the Aur√®s. Chlef and its surroundings were populated by the Maghrawa according to Ibn Khaldun. The Maghrawa settled and extended their domination throughout the Dahra and beyond Miliana to the Tafna wadi in the vicinity of Tlemcen, we find them as far as Mali. The Meghrawa, a tribe of Zanata Berbers,Ibn Khaldoun , History of berber were one of the first Berber tribes to submit to Islam in the 7th century. They supported Uqba ibn Nafi in his campaign to the Atlantic in 683. They defected from Sunni Islam and became Kharijites Muslims from the 8th century, and allied first with the Shia Muslim Idrisids, and, from the 10th century, with the Andalusian Umayyads of C√≥rdoba. As a result, they were caught up in the Umayyad-Fatimid conflict in Morocco and Algeria. Although they won a victory over the allies of the Fatimids in 924, they soon became allied with them themselves. When they switched back to the side of C√≥rdoba, they were driven out of central Morocco by the Zirids, who ruled on behalf of the Fatimids. In 980, however, they were able to drive the Miknasa out of Sijilmasa. Under Ziri ibn Atiyya (to 1001) the Meghrawa achieved supremacy in Fez under Umayyad suzerainty and expanded their territory at the expense of the Banu Ifran. A revolt against the Andalusian Umayyads was put down by Al- Mansur (Abi Amir), although the Meghrawa were able to regain power in Fez. Under the succeeding rulers al-Muizz (1001-1026), Hamman (1026-1039) and Dunas (1039) they consolidated their rule in northern and central Morocco. However, internal power struggles after 1060 enabled the Almoravid dynasty to conquer the Maghrawa realm in 1070 and put an end to their rule.

An EBA is formed where the distributions of two or more such restricted-range species overlap. Using this guideline, 218 EBAs were identified when Birdlife International established their Biodiversity project in 1987.A-Z of Areas of Biodiversity Importance: Endemic Bird Areas (EBA) accessed 10 May 2011 A secondary EBA comprises the range of only one restricted-range species. EBAs contain about 93% of the world's restricted-range bird species, as well as supporting support many more widespread species. Half the restricted-range species are threatened or near- threatened, with the other half especially vulnerable to the loss or degradation of their habitats because of the small size of their ranges. Most EBAs are also important for the conservation of other animals and of plants. Although they cover less than 5% of the world's land surface, their biological richness makes them high priorities for ecosystem conservation. The natural habitat of most EBAs is forest, especially tropical lowland forest and highland cloud forest, often comprising islands or mountain ranges, and varying in size from a few square kilometres to over 100,000 km2. Some 77% of EBAs lie in the tropics and subtropics. ;Restricted-range bird species A restricted-range bird species is a term coined by BirdLife International in conjunction with the identification of Endemic Bird Areas. It is defined as a landbird (i.e. not a seabird) species which is estimated to have had a breeding range of not more than 50,000 km2 since 1800. It includes birds which have become extinct which qualify on the range criterion. It does not include birds which, although they meet the range criterion today, were historically (since 1800) more widespread.

The NK-12 drives two large four-bladed contra- rotating propellers, diameter (NK-12MA), and diameter (NK-12MV). It is the most powerful turboprop engine to enter service. Design and development The design that eventually became the NK-12 turboprop was developed after World War II by a team of Russian scientists and deported German engineers under Ferdinand Brandner, who had worked for Junkers previously; the design bureau was headed by chief engineer Nikolai D. Kuznetsov. Thus, the NK-12 design evolved from late-war German turboprop studies. This started with the postwar development of the wartime Jumo 022 turboprop design that was designed to develop , weighing . The effort continued with a , weighing , completed by 1947. Evolution to the TV-12 engine required extensive use of new Soviet- developed alloys and was completed in 1951. The NK-12 remains the most powerful turboprop engine to enter service, although the Europrop TP400 (in 2005) has come close to this. Another engine of similar size, the Pratt & Whitney T57 with and jet thrust, ran 3,100 hours before being cancelled in 1957. The NK-12 powers the Tupolev Tu-95 bomber and its derivatives such as the Tu-142 maritime patrol aircraft and the Tupolev Tu-114 airliner (with NK-12MV), which still holds the title of the world's fastest propeller-driven aircraft despite being retired from service in 1991. It also powered the Antonov An-22 Antei (with NK-12MA), the world's largest aircraft at the time, and several types of amphibious assault craft, such as the A-90 Orlyonok \\"Ekranoplan\\". The engine has a 14-stage axial-flow compressor, producing pressure ratios between 9:1 and 13:1 depending on altitude, with variable inlet guide vanes and blow-off valves for engine operability. The combustion system used is a cannular-type: each flame tube is centrally mounted on a downstream injector that ends in an annular secondary region. The contra- rotating propellers and compressor are driven by the five-stage axial turbine. Mass flow is 65 kg (143 lb) per second.

Born in Sich√≥w Du≈ºy, she was a former member of the Solidarity movement and a Minister of Education. Biography She was the daughter of Red Prince Krzysztof Miko≈Çaj Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç and his wife, Zofia. In 1961, Anna Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç graduated from the faculty of history of the Warsaw University. Immediately after graduation, she started to work as a school teacher. In 1967, she completed her studies and obtained the title of doctor of humanistic sciences for her study on Educational ideology of the Sanacja and its reflection in education policies of 1926-1939. Her work was to be published the following year by the Polish Scientific Publishers PWN, but in 1968, after the anti-intelligentsia campaign of the communist authorities, it was banned by the censorship. She continued to work as a teacher of history and Polish language in various Warsaw-based schools. At the same time, she published a number of studies, mostly on history of education in Poland after 1945. Most of them were banned and were published underground, outside of the official system. In the 1970s, she also started cooperation with various undergrounds opposition newspapers, including Wiƒô≈∫, Znak, and Res Publica. After the legalization of the Solidarity movement, Anna Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç became one of its advisers. As such, she took part in various conferences between the communist authorities and the democratic opposition. The exact effect of these consultations was a reform of history education in Polish schools. For that she was awarded with the Golden Cross of Merit in 1981. However, the reform was finally halted by the introduction of martial law. In the underground, she started her work on various handbooks to Polish 20th century history. Some of them were published by the underground printing presses and were used by, among others, the so-called Flying University. After the democratic reforms of 1989 and the ousting of the communist authorities, Anna Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç was elected on 6 June 1989 to the Senate of Poland. She also assumed the post of a sub- secretary of state in the ministry of education in Tadeusz Mazowiecki's government. In 1992, she resigned her post and returned to university studies. Together with Wojciech Roszkowski she prepared a set of history handbooks for primary schools and lycea (published after 1994), which became the most widely used history handbooks for the period between 1789 and 1990 in Poland. In 1998, for her merits she was awarded with Commanders' Cross of the Polonia Restituta medal. In 1999, during the government of the Freedom Union- Solidarity Electoral Action coalition, Anna Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç returned to politics as an adviser to the minister of education. At the same time she became the deputy secretary of the Stefan Batory Foundation. Among her most notable duties was preparation of the reform of education in Poland. In 2001, she retired, but returned to public life as Deputy Minister of Education after being nominated by Miros≈Çaw Sawicki and confirmed. Death She died on 23 January 2009 in Warsaw, aged 69, from undisclosed causes.

The Independent Loyal Orange Institution is an offshoot of the Orange Institution, a Protestant fraternal organisation based in Northern Ireland. Foundation It was formed in Ireland in 1903 by Tom Sloan and others associated with the Belfast Protestant Association, who had been expelled from the Orange Order when they voiced opposition to it being used for party political ends by Ulster Unionist Party. Originally it was associated with the labour movement, but it soon realigned itself with traditional unionist politics. The class tensions within the Orange Order flared into rebellion in 1902. At an unruly Belfast County demonstration in Castlereagh, Thomas Sloan, Worshipful Master of the Belfast Protestant Association, challenged the County Grand Master, Colonel Saunderson MP, to say how he voted on the 'Inspection of Convent Laundries' bill. As the title suggests, this piece of legislation was an attempt to embarrass and annoy the Catholic Church by requiring that its convents (which militant Protestants suspected of exploiting the labour and the sexuality of young girls) be subject to government inspection. The point Sloan wished to make was that Saunderson, like most Unionist leaders, had put government interest before anti-Catholic principle. Although popular enough to win the Belfast South Westminster seat previously held by Willian Johnston of Ballykilbegs (a Protestant hero since his prison sentence in 1867 for defying a parades ban) Sloan was disciplined by Grand Lodge for embarrassing a grandee and led a breakaway. In the great Belfast Dock strike of 1907, the labour leader James Larkin was able to engage the support of Sloan and the independent Order. In 1903, Sloan had been the only Unionist MP to vote for the Miners' Eight Hour bill.Collins, Peter (1998). \\"Larkin, James\\", S.J. Connolly, The Oxford Companion to Irish History. Oxford University Press. p. 302 Activities Like the Orange Order it is a Protestant fraternal organisation dedicated to the principles of the Protestant Reformation. It takes its name in memory of King William of Orange of the house of Orange who fought at the Battle of the Boyne, brought about the Glorious Revolution and the Bill of Rights giving the Westminster parliament ultimate power of the country rather than the Monarch. The Independent Order is small compared to the main organisation with about 350‚Äì400 members.'Spirit of independence with Loyal Orange Institution' The News Letter 4 April 2018It is largely based around north County Antrim in Northern Ireland but has lodges around the world, including England, Scotland and Australia. Its annual main Twelfth of July demonstration is held in a north Antrim town or village. Along with the Orange Order and the Royal Black Institution, the Independent Orange Order in 2006 held talks with the Social Democratic and Labour Party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the Ulster Unionist Party, Alliance, the Chief Constable of the PSNI, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches, the Church of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to try to resolve issues around contested loyalist parades. The Independent Orange Order was represented by Free Presbyterian minister David McConaghie, then a prominent figure in both the DUP Suzanne Breen, \\"The battle for Upper Bann\\", Sunday Tribune, 17 April 2005Bill of Rights Forum websiteBelfast Telegraph news report, 16 November 2012Portadown Times news report, 16 November 2012Banbridge Leader news report, 16 November 2012UTV News report, 16 November 2012BBC news report, 16 November 2012 and the Caleb Foundation, an evangelical pressure group.The News Letter, 3 May 2006 There was no meeting with Sinn F√©in; McConaghie called on the IRA to apologise for the \\"slaughter\\" of 310 Orangemen who had been killed during the Troubles.The Irish Times, 3 May 2006 The annual Independent Orange Order demonstration on the Twelfth of July has in the past usually been addressed by Ian Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, although he is not a member. In 2012 the demonstration, held in Rasharkin, County Antrim, was led by McConaghie.Ballymoney Times report of 2012 Twelfth demonstration Beliefs The first notable effect after the formation of the Independent Order was a more liberal interpretation of the rules of the \\"old order.\\" In the early years of the Institution many suffered the full wrath of the \\"powers that be\\", who were opposed to any splitting of the Orange Order. Jobs were lost, homes were burnt and their headquarters in Belfast bombed. Independent Orangemen believe that while the \\"Old\\" Order maintains what they see as its totalitarian laws, its political affiliation, and its \\"spiritual weakness\\", the \\"principles of the Reformation\\" will not be kept to the fore in its ranks. Independent Orangeism today maintains that it is essential for the Orange Institution to be kept free from politics and to guard the principles of Reformation Protestantism. They often expressed alarm when they believed these principles were endangered by conciliatory politicians. They are opposed to ecumenism. While being opposed to Orangeism being linked to the Ulster Unionist Party they are not apolitical and tend to work alongside unionist politicians and parties. The structure and size of the Order lends itself to good communication and disciplined action based on that communication. Thus they have been able to participate in strikes, days of action, and parade protests. On occasions lodges have been given area responsibility as part of an overall co-ordinated, disciplined and peaceful protest action. The Institution also promotes Ulster Protestant history. This is most obvious during the Twelfth and other parades, but also involves lectures, tours of historic sites and commemorative publications. The Institution proclaims the principle of \\"Liberty of Conscience\\". They declare their right to think and act independently without direction from political or clerical masters. They seek to strengthen the position of Orangeism. They often warn of the danger of the development of a social and cultural Orangeism devoid of Protestant principle. Orange Arch They claim the support of all Protestants with their slogan: > Protestantism, not politics > Principles, not party > Measures, not men > Independent Orangemen believe that Protestantism is the religion of the Bible and the foundation of modern democracy. Degrees The Independent Orange Institution possesses 3 degrees ‚Äì the Orange, Plain Purple and the highly ritualistic Royal Arch Purple. The layout of the Independent Orange Institution degree system is outlined in the Independent Loyal Orange Institution 'candidate instruction' booklet which states: \\"There are three degrees in the Institution, the first being the Orange...Upon receipt of the Plain Purple degree a member is entitled to hold office in his Private Lodge and to attend the meetings of District. The Royal Arch Purple degree is the longest and most detailed degree. A member who receives this degree can attend County and Imperial Grand Lodge meetings.\\" This degree, worked within the Independent Orange, is in essence the same as that employed by the Royal Arch Purple Chapter, although like any distinct organisation it has some slight differences.

The character first appeared on 31 May 2004 and made his departure on 31 December 2006. Storylines Danny moves to Weatherfield to help his uncle Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) with his business, Underworld. Not long afterwards, his wife Frankie Baldwin (Debra Stephenson), who had previously cheated on him, arrives in Weatherfield as she wants to give their marriage another chance. They are soon joined by Danny's two sons, Warren Baldwin (Danny Young) and Jamie Baldwin (Rupert Hill). Unaware of Frankie's intentions, Danny has a brief fling with shop assistant Sunita Parekh (Shobna Gulati) shortly after his arrival, but Sunita does not know that Danny is married and is very hurt when Frankie turns up. The Baldwins then rent No. 7 Coronation Street from Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones). Danny's father Harry dies, and his mother, Viv, (Patricia Brake), comes to stay and reveals to Mike and Danny a secret she had kept since his birth. Mike is actually Danny's biological father, the product of an affair she had with Mike. Danny's uncle Harry had brought him up believing him to be his own son. Danny embarks on a passionate affair with Jamie's girlfriend Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson). When this is finally revealed, Jamie is heartbroken. Frankie throws Danny out and he moves in with Leanne. Mike becomes ill with Alzheimer's disease. Danny is initially determined to use Mike's illness to gain control of the factory and Mike's other assets and manages to get power of attorney but as his condition deteriorates, Danny's emotions get the better of him and he is genuinely upset at the decline of his dad. Mike's death in April 2006, hits Danny hard. Leanne, now engaged to Danny, finds a more recent will amongst Mike's belongings in which he leaves everything to his youngest son, Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson). Leanne uses the will to blackmail Danny, demanding ¬£100,000 and leaves Weatherfield after Danny throws her out. Danny continues to try to reconcile with Frankie, and nearly succeeds; but is shocked and appalled to discover that Frankie is having an affair with Jamie. Danny goes on a downwards spiral, sells his share of the factory to Paul Connor (Sean Gallagher) who had already bought Adam's share, and leaves Weatherfield for Spain. He is last seen with a beautiful woman on his arm, where he phones Jamie to wish him a Happy New Year. Creation and development In an interview with Chris Evans on OFI Sunday on 11 December 2005, Bradley Walsh revealed that the character was originally to have been called \\"Vic Baldwin\\", but that he asked the producers if the name could be changed to that of his own father, who had recently died.

She was introduced as part of the Baldwin family along with Danny Baldwin (Bradley Walsh), Jamie Baldwin (Rupert Hill) and Warren Baldwin (Danny Young). She made her first appearance during the episode airing on 6 June 2004. Stephenson quit the role in 2006 and Frankie departed on screen on 31 December 2006. Storylines Glamorous Frankie met her husband Danny (Bradley Walsh) when she worked as a babysitter for his son Jamie (Rupert Hill). Even though he was still married to his first wife Carol, Frankie could not resist sleeping with Danny, as she had fallen in love with him. They had a son of their own, Warren (Danny Young), and she also became close to her stepson Jamie after she married Danny. He cheated on her numerous times, but she continued to forgive him until he cheated on her with Jamie's girlfriend Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson). Upon entering Weatherfield, Frankie appeared stuck up and prissy, eager for Danny to sell the house they shared in London so they could move into somewhere more suitable. Frankie exploded when she discovered Danny had slept with Sunita Parekh (Shobna Gulati), and declared war on her. This perhaps is what drew her to Sunita's nemesis Maya Sharma (Sasha Behar). However, after learning of Maya's true nature, she apologised to Sunita and forgave her. After a while, Frankie began to settle into the street more - especially after striking up a bond with Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn). When Vera was ill, Frankie took care of her by doing her chores for her, filling in her job for her and advised her husband Jack (Bill Tarmey) to be more sensitive and attentive to Vera's needs. This led to Frankie securing a permanent position at the cafe, where she works with enemy Leanne. Frankie saw Leanne as not worthy for Jamie, and became suspicious of her cheating on him. Frankie discovered Leanne's affair with her husband Danny when Leanne lost her phone. Leanne and Danny had arranged to meet at a hotel but Leanne cancelled at the last minute. Annoyed, Danny rang her phone and said all the things he wanted to do to Leanne - not aware that Frankie was on the other end of the line. Frankie chucked Danny out and from then on she lived with Jamie, and Jamie's mother Carol (Lynne Pearson). But after Carol accused Frankie and Jamie of sleeping with each other, Frankie kicked Carol out, and Carol left the street for good. Danny, regretting losing her and scared at the thought of spending the rest of his life with Leanne, begged Frankie to take him back. Frankie remained strong and the divorce went ahead, with Frankie moving boyfriend Nathan in just days before. She celebrated her divorce by jetting off alone for a holiday in her newly acquired Villa in Spain. In October 2006 Frankie's former stepson Jamie declared his love for her at Fred Elliott's (John Savident) funeral and they kissed but the revelation shocked her and drove her back into the arms of ex-husband Danny. However she couldn't resist Jamie's advances and they embarked on a relationship, much to the disgust of the other residents of the street. The news also led to Danny disappearing. Frankie and Jamie decided to head to Spain to start afresh, but at the last minute on New Year's Eve 2006, Frankie got cold feet. She ended it with a devastated Jamie, and left to stay with a friend in Essex. As she departed in a taxi, Jamie was consoled by friend Sean Tully (Antony Cotton). But the misery wasn't over - at midnight Jamie received a call from father, Danny, telling him he had sold the flat and he was \\"sorry\\" to hear about his break up with Frankie. In 2009, Roy (David Neilson) and Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) are invited to Frankie's wedding to a footballer in Coronation Street: Romanian Holiday, but they arrive a week late. Frankie lets them stay in her villa while she is honeymooning. Creation and development Debra Stephenson (pictured) played Frankie for two and a half years.On 6 May 2004, it was announced that former Bad Girls actress Debra Stephenson had joined Coronation Street as Frankie. One storyline in 2005 saw Frankie's husband Danny have an affair with Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson). Frankie later discovered the affair when she answers Leanne's mobile and finds her husband is on the other end. Danny had organised to spend another night with Leanne holed-up in a hotel room. When Leanne doesn't show, Danny rings her to find out where she is, but he does not realise it's his wife answering the phone. Seeing her husband's name come up on the mobile, Frankie has answered, and mimicked Leanne's voice. Danny, who has told his wife he is away on business, says he has booked the best hotel room. Frankie tells him: \\"It's not Leanne, it's me,\\" and orders Danny to come home. Frankie kept the affair secret in order to protect Danny's son Jamie (Rupert Hill). On 14 May 2006, it was announced that Stephenson had quit her role as Frankie. Stephenson said: \\"I had originally only planned to stay for two years but I didn't anticipate how much I would enjoy playing Frankie. I'm also keen to pursue other acting projects and I'm very excited about what the future holds.\\" A Coronation Street spokeswoman said: \\"Debra has been a great asset to the show and her portrayal of Frankie Baldwin has been fantastic.

He was elected from South Carolina in both the Continental Congress and the U.S. House. He later was appointed as Treasurer of the United States and served from 1801 to his death in 1828, establishing a record as the longest-serving Treasurer. Biography Thomas was born in St. George's, Bermuda to a family prominent in that colony since his ancestors immigrated from England in 1662. His parents were Henry (1713‚Äì1785) and Ann Tucker. As a youth, Thomas studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. After graduating in 1770, he moved first to Virginia in the 1760s, then settled in Charleston, South Carolina (which had been settled from Bermuda in 1670, under the leadership of William Sayle, and which had a large community of expatriate Bermudians) and opened a practice. His younger brother St. George Tucker followed him to Virginia, studying law and eventually being appointed as Chief Justice of the Virginia Supreme Court. Tucker was an early supporter of the cause of American independence. He was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1776, and served there in various years until 1788. In 1781 he joined the Continental Army as a hospital surgeon supporting the Southern Department, and served until 1783. South Carolina sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1787 and again in 1788. He is believed to have played a key role in a plot to supply the rebel army with gunpowder stolen from a British magazine in his Bermudian homeland. In 1775, after the Battle of Lexington, the Continental Congress announced a trade embargo against British colonies remaining loyal to the Crown. Bermuda, with its control of the Turks Islands, and a large merchant fleet, offered to supply the Patriots with salt, but they were unimpressed and asked for gunpowder. Meanwhile, in June 1775, the fiercely loyal Governor of Bermuda, George James Bruere, who had lost one of his sons, John, who was killed fighting on the British side at the Battle of Bunker Hill,Keith Archibald Forbes, Bermuda's History from 1700 to 1799 at bermuda-online.org, accessed 25 February 2011 was enraged when, on 14 August, Bermudians sympathetic to the Revolution stole the island's supply of gunpowder from the Powder Magazine in St George's and shipped it to the rebels. Trade with Bermuda developed, for which Bruere was not blamed in London.W. Kerr, \\"Bermuda and the American Revolution\\" in Bermuda Historical Quarterly, vol. XXV, No. 1 (1968), p. 47 This was despite the implication of his Bermudian relatives in the act of treason. The President of the Governor's Council, and occasional acting Governor of Bermuda, was Bruere's son-in-law, Henry Tucker, who was Thomas T. Tucker's older brother. Most notably, among other prominent Bermudians, their father, a Colonel of the Militia, as well as their brother, St. George Tucker, were believed to have been involved in organising the theft. Thomas Tudor Tucker is believed to have suggested that George Washington write the letter, addressed to the people of Bermuda, which had sparked the act of treason, and that it had been delivered into the hands of his relatives in Bermuda.Jewish Sightseeing: Bermuda scion links with Zion . S. D. Jewish Press-Heritage. 5 Nov, 1999 The plot was organised by persons highly-enough placed that no one was ever prosecuted. The letter from Washington had read: Tucker was opposed to the United States Constitution, believing that it gave too much authority to the central government. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives and served in the first two congresses from 1789 until 1793. On December 1, 1801 President Jefferson appointed Tucker as Treasurer of the United States. He held that post through four administrations (Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and J.Q. Adams), serving until his death in 1828. Tucker holds the record as the longest-serving Treasurer: 26 years, 153 days. During this time, he also served as physician to President Madison (1809‚Äì1817). Tucker died while in office at Washington, D.C. and is buried in the Congressional Cemetery. His nephew, Henry St. George Tucker, Sr., was a U.S. Congressman from Virginia. His nephew Thomas Tudor Tucker stayed with the Bermuda branch of the family and served as an admiral in the British Navy. The gravestone of Thomas Tucker Congressional Cemetery Works Tucker published an oration that was delivered in Charleston before the South Carolina Society of the Cincinnati (Charleston, 1795).

born to an aristocratic Russian family with maternal Italian ancestry. He came to the United States as a young man after starting as a designer in Rome, and quickly got work with Paramount Pictures. Cassini established his reputation by designing for films. He became particularly well known as a designer for Jacqueline Kennedy while she was First Lady of the United States. The \\"Jackie Look\\" was to become highly influential and much admired. Among Cassini's inspirations were sports and Native American culture. Early life He was born in Paris as Oleg Aleksandrovich Loiewski, the elder son of Countess Marguerite Cassini and her husband Count Alexander Loiewski, a Russian diplomat, thereby obtaining the title of Count. His maternal grandfather Arthur Paul Nicholas Cassini, Marquis de Capuzzuchi di Bologna, Count Cassini, had been the Russian ambassador to the United States during the administrations of William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. Count Arthur Cassini signed the Treaty ending the war between Japan and China. His mother's family claimed Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini as an ancestor. In 1918, the Russian Revolution caused the Loiewski family to flee for their lives, leaving behind their wealth, lands, and homes. As a young child, Oleg saw his cousin shot to death. The family reached Denmark and next moved to Switzerland. The Greek Royal family invited them to Greece, but, while traveling through Italy, revolution began in Greece as well. They got off the train in Florence, eventually settling there. In Italy the children started using the surname of Cassini. In his early youth, Cassini suffered a major accident, almost losing his leg. He spent much of a year in bed in recovery, during which time he studied history and read extensively, including authors such as American James Fenimore Cooper. He developed a love of history and the mysticism of Native American tribes. He also discovered American culture through the movies from the United States that were shown in Italy. When he started school, Oleg had to learn Italian, but he already knew Russian, French and Danish. His mother, Marguerite Cassini, founded her fashion house in Florence, gaining American clients from people she knew in Washington, D.C., as the daughter of the Count Arthur Cassini. Cassini played soccer with the teenage team, the \\"Boys\\" of Fiorentina, and was on the university track and ski teams. He also played tennis for the Italian Jr. Davis Cup team, becoming Italian Jr. Champion. =Education= Cassini studied Political Science at the University of Florence and became an accomplished equestrian. He studied fine art under painter Giorgio de Chirico at the Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze. Eventually he started in fashion, studying under the French couturier, Jean Patou. Cassini won a number of international fashion competitions in Turin, including five first prizes in Mostra Della Moda for sketches and Most Creative Presentation for an evening dress painted in dramatic colors on silver foil, garnering a prize of 5,000 lire. Cassini opened his own boutique in Rome and designed for the local film industry as well as Roman society. =Move to America= Oleg became engaged to a debutante in Rome, Anna Donnina Toeplitz, and subsequently left for America after winning a duel. He sailed to America on the Saturnia and arrived in New York on Christmas Day 1936. His autobiography describes his possessions upon arrival in America as being limited to a tuxedo, two tennis rackets, a title, and talent. He briefly worked as a political cartoonist in Washington, D.C., upon his arrival prior to traveling to Hollywood. Career =Hollywood, California= Upon arriving in California, Cassini began playing tennis at the West Side Tennis Club. After he competed in and won a doubles tournament, his partner introduced himself as the head of Paramount Pictures, saying he was \\"looking for another designer\\". Cassini went to the studio the next day and got the job as a full designer for Paramount Pictures. In 1941, his first film was I Wanted Wings, for which he created the look for its star, newcomer Veronica Lake. Cassini designed costumes for films including The Shanghai Gesture (1941), starring Gene Tierney, Tales of Manhattan (1942) for Rita Hayworth, The Razor's Edge (1946), It's a Joke Son! (1947), Born to Speed (1947), Lost Honeymoon (1947), The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947), That Wonderful Urge (1948), Whirlpool (1949), Night and the City (1950), Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950), as well as The Mating Season, Close to My Heart, On the Riviera (all 1951), Rampage (1963), The Tammy Grimes Show (1966), The Day Dreamer (1966), Peligro ... ! Mujeres en acci√≥n, (1967), The Ambushers (1967) for Dean Martin, SOS Conspiracion Bikini (1967), The Sentinel (2006) for Kim Basinger, and Say It in Russian (2007) for Faye Dunaway. His designs are worn in the climactic scene of Meet Joe Black (1998) and throughout Ready or Not (2009). He worked for the major film studios and dressed numerous stars over the course of his career including Audrey Hepburn, Shirley Temple, Anita Ekberg, Janet Leigh, Loretta Young, Rita Hayworth, Betty Grable, Joan Crawford, Marilyn Monroe, Natalie Wood, Ursula Andress, Jayne Mansfield, Lana Turner, Sandra Dee, Suzy Parker, Gina Lollobrigida, Ren√©e Zellweger, Malin √Ökerman, Kim Basinger, Carroll Baker and Taylor Swift. =World War II= After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Cassini quickly enlisted in the war effort. Initially, he joined the United States Coast Guard, but he later served in the U.S. Army as a cavalry officer. He reached the rank of 1st Lieutenant. Cassini became a United States citizen (in December 1941/January 1942, losing his titles of nobility); he was commissioned as a First Lieutenant at Fort Riley, Kansas. After serving five years in the U.S. Cavalry, Cassini moved to New York City in 1952 to open his own fashion house on Seventh Avenue, the center of the fashion industry. =New York, New York= After the war, Cassini designed ready-to-wear dresses while continuing to design for television, motion pictures, and Broadway theatre. According to his autobiography, Jack L. Warner offered Cassini the position of head of design for Warner Bros. Studios proclaiming, \\"You're better than Errol Flynn\\". He remained in New York rather than work with Warner Brothers and opened his own designer brand. Cassini had enough money to launch one line, his first Collection, which was received with rave reviews. The head of Lord & Taylor, Dorothy Shaver, provided the Oleg Cassini Collection the entirety of the store's Fifth Avenue store front windows to launch the collection. Cassini also took his designs \\"on the road\\" to his customers in trunk shows and special fashion events in order to promote the new lines. The in store events evolved into the emerging medium of television and Cassini displayed his product on Steve Allen, Jack Paar, Dinah Shore, Phil Donahue, and Good Morning America. The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson provided nightly recognition as Carson had a line designed for him by Cassini, which he wore exclusively for the show. His reputation developed as a result of his genius for original spontaneous design and in 1953, shortly before her marriage to John Kennedy, Cassini met Jacqueline Bouvier, named by his brother, society columnist Cholly Knickerbocker as \\"Queen Deb of the Year\\" in 1947. =Secretary of Style to the White House= Cassini's appointment by Jacqueline Kennedy as her exclusive couturier in 1961 dubbed him her \\"Secretary of Style\\" and provided him a position of prestige. \\"We are on the threshold of a new American elegance thanks to Mrs. Kennedy's beauty, naturalness, understatement, exposure and symbolism,\\" Cassini said when his selection as the couturier to shape the entire look of the First Lady was announced. Utilizing the technique and high fashion fabrics of French couture, Cassini's unique designs for Jacqueline Kennedy ushered in a new era of timeless simplicity based on clean lines and crisp forms and opulent and luxurious fabrics. Cassini brought American design to the world stage as the First Lady's identity became synonymous with sophistication and taste. The \\"Jackie look\\" that he created was copied by women all over the world. Cassini visualized her as an American Queen and Mrs. Kennedy acknowledged that \\"Oleg dressed me for the part\\". The publicity Cassini derived from his work for Mrs. Kennedy led women from 18 to 80 to copy the look of simple, geometric dresses in sumptuous fabrics and pillbox hats with an elegant coiffure. Meticulously tailored and featuring oversized buttons and boxy jackets, as well as occasionally dramatic d√©colletage. Cassini designed a reported 300 outfits for the First Lady, including a much-copied coat made of leopard pelts and a Swiss double satin white gown decorated by a single cocarde which she wore to the Inaugural Gala Ball in 1961. This was Mrs. Kennedy's first official appearance as First Lady Elect. The dress was subsequently named one of the \\"50 Dresses that Changed the World\\" by the Design Museum in England. In 1961, Eugenia Sheppard announced in the New York Herald Tribune, \\"According to Tobe's most recent coast to coast survey, the best known name in American fashion is Oleg Cassini.\\" =Designer licensing= Cassini in the 1974 AMC Matador showing some of the interior trim he designed Cassini became known primarily for his licensing agreements. He was the recipient of a Doctorate of Fine Arts, in 1989, His name adorned everything from luggage to nail polish, as well as special luxurious coup√© versions of the 1974 and 1975 AMC Matador automobile. Outside, striping, rub rails, wheel covers and a crest mark the Matador as Cassini's. He helped promote the car in AMC's advertising. The special Oleg Cassini Matador was positioned in the popular and highly competitive \\"personal luxury car\\" market segment. The \\"distinctive\\" styling of the Cassini \\"designer editions\\" merit collector interest Recognition =Milestones= In 1960, with his younger brother, society columnist Igor, Oleg opened Le Club in Manhattan, which becomes a leading private club with such members as Gianni Agnelli, Stavros Niarchos, Aristotle Onassis, and Ray Stark. In 1960 Oleg Cassini was named personal couturier by Mrs. Kennedy, launching the Jackie look in 1961. He was awarded the Chicago Gold Coast Award for Excellence in Design. In 1962, he was awarded the National Cystic Fibrosis Distinguished Service Citation. In 1967, he created deep tonal shirts for men adding special colors where there had only been white. The sales of dress shirts rose dramatically, and the look was launched on The Tonight Show, Starring Johnny Carson. Oleg created the \\"Johnny Carson\\" line of Men's wear. In 1968, the Peacock Revolution is hailed by Newsweek, wherein Cassini is credited with leading a revolution in men's fashion worldwide. The \\"Competitors\\" Collection menswear campaign was also launched by Cassini. It featured icons of sport wearing Cassini including: Ted Turner for sailing, Bob Hope and Raymond Floyd for golf, Michael Jordan for basketball, Mario Andretti for racing, Gary Carter for baseball, Lynn Swann and Lawrence Taylor for football and Charlton Heston, Regis Philbin, and Kenny Rogers for tennis. In 2003 The Council of Fashion Designers of America Board of Directors noted Cassini's extraordinary design achievements with their first ever, Board of Directors Special Tribute. The presentation was made to Oleg by President Stan Herman and Diane von Furstenberg. In 2003, Cassini was crowned King of the Beaux Arts Ball. =Sportsman= Oleg Cassini excelled at tennis and competed seriously since his early days as a ranked Italian Junior Davis Cup player. His skill at tennis led to a fortuitous design connection. Recounted in his autobiography, newly arrived in Hollywood, Cassini played tennis at the prestigious West Side Tennis Club which led to a doubles game with the head of Paramount Pictures. Decades later, Cassini also created collections of printed and multi color tennis wear, bringing 'color to the court'. He is noted for having outfitted the US Davis Cup team and for participating in celebrity pro-am tournaments such as the Alan King Tournament in Las Vegas. Cassini also participated and won the 5th Annual RFK Pro Celebrity Tennis Tournament in 1976. The silver winner's cup was presented to him personally by Jackie Kennedy Onassis. Cassini competed professionally in the sport of harness racing. In 1985 he earned a professional harness racer license and won races at the Meadowlands Raceway, Yonkers Raceway, Freehold Raceway, Monticello Raceway, and Roosevelt Raceway. He received awards in recognition of his efforts to support equine charities from \\"HORSE\\" and \\"The Equine Society\\" which recognized Cassini with its Man of the year award. He participated in golfing events, scoring three holes in one at the Deepdale Golf Club and one hole in one at the Westhampton Golf Club. Cassini also participated in the ABC TV Superstars Competition. =Humanitarian= Oleg Cassini received the James Herriot Award (All Creatures Great and Small) as the Man of the Year from the Humane Society of the United States for his work and care for animals. He created collections of manmade fashion fur, the 'evolutionary furs'. In 1999, he was awarded the Humanitarian Award at a fashion show and Gala at the National Building Museum in Washington, DC, honorary chairpersons Eunice Shriver and Senator Ted Kennedy, show hosted by Montel Williams. Among the 40 models were movie star Tippi Hedren. In his own words \\"What we're designing is as elegant and attractive as fur and eliminates the enormous cruelty that goes on in the killing of animals for fur.\\" In his autobiography Cassini claims to have suggested to President Kennedy that he take steps to organize The Bureau of Indian Affairs, the action which led to the American Indian Movement. Cassini was named an honorary member of the Chickasaw and Navajo nations in 1981 due to his fund raising and organization of gala charity events for the tribes. Cassini and his brother, Igor under the pen name of society columnist Cholly Knickerbocker, threw \\"The Knickerbocker Charity Balls\\" to raise money for the tribes. Books and television An author of best-selling books, In My Own Fashion, A Thousand Days of Magic: Dressing Jacqueline Kennedy for the White House a book which is a tribute to Jacqueline Kennedy and reflects the \\"Camelot Era\\" and the \\"Jackie Look\\", and Oleg Cassini: The Wedding Dress. Cassini appeared on hundreds of television shows worldwide in many languages and also hosted a special 13-part TV series, Conversations with Cassini, on the Arts & Entertainment Network. Personal life On 2 September 1938, in Elkton, Maryland, Cassini became the husband of Mary \\"Merry\\" Fahrney (1910-1974). The couple divorced in 1940. Cassini married actress Gene Tierney, on 2 June 1941. Their daughter, Antoinette Daria, was born on 15 October 1943 blind, deaf and with severe brain damage.In My Own Fashion, pp. 155‚Äì156 She died on 11 September 2010. The couple separated on 20 October 1946, and entered into a property settlement agreement on 10 November 1946 in which Cassini's fifty percent share of the marital estate was dedicated to the ongoing care of Daria. Tierney won an uncontested divorce in California on 13 March 1947, and the divorce would have been finalized one year later, on 13 March 1948. However, according to Cassini's diary, they reconciled some months before that. They announced that they were back together in April 1948. Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper reported the news in the Los Angeles Times on 9 April 1948. They finally divorced in 1953. Christina \\"Tina\\" was born on 19 November 1948. After his divorce from Gene Tierney, Cassini dated and was engaged to Grace Kelly. Susanna Moore claims that she was raped by Cassini. He and Tierney remained cordial until her 1991 death, when she bequeathed one dollar to her daughter Daria and the residual to Christina. In 1971, Cassini married model Marianne Nestor. Beginning in 1971, Marianne operated the licensing and public relations portion of the brand, which they famously defended.https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D28VarzU4AA-ksX.jpg:large Their marriage was kept secret until after his death; Marianne and his daughter Tina engaged in a bitter court battle over the estate. The status of that struggle was updated in an article in Vanity Fair in 2010. Christina died in 2015. A piece in Newsday, updated in September 2018 updated the history of the legal battle; at the time Marianne was in jail for refusing to comply with a court order. Cassini's estate was auctioned by Doyle in June 2019. Death Oleg Cassini died from complications of an aneurysm in Manhasset, New York, in 2006. He is survived by his wife, Marianne.

It was built in 1924 by local theater owner Joseph Barnett and houses the Sunshine Theater as well as commercial space and offices. The Sunshine operated primarily as a movie theater until the 1980s, though it was also equipped for Vaudeville shows and other live performances. Since 1990 it has operated as a live music venue, hosting many notable acts. The building was listed on the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1985 and is also an Albuquerque City Landmark. The building was designed by the El Paso firm of Trost & Trost and is of reinforced concrete construction with a facade of yellow brick. The architectural style is Renaissance Revival. The building was known for having what was believed to be the last manually operated elevator in New Mexico. One of the building's longest running commercial tenants was F. D. Fogg and Company, a local jeweler which operated there from 1948 to 1985. The company closed in 2004 after 83 years in business. The TV Show In Plain Sight filmed the exterior of this location, as the fictional office of the US Marshals' Witness Protection Service. History The Sunshine Building was built in 1923‚Äì24 by Joseph Barnett (1866‚Äì1954), an Italian-American businessman who arrived in Albuquerque penniless in 1896 and worked his way up through the saloon and theater business to become one of the city's largest property owners. By the 1920s, Barnett already owned two theaters in the city, the B at 200 West Central and the Lyric at 312 West Central, but planned an even larger one for his new building along with five floors of offices. The building was constructed on the former site of the White Elephant building, a two-story adobe structure dating to 1881 which once housed a popular gambling hall and saloon. The Sunshine Building was designed by the El Paso firm of Trost & Trost, which was also responsible for several other buildings in the immediate area including the Rosenwald Building, Occidental Life Building, and First National Bank Building. The Sunshine Theater opened on May 1, 1924, with a showing of the Ram√≥n Novarro film Scaramouche. With a seating capacity of 1,200, central heating and cooling, and fireproof reinforced concrete construction, it was advertised as \\"the most modern and beautiful theater in the southwest\\" and was considered Albuquerque's first movie palace. The Albuquerque Journal reported that the opening was a \\"grand success\\" with the theater filled to capacity for multiple showings. The theater was equipped for both films and live performances, including the traveling Vaudeville shows that were popular in the 1920s. The building also contained 73 office rooms on the upper stories and five ground-floor commercial spaces. In 1935, Barnett merged his theater interests with those of the Bachechi family, including the KiMo Theater, which put most of Albuquerque's theaters under the same ownership. By 1952, the chain, Albuquerque Exhibitors, controlled 10 local theaters and had 170 employees. The company leased its theaters in 1956 to the Texas-based Frontier Theaters chain, which was taken over by Commonwealth Theaters in 1967. Commonwealth chose not to renew its lease on the Sunshine when the original lease expired in 1974, citing a lack of customers, and the theater stopped showing first-run films. Later it switched to classic 1930s and 1940s movies, then Spanish-language films. In 1983, the Sunshine Building was proposed for demolition in order to build a \\"Festival Marketplace\\" development. Supporters of the project believed it would revitalize the mostly vacant area around First and Central, while preservationists opposed the demolition and organized a \\"Save the Sunshine\\" committee. The debate was reported in the National Trust for Historic Preservation's national Preservation News publication in 1984. Ultimately, the project was abandoned. In 1990, the Sunshine Theater was converted into a live music venue. One of the first acts to perform there was Soundgarden (mistakenly identified as \\"Sound Garden\\" in the local press) on February 14, 1990. The theater has remained one of Albuquerque's most popular mid-size concert venues and continues to host live music as of 2019. Architecture The Second Street facade (west side) of the Sunshine Building The Sunshine Building is a six- story, concrete-framed structure at the southeast corner of Second Street and Central Avenue. The building is tall and has a footprint of . It is faced with marble on the ground floor and yellow brick on the upper levels. The architecture is usually identified as Renaissance Revival, with decorative brickwork and pilasters, a heavy cornice, and a balustraded parapet. The building is further decorated with swags, medallions, and other ornaments. Like the nearby First National Bank Building, the Sunshine Building was constructed with blank walls on two sides to accommodate neighboring structures. with By the time of the 1980s Festival Marketplace controversy, the building was the only structure left on the block and its detractors criticized the \\"not so handsome\\" wall greeting traffic entering Downtown. In 2001, the Century Theatres Downtown building was built next to the Sunshine, obscuring the blank walls. The building has ground-floor commercial space and five floors of offices wrapped around the central theater space. In its original configuration, the theater had 800 orchestra seats and 400 balcony seats, though most of the seating was removed when it was converted for live music use. The proscenium arch is wide by high, and the fly gallery has a height of from the stage to the grid deck. The balcony is reached from staircases on either side of the theater, with a mezzanine containing restrooms. The office section has a separate entrance lobby opening onto Second Street. The building was notable for having what was believed to be the last manually operated elevator in New Mexico, which was staffed by elevator operators until at least 1989. Sunshine Theater The Sunshine Theater, which occupies a significant portion of the building, operated as a movie theater from 1924 until the 1980s and has since been remodeled into a popular live music venue. The Sunshine Theater has hosted a number of notable acts such as The Strokes, Snoop Dogg, Deltron 3030, Stone Temple Pilots, The Smashing Pumpkins, Queens of the Stone Age, The Dead Weather, Arctic Monkeys, Modest Mouse, Rancid, Coheed and Cambria, Awolnation, Cannibal Corpse, Ratatat, Social Distortion, Pennywise, Hollywood Undead, Deftones, Nightwish, Melanie Martinez, Damian Marley and Deadmau5 among others. The Sunshine Theater's set up is an open floor, a large balcony, and a bar that seats a 21 and older audience, in all they accommodate about 1,000 people. The theater is the most popular venue in the Albuquerque metro area to accommodate smaller but still notable acts, many with five or more shows in one month.

It was first held in the late 18th century in Ulster. It celebrates the Glorious Revolution (1688) and victory of Protestant King William of Orange over Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne (1690), which began the Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. On and around the Twelfth, large parades are held by the Orange Order and Ulster loyalist marching bands, streets are bedecked with British flags and bunting, and large towering bonfires are lit. Today the Twelfth is mainly celebrated in Ulster (especially in Northern Ireland, where it is a public holiday), but smaller celebrations are held in other parts of the world where Orange lodges have been set up. The Twelfth involves thousands of participants and spectators. In Ulster, where about half the population is from a Protestant background and half from a Catholic background, the Twelfth has been accompanied by violence since its beginning. Many see the Orange Order and its marches as sectarian, triumphalist and supremacist. The Order is also politically a unionist/loyalist organisation. Violence related to the Twelfth in Northern Ireland worsened during the 30-year ethno-political conflict known as the Troubles. The Drumcree conflict is the most well-known dispute involving Orange marches. Attempts have recently been made to downplay the political aspects of the marches and present the Twelfth as a cultural, family-friendly event at which tourists are welcome. When 12 July falls on a Sunday, the parades are held on Monday the 13th instead. Origins A Lambeg drumming contest, County Tyrone Shankill Road decorated with flags and bunting for The Twelfth Orangemen commemorated several events dating from the 17th century onwards, celebrating the continued dominance of Protestantism in Ireland after the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and triumph in the Williamite War in Ireland (1689‚Äì91). Early celebrations were 23 October, the anniversary of the 1641 rebellion (an attempted coup d'√©tat by Catholic gentry who tried to seize control of the English administration in Ireland); and 4 November, the birthday of William of Orange, Protestant victor of the Williamite war in the 1690s. Both of these anniversaries faded in popularity by the end of the 18th century. The Twelfth itself originated as a celebration of the Battle of Aughrim, which took place on 12 July 1691 in the 'Old Style' (O.S.) Julian calendar then in use. Aughrim was the decisive battle of the Williamite war, in which the predominantly Irish Catholic Jacobite army was destroyed and the remainder capitulated at Limerick, whereas the Boyne was less decisive. The Twelfth in the early 18th century was a popular commemoration of Aughrim, featuring bonfires and parades. The Battle of the Boyne (fought on 1 July 1690) was commemorated with smaller parades on 1 July. However, the two events were combined in the late 18th century. The first reason for this was the British switch to the Gregorian calendar in 1752, which repositioned the nominal date of the Battle of the Boyne to 11 July New Style (N.S.) (with the Battle of Aughrim nominally repositioned to 23 July N.S.). The second reason was the foundation of the Orange Order in 1795. The Order preferred the Boyne, due to William of Orange's presence there. It has also been suggested that in the 1790s (a time of Roman Catholic resurgence) the Boyne, where the Jacobites were routed, was more appealing to the Order than Aughrim, where they had fought hard and died in great numbers.Padraig Lenihan, 1690 Battle of the Boyne, page 258-260) The Order's first marches took place on 12 July 1796 in Portadown, Lurgan and Waringstown.McCormack, W J. The Blackwell Companion to Modern Irish Culture. Wiley-Blackwell, 2001. Page 317. The Twelfth parades of the early 19th century often led to public disorder, so much so that the Orange Order and the Twelfth were banned in the 1830s and 40s (see below). Events An \\"Orange Arch\\" and bunting raised over a road in Annalong (see here for more pictures) =Lead-up to the Twelfth= In the weeks leading up to the Twelfth, Orange Order and other Ulster loyalist marching bands hold numerous parades in Northern Ireland. The most common of these are lodge parades, in which one Orange lodge marches with one band. Others, such as the \\"mini-Twelfth\\" at the start of July, involve several lodges. From June to August, Protestant, unionist areas of Northern Ireland are bedecked with flags and bunting, which are usually flown from lamp-posts and houses. The most common flags flown are the Union Jack and Ulster Banner. Kerbstones may be painted red, white and blue and murals may be made. Steel or wooden arches, bedecked with flags and Orange symbolism, are raised over certain streets.Jarman, Neil. Material Conflicts: Parades and Visual Displays in Northern Ireland. Berg, 1997. p.209 These 'Orange arches' are inspired by triumphal arches. As well as the Union Jack and Ulster Banner, the flags of illegal loyalist paramilitary groups‚Äîsuch as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA)‚Äîare flown in some areas. The raising of these flags near Catholic/Irish nationalist neighbourhoods, or in \\"neutral\\" areas, often leads to tension and sometimes violence. It is seen as deliberately provocative and intimidating.\\"Loyalists erect flags outside Catholic primary school and church in Carrick\\". Belfast Telegraph. 22 June 2012. =Eleventh Night= A bonfire prepared for the 11th night in Newtownabbey On the night before The Twelfth‚Äîthe \\"Eleventh Night\\"‚Äîhuge towering bonfires are lit in many Protestant unionist neighbourhoods in Northern Ireland. In many of these areas the bonfires are family-friendly community celebrations. However, not all Protestants attend the bonfires and most Catholics avoid them. They have been condemned for displays of sectarian and ethnic hatred, anti-social behaviour, and for the damage and pollution caused by the fires. The flag of the Republic of Ireland, Irish nationalist symbols, Catholic symbols, and effigies, are usually burnt on the fires. More recently, symbols of the large Polish immigrant community have been burnt on the fires, which the Polish Association of Northern Ireland has described as \\"racist intimidation\\".\\"Poland flags burned on bonfires across Belfast on 11 July\\"BBC News19 July 2012 Loyalist paramilitaries have also used the event to hold \\"shows of strength\\", in which masked gunmen fire volleys of shots into the air and petrol bombs used to light the bonfire. However, in recent years, there have been attempts to make the bonfires more family-friendly and environmentally-friendly.\\"The boy and the bonfire\\". Belfast Telegraph, 9 July 2010. =Main events= The main way in which the Twelfth is celebrated is through large parades involving Orangemen and supporting bands. Most of the parades are in Ulster, almost exclusively being held in Northern Ireland and County Donegal, although Orange lodges elsewhere often hold parades as well. The parade usually begins at an Orange Hall, proceeds through the town or city and out to a large park or field where the marchers, their friends and family, and the general public gather to eat, drink and listen to speeches by clergymen, politicians and senior members of the Order. In the past the Twelfth has been a major venue for discussion of political issues. A church service will also be held and sometimes band prizes will be awarded.Bryan, Dominic. Orange Parades: The politics of ritual, tradition and control. Pluto Press, 2000. p.147-148 Within Northern Ireland, each District Lodge usually organises its own parade. In rural districts the parade will rotate around various towns, sometimes favouring those in which there is less likely to be trouble, but in other years choosing those in which it is felt the 'right to march' needs to be defended. Orangemen in full regalia on 12 July 2011 in Belfast In Northern Ireland, there is a long tradition of Protestant and loyalist marching bands, which can be found in most towns. The Orangemen hire these bands to march with them on the Twelfth. An instrument almost unique to these marches is the Lambeg drum. Popular songs include \\"The Sash\\" and \\"Derry's Walls\\". Explicitly violent songs such as \\"Billy Boys\\" may also be played. The vast majority of marchers are men, but there are some all-women bands and a few mixed bands. Some all-male bands have female flag or banner carriers. There are also some Women's Orange Lodges which take part in the parades. Orangewomen have paraded on the Twelfth in some rural areas since at least the mid-20th century, but were banned from the Belfast parades until the 1990s. Orangemen on parade typically wear a dark suit, an Orange sash, white gloves and a bowler hat. Certain Orangemen carry a ceremonial sword. In hot weather, many lodges will parade in short-sleeved shirts. Orangewomen have not developed a standard dress code, but usually dress formally. The supporting bands each have their own uniforms and colours. Both the Orangemen and bands carry elaborate banners depicting Orange heroes, historic or Biblical scenes, and/or political symbols and slogans. The most popular image is that of King William of Orange crossing the River Boyne during the famous battle there.Bryan, p.99 At the field, some lodges and bands don humorous outfits or accessories and make the return journey in them, and the mood is generally more mellow, although in times of tension it can also be more aggressive. The Northern Irish and County Donegal parades are given extensive local TV and press coverage, while the BBC Northern Ireland programme The Twelfth is the longest running outside broadcast programme in Northern Ireland. One of the largest Orange demonstrations held anywhere each year is the annual parade held at Rossnowlagh, a tiny village near Ballyshannon in the south of County Donegal in the west of Ulster. County Donegal being one of the Ulster counties in the Republic of Ireland, the Rossnowlagh demonstration is the only major Orange event in the Republic. A number of much smaller Orange events take place each year in East Donegal as well. Controversies and violence In Northern Ireland, where around half the population is from an Irish Catholic background, The Twelfth is a tense time. Orange marches through Irish Catholic and Irish nationalist neighbourhoods are usually met with opposition from residents, and this sometimes leads to violence. Many people see these marches as sectarian, triumphalist, supremacist, and an assertion of British and Ulster Protestant dominance. The political aspectsTonge, Johnathan. Northern Ireland.

Orangemen clashed with Catholic Ribbonmen, leaving a number of Ribbonmen and other Catholics dead. This became known as the \\"Battle of Dolly's Brae\\". As a result of the clashes, the Party Processions Act was renewed the following year. * Following the 1857 Twelfth marches in Belfast, sectarian rioting erupted in the city and lasted for ten days.\\"Chronology of Key Events in Irish History, 1800 to 1967\\".

Stone-throwing had broken out when the Orangemen tried to march past the Catholic chapel. Outnumbered, some of the Orangemen opened fire on the Catholics and retreated. This led to the passing of the Party Emblems Act in August that year, which forbade the carrying of weapons and the wearing of party colours in procession. *The Orange riots occurred two years in a row during Twelfth marches in New York City. In 1870, eight people died in the clashes. In 1871, over 60 civilians (mostly Irish Catholics) and three Guardsmen lost their lives and over 150 were wounded. *Throughout the summer of 1886, there were a string of riots in Belfast. Violence was particularly fierce during and after the Twelfth. By September, an estimated 31 people had been killed. *In 1935 the Twelfth led to the worst violence in Belfast since the foundation of Northern Ireland in 1922. The violence allegedly began when Orangemen tried to enter the Catholic enclave of Lancaster Street. Nine people were killed and 514 Catholic families, comprising 2,241 people, were forced to flee their homes. During the Troubles (late 1960s to late 1990s), the Twelfth was often accompanied by riots and paramilitary violence. In 1972, three people were shot dead on the Twelfth in Portadown and two people were killed in Belfast. Of the five in total, two were killed by Republican groups and three were killed by Loyalist groups.Sutton's Index of Deaths: 12 July 1972. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) On the Twelfth in 1998, during the Drumcree conflict, three young boys were killed when loyalists firebombed their house in Ballymoney. The boys' mother was a Catholic, and their home was in a mainly Protestant housing estate. The killings provoked widespread anger from both Catholics and Protestants. Since the Troubles began, some bands hired to appear at Twelfth marches have openly shown support for loyalist paramilitary groups, either by carrying paramilitary flags and banners or sporting paramilitary names and emblems.Bryan, Dominic.

When Orangemen marched past the shop that 12 July, some marchers held up five fingers in mockery of the five dead.

The Parades Commission was set up in 1998 to deal with contentious parades. During the Troubles some Irish Catholic and nationalist areas organised festivals to keep their children away from the parades, where they might come into conflict with Protestant children, and to make the Twelfth more enjoyable for their communities. The Twelfth outside Ulster Orangemen parading in Larkhall, Scotland (July 2008) Although mostly an Ulster event, the Twelfth is also celebrated in other countries with strong links to Ulster or a history of settlement by Irish Protestants. Outside of Northern Ireland, there are commemorations of The Twelfth in Scotland ‚Äì particularly in and around Glasgow, where most Irish immigrants settled. In England and Wales, Orange marches aren't common and Orange Order membership is found primarily in the Merseyside region, although numbers are still small.Northern Ireland: Conflict and Change, Jonathan Tonge. Pearson. p. 102. Marches here tend to be held a week or so before the Twelfth, due to the number of bands and lodges who travel to Northern Ireland to march there. The Liverpool lodges parade both in the city and in the seaside resort of Southport on 12 July. There are also Twelfth marches in Canada and Australia. As the longest consecutively held parade in North America (first held in 1821), the Twelfth March was the largest parade in Toronto when thousands of Orangemen would march in front of tens of thousands of spectators, until the 1970s. At the time, the Orange Order held such sway that membership in the Order was an unspoken prerequisite for holding civic office. However, the march's popularity has drastically diminished in recent years, as only about 500 people participate in modern Orange parades. Orangemen's Day is still a significant holiday in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, where it is an official provincial paid holiday.Government holidays for 2012. Newfoundland & Labrador Public Services Secretariat An increase in membership in recent years has seen a revival of the Order in Australia and an annual Twelfth of July parade is currently held in Adelaide. Parades were also formerly held in New Zealand on the Twelfth.Ruth Dudley Edwards, The Faithful Tribe: An Intimate Portrait of the Loyal Institutions, London, 2000, p. 136 Until the Partition of Ireland in the early 1920s, the Twelfth was celebrated by Protestants in many parts of Ireland. However, the reduction of Protestant political influence in what is now the Republic of Ireland has meant the only remaining major annual parade within the Republic is at Rossnowlagh, County Donegal, in the west of Ulster, which was held on the Twelfth until the 1970s, when it was moved to the weekend before.√ì Cu√≠v grants ‚Ç¨250,000 to promote Orange Order Irish Times, 5 February 2008 In the rest of Ireland, outside of the nine-county Province of Ulster, there are no major Orange events.

Jamie's mother, Carol, came to Weatherfield and stayed with Jamie and Frankie, who had thrown Danny out because of his affair with Leanne. He supported her during her attempts to give up drinking, but she tried to destroy his relationship with Frankie, unsuccessfully. He later failed in a rebound romance with Joanne Jackson, as his mother's continuing problems, which dominated his life. After Carol schemed to break the bond between Jamie and Frankie by insinuating that they fancied each other, they decided to kick her out and Jamie disowned her. Jamie began dating Violet Wilson, following her split from Jason Grimshaw, who had had an affair with Sarah Platt.

But I've always wanted to be an actor. And part of what attracted me to the profession was the diversity of roles you can get. In the end I accepted that I was going to have to take a pay cut and face up to the possibility that I might never work again. It didn't matter, though. I had to take a risk and leave Corrie in 2007 because I didn't want to play Jamie Baldwin for the next 25 years.\\"Rupert Hill: 'Leaving Corrie was a risk' - Coronation Street News - Soaps - Digital Spy =Return= In March 2011, the show bosses announced that Hill, along with former co star Jenny Platt, would return for one episode set in London in which Sean Tully, played by Antony Cotton, would go to visit them.

Held on July 18, 1955, it was a meeting of \\"The Big Four\\": President Dwight D. Eisenhower of the United States, Prime Minister Anthony Eden of Britain, Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin of the Soviet Union, and Prime Minister Edgar Faure of France.Reston, James. Big Four Conference Opens Today; West‚Äôs Chiefs Complete Strategy on Germany, Disarming, Security, New York Times, July 18, 1955, pg.1; ProQuest Historical Newspapers. They were accompanied by the foreign ministers of the four powers (who were also members of the Council of Foreign Ministers): John Foster Dulles, Harold Macmillan, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Antoine Pinay. Also in attendance was Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union. The purpose was to bring together world leaders to begin discussions on peace. Although those discussions led down many different roads (arms negotiations, trade barriers, diplomacy, nuclear warfare, etc.), the talks were influenced by the common goal for increased global security.  Mission  The stated mission of the 1955 summit was to reduce international tensions. The Geneva Summit was seen as an extremely important building block to better friendships and more open communication between the leaders of \\"The Big Four\\".Staff, ABC News The creation of an international community was introduced as a way to help relieve global tensions and mistrust. This community would form the critical foundation of a unified world in which minimal barriers to trade and common interests would serve to engender diplomacy.Hans J. Morgenthau, p. 559 This Summit paved the way for further discussion regarding international relations and cooperation, proceeding other significant Summits such as SALT I and the Washington Summit of 1973. Topics such as East-West trade agreements, tariffs, the arms race, international security and disarmament policy were all addressed to some extent. The most significant proposal made by President Eisenhower was his \\"Open Skies\\" plan, which called for an international aerial monitoring system.Gunter Bischof, 215. The intent of this policy was to prevent nations from stockpiling dangerous weapons, and eventually lead to the disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. Surprisingly, one goal that American political advisers had for the conference was to not make any specific promises or guarantees to the Soviets. In the past, Soviet leaders have misinterpreted American suggestions as whole-hearted promises later on, which could serve to bring more division instead of unity. Since this meeting was the first of its kind, the seeds of unification needed to be planted, nothing else.Jack F. Matlock, Jr., pp. 9,149 The issue of East-West trade agreements was one that needed to be discussed very delicately.Bischof, Cold War Respite, p. 239 All previous East-West trade agreement talks had been anything but diplomatic. In the past, trade agreements had always been an occasion for discourse and heated arguments. Neither the UK nor the U.S. was willing to share control of their trading spheres unless there were obvious strategic advantages of doing so. Nations were at a standstill because no one was willing to compromise for the good of the worldwide community. The problem with peace talks is that although each nation knows the importance and benefits of peace, there is never enough mutual trust to ensure the success of such talks.Bischof, Cold War Respite, p. 3 The talks in Geneva helped break the ice and introduce nations to the benefits of global free trade. Also, simply by meeting and talking, the leaders were able to develop relationships and have an optimistic outlook on a peaceful and cooperative future.  Cold War and Geneva  The Cold War had a major impact on the topics debated during the Geneva Summit. International tensions were at its peak during the Cold War, as tensions were on the rise, the Cold War leaders thought it would be a good idea to unite under a common cause for peace in Geneva.An Outline of American History: Cold War Aims, [15 February 2007]. The world leaders discussed issues on security, armaments, German unification, and stronger East-West relationships. Khrushchev was willing to allow a united Germany providing it was neutral, but West German entrance into NATO in May made the situation increasingly complicated. Khrushchev wanted the removal of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact, to be replaced by a new system of collective security. According to the memoirs of Andrey Gromyko, a statement was made by the Soviet delegation that if peace was NATO's only objective, there could be no objection for the Soviet Union to join NATO. It was Allan Dulles who advised Dwight Eisenhower to refuse this proposal and the subject was neglected during the rest of the summit. This conference marked an era of renewed optimism in cold war relationships, however this was disrupted later by the Suez Crisis.

He lived for many years at the artists' colony at Cranbrook in Kent. Life In Sickness and Health (1843; Victoria and Albert Museum, London) Webster was born in Ranelagh Street, Pimlico, London. His father was a member of the household of George III, and the son, having shown an aptitude for music, became a chorister, first at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, and then the Chapel Royal at St. James's Palace in London. He abandoned music for painting, however, and in 1821 was admitted as a student at the Royal Academy, exhibiting, in 1824, a portrait of \\"Mr Robinson and Family\\". In the following year he won first prize in the school of painting. In 1825, also, Webster exhibited Rebels shooting a Prisoner, at the Suffolk Street Gallery - the first of a series of pictures of schoolboy life for which he subsequently became known. In 1828 he exhibited The Gunpowder Plot' at the Royal Academy, and in 1829 The Prisoner and A Foraging Party Aroused at the British Institution. These were followed by numerous other pictures of school and village life at both galleries. In 1840 Webster was elected an associate of the Royal Academy (ARA), and in 1846 a Royal Academician (RA). He continued to be a frequent exhibitor there until 1876, when he retired from the academy. He exhibited a self-portrait in 1878, and Released from School, his last picture, in 1879. In 1856 Webster was photographed at the Photographic Institute in London by Robert Howlett, as part of a series of portraits of artists. The picture was among a group exhibited at the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester in 1857. Thomas Webster biography (\\"Leighton Fine Art). From 1835 to 1856 Webster lived at The Mall, Kensington, but the last thirty years of his life were spent at the artists' colony in Cranbrook, Kent, where he died on 23 Sept. 1886. Work The Village Choir (c. 1847; Victoria and Albert Museum, London) Webster became known for his genre paintings, often with children as subjects, depicting incidents from everyday life in a genial and humorous way. Many of these were exceedingly popular, particularly his Punch (1840) with which he procured associate membership of the Royal Academy. In the limited range of subjects which he made his own, Webster was unrivalled. Some of his pictures - such as Please remember the Grotto, Snowballing and maybe The Swing - were issued as prints by Abraham Le Blond. The Smile (1841), The Frown and The Boy with Many Friends, are among the numerous pictures which became well known by engravings. He also contributed work to volumes issued by the London-based Etching Club: The Deserted Village (1841), Songs of Shakespeare (1843), and Etch'd Thoughts (1844). Webster was influential on the work of fellow Cranbrook artists George Bernard O'Neill and Frederick Daniel Hardy.

It is Lebanon's most important farming region. Industry also flourishes in Beqaa, especially that related to agriculture. The Beqaa is located about east of Beirut. The valley is situated between Mount Lebanon to the west and the Anti-Lebanon mountains to the east. It forms the northeasternmost extension of the Great Rift Valley, which stretches from Syria to the Red Sea. Beqaa Valley is long and wide on average. It has a Mediterranean climate of wet, often snowy winters and dry, warm summers. The region receives limited rainfall, particularly in the north, because Mount Lebanon creates a rain shadow that blocks precipitation coming from the sea. The northern section has an average annual rainfall of , compared to in the central valley. Two rivers originate in the valley: the Orontes (Asi), which flows north into Syria and Turkey, and the Litani, which flows south and then west to the Mediterranean Sea. From the 1st century BC, when the region was part of the Roman Empire, the Beqaa Valley served as a source of grain for the Roman provinces of the Levant. Today the valley makes up 40 percent of Lebanon's arable land. The northern end of the valley, with its scarce rainfall and less fertile soils, is used primarily as grazing land by pastoral nomads. Farther south, more fertile soils support crops of wheat, maize, cotton, and vegetables, with vineyards and orchards centered on Zahl√©. The valley also produces hashish and cultivates opium poppies, which are exported as part of the illegal drug trade. Since 1957 the Litani hydroelectricity project, a series of canals and a dam located at Lake Qaraoun at the southern end of the valley, has improved irrigation to farms in Beqaa Valley. Districts and towns Zahl√©, the capital of the Beqaa Valley Zahl√© is the largest city and the administrative capital of the Beqaa Governorate. It lies just north of the main Beirut‚ÄìDamascus highway, which bisects the valley. The majority of Zahl√©'s residents are Lebanese Christian, the majority being Melkite Greek Catholic, Maronite Catholic, and Greek Orthodox Christians. The town of Anjar, situated in the eastern part of the valley, has a predominantly Armenian Lebanese population and is also famous for its 8th-century Arab ruins. The majority of the inhabitants of the northern districts of Beqaa, Baalbek and Hermel, are Lebanese Shia, with the exception of the town of Deir el Ahmar, whose inhabitants are Christians. The Baalbek and Hermel districts have a Christian and Sunni minority, mainly situated further north along the border with Syria. The western and southern districts of the valley also have a mixed population of Muslims, Christians and also Druze. The town of Joub Janine with a population of about 12,000, is situated midway in the valley, and its population is Sunni. Joub Janine is the governmental center of the region known as Western Beqaa, with municipal services like the serail, which is the main government building in the area, emergency medical services (Red Cross), a fire department, and a courthouse. Other towns in the Western Beqaa district are Machghara, Sabghine, Kamed al Lawz, Qab Elias, Sohmor, Yohmor. The towns are all a mix of different Lebanese religious confessions. Rachaiya al Wadi, east of the Western Beqaa district, is home to Lebanon's share of Mount Hermon and borders Syria also. The district's capital, also Rachaiya al Wadi (as not to confuse with Rachaiya al Foukhar in South Lebanon), is famous for its old renovated souk and what is known as the castle of independence in which Lebanon's pre-independence leaders were held by French troops before being released in 1943. The southern section of the district is inhabited with Druze and Christian Lebanese, while the other northern section is mainly inhabited by Sunni Lebanese. Due to wars and the unstable economic and political conditions Lebanon faced in the past, with difficulties some farmers still face today, many previous inhabitants of the valley left for coastal cities in Lebanon or emigrated from the country altogether, with the majority residing in the Americas or Australia. Landmarks Temple of Bacchus in BaalbekThe ancient Roman ruins of Baalbek, an ancient city named for the Canaanite god Baal. The Romans renamed Baalbek \\"Heliopolis\\" and built an impressive temple complex, including temples to Bacchus, Jupiter, Venus, and the Sun.

Wine making is a tradition that goes back 6000 years in Lebanon. With an average altitude of 1000 m above sea level, the valley's climate is very suitable to vineyards. Abundant winter rain and much sunshine in the summer helps the grapes ripen easily. There are more than a dozen wineries in the Beqaa Valley, producing over six million bottles a year.Global eye - Spring 2006 - Eye on Lebanon - The Bekaa Valley Beqaa Valley wineries include: * Ch√¢teau Ka * Ch√¢teau Kefraya * Ch√¢teau Khoury * Ch√¢teau Ksara * Ch√¢teau Marsyas * Ch√¢teau Musar * Ch√¢teau Qanafar * Clos Saint Thomas * Domaine de Baal * Domaine des Tourelles *Domaine Wardy * Kroum Kefraya * Massaya Illicit drugs Municipal garden of Qabb Ilyas Drugs have a long tradition in the Beqaa Valley, from the days of the Roman Empire until today cultivators and tribal drug lords working with militias built up a thriving cannabis trade. During the Lebanese Civil War, cannabis cultivation was a major source of income in the Beqaa valley, where most of the country's hashish and opium was produced, a multibillion-dollar industry fueling the agricultural sector as well as political factions and organized crime. The trade collapsed during the worldwide crackdown on narcotics led by the United States in the early 1990s. Under pressure from the U.S. State Department, the occupying Syrian Army plowed up the Beqaa's cannabis fields and sprayed them with poison. Since the mid-1990s, the culture and production of drugs in the Beqaa valley has been in steady decline, by 2002 an estimated 2,500 hectaresCIA - The World Factbook - Lebanon of cannabis were limited to the extreme north of the valley, where government presence remains minimal.

Although important during the civil war, opium cultivation has become marginal, dropping from an estimated 30 metric tonnes per year in 1983 to negligible amounts in 2004.

Klootschieten in Twente. \\"Klootschieten\\" (NL) (\\"Bosseln\\" or \\"Bo√üeln\\" in German; \\"Ball shooting\\" in English) is a sport in the Netherlands and East Frisia, Northern Germany, most popular in the eastern regions of Twente and Achterhoek. The game is ultimately of Frisian origin.V√ÑTH, J., & MATTES, R. ‚ÄòKloot‚Äôshooting in Northern Germany. Sport‚ÄìIntegration‚ÄìEurope, 180. To play, participants throw a ball (the kloot) as far as they can, using a relatively difficult throwing style that requires speed, power, and concentration. The sport has been occasionally banned due to negative associations, but achieved a measure of respectability as its first league was established by Hinrich Dunkhase in 1902.Friesischer Klootschie√üer Verband e.V. ‚Äì Satzung , . The sport is divided into field, street, and standing play. Field and street play typically has two teams playing against each other, while standing play is individual. Stefan Albarus is the current record holder, throwing the ball 106.20 meters.Klootschie√üen ‚Äì Der ewige Feldkampf. .  History  The term Kloot comes from Low German and derives from Kluten, of similar etymology to English words such as \\"clod\\", \\"clout\\", \\"clot\\", \\"cleat\\", \\"clay\\" and \\"cloth\\" ‚Äì all ultimately deriving from Proto-Germanic klautaz, meaning a ball or lump. Klootschieten likely arose from an ancient Frisian weapon, which the Frisians threw at ships and opponents.Klootschie√üen ‚Äì Der ewige Feldkampf. . The Frisian fighters are said to have been feared for their missiles. In further development of this sport, heavy flint balls and two-pound iron balls were used. Later, the fist-sized balls were made of turned Applewood, pierced crosswise with lead-filled holes. The Dutch reformer Jacobus van Oudenhoven took in 1659 the Kloot werpen on a Sunday after the service in his sins register.Jacobus van Oudenhoven: Ingebroken Alblasser-waert, in Zuyd-Hollandt. J.B. Smient, Dordrecht 1659; Vgl. T. Brienen: Jacobus van Oudenhoven (1600‚Äì1690). In: T. Brienen u. a. (Hrsg.): Figuren en thema's van de Nadere Reformatie. De Groot Goudriaan, Kampen 1987, S. 43‚Äì51. In the past, Kloot shooting had negative associations. Competitions often involved gambling for money or other valuables, heavy alcohol consumption, and disorderly conduct. It was even argued to get bloody at times. Since the sport was practiced in winter, the light sportswear was considered a risk factor for deaths from pneumonia. Accordingly, the sport was occasionally banned by the authorities, but ultimately klootschieten always prevailed. Hinrich Dunkhase (1857‚Äì1905), in Burhave, Butjadingen, merged the Oldenburg and East Frisian klootschieten groups to form the Friesischer Klootschie√üer-Verband (\\"Friesian klootschieten Association\\", FKV) on May 25, 1902. Friesischer Klootschie√üer Verband e.V. ‚Äì Satzung , . This was the first competitive league developed for the sport. Dunkhase was its chairman until his death. In the National Socialist period, the FKV resisted integration into the (NS) Reichsbund for physical exercises by not reporting to the sports organizations, instead wanting klootschieten to be known as a traditional German and Friesan game. The FKV joined the Nazi cultural community and was able to retain a certain degree of independence. In particular, Low German or Frisian could be spoken at the competition, which was prohibited in a sport. After the Second World War, the FKV oriented again and became a member of the National Sports Association Lower Saxony a sport.Arnd Kr√ºger: Incorporating traditional games into modern sports.

Today, NKB (Nederlandse Klottschietbond) is today the umbrella organization of more than 40,000 players of Klootschieter and the related game of \\"Bo√üeln\\" (Bosseln). The sport is also represented by sports confederations of the regions North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein. In the Netherlands, there is the Dutch Klootschieters Bond (NKB, founded in 1967) and in Ireland, the Irish Road Bowling Association (Irish: B√≥l Chumann na h√âireann, founded in 1954). International umbrella organization is the International Bowlplaying Association (IBA, founded in 1969). Competitions also take place among Irish immigrants in the US and Canada as it is part of traditional Irish folk culture. European championships (as road bowling) have been held since 1969 (every four years since 1980) between the Netherlands, Ireland and Germany in the three disciplines of field, street and standing competition. Styles There are three styles: field, street, and standing (veld, straat, and zetten). =Field= In the field (veld) version of klootschieten, it is the intention, alone or in a team, to reach a particular patch of grass and/or sand in as few throws as possible (similar in this respect to golf). The course contains curves and variations of height (small hills and valleys and such), so that skill as well as strength is an important factor. The field kloot is a round ball of wood or synthetic material, made heavier with lead. The diameter of the kloot is mostly between 7 and 8 centimetres, but these can deviate according to the preference of the participants. There is a minimum diameter of 5 centimetres. =Street= A road in Germany with distance markings for In the street (straat) version of klootschieten, the rules are approximately the same as in the field version, except that the course (being a street, country lane or similar) and the ball (being heavier) are different. An important consideration in the street version is to keep the ball away from obstacles such as ditches, gutters, streams, long grass etc., which would reduce the distance of ones \\"shoot\\". The experienced player will sometimes deliberately aim for such places on uphill stretches, to avoid the possibility of the ball rolling back downhill. =Standing= The goal in the standing or setting (zetten) style is to see how far the ball can travel in the air (similar in this respect to the hammer throw and shotput). Thus the measure of the throw ends at the point where the ball hits the ground (in contrast to the field and street variants).  Similar sports  In Germany a sport similar to field style klootschieten is played, named \\"Bo√üeln\\" (Bosseln), while Klootschie√üen is the German name for the standing style. It is primarily played along the coast and borders of North Germany, such as in Ostfriesland, Oldenburg, Butjadingen, Dithmarschen, Nordfriesland, Emsland, and Grafschaft Bentheim. It is also played in some parts of the United States by German and Dutch immigrants. In Ireland, a similar game is played under the name road bowling. =European championship= In May 2004, the European Championship was held in Westerstede, Germany. At the adult level, the German FKB (Friesischer Klootschie√üer Connection) won all competitions. The individual winners: * Catriona O'Farrell (women's, veld) * Rena Ahlrichs (women's, straat) * Ute Uhrbrook (women's, zetten) * Dirk Taddigs (men's, veld) * Henning Feyen (men's, straat) * Stefan Albarus (men's, zetten) In May 2008, the European Championships was held near Cork, Ireland.  Records  For the first time in 1935, the kloot was thrown over the 100-meter mark by Ostfriesen Gerd Gerdes. This record lasted until 1985, when Auricher Harm Henkel threw 102.00 meters. This new record was beaten the same day by the \\"Bear of Ellens\\" Hans-Georg Bohlken with 105.20 meters. The current (as of January 2006) record is 106.20 meters, held by Stefan Albarus from the north in East Frisia.Klootschie√üen ‚Äì Der ewige Feldkampf. .

He was a Rear Admiral in the British Navy. Life He was named for an uncle, Thomas Tudor Tucker, who served as Treasurer of the United States. The third of the eight sons (all in the public service) of Henry Tucker, secretary of the council of the Bermudas, he was born on 29 June 1775; Henry St George Tucker was his eldest brother. After two voyages in the service of the East India Company, Tucker entered the Royal Navy in 1793 as master's mate of , with Captain William Clark, whom he followed to , and , in which he was present at the reduction of the Cape of Good Hope. On 21 March 1796 he was appointed acting lieutenant of on the East India station, in which and afterwards in the sloop , again in Victorious and in , he served as acting lieutenant for nearly four years. On her way homewards Sceptre was lost in Table Bay, on 5 November 1799. Many of her crew perished, and Tucker was left to find his own passage to England. On arriving in London Tucker learned that the Admiralty refused to confirm his irregular promotion, and, after passing a second examination, he was made a lieutenant on 20 May 1800, into , in which, and then in , he served in the Channel fleet till the Peace of Amiens. In June 1803 he was appointed to , carrying the flag of Rear-admiral Alexander Cochrane, at first off Ferrol, and later on in the West Indies, where, on 6 February 1806, he was present in the Battle of St. Domingo. He was then appointed by the admiral acting commander of HMS Dolphin, and, in succession, of several other ships; but his rank was not confirmed till 15 February 1808. In April he was moved into . In it, and then in , he captured enemy vessels protected by shore batteries. In February 1810 Tucker assisted in the reduction of Guadeloupe. On the special recommendation of the commander-in- chief, Sir Francis Laforey promoted him to post rank on 1 August 1811. Remaining in Cherub, he sailed to England in September 1812, in charge of a large convoy.

Crumbsuckers amalgamated thrash and hardcore punk sounds and themes, making an immediate impact on the wider scene with their 1986 debut album, Life of Dreams. Though the band was supported by its fanbase and fellow artists, Crumbsuckers' second album, Beast on My Back, failed to deliver on expectations, despite the musicianship displayed on the recording. The departure of lead vocalist Chris Notaro in 1988 started the band's gradual decline, despite the Crumbsuckers attempts to create a new identity. Even so, the band had already firmly cemented themselves as pioneers of the crossover thrash movement. Crumbsuckers played its latest reunion show (with Chris Notaro on vocals) at the 2015 Black N' Blue Bowl Festival at Webster Hall (formerly the Ritz) in New York City on May 17, 2015. History In June 1983, the band recorded a five-song demo unofficially called The Crumbsucker Cave (the name given to the place where Crumbsuckers used to rehearse) at Nino Studio in Baldwin, which included a cover of Chubby Checker's \\"The Twist\\". It was with this demo that the band landed their first CBGBs showcase, and subsequent 'Hardcore' matinees. At that time, the line up consisted of Dave Brady - vocals, Dave Wynn - guitar, Gary Meskil - bass and Kevin 'Toast' Carroll - drums. From the time of their first matinee performance, they prided themselves on playing all original music, with the occasional homage to such tracks as Black Sabbath's \\"Sweet Leaf\\" and the theme from Inspector Gadget. Early in 1985, looking for a sharper edge, they added a second guitarist; fellow Baldwin resident Chuck Lenihan, and replaced Carroll with a local 16-year-old drummer, Dan Richardson. Lenihan's metal-influenced guitar solos contrasted beautifully with Wynn's blues-based offerings. Both Crumbsuckers' lyrics and musical direction naturally took a notable turn towards a more metal edge, with songs such as \\"Life of Dreams\\" and \\"Return to the Womb\\" written around this time. Following Brady's departure, they needed to recruit a new singer and soon found one from another local hardcore band, Krakdown; Chris Notaro. Whilst opinions may vary, the \\"classic\\" line-up was now complete, and so they set about recording and releasing their first album. Life of Dreams (1986) The album cover for Life of Dreams The band recorded their debut album Life of Dreams at Systems Two Studios in Brooklyn, New York, in 1985, which was released through Combat Records the following year. Produced by Norman Dunn, the album contained 16 tracks clocking in at less than 33 minutes. Life of Dreams delivered a collection of 158 punk/metal-style riffs, with metal-style and blues-style guitar solos, laced with frequent time changes and all topped off with Chris Notaro's gravel-style vocals. The closing track, \\"Moment Of Silence/Mr Hyde\\" demonstrated their ability to tone down the intensity of the previous tracks during a passage of clean and melodic acoustic guitars, before launching back into a frenzy of fuzz and aural aggression to round off the album. Life of Dreams was greeted with very mixed reviews in the music press. The album's cover artwork was designed and painted by Sean Taggart, a local New York artist who had provided gig flyers for NYHC bands, as well as providing album covers such as Agnostic Front's Cause for Alarm, Carnivore's Carnivore and Retaliation, Prong's Primitive Origins and Whiplash's Power and Pain. He later went on to provide album covers (and eventually, defining cartoon characters) for the Jerky Boys. Crumbsuckers recorded videos for three tracks from Life of Dreams 'live' at CBGBs in 1986, with only one track, \\"Trapped\\", being commercially released. (The other two tracks, \\"Bullshit Society\\" and \\"Return to the Womb\\", disappeared for many years but have since surfaced on YouTube.) \\"Trapped\\" originally featured as the opening song on an underground video compilation of English and North American punk bands called Hardcore, released by Jettisoundz in 1986. The track is now widely available to view on YouTube. Beast On My Back (1988) In the spring of 1987, guitarist Dave Wynn left the band and, after a few guitarists came and went, Robbie Koebler stepped in to help record their sophomore album Beast On My Back (the acronym B.O.M.B. being assigned to this release). The album opens with a passage of slightly dark, melancholic piano, played by Lenihan's cousin, Mike Francis. The piece had originally been written on guitar (and performed later as such in the live arena), but offered an immediate surprise to those listeners who had become familiar with Life of Dreams, and certainly differed from other metal/crossover albums of the era. The guitar-driven instrumental tracks \\"Rejuvenate\\" and \\"Initial Shock\\" were penned by Matt Cardin, a fellow Baldwin native and guitarist, although no credit was actually given on the record sleeve. (Cardin had also contributed ideas to a few tracks that found their way on Life of Dreams.) The band was nominated as the \\"Best Hardcore Rock Band\\" in the 1988 New York Music Awards.Duffy, Thom. \\"DEMON GUITAR HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL TO JOE SATRIANI'S SUCCESS\\" - Orlando Sentinel, May 22, 1988 By now, Crumbsuckers were rubbing shoulders with some of their musical peers, including high-profile bands such as Anthrax, Megadeth and Metallica. The shoulder-rubbing also extended to lesser commercially successful artists, such as Agnostic Front, Bad Brains, Cro-Mags and Carnivore. It was during this period that Marc Piovanetti (from Carnivore) joined Crumbsuckers as a full-time guitarist, following the long- standing vacancy left open since the departure of Dave Wynn (and the subsequent entourage of stand-ins). Following a successful US tour to promote Beast On My Back in 1988, playing with such bands as Sacred Reich and Pantera, Notaro decided this was not for him, citing 'musical differences'. At that point, the band were already contracted to fulfill a winter tour in Europe (with Onslaught as headliners) in late 1988, but Notaro's replacement for those shows, Joe Haggerty, failed to deliver the vocal performances which had become a trademark of their overall sound. Heavy Rain Within a few weeks of returning home from their European Tour, Haggerty was fired and replaced with a local singer, Craig Allen. New material was written and tightly rehearsed, with a new sound emerging, leading to the band dropping the name Crumbsuckers in favor of a new identity as Heavy Rain. Heavy Rain rehearsing in May 1989 Heavy Rain offered a more radio-friendly rock sound, with vocals more akin to Queensr√øche's Geoff Tate. Whilst they retained small doses of Crumbsuckers' audacious/ridiculous guitar solos, most songs were recorded and presented in a much more straight, hard rock feel. Despite the quality of their new material or their formidable heritage, these new songs failed to attract any interest or support from record companies who had been approached. Much time and effort was spent recording a considerable number of professional studio demos between 1989 and 1990, although nothing was ever officially released. Heavy Rain kept on writing and rehearsing, playing the odd showcase from time to time but, even though they eventually replaced Allen with a new, much stronger singer, things just simply failed to come together them. Heavy Rain disbanded in late 1990. A combination of contractual arguments and disagreements as to which direction the band should take, coupled with the poor response from potential record company interest led to the project's collapse. Pro-Pain From the ashes of Heavy Rain (and Crumbsuckers), Lenihan began jamming with former (Stormtroopers of Death and M.O.D.) vocalist Billy Milano, under a new project called Rawhead. Meskil and Richardson came on board but, over a period of months, a revolving door of guitarists ensued. Lenihan was dismissed and replaced by another Baldwin guitarist, Al Zaleski. He was later replaced by a third Baldwin fret-wizard, Tom Klimchuck, who would eventually take a sabbatical from the band. In the late summer of 1991, Meskil came up with a new name for the band, Pro-Pain and the band gathered at Pyramid Sound Studios, Ithaca, New York to record their debut album, Foul Taste of Freedom. However, further line-up changes took place here, with Milano being sent home (as Meskil decided to take over the vocal duties himself), whilst Lenihan was briefly drafted back in to play lead guitar, only to be ejected for a second time shortly afterwards. A new guitarist, Mike Mays, eventually ended up playing lead guitar on the album tracks. With Klimchuck all the while considered the official Pro-Pain guitarist, but still unfortunately unavailable to tour at that time, the baton was then passed to another new guitarist, Nick St Denis, who finally helped bring a measure of stability to the line up, certainly for the next few years. Pro-Pain released three albums between 1992 and 1996, touring extensively in Europe and the US, but the departure of founding drummer Dan Richardson in 1996 left Meskil as the only original 'Crumbsucker' in the band. From there, Pro-Pain added a second guitarist. Meskil's remarkable and commendable commitment to keeping Pro-Pain alive and kicking for over 20 plus years, mostly self-financed, (thus avoiding record company interference), has been in keeping with the original Crumbsuckers ethos and vibe. Pro-Pain never lost sight of their roots, something they favorably demonstrated when they recorded a cover version of \\"Just Sit There\\" on their 2003 covers album, Run For Cover. In 2006, long-time Pro-Pain guitarist, Tom Klimchuck, had the honor of playing on stage with Crumbsuckers at their Reunion Show at BB Kings, playing in tandem with original lead guitarist, Chuck Lenihan. In 2015, current Pro-Pain guitarist, Adam Philips, joined Crumbsuckers on stage in the same capacity as Klimchuck did in 2006. Reunions In the summer of 1990, Meskil (inspired by a visit from a devoted English fan, Alex Meissner), put together a Crumbsuckers reunion show with Chris Notaro, being that Meissner had felt somewhat 'cheated' seeing Crumbsuckers in the UK in 1988 without Notaro. Crumbsuckers' first reunion show was held at the Sundance Club in Bayshore, Long Island, on 24 August 1990, with Chris Notaro returning to vocal duties for the first time since his departure in 1988 and featured the same line-up from the tour of that year; Lenihan, Meskil, Notaro, Piovanetti and Richardson. The venue was sold out. Crumbsuckers, New York City, August 2006 Sixteen years passed until Crumbsuckers reunited once again on 3 August 2006 at B.B.Kings in New York City, to commemorate 20 years since the release of their debut album Life of Dreams. Once again, it was Alex Meissner who helped initiate the reunion, having rebuilt broken bridges between some of the original band members. The packed out venue witnessed an appearance by original members Dave Wynn and Dave Brady on the classic track \\"Hub Run\\". Around 2000 fans gathered that evening to celebrate the anniversary, including a significant number of old friends of Crumbsuckers from the early days (many of whom had driven or flown considerable distances to attend the show). Everyone considered the evening to be the equivalent to a 'big old class reunion', with Dream Theater's (then) drummer Mike Portnoy making particular reference to the evening on his personal website. On December 24, 2014, it was announced that the band would reunite one more time, to play the Black N' Blue Bowl (in New York) in May 2015. The line up of: Chris Notaro - vocals, Gary Meskil - bass, Chuck Lenihan - guitar, Adam Phillips - guitar and Dan Richardson - drums successfully took to the stage on May 17, 2015. Style Their combined styles, with * Meskil's roots in the British punk scene via Discharge and G.B.H., * the West Coast hardcore scene Dead Kennedys and Black Flag, * Wynn's classic, blues-based, hard rock styles, * and Lenihan's furious fingerwork and Van Halen-inspired guitar solos earned them respect among the CBGBs matinee crowd. In 1985, they recorded a second demo at CBGBs, with a new five-piece line up, featuring a very young but talented drummer (Dan Richardson) and began searching for a record deal. It was during this time that long-time vocalist Dave Brady left the band. Notaro, known for his gruff vocals and high-energy stage antics, was a founding member of the Long Island band Krakdown, contemporaries of the already well-established Crumbsuckers. Getting Notaro on board was a natural fit and very much in keeping with the Long Island vibe. Crumbsuckers' musical style has been afforded many titles, including Hardcore, Speedcore, Thrash (which extends to Thrash/Punk and Thrash/Metal), Crossover and Speed Metal. Along with local comrades such as Agnostic Front, Bad Brains and Cro-Mags offering similar contributions on the East Coast, and bands such as DRI, Excel (band) and Suicidal Tendencies reflecting a similar movement over on the West Coast, Crumbsuckers were certainly at the forefront of this new hardcore punk/thrash/metal crossover movement. Other information The band's name was allegedly conceived following an incident in the canteen at Baldwin High School, where Gary Meskil observed a fellow student sucking the crumbs off his plate; \\"'Hey! Look at that crumbsucker!'\\" Meskil supposedly exclaimed and, from there, the name Crumbsuckers was born. Crumbsuckers were one of the first bands to mix the two genres of hardcore punk ethos and heavy metal pathos, as evidenced on their debut album Life Of Dreams. The songs were written by Gary Meskil, Dave Wynn, Chuck Lenihan and Dave Brady over the course of their formative years, 1983‚Äì1985. Crumbsuckers' shortest ever officially recorded song was \\"Shot Down\\", clocking in at 55 seconds, but they had an even shorter song called \\"Kids At My School\\" which lasted only 47 seconds. This latter track finally made it to vinyl some 30 years later, on Turn Back Time: The Early Years 1983-1985. Only two songs on Life of Dreams featured lyrics written by new vocalist Chris Notaro (\\"The Longest War\\" and \\"Mr Hyde\\"). The song \\"Charge\\" was originally composed as an instrumental song \\"Charge of the Light Brigade\\" and was erstwhile earmarked for inclusion on Life of Dreams. However, it was later extended, with lyrics added, and eventually found its home on Beast On My Back. Although an all-American band, Crumbsuckers' heritage is mostly derived from European lineages: Germany (Meskil), Great Britain (Richardson), Ireland (Brady & Lenihan) and Italy (Notaro & Piovanetti). While Crumbsuckers were riding high in 1988, they remained great friends with another Long Island band who had yet to fully blossom. That band was called Majesty. Waving a strong demo tape before the bosses at Mechanic Records, Chuck Lenihan campaigned hard to get them to offer Majesty a record deal, which they eventually agreed to in 1988, giving Majesty their first big break. Shortly afterwards, having recorded and released their debut album, Majesty changed their name to Dream Theater. In the late 1980s, Lenihan spent many of his Saturday mornings teaching guitar to young, local aspiring guitarists. With the money he made, he then took guitar lessons himself from Al Pitrelli. Between band rehearsals, drummer Dan Richardson pushed himself by donning a set of headphones and jamming along to albums such as Rush's Power Windows to hone his drumming skills. Furthermore, he often utilized an electronic metronome during band rehearsals to get the band to play with pin- point accuracy. After leaving Pro-Pain, then joining Life of Agony at the height of their success, Dan Richardson later turned down an opportunity to join Nine Inch Nails. He later played drums with Stereomud on their first two albums. Gary Meskil paid a fitting tribute (and respectful nod) to his former band by recording a new version of \\"Just Sit There\\" on the 2003 Pro-Pain album, Run For Cover. Lenihan's trademark white Aria Pro II Flying-V guitar, featured in countless photographs from their live shows during the 1980s, was accidentally left behind at a venue in Paris, France, while Chuck was touring with Genitorturers in 2002. Since that loss, he has adopted a Gibson SG for his live shows. Crumbsuckers' musical family tree has extended in many different directions, including: Darkhaus, Pro-Pain - (Meskil), Life of Agony, Pro-Pain, Stereomud, Medication - (Richardson), Christian Death, Electric Hellfire Club, Genitorturers, Glitter Guns, Vasaria - (Lenihan) and Carnivore [reunion shows], Lava Baby - (Piovanetti).

He is best known for being the first presenter of the BBC Television science programme Tomorrow's World, continuing for 12 years, from 1965 to 1977. He also provided radio commentary at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, the funerals of King George VI, Winston Churchill and Lord Mountbatten of Burma, and the first flight of Concorde.  Early life Baxter was born in Ilford in Essex. His father was a science teacher. He was educated at Ilford County High School, a grammar school for boys, from which he was expelled after being caught smoking. He did not go on to a college or university. Baxter worked for a brief period at the Metropolitan Water Board. Pilot career In August 1940, during World War II, he joined the Royal Air Force and trained as a fighter pilot in Canada. He first flew Supermarine Spitfires with No. 65 Squadron RAF in Britain, based in Scotland. He joined No. 93 Squadron RAF, flying over Sicily in 1943, where he was mentioned in dispatches. He returned to England in 1944 as an instructor and was later a flight commander, returning to active service with No. 602 Squadron RAF in September 1944. On 18 March 1945, Baxter took part in a daylight raid on the Shell-Mex building in The Hague, which was then the German headquarters for V-1 and V-2 rocket attacks on southern England. The commander of the raid, Max Sutherland, received a bar to his DFC and Baxter, along with the three other pilots, was again mentioned in dispatches. In an interview about his wartime career, Baxter described flying over a V-2 site during a launch on 14 February 1945, and his wingman firing on the missile: \\"I dread to think what would have happened if he'd hit the thing!\\" He later flew North American Mustang and Douglas Dakota aircraft for a year, then worked in Forces Broadcasting Service (FBS) from 1945 to 1949, based in Cairo and then Hamburg, becoming its deputy director. He was demobbed in 1946 as a flight lieutenant. BBC career Baxter joined the BBC in 1950. He provided radio commentary on the funerals of King George VI in 1952 and Winston Churchill in 1965, the former commentary given while suspended from the ceiling of Westminster Abbey. He also reported at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, reporting from Trafalgar Square. Baxter was an accomplished rally driver and competed in the Monte Carlo Rally twelve times, six of them as a member of the BMC Works Team. He also competed in numerous Alpine, Tulip and RAC Rallies, which was satirised in the character Roland Thraxter in Peter Ustinov's Grand Prix du Rock. He was a crew member in the New Zealand Air Race in 1953, in a British European Airways Vickers Viscount. Having an authoritative voice, he frequently commentated on motoring and aviation events. He was the BBC's motoring correspondent from 1950 to 1966, including at least twenty Formula One races, the Le Mans 24-hour race, and the Monte Carlo Rally. To parody this, he was invited to appear in an episode of Hancock's Half Hour when Hancock entered the rally, and onto I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue to commentate on sessions of Mornington Crescent. From 1967 to 1968, he was briefly Director of Motoring Publicity for the British Motor Corporation, while still presenting for the BBC. Following BMC's takeover by Leyland Motors, it was decided to dispense with Baxter's services in this post, and he returned to work full-time for the BBC. He presented the BBC's coverage of Farnborough Airshows from 1950 to 1986. He reported on the first flight of Concorde and was the first reporter to broadcast from an aeroplane, ocean liner and underwater. For thirty years, he was the regular commentator at the Royal British Legion's annual Festival of Remembrance at the Albert Hall and at the Royal Tournament. He presented the opening ceremony of the 1960 Summer Olympics, deputising for an indisposed Richard Dimbleby. He presented the science series Eye on Research from 1959 to 1963, and was the first (and initially sole) host of the long-running popular science show Tomorrow's World for 12 years from July 1965, reaching an audience of up to 10 million viewers. He was the presenter of the first live transatlantic broadcast from the US via Telstar in 1962, the first live telecast from Australia in November 1966, and interviewed South African surgeon Christiaan Barnard by telephone in 1967, within hours of the completion of the world's first heart transplant operation. Baxter also undertook commercial commissions. He was the presenter for the launch of Gillette's G2 Razors held at the Heathrow Hotel, London, in 1973. He left the Tomorrow's World programme in 1977, after disagreements with its new editor, Michael Blakstad, who described Baxter as \\"the last of the dinosaurs\\", while Baxter reputedly said he could not work with someone who arrived at the BBC each day on a bicycle. Baxter was invited to present the first Raymond Baxter Award for Science Communication in July 2000. He was surprised to find that he was the first recipient.  Other activities  In 1975 Baxter narrated \\"The Hammond Organ 40th Anniversary Album\\", issued by Ad-Rhythm Records. Baxter also narrated The Story of Rolls-Royce, a 1988 film about the history of the world's most prestigious motor car, made by the Rolls-Royce Enthusiasts' Club.RREC DVD. http://www.rrec.org.uk/shop/category.php?cat=9 He also presented and narrated two fire safety training films in the 1970s; the first for Consort Films, entitled Fire Danger in Hospitals in 1972, about what fires can break out due to carelessness and another, undated, entitled Hospital Evacuation and You. Baxter was made an Honorary Freeman of the City of London in 1978 and awarded the OBE in 2003. He was a member of the Committee of Management of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1979 to 1997, and Vice-President from 1987 to 1997. He became a Life Vice-President in 1997. In 1998 he was the subject of This Is Your Life when he was surprised by Michael Aspel with the help of Stirling Moss, at a Soho recording studio. Baxter was a founder member of the Association of Dunkirk Little Ships ‚Äì he owned one of the small vessels that evacuated British troops from the beaches ‚Äì and its Honorary Admiral from 1982, and Honorary Chairman of the Royal Aeronautical Society from 1991. He was on the Council of the Air League from 1980 to 1985. Personal life He married his American wife, Sylvia Kathryn Johnson, in 1945. They had a son, Graham, and a daughter, Jenny who is a fencing coach. Sylvia died in 1996. Baxter died 15 September 2006 at the age of 84 at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, close to his home in Henley-on-Thames.

It is located in the Huning Highlands neighborhood and is protected by the city as a historic landmark. It is located on the northeast corner of Central and Broadway NE, at the center of an area that has become known as East Downtown or EDo. The campus comprises five buildings, the oldest of which was built in 1914. After the school moved to a new location in 1974, the old buildings were left abandoned for decades before being renovated as loft apartments in the early 21st century. Old Albuquerque High was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1977. Buildings The Old Albuquerque High campus comprises five buildings grouped around a central courtyard. All of the buildings were designed in the Gothic Revival style typical of early 20th-century school architecture. Old Main is the original building, constructed in 1914. It is located on the southeast corner of the campus, facing Central Avenue. The three-story building was designed by Henry C. Trost and originally housed classrooms, a gymnasium, a library, an auditorium, and a science laboratory. The Manual Arts Building was built in 1927 on the east side of campus, facing Arno Street. It has three stories and of floor area, and originally housed a woodshop and machine shop in addition to classrooms. It was designed by local architect George M. Williamson. The Classroom Building (1937), Gymnasium (1938), and Library (1940) were all designed by Louis Hesselden and built with New Deal funding and Works Progress Administration labor. The Gymnasium, which sits at the north end of the campus, is the largest building with of floor area. The Classroom Building and the Library face Broadway on the west side of campus. History Old Main was built in 1914, replacing Albuquerque High's previous location in the Central School building downtown. At the time Albuquerque had only 12,000 residents, and critics complained that the new building was too large and would never reach its capacity of 500 students. This proved not to be the case as a second building was required just 13 years later, and the campus had grown to five buildings by 1940. Albuquerque High remained the only high school in the city until Highland High School opened in 1949. In 1974, Albuquerque High School moved to a new location about one mile (1.6 km) to the north, leaving the old campus vacant. Albuquerque Public Schools eventually sold the buildings, and they were left to deteriorate over the next 25 years as various plans to reuse them fell through and the surrounding neighborhood became increasingly blighted. Redevelopment Efforts to renovate the former high school intensified in 1989 when the Albuquerque City Council authorized funds to purchase the property. In 1996, after years of legal wrangling, the city succeeded in acquiring four of the five campus buildings for $1.5 million. The city eventually settled on a plan to convert the buildings into loft apartments in a joint venture with a private developer, and work began in 2001. The Classroom Building and Old Main were the first to be renovated, followed by the Gymnasium, Library, and finally the separately-owned Manual Arts Building. The renovation preserved many interior details such as doors, handrails, and even blackboards. The gymnasium and library reading room are protected spaces and have also been preserved. The success of the project spurred further revitalization efforts in the surrounding area, leading the city to draft an East Downtown master plan in 2005 to guide future development.

It forms a trilogy with Omega and Davros to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the show. It features the Seventh Doctor as its main character. Synopsis The Seventh Doctor arrives at an old house on the colony world of Perfugium where he has, through a deal with Death, sent the Master to live without memory of his evil for several years. It is eventually revealed that while the Doctor was Time's Champion, the Master was Death's. This was a result of an incident in their youth, when the Doctor accidentally killed a boy who was bullying the young Master. When Death came to him, the young Doctor gave his childhood friend over to Death (personified as a woman) rather than become its slave himself, causing his friend to take on all the guilt and aftereffects for his crime and ultimately become the Master. However, as a result of this, neither the Master nor the Doctor remembered the truth, instead having the false memory of the Master being responsible for the death. The deal the Doctor made involved Death allowing the Master to be what he would have been if he had not become her avatar, but in return the Doctor would have to kill him ten years later. Rendered amnesiac and thinking his name was John Smith, the Master becomes a benevolent doctor on Perfugum. At the end of those years, however, Doctor is unable to bring himself to kill him. This causes Death to become personally involved, unleashing a night of horrors upon the household. The truth of the Master's past is revealed, but \\"John Smith\\" forgives the Doctor for this. However, the end implies that the Master will once again become Death's servant.

However, when his true personality briefly surfaces, he is quite contemptuous of the idea that Death had anything to do with his creation. The Master scoffs at the idea of being Death's Champion, casually tells her to be quiet and generally dismisses her.

The complete range was discovered by the United States Antarctic Service Expedition (1939‚Äì41), during a flyover of the area on 15 December 1940, and named for the Executive Committee of the Expedition. Four of the five mountains are named in honor of individual members of the committee; Mount Sidley, the most imposing mountain in the range and highest volcano in Antarctica, had been discovered and named by Rear Admiral Byrd in 1934, during his privately funded Second Antarctic Expedition. The entire range was mapped in detail, by the United States Geological Survey, using various surveys and U.S. Navy trimetrogon photography performed from 1958 to 1960.

History With the discovery of the \\"Cliff Lode\\" in 1845 and the subsequent copper mining operations there, Eagle River became a booming port city and rivaled Copper Harbor as the biggest boom town in the Keweenaw. On September 28, 1850, the United States Congress appropriated $6,500 to construct a light at Eagle River. A site was selected that year, but it took until 1853 for the Michigan Legislature to obtain title to the site. Construction was not completed until 1857.Terry Pepper, Seeing the Light, Eagle River Light. The light was situated on a sand bluff overlooking Lake Superior on the west bank of the river. The tower was only high, but because of its location on a bluff, the sixth order Fresnel lens could be seen for a distance of ten nautical miles. Cracks at the base of the station were documented in 1867, and the entire structure was said to be in danger of collapsing. Congress appropriated $14,000 in 1869 to build a replacement, but recalled the funds in 1870 due to a shortfall in the federal budget. After copper in the Keweenaw area was commercially exhausted, the copper mining boom collapsed. The principal mine, the Cliff Mine, closed in 1873 and the Eagle River port became idle. Although the harbor quickly fell into disrepair, the light station continued to serve as the only marker of the shore between the Keweenaw Waterway and Eagle Harbor. The station was renovated and partially rebuilt in 1884. By 1892, it was recommended that the light station be decommissioned and a new light be built a few miles to the east at Five Mile Point. In 1893, Congress authorized construction of the Sand Hills Lighthouse, but failed to appropriate any funds to carry out the construction. This situation continued for many years. The Eagle River Light Station was decommissioned in 1908 and its buildings were sold at auction in that year. The replacement light would not be built until 1917 and after at least ten vessels had been lost on the nearby Sawtooth Reef. The Eagle River Lighthouse is in private ownership owned by Edward ‚ÄúBud‚Äù Cole, a historic preservationist with a family lineage in the Keweenaw dating back to the 1850s. Along with the Eagle River Lighthouse, he also owns several other historically significant buildings in Eagle River and over 800 acres of the Eagle River corridor with 2 miles of Eagle River running through the property. Cole is also the owner of the Sandhills Lighthouse purchased in March 2019. The Eagle River Lighthouse is available for rent on Homeaway.

It was first launched on the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Queen Alexandra from her native Denmark to the United Kingdom. The Queen requested that the anniversary be marked by the sale of roses in London to raise funds for her favourite charities. The arrival of Princess Alexandra of Denmark in the United Kingdom for her marriage to the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) in 1863 was a never-to-be-forgotten occasion. This was attributable to the then recent increase in the railway network, the lack of royal occasions in preceding years and the new process of photography, which had made it possible for pictures of the Princess to be sold in shops prior to the arrival.

When the 50th anniversary of her arrival and wedding came, Queen Alexandra's admirers insisted that it should be celebrated in a special way. A processional drive through the streets of London seemed an obvious choice, but Alexandra wanted an occasion that would help the sick and needy. She developed an idea which would benefit the funds of London hospitals through the sale of artificial wild roses, which were to be made by young women and girls with disabilities at the John Groom Industrial Training Home. The day was to be called \\"Alexandra Rose Day\\", and the initial drive swept Londoners off their feet. The first event raised ¬£32,000 (the equivalent of almost ¬£2 million in 2002 money). The funds raised were a great benefit to hospitals, and the annual drive became an institution, one of the chief attractions of London's summer, with Alexandra the star. By 1920, ¬£775,000 for London hospitals had been raised. Queen Alexandra's Rose Day continued to be celebrated even after her death in 1925.

In medicine, genetic susceptibility to a disease refers to a genetic predisposition to a health problem,What does it mean to have a genetic predisposition to a disease?, US Department of Health which may eventually be triggered by particular environmental or lifestyle factors, such as tobacco smoking or diet. Genetic testing is able to identify individuals who are genetically predisposed to certain diseases. Behavior Predisposition is the capacity we are born with to learn things such as language and concept of self. Negative environmental influences may block the predisposition (ability) we have to do some things. Behaviors displayed by animals can be influenced by genetic predispositions. Genetic predisposition towards certain human behaviors is scientifically investigated by attempts to identify patterns of human behavior that seem to be invariant over long periods of time and in very different cultures. For example, philosopher Daniel Dennett has proposed that humans are genetically predisposed to have a theory of mind because there has been evolutionary selection for the human ability to adopt the intentional stance. The intentional stance is a useful behavioral strategy by which humans assume that others have minds like their own. This assumption allows you to predict the behavior of others based on personal knowledge of what you would do. In 1951, Hans Eysenck and Donald Prell published an experiment in which identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic) twins, ages 11 and 12, were tested for neuroticism. It is described in detail in an article published in the Journal of Mental Science. in which Eysenck and Prell concluded that, \\"The factor of neuroticism is not a statistical artifact, but constitutes a biological unit which is inherited as a whole....neurotic Genetic predisposition is to a large extent hereditarily determined.\\"The Journal of Mental Health, July 1951, Vol. XCVII, \\"The Inheritance of Neuroticism: An Experimental Study\\", H.

In 1841‚Äì42 he was professor of geology in University College, London. He was an accomplished water-colour painter and was elected an honorary member of the Sketch Society. He contributed articles about Architecture and Aquatinta to Rees's Cyclop√¶dia. He was distinguished for his researches on the Cenozoic formations of the Isle of Wight, where he recognised the occurrence of both fresh-water and marine strata; he continued his observations on the mainland of Hampshire, and subsequently in Dorset, where he described the rocks of the Isle of Purbeck and Isle of Portland. Sir Henry Charles Englefield was indebted to him for the geological descriptions and the effective geological views and sections of the Isle of Wight and Dorset that enriched his Description of the Principal Picturesque Beauties, Antiquities and Geological Phenomena of the Isle of Wight (1816). The mineral websterite now known as aluminite was named after him. He died in London on 26 December 1844.

Roughly triangular in shape, it is located on the west coast of the island of Newfoundland. Geography Along Route 460 Park-Boutte du Cap The peninsula extends into the Gulf of St. Lawrence and is joined to Newfoundland by a narrow isthmus connecting at the town of Port au Port. It is bounded on the south by Bay St. George, the western side by the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and on the northwestern side by Port au Port Bay. With a rocky shoreline measuring approximately 130 km in length, the peninsula extends approximately 40 km west from its isthmus to Cape St. George and northwest 50 km to the fingerlike Long Point which by itself is approximately 25 km in length. The eastern shore of the peninsula is irregular, jutting into Port au Port Bay. The Port au Port Peninsula is located on the western edge of the heavily eroded Appalachian Mountain chain which runs along Newfoundland's west coast. There are no natural harbours along the peninsula's rocky coastline. The peninsula was once heavily forested but many areas along its shores have been cleared for subsistence farming. The southern shore is hilly with the northern shore having a sloping lowland extending to a low rise along the centre of the eastern part of the peninsula. The geological structure is complex with the peninsula's sedimentary strata dating to the middle Cambrian to early Ordovician continental margin, creating a carbonate platform of limestone, shale, and sandstone. The heavily folded geological structure in the area has been identified as having an unknown amount of petroleum reserves. History The area was named \\"Ophor portu\\" (port of rest) by Basque fishermen during the 16th-17th centuries. French and Basque fishermen used the west coast of Newfoundland, including the Port au Port Peninsula, for seasonal fishing settlements, however some began permanently inhabiting the area. Mi'kmaq families were also present in the area. During and after the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 and Treaty of Paris in 1763, France retained the right to use of the west coast of the island. This area came to be known as the \\"French Shore\\" and the Port au Port Peninsula was at its centre. Scattered settlement continued in the area until 1904 when France relinquished its right of use to the \\"French Shore\\". The Port au Port Peninsula represents the most varied ethnic and linguistic mix in the entire island of Newfoundland, including Mi'kmaq families with the highest proportion of French-speaking settlement on the island (15%). The French minority, a mix of Mi'kmaq, Acadian, French and Basque, has had an important influence on the area's culture. Newfoundland's unique folk music has been somewhat influenced by musicians from the Port au Port Peninsula, notably √âmile Beno√Æt. Additionally, the area's strong Roman Catholic tradition is reflected in the high visibility accorded to churches throughout the peninsula's communities. As the centre of the province's Franco-Newfoundlander community, the peninsula has been designated the only bilingual district on the island of Newfoundland since 1971. Economy The Port au Port Peninsula's economy is based on natural resources, namely fishing. Limited forestry takes place in the unsettled areas of the interior and a small amount of subsistence farming takes place along coastal areas. Many residents of the peninsula, particularly the communities at the eastern end near the isthmus, work in nearby Kippens and Stephenville. Beginning in 1900 a limestone quarrying operation was established at Aguathuna, near the peninsula's isthmus where the Table Head mountain ridge extends from the Lewis Hills. The limestone was used by Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation at a steel mill in Sydney, Nova Scotia. The quarry was closed in 1966 following DOSCO's financial difficulties. From 1941‚Äì1966, many people in the eastern end of the peninsula were employed at Ernest Harmon AFB in nearby Stephenville. From the 1970s to present a major limestone quarry began operating at Lower Cove employing 30-40 people. In the 1980s-1990s, petroleum companies began exploring the peninsula for oil. Some deposits were discovered in recoverable quantities and limited production wells are in place at some locations. Geologists have estimated that a much larger deposit exists deeper and possibly off shore from the peninsula in the 400-500 billion barrel range, however exploration drilling has not yet confirmed this theory. A Canadian energy company may soon get the green light to begin drilling for oil off Newfoundland's southwest coast. The Canadian Imperial Venture Corporation (CIVC) is waiting for approval from the federal- provincial oil regulator ‚Äì the Canada Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board ‚Äì to drill a test well on Shoal Point, near the Port Au Port Peninsula. The company has been exploring in the area over the last few years. It discovered some oil there in 2008. \\"At the turn of the century there were several wells on the Port Au Port Peninsula, and Shoal Point, that produced somewhere between 20 to 25 barrels a day,\\" said Kirby Mercer, CIVC's vice- president. \\"Now, we're going in with modern technology, modern tools. So we hope to extract the black gold using modern technology.\\" Mercer said if the company receives approval for a test well and drilling is successful, CIVC hopes the Offshore Petroleum Board will then approve a significant discovery licence. That would bring the company one step closer to establishing an oil- producing well in western Newfoundland. Today travellers access the area using the Marine Atlantic ferry service to Channel-Port aux Basques or with Sunwing Airlines, Flair Airlines and Provincial Airlines to the Stephenville International Airport. =Air Service= The Port au Port Peninsula is reachable by air via the Stephenville International Airport.

The name is a play on Jesus' Sermon on the Mount and on the artificial hill in Edinburgh called the Mound, on which the Church's Assembly Hall stands, and the fact that Thatcher was preaching to a church and nation that consistently rejected her ideology. She had been invited by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Duncan Shaw. In the address, Thatcher offered a theological justification for her ideas on capitalism and the market economy. Citing a view that \\"Christianity is about spiritual redemption, not social reform\\", she asserted that the two really should not be separated, but went on to emphasise personal responsibility, also quoting St Paul by saying \\"If a man will not work he shall not eat\\". Choice played a significant part in Thatcherite reforms and Thatcher claimed choice was also Christian by stating that Christ chose to lay down his life and that all individuals have the God-given right to choose between good and evil. Thatcher also justified her belief in individual salvation by quoting from the hymn I Vow to Thee, My Country (which was not in the Church of Scotland's hymnary of the time): The Margaret Thatcher Foundation, which reproduces the full text of the speech on its website and characterises the nickname \\"Sermon on the Mound\\" as distasteful, rates it as having key importance as a statement of Thatcher's views on religion, morality, family, social security, welfare, taxation, education, race, nationality, and civil liberties.

Set in the early 1990s, the novel follows Charlie, an introverted observing teenager, through his freshman year of high school in a Pittsburgh suburb. The novel details Charlie's unconventional style of thinking as he navigates between the worlds of adolescence and adulthood, and attempts to deal with poignant questions spurred by his interactions with both his friends and family. Chbosky took five years to develop and publish The Perks of Being a Wallflower, creating the characters and other aspects of the story from his own memories. The novel addresses themes permeating adolescence, including sexuality, drug use, rape, and mental health, while also making several references to other literary works, films, and pop culture in general. Because of the mentioned themes, it was banned in some American schools for its content. In 2012, Chbosky adapted and directed a film version starring Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller. The film boosted the novel's sales, and the book reached The New York Times Best Seller list.  Plot  Throughout the 1991-1992 school year, Charlie, the 15-year- old protagonist, begins writing letters about his own life to an unknown recipient addressed, \\"dear friend.\\" In these letters he discusses his first year at high school and his struggles with two traumatic experiences: the suicide of his only middle-school friend, Michael Dobson, and the death of his favorite aunt, Helen. His caring English teacher, who encourages Charlie to call him Bill, notices Charlie's passion for reading and writing, and acts as a mentor by assigning him extracurricular books and reports. Although he is a wallflower, Charlie is befriended by two seniors: Patrick and Sam. Patrick is secretly dating Brad, a football player, and Sam is Patrick's stepsister. Charlie quickly develops a consuming crush on Sam and subsequently admits this to her. It is revealed that Sam was sexually abused as a child, and she kisses Charlie to ensure that his first kiss is from someone who truly loves him. Similar to his own experience, Charlie witnesses his sister's boyfriend hit her across the face, but she forbids him from telling their parents. He eventually mentions the occurrence to Bill, who tells Charlie's parents about it. Charlie's relationship with his sister rapidly deteriorates and she continues to see her boyfriend against her parents' wishes. Eventually, he discovers that his sister is pregnant and agrees to bring her to an abortion clinic without telling anyone. His sister breaks up with her boyfriend, after which her relationship with Charlie begins to improve significantly. Charlie is accepted by Sam and Patrick's group of friends and begins experimenting with tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. At a party, Charlie trips on LSD. He cannot control his flashbacks of Aunt Helen, who died in a car crash on her way to buy him a birthday gift. He ends up in the hospital after falling asleep in the snow. At a Rocky Horror Picture Show performance, Charlie is asked to fill in as Rocky for Sam's boyfriend Craig, who was unable to attend the show that night. Their friend Mary Elizabeth is impressed and asks Charlie to the Sadie Hawkins dance and they enter into a desultory relationship. The relationship ends, however, during a game of truth or dare when Charlie is dared to kiss the prettiest girl in the room. He kisses Sam, and Mary Elizabeth storms out of the room in response. Following this, Patrick suggests that Charlie stay away from Sam for a while, and the rest of the friend group shuns him. Without friends to distract Charlie from his thoughts and struggles, his flashbacks of Aunt Helen return. Patrick and Brad's relationship is discovered by Brad's abusive father, and Brad disappears from school for a few days. Upon returning, Brad is cold and mean toward Patrick, while Patrick attempts to reconnect with him. However, when Brad derogatorily attacks Patrick's sexuality in public, Patrick physically attacks Brad until other football players join in and gang up on Patrick. Charlie joins in the fight to defend Patrick, and breaks it up, regaining the respect of Sam and her friends. Patrick begins spending most of his time with Charlie, and Patrick kisses Charlie impulsively but then apologizes. Charlie is sympathetic because he understands that Patrick is still recovering from his romance with Brad. Soon Patrick sees Brad engaging with a stranger in the park and Patrick is able to move on from the relationship. As the school year ends, Charlie is anxious about losing his older friends‚Äîespecially Sam, who is leaving for a summer college-preparatory program and has learned that her boyfriend cheated on her. When Charlie helps her pack, they talk about his feelings for her; she is angry that he never acted on them. They begin to engage sexually, but Charlie suddenly grows inexplicably uncomfortable and stops Sam. Charlie begins to realize that his sexual contact with Sam has stirred up repressed memories of him being molested by his Aunt Helen as a little boy. Charlie shows signs of PTSD from the incident and the revelation of his abuse helps the reader understand his views of relationships and love. In an epilogue, Charlie is discovered by his parents in a catatonic state and does not show any movement despite being hit reluctantly by his father. After being admitted to a mental hospital, it is revealed that Helen actually sexually abused him when he was young‚Äîmemories he had unconsciously repressed. This psychological damage explains his flashbacks and derealization phases throughout the book. In two months Charlie is released, and Sam and Patrick visit him. In the epilogue, Sam, Patrick, and Charlie go through the tunnel again and Charlie stands up and exclaims that he feels infinite. Charlie eventually comes to terms with his past: \\"Even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there\\". Charlie decides to \\"participate\\" in life, and his letter-writing ends.  Background and writing  Author Stephen Chbosky at the San Diego Comic-Con in 2006 Chbosky incorporated both fictional ideas and personal experiences to the novel, making it semi-autobiographical. After five years with these elements in mind, he had the idea of writing the novel during a difficult period in his life. He was experiencing an unpleasant breakup of his own, which led him to ask, \\"Why good people let themselves get treated so badly?\\" The author tried to answer the question with the sentence \\"we accept the love we think we deserve\\". This quote references the struggle of finding self love, encompassing one's life and hope for the future, and not just romantic love. The story began when Chbosky was in school, evolving from another book on which he was working. In that book he wrote the sentence, \\"I guess that's just one of the perks of being a wallflower\\", which led him to realize \\"that somewhere in that ... was the kid I was really trying to find.\\" Chbosky began writing the novel in the summer of 1996 while he was in college, and within ten weeks he completed the story. He rewrote it into two more drafts, concluding the published version in the summer of 1998. Charlie was loosely based on Chbosky himself. In the novel, Chbosky included much of his own memories from the time he lived in Pittsburgh. The other characters were manifestations of people Chbosky had known throughout his life; Chbosky focused on people's struggles and what they are passionate about, attempting to pin down the very nature of each of the characters. The characters of Sam and Patrick were an \\"amalgamate and celebration\\" of several people Chbosky has met; Sam was based on girls who confided in him, and Patrick was \\"all the kids I knew who were gay and finding their way to their own identity.\\"  Style and themes  The idea of anonymous letters came from a real experience; during his senior year in high school, Chbosky wrote an anonymous letter to Stewart Stern about how Rebel Without a Cause had influenced him. A year and a half later, Stern found Chbosky and became his mentor. By using a series of letters from Charlie to an anonymous character, Chbosky found \\"the most intimate way\\" to talk directly to the reader. He thought the letters would help him keep the story cohesive, \\"to convey the highs and lows of being young‚Äîone day, you're on top of the world and you've had the greatest of times\\". Critics have identified primary themes of teenage reality and nostalgia. According to David Edelstein of the New York Magazine, Chbosky captures the \\"feeling you belong when among friends, yet you'd soon be alone\\" and notes that \\"the pain of loss ... [is] almost as intense as the bliss ... it's nostalgia with an emphasis on nostos, pain [sic].\\" Marty Beckerman of Word Riot said that The Perks of Being a Wallflower connects with young people because its scenes are \\"so universal and happen to so many teenagers.\\" Chbosky wanted to convey respect for teenagers, to \\"validate and respect and celebrate what [teenagers] are going through every day\\", and said the novel is for \\"anyone who's felt like an outcast.\\" Read by all ages, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is targeted at a teenage audience. The book addresses a range of themes dispassionately. These themes include drugs, friendship, body image, first love, suicide, eating disorders and sexuality. Chbosky appreciates the importance of entertainment in adolescence: \\"Books, songs, and movies are more than entertainment when we're young. They help all of us discover who we are, what we believe, and what we hope our life can be.\\" As such, the book contains several cultural references across all mediums: musically the book references The Smiths and Fleetwood Mac, literarily the book references This Side of Paradise, On the Road, To Kill a Mockingbird, Hamlet, The Stranger and Walden, and theatrically the book references The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Publication and reception The Perks of Being a Wallflower was first published on February 1, 1999 by Pocket Books through its MTV Books imprint. It became the subsidiary's best-selling book with 100,000 copies in print as of 2000, and was included on school reading lists and gathered a cult following. By 2012, the novel had been published in 16 countries in 13 languages, and that same year it placed at number 16 on NPR's list of the \\"100 Best-Ever Teen Novels\\". Critical response was mixed; Publishers Weekly called the novel \\"trite\\", dealing with \\"standard teenage issues\\" in which \\"Chbosky infuses a droning insistence on Charlie's supersensitive disposition.\\" Although Kirkus Reviews said it had \\"the right combination of realism and uplift\\", the reviewer criticized Chbosky's \\"rip- off\\" of J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. Although other reviewers made similar comparisons, Chbosky said he \\"was not trying to mimic [Salinger's] style as a writer\\"; he saw \\"how readers could compare Charlie to Salinger's Holden Caulfield, but \\"they are very different people with unique problems and perspectives\\". More positive was Francisca Goldsmith of the School Library Journal, who said the novel \\"cleverly\\" makes the readers the recipients of Charlie's letters, and it \\"will engage teen readers for years to come.\\" Common Sense Media's Kate Pavao praised its relevant themes for teenagers: \\"Readers will find themselves quickly feeling sorry for the protagonist and worrying about him throughout his transformative journey.\\" For The A.V. Club, Marah Eakin wrote that although for an adult \\"Perks suffers from an overabundance of pure, raw angst ... unlike some more arrested development-friendly young adult fare like Harry Potter, Perks speaks to a more specific age range and does it well.\\" The Perks of Being a Wallflower has appeared six times on the American Library Association's list of 10 most-frequently-challenged books for its content. A Wisconsin school board refused to ban the book, angering local parents. The Glen Ellyn District 41 school board in suburban Chicago unanimously voted to reinstate the novel after it was removed from eighth- grade classrooms at Hadley Junior High School because of a parent's objection to its sexual content. Groups like PABBIS (Parents Against Bad Books in School) work to restrict literature considered \\"controversial\\" from being accessed by younger children. The group believes these \\"bad books\\" should be moved to the adult section. In 2009, Perks was repeatedly challenged for descriptions of masturbation, sexually explicit conduct, drug use, and talk of suicide, and there have been multiple pushes across the United States to move this literary work from the children and young adults section to the adult section. Parents have raised issues with the novel for its \\"pornographic\\" content and \\"vulgarity,\\" but others have argued that the book deals with real and common teen issues concerned with growing up, so it presents a truthful viewpoint. Issues are also raised surrounding the book's themes of homosexuality, as well as a \\"glorification\\" of the use of drugs and alcohol. In an interview, Chbosky said that he knew of two school boards which have banned the book (in Massachusetts and on Long Island). Since he \\"didn't write it to be a controversial book,\\" he was \\"surprised\\" by the bans. Film adaptation Since he wrote The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Chbosky aspired to adapt it into a film, calling this a \\"lifelong dream of his\\". After the publication of the novel, the author said he received film offers, refusing them because he \\"owed the fans a movie that was worthy of their love for the book\\". In 2010 Mr. Mudd began developing a film version, and the author was signed to write and direct the film by producers John Malkovich, Lianne Halfon and Russell Smith. The film, shot in the Pittsburgh area from May 9 to June 29, 2011, starred Logan Lerman as Charlie, Emma Watson as Sam, Ezra Miller as Patrick, and Nina Dobrev as Charlie's sister, Candace. With the announcement of a film adaptation, the novel received more attention; its sales increased from 88,847 copies in 2011 to 425,933 in 2012, and it reached the New York Times bestseller lists. It entered the Children's Paperback Books category on the June 23, 2012 list, and had 1.5 million copies in print in November 2012. As of May 11, 2014 it appeared on The New York Times top 10 list for the 71st non-consecutive week, and was in the top 15 on the November 23 list. The film premiered on September 8, 2012 at the Toronto International Film Festival, and was released theatrically in the United States by Summit Entertainment on September 21. According to Metacritic it has received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", with an average of 67 out of 100 based on 36 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported an 86% approval rate, based on 153 reviews. The film grossed over $33 million worldwide from a $13 million production budget. Some scenes were omitted from the film adaptation: In the book, Charlie's parents are notified by Bill that Candace is being abused by her boyfriend, to which his parents take direct intervention in the abusive relationship in the book. Also omitted from the film is the side-story where Candace gets pregnant by her abusive boyfriend and is accompanied by Charlie to the abortion clinic. In addition, one of the more important pieces of the book, the poem, was deleted from the film before its release. There is a special features section on the DVD with scenes that were shot but didn't make it into the film.

Biography Brande was born in Arlington Street, London, England, the youngest son of six children to Augustus Everard Brande an apothecary, originally from Hanover in Germany. He was educated first in Kensington and then in Westminster.http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf After leaving Westminster School, he was apprenticed, in 1802, to his brother, an apothecary, with the view of adopting the profession of medicine. He studied medicine at Great Windmill Street Medical School and at St George's Hospital, before being drawn to chemistry following a meeting with Humphry Davy. He then began to lecture in chemistry, based on a sound knowledge of which he acquired in his spare time. In 1811 he published the first of what were to be two very influential articles on the measurement of alcohol in fermented drinks, including wine, cider and ale.Brande, William Thomas. \\"Experiments to Ascertain the State in Which Spirit Exists in Fermented Liquors: With a Table Exhibiting the Relative Proportion of Pure Alcohol Contained in Several Kinds of Wine and Some Other Liquors.\\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, vol. 101, 1811, pp. 337‚Äì346. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/107349.Brande, William Thomas. \\"Additional Remarks on the State in Which Alcohol Exists in Fermented Liquors.\\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, vol. 103, 1813, pp. 82‚Äì87. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/107392. Until that point chemists had only been able to measure alcohol in distilled drinks (brandy, gin etc.), which many early temperance reformers had assumed to be a poison. By showing that alcohol was present in fermented drinks from the start (rather than being a by-product of the distillation process), Brande undermined the long-standing view that spirits were toxic, while wine and beer were more wholesome. These findings were later propagated by the Temperance movement and used to justify total alcoholic abstinence, or teetotalism. In 1812 he was appointed professor of chemistry to the Apothecaries' Society, and delivered a course of lectures before the Board of Agriculture in place of Sir Humphry Davy, whom in the following year he succeeded in the chair of chemistry at the Royal Institution, London. In 1821 he was the first to isolate the element lithium, which he did by electrolysis of lithium oxide.A Manual of Chemistry: Containing the Principal Facts of the Science, Arranged in the Order in which They are Discussed and Illustrated in the Lectures at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, William Thomas Brande and William James MacNeven,1821, p.190 From about 1823 onwards, Brande worked increasingly with the Royal Mint, eventually becoming Superintendent of the Coining and Die Department. Brande's Manual of Chemistry, first published in 1819, enjoyed wide popularity, and among other works he brought out a Dictionary of Science, Literature and Art in 1842. He was working on a new edition when he died at Tunbridge Wells. He contributed articles to Rees's Cyclop√¶dia on Chemistry, but the topics are not known. Lectures In 1834, 1836, 1839, 1842, 1844, 1847 and 1850 Brande was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on Chemistry; Chemistry of the Gases; The Chemistry of the Atmosphere and the Ocean; The Chemistry of the Non-Metallic Elements; The Chemistry of the Gases; The Elements of Organic Chemistry and The Chemistry of Coal respectively.
