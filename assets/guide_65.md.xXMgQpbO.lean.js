These fixatives, also known as permanent coatings in the radioactive contamination control field, have been used for many decades in facilities processing radioactive material to control radioactive contamination. There has been increased interest in these fixatives or coatings recently due to the growing concern of contamination from a radioactivity dispersal device (RDD also known as a dirty bomb) and because radioactivity fixatives in use today lose the ability to contain the radioactivity to the surface during a fire. Radioactivity fixatives reduce or eliminate the movement of radionuclides from surfaces thereby lowering the health risk of inhalation or other exposure to radioactive isotopes. There are many articles on the use of radioactive fixatives with a review article from 1983 often used as a reference. A more recent review article looks at the use of these radioactive fixatives for use after the detonation of a RDD.

She studied at The Art Students League, NY and The Hudson River Museum, and RSDI during her early years. After high School she attended California College of Art, Philadelphia College of Art, State University of NY, and graduated with a certificate arts completion from Parsons School of Design in 1980. She also studied with Betty Warren at the Malden Bridge School of Art, where she met her future husband Michael Lancaster. Harnack and Lancaster founded The Malden Bridge Pottery in 1980. She began her work in clay during this time and although the couple made functional ceramics she began exploring mixed media on clay and making abstract figurative sculptures  Contributions in Ceramic Art and the Drive to Support Artists  Barbara Harnack has made numerous contributions in the arts especially in ceramic arts. In 2006 she and her husband created the Harnack/ Lancaster Award for excellence and innovation in the Ceramic Arts awarded by New Mexico Potters and Clay Artists. Her interest in elevating and contributing to artists began in the 1980s when she and her husband began creating awards for artists in exhibits at their Woods Gallery, including exhibits such as \\"Art Wear for the Home and Body,\\" which expressed the artist's role in interior design. Her desire to support artists was best expressed in the collaborative effort to create The Malden Bridge Arts Center which housed her gallery and studio may have been best addressed when she collaborated with George Ricky and created the invitational show \\"Six Sculptors,\\" which showcased Rickey and artists and fellows in his foundation. In 1983 Harnack and her husband, along with interested community members established \\"The Malden Bridge Playhouse Society\\" to honor the former renowned summer stock theater where their gallery resided, and to bring performing arts back to the same venue.

She was the first woman elected to the city council of New York City and the first woman to be involved in a New York City Charter Revision Commission. She was also a feminist.  Biography  Earle was born in Blythebourne in 1885 and attended Erasmus Hall High School. Earle graduated from Adelphi University in 1907. She had worked in the field of sociology while in school and showed interest in becoming involved in New York politics immediately after graduation. She married William P. Earle, Jr. on October 22, 1913. They had two children, Mary and William, Jr. Earle's husband died in 1940 of an \\"abdominal ailment.\\" In 1948, she spent four months in the hospital when she broke her hip by slipping on the ice, and this may have influenced her decision to retire from council later. In 1949, she retired from New York City politics and moved to Bell House in Bellport. She died in her home in a fire that may have been \\"caused by a dropped cigarette in her bedroom.\\"  Career  Earle began working in politics in 1907. She started doing municipal research in 1908 and was one of the first women in this field. As a direct result of her early studies, salaries for police patrolmen were increased in New York. She chaired a woman's committee for the election of John Purroy Mitchel in 1917. Also in 1917, she was appointed to the board of Child Welfare. Earle was president of the Brooklyn chapter of the League of Women Voters. Earle served as the first woman on a New York City Charter Revision Commission during 1935 to 1936. The charter created by the commission was adopted in 1936 and initiated the use of proportional representation in the city‚Äôs elections. She was awarded a gold medal of service to Brooklyn, partly because of her work on the commission, which was presented by Mayor La Guardia in 1936. Earle was the first woman elected to the New York City Council in 1937, and she was the only woman to serve as a council member in the city for some time. She was one of a pool of 99 candidates for council, out of which 9 were voted in. Earle ran as a member of the City Fusion Party, and also had the support of many African American voters in Brooklyn. Earle also appointed a black woman, Emily V. Gibbes, to a job in the city as a secretary. She served in council from 1938 to 1949. Between 1940 and 1949, she was the council's Republican Minority Leader. While on the council, she promoted the creation of recreational centers and playgrounds in the city. In 1953, she was appointed to a five-year term on Suffolk County's Planning Board. Earle was also involved with libraries. In 1934, Mayor La Guardia appointed her to the board of trustees for the Brooklyn Public Library. Earle worked closely with Municipal Reference Librarian, Rebecca Browning Rankin, who helped her with research related to council work. Earle was a vice president of the board of the Bellport Memorial Library. She started an archives collection at Bellport Memorial Library. Adelphi University honored Earle with an Honorary Doctorate of Laws in 1942. In 1962, Adelphi named a girls' dormitory \\"Earle Hall,\\" in her honor.

Born on February 8, 1900, in Palouse, Washington, Powers studied chemistry at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon, a small private college founded in 1846. From 1930 until his retirement in 1965 he conducted research at the famous PCA (Portland Cement Association) Laboratories (located initially in Chicago and later in Skokie, Illinois). For many years until his retirement in 1965 he served as the PCA Director. His stellar research achievements earned him top honors. The ACI (American Concrete Institute) bestowed on Powers its highest award, the Wason Medal for Materials Research; in fact, it did so three times, in 1933, 1940 and 1948, which is a singular case in ACI history testifying to his fundamental contributions. In 1957, Powers received the S.E. Thompson Award from the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) and, in 1976, the Arthur R. Anderson Award from the ACI.

It was also formerly known as Big Chief Highway Hotel and Big Chief Dakota Grill. The restaurant opened in 1928 as part of a tourist camp that included overnight accommodations for travelers on the newly opened U.S. Route 66 at Pond, Missouri, now incorporated within Wildwood. After the highway was later routed to bypass Pond, the business struggled to survive, operating as housing for government employees during World War II. Eventually the cabins were demolished, and the restaurant was used for other business operations. It was reopened as a restaurant in the 1990s. Background The opening of U.S. Route 66 made it possible for motorists to travel from Chicago to Santa Monica, California, on one highway. As people began exploring the United States on the newly created thoroughfare, restaurants and overnight accommodations sprang up along the way. The lodgings were alternately known as tourist courts, tourist camps, tourist cabins, and motels. Beginnings on U.S. Route 66 Once it was known that Route 66 would go through the community of Pond, later incorporated into Wildwood, plans were drawn up to build the Big Chief Highway Hotel complex. An article that appeared on April 19, 1929, in the Washington Citizen newspaper in Washington, Missouri, credited Walter H. Petring of the Highway Hotel Corporation in St. Louis as the man in charge of planning a series of tourist camps along the route. According to that source, Petring envisioned a chain of tourists camps the length of U.S. Route 66 itself, \\"one day's drive apart\\" from each. In later accounts of this, William Clay Pierce of Texas-based Pierce-Pennant Oil Company is credited as the Big Chief developer and originator of the chain concept for the endeavor. Others have claimed Pierce built another Big Chief in Illinois, which the National Park Service has deemed \\"unlikely\\". Regardless of who is credited for the idea, when the National Park Service conducted research for the NRHP certification, they found no evidence that anyone ever carried out the plans of expansion. The 62-unit tourist camp that opened in 1928 was designed in the Mission Revival architecture style, and built at an estimated cost of $150,000‚Äì$200,000. The individual units rented for $1.50 a night, and were aligned on the property in what resembled a rectangle with one of the long sides open to the highway. The two-story restaurant at Big Chief featured a bell tower, and was a full-service establishment, more formal than the small diner-style eateries usually associated with tourist camps. It served lunch and dinner, and provided an area for \\"bridge parties\\" and banquets. A 1928 article from the Pacific Transcript newspaper in Pacific, Missouri, mentioned that in addition to what would be considered standard amenities, each unit was provided a garage for the traveler's automobile. A locked gate kept everyone but the paying guests out, and apparently kept the guests in: \\"There is no driving back and forth in the night.\\" A full service gas station was on the premises, as well as recreational facilities for both children and adults that included a concrete area on the grounds designated as a dance floor. Post-1932 ventures U.S. Route 66 was re-routed in 1932, after which it no longer ran through Pond. With the 1933 Repeal of Prohibition in the United States, the restaurant added \\"The Tap\\" room for service of alcoholic beverages. Although business began to sag after the re-route, the Big Chief adapted by providing housing for employees at the Weldon Spring Ordnance Works, which manufactured explosives for the military during World War II, and employees of the Weldon Spring uranium processing plant. After the restaurant's 1949 closure, the property site and existing buildings were owned by Marco and Rose Aceto, who removed the bell tower and used the restaurant for various business ventures. Their original intent of continuing the restaurant never materialized, and the cabins were eventually demolished. G. Todd DeVille purchased the remaining property in the 1990s. The restaurant re- opened in 1995 as the Big Chief Dakota Grill, and currently operates as the Big Chief Roadhouse. It is the lone survivor of the original 1928 complex. NRHP designation Big Chief Restaurant was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in 2003.

Raised in a semi-suburban midwestern environment, his work consistently reflects several aspects of his upbringing, including the suburban landscape, the wonder of nature, and popular American architecture and design, as well as his own personal travels. Bingaman also intentionally relates his work to American and European literary sources such as Cormac McCarthy, David Foster Wallace, and W.G. Sebald, respectively. Bingaman is represented by Haw Contemporary in Kansas City, Missouri. His work consists of large-scale paintings and works on paper.  Education  Bingaman received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Painting from the University of Kansas in 2005 and a Master of Fine Arts in Visual Art from the Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts at Washington University in St. Louis in 2007.  Exhibitions  In 2014, selections from \\"Night Pools\\", an ongoing series of paintings, were shown in his first one-person museum show at the Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art in Overland Park, Kansas.

She was an anti-Apartheid activist who went on to serve her country as a Member of the first democratically elected parliament of South Africa. She then proceeded to a career as a distinguished diplomat. She serves on the Advisory Board of Elders of the Ifa Lethu Foundation, which repatriates South African artworks. She is also a patron of Dramatic Need, a UK-based charity that promotes creative arts for children, and is an advisory Council Member of the Thabo Mbeki Foundation. She has also served as the Chairperson of the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund UK. Early life and career Mabuza was born in Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal, in South Africa. She completed her high school in St Louis Betrand High School in Newcastle. She then went on attend Roma College in Lesotho and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree. Owing to her struggle to find employment in apartheid South Africa, Mabuza moved to Swaziland and became a teacher of English and Zulu. In 1964 she moved to the United States and enrolled at Stanford University where she completed a Masters degree in English. She went further to obtain her second master's degree in History majoring in American Studies from the University of Minnesota. In 1968 she became a lecturer in the Department of Sociology and the University of Minnesota. In 1969 she joined the University of Ohio as Assistant Professor of Literature and History. Later in 1993 she obtained a Diploma in Diplomacy in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. Her personal experience of racial segregation in South Africa, which led her to leave South Africa, and her exposure to the plight of African Americans in the Civil Rights Movement prompted Mabuza to join the struggle for the emancipation of her people in South Africa and Africa as a whole. In 1975 she joined the African National Congress (ANC) and moved to Lusaka in Zambia. In 1977 she became Editor of Voice of Women, a feminist journal for women in the ANC. She was also a radio journalist and broadcaster in Radio Freedom, which was the ANC's radio station, broadcasting from Zambia to multiple African countries. She was also the Chairperson of the ANC's Cultural Committee. In 1979 the then ANC president Oliver Reginald Tambo assigned Mabuza to open ANC offices in Scandinavia and to become the ANC's Chief Representative to Scandinavian countries, residing in Stockholm, Sweden. Tambo reflected later in his speech to the ANC's women section in 1981 in Angola that \\"Comrade Lindiwe Mabuza cried and sobbed and ultimately collapsed on top of herself when she learnt she had been appointed ANC Chief Representative to the Scandinavian countries. But, looking at the record, could any man have done better?\\" During her time in Sweden, she mobilised support for the ANC and raised funds for ANC work across the world, especially for exiled South Africans in Zambia. She also led campaigns and lobbied towards the isolation of South Africa through trade bans and boycotts. She forged strong relationships with Scandinavians and was very close to the Prime minister of Sweden, Olof Palme, who was a major supporter of the ANC and resistance to the apartheid government. She had become such a formidable force against the apartheid government that on Monday, 8 September 1986, the ANC office was bombed with the hope of killing her and sabotaging the work she was doing. By the time Mabuza left Scandinavia. she had been so successful that the international offices of the ANC that she managed had grown to include Finland, Denmark, and Norway. in 1986, Mabuza was transferred from Sweden to the United States where she served as the ANC's Chief Representative. With the aid of the Swedes, Mabuza managed to open and run an office based in Washington, DC. She arrived in America shortly after the American government had imposed sanctions on Apartheid South Africa. She continued to lobby congress and to work with many American activists like Jesse Jackson, Harry Belafonte, Muhammad Ali, Jane Fonda and many others. She was instrumental in the many boycotts, rallies and other efforts to frustrate the apartheid government. Her efforts, with the help of other organizations and American colleges across America, led to Coca-Cola and many other such corporations withdrawing their investments from South Africa. Later, after the political prisoners from Robben Island were released, including Nelson Mandela, Mabuza was key in organising Mandela's first visit to America after his release.  In democratic South Africa  Although Lindiwe Mabuza had spent many years in political exile, she was nominated into the first democratic parliament of South Africa serving under president Mandela. Her passion was still diplomacy and her party, now the new ANC government, knew this. She was then appointed as South African Ambassador to Germany in 1995. She was a celebrated diplomat in Germany because of her own efforts in human rights. A reception was held in her honour to mark her signing of the Goldene Buch in Karlsruhe Rathaus, an honour reserved only for heads of state. She also accompanied the German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on a major trade visit to South Africa. In 1999, she became South African High Commissioner to Malaysia and Brunei and the Philippines. In 2001, she was appointed South African High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, a post she held till 2010.  Poetry and writings  Mabuza started writing poetry when she was involved in \\"The Way Project\\" in the United States that tried to create programmes through which children can be kept off the streets. When she arrived in Zambia, she soon discovered that ANC women did not have a voice so she coedited an anthology of poems by ANC women titled Malibongwe! ANC Women: Poetry is their weapon in 1978. Selections of her poems also appear in Anta Sudan Katara Mberi and Cosmo Pieterse's anthology Speak Easy, Speak Free (1977) and her poetry is included in Barry Feinberg's anthology Poets to the People: South African Freedom Poem (1980) and in The Heinemann Book of African Women's Poetry (1995). Her own anthologies are: * Letter to Letta, 1991, which she titled after her dear friend the musician Letta Mbulu. * Voices that Lead: Poems 1976-1996 * Footprints and fingerprints, published in 2008. * To Sweden from ANC, poetry published 1987. In 2007, she published a children's book titled 'South African Animals' with illustrations by Alan Baker. Mabuza also coedited (with Pallo Jordan) the book Oliver Tambo Remembered, in honour of her mentor and friend Oliver Tambo. The book is a collection of essays by Tambo's friends and comrades. She also conceived the idea to compile a collection of essays on former South African President Thabo Mbeki, an idea leading to the bestseller titled The Thabo Mbeki I Know. Inspired by the 100th anniversary of Tambo's birth, she edited the volume Conversations with Uncle O. R. Tambo: Childhood Memories in Exile, a collection of letters by writers who were children at the time when Tambo was president of the ANC.Don Makatile, \\"Book recounts life of humble OR Tanbo\\", The Sunday Independent, 13 May 2018, via PressReader.

R. Van Dongen \\"Sam Hall\\" is a science fiction novelette by Poul Anderson, first published in Astounding Science Fiction in August 1953.ISDFB, retrieved April 6, 2017 Setting The story is set in a 21st- century in which the United States has descended into totalitarianism (while retaining the outward forms of republican government) in the aftermath of two additional world wars. Conventional wisdom (as relayed by the story's viewpoint character) maintains that the US loss in World War III had forced the nation to become a \\"garrison state\\" in order to prevail in World War IV, but it is not specified who the combatants in either of these conflicts had been; the USSR is never mentioned in the story (aside from the suggestive detail that Moscow, Idaho has been renamed to \\"Americatown.\\") The story's World War IV may be identical with a conflict ten years prior to the events of \\"Sam Hall,\\" in which China had carried out \\"abortive\\" nuclear attacks on several American cities; the viewpoint character comes to suspect this may have been a false flag conducted by the US regime itself. At some point prior to that, the US had also fought and won a war against Brazil; the viewpoint character is certain this was a pretext to obtain basing rights and minerals. At the point when the story takes place, the US regime appears to exercise some form of security hegemony over the entire rest of the Earth, with the Anglosphere nations enjoying some form of autonomy. The US also has exclusive control over human settlement of the Solar System; the most important of these is a pre-Mariner habitable Venus, which hosts thorium mines operated by conscript labor under inhuman conditions, though there are colonies on Mars, the Moon, and the Jovian satellites as well. Synopsis Major Thornberg is a technical officer in command of an underground base built around \\"Matilda,\\" a vast electromechanical computer that maintains a comprehensive national database of all US citizens' records and interactions. Thornberg is a veteran of the Brazilian war and considered politically reliable by the regime, but something in him snaps when his nephew is sent to a concentration camp and shortly thereafter murdered. In a minor act of rebellion, he uses his unrestricted access to Matilda to fabricate the existence of a small-time anti-government militant, whom he names \\"Sam Hall\\" after the angry folk song of the same name, and begins inserting false evidence of Hall's involvement into the records of real crimes. After a brewing anti-regime underground - whose attacks are becoming more brazen and frequent - starts to use the Sam Hall identity, the fictional rebel becomes a household name. Unable to obtain any independently verifiable information on Hall, the government begins to suspect internal subversion and grows increasingly paranoid; meanwhile, the rebels emerge into the open and launch a full-scale civil war, billed as the \\"Third American Revolution.\\" Thornberg takes advantage of the worsening chaos by inserting incriminating fabrications into the records of senior regime personnel, hoping to sow distrust among the ranks and bring down the government before it can recall its Venusian garrison troops - which include his son - to reinforce Earth. With the regime paralyzed and disintegrating, soldiers arrive at the Matilda base to arrest Thornberg, who is by this point himself unsure whether his treason has finally been discovered or whether he has merely been randomly implicated in one of his own fabricated witch-hunts. He forces the troops to surrender with a dead-man switch he has wired to an EMP that would wipe all the data stored in Matilda. In an epilogue, Thornberg asks a rebel officer what will be done with Matilda; the man assures him it will be destroyed once the war ends, as the underground believes that a government with the ability to conduct this level of surveillance against its population is incompatible with democracy. Sequel In 1964, Anderson produced a loose sequel in the short novel Three Worlds to Conquer, set on a US prison colony on Ganymede during the rebellion on Earth.

Paul. It has been published in three editions. The first, subtitled A Micmac Perspective on the Collision of Aboriginal and European Civilizations, was published by Nimbus, based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Fernwood Publishing, also of Halifax, published an updated edition in 2000; and in 2006 Paul expanded and revised the book, publishing it through Fernwood, with the simple subtitle, Collision Between European and Native American Civilizations. The 2006 edition has fourteen chapters, ranging from \\"Mi'kmaq Social Values and Economy\\" to \\"Twentieth-Century Racism and Centralization\\" and \\"The Struggle for Freedom.\\" It delineates seven independent Mi'kmaq Districts, which cover all of the Canadian Provinces of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, north of the Saint John River, Quebec, the Gaspe region, and the Northern part of the State of Maine, USA. It argues that pre-contact Mi'kmaq people enjoyed what was probably the highest standard of living in the world, without poverty or hunger, and with a social environment that valued community well-being. The book's middle chapters trace the wars with European nations during the period of colonization, and the major Indian treaties of the eighteenth century. In the final chapters, Paul describes Mi'kmaq communities and land bases as dramatically reduced and impoverished by less than two centuries of European colonization. Reception One reviewer has described the book as \\"a Canadian version of Dee Brown's best seller Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\", a seminal work published in 1971. Critic Tasha Hubbard says that \\"Paul is not afraid to stray from the typical 'objective' tone found in most historical texts.\\" American scholar Michael Mullin has written that the book is \\"a call for help. . .[written] for other Micmacs and their allies in the larger Canadian community.\\"  Edition history  Each new edition is revised with new information added.

While the exact address is not listed, the office was on Pine Street in Freeport. All of the articles archived by Dawnland Voices have Pine Street listed as the place to send submissions and money. The newsletter was produced by Penobscot and Indian Island resident ssipsis, also known as Eugenia T. Thompson, as well as edited by various volunteers on the small staff. The newsletter sought to inform and ‚Äúserve the Indians in Maine‚Äù. Because target readership was Native Americans, the newsletter‚Äôs content contained items of interest, such as news, fictional stories, advertisements, and art, relevant to native peoples. Background The Maine Indian Newsletter originated during the Red Power movement, a period in the 60s and 70s of reinvigorated Native American political effort to mobilize their communities into action against the perceived wrongs against their sovereignty by state and federal governments, dating back to initial European colonization. The front cover of the 1972 Maine Indian Newsletter references this social movement as a theme of the newsletter with a handwritten Red Power slogan. One aspect of the Native American movement to gain full land and self-government involved combating mainstream news by developing their own news sources. Many native peoples resented white mainstream accounts of recent events in the early 70s like the Wounded Knee incident, which they argued unfairly represented American Indians. Because of the increase in Native American periodical publications, this period also marked the inception of the American Indian Press Association, an organization brought about in part to hold native journalism to more rigorous editorial standards as well as work towards developing a national native press that could compete with mainstream news representations of Indian affairs. At the publication time of later issues of Maine Indian Newsletter, the Penobscot people, joined with the Passamaquoddy tribe, were actively suing the State of Maine over what they argued were violations of 200 year-old land treaties, in that Maine had denied the tribes their right to 12 million acres. Many of the Newsletter issues reflect concerns with Penobscot land and sovereignty rights. Two years after the final publication of Maine Indian Newsletter, the courts reached their verdict in favor of the Penobscot and Passamaquoddy tribes. Content Newsletters were published monthly and distributed to readers via mail. Each newsletter ran about 16-20 pages long and was produced in black and white on a typewriter with each article hand- typed by ssipsis, the editor. Unlike some tribal nation newsletters, which are disseminated by the tribal government, the Maine Indian Newsletter was privately produced. The style and format of the newsletter was similar to many American Indian independent publications at the time: short, monthly tabloids produced inexpensively by a small staff that resembled ‚Äúin formal and technical quality many small-town weeklies‚Äù. Informal and sometimes humorous editor‚Äôs notes commonly featured alongside articles in each issue. Content ranged from local Indian Island reservation news, such as births, deaths, and tribal government meeting minutes, to national events and legislation pertinent to Native Americans. Other information covered included stories, jokes, comics, letters to the editor, and native business advertisements. Articles, especially those in the earlier publications, were often recycled stories about serious issues from other Indian and non-Indian newspapers across the state and nation, such as Bangor Daily News and Navajo Times. Readers were welcome to contribute to each issue, and frequently did. Although intended to serve the Indians of Maine, readers did not just include on and off- reservation Penobscot Indians and indigenous people from other Maine tribes. Readership also extended beyond Maine borders and outside of the native community, such that the editor included a $2 newsletter subscription fee as of January 1968 for non-Indians (the newsletter was free for American Indians). The hope behind the subscription fee was to \\"see if the newsletter could be self supporting.\\" Some national newsletters charge for their articles but local publications like The Chehalis Tribal Newsletter do not charge. Local publications have a stronger desire to actively benefit their community. There are several stories from the October 1967 issue that are further developed in later issues. For example, the Pine Tree Legal Assistance group is mentioned in October of 1967 and is further expanded on in the February 1968 issue. Further reading *Rolde, Neil.

Crawford, in Latino and African American Athletes Today: A Biographical Dictionary, David L. Porter, ed. (Greenwood, 2004) p401 is an American former professional rodeo cowboy who specialized in tie-down roping. He won eight Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) world championships and three National Finals Rodeo (NFR) aggregate titles. Seven of those titles were World Tie-Down Roping Championships and one was the World All-Around Cowboy Championship. He is one of a very few black professional cowboys and by far the most successful. Whitfield was elected to the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 2004. Early life Fred Whitfield was born in Hockley, Texas on August 5, 1967, to Willie and Marie Whitfield. He was raised in Cypress, Texas, just north of Houston, in a violent, extremely poor home. His mother bore five children, but two were placed for adoption because she could not afford to take care of them. Whitfield was raised with a brother and a younger sister. Their father was an alcoholic who regularly abused their mother. Twice, she shot him after he beat her. In the mid-1970s, Willie Whitfield was sent to prison for killing a man in a dispute over a woman. The younger Whitfield was relieved that his father was no longer in the house. Marie Whitfield supported the family by cleaning the house of their white neighbors, Don and Joanne Moffitt. Their son Roy was seven years older than Whitfield. Despite the age difference, Roy Moffitt took Whitfield under his wing. When Whitfield was six, Moffitt taught him to rope. They often practiced on dogs, chickens, cats, and, occasionally, Whitfield's younger sister. The Moffitt family allowed Whitfield to use their horses and equipment to compete in youth rodeos, and often paid his entry fees. Whitfield specialized in tie-down roping. In this event, a calf is released from a chute. After a short head start, a cowboy on horseback lassos the calf. The cowboy then dismounts, throws the calf to the ground, and ties any three of the calf's legs together. The competitor with the fastest time wins. As a teenager, Whitfield worked as a horse-trainer for a local rancher and competed in amateur rodeos, including the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeos (a rodeo circuit intended for African-American competitors). He graduated from high school in 1986. Rodeo career Whitfield joined the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) in 1990. This allowed him to compete in PRCA-sanctioned rodeos. His early years were difficult. The PRCA membership was overwhelmingly white; fewer than 5% of competitors were black. Cowboys were expected to provide their own equipment and have access to livestock. Few black men had those resources, limiting their ability to break into the sport. His peers - and the crowds - were not always receptive to the idea of a black cowboy. Others were disgusted that Whitfield often dated white women. Crowds sometimes yelled racist remarks when he competed. Some white cowboys tried to incite him to fight. He said that the disapproval \\"just fuels me. Any chance I get to kick their a‚Äì in competition, I‚Äôm going to do it.\\" Professional cowboys earn money when they are among the top finishers at a rodeo event. In many cases, a win will earn them no more than $1,000. Each dollar of prize money earned at PRCA-sanctioned events is counted towards qualification in the annual National Finals Rodeo (NFR). In his rookie year, Whitfield was one of the top-15 highest earners in calf roping, making him the second first-year competitor to ever qualify for the NFR. Whitfield won the NFR in 1991 in tie-down roping. He was the second black man to win an NFR title, and first to win a timed event title. In 1989, Whitfield was jailed overnight for brawling with a black man at a bar near a Bill Pickett rodeo in California. His opponent sliced him across the left cheek; the cut required over 30 stitches to close. Whitfield responded by beating the man with a tire iron. In 1996, Whitfield brawled with three white bull riders. When they taunted him with their supposed connections to the mafia, Whitfield hired bodyguards. They accompanied him to the NFR, where he again won the world championship. The following year, Whitfield set an aggregate record in the NFR. He scored a combined 84 points in the ten rounds. In the ninth round, Whitfield became the second of three men to break the single-run world record. Blair Burk's run lasted only 7 seconds, beating the previous 7.1 second record. Whitfield competed minutes later and finished in 6.9 seconds. His record lasted only another few minutes, before Jeff Chapman finished a tenth of a second faster. Whitfield won the World All-Around Cowboy Championship in 1999. He won the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo for the first time in 2000. In conjunction with the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, a three-day Olympic Command Performance Rodeo was hosted to showcase Western culture. Both the United States and Canada brought five competitors in each event. The winners would receive both prize money and medals. Whitfield was one of the United States representatives. In 2004, he was elected to the ProRodeo Hall of Fame. Whitfield won his eighth world championship in 2005 in tie-down roping. Whitfield won the Calgary Stampede in 2007. After suffering an injury during the 2007 season, Whitfield missed making the NFR for the first time in his career. He did not qualify for the NFR in 2009 and 2011. A young black Texas, Cory Solomon, joined the PRCA as a calf roper in 2009. Whitfield soon became Solomon's mentor. In 2011, Whitfield won the year-end tie-down roping championship for the semi-professional Cowboys Professional Rodeo Association (CPRA). As of 2013, Whitfield had earned more prize money in calf roping than any previous competitor. In July 2012, his combined earnings surpassed $3 million. Whitfield began cutting down on his touring schedule, preferring to spend more time at home, where he trains other athletes. Through June 2015, he had competed in only 25 rodeos, winning about $10,000. Although he wasn't high in the PRCA standings, his reputation was enough to get him invited to some of the major non-PRCA rodeos, including the Calgary Stampede. There, he doubled his yearly earnings. In 2015, a group of elite cowboys including Whitfield, disenchanted with the PRCA, formed the Elite Rodeo Athletes (ERA). This for-profit organization was collectively owned by its competitors. They planned to compete against each other at several rodeos around the country, culminating in a world championship at the end of their season. The PRCA promptly changed their bylaws to ban cowboys with financial interest in any other rodeo association, beginning with the 2016 season. ERA members would be disqualified from all PRCA rodeos, including the NFR. ERA shareholders could still compete at non- PRCA-sanctioned rodeos. At the 2016 Calgary Stampede, Whitfield finished in second place, earning $25,000. After the ERA shut down after its only competitive season, Whitfield did not to return to PRCA competition, and instead competed primarily in the semi-professional Cowboys Professional Rodeo Association (CPRA). Whitfield was invited to compete at the 2019 Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, which had once again become a PRCA rodeo after eight years of being unsanctioned. After his performances there, Whitfield officially retired from rodeo competition.

She also echoes the notion that Savageau's poems strongly embody a sense of place (134). Reception Mother/Land has been praised by Allison Hedge Coke and Craig Womack (Muscogee). ‚ÄúMother/Land is restoring the world through the retelling of patterns passed woman to woman like songs to lips. In this familial place, where one haggles over Memere‚Äôs house dress, combs her Mama‚Äôs hair as if brushing a bird‚Äôs wing, employs mother-of-pearl to fill the black hole of her absence leaving buxom hills bare of trees. From this childhood where one might wear a dress of fall grass, cut ankles on witchgrass, and peer into a refrigerator to delineate a hummingbird from a moth; in the land of mothers, grandmothers, and their later lineal offspring, we come to terms with crossroads and swallows, rivers and oceans, and they lead us back home from which we began‚Äîthe Motherland.‚Äù ‚ÄîAllison Hedge Coke ‚ÄúCheryl Savageau stares into stones of amber, opal, emerald, garnet, sapphire, amethyst, pearl, quartz, peridot, and onyx, recording every change of light and color they throw on old and new loves. She examines recurring characters and places from as many angled refractions as possible until one of the richest, fullest New England spiritual topographies ever written emerges. Readers who know Savageau‚Äôs earlier chronicling of those who sacralize and profane her homescape will be astonished at this poetic culmination of fully-drawn portraits. I fell, hard, for the boy under the drain pipe, the whale‚Äôs word for world, the slapping tails of children, the hummingbird in the refrigerator, the cathechist with knife in her teeth, the wife spraying breast milk at the breakfast table, the woodchuck too busy for crucifixions, the piano baptized in molasses, the parakeet‚Äôs family jewels, the leathered and lathered Doc Martened butch leading her woman around the dance floor, the lightning that converses with fireflies, and everyone, everything that busts out of the gamebag and into Cheryl Savageau‚Äôs poetry. This may be one of the best literary depictions of New England to date, certainly the finest one to challenge whatever is new and English about the place.‚Äù ‚ÄîCraig S.

Listed as a cultural heritage, it is located in Altenberg, now part of Odenthal in the Rheinisch-Bergischer Kreis, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Until 1511, the church was the burial site of counts and dukes of Berg and the dukes of J√ºlich-Berg. Badly damaged after the monastery was dissolved in 1803 due to the secularisation of Germany, the church was rebuilt with support from Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia, who decreed in 1857 that it was to serve as a parish church simultaneously for a Catholic and a Protestant parish. The German name has sometimes been translated to English as Altenberg Cathedral, but it was never a cathedral, a bishop's seat.  History  The Counts of Berg settled in the area east of Cologne, along the Dh√ºnn river. Cistercians arrived from Morimond in their land, now Bergisches Land, in 1133. They founded Altenburg Abbey on the river, with a first church consecrated in 1160. The archbishop of Cologne, Konrad von Hochstaden, laid in 1259 the foundation of a larger church \\"St. Mari√§ Himmelfahrt\\" (Assumption of Mary). The choir of the new church, in Gothic style, was consecrated in 1276. The choir's floor plan is similar to that of the Cologne Cathedral, and the choir is similar to the destroyed choir of Royaumont, probably because the builders of Altenburg were familiar with that site. The church was built over 140 years and served as the abbey church for centuries. During the secularisation of Germany, the monastery was dissolved in 1803. The buildings were used for a chemical plant. In 1815, a fire destroyed much of the buildings. Count F√ºrstenberg von Stammheim bought the ruins in 1833 and turned them over to the Prussian king, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, who was fond of medieval history. The king supported the rebuilding of the Altenberger Dom, and also the completion of the Cologne Cathedral. He suggested already in the 1830s that the Altenberger Dom should be used by both Catholics and Protestants as a simultaneum, and finalized the idea in a royal decree of 1856.  Windows  The windows are predominantly in shades of grey (Grisaille), with some coloured windows, especially the large window in the west facade.

From May to October, sacred music and vespers take place regularly at 11:45 a.m. The organ was built in 1980 by Klais Orgelbau, Bonn, an instrument of 6300 pipes, 88 stops, four manuals and pedal, with the last pedal stops added from 2007. The organ has been used for concerts and recordings.

Henderson Luelling (as he more consistently spelled his surname, following his father's practice) and his wife Elizabeth were among the first settlers in the Quaker community of Salem in 1837. They moved here from Henry County, Indiana, and Henderson moved his fruit tree nursery with him. This was Iowa's first commercial nursery. with Henderson built this two-story stone house with Greek Revival details in 1843. The Lewellings were abolitionists associated with the Society of Anti-Slavery Friends, and his home is thought to have been a stop on the Underground Railroad. The family left Salem for Oregon in 1847, taking the nursery with them. The Lewelling's continued to own the house after they left Salem, and Nelson Gibbs, the local Justice of the Peace, used it for his office. In 1848 he held a hearing in the house concerning the slaves of Ruel Daggs from Clark County, Missouri who had escaped to Salem. Because of the size of the crowd, the hearing was moved to the Anti-Slavery Quaker Meetinghouse (no longer extant) across the street. Gibbs determined he had no jurisdiction in the case. It led to the federal court case Ruel Daggs vs. Elihu Frazier et al (1850), which was heard in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa in Burlington. The case, which Daggs won, was one of the last major cases using the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, and the only one held west of the Mississippi River. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It is noteworthy for its association with both Lewelling's nursery and the Daggs' case. It has been converted into a museum.

The Sheriff Appeal Court also hears appeals in civil cases from the sheriff courts, including the Sheriff Personal Injury Court. The Sheriff Appeal Court was established for criminal appeals on 22 September 2015, as part of Lord Gill‚Äôs Scottish Civil Courts Reforms, to deal with criminal appeals. The bench, there is no jury, generally comprises two or three appeal sheriffs depending on the type of appeal to be considered. Bail hearings are presided over by a single appeal sheriff. The criminal court sits in the courthouse at Lawnmarket, Edinburgh. The court's jurisdiction was extended to civil appeals on 1 September 2016, before that date civil appeals were heard either by the sheriff principal for each sheriffdom or by the Inner House of Court of Session. History =Scottish Civil Courts Review= The Sheriff Appeal Court's foundation was one of the results of, then Lord Justice Clerk, Lord Gill's Scottish Civil Courts Review (published in 2009), which identified several ways in which civil justice could be expedited through improving access to justice, reducing costs for parties litigant, and reducing the time to conclusion of cases. Lord Gill was critical of the civil justice system in place at the time, describing it as \\"a Victorian model that had survived by means of periodic piecemeal reforms\\", and concluding that, \\"It is failing the litigant and it is failing society.\\" =Civil appeals= Lord Gill identified that of civil appeals to the Inner House came from the sheriff courts, and that of appeals from sheriff courts came direct (bypassing the sheriffs principal.) Most of these appeals did not raise complex questions of law and thus could be dealt with by a new national court. So he recommended the creation of the Sheriff Appeal Court to deal with these appeals. He did propose that, with leave, further appeals could be made to the Inner House, and this would allow for complex or important questions of law to be dealt with by the Senators of the College of Justice in the Supreme Courts of Scotland. Lord Gill's proposal was to extended the ability to apply for leave to appeal to small claims actions, where no such ability had existed before. The Scottish Government, in 2010, accepted the analysis by Lord Gill there were problems facing the civil courts of Scotland. The Scottish Government recognised that costs were rising, there were excessive delays, and too many rescheduled hearings. They agreed that the courts system should be able to manage at which level a case was heard. In Scotland it had been up to the pursuer to choose whether to initiate a case in either the sheriff courts or the Court of Session, as they both shared concurrent jurisdiction for all civil cases with a value greater than . The Scottish Government proposed increasing this limit to , but the final limit was set at by Section 39 of the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014. They also agreed with the establishment of the Sheriff Appeal Court to handle civil appeals from the sheriff courts of Scotland. =Criminal appeals= Lord Gill recommended that appeals against conviction and sentence from the justice of the peace and sheriff courts in summary procedure should be remitted to the Sheriff Appeal Court, rather than, as previously, the High Court of Justiciary. Lord Gill also recommended that judgments of the court in criminal appeals should be binding on sheriffs throughout Scotland, as Lord Gill recommended: The expectation was that this would expedite appeals from summary proceedings in the sheriff and justice of the peace courts. The Scottish Government accepted Lord Gill's recommendation on criminal appeals, and asserted that would lead to the more coherent and consistent body of case law that Lord Gill sought. The Scottish Government proposed that the Sheriff Appeal Court would be composed of the 6 sheriffs principal of Scotland, plus six full-time Appeal Sheriffs. The view taken by the Scottish Government was that all appeals would be centrally managed, with the sheriffs principal able to hear appeals from any sheriffdom (and not just from their own). =Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014= The Scottish Government took the reforms to the Scottish Parliament in the Courts Reform (Scotland) Bill on 6 February 2014, and the Bill (as amended) received Royal Assent on 6 May 2015 becoming the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014. It was through the amendments process that the limit for civil actions in the exclusive jurisdiction of the sheriff courts was reduced to The Justice Committee considered the proposals in the Courts Reform (Scotland) Bill and published a report on 9 May 2014. In that report the Committee agreed with the creation of a Sheriff Appeal Court to hear both civil appeals and appeals for summary proceedings in the justice of the peace and sheriff courts. They did stipulate that appeals should be heard in the sheriffdom from which the case originates. The Committee also noted support for the establishment for the Sheriff Appeal Court from the Scottish Legal Aid Board, Compass Chambers, Justice Scotland, the Law Society of Scotland, and Citizens Advice Scotland. However, the Faculty of Advocates rejected both the creation of the Sheriff Appeal Court and the increase in the limit for exclusive jurisdiction of the sheriff courts for civil cases. The Faculty asserted that the Court of Session was already effective in dealing with civil cases, would remove choice for the litigant, and would deny them the right to appoint counsel (an advocate.) The Faculty's concerns were also related to the Sheriff Personal Injury Court. As there was an existing common law test that required a sheriff court to sanction the use of counsel in a case. The Faculty was also concerned that removing low-value cases from the Court of Session would deny advocates who are early in their career the opportunity develop their litigation skills, and thus make it harder for them to be ready to handle high-value or complex cases. Thus, they concluded the reforms could harm the long term viability of the legal profession in Scotland. As it was, the Scottish Parliament passed the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014 which, in Section 108, requires any sheriff court (including the Sheriff Appeal Court) to grant sanction for the use of counsel where the court considers that the case is likely to be difficult or complex, or important or of requisite value. At the same time no party should be allowed an advantage over an other through the use of an advocate. =Commencement= On 22 September 2015, the Sheriff Appeal Court was established to deal with criminal appeals. On 1 January 2016, Scottish Ministers by Scottish Statutory Instrument commenced the provisions of the Court Reform (Scotland) Act 2014 to extended civil appeals to the Sheriff Appeal Court. Remit and jurisdiction =Criminal jurisdiction= The Sheriff Appeal Court has exclusive jurisdiction for all appeals in summary criminal proceedings and appeals relating to bail decisions, in both summary and solemn proceedings, from the sheriff courts and justice of the peace courts. Decisions of the Sheriff Appeal Court may only be appealed to the High Court of Justiciary with the permission of the Sheriff Appeal Court or the High Court. = Civil jurisdiction = The Sheriff Appeal Court has exclusive jurisdiction for all appeals in civil proceedings at first instance in the sheriff courts of Scotland, replacing the prior appeal to the sheriffs principal of the six sheriffdoms of Scotland, and the automatic right of appeal to the Inner House of the Court of Session. A bench of three Appeal Sheriffs sits to hear appeals on civil cases raised under ordinary cause, with summary cause, small claims, and procedural business decided by a single Appeal Sheriff. Cases can only be appealed to the Inner House with the permission of either the Sheriff Appeal Court or the Court of Session. All judgments of the Sheriff Appeal Court in civil cases establish binding precedent on all sheriffs and in all sheriffdoms throughout Scotland. The civil jurisdiction of the Sheriff Appeal Court was established on 1 January 2016. With civil appeals regulated by Act of Sederunt (Sheriff Appeal Court Rules) 2015, an Act of Sederunt made by the Court of Session on 21 October 2015, and which had come into force by 1 January 2016. =Guideline and binding judgments= Decisions made by the Sheriff Appeal Court in civil appeals are binding on all sheriffs throughout Scotland, and decisions are also binding on the Sheriff Appeal Court itself. The Sheriff Appeal Court can only overturn a prior precedent by convening a larger bench of Appeal Sheriffs than the bench that set the precedent. Previously, civil appeals to a sheriff principal were only binding on the sheriffs in the sheriffdom for which the sheriff principal was responsible. Such binding judgments are established by Section 48 of the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014, so that when the Sheriff Appeal Court makes a decision on a question of law it is binding in every sheriffdom for every sheriff court and every justice of the peace court. Such precedent is also binding on solemn proceeding where a sheriff sits with a jury. The Sheriff Appeal Court can issue guideline judgments for criminal proceedings, where the Appeal Sheriffs give guidance on how sentencing should be handled in similar cases. Such judgments require the Scottish Sentencing Council to prepare or modify sentencing guidelines. The power for the Sheriff Appeal Court to issue guideline judgments is granted by Section 48 of the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014. =Remitting and referring cases to Supreme Courts= The Sheriff Appeal Court can remit (transfer) a case to the Court of Session under Section 112 of the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014, which allows for the Inner House to deal with complex or novel questions of law. The case can be remitted at the request of either party to a case. The Sheriff Appeal Court can refer questions of law to the High Court of Justiciary under Section 120 of the 2014 Act. The referral can be granted either at the request of either party litigant, or on the Court's own initiative. The High Court is then able to answer the question of law, and to further direct the Sheriff Appeal Court on how to deal with the appeal.  Section 112 civil remittance  The Sheriff Appeal Court can remit an appeal to the Inner House under Section 112 of the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014 provided an application is made by a party to the case and,Once remitted the case is treated as though the appeal began with the Court of Session. An application to remit an appeal to the Inner House of the Court of Session was rejected by the Sheriff Appeal Court, as advised by Lord Drummond Young sitting as a Lord Ordinary, in the case of First Time Limited vs Alexander Fraser (Liquidator of Denmore Investments Limited). Sheriff Principal Murrary stated:The Appeal Sheriffs believe that the appellants arguments would potentially allow for the case to be resolved without proof, and that no significant question of law was at stake, nor was there any compelling public interest. Section 120 criminal referral The Sheriff Appeal Court can refer a point of law to the High Court of Justiciary:Unlike a remittance of a case to the Court of Session, the Sheriff Appeal Court can refer a point of law on its own initiative under Section 120 Paragraph (2)(b). The High Court is empowered by this section to direct further the procedure or judgment of the appeal. =Rules of the Court= The rules for the Sheriff Appeals Court are contained in Chapter 19 of the Criminal Procedures Rules 1996 (for criminal appeals) and the Sheriff Appeal Court Rules (Civil) (for civil appeals). The rules for criminal appeals were instituted by the High Court of Justiciary by Act of Adjournal which came into force on 22 September 2015, and the civil rules were instituted by the Court of Session through Act of Sederunt that came into force on 1 January 2016. Judges and office holders =Appeal sheriffs= The judges of the Sheriff Appeal Court are known as appeal sheriffs, with all sheriffs principal ex officio being appeal sheriffs. To be eligible for appointment as an appeal sheriff a person must have served at least five years as a sheriff. Appeal sheriffs also hear appeals in civil cases that previously went to the sheriff principal. =President and Vice-President= The President of the Court is Sheriff Principal Mhairi Stephen, QC, whose sheriffdom is Lothian and Borders, and the Vice President of the Court is Sheriff Principal Ian Abercrombie, QC, who sheriffdom is South Strathclyde, Dumfries and Galloway. There are a further 15 appeal sheriffs, including all of the other serving sheriffs principal. =Clerk to the Court= The administration of the court is the responsibility of the Clerk of the Sheriff Appeal Court, who is assisted by a Deputy Clerk ‚Äì Criminal and a Deputy Clerk ‚Äì Civil. The clerk has significant responsibility for arranging hearings of the court, handling documents from litigants, and preparing copies for any party to the case. =Current judges= The current appeals sheriffs are: { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align: left;\\" + Sheriffs principal and appeal sheriffs - !

He produced the first practical steam fire engine that was successfully used as a routine part of a city's fire department equipment.  Early life  Latta was born on a farm just outside the city limits of Chillicothe, Ohio, on July 11, 1821. He was the youngest of six children and went by the nickname \\"Moses\\". When five years old his father, John Latta, was killed in an accident. This left his mother, Rebecca Latta, a penniless widow. Latta started schooling and attended a country school in Ohio until he was thirteen years old. He was forced to quit school to help support his mother and brothers and worked at a cotton factory woolen mill for seventy-five cents per week. Three years later he worked at a shipyard, starting at three dollars per week. Three years later he then went to work at a brass foundry. He worked much with machinery and became a mechanic. His mother then moved the family to Cincinnati in the early 1840s for better financial opportunities.  Mid life and career  Latta's lathe and planing machine Latta's first jobs were for David Bradford Woolen Mills, Samuel Cummings' brass foundry, and William Bylad's machine shop. Latta met Anthony Harkness, owner of a foundry and machine shop in Cincinnati, while on a business trip to Washington, D. C. in 1841. He explained to Harkness his mechanical ability and about his invention for a machine that would make parts for steamboat paddle wheels. He made such an impression on Harkness that he was offered a job as a superintendent of Harkness's foundry. His first assignment was that of designing a huge lathe and planing machine for Harkness. The inventor George Escol Sellers believed the planing machine was a mechanical masterpiece. Latta first became a foreman at the Harkness machine shop and later became an engineer. In 1845 he directed the construction of the first railroad locomotive built west of the Alleghany Mountains. He was the train engineer that made the trial round trip from Cincinnati to Columbus, Ohio. Latta designed in 1846 an unusual train locomotive for the Boston and Maine Railroad. It had an additional set of cylinders built under the water tank which took the steam exhaust back forward through specially designed pipes that allowed the steam energy to be used again.  Family  Latta married Elizabeth Ann Pawson October 21, 1847. They had two children who grew to adulthood, G. Taylor and Luella M. Latta.  Uncle Joe Ross and Citizen's Gift steam fire engines  Uncle Joe Ross Citizen's Gift Latta's greatest inventions were those related to steam fire engines. He made his first one in 1852 and it was purchased by the City of Cincinnati to incorporate as part of its fire department equipment. His first manufactured steam fire engines could be drawn by both men and horses. In 1855 he was granted a patent on a self- propelled steam engine. It consisted of three steel wheels and designed like a tricycle. The front wheel was for steering and the back wheels not only propelled the machine down the streets, but powered the pumps to push the water through the hoses. The boiler was of two square chambers, one within the other. The space between them contained water that was heated to steam by the inner chamber firebox. Latta invented the first successful steam fire engine in the world that was practical and used by a city fire department as part of their equipment. The steam fire engine was named Uncle Joe Ross for Joseph Ross, after the councilman that promoted it. Latta designed his steam fire engine in 1852. The steam fire engine was put into full service at the Cincinnati fire department on January 1, 1853, and used as a regular part of their equipment for putting out fires. The Cincinnati volunteer fire department was reorganized in April 1853, because of Latta's practical steam fire engine that they were using successfully to put out fires. The Cincinnati fire department officially became the first paid company of firemen. The city ordered another of Latta's practical steam fire engines in 1854 and it was named Citizen's Gift, since the money to purchase it came from the citizens of Cincinnati. Boston was the next to adopt Latta's practical steam fire engine, followed by New York City, and then other cities. The steam fire engine Uncle Joe Ross was demonstrated in a test in 1855 when it exploded. This was the first steam fire engine explosion. It injured several people and killed the operating engineer. The damaged fire engine was replaced by the Citizen's Gift and the A.B.Latta fire engines, that the citizens of Cincinnati purchased from Latta for $9,500 each and were delivered before the end of the year.  Later life and death  Latta invented several improvements to steam locomotives and fire engines that he patented between 1847 and his death. He formed the company Buckeye Works in 1846 with his brothers Edmundson and Finlay. He had built 30 steam locomotive engines by 1860. Latta's last design was of a \\"steam dummy\\" for the street railway in the city of Cincinnati. It consisted of his 6-horsepower portable engine that was built into a street railway car and tested in March 1860. Latta retired in 1862 and died in Ludlow, Kentucky, in 1865.  Awards  Latta invented a series of improvements in railroad applications, but only a few of his patented inventions were actually used in the industry. He received a gold medal for fire engine improvements at the Ohio Mechanics Institute Fair in 1854.

Methodology  The citations are stored in Crossref and are made available through the Crossref REST API. They are also available from the OpenCitations Corpus, a database that harvests citation data from Crossref and other sources. The data are considered by those involved in the Initiative to be in the public domain, and so a CC0 licence is used. The stated benefits of this approach are: * discoverability of published content * the building of new services * creation of a public citation graph to explore connections between knowledge fields.  Launch  The initiative was established in response to a paper on citations in Wikidata, Citations needed for the sum of all human knowledge: Wikidata as the missing link between scholarly publishing and linked open data, given by Dario Taraborelli, head of research at the Wikimedia Foundation, at the eighth Conference on Open Access Scholarly Publishing, in September 2016. At that time, only 1% of papers in Crossref had citations metadata that were freely available. By the time of the public launch, on 6 April 2017, that had risen to 40% as a result of setting up the initiative. The founding partners were: * OpenCitations * Wikimedia Foundation * PLOS * eLife * DataCite * The Centre for Culture and Technology at Curtin University At the time of launch, 64 organisations, including the Wellcome Trust, the Bill And Melinda Gates Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, had endorsed the project and as of May, 2017, Sloan Foundation confirmed it would be providing funding. 29 of these organisations were publishers who had agreed to share their citation metadata openly. These include Springer Nature, Taylor & Francis, and Wiley. On 11 July 2017, the Initiative announced that a further sixteen publishers had signed up. On 8 August 2017, the Initiative released on open letter to stakeholders. The same month, the British Library became a member organisation.  Rejection by Elsevier  Elsevier, who contribute 30% of the citation metadata in Crossref, did not join the initiative.

He is best known for his cartoons entitled The Americanese Wall ‚Äì As Congressman Burnett would build it and It‚Äôs Going To Be Just Turned Around, both dealing with immigration. Early and personal life Evans was born in Columbus, Ohio, to Oscar R. (Ben) and Mary F. Evans and was the oldest of four children. His father was a ticket agent for a railroad company, and Ray attended public schools in Columbus. He attended Ohio State University, where he was a member of Sigma Pi fraternity. He and W. M. Kiplinger recruited Dudley Fisher to join the fraternity. He was also the illustrator for the 1909 edition of the MakiO yearbook. After graduating in 1910, he became an advertising artist for The Columbus Dispatch. In 1911 he was able to get Fisher an interview with editor Arthur Johnson Sr to begin his career. He then worked for part of 1912 with The Dayton Daily News. Evans married Helen Holter on October 11, 1911. They had two children before 1920, Ray Jr. and Dorothy. Their third child, a daughter named Patricia, was born in the 1920s. He was a member of the Methodist church. Career =Baltimore= Evans moved to Baltimore, where he became a political cartoonist for The Baltimore American around 1913 and stayed there through 1922. From 1920 to 1922 he was also a staff artist for the Baltimore News. During his time in Baltimore, he began to make a name for himself, and his works were published in magazines such as The Literary Digest, Judge, The Outlook, Life, and Puck. He taught cartooning at the Maryland Institute College of Art. He was a member of the Charcoal Club of Baltimore, the School Art League, and the National Press Club of Washington. He also developed his ability to write cleverly in connection with his news and sketches. His book Club Men of Maryland in Caricature was published in 1915. =Columbus= In 1922 Evans moved back to Columbus and began working at The Dispatch again as an artist. While at The Dispatch he was again working with Dudley Fisher and Billy Ireland, and later Milton Caniff. Ireland was well known by that time and ran several strips, one of which was an occasional sketch called Flowers for the Living, which praised a local person for his or her kindness and generosity. While Ireland was on his vacation in 1923, Evans filled in for him and sketched his own Flowers for the Living that recognized Ireland. In 1927 Ireland did a series of cartoons on fraternities at Ohio State, with Evans and Fisher appearing in the one on Sigma Pi which ran in June of that year. In 1933 Columbus was recognized for its amount of cartoonists by Osman C. Hooper in his book on Ohio journalism. Evans, Fisher, and Ireland were all mentioned by name. Like most political cartoonists of the 1930s, Evans commented on the New Deal and President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During World War II Evans continued working at The Dispatch but also produced propaganda material for the U.S. government and the Red Cross. By the late 1940s Evans had become the chief cartoonist for The Dispatch and had hired his son, Ray Evans Jr, to work with him. Evans died on January 18, 1954, at his home in Columbus. Since death Some of Evans's work was displayed at the Ohio Cartoonists: A Bicentennial Celebration exhibition during the summer and early fall of 2003 at Ohio State University.

The complex will include three residential towers with 1,132 units and of park, along with of amenity space.Garfield, Leanna (April 6, 2017) \\"11 billion- dollar mega-projects that will transform New York City by 2035\\". Business Insider. The residences range in size from one to five bedrooms. The project, which features designs by Rafael Vi√±oly, Kohn Pedersen Fox, and Richard Meier, is scheduled to be completed in 2019.  History  =Riverside Center= The site was originally part of the Riverside South development and would be the last phase, known as Riverside Center. Extell Development Company originally planned to build 2,500 residential and condo units, of retail and a cinema, a K-5 school for 750 students, a 250-room hotel, 3.2 acres of publicly accessible open space, and 1,500 parking spaces. Despite public opposition, the plan was unanimously approved by the New York City Council in December 2010. The plan, which involved design by Christian de Portzamparc, were never realized and the company sold the land to GID for $676 million in 2015. =Waterline Square= In November 2016, GID received $1.243 billion in construction financing from a consortium of lenders including Wells Fargo, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase and the National Bank of Abu Dhabi. The financing represented one of the largest construction loans ever in New York City and came at a time when financing for condominium projects had been difficult to obtain. By November 2016, most of the site's foundations were complete. As of April 2017, the buildings on the site began rising above street level. The buildings topped out by the end of 2017. In June 2017, Cipriani S.A. signed a lease, with plans to open a food market with several restaurants and stalls. Sales for the condominiums began in June 2017, with a projected sellout of $1.15 billion and an average price of $4.4 million. The project was named New York City's fastest-selling condominium development in February 2018 by Architectural Digest, having sold 53 units worth over $200 million in just six months. Applications for the affordable housing units opened in October 2018 and were available until December 2018. Architecture and design In total the project offers 1,132 units, split between 226 affordable apartments, 263 condominiums, and 643 market-rate apartments. In each building, the condominiums begin at the 20th floor and the rental units occupy the lower floors. Each building features separate entrances for the condo and rental sections. All the units feature high-end finishes and appliances from brands like Gaggenau Hausger√§te, Valli & Valli, and Dornbracht.One Waterline Square Fact Sheet All Waterline Square buildings are connected to the Waterline Club, a amenity center in the space between the three buildings. Amenities include a tennis court, lap pool, spa, basketball court, indoor soccer field, squash court, a rock climbing wall, skate park and golf simulator.Waterline Square Amenities Additionally, each individual building contains amenities centers with facilities such as outdoor decks, demonstration kitchens, dining rooms, and lounges. Atop the amenities center sits a 2.6 acre park designed by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects, dubbed Waterline Square Park. The park will feature tree-lined groves, open grass areas, walking paths, a playground, fountains, and other water features. The developers took the unusual step of hiring a different architect, as well as a different interior designer, for each building. James Linsley, president of GID, described the buildings as \\"almost like cousins...They communicate with each other architecturally.\\" =One Waterline Square= One Waterline Square contains 272 units, split between 56 condos and 216 rentals. The interiors of the units were designed by Champalimaud Design in either white or natural finishes. The building's defining feature is a 12-story, sail-shaped facade extension above the building's entrance in the northeast corner.One Waterline Square The building's main facade is composed of clear reflective glass designed to interact with the Hudson River. However, the west facade is composed of gray brick to pay tribute to the historic brick-clad IRT Powerhouse adjacent to the building. The same side of the building features a Porte-coch√®re entrance from West 59th Street for condominium owners. =Two Waterline Square= The largest building, Two Waterline Square contains 160 condos and 216 rental apartments, totaling 646 units. The interiors of the units were designed by Yabu Pushelberg. The building features several broken-up masses designed to minimize the impact of the large building.Two Waterline Square The largest section of the building faces west towards the Hudson River to maximize views and light. =Three Waterline Square= The smallest building, Three Waterline Square contains just 47 condos and 167 rentals for a total of 244 units. The interiors of the units were designed by Groves & Co with marble and wood to reflect a contemporary theme. The building has a ‚Äúnetted‚Äù fa√ßade with uneven banding that provides texture. Reception Carter Horsley, writing in City Realty, described the project as three \\"rather ungainly and completely dissimillar\\" towers. Ondel Hylton, also writing for City Realty, called the buildings' architecture \\"angular and somewhat tortured deconstructivist forms.\\" Horsley described Three Waterline Square as \\"not pristine but at least dramatically interesting with its bold fa√ßades\\" and \\"the most attractive\\" of the three buildings.

It was first formed in the summer of 1941 and destroyed in the Bryansk pocket in the fall of 1941. The division was reformed in late December, and served throughout the war before being disbanded in 1946.  History  = First formation = 50th Army, shown encircled to the north of Bryansk. The 280th began forming on 2 July 1941 near Tula in the Moscow Military District. Its basic order of battle included the 1031st, 1033rd, and 1035th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 840th Artillery Regiment and 583rd Sapper Battalion. After spending a month forming near Moscow, the division was assigned to the 24th Army of the Reserve Front on 5 August. Its headquarters was located at Slobodka, southeast of Smolensk. The division was transferred to the newly formed 50th Army of the Bryansk Front on 15 August. At the end of September, the division was trapped in the Bryansk pocket at the beginning of Operation Typhoon, the German assault on Moscow. Its headquarters was overrun and its commander, Sergei Danilov, captured. On 13 October elements of the 280th, fighting alongside remnants of the 148th Rifle Division and the 282nd Rifle Division, opened a 500-meter gap in the German encirclement west of Navlya. A handful of men escaped, but the bulk of the division was destroyed in the pocket and it was officially disbanded on 18 October. = Second formation = A Soviet machine gun crew during the Battle of Kursk. The second formation of the 280th began on 25 December near Stalingrad in the North Caucasus Military District. It used the same basic order of battle as the first formation, but added the 368th Anti-Tank Battalion. The division remained near Stalingrad until its March 1942 transfer to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. In April the incomplete 280th Rifle Division transferred to the Bryansk Front reserve and the next month was assigned to the 48th Army. During June and July, the division received reinforcements from the Moscow Military District's 14th Reserve Rifle Brigade. In January 1943, the 280th was moved to the 13th Army, which was transferred to the Central Front in March. By 1 April it had become part of the 28th Rifle Corps, and later that month the division with its corps was moved to the 70th Army. The 280th fought in the Battle of Kursk in July to the north west of Kursk. It was transferred to the 60th Army's 77th Rifle Corps during the battle. On 15 September 1943, it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its \\"exemplary fulfillment of command tasks...and valor and courage\\". In October, the army was transferred to the 1st Ukrainian Front, with which the 280th spent the rest of the war. As part of the 18th Guards Rifle Corps, the division transferred to the 1st Guards Army in March 1944. On 27 July the division returned to the 13th Army, with which it remained for the rest of the war. Initially assigned to the army's 47th Rifle Corps, the 280th transferred to the 24th Rifle Corps in September. By December it had become part of the 27th Rifle Corps. During the last weeks of the war the division moved back to the 24th Rifle Corps.

During his lifetime, he was recognized as having \\"brought together with the camera the most complete account of the passing west that has ever been made.\\" Early life Smith was born in Honey Grove, Texas, to Albert Alexander Smith and Nancy Erwin Smith White. Smith's father died of pneumonia when the boy was not yet four years old, and when his mother remarried in 1894, she relocated the family to Bonham, Texas, where Smith would spend his childhood years. While very young, Smith exhibited an intense artistic sensibility: \\"I developed a strong desire to sketch and create something at an early age,\\" he recalled. \\"I was everlastingly sketching or modeling in clay.\\" Smith's early creative tendency was paralleled by a second passion, that of being a cowboy. While Bonham and its surroundings were primarily a farming region during Smith's lifetime, the area had also been home to legendary cattlemen like John Chisum, and around town the young boy dressed to look like Bonham's forebears, wearing what one friend later recalled as a \\"nine-year-old boy's terrific adaptation of what his vivid imagination tells him cowboys wear.\\" When Smith was four years old, the Eleventh United States Census of 1890 declared the American frontier closed, prompting historian Frederick Jackson Turner to write his famous Frontier Thesis, in which he wrote that \\"Now, four centuries from the discovery of America, at the end of a hundred years of life under the Constitution, the frontier has gone, and with its going has closed the first period of American history.\\" As a teenager, Smith realized that the cowboys who worked the open range were, like the frontier itself, receding into the past. But from his experience as an apprentice cowhand during these years, he knew of a few isolated West Texas locales where vast ranches yet survived, barbed wire and the railroads were still scarce, and cowboys still worked the open range. Moved by nostalgia, he determined to capture them in their elements before it was too late. \\"My only means now to set them before my eyes and the public's once more is to place them on canvas with paint and brush,\\" Smith resolved. But his unstudied artistic skills as a painter and sculptor compelled him to opt for a more immediate tool of record: the camera. Career Smith is purported to have acquired his first camera in 1898 at the age of twelve, and by the age of fifteen he had begun carrying it with him on his visits to Texas ranches. Following a visit to the 1904 World's Fair in Saint Louis, he decided to pursue formal art study with the intent to become a painter and sculptor; he left for Chicago that year to study with Lorado Taft (1860-1936) at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1908 he headed east to Boston, where he continued his study with Bela Lyon Pratt (1867-1917) at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. But Smith spent his summers photographing on ranches throughout West Texas and parts of New Mexico and Arizona, and by 1911 he had turned his full artistic attention onto photography and returned to Texas to practice in that medium exclusively. His goal was \\"to do with his photography what Charles M. Russell did with his painting: to maintain a sense of documentary realism by being truthful to the world with work created in an artistically pleasing way.\\" \\"He wanted to illustrate the entire cowboy culture,\\" an article in 2008 asserted, \\"to clarify all the varied responsibilities and define the characteristic techniques of managing cattle, as well as to showcase the unique talents of the legendary men and horses.\\" Soon after Smith had begun his studies in Boston in 1907, he discovered the Pinkham & Smith Company, which sold cameras and photographic goods. Within a few weeks, company representatives there had become acquainted with Smith's work and arranged an exhibition of forty of his prints in their street-display windows on Boylston Street. Smith's photographic career was significantly advanced when George Patullo, a features writer for the Boston Herald, saw the works, contacted Smith at his boarding house, and made him the subject of an article: \\"From Bronco Buster to Boston Art Student,\\" which appeared on the front page of the paper's magazine section on January 12, 1908. The article marked the beginning of a friendship and working relationship between Smith the photographer and Patullo the writer, a partnership that resulted in numerous illustrated articles published in popular magazines from 1908 to 1911, when they collaborated for the final time on two Saturday Evening Post articles on the Texas horse and mule business. Over the course of his relatively brief career making photographs, Smith's principal camera was an Eastman screen-focus Kodak fitted with a Goerz lens with a volute shutter. As both a cowhand and photographer, he rode with some of the largest outfits in the West, ranches like the Shoe Box, JA, Frying Pan, Matador, and LS, which with their vast sizes still approximated what the open range had been like. In 1914 he returned to Texas to begin ranching on his own, but by 1917 he was bankrupt; his artistic life faded once his range-riding days were over, and he spent his remaining years at his home outside Bonham. Death and legacy In July 1947 Smith was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, which claimed his life two months later at the age of sixty-one. The photographer's will named his sister, Mary Alice Pettis (1906 ‚Äì 1986), as beneficiary and executor of his estate. In 1949, Pettis deposited 1,800 of the photographer's negatives with the Library of Congress but retained several hundred images related to home and family. Upon her death, Pettis bequeathed Smith's entire body of work, including the inventory on loan to the Library of Congress, to the Amon Carter Museum of American Art in Fort Worth, Texas. The collection comprises over 2,000 negatives and more than 700 vintage prints, as well as Smith's personal papers and library. Today, Smith is counted among the most important photographers of cowboy life and the finest of his kind to have worked in Texas.

Bearing similarities to previous related titles such as NBA Jam and NBA Street, NBA Playgrounds is an arcade-style basketball game officially licensed by the National Basketball Association.  Gameplay  NBA Playgrounds includes a roster of both active and former NBA stars. Both local and online multiplayer modes are included in the game, although local mode requires an internet connection to function on PS4. Players fill up a roster of players by playing different modes to earn packs. In Tournament Mode, players play four games with challenges with each iteration. Once the tournament is completed, players unlock a court and a gold pack. There is an online mode and exhibition, where players can play to upgrade themselves to bronze, silver, and gold. Players can also get a pack for leveling up both their offline level and their online level. If a player wanted to simply have all of the players right away, you could pay for the game's complete roster.  Release  Online features were not ready at launch day for the Nintendo Switch version due to technical issues, with a promise from the developer who said it would be ready in a few days. Despite this, Nintendo Switch online services were still not operating two weeks past the launch date. Saber Interactive, developers of the game, announced on July 1 that players who purchased the game before the implementation of online service would receive a copy of Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn. Online features arrived on the Nintendo Switch with the next update in the following month along with extra content. Additional free content was added later in the summer. On October 4, 2017, Saber Interactive released the game's first DLC pack, titled \\"Hot 'N Frosty.\\" The DLC introduces three new courts with their own tournament and single- player mode. On January 4, 2018, Saber Interactive launched NBA Playgrounds: Enhanced Edition for the Nintendo Switch, superseding the original launch version on the Nintendo eShop. The Enhanced Edition included all previous game updates, 100 additional NBA players, and a three-point shooting mode. Additionally, the Enhanced Edition includes various technical fixes. Because of this, the Enhanced Edition is a separate download rather than a patch for the launch version. Players who purchased the launch version can download the Enhanced Edition for free and can transfer their save files to it before deleting the old version. Saber Interactive celebrated the launch of the Enhanced Edition with a 50% sale.  Reception  NBA Playgrounds received a largely mixed critical reception, earning a 6/10 from GameSpot and a 7.4/10 from IGN. Nintendo Life gave the title a 7/10, praising the online and local multiplayer gameplay, but criticized the slow pace of the single-player mode and poor odds of card packs. They recommended the game only for the Nintendo Switch as it is the only basketball title available for the platform at the time. By July 2017, the game sold 500,000 units across all platforms. It was nominated for \\"Game, Original Sports\\" at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards.  Sequel  A sequel, NBA 2K Playgrounds 2, which was to be published by 2K Sports, was announced in July 2018.https://www.gamespot.com/articles/not-content-with-nba-2ks- domination-2k-will-now-pu/1100-6460698/ In May 2018, NBA Playgrounds 2 was delayed past its original release date of May 22, 2018.

Founded in 2016, Oncocare offers radiation treatment, chemotherapy and treatment support, and has a specialist cancer retail pharmacy. Its equipment includes the only digital linear accelerator in Zimbabwe. Oncocare is the only private medical institution in the country exclusively treating cancer. Background and history For years, Zimbabwe had been grappling with the shortage of cancer drugs and cancer specialists. It also lacked adequate information on the disease and a cancer policy to guide medical practitioners. The state-run hospitals in Harare and Bulawayo had provided services to cancer patients, but could not afford modern equipment and practices. The national healthcare budget of Zimbabwe is permanently strained because 15% of adult population have HIV. Oncocare Cancer Treatment Centre was opened in the Newlands suburb of Harare in August 2016. The initial investment was $10 million. Oncocare was the first privately run advanced cancer treatment and screening facility in Zimbabwe. Due to high costs related to cancer treatment, many Zimbabweans had been flying out of the country for treatment to countries such as India and South Africa. Ben Deda, the founder and CEO of Oncocare, publicly encouraged Morgan Tsvangirai, a prominent politician who had been diagnosed with cancer of the colon and had been receiving treatment in South Africa, to approach Oncocare instead of going abroad to get the same level of medical help. In February 2017, Oncocare asked the Zimbabwean government for a special approval to bring in foreign experts to improve cancer-related services being offered by local specialists. In the same month, Donance Kangausaru, one of Zimbabwe's first men to go public about their HIV status, successfully got his eye tumor removed in Oncocare. Treatments Oncocare offers sub-specialties in cancer care that include radiation treatment (2D, 3D, IMRT), medical oncology (chemotherapy) with dedicated hospital mixing pharmacy, treatment support (immunity support, palliative care, pain management) and a specialist cancer retail pharmacy. A mosaic oncology information system is used for error reduction. The hospital has the only digital linear accelerator in Zimbabwe. Its team of medical specialists includes oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, medical physicists, dosimetrists, physicians, biomedical engineers, and experts in oncology pharmaceuticals. A crucial role of the centre is to disseminate information on cancer prevention. More than 7,000 patients in Zimbabwe are diagnosed with cancer annually, and 1,200 of them die. The bulk of cases are detected in the last two stages of the disease, which has been attributed to the lack of awareness among communities. The hospital's database doubles as a cancer information centre, since there is a lack of local data.

Nor√©n started his military career in the Swedish Navy and was after a few years transferred to the Swedish Air Force where he would remain for over 30 years. Nor√©n finished his career by being the Chief of the Air Force from 1968 to 1973. Career Nor√©n was born on 10 May 1908 in Stockholm, Sweden, the son of the commander of the 1st rank Karl Nor√©n and his wife Marianne (n√©e af Sill√©n). He passed studentexamen in Gothenburg in 1927 and became f√§nrik in the Swedish Navy in 1930. Nor√©n served aboard aircraft cruiser , the Swedish Navy so far the only aircraft-carrying ship. Thus, he was also one of the few Swedish pilots who had experience in aircraft starting with aircraft catapult. Nor√©n belonged to the group of young naval officers who early made their way over to the young and growing Swedish Air Force. Nor√©n was promoted to underl√∂jtnant in 1932 and underwent flight training from 1932 to 1933 and was promoted to l√∂jtnant in 1934. He was then transferred to the Swedish Air Force where he became l√∂jtnant in 1936. Nor√©n underwent the general course of the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College from 1937 to 1938 and served mainly at the Air Staff from 1938 to 1943. Nor√©n was promoted to kapten in 1940 and underwent the staff course of the Royal Swedish Air Force Staff College from 1941 to 1942. He was a teacher at the Royal Swedish Air Force Staff College from 1943 and was promoted to major in 1944. Nor√©n was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1947 and was head of the Operation Department at the Air Staff from 1947 to 1949 and was appointed commanding officer of the Skaraborg Air Force Wing (F 7) the following year. He was promoted to colonel in 1951. Nor√©n was commanding officer of Skaraborg Air Force Wing from 1950 to 1957 and Inspector of the Control and Reporting System of the Swedish Air Force (Inspekt√∂ren f√∂r luftbevakningen) from 1957 to 1960. As Inspector of the Control and Reporting System he contributed to the realization of the construction of the modern combat management and air surveillance system called STRIL 60. MiG-21 aircraft in the Soviet Union in 1972. In 1960 Nor√©n was promoted to major general and appointed Chief of the Air Staff. As Chief of the Air Staff, he was one of the promoters of a joint executive management of the entire Swedish defence. Nor√©n stayed as Chief of the Air Staff until 1964 when he was appointed commanding officer of the First Air Group (E 1). After two years Nor√©n was promoted to lieutenant general and was appointed military commander of the Southern Military District (Milo S). He was the first military commander of Milo S with overall responsibility for the army, navy and air force under the new military area organisation. Nor√©n was appointed Chief of the Air Force in 1968 and was then faced with several difficult decisions. Increased financial resources coupled with increasing demands on the aircraft's performance and the effects of weapons imbued the defense debate. In the military command he conveyed his views in a way that created respect. He was then able to fulfill the Air Force's requirements, so that the Swedish air defense still would remain a significant factor in the Swedish defense. Nor√©n would remain as Chief of the Air Force until 1973 when he retired and was promoted to full general. Personal life In 1935 he married Ulla Nordenson (1910‚Äì1996), the daughter of G√∂ran Nordenson and M√§rta Bagge. He was the father of M√§rta (born 1938) and Ebba (born 1939). Nor√©n died on 10 September 1996, a few months after his wife, and they were both buried on 18 October 1996 buried at Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.

He is also notable for his attempt to blackmail the Duke of Cumberland in 1830.

Ashe by Thomas Ashe (quoted in 'Trevor Ashe and his Manx Museum, 1825' by Ann Harrison, in The Journal of the Manx Museum, Vol. VI, No. 81, 1965, p. 237) > \\"Possessing now my half-pay‚Ä¶ I formed the resolution of retiring to some > cheap place, and of living independently on my own contracted means.

John Belchem, Liverpool F.C.: Liverpool University Press, 2000, p.323-331 Ashe claimed that the novel was based on historical documents that he had been given, but that seems unlikely, not least because: \\"The focal point of the book consists of the long-drawn-out seduction of Julia, a young nun, accompanied by much weeping by the two lovers.\\" The only known copy of this book exists in the Manx National Heritage Library and Archives at the Manx Museum, making it \\"the rarest book of Manx fiction.\\"A Bibliographical Account of Works Relating to the Isle of Man: Volume II, compiled and edited by William Cubbon, London: Oxford University Press, 1939, p.1101 Once back in the UK, Ashe moved into journalism, acting as the Parliamentary Reporter for the Morning Herald for a period until 1811.'Letter to the Editor of the Manks Advertiser', Manks Advertiser 6 October 1825 From 1820 until 1823 Ashe was living in York under the name of Philip Frances Sidney.A Bibliographical Account of Works Relating to the Isle of Man: Volume II, compiled and edited by William Cubbon, London: Oxford University Press, 1939, pp. 1342‚Äì1344 It was under this guise that he edited the Yorkshire Gazette, for little more than a year, and then the Yorkshire Observer, for only a matter of weeks. It was in these papers that Ashe published a number of essays which were later collected as The Hermit of York: A Series of Essays on a Variety of Subjects, published in Hull in 1823. Publishing in the Isle of Man Ashe moved to the Isle of Man to take up the position of Editor of the Manx Sun in late October 1824. However, this did not last much longer than a month as he was replaced by James Grellier by 14 December 1824. However, this did not end his association with the paper as he wrote a great many articles for them over the coming year and more, including theatre reviews (for which some theatres tried to sue him for slander) and a defence of the poetry of Eliza Craven Green.'Notices from the Editor' in Manx Rising Sun, 30 April 1825 Ashe began publishing books and other publications shortly after arriving on the Island. The first proposed was Views of the Ocean from the Isle of Man, advertised in December 1824,'Programma of a work entitled, Views of the Ocean from the Isle of Man', Rising Sun, 7 December 1824 but it is believed that this was never printed in the form proposed.

However, the quality of the book has been cast into doubt by modern scholars: > \\"As for Ashe, the titles are the most Manx part of his poems. He started a > trend of 'topographical' poems, describing various houses with the owner‚Äôs > name thrown in as a selling-point.

By 1939 there were only four known copies of this book extant.A Bibliographical Account of Works Relating to the Isle of Man: Volume II, compiled and edited by William Cubbon, London: Oxford University Press, 1939, pp. 841‚Äì842 The Manx Museum Ashe is perhaps most often recalled on the Isle of Man as the founder of a \\"Manx Museum,\\" predating the Manx National Heritage Manx Museum by nearly 100 years.100 Years of heritage: The Work of the Manx Museum and National Trust, ed.

Harrison, Rugby: Jolly & Barber Ltd., 1986 On 16 July 1825 the Museum was announced as open on the North Quay in Douglas, promising \\"Natural and Artificial Curiosities, Remains of Antiquity, scarce Subjects in the Manx Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal Kingdoms, &c.; &c.;\\"'Literary Notice: The Manx Sketch Book', Manx Rising Sun, 16 July 1825 By 23 July the Museum had taken on a Museum Keeper, as well as Ashe in the role of Director, to keep the Museum open daily from 8 am until 9 pm. The collections were explained as consisting of three parts: \\"Subjects, strictly curious; Books and Prints, scarce or out of print; and original Paintings or Drawings.\\"'The Manx Museum', Manx Rising Sun, 23 July 1825 The Museum met with great success upon its first week of opening, inspiring Ashe to extend the collections of the Museum and to move it to larger premises on Duke Street, a move completed by 3 August 1825. This extension of the Museum included a Library and Literary Lounge, apparently enlarging the establishment \\"to the sphere of a Temple of Fancy,\\" which promised \\"public accommodation to ladies of taste and reading.\\"'The Manx Museum', Manx Rising Sun, 30 July 1825 However, it appears that Ashe overestimated the continued success of the Museum as he was obliged to organise a public lottery on 17 October to raise funds to pay off his debts.Untitled advertisement, Manx Rising Sun, 24 September 1825 This sale of books and prints was initially excused by Ashe as being to free himself from distraction for the sake of the Museum: \\"disposing speedily with a valuable Stock which diverts his attention too much from his Museum, ‚Äì the extent and character of which now occupy all his thoughts, and demand his entire care.\\" But by the time that two thirds of the tickets had been sold, Ashe was able to note that \\"Tradesmen and Artists may send in their Bills.\\"'The Manks Lottery', Manks Advertiser 6 October 1825 However, despite the relative success of the lottery, within only ten days of its taking place, Ashe made a public announcement of the Museum's failure:'Explanation', Manks Advertiser, 27 October 1825 > \\"all my efforts to establish a Museum in Douglas, and diffuse a love of > Literature and Science throughout the Island, have finally terminated in > unqualified loss, disappointment, and despair. [...] my failure is complete > from end to end, and I am doomed to sink a daring spirit into the mute > acquiescence of broken-heartedness.\\" After recognising his own failure in launching the Museum too late in the season and not controlling outlay sufficiently, he saw the \\"grand cause\\" of his \\"total failure\\" to lie with the people of the Isle of Man: > \\"Gentlemen, ‚Äì that cause exists in the party spirit which reigns in this > Island, ‚Äì a spirit which, while it exercises its accursed domination over > the land, will never allow it to become a rich mart of Literature, or a > proper theatre of undertakings of merit, magnitude or taste. Nearly all > minds are stimulated to such a degree by party spirit, that very few can be > devoted to the Sciences, and Belles Lettres. How, then, Gentlemen, could > labours and institutions, like mine, be expected to meet with common > encouragement, much less adequate reward?\\" Regardless of the reasons for the failure of the Museum, Ashe declared himself insolvent at the end of December 1825 and was incarcerated for debt in Castle Rushen.'Notice to Creditors', Manx Rising Sun, 31 December 1825 Contemporary descriptions of Ashe's Museum were tinged with rancour over Ashe's debt and later behaviour, bringing descriptions of the Museum episode such as: \\"He then begged and borrowed all the old prints, books, and stuffed fishes and birds, with pebbles from Peel Bay, and antediluvian nuts, ‚Äì and which medley he quizzically called a Museum ‚Äì himself the most awful curiosity in the collection.\\"Untitled article, Manx Sun, 20 May 1828 However, although modern estimations recognise the limitations of the Museum by modern standards, it is now seen as a worthy institution for that time: \\"The first Manx Museum was founded in the contemporary tradition of scientific knowledge, and interest in Manx antiquities and natural history, and as such is worth respect.\\" Later life and blackmail Ashe remained on the Isle of Man after his release from Castle Rushen, and made a return to journalism and publishing. Newspaper reports have him editing a journal for the Duke of Atholl, before moving on to become \\"editor of a popular journal\\", and then returning again to the Duke.'Douglas, Tuesday, March 6, 1827', Manx Rising Sun, 6 March 1827 He seems to have made an extra income from his journalism by receiving payment from individuals to write slanderous or damaging pieces about rivals or enemies.'Libel: Deemster‚Äôs Court Special', Manks Advertiser, 6 July 1826 Ashe soon extended the use of slanderous journalism to carry out blackmail, threatening to publish his own pieces about people if they did not pay him. Apparently at the same time as this blackmail, in 1827 Ashe made an attempt to set up as an estate agent, apparently with both a Douglas and a Liverpool address.'General Agency', Manx Rising Sun, 20 March 1827 However, by 27 May 1828 his schemes had evidently proven so unsuccessful that he left the Isle of Man for the final time.Untitled article, Manx Sun, 27 May 1828 By 1830 Ashe had children and was living \\"in a miserable way with his wife\\" at 17 King Street, Kensington, London, aged 60.'Threatening Letter to Kill the Duke of Cumberland', Manks Advertiser, 3 August 1830'The Late Captain Ashe', Mona's Herald, 23 July 1856 It was from here that Ashe is supposed to have written anonymously to the Duke of Cumberland, blackmailing him with the threat of publishing a damaging book he had written about him unless he received payment. When the Duke refused, another letter was written, on 27 May 1830, \\"threatening to kill and murder\\" the Duke.'Old Bailey ‚Äì Sept. 18', Manks Advertiser, 28 September 1830 Ashe was arrested when he was found suspiciously loitering outside the Duke's home. He served six months in Coldbath Fields Prison, but a link could not ultimately be established between him or his handwriting and the letters, and so he was acquitted. On 29 May 1831 Ashe wrote of having had an apparent conversion to Wesleyanism, having visited a chapel in Gosport only to gather material to slander it in a newspaper article.'Trevor Ashe!!!', Manx Sun, 14 June 1831 However, this was received with scepticism and derision both by the priest at the chapel and by the Manx press. The suspicion was that this was only another scheme of Ashe's to cheat others out of their money.'Douglas, June 14, 1831', Manx Sun, 14 Jun 1831 Ashe lived another four and a half years after this, dying in Bath at the start of January 1836. The final summation of his life was printed in the Manx Sun as follows: \\"His whole life was one continual series of struggles with misfortune, and he ended his days in utter destitution and want.\\"Untitled article, Manx Sun, 8 January 1836 References External links * The Pier and Bay of Douglas; or, Forget Me Not from the Isle of Man, in a Series of Marine Poems (1825) by Trevor Ashe, available online through ManxLiterature.com (accessed 6 April 2017) Manx writers Manx poets Manx culture 1770 births 1836 deaths Irish poets Irish novelists 19th-century British newspaper founders Irish journalists 18th-century Manx writers 19th-century Manx writers ","title":"Trevor Ashe"},{"id":"53709180","text":"Trosia flavida is a moth of the Megalopygidae family.

Background and composition \\"Crowded Places\\" was written and released specifically for the penultimate episode of the HBO series Girls, although Banks had already released The Altar, her sophomore studio album, six months prior. The episode was aired on April 9, 2017. The song was written by Banks, Anderson and Antonoff, and produced by the latter. The song is a ballad, which lasts for 4 minutes and 22 seconds. William Defebaugh of V Magazine described it as \\"stripped down and raw\\". Lyrically, \\"Crowded Places\\" talks about social anxiety and a relationship gone wrong because of this. The song begins with Banks singing softly \\"Hey, Hey, Hey\\". During the chorus, she sings, \\"Cause I've been scared of crowded places/ Come with me, I'll take you home\\". Critical reception Matthew Scott Donnelly of PopCrush described the song as \\"a quiet, moving lullaby\\". For Laurence Day of The Line of Best Fit, the song is \\"darkly euphoric\\". William Defebaugh V Magazine said that \\"Crowded Places\\" listens as of an open‚Äìhearted confessional, playing to the singer's strength in creating intimacy in sonic spaces‚Äìeven more so than anything she's released prior.

Civil War service  Upon arrival at camp, Johnson helped set up a hospital in an abandoned house as soon as possible. Johnson was immediately exposed to the harsh camp life; at first the hospital was so low on supplies they did not even have cots. When word got out about the poor conditions at this makeshift hospital, drastic changes occurred, and supplies were sent to the regiment. Eventually, Johnson became matron of this hospital which cared for the Vermont Brigade. Camp hardships surpassed supply shortages, however. Soon typhoid fever plagued the regiment, Johnson's husband and sister both falling ill. Her husband recovered, but Lydia Wood died. Johnson also encountered two soldiers who she believed died from sheer homesickness. Another noteworthy experience for Johnson were her trips to Washington, D.C. where she met Dorothea Dix. Johnson's husband was discharged upon injury, but Johnson continued her service for a few months after his departure. She left the service on March 23, 1862, after six months of service.

He was involved in early studies of protein synthesis and trafficking, established purification techniques to facilitate study of the cell nucleus, worked with Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine winner George Palade on cell membrane dynamics, and published extensively on the subject of postsynaptic density. Early life and education Siekevitz was born on February 25, 1918 in Philadelphia to a working-class immigrant family. He spent two years after high school working to save money for his college education, and then began at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science. He was drafted into the United States Army during his senior year, but deferred his service until after his graduation in 1942. He then served in the army for almost four years, first in a chemical warfare response unit and later as a laboratory technician. Siekevitz was admitted as a graduate student to the University of California, Berkeley in 1945. He received his Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1949 under the supervision of David Greenberg, with whom he studied amino acid metabolism using radioactive tracers. After graduation, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University with Paul Zamecnik, who was then one of a very small number of researchers studying the biochemistry of protein synthesis. Siekevtiz's work elucidated the role of mitochondria in generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) required for protein synthesis, which led him to become interested in general matters of energy metabolism. He received a fellowship to work with Van Potter at the University of Wisconsin studying the metabolism of adenine. This work attracted the attention of George Palade at Rockefeller University, who invited Siekevitz to work with him and colleague Keith Porter. Siekevitz moved to Rockefeller in 1954 and performed seminal work with Palade characterizing the dynamics of the endoplasmic reticulum. Academic career Siekevitz officially joined the faculty at Rockefeller in 1959 and became a full professor in 1966. He remained there until his retirement, assuming professor emeritus status, in 1988. Throughout his independent faculty career, Siekevitz continued to collaborate closely with Palade, and the two had a number of co- supervised students and postdoctoral fellows, including David D. Sabatini and G√ºnter Blobel. Beginning in the 1970s, Siekevitz invested significant research effort in studying the synapse and the protein composition of the postsynaptic density. Siekevitz served as the editor of the scientific journal Journal of Cell Biology from 1961 to 1964. He served as the president of the American Society for Cell Biology in 1966 and of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1976. With Ariel G. Loewy, Siekevitz coauthored the textbook Cell Biology and Function, first published in 1963 and later republished for an additional two editions, which has been described as the first American textbook specifically on the subject of cell biology. Siekevitz was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1975 and to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978. Personal life Siekevitz married his wife Rebecca Burstein in 1949; they were married for 60 years and had two daughters. Siekevitz enjoyed playing the piano and writing fiction - he published two novellas during his lifetime and left several unpublished short stories after his death. He was noted as a vocal advocate of ethics in science and wrote often on the subject. He also published commentary and science writing pieces aimed at explaining his work to the public. Siekevitz died of a stroke on December 5, 2009.

He was the first African-American student at Rice University, and the first African-American mathematics professor at the University of Maryland. His research concerns non-well-posed problems and harmonic analysis. Early life and education Johnson was born on 25 June 1943 in Alice, Texas and educated in a small segregated schoolhouse, with children in four different grades in each of its two rooms. Because he had been taught by his grandfather how to read and do arithmetic, he skipped two grades of school. After the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, desegregating public schools, he was allowed to attend the formerly- all-white secondary schools in Alice, beginning in the ninth grade. Shortly afterwards, the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957 and the ensuing Space Race led to the development of high school enrichment programs in science and mathematics, in which Johnson participated. Johnson earned a National Merit Scholarship, which he used to attend the University of Texas at Austin. Johnson writes that he \\"decided to major in math because it was one of the things I had enjoyed most in high school and there was no hope of my really understanding physics.\\" His high school mathematics teacher, Larry O'Rear, had been advised by mathematics professor Howard B. Curtis, and Curtis also became a mentor to Johnson, with much of his mathematical education accomplished through independent study advised by Curtis. Another role model at Texas was Vivienne Malone-Mayes, an African-American graduate student in mathematics and the grader for a linear algebra course taken by Johnson. However, Johnson was advised to avoid the courses of Robert Lee Moore, \\"the real head of the pure math department\\", who was famous for his mentorship of young mathematicians but also notorious for his racism. On completing his undergraduate studies, Curtis suggested that Johnson continue as a graduate student at Rice University. Rice's founding charter was to serve only the white citizens of Texas, but the university had determined to break both its racial and its state-based restrictions. Johnson was admitted to Rice in 1963, as its first African-American student, but his admission was delayed until 1964 by a lawsuit against the university by two alumni who did not want this change to happen. Johnson worked at Rice for a year as a research associate before becoming a regular graduate student. He then discovered that he was being paid less than the other graduate students, and almost left again, but continued after obtaining an NSF graduate fellowship. At Rice, Johnson met his future wife, Claudette, then a sociology student at Texas Southern University, through their shared participation in protests during the Civil Rights Movement. He was advised by Jim Douglas, Jr., who moved to the University of Chicago after Johnson's first year of study. Johnson moved with him, but returned to Rice to defend his dissertation on parabolic partial differential equations in 1969. Academic career With the help of Douglas, Johnson obtained a position at the University of Maryland, College Park, where he became the first African-American mathematics professor. At Maryland, Johnson remained active in recruiting and retaining African-American students, especially from historically black colleges and universities. He served as a mentor to 23 doctoral students, most of them African-American and many of them female; an administrator at Maryland wrote of his work in this area that \\"the institutional success of our Department in educating underrepresented minorities has been based on the leadership of Ray Johnson\\". He remained at Maryland for 40 years (with a two-year interlude at Howard University from 1976 to 1978) until returning to Rice in 2007. Awards and honors In 1986, the University of Maryland gave Johnson their Distinguished Minority Faculty Award. Johnson was the recipient of the 2006 Mentor Award for Lifetime Achievement of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2015 he won the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring, given to 14 scholars nationally by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Johnson's work earned him recognition by Mathematically Gifted & Black as a Black History Month 2017 Honoree.

She was the first artist to take the traditional folk art celebrating the harvest festival and turn it into two-dimensional pictures. As the first straw artist to join the Artist's Colony formed by the \\"Group of Six\\", she won acclaim with her picture Rit in 1962. Her works have been exhibited in over 100 group and solo showings. She has pieces held by several religious organizations and she was featured as one of the artists in a documentary about the craft in 2012. Early life Ana Milodanoviƒá was born on 18 May 1926 in ≈Ωednik in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Her sisters, and would both become Folk artists as well. In the tradition of the Bunjevac people, the sisters learned the art of braiding straw to create crowns, rings and ornamental objects. The craft developed around the harvest celebration of ', when works made of straw were used to express the importance of the crop to the community. Milodanoviƒá began by forming religious artifacts of straw, such as Kale≈æ (Chalice, 1956), Jaganjac na knjizi (Lamb on a book, 1957), Sveto Trojstvo (Holy Trinity, 1958) and Pokaznica (Processional cross, 1959). When Cardinal Aloysius Stepinac died in 1960, Ana and Teza developed a crest to commemorate him, which increased interest in the craft. The work is in the collection of the Zagreb Cathedral. Career In 1961, a group of na√Øve artists, including Lajo≈° ƒêurƒçi, Lajƒço Evetovic (hr), Ivan Jandriƒá (hr), Ludvig Laslo, ≈Ωarko Rafajloviƒá, and Stipan ≈†abiƒá (hr), known as the \\"Group of Six\\" founded an art colony at the \\"Matija Gubec\\" primary school in Tavankut. ≈†abiƒá was the director of the elementary school and Jandriƒá was an art teacher there. Other artists joined the group of six, including Ivan Prƒáiƒá Gospodar (hr), a poet from Subotica who would become the drama director of the group. Gospodar recruited Milodanoviƒá to join the group, because of her reputation as a straw weaver. Milodanoviƒá began creating pictures made of straw, the first artist to use the ancient skills to produce two-dimensional works. At the first group showing of painters and slamarke, held in 1962, Milodanoviƒá showed a model of St. Mark Church in ≈Ωednik (1961) and a pictorial work, originally called Voda i sunce (Water and Sun, 1962) and later titled Rit. The work was intricate and unique, involving bending, braiding, chopping, fringing and binding the straw with needle and thread. The following year, she created a new work, Sova na ƒëermi (Owl on Djerma, 1963), which brought public interest and critical acclaim to the craft. While other slamarke had followed her lead, press reports noted she was the most skilled, praising her skill and patience to create the expressive works which evoked movement and depicted the wildlife of the Baƒçka region, with such pieces as ≈Ωetvi (Harvest, 1964-1965), Devojƒçica sa guskom (Girl with a goose, 1964-1965), and Deƒçak sa leptirom (Boy with a butterfly, 1964-1965). Rit, by Ana Milodanoviƒá, 1962 first two-dimensional work of straw What began as regional art shows soon spread to international audiences with Milodanoviƒá exhibiting in over 100 shows, in many locations, including Baja, Hungary; Belgrade; Dubrovnik; Kostanjevica, Slovenia Moscow; Novi Sad; Sarajevo and Zagreb, among many others. In addition to these, Milodanoviƒá also exhibited in Germany, Mexico and the United States. At the 1970 Exhibition of the Yugoslav Association of Deaf Artists in Moscow Milodanoviƒá won the first prize and the same year won awards at an exhibition in Novi Sad. The public activities of the art colony were banned in 1972 when the leaders of the art colony were ostracized in a political purge. When the colony closed, Milodanoviƒá and her sisters Julija and Teza continued to work from their home, though Julija and Teza had jobs in Subotica and Ana kept the house for all of them. In 1976, she won a gold medal at the International Festival of Na√Øve Art held in Moscow with her work, Momaƒçko kolo (Bachelor Wheel). Her work was praised for its depth and perspective. Only a few slamarke continued the craft until the late 1980s when the artists organized again in Tavankut. Milodanoviƒá became a role model for young artists who wanted to learn the craft. Milodanoviƒá continued to make religious artifacts, at least 30 are known, including a crown made for Pope John XXIII in 1963, which is held in the vaults of the Vatican; a mitre and crosier made in 1963 for Bishop Mati≈°a Zvekanoviƒá (hr), held by the Diocese of Subotica; a 1964 globe featuring the dome of St. Peter's Basilica also held by the Diocese of Subotica; the Maslinske gore (Mount of Olives, 1968) in the artist's private collection, and others. She participated in exhibitions through 2000 and the following year was one of the main subjects of a monograph by . Umjetnost u tehnici slame (Art and straw technique). Death and legacy Milodanoviƒá died on 20 July 2011 in Subotica, in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Serbia. In 2012, a film Od zrna do slike (, From Grain to Painting) by Branko I≈°tvanƒçiƒá was produced by Atalanta, HRT, and OLimp featuring Milodanoviƒá and as outstanding straw artists. The film won prizes in both Los Angeles and Romania.

He is the fourth native Filipino to be elevated as Bishop of the Roman Catholic Church and the first from Northern Luzon ‚Äì the first Ilocano. Together with Laura Mendoza, a widow and catechist, they founded the Congregation of the Missionary Catechists of the Sacred Heart (MCSH), a congregation focusing on the missions of education and administration within the church, especially of catholic catechesis. His cause for beatification is currently underway. Early Years and the Seminary Alfredo Verzosa y Florent√≠n was born in Vigan, Ilocos Sur to Don Alejandro Verzosa and Do√±a Micaela Florent√≠n of the ‚ÄúGremio de Mestizos‚Äù (Mestizo Guild) of Vigan. Alfredo was the second of seven children. The Verzosa family was God-fearing and frequent mass-goers. They were close to the church for they were financial patrons of the Cathedral Church. The young Verzosa was reared to be pious, respectful, humble, kind, gentle and was showing signs of interest to priestly life. Later, after his elementary schooling, he enrolled at the Conciliar Seminary of Nueva Segovia. He stayed in the seminary for a span of three years. Undiscernful of his vocation, he decided to leave the seminary. At Letr√°n Verzosa transferred to the Colegio de san Juan de Letr√°n in Manila and there finished his ‚ÄúSegunda Ense√±anza‚Äù (Secondary Education) obtaining his Bachelor of Arts. At this point of Verzosa's life he was restless. He went to a Dominican Friar to seek for spiritual advice. The friar decided on his lot, that he return to seminary formation which he would later do. During one of his vacations to Vigan, it was disclosed to him by his elder sister that when Verzosa was living a secular life in Manila, she saw their mother waking up at the middle of the night, praying and shedding tears. Verzosa believed that he was the intention of his mother's prayer for it has always been her wish to see him a priest. Theological studies Verzosa, then, enrolled at the University of Sto. Tom√°s in Manila to study theology. He proved to be a good student. As a seminarian, he received his Tonsure and the Four Minor Orders in Manila. This time was a period of chaos in both civil and ecclesiastical life in the Philippines. The nation was at war for its independence from Spain. The church was not spared from the problem, some native priests became secret supporters of the revolution. The Schism The Ilocano priest and prominent figure in the Filipinization Movement, Gregorio Aglipay came to the picture. He served as Military Chaplain of the Aguinaldo Revolutionary Government. When the Bishop of Nueva Segovia, Jos√© Hevia Campomanes, could not exercise his authority over his jurisdiction caused by his imprisonment in Cagayan, Aglipay went to him and presented a provision that he be appointed as Ecclesiastical Governor of Nueva Segovia. Campomanes was impressed with Aglipay's intention and appointed him for the post. But it came out that Aglipay's real objective was to convince the Filipino clergy to stand against Spain and support the revolution. Aglipay was summoned to Manila by the Metropolitan Archbishop but did not appear. Because of his reception of the Civil Office as Military Chaplain from Aguinaldo in which he was found guilty, Aglipay was excommunicated of Usurpation of Jurisdiction. Later, he, together with some Filipino priests joined the newly established ‚ÄúIglesia Filipina Independiente‚Äù (Philippine Independent Church). The Diocese of Nueva Segovia was affected very much by the schism. Priests from the Province of Ilocos Norte, under Nueva Segovia at that time, defected to the new church and almost the whole population of that province followed their priests. This was the pastoral situation of Nueva Segovia at the arrival of the new bishop, Dennis Dougherty, in 1903. Among the first moves of Dougherty for Nueva Segovia was the ordination of new priests because many priests of his diocese defected to the new church. Priestly ordination Before finishing his theological studies, Verzosa was summoned by Dougherty to be ordained priest in Vigan. Verzosa was first assigned as priest-in-charge of the Vigan Cathedral. After some months, he was made priest-in-charge of the Parish of Santa. Eventually, he was appointed Assistant Priest to the priest Eulogio Alcid in the Parish of Bantay. Alcid is remembered in history as the priest who convoked the assembly of Ilocos Sur Priests denying allegiance to any foreign bishop. This move could have been another danger if it was not quelled by Dougherty. As Assistant Priest in Bantay, Verzosa resided in the ‚ÄúVisita de san Ildefonso‚Äù (peripheral mission of san Ildefonso) as he prepared for its establishment as a parish in 1906. The following year, Verzosa was made Parish Priest of Bantay. There, he had to do the difficult task to convincing people to return to Roman Catholicism. Bantay at this time was the home of numerous Aglipayans. It was related that when he was on a barrio mission, he was warned by a minister not to go to the barrios. He prohibited him to preach and bring people back to the Roman Catholic Church. Verzosa insisted on going. For this, the minister threw a spear at Verzosa. The priest missed the spike but caught his horse. Verzosa while serving as Parish Priest of Bantay was sent as missionary to the schismatic Ilocos Norte. He had to visit the towns and work for the revival of Roman Catholicism there. In 1915, while conferences on faith were given in Batac, an Agliyanan threw a stone at him. The stone caught the padre's breast but did not hinder him to preach. Second Bishop of Lipa In 1916, Rome named the 39-year old Verzosa as second Bishop of the Diocese of Lipa. He succeeded Giuseppe Petrelli who was appointed as new Apostolic Delegate to the Philippines. Verzosa was ordained bishop at the Cathedral of san Sebasti√°n in Lipa by his predecessor, the archbishop Petrelli on January 20, 1917. Verzosa arrived in Lipa enriched by his pastoral experience in Nueva Segovia. Learning from the perils of the Aglipayan schism, he believed that catechism is the demand of the time. He established catechetical centers and formed local catechists. It was said, that catechetical programs spread in the vast Diocese of Lipa like a wild fire. Catechism became the order of the day. A fruit of Verzosa's catechetical drive was the foundation in 1923 of the ‚ÄúReligiosas de Mar√≠a de la Ense√±anza Cristiana‚Äù (Religious of Mary of the Christian Education). Later named as ‚ÄúMisioneras Catequistas del Sagrado Coraz√≥n‚Äù or Missionary Catechists of the Sacred Heart. Apostolic Administrator of Nueva Segovia With the resignation of Peter Joseph Hurth as Bishop of Nueva Segovia, the Holy See appointed Verzosa as the Apostolic Administrator of the diocese. Sometime in January 1926, there was a rebellion of native priests assigned in Pangasinan, initiated by Hurth's Vicar General, Benigno Jimenez, who was serving in one of the parishes of the said province. Hurth suspended his Vicar General for living a life not aligned to priestly witnessing: concubinage. It was further reported that younger clerics took his act as an excuse to follow the same. His removal provoked a resistance from the clergy of Pangasinan. Stirred by Jimenez, the clergy accused Hurth of being partial for supporting the religious clergy over the diocesans, threatening him with a schism. This anti-religious sentiment of the native clergy was an old issue since the Spanish times and erupted during the Aglipayan Schism of 1902 as mentioned earlier. Verzosa took over Nueva Segovia in February 1926. He focused on the Pangasinan crisis. He visited parishes, talked with the clergy, brought them to retreat and spent time living in the province. A story has it that there was a young priest suspended by Hurth for living with a concubine but without a child. Before Hurth resigned, the young priest asked for his pardon and was readmitted to the ministry. But he could not return to the ministry for the concubine, who made him work in the field for a living, preventing his return. On one occasion, on his way to Vigan, Verzosa passed by with his car in the field. He called the priest to run to his car and quickly brought the priest to Vigan, away from the concubine. He reinstated him in the ministry. Solutions: The Diocese of Lingayen and the SVD's to Vigan The Pangasinan crisis was quelled with the kind and charitable bearing of Verzosa. At the end of his term as Apostolic Administrator in 1927, he gave a good proposal for Pangasinan: a new diocese should be created out of the vast province. Verzosa's aim was to provide a closer pastoral care of the area. He proposed that the seat of the future diocese be in Lingayen. Hence, the following year 1928, the Holy See established the Diocese of Lingayen out of the civil Province of Pangasinan and some towns of Nueva Ecija and Tarlac. The Archbishop of Manila served as Apostolic Administrator of the new diocese till the appointment of its first bishop in 1929. Also in 1926, he continued the negotiation for the Divine Word Fathers (SVD) to take over the reins of the Vigan Seminary. After the Jesuits ended their contract for the Vigan Seminary, they refused to renew it. The coming of the Divine Word Fathers to the Vigan Seminary was the solution of Verzosa to avoid its closure. Verzosa also invited the Holy Spirit Sisters to take over the Laoag Catholic School in Ilocos Norte in the same year 1926. They were sent there to educate young girls in this Aglipayan bailiwick. The Holy See offered Verzosa to be Nueva Segovia's next bishop but he refused. He believed that he was more needed in the Diocese of Lipa with the programs and constructions he had initiated there. Verzosa served as Apostolic Administrator of Nueva Segovia till the arrival of the new bishop, Santiago Sancho in 1927. Witnessing Many of Verzosa's colleagues were impressed with his purity of vocation. They elected him to some key tasks like Chairman of Catholic Action for the whole Philippines and Permanent Secretary of the Philippine Bishops. He most sought-after co-consecrator in the consecration of new bishops. Even the Apostolic Delegate, the archbishop William Piani, would always seek retreats with Verzosa in his residence. A testimony to his exceptional piety. He cared very much for his celibacy and chastity. As to the care of his priests, he helped financially priests from poor parishes. When a priest was found to be guilty of violating his celibacy, Verzosa would personally give retreat to that priest and wept with his priest. He was strong in reminding his clergy of fidelity to their vocation. He was helping poor students to finish their studies. He used his stipends in funding their schooling. He believed in the importance of Catholic formation of the young. He founded many Catholic Schools in his vast diocese. He likewise founded seminaries. During his term in Lipa, the three levels of seminary formation were present in his diocese. He established a seminary in Lucena, one in san Pablo, Laguna and Lipa. He gave up his ‚Äúpalacio‚Äù in Lipa and remodeled it for a seminary. He, then, had to stay in a rented house within the city. Verzosa was not luxurious, he did not have his own car, he was wearing tattered clothing. Rich people in Lipa were generous in giving him gifts and Verzosa gave some of these to his house helpers. It was even testified that he did not have his own bank account. He lived in simplicity and was very generous to those in need. He even invented jobs so to accommodate fathers who had nothing for their family. Verzosa in the first 25 years of his term in Lipa built churches, convents, monasteries and schools. This merited him the title as ‚ÄúGreat Builder.‚Äù He used the money of his diocese for the establishment of these edifices aligned to evangelization. It was also commented that Lipa during his time was in a time of religious revival. These good fruits of his ministry in Lipa seemed to be preparations of the forthcoming trials in his life. In the early 1940s, as they were preparing for his Silver Jubilee as bishop, with a synod and inauguration of a new seminary in Brgy. Antipolo, Lipa, the war broke out. The synod could not push through and the seminary had to be closed down. During the difficult times of the war, numerous people were massacred and burned inside the seminary in Brgy. Antipolo. Alfredo Obviar, his Auxiliary In this difficult moments of the war, he asked the Holy See to give him a helper in the ministry. It was 1944 when the Vatican appointed his Vicar General, Alfredo Obviar as his Auxiliary Bishop. Obviar was very dear to Verzosa. He ordained him as priest in 1919 and assigned to him to parishes close to the diocesan seat. He took him as his secretary in his pastoral visits and exposed him to challenging tasks in the ministry including catechetics and the foundation of the Missionary Catechists of the Sacred Heart. Obviar would later found his own congregation patterned after the charism of the congregation founded by his superior. Verzosa and Obviar had good working relationship. World War II During the war for liberation, the city of Lipa was very devastated by the bombings. Verzosa was already praying in his chapel and waiting for death to come. His secretary informed him that there was still time to evacuate. They proceeded to the cathedral and saw numerous people detained there. When the people were released, Verzosa had to take the leadership in leading the people towards American liberated lines. That was another difficult life for Verzosa. They travelled on foot amidst the perils of death. It became a news that Verzosa died in the bombings. At their arrival to their destination, when people saw him, they were all happy to have him alive. After the war, Verzosa again had to do the task of rebuilding the Diocese of Lipa, many churches, convents and schools were destroyed. He had to use his personal inheritance for the projects for the War Damage Fund was not enough. But there was a heavier wound to mend, the emotions of the victims of war caused by loss of loved ones, separation of family members, defilement of women of their dignity and the brutal mutilation and torture of men. They said that Lipa was lucky to have him during this time of restoration. The fatherly concern of Verzosa helped in the emotional and spiritual recovery of the people. The Carmel of Lipa In 1946, the Carmelite nuns finally gave their nod to establish a house in Lipa. Verzosa gave the lot where the seminary used to stand, the place of the holocaust of hundreds of people during the war. It was in this monastery where an alleged apparition of the Blessed Virgin to a young postulant happened in 1948. The Lady allegedly declared to the postulant that she is the ‚ÄúMediatrix of All Grace.‚Äù Thousands of pilgrims flocked to Lipa Carmel. Later, came the shower of rose petals believed to have come from nowhere. Verzosa, prudent as he was, went to Lipa from his residence in Batangas to warn the sisters not to spread the story of the alleged apparition. He told them to remove the newly carved image of the Mediatrix from public veneration as a commission does the investigation of the presumptive extraordinary occurrences. When Verzosa entered the locutory, he was greeted by a shower of rose petals said to have come from nowhere. He knelt down, prayed and astounded. He later ordered to put the image back to its former place. Since then, he became lenient over the coming of people to Carmel. However, Verzosa did not issue any public pronouncement on the veracity of the miracle for he entrusted the task to a commission. Lipa, under Apostolic Administration In 1949, Verzosa received a mandate from Rome informing him that he is relieved of his juridical task as Ordinary of Lipa and the diocese is placed under Apostolic Administration. This was because his health, weakened by the trauma of the war, made him less fitted to the pastoral governance of a vast diocese. He was humbly disposed to accept the will of the church. The young bishop Rufino Santos, Auxiliary Bishop of Manila was named Apostolic Administrator. The old bishop remained to stay in Batangas for two more years and eventually filed his resignation as Bishop of the Diocese of Lipa. After the acceptance of his resignation, he was named by the Holy See as Titular Bishop of Capsa. A defunct diocese in Northern Africa that exists only in name. Retirement Verzosa decided to return to Vigan for his retirement. It was heard from him that when he was leaving Lipa, he utterred, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still to become gold!‚Äù On his way home, he dropped by Lucena to bid goodbye to Obviar who was already then the Apostolic Administrator of Lucena. Obviar gave one of his priests to serve as Verzosa's chaplain in Vigan. The young priest Gregorio Salvatus was the one to whom the task was given. His retirement years in Vigan might have been the most difficult period in Verzosa's life. In his old age, he suffered depression, poverty and abandonment but he never complained. He was sustained only by his prayers. In a letter to the Carmelite Sisters of Lipa, he said, ‚ÄúPray for me as I pray for the Carmel of Lipa that the Virgin may give us the strength and constancy to carry the cross of love that she has placed on our weak shoulders.‚Äù Death On June 27, 1954, Sunday, Salvatus was asked to give the bishop the last anointing. After giving the sacrament and Apostolic Blessing to the Dying, the chaplain saw Verzosa getting weaker and weaker but remained conscious. Slowly he expired in tranquility: quiet, peaceful and saintly with the word, ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù as his last. He then had to be buried in a tomb intended for Bishops of Nueva Segovia. After his death, claims of his sanctity circulated. Santiago Sancho, Archbishop of Nueva Segovia, wrote in a circular letter, quoting the testimony of the chaplain, that Verzosa died with the death of a just man having his consciousness preserved till the last breath. A tribute to him was published some months after his death in the Bolet√≠n Eclesi√°stico de Filipinas, the interdiocesan bulletin of the Philippines, it was said, ‚ÄúWe leave it to Rome to speak on the interior piety of the late Bishop Verzosa; but we would like to believe ‚Äì from what we know and saw about him ‚Äì that as he knocked at his Supreme Commander‚Äôs Headquarters, he was warmly received with more than five stars waiting for his crown.‚Äù Nearly twenty-five years after his death, at the election of the next native bishop from Ilocos Sur in 1979, the Archbishop of Nueva Segovia Juan Sison recalled Verzosa by saying, ‚ÄúAfter virtuously rendering pioneering job as Bishop of Lipa ‚Äì died a saintly death in Vigan in 1954.‚Äù It was commented that ‚ÄúHeaven alone knows the depth of this prelate‚Äôs humility and faith in the Loving Father Who knows all. Truly, he was a holy priest of God!‚Äù Beatification cause On January 11, 2013, led by Ernesto Salgado, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia opened his official cause for beatification. This was in response to the petition of the Missionary Catechists of the Sacred Heart represented by Mary Julie Micosa who was serving then as Superior General. Fray Sams√≥n Silloriquez was appointed as Postulator. At the opening of the Cause, Verzosa was given the title, ‚ÄúServant of God.‚Äù On November 17, 2014, the Vatican Congregation for the Causes of Saints has issued the ‚ÄúNihil Obstat‚Äù (Nothing blocks the way) in the process of the Servant of God's Beatification and Canonization. The Tribunal was headed by Salgado who was its judge till his retirement in 2013. He was replaced by Marlo Peralta, the new Archbishop of Nueva Segovia. Gary Noel Formoso served as the Judge-Delegate with Santos Rabang as Defender of Justice and Gwendolyn Condor as Notary. The Theological Commission was headed by the bishop David William Antonio with Nick Vaquil√°r, Cosmenio Rosimo and Arvin Soriano as members. The Historical Commission was headed by Ericson Josu√© with Amador Foz, Ernesto Juarez and Jeric Jaramillo as members. On April 2, 2016, the Diocesan Inquiry ended. After the submission of the papers of the Diocesan Inquiry, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the ‚ÄúDecree of Validity‚Äù on June 2, 2017. This was followed by the appointment of Paul Pallath as the Relator of the Cause. The Cause is now in the Roman Phase and the ‚ÄúPositio,‚Äù the official paper of the Cause, is in the process of writing. Prayer for the Beatification of the Servant of God, Alfredo Verzosa God our Heavenly Father, through the most Sacred Heart of your Son, we thank you for having given us the Servant of God, Bishop Alfredo F. Verzosa. In imitation of your Son, he was an exemplary model of humility, obedience and patience in suffering, a model of love for the poor and the needy. (Mention your particular intention) If it be your will, may this Servant of God be beatified and finally canonized for your glory and the good of your people. We ask this through Mary our Mother in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.

Guns salvaged from scrapped ships found a second life on river gunboats of the Soviet Navy during the Russian Civil War and as coastal artillery and railway artillery during World War II. It was estimated that in 1941 there were 35 still in service. History In 1891 a Russian naval delegation was shown three guns designed by the French designer Canet. One was a 75/50 gun, one was a 120/45 gun, and the last was a 152/45 gun. All three guns used fixed QF ammunition which produced a rate of fire of 15 rpm for the 75/50 gun, 12 rpm for the 120/45 gun and 10 rpm for the 152/45 gun. The Russians were impressed and in 1892 they negotiated a production license for all three guns. Construction There were two main series of the 120/45 guns produced. The first series of 76 guns were built between 1897-1905 at the Obhukov factory. During the Russo-Japanese war a number of barrels of the 152/45 guns burst in action and a strengthened series of 152/45 and 120/45 guns were ordered. 34 of the second series of strengthened guns were built between 1905-1915 at the Obhukov factory. Between 1914-1916 production switched to the Perm factory and a further 18 strengthened guns were produced there. Naval Use 120/45 guns armed a variety of ships such as armored cruisers, auxiliary cruisers, coastal defense ships, destroyers, gunboats, minesweepers, pre-dreadnought battleships, protected cruisers, seaplane tenders and unprotected cruisers of the Imperial Russian Navy built between 1890-1916.

A 1985 documentary Broken Rainbow depicts the struggle of the Navajo amid government enforced relocation of thousands from Black Mesa in Arizona after the enactment of the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act of 1974. The documentary film about the relocation was nominated for an Oscar. She famously shot a rifle overhead as a warning to construction workers hired by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to build a fence between the Hopi and Navajo land in order to mine for uranium and coal for the coal company Peabody . In the 1988 documentary \\"Heart of Big Mountain,\\" Smith said, ‚ÄúI was born from Big Mountain. That‚Äôs my mother. So all of my life I will always be thinking of this place. My spirit will be here forever.‚Äù Early life Katherine Smith was born to the Navajo clan Tribe T√°bƒÖƒÖh√°, and her known family are her maternal and paternal grandfathers, T≈Ç‚Äô√≠z√≠≈Ç√°n√≠ and Naakaii Dine‚Äô√©, as well as her daughter Mary Katherine Smith. During the 1920s, Smith was required to attend an American Indian boarding school as a child. She describes this experience later in life as living within the \\"prison\\" of Western law. Activism Smith implemented much of her knowledge about Din√© philosophy to resist against the effects of the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act of 1974. One Navajo philosophy in particular was the Native ties to the land based on the tradition of burying the Umbilical cord into the ground after a child is born, which Smith's own mother had practiced. This attachment to place fueled Smith's efforts in protecting the land she was raised in. When the Act was approved and the Bureau of Indian Affairs came to Big Mountain to build a fence, which would require her relocation in 1974, Smith armed herself with a rifle at their arrival. She fired a warning shot to defend her homestead, which drew the crews set to relocate her away. She was arrested for this, but was later acquitted and had no charges placed on her. Throughout her life, she continued to advocate for the Navajo citizen's ancestral ties to the land to Big Mountain. In Fall of 2005, Smith wrote a letter to the U.S. government regarding how the settlement Act infringed on Din√©tah : \\"According to our oral historical traditions, from the beginning of the Fifth World, the Holy People- placed us ‚Äúthe Dineh‚Äù with Natural Laws-here within the six sacred Mountains, between the Male and Female Rivers. This defines our sacred boundaries of ‚ÄúDinetah‚Äù. Our sacred Mountain Bundles represent this Home, and our Laws.\\" Big mountain (Black Mesa) is remote rural area on the Hopi/Navajo Reservation where Kathrine Smith lived all her life. She died of natural causes on March 29, 2017 at 98, though some members of her family claim that she lived to over 100 due to her unknown birthdate. A celebration of her life was held open to the public on April 2nd, 2017 at Big Mountain. Publications *Cheyfitz, E. (2006).

He was well known among the humanists in Leuven as well as among scientists and mathematicians.  Life  Gaspard was the son of the surgeon Peter van der Heyden and Katharina van den Berghe. He was born around 1496 in Leuven. He's recorded to have married his wife, Anna van Luye in 1521. Little of his early life and education are recorded, but he was considered to be more than an artist, an engraver, a highly qualified craftsman, and a metal worker. He certainly had scientific education, especially in mathematics. A letter from Prof. Goglenius of Leuven dated December 2, 1531, to a friend of Erasmus, namely, to John Dantiscus, Polish policeman in the Netherlands, and great protector of Gemma Frisius, shows us that he and several other local humanists were friends of Erasmus. Goglenius thanks Dantiscus for a gift sent to him by Jaspar aurifex(Gaspard van der Heyden). The fact that the family name is not given makes it seem plausible that the goldsmith had a very good reputation among the Humanists in Leuven and the Court of Marius of Hungary. Unfortunately, Goclenius does not mention what type of object the gift was.  Metalwork and engraving  Gaspard van der Heyden is referred to as \\"aurifaber\\" or goldsmith in demographic records starting in 1524. In city records from Leuven his name is mentioned several times. It's recorded that on 13 June 1526 he received a payment for the production of a copper seal intended for the payment of the beer tax; On August 31, 1526, he's recorded to have been commissioned to make a gilded silver chain, destined for a city musician. On August 17, 1527 he's shown to have made a Seal for the city, and on the following December 19, he's recorded to have repaired the chain of a city whistle. In 1531/32, he's commissioned to make a stamp for embossing cloth. Van der Heyden was considered an important member of the Leuven geographic circle, and was noted by English scholar John Dee when he went abroad to speak with \\"some learned men, and chiefly Mathematicians, as Gemma Phrysius, Gerardus Mercator, Gaspar √† Myrica [Gaspard van der Heyden], Antonius Gogava.\\" In 1526 or 1527 he made a terrestrial and a celestial globe in collaboration with Franciscus Monachus of Mechelen. These globes have not survived, but are described by Monachus in a letter to his patron, entitled De Orbis Situ ac descriptione ad Reverendiss. D. archiepiscopum Panormitanum, Francisci, Monachi ordinis Franciscani, epistola sane qua luculenta. (A very exquisite letter from Francis, a monk of the Franciscan order, to the most reverend Archbishop of Palermo, touching the site and description of the globe.) De Orbis letter describing 1527 globe designed by Monachus He built another terrestrial globe with the assistance of Gemma Frisius in 1529, but they planned a new globe by 1535 to better represent new geographical discoveries. The new globe was completed in 1536 with Gerardus Mercator who apprenticed under van der Heyden. A celestial globe was produced by Frisius, Mercator and van der Heyden in 1537. Copies of the newer globes were produced until the 1570s. A legend engraved on the celestial globe reads \\"Made by Gemma Frisius, doctor and mathematician, Gaspar √† Myrica [Van der Heyden], and Gerardus Mercator of Rupelmonde in the year of the virgin birth 1537.\\" On July 4, 1549, he received compensation for a five-day stay in Antwerp, where he bought a cup from the goldsmith, Matthieu van Campen. This gilded silver cup was then decorated with the coat of arms of the town, inscribed with the inscription \\"insignia oppidi Lovaniensis\\", and gifted to Philip II on 5 July 1549, when he received the most prestigious notables in Leuven.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; 770‚Äì256\\"...Eastern Zhou period (770‚Äì256 BC)\\" Early China - A Social and Cultural History, p. 10. Cambridge University Press. BC) was the second half of the Zhou dynasty of ancient China. It is divided into two periods: the Spring and Autumn and the Warring States. History Map of major states in Eastern Zhou In 770 BCE, the capital of the Zhou Kingdom was moved from Haojing (Changan County in Xi'an City) to Luoyi (known today as Luoyang, Henan Province). This brought about the beginning of the Eastern Zhou dynasty (as opposed to Western Zhou dynasty), so named due to Luoyi being situated to the east of Haojing. Over 25 kings reigned over the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, lasting 515 years in all. With the death of King You of Zhou, the last king of the Western Zhou Dynasty, ascended Crown Prince Yijiu was proclaimed the new king by the nobles from the states of Zheng, L√º, Qin and the Marquess of Shen. He was King Ping of Zhou. In the second year of his reign, he moved the capital east to Luoyi as Quanrong invaded Haojing, indicating the end of the Western Zhou dynasty. The first half of the Eastern Zhou dynasty, from approximately 771 to 476 BCE, was called the Spring and Autumn period, during which more and more dukes and marquesses obtained regional autonomy, defying the king's court in Luoyi, and waging wars amongst themselves. The second half of the Eastern Zhou dynasty, from 475 to 221 BCE, was called the Warring States period, during which the King of Zhou gradually lost his power and ruled merely as a figurehead. After moving the capital east, the Zhou royal family fell into a state of decline. Also, King Ping‚Äôs popularity fell as rumors went that he had killed his father. With vassals becoming increasingly powerful, strengthening their position through defeating other rival states, and increasing invasion from neighboring countries, the king of Zhou was not able to master the country. Constantly, he would have to turn to the powerful vassals for help. The most important vassals (known later as the twelve vassals) came together in regular conferences where they decided important matters, such as military expeditions against foreign groups or against offending nobles. During these conferences one vassal ruler was sometimes declared hegemon. Chancellor Guan Zhong of Qi initiated a policy \\"Revere the king, expel the barbarians\\" (, see Sonn≈ç j≈çi). Adopting and adhering to it, Duke Huan of Qi assembled the vassals to strike down the threat of barbarians from the country. During the Warring States period, many of the leaders of the vassals‚Äô clamoring for kingship further limited the Zhou royal family‚Äôs influence. Map of the Five Hegemons during the Spring and Autumn period of Zhou Dynasty In 635 BCE, the Chaos of Prince Dai took place. King Xiang of Zhou turned to Duke Wen of Jin for help, who killed Prince Dai and was rewarded with rule over Henei and Yangfan. In 632 BCE, King Xiang of Zhou was forced by Duke Wen of Jin to attend the conference of vassals in Jiantu. In 606 BCE, King Zhuang of Chu inquired for the first time regarding the \\"weight of the cauldrons\\" (ÈóÆÈºé‰πãËΩªÈáç) only to be rebuffed by the Zhou minister Wangsun Man (ÁéãÂ≠ôÊª°). Asking such a question was at that time a direct challenge to the power of the reigning dynasty. At the time of King Nan of Zhou, the kings of Zhou had lost almost all political and military power, as even their remaining crown land was split into two states or factions, led by rival feudal lords: West Zhou, where the capital Wangcheng was located, and East Zhou, centered at Chengzhou and Kung. King Nan of Zhou managed to preserve his weakened dynasty through diplomacy and conspiracies for fifty-nine years until his deposition and death by Qin in 256 BCE. Seven years later, West Zhou was conquered by Qin.  Politics  This period marked a big turn in Chinese history, as the dominant toolmaking material became iron by the end of the period. The Eastern Zhou period was believed to be the beginning of the Iron Age in China. There was a considerable development in agriculture with a consecutive increase in population. There were constantly fights between vassals to scramble for lands or other resources. People started using copper coins. Education was made universal for civilians. The boundaries between the nobility and the civilians subsided. A revolutionary transformation of the society was taking place, to which the patriarchal clan system made by the Zhou Dynasty could no longer adapt.ÈªÑ‰ªÅÂÆáÔºö„Ää‰∏≠ÂõΩÂ§ßÂéÜÂè≤„Äã  Kings  * King Ping of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Yijiu (772 BCE‚Äì720 BCE) * King Xie of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Yuchen (770 BCE‚Äì760 BCE or 771 BCE‚Äì750 BCE) * King Huan of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Lin (719 BCE‚Äì697 BCE) * King Zhuang of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Tuo (696 BCE‚Äì682 BCE) * King Xi of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Huqi (681 BCE‚Äì677 BCE) * King Hui of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Lang (676 BCE‚Äì652 BCE) * King Xiang of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Zheng (651 BCE‚Äì619 BCE) * King Qing of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Renchen (618 BCE‚Äì613 BCE) * King Kuang of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Ban (612 BCE‚Äì607 BCE) * King Ding of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Yu (606 BCE‚Äì586 BCE) * King Jian of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Yi (585 BCE‚Äì572 BCE) * King Ling of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Xiexin (571 BCE‚Äì545 BCE) * King Jing of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Gui (544 BCE‚Äì520 BCE) * King Dao of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Meng (520 BCE) * King Jing of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Gai (519 BCE‚Äì477 BCE) * King Yuan of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Ren (476 BCE‚Äì469 BCE) * King Zhending of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Jie (468 BCE‚Äì441 BCE) * King Ai of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Quji (441 BCE) * King Si of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Shu (441 BCE) * King Kao of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Wei (440 BCE‚Äì426 BCE) * King Weilie of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Wu (425 BCE‚Äì402 BCE) * King An of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Jiao (401 BCE‚Äì376 BCE) * King Lie of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Xi (375 BCE‚Äì369 BCE) * King Xian of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Bian (368 BCE‚Äì321 BCE) * King Shenjing of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Ding (320 BCE‚Äì315 BCE) * King Nan of Zhou ‚Äî Ji Yan (314 BCE‚Äì256 BCE)  Spring and Autumn period  The period's name derives from the Spring and Autumn Annals, a chronicle of the state of Lu between 722 and 479 BCE, which tradition associates with Confucius. During this period, the Zhou royal authority over the various feudal states started to decline, as more and more dukes and marquesses obtained de facto regional autonomy, defying the king's court in Luoyi, and waging wars amongst themselves. The gradual partition of Jin, one of the most powerful states, marked the end of the Spring and Autumn period, and the beginning of the Warring States period.  Warring States period  An ancient sword dates back to Western Zhou The Warring States period was an era in ancient Chinese history following the Spring and Autumn period and concluding with the Qin wars of conquest. Those wars resulted in the annexation of all other contender states, completed with the Qin state's victory in 221 BCE. That meant that the Qin state became the first unified Chinese empire, known as the Qin dynasty.

He was CEO of the Hanes Corporation from 1964 to 1976, and founder of Ampersand Inc., a consulting firm for non-profit organizations. Hanes donated the land that became Stone Mountain State Park to the state of North Carolina, served as chairman for the National Endowment for the Arts, and the University of North Carolina School of the Arts board.  Early life  Hanes was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to DeWitt Chatham Hanes and Ralph Philip Hanes Sr. The Hanes family were involved as patrons to the local community when Phil was a child, with his father financing the restoration of Old Salem. His uncle, Frederick Moir Hanes, was a friend of American satirist H. L. Mencken. Hanes attended Woodberry Forest School before attending UNC Chapel Hill, where he enrolled in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, and was later transferred to the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps. Hanes soon left UNC for Yale, where he became a member of The Whiffenpoofs, touring across the Americas and Europe. In addition to a major in English, Hanes took Art Appreciation while at Yale. Hanes graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1949. The following year, on January 14 he married his first wife, Joan Audrey Humpstone.  Career  After graduating from Yale in 1949, Hanes returned to North Carolina to work at the family business Hanes Dye and Finishing. His father Ralph was CEO at the time, and sent Phil to work for Springs Cotton Mills, a competing textile company, which had a well respected training program for prospective executives within the textile industry. The program saw Hanes working all the floor-level positions within the Springs' factories, running every machine in the plant, working all three shifts, and living in towns such as Lancaster, South Carolina which according to Hanes \\"...had one grocery store, one filling station, one drugstore, and one movie house.\\" Phil came back to Winston-Salem after completing the program with Springs' to work in the offices of Hanes, of which he says that he, \\"...had to do every job in the office. I did everything but sweep the floor.\\" He moved up the corporate ladder once there, going from being an office drone and traveling salesman all the way to being vice president, president, and by 1964, CEO. During his tenure as CEO, he oversaw the company's push for desegregation, successfully integrating the facilities for both white and African-American workers. In 1976, at the age of fifty, Hanes resigned from his position, giving the role to his Nephew and the President of the company at the time, though he remained invested in the business as a chairman of the board and the second largest stockholder. The business was sold to Leggett & Platt for $65 million in 1993.  Arts and activism  The same year that Hanes returned to Winston-Salem to work in the family business, he was approached by the newly formed Winston-Salem Arts Council, which needed people on its board, and asked to join. Hanes financed the foundation of the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in 1956, and later worked with the organization as chairman at Ampersand Inc. In 1963, Hanes was one of the founders of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, as well as serving on the board of trustees under the first president, Vittorio Giannini. In 1965, Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Hanes to the National Endowment for the Arts council, with the likes of John Steinbeck, Duke Ellington, and Harper Lee. Picnicking with his wife in the 1950s by Stone Mountain in North Carolina, Hanes observed a nearby couple littering; upon asking them not do so, the couple informed him that the land was owned by a relative, and if he took issue with the littering he ought to leave. Hanes purchased the land, 80 acres, for $10,000, and over the next two decades purchased thousands of acres more of the surrounding area. Hanes donated that land, which would become Stone Mountain State Park, to the state government in 1975. He also purchased and preserved 9,000 acres around Mount Mitchell and 30,000 acres along ten miles of the New River. In 1979 Hanes co-founded the Awards in the Visual Arts program. Starting in the 1980s and continuing into the 21st century, Hanes invested more extensively in the local arts scene in Winston-Salem, participating in local arts councils, and helping in the foundation of establishments such as The Garage and The Werehouse.  Personal life  Hanes' wife Joan Humpstone Hanes died in 1983. He later met Mary Charlotte Metz and the two were married in December of the 1984. At the age of 80, he incorporated his life's lessons in his first book How to Get Anyone to do Anything. In addition to contributions to ecological conservation, Hanes developed a passion for the study of mushrooms after a friend gifted him a book on mushrooms in 1960, and became a member of the North American Mycological Association in August of the following year. Hanes died at the age of 84, in his native Winston-Salem on January 16, 2011.

Second Vice President Gervais Rufyikiri and a business delegation attended the 9th CII Exim Bank Conclave in New Delhi in March 2013. Several other Burundian ministers have also visited India. From India, the highest level visits to Burundi have been at the level of minister of state. Minister of State for External Affairs Preneet Kaur visited Burundi in February 2012, becoming the first Indian minister to visit the country. Kaur met with the President and Foreign Minister, and signed a General Cooperation Agreement. An Indian business delegation that accompanied Kaur, held meeting with Burundian businessmen.

Burundi supports India's candidature for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council.  Trade  India was the second largest source for imports to Burundi in 2015. Bilateral trade between Burundi and India totaled US$30.89 million in 2013-14. India exported $30.71 million worth of goods to Burundi, and imported $180,000. The main commodities exported by India to Burundi are pharmaceuticals and chemicals, machinery and instruments, plastic and linoleum products, transport equipment, rubber manufactured products and chemicals. The major commodities imported by India from Burundi are non-electrical machinery, iron and steel. As of August 2015, entities owned by Indians have a total investment of over $20 million in Burundi. Several companies owned by Indians and persons of Indian origin (PIO) operate in Burundi such as Angelique International Ltd (power sector), Jain Irrigation Systems (irrigation), Lucky Exports Ltd (traders of agro‚Äìbased commodities and minerals), and Akagera Business Group (diversified operations). Indian manufacturers Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Company retail motorbikes and auto-rickshaws in Burundi through their local dealers.

India has offered Burundi the Duty Free Tariff Preference (DFTP) scheme, which India extends to the Least Developed Countries (LDCs).  Cultural relations  Burundians often visit India to study in the country or to seek medical attention. The Indian High Commission in Kampala issued 447 student visas to Burundian nationals between 2012 and 2014, and 205 medical visas in 2014 alone. As of August 2015, around 450 Indian citizens of persons of Indian origin reside in Burundi. The majority of them are employed as traders and businessmen.  Foreign aid  India has offered to provide Burundi with lines of credit worth $4.22 million for a farm mechanization project, and another $0.17 million to help design an Integrated Food Processing Complex in Burundi.

The African Union nominated Burundi as the site for an India-Africa Vocational Training Centre (VTC) at the first India Africa Forum Summit in 2008. India trained Burundians in operations, and handed over the Centre to the Government of Burundi in April 2014. India also established a pan-African institute called the India-Africa Institute of Educational Planning and Administration (IAIEPA) under commitments made at the Summit. The Institute was opened in 2015. India pledged to build a cluster bio-mass gasifier system in Burundi at the second India Africa Forum Summit in 2011. India also offered to build a Farm Science Centre, an institution innovated by the Indian Council of Agriculture Research, in the country. Under the Pan African e-network project, India set up tele-medicine and tele-education centers in Burundi in 2010. The tele-medicine centers will enable Burundian doctors to consult with doctors in India. In April 2010, the two countries signed an agreement to establish an Information Technology Centre in Burundi with Indian assistance. India donated two consignments of medicines worth nearly $440,000 in June and July 2010 for distribution in refugee camps in Burundi. After a fire in Bujumbura, a major revenue-earning market of the Burundian Government, caused a financial crisis affecting the functioning of the Burundian Permanent Mission in New York, the Indian Government provided the country with $100,000 as grant assistance. India donated $100,000 to provide relief in the wake of flooding in Burundi in February 2014.

The strike was executed under responsibility of U.S. President Donald Trump, as a direct response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack that occurred on 4 April. The strike was the first unilateral military action by the United States targeting Ba'athist Syrian government forces during the Syrian Civil War. Trump stated shortly thereafter, \\"It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.\\"President Trump speaks after ordering attack on Syria VOA, 6 April 2017. The Syrian Air Force launched airstrikes against the rebels from the base only hours after the American attack. The ability to continue to use the base for these attacks has been attributed to the advance warning the US gave to Syria's ally, Russia, prior to the missile strike. Attack President Trump delivers his announcement. Missiles being launched from On the evening of 6 April, President Trump notified members of the U.S. Congress of his plan on the missile strike. According to a White House official, more than two dozen members of Congress were briefed at the notification. Internationally, the United States also notified several countries, including Canada, the UK, Australia, and Russia, in advance of the strike. The U.S. military stated it communicated with the Russian military to minimize any chance of Russian casualties. The strike was conducted without either U.S. congressional or United Nations Security Council approval. Commodore Tate Westbrook commanded the Navy task force in charge of the missile launch. It was the first time that the United States had acknowledged intentionally carrying out military action against the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The strike targeted Shayrat Airbase in the Homs Governorate, which was believed by American intelligence to be the base for the aircraft that carried out a chemical weapons attack on 4 April,US strikes on Syrian base: what we know ‚Äì AFP. Retrieved 8 April 2017. and was intended to destroy air defenses, aircraft, hangars and fuel. The US avoided striking a suspected sarin gas storage facility at the targeted airport. 59 Tomahawk missiles were said to have been launched from two U.S. Navy warships, and , at around 20:40 EDT (04:40 local time). Reconnaissance was provided by Python 73, a Boeing RC-135 of the 55th Wing. Casualties U.S. Central Command stated in a press release that Tomahawk missiles hit \\"aircraft, hardened aircraft shelters, petroleum and logistical storage, ammunition supply bunkers, defense systems, and radars\\". Initial U.S. reports claimed \\"approximately 20 planes\\" were destroyed, and that 58 out of the 59 cruise missiles launched \\"severely degraded or destroyed\\" their intended target. According to the satellite images the runways and the taxiways have been reportedly undamaged and combat flights from the attacked airbase resumed on 7 April a few hours after the attack, although U.S. officials did not state that the runway was a target. In a later statement on 10 April 2017, the US Secretary of Defense James Mattis claimed that the strike destroyed about 20% of the Syrian government's operational aircraft and the base had lost the ability to refuel or rearm aircraft. An independent bomb damage assessment conducted by ImageSat International counted hits on 44 targets, with some targets being hit by more than one missile; these figures were determined using satellite images of the airbase 10 hours after the strike. Among the targets struck was a 2K12 Kub (SA6) missile battery composed of five elements. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strike damaged over a dozen hangars, a fuel depot, and an air defense base. Al-Masdar News reported that 15 fighter jets were damaged or destroyed and that the destruction of fuel tankers caused several explosions and a large fire. According to the claims of Russian defense ministry, the \\"combat effectiveness\\" of the attack was \\"extremely low\\"; only 23 missiles hit the base destroying six aircraft, and it did not know where the other 36 landed. Russian television news, citing a Syrian source at the airfield, said that nine planes were destroyed by the strikes (5 Su-22M3s, 1 Su-22M4, and 3 Mig-23ML) and that all planes were thought to have been out of action at the time. The Israeli satellite imagery services company ImageSat International later released high resolution satellite images of the base taken within 10 hours of the attack showing that at a minimum, 44 targets had been hit, and that some had been hit multiple times. Lost Armour's online photographic database, for vehicle losses in the War in Syria, has images of 10 destroyed aircraft at Shayrat airbase. Seven or nine Syrian soldiers were killed, including a general; Russian military personnel were also present at the airbase at the time it was attacked. According to Syrian state news SANA, nine civilians were also killed in the attack, including four children. SANA also stated that five of the civilians were killed in the village of Shayrat, outside the base, while another four were killed in the village of Al-Hamrat, and that another seven civilians were wounded when a missile hit homes in Al- Manzul, four kilometers (two and a half miles) away from the Shayrat air base. According to Russian defense ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov, four Syrian soldiers were killed and another two were missing. Some observers conclude that the Russian government and therefore also the Syrian government was warned and Syria had enough time to move most of the planes to another base. Aftermath Hours after the U.S. missile strike, Syrian government's warplanes took off from the Shayrat base to attack rebel positions again, including the town of Khan Shaykhun. Commentators attributed the ability of the Syrian government to continue to operate from the base to the fact that the US gave Russia, Syria's ally, an advanced warning regarding the strike, which enabled Syrians to shelter many of its aircraft from the attack. Within a day of the attack, Russia announced it would strengthen Syria's air defenses and formally notified the Pentagon that as of 21:00 GMT (00:00 Moscow Time, 8 April 2017), Russia had suspended the U.S.‚ÄìRussia Memorandum of Mutual Understanding, which had established a hotline between the countries‚Ä≤ militaries designed to avoid collisions between their aircraft over Syria.

According to some local sources, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant took advantage of the attack and absence of the Syrian Air Force in eastern Homs, by launching several attacks on the Syrian Army's defenses in the western Palmyra countryside. It also attacked the checkpoints outside the village of al- Furqalas, but those attacks were repelled.ISIS used US missile strike to launch new offensive near Palmyra, Homs governor tells RT . RT. 7 April 2017. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the Shayrat airbase remained operational and Syrian warplanes took off from it the following day. The price of oil briefly rose over 2% following the strike. After both the chemical attack and missile strike, the U.S. administration was in disagreement and contradiction to U.S. policy from 2013 until 30 March 2017, as well the statements by U.S. ambassador to U.N. Nikki Haley, United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster differed on the change of U.S. military posture toward Syria and prioritization of regime change. On 7 April 2017, an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council was held: Bolivia‚Ä≤s ambassador Sacha Llorenty requested a closed session to discuss the U.S. strike, but U.S. ambassador Nikki Haley, serving as the council president for April, forced the meeting to be held in public view. United Nations News Centre reported that while some delegates expressed support for the strikes as a response to the Syrian Government's alleged use of chemical weapons, others condemned it as a unilateral act of aggression, underlining that the Council must authorize any such intervention. On 8 April 2017, the UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson issued a statement that announced that, upon consultations with the U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, he had cancelled his trip to Moscow scheduled for 10 April. On 11 April 2017, after the meeting at Lucca in Italy the Group of Seven unanimously blamed the Syrian government's military for the chemical attack and agreed that Assad must step down as part of any peace solution, but European allies rejected the US and UK push for sanctions against Russia and Syria. On 19 April 2017, two US defense officials said that the Syrian government had relocated the majority of its combat planes to Khmeimim Airbase shortly after the strike. In September 2020, U.S. President Trump mentioned that he wanted to kill al-Assad in 2017, by saying: \\"I would have rather taken him out. I had him all set, Mattis didn't want to do it.\\" Reactions =United States= National Security team. Politicians Reactions from members of Congress were mixed and not uniform by political party. Paul Ryan (R‚ÄìWI), the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, said the strike was \\"appropriate and just\\". House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R‚ÄìCA) said, \\"Assad has made his disregard for innocent human life and long-standing norms against chemical weapons use crystal clear. Tonight's strikes show these evil actions carry consequences.\\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D‚ÄìCA) said, \\"Tonight's strike in Syria appears to be a proportional response to the regime's use of chemical weapons.\\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R‚ÄìKY) said the strike was \\"perfectly executed and for the right purpose\\". Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D‚ÄìNY) said, \\"Making sure Assad knows that when he commits such despicable atrocities he will pay a price is the right thing to do.\\" Senator Bill Nelson (D‚ÄìFL) expressed his support, and said, \\"I hope this teaches Assad not to use chemical weapons again.\\" Senator Marco Rubio (R‚ÄìFL) called it an \\"important decisive step\\". Quoting the President's statement, Senator Orrin Hatch (R‚ÄìUT) tweeted, \\"'No child of God should ever suffer such horror.' Amen.\\" In a joint statement, Senators John McCain (R‚ÄìAZ) and Lindsey Graham (R‚ÄìSC) said, \\"Unlike the previous administration, President Trump confronted a pivotal moment in Syria and took action. For that, he deserves the support of the American people.\\" Their sentiment was shared by fellow Senators Bob Corker (R‚ÄìTN), Tom Cotton (R‚ÄìAR), Joni Ernst (R‚ÄìIA), Cory Gardner (R‚ÄìCO), David Perdue (R‚ÄìGA), Ben Sasse (R‚ÄìNE), and Thom Tillis (R‚ÄìNC). Many members who supported the action showed lack of worry about the authority issues or did not know the legal and constitutional rationale that supported the action. Other lawmakers criticized the President's actions, or urged caution. Representative Adam Schiff (D‚ÄìCA), the Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee, was informed of the strike by Dan Coats, the Director of National Intelligence, as it was happening. He urged the administration \\"not to make this a military effort to change the regime\\". In a joint statement, Representatives and Iraq War veterans Seth Moulton (D‚ÄìMA) and Steve Russell (R‚ÄìOK) said, \\"We cannot stand by in silence as dictators murder children with chemical weapons, but military action without clear goals and objectives gets us nowhere.\\" Senator Chris Coons (D‚ÄìDE) said he was \\"gravely concerned that the United States is engaging further militarily in Syria without a well-thought-out, comprehensive plan\\". Representative Ted Lieu (D‚ÄìCA) and Senator Tim Kaine (D‚ÄìVA) called the strike unconstitutional, with the former tweeting, \\"This was done with no debate in Congress and no explanation to the American people.\\" Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) tweeted that the strike could lead the U.S. into a new long-term quagmire, and that \\"such engagements are disastrous for American security, for the American economy, and for the American people\\". Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D‚ÄìHI) gave a more critical message, and said, \\"This escalation is short-sighted and will lead to the death of more civilians, more refugees, the strengthening of al-Qaeda and other terrorists, and a possible nuclear war between the United States and Russia.\\" Other lawmakers expressing criticism included Senators Michael Bennet (D‚ÄìCO), Ben Cardin (D‚ÄìMD), Ted Cruz (R‚ÄìTX), Dick Durbin (D‚ÄìIL), Ed Markey (D‚ÄìMA), Jeff Merkley (D‚ÄìOR), Elizabeth Warren (D‚ÄìMA), and Representatives Joaqu√≠n Castro (D‚ÄìTX) and Steny Hoyer (D‚ÄìMD). A number of Republicans with libertarian leanings also criticized the strike. Senator Mike Lee (R‚ÄìUT) said, \\"President Trump should make his case in front of the American people and allow their elected representatives to debate the benefits and risks of further Middle East intervention to our national security interests.\\" Senator Rand Paul (R‚ÄìKY) tweeted, \\"While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked.\\" Representatives Justin Amash (R‚ÄìMI) said, \\"Airstrikes are an act of war. Atrocities in Syria cannot justify a departure from Constitution, which vests in Congress the power to commence war\\", and Thomas Massie (R‚ÄìKY) called it a \\"big mistake\\". Former congressman Ron Paul argued that because in Syria \\"things [had been] going along reasonably well for the conditions\\", there was \\"zero chance\\" that Assad had deliberately used chemical weapons, and called the attack a \\"false flag\\". Public VOA segment that discusses the attacks with members of the public. U.S. Media outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, MSNBC and CNN were all generally supportive of the administration's decision to use airstrikes against Syria.Protesters gather on Lake Street in south Minneapolis to protest the bombings. A poll conducted by The Washington Post and ABC News reported that a \\"bare majority\\" of Americans supported the missile strikes and a similarly narrow majority opposed any further military action against the Syrian Government. A poll conducted by The Huffington Post and YouGov reported that around 51% of Americans supported the decision, and slightly more than one-third opposed both the decision and any further military action, with 45% unsure regarding future action. A poll conducted by CBS News reported that a small majority (nearly 6/10) supported the attack, but the appearance of consensus ends regarding future action. A poll conducted by Politico and Morning Consult reported that 66% supported the strikes, which includes 35% who strongly support and 31% who somewhat support them. Many right-wing/-leaning populist media figures criticized Trump's reversal of policy towards war in Syria and the Middle East. Ann Coulter pointed out that Trump \\"campaigned on not getting involved in Mideast\\" and this was one of the reasons many voted for him. Several protests were held in the U.S. which demonstrated against the attack. =Syria and allies= A joint command center of Russian and Iranian military in Syria, who support the Syrian government, said the strike crossed \\"red lines\\" and threatened to \\"respond with force\\" to \\"US aggression\\". Syria Syrian state media condemned the strike, calling it an \\"act of aggression\\", and claiming it caused unspecified losses. The Syrian Army said that its response will be to continue to \\"crush terrorism\\" and restore \\"peace and security to all Syrians\\". The Governor of Homs, Talal Barazi, said that the strike proves that the United States is supporting terrorism within Syria. Barazi told the Syrian News Channel that \\"they are not surprised today to see the supporting parties interfering directly after the failure of terrorists in targeting Syria\\". The spokesperson for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad called the missile strikes \\"unjust and arrogant aggression\\", and an \\"outrageous act\\", and that the attack \\"does not change the deep policies\\" of the Syrian Government. The Syrian Ambassador Bashar Jaafari at the UN Security Council session stated that \\"this act makes America a partner of ISIL, Al-Nusra and other terrorist groups\\", and it was a violation of the U.N. Charter. President Assad later told the Agence France- Presse that the chemical attack was \\"100% fabricated\\" and accused the United States of being \\"hand-in-glove with the terrorists\\" over the chemical attack. He also explained that the chemical attack was made up in order to give the United States an excuse to bomb the Shayrat airbase in retaliation. Najib Ghadbian, a representative of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, welcomed the strikes: \\"They are first good steps but we would like them to be part of a bigger strategy that would put an end to the mass killing, an end to impunity and eventually we hope that they will lead to a kind of a political transition [in Syria].\\" The pro-Turkish Kurdish National Council welcomed the missile strikes in Syria. \\"All Syrian people, including the Kurds, are happy and welcoming such an air campaign by the United States\\", a leader in the Kurdish Unity Party, part of the KNC, stated. Salih Muslim Muhammad, co-leader of the Democratic Union Party, stated that the attack \\"must yield positive results since the parties who did not believe in a political solution\\" will \\"reconsider\\" and \\"see that there is no military solution\\", and the US was \\"forced\\" to execute the attack. The PYD \\"hoped\\" that the US will not only attack the Syrian government, but \\"other parties have also used it, in Sheikh Maqsood, in Rojava, and Raqqa\\". Russia The Russian President‚Ä≤s spokesperson said the U.S. strike was \\"an act of aggression against a sovereign country violating the norms of international law under a trumped-up pretext\\", which \\"substantially impair[ed]\\" Russia‚ÄìUnited States relations. The Russian Government also alleged that the strike was an attempt to distract the world from civilian casualties in Iraq (an apparent reference to U.S. airstrike in Mosul that killed more than 200).\\"What We Know About the U.S. Military Strike Against Syria \\". New York. 7 April 2017. The Russian foreign ministry denounced the strike as being based on false intelligence and against international law, suspended the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Prevention of Flight Safety Incidents that had been signed with the U.S., and called an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov compared the strike to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Russian prime minister Dimitry Medvedev said the attack had placed the U.S. on the cusp of warfare with Russia. Russia has sent the frigate Admiral Grigorovich to the east Mediterranean in response, and warned that the US strike could have \\"extremely serious\\" consequences. Iran Iran's president Hassan Rouhani condemned the U.S. military strike, saying Trump had claimed that \\"he wanted to fight terrorism, but today, all terrorists in Syria are celebrating the U.S. attack\\".\\"Iran's Rouhani says Trump abetting Syria 'terrorists' \\". SBS News. 8 April 2017. According to Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif's tweet, \\"Not even two decades after 9/11, U.S. military fighting on same side as al-Qaida & ISIS in Yemen & Syria. Time to stop hype and cover-ups.\\"\\"Iran issues threat over US strikes in Syria \\". Fox News Channel. 7 April 2017. He described U.S. concerns regarding chemical attacks as hypocritical, inasmuch as the United States had supported Iraqi forces under Saddam Hussein as they massively used chemical weapons during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. During Friday prayers in Tehran, worshipers protesting the strike chanted \\"Death to America\\" and \\"Death to Al Saud\\" ‚Äì referring to the Saudi royal family. Ayatollah Mohammad Emami Kashani, who led the Friday prayers, called the United States \\"crazy\\" and blasted its \\"crimes\\". Ayatollah Kashani said that the Americans \\"gave chemical weapons and substances to the terrorists, while creating terrorists all over the world\\". According to an analyst writing for HuffPost, the 2017 Deir ez-Zor missile strike by Iran suggests that the country has shifted its three decades-long policy of testing, but not using missiles, as a reaction to Donald Trump's escalation in the Middle East, including \\"needless increase\\" in America's military involvement in the Syrian proxy war. =International= The governments of Albania, Australia, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Georgia, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Latvia, Lithuania, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom generally supported the strike, some calling it a just response and strong message against the use of chemical weapons. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the European Union have also expressed support for the attack. During the April 10 European Union summit in Madrid, the leaders of southern EU nations (Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Spain) said that a US missile strike on a Syrian airbase in retaliation for a suspected chemical attack was \\"understandable\\". Luxembourg's foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, noted that the U.S. and Trump's change in policy toward Assad government was surprising, and considered an international diplomatic effort as a solution. Slovakia and Netherlands said they understood why the strike was carried out, but that it is important to de-escalate the situation as soon as possible. Finland stressed the role of the UN Security Council to work for a ceasefire and political negotiations to achieve sustainable peace. Austria also called for de-escalation of the situation and consider there can be only a political and not military solution for the conflict in Syria. The government of Cyprus believes the strike is not beyond international law if it concerns a serious violation of humanitarian law. The Chinese, Greek, and Swedish governments offered neutral responses to the attack while the Indonesian government expressed concern over the attack. Trump told Xi Jinping, China's paramount leader and his guest at Mar-a-Lago, that he had ordered the attack; the missiles were near their targets as the Chinese leader left the resort. Xi told Trump that he understood the need of a military operation to respond when children were killed, according to Rex Tillerson.US strikes on Syria: Xi Jinping told Donald Trump he understood the US response 'because of the death of children' , Telegraph The Egyptian foreign ministry called on the United States and Russia to \\"contain the conflict\\" and reach a comprehensive and final resolution to the crisis, as did Hungarian Foreign Minister P√©ter Szijj√°rt√≥ who said that the civil war \\"cannot be resolved without an American-Russian accord\\" and Colombian President and 2016 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Juan Manuel Santos who called for a political solution to the conflict in Syria and dialogue between the United States and Russia to avoid escalating the already complex situation. The government of Switzerland has urged the international community to tackle the escalating Syrian crisis through diplomatic means rather than military confrontation. Taoiseach Enda Kenny of Ireland has described the strike as a \\"matter of grave concern\\" The governments of Belarus, Brazil, Bolivia, Russia and Venezuela criticized the strikes, with Bolivia describing the actions as a violation of international law and Iran arguing that the strike would strengthen terrorists and complicate the war. Bolivian ambassador Sacha Llorenty accused the U.S. for \\"imperialistic action\\" and related the current US Security Council situation with the one from 2003 about the Iraq War, when Colin Powell wrongly alleged that Iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction. Belarus condemned the attack as \\"unacceptable\\", while Venezuela described the attack as a violation of Syria's sovereignty. Brazilian Minister of Foreign Affairs Aloysio Nunes Ferreira condemned the ‚Äúunilateral use of force‚Äù by the United States without authorization from the United Nations. North Korea said that the strikes were an unforgivable act of aggression and that the strikes demonstrate why the country is entitled to its nuclear weapons program. The U.N. Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres appealed \\"for restraint to avoid any acts that could deepen the suffering of the Syrian people\\", and that \\"there is no other way to solve the conflict than through a political solution\\".

It is a ground orchid with a single leaf and one or two cream-coloured to light reddish flowers. It grows in forest on hillsides around Burrinjuck. Description Caladenia orestes is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a spherical underground tuber and a single linear to lance-shaped leaf, long and wide with a reddish to purplish base. One or two cream coloured to pink or reddish flowers are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepals is long, about wide, narrow egg- shaped to elliptic near its base then tapers to a blackish glandular tip. The lateral sepals are long, wide, lance-shaped to egg-shaped near the base then taper to blackish glandular tips. The petals are long, about wide and otherwise similar to the sepals. The lateral sepals and petals spread widely, turn down slightly or droop. The labellum is long, wide and curves forward with its tip strongly curving downwards. There are between 7 and 14 pairs of dark purplish, linear teeth up to long on the sides of the labellum and four or six rows of calli along the mid-line of the labellum, the longest of which are about long and shaped like hockey sticks. Flowering occurs during October and in early November. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia orestes was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones who gave it the name Arachnorchis orestes. The specimen was collected near Burrinjuck village and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. In 2010 Gary Backhouse changed the name to Caladenia orestes and published the change in The Victorian Naturalist. The specific epithet (orestes) is an Ancient Greek word meaning \\"mountaineer\\" referring to the steep mountain slopes where this species grows.

The combination could mean \\"dearly loved\\" or \\"beloved friend\\". The variants \\"Liubtrut\\" and \\"Liebtrut\\" are sometimes used in Germany today as women's given names.

The 2016 World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders placed Ecuador in the \\"noticeable problems\\" category for press freedom, ranking the country 109 out of 180. Law Ecuador‚Äôs Organic Law on Communications was passed in June 2013. The law recognizes a right to communication. Media companies are required to collect and store user information. ‚ÄúMedia lynching‚Äù, which appears to extend to any accusation of corruption or investigation of a public official‚Äîeven those that are supported with evidence, is prohibited. Websites bear ‚Äúultimate responsibility‚Äù for all content they host, including content authored by third parties. The law creates a new media regulator to prohibit the dissemination of ‚Äúunbalanced‚Äù information and bans non-degreed journalists from publishing, effectively outlawing much investigative reporting and citizen journalism. Human rights organizations fear that the new law will stifle critical voices in the media, due to its vague wording, arbitrary sanctions, and the threat of civil and criminal penalties.\\"Ecuador\\", Freedom on the Net 2013, Freedom House. Retrieved 27 October 2013. The government also created the Superintendence of Information and Communication (SUPERCOM) and the Council for the Regulation and Development of Information and Communication (CORDICOM), which \\"imposed a range of vaguely worded content restrictions\\". Online, standard defamation laws apply to content posted. Attempts to censor statements made in times of heightened political sensitivity have been reported, as have alleged instances of censorship via the overly broad application of copyright to content critical of the government. Lawsuits have been filed against digital news sites for comments critical of the government. In order to utilize the services provided by cybercafes, the national secretary of telecommunications, SENATEL, requires that users register with the following information: full name, phone number, passport number, voting certificate number, email address, and home address. Though originally the constitution allowed freedom of speech and in the press, a 2014 amendment regarded communication in Ecuador as a \\"public service\\", potentially allowing the government to become more involved in what is disseminated in the media. Areas of censorship =Media= Since the establishment of the Organic Law on Communications in 2013, \\"Ecuador‚Äôs media regulator, known as SUPERCOM, has issued sanctions in more than 300 cases against media outlets\\". SUPERCOM and CORDICOM also persecuted numerous figures in the media for not following \\"vaguely worded content restrictions\\". Media organizations were punished by the government for not disseminating \\"accomplishments made by (the) administration\\", for not using original government titles and for not publishing in formats enforced by the government. Media outlets are also susceptible to low advertising profits due to laws prohibiting how many advertisements are placed in non-official outlets and because advertisers fear reprisals by the government for providing advertisement funds to independent outlets.

There were no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitored e-mail or Internet chat rooms.

In January 2013, for example, President Correa called for the National Secretary of Intelligence (SENAIN) to investigate two Twitter users who had published disparaging comments about him, an announcement which sent a warning to others not to post comments critical of the president. After receiving criticism from the government, news site La Hora indefinitely suspended the reader comments section on its website. At the president‚Äôs request, the comments section was shut down completely. Print and digital news outlet El Comercio faced similar pressure related to its readers‚Äô comments and the comments section was ultimately disabled after President Correa sent a letter of complaint. While there are no official constraints on organizing protests over the Internet, warnings from the president stating that the act of protesting will be interpreted as \\"an attempt to destabilize the government\\" have undoubtedly discouraged some from organizing and participating in protests. =Non-governmental associations= Fundamedios, an Ecuadorian non-governmental association (NGO), was notified by the government in 2015 that it was making proceedings to dissolve the NGO for allegedly becoming \\"a political actor instead of an impartial observer of the country‚Äôs communications environment\\".

The rebels were predominantly Orthodox (Serbs), but some Catholics (Croats) also joined. Jovica Iliƒá corresponded with other Serbian Orthodox leaders and also sent letters to Serbian Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá.

After the collapse of the rebellion, Prince Milo≈° secretly received, hid and protected some of the rebel leaders and protested at the Porte due to the atrocities and penalties which had caused the uprising, and unrest not only in Bosnia but in Serbia also.

The loop at Bloor and Parliament, shortly after construction. Various organizations operated streetcars on Parliament street, in Toronto, Ontario. The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) discontinued scheduled service on Parliament in 1966, when it opened the Bloor-Danforth subway. History The first streetcar whose route ran on a portion of Parliament, was the Winchester route. It began operation in 1881, using horse-drawn vehicles, and was electrified in 1894. The portion of the route west of Parliament changed several times; the route turned onto Parliament at Gerrard Street, and ran north to Winchester Street, where it then ran with double track east to Sackville Street, then further east on a single track to Sumach Street where there was a wye. On September 1, 1921, the Toronto Transportation Commission (later the Toronto Transit Commission), a City of Toronto agency, took over responsibility for all streetcar lines in Toronto. At that time the Winchester route ran from Sumach Street west on Winchester Street, south on Parliament Street, west on Queen Street to loop via Church, Richmond and Victoria streets. Ex-Toronto Civic Railways Birney streetcars provided service. On July 1, 1923, the TTC renamed the route from Winchester to Parliament but did not modify the route. However, on September 2, a crossover was installed on Parliament Street just north of Queen Street, to become the new southern terminus of the Parliament route. On August 3, 1924, the Parliament route was extended north on Parliament Street from Winchester Street to the new Viaduct Loop on Bloor Street, enabling a transfer to the Bloor streetcar line. The track on Winchester, from Parliament to Sumach, was then abandoned, and replaced by bus service. On January 2, 1925, one-man, ex-Toronto Railway Company streetcars replaced Birneys on Sundays and holidays with service extended to Victoria Street. On May 5, 1940, this also became daily service. On October 20, 1940, Peter Witt streetcars replaced ex-TRC streetcars on the Parliament route. On December 16, 1946, special work was installed at the intersection of Parliament and King streets as part of a track extension on Parliament Street from Queen Street. The main purpose of this junction was to allow some King cars to short-turn via Parliament and Dundas streets returning via Broadview Avenue. On January 5, 1947, Parliament streetcars started to use to use the new Parliament Loop at the south-west corner of King and Parliament streets instead of looping downtown via Victoria Street. On June 8, 1948, PCC streetcars replaced Witt cars in base service. During the 1960s, the TTC was slowly replacing streetcar routes with bus routes. When the TTC replaced most of the Bloor streetcar line with the Bloor-Danforth subway, it also replaced several north‚Äìsouth streetcar routes with buses. The Parliament route was one of those. Streetcar tracks remain in use from Carlton Street to King. The 506 Carlton streetcar route uses the block of Parliament between Carlton and Gerrard. Streetcars use the remaining track when they are shifted from one route to another, or when a traffic accident or routine maintenance requires a temporary diversion.

This was the most senior Chinese position in the colonial civil bureaucracy with legal and political jurisdiction over the local Chinese community in the colony. Life Jan Pieterszoon Coen, Souw's patron and Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. A panorama of Batavia in Souw's time by Andries Beeckman Souw Beng Kong was born in Tong An, Fujian in 1580 during the Ming Dynasty. By the beginning of the seventeenth century, he had established himself as a leading magnate and merchant in the port city of Banten on the north coast of Java. He was appointed by Pangeran Ratu, Sultan of Banten (1596‚Äì1647) as the Kapitan Cina, or Chinese headman, of Banten. In the conflict between the Sultan and the Dutch East India Company, however, Souw sided with the Company. He developed a cordial relationship with Jan Pieterszoon Coen, the fourth Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies (1587-1629). When Coen moved the Dutch headquarters from Banten to the newly conquered city of Jayakarta (later renamed Batavia), the Governor-General asked Souw to relocate to the new Dutch capital. Souw played an important role in consolidating Dutch rule in Batavia by encouraging the settlement of Chinese migrants, starting with 170 Chinese families from Banten. The Company appointed Souw as Kapitein der Chinezen of Batavia with political and legal authority over the local Chinese community. This system formed part of the Dutch colonial system of ‚ÄòIndirect Rule‚Äô. Similar posts were created for leaders of other ethnic groups in Batavia, such as the Bugis, the Balinese, the Makassarese, the Indians and the Papangers. Interethnic relations were close. Kapitein Souw Beng Kong is recorded to have had two Balinese wives who gave birth to two sons. Beyond his role as Kapitein, Souw Beng Kong was also given the authority to mint coins and print money and the license to tax gambling in Batavia. He also developed trade links between Dutch Formosa (Taiwan) and Batavia towards the end of the Ming Dynasty. Souw resigned his captaincy in 1636 after 17 years in office. Kapitein Souw Beng Kong died in 1644. As proven by his tomb, which refers to the Ming dynasty, Souw was a lifelong Ming loyalist. Tomb The tomb of Kapitein Souw Beng Kong is one of the oldest historic sites of the colonial period in Jakarta, Indonesia. It is located in Mangga Dua Selatan, Central Jakarta, in what was then the outskirts of the old colonial capital. The then derelict tomb was first restored during the mayoralty of Souw's last colonial successor, Majoor Khouw Kim An (in office: 1910-1918, 1927-1945), who also added a commemorative plaque. After decades of abandonment and neglect, the tomb was restored again between 2006 and 2008 by a group led by MATAKIN (Supreme Council for the Confucian Religion in Indonesia) and Trisakti University.

The Museum serves to educate, preserve, exhibit and enlighten by balancing the challenges of contemporary art with the riches of traditional media for a comprehensive examination of visual culture. The Museum pursues its goal of furthering understanding of the visual arts by presenting a balance of high-quality, professional contemporary art exhibitions supplemented by written educational material, gallery talks, artist lectures, panel discussions, symposia and other related activities.http://www.niu.edu/artmuseum/aboutus/index.shtml History The NIU Art Museum originated in the NIU School of Art during the 1960s as an exhibition center curated by the faculty. In 1970, Gallery 200 was established as a permanent exhibition space within the newly constructed art building. In 1979, the Art Gallery moved to larger quarters in Swen Parson Hall and began to acquire a permanent collection. In 1990, the Swen Parson Art Gallery became a separate academic unit within the College of Visual and Performing Arts and its name was changed from \\"gallery\\" to \\"museum\\" to reflect its growing permanent collection. In 1991, the NIU Art Museum moved into the 5000 square- foot former auditorium in historic Altgeld Hall. This space was closed in December 1998 as Altgeld Hall was prepared to undergo a major renovation project. The Art Museum reopened in 2004 in the remodeled Altgeld Galleries. During the renovation, the NIU Art Museum offices moved to a temporary site off campus where the Museum staff oversaw its Museum without Walls program. While its main gallery was closed, the Art Museum collaborated with artists and local community ‚ÄòPartners in Art‚Äô in the development, design and production of contemporary art installations, events and projects at various locations within the greater DeKalb area. The NIU Chicago Gallery was founded in 1985 as an outreach unit located in Chicago‚Äôs River North gallery district. In this space, the Museum presented contemporary conceptual and installation art as well as the work of NIU faculty and students. In June 2006, facing tightening state funds, the Museum and University administration closed the NIU Chicago Gallery and reallocated resources supporting that space to the College. The Jack Olson Memorial Gallery (formerly Gallery 200) generally shows two professional art exhibitions per year and six student group art exhibitions. The Gallery was renamed in 1996 to honor art professor and past gallery director Charles ‚ÄúJack‚Äù Olson who taught at NIU from 1969 until 1994. The Olson Gallery was administered by NIU Art Museum staff from 1995 - 2004. Now, the Olson Gallery is run exclusively by the School of Art at NIU.http://www.niu.edu/artmuseum/aboutus/history.shtml =Community School of Arts = The NIU Community School of the Arts is an outreach program of the NIU of Visual and Performing Arts. Faculty and students from the Schools of Music, Art, and Theatre/Dance, as well as community artists, serve as teachers and advisors for a rich variety of high quality arts programming. As a member of the National Guild for Community Arts Education, the school is committed to making high quality arts education accessible to all.http://www.niu.edu/extprograms/csa/about.shtml The mission of the NIU Community School of the Arts is to promote artistic growth among all people in the community. The school encourages lifelong involvement in the arts and to this end provides a place where students at all levels of ability can come together to experience the arts, regardless of the ability to pay. Sponsored by the College of Visual and Performing Arts, the school offers private instruction and group instruction in music, theatre, and visual arts.http://www.niu.edu/extprograms/csa/about.shtml =Huskie Marching Band= The NIU Huskie Marching Band, known as The Pride of the Midwest, performs at all university home football games, at select away games, and at post-season bowl games.

It is a ground orchid with a single flattened, hairy leaf and up to three glossy purple flowers. It has recently been known as Elythranthera brunonis since 1963 but recent discoveries suggest its inclusion in the genus Caladenia. Description Caladenia brunonis is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with a few inconspicuous, fine roots and a tuber partly surrounded by a fibrous, multi-layered protective sheath. It has a single flattened, dark green, hairy leaf, long and about wide with a reddish- purple underside. Up to three glossy purple flowers long and wide are borne on a spike tall. The sepals and petals spread apart from each other, have blackish tips and are blotched with red or purple on their backs. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide. The lateral sepals and petals are long and wide. The labellum is about long, wide and whitish with the tip curved upward. At the base of the labellum there are two erect, fleshy calli about high with yellow bases and black or dark purple tips. Flowering occurs from August to early November. Taxonomy and naming The purple enamel orchid was first formally described in 1839 by Stephan Endlicher who gave it the name Glossodia brunonis and published the description in Novarum Stirpium Decades. In 1871, Heinrich Reichenbach changed the name to Caladenia brunonis and in 1963, Alex George changed it to Elythranthera brunonis. In 2015, as a result of studies of molecular phylogenetics, Mark Clements changed the name to back Caladenia brunonis. The specific epithet (brunonis) honours the Scottish botanist Robert Brown. Elythranthera brunonis is regarded as a synonym of the name Caladenia brunonis which is accepted by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Distribution and habitat Caladenia brunonis is a common and widespread species in Western Australia, found as far north as Kalbarri and as far east as Israelite Bay, growing in forest, woodland and heath.

The station existed from the mid-nineteenth century until 1963, when the last building was demolished. History In the late 1840s, the Pennsylvania Railroad sought to connect Philadelphia and Pittsburgh by rail via the state capital, Harrisburg, a route that eventually became known as its Main Line. The section passing through the area known as East Liberty (so named because it was part of the eastern grazing land‚Äîor \\"liberty\\"‚Äîoutside Pittsburgh) was completed in 1851, but the entire Main Line connecting the eastern and western principal cities of Pennsylvania would not be completed for another year. By 1855, maps indicate that the railroad had established a station at East Liberty, near where the railroad tracks traversed what would become Penn Avenue. East Liberty, along with surrounding areas, was annexed to Pittsburgh formally in 1868, and in the post-Civil War era of the late nineteenth century these neighborhoods began to develop substantially, with East Liberty becoming a commercial and retail hub serving the growing residential sections of Shadyside, Homewood, Wilkinsburg, and Highland Park. The railroad also developed extensive stockyards and a freight depot to the east of the passenger station, located on the south side of the railroad tracks. Large numbers of passengers used the station as commuters from these areas into downtown Pittsburgh on a daily basis. Map of East Liberty neighborhood in 1910, showing new passenger station with commodious driveway. In 1905, the Pennsylvania Railroad decided to construct a new station to serve the increased passenger traffic. They hired famed Philadelphia architect Frank Furness, who had already enlarged Broad Street Station in Philadelphia, the crown jewel of the PRR's sprawling network, in the early 1890s and designed several PRR suburban stations along the Main Line outside Philadelphia. The station was located several yards to the east of the old structure, which was demolished shortly afterwards. The new station was accessed from Penn Avenue via a large driveway that looped around behind several businesses directly fronting the avenue, including an express livery stable. The new two-story brick station used a T-shaped plan, with a gabled roof and two large arched lunette windows on the front fa√ßade. It was nearly completely encircled by a large porch, and contained two covered steel island platforms among the four tracks. The impressive arcaded ticket lobby was lit by several skylights.http://furnesque.tumblr.com/post/43347357694/east-liberty-station- pittsburgh-pa-1905-the Rail service continued to East Liberty through the drastic decline in ridership after World War II, though it was discontinued in 1957, and the station was demolished in 1963. The Pennsylvania Railroad formally dropped all suburban commuter rail service around Pittsburgh in 1964. Today a strip mall now stands on the site.
