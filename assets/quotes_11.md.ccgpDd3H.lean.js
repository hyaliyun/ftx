The name Gro√ües Bruch meaning \\"Great Wetland\\" denotes the swampy area of a former glacial valley, stretching about from Oschersleben and the Bode River in the east to Hornburg in the west. For centuries the inaccessible bog formed the border between the Duchy of Brunswick-L√ºneburg and the Bishopric of Halberstadt. History Hamersleben was first mentioned in a 1021 deed and in 1111 became the home of an Augustinian Canons Regular monastery which Reinhard, Bishop of Halberstadt had established at Osterwieck three years earlier. The double monastery also became the seat of an archdeacon in 1178. It joined the Congregation of Windesheim in 1452. During the Protestant Reformation Hamersleben was devastated in the course of the German Peasants' War in 1525, again by the troops of the then Lutheran Archbishopric of Magdeburg and once again by the forces of the Swedish Empire during the Thirty Years' War. Nevertheless the abbey retained Roman Catholic confession until its dissolution in 1804. The Catholic monastery church of Saint Pancras is a Romanesque building which is known for its Baroque pipe organ built in 1688. Today it is a stop on the scenic Romanic Road. The village of Neuwegersleben features one of the few preserved stations of the Prussian optical telegraph line from Berlin to Koblenz built in 1833. The building has been partly reconstructed and its signals were reinstalled. Today it houses a small museum. Transportation Am Gro√üen Bruch is located on the federal highway No. 245 running from Halberstadt to Haldensleben. In Neuwegersleben the highway No. 246 to Wanzleben branches off.

The standard tuning's irregular major-third is replaced by a perfect fourth in all-fourths tuning, which has the open notes E2-A2-D3-G3-C4-F4. The note layouts on the fretboard of a guitar tuned in perfect 4ths, with arrows that show where the same note continues on a higher- pitched string. All adjacent strings have the same interval and repeat at the 5th fret, unlike standard guitar tuning which has an inconsistency between the 2nd and 3rd strings. Among regular tunings, this all-fourths tuning best approximates the standard tuning. Open chords for beginners. These chord shapes can be moved across the fretboard, unlike the chord shapes of standard tuning. More movable chord-shapes. In all guitar tunings, the higher-octave version of a chord can be found by translating a chord by twelve frets higher along the fretboard. In every regular tuning, for example in all-fourths tuning, chords and intervals can be moved also diagonally. For all-fourths tuning, all twelve major chords (in the first or open positions) are generated by two chords, the open F major chord and the D major chord. The regularity of chord-patterns reduces the number of finger positions that need to be memorized. Jazz musician Stanley Jordan plays guitar in all-fourths tuning; he has stated that all-fourths tuning \\"simplifies the fingerboard, making it logical\\". : Among all regular tunings, all-fourths tuning E-A-D-G-C-F is the best approximation of standard tuning, which is more popular. An advantage of standard tuning is that it has many six-string chords, unlike all-fourths tuning. All-fourths tuning is traditionally used for the bass guitar; it is also used for the bajo sexto.https://stringedinstrumentdatabase.aornis.com/ Allan Holdsworth stated that if he were to learn the guitar again he would tune it in all-fourths. Relation with all-fifths tuning All-fourths tuning is closely related to all-fifths tuning. All-fourths tuning is based on the perfect fourth (five semitones), and all-fifths tuning is based on the perfect fifth (seven semitones). The perfect-fifth and perfect-fourth intervals are inversions of one another, and the chords of all-fourth and all-fifths are paired as inverted chords. Consequently, chord charts for all-fifths tunings may be used for left-handed all-fourths tuning.

Listed at , 155 lb, he batted and threw right-handed. His teammates affectionately called him Spook, a moniker that he used throughout his life. Baseball career Born in Cheswold, Delaware, Jacobs graduated from Salem High School, Salem, New Jersey in 1943. Immediately after graduation, Jacobs enlisted in the United States Army where he rose to the rank of sergeant during World War II and was awarded the Asian Pacific Campaign Theatre Medal, the American Campaign Theatre Medal, the United States Army Good Conduct Medal, and the United States Victory Medal. Following his honorable military discharge, he played professional baseball for 17 seasons for the Brooklyn Dodgers Philadelphia Athletics, Kansas City Athletics and Pittsburgh Pirates organizations, three of them in the majors, while playing for several professional league clubs including the highly competitive Cuban, Panamanian and Puerto Rican winter leagues. Winter leagues Jacobs won batting titles in Panama in the 1948‚Äì49 and the 1949-50 seasons while also helping Panama to its only Caribbean World Series Championship by having the game-winning walk-off hit against Puerto Rico for the Carta Vieja Yankees, and again in Cuba during the 1955‚Äì1956 season while playing for the Leones de la Habana / Reds. Jacobs also had the game-winning Cuban championship walk-off hit in 1952‚Äì1953 for the Azules de Almandares managed by Bobby Bragan. Because of Jacobs' exploits he was honored by being elected into the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame and the Cuban Sports Hall of Fame. To date the only American to receive both prestigious honors. Major League Baseball Jacobs posted a .247 average and a .971 fielding percentage in his major league career. He stole 22 bases, 17 of them in 1954. His build reminded some of Nellie Fox. On April 13, 1954, in his opening day major league debut, he became the only player in major league history to collect four consecutive hits in his first four major league at bats. He is also one of only three players in major league history to go 4-for-4 in their major league debut, the others being Delino DeShields and Willie McCovey.\\"Spook Jacobs Stats\\", pg. 1. Jacobs was a slap hitter who reached base by batting balls through the infield, and gained his ghostly nickname from his tendency to dump hits just over the heads of opposing infielders.\\"Cronin's Corner\\", Los Angeles Times, September 6, 1956, pg. A3. A baseball writer gave Jacobs the nickname in 1947 when he was playing with the Johnstown, Pennsylvania club, the Johnnies, of the Middle Atlantic League.\\"Spook Has Licenses To Prove It\\", Los Angeles Times, May 16, 1957, Page C3. Casey Stengel once said of him, \\"He's always been in our hair.\\" Jacobs was a farmhand of the Brooklyn Dodgers for eight years before becoming the property of the Philadelphia Athletics by being drafted in the winter of 1953 by Connie Mack. The Dodgers had vast minor league holdings in 1954, and loaded a number of their prospects on the roster of a single club. Under the rules of the time, only one selected player could be lost to a team per draft period. Jacobs was never called up to the Dodgers' top farm club, the Canadian Montreal Royals, because of their surplus of players. On one occasion, he was passed over when Brooklyn picked Junior Gilliam. Clyde Sukeforth hinted that the Pittsburgh Pirates might have an interest in drafting Jacobs, but the team chose Danny Lynch instead. Nevertheless, Philadelphia manager Eddie Joost was particularly impressed by Jacobs' fielding and his hit-and-run capability.\\"A's Rookie Top Argument Against Draft System\\", Hagerstown, Maryland Morning Herald, Friday, March 26, 1954, pg. 27. On April 20, 1954, Jacobs' fourth- inning triple, followed by an error on a fly ball hit by Vic Power, gave Philadelphia a 5‚Äì0 lead over the Washington Senators.\\"Kellner 1-Hitter Tops Senators, 7‚Äì0.\\" New York Times, April 21, 1954, pg. 37. On May 3 of that season, Chicago White Sox right-hander Sandalio Consuegra, retired the first 19 Athletics' hitters before Jacobs doubled in the seventh inning with one out. Consuegra retired the next five hitters before getting into trouble in the ninth. Then Jacobs bunted successfully and Consuegra threw wildly into right field, allowing two runs to score. Chicago beat Philadelphia 14‚Äì3 at Connie Mack Stadium, with Jacobs collecting the only two hits for the losers.\\"Jacobs Gets Only Hits As Chicago Wins, 14-3\\", Times Recorder, Zanesville, Ohio, Tuesday, May 4, 1954, pg. 10. Facts During 1956 spring training, Jacobs competed with Jim Finigan for the starting second base job for the Kansas City Athletics. By then, Finigan was considered the stronger hitter, and Jacobs the faster runner. He was optioned to the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League by the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 4, 1956.,\\"Pirates Call 3 and Option 4\\", New York Times, July 5, 1956, pg. 31. but was among 14 players recalled by the Pirates in late September.\\"Sports In Brief\\", Los Angeles Times, September 2, 1956, pg. A5. He was injured when he collided with teammate shortstop Dick Smith during a Pacific Coast League game. Both were chasing a fly ball in a game against the San Diego Padres (April 11, 1957), and Jacobs was thought to have suffered a hairline skull fracture after being carried from the field on a stretcher.\\"Twink Infielders Hurt in Collision\\", Los Angeles Times, April 12, 1957, Page C1.\\"Hyland Fling\\", Los Angeles Times, July 2, 1957, Page C2. He recovered and returned to the Stars' lineup as early as May 7, however.\\"Here's The Pitch\\", July 31, 1957, pg. C2. Jacobs and Tommy Lasorda were teammates on the 1956 Athletics. While pitching for the Los Angeles Angels (PCL), Lasorda deliberately hit Jacobs in the fifth inning of an August 1957 game at Gilmore Field. The knockdown came after relief pitcher Fred Waters hit a 400-foot home run which broke a 4‚Äì4 tie. Jacobs charged Lasorda and then went after his rival second baseman, Sparky Anderson. Finally, Jacobs' Hollywood Stars went on to score seven runs in the fifth inning to gain an 11‚Äì4 win. Jacobs also was involved in a fracas while playing for the Columbus Jets in July 1955. In the fourth inning of an International League game, Lou Limmer of the Toronto Maple Leafs slid into him at second base, knocking him head over heels. He was chased when he threw a punch at him in retaliation.\\"Limmer Hurt In Fracas\\", New York Times, July 9, 1955, pg. 10. A sore arm led to his demotion to Columbus, but when his arm recovered Jacobs was selected as the outstanding International League second baseman for 1955, batting .316.\\"Two A's Battling At Second\\", Mansfield, Ohio News Journal, April 3, 1956, pg. 9. Later life After his baseball career ended, Jacobs and his wife Bobbie settled in Milford, Delaware, where they owned and operated the Milford Bus Center, then Mr. Donut/Donut Connection, over a span of 42 years before retiring.\\"Old Brawlers\\", Los Angeles Times, May 27, 1977, pg. E3. The Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame enshrined Jacobs in 1991. He also became a member of seven Sports Hall of Fames: Delaware Baseball, Columbus, Ohio Baseball, Eastern Shore Baseball, South Jersey, Salem County, New Jersey, and the aforementioned Cuban Baseball and Cuban Sports. Other of his proudest achievements was when his personal stamp collection titled Mail It Home was featured in 2008 at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. Jacobs died at the Delaware Hospice Center in Kent County, Milford, Delaware, on February 18, 2011, at the age of 85. He is buried at the Milford, Community Cemetery.

He is one of four European-trained colts to have won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. Background Wilko was a chestnut horse bred by Rosendo Parra. He was sired by Awesome Again, winner of the 1998 Breeders' Cup Classic, he was out of the mare, Native Roots. His damsire was the British horse Indian Ridge, a sire of Breeders' Cup Mile winners Domedriver and Ridgewood Pearl, the latter also voted the 1995 European Horse of the Year. Wilko was purchased by Mrs. Susan Roy at the September 2003 Keeneland Sales for $75,000. The colt was sent into training with Jeremy Noseda in the United Kingdom. Racing career =2004: two-year-old season= Susan Roy raced Wilko as a two-year-old in the United Kingdom, where he won two races and had his best result in a stakes race with a second-place finish in the Vintage Stakes to Shamardal who would become that year's European Two-Year-Old Champion. Wilko also ran third in the Superlative, Royal Lodge and Chesham Stakes. At the beginning of October 2004, American businessman J. Paul Reddam purchased a 75% interest in the colt. Wilko was then sent to the United States to run in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, held that year at Lone Star Park in Grand Prairie, Texas. Racing on dirt for the first time in his career, Wilko was ridden by British-based jockey Frankie Dettori. The field included the betting favorite Roman Ruler who had won the Best Pal and Norfolk Stakes, plus Afleet Alex who had won the Sanford Stakes and the Grade I Hopeful Stakes. Given little consideration by bettors, Wilko was sent off as a 28-1 long shot but won by a length over Afleet Alex. He was the first British-trained colt to win the race, and the third European after Arazi and Johannesburg. On his next start, and the last of 2004, he ran third in the Hollywood Futurity behind runner-up Giacomo and winner Declan's Moon who would be voted that year's American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt. =Later career= In 2005, Wilko made six starts without a win then in 2006 went winless again but finished a solid second to Electrocutionist in the Dubai World Cup. He returned to racing in 2007 but fared poorly and was retired in August. In September, Wilko was acquired by Frank Stronach's Adena Springs breeding operation and will stand at stud at their Ocala, Florida facility where his sire Awesome Again is also located.

The blue area at the bottom represents the condensed phase (liquid brine or ice surface). During springtime in the polar regions, unique photochemistry converts inert halide salt ions (e.g. Br‚àí) into reactive halogen species (e.g. Br atoms and BrO) that episodically deplete ozone in the atmospheric boundary layer to near zero levels. Since their discovery in the late 1980s, research on these ozone depletion events (ODEs) has shown the central role of bromine photochemistry. Due to the autocatalytic nature of the reaction mechanism, it has been called bromine explosion. It's still not fully understood how salts are transported from the ocean and oxidized to become reactive halogen species in the air. Other halogens (chlorine and iodine) are also activated through mechanisms coupled to bromine chemistry. The main consequence of halogen activation is chemical destruction of ozone, which removes the primary precursor of atmospheric oxidation, and generation of reactive halogen atoms/oxides that become the primary oxidizing species. The different reactivity of halogens as compared to OH and ozone has broad impacts on atmospheric chemistry, including near complete removal and deposition of mercury, alteration of oxidation fates for organic gases, and export of bromine into the free troposphere. Recent changes in the climate of the Arctic and state of the Arctic sea ice cover are likely to have strong effects on halogen activation and ODEs.

Among the few information about his life, it is known that he wrote the epitaph for Caedwalla, the king of Wessex who was buried in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Benedict returned in Rome at the time of Pope Constantine where he opposed the claim of the bishop of Pavia, Armentarius, that Pavia were immediately subject to Rome. Benedict reminded to the Pope that Pavia historically was under the Metropolitan See of Milan and that the bishop of Pavia was used to be consecrated by the one of Milan. The pope however ruled in favour of Armentarius, perhaps due to a privilege granted at the times of Evodius or because Pavia was the capital of the Kingdom of the Lombards. To Benedict was due the construction of a church and a monastery in Milan, of which no trace remains. He probably was influential in settling the Schism of the Three Chapters. Paul the Deacon, about fifty years after his death, remember him as a saint venerated all over Italy. The day of his death was between 9 and 11 March 732. A poetry written about ten years after his death, De laudibus Mediolani, praises him and informs us that he was buried in the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio. His feast day is 11 March in the Roman Rite and 6 September in the Ambrosian Rite. A late tradition, with no historical basis, associates Benedict with the Milan's family of the Crespi.

See Robinson at austlit for details - 22 December 1826) was a poet and author of the first published verse in Australia. Biography =Legal troubles= Robinson was an educated man and appears to have practised as a lawyer. In February 1796 he was charged at the Old Bailey, London, for attempting to extort money from James Oldham, a Holborn ironmonger. He was found guilty and sentenced to death. The death sentence was changed to transportation, and he arrived at Sydney on the ship Barwell on 18 May 1798. Richard Dore, the judge-advocate, who had come out on the same vessel, stated that Robinson could be very useful to him and applied for his conditional emancipation. This was granted by Governor Hunter, and nearly two years later Dore made an application on Robinson's behalf for an absolute pardon. Robinson had been his clerk and had conducted himself properly in the meantime, but the second application was refused. In August 1803 Governor King mentioned in a dispatch that Robinson had committed perjury and had been ordered to be transported to Norfolk Island. This sentence, however, was not carried out at the time on account of the difficulty of finding another assistant for the judge-advocate. Governor King sent Robinson to Norfolk Island in 1805, but in December 1806 he was back in Sydney. =Career= In April 1810 he was made first clerk of the government secretary's office, and in this year published the first of his patriotic odes, \\"Ode on His Majesty's Birthday\\", 1810. This and the 19 other odes published on the King's and Queen's birthdays between 1810 and 1820 were first printed in the Sydney Gazette, and were then published separately, printed on three sides of a large folder. Another ode for the First of January 1811 was published as a broadside. \\"An Ode for His Majesty's Birthday\\", which was printed in the Sydney Gazette for 18 August 1821, does not appear to have been printed separately. Governor Macquarie took Robinson up and encouraged him, and he appears to have held to a straight course for the rest of his life. In July 1819 he was appointed provost-marshal but resigned this position in May 1821. In December of this year he advertised in the Sydney Gazette that he proposed to issue a volume of his poems at ¬£1 1s. per copy. Similar advertisements appeared in 1822, 1824 and 1825, but the volume was never published. He continued to be in the employ of the government for the remainder of his life, and at the time of his death on 22 December 1826 he was principal clerk in the police office. He was married and was survived by his wife, a son and a daughter. A list of his odes will be found in Serle's A Bibliography of Australasian Poetry and Verse.

The film is an adaptation of the 1945 Broadway play of the same name, itself based on Frederic Wakeman Sr.'s 1944 novel Shore Leave. The supporting cast features Ray Walston, Werner Klemperer, Leif Erickson, and Larry Blyden. Plot Three decorated Navy pilots finagle a four-day leave in San Francisco. They land a posh suite at The Fairmont San Francisco Hotel where Commander Andy Crewson (Cary Grant), a master of procurement, arranges to populate it with wine, women and song.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/80435/Kiss-Them-for-Me/ Blonde bombshell Alice Kratzner (Jayne Mansfield) is one of these women, lured to the suite under the false pretense that Crewson has a stash of nylon stockings. Once there, she is naturally attracted to Crewson, but later turns her attention to Lieutenant McCann (Ray Walston), a married man who also is in the process of running for a Congressional seat back home in Massachusetts. If he is elected, McCann can leave the Navy immediately and return to civilian life. Lieutenant Wallace (Werner Klemperer) tries to get the three pilots, including \\"Mississip'\\" (Larry Blyden), to make morale-raising speeches at the plants of shipyard magnate Eddie Turnbill (Leif Erickson), so that Turnbill will vouch for the men with the Navy and also to grease a lucrative job for himself upon leaving the service. Crewson and his cohorts, however, are physically and mentally exhausted from the war and simply want to enjoy a few days away from it. Suffering from combat stress and confronted with a number of reminders of the horrors of war, Crewson tries to amuse himself by making a play for Turnbill's attractive fianc√©e, Gwinneth Livingston (Suzy Parker). She resists his advances at first, but ultimately throws her engagement ring in Turnbill's face. Crewson declares his love for her shortly before he and his mates board a plane leaving San Francisco to return to duty.

Producer Jerry Wald acquired the rights to both the novel and play in September 1956. When Wald acquired the property Richard Widmark was approached to reprise his Crewson role, but was quickly passed over once Cary Grant expressed interest in the project. The film was the first of four collaborations between Stanley Donen and Grant.p. 292 Erickson, Hal Military Comedy Films: A Critical Survey and Filmography of Hollywood Releases Since 1918 McFarland, 7 Aug 2012 The screenplay toned down many cynical anti-war profiteer dialogues of the play and made the Alice character a war worker rather than a \\"Victory Girl\\".http://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts- and-maps/victory-girls The film was the feature film debut of both Ray Walston and Nathanial Frey, who had appeared together in Damn Yankees on stage, as well as Suzy Parker. The film was shot on various locations in San Francisco. At the end of the film, , an Essex Class aircraft carrier, can be seen launching a Douglas A-1 Skyraider type aircraft, though the Skyraider type was not actually used in World War II. Reception When released in late 1957, Kiss Them for Me was greeted with negative reviews. Critics called the film \\"vapid\\" and \\"ill-advised\\"; not to mention \\"no good\\". When the film didn't regain its production costs, Twentieth Century-Fox appeared to punish cast members, especially Jayne Mansfield, whose career was tossed on the back burner by the studio. Mansfield was resilient, however, and after several more years of starring roles landed on the Top 10 list of Box Office Attractions for 1963. In popular culture The English band Siouxsie and the Banshees used the movie's name in the title and lyrics of their 1991 release \\"Kiss Them for Me\\". The song is an ode to Jayne Mansfield and her death while driving from Biloxi to New Orleans in 1967.

History Joseph Smith III became the president and prophet of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS) in 1860, 16 years after the death of his father Joseph Smith. Following the elder Smith's murder in Carthage, Illinois, many of the faithful in the Midwest accepted Brigham Young's leadership and followed him to the Salt Lake Basin. A group of Latter Day Saints did stay behind in the Midwest, believing that the rightful line of succession for church leadership lay with Smith. The younger Smith accepted the leadership role with the newly named \\"Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\\" after church leaders attempted several times to persuade him.Knapp, William J. \\"Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\\", (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, 3 August 1990, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, pp. 1-6\\\\.

In 1867 the congregation in Plano appointed a building committee for the construction of a church building for the congregation, naming Smith as its chairman. Smith and the committee selected the site, design and builders for the project. Work on the building started on March 18, 1868 and by November 15 the completed church was dedicated. The building served as the main house of worship for the Plano RLDS congregation from its completion until 1881, and was the first church building for any congregation of the RLDS.

The one-story, symmetrical, rectangular building has a front gabled roof which meets the wall with a slight overhang and wide frieze below; both features are typical of the Greek Revival style. The front (east) facade is built from rock-face sandstone in regular courses, the three remaining walls feature rough-cut stone in irregular courses. Each side wall (north and south) has four windows with round, stone, arched lintels, keystones and stone sills. Each window features a full round arch and a nine over nine sash. Each of the building's four corners is adorned with stone quoins as are all of the windows. The front, double-door has a semi- circular transom window and a stone hood with a keystone above it. The interior of the Plano Stone Church consists of two rooms, a small by vestibule at the entry way, and the main room. The main room has a cove ceiling and a raised dais at its west (front) end. The interior wainscotting, doors, and window sashes are all original. The original pews feature wrought iron end pieces and other furnishings include a wooden pulpit. The building has undergone alterations and renovations during its history. The original stone stairs on the exterior were removed and replaced. Most of the structure's alterations occurred during the 1940s and were on its interior. Inside, there were originally two alcoves off the vestibule which contained stoves used for heating. These alcoves have since been enclosed: one serves as the basement stairway access and the other as a closet. Other changes during the 1940s include the addition of a projecting bay behind the pulpit and amber glass panes to the windows.

History  Led by Toma Vuƒçiƒá Peri≈°iƒá and later Ilija Gara≈°anin, Serbian Ministers, calling themselves the Defenders of the Constitution, were concerned about the welfare of the Serbian people, but were also obsessed with the increasing power of the state. The acts of the Defenders of the Constitution also foreshadowed the 1848 revolution in the region, when the Hungarians demanded national rights in the Austrian Empire. The Habsburg Dual Monarchy (the Emperor of Austria was also the King of Hungary) denied these national rights to the Hungarians as well as those of other nationalities that occupied the Kingdom of Hungary. This created a war between Hungary and Serbia. As a matter of government reform, the Defenders wanted better order in their administration. However, they also felt that the people themselves were not intelligent enough or in other words, not possessing the political consciousness or awareness to govern themselves; so it was their believe that the Defenders should teach or administer the people on how to govern themselves without their permission and against their own will.  Politics  Many of the politics and its bureaucratic foundations were derived from Gara≈°anin and Vuƒçiƒá's childhood idol, the autocrat Francis I, emperor of Austria And Hungary from 1792 to 1806. Both believed strongly in creating an educational system and free elections. These politics were later borrowed and perfected by Jovan Ristiƒá and his liberal government from 1876 to 1880.

The World Methodist Council, which represents most Methodist denominations, has no official statements regarding sexuality. British Methodism holds a variety of views, and permits ministers to bless same-gender marriages. American Methodism concentrates on the position that the same-sex relations are incompatible with \\"Christian teaching\\", but extends ministry to persons of a homosexual orientation, holding that all individuals are of sacred worth. The following denominations are members of the World Methodist Council. African Methodist Episcopal Church The African Methodist Episcopal Church does not approve of the ordination of openly gay persons to the ranks of the clergy in the Church. However, there is no official prohibition at this time against ordination. In a historic decision, which marked the first vote on the issue of marriage rights for same-sex couples by a predominantly African-American denomination, the African Methodist Episcopal Church unanimously voted to forbid ministers from blessing same-sex unions in July 2004. The church leaders stated that homosexual activity \\"clearly contradicts [their] understanding of Scripture.\\" Although the AME prohibits its ministers from officiating at same-sex weddings, the AME has \\"chosen to offer no official policy statements on homosexuality.\\" As it has no official policy on ordination, some openly gay clergy have been ordained in the AME. Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection The Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection, in its Discipline, teaches in ¬∂44: ¬∂340 outlines the consequences for clergymen engaged in homosexual activity:  Argentine Evangelical Methodist Church  The church, also called the Evangelical Methodist Church in Argentina, allows each congregation to make its own position. The church has stated that they have \\"given, on a national level, freedom so that each congregation accompany...these couples. We permit freedom of action in order to bless them\\".  Bible Methodist Connection of Churches  The Bible Methodist Connection of Churches, in its Discipline, states in ¬∂42 that: In ¬∂44, it further states that: ¬∂45 of the Discipline of the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches specifically prohibits its clergymen from officiating at same-sex marriages.  Church of the Nazarene  The Church of the Nazarene, a Methodist/Holiness denomination, teaches that marriage is only defined for heterosexual couples. As such, the denomination does not allow same-gender marriages.  Church of North India  The denomination, uniting different Protestants including Methodists, takes a traditional stand on human sexuality maintaining that marriage is defined heterosexually. The church opposes the criminalization of homosexuality, but also opposed the consecration of the first homosexual bishop in the Episcopal Church, the Rt. Rev. Gene Robinson. In 2009, the church both opposed the supreme court's decision to criminalize homosexuality, and also opposed same-sex marriage.  Church of South India  The Church of South India (CSI) is a united church representing Anglicans, Methodists, and Presbyterians. The CSI \\"is a relatively liberal Protestant church which has, since 1984, allowed women to become pastors. 'CSI has been liberal on these issues. It has taken up issues of gender, dalits and landlessness. It has to address the issue of sexual minorities too\\"'. In 2009, the Rev. Christopher Rajkumar, speaking for the CSI, supported civil rights for gay people. In 2015, St. Mark's Cathedral in Bangalore hosted an event challenging homophobia where the Rev. Vincent Rajkumar affirmed his support for LGBT rights. The BBC has listed the CSI as being among the churches open to blessing same-gender couples. Evangelical Methodist Church The Evangelical Methodist Church maintains that the biblical record condemns homosexuality as evidenced in Leviticus , Romans , and 1 Corinthians . It teaches that homosexual practices are \\"sin leading to spiritual death and eternal punishment. Nevertheless, homosexuality is no greater a sin than adultery, murder, stealing, among others. As a result, non-celibate gay people are barred from becoming members of the Evangelical Methodist Church. Moreover, practicing homosexuals are prohibited from becoming candidates for ordained ministry. The Church upholds that all individuals are entitled to certain rights and protection of the civil law; nevertheless, it opposes all civil legislation that supports homosexuality as a normal life style. All homosexuals who seek faith in Jesus Christ as Saviour and Lord, and cease to practice homosexual acts are welcomed into the fellowship of the Evangelical Methodist Church. Evangelical Wesleyan Church The Evangelical Wesleyan Church, in ¬∂92.1 and ¬∂92.2 of its Discipline, teaches that: Free Methodist Church As stated in the Book of Discipline (A/342) of the Free Methodist Church, it believes and teaches that  Italian Methodist Church  The Union of Methodist and Waldensian Churches, of which the Italian Methodist Church is a part of, voted in 2010 to bless same-sex relationships. LGBT-affirming church leaders said \\"the references to homosexuality in the Bible needed to be understood taking into account issue of culture and interpretation, to avoid the danger of Biblical fundamentalism.\\" Methodist Church of Great Britain At the annual Methodist Conference in 1993 in Derby, following long debate at all levels of the Church's life on the basis of a detailed report, the British Methodist Church considered the issues of human sexuality. The Derby Conference in 1993 passed a series of Resolutions which still stand. These resolutions are as follows: # The Conference, affirming the joy of human sexuality as God's gift and the place of every human being within the grace of God, recognises the responsibility that flows from this for us all. It therefore welcomes the serious, prayerful and sometimes costly consideration given to this issue by The Methodist Church. # All practices of sexuality, which are promiscuous, exploitative or demeaning in any way are unacceptable forms of behaviour and contradict God's purpose for us all. # A person shall not be debarred from church on the grounds of sexual orientation in itself. # The Conference reaffirms the traditional teaching of the Church on human sexuality; namely chastity for all outside marriage and fidelity within it. The Conference directs that this affirmation is made clear to all candidates for ministry, office and membership, and having established this, affirm that the existing procedures of our church are adequate to deal with all such cases. # The Conference resolves that its decision in this debate shall not be used to form the basis of a disciplinary charge against any person in relation to conduct alleged to have taken place before such decisions were made. # Conference recognises, affirms and celebrates the participation and ministry of lesbians and gay men in the church. Conference calls on the Methodist people to begin a pilgrimage of faith to combat repression and discrimination, to work for justice and human rights and to give dignity and worth to people whatever their sexuality. In 2005, the church voted \\"to offer the prospect of blessing services for same-sex couples\\", but in 2006 the church voted to step back but did offer \\"informal, private prayers to couples\\". In 2013, the denomination initiated a consultation on blessing same-sex marriages, and, in 2014, after same-sex marriage became legal, the Methodist Church decided in favor of allowing ministers to celebrate same-sex couples entering into civil marriages. Also in 2014, \\"the Conference resolved that its previous ruling that there was no reason per se to prevent anyone within the Church, ordained or lay, from entering into or remaining within a civil partnership, should also extend to those entering into legally contracted same-sex marriages\\". The denomination officially stated that Methodists may enter into same-sex marriages and that \\"prayers of thanksgiving or celebration may be said, and there may be informal services of thanksgiving or celebration\\". On 3 July 2019, the UK Methodist Conference voted by 247 votes to 48 to allow same-sex marriages in UK Methodist Churches.  Methodist Church of New Zealand  The Methodist Church of New Zealand, since 2004, has approved of ordaining openly gay and lesbian ministers, and the denomination allows each local congregation to determine its own policy on the issue. In 2013, when same-sex marriage was legalized in New Zealand, congregations that opted to do so were able to perform same-sex marriages.  Methodist Church of Peru  The Methodist Church of Peru, an autonomous affiliate of the United Methodist Church, has agreed to discuss the issue of homosexuality and the blessing of same-gender unions. Generally, the denomination is considered to be a progressive church in Peru.  Methodist Church of Southern Africa  The Methodist Church of Southern Africa spoke out against laws criminalizing homosexuality, and, in particular, condemned the anti-homosexuality laws proposed in Uganda. Currently, the denomination is discussing how to approach the issue of same- gender relationships. Currently, ‚ÄúConference recognises that any decision and subsequent action on the issue of civil unions between same sex partners must await the outcome of the ongoing process of engagement as specified by Conference 2005 and, in the interim, expects Methodist Ministers to continue to offer pastoral care to homosexual individuals.\\" Several courts have concluded that the church's policies are currently accepting of same-sex relationships as long as they are not 'marriages'. In 2013, the Western Cape High Court found that \\"the Methodist Church did not have a rule prohibiting its ministers from marrying someone of the same sex\\". Additionally, in 2015, another court determined that the denomination \\"even accepts same-sex relationships (as long as such relationships are not solemnised by marriage), which means it is not at the core of the Church‚Äôs beliefs\\". At the Constitutional Court, the church stated that the church \\"tolerates homosexual relationships but requires its ministers not to enter into same-sex marriages.\\" The Church allowed [gay ministers] to be in a homosexual relationship whilst being a minister, and allowed [a gay minister] to stay in the Church‚Äôs manse with [a] partner, but drew the line at recognising her same-sex marriage.\\"  Methodist Church of Uruguay  The church, part of the Evangelical Church of Uruguay, \\"has a ministry with persons of diverse sexual orientations\\". The denomination \\"resolved that pastors that wish to minister to homosexuals could do so freely\\". Since then, some congregations have provided blessing services for same-gender couples. Primitive Methodist Church The Primitive Methodist Church teaches that the practice of homosexuality is positively forbidden by Scripture, specifically in Romans 1:26-27 and Leviticus 18:22; 20:13. With regards to marriage, the Primitive Methodist Church believes it to involve the total commitment of one man and one woman.  United Church of Canada  The United Church of Canada, a member of the World Methodist Council, is a united church which resulted from the merger of multiple denominations including Methodists. The denomination is supportive of LGBT inclusion. The church ordains openly gay and lesbian clergy, and, in 2012, elected its first openly gay moderator to lead the whole denomination. Since 2003, the UCC has supported same-gender marriage. United Methodist Church \\"Through the labyrinth of booths at the Twin Cities Pride Festival, Faith Forward MN wove its way on Sunday to a row of faith-based organizations. There, we found a stream of interesting stories and perspectives of progressive faith. Here, you'll meet an ordained Methodist minister barred by the United Methodist Church from leading a congregation of his own.\\" As stated in the Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church, the United Methodist Church holds that \\"homosexual persons no less than heterosexual persons are individuals of sacred worth.\\" In other words, all individuals are of worth to God. In 1972, the proposed statement ended there; however, this phrase struggled to pass. Don Hand, a delegate from Southwest Texas suggested that the period be turned into a comma and add the phrase: \\"practice of homosexuality [to be] incompatible with Christian teaching,\\" For this reason, the \\"United Methodist Church does not condone the practice of homosexuality\\" or allow \\"self-avowed practicing homosexuals\\" to be \\"certified as candidates, ordained as ministers, or appointed to serve in The United Methodist Church.\\" Based on its teaching, the United Methodist Church officially prohibits the blessing of weddings of same-sex couples by its clergy and in its churches. As officiating at a same-sex wedding or coming out as an openly LGBT Minister is potentially a chargeable offense, numerous Ministers have been put on trial and defrocked,. The first United Methodist clergy to be defrocked due to being homosexual was Gene Leggett, in 1971, prior to the addition of the Incompatibility Clause which was in 1972. In 1987 Methodist minister Rose Mary Denman, was also defrocked for being openly gay. Similarly, in 2005, clergy credentials were removed from Irene Elizabeth Stroud after she was convicted in a church trial of violating Church law by engaging in a lesbian relationship; this conviction was later upheld by the Church Judicial Council, the highest court in the denomination. Other clergy, however, avoided church trials altogether. The Rev. Val Roseqnuist officiated a same-sex marriage in 2016 and reached a 'just resolution', and a church trial was avoided. Also in 2016, a complaint filed against an openly gay minister was dismissed, and the minister was able to continue working. The United Methodist Church in addition supports \\"laws in civil society that define marriage as the union of one man and one woman.\\" On April 30, 2008, at the General Conference, delegates adopted even more conservative language, stating that Christians are called to \\"responsible stewardship of this sacred gift\\" of sexuality and that \\"sexual relations are affirmed only within the covenant of monogamous, heterosexual marriage.\\" Still, in 2015, the Connectional Table, a general agency of the UMC, proposed a localized option that would permit ministers to officiate same-sex weddings and conferences to ordain openly gay clergy; the Connectional Table, however, cannot legislate church law (a right reserved to the General Conference) and their suggestion was rejected by three-fourths of the delegates at the 2016 General Conference. As a result of decisions made in April 2008 and August 2009, the United Methodist Church entered into full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The latter denomination allows individuals in committed homosexual relationships to serve as ministers, while the United Methodist Church requires gay clergy to remain celibate. Despite the fact that full communion allows for the interchangeability of all ordained ministers between the two denominations, Lutheran clergy who are involved in homosexual activity are prohibited to serve in the United Methodist Church in order to uphold the integrity of United Methodist ministerial standards. Nevertheless, the UMC has a more ambiguous policy regarding the ordination of transgender pastors and, in 2008, the Judicial Council ruled that each regional conference can determine their own policy; as a result, some conferences have ordained transgender pastors. Several grassroots organizations not officially recognized by the United Methodist Church have also formed around positions on issues relating to homosexuality. The Confessing Movement within the United Methodist Church seeks to continue to protect the United Methodist Church's current stance on homosexuality, if not make it more rigid. Moreover, another movement, Transforming Congregations, is a Methodist ex-gay ministry whose purpose is to \\"equip the local church to model and minister sanctified sexuality through biblical instruction, personal and public witness, and compassionate outreach. Meanwhile, the Reconciling Ministries Network seeks to change the United Methodist Church's current teaching on homosexuality in order to make the church more inclusive of LGBT people. At the 2008 General Conference of the United Methodist Church, it was decided that the Church would retain its views on homosexuality. At the General Conference in 2016, the delegates deferred the issue of human sexuality to the Council of Bishops in what has been described as a \\"'historic action'. In 2016, after General Conference, several Annual Conferences voted in favor of non-discrimination clauses that effectively allowed LGBTQ clergy and which indicated that those conferences would refuse to participate in any church trials in which people were being tried for being an active homosexual. The Baltimore-Washington, California-Nevada, California-Pacific, Desert Southwest, New England, New York, Northern Illinois, and Oregon-Idaho Annual Conferences voted in favor of full inclusion for LGBTQ members and clergy. Additionally, the Virginia Annual Conference voted to petition the UMC to allow LGBTQ clergy and same-gender marriages. The Rocky Mountain Annual Conference voted to not consider sexual orientation when electing a bishop. In 2015, the Great Plains and Greater New Jersey Conferences voted to petition the UMC to allow same-gender marriages. In 2014, the Social and Ethics Ministry of the Central Conference in Germany supported an initiative to propose steps toward the full inclusion of LGBT people. In 2012, the Minnesota Conference had voted to oppose bans on same- gender marriage, and the Illinois Great Rivers and West Michigan Conferences voted that it \\"expressed sadness\\" at the actions of 2012 General Conference, and the Arkansas Annual Conference voted to encourage respect for multiple perspectives on human sexuality. The Detroit, Upper New York, and Wisconsin Conferences also supported resolutions supporting allowing same-gender marriages. Bishop Christian Alsted of the Nordic and Baltic Episcopal Area shared that some of the conferences within his region support same-sex marriage. Within the jurisdictions, the Western Jurisdiction and the North Central Jurisdiction have nominated three openly gay candidates for bishop. The Northeastern Jurisdiction passed a resolution supporting same-sex marriage and the ordination of openly gay and lesbian clergy, with the New York body ordaining the first openly gay and lesbian clergy in the denomination. In 2016, the Baltimore-Washington Conference appointed an openly partnered lesbian to the provisional diaconate. In April 2016, Bishop Melvin Talbert performed a same-sex marriage as a public sign of his support for change and full inclusion of LGBT persons. The church also provides spousal benefits for non-ordained employees in same-sex marriages. Some congregations have individually voted to perform same-sex marriages. Also in 2016, the Western Jurisdiction of the denomination elected an openly partnered lesbian as bishop. However, two United Methodist bishops \\"voided two resolutions in the Northeastern United States that called for defying church restrictions\\". Similarly, the United Methodist Bishops of the Central Conferences of Africa unanimously called for \\"unreserved commitment to the Holy Bible as the primary authority for faith and practice in the Church\\" and proclaimed that \\"sexual relations are affirmed only within the covenant bond of a faithful monogamous, heterosexual marriage, and not within same-sex unions or polygamy\\". United Methodist Bishop Gaspar Jo√£o Domingos stated that \\"the United Methodist Church denies the abuse of the principle of tolerance that sets aside the authority of Jesus Christ and the teaching on sexuality.\\" At the same time, the Alabama- West Florida Conference\\" passed resolutions upholding the denomination's rules on homosexuality\\" and the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference \\"approved a resolution that urges the conference to demand clergy accountability to the Discipline's 'rules of our common covenant,' and to call upon clergy to challenge those rules only 'through legitimate channels of holy conferencing, rather than breaking that covenant.'\\" The Southeastern Jurisdiction also voted to maintain the current language in the Book of Discipline. On July 15, 2016, the Western Jurisdictional Conference elected Karen Oliveto to become the first openly lesbian Bishop in the United Methodist Church. She was consecrated as Bishop on July 16. She recently served as Pastor at Glide Memorial Church, is an ordained elder, teaches students at the Pacific School of Religion, and is on the Advisory Board of the Forum for Theological Education. Bishop Oliveto is married to Robin Ridenour, a Deaconess in the California-Nevada Conference.http://www.umc.org/news-and-media/married- lesbian-consecrated-united-methodist- bishophttp://www.rmnetwork.org/newrmn/bishopkarenoliveto/ However, on 25 April 2017, \\"In a 6-to-3 vote, the United Methodist Church‚Äôs highest court ruled that a married lesbian bishop, and those who consecrated her, had violated church law on marriage and homosexuality\\"; the United Methodist Church held that she \\"is in violation of a church law barring the ordination of 'self- avowed practicing homosexuals,' but it did not remove her as bishop, instead sending the issue back to the jurisdiction that chose her.\\" Therefore, the Judicial Council ruled that \\"Bishop Oliveto 'remains in good standing,' until an administrative or judicial process is completed.\\" However, the Judicial Council also ruled that \\"she was in good standing\\" and that \\"it had no jurisdiction to review Bishop Oliveto's nomination, election, and assignment.\\" On May 7, 2018 the Council of Bishops in the United Methodist Church proposed allowing individual pastors and regional church bodies to decide whether to ordain LGBT clergy and perform same-sex weddings, though this proposal can only be approved by the General Conference.Advocate: Methodist Bishops Back Choice on LGBT Clergy, Same-Sex Marriage At this meeting, the Council of Bishops will also consider 2 other alternative plans for the future concerning this issue. The second plan called the Connectional Conference Plan would create three connectional conferences based on theology related to the issue of human sexuality, the current five conferences would be abolished and each of the five conferences would have clearly defined values of accountability, contextualization, and justice. These three denominations would serve almost as three sub-denominations within overall United Methodism. The third plan, called the Traditional Plan, would reinforce the existing language in the Book of Discipline prohibiting homosexuality, gay marriage ceremonies on church campuses, and allow for stricter enforcement of violations of existing church law.Ask The UMC:Can you explain Way Forward plans, COB recommendation? On February 26, 2019, during a special session of the General Conference, delegates from around the world voted to pass the Traditional Plan. In March 2019, the German Central Conference announced that it would not be implementing the Traditional Plan. Although the US jurisdictions and annual conferences are unable to alter the Book of Discipline as the Central Conferences are, the Western Jurisdiction declared their disagreement with the Traditional Plan and vowed to remain LGBTQ inclusive. In January 2020, a 16-person committee of bishops and other official submitted to the General Conference a schism proposal for the creation of a new separated \\"traditional Methodist\\" denomination, a text that needed to be approved by the scheduled conference in May. By default, any parish will be set as a member of the United Methodist Church (UMC) and would have to conduct votes in order to enter in the newborn communion of the more conservative Methodists. The May vote to split the UMC was delayed.https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc- out/split-over-gay-marriage-delayed-united-methodists-face-year-limbo-n1200236  Uniting Church in Australia  The denomination has permitted presbyteries to ordain openly gay and lesbian ministers if they opt to do so and churches may bless same-sex couples entering into civil partnerships. On 13 July 2018, the Uniting Church in Australia voted by national Assembly to approve the creation of official marriage rites for same-sex couples.

Since 1 January 2010, it is part of the collective municipality Obere Aller.  Geography  The river Aller near Wefensleben Wefensleben is situated on the river Aller, in the lowland between the foothills of the Lappwald and the Osterberg (166 m). In the west is a forest of 24 ha named ‚ÄûTrenckmann's Busch‚Äú or ‚ÄûZechenholz‚Äú.  Village  Parts of Wefensleben are Wefensleben, the borough Belsdorf and the living-place Zechenhaus.  History  The first documentarily mention occurred in the year 1160 in the property list of the St. Ludger's Abbey in Helmstedt (). To middle of the 18th century Wefensleben is a pure farmer village. In the district available mineral resources influenced the evolution of the place. With the discovery of a coal seam in 1741 the coal mining began. Until 1825 coal was won in up to 12 shafts. From 1809 the Zechenhaus was the seat of the Eastphalian mountain and hut administration and from 1815 up to 1843 of the mountain and hut administration of the government district of Magdeburg. Between 1750 and 1900 3 quarries were operated to produce sandstone blocks as building material for many sacral and profane buildings in Central Germany. In the 1970s several Plattenbauten were built in the village and Wefensleben became a sleep and living place for the attendants of the Helmstedt‚ÄìMarienborn border crossing and their families. At this time many members of the Stasi moved to Wefensleben especially attendants of the Passkontrolleinheit (PKE) a division of the former Eastern Germany secret service who worked at the border crossing. church Belsdorf dove tower on the farmstead Tangermann References Municipalities in Saxony-Anhalt B√∂rde (district) Province of Saxony ","title":"Wefensleben"},{"id":"13248848","text":"Weferlingen is a village and a former municipality in the B√∂rde district in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.

Arrangements by Koen Schoots and orchestrations by Kim Scharnberg. It is about Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria and his extramarital relationship with Baroness Mary Vetsera. Their 1889 deaths at his Mayerling hunting lodge apparently were the result of a murder-suicide pact, although historians have debated this explanation. Loosely based on the book A Nervous Splendor: Vienna 1888-1889 by Frederic Morton, the musical was developed under the working titles Vienna, Aff√§re Mayerling (The Mayerling Affair), and Rudolf - The Last Kiss. The pressures of the monarchy have fallen upon Rudolf's shoulders, he is in political and personal conflict with his father, Emperor Franz Joseph, and his marriage to Princess St√©phanie of Belgium is crumbling when he meets and falls in love with the 17-year-old baroness. Their secret liaison doesn't escape the attention of prime minister Eduard Taaffe, who hopes to use his knowledge of the affair to destroy Rudolf's political career.  Plot  = Act I = Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria is forced, by his domineering wife Princess St√©phanie of Belgium, to attend a ceremony commemorating forty years of reign by his father, Emperor Franz-Joseph. All the upper class of Austria attend the celebration, in the renovated Hofburg Theatre, and revel in their eccentricity; while the poor lower class citizens riot outside demanding reform. A miserable Rudolf spends the evening drinking and fighting a terrible cold. (‚ÄúVorhang auf / Curtain Up‚Äù). Franz-Joseph gives his guests a speech promising a bright future for Austria, before pulling a switch that lights the theatre with electricity for the first time. The guests are then treated to a show starring three female singers in white gowns (‚ÄúWiener Schm√§h / Viennese Specialties‚Äù). Suddenly, a lower class woman runs up onto the stage and shoots herself in the head, splattering blood all over the performers' dresses. Most of the guests run out in fear, but Rudolf stays and kneels before the body asking, ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Baroness Mary Vetsera steps forward and explains, ‚ÄúIt is better to die all at once than to die a little every day.‚Äù Rudolf is left contemplating the suffering of his subjects (\\"Wie jeder andere Mann Prolog / An Ordinary Man\\"). Franz-Joseph has a meeting with his Minister-President, Count Eduard Taaffe about the ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù incident and rebellious newspaper articles published by a mysterious revolutionary named, ‚ÄúJulius Felix.‚Äù Rudolf interrupts begging his father to listen to his people, but the latter has no intent of doing so. Taaffe vents his suspicions that Julius Felix is an alias for Rudolf‚Äôs cousin, Archduke Johan Salvator. Franz-Joseph is hesitant to believe Taaffe, but commands him to uncover the truth. Once Taaffe leaves, Rudolf tries to explain to his father that he can no longer ignore the cries of the lower class, but Franz-Joseph again denies Rudolf‚Äôs pleas. The two men argue over how neither one understands the other (‚ÄúDu willst nicht h√∂ren / You Never Listen‚Äù). The next afternoon, Mary takes a walk with her best friend, Countess Marie Larisch, while reading Julius Felix‚Äôs latest article (‚ÄúWiener Schm√§h (reprise) / Viennese Specialties (reprise)‚Äù). Mary, a fellow liberal, is enthralled by Felix‚Äôs words, but Marie thinks he is dangerous. Marie advises Mary to turn her attention instead to saving her poor family from ruin by marrying the wealthy Duke of Bragan√ßa, but Mary is not interested. Marie reminds her friend that they have to prepare for a ball Franz-Joseph is hosting that night and goes into detail on how a woman can dress to attract a man (‚ÄúEin H√ºbscher Krieg / Pretty Little War.‚Äù) Mary muses on her desire to find someone who shares her ideals (‚ÄúMary's Lied / Mary's Song‚Äù). The ball is in honor of the newly crowned German Emperor, Wilhelm II, another of Rudolf's cousins. Still suffering from his cold, Rudolf does not desire to attend, but is again forced to by St√©phanie (‚ÄúDer Ball / The Ball‚Äù). While greeting guests Rudolf again meets Mary, but this time they talk and share a dance. Rudolf surprises Mary with his knowledge of Julius Felix‚Äôs articles and his understanding of their message (‚ÄúMarys Walzer / Mary's Waltz‚Äù). St√©phanie sees the two together but has grown so used to Rudolf's increasing infidelity that she doesn't stop them. Rudolf expresses his wish to see Mary again before she leaves (‚ÄúDer Ball (reprise) / The Ball (reprise)‚Äù). After the ball, Rudolf, Wilhelm II and Edward, Prince of Wales, visit a brothel. Wilhelm and Edward both leave with prostitutes, but Rudolf can only think of Mary. Elsewhere, Mary thinks about Rudolf. Neither can fight the feeling that their meeting meant so much more than met the eye (‚ÄúSo viel mehr / Something More.‚Äù) The next day, Taafe meets with Mr. Moriz Szeps, the editor of the newspaper responsible for printing the writings of Julius Felix, and demands he stop printing the articles. Unsure of Szeps‚Äô cooperation, Taafe orders the destruction of the newspaper‚Äôs editorial office (‚ÄúDie Strahlende Zukunft / Blue Skies‚Äù). In the destroyed office, Rudolf secretly meets with Szeps and his associates. The men declare that they have written up a new constitution for a free and liberal Europe and try to convince Rudolf to sign the document (‚ÄúZeit zu Handeln / Finish What You've Started‚Äù). Rudolf is hesitant to sign, not wanting to commit high treason against his father. The men agree to give Rudolf time to make his decision. Once left alone, Rudolf wonders if he can find the strength to go against his father (Wohin f√ºhrt mein Weg? / How Will I Know?‚Äù). Mary than enters the office, looking to deliver a letter for Julius Felix. Rudolf reads the letter, which states Mary‚Äôs desire to meet Felix. Rudolf reveals that he is, in fact, secretly Julius Felix. Mary is shocked, but elated, and the two spend the evening ice-skating (‚ÄúTralala / The Tra-La- La Ice Skating Song‚Äù). Rudolf informs Mary that they are being watched by Wiligut, one of Taafe‚Äôs spies, and suggests that they play a little joke on him. Rudolf and Mary pretend to flirt with each other, teasing Wiligut, but actually begin to fall in love in the process. (‚ÄúIn dem moment als ich dich sah / The Moment I Saw You‚Äù). Rudolf tells Mary of the one place where his life is not complicated and he can write the dreams of Julius Felix: Mayerling. Mary asks that Rudolf take her there some day. Taafe meets with Franz-Joseph to discuss the renewal of Austria‚Äôs alliance with Germany. When Franz-Joseph asks of Julius Felix, Taafe divulges new intelligence that puts Rudolf under suspicion; but Franz-Joseph does not believe his son could be responsible. Rudolf overhears the discussion and becomes distressed that Taafe could be close to discovering the truth. Rudolf wanders the streets aimlessly and is discovered by Mary. When Mary asks what is wrong, Rudolf unhappily replies that, while being with Mary has made him happier than he has ever been, he can no longer see her. Mary affectionately convinces Rudolf to put his fears aside and accept the fact that he loves her. The two share a kiss and begin their affair (‚ÄúVertrau in uns / Only Love‚Äù). = Act II = That night, Rudolf suffers a nightmare in which he is tormented and Mary is hanged by a gleeful Taafe and a troupe of masked minions (‚ÄúDie F√§den in der Hand / The Master of the Strings‚Äù). Rudolf awakens from the nightmare screaming Mary‚Äôs name. Mary, who has spent the night with Rudolf, rushes to his side. Rudolf is visibly stirred but Mary is able to comfort him back to calmness. As Mary prepares to leave, Rudolf gives her a ring engraved with the phrase, ‚ÄúUnited in love until death.‚Äù Mary sadly insists that she will never be able to wear it, but Rudolf promises her that she will be able to wear it in Mayerling; until then Rudolf has Mary wear the ring on a chain around her neck so that it may be, ‚Äúthe companion of your heart.‚Äù Suddenly St√©phanie enters the bedroom, causing Mary to run out embarrassed. St√©phanie asks Rudolf what makes Mary different from his past affairs. When Rudolf answers that he loves Mary, St√©phanie flies into a rage promising Rudolf that no matter how much he loves Mary he will never be rid of her and she will be crowned and revered as Empress of Austria (‚ÄúDu bleibst bei mir! / It Will Be Me!‚Äù). Rudolf writes to the Pope, asking that his marriage to St√©phanie be annulled, angering his father. When Franz-Joseph denies the annulment Rudolf threatens to relinquish his title as Crown Prince. Franz-Joseph promises that if Rudolf does so, harm will befall Mary and her family. Franz-Joseph then commands his son to forsake his petition to the Pope and to make no more public appearances. Saddened, Rudolf tells of the torment the burdens of being a prince bring him and expresses his wish to live as an ordinary man (‚ÄúWie jeder andere Mann / An Ordinary Man‚Äù). Rudolf returns to the brothel to wallow in a drunken depression. The prostitutes try to seduce Rudolf but he is not in the mood, going so far as to pull out a gun to scare them off (‚ÄúWiener Schm√§h (reprise) / Viennese Specialties (reprise)‚Äù). When a young new customer arrives, all of the prostitutes shift their attention to him, sharing their vast knowledge of lovemaking (‚ÄúMein s√ºsser Held / New Boy in Town‚Äù). Mary startles Rudolf by appearing in the brothel dressed like the prostitutes. When Rudolf asks her what she is doing there, a visibly hurt Mary retorts that she had spent two weeks looking for Rudolf and when she found him in the brothel she thought that he favored the prostitutes over her, prompting her transformation. Rudolf swears that the prostitutes mean nothing to him, and tries to make Mary understand that he avoided her for her own safety. Mary affirms that she is willing to take the risk, and asks Rudolf when he will be ready to do the same. Mary leaves and Rudolf contemplates suicide. However, Rudolf has an epiphany and instead proclaims that he is ready to stand up against his father and fight for the rights of his people (‚ÄúMut zur tat / Measure of a Man‚Äù). The following day, Rudolf makes a surprise public appearance at an assembly hosted by Taaffe, who was opening a new Viennese exhibition. Rudolf gives a rousing speech to the masses, promising an innovative future in which all citizens will be treated equally, infuriating Taaffe (‚ÄúDer Weg in die Zukunft / The Steps of Tomorrow‚Äù). Marie witnesses the speech and fears that while Rudolf may seem victorious at the moment, his doom is closing in (‚ÄúDie Liebe lenkt / Only Heroes Dare‚Äù). Mary enters a church and runs into St√©phanie. Mary tries to apologize for the affair, but St√©phanie firmly states that while she may always forgive Rudolf she will never forgive Mary. Mary desperately asks St√©phanie why she hates her so much, to which St√©phanie tearfully replies, ‚ÄúBecause he loves you so much.‚Äù Mary leaves a weeping St√©phanie alone to pray. Willigut reports to Taaffe that he saw Rudolf and Mary enter a building with Szeps, and that Rudolf remained with Mary long after Szeps had left. Taafe deduces that it is Mary that is giving Rudolf his new-found courage and plots to separate her from the Crown Prince. Taafe summons Mary to his office and offers a large sum of money and a new estate in Milan for her and her family, if she will call off her affair with Rudolf. Mary bluntly refuses and Taafe promises a bitter end for the two lovers (‚ÄúWenn das Schicksal dich ereilt / The Writing's on the Wall‚Äù). Rudolf visits Marie and asks her to pass on a letter to Mary insisting that she leave Vienna for her safety; for Rudolf plans to commit high treason by signing Szeps‚Äô constitution. Marie does so, pleading with Mary to fulfill her duty to her family by marrying the Duke of Bragan√ßa. Lost in the sorrow of their separation Rudolf and Mary remember their time together, still aching for so much more (‚ÄúSo viel mehr (reprise) / Something More (reprise)‚Äù). Rudolf signs Szeps‚Äô constitution and hands it over to a servant to deliver to Szeps‚Äô associates. However, Rudolf is betrayed and the document is delivered straight into the hands of Taaffe, who in turn hands it over to Franz-Joseph (Zeit zu Handeln (reprise) / Finish What You've Started (reprise)‚Äù). The broken Emperor summons his son and convicts him of high treason, stripping Rudolf of his rank and titles before disowning him. Meanwhile, Mary boards a train out of Vienna. Rudolf runs to the train station, hoping to catch Mary before she leaves, but it appears that he is too late. Rudolf falls to his knees in tears, until he sees Mary approaching. Mary reveals she decided not to leave because she simply could not bear the thought of leaving Rudolf. With all of their hopes and dreams dashed, Rudolf and Mary pronounce each other as the only thing they have left in life (‚ÄúDu bist meine Welt / I Was Born to Love You‚Äù). The two lovers decide that, ‚ÄúIt is better to die all at once than to die a little every day,‚Äù and form a murder-suicide pact. On January 30, 1889 Rudolf finally takes Mary to Mayerling where, after sharing one last kiss, he shoots and kills her before turning the gun on himself (‚ÄúVertrau in uns (reprise) / Only Love (reprise)‚Äù). Production history Rudolf was given a reading in New York City on December 16, 2005 with Rob Evan as Rudolf, Brandi Burkhardt as Mary, and Michael Shawn Lewis as Taafe. As a co-production of Vereinigte B√ºhnen Wien, the Budapest Operetta Theater, and the Szeged Open-Air Festival, it had its world premiere in a Hungarian translation at the Operett Sz√≠nh√°z in Budapest on May 26, 2006, followed by an outdoor staging that opened in Szeged on July 28. Since then, the production has alternated between the two venues, playing in Budapest during the winter months and in Szeged for the summer season. Rudolf was directed by Mikl√≥s G√°bor Ker√©nyi and choreographed by Michael Reardon, √âva Duda, Jen√µ L√µcsei, and L√°szl√≥ Rog√°cs. Musical Direction by Koen Schoots. Gergely Z√∂ldi translated the book, and the Hungarian lyrics are by Z√∂ldi, MG Ker√©nyi, and Szil√°rd Somogyi. The original cast included Attila Dolhai as Rudolf, Bernadett V√°g√≥ as Mary, Tam√°s F√∂ldes as Taaffe, and Attila N√©meth as Franz Joseph. A Vienna production opened at the Raimund Theater on February 26, 2009 directed by David Leveaux and starring Drew Sarich as Rudolf, Lisa Antoni as Mary, and Uwe Kr√∂ger as Taaffe. The cast album for this production was released at the beginning of April 2009. A complete professionally shot version of the Vienna production was released on DVD in October 2009. (Formally September 11, 2009). A complete cast album was released in December 2009. The complete cast album contained the changes to the score and the music left unrecorded on the first cast album. The production closed on January 24, 2010. A second Hungarian production opened on December 10, 2010 in P√©cs. The show was directed by Szil√°rd Somogyi (assistant director of the original Hungarian production), with Zolt√°n B√≥kai as musical director and conductor. In the leading roles: D√©nes Kocsis/√Årp√°d Zsolt M√©sz√°ros as Rudolf, Anna Gy√∂rfi/Bernadett V√°g√≥ as Mary, √Åd√°m Ottlik/Attila G√∂tz as Taaffe, D√°vid Pirgel/ Andr√°s P. Pet≈ëcz as Pfeiffer, Veronika N√°dasi/√âva V√°rhelyi as Stephanie and Katalin Stubendek as Larisch. ((As known, the Hungarian musical theatre doesn't work like lead artist/understudy/standby, but both (or all three) casts are equal.)) Major changes showed up in the interpretation of the songs, and in some places the order of the scenes changed drastically. The opening night was a success, and since then the show is on the repertoire of the National Theatre of P√©cs.

The raid resulted in a high-profile criminal trial of the activists that was seen by many as a referendum on the Vietnam War and as an example of jury nullification. The goal The goal of the group was to make a bold statement in opposition to the war in Vietnam by way of sabotaging the portion of the draft process that was administered through the local draft board in Camden. Their plan was to break into the draft board offices at night and search for, collect, and either destroy or remove the records of all Class 1-A status draft registrants. It was to be both a symbolic and real blow to the process through which tens of thousands of young American men were being drafted and sent to fight in Vietnam. They wrote in a statement before trial:http://www.camden28.org/ > We are twenty-eight men and women who, together with other resisters across > the country, are trying with our lives to say \\"no\\" to the madness we see > perpetrated by our government in the name of the American people ‚Äì the > madness of our Vietnam policy, of the arms race, of our neglected cities and > inhuman prisons. We do not believe that it is criminal to destroy pieces of > paper which are used to bind men to involuntary servitude, which train these > men to kill, and which send them to possibly die in an unjust, immoral, and > illegal war. We stand for life and freedom and the building of communities > of true friendship. We will continue to speak out and act for peace and > justice, knowing that our spirit of resistance cannot be jailed or broken. The group Not all of the group's members were students or \\"hippies,\\" the stereotypical anti-Vietnam War activists. The mostly Catholic group also included four priests and a Protestant minister, people working in education or legal and social services, veterans, and middle-aged parents. One notable member was Frank Pommersheim. Members of the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI were also involved. Informant One group member, Bob Hardy, was opposed to the war but was also secretly opposed to the group's plans to break the law with this action. Feeling torn between loyalty to his friends in the group and his strict law-and-order personal philosophy, Hardy approached the local FBI with his concerns. The FBI encouraged Hardy to remain with the group so that he could pass along information about their activities. Hardy agreed to become an informant, allegedly only after receiving assurances from his FBI handlers that none of the group would ever spend any time in jail for the raid against the draft board. The FBI agreed to finance much of Hardy's role within the group. As an FBI informant, Hardy became heavily involved with the group from a planning and training perspective. As he was a hands-on carpenter and handyman, he helped devise the plan whereby the group could break into the Federal office building within which the draft board was located. He supplied tools (mostly paid for by the FBI), expertise and training. Ladders would be used, windows would be cut with glass cutters, alarms would be bypassed, etc. 2-way radios were supplied by the FBI so that the activists could better communicate and coordinate their actions when the raid was to finally occur. Raid The raid was planned for the early hours of Sunday, August 22, 1971. With the activists all in their positions the raid commenced. Unknown to the activists, the raid was being carefully monitored and documented from the shadows by more than 40 FBI agents. The FBI agents held back and watched as the activists broke into the draft board office and commenced destroying and bagging thousands of draft-related documents. After a significant amount of time passed during which thousands of documents had been handled, the hidden FBI agents were ordered to spring into action and arrest everyone involved. Those arrested, including two Catholic priests and a Protestant minister, became known as the Camden 28. The fact that Bob Hardy had betrayed the activists became readily apparent as the night wore on. Trial By the time that the Camden 28 were brought to trial in the Spring of 1973, their case was viewed by many as a referendum on the Vietnam War. Each of the 28 faced seven felony charges stemming from the raid and more than 40 years in prison if convicted. The 28 chose to be tried together. Immediately prior to the trial they were offered a plea-bargain whereby they would each plead guilty to a single misdemeanor charge and the rest of the charges would be dropped. After intense discussion the 28 decided that they would not take the plea and that as political activists they preferred to be put on trial. Historian Howard Zinn was brought in to testify on behalf of the defendants. Unfortunately for the prosecution, its star witness Bob Hardy was feeling that he had been betrayed by the government. Hardy maintained that from the start of his interaction with the FBI he sought and received assurances that none of his co-conspirators in the raid would see any jail time. Now, as the trial loomed ahead, each of the \\"28\\" was facing more than 40 years in prison. For the FBI and the prosecution, the cost of betraying Hardy in this fashion was to lose him as a friendly witness. Scorned, Hardy would now, in fact, testify extensively for the defense. Hardy would testify regarding the extent to which the FBI encouraged and enabled the raid on the draft board to take place. Through Hardy's testimony, the raid came across as being funded and driven by the FBI, and the defense was able to argue effectively that through the FBI, the government \\"over-reached\\" in its zeal to arrest and prosecute this particular set of anti-war activists. Additionally, it became apparent that the FBI had enabled the plot to form and develop because it believed the Camden group might have been connected to the theft and publication of FBI documents in Media, PA several months prior. In fact, at least two of the Camden defendants (Keith Forsyth and Robert Williamson) had been involved in the Media burglary, though this was not revealed until they stepped forward in 2014.http://www.democracynow.org/2014/1/8/it_was_time_to_do_more Those documents had revealed the COINTELPRO program, and the Camden defendants essentially used their own trial to publicize and question FBI methods. On May 20, 1973, the jury returned \\"not guilty\\" verdicts for all counts against all 28 defendants, acquitting them. Howard Zinn had testified at the trial and recommended civil disobedience and jury nullification. Nearly 50 years after breaking into the Camden draft board and destroying records to protest the war in Vietnam, members of the Camden 28 took to the stand in the federal courtroom where they were tried. Documentary A 2007 documentary film, The Camden 28, has been researched, produced and released by Anthony Giacchino, combining archival footage, contemporary photographs, extensive interviews and analysis into the most comprehensive account of the people, events and history surrounding the Camden 28. The Camden 28 aired in September, 2007 on PBS's P.O.V. independent documentary showcase. Legacy Supreme Court Justice William Brennan called the trial, \\"one of the great trials of the 20th century\\". Father Michael Doyle, one of the 28 who was a Catholic priest at Sacred Heart Church in Camden at the time, remains a priest and community leader there today. The church, led by Doyle, continues to campaign for peace, equality, and social justice and holds an annual Peace Gathering.

Sims. Concise Encyclopedia of Latin American Literature. London: Routledge, 2000. Colombia produced one of the richest literatures of Latin America, as much for its abundance as for its variety and innovation during the 19th and 20th centuries. Colombian intellectuals who forged the literature of this period also contributed decisively to the consolidation of Latin American literature.Rodr√≠guez-Arenas, F. M. (2006).

Conquest and early colonial period (1499-1810)  Juan Rodr√≠guez Freyle was an early writer in the New Kingdom of Granada. His major work El Carnero is a collection of stories, anecdotes and rumours about the early days of colonial Colombia and the demise of the Muisca Confederation Under the Spanish Empire, major literary topics included conquest narratives, chronicles, religious devotion, and love themes. Some of the best-known authors of this period are: * Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada (1496 Antijovio -other sources state 1506 or 1509Graham (1922) page 2There is considerable disagreement about Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada's birth year and place.Suesca, 16 February 1579) - First chronicler as he kept diaries of his own conquests, main conquistador of large parts of Colombia, may have been the (partial) author of Ep√≠tome de la conquista del Nuevo Reino de Granada (not published until 1889), his diaries were published in 1576 * Juan de Castellanos (Alan√≠s, Sevilla, 9 March 1522 - Tunja, November 1606) - Wrote the longest poem ever in the Spanish language, Eleg√≠as de varones ilustres de Indias (1589) * Pedro Sim√≥n (San Lorenzo de la Parrilla, Spain, 1574 - Ubat√©, ca. 1628) - Friar who wrote Noticias historiales de las conquistas de Tierra Firme en las Indias occidentales about the Spanish conquest in 1626 * Juan Rodr√≠guez Freyle (Bogot√°, 25 April 1566 - Bogot√°, 1642) - Spanish priest, wrote the extensive chronicle of the Spanish conquest of the Muisca; El Carnero (\\"The Sheep\\"), first published in 1638 * Hernando Dom√≠nguez Camargo (Bogot√°, 1606 ‚Äì Tunja, 1659) - Jesuit priest and writer.

Emancipation and national consolidation (1780-1830) The republic forces defeated the Spanish Empire in the Battle of Boyac√° During the process of independence, Colombian literature was strongly influenced by the political motivations of the moment. The main literary movements were close to Romanticism. During the nineteenth century, political writing was led by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Local journalism was initiated by Antonio Nari√±o. The Colombian government established the first Academy of Spanish language in the American continent, in 1871. Other relevant authors were: *Camilo Torres Tenorio *Francisco Antonio Zea. *Jos√© Fern√°ndez Madrid (February 19, 1789 ‚Äì June 28, 1830). Costumbrismo Mar√≠a is a novel written by Colombian writer Jorge Isaacs. It is a costumbrist novel representative of the Spanish romantic movement. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the main topic in Colombian literature was the colourful depiction of peasant life, tied to strong criticism of society and government. This type of literature was called costumbrista literature. Some of the authors of this period are: *Tom√°s Carrasquilla *Adolfo Le√≥n G√≥mez *Jos√© Mar√≠a Cordovez Moure *Eustaquio Palacios *Jorge Isaacs *Julio Arboleda *Gregorio Guti√©rrez Gonz√°lez *Rafael Pombo * Soledad Acosta *Josefa Acevedo de Gomez *Candelario Obeso *Manuel Anc√≠zar Modern literature Jos√© Eustasio Rivera in 1928, author of La Vor√°gine, a novel that depicts the brutal slavery of the native American forced to harvest latex from the Para rubber tree. Modernismo and modernism are reactions against the previous literature of Romanticism. Modernism's main topics are ugliness and mystery. The main modern writers are: *Emilia Ayarza *Jose Eustasio Rivera *Rafael Maya *Le√≥n de Greiff *Luis Vidales *Luis Carlos L√≥pez *Germ√°n Arciniegas *Porfirio Barba-Jacob *Jos√© Mar√≠a Vargas Vila Stone and Sky (Piedra y Cielo) The industrialization process in Latin America during the twentieth century generated new literary movements such as the poetic movement named ‚ÄúPiedra y cielo‚Äù (1939). Its main authors are: *Eduardo Carranza *Jorge Gait√°n Dur√°n *Jorge Rojas *Arturo Camacho Ram√≠rez *Augusto Pinilla Nothing-ism (Nada√≠smo) Fernando Gonz√°lez in Nevado del Ruiz Snow Mountain in 1929 during the visits that inspired his work \\"Viaje a pie\\" (\\"Trip By Foot\\"). Gonz√°lez is considered one of the most original writers of Colombia during the 20th century. His ideas were controversial and had a great influence in the Colombian society at his time and today. The Gonz√°lez work was the inspiration of Nadaism, a literary movement founded by one of his disciples, Gonzalo Arango. The violent events in Colombia during the 1940s and 1950s, such as La Violencia and the military government of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, as well as a considerable urban expansion, influenced in the formation of the Nada√≠sta (Nothing-ist) movement, which was the Colombian expression of numerous avant-garde-like movements in the poetry of the Americas during the 1950s and 60s (such as the *Beat Generation in the United States and the Tzanticos in Ecuador). Nada√≠smo included elements of existentialism and nihilism, a dynamic incorporation of city life, and a generally irreverent, iconoclastic flavor. Authors who were part of this movement include: *Gonzalo Arango *Jotamario Arbel√°ez *Eduardo Escobar *Fanny Buitrago *Patricia Ariza *Jaime Jaramillo Escobar The Boom Yellow butterflies are a distinctive feature in 100 Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez The Latin American Boom was a prolific period for Colombian literature. *Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez *Eduardo Caballero Calder√≥n *Manuel Mej√≠a Vallejo *√Ålvaro Mutis *Manuel Zapata Olivella *Andres Caicedo *Alfredo Iriarte *Germ√°n Arciniegas *√Ålvaro Cepeda Samudio Contemporary authors William Ospina. He won the Romulo Gallegos Prize for his novel El pa√≠s de la canela, part of a trilogy about the conquest of the Amazon Disillusioned Generation / Generaci√≥n Desencantada This generation groups a broad and ambiguous list of writers, poets who began to publish after the Nada√≠smo movement (see above) in the 1970s. Poets like Giovanni Quessep, Harold Alvarado Tenorio, Juan Gustavo Cobo Borda, Elkin Restrepo, Jos√© Manuel Arango, Dar√≠o Jaramillo Agudelo, Augusto Pinilla, Mar√≠a Mercedes Carranza, and Juan Manuel Roca among many others, have been considered part of this generation, although they have differences in style, themes and ideology. Recent generations Some writers like Cristian Valencia, Alberto Salcedo Ramos and Jorge Enrique Botero, have written literary journalism, close to Gonzo style. In fiction there are authors like Hector Abad Faciolince, Santiago Gamboa, Juan Sebastian Cardenas, Nahum Montt, Miguel Mendoza Luna, Sebastian Pineda Buitrago, Mauricio Loza, Ignacio Arroyave Piedrh√≠ta, Antonio Garcia, Mario Mendoza, James Canon, Ricardo Abdahllah, Juan Pablo Plata, Evelio Rosero Diago, Antonio Ungar, Laura Restrepo, Ruben Varona, William Ospina, David Alberto Campos, Oscar Perdomo Gamboa, Juan Esteban Constain, Juan √Ålvarez, Andr√©s Del Castillo, Antonio Iriarte Cadena, Esmir Garc√©s, Antonieta Villamil, Winston Morales, Efraim Medina Reyes, Ricardo Silva Romero and many others.http://www.semana.com/international/the-festival-in-colombia-an- international-literary-and-political- gathering/120187-3.aspxhttps://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/19/entertainment/la- ca-culture-colombia-20110619 Recent poetry In recent decades, in Colombia there has been a significant number of poets of importance, who deal with urban issues and anti-poetry. Among them are Antonieta Villamil, Andrea Cote, Lucia Estrada, Felipe Garc√≠a Quintero, whose poetry has been recognized internationally. Poetry Jos√© Asunci√≥n Silva was a Colombian poet. He is considered one of the founders of Spanish‚ÄìAmerican Modernism. * Emilia Ayarza * Jos√© Asunci√≥n Silva * Porfirio Barba-Jacob * Piedad Bonnet * Antonieta Villamil * Jos√© Fern√°ndez Madrid * Jorge Isaacs * Rafael Pombo * Zacar√≠as Rey√°n * Julio Fl√≥rez  Children's literature  Some of the characters most recognized in Colombian children's literature and the popular imaginary are the stock characters created by Rafael Pombo, which are often found in nursery rhymes, familiar folk tales and in the textbooks for elementary school.

It is an unaltered but now-decaying example of an early industrial environment in Burke County. Today the remaining buildings of the Henry River mill village are traces of the industrial heritage of the county. Built as a planned community, the village was a self-contained complex with its own mill, dam, water and fire-protection systems, and company store. In later years the village gained amenities such as walkways, terraced green spaces, and field stone retaining walls. Today most of the village's original buildings remain sited along a small gorge of the Henry River, just west of Catawba County, North Carolina. The site is private property but can be driven through via Henry River Road. It is located a short distance from Interstate 40 via an exit near Hildebran. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. History =20th century= In 1904 Michael Erastus Rudisill laid out the mill and village on a 1,500-acre tract, chosen for its hydro power potential. Rudisill, along with his brother Albert Pinkney Rudisill, built the village and engineered the dam and mill building along with David William Aderholdt, Miles R. Rudisill, and Marcus Lafayette Aderholdt. The mill was incorporated as the Henry River Manufacturing Company. The company manufactured fine cotton yarns. Beginning in 1905, a 30-foot reinforced concrete dam was constructed with a three-story brick mill building. In its early years, the mill operated 4,000 yarn-making spindles. By the time it shut down in the late 1960s, the mill had 12,000 spindles and produced fine combed yarn for lace. The residential area of the village consisted of approximately 35 small worker's cottages. These 1-1/2 story duplex houses were laid out along the steep contours of the river's northern bank. The workers lived in boarding houses or workers' cottages built by the company, which were leased at nominal fees. Around 1907 the four mill owners, the Rudisills and the Aderholdts, built new homes for themselves just outside the village. Although one burned in 1935, three of the four houses are still standing today. Since the loss of the main mill building, the centerpiece of the village today is the two-story brick company store building. This building served as a mill office with the upper floor used as a school room and for church services from 1907-1917. In 1912 a steel truss bridge engineered by the Rudisills was built across the Henry River. When built, it was reputed to be the highest bridge in the state. During the 1916 flood this bridge was one of the few not destroyed. In 1960 a new concrete bridge replaced the steel truss bridge. The Henry River Mill originally ran on waterpower. In 1914 a steam plant was installed then in 1926, the mill was converted to electric power. The mill closed in 1971 and was purchased by Wade Shepherd in 1976. Shepherd owned other mills and intended to restore the mill when it burned in 1977; lightning was the suspected cause. =21st century= The mill and village were put on the North Carolina Study List of the National Register of Historic Places. Late in 2002, through the Burke County Partners in Economic Development's Heritage Preservation Committee, efforts began to explore development of the historic site. The 72 acre village was a filming location of \\"District 12\\" scenes of the 2012 film The Hunger Games. In the wake of the film's release, The SyFy Channel‚Äôs show ‚ÄúHollywood Treasure‚Äù estimated the value of the property at more than $1.2 million in 2012 and took bids (unsuccessfully) to sell it. A book about the town and its people was published in 2012. In 2017, the abandoned property was purchased by local residents whose vision is to create a \\"Henry River Mill Village Business District\\" to highlight the history of the site. The company store was damaged by a tornado late in 2017, but because the windows had been broken by vandals, thus limiting air pressure, major damage to the building was averted. The new owner has plans to turn that building into a restaurant. Twenty of the thirty- five mill houses remained, and twelve more were to be added, to be occupied by tourists. Mill artifacts would be placed in a museum.

Wolfe Jr. is a higher education consultant and retired administrator who served as president of Kentucky State University from 1990‚Äì1991 and president of Savannah State College from 1993 until 1997. Biography =Education= Wolfe was born in Mississippi and grew up in Chicago, Illinois. He graduated from St. Philip Basilica High School in Chicago, Illinois in 1960. He earned a BS.Ed. from Chicago Teachers College in 1964. In 1972 he earned an M.S. in English Education from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. He later earned a Ph.D. in linguistics from Purdue University in 1976. =Career=  Fayetteville State University  In 1980, Wolfe was appointed Head for the Division of Humanities and Fine Arts at Fayetteville State University. He was named Assistant Dean of Academic Affairs following his internship as an ACE Fellow in the Chancellor's Office and in February 1985, Dr. Wolfe was named Acting Dean of Academic Affairs.  Bowie State University  Wolfe was Provost of Bowie State University from 1985 to June 30, 1990.  Kentucky State University  Wolfe was the 12th president of Kentucky State University, from 1990 until 1991. Wolfe‚Äôs inauguration as university president was cancelled by the university's Board of Regents , and three regents resigned rather than approve his administrative appointments. Student leaders and the president of the state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People called for the chairman of the board to resign for racial insensitivity, as the chairman was white and the administrators were Black. Wolfe resigned amid an investigation by the university Board of Regents into potential financial misconduct, who accused him of spending too much on the president‚Äôs official house, mishandling some personnel matters and giving himself a 9.5 percent pay raise without board approval, in possible violation of his contract. Students marched on the Kentucky State Capitol in his support, due to wanting to preserve the university's status as a historically black institution and fear that if Mr. Wolfe were fired, the regents would move to change that mission. Wolfe reportedly tried to inaugurate Afro-centric programs during what observers said was a ‚Äòwhite takeover of the institution.‚Äô  Savannah State University  Wolfe was the tenth president of Savannah State College, which was renamed Savannah State University during his tenure. He served as president from 1993 to 1997. During his tenure, the Public Administration and Social Work graduate programs returned to the institution and Savannah State College was elevated by the Georgia Board of Regents to state university status. Wolfe also oversaw the highest enrollment in Savannah State‚Äôs history, which grew to over 3,200 students during the 1994 and 1995 school years. He created the university‚Äôs first Faculty Senate and secured $12 million to build a 5,000-seat athletic complex and $1 million for a new track and field facility. His support of grant writing led to a 100% increase in funded proposals during his time at Savannah State from $7.11 million to $14.3 million. When he was hired, Wolfe was charged with improving management and accountability on campus. During that process, a number of popular Savannah employees were let go and locked out of their offices. Petitions, student protests, and a vote of no-confidence from faculty, staff and alumni followed. After leading Savannah State University for four years, he requested not to be reappointed for another academic year, and accepted a position as Associate Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs at the University System of Georgia‚Äôs offices.  NCAA  In 1996, while president of Savannah State College, Wolfe was selected to serve as one of the NCAA‚Äôs Division II Presidents Council Transition Team members along with 12 other chief executive officers.  University System of Maryland  Wolfe was appointed Associate Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs at the University System of Maryland on January 3, 2006. His primary responsibility was to \\"articulate and promote the system's vision on diversity as outlined in the USM strategic plan\\" and to be the \\"primary point of contact on diversity issues on a national level and within the university system.\\" In the position, he also played a role in developing both system academic policies and positions and academic leadership among all faculty at USM, and in coordinating workshops, seminars, and other system-sponsored programs. Wolfe retired from the University System of Maryland in 2017 and soon after was invited to present at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, Diversity Advisory Council (DAC) Speaker Series, giving a talk entitled 'Managing Conflict: Cooperating and Collaborating Even When We Disagree‚Äú. \\"Disruption is a part of life. You have to anticipate it,‚Äù he shared, ‚ÄúI have been a disrupter. I have had to mediate and mitigate, and I found that in order to make diversity and inclusion work, you have to find a common ground.‚Äù  Published Works  In 2015, Wolfe wrote a chapter focusing on diversity in Historically Black Colleges and Universities that was published in the book Exploring Issues of Diversity in HBCUs. In the book, Wolfe argues that, since many White institutions offer Black studies programs, HBCUs should offer Whiteness dialogue courses so students can ‚Äúunderstand on many levels what White privilege is and how it affects their psychosocial, political, and economic well-being.‚Äù In 2020, Wolfe co-authored a chapter titled, ‚ÄúExamining Barriers to Minority Faculty Contributions in Higher Education‚Äù that was published in the book Disparities in the Academy: Accounting for the Elephant. Wolfe has published work on topics including literary criticism, linguistics, career development, curriculum, English dialectology, diversity, and photography. Wolfe is thanked by the producers in the credits of the film Dominica: Charting a Future for Paradise (2011), a short documentary about the history of the country of Dominica.

The Sea Gull was one of six ships that sailed in the US Exploring Expedition (known as the US Ex. Ex.) in 1838 to survey the coast of the then-unknown continent of Antarctica and the Pacific Islands. The specimens collected on the voyage would later form the backbone of the Smithsonian Institution. Acquisition Formerly the New York pilot boat New Jersey, the ship was purchased by the Navy in July 1838 and renamed USS Sea Gull. She was outfitted with a new mast and sails in three days' time, and under the command of Passed Midshipman James W. E. Reid, sailed for Hampton Roads to join the expedition as a tender. The US Exploring Expedition At Norfolk, Virginia the Sea Gull joined the other ships of the expedition: flagship , , , the schooner , and the supply ship . The ships left Norfolk on August 18, 1838, for the tip of South America, where they would await the slower Relief and then continue to Antarctica and the Pacific Islands. After surveying and collecting specimens, the remaining ships would sail to Hawaii and then the Columbia River to survey that area then return to the United States via the Cape of Good Hope on June 9, 1842. The Sea Gull, commanded by Lieutenant Robert Johnson and in the company of the Porpoise, headed south from Orange Bay on the tip of South America on February 25, 1839, to explore the area of the South Shetland Islands. Both ships encountered heavy seas which resulted in a broken gaff for the Sea Gull; the crew was constantly drenched by huge waves. Soon they encountered snow squalls and penguins. Huge icebergs were sighted, some said to be as large as the U.S. Capitol building. On March 1, some islands of the South Shetlands were sighted. Attempts were made to land on the islands and gather specimens but the seas proved too rough to make a landing. On March 5, the wind increased to a whole gale and the commander of the expedition ‚Äî Lt. Charles Wilkes ‚Äî ordered the ships about and headed north. Wilkes ordered Johnson to proceed back to Orange Bay after stopping at Deception Island to attempt to retrieve a self-reading thermometer left there by an earlier British expedition. After removing ice from the ship's rigging, the crew of the Sea Gull headed for Deception. The crew didn't find the thermometer but did experience the volcanism of the island finding it frightening and unnerving to know they were standing on an active volcano. Eventually the ship made its way to Orange Bay. After reaching Orange Bay the Sea Gull participated in a search for a missing crew in a survey launch, finding the launch eventually safe and sound with all aboard. = Loss of the Sea Gull= On April 17, 1839, Wilkes left Orange Bay in Vincennes with Porpoise for Valpara√≠so, Chile and ordered the schooners Flying Fish and Sea Gull to wait ten days for the supply ship Relief. If the Relief didn't arrive they were to transport the scientists aboard to Valpara√≠so. On May 19, the Flying Fish arrived in Valpara√≠so and the Sea Gull was nowhere in sight. The Sea Gull, under the command of passed midshipman James Reid, was last seen waiting out a gale in the lee of Staten Island off Cape Horn. After a month or so, the officers of the Ex. Ex. assumed the Sea Gull was lost and took up a collection for a monument to their memory. That monument stands in the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It lists the names of the officers who were lost on the Sea Gull and the names of two officers who were killed during the survey of the Pacific Islands. No mention was made of the other 24 sailors and marines who died during the expedition. References *Philbrick, Nathaniel (2003).

It is 3.4√ó28, meaning 3.4x magnification, and a 28mm diameter objective lens. A tritium illuminated reticle provides for normal and low-light conditions sighting. The sight itself is nitrogen-purged to prevent fogging and is covered with an armoured coating of rubber. It can be mounted to a variety of rifles and light machine guns using the M1913 Picatinny rail mounting system or the similar \\"Diemaco\\" rail system found on small arms produced by Diemaco/Colt Canada. It is manufactured by Elcan and can be found on military service weapons around the world. Its Elcan product name is the SpecterOS3.4x, although in Canadian service, it is typically referred to as the C79 or the C79A2. Similar rifle sights are the Sight Unit Small Arms, Trilux (SUSAT) and the Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG). Use A Canadian soldier with a C7A1 assault rifle equipped with a C79 Canadian soldiers training with C9A1 light machine guns equipped with a C79 Adopted in 1989, the Elcan C79 is the primary sighting system for the small arms of the Canadian Forces and is mounted on the Diemaco C7 and C7A2 assault rifles, the C8 Carbine family, as well as the C9A1 Light Machine Gun. It is also used in the armies of Denmark, the Royal Netherlands Army and Netherlands Marine Corps and Norway. In Canadian service, all C7A1 and -A2 rifles come equipped with a C79 sight as standard. The C7A1 uses a C79 sight, which is easily distinguished by its matte black rubber overcoating. After reviewing feedback from the soldiers who used the sight, Elcan produced the fourth generation mount C79, known as the C79A2, and is mounted onto the C7A2 rifle, as well as the C8A3 carbines. The C79A2 sight is a component of the C7A2 mid-life update program of the Canadian Forces' inventory of C7A1 rifle systems. The older rifles and sights are meant to be exchanged 1:1 and brought to the -A2 standard. In Dutch service it is used on the Diemaco C7 (regular infantry), C7A1 (airmobile infantry) and C8, FN Minimi and FN MAG series of firearms. Reticle The reticle of the C79 sight was designed to serve on the C9 Light Machine Gun, thus an appropriate pattern was chosen to aid the gunner in judging distance. The reticle consists of a single vertical post with a sharp tip in the center. The tip is flanked by horizontal Mil-bars on either side. Under the left-hand Mil-bar, a second horizontal bar was added for judging distances, where the distance between the two bars would equate to 76 cm at 300 m. The (radioactive) tritium light source is an unstable isotope with a half-life of 12.32 years that gradually loses its brightness due to radioactive decay. It is to be replaced every 8‚Äì12 years to maintain adequate brightness. Operation C79 3.4√ó28 sight adjustment controls The C79 sight is attached to a mounting rail on the receiver of the weapon. On CF weapons, this is in the form of a modified Weaver rail, also known as a \\"Diemaco rail\\". Two adjustment knobs are used to secure the base to the receiver. A bore-sighting device is usually used to roughly zero the sight before a first-time shooter takes it to the range. Adjustments come in 0.25-mil clicks (one mil equals 10 cm at a range of 100 m, so each click adjusts the sight by 2.5 cm at 100 m). Sighting in a C79 sight is normally done at a range of 200 m. Windage adjustments are made on the left hand side of the base, using a flat object such as a flat-head screwdriver or a coin. The windage adjustment is intended only for the initial sighting in procedure of the C79. Elevation adjustments are made via a rotary knob and are adjusted from 200 to 800 m. To bring the sight to a proper elevation zero, a small \\"gate\\" must be elevated which disconnects the elevation cam and one mil clicks can now be made. For precise shooting, the gate is usually left open to allow for finer adjustments than the rougher presets. Target shooters will sometimes mark pre-established open gate adjustments with whiteout pens to remind them how many clicks must be made for each range. At close ranges, when rapid aiming is required, the emergency battle sights on top of the sight can be used, although they are very crude and only intended for use inside of 75 m. It has been noted that the external adjustments mount is an Achilles heel of the C79 since it can be jammed by foreign matter and also adds to the weight of the sight.

The current issue model features an improved mounting system for better return to zero. The C79A2 has a green rubber armored cover to help the optic blend in with the Canadian CADPAT uniform. The A2 series is the optics mid life upgrade for the C7A2 program as the tritium needs to be replaced every 8 to 12 years of service.\\"C79A2\\" is engraved on the left side of the optic mounting base. This model is used on C7A2 rifles and C8A3 carbines. The United States also uses this optic on some of its M4 Carbines. Versions of this optic are made available for the civilian market from Armament Technologies in Nova Scotia Canada. =M145 Machine Gun Optic= M240B machine gun. The M145 Machine Gun Optic is a variant of the C79 that was developed for the U.S. Army and is commonly mounted on M240 and M249 machine guns. The M145 is unusual when compared with other optical sights in use with the United States military in that ballistic compensation is in the mount, rather than in the reticle. The reticle is illuminated by a battery-powered LED with varying intensity settings. The mount fits directly to any MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail or receiver. Zero is retained despite repeated removal and re-attachment to the weapon. The M145 is extremely resistant to shock and water immersion and has an anti-reflection device and rubber lens caps. The M145 also uses a unique reticle system designed for machineguns wherein there is no single particular crosshair zeroed at a certain distance but instead the sight uses several smaller crosshairs that are marked with specific distances. The machinegun's projectile ballistics are zeroed to match these specific distances so that users can quickly engage targets at extended ranges without having to adjust the sight. =M145 M4 Optic= The M145 M4 is a variant of the M145 Machine Gun Optic with a 'M4' reticle that is optimized for use on a 5.56x45 M4 Carbine, M16 rifle and derivatives. Aside from the reticle, it is the same mechanically and optically as the M145 Machine Gun Optic.

It is a single span Burr Arch Truss covered bridge structure that was built by D. M. Brown in 1907. Note: This includes , Site map, and Accompanying photographs. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History The bridge crosses Mill Creek near land that was owned by Thornton Thompson. Though Thompson's Ford was probably named after Joseph Thompson who built a small mill nearby in 1829. It's also been suggested that Earl Ray Covered Bridge comes from a prominent nearby citizen and well known auctioneer. The name Tow Path Covered Bridge comes from the fact that Tow Path Road crosses the bridge. The Wabash and Erie Canal crossed Mill creek just to the south of where the bridge is built. The towpath for the canal was later turned into a road, south of the bridge where the canal ran parallel to the current road, when the canal was discontinued. The actual towpath wasn't near the bridge however. The canal had been out of use for many years by the time the bridge was built but an aqueduct that crossed the creek was occasionally used as a bridge after the canal was drained. Joseph J. Daniels had sent in a bid for the bridge on May 18, 1899, for $1,485 for the superstructure or $2,520 including the abutments. D.M. Brown was awarded the contract so apparently his bid was for less. However, Mr. Brown had so much trouble getting the bridge started that he had to hire William Hendricks, who had more experience, for the direct construction.

History The Citizens Motorcar Company, known as America's Packard Museum, is a restored Packard dealership transformed into a museum that displays twentieth-century classic Packards and historic Packard artifacts and memorabilia. Originally, The Citizens Motorcar Company sold Packards in Dayton, Ohio beginning in 1908, and moved into what is now the museum building in 1917. Robert Signom II, the museum's Founder and Curator for 27 years, acquired the building in 1991 and painstakingly rehabilitated it to its original Art Deco grandeur. The original 20' tall porcelain and neon Packard sign, removed from the building in the early 1940s, returned to its former position at the corner of Ludlow and Franklin Streets in 1992 for the grand opening of the museum. Since that time, the museum has grown in size and stature, winning the James Bradley Award of the Society of Automotive Historians in 2004. Car Collector magazine also named the museum one of the \\"Top Ten\\" automotive museums in the United States. More than 50 cars are on display, from 1900s Brass Era cars, the streamlined Classic cars of the 1930s and 1940s, to the modern Packards of the 1950s, as well as war machines, parts, accessories, and original sales and service literature. A notable highlight of America's Packard Museum is the original Articles of Incorporation of the Ohio Automobile Company, which later became Packard Motor Car Company. In 2019, Robert Signom III was named Curator to continue the legacy of Packard, and the mission and vision of the museum founded by his father. America's Packard Museum is a Section 501(c)(3) non-profit organization under the Internal Revenue Code. The museum is open 12:00noon to 5:00pm, seven days a week, year round, and is closed only on Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day.

It became a number 18 hit on the U.S. pop singles chart, and rose to number 27 on the UK Singles Chart. \\"The Good Life\\" became one of Bennett's staple songs, and was featured on four of his top-selling albums, including 1994's MTV Unplugged: Tony Bennett and 2006's Duets: An American Classic, the latter featuring Billy Joel. Bennett also named his 1998 autobiography after the song. As of 2009, he still performs the song live and often jokingly dedicates it to Britney Spears. In 1973, the song was released by Julius La Rosa as a single 45 record on vinyl, with \\"Save Me a Song\\" on side B, on RCA's Victor label. It became a hit at Metromedia radio station WNEW, 1130 on the AM dial, in New York City. And Julius La Rosa was also a disc jockey there, playing his own song. This version of the song had slightly altered lyrics. Uniquely arranged and conducted by Hal Massimino, the biggest change was in the main lyric, where \\"goodbye\\" was replaced with \\"hello.\\" A version of the song, sung by Tony Orlando, was used as the theme song of the short lived sitcom of the same name, starring Larry Hagman. Orlando's version was subsequently released on Bell Records.

He served as an assistant coach at Villanova University and Yale University before coming to the University of Virginia in 1976 as an assistant coach for Terry Holland. Littlepage's alma mater Penn hired him as head coach in 1982. He then was hired as head coach by Rutgers University in 1985. After Littlepage was dismissed as head coach of the Scarlet Knights in 1988, he returned to Virginia and again served as an assistant until 1990 when Holland resigned and was replaced by Jeff Jones. University of Virginia On August 21, 2001, University of Virginia President John T. Casteen III announced Littlepage's appointment to be the ninth Virginia Athletics Director.

In 2003, following a controversial performance by the Virginia Pep Band at the 2002 Continental Tire Bowl in which the band lampooned the home state of the opposing West Virginia Mountaineers and was banned from any future performance at the bowl, Littlepage banned the Pep Band from participating in any Cavalier varsity sports. A donation from Carl Smith allowed the formation of the Cavalier Marching Band. In 2006, he headed the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Committee. The committee's most prominent duty was to select the 65 teams that participate in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. At the beginning of the 2008 football season, Littlepage briefly banned signs from all school athletic events. Following a student protest at the school's second home game of the season, in which ESPN's Rick Reilly encouraged students to bring in blank signs and signs that said, \\"This is not a sign,\\" Littlepage repealed the ban. Among the head coaching hires Littlepage has made at Virginia includes Dave Leitao and Tony Bennett for men's basketball, Joanne Boyle for women's basketball, Brian O'Connor in baseball, and Mike London and Bronco Mendenhall in football.

She had been designed and laid down for the East India Company, but the Navy purchased her after the start of the French Revolutionary War. She served at the Battle of Camperdown and during the Napoleonic Wars. Hulked in 1815, she was broken up in 1834. Construction and commissioning Monmouth was originally being built as an East Indiaman for the East India Company under the name Belmont. In 1796 the Navy purchased five ships being built or serviced in commercial dockyards along the River Thames and had them completed as warships. Alongside Belmont, then being built at Rotherhithe by Randall & Company, the Navy acquired the merchantmen Royal Admiral, Princess Royal, Earl Talbot and Pigot; they became , , and respectively. Belmont was registered and named Monmouth on 14 July 1795 and was launched on 23 April 1796, being completed by 31 October 1796 at Deptford Dockyard. French Revolutionary Wars HMS Monmouth was commissioned in September 1796 under the command of the Captain William Carnegie, Earl of Northesk. She was initially assigned to serve in the North Sea, and in May 1797 was one of the ships involved in the Nore mutiny. The crew took her first lieutenant, Charles Bullen, prisoner and threatened to execute him. Northesk intervened and Bullen was able to carry messages from the crew that are said to have helped end the mutiny. After the mutiny Northesk resigned his commission. Order was restored in a matter of weeks, and Monmouth was placed under Commander James Walker, in an acting captaincy. Walker had been planning to attack the mutinous ships at anchor with a squadron of gunboats only a few weeks previously. Walker commanded Monmouth at the Battle of Camperdown in October 1797. Admiral Adam Duncan led the fleet to meet the Dutch. Before the battle Walker addressed his crew, saying: > \\"Now, my lads, you see your enemy before you. I shall lay you close on > board, and thus give you an opportunity of washing the stain off your > characters with the blood of your foes. Go to your quarters, and do your > duty.\\" Monmouth engaged in heavy combat with the Dutch ships Delft and Alkmaar, capturing both, although Delft sank on the way back.The United Service Journal and Naval and Military Magazine. 1. H. Colburn and R. Bentley. 1832. Page 203. In the battle Monmouth had five men killed and 22 wounded. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Camperdown\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. In March 1798, Robert Deans became captain. Monmouth was among the seven vessels of Lord Duncan's fleet that shared in the prize money for the privateer Jupiter, captured on 27 April. In January 1799 Vice-Admiral Archibald Dickson raised his flag in her, but she then went into Sheerness in March for repairs. Next month, Captain George Hart, who retained the command until 1805, replaced Deans. Then Monmouth was among the vessels sharing in the prize money from sundry Dutch doggers, schuyts, and fishing vessels, taken in April and May. Monarch was also part of a squadron that in May captured Roose (12 May), Genet, Polly, American, Forsigtigheid, and Bergen (all 14 May), Des Finch (21 May), and Vrow Dorothea (30 May). That summer, Monmouth took part in the Helder expedition, a joint Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland under the command of Vice-Admiral Andrew Mitchell. At the Neiuw Diep the British captured seven warships and 13 Indiamen and transports. Then Mitchell obtained the surrender of a squadron of the navy of the Batavian Republic in the Vlieter Incident. The Dutch surrendered twelve vessels ranging down in size from the 74-gun Washington to the 16-gun brig Galathea. Next, Monmouth was among the vessels sharing in the capture on 17 August of Adelarde. On 15 September Monmouth, several other British vessels and two Russian, arrived at Sheerness as escort to five Dutch ships of the line, three frigates and one sloop.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 2, p.350. Monmouth sailed for the Mediterranean in June 1801. She therefore came to share in the proceeds of the capture of Almas di Purgatoria off Alexandria on 28 July. Because Monmouth served in the navy's Egyptian campaign (8 March to 8 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorised in 1850 for all surviving claimants. Napoleonic Wars Monmouth (1797) modified for the Royal Navy In 1803 Monmouth, still under Hart's command, was at Gibraltar. There Hart received the report of Captain John Gore of of his capture of one French felucca-rigged privateer in the Strait, Esperance, and destruction of another, the Sorcier. In July Monmouth was with the Mediterranean squadron blockading Toulon. After his promotion to rear admiral in April 1804 Thomas McNamara Russell raised his flag in Monmouth for the North Sea. Captain Edward Durnford King commissioned Monmouth again in March 1807. Rear-Admiral William O'Bryen Drury raised his flag in her on 7 September and then eight days later sailed her with a convoy of nine Indiamen to the East Indies, seven for the coast and two for Bombay. The convoy was reported well on 28 November at . The vessels she was convoying included , Sarah Christiana, Ann, Union, Diana, Sir William Pulteney, and Glory.Lloyd's List 1 March 1808, ‚Ññ4233. During the voyage, on 25 January 1808 she captured the Danish ship Nancy. Then on 12 February she arrived off the Danish possession of Tranquebar just in time to observe the landing of troops of the 14th Regiment of Foot and the Honourable East India Company's artillery by . The British immediately went on to capture the settlement and fort, which capitulated without resistance.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 20, p.145.East India Man with the Fleet sailing from St Helena, under convoy of His Majesty's ship Monmouth in 1808 Monmouth returned to Britain in September 1808, having escorted another convoy of Indiamen.Marshall (1824), Vol.2, pp.326-7. She was put out of commission on 24 September. In August 1809 Monmouth was at the Walcheren Expedition, the aim of which was to demolish the dockyards and arsenals at Antwerp, Terneuzen, and Flushing. In August Admiral Sir Richard Strachan sent her back to England for water. In October she was commissioned again under Commander Michael Dod, but as a victualing ship in the Downs. His successor on 7 November 1810 was Captain Francis Beauman.O'Byrne (1849), p.63. At the time Monmouth was the flagship of Vice- Admiral George Campbell, Commander-in-Chief of the Downs station. In March Beauman presented a sword (worth 100 guineas) to Campbell on behalf of all the captains and commanders on the Downs station on the occasion of Campbell's being relieved of his command.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 26, p.30. In April 1811 Captain Hyde Parker took command of Monmouth. From 1812 to 1813 she was under the command of Captain William Nowell. His successor was Captain William Wilkinson. Throughout this time she was also the flagship for Vice-Admiral Thomas Foley, Campbell's successor. She received payment for smuggled goods seized on 1 March 1814. Fate Monmouth was laid up in ordinary at Woolwich in 1815. She then was hulked, becoming a sheer hulk at Deptford dockyard. She was broken up in 1834.

ABS-CBN senior vice president for news and current affairs Maria Ressa later wrote a letter of apology to AKP. According to Chipeco, a candidate does not need endorsers if he had a platform of governance in which the people will base their votes. He also said that his and JC de los Reyes's edge over the others are that they are not ‚Äútrapo‚Äù or traditional politicians. Chipeco added that the Office of the Ombudsman was put up to deal with corruption. He pointed that at present it was the Senate that was conducting investigations, and parties found liable were not being jailed. Chipeco and his presidential running-mate JC de los Reyes, said that if elected, they will implement the anti-dynasty provisions in the 1987 Constitution. In an interview with GMA7, when asked about his low ratings in surveys, Chipeco said that ratings results are not the sole basis of a candidate's success or failure. Poll surveys create a bandwagon effect, he said. When asked by Jejomar Binay if he will prosecute Gloria Macapagal Arroyo if he is elected vice-president, Chipeco said that he is unsure if he has the power to prosecute Arroyo. However, if the evidence is strong enough, the case should be pursued, following the justice process. He is in 8th place based on COMELEC, PPCRV and the official canvassing of the Congress.

On PBS, he claimed that \\"what started as isolated clashes quickly became a political opportunity for these people to put their situation at the forefront of the political debate to make headlines with their own situations,\\" although he also underlined \\"a pervasive, very dark racism in French society that associates the second generation Muslims, these second generation immigrants with trouble.\\"Rioting continues in France, PBS, November 7, 2005 According to his (now deleted) online biography at George Washington University's Homeland Security Policy Institute (a US governmental think tank), Debat is additionally claimed to have worked as an analyst for the French government on the Counter-Terrorism Coordinating Committee, as an expert on Islamic finance and Islamic law for clients such as Deutsche Bank and the Japan External Trade Organization, as a contractor for the RAND think tank, as advisor for the Business for Diplomatic Action consortium, and once again for the French government as \\"a desk officer for the Ministry of Defense.\\"Online biography of Debat at George Washington University's Homeland Security Policy Institute, archived by the Internet Archive According to Jeffrey Schneider from ABC, suspicions were aroused when the French government, in May 2007, told them that they were skeptical concerning Debat's scholarship credentials.Guillemette Faure, ABC NEWS investigates one of its terrorism experts, Rue 89, September 12, 2007 Original article Thereafter, ABC launched an investigation which in June 2007 led to his resignation, before inspecting all of his preceding work for ABC. Rue 89, however, pointed out that according to the French government, ABC was the first to contact the French embassy, and not otherwise. The latter answered them that it was not their job to verify credentials. Thereafter, ABC requested to the French embassy the contacts of the French Minister of Defence in order to verify this point in Debat's Curriculum Vitae. This point was later confirmed by ABC itself, who declared that they had made a mistake. Rue 89 later announced that a whistleblower inside ABC News had launched an unofficial investigation on Debat in May 2007.Pascal Rich√©, A whistleblower alerted ABC News about the reliability of its consultant, Rue 89, September 14, 2007 Furthermore, two journalists at ABC have claimed that Debat's sensational articles were in fact supported by Brian Ross, ABC chief investigative correspondent. AP news agency has stated that ABC was now sending long time Ross producer Rhonda Schwartz to Pakistan to counter-check Debat's articles. Rue 89, however, questions ABC News' decision to let the control of the investigation to Brian Ross, who was Alexis Debat's direct superior. This inquiry into Debat's work as a consultant cleared his reporting, according to ABC News President David Westin (see above). Early warnings Alexis Debat's credentials had been called into question once. A spokesperson for the French defense Department asked Lib√©ration in September 2002 to run a correction after the French newspaper quoted Debat, presented as an \\"official at the French Defense Ministry\\", on the role Zacarias Moussaoui played in the September 11 attacks. The defense correspondent in Lib√©ration, Jean Dominique Merchet, then published the correction, stating that Debat was not currently a defense official, but had been in the past. The AFP news agency also contradicted ABC News on September 6, 2002 by reporting that Debat (who was then interviewed in the case concerning Zacarias Moussaoui) had never been an \\"official\\" but a \\"desk officer\\" at the French Defence Ministry.AFP, French ministry denies source named in US TV terror report is ex-official, September 6, 2002 After allegedly looking into the matter, ABC News continued to present him as \\"former official in the French Minister of Defense\\"Brian Ross, Is Saddam's Son More Brutal Than His Dad?, ABC News, February 14, 2003 -- according to Rue 89, he did make a brief passage at the D√©l√©gation aux Affaires strat√©giques (Delegation of Strategic Affairs).

Geography Gary is located at 27.955855 degrees north and 82.4281495 degrees west. The elevation of the area is 25 ft above sea level. Gary has no official boundaries, however, the USGS has listed the area as a populated place. Other areas in Gary are Palmetto Beach and East Ybor. History =Entomology= The name Gary was officially recognized with the establishment of the Gary post office in 1898. The official plat of \\"Gary- Town\\" was recorded in May 1903. The Gary neighborhood included both Gary-Town and Spanish Park, located to its east. The neighborhood's boundaries extended from 26th Street on the west to 40th Street on the east. The population included Anglos, Italians, Spaniards and Cubans. Celery farming played a prominent role in Gary. The neighborhood also included cigar factories, a citrus packing house, dairies, a blacksmith shop, churches, boarding houses and several retail establishments. =Logistics= Gary, located to the east of Ybor City just east of 30th Street, incorporated on Oct. 9, 1915. Its settlement goes back a dozen years earlier, when the Hendry & Knight Real Estate Co. subdivided the \\"Celebrated Neyland's Celery Farm Land\\" and put it up for sale in April 1903. The company took out a full-page advertisement in the May 3, 1903, Tampa Tribune. The ad featured the legal plot of \\"Garytown\\" along with a glowing description of the potential for real estate investors. Interestingly, the ad was printed in three languages (English, Spanish and Italian), which shows the multicultural nature of Tampa and Ybor City at that time. The original plot of Gary was fairly small. The Atlantic Coast Line railroad tracks just north of Sixth Avenue served as the southern boundary and 11th Avenue was the northern boundary, while 26th Street and 28th Street served as the western and eastern limits. Those boundaries shifted to the east and grew considerably when Gary was incorporated. The new limits were (starting from the north): 21st Avenue (Wall Street) east to 37th Street and the Tampa Northern Railroad tracks, then south to Hillsborough Bay, west to 30th Street, then back north to 21st Avenue. The City of Gary was incorporated in October 1915. The municipal boundaries stretched from 30th Street on the west to 37th Street on the east and Wall Street (21st Avenue) on the north to the bay on the south. The state legislature abolished the City of Gary in 1919. Then, in 1923, the City of Tampa extended its boundaries to encompass the former City of Gary. After World War II, an African American population moved into Gary. In the 1960s, Interstate 4 cut through the neighborhood, destroying many homes. The Gary School was recognized by the City of Tampa as an historical landmark in 2005. =Railroads= Gary was an important wye for the Seaboard Air Line Railroad. It was used as a runaround and turning point for passenger trains such as the Silver Meteor and the Floridian to enter Tampa Union Station. It was also used for trains to access the Clearwater subdivision to service stations in Clearwater, Pinellas Park and St Petersburg, Florida. In 1984, Amtrak discontinued its service to Clearwater and the wye was torn up. Once a busy location of train activity, the area has been reduced to a few local freight trains each day. Passenger trains now use the former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad tracks to enter and leave Tampa Union Station. Industrial Development Gary started having industrial development by now nearly in Ybor City, Gary did have several cigar factories. The Tierra del Lago Cigar Co. was originally at 1908 N 36th St. and remained there until 1919. The cigar company then moved to the corner of 18th Street and Pansy Avenue (between 21st and 22nd Avenues), where it remained until late 1926. The building still stands on the corner of Ninth Avenue and 36th Street and is used by the True Love Missionary Baptist Church. Large firms that would eventually call Ybor City home also operated in Gary. The Arguelles & Co. firm worked out of a building at Third Avenue and 31st Street; J.D. Greenless had a factory on Eighth Avenue between 36th and 37th Streets; and A. Ramirez & Co. operated a factory on 35th Street. Growth in Gary was quick, and the need for government services was met almost as quickly. On July 27, 1904, trustees for the \\"new Gary school district\\" met and decided to build a school. It was to be a two-story 26- by 50-foot structure, projected to cost $600. The Gary School survived for 101 years, from 1910 to 2011, at 3610 10th Ave. before neglect and decay finally took their toll. Part of the roof and one wall collapsed, forcing the demolition of the rest of the structure. Two news items from April 1909 showed that growth, and growing pains, were part of everyday life in Gary. Residents inside the city limits have agreed to remove fencing \\"while there are no crops in the ground\\" from the roadways, opening them up to travel. This move was backed by W.N. Jackson, a \\"well known real estate dealer and promoter of Gary and Palmetto Beach.\\" While many places in Florida gave the right-of-way to livestock, Gary is unique in doing so for its cash crops.https://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/gary-was-a-growing-town- before-being-annexed-by-tampa/2287554Tampa Bay Times References http://www.ghosttowns.com/states/fl/gary.html External links *Ghost Towns: Gary Neighborhoods in Tampa, Florida Former census- designated places in Florida ","title":"Gary (Tampa)"},{"id":"13249533","text":"Thiago Braga de Souza or simply Thiago Braga (born May 4, 1984 in Belo Horizonte), is a Brazilian goalkeeper who plays for Oper√°rio Ferrovi√°rio.

He is often named in Western news sources as Atallah Hanna, Atallah and both meaning \\"gift of God\\" in Arabic and Greek, respectively. Theodosios, who was ordained on the 24 December 2005 at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, is the second Palestinian to hold the position of archbishop in the history of the diocese. The Palestinian filmmaker and artist Hisham Zreiq honors the Archbishop of Sebastia Theodosios (Atallah Hanna), and the Palestinian singer Manl Mousa by giving each of them one of his artworks during Palestinian Land Day celebration in Dortmund, Germany Early life; education Archbishop Theodosios was born Nizar Hanna to Eastern Orthodox parents in the village of Rameh, Upper Galilee region of northern Israel. Archbishop Theodosios studied Greek in Jerusalem, continuing his studies in Greece where he earned his Master of Theology from University of Thessalonica School of Theology in 1991. Ecclesiastical career That same year, 1991, Nizar Hanna returned to Jerusalem, where he was tonsured a monk with the name Theodosios and received ordination as a deacon.OrthodoxWiki, Theodosios (Hanna) of Sebastia Also in 1991 he was elected a member of the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1992 Theodosios was ordained a priest at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. A few days later he was elevated to the rank of archimandrite and placed in charge of the Arab section of the Patriarchate. Active in public life, he has served as the spokesperson and Director of the Patriarchate's Arab Department, has taught in local schools, and lectured on Christianity at the Haifa Arab Teachers' College. For his devotion to ministry in the Holy Land, Theodosios was granted an honorary Doctor of Theology degree from the Sofia Theological Institute in Bulgaria. In 2001 Theodosios was appointed by the late Patriarch Diodoros to serve as the official spokesperson for the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem. In 2005, after the dethronement of Patriarch Irenaios and his replacement with Patriarch Theophilos III, Theodosios was ordained Archbishop of Sebastia.Ma'an News Agency, J'lem archbishop: Israel targets mosque today, church tomorrow, 27.09.2009 Political positions and the response of the authorities Theodosios gained renown for his high- profile political activism, his outspoken denunciation of the occupation, and his stress upon the importance of Palestinian identity - positions that have made him popular with Arabs and unpopular with the Israeli authorities. Before being ordained archbishop, Theodosios had been arrested, detained and interrogated more than once by the Israeli authorities under various allegations of 'incitement'. Theodosios has served as a member of the Constitutional Consultative Committee that worked on the third draft of the Palestinian constitution of March 2003 and was awarded the Jerusalem Prize by the Palestinian National Authority's Ministry of Culture in 2004. He is also one of the authors of the Kairos Palestine document together with Patriarch Michel Sabah, Naim Ateeq, Rifat Odeh Kassis, Nora Qort and others. =During the Second Intifada= Theodosios represented Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem Diodoros as part of a Palestinian ecumenical delegation invited by the World Council of Churches (WCC) to present before the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. At the WCC's Geneva headquarters on 19 October 2000, he stated that Palestinian Christians \\"are suffering, because they are Palestinians and they want to stay in their homeland in Palestine\\". Theodosios also accused Israel of practicing \\"ethnic cleansing against the Arabs, Muslim and Christian. Everyone thinks that there is a conflict between Arabs and Israelis. It is not a conflict between Arabs and Israelis, but an occupation by Israel.\\" He called on all WCC churches to hold a special prayer for the Palestinian people and stated that they \\"should be enjoying all the rights of any other nation ... and should be enjoying their independence in their own state, the capital of which is Jerusalem.\\" The following year, on 10 October 2001, Theodosios participated with other Christian and Muslim leaders in a march from Jerusalem to the Bethlehem checkpoint to protest Israeli attacks on religious sites. Theodosios explained that, \\"We intend to conduct special prayers inside the Church of the Nativity for the sake of our martyrs.\\" Later that month, Theodosios sent a message to the United Nations Human Rights Commission calling for \\"immediate and rapid intervention\\" by the United Nations \\"to save the Palestinian people from the terrible massacres being carried out by the occupation forces\\". He also called for the Commission to pressure Israel to lift its blockade of Palestinian towns and villages. On 21 January 2002, Israel requested that the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate take punitive action against Archimandrite Atallah Hanna, for criticizing Israeli policy in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In March 2002, the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem issued a statement expressing, \\"denunciation and condemnation over Israel's suspension of Archimandrite Dr. Atallah Hanna at King Hussein bridge between Jordan and the West Bank upon his return from Beirut, for five hours in a very racist and provocative way.\\" The patriarchy also expressed its regret over the demand of the Israeli government that Theodosios be fired from his position as church spokesperson, considering this measure to be \\"a grave violation to its sovereignty in running its affairs.\\" In July 2002, two years into the Second Intifada, Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem Irenaios I accused Theodosios of \\"supporting the Palestinian terrorism,\\" after he refused to sign a document condemning Palestinian operations and he fired him from his post as spokesperson. The Arab Orthodox community responded by issuing an urgent statement calling on the Greek Foreign Ministry to intervene, stressing that Theodosios would remain the spokesperson for the church with or without Greek acceptance. Arab Orthodox figures urged the Orthodox Arab Christian communities in Palestine and Jordan to boycott the Greek Patriarch and the Father Theodosios Atallah Hanna Defense Committee was formed to mobilize on his behalf. Arrest and confiscation of travel documents :Day of the arrest On 22 August 2002, Theodosios was arrested outside of his home in the Old City of Jerusalem by Israeli Border Police on the order of Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein. He was taken to the police station at the Russian Compound where he was charged with 'suspicion of relations with terrorist organisations', 'illegally entering an enemy country' (i.e. Syria and Lebanon) and 'incitement'. Media were present at the site of his interrogation which lasted five hours. Theodosios explained that he regularly visited Syria and Lebanon to attend religious and inter-religious conferences and dialogues using his Vatican passport. Israeli police confiscated Theodosios' Israeli and Vatican-issued passports. :Theodosios' response to the arrest Upon his release, Theodosios claimed that his arrest had been unjustified since \\"he had only expressed opposition to Israel's military occupation of areas claimed by the Palestinians.\\" In an interview with The Palestine Chronicle in September 2002, Theodosios said that his arrest marked \\"the first time that a Christian religious leader and official is arrested in such an inhumane and non- acceptable manner that is devoid of all human ethics and without any prior notification.\\" Sharing his view as to the reasons for his arrest, he explained that: > In the past three months, a far-reaching defamation campaign was launched > against me in a number of Israeli newspapers accusing me of supporting > terrorism and violence and condoning suicide attacks. I have a strong > conviction that the slander, assault and arrest are all part of a chain of > accusations meant to deliver a message to me, and the rest of the Christian > and Moslem religious leaders ... The Israeli authority has launched a > campaign aiming at silencing all those nationalistic voices in Jerusalem and > claiming that these voices support terrorism, violence, etc. I believe that > the only concerned party is the Israeli authority. In my case there could be > some elements involved from within the Church itself, and this is something > that I cannot disregard, especially that there are those who do not share my > stance on issues pertaining to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Theodosios further stated that: > I believe that the act of ousting me from my position as the official > spokesperson of the Church and the other measures taken are closely related > to the pressure and blackmail exercised especially that the Patriarch > confirmed to me months ago that I am targeted and that Israel has demanded > that he oust me from my position. This is what actually happened later on > based on the Israeli desire to conceal the Christian dimension of the > Palestinian issue. Israel attempts to present this conflict as a Jewish- > Moslem religious conflict, and it also attempts to neutralize the Christian > position, and therefore it is irritated by the growing Christian voices > raised on the Palestinian issue. We have always asserted that the Church in > Palestine is there to serve all Palestinians for it is a church for the > people. It is also a church that is deeply rooted in this land and the Arab > Palestinian Christians and Moslems who live in it. We have always asserted > our resistance to the Israeli pressure, and we believe that in the case of > the arrest itself Israel has transgressed all borders. Responding to the charge of visiting \\"enemy states\\", Theodosios explained that: > As to the case of the visit to Syria considered by Israel an enemy country, > we say that we are not bound by the Israeli stance. The number of people who > belong to the Greek Orthodox Church in Syria exceeds a million and the > number in Lebanon exceeds half a million. Israel has no right of preventing > us from visiting Syria and Lebanon under the claim that these are enemy > countries especially that we maintain spiritual and nationalistic ties with > these countries. When we visit these countries we meet with all political > and religious officials with no exceptions whatsoever. We are open to > everyone. Israel has no right of claiming that we maintain relations with > terrorist organizations because what Israel calls terrorist maybe to us > nationalistic, freedom fighters.

Legal advocacy to reclaim passports On 28 October 2002, Adalah: The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel sent a letter to the Attorney General's office on Theodosios' behalf demanding that they intervene to return both the Israeli and Vatican passports that had been confiscated from Theodosios by the Israeli police. Adalah noted that a few weeks earlier, the police had summoned Theodosios to collect his passports on the condition that he sign \\"a statement promising not to incite against the state or make statements in support of terrorist actions or organizations; not to visit states hostile to Israel without the permission of the Ministry of Interior; and not to contact enemy states (as defined under Israeli law) or terrorist organizations.\\" Theodosios refused, and the police refused to return his passports. Adalah argued that the police decision to withhold Theodosios' passports had no basis in any law and did not serve any legitimate purpose, and that the document he was asked to sign also had no legal basis and violated the Israel's domestic laws on equality. On 28 October 2002, the Attorney General sent a letter to the police legal advisor requesting his urgent reply to Adalah's letter. As of February 2005, both passports belonging to Archimandrite Theodosios had not yet been returned. =Activism against sales of church property in Jerusalem= In 2005, Archimandrite Theodosios was active in the movement to dethrone Patriarch Irenaios following allegations that land belonging to the Greek Orthodox Church had been sold to Zionist Jewish organizations.

Britton in 1882. Note: This includes , Site map, and Accompanying photographs. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History The Narrows Covered Bridge was built to replace the previous bridge that Salmon Lusk had built in 1847, which itself had been built to replace the bridge he'd built in 1840. The first bridge was destroyed in 1847 and the second in 1875. The Parke County Commissioners didn't decided to replace the bridge for several years and by then iron bridges were becoming popular. Finally, on August 24, 1882, the first bids opened. These included: Smith Iron Works (iron, $6,680), Wrought Iron Bridge Co. (iron, $5,706), King Iron Bridge Co. (iron, $2,904), Columbia Bridge Works (iron, $3,288), G. F. Haynes (wood, $2,704), and J. A. Britton (wood, $3,750 total). Except for Mr. Britton's bid, the others may or may not include the cost for the abutments or other costs. At any rate, all of the bids were rejected. J. A. Britton was later awarded the contract for $3,400. This bridge has been acclaimed as the first in J. A. Britton's illustrious covered bridge career. Some purists though have criticized the pointed arch joints and it can be noted that J. A. Britton built a Billie Creek Bridge in 1880, but it was probably an open bridge. Joseph A. Britton's first wife died while he was working on the Narrows Bridge. He later met his second wife, who was living at a farm not far from the narrows, while working on the bridge.

It opened in 1872 under the name of New Poole Junction and closed to passengers in 1966 and to goods in 1969. Between these dates there were several changes of name for a station which at its height provided a suburb of Poole with four substantial platforms and a goods yard. A prominent feature of the station was the large footbridge needed to span the four running lines. Opened as New Poole Junction in 1872, as part of the Southampton and Dorchester Railway, the station was the junction for the new line into Poole that superseded the old station at Lower Hamworthy. When the line was extended to Bournemouth West Broadstone became the junction for the trains to the Bournemouth station. Then the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway constructed a cutoff line to avoid the need to reverse in Wimborne and Broadstone became the meeting point of two lines, although the construction of further cutoffs to improve access to Bournemouth reduced its importance. Decline and closure The first line through Broadstone to close was the Old Road from Ringwood, closed in 1964. The line to Hamworthy Junction was lifted in 1966. This same year, the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway lost its passenger services. This left Broadstone the junction of two goods lines, one to serve a goods depot at Blandford via a stub of the SDJR and one which passed through Wimborne to serve the RAOC fuel depot at West Moors. The Blandford Forum freight line closed and was lifted in 1969 . The goods traffic to Wimborne maintained a track running through the site until 1977 after which the track was lifted and the land sold for redevelopment. The site today Today the site is occupied by Broadstone Leisure Centre, its car park and a traffic roundabout. A subway to Broadstone's shopping area passes under the roads where the railway bridge used to be. This, and the building of some houses on the old trackbed north of the station site, mean that the Castleman Trailway skirts the edge of the former site before regaining the old trackbed on the way to Wimborne.

The screenplay concerns a man who leaves his middle class job to run a hotel left to him by his great uncle. Plot Johnny Baxter is at his corporate job when a probate attorney tells him that his recently deceased uncle, Jacob Barnesworth, has left him sole ownership of the lucrative Grand Imperial Hotel in the fictional town of Silver Hill, Colorado. Barnesworth claimed that the hotel brings in more than $14,000 per month. Baxter views this as a golden opportunity and quits his job. He moves his family to Colorado to take proprietorship of the hotel. It is an immense but ramshackle building with no heat and a colorful old codger, Jesse McCord, living in the shed. McCord offers his services as a bartender, but Baxter assigns him the job of bellhop. Local grease monkey Wally Perkins explains that the Grand Imperial sits on a huge amount of property. Baxter realizes that they can turn the hotel into a ski resort. Baxter attempts to secure funding for his plans. Local banker Martin Ridgeway expresses great interest in Baxter's idea, but also offers to buy the lodge, supposedly in order to convert it into a boys' school. Baxter declines, so Ridgeway declines to give Baxter a loan, citing him as a bad collateral risk and specifically pointing out that Baxter has no experience in hotel or restaurant management. Baxter meets with a friendly banker, Mr. Wainwright, at a ski lodge. Baxter claims to be an avid skier and Wainwright takes him to a black diamond run called \\"Nightmare Alley.\\" Baxter ends up crashing into a tree. While Baxter is recovering, Ridgeway gives him a check for $3,000. Baxter starts making a list of repairs for the lodge. Meanwhile, Wally works with McCord to repair the hot water heater. The water heater explodes, tearing a hole in the kitchen wall. Ridgeway's check covers the repair, but leaves nothing for the ski lift Baxter had in mind. McCord pulls an old donkey engine out of mothballs, tying a rope around it, and offers it as a makeshift ski lift. When Wally dynamites a tree stump from the ground, the explosion sets off an avalanche, blocking a passing train carrying several hundred skiers. The Baxters quickly shuttle the skiers to their resort. All goes well until Wally loses his balance and skis down a steep mountain, dangling over a ledge. Using the donkey engine and a rope to lower Baxter down the mountain to rescue Wally, McCord accidentally cause the donkey engine to slide down the mountain and plow through the hotel. All of the guests check out, leaving the Baxters out of money once again. Baxter goes back to Ridgeway, asking for an extension on his loan, which Ridgeway refuses. Baxter notices a sign for the Silver Hills Snowmobile Race, with a $5,000 prize. Baxter decides to drive in the race, with McCord as his partner. Baxter's wife threatens to leave him over his carelessness and obsession. Though they come close, Baxter and McCord narrowly lose the race. Ridgeway brings the deed transfer papers to the lodge for Baxter to sign. After threatening to begin the foreclosure process, he offers to buy the resort from Baxter. Ridgeway's secretary, Miss Wigginton, tells everyone the truth: the property includes several hundred acres of timberland originally donated to the local Indian tribes by Barnesworth for as long as the tribe inhabited the land. As the tribe has moved away or died out, the land reverts to the estate. Ridgeway wants to buy the resort in order to log the timber. McCord adds that the land the town was built on was granted by Barnesworth on the condition that several buildings be erected, including a library. Baxter's son notes that he has not seen a library, and asks why the land has not reverted to Baxter. Silver Hill is in violation of the grant, meaning that the entire town is built on land now owned by Baxter. Ridgeway agrees to loan Baxter the money necessary to repair and expand the resort.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History The village of Portland Mills was settled in 1821 by Samuel Steele on the Parke County-Putnam County county line. Working to clear the land for farming he later built a mill in 1825 on Big Raccoon Creek. The grain mill had a water turbine, as opposed to a water wheel, and a sawmill. The mill would go through several owners, William Butcher, Jesse Thompson, and Wesley Holman. Holman would build a new three story mill on a solid sandstone foundation and obtained modern machinery.

While the Parke County Covered Bridge website claims the bridge started out in Union Township after looking at plat maps from 1874http://www.indianagenweb.com/inparke/Maps/1874AtlasPage90HowardWestportSylvaniaPortlandMills.jpg it would appear that the bridge may have been in the southeast corner of Greene Township. While a clear location is lost because of the flooding of Big Raccoon Creek in 1961, it looks as if the bridge would have been very close to . Because of the afore mentioned flooding of Big Raccoon Creek to build what was then called Mansfield lake, today's Cecil M. Harden Lake, in January 1961 the bridge was moved to its current location to replace the Dooley Station Covered Bridge which was the victim of arson in 1960. The bridge was allowed to deteriorate and fall into disrepair. Because sections of the roof and siding were later missing damaging rain was allowed in and the northeast corner had even been damaged by fire. The bridge was eventually closed in 1982 and bypassed by a ford. By the 1990s the bridge had fallen into severe neglect that it was in grave danger of collapse. However, funds from a grant and help from local organizations and donations allowed it to be restored to its original state in 1996. The bridge has even been reopened to traffic.

It was issued in 1971 by Produttori Associati and reissued several times by Ricordi and BMG. It is a concept album based on the Spoon River Anthology by Edgar Lee Masters. The co- author of the music is composer Nicola Piovani, who later won an Academy Award for his soundtrack for Roberto Benigni's Life is beautiful. The title itself is a quotation from the first poem in the Spoon River Anthology, The Hill: ::Drinking, rioting, thinking neither of wife nor kin, ::Nor gold, nor love, nor heaven? Track listing All lyrics by De Andr√© and Giuseppe Bentivoglio, based on poems by Edgar Lee Masters (see below); all music by De Andr√© and Nicola Piovani. # \\"La collina\\" (The Hill) (4:03) # \\"Un matto (dietro ogni scemo c'√® un villaggio)\\" (A Madman - Behind every madman there is a village) (2:35) # \\"Un giudice\\" (A Judge) (2:55) # \\"Un blasfemo (dietro ogni blasfemo c'√® un giardino incantato)\\" (A Blasphemer - Behind every blasphemer there is an enchanted garden) (2:59) # \\"Un malato di cuore\\" (A Sufferer of Heart) (4:18) # \\"Un medico\\" (A Doctor) (2:39) # \\"Un chimico\\" (A Chemist) (3:00) # \\"Un ottico\\" (An Optician) (4:35) # \\"Il suonatore Jones\\" (Fiddler Jones) (4:25) The songs All songs are based on writer Fernanda Pivano's first-ever English-to-Italian translation - which happened to be the Spoon River Anthology. Pivano, who later became a prolific translator, obtained the book as a loan from her friend and fellow poet/writer Cesare Pavese, who urged her to read it. She found it so moving that she felt compelled to start translating it into Italian - without telling anything to Pavese, a translator himself, out of her fear that he may scold her for getting professionally involved with such \\"low\\" material. However, Pavese later came across Pivano's translation by pure chance, he was impressed and convinced Pivano to publish it.\\"Fernanda Pivano interviews Fabrizio De Andr√©\\", from the outer jacket of the album. The translated poems were further rewritten by De Andr√© with lyricist/writer Giuseppe Bentivoglio. Notably, all of Edgar Lee Masters's characters have names, while De Andr√©'s do not (\\"A Madman\\", \\"A Judge\\", \\"A Blasphemer\\" etc.). De Andr√©, interviewed by Pivano in the album's notes, stated that the first 5 songs are about envy, where the last 4 are about science and ambition as seen by scientists and their efforts. Each of these two subjects was successfully addressed in songs such as \\"Un malato di cuore\\" and \\"Il suonatore Jones\\". *\\"La collina\\" is based on \\"The Hill\\", listing various people who are buried in the imaginary Spoon River churchyard and stating that \\"All are sleeping on the Hill\\". This song is the only one in the album which mentions people's names (which, however, are never used in the following songs, except for a mention of \\"Jenny\\" in \\"Il suonatore Jones\\"). *\\"Un matto\\" is based on \\"Frank Drummer\\", in which a man memorizes the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (Treccani in De Andr√©'s version) and is considered crazy by the people of Spoon River. *\\"Un Giudice\\" is based on \\"Selah Lively\\", the story of a midget who studies law and becomes a judge to get revenge on the people who made fun of him all his life - thus revealing that his moral stature is as low as his physical one.De Andr√©'s spoken intro to the song during a 28 November 1975 live performance; I concerti 2012 box set, CD 2, track 10. In a single line of his lyrics, De Andr√© uses deliberately vulgar, scurrilous language (\\"A midget must surely be a swine, because his heart is way too close to his asshole\\"), quite far from Masters's restrained style, to underline people's nastiness toward the protagonist. *\\"Un blasfemo\\" is based on \\"Wendell P. Bloyd\\", a non-believer who practices blasphemy and keeps on not believing even when, after his death, he is welcomed into the Garden of Eden. De Andr√© also uses Biblical imagery as metaphors for various forms of power in late 1960s/early 1970s Italy, such as political power and police power. *\\"Un malato di cuore\\" is based on \\"Francis Turner\\", the story of a man with an unspecified heart disease who envies healthy people, and dies of a heart attack while giving his first kiss. The quasi-classical arrangement of the song features melodic wordless lines sung by Edda Dell'Orso and, at the end, an excerpt from the second movement (Largo) of Antonio Vivaldi's \\"Winter\\", from The Four Seasons. *\\"Un medico\\" is based on \\"Dr. Siegfried Iseman\\", the story of a doctor who wants to cure poor people without receiving payment. At the end of the song, the doctor is deemed a trickster and imprisoned for having sold flower extracts as an elixir of life. *\\"Un chimico\\" is based on \\"Trainor, the Druggist\\", in which an unmarried chemist, who does not understand anything about romantic relationships but instead loves chemical elements, dies while executing an experiment - in De Andr√©'s melancholic conclusion, \\"just like those idiots who die of love, and somebody would say that there's a better way\\". The music for this song was stated by De Andr√© to be an adaption of an English folk tune. *\\"Un ottico\\" is based on \\"Dippold the Optician\\", the story of an optician who, after his passing, only wants to create special glasses which project strange visions. De Andr√©'s \\"updated\\" description of him, through the words of his imaginary \\"customers\\", makes him similar to Timothy Leary - a promoter of LSD and mind-expanding hallucinogenic drugs. The highly complex, multi-part musical arrangement features another excerpt from Vivaldi's \\"Winter\\", this time from its first movement (Allegro), played on electric guitar. *\\"Il suonatore Jones\\" is based on \\"Fiddler Jones\\". De Andr√© identified himself with the itinerant musician who plays without asking or hoping for any kinds of rewards, but just out of pure joy in playing. In the final verse of his lyrics, the musician's instrument was changed from a fiddle into a flute, for metrical reasons. Edda Dell'Orso is featured again here, singing a wordless coda. Live performances and Morgan's 2005 remake Unusually for a De Andr√© album, most of the songs on it were never performed live by the author, the only song regularly featured in his live sets being the fast, country-flavoured \\"Un giudice\\". In an interview excerpt included within the eighth and last DVD (Poesia in forma di canzone - \\"Poetry as songs\\") of the 2011 eight-disc documentary series Dentro Faber (i.e. Inside Faber, about his life and works), De Andr√© stated that most of the songs on the album were either too poetical, something which the singer- songwriter felt would not translate well in a live context, or too musically complex to play live; he cited \\"Un ottico\\" as an example of the latter, as that song features four sections in different tempos and includes overlapping vocals (originally recorded by De Andr√© singing the same lines twice, with a heavy delay effect), displaying a progressive rock influence. In 2005, the entire album was faithfully remade by singer-songwriter and multi- instrumentalist Morgan, who also re-arranged the various excerpts of classical music (particularly from Vivaldi's Four Seasons) featured on the original album. Soon after the release of his version on CD, Morgan successfully toured Italy and Europe with it. Cover artwork The artwork for the original album, created by advertising designer Deanna Galletto, is a drawing of an orange box floating in a blue sky with smoke-like clouds. The box, whose front door is half-open on the main cover, is revealed on the inner gatefold to \\"contain\\" six characters, three males and three females, drawn on squared paper and unrelated to the characters in the songs, walking in an idealized Eden setting. The outer jacket does not include lyrics (which are instead featured on the inner sleeve), but contains an interview with De Andr√© conducted by Fernanda Pivano. The inner sleeve, along with the lyrics, also includes an imaginary interview with Edgar Lee Masters, compiled by Pivano from various writings by the American author. The artwork for Morgan's 2005 remake, created by the design company MoltiMedia.it with contributions from Morgan himself, and referred to by the musician, in the visual (DVD) section of the album's DualDisc release, as \\"a deferential parody\\", is a photo of an actual orange wooden box, glued to the right side of an old wall in a house; the wall is painted in a sky-blue colour, with several areas of paint having fallen off to reveal a grayish tint, and puffs of white smoke rise up from below. Similarly to the original cover, the front door of the box is half- open, and another photo on the CD tray reveals the box to be a small closet full of old-fashioned medicine bottles; each bottle is labeled with a pictorial rendition of a song title and, on three bottles, the lyrics to the song, although not all labels are fully visible. The back cover is a photo of Morgan standing in a field, in the distance and with his back to the camera, seen through a two-pane window in the same sky-blue/gray old wall on the front cover, and implied to be part of the same house; Morgan is seen through the pane on the right, while the one on the left frames a bare tree.

Located in the City Park of \\"Zrinjski,\\" the life-sized statue stands 1.68 meters tall, shorter than Bruce Lee's actual height of 1.72 meters,http://www.heightdb.com/person/bruce-lee and is a symbol of solidarity in the ethnically divided city. History The statue was the first public monument to Bruce Lee unveiled in the world, with a statue in Hong Kong being revealed one day later marking what would have been the Hong Kong American star's 65th birthday. The project of the statue was spearheaded by Mostar Urban Movement, a youth group headed by Nino Raspudiƒá and Veselin Gatalo, who saw the statue as \\"an attempt to question symbols, old and new, by mixing up high grandeur with mass culture and kung fu.\\" In a city that had been torn in war by ethnic divisions, the dynamic movie star was a symbol of \\"loyalty, skill, friendship and justice.\\" Lee was \\"far [enough] away from us that nobody can ask what he did during World War II\\" and \\"part of our idea of universal justice‚Äìthat the good guys can win\\". Lee, although an American of Chinese descent and famous martial arts actor, represented at least one thing that could bridge the divides between Mostar residents: \\"One thing we all have in common is Bruce Lee.\\" The unveiling ceremony of the statue saw the attendance of local Bruce Lee fans, representatives of the German government, which had bankrolled the project, as well as Chinese officials. Martial arts is popular among the youth population in Herzegovina, especially competitive Mixed Martial Arts where Croatian Mirko Filipoviƒá is an international star. Shortly afterward the sculpture was vandalized, removed for repairs and brought back at the end of May 2013. Both Bosnians and Croats had complained that the statue was a provocation because they thought it was pointed towards their area in a fighting stance, so its creators rotated the statue to face a neutral direction.

They serve as connections from the main highway into Reed City, Clare and Midland. Additionally, there were another two business routes that connected US Highway 10 (US 10) to the downtowns of Flint and Pontiac. All of these business routes are, or were, former sections of US 10 that were marked Business US Highway 10 (Bus. US 10) after the main highway was realigned to bypass the downtowns of the cities. The Reed City Bus. US 10 was created by 1960 to follow Chestnut and Church streets into the community's central business district and through adjacent residential areas. In 1975 when US 10 was rerouted to follow the freeways around Clare, the former routing through downtown on McEwan and Fifth streets was redesignated as a business loop; it was also signed to provide connections between US 10 and what is now US 127 because of an incomplete interchange between those two freeways. The Midland business loop dates back to 1961 and follows Eastman Avenue and two sets of one-way streets before completing its routing as a freeway. The two business loops created for Flint and Pontiac were designated in 1941 and 1961, respectively. They followed streets that were once part of US 10, but after additional changes to US 10's routing in Michigan, they were renumbered as business loops of other highways in 1962 and 1986, respectively. Near Flint, part of US 10 was replaced by M-54 when the US Highway was moved to a freeway, and near Pontiac it was replaced by US 24 after US 10 was truncated in the state. Reed City Business US Highway 10 (Bus. US 10) is a business loop running for about in Reed City. Running eastbound, the business loop starts at the corner of US 10 and Chestnut Street and runs southward along the latter into downtown. Chestnut Street is old US 131 and passes through some residential neighborhoods. It also crosses the Hersey River and the Pere Marquette State Trail while running parallel to the White Pine Trail along its western half. At the intersection with Church Street near Reed City High School, Bus. US 10 turns eastward. The business loop continues easterly out of downtown and angles northeasterly before crossing the Hersey River and the Pere Marquette State Trail again. Immediately to the northeast of the river crossing, Bus. US 10 intersects its parent highway and terminates. The entire route of the highway follows two-lane streets through town. According to the Michigan Department of Transportation, the agency which maintains the roadway, between 1,949 and 5,499 vehicles per day used the business loop on average daily in 2013. In 1919 when the state highway system was first numbered, the east‚Äìwest highway running through Reed City was numbered M-20, and it was renumbered to US 10 seven years later when the United States Numbered Highway System was created. The business loop was created after US 10 was moved to bypass downtown Reed City in the late 1950s. This realignment was completed, and the business loop commissioned, by 1960. Until 1986, the western half of the loop along Chestnut Street ran concurrently with US 131 until that highway was moved to its current freeway routing. Major intersections Clare Business US Highway 10 (Bus. US 10) is a business loop in Clare that is just over long. From its western end, it branches off its parent highway, US 10 and runs southward into the city of Clare. Because US 10 runs concurrently with US 127 on the northern and eastern sides of Clare, Bus. US 10 is also concurrent with Bus. US 127 on its western leg. Bus. US 10/Bus. US 127 follows McEwan Street southward over the South Branch of the Tobacco River and through a residential area on the north side of the city. Several blocks further south, the highway enters the downtown district and turns onto 5th Streets, separating from Bus. US 127. Fifth Street continues eastward and then southeasterly out of downtown and through residential areas. At Clarabella Road, the business loop crosses from Clare County into Isabella County before passing under the US 127 freeway without an interchange. Bus. US 10 runs parallel to the Pere Marquette Rail-Trail on Saginaw Road in a rural section of Isabella County before terminating at an interchange that connects it to eastbound US 10 in Wise Township. Through the city, the business loop has four lanes for traffic, but the rural segment in Isabella County has two. According to the Michigan Department of Transportation, the agency which maintains the roadway, between 4,035 and 6,540 vehicles per day used the business loop on average daily in 2013. In 1919 when the state highway system was first numbered, the east‚Äìwest highway running through Clare was numbered M-20, and it was renumbered to US 10 seven years later when the United States Numbered Highway System was created. In late 1961, the US 10 freeway east of the city to Midland was finished, but the route through downtown remained part of US 10. A freeway bypass north of Clare and Farwell opened in 1975, and US 10 was rerouted along the then-US 27 freeway to connect from the new bypass to the existing freeway east of the city, bypassing both cities. The section of US 10 in downtown Clare was designated Bus. US 10 at this time, running along then- Bus. US 27 to connect to US 27/US 10 north of downtown. The section of former US 10 between Farwell and Clare became an extended M-115 in 1989. In 2002, US 27 in Michigan was renumbered to US 127, and the business loops were renumbered accordingly. Major intersections Midland Business US Highway 10 (Bus. US 10) is a business loop running for in Midland in Midland County. The highway starts at exit 122 on US 10 north of downtown near the Midland Mall. The business loop runs southward along the four lanes of Eastman Avenue through residential neighborhoods and past the Midland Country Club and the Midland Center for the Arts. Further south, the business loop splits to follow the one-way pairing of Buttles Street (eastbound) and Indian Street (westbound); these two streets run northwest-to- southeast parallel to the Tittabawassee River. At Jerome Street, M-20 merges onto the business loop. The two highways run concurrently from this point eastward. On the eastern edge of downtown, Bus. US 10/M-20 passes Dow Diamond, home of the Great Lakes Loons, a minor-league baseball team, and then the highway turns northeasterly. East of Jefferson Avenue, Bus. US 10/M-20 turns east‚Äìwest along the one-way pairing of Lyon Road (eastbound) and Patrick Road (westbound). East of Washington Street and Saginaw Road, the highway transitions from one-way streets to a freeway; the transition between the eastbound freeway and Patrick Road passes through a roundabout in the Saginaw Road interchange. As the freeway continues eastward, there is a partial interchange for Waldo Road, and then the highway crosses into the section of Midland that is located in Bay County. Immediately east of the county line, Bus. US 10 and M-20 jointly terminate at a directional interchange with US 10; traffic on the eastbound business loop defaults onto eastbound US 10, and traffic on the westbound business loop originates on westbound US 10. According to the Michigan Department of Transportation, the agency which maintains the roadway, between 7,317 and 23,733 vehicles per day used the business loop on average daily in 2013. The section of Bus. US 10 that runs concurrently with M-20 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. In 1919 when the state highway system was first numbered, the east‚Äìwest highways connecting at Midland were numbered M-20 and M-24. M-20 to the northwest of the city along with M-24 to the southeast (along what is today M-47) were renumbered to US 10 seven years later when the United States Numbered Highway System was created. Afterward, M-24 west of Midland became part of M-20. By the middle of the 1930s, US 10 was shifted to bypass downtown Midland, and the former route on the west side of town was numbered US 10A. At the end of the 1950s, M-20 east of Midland to Bay City was converted to a freeway, By the middle of 1961, the freeway bypass of Midland was completed, and the business loop was designated along the former US 10A and part of M-20; at the same time, US 10 was rerouted to replace M-20 east of Midland to Bay City Major intersections Flint Business US Highway 10 (Bus. US 10 ) was a business loop in the Flint area. It ran for about along Saginaw Road, which was also called Saginaw Street in the city of Flint. The highway connected to its parent in Mount Morris Township and ran southerly along Saginaw Road through Mount Morris. From there the business loop paralleled what is now I-475 into the city of Flint on Saginaw Street. In downtown, the loop crossed the Flint River. There were intersections with both directions of M-21; eastbound M-21 was routed on 5th Street while westbound traffic followed Court Street one block north. South of downtown, Bus. US 10 turned southeasterly to run through suburban Burton before terminating at an intersection with US 10 (Dort Highway) near Grand Blanc in Grand Blanc Township. Saginaw Road was a multi-lane undivided street for its length at the time it was Bus. US 10 Originally, Saginaw Road in the Flint area was a part of the Saginaw Trail, a Native American footpath in the area. When the state signed its highway system in 1919, Saginaw Road was part of M-10. Later it was used as a section of US 10 in 1926. By 1930, the main highway was moved eastward to follow Dort Highway, and the route through the city was designated M-10. It was renumbered to Bus. US 10 in 1941. Later, in 1962, US 10 was moved again to follow the recently completed I-75 freeway; the former route of US 10 was redesignated M-54 and its business loop was renumbered to match. Major intersections Pontiac Business US Highway 10 (Bus. US 10) was an approximately business loop running in Pontiac. It was redesignated in 1986 as a business route of US 24 after US 10 was truncated to Bay City. The roadways it used were at four lanes where they carried two-way traffic, and two or three lanes where they carried one-way traffic through the area. Bus. US 10 started northwest of downtown at the intersection of Telegraph Road and Dixie Highway in Waterford Township before crossing into the City of Pontiac. From there, the highway followed Dixie Highway southeasterly bordered by residential neighborhoods to the north and rail yards to the south of the four-lane street. From the intersection with Woodcalm Street southward, the eastbound direction branched off to follow Cass Avenue two blocks to the south of Oakland Avenue. At the northern end of downtown, Bus. US 10 merged onto a loop formed by Wide Track Drive around the downtown core southward to Woodward Avenue. The loop is shaped like an upside-down tear drop that is about four blocks wide at the northern end tapering to a single intersection at the south. Wide Track Drive also carried the two directions of Business Loop Interstate 75 (BL I-75) around downtown Pontiac between Woodward Avenue and Perry Street. The two directions of BL I-75/Bus. US 10 intersected M-59 on opposite sides of the central business district at Huron Street. The business loop continued southward along Wide Track Drive to the intersection that marked the northern end of Woodward Avenue. From there, BL I-75/Bus. US 10 followed Woodward south past the hospital and out of the City of Pontiac. South of the city limits, the roadway was bordered by residential subdivisions. At Square Lake Road, Bus US 10 turned westward, BL I-75 turned eastward and M-1 continued south on Woodward Avenue. Bus. US 10 followed Square Lake Road for about before terminating at an intersection with US 10 (Telegraph Road). In 1919 when the state highway system was first numbered, the north‚Äìsouth highway through Pontiac was numbered M-10, and it was renumbered to US 10 seven years later when the United States Numbered Highway System was created. A number of highway designation and routing changes in the Pontiac were made when US 10 was shifted out of downtown to replace M-58 along Telegraph Road west of downtown by the middle of 1961. Before the change, US 10 followed Dixie Highway and Oakland Avenue southeast into Pontiac to Perry Street and then Perry to Woodward while M-58 was routed along Telegraph and Square Lake Roads. After the change, US 10 turned south from Dixie Highway onto Telegraph and then east onto Square Lake to connect back to Woodward. The old route through downtown was assigned the Bus. US 10 moniker and M-58 was decommissioned as a highway designation. Nine years later, US 10 was moved off Woodward Avenue between Pontiac and Detroit to follow the Lodge Freeway and Telegraph Road. Bus. US 10 was extended westward along Square Lake Road from the intersection of Woodward Avenue to the junction with Telegraph Road so that it would continue to connect with its parent highway on the southern end. In 1985, the Michigan Department of Transportation received permission from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to truncate US 10 to Bay City, and when the change was made the following year, US 24 replaced US 10 on Telegraph Road north of Square Lake Road, and Bus. US 10 through downtown was redesignated Bus. US 24. Major intersections See also * References External links *US 10 at Michigan Highways * *Bus. US 10 in Reed City at Michigan Highways * *Bus.

Gameplay Dave takes aim at a shotgun-wielding Electrocuted Criminal The Devil Inside is presented as a reality television game show documenting the supernatural exploits of the protagonist Dave and his titular alter ego, a succubus named Deva. The player can transform between Dave and Deva by activating pentagrams located at certain places throughout the game's levels. During gameplay, Dave/Deva is followed by a small flying camera as well as a cameraman, and the player can switch between the two camera views as desired. Occasionally, a news helicopter will also be present and scripted cutscenes will be viewed from an aerial perspective. The pacing, exploration, and puzzle factor of the game is similar to that of other survival horror titles. As Dave, the player has access to a variety of guns, which are equipped with laser sights to assist the player in aiming. As Deva, the player uses spells to attack enemies. Spells do not require ammunition, but do deplete mana that regenerates slowly. Some enemies generate souls when killed, and Deva can inhale souls to replenish her mana. Deva also has the ability to fly and regenerate health when standing in fire. The game uses a checkpoint save system represented by television sets found in-game. Development The game's script was written by Hubert Chardot, better known for his work in the Alone in the Dark series. Its theme is similar to The Running Man, written by Stephen King, whose name is mentioned early in the game. Reception The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameSpot's Greg Kasavin cited difficulties with the control scheme. In regards to the game's action sequences, Kasavin opined that \\"some of the battles are scripted very well. [...] But other times, the combat is poor.\\" The environments of the game were praised for their realism and atmosphere, while character models and sound effects were rated as plain. Overall, the game was described as competent but lacking polish. PC Gamer US praised the animations, camera angles, the use of a dual character, and the game's low learning curve. However, the reviewer cited \\"poor polygonal figures and texturing\\", and some environmental bugs as the low points of the game. Eric Bratcher of Next Generation called it \\"A compelling Illbleed meets Space Channel 5 diversion, but the unique presentation can't cover the weaknesses in AI and puzzle design.\\" In Poland, it was one of the first of the series of cheap premiere releases in the ExtraGra magazine. Shortly after the game's release, one of Poland's most popular TV stations, TVN aired a report on the game, accusing the distributor, CD Projekt of selling satanic games in commonly accessible kiosks. http://polygamia.pl/extra-gra-pieklo-dziecko-lis-ksiadz-i-przedstawiciel-cdp/ The epilepsy warning, which by the time was already common among video games released in Poland and almost omnipresent in Europe, was used as an example of the game's exceptionally negative impact on young people.gry.wp.pl According to Der Spiegel, The Devil Inside was commercially unsuccessful.

Their slogan was \\"Perfecting the Art of Mortgage Lending\\". On August 5, 2009, following a raid by the Special Inspector General of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) and suspension by the Federal Housing Administration from issuing FHA mortgage loans and Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities, it ceased business operations. In April 2011, its majority owner was convicted of 14 counts of securities, bank, and wire fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud, and sentenced to 30 years in federal prison. Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas have sued Bank of America, the trustee and collateral agent of Taylor Bean's Ocala subsidiary, over $1.75 billion in losses stemming from the subsidiary's fraud. History Taylor, Bean & Whitaker closed $35 billion in residential mortgage loans in 2007. It employed about 2,000 workers, and was the fifth-largest issuer of Ginnie Mae securities. By 2009, it was servicing more than 500,000 mortgages, including $51.2 billion of Freddie Mac loans. =SIGTARP raid, suspension, and closure= On August 3, 2009, SIGTARP special agents raided the company's headquarters in Ocala, Florida, in connection with an investigation related to the company's acquisition of a majority stake in Colonial BancGroup, once one of the 25 biggest depository banks in the U.S. Taylor, Bean & Whitaker had signed a deal on March 31, 2009, to become the majority owner of Colonial BancGroup in a $300 million equity stake. On August 4, 2009, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) suspended the company from issuing FHA mortgage loans and Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities. On August 5, 2009, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker ceased business operations, and terminated all of its approximately 2,000 employees at its headquarters. The company filed for bankruptcy protection on August 24, 2009. This came soon after the Alabama State Banking Department, as Colonial Bank's regulator, seized the bank and appointed the FDIC as a receiver. Both companies were brought down by a fraud that started in 2002 involving individuals at both Colonial Bank and Taylor, Bean & Whitaker. =Taylor, Bean & Whitaker collapse and bankruptcy= After the termination of its 2,000 employees, the entire board of directors of Taylor, Bean & Whitaker resigned. In their stead, two newly appointed independent directors, Bill Maloney and Bruce Layman, operated the company with Neil Luria of Navigant Capital Advisors, who was appointed chief restructuring officer of the company. The Office of Thrift Supervision, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker's government regulator, approved the appointments. Subsequently, Judge Jerry A. Funk of the United States Bankruptcy Court approved Taylor, Bean & Whitaker's liquidation plan, which created a trust for distribution to Taylor, Bean & Whitaker's creditors: The Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Plan Trust. The Trust is run by Neil Luria. =PricewaterhouseCoopers lawsuit= The bankruptcy trustee for Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Mortgage Corp., once one of the nation's biggest privately held mortgage companies, is suing PricewaterhouseCoopers as the auditor of Colonial Bank, seeking $5.5 billion in damages. The trustee alleged in the 2013 lawsuit that PricewaterhouseCoopers was negligent in not detecting a massive fraud scheme that brought down Taylor, Bean & Whitaker and helped trigger the 2009 collapse of Colonial Bank, a Montgomery, Alabama bank with $25 billion in assets, one of the biggest U.S. bank collapses during the Great Recession. The closely watched case could lead to billions of dollars in damages, depending on how a jury answers a fundamental question in accounting: How much responsibility do auditors have for catching fraud? PricewaterhouseCoopers has maintained in court documents that its responsibility is to follow accounting principles ‚Äî which might not necessarily detect fraud. But in a pretrial brief issued by the trustee, former PricewaterhouseCoopers chairman Dennis Nally is quoted in a 2007 Wall Street Journal article saying that the \\"audit profession has always had a responsibility for the detection of fraud\\". =Ocala Funding; lawsuit by Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas= In 2005, Taylor Bean created and then subsequently operated a special-purpose entity subsidiary, Ocala Funding. Ocala was a conduit which purchased its home loans, and bundled them into securities which it then sold to Freddie Mac and other investors. It funded the mortgage loan business by selling $1.75 billion of worthless asset-backed commercial paper short-term notes to Deutsche Bank and the mortgage subsidiary of BNP Paribas. Deutsche Bank bought about $1.2 billion of the notes, and BNP had purchased about $480.7 million in the notes. Ocala hired Bank of America as both its trustee and collateral agent for the Ocala commercial paper. Prosecutors said that Ocala Funding engaged in what they stated was one of the largest bank frauds in United States history. In litigation unrelated to the Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Plan Trust, Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas sued Bank of America over the $1.75 billion in losses stemming from the fraud, saying their agreements required that Ocala hold $1.6 billion in cash or mortgage loans as collateral to be deposited with Bank of America, and that Bank of America breached its custodial and trustee obligations and improperly transferred billions of dollars of funds that were serving as collateral at Ocala's request.\\"Fair Game; Lawsuit Reveals the Problems Inside Wall Street‚Äôs Mortgage Machine\\", The New York Times The case is being heard by Judge Robert Sweet in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Sweet allowed some of the case to proceed in March 2011, writing that Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas had stated a \\"plausible claim\\" against Bank of America. In June 2012, Judge Sweet dismissed a counter-suit by Bank of America Corp. against the securities units of BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank, alleging negligence and breach of fiduciary duty on their behalf for their role in the sale of notes issued by Ocala Funding. Sweet held that the units, acting as brokers in the sale of the Ocala notes, owed \\"no duty ... to investigate or verify representations\\" made in a private placement. This lawsuit was settled in April 2015. =Executive convictions= Six individuals have pled guilty for their roles in the fraudulent scheme. On April 19, 2011, a federal jury in Alexandria, Virginia, convicted Lee Farkas, the majority owner of the company, of 14 counts of securities fraud, bank fraud, and wire fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud. According to the government case, the multibillion-dollar fraud caused the downfall of Colonial Bank and cheated investors and the government. The fraud began in 2002 when Taylor overdrew its account with Colonial BancGroup by several million dollars. Taylor Bean then promised to cover the amount by the end of the day in a process known as sweeping. When the overdrafts grew to over $100 million, mid-level Taylor Bean executives sold Colonial BancGroup $1 billion in mortgages that it did not own. Farkas and his co-conspirators caused Colonial BancGroup to file materially false financial data with the SEC regarding its assets in annual reports contained in Forms 10-K and quarterly filings contained Forms 10-Q. Colonial BancGroup's materially false financial data included overstated assets for mortgage loans that had little to no value. During his sentencing hearing on June 30, 2011, Farkas read a statement saying that he \\"strived to be a good person.\\" However, Federal District Judge Leonie Brinkema replied that she did not observe any genuine remorse, and sentenced the 58-year-old Farkas to 30 years in federal prison‚Äîat his age, effectively a life sentence. In 2012, federal appellate court upheld his convictions and sentence. But in 2013 he said he was innocent and asked a federal judge to set aside his convictions and prison sentence, arguing that his trial and appellate lawyers provided ineffective assistance, and that his trial lawyers should have sought a judgment of acquittal because the evidence against him was insufficient. In a 2014 prison interview, Farkas stated he gets \\"depressed a lot of days\\", has lost 43 pounds and most of his friends. No other senior Wall Street executives have been prosecuted for crisis-related conduct. Farkas is currently serving his sentence in a medium- security facility at the Butner Federal Correctional Complex in Butner, North Carolina, and is scheduled for release in 2037. The company's former chief executive and lead manager for Ocala Funding (Paul R. Allen, who admitted to allowing $1.5 billion in collateral to be misappropriated from Ocala and was sentenced in 2011 to 40 months in prison, followed by two years of supervised release) and treasurer (Desiree Brown, who was sentenced to six years in prison) pleaded guilty and cooperated in the case against Farkas, and other executives received sentences ranging from three months (senior financial analyst Sean Ragland) to eight years (Catherine Kissick, senior vice president and head of the Mortgage Warehouse Loan Division at Colonial Bank).

History The church was in existence by 1304. It was an originally a small church, standing amongst the slaughter-yards of the butchers of Eastcheap. In 1336, it was rebuilt on a much larger scale by John Lovekeyn, four-times Lord Mayor of London; later it received further benefactions from Sir William Walworth, who was Lord Mayor in 1374. The patronage of the church belonged first to the prior and convent of Christ Church, Canterbury until 1408, and later to the Archbishop of Canterbury, becoming one of 13 peculiarities in the City of London belonging to him. It was in the parish that the first cases of The Plague occurred in 1665.Samuel Pepys's Diary: April 30, 1665 (Dover, Lewis Publications 1992) After its destruction in the Great Fire of London, the church was rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren in 1687. The interior of the new church was 78 feet long, 46 feet wide and 32 feet high, with round-headed windows. James Peller Malcolm called Wren‚Äôs church \\"so plain as to be indescribable\\", noting only the Corinthian reredos, \\"the usual tablets\\" and the lack of an organ. There was a Portland stone tower, about 100 feet high, topped with a perforated parapet, with vases at its angles, and a spire‚Äîdescribed by James Elmes as \\"remarkably picturesque\\"‚Äîwith clock, weather-vane and cross. In 1789, Thomas Townsend left a house and funds to the Merchant Taylors Company to endow a weekly lecture and a clerical post at the church. His widow Susannah (d. 1810) left further funds to support this work. In 1831, the bequest was transferred to the church of St Magnus, London Bridge. The church was demolished in 1831\\"The London Encyclopaedia\\" Hibbert, C; Weinreb, D; Keay,J: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993,2008) to make way for the wider approaches needed for the rebuilt London Bridge.The Church Of St. Michael, Crooked Lane Correspondent not cited The Times, Thursday, Apr 07, 1831; pg. 3; Issue 14507; col F Its parish was united with that of St Magnus the Martyr. A stained-glass window in the church of St Magnus commemorates the former parish. Some of the monuments in the demolished church are now located in St Mark's Church, Kennington. Washington Irving gave a long description of the church in his famed work The Sketch Book (published originally in 1863, republished by Avenal Books/Crown Publishers in 1985), in the chapter entitled \\"The Boar's Head Tavern, Eastcheap\\". In searching for any remnants of Shakespeare's Falstaff, Irving hears about a picture of the original tavern in St. Michael's church, but to no avail.

It explores the evolution of big business through a legal and economic lens, and argues that in the modern world those who legally have ownership over companies have been separated from their control. The second, revised edition was released in 1967. It serves as a foundational text in corporate governance, corporate law (company law), and institutional economics. Berle and Means argued that the structure of corporate law in the United States in the 1930s enforced the separation of ownership and control because the corporate person formally owns a corporate entity even while shareholders own shares in the corporate entity and elect corporate directors who control the company's activities. Compared to the notion of personal private property, say as one's laptop or bicycle, the functioning of modern company law ‚Äúhas destroyed the unity that we commonly call property‚Äù. This occurred for a number of reasons, foremost being the dispersal of shareholding ownership in big corporations: the typical shareholder is uninterested in the day-to-day affairs of the company, yet thousands of people like him or her make up the majority of owners throughout the economy. The result is that those who are directly interested in day-to-day affairs, the management and the directors, have the ability to manage the resources of companies to their own advantage without effective shareholder scrutiny. > ‚ÄúThe property owner who invests in a modern corporation so far surrenders > his wealth to those in control of the corporation that he has exchanged the > position of independent owner for one in which he may become merely > recipient of the wages of capital... [Such owners] have surrendered the > right that the corporation should be operated in their sole interest...‚Äù at > 355 of the 1932 edition > ‚Äúthe owners most emphatically will not be served by a profit seeking > controlling group‚Äù.114 The implications of their work were clear. Berle and Means advocated embedded voting rights for all shareholders, greater transparency, and accountability. However, with the release of the revised edition, Berle and Means also pointed to the disparity that existed between those who did have shareholdings and those who did not. Introductory ;Introduction by Murray Weidenbaum and Mark Jensen Murray Weidenbaum and Mark Jensen have added their introduction to more recent editions of the text. It casts a thoroughly skeptical perspective on the book, since the two came from very different academic perspectives, generally more orthodox and conservative in their outlook politically. ;Property, Production and Revolution - A Preface to the Revised Edition by Adolf A. BerleThis was an article published separately and earlier as AA Berle, 'Property, Production and Revolution' (1965) 65 Columbia Law Review 1 For the 1967 Revised Edition, Berle added a new Preface, updating the picture and bringing in new arguments and observations. He summed up the whole point of the book at the same time, making it a valuable adjunct to the text. \\"Why have stockholders?\\" he asked. > \\"What contribution do they make, entitling them to heirship of half the > profits of the industrial system, receivable partly in the form of > dividends, and partly in the form of increased market values resulting from > undistributed corporate gains? Stockholders toil not, neither do they spin, > to earn that reward. They are beneficiaries by position only. Justification > for their inheritance must be sought outside classic economic > reasoning.‚Äùxxiii The position of stockholders' profit, said Berle, > ‚Äúcan be founded only upon social grounds. There is... a value attached to > individual life, individual development, individual solution of personal > problems, individual choice of consumption and activity. Wealth > unquestionably does add to an individual‚Äôs capacity and range in pursuit of > happiness and self-development. There is certainly advantage to the > community when men take care of themselves. But that justification turns on > the distribution as well as the existence of wealth. Its force exists only > in direct ratio to the number of individuals who hold such wealth. > Justification for the stockholder‚Äôs existence thus depends on increasing > distribution within the American population. Ideally the stockholder‚Äôs > position will be impregnable only when every American family has its > fragment of that position and of the wealth by which the opportunity to > develop individuality becomes fully actualized.‚Äù ;Implications of the Corporate Revolution in Economic Theory by Gardiner C. Means ;Preface (1932) ;Tables and charts Book I, Property in Flux Book I is entitled, \\"Property in Flux: Separation of the attributes of ownership under the corporate system\\" and provides a general picture of the shifting economic power structure that Berle and Means observed. =I Property in transition= This first chapter explores the basic thesis of Berle and Means, that with the emergence of the corporation, the very institution of private property has been fundamentally altered. > ‚ÄúIn its new aspect the corporation is a means whereby the wealth of > innumerable individuals has been concentrated into huge aggregates and > whereby control over this wealth has been surrendered to a unified > direction. The power attendant upon such concentration has brought forth > princes of industry, whose position in the community is yet to be defined. > The surrender of control over their wealth by investors has effectively > broken the old property relationships and has raised the problem of defining > these relationship anew. The direction of industry by persons other than > those who have ventured their wealth has raised the question of the motive > force back of such direction and the effective distribution of the returns > from business enterprise.‚Äù4 > ‚ÄúSuch an organization of economic activity rests upon two developments, each > of which has made possible an extension of the area under unified control. > The factory system, the basis of the industrial revolution, brought an > increasingly large number of workers directly under a single management. > Then, the modern corporation, equally revolutionary in its effect, placed > the wealth of innumerable individuals under the same central control. By > each of these changes the power of those in control was immensely enlarged > and the status of those involved, worker or property owner, was radically > changed. The independent worker who entered the factory became a wage > laborer surrendering the direction of his labor to his industrial master. > The property owner who invests in a modern corporation so far surrenders his > wealth to those in control of the corporation that he has exchanged the > position of independent owner for one in which he may become merely > recipient of the wages of capital.‚Äù5 Berle and Means continue by emphasizing how increasing dispersion of stock ownership under a shareholder public is necessary for those in control to enforce their position. Even if they have minority shareholding, the public so widespread is not in a position to be organized to hold those who handle their investments to account.6 The divergence of interest between owners and controllers, > ‚Äúhas destroyed the unity that we commonly call property - has divided > ownership into nominal ownership and the power formerly joined to it. > Thereby the corporation has changed the nature of profit-seeking > enterprise.‚Äù7 > ‚ÄúPrivate enterprise, on the other hand, has assumed an owner of the > instruments of production with complete property rights over those > instruments... Whereas the organization of feudal economic life rested upon > an elaborate system of binding customs, the organization under the system of > private enterprise has rested upon the self-interest of the property owner - > a self-interest held in check only by competition and the conditions of > supply and demand... Such self-interest has long been regarded as the best > guarantee of economic efficiency. It has been assumed that, if the > individual is protected in the right both to use his own property as he sees > fit and to receive the full fruits of its use, his desire for personal gain, > for profits, can be relied upon as an effective incentive to his efficient > use of any industrial property he may possess.‚Äù9 Shareholders, it is stated > ‚Äúcannot be motivated by those profits to a more efficient use of the > property, since they have surrendered all disposition of it to those in > control of the enterprise.‚Äù9 =II The appearance of the corporate system= The second chapter puts forward the view that corporations have entered, grown and become dominant first in the fields of public utilities, common carriers, banks and insurance companies and last in the areas of personal service and agriculture. It also goes on to emphasize the fact that the date of its appearance and degree of its dominance have in general varied with two factors * The public character of the activity in question * The amount of fixed capital required to carry on business =III The concentration of economic power= This part proceeds to emphasize the ubiquity of corporations in production in the modern economy. > ‚ÄúThese great companies form the very framework of American industry. The > individual must come in contact with them almost constantly. He may own an > interest in one or more of them, he may be employed by one of them, but > above all he is continually accepting their service.‚Äù19 > ‚ÄúIn conclusion, then, the huge corporation, the corporation with $90m of > assets or more, has come to dominate most major industries if not all > industry in the United States.‚Äù44 A number of consequences result, the fifth being that, > ‚ÄúThe economic power in the hands of the few persons who control a giant > corporation is a tremendous force which can harm or benefit a multitude of > individuals, affect whole districts, shift the currents of trade, bring ruin > to one community and prosperity to another. The organizations which they > control have passed far beyond the realm of private enterprise - they have > become more nearly social institutions.‚Äù46 =IV The dispersion of stock ownership= In this Chapter, Berle and Means present considerable statistical evidence of the growing dispersion of stock ownership around the economy. They draw a distinction between \\"passive\\" property, or that which merely sits idle or is consumed, and \\"productive\\" property, which is actually employed to create more wealth. They say, > ‚Äúover the enterprise and over the physical property - the instruments of > production - in which he has an interest, the owner has little control. At > the same time he bears no responsibility with respect to the enterprise or > its physical property. It has often been said that the owner of a horse is > responsible. If the horse lives he must feed it. If the horse dies he must > bury it. No such responsibility attaches to a share of stock. The owner is > practically powerless through his own efforts to affect the underlying > property... Physical property capable of being shaped by its owner could > bring to him direct satisfaction apart from the income it yielded in more > concrete form. It represented an extension of his own personality. With the > corporate revolution, this quality has been lost to the property owner much > as it has been lost to the worker through the industrial revolution.‚Äù64 While land could be enjoyed whatever its market value, Berle and Means point out that shares cannot. The fact that so much wealth is in shares means we are tied to the market in a way we never have been before.65 =V The evolution of control= This chapter traces the power that shareholders have to control managers. The most important instrument is the vote, and they note, > ‚ÄúIn contrast to non-voting preferred, the use of non-voting common stock has > met with considerable disfavor. Both the New York Stock Exchange and the New > York Curb have refused to list new issues of non-voting common stock; for > practical purposes, this would seem to have eliminated the use of this > device on any large scale in the immediate future.‚Äù72 Berle and Means note the development of Voting trusts, which initially met bitter opposition, being declared illegal by courts. This was the practice whereby voting powers were transferred from the stockholder to a trustee for a fixed period. State legislatures were needed to authorize their use, after Delaware allowed them but other courts struck them down. Berle and Means also deployed, uniquely, the concept of a shareholder's \\"rational apathy\\". > \\"the normal apathy of the small stockholder is such that he will either fail > to return his proxy vote, or will sign on the dotted line, returning his > proxy to the [management] of the corporation.\\"74 =VI The divergence of interest between ownership and control= On the divergence of interest, Berle and Means' central question is, > ‚Äúhave we any justification for assumption that those in control of a modern > corporation will also choose to operate it in the interests of the owners? > The answer to this question will depend on the degree to which the self- > interest of those in control may run parallel to the interests of ownership > and, insofar as they differ, on the checks on the use of power which may be > established by political, economic, or social conditions... If we are to > assume that the desire for personal profit is the prime force motivating > control, we must conclude that the interests of control are different from > and often radically opposed to those of ownership; that the owners most > emphatically will not be served by a profit-seeking controlling > group.‚Äù113-114 Book II, Regrouping of Rights Book II's full title is, \\"Regrouping of Rights: Relative legal position of ownership and \\"control‚Äú\\". Its subject is to explore the change in the balance of power between shareholders and the board of directors. =I Evolution of the modern corporate structure= Berle and Means begin by setting the context of the company's formation. Originally the company was granted privileges to be a separate legal person and carry on business, to sue and be sued and these rights usually went with the grant of a monopoly. The monopolies were no longer used now. But then came the easy registration of companies and limited liability for stockholders. > ‚ÄúFrom all this necessarily flowed a limited liability of the associates. > Since only the entity was liable for debts, which did not attach to the > various individuals, it followed that a stockholder was not normally liable > for any of the debts of the enterprise; and he could thus embark a > particular amount of capital in the corporate affairs without becoming > responsible beyond this amount, for the corporate debts.‚Äù120 In the United States, particularly at the time Berle and Means were writingFor the position today, see ¬ß141(k) DGCL and equivalents they noted two things which particularly compromised shareholder's power: vote by proxy and restrictions on removing directors.129 So far as for what objectives the company pursues they say, > ‚ÄúThe present corporation‚Äôs objects and the nature of the business in which > (so far as the charter goes) it can engage are commonly limited only by the > imagination of its organizing attorneys and their ability to embrace the > world within the limits of the English language.‚Äù130 =II Power over participation accruing to shares of stock= \\"The conclusion that can be drawn (from this chapter) is that the share of stock, while it represents a participation in corporate assets, does so subject to so many qualifications that the distinctness of the property right has been blurred to the point of invisibility. For protection the stockholder has only a set of expectations that the men who compose the management and control will deal fairly with his interest. He must rely for the most part not on legal rights but on economic significances ‚Äì on an accumulation of conditions which will make it desirable or advantageous for the purposes of the administration of the corporation to recognize a participation more or less meeting his expectation.\\" =III Power over the routing of earnings as between shares of stock= =IV Power to alter the original contract rights of security holders= =V The legal position of management= =VI The legal position of \\"control‚Äú= =VII Corporate powers as powers in trust= =VIII The resultant position of the stockholder= Berle and Means contrast the position of the owner of shares (passive property) and the owner of a horse (an example of active property). The one with the horse is ‚Äòmarried‚Äô to his physical property and must take responsibility for it. The stockholder's position is different. > ‚ÄúThe liquidity of property thus turns upon the determination of a market > price and the mechanism for such price-determining is the open market. > Curious as it may seem, the fact appears to be that liquid property, at > least under the corporate system, obtains a set of values in exchange, > represented by market prices, which are not immediately dependent upon, or > at least only obliquely connected with, the underlying values of the > properties themselves.‚Äù249-250 Book III, Property in the Stock Markets Book III's full title is \\"Property in the Stock Markets: Security exchanges as appraisers and liquidators\\". =I The function of the public market= =II Flotation and bankers' disclosure= =III Disclosure by the corporation to the market= =IV Management in the market= Book IV, Reorientation of Enterprise Book IV, entitled \\"Reorientation of Enterprise: Effects of the corporate system on fundamental economic concepts\\" is the shortest and aims to reassess some basic concepts in economic theory in light of the emergence of the corporation. =I The traditional logic of property= The traditional logic of property is that one will get all the gains and bear the losses associated with ownership. But now, since ownership has been separated from control, this no longer holds true. =II The traditional logic of profits= The traditional logic of profits, say Berle and Means, is that one will be motivated by the prospect of profiting from one's property. But again, with the separation of ownership from control, it is possible for managers to profit without working in shareholders' interests. > ‚ÄúWhere such a separation is complete one group of individuals, the security > holders and in particular the stockholders, performs the function of risk- > takers and suppliers of capital, while a separate group exercises control > and ultimate management. In such a case, if profits are to be received only > by the security holders, as the traditional logic of property would require, > how can they perform both of their traditional economic roles? Are no > profits to go to those who exercise control and in whose hands the efficient > operation of enterprise ultimately rests? ...Furthermore, if all profits are > earmarked for the security holder, where is the inducement for those in > control to manage the enterprise efficiently? When none of the profits are > to be received by them, why should they exert themselves beyond the amount > necessary to maintain a reasonably satisfied group of stockholders.‚Äù301 =III The inadequacy of traditional theory= Berle and Means go right back here to Adam Smith's oft cited disdain for joint stock companies, the idea that \\"negligence and profusion\\" would always prevail.304 They again emphasise the distinction between active and passive property.305 =IV The new concept of the corporation= This concluding part brings together the general thesis of the book. They finish by saying, > \\"The rise of the modern corporation has brought a concentration of economic > power which can compete on equal terms with the modern state - economic > power versus political power, each strong in its own field. The state seeks > in some aspects to regulate the corporation, while the corporation, steadily > becoming more powerful, makes every effort to avoid such regulation... The > future may see the economic organism, now typified by the corporation, not > only on an equal plane with the state, but possibly even superseding it as > the dominant form of social organization. The law of corporations, > accordingly, might well be considered as a potential constitutional law for > the new economic state, while business practice is increasingly assuming the > aspect of economic statesmanship.‚Äù357 ;Appendixes ;Statistical Appendix to Revised Edition by Gardiner C.

The removal of Hungary's border fence with Austria occurred in 1989 during the collapse of communism in Hungary, which was part of a broad wave of revolutions in various communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The dismantling of the electric fence along Hungary's long border with Austria was the first fissure in the \\"Iron Curtain\\" that had divided Europe for more than 40 years, since the end of World War II, and caused a chain reaction in East Germany that ultimately resulted in the demise of the Berlin Wall. History In April 1989, the Hungarian government ordered the electricity in the barbed-wire border fence along the Hungary‚ÄìAustria border turned off. On 2 May, border guards began removing sections of the barrier - filmed by Western TV crews summoned for the occasion. On 27 June Hungary's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Gyula Horn, and his Austrian counterpart, Alois Mock, held a symbolic fence-cutting ceremony at the Sopron (Hungary) border crossing. The open border meant that it was easier for Hungarians to cross into Austria for goods and services; many Hungarians availed themselves of this to purchase consumer goods which had been unavailable or scarce in their own country; a visible sign of this in the first few weeks was that many cars could be seen in Austrian towns such as Graz with washing machines strapped to them. The most famous crossing came on 19 August, when, during a \\"friendship picnic\\" between Austrians and Hungarians, over 900 East Germans on holiday in Hungary rushed the border and escaped into Austria and then travelled safely to West Germany.. The open border infuriated East German officials, who feared a return to the days before the Berlin Wall, when thousands of East Germans fled daily to West Berlin. Although worried, the Soviet Union took no overt actions against Hungary, taking a hands-off approach.

It was originally serialized in Big Comic in Japan 1970-1971 and was published in English translation in 2006 by Vertical Inc. This series is about a heroic young doctor named Kirihito Osanai and his efforts to cure a strange disease that deforms its victims so that they look like dog-people. He becomes infected with the disease himself and is led on a wild odyssey around the world as he is kidnapped and maltreated by the ignorant and the curious, meeting strange allies and stranger foes. Plot The intractable disease known as Monmow, whose cases are found only in the village of Inugamisawa ('Doggoddale' in the English translation) in the mountains of Tokushima prefecture, makes the bones of the whole body shrink and enlarge at the ends at the same time, changing the sufferer into a form like that of a dog, and ultimately causes death. Dr Tatsugaura of M University Hospital plans to publish his theory that Monmow is a virus and to win the chair as president of the medical society (or JMA, 'Japanese Medical Association') by the strength of that theory. Kirihito Osanai, an intern at M University Hospital, who with his passionate nature is generally liked, is a member of the Young Doctors' Association and is unknowingly disliked by Tatsugaura for that reason. He is ordered to do an on-site study of the disease, and despite the wish of his fianc√©e Izumi, goes to Doggodale. Everything proceeds as Tatsugaura has arranged. Osanai is confined within the village and marries a village girl named Tazu and by marrying her Osanai is safe from the wrath of the village, and is accepted by a majority of them. Osanai subsequently contracts Monmow. Even Izumi, who has come to search for him, cannot find any clue about his whereabouts. Meanwhile, Osanai's name is deleted from the register of the doctors at the M University under Tatsugaura's order. Osanai, assisted by Tazu who loves him for who he is, finds out that the cause of the Monmow is related to an old stratum that has dissolved into the river water, succeeds in overcoming the symptoms of the disease. Later Tazu is murdered by a rapist, and despite still obtaining a dog's face and body hair, Osanai embarks upon a quest of self-discovery, promising he would avenge her eventually. He crosses the ocean to Taiwan, and then to Syria, roaming with no destination. Along the way he endures many hardships including the loss of Reika, a circus performer who helped him escape from a sadistic Taiwanese millionaire. Meanwhile, Tatsugaura's scheme is steadily realized in Japan. Urabe, a colleague of Osanai, brings back Sister Helen of a South African convent who contracts Monmow. Urabe explains that Helen had drunk contaminated water and this relates to Osanai's theory that Monmow is endemic. He shows her in the medical conference where Tatsugaura makes a presentation. On the day of the election of the president of the JMA, Osanai appears at the site of voting, and reveals Tatsugaura's plan all along. Tatsugaura wins the election despite Osanai's revelation, but falls ill with Monmow. Rejecting various evidences proving that Monmow is not caused by a virus, Tatsugaura slips into a coma and dies. Helen also gives birth to Urabe's healthy, non-deformed baby. The story ends with Osanai (still in his dog-like form) returning to Syria, following a promise that he made to an Arab village he assisted. Izumi decides to follow him, and their future is left open-ended to the reader. Release The first Vertical Inc. edition of Ode to Kirihito is notable for having an unusual cover design by Chip Kidd which features a slider that, when moved to the left, reveals Kirihito's face after he has contracted Monmow's disease (Vertical has since republished Ode to Kirihito in two separate volumes with no slider).

It is a stick fighting martial art that has its roots from Africa, where two participants used fire-hardened wooden sticks, varying in length as weapons and carrying out fighting techniques. This art most likely came to Barbados during the 16th century through the Trans- Atlantic Slave Trade. The earliest reference to stick fighting in the Caribbean was from a lithograph completed in Dominica in 1779 by an Italian artist, Agostino Brunias. In the image, there are two persons in the middle and other stick fighters and watchers gathered around them; some who are willing to fight and others that are old and experienced observing and refereeing the fight. Stickfighting started to spread across the region with each culture having its own name. In Guadeloupe, its name was , while in Haiti and Trinidad, there were similar names, kalinda and kalenda respectively (Guyana ‚Äì Setu; Carricou ‚Äì Bois) and finally, the discussed art form Bajan Stick Licking. During the African Diaspora, many Africans brought their cultures, traditions and even their own style of combat with them to the archipelago. As one can see from above, Africa was filled with many different forms of stickfighting and knowing that before their long transatlantic journey they were separated, one can deduce that after their arrival in Barbados, there was an evolution of each individual art form. Stick Licking in Barbados probably also had influences from English, Irish and Indian influences, given that these countries had long histories of stickfighting traditions. Sticklicking is actively practiced in Barbados and is currently being taught with formal grading by the DBSS Sticklicking and Martial Arts Schools.

The game is common among Urdu speakers in Pakistan and India. It is similar to Antakshari, the Sistanian Baas-o-Beyt, the Malayalam Aksharaslokam and, more generally, the British Crambo.  Rules  The game starts with the first person reciting a stanza (bait) of a poem. Each following player has to reply with another verse starting with the last letter of the verse used by the previous player. A verse that has already been used in a game may not be repeated. The rules used by experienced players can be more stringent, such as allowing the use of only one poet's verses or of one theme.  History  The Urdu language has a very rich poetic tradition, and the game is very popular among poetry enthusiasts particularly in Pakistan. Schools and colleges regularly organize Bait Bazi competitions. Bait Bazi competitions are also held using radio, television and now the Internet. A very popular example is frequently played Bait Bazi of popular television show \\"Tariq Aziz Show\\" a.k.a. \\"Bazm-e-Tariq Aziz\\" formerly known as Neelam Ghar of PTV.

Biography of Kim Il-sung The first comprehensive biography of Kim Il-sung was published in Korean in North Korea in 1968. It was called Minjog≈≠i t'aeyang Kim Il-s≈èng changgun (Sun of the People, General Kim Il- sung). Although it was most likely written by a collective, it appeared under the name of Baik Bong. Before that, hagiography of Kim Il-sung had been identified with Han Sorya, but after he was purged, hagiography conventionally no longer appeared under the name of any one author. Baik's biography was published by the party in two volumes. It covered Kim Il-sung's life up to the end of 1967. That biography was translated into English in three volumes under the title Kim Il Sung Biography. The first volume is titled From Birth to Triumphant Return to Homeland, the second volume From Building Democratic Korea to Chollima Flight, and the third volume From Independent National Economy to 10-Point Political Programme. It has since become \\"the standard DPRK biography\\" of Kim Il-sung. A new version was Baik's biography was published in August 1972 as Ilyu haebang ≈≠i kus≈èng Kim Il-s≈èng w≈ènsu (Marshal Kim Il-sung, Liberator of Mankind), prompted by the fact that the nascent Juche ideology had now been attributed to Kim Il-sung from his youth, which had to be written into the story. During the 1970s, Pyongyang intensified its massive campaign to publish the works and feats of Kim Il-sung in several languages in order to promote its Juche ideology throughout the world (and in the third world in particular). =Factual accuracy= Baik devoted much of his work in the official biography to recount Kim Il-sung's struggle against the Japanese occupiers. Factual accuracy of many such anti-Japanese tales has been questioned. Baik also omits any mention of Kim Il-sung's association with the Northeastern People's Revolutionary Army.

Today the company is represented in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Uppsala, Borl√§nge, Malm√∂ and Ume√•. WikiLeaks used to be hosted in a Bahnhof data center inside the ultra-secure bunker Pionen, which is buried inside the White Mountains in Stockholm. History Bahnhof was founded in 1994 by Oscar Swartz. It was one of Sweden's first ISPs. The company is publicly traded since December 2007 under the name BAHN-B (Aktietorget). On 11 September 2008, Bahnhof opened a new computer center inside the former civil defence center Pionen in the White Mountains in Stockholm, Sweden. Controversies On 10 March 2005, the Swedish police confiscated four servers placed in the Bahnhof premises, hoping to find copyrighted material. Although these servers were located near Bahnhof's server park (in a network lab area) the company claimed they were not their property since they had been privately purchased by staff. They further presented evidence showing the material on these servers had been planted there by someone hired by Svenska Antipiratbyr√•n, a Swedish organisation fighting against copyright infringement. In 2009, Bahnhof generated controversy by failing to store the IP addresses of customers, in order to defeat the Swedish government's new laws on illegal file-sharing, transposing the EU IPRED regulations, which enabled ISPs to retain data longer than the data protection regulations would allow, in order for them to be available on police request. After the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks was kicked off of Amazon Web Services in December 2010, it bought server space from Bahnhof, as its chairman Jon Karlung revealed in press interviews after in the light of the new controversy created by the leaks about the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent), even showing journalists the two servers on which the data was held. The chairman said that WikiLeaks is treated like any other of Bahnhof's clients. In April 2014, however, the CJEU struck down the Data Retention Directive. PTS, Sweden's telecommunications regulator, told Swedish ISPs and telcos that they would no longer have to retain call records and internet metadata. But after two government investigations found that Sweden's data retention law did not break its obligations to the European Convention on Human Rights, the PTS reversed course. Most of Sweden's major telecommunications companies complied immediately, though Tele2 lodged an unsuccessful appeal. Bahnhof was the one holdout and it was given an order to comply by 24 November deadline or face a five million kronor ($680,000) fine. In response Bahnhof offered all their customers a free VPN-service. In October 2018, Elsevier secured a court order that required Swedish ISPs to block access to Sci-Hub websites. While complying with the order, Bahnhof also soft-blocked access to Elsevier website.

Otto Felix Kanitz ( 5 February 1894, in Vienna; 29 March 1940, in Buchenwald) was an Austrian socialist, journalist and educator. He was also part of the 'Sch√∂nbrunner Circle' (Sch√∂nbrunner Kreis).  Childhood  Kanitz was born as the third of four children of Jewish parents. After his parents divorced in 1902, the three sons stayed with the father whilst the daughter was adjudged to the mother. When the father converted to Catholicism and took a catholic wife, one year later, the sons were baptized as well, but soon given to an orphanage in order to not disturb their stepmother. Young Kanitz had five years of primary school and three years of secondary school before starting an apprenticeship.  Social activity  As soon as in 1911, he engaged in Max Winter's election campaign, and beginning in 1912 he gave speeches before youth groups. From 1916, he was active in the Kinderfreunde movement where he was mentored by Hermine Weinreb and Anton Afritsch. Besides his involvement in the aforementioned movement, he prepared matura, wrote poems and theater plays and contributed to the Kinderland journal. In 1918, after his matura, he was employed by Kinderfreunde and started to study philosophy and pedagogy with Wilhelm Jerusalem who considerably influenced his development towards tolerance, whilst strongly opposing institutionalized religion and any misuse of power.Extract from Lit. Kotlan-Werner as given in \\"75 Jahre...\\" pp. 42f. (German) His goal was to eradicate the 'Dienermentalit√§t' (servant mentality) which he felt was a characteristic of those of the supposed lower-classes under the Habsburg Monarchy. He had the opportunity to realize practical educational reforms together with Alfred Adler, Max Adler, Marianne Pollak, Josef Luitpold Stern and Otto Gl√∂ckel. Kanitz was a proponent of the Kinderrepublik, an anti-authoritarian education movement. After successfully running two such holiday camps in 1919, in Gm√ºnd, Lower Austria (the only such project ever to operate in Austria, which housed a total of some 700 children), he was appointed director of Kinderfreunde's newly to be founded Sch√∂nbrunn school: When after the breakdown of the Habsburg Monarchy Vienna's Vice Mayor Max Winter succeeded in getting a considerable part of Sch√∂nbrunn Palace84 rooms! See Volkshochschule Hietzing, Der Sch√∂nbrunner Kreis to establish a school for educators and teachers and a children's home, it was under the condition that they would start a project within a time period of three days. Kanitz memorial plaque at the outside of the Parliament building, Vienna. Kanitz then moved in with 100 of the participants from the holiday camp. Anton Tesarek was appointed director of the children's home in Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, while Kanitz was to lead the school. Meanwhile, Kranitz completed his PhD in 1922. Another one of his initiatives, a conference near Salzburg in 1922 with the co-founder of the German Kinderfreunde Kurt L√∂wenstein, resulted in founding the International Falcon Movement.  Second World War time  From 1932 to 1934, Kanitz was a member of the Federal Council of Austria. Kranitz's pamphlet K√§mpfer der Zukunft was banned by the Nazi beginning with their first book burnings in 1933. He was one of the many socialist authors of the inter-war period who were forced to move out of Austria after the 1934 anti-socialist crackdown. It is taken for granted that sooner or later he returned to Austria out of home-sickness. Being a Jew and a prominent socialist, he was taken into custody in November 1938 and sent to Buchenwald concentration camp where he is believed to have been executed. A plaque dedicated to Kanitz has been placed on the back of the Austrian Parliament Building in Vienna, and a street in Vienna's 23. district bears his name. Whether the grave with his name really contains his ashes is uncertain.As usually in such cases, his family was sent, by postal package, some ashes which were declared to be the deceased one's. The urn-grave is Nr. 76 in Section N, group 10 of Vienna's Heiligenst√§dter Friedhof since 9 April 2002.  References   Primary and Secondary Literature  * Kanitz, Otto Felix: K√§mpfer der Zukunft.

Thomas and his twin brother were born a month before the tragedy at the Royal Surrey Gardens Music Hall of 19 October 1856 while their father was preaching. Their mother, Susannah became an invalid at the age of 33 while the boys were still in their teens. After serving some time to an engraver, Thomas Spurgeon, like his brother Charles, decided to give his life to preaching the gospel. But his health prevented him from remaining in England. While he was still young he sailed to Australia, and spent one year in evangelistic labors there. After his return to England it was decided that he must return to a better climate for his health. During the early 1880s he preached in many places in Australia, as well as in New Zealand; and finally he decided to accept the pastorate of a Baptist church in Auckland, the Auckland Baptist Tabernacle, where his influence was already becoming widely felt. Thomas returned to England after the death of his father and succeeded him in his pulpit ministry after a brief period under Arthur Tappan Pierson. During Thomas' fifteen-year pastorate, the Tabernacle burned in 1898 and was rebuilt along similar lines. His brother Charles was pastor of the Greenwich Baptist Church.

Planning of the college started in 1966 when a 12-person planning committee chaired by Professor Reynolds (founding dean of Furness) was established to design the buildings and faculties of the college. The Committee worked for two years and the college was officially opened in 1968. The main college building occupies a central location on the campus, being just to the south of Alexandra Square. The colleges latest rejuvenation occurred in the 2011/2012 academic year, which included a substantial redevelopment of the building interior to accommodate both the college and the Faculty of Health and Medicine. The college is named after the Furness area, part of the Duchy of Lancaster and the historic county of Lancashire. Trevor Trevor, the college bar was previously named Furness Bar but was renamed following refurbishments in the 1980s after a vote by the members of the college. Trevor specialises in real ale and has appeared in the CAMRA Good Beer Guide. The bar is also generally the venue for college social events, various campus societies and a wine club which is headed by the college wine steward. Symbols The Furness College motto is Everywhere else is nowhere, summing up the social and community reputation of the college. Following a major branding exercise by the University in 2008, the college's long standing colours of purple and silver were officially adopted, replacing the often used red, orange, black and white. The logo was also re-drawn in line with the university wide re-branding of the colleges.  Residence blocks  The college residences are named after villages, houses or fells in the Furness region. The nine original residence blocks were demolished in August 2004 to make way for site redevelopment with much larger ensuite buildings. The original buildings were named Dalton, Colton, Aldingham, Hawkshead, Pennington, Kirkby-Ireleth, Ulverston, Urswick and Lowick. The five houses named Furness Perimeter were constructed in 1992. Furness Central re-used the names of four of the original buildings when the new buildings opened in September 2006.

It is located in the Matap√©dia Valley between the Chic-Choc Mountains of the Appalachian near Lake Matap√©dia. The main activities of the village are agriculture and forestry. It has a population of approximately 2,000, the third biggest municipality in its RCM after Amqui and Causapscal. Due to the presence of the chipboards plant called Panval, the biggest industry of the valley, Sayabec is an important regional economic centre. The territory was historically occupied by Mi'kmaq people, a First Nation who occupied much of the Gaspe Peninsula. Its first French Canadian inhabitant was Pierre Brochu, who came in 1833. At the end of the 19th century settlers began to come in the region to work in sawmills. The municipality was first officially created in 1887 as a school municipality under the name Sainte-Marie-de-Sayabec. The catholic parish was erected in 1894. In 1917, the village of Saindon was created, and it took the name of Sayabec in 1951. Today municipality was formed in 1982 through the merger of the parish municipality of Sainte-Marie-de-Sayabec and the village municipality of Sayabec. The municipality's main transportation link is the Quebec Route 132 which loops around the Gaspe Peninsula back towards the Mont- Joli area northwest of Sayabec. It is also located along the Canadian National Railway (originally the Intercolonial Railway).  Toponymy  Sayabec is pronounced \\"Say-bec\\" (/se.b…õk/). This name comes from the Mi'kmaq language word sepeg, which means \\"full river\\" or \\"river obstructed by a beaver dam\\". In fact, the actual Mi'kmaq word is sakpediak, sak meaning \\"river\\" and pediak \\"full\\", but the Mi'kmaq used to say \\"sakbak\\" to be shorter. Other sources say that the name is from the Mi'kmaq word siapeg, which means \\"extension of the lake\\" or \\"small gulf\\". Demonyms of Sayabec are \\"Sayab√©cois\\" for male gender and \\"Sayab√©coise\\" for female..  Geography  View of the Chic-Choc Mountains from Sayabec Sayabec is located to the south of Saint Lawrence River on the Gaspe Peninsula in the Matap√©dia Valley.

Bordering municipalities are Saint-Mo√Øse to the west, Val-Brillant to the east, Saint-Cl√©ophas to the south and Sainte-Paule to the north. Sayabec is divided into two sections: the main section located near Lake Matap√©dia, and a second section near Lake Malcolm known as the hamlet of Lac-Malcolm. Sayabec covers 130 km2. Forests cover 47.9% of this territory, 8.4% is water and the rest (43.7%) is treeless. Approximately 35% of the territory is propitious for agriculture.. Sayabec is part of La Matap√©dia Regional County Municipality in the administrative region of Bas-Saint- Laurent. The catholic parish of Sayabec named Saint-Nom-de-Marie is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rimouski.. The municipality is part of the touristic region of Gasp√©sie.. The geography of Sayabec is located in the mountains range of the Appalachian on a side of Chic-Choc Mountains in the section of Notre Dame Mountains. It is at an altitude of 200 m and the summits reach 350 m. Lake Matap√©dia The territory of Sayabec encompasses two watersheds. The first one sheds into Lake Matap√©dia, and covers approximately 60% of the territory. It includes Lake Matap√©dia as well as Sayabec and Saint Pierre Rivers. Lake Matap√©dia is known for lake and brook trout fishing. The second watershed empties into Blanche River and covers 40% of the territory. It includes mainly Malcolm and Squaw Lakes as well as Blanche, Arthur, Edouard and Sauvages Rivers. Malcolm Lake to the north of the village is known for fishing, nautical activities and camping.

Transportation  Map of the center of Sayabec Rue de l'√âglise (Church Street) Sayabec is located on the main transportation axis of the Gaspe Peninsula: Quebec Route 132. It is also located on the Canadian National Railway. Via Rail operates two passenger trains on this railway: Le Chaleur and L'Oc√©an. They stop at Sayabec at a railway stop on demand. Intercity buses of Orl√©ans Express serve Sayabec, using the Route 132 in direction of Rimouski and Matap√©dia, Quebec. The closest regional airport is located in Mont-Joli at 43 km to the northwest of Sayabec. Sayabec was the first village of the province of Quebec to adopt macadam roads as soon as 1910, before the arrival of asphalt on the market.  History  = Early history = Mi'kmaq camp, circa 1857 The region was first frequented by the Mi'kmaq First Nation, beginning before the 17th century. In 1694, the lordship of Lake Madapequia was granted to Charles-Nicolas-Joseph D'Amours by the New France's governor, Louis de Buade de Frontenac. However, despite the laws of the time, this owner never inhabited nor exploited this territory, and he didn't officially bequeathed it. It is the construction of Kempt Road from 1830 to 1832 and Matap√©dia Road from 1847 to 1862 that allowed the colonization of the Matap√©dia Valley. Afterwards, the Intercolonial Railway, built from 1870 to 1872, has been an important catalyst for the development of the forest industry in the valley. Roadside cross erected in 1875 by Marceline Brochu, wife of Pierre Brochu The first inhabitant of Matap√©dia Valley was Pierre Brochu (1795-1871) born in Saint-Vallier, Bellechasse, who settled down at the tip of Matap√©dia Lake in 1833. He was operating a guard post along Kempt Road to offer relief and lodging to travellers and postilions. He occupied this position until his death in 1871. Around 1850 he sat up a sawmill at the head of Matap√©dia Lake. After his death his second wife Marcella Dumas continued to cultivate the land at this place for eight years. Even if the first settler established himself as soon as 1833, it is the establishment of John Fenderson Company at the end of the 19th century that attracted more settlers in Sayabec. From this moment, more settlers, mainly from Rimouski and Matane counties, moved to Sayabec to work in the sawmills or to clear lands. From then on the forestry vocation of Sayabec was set and more people came to work in the sawmills then to settle as farmers. The Fenderson family was the first real industrials of the valley. They bought a shingle mill in 1896. This mill was destroyed by fire the next year, and John Fenderson built a new sawmill for timbers and shingles as well as a plant for wood finishing. In 1910 he bought the lordship of Matap√©dia Lake as well as the sawmill of Val-Brillant, Quebec. The sawmill for timbers closed in 1918, and has been demolished in 1922, but the sawmill for wood finishing continued to operate full-time. Around 80% of products were exported to the United States. In 1922 John Fenderson & Company built a plant to transform hardwood into wood flooring. At the time it was the biggest industry in all Eastern Quebec, employing around 400 people. John Fenderson & Company's plants has been sold to John Fenderson Lumber Limited Company, and then to Domaine Seigneurial, before being definitely closed in 1952. = Development of the municipality = The municipality was first officially created on February 18, 1887 as a school municipality instead of a parish municipality unlike as usual in Quebec, because education was important for local settlers. The first school was built in 1892. For the construction of this school each Sayab√©cois had to provide 24 ft of 8 ft long squared cedar for each arpent of land he possessed. In 1885 a catholic mission was established under the name of Sainte-Marie-de-Sayabec. The catholic parish had been canonically erected on November 29, 1894, and the first priest was Joseph-Cl√©ophas Saindon, beginning on October 2, 1896. The parish municipality had been officially created on April, 1st 1895 under the same name of the mission established five years before. On May 20, 1895 the municipal council unanimously adopted a motion stipulating that French was the only language used in debates and municipal affairs. The first aqueduct was built in 1903. The same year started the construction of the first stone church. The caisse populaire (credit union) had been established in 1907 by the priest Joseph-Cl√©ophas Saindon. The phone had been installed before the electricity, when the first switchboard was commissioned in 1908. In 1910 Sayabec became the first village of the province of Quebec to adopt macadam roads, when it applied it on route de l'√âglise (Church Road). Between 1912 and 1917 the grand chemin Matap√©dia (Matap√©dia Big Road) also known as chemin Militaire (Military Road) had been macadamized. In 1911 Compagnie √©lectrique d'Amqui (Amqui Electric Company) built an hydroelectric power plant downstream of Matap√©dia Lake in order to provide electricity to Amqui, Val-Brillant and Sayabec. This allowed the installation of street lightning in 1914. Compagnie √©lectrique d'Amqui held the exclusivity on the electric network for a 25 years period in exchange of providing street lightning. In 1922 Compagnie de Pouvoir du Bas-Saint-Laurent (Bas-Saint-Laurent Power Company) owned by Jules-Andr√© Brillant bought Compagnie √©lectrique d'Amqui and became the only power distributor in the region until the nationalization of electricity in Quebec in 1963. Sayabec's church In 1912 the railway station opened. On March 28, 1917 the village split into two municipalities, when the village municipality of Saindon separated from the parish municipality of Sayabec. The village was named after the first priest, canon Joseph-Cl√©ophas Saindon. On May 19, 1921 the village was once more divided, when the parish municipality of Saint-Cl√©ophas was founded. Once again it had been named after priest Saindon. In 1927 Sainte-Paule, which was until then a mission of the catholic parish of Sayabec, separated to form its own municipality. In the 1920s the village counted 500 families. On February 18, 1929 a lightning destroyed most of the church; it has been rebuilt with the original walls in 1931. In May 1941 a corps of peace officers had been founded to ensure public order. In 1942, Sayab√©cois adopted a strong position against conscription. At the beginning of the 1950s Sayabec counted a total of nine schools. In 1951 the village of Saindon adopted the name of Sayabec. The first telephone code assigned to Sayabec was \\"748\\", but in 1969 the current code \\"536\\" had been assigned to Sayabec and Saint-Cl√©ophas. On March 6, 1962 an office of the Police provinciale du Qu√©bec (Quebec Provincial Police) opened in Sayabec; it closed on April 30, 1963. The municipality bought its first snowplow in 1969. On January 5, 1976 the municipality office had been sat up in the current city hall, which was an old Daughters of Jesus residence bought by the Matap√©dia School District. On December 24, 1982 the Parish Municipality of Sainte-Marie-de-Sayabec and the Village Municipality of Sayabec had been merged into one municipality under the current name of Sayabec. HLMs in Sayabec Pavillon Saindon In 1968 eight HLMs had been built under a program of Soci√©t√© d'habitation du Qu√©bec (Quebec Housing Corporation). In 1984 an eleven-tenant building for the elderly called Pavillon Chanoine Saindon was built, and in 1990 a second eleven-tenant building for elderly called Appartements J.-A. Ross was built next to the first. Those lodging units are managed by the Sayabec Municipal Housing Office. Following a governmental decree of July 1, 1986 Sayabec had to close its municipal opencast dump, which opened in 1951. From then on, Sayabec's waste are transported to the regional landfill in Amqui. In 1988 Hydro-Qu√©bec installed a new power distribution station in Sayabec. On February 20, 1987 the municipality bought a warehouse to establish its municipal garage in order to house fire protection vehicles and municipal machinery. Panval On February 19, 1981 the implantation of the panels-furniture plant was officially announced. On August, 20 of the same year the Quebec Premier Ren√© L√©vesque came to Sayabec. The Crown corporation Rexfor and the German firm Kunz were the two main shareholders of this plant named Panneaux de la Vall√©e shortened into Panval. On December 5, 1982 a thanksgiving mass had been celebrated at the occasion of the start of operations of Panval. Doctor Kunz himself attended this mass, and stated that this religious celebration was a first between all his plants around the world. In 1987 Panval was enlarged by the addition of a third laminating press, and then became the largest producer of laminated panels in North America. In 1989 Panval employed 425 full-time employees, and occupied 62,700 sq m. More than 1,000 trucks by month served the plant. However, the NAFTA had a bad impact on the production of Panval, and its personnel had been reduced to 225 employees. As of 2012, the plant belongs to Uniboard Canada and is the largest industry in the region.

Adults are white with gray back and wings, black wingtips with white spots, and pink legs. Immature birds are gray-brown and are darker and more uniform than European herring gulls, with a darker tail. It occurs in a variety of habitats including coasts, lakes, rivers and garbage dumps. Its broad diet includes invertebrates, fish, and many other items. It usually nests near water, laying around three eggs in a scrape on the ground. Taxonomy This gull was first described as a new species in 1862 by Elliott Coues based on a series of specimens from the Smithsonian Institution. It was later reclassified as a subspecies of the herring gull (Larus argentatus). The genus name is from Latin Larus, which refers to a gull or other large seabird. The species name smithsonianus commemorates English chemist James Smithson whose ¬£100,000 bequest enabled the foundation of the institution that bears his name. The taxonomy of the herring gull group is very complicated and much is still controversial and uncertain. A 2002 study suggested that the American herring gull is not closely related to European herring gulls, belonging instead to a separate clade of gulls.Sangster, George; J. Martin Collinson; Alan G. Knox; David T. Parkin & Lars Svensson (2007). Taxonomic recommendations for British birds: 4th report, Ibis, 149 (4): 853-857. Several authorities such as the Association of European Rarities Committees and British Ornithologists' Union now recognize it as a separate species. The BOU also includes the Vega gull (Larus vegae) of northeastern Asia within the American herring gull. The American Ornithologists' Union has not adopted the split and continues to treat the American herring gull as a subspecies of Larus argentatus.Larus argentatus, AOU checklist Description Newfoundland Juvenile and adult in North Carolina It is a heavily built large gull with a long powerful bill, full chest and sloping forehead.Dubois, Philippe J.

Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is and the tarsus is . Breeding adults have a white head, rump, tail, and underparts and a pale gray back and upperwings. The wingtips are black with white spots known as \\"mirrors\\" and the trailing edge of the wing is white. The underwing is grayish with dark tips to the outer primary feathers. The legs and feet are normally pink but can have a bluish tinge, or occasionally be yellow. The bill is yellow with a red spot on the lower mandible. The eye is bright, pale to medium yellow, with a bare yellow or orange ring around it. In winter, the head and neck are streaked with brown. First-cycle bird in Texas Young birds take four years to reach fully adult plumage. During this time they go through several plumage stages and can be very variable in appearance. First-winter birds are gray-brown with a dark tail, a brown rump with dark bars, dark outer primaries and pale inner primaries, dark eyes, and a dark bill, which usually develops a paler base through the winter. The head is often paler than the body. Second-winter birds typically have a pale eye, pale bill with black tip, pale head and begin to show gray feathers on the back. Third-winter birds are closer to adults but still have some black on the bill and brown on the body and wings and have a black band on the tail. =Voice= It has no song but has a variety of cries and calls. The \\"long call\\" is a series of notes during which the head is dipped then raised. The \\"choking call\\" is produced during courtship displays or territorial disputes.Stokes, Donald & Lillian Stokes (1996). Stokes Field Guide to Birds: Eastern Region. Little, Brown & Co. Juvenile birds emit high- pitched plaintive cries to elicit feeding behavior from a parent and may also emit a clicking distress call when a parent suddenly flies off. =Similar species= Adult European herring gulls are very similar to American herring gulls but those of the subspecies L. a. argenteus are smaller than many American birds while those of the northern subspecies L. a. argentatus are typically darker gray above. European birds lack the long gray tongues on the 6th, 7th, and 8th primaries and solid black markings on the 5th and 6th primaries that are shown by American herring gulls.Clarke, Tony; Chris Orgill & Tony Disley (2006). Field Guide to the Birds of the Atlantic Islands. Christopher Helm, London. First-winter European birds have more checkered upperparts, more streaked underparts, and a paler rump and base to the tail. Distribution and habitat Adult in winter plumage, Cape May Point, New Jersey The breeding range extends across the northern part of North America from central and southern Alaska to the Great Lakes and north-east coast of the United States from Maine south to North Carolina. It breeds over most of Canada apart from the southwest and Arctic regions. Birds are present all year in southern Alaska, the Great Lakes and north-east USA but most birds winter to the south of the breeding range as far as Mexico with small numbers reaching Hawaii, Central America and the West Indies. Vagrants have reached Colombia and Venezuela and there is a report from Ecuador and another from Peru.Mata, Jorge R. Rodriguez; Francisco Erize & Maurice Rumboll (2006).

The first European record was of a bird ringed in New Brunswick which was caught on a boat in Spanish waters in 1937 and there have been a number of additional records from Western Europe since 1990. The first British record was in 1994 in Cheshire.Quinn, David (2009). American Herring Gull in Cheshire & Wirral: new to Britain British Birds 102(6):342-7 It usually nests in colonies near water on coasts, islands, and cliffs. It also nests on rooftops in some cities. It feeds at sea and on beaches, mudflats, lakes, rivers, fields, and refuse dumps. It roosts in open areas close to feeding sites. Behavior Two fledglings resting on a rock on the shore on Lake Ontario =Feeding= Herring gull eating a crab Herring gull stomping feet to help find prey It has a varied diet, including marine invertebrates such as mussels, crabs, sea urchins, and squid; fish such as capelin, alewife, and smelt; insects; and other birds including their chicks and eggs. It often feeds on carrion and human refuse. Food is plucked from the surface of the shore or sea or is caught by dipping underwater or by shallow plunge-diving. They also feed on clams and mussels by dropping them from a height on hard surfaces such as roads or rocks to break their shells. There is some question about whether this behavior is learned or innate, although it seems to be learned. =Reproduction= Pairs form in March or April. The nest is a scrape on the ground lined with vegetation such as grass, seaweed, and feathers. Usually three eggs are laid over a four- to six-day period. They are long and are variable in color with brown markings on a pale blue, olive or cinnamon background.Ehrlich, Paul R.; David S. Dobkin & Darryl Wheye (1988). The Birder's Handbook: a field guide to the natural history of North American birds. Simon & Schuster, New York. The eggs are incubated for 30‚Äì32 days beginning when the second egg is laid. The young birds fledge after 6‚Äì7 weeks and are fed in the nest area for several more weeks. They continue to be cared for by the parents until they are about 6 months old. Both parents are involved in building the nest, incubating the eggs and feeding the young. It has been observed that some pairs cement a close bond, staying in watchful proximity of each other year-round; Other gulls display more independence, but may take the same mate each spring. Status The species became quite rare during the 19th century when it was hunted for its eggs and feathers. From the 1930s to the 1960s, it increased rapidly due to protection from hunting, increased waste from fisheries to feed on, and less competition for small fish and invertebrates as humans reduced the populations of large fish, whales, and pinnipeds (seals). It was one of many impacted by high DDT usage, and was the target of the study that first linked DDT to eggshell thinning. Population growth leveled off during the 1970s and 80s and may now be declining in some areas.

The Trent UK Accreditation Scheme, or TAS UK, ceased to operate in May 2010, when a majority of Board members decided to end the scheme. Subsequently, a number of independent accreditation schemes were set up, including the British-based scheme QHA Trent Accreditation. History of the scheme The logo of the former Trent Accreditation Scheme Trent's basic mission resembled that of the USA's Joint Commission International, or JCI, and other major international healthcare accreditation groups, although there were some significant differences in the way the different groups worked. Apart from hospitals in the United Kingdom, Trent also surveyed a large number of private sector hospitals in Hong Kong. and at the time of its demise had been developing links with hospitals in Cyprus. The approach Trent took to Clinic and Hospital Accreditation was based on the axiom that no single healthcare system, whether European, American, Asian or otherwise in origin, has the right to claim a monopoly viewpoint over what represents acceptable quality and best clinical practice throughout the world, and no one country has the absolute right to tell another how their hospitals should be run. What is vital is that the quality of care which patients receive should be of the highest possible standard, and also that the hospitals and clinics providing that care should be independently capable when it comes to working out how best to maintain those standards and how best to respond to any new challenges which will inevitably come along. If the overall standards of a hospital or clinic can be shown to be of acceptable quality, then it is desirable, and even ideal, that local differences related to culture and to legislation should be specifically discussed and incorporated into the assessment standards in an appropriate fashion. That said, Trent was very interested in the medical ethical standards of the hospitals it worked with. To achieve all of this, Trent worked in close partnership with participating hospitals and clinics to generate an appropriate and mutually acceptable set of standards to survey against. Because the world of healthcare is constantly changing, the standards were constantly reviewed and up-dated through a system of working jointly with representatives of partner hospitals. Trent developed various ways to ensure local participation, and even ownership, over the accreditation process in a locality. Trent utilised UK-sourced surveyors who were either working in the British National Health Service, or NHS, or had retired in recent times, and hence have valuable experience and insight \\"at the coal face\\", and in Hong Kong Trent also appoints locally domiciled surveyors (see later). Trent surveyors are drawn from a wide variety of professional backgrounds, but especially from the worlds of medicine, dentistry, nursing, the professions complementary to medicine (e.g. physiotherapy, pharmacy etc.) and healthcare management/administration, so as to ensure an appropriately broad portfolio of knowledge and skills are always present within the surveying teams and the wider organisation. Surveyors were all volunteer professionals rather than salaried employees. Trent surveys were not just a matter of working through a ‚Äútick-list‚Äù of standards, a process which Trent believed might elevate standards to a certain level but nevertheless do little to inculcate a culture of ‚Äúthinking for oneself‚Äù ‚Äì instead, Trent surveys involved direct face-to- face conversation with all levels of staff, including clinical medical staff and senior management (for this reason, qualified medical doctors are included in all surveying teams organised by Trent) and Trent surveyors expected full freedom to go anywhere in the hospital or clinic under survey and to talk to anyone they choose to. Discussion and analysis of the data thus generated, not only by the Trent team but also by the hospital or clinic under survey, represented a major component of Trent's approach to hospital and clinic accreditation, and reflected an underlying philosophy that the whole process was about improving services to patients and the ability of an organisation to work effectively towards that aim. Trent surveyors evaluated a vast range of modalities of a hospital's (or clinic's) activities and governance, including management, estates, equipment, clinical audit, research, education and training, as well as clinical/medical activity. In Hong Kong hospitals, survey teams always consisted of 2 or 3 surveyors from the UK working together with (usually) 2 based in Hong Kong and who were actively working in the local hospitals. One surveyor will be nominated as the lead. The Hong Kong-based surveyors were nominated by the participating hospitals, and after receiving training they always surveyed hospitals other than their own. This approach led to unrivaled opportunity and potential for the sharing of ideas about best practice between hospitals working in the same locality, and the development of camaraderie. Also, patients were spoken to, and their views and experiences also sought. At the end of a survey, the key findings were initially presented by the Lead Surveyor to the hospital or clinic undergoing the survey, this event taking place almost always on the last day. The findings were subsequently digested, analysed and put into a more detailed printed report, with positive virtues being highlighted as well as problems. However, because of the end-of-survey oral presentation, hospitals and clinics could start putting remedial action into place as soon as possible. After a round of surveys, a joint meeting was held at which the printed reports of all the hospital and clinic surveys conducted in that particular round are discussed jointly and in depth by the Trent Board (which had both local and UK representation) together with senior representatives of the hospital or clinic being surveyed, and a decision was then taken as to whether or not accreditation would be granted unconditionally, or if it would be subject to conditions. The Trent approach to accreditation ensured that the local hospitals and clinics enjoyed some ownership over the whole process, which would not be the case if all of the standards, all of the surveyors and all of the decisions regarding who was successful or not in achieving accreditation were imposed unilaterally from outside. It helped to build up the confidence of participating hospitals in their ability to develop ways to maintain and improve quality in a way that schemes which operate da more didactic approach to standards and their assessment would not. It also meant that there were Trent surveyors constantly present in the majority of the scheme's participating hospitals. Trent was a member of the United Kingdom Accreditation Forum (UKAF) and an institutional member of ISQUA . International Healthcare Accreditation With the advent of medical tourism, international healthcare accreditation has increasingly grown in importance. A number of accreditation organisations sourced from a number of countries fulfil this internationally orientated role, including: *Accreditation Canada International (formerly \\"The Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation\\", or CCHSA) *Joint Commission International (JCI), in the United States *The Australian Council on Healthcare Standards, or ACHS *QHA Trent Accreditation (UK) No single accreditation scheme enjoys exclusive rights to be seen as an overall world-wide-relevant scheme, and some hospitals are looking towards multiple accreditation to achieve performance credibility in different parts of the world. The Trent Scheme was the first accreditation scheme to survey and accredit a hospital in Asia, in Hong Kong in 2000 . Since then others such as JCI have entered the market, with JCI first accrediting Bumrungrad International Hospital in Thailand in 2002. Closure of Trent Accreditation Scheme The UK-based Trent Accreditation Scheme (TAS UK) ceased surveying and accreditation activities in 2010. Subsequently, the British- based scheme QHA Trent Accreditation began operating.

It is the headquarters of the Cherupuzha Panchayat which is a special grade panchayat in Kerala. https://dop.lsgkerala.gov.in ‚Ä∫ node Location It is located about 31 km east of taluk HQ Payyanur, 66 km north east of district HQ Kannur, 524 km from Capital city Thiruvananthapuram, 332 km away from Eranakulam, 150 km from Kozhikode, 121 km away from Mangalore and 326 km from Bangalore.  History  Cherupuzha and its surrounding areas was ruled by many royal dynasties in the past, including the Mooshika dynasty of Ezhimala, Chirakkal dynasty of Kolathunadu, Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore, before it became a part of the British Raj. The original inhabitants of the area were primarily Hindus. Later on this region gained a sizable Christian and Muslim population. Now the place has Christians as majority. The arrival of Christians from middle Kerala helped in the development of this place, this led to the construction of schools, colleges, hospitals etc. in the area. The economy was agrarian with strong feudal system - Janmi-Kudiyan system - permeating everyday life in past and in the present mainly small and medium farmers. Geography Cherupuzha is a hilly town (part of Western Ghats) on the eastern side of Kannur district. The terrain is undulating in nature and the extreme eastern side has forests bordering Karnataka state. Connectivity Satellite towns that are nearby and places at a longer distance which has direct bus route from Cherupuzha includes Pulingome, Palavayal, Kozhichal, Thirumeni, Padiyotchal, Peringome, Chittarikkal, Vellarikundu, Panathur, Alakkode, Chemperi, Payyavoor, Iritty, Payyanur, Kanhangad, Taliparamba, Kannur, Kasaragod, Kozhikode, Mangalore, Bangalore, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Thodupuzha, Pala, Kottayam, Pathanamthitta etc. These population centres are well connected to Cherupuzha by road. =Water bodies= Tejaswini River, also called \\"kariankode puzha\\" in Malayalam, which is comparatively small among 44 rivers of Kerala, flows beside this town. It originates from Brahmagiri hills of Coorg forest in Karnataka, enters Kerala near Pulingome, flows through the districts of Kannur and Kasaragod and meets the Arabian Ocean, near Nileshwaram as a part of Valiyaparamba Backwaters. Tejaswini, which is 64 km long, do have a rafting stretch of 20 km with plenty of rapids extending up to class-3.

All of them are international airports but direct flights are available only to Middle Eastern countries. = Rail = The nearest railway station is 34 km away Payyanur on Shoranur-Mangalore Section. Direct trains are available to Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Mangalore, Ernakulam, Kozhikode, Thiruvananthapuram, Chennai and other parts of the country. =Roads= Kerala Hill Highway (SH 59) passes through Cherupuzha town connects it with Iritty and Mysore, Bangalore can be accessed on the eastern side. The National Highway(NH 66) passes through Perumba junction through proposed Ezhimala - Bagamandalam Highway. Goa and Mumbai can be accessed on the northern side and Cochin and Thiruvananthapuram can be accessed on the southern side. Two main roads are Cherupuzha-Payyanur and Cherupuzha - Alakode. All the other roads in this area were built by the people themselves. The roads, Cherupuzha-Pulingome ‚Äì Kottathalachi, Edavaramba ‚Äì Koombankunnu, Kariyakkara ‚Äì Koombankunnu, Cherupuzha-Pulingome-Rajagiri, Rajagiri-Josegiri, Vazhakkundam ‚Äì Churappadavu, Chunda ‚Äì Vilakkuvettam and Umayanchal ‚Äì Kottathalachi are examples of the collective effort of people of Cherupuzha and Pulingome. Another important road in the area is Cherupuzha-Thirumeni- Muthuvom road which is of a length of 9 kilometers. From Thirumeni, one can reach to its outskirts like Chathamangalam, Thabore, Muthuvom and Korali. Both private and public transport buses are available from Cherupuzha to Kannur, Kozhikode, Cochin and Bangalore.  Ezhimala-Bengaluru road  A new bridge, for ezhimla- Payyannur-Cherupuzha-Pulingome - Talakkaveri-Bhagamandala-Bengaluru road, has already been constructed over Pulingome river near Cherupuzha, connecting Kerala and Karnataka. Talks are on between Karnataka, Kerala and central Governments on this project. If this road became a reality, the distance to Bangalore and Mysore would be reduced by more than 60 kilometers also 120 kilometers between Kannur and Bangalore. Cherupuzha-Chittarikkal This road stretching across Kerala, connecting Kannur and Kasaragod districts. The development for bypass route from Cherupuzha traverses through Prapoyil, Thirumeni, Chathamangalam, Parappa, Karthikapuram Road is still underway, but very significant because it connects Cherupuzha to places like Karthikapuram, Parappa, Neduvode and Rayarome at the shortest distance. This is the only road that goes through the common meeting place of Cherupuzha, Alakode and Udayagiri panchayaths. Efforts are on to renovate the road completely and make it the bypass of Alakode-Therthaly-Cherupuzha Road. The advantage is in case of any complication on the major road, the bypass can be used. =Hanging Bridge= The major attraction in Cherupuzha is a hanging bridge in Tejaswini river (also known as karyamkode puzha) which connects both Kasaragod and Kannur districts.

Mariano (born 1950) is American politician from Massachusetts. Mariano served as Mayor of Worcester, Massachusetts. Mariano is the former executive director of the Worcester Housing Authority. Early life and education Born in 1950, Raymond Mariano is the oldest of nine children, the son of an immigrant mother and a disabled veteran father. Mariano grew up in one of the state's largest public housing projects, Great Brook Valley. Mariano graduated with a BA from Worcester State College and holds an MPA from Clark University (1982). Ray has taught graduate and undergraduate courses at several New England colleges and universities. His teaching includes both government and management courses. Family Mariano is married to Antonia K. Mariano, a teacher in the Worcester Public Schools. The couple has three children. Political career =Early political career= In 1974, at the age of 24, Mariano became a candidate for the Worcester School Committee placing 7th. Mariano was elevated to fill a term of a retiring member on October 1, 1977. Mariano was re-elected to the School Committee in 1977 and again in 1979. In 1981, Mariano became the first member of the Worcester School Committee to ever win election to another office on his first try when he was elected to the Worcester City Council. In 1985, Mariano was elected, by his colleagues to serve as Vice Chairman of the City Council. =Mayor of Worcester= In 1993, Mariano was elected as Mayor of the City of Worcester, Massachusetts at the time the second largest city in New England. He was reelected in 1995, 1997 and 1999. In 1997, Mariano was elected by the largest proportion of any Mayor in Worcester's history. (He was elected with the second largest percentage in the city's history in 1995.) Mariano did not seek reelection in 2001. Mariano held the position of mayor longer than anyone else in the City's history under Plan E government, and is one of only two mayor's in the City's history to serve four consecutive terms. =Accomplishments as Mayor= As Mayor, Mariano has several accomplishments to his name. Mariano established a highly successful committee focusing on gang and youth violence and at-risk youth. Mariano personally led an effort in 2000 which created the largest summer jobs program in the City's history creating more than 2000 jobs for at-risk young people. Mariano also created \\"Operation Clean City\\", a citywide beautification program, which won an award for innovation from the Massachusetts Municipal Association. Included in this effort was the Mayor's College Clean-Up program which collected nearly 240 tons of illegal debris in 5 years and involved thousands of students from area colleges. Mariano also brought home the first federal grant for the rehabilitation of Union Station and led efforts to build a new convention center (now the Worcester DCU Center). Perhaps his most well-known endeavor, Mariano was mayor and led the City during the tragic fire that claimed the life of 6 local firefighters. Professional career In 1984 and continuing through 2003, Mariano worked as a marketing and management consultant with clients throughout the Northeast. Mariano also served as a political consultant to local, state, and national candidates across the country. Mariano has worked on the presidential campaigns of Henry \\"Scoop\\" Jackson George McGovern, Al Gore, and many others. =Executive Director of the Worcester Housing Authority= In 2003, Mariano became Executive Director of the Worcester Housing Authority. This agency serves 5,000 families in 24 separate communities and is home to approximately 15,000 people. Under his leadership the agency has reduced crime by 50-75%. The agency, under Mariano, has also dramatically improved the physical condition of all property and reduced maintenance response time by 75% and developed a 90+% satisfaction rate as measured by customer survey responses. Major Reforms at WHA In 2011, Mariano took steps to convert a number of properties to be entirely smoke-free. Later that same year, he instituted an innovative program to require public housing recipients under age 50 to either be working full-time or to be in school full-time, or face rent increases. He argued that public housing has become generational, rather than the short-term solution for families that it was intended to be. Mariano, a former resident of Worcester public housing himself, pitched the program as one that was designed to \\"make residents self-sufficient and to motivate them to move out of public housing.\\" The program is already seen as a \\"public housing revolution\\" that could be replicated across the country.

Protein mass spectrometry refers to the application of mass spectrometry to the study of proteins. Mass spectrometry is an important method for the accurate mass determination and characterization of proteins, and a variety of methods and instrumentations have been developed for its many uses. Its applications include the identification of proteins and their post-translational modifications, the elucidation of protein complexes, their subunits and functional interactions, as well as the global measurement of proteins in proteomics. It can also be used to localize proteins to the various organelles, and determine the interactions between different proteins as well as with membrane lipids. The two primary methods used for the ionization of protein in mass spectrometry are electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix- assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). These ionization techniques are used in conjunction with mass analyzers such as tandem mass spectrometry. In general, the protein are analyzed either in a \\"top-down\\" approach in which proteins are analyzed intact, or a \\"bottom-up\\" approach in which protein are first digested into fragments. An intermediate \\"middle-down\\" approach in which larger peptide fragments are analyzed may also sometimes be used. History The application of mass spectrometry to study proteins became popularized in the 1980s after the development of MALDI and ESI. These ionization techniques have played a significant role in the characterization of proteins. (MALDI) Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization was coined in the late 80's by Franz Hillenkamp and Michael Karas. Hillenkamp, Karas and their fellow researchers were able to ionize the amino acid alanine by mixing it with the amino acid tryptophan and irradiated with a pulse 266 nm laser. Though important, the breakthrough did not come until 1987. In 1987, Koichi Tanaka used the \\"ultra fine metal plus liquid matrix method\\" and ionized biomolecules the size of 34,472 Da protein carboxypeptidase-A. In 1968, Malcolm Dole reported the first use of electrospray ionization with mass spectrometry. Around the same time MALDI became popularized, John Bennett Fenn was cited for the development of electrospray ionization. Koichi Tanaka received the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry alongside John Fenn, and Kurt W√ºthrich \\"for the development of methods for identification and structure analyses of biological macromolecules.\\" These ionization methods have greatly facilitated the study of proteins by mass spectrometry. Consequently, protein mass spectrometry now plays a leading role in protein characterization. Methods and approaches =Techniques= Mass spectrometry of proteins requires that the proteins in solution or solid state be turned into an ionized form in the gas phase before they are injected and accelerated in an electric or magnetic field for analysis. The two primary methods for ionization of proteins are electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). In electrospray, the ions are created from proteins in solution, and it allows fragile molecules to be ionized intact, sometimes preserving non-covalent interactions. In MALDI, the proteins are embedded within a matrix normally in a solid form, and ions are created by pulses of laser light. Electrospray produces more multiply-charged ions than MALDI, allowing for measurement of high mass protein and better fragmentation for identification, while MALDI is fast and less likely to be affected by contaminants, buffers and additives. Whole-protein mass analysis is primarily conducted using either time-of-flight (TOF) MS, or Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR). These two types of instrument are preferable here because of their wide mass range, and in the case of FT-ICR, its high mass accuracy. Electrospray ionization of a protein often results in generation of multiple charged species of 800 < m/z < 2000 and the resultant spectrum can be deconvoluted to determine the protein's average mass to within 50 ppm or better using TOF or ion-trap instruments. Mass analysis of proteolytic peptides is a popular method of protein characterization, as cheaper instrument designs can be used for characterization. Additionally, sample preparation is easier once whole proteins have been digested into smaller peptide fragments. The most widely used instrument for peptide mass analysis are the MALDI-TOF instruments as they permit the acquisition of peptide mass fingerprints (PMFs) at high pace (1 PMF can be analyzed in approx. 10 sec). Multiple stage quadrupole-time-of- flight and the quadrupole ion trap also find use in this application. Chromatography trace and MS/MS spectra of a peptide. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is used to measure fragmentation spectra and identify proteins at high speed and accuracy. Collision-induced dissociation is used in mainstream applications to generate a set of fragments from a specific peptide ion. The fragmentation process primarily gives rise to cleavage products that break along peptide bonds. Because of this simplicity in fragmentation, it is possible to use the observed fragment masses to match with a database of predicted masses for one of many given peptide sequences. Tandem MS of whole protein ions has been investigated recently using electron capture dissociation and has demonstrated extensive sequence information in principle but is not in common practice. =Approaches= In keeping with the performance and mass range of available mass spectrometers, two approaches are used for characterizing proteins. In the first, intact proteins are ionized by either of the two techniques described above, and then introduced to a mass analyzer. This approach is referred to as \\"top-down\\" strategy of protein analysis as it involves starting with the whole mass and then pulling it apart. The top-down approach however is mostly limited to low-throughput single-protein studies due to issues involved in handling whole proteins, their heterogeneity and the complexity of their analyses. In the second approach, referred to as the \\"bottom-up\\" MS, proteins are enzymatically digested into smaller peptides using a protease such as trypsin. Subsequently, these peptides are introduced into the mass spectrometer and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting or tandem mass spectrometry. Hence, this approach uses identification at the peptide level to infer the existence of proteins pieced back together with de novo repeat detection. The smaller and more uniform fragments are easier to analyze than intact proteins and can be also determined with high accuracy, this \\"bottom-up\\" approach is therefore the preferred method of studies in proteomics. A further approach that is beginning to be useful is the intermediate \\"middle-down\\" approach in which proteolytic peptides larger than the typical tryptic peptides are analyzed. =Protein and peptide fractionation= Mass spectrometry protocol Proteins of interest are usually part of a complex mixture of multiple proteins and molecules, which co-exist in the biological medium. This presents two significant problems. First, the two ionization techniques used for large molecules only work well when the mixture contains roughly equal amounts of material, while in biological samples, different proteins tend to be present in widely differing amounts. If such a mixture is ionized using electrospray or MALDI, the more abundant species have a tendency to \\"drown\\" or suppress signals from less abundant ones. Second, mass spectrum from a complex mixture is very difficult to interpret due to the overwhelming number of mixture components. This is exacerbated by the fact that enzymatic digestion of a protein gives rise to a large number of peptide products. In light of these problems, the methods of one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography are widely used for separation of proteins. The first method fractionates whole proteins via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The first-dimension of 2D gel is isoelectric focusing (IEF). In this dimension, the protein is separated by its isoelectric point (pI) and the second-dimension is SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This dimension separates the protein according to its molecular weight. Once this step is completed in-gel digestion occurs. In some situations, it may be necessary to combine both of these techniques. Gel spots identified on a 2D Gel are usually attributable to one protein. If the identity of the protein is desired, usually the method of in-gel digestion is applied, where the protein spot of interest is excised, and digested proteolytically. The peptide masses resulting from the digestion can be determined by mass spectrometry using peptide mass fingerprinting. If this information does not allow unequivocal identification of the protein, its peptides can be subject to tandem mass spectrometry for de novo sequencing. Small changes in mass and charge can be detected with 2D-PAGE. The disadvantages with this technique are its small dynamic range compared to other methods, some proteins are still difficult to separate due to their acidity, basicity, hydrophobicity, and size (too large or too small). The second method, high performance liquid chromatography is used to fractionate peptides after enzymatic digestion. Characterization of protein mixtures using HPLC/MS is also called shotgun proteomics and MuDPIT (Multi-Dimensional Protein Identification Technology). A peptide mixture that results from digestion of a protein mixture is fractionated by one or two steps of liquid chromatography. The eluent from the chromatography stage can be either directly introduced to the mass spectrometer through electrospray ionization, or laid down on a series of small spots for later mass analysis using MALDI. Applications =Protein identification= There are two main ways MS is used to identify proteins. Peptide mass fingerprinting uses the masses of proteolytic peptides as input to a search of a database of predicted masses that would arise from digestion of a list of known proteins. If a protein sequence in the reference list gives rise to a significant number of predicted masses that match the experimental values, there is some evidence that this protein was present in the original sample. Purification steps therefore limit the throughput of the peptide mass fingerprinting approach. Peptide mass fingerprinting can be achieved with MS/MS. MS is also the preferred method for the identification of post-translational modifications in proteins as it is more advantageous than other approaches such as the antibody-based methods. =De novo (peptide) sequencing= De novo peptide sequencing for mass spectrometry is typically performed without prior knowledge of the amino acid sequence. It is the process of assigning amino acids from peptide fragment masses of a protein. De novo sequencing has proven successful for confirming and expanding upon results from database searches. As de novo sequencing is based on mass and some amino acids have identical masses (e.g. leucine and isoleucine), accurate manual sequencing can be difficult. Therefore, it may be necessary to utilize a sequence homology search application to work in tandem between a database search and de novo sequencing to address this inherent limitation. Database searching has the advantage of quickly identifying sequences, provided they have already been documented in a database. Other inherent limitations of database searching include sequence modifications/mutations (some database searches do not adequately account for alterations to the 'documented' sequence, thus can miss valuable information), the unknown (if a sequence is not documented, it will not be found), false positives, and incomplete and corrupted data. An annotated peptide spectral library can also be used as a reference for protein/peptide identification. It offers the unique strength of reduced search space and increased specificity. The limitations include spectra not included in the library will not be identified, spectra collected from different types of mass spectrometers can have quite distinct features, and reference spectra in the library may contain noise peaks, which may lead to false positive identifications. A number of different algorithmic approaches have been described to identify peptides and proteins from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), peptide de novo sequencing and sequence tag-based searching. =Protein quantitation= Quantitative Mass Spectrometry. Multiple methods allow for the quantitation of proteins by mass spectrometry (quantitative proteomics), and recent advances have enabled quantifying thousands of proteins in single cells. Typically, stable (e.g. non- radioactive) heavier isotopes of carbon (13C) or nitrogen (15N) are incorporated into one sample while the other one is labeled with corresponding light isotopes (e.g. 12C and 14N). The two samples are mixed before the analysis. Peptides derived from the different samples can be distinguished due to their mass difference. The ratio of their peak intensities corresponds to the relative abundance ratio of the peptides (and proteins). The most popular methods for isotope labeling are SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture), trypsin-catalyzed 18O labeling, ICAT (isotope coded affinity tagging), iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation). ‚ÄúSemi- quantitative‚Äù mass spectrometry can be performed without labeling of samples. Typically, this is done with MALDI analysis (in linear mode). The peak intensity, or the peak area, from individual molecules (typically proteins) is here correlated to the amount of protein in the sample. However, the individual signal depends on the primary structure of the protein, on the complexity of the sample, and on the settings of the instrument. Other types of \\"label-free\\" quantitative mass spectrometry, uses the spectral counts (or peptide counts) of digested proteins as a means for determining relative protein amounts. =Protein structure determination= Characteristics indicative of the 3-dimensional structure of proteins can be probed with mass spectrometry in various ways. By using chemical crosslinking to couple parts of the protein that are close in space, but far apart in sequence, information about the overall structure can be inferred. By following the exchange of amide protons with deuterium from the solvent, it is possible to probe the solvent accessibility of various parts of the protein. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry has been used to study proteins and their conformations for over 20 years. This type of protein structural analysis can be suitable for proteins that are challenging for other structural methods. Another interesting avenue in protein structural studies is laser-induced covalent labeling. In this technique, solvent-exposed sites of the protein are modified by hydroxyl radicals. Its combination with rapid mixing has been used in protein folding studies. =Proteogenomics= In what is now commonly referred to as proteogenomics, peptides identified with mass spectrometry are used for improving gene annotations (for example, gene start sites) and protein annotations. Parallel analysis of the genome and the proteome facilitates discovery of post-translational modifications and proteolytic events, especially when comparing multiple species.

It is located on the Mediterranean Sea at the mouth of the Damietta Nile branch. There are approximately 25,000 permanent residents in the city. However, during the summer peak holiday season, from July to September, the population quickly expands to over 250,000.  Geography  = Location = Ras El Bar lies in a peninsula on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and it is bordered on the western by the Damietta Nile branch. The area of \\"Lessan\\" is located in the extreme northern part of this peninsula, and it is at this point where the Damietta Nile arm flows in the Mediterranean sea, which gives Ras El Bar the shape of a triangle. = Climate = The climate of Ras El Bar is classified as hot desert (BWh) by K√∂ppen- Geiger system although tempered by the proximity to the Mediterranean Sea. = Geomorphology = While Ras El Bar is within the Nile Delta, its sandy soils are due to predominant coastal processes with much of the city lying on the foreshore dune structures. Older portions of the city are in the natural levee of the Damietta river. = Animals and Plants = * Many dolphins visit Ras El Bar shores * Many kinds of wild birds actually live in the Manzala lake * In the fall season, many of the immigrating flocks of European birds pass by Ras El Bar in their course to South Africa  Infrastructure  = Houses = The land renting system started back since 1898, then started building houses and villas that were named \\"e'sha\\" (hut). In 1902, the first civic plan for the town was implemented. The plan established that the streets would be straight block style to maintain the town's beauty. At the very beginning those huts were built of wood and other simple materials, had only one floor and hosted only one family. These were temporary structures built at the start of the summer and removed at its end. Eventually, newer permanent villas replaced these using cement and bricks. Now, single blocks may have twelve units with most of them with garages. They are still named \\"e'sha\\" (hut) among locals. = Roads = The main road in Ras El Bar is called \\"Port Said road\\". Most the streets are dirt roads and are numbered. The street numbers start from \\"El Moderiya Street\\". Streets north of it have even numbers while streets south of it have odd numbers. * Port Said Street: is the main access in Ras El-Bar and it connects its entrance to the beginning of \\"Lesan\\". * Nile Street: primary commercial street running parallel to the river. External: * Older roads that link Ras El-Bar with other governorates are available all year long. = Sports = * There are many kinds of sports like beach sports; swimming competitions which involve crossing the nile from Damietta to Ras El Bar. * Many clubs and gyms for sports like football, volleyball, handball, Kung Fu, karate, judo, etc. = Education = Ras El Bar as a summer resort has a small number of permanent residents, therefore there are few schools and universities.  Economy  Since early ages, Ras El Bar has been a main port for all kinds of goods that pass through the Nile and/or come from the sea. =Oil and gas exploration= There has been gas and oil exploration going on in Ras El Bar for a number of years. = Fishing = Ras El Bar is a huge centre for fishing boats that leave into the Mediterranean sea and return loaded with different kinds of fish that helped in enriching this industry all over the country. It is also a spot for manufacturing ships of all kinds and sizes, especially fishing ones.  History  = Pharaohs = Ras El Bar has been called many names since the Pharaos. Pharos called it the Mediterranean Sea (the great green sea), then came the Romans and called it \\"The Romans Sea\\" on 30 AD, and the spot where sea could meet a river was called (Be Tamosh) and it meant the place between two waves or two seas. The name itself Ras El Bar came from some sailors who felt that this place can be the shelter from the sea's dangers. \\"Ras\\" is the start and \\"El Bar\\" is the land so it is the start of land and the shelter of any sailor. This place was mentioned in the Quran for three times only to stress out the mighty power of god that made both river and sea meet with a separator that can never be seen and stops them from blending. = Greek and Roman eras = Damietta was known as \\"Tamiats\\" during the Greek and Roman eras, and it was known as \\"Tamiat\\" during the time of Veterans Copts. = Islamic era = According to the Historical Documents, \\"Tamiats\\" was an important Coptic Bishopric during the Fifth Century. The name \\"Demt\\", which means \\"the ability\\" in the Syriac Language, was also mentioned in a verse sent to the Prophet \\"Idris\\" or \\"Herms\\". The sense behind the name is the ability that combined the fresh water and the brine water together in that place. After the revealing of the Quran and before the Islamic conquest of Egypt, it was mentioned that Omar Ibn Al-Khattab recalled Prophet Muhammad's words as follows \\"Omar, you will open two ports in Egypt, Alexandria and Damietta. About Alexandria, it was destroyed by barbarians. About Damietta, its people are martyrs. This who does this for a night will be with me along with the other Prophets at Al Kuds\\". According to Anas ibn Malik, who was one of the Prophet Muhammad's companions, the Prophet Muhammad said \\"Muslims will open a port that is considered the \\"ability\\" place, in which the olds of my 'Ummah' will live; a one night in this place is better than a thousand months worship; it is the \\"ability\\" place for those who sacrifice their souls for God.\\" Then, Anas said \\"and what is that \\"ability\\" place, Prophet?\\" The Prophet Muhammad said \\"It is the place that is spelled with D, M, and T.\\" Damietta is called Caphtor by several ancient manuscripts including the Bible, Koran, Josephues, and Egyptian texts. The Torah may use the spelling \\"Kaftor\\". Being mentioned and described in the three Holy Heavenly religions is a great pride that Damietta has out of many beautiful places \\"Ras El Bar in Brief\\", Mubarak Public Library (Damietta branch) = Crusades = Damietta' position on the west bank of the Nile river is a strategic location that urged many enemies' fleets to conquer the city, and that also urged its people to build a number of fortifying castles and towers to protect the city. In 1218, The Crusaders started to approach Damietta, and they made a dike surrounded by a bailey to protect them, and they settled there where they initiated their assaults against the strong resistance from the Dumyaty people. The resistance stilled strong for four months, but the Crusaders condensed their attacks and they surrounded the whole city abandoning it and its people from any coming support. However, the Dumyaty people stand strong and kept resisting till the summer season came, and the flood filled the Nile river with water till the baileys were destroyed, and the dike became like an island surrounded with water. After that, the Crusaders were seeking a conciliating treaty to get out of the city and the whole country. After thirty years, the Crusaders came back to conquer Egypt as a starting point for invading Palestine and the other Arab countries. In 1248, the king of France at that time, Louis IX, sailed from southern France with a great fleet until he reached Damietta's beaches. At that time, the Prince Fakhr El Din left the city with no army and ran away. However, the Dumyaty people resisted that fleet. They burnt their shops and everything that the enemy could make use of, and they retreated to the jungles and the inner places in the city to inveigle the enemy. Then, they started their enchorial stood out and they beaten the French in a number of battles. The last battle was at Faraskour, which is a city on the Nile River, where Dumyaty people killed a number of ten thousand men from the French, and they captivated the others along with the king Louis IX, and they imprisoned him. Later on, King Louis IX paid four thousand Egyptian Pounds to be released along with his men, and he left the Damietta on May 8, 1250, and that date became the National Day of Damietta later on. The battle was known as Mansoura battle it took place at the recent mansoura city on the Nile river and the king of France at that time was imprisoned at Dar Ibn Lokman. = Modern era = Damietta started to create a new path towards peace and safe life after struggling against invaders. The new path is representing its natural rule that it was created for, which is tourism. Ras el-Bar is noted as the destination of the celebrated Druze Princess, songstress and film actress Asmahaan (real name, Amaal al-Atrash, q.v.), still revered by many as the greatest Arabic-music singer ever, when she was killed in a car crash in nearby Mansoura, Egypt in July 1944. The two-door car in which she was being chauffeured in the back seat with a female companion went out of control and crashed into a roadside canal there, drowning her and the companion, though the driver managed to escape, giving rise to multiple conspiracy theories as to the cause of the fatality, based on antagonism towards Asmahaan on the part of both the British and Germans during WWII, on the part of Egyptians, Druze and her own family members, including her ex-husband, because of her behavior that they saw as scandalous and dishonorable, and on the part of her great rival the singer Umm Kulthuwm out of jealousy, all which theories are mere speculation, as no evidence of any of them has ever been found. Recently, an alleyway by the side of the Nile River was made at the city of Ras El Bar. The other side of the alleyway contains a number of shops and restaurants till it reaches the area of \\"El Lesan\\". \\"El Lesan\\" is the place where the Mediterranean Sea meets the Nile River, and it was also developed to compete with worldwide tourist places.

The book was published in 1946; in the meanwhile, Bloch had been tortured and executed by the Gestapo in June 1944 for his participation in the French resistance. An English translation was published by W. W. Norton in 1968.  Background  The book focuses on the causes of the French defeat in the Battle of France in 1940, and in part uses a relatively long-term view similar to that in his history scholarship (see Annales school). The main thesis of the book is that the French leadership failed to recognize that, since World War I, > \\"the whole rhythm of modern warfare had changed its tempo.\\" There are only three chapters: Presentation of the Witness, being a short personal history of a life devoted to historical study and interrupted by World War I; One of the Vanquished Gives Evidence, a factual account of his experience in the battle of France; and A Frenchman Examines His Conscience, a biting analysis of the thinking and actions of the generation in the interwar period.  Contents  Bloch raised most of the issues historians have debated since. He blamed France's leadership: :What drove our armies to disaster was the cumulative effect of a great number of different mistakes. One glaring characteristic is, however, common to all of them. Our leaders...were incapable of thinking in terms of a new war.Marc Bloch, Strange Defeat: a Statement of Evidence Written in 1940 (Oxford U.P., 1949), p 36 Guilt was widespread. Carole Fink argues that Bloch :blamed the ruling class, the military and the politicians, the press and the teachers, for a flawed national policy and a weak defense against the Nazi menace, for betraying the real France and abandoning its children. Germany had won because its leaders had better understood the methods and psychology of modern combat.Carole Fink, \\"Marc Bloch and the dr√¥le de guerre Prelude to the '\\"Strange Defeat'\\" p 46 Bloch reports a harsh and forthright view of the cause of the defeat as he and fellow officers saw it at the time (p. 20 of the printed French edition, p. 45 of the manuscript, written between July and September 1940): > \\"[W]hatever the deep-seated cause of the disaster may have been, the > immediate occasion was the utter incompetence of the High Command.\\" Bloch is also critical of the Allies, specifically of the behaviour of British soldiers and of the High Command in the retreat in Belgium. In a subsequent revision, however, he added a footnote that broadened the blame to non-HQ officers (p. 68 of the printed French edition, p. 145 of the manuscript, footnote dated July 1942): > \\"failures in the troop command were substantially less rare than I had > wanted to believe in the aftermath of the defeat. ... Certainly a certain > morality crisis in class groups (among reserves as well as active officers) > was deeper than one dared imagine.\\" Chapter III then expounded on more general institutional and societal failures that hindered France's response.

Therefore, by the Tutte‚ÄìBerge formula, it has at most (1‚àí3+16)/2 7 edges in any matching. In the mathematical discipline of graph theory the Tutte‚ÄìBerge formula is a characterization of the size of a maximum matching in a graph. It is a generalization of Tutte's theorem on perfect matchings, and is named after W. T. Tutte (who proved Tutte's theorem) and Claude Berge (who proved its generalization). Statement The theorem states that the size of a maximum matching of a graph G=(V,E) equals :\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\min_{U\\\\subseteq V} \\\\left(U-\\\\operatorname{odd}(G-U)+V\\\\right), where \\\\operatorname{odd}(H) counts how many of the connected components of the graph H have an odd number of vertices. Explanation Intuitively, for any subset U of the vertices, the only way to completely cover an odd component of G ‚àí U by a matching is for one of the matched edges covering the component to be incident to U. If, instead, some odd component had no matched edge connecting it to U, then the part of the matching that covered the component would cover its vertices in pairs, but since the component has an odd number of vertices it would necessarily include at least one leftover and unmatched vertex. Therefore, if some choice of U has few vertices but its removal creates a large number of odd components, then there will be many unmatched vertices, implying that the matching itself will be small. This reasoning can be made precise by stating that the size of a maximum matching is at most equal to the value given by the Tutte‚ÄìBerge formula. The characterization of Tutte and Berge proves that this is the only obstacle to creating a large matching: the size of the optimal matching will be determined by the subset U with the biggest difference between its numbers of odd components outside U and vertices inside U. That is, there always exists a subset U such that deleting U creates the correct number of odd components needed to make the formula true. One way to find such a set U is to choose any maximum matching M, and to let X be the set of vertices that are either unmatched in M, or that can be reached from an unmatched vertex by an alternating path that ends with a matched edge. Then, let U be the set of vertices that are matched by M to vertices in X. No two vertices in X can be adjacent, for if they were then their alternating paths could be concatenated to give a path by which the matching could be increased, contradicting the maximality of M. Every neighbor of a vertex x in X must belong to U, for otherwise we could extend an alternating path to x by one more pair of edges, through the neighbor, causing the neighbor to become part of U. Therefore, in G ‚àí U, every vertex of X forms a single-vertex component, which is odd. There can be no other odd components, because all other vertices remain matched after deleting U. So with this construction the size of U and the number of odd components created by deleting U are what they need to be to make the formula be true. Relation to Tutte's theorem Tutte's theorem characterizes the graphs with perfect matchings as being the ones for which deleting any subset U of vertices creates at most U odd components. (A subset U that creates at least U odd components can always be found in the empty set.) In this case, by the Tutte‚ÄìBerge formula, the size of the matching is V/2; that is, the maximum matching is a perfect matching. Thus, Tutte's theorem can be derived as a corollary of the Tutte‚ÄìBerge formula, and the formula can be seen as a generalization of Tutte's theorem.

As well as the four steel spans, there is a stone arch at each end of the viaduct. The steel spans are long, and are at a skew of 70¬∞ The spans consist of twin truss girders sitting on the piers, and on top of the truss cross-girders supporting steel deck plates, with a ballasted track. The viaduct carries the line crossing the Forth Bridge, from Edinburgh to Aberdeen and the north of Scotland, and carries a significant volume of both passenger and freight rail traffic, which previously included transporting coal to Longannet Power Station prior to its closure in 2016. there were up to 200 train movements a day and loads of 27 million tonnes annually.

It comes from the Latin verb emo, emere, emi, emptum, to buy or purchase, plus the inseparable preposition pre, before. A right to acquire existing property in preference to any other person is usually referred to as a right of first refusal. Company shares In practice, the most common form of pre-emption right is the right of existing shareholders to acquire new shares issued by a company in a rights issue, usually a public offering. In this context, the pre-emptive right is also called subscription right or subscription privilege.Preemptive right definition on InvestorWords.com It is the right but not the obligation of existing shareholders to buy the new shares before they are offered to the public. In that way, existing shareholders can maintain their proportional ownership of the company and thus prevent stock dilution.Subscription rights explained on thismatter.com In many jurisdictions, subscription rights are automatically provided for by statute, such as in the United Kingdom, but in other jurisdictions, there arise only if provided for under the constitutional documents of the relevant company. In the United States, for example, it is rare for publicly-listed companies to grant pre-emptive rights to shareholders, but it is common for unlisted companies to grant pre-emptive rights to venture capital and private equity investors. The European Union has brought an infringement action against Spain based on the claim that the lack of statutory pre-emptive rights under Spanish law violates the Second Company Law Directive.K. Grechenig, Discriminating Shareholders through the Exclusion of Pre-emption Rights? - The European Infringement Proceeding against Spain (C-338/06), European Company and Financial Law Review (ECFR) 2007, p. 517-592. Other situations in which pre-emption rights are seen to arise are in property developments. Parties close to the investors are often given a right of pre- emption in relation to new flats or condominiums within a development. Overall, pre-emption right is similar to the concept of a call option. =British companies= The Companies Act 2006 is the source of shareholder pre-emption rights in British companies. Under Section 561(1) of the Companies Act 2006 a company must not issue shares to any person unless it has made an offer (on the same or on more favourable terms) to each person who already holds shares in the company in the proportion held by them, and the time limit given to the shareholder to accept the offer has expired. By virtue of Section 562(5), the period given to the shareholders to accept such an offer must not be less than 14 days. Those provisions' effect is that a company cannot allot shares to new shareholders until it has offered them to its existing shareholders. The company must give the shareholders at least 14 days to decide whether or not they wish to purchase the shares. Private companies and sometimes public companies can choose to disapply or modify the statutory pre- emption rights either generally or in respect of a specific allotment (Sections 569 to 573 of the Companies Act 2006). Historic meanings In earlier time, \\"pre-emption right\\" has had a separate and distinct meaning from that given to it today.www.lectlaw.com Under international law, the right of preemption formerly referred to the right of a nation to detain merchandise passing through its territories or seas to afford to its subjects the preference of purchase. That form of right was sometimes regulated by treaty.

The term is always used in conjunction with a facility reference. FAA ATC facilities include Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC); Terminal Radar Control facility (TRACON), Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT), Flight Service Stations (FSS), or the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC). The term is defined in FAA Order JO 1900.47, Air Traffic Control Operational Contingency Plans. It is one of three designations used by the FAA (ATC Alert, ATC Limited, and ATC Zero) to describe degraded operations and invoke operational contingency plans. ATC Zero is declared in response to an event when it is determined the controlling facility, or significant portion thereof, is unable to safely provide the published air traffic services, or provide traffic flow management in the case of the ATCSCC.as prescribed in FAA Orders JO 7110.65, JO 7210.3, and JO 7110.10. https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/orders_notices/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1028806 ATC services generally refer to specific communication, navigation, or surveillance capabilities. Any or all of the published services could be impacted by a natural or deliberate act that results in short or long term ATC service degradation. Examples of events that might result in degraded operations include technical system failures, errant construction, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, wild fires, earthquakes, pandemic, terrorism, or war. The term was used in a USA Today article quoting an official immediately after 9/11 atrocities supposedly referring to the blanket ban on aviation although the term is not as all embracing as that. Under ATC Zero conditions, normal flight operations are suspended. Residual capabilities will dictate what type flights can be continued. Instrument Flight Rule flights are not permitted as safe separation cannot be assured under ATC Zero. If weather conditions permit, Visual Flight Rules flights can be continued if they do not impact military or emergency response flights. The ATC Zero condition and any additional specific restrictions would be published by the FAA as a Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) for the airspace involved. The TFR would state what aircraft are permitted into the affected airspace (e.g., military, first responders, fire fighting, surveillance) and under what constraints and requirements those flights can operate. When an ATC Zero condition is declared, aircraft going to a destination inside the affected airspace may be required to divert to an alternate or re-route around the affected airspace. Aircraft already in the affected airspace would transition to VFR procedures, maintain their last clearance as able (trajectory, altitude, airspeed, heading), attempt to establish communication with other aircraft or ground assets to effect procedural self-separation, and then as able may decide to land or continue to an alternate outside the affected airspace.

Kilwarlin is a small village near Hillsborough in County Down. History John Cennick, who was a teacher at the Moravian School for the children of miners in Kingswood, worked alongside John Wesley in the evangelical revival in the Bristol area of England. He subsequently became a Minister of the Moravian Church. In 1746 he was sent to Dublin to preach in an evangelical campaign in Ireland. This work resulted in Moravian societies in counties Antrim, Down, Londonderry, Armagh, Tyrone, Cavan and Donegal. Cennick founded the Kilwarlin congregation in 1755 and built a church for it. In 1759, the congregation purchased some land for a burial ground. There was also a Manse for the Minister's residence. About eighty people attended the church. However, by 1834 the buildings were in ruins and only six members remained. Kilwarlin's renewal came with the arrival of a new Minister. This was a man called Basil Patras Zula. Zula, born in 1796, was a Greek chieftain who had fought in the War of Independence against the Turks. The Turkish commander put a price on Zula's head and this together with subsequent ambushes appears to have induced a nervous state of mind for the remainder of the latter's life. He spent some time hiding in Italy but in 1822 returned to Greece to take part in the siege of Missolonghi. The slaughter revolting him, he went to Smyrna where he met an Englishman, Sir William Eden. Eden returned to England in 1828 taking Zula with him and from there the two men went to Ireland. In Dublin, Zula met a Moravian school teacher called Ann Linfoot who knew Greek and was able to converse with him. Linfoot invited Zula to attend services at the Bishop Street Moravian Church in Dublin. Joining the congregation, Zula eventually offered himself for service as a Minister of the Moravian Church and was accepted. In 1829 he married Ann Linfoot and in 1834 the couple accepted a call to serve the Kilwarlin congregation. Zula's groundworks at Kilwarlin after Thermopylae A new church was built and opened for worship in March 1835. Twenty six new members joined the congregation on the same day. The congregation continued to expand and in January 1837 Zula was ordained by Rt Rev Hans Peter Hallbeck, a Moravian Bishop from South Africa. When rebuilding Kilwarlin Manse, Zula incorporated 'a number of escape mechanisms - two doors in all the downstairs rooms, two separate staircases and outside at the back a small room built on stilts with a trap-door leading to a hiding place under the floor'.Foy (undated), final page Zula never had to put these devices to use and in fact died naturally in Dublin on 4 October 1844. His body was brought back to Kilwarlin for burial. His widow Ann continued to live in the Manse and ran a boarding school for 'Select Young Ladies' until her own death in 1858. A curious feature of Kilwarlin Moravian Church is that Zula, at his own expense, had the grounds landscaped to represent the terrain of the ancient Battle of Thermopylae in which the Spartan army saved Athens from attack by the Persians. Most of the landscaping still remains. Notes and references Bibliography *Foy, Bishop J H, BA BD, (undated) \\"Kilwarlin Moravian Church: A Visitor's Guide\\" *Hutton, J. E.

College career He was drafted in June 1986 out of Florida State University and made the jump from college to the big leagues in less than two months. At Florida State he had tied an NCAA record by winning 20 games during the '86 season and was largely responsible for their trip to the College World Series. He was the 1986 Golden Spikes Award winner as the best college baseball player in the nation. After an initial flurry of success in the Majors his career flamed out and he was demoted to the minor leagues. He had a career total of 3 wins, 7 losses, an ERA of 5.82 with 81 strikeouts in 111 innings pitched. Professional career Loynd, age 22, made his debut on Thursday, July 24, 1986. Like the much heralded David Clyde in 1973, Loynd was expected to contribute immediately upon being called to the Majors. The Rangers were involved in a close pennant race and manager Bobby Valentine was strapped for pitching. Loynd won his first start in front of 34,256 fans with a 6-3 win over future Hall of Famer Phil Niekro and the Cleveland Indians. Loynd hurled 6 innings, allowed 3 runs, walked 3, and struck out 6. After his next three starts resulted in no decisions, Loynd was back in the win column again on Thursday, August 14, 1986 after defeating Teddy Higuera and the Milwaukee Brewers 8 to 2. Loynd surrendered only one run over 7 strong innings while giving up only 5 hits and one walk. He struck out 4. The victory improved his record to 2-0 and moved the Rangers just 1.5 games behind the first place California Angels. After moving his record to 2-0, Loynd would begin to struggle. Many experts felt it was due to his not having pitched as many innings before during a season. Rangers' manager Bobby Valentine began to use him more selectively, but yet he struggled greatly and for the year ended with 2 wins, 2 losses, and an ERA of 5.36. In 1987 he began the year in the bullpen and had some initial success in the first month. The Rangers however had been a team predicted by many pundits to contend for their first title. Instead, the club started the year 1-10 and never recovered. Perhaps the most iconic moment of that frustration involved Loynd in front of the home town crowd at Arlington Stadium. On Saturday, May 9, 1987 Loynd was brought in relief of Edwin Correa against the Toronto Blue Jays. After Tony Fern√°ndez connected off him for a home run that pushed the score to 7-0, Loynd vented his anger by hitting the next batter, Lloyd Moseby, with a pitch. Moseby proceeded to charge the mound while Loynd ran away. Both were ejected from the game and Toronto ended up winning 15 to 4. For the year, Loynd wrapped up 1987 with 1 win, 5 losses, and a horrid ERA of 6.10. It was his last time in the Major Leagues. Ultimately the Rangers traded Loynd to the Houston Astros for catcher Robbie Wine during Spring Training of 1988. Loynd spent the next seven seasons in the minor league organizations of the Astros, Toronto Blue Jays, St. Louis Cardinals and Atlanta Braves before ending his career with the West Palm Beach Expos of the Florida State League in 1994. Loynd is living in St. Louis, Missouri with wife Lori.

Zip fuels offer higher energy density than conventional fuels, helping extend the range of jet aircraft. In the 1950s, when the short range of jet aircraft was a major problem for military planners, zip fuels were a topic of significant study. A number of aircraft were designed to make use of zip, including the XB-70 Valkyrie, XF-108 Rapier, as well as the BOMARC, and even the nuclear-powered aircraft program. The Navy considered converting all of their jet engines to Zip and began studies of converting their aircraft carriers to safely store it. In testing, the fuels proved to have several serious problems and the entire effort was eventually cancelled in 1959. Description The highest energy density fuel seen in common propellant combinations is hydrogen. However, gaseous hydrogen has very low density; liquified hydrogen has higher density but is complex and expensive to store. When combined with other elements, like carbon, the hydrogen can be rendered into the easily burnable hydrocarbon fuels. Other elements, like aluminum and beryllium have even higher energy content than carbon, but do not mix well to form a stable fuel that can be easily burned.Cracknell pg. 332 Of all the low- mass elements, boron has the combination of high energy, low weight and wide availability that makes it interesting as a potential fuel. Boranes have a high specific energy, about 70,000 kJ/kg (30,000 BTU/lb). This compares favorably to a typical kerosene-based fuel, such as JP-4 or RP-1, which provides about 42,000 kJ/kg (18,000 BTU/lb).Hawthorne They are not suitable for burning as a fuel on their own, however, as they are often prone to self- ignition in contact with air, making them dangerous to handle.Griswold, pg. 88 When mixed with conventional jet fuels, they add to the energy content while becoming somewhat more stable. In general terms, boron-enhanced fuels offer up to 140% the energy density of plain JP-4 in terms of both weight and volume.Airfields In the US a whole family of fuels were investigated, and generally referred to by the names they were assigned during the Air Force's Project HEF: HEF-1 (ethyldiborane), HEF-2 (propylpentaborane), HEF-3 (ethyldecaborane), HEF-4 (methyldecaborane), and HEF-5 (ethylacetylenedecaborane). All zip fuels have a number of disadvantages. For one, the fuel is toxic, as is its exhaust. This was of little concern in flight, but a major concern for ground crews servicing the aircraft. The fuels burn to create solids that are both sticky and corrosive, while boron carbide solids are abrasive. This caused serious problems for turbine blades in jet engines, where the exhaust built up on the blades and reduced their effectiveness and sometimes caused catastrophic failure of the engine.Griswold, pg. 89Clark, pg. 123 Finally, the exhaust plume is filled with particulates, like coal smoke, allowing an aircraft to be spotted visually at long range. In the end, the problem of burning HEF throughout the entire engine proved impossible to solve. Removing the buildup was difficult, and the wear it caused was something that materials science was unable to address. It was possible to burn it with relative ease in an afterburner, but this would only be effective on aircraft that used an afterburner for extended periods of time. Combined with the high cost of producing the fuel and the toxicity issues, the value of zip fuel was seriously eroded. After interest as a jet fuel waned, some small-scale work as a rocket fuel continued. This too proved to be a dead-end, as the solid boron oxides in the combustion products interfered with the expected thermodynamics, and the thrust advantages could not be realized.  History  Several studies were made into boronated fuels over the years, starting with the U.S. Army's rocket-related Project HERMES in the late 1940s, the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics's Project ZIP in 1952, and the U.S. Air Force's Project HEF (High Energy Fuels) in 1955.Schubert For much of the 1950s, zip fuels were considered to be the \\"next big thing\\" and considerable funds were expended on these projects in an effort to bring them into service. The Navy's name stuck, and all of the boronated fuels became known as \\"zip fuels\\", although the Air Force's naming for the fuels themselves became common. The main thrust of the Air Force's program was based on HEF-3, which seemed to be the most likely candidate for quick introduction. HEF became part of the WS-110 efforts to build a new long-range bomber to replace the B-52 Stratofortress with a design able to dash at speeds up to Mach 2. The initial designs from Boeing and North American Aviation (NAA) both used conventional fuels for takeoff and cruise, switching to HEF during the high- speed dash, burning it only in their afterburner sections.Cracknell pg. 334 This avoided the main problems with HEF; by burning it only in the afterburners the problem with buildup on the turbine was eliminated, and since the afterburners were only used for takeoff and high-speed flight, the problems with the toxic exhaust were greatly reduced. When the initial designs proved to be too expensive to justify their relatively small performance improvement, both returned to the drawing board and came up with new designs that flew at supersonic speeds for most of a combat mission. These designs were based around new engines designed for sustained high-speed flight, with the NAA B-70 Valkyrie and General Electric J93 progressing to the prototype stage. In these cases the afterburners were used for a longer period, maximizing the benefits of HEF. There were plans to introduce a later version of the J93 that would burn HEF-4 throughout. Meanwhile, there were also studies on using HEF-3 in the BOMARC ramjets,Griswold, pg. 87 as well as studies about carrying it on the U.S. Navy's aircraft carrier fleet to power future aircraft, but these programs both died out. As the problems were proving intractable, the Air Force canceled their program in 1959, and interest in zip essentially disappeared. By this point the only design still considering using HEF was the XB-70 and its J93. NAA and General Electric responded by redesigning the engine to run on a new higher-density form of jet fuel, JP-6, and filling one of the two bomb bays with a new fuel tank. In doing so the range was dramatically reduced from about to . This reduced the selection of targets that could be attacked from the US and required in-flight refueling for every mission profile, one more problem that led to the project's eventual re-direction as a purely experimental aircraft. It is estimated that the US spent about $1 billion on the program, in 2001 inflation-adjusted dollars. At least five HEF production plants were built in the US, and two workers were killed in an explosion that destroyed one plant in New York.Dequasie, pp. 73-76 Most of the program was classified Top Secret while being carried out, but nevertheless it was widely covered both in the trade press and civilian newspapers.\\"Boron Bomber, RAF Flying Review, September 1958 Both the US and Soviet Union independently declassified their research in 1964. One potentially lasting relic of the HEF program is an abandoned dirt airfield outside Boron, California. Marked on USGS topographical maps as \\"Air Force Plant #72\\", nothing but the airstrip and a water tank were ever built on the site. It is speculated that this would have been a factory for HEF fuel, using the large borax deposits nearby (giving the town its name), where it could be easily shipped to Edwards Air Force Base.

In his mid-twenties he travelled to Zanzibar, Mozambique, and South Africa for business purposes, but showed himself a keen ethnographer as well. In 1896, he was first appointed consul and later consul general for the Orange Free State. Muller held this position all through the Second Boer War and his high-profile performance as European representative for this Boer republic won him considerable notoriety. After the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed in 1902, Muller retired to a life of travelling and writing for some years, making Muller a household name with his travel books. In 1919, the Dutch government appointed him envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Romania, and later to Czechoslovakia. Muller was a prolific writer. Over the course of his life he published well over two hundred articles, brochures, and books about his travels, South Africa and the Boers, and Dutch foreign policy. Muller gathered a large fortune with well appointed private investments. He bequeathed his considerable wealth to a private fund in support of academic research and cultural heritage. Biography =Early life as businessman= Muller in East Africa Hendrik Pieter Nicolaas Muller was born in Rotterdam on 2 April 1859, as the third child and second son of Hendrik Muller Szn. and Marie Cornelie van Rijckevorsel. His father was a successful businessman based in Rotterdam and trading with Africa and the Netherlands East Indies. H.P.N. Muller's maternal grandfather, , was the doyen of the Rotterdam merchant community in the early part of the nineteenth century. Both his father and maternal grandfather were politicians as well, liberals who staunchly defended the principle of free trade, and both were at one time members of the Senate of the States-General of the Netherlands. Muller's paternal grandfather was a German immigrant to the Netherlands and a Mennonite minister and professor of theology in Amsterdam. The Muller family was fairly prominent in the Netherlands in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, with Christian ministers, professors of literature and history, archivists, antiquarian booksellers, statesmen and businessmen in their midst. Muller was destined to step into his father's footsteps and become a businessman. He first attended the private institution Delfos followed by the Hogere Burgerschool (high school) in Rotterdam, before continuing his education in Germany, at the Hohe Real Schule in Frankfurt-am- Main, to specialise in trade and business. After finishing his studies with good results, he continued his training with internships in business firms in Liverpool, Manchester, and Marseilles. His first serious job came when his father called him back to Rotterdam in 1882, to become interim manager of the Handels Compagnie Mozambique (Trading Company Mozambique), an ill-performing trading firm doing business in Mozambique. In 1882, Muller travelled to East Africa and visited all the trading posts and establishments of the firm, changing business practices. At the end of his trip he made an extensive tour of South Africa, visiting Natal, Zululand, Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and the Cape Colony. On his return to Rotterdam he advised the directors of the company on business opportunities. Subsequently he was appointed co- director of the reconstituted company, now called the Oost-Afrikaansche Compagnie (East African Company), as well as deputy manager in his father's firm, Hendrik Muller & Co., which had important trading interests in Liberia and elsewhere in West Africa. In the 1880s Muller was active for his businesses, and travelled to the Congo Conference in Berlin in 1884, to Portugal in 1886 and North Africa in 1889. In the same year he succeeded his father as consul general for Liberia in the Netherlands, a position he would hold until 1913. After a third business journey to Africa in 1890, now to Liberia and the Gold Coast, for Hendrik Muller & Co., he returned home seriously ill, and had to convalesce for months. In this period he fell out with his father and younger brother Abram Muller, about both personal and business matters. It was a personal break that would never be healed and with professional repercussions. In 1891, Muller left business for good and embarked on a totally new career. =Ethnographer and geographer= Already in the 1880s, Muller had dabbled in ethnography and writing. On the basis of materials gathered on his journey to East Africa and South Africa in 1882/‚Äô83, he had held public lectures throughout the Netherlands and Belgium. He also published articles on his trip in Dutch magazines and newspapers, and collated these publications into a book titled Zuid-Afrika. It made him somewhat of a celebrity, and an expert on South Africa and East Africa. During his journey Muller had also collected a large number of ethnographic objects and artefacts, on which he published a richly illustrated study in 1892, together with Johannes Fran√ßois Snelleman, curator of the Africa collection in the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden. Once freed from running the better part of two businesses, and financially independent, Muller went to Germany to study geography and ethnography. He attended lectures at the universities of Heidelberg and Leipzig before completing his doctorate at the University of Giessen in 1894, summa cum laude. His thesis Land und Leute zwischen Zambezi und Limpopo (Land and People between Zambezi and Limpopo) was mainly based on secondary material, rather than the materials collected and observations made by Muller himself during his time in East Africa. This limited the originality of the study, although in its time it was appreciated as an important piece of academic work, and was also published in a commercial version. =Consul general for the Orange Free State= Delegation of the Boer Republics to Europe and America, 1900 After his return to the Netherlands, H.P.N. Muller settled down in The Hague, where he was originally only occupied with his consular duties for Liberia, his membership of the Commission for Consular Examinations (since 1890) and his writing. Early in 1896 Muller was appointed as consul for the Orange Free State in the provinces of North and South Holland, assisting the consul general Hendrik Antonie Lodewijk Hamelberg. He received the appointment on the strength of his publications about South Africa. After Hamelberg's death later in 1896 Muller succeeded him as consul general. It was an honorary position. In the following years Muller wholeheartedly set out to work for the Orange Free State and its interests in Europe. His predecessor Hamelberg had not only been consul general, but had on occasion also acted as special envoy to be able to negotiate treaties and accords with foreign powers. Muller also acted as special envoy and in this capacity inter alia enrolled the Orange Free State in the Universal Postal Union, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, and the Geneva Conventions, and negotiated treaties of friendship and trade with Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. He also strengthened the consular representation of the Orange Free State in Europe and inquired into all kinds of practical issues like a cure for rinderpest and improved methods of irrigation. In 1898 Muller travelled to South Africa, where he visited Cape Town, the Orange Free State, and the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek. In Pretoria he attended the inauguration of President Paul Kruger, and in Bloemfontein, he struck up a friendship with the newly elected President Marthinus Theunis Steyn and his family. He also renewed his relations with other leading statesmen, like former President Francis William Reitz, government secretary Pieter Jeremias Blignaut, and chairman of the Volksraad, Cornelius Hermanus Wessels. In Cape Town, he was granted an audience with High Commissioner Sir Alfred Milner. Muller as consul general of the Orange Free State Once back in the Netherlands, the political situation in South Africa became tense very rapidly, and Muller did all he could to propagate the cause of the Boer Republics in the press and via diplomatic channels. Once the South African War broke out in October 1899, Muller set up an elaborate operation to support the cause of the war for the Orange Free State. He mobilised public support in the Netherlands, Germany and the United States of America and had public gatherings organised. Through his many contacts with the European press Muller saw to it that the Boer cause was extensively covered in the newspapers, usually in his own words, but published in the name of the respective editor. His office in The Hague was the hub of diplomatic and consular activity in this period, with several secretaries working continuously on the gathering of information and dealing with correspondence. In the war effort Muller cooperated with the Algemeen Nederlandsch Verbond in Dordrecht, the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging in Amsterdam, and of course the Transvaal's diplomatic representative in Brussels, Willem Johannes Leyds. Originally the relationship between Muller and Leyds was cordial, but with time it soured and turned into open animosity. Both men were strong personalities with strong convictions. The fact that Muller was only consul general and Leyds an accredited diplomat was not helpful either and neither was the fact that ‚Äì at least in Muller's opinion ‚Äì the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek received much more attention than the Orange Free State. The first time problems arose in the open was in 1900, when the Boer republics sent a joint Special Diplomatic Delegation to Europe and the United States, which was ill-prepared and for which Leyds had very different ideas than Muller. In 1901, Muller travelled to the United States himself to mobilise support from President Theodore Roosevelt, especially on behalf of the women and children in the British concentration camps. He also held public lectures all around the country. While visiting Mexico, news reached Muller about the Peace of Vereeniging, making him jobless. Muller took the opportunity to turn his American journey into an expedition. On his return to the Netherlands in 1903 he published a book about it. In the years after the end of the South African War Muller maintained his interest in South Africa and the Afrikaners, both personally and professionally. In 1904 he supported the Steyn family when they were in Europe for the President's recovery of a debilitating illness. Until his death Muller was active for the Algemeen Nederlandsch Verbond and the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging. =Travel through Asia= Muller in the Dutch East Indies, 1907 Between 1907 and 1909 Muller travelled through Asia, a journey that produced several books and articles after his return, including a two-part report of his travels (Azi√´ gespiegeld; Asia mirrored).A translation of selected chapters from part I was published by Carool Kersten as Dr. Muller's Asian Journey. Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Yunnan (1907‚Äì1909) (Bangkok: White Lotus 2004).Spies, 'n Nederlander, 252‚Äì262. Muller also published a scientific source publication on Cambodia and the earliest Dutch presence in French Indochina. The French government rewarded him for it with a knighthood in the L√©gion d'Honneur for the latter. The French colony Annam made Muller a knight in the Order of the Dragon for his contributions to the history of Vietnam. Muller's Asian trip was comprehensive. He visited British India and Ceylon, Burma, Malaysia and the Philippines and French Indochina, travelled extensively through the Dutch East Indies, and returned via Japan, Korea ‚Äì where he had an audience with the last Korean emperorMuller, Azi√´ gespiegeld, part I, 369‚Äì371. ‚Äì, Manchuria, China, and Siberia.On the Philippines, Siam, French Indo China, Korea, Manchuria, and Siberia: Muller, Azi√´ gespiegeld, part I.On China: Muller, Azi√´ gespiegeld, part II, 174‚Äì286. Muller's visit to Japan triggered a lively interest in this country and its economic development potential. Back in the Netherlands he presented his views on the country in several speeches, brochures, and articles, mainly under the auspices of the Comit√© Nederland‚ÄìJapan (Dutch‚ÄìJapanese Committee).Muller, Zij en wij. =Dutch government official and diplomat= In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Muller's career took a new turn. The Dutch government appointed him government commissioner in charge of one of the main Belgian Refugee Camps in the Netherlands. Muller was charged with the transfer of the camp from a makeshift army encampment in Oldebroek to a proper refugee camp with full provisions in Nunspeet. He took to the job with great enthusiasm, but resigned a year later, declaring that he had attained the goals he had set himself on his appointment. Actually the resignation came in a cloud of controversy around his person and policies. At the end of World War I the Dutch prime minister did acknowledge the high quality of Muller's work in setting up the camps and bringing and maintaining order and human dignity under very trying circumstances. Apart from his position as member of the Consular Examinations Commission, this position was the only Dutch government appointment Muller held inside the Netherlands. From the 1890s onwards, Muller had published with great regularity about the importance of a proper Dutch consular service to promote the Dutch mercantile interests around the world. In his articles he forcefully advanced the idea that the consular and diplomatic services should be merged and professionalised. In his publications Muller also strongly propagated a more active role of the Netherlands in international affairs. In this vain, in 1919, he published an article on the history and geography of Spitsbergen and the necessity for the Dutch government to defend its historic claims on the islands. A year later, the Dutch government became a signatory to the Spitsbergen Treaty. Muller, Hendrik, ‚ÄòNederland's historische rechten op Spitsbergen‚Äô, Tijdschrift van het Koninklijk Nederlandsch Aardrijkskundig Genootschap 2e serie, deel 34 (1919) no. 1, 94‚Äì104; Spitsbergen Treaty (full text in Wikisource). In 1919, now already sixty years old, he got the chance to put his opinions on Dutch foreign policy into practice. In that year the Dutch government appointed him Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Romania, a country in the throes of political and economic transformation. The Dutch had had important business interests in the country, especially in petroleum. Muller stayed here until early 1924 when he was appointed envoy to Czechoslovakia. In Prague he was also involved in Dutch business affairs, inter alia looking after the interests of the Dutch electrotechnical firm Philips. He resigned his post in 1932 after being requested to step back by the Dutch minister of Foreign Affairs, who wished to free some senior diplomatic posts for younger diplomats waiting to be appointed envoy. Muller decided not take his pension, allowing him to keep his title of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary until his death. =Dutch history and heritage= From an early age Muller was interested in Dutch history, especially in the great national achievements of the Dutch during the centuries. During his lifetime Muller translated his interests in several concrete projects. In line with his historical interests he initiated the erection of a statue for the murdered Grand Pensionary of Holland, Johan de Witt (1625‚Äì1672). The statue was designed and made by the Dutch sculptor Frederik Engel Jeltsema. The unveiling in The Hague on 12 June 1918 was a national event. The actual unveiling was done by Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, with several ministers in attendance. The statue stands close to the place where De Witt and his brother Cornelis were killed by a mob in 1672. On the side of the socle a text is engraved which ‚Äì in translation ‚Äì reads: 'Leader and servant of the Republic, designer of it most powerful fleets, defender of the freedom of the seas, caretaker of the State's coffers, mathematician. He was a perfect Dutchman.'website Vrienden van De Witt (Dutch) Muller had an important hand in the formulation of the text. Muller funded the erection of a plaque in honour of the Dutch 17th-century Admiral Maarten Harpertsz. Tromp in the newly built City Hall of his birthplace Rotterdam. =Retirement= Tombstone at Oud Eik en Duinen In the years after 1932 Muller travelled a little around Europe and retired to his house in The Hague. He remained involved in cultural and academic activities, organised his papers, and kept a keen interest in South African affairs. In the last years of his life he was honoured in several ways, among others with an honorary doctorate in law from the University of South Africa, a bust in the hall of the Eeufeesgebou of the University of the Free State, with a copy in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde (National Museum of Ethnology) in Leiden, and an honorary diner party by the Royal Geographical Society in London. Without children and never fully reconciled with his family, Muller left almost his complete estate to the Hendrik Muller's Vaderlandsch Fonds for the support of academic research and cultural heritage. Finally his health failed more and more and H.P.N. Muller died in his house in The Hague on 11 August 1941. He was buried in the cemetery of Oud Eik en Duinen in The Hague in a grand ceremony, with the Dutch flag covering the coffin and the national anthem being played, in defiance of the German Nazi occupation and as a ‚Äì somewhat old-fashioned ‚Äì celebration of Dutch cultural identity. Among the attendants were several former government ministers and high-ranking military officers, university professors, former diplomats, representatives of cultural and scientific organisations, and friends from his South African period and after. During his lifetime H.P.N. Muller was well respected for his work. He was extensively decorated by almost all the countries he worked for or in, in many cases with the highest distinction. He was made a Knight Grand Cross in military and civilian orders of Portugal, Liberia, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands, was commander of the French Legion of Honour, and knight in orders of Liberia, Annam and the Netherlands. Apart from having his bust placed in the University of the Free State, the Bloemfontein municipal authorities named a street after him. Although highly decorated, honoured and well respected for his work, Muller was not an easy person. This shows through in a consistently bad press he received during his lifetime and after, which highlights his eccentricities and his at times volatile character.

Concise bibliography During his life, H.P.N. Muller published well over 200 books, articles, columns, and papers. Many of these ‚Äì especially his newspaper articles ‚Äì were published anonymously. Many of the (propaganda) articles he wrote about the South African War when he was consul general for the Orange Free State were published secretly, often under another journalist's or newspaper editor's name, to maximise the public relations effect. * Muller, Hendrik P.N., Zuid- Afrika.

She is facing charges of attempted murder of her daughter Alisa, then two years and seven months old, based solely on an 11-year-old boy's eyewitness account. Antonina is being prosecuted under Articles 30.3 (\\"Preparations for a Crime, and Attempted Crimes\\") and 105.2 (\\"Murder\\") of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (CC-RF henceforth; these links and other Code(s) links below are for the English translation(s) of the latest versions of the Code(s), those currently in force in Russia). The case has been the subject of broad-ranging public debate in Russian media, online communities and blogs. The discussion began in April 2007 with a post in the (Russian-language) blog of Antonina's husband (her domestic partner at the time), Mr. Kirill Martynov', aka LiveJournal user '.  Background  The term \\"Novgorod Case\\" was first used by the Russian news agency REGNUM on April 20, 2007. The main events of the case are taking place in the City of Veliky Novgorod, Russia. There are three people in Antonina's family. Her husband, Kirill Martynov, is a journalist and a lecturer in Philosophy at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. Antonina, 22 and temporarily unemployed, is taking care of her daughter, Alisa, born in 2004 to Antonina's first marriage. Until mid-August 2007, the investigation was conducted by the Major Case Investigator Mr. Vladimir Vladimirovich Kolodkin, of Veliky Novgorod (MCI or MCI Kolodkin henceforth).  Timeline  =2007= Amateur incident re- creation at place of Alisa's fall. This shot is taken from a claimed position of the witness. On February 26, Alisa fell two floors down a stairwell in the building in Veliky Novgorod where her grandmother lives. An 11-year-old boy, a friend of a neighbor's son, witnessed the fall. The boy allegedly stood on the landing one floor above; he reported to the neighbors that he had seen \\"an older girl push a younger one down\\". Antonina claims it was an accident. See versions of the events as seen by the prosecution and the defence below. The mother and daughter were rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. A medical examination revealed that Alisa sustained a concussion and some damage to her jaw, lost four teeth, and had minor bruises. During the examination, the police - promptly called by the neighbours - had Antonina make a written testimony of the events. On March 16, Antonina was visited by a police officer who brought her official summons to testify as a witness in an inquiry into Alisa's fall. According to Kirill, the officer also said that Antonina's actions constitute a corpus delicti under Article 105 of CC-RF (\\"Murder\\")http://newleft.info/readarticle.php?article_id=125 On March 18, Antonina's defence was taken up by Mr. Konstantin Pakin.http://www.grani.ru/Society/Law/m.120992.html A former criminal investigator, Pakin is known for his defence of one Yevgeny Mikhailov charged with the murder of Mr. Dmitry Balashov, a once-famous Russian writer. According to Kirill, Pakin only agreed to take the case on strict non- disclosure terms and intimated he would drop it immediately if it were to attract too much public attention. On March 19, the MCI Kolodkin took testimony of Antonina and Kirill. On March 20, on Pakin's advice, Antonina underwent an independent polygraph (\\"lie detector\\") test. On March 22, the MCI officially opened a criminal investigation under Articles 30.3 (\\"Intentional actions (inaction) by the person concerned, directed expressly towards the commission of a crime\\") and 105.1 (\\"Murder\\") of CC-RF On March 23, a member of the Public Chamber of Russian Federation, Mr. Aleksey Chadayev, filed an official request with the Office of the Novgorod City Public Prosecutor, for attention of Novgorod City Prosecutor Mr. Andrey Yefimov. In the request, Chadayev demanded that all those case materials not covered by official investigation secrecy be delivered to the Public Chamber Committee on Relations with Regions and Police Authorities. On March 26, the President of Union of Writers of Russia, Mr. Valery Ganichev, wrote a letter to the Governor of Novgorod Region, Mr. Mikhail Prusak. The letter stated that Antonina and Kirill have a healthy relationship and asked the governor to pay special attention to the case. Ganichev subsequently received a reply from the Novgorod City Hall that his letter had been forwarded to the Office of the Novgorod City Public Prosecutor. On March 27, the MCI filed a request with the Novgorod Office of Children's Services demanding that \\"the child be taken away with immediate effect under Article 77 of the Family Code of Russia\\", attaching a copy of case-opening decision to the said request. According to Kirill Martynov, he then called the Office of Children's Services personally and said the following: \\"Fyodorova has confessed to the attempted murder of her daughter. Take the child away\\". The same day, Pakin dropped the case because the involvement of the Public Chamber made it public.http://grani.ru/Society/Kids/m.120992.html According to an anonymous source in the Office of the Novgorod City Public Prosecutor quoted by A. Letyagin, a journalist, ‚Äúthat same day the girl was taken from her mother by the Office of Children's Services and delivered to her other relatives‚Äù. Kirill Martynov denied that the said event ever took place. On March 30, the Office of Children's Services received the MCI's request and attempted to take Alisa away without having procured either a court decision or a decision by the city authorities. On April 6, Antonina received an official summons to appear at the Office of the Novgorod City Public Prosecutor on April 9. The same day, Mr. Vladimir Baydyuk, another investigator turned lawyer, dropped the case, declaring that Antonina's guilt is, as he sees it, evident beyond a reasonable doubt. Kirill and Antonina then found a new lawyer who agreed to take on the case. On April 9, Antonina appeared at the Office of the Novgorod City Public Prosecutor to testify . According to Kirill Martynov, the interrogators \\"threatened\\" her with changing of CC-RF article under which she was to be prosecuted from the original Article 105.1 to Article 105.2, calling the latter ‚Äúa death penalty article‚Äù. On April 13, Antonina signed a written agreement not to leave the City of Novgorod. On April 18, Antonina was subjected to a complex psychological and psychiatric examination, conducted by psychiatrists and an expert psychologist of Regional Psychoneurological Clinic of Novgorod. The examination decision was that Antonina does not suffer from any kind of psychological disorder now, nor did she suffer from any during the events leading to her being prosecuted.http://www.izbrannoe.ru/9609.html On April 19, officials presented Antonina with the charges under Article 30.3 and Article 105.2, item c) (‚ÄúMurder of a person who is known by the killer to be in a helpless state‚Äù) of the CC-RF. At 4:30 PM on the same day, the Novgorod City Court issued an official decision for the measure of restriction; it was incarceration, as the MCI demanded in his request. The MCI motivated his incarceration request by writing that Antonina ‚Äúis charged with an especially grave crime, is currently unemployed, is constantly in contact with her underage daughter, and is actually living on the same premises with her, so that she is in position to commit other acts of violence involving her child. Furthermore, the gravity of the charges is such that one can reasonably suspect the accused of an intent to escape from the authorities and thus to obstruct the justice\\". However, the Article 108 (‚ÄúTaking into custody‚Äù) of the Criminal Procedure Code of Russia stipulates that the incarceration is only to be chosen as a measure of restriction ‚Äúif it is impossible to apply a different, milder measure of restriction‚Äù. Antonina was arrested the same day. In the evening, Kirill Martynov published the first public notice about the case in his LiveJournal blog. On April 20, comments in Kirill's blog and blogs of his family friends hit the top list of the Russian search engine Yandex, which enumerates the most popular Russian blog posts on the basis of the number of links given to these posts in other people's blogs. Other blogs published links to the latter. That same day, Regnum, a Russian news agency, used the phrase ‚ÄúNovgorod case‚Äù, referring to the case in question, for the first time in the history of the case. A LiveJournal community novgorod_delo was created. A popular journalist, TV personality and blogger Maxim Kononenko stopped running his political anecdote blog. Kononenko replaced the usual messages on the blog with information about the case. Many other public figures published their comments on the case online. Among them are Kholmogorov and Chadayev. The defence filed a complaint against Antonina's incarceration at the Novgorod Regional Court under Article 108.11 (right to appeal decisions on selection of measures of restriction) of the Criminal Procedure Code of Russia. The court hearing of the complaint took place on May 8 (see below). On April 21, the NTV TV channel aired a feature called ‚ÄúParticularly dangerous‚Äù on organized crime in Novgorod and its connections to the administration of Novgorod Region. This broadcast initiated a discussion of the issue ‚ÄúNovgorod is Russia‚Äôs national preserve for crime‚Äù as part of Antonina's defence campaign. On April 22, a Novgorod City Duma deputy, Aleksandr Deyna, sent a request for information to the Novgorod City Prosecutor Yefimov. The same day, news about Antonina's arrest began to appear in various online media and other news agencies; the headlines were often misleading, stating that the mother attempted to kill the child. Kirill asked many of his journalist colleagues to replace the existing headlines with neutral ones. In some cases, he threatened journalists with lawsuits against them. Some members of Novgorod_delo community also monitor news about the case. On April 23, Yegor Kholmogorov appeared on the \\"Mayak\\" radio station with a report on the case. On the same day, National News Agency published an article by Aleksey Koryakov, a journalist. Koryakov supported the point of view of the prosecution and accused the LiveJournal community of ‚Äúattempts to pressure the jury‚Äù. On April 24, a Russian State Duma deputy A.V.Chuyev was presented with a letter describing the case. The defence signed a contract with a new lawyer, Konstantin Rybalov, of the law firm ‚ÄúBarshchevsky and partners‚Äù. On April 25, an official reply of Kolodkin to the deputy Deyna's request for information arrived in the mail. The New Novgorod Newspaper published a page-size article by Aleksey Koryakov which, again, supported in every detail the point of view of the prosecution. Later Koryakov apologized to Antonina and published another, more accurate article. On April 26, the defence lawyer filed an official appeal to the director of the prison where Antonina was incarcerated. The appeal focused on the complaints about the poor state of her health. Kirill Martynov published a dummy for a letter to the Office of Prosecutor General of Russia in his blog. Many people subsequently used this dummy to send letters. The novgorod_delo community launched a campaign to give support to Antonina, which ran in late April ‚Äì early May. People all over the world sent numerous letters, telegrams and faxes to the prison. On April 27, the defence lawyer filed a request at the Office of Novgorod Region Public Prosecutor. The request demanded to repeal the incarceration decision under Article 110 (‚ÄúCancellation or Change of a Measure of Restriction‚Äù) of the Criminal Procedure Code of Russia. Furthermore, the request asked to close the criminal case as there is no corpus delicti in Antonina's actions. On April 28, a press conference organized by Maxim Kononenko, Aleksey Chadayev and Kirill Martynov took place in Novgorod text and video. On April 29, a website on the Novgorod Case appeared on the Internet.novgoroddelo.ru On May 2, the Public Chamber Committee for Protection of the Rights of Children publishes a statement on the Novgorod Case. On May 4, the investigator has the defence lawyer Rybalov sign an agreement of non- disclosure of pre-investigation information. The investigators conduct investigative actions in the house where the original event took place. Antonina participates in these actions. Kirill Martynov states publicly that ‚Äúthe Novgorod attorneys who have been working with us bear a large part of responsibility for the situation that we have now.‚Äù On May 5, NTV TV-channel devotes a part of its evening news broadcast to the case text and video. On May 6, a Novgorod NGO ‚ÄúRegional Center for Human Rights‚Äù publishes a statement about ‚ÄúNovgorod case‚Äù. In the evening, another lawyer joins the defence team. On May 7, the Novgorod Case becomes the subject of the ‚ÄúMorning page‚Äù broadcast on \\"Echo of Moscow\\" radio station \\"Echo\\" website transcript, LJ message. In the evening, Antonina was released from the prison after signing an agreement not to leave the City of Novgorod; the reason for the release was a decision Novgorod City Prosecutor Yefimov. Kirill Martynov wrote in his blog about Antonina's health. According to Kirill, she suffered from a severe cold and acute heart pain while in prison. Upon exiting, she had some gray hair. Antonina also lost weight and weighed only 36 kilos at the time when Kirill reported on her health. On May 8, Novgorod Regional Court repealed the Novgorod City Court decision that put Antonina in prison; the Regional Court decision stated that the City Court did not have sufficient reasons for changing the original measure of restriction for incarceration, and that it committed breaches of the Criminal Procedure Code of Russia in effectuating this change. On the same day, new messages appeared in Antonina's blog. She told her readers that it was now illegal for her to visit Alisa without a presence of an official representative of the child (that is, Alisa's father and Antonina's ex-husband). On May 13, Antonina published online a video in which she addressed the LiveJournal users who supported her. Her first interview after the release is also published text and video. On May 16, the defence filed a complaint at the Office of the Novgorod City Public Prosecutor, appealing against the decision that forbade Antonina to visit her daughter. The same day, the First channel TV channel airs a program entitled ‚ÄúLet Them Talk,‚Äù one part of which dealt with the ‚ÄúNovgorod case‚Äù (Kirill's LJ text message and video. A Novgorod City Court session was scheduled for May 25 to hear a defence complaint against Kolodkin's actions, but it was postponed because of Antonina's absence (health reasons). The complaint concerned the investigator's denial to join a number of defence's documents and statements to the case. This denial was repealed a day before, on May 24, by a decision of the office of Novgorod City Public Prosecutor. On May 30, the Novgorod City Court issued a decision on the complaint. The Court refused to consider the investigator's actions to be illegal, alluding to the May 24 decision of the Office of Novgorod City Public Prosecutor, which, in the court's opinion, made void the matter at issue of the complaint. On May 31, Antonina received a letter from the office of Novgorod City Public Prosecutor with a decision that repealed the interdict to visit her daughter. On June 4, the defence filed a moral damage suit against the Office of Novgorod City Public Prosecutor, at the Novgorod City Court. On the same day, Antonina underwent an outpatient psychological examination. On June 8, Kolodkin, while on an official business trip to Moscow, attempted to approach and arrange interviews with those witnesses for the defence who live in Moscow. In the next few days, he collected the evidence from witnesses. On June 9, the defence filed a request challenging the investigator and demanding an inquiry into his actions, which were suspicions of constituting a fraud (use of forged documents). On the same day, an investigation team was officially formed in Novgorod. On June 13, the investigation team conducted searches in Antonina's room and apartment. The investigators took Antonina's and Alisa's medical documents, an official report on the results of Antonina's polygraph test (made and signed by Mrs. Olga Belyushina, an expert in polygraph detector data interpreting), Antonina's poems, her letters from the prison, empty floppy disks, etc. The defence fears that evidence so collected may be tampered with. On June 14, Aleskey Chadayev published a LiveJournal account of his interview with Kolodkin. On June 18 and June 20, the official responses of the Office of Novgorod Region Public Prosecutor to defence's complaints were received in the mail. The dates of the reposes were June 7 and June 9. The replies state that ‚Äúthe inquiry revealed there no breaches of law were committed during the investigation‚Äù and that the investigation team ‚Äúis considering all versions of the event, including the version concerning an accident‚Äù. Kirill Martynov published a message telling his readers about his intention to file a complaint against the replies at the office of the Prosecutor General of Russia. The complaint is to contain the list of the breaches of law committed by the investigator and also the list of his other actions that constitute a corpus delicti under several articles of CC-RF. On June 25, the Novgorod City Court turned down the moral damage suit, indicating a formal reason: the suit papers did not mention the home address of the investigator Kolodkin. On the same day, the pre-investigation was prolonged until July 22. On June 26, Antonina received a letter with a written refusal of a temporary permission for her to leave Novgorod to Moscow in order to take the entry exams into Moscow State University. The refusal bears the date of June 24, while the application for the permission was filed on June 18,.http://ljplus.ru/img3/g/o/godsledovatelya/100_3536.JPGhttp://ljplus.ru/img3/g/o/godsledovatelya/100_3537.JPG On June 27, the mail delivered another refusal: this time, the refusal of the challenge to the investigator, dated June 18.http://ljplus.ru/img3/g/o/godsledovatelya/100_3538.JPGhttp://ljplus.ru/img3/g/o/godsledovatelya/100_3539.JPGhttp://ljplus.ru/img3/g/o/godsledovatelya/100_3540.JPGhttp://ljplus.ru/img3/g/o/godsledovatelya/100_3541.JPG On July 4, Kirill and Antonina got married in Novgorod. Antonina took her husband's last name. On July 13, Kolodkin began a series of attempts to interrogate Alisa. Over the next few days, he sent several summons to Alisa's maternal and paternal grandmothers. On July 17, the Novgorod City Prosecutor Yefimov announced his intention to re-examine the case and re-issue the charges against Antonina. On the same day, the term of the pre-investigation was prolonged by another month. On July 27, a new message in novgorod_delo community told the readers that the protective railing from the scene of the event was removed by a saw and taken to the office of the investigator for an investigative experiment with Alisa's participation. The Martynovs refused to allow Alisa to participate in an experiment or interrogation, fearing that the child will be adversely affected by the experience. The Children's Services supported their refusal.http://www.izbrannoe.ru/9615.html On July 31, the investigator issued a decision to arrange an inpatient psychiatric examination of Antonina on the premises of the Moscow Serbsky Institute for Social and Forensic Psychiatry and passed this decision to the Novgorod City Court for approval. The term of the investigation was prolonged one more time, until September 22. The defence believes that the very fact that the investigator calls for a re-examination qualifies as unequivocal evidence that it is impossible to prove that Alisa's fall was an attempt at murder. The court hearing of the said decision was scheduled for August 1. However, it was called off because of the absence of the defence's lawyer, who received the summons too late. The session was rescheduled for August 13. The court officials attempted to bar the press from attending the session. Antonina filed a complaint against the investigator's late issue of summons to her lawyer under Article 125 (‚ÄúCourt Procedure for Considering Complaints‚Äù) of the Criminal Procedure Code of Russia. This complaint was heard by the Novgorod City Court on August 9 (see below). On August 3, a Russian State Duma deputy Yevgeny Royzman received a reply from the Office of the Prosecutor General of Russia to his inquiry, dated July 7. The reply states, among other matters, that Kolodkin was punished for breaches of the Criminal Procedure Code of Russia articles concerning the arrest of the suspect (by way of his quarterly bonus for 3rd quarter 2007 being called off). The reply also states that the Novgorod City Prosecutor and his deputy were reprimanded officially for their lack of due prosecutor supervision. On August 9, the Novgorod City Court rejected Antonina's complaint against the investigator's actions. On August 13, the Novgorod City Court approved the decision of the Office of Novgorod City Public Prosecutor to arrange an inpatient psychiatric examination. The defence planned to appeal this decision at the Novgorod Regional Court. The Russian TV company Triada sent its team to film the session, but the court officials did not allow journalists to enter the court. On August 14, the Head of Public Chamber Committee for Protection of Children's Rights O.V. Zykov filed a request at the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation, demanding that the Prosecutor General Yu. Ya. Chaika inquire into the legality of the latest decisions of the investigation and other issues pertaining to the prosecution of Antonina Martynova.http://www.ljplus.ru/img3/h/v/hvil/zykov0001.pnghttp://www.ljplus.ru/img3/h/v/hvil/zykov0002.png On August 22, Antonina and the defence found out that the case is now in the hands of another investigator, A. V. Yashin. On August 27, Yashin met with the accused. He insisted that Antonina should submit to several medical tests in preparation for her medical evaluation at the Serbsky Institute. Yashin stated this in spite of the fact that the court decision for the hospitalization was not legally in force and was yet to be appealed in Novgorod Regional Court. The Office of Novgorod City Public Prosecutor threatened Antonina with another incarceration if she refuses to submit to testing. On September 6, the investigator Yashin releases the case to the Office of Novgorod City Public Prosecutor, which then delivers it to the newly created Investigation Committee. The Investigative Committee under the Prosecution Office was created on August 1, 2007 by the Presidents executive order N1004. On September 7, Kirill Martynov files a request at the Office of Novgorod City Public Prosecutor, demanding to initiate criminal proceedings against the Novgorod City Prosecutor A.A. Yefimov, his deputy D.S. Mikhailov, and V.V. Kolodkin under Article 299] (attempt to knowingly prosecute an innocent person) of CC-RF. On September 10, the name of the current investigator of the Novgorod case, Dina Palchuk, was announced. On September 11, the Novgorod Regional Court refused the appeal against the Novgorod City Court decision to conduct an inpatient psychiatric examination of Antonina at Moscow Serbsky Institute, thus upholding the decision. On the same day, Maksim Kononenko stopped updating his blog again, replacing recent messages with an update on the recent turn of events in the Novgorod case. On September 12 Antonina arrived in Moscow in order to undergo an inpatient examination. The examination was postponed and was due to start on September 17. The Head of Public Chamber Committee for Protection of Children's Rights O.V. Zykov published a statement on the recent developments in the case entitled, \\"It began as a farce, but now it is turning into a tragedy\\".http://www.izbrannoe.ru/13681.html On September 17 Antonina arrived at the Moscow Serbsky Institute in order to undergo an inpatient examination. On October 11 the examination was finished, Antonina returned home and met her daughter. On December 17 Kirill Martynov appealed to the media. The next day Antonina was supposed to obtain refiled charges. On December 20 the investigation was formally ended. Antonina obtained the final charges. On December 21 Antonina Martynova and her defence started to examine case before forwarding it to court. Later Kirill insisted that the case lacks any evidence of the motive and the video of the boy's testimony filmed in May 2007 is significantly different than the drawn statement. He also claimed that the latter were obtained with leading questions and the investigator Palchuk denied coping the video testimony. On December 21‚Äì24 the community \\"Novgorod case\\" organized the petition drive. The petition asked the Russian President to direct the attention of the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation (General'naya Procuratura) to the situation around the case and to enforce the checking of the process violation mentioned in the petition. According to the replies which arrived in January 2008, some petitions were forwarded to the Novgorod Regional Prosecutor office (regional procuratura), some- to the Prosecutor General's Office. = 2008 = On January 9, a statement by Kirill Martynov was filed to the Novgorod procuratura officially. The statement claimed that prosecution of Antonina was illegal. It was later redirected by the city procuror to the Investigative Committee. The Committee did not accept it for consideration. Later, this rejection was appealed in the city court which dismissed the motion. On January 10, a motion was filed in the city court to overturn the denial to provide videocopy of the boy's testimony. The motion was dismissed on January 14. On January 23 Antonina and her defence finished examining the case materials. The defence filed several motions. On January 29 the case was sent to the prosecutor's office (similar to the United States DA) to approve the charges. However, it was returned for an additional investigation. Martynovs found out about this only in the beginning of March. An information was published on March 14 regarding dissemination of flyers about the \\"Novgorod Case\\" by the Novgorod Regional Human Rights Center. On March 26, the website of the Novgorod Regional office of the Investigative Committee published an appeal to media requesting to avoid publishing any defence opinions without comments of prosecutors. The motivation was that \\"dissemination and analysis [...] of one-sided opinions [...] without using official case documents, as it often happens, is biased and plays a significant role in creation of the negative public opinion about the law-enforcement agencies\\". The appeal mentioned the possible criminal prosecution for ignoring this request. On April 16, a newspaper Rossijska gazeta published an article by Vladimir Bogdanov that was biased toward prosecution. Lately, a libel suit was filed against the newspaper and Bogdanov. The working committee for the child protection of the Public Chamber passed a resolution regarding the publication. On April 17 Antonina received the filed charges which were transferred to court on April 18. On May 13 a preliminary hearing took place and the prosecution asked for closed court hearing. The motion was sustained. The suspect's husband asked media to publicize this fact public. The court's decision about closing the process was appealed on May 23. On May 21, the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation held hearings about the \\"Novgorod Case\\". On June 24, the TV show People's world (First Channel) hosted by N. N. Drozdov discussed the \\"Novgorod Case\\". The boy who eye-witnessed the alleged murder attempt was shown on the TV for the first time. The material was filmed in Novgorod at the beginning of September 2007. On May 19, a signature collection drive started in Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, Voronezh and two other cities. The drive started online on June 9. The number of online signatures exceeded a thousand in three days. The petition asked Russian President Medvedev to look into the situation around the criminal prosecution of A. V. Martynova and to protect her constitutional rights. On June 24, the signatures were given to the President's administration. On June 19 and June 24 the jury was selected. The hearing in the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation was scheduled on July 30 to discuss the motion about the closing of the process for public. However, the motion was dismissed. According to the Article 236 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a court's decision in the preliminary hearings cannot be stricken down. Despite the fact that the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation previously overturned this prohibition in several cases as infringement on the constitutional rights, the similar cases were not heard in the Constitutional Court before. On July 2‚Äì22 the closed hearings took place in Novgorod. On July 24, the jury by 11 votes of 12 pronounced Antonina guilty in the murder attempt without extenuating circumstances. On July 26 Antonina posted the last (for today) entries to her blog about her daughter's birthday. On July 28 and July 29, she didn't appear before the court where the verdict results were to be discussed and conviction was expected. Her husband stated that both she and her daughter are missing since the night of July 27, and he knows nothing about their location. The court changed Martynova's measure of restriction to arrest in her absence. Hearing of the case was suspended. On August 7, official retrieval of Mrs. Martynova was announced in Novgorod region; on August 18 it was announced at the federal level.  What happened: the version of the prosecution  :This section is a slightly abridged version of Kolodkin's official reply to the official request for information filed by Novgorod City Duma deputy Aleksandr Deyna. The full text of the said reply in Russian is published in Deyna‚Äôs blog (the record in question is dated April 25, 2007). The pre-investigation revealed that on February 26, 2007, about 9 o‚Äôclock AM, Antonina Fyodorova proceeded to carry out the premeditated murder of her three-year-old daughter Alisa, who was a hindrance to her mother's private life. At this time, she took Alisa from her apartment (No. 31, located on the second floor of 26 Kosmonavtov Street, where they are officially registered) to the staircase landing. Thinking that no witnesses to her actions are present in the stairwell, Antonina proceeded to stage an accidental fall of her daughter from the third-floor landing. As Alisa's mother, Antonina was fully aware of her daughter's young age. Therefore, Antonina was sure that the three-year-old was incapable either of completely understanding the criminal intent of her mother or of putting up a fight against her. Antonina, fully intending to kill her daughter, pushed Alisa through the metal bars of the railing of the stairwell in such a manner that Alisa found herself beyond the zone of safety. In the next few seconds, Antonina held Alisa by the hands, and then, so as to continue the implementation of her criminal design and fulfill it, Antonina let Alisa go, thus actually throwing her daughter down the stairwell. These actions resulted in Alisa's falling down the stairwell and in Alisa's body and head's hitting the stone floor of the ground floor landing. However, Antonina was ultimately unable to complete her premeditated crime due to circumstances outside of her control. The fall failed to result in Alisa's death, though she hit the stone floor. She sustained the following body injuries: a lower jaw fracture (left side), a full dislocation of three teeth, a concussion, some abrasions to her chin, and a bruise in the groin (right side). These body injuries are classified to be of medium severity because they led to a prolonged incapacitation of the victim amounting to no less than three weeks. After the initial inquiry into the event, on March 22, 2007, the Office of Novgorod City Public Prosecutor officially opened a criminal case No. 9973 against Antonina Fyodorova, born in 1985, under Articles 30.3 and 105 of CC-RF. Antonina was officially interrogated as a suspect on April 9, 2007. As a restriction measure, the investigation ordered her to sign a written undertaking stating that she is not to leave the city of Novgorod. During the initial inquiry and later during the interrogations, both as a suspect and as an accused, Antonina was unable to produce a coherent version of the events. Her evidence was garbled and inconsistent because her goal was to exonerate herself and represent the crime she had committed as a mere accident. Antonina's guilt in the committing the said crime is proved beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence provided by an eyewitness, a minor (an 11-year-old boy who, during the event, stood on the third floor landing), who witnessed the criminal actions as they were being committed.  What happened: the version of the defence  Antonina and Alisa on Alisa's birthday on July 26, 2006. This photo has figured prominently on Russian websites starting in April 2007. =Background= Antonina is originally from Veliky Novgorod. Her mother, Ninel Stepanova, still lives there. Ninel, Antonina, and Alisa are officially registered as living in a room at a Veliky Novgorod hostel. However, since October 2006 Antonina and Alisa lived in Moscow with Kirill Martynov. The young woman and her child traveled to Novgorod on February 2 to visit Ninel and to collect Antonina's high school diploma from the Novgorod State University. Antonina intended to apply to the undergraduate program of Faculty of Philosophy at Moscow State Lomonosov University later in the summer. Antonina and Alisa did not plan a prolonged stay in Novgorod, but because Alisa fell ill, the mother and daughter were forced to remain there. =The accident= On the February 26 at 9 o‚Äôclock, Ninel left for work. The family decided to leave the front door unlocked because the neighbors' children usually come home from school around noon and have a habit of kicking the door and disturbing Alisa's afternoon nap. On February 25, the day before the event, the family had an argument with these kids. They had been using swear words and speaking loudly, and Alisa heard them. The kids were asked to behave, but they reacted negatively to this. After Ninel left for work, Alisa sat in the room eating candy. Antonina went to the bathroom to brush her teeth. When she came back, the child was missing. Antonina ran to the staircase landing looking for Alisa. She saw her daughter squeeze herself between the bars of the railing. The staircase landings in that building are wide, so it was difficult for Antonina to catch her daughter in time before Alisa fell through the bars. Alisa fell two floors, from the third floor landing down to the first floor. Antonina ran down the steps and called an ambulance, and she and Alisa were rushed off to the hospital. An 11-year-old boy, a friend of a neighbor's son, was standing on the landing one floor above when the fall occurred. He ran to the neighbors and told them that ‚Äúone little girl pushed another down.‚Äù This evidently prompted the neighbors to call the police. The police came to the hospital and interrogated Antonina, who was still in the state of a shock, while her child was undergoing a medical examination. After three days in the hospital, the administration stated that there was not enough room for Alisa and Antonina and suggested that they should go home. At the time when the family left the hospital, the physicians declared Alisa's injuries to be of medium severity (because of a jaw fracture). Antonina and Alisa did not go back to Moscow since the mother was afraid that the little girl was still unfit for such a journey. Besides, Alisa's health insurance covered her only in Novgorod, and Alisa's relatives who lived in Novgorod wanted to help the family while the little girl convalesced. Antonina loathed the idea of going back to the building where the accident took place, so she and Ninel rented an apartment in the Novgorod suburbs. =The aftermath of the accident = Three weeks after the accident, Antonina and Alisa were getting ready to go back to Moscow. Antonina's March 18 birthday was approaching, and she wanted to celebrate it in Moscow, and Alisa had recovered and was fit for travel. However, on March 16, a policeman presented Antonina with official court summons. The written summons called on her ‚Äúto testify as a witness.‚Äù However, the policeman told Antonina that his colleagues found a corpus delicti in her actions and that they firmly believed it was not an accident and that she was going to be prosecuted under Article 105 of CC-RF (that is, for murder). Kirill Martynov testified on March 19, stating that the information about the family's unstable financial situation is false. As evidence, he brought bank slips certifying to his having sent money to Antonina on February 26 and March 9. Before that, the prosecution stressed that Antonina was an unemployed single mother who lacked means of sustenance. The defence, however, claimed that Kirill firmly backed the family financially and enabled Antonina to devote all her time to her daughter. According to the witnesses, Alisa calls Kirill ‚ÄúDaddy.‚Äù At first, the documents produced by the defence were officially added to the case, as the investigator informed the defence lawyer in an oral conversation. A few days later, however, the prosecution removed these documents from the case and issued an official decision rejecting these. = The Position of the Defence = From the beginning, the defence has stressed that the case had been fabricated and that there is plenty of evidence to corroborate this point of view. According to the defence: * Antonina has no motive to kill her daughter. Alisa was in no way ‚Äúa hindrance to her mother's private life‚Äù, as the investigator Kolodkin claimed. Even assuming that she were a hindrance, Antonina's ex-husband was willing and able to assume Alisa's custody at any time. * The investigation has paid attention only to the testimony of the only eyewitness, who, at the age of 11, is a minor. The investigation has ignored other documents and testimonies provided by the defence, such as descriptions of Antonina's character. The investigation also refused to add to the case a number of family photos taken before the accident. As any outside observer can attest, these photos demonstrate this is a happy family. * The investigator's choice of witnesses is biased. Neither the ambulance doctors nor the physicians who examined and attended to Alisa and Antonina in the hospital were officially interrogated. * The scene of the accident is poorly observable from the position where the only eyewitness was standing. There is ample room for the eyewitness to misinterpret what he had seen. * Representatives of the prosecution have changed their interpretation of what took place in their comments to the media. At first, they stated that Antonina had pushed Alisa down. Then they stated that she had held the child above the stairwell and dropped her. Kirill Martynov believes that in one of these versions, the prosecutor clearly must have lied. * The boy who witnessed the fall has changed his version of the events over the course of the investigation. The evidence provided by the mass media indirectly supports this claim of the defence. Thus, speaking on a Russian talk show (the \\"Let them talk\\" show mentioned above, see Timeline, May 16), an older neighbor stated that the boy had said that Antonina pushed the little girl between the upper, horizontal bars of the railing, saying ‚Äú–ë—É–¥–µ—à—å –µ—â–µ? –ë—É–¥–µ—à—å –µ—â–µ?‚ÄùConsidering the speaker's tone and the context given by her story, ‚ÄúNow, will you do that again? Will you?‚Äù However, in an interview with Aleksey Koryakov in The New Novgorod Newspaper, the boy himself stated, ‚ÄúNo, they didn‚Äôt say anything at all. They just stood there silently‚Äù; he also stated that the bars in question were the lower vertical ones. * The case against Antonina was begun a month after the accident. Antonina was incarcerated two months after the accident. She spent all this time with Alisa. * The height from which Alisa fell is clearly insufficient for premeditated murder by dropping a child. * There are much simpler ways to commit such a crime. * It is nearly impossible to push a child through a 15-centimeter gap between the bars. It is practically impossible to do so without making the child scream, while the only eyewitness claims that Alisa was silent. * Antonina passed an independent polygraph test by Olga Belyushina (see Timeline, March 20). The conclusion of the examination was that ‚ÄúShe did not have the intention to inflict harm on her child and she did not inflict harm on her.‚Äù * The state investigator has made biased comments to the media. For example, he said: ‚ÄúYes, she took her by the hands, took her daughter (I don‚Äôt know, well, I wouldn‚Äôt even call her a mother after this sort of stuff‚Ä¶), she took both of [Alisa‚Äôs] hands, held her above the abyss and‚Ä¶ threw her down‚Äù. Because of such comments to the press, Antonina sought legal action in defence of her honor and dignity. * The investigation has committed numerous violations of the criminal and procedural law during the investigation. These violations have been listed in the charges against the investigator (see Timeline, June 9). * After the beginning of a public campaign to defend Antonina, the attorney of the defence, all the witnesses, and the accused have been ordered to sign a non-disclosure undertaking. The defence attorney believes that ‚Äúwhen the investigation ordered this non- disclosure undertaking and made the case classified, its only goal was to conceal the absence of evidence‚Äù.  Appraisal of some statements by the parties  * On April 20, the Novgorod City Prosecutor Andrey Yefimov made the following statement while talking with a \\"Gazeta.ru\\" journalist: \\"Our experts have reached an irrefutable conclusion that the child was pushed through the railing by force, as it is impossible for a girl of that age to get through the bars there on her own\\". Kirill Martynov published a message (with some relevant photos) in his blog which aims to refute this statement by the Prosecutor.  Public Response  Major Russian TV channels, radio stations and newspapers have covered the case in question. It has figured prominently in online discussions, particularly in the Livejournal blog system. Many well- known Russian public figures, engaged in politics, culture, and other areas of life, became involved in the case. They include: * Maksim Kononenko, a TV host and blogger * Aleksey Chadaev, Valery Ganichev, and Anatoly Kucherena, members of the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation * Oleg Zykov, the Head of the Public Chamber Committee for the Protection of Children's Rights * Yevgeny Roizman, a Russian State Duma deputy * Alexander Deyna, a Novgorod City Duma deputy * Yegor Kholmogorov, a writer * Konstantin Rybalov, a lawyer of the firm ‚ÄúBarshchevsky and Partners‚Äù (currently the attorney for the defence) The discussions on this topic have raised numerous issues that go beyond the question of Antonina's innocence, such as: * whether it is permissible to leave young children unattended, even for a short time * whether the preliminary incarceration of people who do not appear to be a threat to society is advisable; * whether the testimony of one minor is sufficient to prosecute a murder case; * whether it is permissible to influence government organizations, specifically the representatives of the investigation and prosecution, by raising public awareness of the case through the Internet; * the imperfections in the existing system to enforce children's rights in Russia; * how the investigators conduct the (criminal) cases de facto and what are their real obligations in that respect under the Criminal Procedure Code of Russia currently in force; * the interactions between the prosecution, the court and the defence; * the general situation with crime in the Novgorod region.

Blank is recognized for developing the customer development method that launched the lean startup movement, a methodology which recognized that startups are not smaller versions of large companies, but require their own set of processes and tools to be successful. His Lean Launchpad class (taught as the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps, or I-Corps) has become the standard for commercialization for all federal research. Blank writes and teaches about customer development and the lean startup method. He is an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship at Stanford; lectures at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business, and is a senior fellow at Columbia University. He has written four books: The Four Steps to the Epiphany, Not All Those Who Wander Are Lost, The Startup Owner's Manual, and Holding a Cat by the Tail. Early life Blank was born to immigrant parents who ran a grocery in the Chelsea neighborhood in New York City. He grew up with a sister who was 12 years older than him and both siblings were raised by his mother after his father left home when he was aged 6. He attended the University of Michigan, but dropped out after one semester. His military career took him to Thailand during the Vietnam War, where he was managing a team of 15 electronics technicians within a year and a half. After leaving the military, Blank moved to Palo Alto. Startup career Steve Blank arrived in Silicon Valley at the start of the business boom in 1978. His first job in the region was with ESL, a startup that was a pioneering company for National Reconnaissance. The company helped the government understand the Soviets' technological and arms developments during the Cold War. Some of his ventures include Zilog and MIPS Computers, Convergent Technologies, Ardent, SuperMac Technologies, ESL and Rocket Science Games. In the case of Rocket Science games, he raised $35 million in venture capital, but the company spent it all without producing a viable product. Despite his investors losing out on their returns, they were willing to provide him with an additional $12 million to begin his next startup. Blank believes that the investors are probably glad they stuck with him, as he ultimately put over $1 billion back into their pockets throughout his many startup ventures. Blank co-founded his 8th and last startup, the Customer Relationship Management provider E.piphany, in 1996 and retired the day before its IPO in September 1999. =Customer development methodology= Blank created the customer development methodology in the mid 1990s. The concept details a scientific approach that can be applied by startups and entrepreneurs to improve their products success by developing a better understanding of customers' problems/needs as well as the other hypotheses necessary to build a commercial successful company. =Lean startup movement= Blank's customer development methodology is a cornerstone of the lean startup movement, popularized by Eric Ries whom Blank states was \\"the best student I ever had.\\" The lean startup approach relies on validated learning, scientific experimentation, and iterative product releases to shorten product development cycles, measure progress, and gain valuable customer feedback. Blank and Ries developed the ideas beginning around 2004 when Blank was an investor and advisor to the company, IMVU, that Ries co- founded.Ries, Eric. The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses. Crown Publishing. 2011, p. 103. ISBN‚Ä†978-0-307-88791-7 The lean startup has been adopted by entrepreneurs worldwide as a constructive way to try out ideas and gain customers. Ries has integrated the customer development methodology into the lean startup practices and considers it to be one of the lean startup movement's pillars. Academic teaching career Blank began teaching entrepreneurship in 2002 at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business and has since taught entrepreneurship to both undergraduate and graduate students. He currently teaches at Stanford, the University of California Berkeley Haas School of Business, New York University and Columbia. His Lean LaunchPad curricula uses the customer development methodology and lean startup methods he developed throughout his career as a serial entrepreneur and academic. Lean LaunchPad In January 2011, Blank created the Lean LaunchPad class at Stanford University, Columbia Business School and UC Berkeley. The class is a method for teaching entrepreneurship that combines experiential learning with the three building blocks of a successful lean startup: Alexander Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas, Blank's customer development model, and agile engineering. The Lean LaunchPad changed the way entrepreneurship is taught. Instead of relying on the traditional business school practice of teaching students how to write a standard corporate business plan, or simply build a product, the course provides hands-on experience in what it takes to start a company. Students propose and immediately test business hypotheses. They get out of the building to talk to 10‚Äì15 prospective customers, partners and others each week. They use the customer feedback acquired in these interviews to refine their product or service by building a new minimal viable product weekly; ensure their product or service meets a customer need or solves a customer problem; and validate that they have created a repeatable, scalable business model. Since its inception, Blank's course has been adopted by more than 100 universities worldwide, and more than 300,000 people have taken a free online version of the class at Udacity. National Science Foundation Innovation Corps In July 2011 the National Science Foundation asked Blank to adapt his Lean LaunchPad class for its Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which develops and nurtures a national innovation ecosystem by helping discoveries from fundamental research to become new companies. The course is now the standard for science commercialization, serving as the syllabus of the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (I-Corps) that is taught in 53 universities and has been adopted by the other federal research agencies (NIH, DOE, HHS, NSA); and is helping to drive innovation within the U.S. government, particularly within the defense and intelligence community. Following a successful pilot, the I-Corps program quickly expanded. A version of the I-Corps program specifically dedicated to biomedical research, called The I-Corps at NIH, was devised in 2014. As of January 2017, I-Corps has a National Innovation Network of more than 190 colleges and universities, and more than 800 teams of scientists and engineers have gone through the program.

D≈çsojin are often represented as a human couple, carved male or female genitals, large stones or statues, or even tall poles along a road. D≈çsojin are sometimes enshrined in small roadside Shinto shrines called hokora. In rural areas D≈çsojin can be found at village boundaries, in mountain passes, or along country byways, while in urban areas at street corners or near bridges. When shaped like a phallus, they are associated with birth and procreation, and therefore marital harmony. When represented as a human couple, a D≈çsojin is revered as a deity of marriage and fertility. The D≈çsojin is on the left  History  The origin of D≈çsojin stone markers is uncertain and has no exact date. It is known, however, that after Buddhism was introduced to India, Jiz≈ç became a tutelary of travelers and pilgrims. Accordingly, he began to preside over pilgrimage routes and mountain passes in India and Southeast Asia in the form of statues. Important d≈çsojin =Sae no Kami= In modern times, D≈çsojin have become fused in popular belief with a different deity having similar characteristics called \\"Sae no kami\\", whose birth is described in the Kojiki. When kami Izanagi-no-mikoto sought to leave after going to the realm of the dead (Yomi no Kuni) to visit his spouse Izanami-no-mikoto, he was chased by the demoness . To stop her, he threw her a stick from which Sae no Kami was born. For this reason, he is the kami who prevents the passage of the spirits of the dead into the world of the living, and therefore a god who is a protector of boundaries. He is represented by large rocks set at the edges of villages. Because of the rocks' elongated shape, he came to be associated also with childbirth, children and matrimonial happiness. As a consequence, he was in turn associated also with Jiz≈ç, the bodhisattva who is the protector of children. Roku Jiz≈ç =Jiz≈ç= Jiz≈ç is the Japanese version of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, a Buddhist bodhisattva worshiped mainly in East Asia. His assimilation within a group of kami is an example of the Japanese syncretism of Buddhism and Shinto (shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç). Originally from India, in Japan he was given new attributes and has become the guardian of children, expecting mothers, firemen, travelers, pilgrims, and unborn, aborted, or miscarried children. He is depicted as a plain monk, sometimes holding his in one hand and the in the other. Statues of Jiz≈ç can be found along mountain passes or harrowing roads in Japan, often dressed in red, sometimes white, caps and bibs by distressed parents. Small stones are frequently piled in front of a Jiz≈ç statue, a tradition believed to relieve a child of their penance. Jiz≈ç statues commonly appear in groupings of six, called Roku Jiz≈ç. Six because of Jiz≈ç's vow to exist concurrently at all six states of Karmic Rebirth. A Roku Jiz≈ç appears in the Japanese folktale Kasa Jiz≈ç. =Chimata no Kami= , according to the Kojiki, was born when kami Izanagi threw away his trousers to wash himself after returning from Yomi, the land of the dead. The Nihongi and Kogosh≈´i tell the same myth, but call the kami Sarutahiko. Chimata-no-kami symbols can be found at crossroads, perhaps because of the deity being associating with joining, and some famous onsens, to cure sexual or fertility issues. = Bat≈ç Kannon = Bat≈ç Kannon is the bodhisattva of compassion and keeps a watchful eye over the animal state of Karmic Rebirth. Atop Bat≈ç Kannon's head rests a horse's head. Stone statues of this deity can be found beside perilous paths and byways, like Jiz≈ç statues, in northern Japan. However, Dosojin in Bat≈ç Kannon's form not only protect travelers, but their horses as well.  Worship  Every January 15 in the village of Nozawaonsen, Nagano the Dosojin Matsuri is held. The Dosojin Matsuri is a fire festival meant to celebrate the birth of a family's first child, exorcise y≈çkai, and ensure blissful marriages. The day prior to the Dosojin Matsuri, a hundred or so residents of Nozawaonsen construct a shaden. Meanwhile, across the glade are two wooden poles that represent a human couple, the village's version of D≈çsojin. On the day of the festival the shaden is burned in a scuffle between men ages twenty-five and forty-two‚Äîconsidered unlucky ages for men in Japan‚Äîand the rest of the villagers who bear reed torches. As the shaden burns, the village men of forty-two years sing to the D≈çsojin. The men ages twenty-five and forty-two play a key role in the festival to attain the protection of the D≈çsojin, so that the misfortune brought about by their ages will be nullified.

Abduction and suspected murder of Ylenia Lenhard  Von Aesch apparently committed suicide by shooting himself in the head on July 31, 2007, a few hours after Lenhard disappeared, and shortly after shooting a 46-year-old man. Von Aesch's body was found the following day. A backpack with Lenhard's clothes inside and her cycling helmet were found near von Aesch's body and was found to carry his DNA. Traces of Lenhard's DNA were also found in a white van owned by von Aesch, containing a mattress that he had been using to sleep on. Witnesses have said a man matching von Aesch's description had been seen outside the public bath in Appenzell for at least 10 days. Swiss police announced on September 15, 2007 that a body had been discovered in the woods between the villages of Oberb√ºren and Niederwil considered almost certain to be Lenhard's. On September 16 2007 the Swiss police confirmed that the found body was in fact the remains of Lenhard. The man who found the corpse on his own has received a reward of approximately $20,000. The sum was gathered by authorities and relatives to keep the search going. The finder stated: \\"If the wild animals hadn't dug her up from the 1‚Äì2 foot deep hole where she was buried, probably no one would have ever found her.\\" Wild animals had torn parts of the body, especially the upper torso, apart. This forced forensics to identify the body with a DNA match. Police think it is very probable that she was the victim of a rape-murder crime. Although on September 19, 2007, the police said, they didn't find any evidence that she was raped before or after she was murdered. The cause of her death was toluol poisoning. Von Aesch had a criminal record and was sentenced to 15 months in jail in 1961 after trying to extort ten thousand Swiss francs from a businessman in Zurich by threatening to kidnap his young son. He sent him a letter saying \\"...how terrible must it be, to live through the day not knowing if your dear Geni will return from day care...\\" (translated). In 1990 he married and moved to Benimantell, a village 15 km from Benidorm in Spain. Police in St. Gallen have also re-opened enquiries into the disappearances of five other girls who disappeared in the area before von Aesch moved to Spain.  Suspected in the McCann case  Von Aesch was also briefly a suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. He was thought to be close to Praia da Luz when Madeleine McCann disappeared. A white van with Spanish number plates matching the description of von Aesch's was seen parked for several days in front of the McCann's apartment. The van was not seen again after Madeleine disappeared. In 2013, Scotland Yard officers, as part of their ongoing review, travelled to St. Gallen to investigate possible links between the two crimes. Swiss police said that no such links had been established.Criminalit√©: Scotland Yard a enqu√™t√© √† St-Gall pour l'affaire Maddie - Suisse - 24heures.ch  Notes  2007 deaths Criminals who committed suicide Swiss kidnappers Swiss criminals Suicides by firearm in Switzerland Year of birth missing Suicide in 2007 ","title":"Urs Hans von Aesch"},{"id":"13250895","text":"Gr√∂ben is a village and a former municipality in the district Burgenlandkreis, in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.

Secondary Route 337 travels through more western towns of the Lanaudi√®re region towards the northern Montreal suburbs of Terrebonne and Mascouche located along Autoroute 25 just north of the east end of Laval. Railway service also exists since the late 19th century part of a Canada-wide development initiated by the first Canadian Prime Minister John A. Macdonald which help develop several small industries despite frequent departures by several locales towards the United States in the late 19th century.

Biography Thraves began making early short experimental films in 1989 at the University of Humberside, having previously studied illustration. His graduation film Scratch (1991) and The Take-Out (1993), a short film made under the BFI New Directors scheme, both went on to win awards at film festivals worldwide. He joined the Royal College of Art in 1993 where he made another award-winning film, The Hackney Downs (1995). Career After leaving the Royal College of Art he joined Oil Factory, a music video company, making his breakthrough video in 1995 for Radiohead for their song \\"Just\\" where a man played by Dorian Lough is lying on the pavement and is confronted by an angry crowd, this video garnered Thraves a lot of attention for its strong narrative structure and use of subtitles, what the man says to make the crowd lie down at the end of the video still continues to cause discussion amongst fans today. Thraves has made music videos for many artists over the years including Blur, The Verve, Radiohead, and Coldplay and more recently Jake Bugg, Sam Smith and Villagers. His video for Coldplay's \\"The Scientist\\" won three Moon Men at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards in the US, including Best Direction and Breakthrough Video. Thraves directed the short film I Just Want To Kiss You in 1997, starring Martin Freeman which won the Fox Searchlight Award for Best Short Film at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 1998. Thraves made his first feature, The Low Down (2000), with Film 4. It starred Aidan Gillen, Kate Ashfield, Tobias Menzies, Dean Lennox Kelly, Adam Buxton and Joe Cornish. The film was named among the \\"neglected masterpieces\\" of film history by The Observer in its rundown of 50 Lost Movie Classics. His second feature, The Cry of the Owl (2009), an international co-production with BBC Films, starred Paddy Considine and Julia Stiles.

In the 1970s he gained government recognition of indigenous languages as official languages, and helped secure permission for radio stations to broadcast in indigenous languages. In 1988 he was appointed to the government's National Reconciliation Commission to begin the process of accounting for abuses during the civil war. He also worked on the associated Recovery of Historical Memory Project, which was sponsored by the Catholic Church. Two days after he announced the release of its report on victims of the Guatemalan Civil War, Guatemala: Nunca M√°s!, in April 1998, Bishop Gerardi was attacked in his garage and beaten to death. In 2001, in the first trial in a civilian court of members of the military in Guatemalan history, three Army officers were convicted of his death and sentenced to long prison terms. A priest was convicted as an accomplice and also sentenced. Early life Gerardi Conedera, of partial Italian ancestry, was born in Guatemala City on 27 December 1922. He studied at the city's seminary and won a scholarship to study theology in New Orleans, United States. On 21 December 1946, he was ordained a priest and served in several rural areas of Guatemala such as Mataquescuintla, San Pedro Sacatep√©quez and Palencia, as well as in the capital city. Bishop On 9 May 1967, he was elected Bishop of Verapaz, assuming office the following 11 August. In this position, he emphasised pastoral work among indigenous communities of Mayan peoples. During the country's on-going civil war in the 1970s, Gerardi was a strong proponent for the official recognition of Guatemala's indigenous languages, to improve the status of the indigenous peoples. He was instrumental in securing authorisation for two radio stations to broadcast in Mayan languages. In 1974, he was appointed Bishop of Quich√©, but continued working as an Apostolic Administrator in Verapaz. Between 1980 and 1983, El Quich√© saw increased levels of violence in the conflict between the Army and various rebel guerrilla factions. Hundreds of Roman Catholic catechists and heads of Christian communities, most of whom were of Maya origin, were brutally murdered. Gerardi repeatedly asked the military authorities to control their actions. While serving as president of the Guatemalan Conference of Bishops, Gerardi spoke out openly about the Spanish embassy fire of 31 January 1980, in which 39 people lost their lives. Guatemalan government forces were suspected of having sparked the fire. That same year he was called to the Vatican to attend a synod. Upon returning to Guatemala, he was denied entry to the country because of his public criticism. He travelled to neighbouring El Salvador, which refused to grant him right of asylum. Gerardi settled temporarily in Costa Rica, where he remained until military president Romeo Lucas Garc√≠a was overthrown in 1982. The change in government allowed Gerardi to return to his dioceses in Guatemala. On 28 August 1984, he was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Guatemala. National Reconciliation Commission In 1988 the Conference of Bishops assigned Gerardi and Rodolfo Quezada Toru√±o to serve on the National Reconciliation Commission established by the government. This later led to the creation of the Office of Human Rights of the Archbishopric (Oficina de Derechos Humanos del Arzobispado; ODHA). It continues to provide assistance to victims of human rights violations. Guatemala: Nunca m√°s, the REMHI Report. Work began on the Recovery of Historical Memory (REMHI) project, to collect the facts and history of Guatemala's long civil war and confront the truth of those years. On 24 April 1998, REMHI presented the results of its work in the report Guatemala: Nunca m√°s. This report summarized testimony and statements of thousands of witnesses and victims of repression during the Civil War. \\"The report laid the blame for 80 per cent of the atrocities at the door of the Guatemalan Army and its collaborators within the social and political elite.\\" The task of historical recovery that Gerardi and his team pursued was fundamental in the subsequent work of the UN-sponsored Historical Clarification Commission (CEH). This was set up within the framework of the 1996 peace process, to bring out the facts about the period of the long government repression. Some critics accused the Vatican, the REMHI and Gerardi of furthering Marxist propaganda because the REMHI blames the National Army for the vast majority of deaths during the civil war. The UN Truth Commission Report, released in February 1999, came to similar conclusions as the REMHI report. Assassination On 26 April 1998, two days after the publication of Guatemala: Nunca m√°s, Bishop Gerardi was attacked and bludgeoned to death in the garage of the parish house of San Sebastian Church, where he was the pastor. His assailants used a concrete slab as the murder weapon. The bishop was so damaged in the brutal attack that his face was unrecognisable and identification of the corpse was made by means of his episcopal ring. On 8 June 2001, three army officers: Colonel Byron Disrael Lima Estrada and Captain Byron Lima Oliva (who were father and son), and Jos√© Obdulio Villanueva, were convicted of Gerardi's murder and sentenced to 30-year prison terms. The priest Mario Orantes, whom the court had identified as an accomplice, was sentenced to 20 years. The case was precedent-setting in that it was the first time that members of the military had been tried in a civilian court. The defendants appealed, and in March 2005 an appeals court lowered the Limas' sentences to 20 years each. Orantes' sentence was left unchanged. Villanueva had been killed in a prison riot in 2003 before the appeal verdict was reached. The Constitutional Court in April 2007 upheld the new sentences. Lima Estrada, the father, had been trained at the School of the Americas. He was later granted parole in 2012. Lima Oliva, the son, was shot dead in jail in July 2016. Lima Oliva had been denied parole on two different occasions and was attempting to take control of Pavon prison when he was shot dead along with several other prisoners. He was believed to have been a longtime leader of an organized crime cell which was centered from within Pavon prison. Orantes was later granted parole in January 2016. Maite Rico and Bertrand De La Grange in their ¬øQui√©n mat√≥ al Obispo? (\\"Who Killed the Bishop?\\") suggested that the trial was related more to political gains than discovering the truth about the bishop's murder. The court had said that the investigation had to be carried up the chain of command in order to fully obtain all the information regarding the bishop‚Äôs death.

Steve Stockman (R-TX) on July 20, 1995, and cosponsored by Rep. Barbara Cubin (R-WY). It was reintroduced with similar text by Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) in 2005 in the 109th United States Congress, 110th United States Congress, 111th United States Congress, and the 112th United States Congress. The repeatedly introduced bill sparked advocacy from pro-life activists and opposition from pro-choice activists. The bill has never become law. Summary =Findings= The proposed Sanctity of Life Act would have defined human life and legal personhood (specifically, natural personhood) as beginning at conception, \\"without regard to race, sex, age, health, defect, or condition of dependency.\\" By contrast, the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 amended 1 U.S.C. ¬ß 8 to provide that legal personhood includes all Homo sapiens who are \\"born alive\\". Section 2(b)(2) of the bill further would have recognized that each state has authority to protect the lives of unborn children residing in the jurisdiction of that state. Such legislative declarations are nonbinding statements of policy and are used by federal courts in the context of determining the intent of the legislature in legal challenges.Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction, 6th Edition, Vol. 1A (West Group 2000).American Jurisprudence 2d, Vol. 73, \\"Statutes\\" (West Group 2001). =Provisions= The bill would have amended the federal judicial code to remove Supreme Court and district court jurisdiction to review cases arising out of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or practice, or any act interpreting such a measure, on the grounds that such measure: (1) protects the rights of human persons between conception and birth; or (2) prohibits, limits, or regulates the performance of abortions or the provision of public funds, facilities, personnel, or other assistance for abortions. Legislative history The Stockman bill, , was introduced on July 20, 1995, and immediately referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. It was then referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties on July 28, 1995. The first Paul bill, , was introduced on February 10, 2005, and again referred to the Judiciary committee, which referred it to the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property on April 4, 2005. It had five cosponsors. On February 15, 2007, Paul reintroduced the Act in the 110th Congress, with four cosponsors; he reintroduced another version with the same name on June 6, 2007, with five cosponsors. The bills, and , were referred to the Judiciary committee. The committee referred the first bill to the Subcommittee on the Constitution on March 19, 2007, and the second bill to the Subcommittee on Courts on July 16, 2007; both bills expired in subcommittee. In 2009, Paul reintroduced another version of the bill with one cosponsor. Ron Paul introduced it again in March 2011, as , for the 112th Congress (2011-2012). Pro-life advocacy Paul's reintroduction of the bill was introduced the same year as the proposed We the People Act, which would have removed ‚Äúany claim based upon the right of privacy, including any such claim related to any issue of ... reproduction‚Äù from federal court jurisdiction. Neither bill passed the 109th Congress. Paul spoke passionately about his pro-life position, which includes his introduction of the Sanctity of Life Act, while campaigning for U.S. president in 2007, such as in Lawton, Iowa. In 2011 and 2012, Ron Paul pointed to the Sanctity of Life Act to demonstrate his commitment to pro-life principles. Paul Dorr of nearby Ocheyedan became Paul's Iowa campaign field coordinator because of Paul's strong pro-life stance, stating that unlike other Republicans, Paul does not abandon his position while in office; Paul's sponsorship of the Sanctity of Life Act was immediately cited. When Paul mentioned the legislation in a personal \\"Statement of Faith\\", CBN News White House correspondent David Brody noted that Paul was an exception to the pattern of the 2008 Republican candidates for president not engaging in \\"God talk\\". The California Catholic Daily also cited Paul as \\"abortion's 'unshakeable foe'\\" with the Act as evidence. On January 22, 2008, the 35th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, Norma McCorvey (\\"Jane Roe\\"), now a pro-life activist, endorsed Paul for president based on his authorship of the Sanctity of Life Act and the We the People Act.

Rosenzweig, who, with a co-author, has been credited with being the first to attempt to \\"elicit repression\\" in a laboratory setting, became well known after publishing a paper discussing \\"common factors\\" underlying competing approaches to psychotherapy. Biography Rosenzweig, a friend and classmate of B.F. Skinner, earned his doctorate from Harvard College in 1932. He worked at Worcester State Hospital and Clark University before becoming the chief psychologist at the Western State Psychiatric Institute. Rosenzweig taught at Washington University in St. Louis from 1948 until he retired in 1975. He died on August 9, 2004, at the age of 97. Work In the 1930s, Rosenzweig studied repression. With G. Mason, Rosenzweig criticized H. Meltzer's survey of studies of repression in an article published in the British Journal of Psychology. Rosenzweig and Mason argued that the studies reviewed by Meltzer worked with sensory stimuli unrelated to the theory of repression, and \\"failed to develop under laboratory control the experiences which are subsequently to be tested for recall.\\" Donald W. MacKinnon and William F. Dukes credit Rosenzweig and Mason with being \\"the first to make an explicit attempt to elicit repression under conditions of laboratory control and observation.\\" Sigmund Freud was sent reprints of Rosenzweig's attempts to study repression, but replied to Rosenzweig that while he had examined his \\"experimental studies for the verification of the psychoanalytic assertions with interest\\" he could not \\"put much value on these confirmations because the wealth of reliable observations on which these assertions rest make them independent of experimental verification.\\" Rosenzweig became well known after publishing a paper discussing \\"common factors\\" underlying competing approaches to psychotherapy. He argued that all models of therapy could be equally successful, due to competent therapists sharing common factors that aided their patients. His premise became known as the Dodo Bird Verdict or Dodo Bird Hypothesis ‚Äî a reference to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865), in which a dodo bird declares at the end of a race designed to dry everyone off: \\"Everybody has won and all must have prizes.\\" Rosenzweig's study of aggression led to the development of the Rosenzweig Picture-Frustration Study, a test of latent hostility. The Rosenzweig Picture Frustration Study is usually considered a semi-projective technique and involves an examinee responding verbally to a semi-ambiguous picture scenario. Each of the three forms (child, adolescent, and adult) consists of 24 comic strip pictures that portray a situation that might induce frustration. The overall purpose of the study is to assess how the examinee responds to frustration and frustrating situations. The test assumes that the way that the examinee responds to each frustrating situation depicts how they behave in the face of frustration. The worth of this test is based on how aggression is conceptualized into three types. The first direction of aggression can be extragressive meaning that it is turned onto the environment. The second direction is intraggressive meaning that it is turned by the examinee onto the self. The final direction is imaggressive which means that it is evaded in an attempt to gloss over the frustration. In terms of reliability and validity, the P-F Study interscorer reliability is in the range of .80 to .85. The test-retest reliability is fair to marginal.Gregory, Robert. Psychological Testing. Boston: Pearson, 2007. The test became popular in Europe and was featured in Stanley Kubrick's film A Clockwork Orange (1971).

History Catalina was abducted in 1509 by Spanish conqueror Diego de Nicuesa from an indigenous settlement known as Zamba o Galerazamba, where she was the daughter of the local chief. She was sent to Santo Domingo, where she learned the Spanish language and adopted the Catholic religion. Pedro de Heredia required her to serve as an interpreter to the Native Americans. Afterwards, she married Alonso Monta√±ez, Pedro de Heredia's cousin. The events of the Spanish conquest in the area of modern Cartagena ended with the complete annihilation of the Calamari people, which happened while she was enslaved and abducted by the Spaniards. The name of Catalina India appeared in a letter sent for Pedro de Heredia to King Carlos V in 1533. No one knew what her real name was because he began calling her 'Catalina' from 1509 when the Diego de Nicuesa expedition kidnapped and took her to Santo Domingo where she was educated as a Spaniard. From that time she would use Spanish dress only but was still considered a slave. When they returned to Cartagena twenty years after, she was changed. She made the first contact with Corinche Indians after her arrival with Heredia, on the 14 January 1533. She translated for Heredia in the slaughter of the many Indian towns as turbacos that he eliminated in combat to Juan de La Cosa many years ago.

After a very long period of time spent in Barovia, Jander discovers that the woman he knew as Anna was in truth Tatyana, wife of Strahd's Brother, Sergei, and the woman who drove Strahd to murder his own family. She escaped the castle as it entered the demiplane, but lost her mind in the process. Shocked, Jander bands together with a local cleric and a young thief, to the end of killing Strahd. They fail, though the severe damage they inflict on him forces him into an extended healing cycle thereby limiting the speed with which he increased in power as a spell-caster. To that end, Jander somewhat succeeded, at least for the time being, and more so prevented Strahd further access to any more of his own knowledge when he walks into the sunlight for his final death.

His most ambitious non-fiction work was the thirty-volume worldwide geographical tome The Modern Traveller; and his best-selling compilation book The Congregational Hymn Book. Conder was a prominent London Congregationalist, an abolitionist, and took an active part in seeking to repeal British anti-Jewish laws. Early life The fourth son of Thomas Conder, an active Nonconformist who worked in the City of London as an engraver and bookseller, Josiah was born on 17 September 1789 at his father's bookshop in Falcon Street. His grandfather was Dr John Conder, a Dissenting minister and President of Homerton College and his uncle was James Conder the coin collector. In his infancy, Josiah lost the vision in one eye due to smallpox. He was sent a few miles north of the City of London to the village of Hackney, for electrical treatment, a technique believed to be able to prevent the disease from spreading to also cause blindness in his other eye. He recovered, and continued to be educated at a dissenting academy in Hackney village, under the tutorship of the Reverend Mr. Palmer. At the age of ten his first essay were published in 'The Monthly Preceptor', and on reaching fifteen, he began work as an assistant in his family's City bookshop. On reaching the age of 21 (in 1811), he took over the family business. A short time later, Josiah married Joan Elizabeth Thomas ('Eliza Thomas'), one of his circle of friends with whom he had initially formed a literary association in 1810 to jointly contribute to the book, The Associate Minstrels. She continued to write after her marriage, for example contributing two short narratives 'On the Ausonia Butterfly flying over the Summit of Mont Blanc' and 'The Air Orchis' to The Christian Keepsake in 1837. Literary and religious works Josiah Conder's work at the bookshop soon came to an end (c.1819), after wider recognition of his literary talents had led to him being offered the editorship of The Eclectic Review, a prestigious literary journal that he continued to edit for twenty years (1814‚Äì37). With strong Congregational links, he was also invited to edit The Patriot, a newspaper that espoused nonconformist and evangelical causes, and for which he was editor for twenty- three years (1832‚Äì55). Amongst Josiah Conder's published works were: *The Congregational Hymn Book, 1834 *The Withered Oak, 1805 *The Reverie, 1811 *The Star in the East, with Other Poems Chiefly Religious and Domestic, 1824 * Sacred Poems, Domestic Poems, and Miscellaneous Poems, 1824 The Choir and the Oratory, 1836/7 * Analytical and Comparative View of All Religions Now Extant among Mankind, 1838 ** This was a remarkable work in itself‚ÄîConder was the first European writer to distinguish between different traditions of non- European religion. * The Harmony of History with Prophecy, an explanation of the Apocalypse, 1849 * Hymns of Praise, Prayer, and Devout Meditation, 1856 * The Poet of the Sanctuary, I. Watts, 1851 * Pilgrim's Progress by John Bunyan, with a Life of the Author by Josiah Conder, 1838 * Narrative of a Residence in South Africa by Thomas Pringle, with a Life of the Author by Josiah Conder, 1835 The Choir & The Oratory or Praise & Prayer, became noted for one poem, 'The Apocalypse', which earned him a place in English Romantic literature; its popularity prompted him to pen the commentary, The Harmony of History with Prophecy, and Explanation of the Apocalypse for the more interested of his readers. Amongst his hymns are the following: * Baptized into Our Savior's Death * Be Merciful, O God of Grace * Beyond, Beyond That Boundless Sea * Blessed Be God, He Is Not Strict * Bread of Heaven, on Thee We Feed * Comrades of the Heavenly Calling * Day by Day the Manna Fell * Followers of Christ of Every Name * Forever Will I Bless the Lord * Grant Me, Heavenly Lord, to Feel * Thou art the Everlasting Word * 'Tis not that I did choose Thee Cyberhymnal Considered to reflect his evangelical and liberal, nondenominational, outlook, these hymns were widely adopted by churches and chapels throughout the western world. By the early twentieth century, some seventy years after his death, one biographer noted that more of Josiah Conder's hymns were in common use in Britain and the US, than those of any other Congregational author except for the great Dr Isaac Watts and his friend Doddridge. Today, electronic downloads are available for the more popular ones. =Modern Traveller= Although Josiah Conder never travelled abroad himself, he compiled all thirty volumes of The Modern Traveller, his non-fiction publishing epic covering the geography of many of countries of the world. It sold well, but was outsold by his Congregational Hymn Book, some 90,000 copies of which were ordered in its first seven years. * ** v.1. Palestine. ** v.2-3. Syria and Asia. ** v.4.

Brazil and Buenos Ayres. ** v.31-33. Italy. v.1, v.2, v.3 Political work for abolition Josiah Conder's political work included a tract on the superior value of free labour over slave labour. In 1839 he became a founding Committee Member of the British and Foreign Anti-slavery Society for the Abolition of Slavery and the Slave-trade Throughout the World, which is today known as Anti-Slavery International. In this role he was an organiser of, and delegate to, the world's first Anti-slavery convention, which was held in London in 1840 ‚Äì an event depicted in a large painting by Benjamin Haydon that hangs in the National Portrait Gallery, London.The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840, 1841, accessed April 2009 His poem 'The Last Night of Slavery' dated 1 August 1834, evoking the horrors of the middle passage, was published in his collection, The Choir and the Oratory, or Praise and Prayer, 1837. It was republished in the anthology, Slavery, Abolition and Emancipation: writings in the British Romantic Period (London: Pickering & Chatto) in 1999. Josiah Conder's Biographical Sketch of the Late Thomas Pringle, the Secretary of the Anti-Slavery Society, was published in 1835, and widely sold bound together with Thomas Pringle's own Narrative of a Residence in South Africa (1834). Shortly before his untimely death, Josiah Conder was prominent in the campaign to finance and make arrangements for Samuel Ringgold Ward, an African-American who escaped slavery in the US, to travel the length and breadth of Britain speaking to crowds to encourage support for the abolition of slavery in southern states of America, at a time when British foreign policy, as epitomised by Viscount Palmerston, was supportive of slavery in the US in marked contrast to its determined attempts to close down the supply and trade from West African chieftains, eventually isolating just the King of Dahomey and the Chief of Lagos. Samuel Ringgold Ward held a large meeting at Crosby Hall on 20 March 1854, to thank Josiah Conder and others in his close circle, mainly nonconformists such as Dr Thomas Binney and the Rev James Sherman who supported him in England in contrast to the double standards of government policy which prioritised cheap cotton from the southern slave states over African-American civil rights. Joseph Conder's wife also took a role in abolition in the USA. In December 1852, along with a number of other British women of the period, she was part of the group of ladies who met at Stafford House on Friday, 26 December to consider the expediency of addressing a memorial from the women of England to the women of the United States, on the subject of slavery, and developed this work through her role on the sub- committee. Death and memorial Josiah Conder died on 27 December 1855, at St John's Wood, Hampstead, following an attack of jaundice, and was buried at the Congregationalists' nondenominational garden cemetery, Abney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington with a grey, polished granite, chest tomb as his monument. His literary wife Joan, died aged 91 in 1877 and is buried with him and other family members. \\"He left five children, one of whom is a daughter. The four sons are, Mr. Francis R. Conder, a civil engineer and railway contractor; the Rev. Eustace R. Conder, Pastor of the Congregational Church at Poole; Mr. Josiah Conder of the Bank of England; and Mr Charles Conder, who is associated in professional pursuits with his eldest brother.\\" Obituary in The Gentleman's Magazine References External links * Hymns * The first World Anti-Slavery Convention, 1840 * Sonnets - The Seasons * Hymns * Oxford Dictionary of National Biography English Congregationalists 1789 births 1855 deaths English abolitionists Burials at Abney Park Cemetery English book editors Christian hymnwriters English hymnwriters Christian abolitionists ","title":"Josiah Conder (editor and author)"},{"id":"13251070","text":"Prie√ünitz is a village and a former municipality in the Burgenlandkreis district, in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.

An arborescence is thus the directed-graph form of a rooted tree, understood here as an undirected graph. Equivalently, an arborescence is a directed, rooted tree in which all edges point away from the root; a number of other equivalent characterizations exist. Every arborescence is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), but not every DAG is an arborescence. An arborescence can equivalently be defined as a rooted digraph in which the path from the root to any other vertex is unique. Definition The term arborescence comes from French. Some authors object to it on grounds that it is cumbersome to spell. There is a large number of synonyms for arborescence in graph theory, including directed rooted tree out-arborescence, out-tree, and even branching being used to denote the same concept. Rooted tree itself has been defined by some authors as a directed graph. =Further Definitions= Furthermore, some authors define an arborescence to be a spanning directed tree of a given digraph. The same can be said about some of its synonyms, especially branching. Other authors use branching to denote a forest of arborescences, with the latter notion defined in broader sense given at beginning of this article, but a variation with both notions of the spanning flavor is also encountered. It's also possible to define a useful notion by reversing all the arcs of an arborescence, i.e. making them all point to the root rather than away from it. Such digraphs are also designated by a variety of terms such as in-tree or anti-arborescence etc. W. T. Tutte distinguishes between the two cases by using the phrases arborescence diverging from [some root] and arborescence converging to [some root]. The number of rooted trees (or arborescences) with n nodes is given by the sequence: : 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 48, 115, 286, 719, 1842, 4766, 12486, ... .

It is used for accelerating ions in a cyclotron, and for measuring the masses of an ionized analyte in mass spectrometry, particularly with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometers. It can also be used to follow the kinetics of chemical reactions in a dilute gas mixture, provided these involve charged species. Definition of the resonant frequency An ion in a static and uniform magnetic field will move in a circle due to the Lorentz force. The angular frequency of this cyclotron motion for a given magnetic field strength B is given by :\\\\omega = 2\\\\pi f = \\\\frac{zeB}{m}, where z is the number of positive or negative charges of the ion, e is the elementary charge and m is the mass of the ion.In SI units, the elementary charge e has the value 1.602√ó10‚àí19 C, the mass of the ion m is often given in unified atomic mass unit or dalton: 1u = 1Da ‚âà 1.660539040(20) √ó10‚àí27kg, the magnetic field B is measured in teslas, and the angular frequency œâ is measured in radians per second. An electric excitation signal having a frequency f will therefore resonate with ions having a mass-to-charge ratio m/z given by :\\\\frac{m}{z} = \\\\frac{eB}{2\\\\pi f}. The circular motion may be superimposed with a uniform axial motion, resulting in a helix, or with a uniform motion perpendicular to the field (e.g., in the presence of an electrical or gravitational field) resulting in a cycloid.  Ion cyclotron resonance heating  Ion cyclotron resonance heating (or ICRH) is a technique in which electromagnetic waves with frequencies corresponding to the ion cyclotron frequency is used to heat up a plasma. The ions in the plasma absorb the electromagnetic radiation and as a result of this, increase in kinetic energy. This technique is commonly used in the heating of tokamak plasmas. = In the solar wind = On March 8, 2013, NASA released an article according to which ion cyclotron waves were identified by its solar probe spacecraft called WIND as the main cause for the heating of the solar wind as it rises from the sun's surface. Before this discovery, it was unclear why the solar wind particles would heat up instead of cool down, when speeding away from the sun's surface.

The double span Burr Arch covered bridge structure was built by Joseph J. Daniels in 1910. This is the third bridge at this location. Note: This includes , Site map, and Accompanying photographs. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History When the 1865 J. J. Daniels Roseville Covered Bridge was destroyed by fire in 1910 the Parke County Commissioners thought that the bridge should be replaced with a concrete bridge. However, the bids must have come back prohibitively high because the bridge was replaced with the current covered bridge. This would later seem to be a good choice when the downstream Armiesburg Covered Bridge, that was replaced with a concrete bridge in 1917, would later collapse in 1930 after only 13 years while the Roseville Covered Bridge still stands. Jefferson P. Van Fossen won the bid the replace the bridge. J. P. Van Fossen, together with his brother J. L. Van Fossen, were both being associated with the county road department and involved in constructing at least four Parke County covered bridges and foundations. J. P. also won the bid to construct the Jessup Covered Bridge in 1910. While witnesses from the construction site claim that the on-site foreman was J. J. Daniels, who would have been 84 years old at the time, a photograph of the nearly completed bridge shows the bridge portal lettering crediting J. P. Van Fossen as the Contractor and J. Brooks as the Builder. However, the on-site witnesses also claim to not remember Mr. Brooks and later portal lettering photographs show J. J. Daniels listed as builder, the bridge painted white and the portal opening are the trademark \\"Daniels Arches.\\" There may be other clues as to who the builder was but some of these just bring up more questions. The first would be that through the years in photographs and postcards the bridge portals have been repainted many times, at times red, brown, white, or even knocked away. This may very well explain the reason why the portals have transitioned into \\"Daniels Arches.\\" The fact that the engraved sign boards were mounted too low caused them to be damaged and so the arches were flattened to their present shape. However, there is a picture of the first stone for the abutment loaded on a horse-drawn wagon. The Van Fossens tended to use poured concrete on their bridges while Daniels favored stone abutments.

The group was dedicated solely to creating production vehicles, and not basic engineering research. \\"ENVI\\" was derived from \\"ENvironment\\" and \\"New Vehicles.\\" Chrysler's new owner Fiat SpA disbanded the division in November 2009, removed the three ENVI models from its 5-year plan for Chrysler, and Chrysler announced Lou Rhodes will become the group line executive in charge of electric car development for both Fiat and Chrysler.

Coat of Arms  Blazon: \\"In silver a green lily in the gate opening of a continuous, black-grooved red wall abutting at the top on a curved green shield base covered with a curved silver strip.\\" The coat of arms symbols are based on several local features. The high stone archways are ones that often belong to the homesteads, which are symbolized in the coat of arms by a jointed wall. In the gate opening is the heraldic lily - not as a symbol of purity and innocence, as is often the case - but rather in real terms related to the wild orchids that are common in the region around Gro√üesnitz. The fact that Gro√üesnitz and its district of towns are located on a mountain is indicated by the arched green shield base covered with a curved silver bar. The coat of arms was designed in 2006 by the municipal heraldist J√∂rg Mantzsch and he was included in the approval process. The representing colors of the area are green and white.

Although the cause of the fire has been contested, the mayor of Huwara claimed masked men from nearby Yitzhar and surrounding settlements set the fire by pouring incendiary fluids on the trees and that the Israeli occupation forces prevented Palestinian citizens from reaching the lands in order to extinguish the fire. Later on, the Israeli forces allowed the civil defence from the adjacent Palestinian village of Burin to extinguish the fire, but only after it had expanded to an even larger area . The burning and damaging of olive trees is an ongoing-concern of the United Nations, a pattern the New York Times call \\"price tag\\" attacks. The United Nations has reported that by 2013 \\"...Israeli settlers damaged or destroyed nearly 11,000 olive trees owned by the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.\\" North of Huwara, was the Huwwara Checkpoint, one of the Israeli checkpoints around Nablus, dismantled in 2011 in order to ease traffic between Nablus and Ramallah. Its location on the main road, used by both Israelis from four Israeli settlements in the Nablus area and Palestinians from the Nablus area, is a controlling factor of the life in Huwara. The town has many businesses located on the road, which is controlled by the Israeli army to ensure free passage to Jews and Arabs. Protests and attacks On May 18, 2017, an Israeli settler from Itamar driving through Huwara was attacked by stone throwers. The settler used his firearm, killing one and wounding another.Video: Palestinians Surrounded Settler‚Äôs Car Before He Opened Fire, Yotam Berger, May 18, 2017, Haaretz References Bibliography     * (Saulcy, 1854, vol 1, p. 102) * External links *Welcome To Huwwara * Huwara, Welcome to Palestine *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 14: IAA, Wikimedia commons *Howwarah Municipality *Huwwara Town Profile, Applied Research Institute‚ÄìJerusalem (ARIJ) *Huwwara, aerial photo, ARIJ Towns in the West Bank Nablus Governorate 2010 in the Palestinian territories 2011 in the Palestinian territories 2013 in the State of Palestine 2014 in the State of Palestine Municipalities of the State of Palestine ","title":"Huwara"},{"id":"13251459","text":"James Donald Farrar (5 October 1923 - 26 July 1944) was an English poet. Biography Farrar was born on 5 October 1923 in London, the second son of Donald Frederic Farrar (1897‚Äì1982), a former Royal Flying Corps supply pilot, and Mabel Margaret Farrar, n√©e Hadgraft (1896‚Äì1985). He lived in Carshalton, a small village in Surrey, England. He attended the local grammar school, Sutton Grammar School, before working in London. He was the younger brother of the aeronautical engineer David J. Farrar - references to David appear throughout his published writings - and first cousin of Stewart Farrar. As Farrar had volunteered for the RAF, he was called up in February, 1942 and received his commission as Pilot Officer the following year, serving as a flight navigator of a de Havilland Mosquito with 68 Squadron. On the night of 25‚Äì26 July 1944, Farrar and his pilot Flight Lieutenant Frederick John Kemp, on an anti-diver patrol over the Thames Estuary, attempted to intercept a V-1 flying bomb over the Thames River. The aircraft was destroyed during this action, killing Kemp and Farrar in the process. Farrar's body has not been recovered. Literary achievements James Farrar's collection of poetry and prose was published in 1950 in an anthology entitled, \\"The Unreturning Spring\\", edited by Henry Williamson. An abridged version, \\"Spring Returning\\" edited by Christopher Palmer, was published in 1986. Seven poems from \\"The Unreturning Spring\\" were set to music in 1965 by Trevor Hold as a song cycle for soprano, baritone and chamber orchestra. His life has also been documented by Alwyn Trubshaw, Farrar's former English teacher from Sutton Grammar School. Trubshaw has been quoted as saying, \\"I say taught English, but it would be truer to say I taught English in his presence only. He had no need of my teaching. He was a natural born writer.\\"Lost genius rediscovered in the suburb he immortalised , Your Local Guardian, 29 November 2007 More recently, the Autumn of 2008 heralded a resurgence of interest in James Farrar, with a public performance of his writings taking place at The Charles Cryer Theatre, in Surrey; and re- publication of \\"The Unreturning Spring\\".

Geography  Karsdorf is located between Nebra (Unstrut) and Burgscheidungen on the Unstrut. In Steigra branches off in southwest direction a side road from the state road 180, which leads to Karsdorf. Districts of the municipality are Karsdorf, Wetzendorf and Wennungen.  History  = Karsdorf remains = Recently, Karsdorf became known for its genetic testimonies. Haak et al. published an older, male individual \\"KAR6a, dated with 5207 to 5070 BC into the Early-Neolithic Linear Pottery, having the Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup H1 and the Y-haplogroup T1a. The other, female individuum was dated with 2564-2475 cal.

Nature 522, 207‚Äì211 (11 June 2015) doi:10.1038/nature14317Human skeleton, Germany I0550 = Post- Christian settlements = Evangelical Church of St. Lawrence in Karsdorf. Saint Lawrence, the patron saint of the Karsdorf village church, and St. Martin of Tours for the church of the defunct village B√ºnisdorf (also Pinsdorf ) stand for this early origin. Karsdorf is first mentioned as a tithing place Coriledorpf in the Hersfeld Abbey tithing document dating from between 881 and 899. Founded as a Franconian foundation on the old Franconia, Wein- or Kupferstra√üe Karsdorf is mentioned in 1109 as Karlestorph in a document. The name \\"Karlestorph\\" has nothing to do with the karst, which is shown in the seal, but rather is to be understood as \\"village of a Karl\\", the well-known Frankish name. The seal of the place, however, clearly refers to the local wine, which was already widespread among the Franks and in the 12th century first documented. It was built directly on the ford by the Unstrut, to whose protection soon a castle was built on the high ridge, which was initially owned by the Counts of Mansfeld, then passed to the Noble Lords of Querfurt and their legacy after extinction in The second half of the 15th century fell largely to the House of Wettin. The research also starts from a second castle site. Decisive for the establishment of the town and its further development was the location on the Unstrut and the Unstrutfurt, which existed only a few meters from the present Karsdorfer bridge. This ford crossed the Kupferstrasse, that old traffic artery that was a continuation of the K√∂nigsstrasse. The large copper transports went from Mansfeld to Eisleben to Nuremberg and further south. In Karsdorf had the family of Rockhausen, gentlemen on Kirchscheidungen from 1428 to 1608 held a noble court. At least since 1469 had Duke William III. Karsdorf as Amtsdorf completely integrated into the office Freyburg. The town was the seat of a separate district court chair with special judges and jury members. Here court was held and representatives of the associated villages summoned. 1589 lived 61 landlords in the village, including 20 Ansp√§nner and 41 Hinters√§ttler. After the devastating fire of 1608, which fell victim to 117 houses \\"including the beautiful, newly built church, parish, school, mill, brewery, bakery and Keltern\\", those of Rockhausen gave up their goods lying there. On April 29, 1823, a fire fired by a murder burner devastated 16 houses in the village and numerous cattle. By desolate villages in the area, the village center of Karsdorf was substantially enlarged, these include Siegerstedt (881/899: Sigiristat, 1589: Seigerstett ), B√ºnsdorf ( Bunisdorp, 1589: Bun√üdorf ) and W√∂lbitz ( W√ºlbiz, 1589: Welfitz ). Even the church is in the core of late Gothic, but the present form received it after the reconstruction in 1701 and in the 19th century. The baroque cart above the tower clock has the year of construction 1701 inscribed. The bell in the tower dates from 1666 and was made in the workshop of the Magdeburg foundry Jakob Wenzel. In 1767, Robert Schumann's mother was baptized in the church, a plaque on the church commemorates it. In 1815 Karsdorf arrived at the district of Querfurt in the administrative district of Merseburg in the Prussian province of Saxony . At GDR time the place belonged to the circle Nebra . = Karsdorf cement works = 1927 was founded in the Karsdorf cement works. A location advantage was the presence of limestone and various clay minerals at Karsdof. During the Second World War, many women and men from German-occupied countries had to do forced labor in the cement factory, many of whom died. The great demand for cement in the GDR led to the plant deactivating its environmental technology, which would have made production more expensive or slower. The result was a pollution of the environment with cement dust and ashes from the firing system. With the takeover of the work by Lafarge Group in 1990, the plant became one of the most modern and efficient plants of the Lafarge Group until the year 2000.  Economy  = Industry = Karsdorf cement plant. Main employer of the municipality is the cement plant Karsdorf, which belongs to OPTERRA GmbH. Today, about 200 people work in the cement plant, which produces for the national, but also international market. The cement industry, which originated in Karsdorf in 1928, is still influential in this town today. This development was strongly influenced by the many natural deposits of limestone, clay and sand. = Tourism = The Unstrut cycle path leads through the village. A canoe and bicycle station also offers water walkers the necessary infrastructure. Through the Unstruttal bridge, the nearby castle in Burgscheidungen and the Nebra sky disk, tourists are increasingly driving through the town.

He was inspired by the way that snowboarding is preferred to skiing due to the greater artistic potential, and decided to design a snowboard equivalent for the conventional bicycle. The result: a bike ridden sideways with the rider operating both wheels. The bike, unlike a conventional bike, uses front-to-back balance like a snowboard. Conventional bikes use left-to-right balance, like skis. The bike is aimed the youth market and has won a number of invention awards.  Bicycle design  The sideways bike is different in many ways from a conventional diamond-framed bicycle. The rider controls direction by steering with both front and back handlebars. This means that the bicycle can maneuver effectively in congested conditions, weaving in and out of cars and performing tight turns. It also means that the rider can move the bike sideways, as the name suggests, such that the movement is perpendicular to the direction in which the frame points. Although this is possible, it is very difficult, as it is necessary for the rider to have extremely good balance and coordination. The position of the pedals and cranks varies from bike to bike. Some sideways bicycles have them positioned in the same way that a normal bike does; however, there are some that are placed such that the rider must sit not facing in the direction of movement but perpendicular to it. This means that turning is easier and more elegant; however, visibility is impaired as the rider must turn his or her neck all the time. Sideways bikes are single speed, which means that gears have not yet been worked into the complex design of transmission of power from the cranks to the back wheel. Since it pivots, a normal chain system cannot function, but Killian created a part that allows the rear cassette to cause the wheel to rotate even when turning, by having an intermediate piece that can transmit the power. Rather than using a normal saddle for a bike, the sideways bike uses a unicycle saddle to aid balance. The sizes of the wheels vary considerably between different sideways bikes in order for each bike to be adapted to its purposes correctly.  Advantages and disadvantages versus conventional bikes  =Advantages= * Due to the nature of its steering mechanism, the sideways bike has the potential for making turns with smaller radii than those of conventional front-wheel-steered bikes of the same wheelbase. =Disadvantages= * Overlean is a common error that new riders make, caused by leaning too far over when cornering. * Parts are highly specialized because of the low volume of such bikes produced. * Neck aches are a common complaint since riders must keep their heads turned in order to see the road ahead, and, because of the need to keep the legs aligned approximately with the cranks, cannot spread this rotation throughout their body as skateboarders and snowboarders can.

It was renamed for D'Amato in 2002 under a bill introduced by Representative Peter T. King which was supported in the Senate by Chuck Schumer, who had defeated D'Amato for re-election and succeeded him as senator. The renaming was controversial because D'Amato is still alive.

Description  Schleberoda is located north of the Unstrut. It was founded as a result of intensive land development by clearance in the High Middle Ages such as other villages with ‚Ä≥root‚Ä≥ (Roda) in the name (e.g. Albersroda, Baumersorda, Schnellroda, Ebersroda and Schleberoda). The closely bordering local nobles in the area separated their territories using stone landmarks, as is still visible at the historic edges of the nearby woods, authentic landmarks which have been unchanged since the High Middle Ages: The clearance work and founding of new villages ran southwards from the original parish of M√ºcheln and ended at the Neue G√∂hle forest, which belonged to the territory of the Landgraves of Thuringia and could therefore not be cleared. The forest Neue G√∂hle (Old Sorbian name gola = heath forest) has survived as a continuous, large forest complex. It was used for the production of pole wood in the context of winegrowing at a very early point in time, which is why it had been afforested in the form of coppice-with-standards. Stone landmarks, ditches, banks and paths are still visible at the historic edges of this woods separated the territories of the closely bordering local nobles in the area. Steinmeister vineyard  Today  Schleberoda has retained the structures and authentic form dating from the time of its foundation. It is an examples of the land development in the contact area between Germans and Slavs in the High Middle Ages. It has been able to retain its original ground plan as a radial round village dating from the High Middle Ages. Around the original village pond, serving for fire-fighting, and the bake house, replaced at the end of the 18th century, forward-gabled and side-gabled buildings are grouped, some made with packed loam, with high-quality portals dating from the 16th to 19th century. The position of the former gate to the compact village settlement is still identifiable today. Including the outer boundary of the official village area is not only identifiable by a circumferential path and has survived in its original form to the north-west in the shape of an impenetrable hedge. The Romanesque choir tower of the village church with coupled abat sons has survived.

Lobitzch also belonged to the old administrative district before it was annexed by Wei√üenfels. = Type of Settlement = Uichteritz has a settlement type known as Haufendorf. The village predominantly consists of one- and two-story houses which appear not to have been built in a particular planned way. Medium-sized courtyards, well-preserved half-timbered buildings as well as newly constructed one-and two-family houses dot the village.  History  Uichteritz may have come into existence at the time of the Migration Period in the 6th or 7th Century. It was primarily Sorbs who settled in this region as evidenced by archeological finds, as well as placenames with the ending \\"-itz\\". The first documented mention of the village (as Uchteritz) was in the register of a monastery in Wei√üenfels. ird (Original im Domstift zu Merseburg). Around 1300 the area was ruled by the Margrave of Mei√üen. Around this time the church in Uichteritz was constructed, now the oldest building in the village. At the back of the church there are sandstone pillars in which there are long troughs, so-call sword chutes. These were used by knights to dedicate their swords before going into battle. The Saale broke its banks in 1784 and flooded the village, collapsing 44 houses, sheds and stables.

Since 1 July 2009, it is part of the town Freyburg.  Geography  Zeuchfeld is located half-way between the cities of Halle and Weimar, near the town of Freyburg of which it is an administrative part. It is situated between forests, vineyards and fields in a shallow valley. This leads to occasional flooding. The hill in the south of the village is called \\"Naumburger Berg\\" (Hill of Naumburg) by the local people. Here, there has been a limestone quarry and cherry plantation.  History  The Via Regia or King's Highway, an ancient imperial road, ran through Zeuchfeld until a stone bridge was built in Bad K√∂sen (building 1368-1404). On 11 April 1945 the US 777th Tank Battalion part of 28th Infantry Division reached Zeuchfeld on their race eastward.  Education  There had been a school in the village until about 1950. The old half-timbered school building in the centre of the village is one of the largest buildings. Today students from Zeuchfeld commute to Freyburg for primary and secondary education and even further away for higher education.  Transport  The Bundesstra√üe 176 goes through the village. It leads eastward to Wei√üenfels where it joins up with the A9 Autobahn and westward to Freyburg. The village is approached by bus lines 630 and 634 operated by the public transport company PVG Burgenlandkreis mbH. They link it to the towns Freyburg and Laucha and most of the neighboring villages.  Civic life  There are two registered societies in the village the \\"Zeuchfelder Pfingsburschen e.V.\\", organising whitsun celebrations, and the \\"Heimat und Kulturverein Zeuchfeld e.V.\\" organising socializing in the village.  Economy  Only a few people work in agriculture today. Two vineyards operate in the village, this is because it is part of the Saale-Unstrut wine growing area. A few inhabitants work as farmers on the fields surrounding the village. Besides these traditional areas most people commute to the larger cities in the area for work. Although some small businesses operating from Zeuchfeld, most of them are self-employed: e.g. electrical engineering, floor tilting, GP's surgery, landscape conservancy.  Recreation  The public footpath \\"G√∂hleweg\\" (marked with a red cross) goes through the village. It begins in Freyburg at the Jahnplatz and runs through Sch√ºtzenstra√üe - Schlifterberg - Burgholzweg - S√ºhnekreuz - Alte G√∂hle - Zeuchfeld - Branderoda - Ebersroda - Neue G√∂hle - Galgenberg until it reaches the memorial in the northwest of Freyburg.

History From 1878, the railway route from Kolkata, then called Calcutta, to Siliguri was in two laps. The first lap was a 185 km journey along the Eastern Bengal State Railway from Calcutta Station (later renamed Sealdah) to Damookdeah Ghat on the southern bank of the Padma River, then across the river in a ferry and the second lap of the journey. A 336 km metre gauge line of the North Bengal Railway linked Saraghat on the northern bank of the Padma to Siliguri. It was during this period that Iswardi came up as a railway station. The Kolkata- Siliguri main line was converted to broad gauge in stages. The Shakole- Santahar section was converted in 1910‚Äì1914, when Hardinge Bridge was under construction. The Hardinge Bridge was opened in 1915. The Sara-Sirajganj line was constructed by the Sara-Sirajganj Railway Company in 1915‚Äì1916. Consequent to the construction of the long Bangabandhu Bridge in 1998, there was reassessment of the requirements of the railways. First, a long new dual gauge line was to be constructed from Joydebpur to Jamtoil, to connect the eastern part of the Bangladesh railway system to the western part. The problem of two different gauges in two different parts of the country was solved by introducing dual gauge. Second, a length of broad gauge track from Jamtoil to Parbatpur was to be converted to dual gauge.

Chicago Bar Association, 1999, 30. In 1907 the JCC merged with the Juvenile Protection League, an organization devoted to preventing juvenile delinquency, and renamed itself the Juvenile Protective Association.Juvenile Protective Association Papers, Folder 10, Juvenile Court Committee, University of Illinois at Chicago University Library, Department of Special Collections. From 1907 until the 1940s, JPA engaged in many studies examining such subjects as racism, child labor and exploitation, drug abuse and prostitution in Chicago and their effects on child development. Beginning in the 1940s under the leadership of Jessie F. Binford, JPA chose to concentrate on direct service and to help the most resistant clients with a strong outreach (home visiting) component.Ford, 35. When Lewis Penner became executive director of JPA in 1952, he reformed the organization by hiring social workers holding professional master's degrees and focusing more on research and casework over social reform.Anderson, Paul Gerard. \\"The Good To Be Done: A History of Juvenile Protective Association of Chicago, 1898-1976\\". (Ph.D. diss., University of Chicago, 1988), 447. In the 1960s, JPA participated with other child welfare agencies in establishing the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). In 1990, JPA made a strategic decision to focus on serving high-risk and vulnerable families with young children (age 0-5) to reduce the risk of maltreatment and provide help to vulnerable children early in life and maximize the impact of intervention on their developmental trajectory. = Mission = > As a social welfare agency, JPA's mission is to protect and to promote the > healthy development of children whose social and emotional well-being, or > whose physical safety is in jeopardy either because of neglect or abuse at > home or because of inimical interferences in the neighborhood and, when > necessary, to provide for the rehabilitation of families for such children.  Services and activities  Under the leadership of executive director Richard Calica, JPA offers psychological treatment to children and families with a history of abuse and neglect and to those at risk of falling into a cycle of abuse. The organization also offers consultation and training services to other public and private social service organizations, including the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS).

The single-span Burr Arch covered bridge structure was built by Joseph A. Britton in 1913. Note: This includes , Site map, and Accompanying photographs. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History On March 8, 1907 the 65th Indiana General Assembly approved funding to establish and fund a State Tuberculosis Hospital or Sanitorium. By 1908 the State had appropriated land east of Rockville for the use of the State Tuberculosis Hospital. The Sanitorium was soon up and running in 1910. Originally built on the property of the State Sanitorium, located a mile or so downstream () from its current site, for hauling coal to the Sanitorium. The Sanitorium used coal, mined only a couple of miles away near Nyesville, for both heat and for its powerplant. This coal would have been hauled to Rockville and then east across the Plank Road Bridge to the Sanitorium before the bridge being built. The Plank Road Bridge was washed out in the flood of 1913 and was replaced with the Howard Bridge, also built by Britton the same year. Being on private property after the State sold the Sanitorium the bridge fell into disrepair. On July 30, 2008 the $1.34 million project to move the bridge to the former site of the Adams Covered Bridge was started. The Adams Bridge had been located about a mile upstream and had been built in 1907 by J.P. Van Fossen. In 1969 the bridge was destroyed by a flood where it washed downstream and under the Sanitorium Bridge. During February 3‚Äì11, 1970, the Jessup Covered Bridge was moved to replace it. Again in 1989 flood waters would wash this bridge downstream and under the Sanitorium Bridge and over the U.S. 36 bridge. By December 29, 2008 the bridge was open to traffic even though some tasks, such as painting, had to wait until the following spring.

King Henry VI (1422‚Äì1461). Both titles, which were in the Baronetage of England, are now extinct. The Throckmortons, originally of Throckmorton near Pershore, Worcestershire, trace their history back to the 12th century. In 1409 Sir John de Throckmorton, Under-Treasurer of England, married Eleanor Spinney (or Spiney or Spinetti or de la Spine), daughter and heiress of Guy Spinney of Coughton, Warwickshire, where the senior branch of the family, which bore the junior baronetcy, became established.Maclean, Sir John (ed.)

Both branches were mostly determined Roman Catholics and members of the senior line were involved in or connected with pre-reformation plots and conspiracies including the Throckmorton Plot of 1583 and the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The senior Throckmorton Baronetcy, of Tortworth in the County of Gloucester, was created in the Baronetage of England on 29 June 1611 for William Throckmorton(d. 1628), of Coss Court, Tortworth, Gloucestershire, 6th in descent from John Throckmorton, younger son of Sir John Throckmorton, Under-Treasurer of England. The third Baronet sat as Member of Parliament for Gloucestershire and Wotton Basset.

Elizabeth Throckmorton was the wife of Sir Walter Raleigh. Although Royalist sympathisers during the Civil War the family was one of very few recusant families to survive the turbulent 16th and 17th centuries with their estates intact. The sixth Baronet assumed the additional surname of Courtenay in 1792 on inheriting the Courtenay estates of Molland, Devon, through his mother. However, none of his successors have used this surname. The eighth Baronet was Member of Parliament for Berkshire. The title became extinct on the death of the twelfth Baronet in 1994.

Set in a fictional 16th-century English village named Revel Grove, the festival is spread over . The second largest renaissance fair in the United States, it is open from the last weekend of August and runs for nine weekends.  History  In early 1970s, Minnesota lawyer Jules Smith Sr. (1930‚Äì2018) invested in Coluam's Minneapolis festival, which later become Texas Renaissance Festival. When Coluam's Minneapolis festival moved to Texas, Smith sold his shares and organized similar festival in Maryland, nearby Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia. The fair was first held for four weekends in 1977 and drew 17 thousand people to see performances by Penn and Teller and The Flying Karamazov Brothers among other. In 1985, the fair was moved to its current location in Crownsville and in 1986 Smith turned over the management of the fair to his son Jules Smith Jr. who still runs the festival with three siblings. The festival was originally an Elizabethan fair, but in 1989 switched to being focused on Henry VIII of England. King Henry is played by actor Fred Nelson, replacing Bill Huttel, after Huttel's death in 2001. On July 22, 2020, the Maryland Renaissance Festival announced that it would not operate in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fair Jousting at the Renaissance Festival The English Tudor village is of woods and fields. There are more than 130 craft shops and 42 food outlets. More than 1,300 participants populate the village, 400 work directly for the company, 700 for the other vendors and 200 as performers on stages or as characters throughout the village. The Maryland Renaissance Festival utilizes eight major theaters, four smaller stages in taverns, a children's area and a jousting tiltyard with seating for 3,000. The fair contains an elephant and camel that groups of fairgoers pay to ride. In 2014, Joan Jett, speaking on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, wrote a letter asking that the rides be cancelled because of exploitation and abuse associated with using animals in this fashion.

It was unusual because, unlike most other role-playing games of the time, it did not use dice to resolve actions or determine success. Contents Theatrix comes packaged as a 136-page softcover rule book, and also includes 11 loose-leaf cardstock sheets containing flowcharts for planning adventures and resolving plot points. It was designed and written by David Berkman, Travis Eneix, Andrew Finch, Anthony Gallela and Brett Hackett, with art by Aaron Long. Gameplay =Character generation= Each character has a number of numerically-rated attributes and skills, as well as non- numerically-rated personality traits, and unrated 'Descriptors'. =Plot Points= Descriptors can be a disadvantage, and when they have a negative effect on a character, the player earns Plot Points. Descriptors can also be used to advantage, but in order to do so, the player must spend Plot Points while invoking a specific Descriptor. =Actors and Directors= Theatrix applies cinematic concepts to role-playing: the players are \\"Actors\\" and the GM is the \\"Director\\". The Director attempts to frame adventures as if they were screenplays, with a pre-structured plot that consists of a number of agreed-upon acts, scenes, and \\"pinch-points\\". =Diceless play= Unlike other role-playing games that use dice to determine success or failure, in Theatrix, when the plot reaches a \\"pinch point\\", the referee has already decided if the Actors have done enough to succeed, so dice are not needed. (Dice are only used to resolve a situation in the rare event that the Director cannot decide if the Actors have succeeded or failed.) This was a relatively new concept at the time of its release. While the Actors cannot change the major structure of the plot, they can influence a scene by spending Plot Points, either to guarantee a success, or to change a plot point in their favor. The example used in the rule book is of a male character with the \\"Lady's Man\\" Descriptor who is about to be assaulted and robbed by a femme fatale; the player invokes the \\"Lady's Man\\" Descriptor and spends Plot Points in order to transform the scene from a mugging into a romantic liaison. =Distributed directing= The game encourages collaborative roleplaying, using what it calls \\"Distributed Directing\\": the players may introduce subplots, although the Director still remains responsible for overall direction of the main plot. Reception In the May 1995 edition of Dragon (Issue 217), Lester Smith approached the game skeptically, but admitted after play-testing that \\"This approach to role- playing may be unusual, but it works. The fact of the matter is, playing the game is fun.\\" He liked the tone of the writing, which he called \\"applaudable\\", and found the information and rules well-organized, with \\"a healthy number of clear examples.\\" Smith also liked that the book \\"teaches a remarkable amount about scripting stories as if they were dramas. That information alone makes the book a valuable resource for game masters.\\" He does warn prospective referees that getting a campaign started would take extra time because \\"the initial concepts are so unusual\\" and the referee has to create all of \\"the specifics of composing skill lists and definitions, attribute ranges, and so on.\\" Smith concluded by giving it a strong recommendations, saying, \\"I whole- heartedly recommend it as both an entertaining change from the vagaries of dice and an admirable training course in the creation of dramatic adventures. Were I were to teach a college course in role-playing, this game would be required reading.\\" Reviews *White Wolf Inphobia #57 (July, 1995) *Shadis #26 (April, 1996)  References   External links  * Review of Theatrix, by John Kim * Review of the Ironwood supplement by RPG.net Role- playing game systems Universal role-playing games Role- playing games introduced in 1993 ","title":"Theatrix (role-playing game)"},{"id":"13251875","text":"Thomas Milton Gatch (January 28, 1833 - April 23, 1913) was an American educator and politician in Oregon.

From the \\"One God\\" all other realities, including hierarchy, humanity and the material universe, are the result of a process of emanation.

God (as Life and Love) manifests in the 7 octaves of the created universe through individual Divine Identities. As embodied individuals, we are the outer expression of that God Self in form. It is our unique and immortal True Identity, yet always sharing in the Allness of the ONE GOD.

Saint Germain Press July 1937 > pages 9 - 17 Beliefs about Ascended Masters It is believed that Ascended Masters are individuals who were once embodied on Earth and learned the lessons of life in their incarnations. They gained mastery over the limitations of the matter planes, balanced at least 51% of negative karma, and fulfilled their Dharma (Divine Plan). An Ascended Master has become God-like and a source of unconditional Love to all life, and through the Ascension has united with his or her own God Self, the \\"I AM\\" Presence. It is claimed that they serve as the teachers of mankind from the realms of Spirit, and that all people will eventually attain their Ascension and move forward in spiritual evolution beyond this planet. According to these teachings, they remain attentive to the spiritual needs of humanity, and act to inspire and motivate its spiritual growth. In many traditions and organizations, they are considered part of the Spiritual Hierarchy for Earth, and members of the Great Brotherhood of Light, also known as the Great White Lodge or Great White Brotherhood.

All creation comes forth through These Individual Identities and is sustained by Them. According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, this Spiritual Hierarchy is a \\"Universal Chain\\" of Individualized God Free Beings fulfilling Attributes and Aspects of God's Infinite Selfhood. Included in this Cosmic Hierarchical scheme are Solar Logoi, Elohim, Sons and Daughters of God, Ascended Masters, Cosmic Beings, the Twelve Solar Hierarchies, Archangels, Angels, Beings of the Elements, and Twin Flames of the Alpha-Omega Polarity sponsoring Systems of Worlds and entire Galactic Systems. This Universal Order of Divine Self-Expression is the means whereby God in the Great Central Sun steps down [ spiritual energy from ] the Presence and Essence of His Universal Being / Consciousness in order that all Life in time and space might give and receive Unconditional Divine Love. One's placement on this \\"Ladder of Life\\" in the Spirit / Matter Universes is determined by one's level of Spiritual Attainment - measured by Awareness and Manifestation of balanced Love, Wisdom, and Power - as well as the embodying of other Divine Qualities.\\" Use of \\"I AM\\" in decrees, affirmations, and invocations A characteristic of students of the Ascended Master Teachings is the use of God's Creative Name - \\"I AM\\" - in the use of Decrees, Fiats, Adorations, and Affirmations to invoke and send forth the Light of God to Bless Life, to bring forth the Perfect Divine solution for every situation, and to fulfill the Divine Plan. It is believed to be a way of externalizing more Divine Light, Divine Love, and Divine Life into the lower planes of creation through the dynamic force of sound vibration as creative energy. The Magic Presence states: > \\"Only the Self-conscious Individual has ALL the Attributes and Creative > Power of the 'Mighty I AM Presence.' Only He can know who and what He is, > and express the Fullness of the Creative Power of God whenever He decrees, > by the use of the Words, 'I AM.' The outer human part of this activity is > what We call the personality. It is but the vehicle through which Perfection > should be expressed into the outer substance of the Universe. \\"Within the > 'Pure God-Flame' is a Breath that pulsates constantly. This \`Great Fire- > Breath' is a Rhythmic Outpouring of Divine Love, Its Three Attributes being > 'Love, Wisdom, and Power in action.' These pour out constantly, into the > 'Infinite Sea of Pure Electronic Light.' This Light is the Universal > Substance or Spirit, out of which all forms are composed. It is intelligent, > mark you, because It obeys law through the command of the Individual who > says, or is conscious of, 'I AM.' These Two Words are the Acknowledgment and > Release of the Power to Create and bring forth into outer existence, > whatever quality follows That Acknowledgment. For Intelligence to act there > must be Intelligence to be acted upon, and the Universal Substance, being > like a photographic film, takes the record of what-ever quality the > Individual imposes upon It through his thought, feeling, and spoken word. > The Words 'I AM' whether thought, felt, or spoken, release the Power of > Creation instantly. Make no mistake about this. Intelligence is Omnipresent, > and It is within the Electronic Light.\\" Violet Flame Use of the \\"Violet Flame of Divine Love\\" is considered to be the 7th Ray aspect of the Holy Spirit and the \\"Sacred Fire\\" that transmutes and consumes the \\"cause, effect, record, and memory\\" of sin or negative karma. Also called the \\"Flame of Transmutation\\", the \\"Flame of Mercy\\", the \\"Flame of Freedom\\", and the \\"Flame of Forgiveness\\". \\"Our God is a Consuming Fire\\" in Deuteronomy 4:24 (KJV) and Hebrews 12:29 (KJV) is believed to be refer to this \\"Sacred Fire of God\\". The \\"Violet Fire\\" is held to be a raising, transforming, purifying action of \\"Divine Love\\" from the \\"Heart of God\\" in the \\"Great Central Sun\\". It acts to transmute and consume human creation that is not worthy of becoming Immortal, and all negative karmic causes, effects, records, and memories, without the need to individually balance that karma face-to-face with each person back to the earliest beginning of one's individualized manifestation on this or any other world. Ascension The Ascension is believed to be the returning to complete \\"Oneness with God\\" - \\"raising the outer atomic structure of the physical, emotional, and mental bodies into the Electronic Structure of the I AM Consciousness\\", becoming an Ascended Master, eventually a Cosmic Being, and beyond. The Ascension into Immortality through reunion with the God Self requires the consuming of at least 51% of the records and memories of \\"negatively qualified karma\\" as well as: =Mastery of the matter planes= It is believed that the \\"Individualized Flames of Perfection\\", emanating as lifestreams taking physical embodiment, can develop further attributes that express a unique Identity, and attain the fullness of the use of Light. This is done by mastery over matter planes that have a slower vibratory action, thus requiring more energy and concentration to externalize form. This allows for the development of greater skills of creation and \\"Causal Body Momentums\\" of various \\"Divine Qualities\\". Physical embodiment gives each individual the opportunity to expand these attributes and faculties through matter substance, and to become a \\"master of energy\\" through thought and feeling. This allows for accomplishments and added power which one who does not ever embody on a planet does not possess. Thus an individual may expand the \\"Flame in the Heart\\", and expand the \\"Perfection of the Allness of God's Love\\" in the created universe, eventually becoming an Ascended Master and later a Cosmic Being. According to the Ascended Master Teachings, gaining \\"mastery over matter planes\\" means learning to consciously use 100% of one's Creative Power of thought, feeling, and spoken word to create greater perfection, joy, and love in the world, as opposed to using thoughts, feelings, and words to create greater limitations, bondage, and chaos in one's own experience and in the world at large through carelessness and lack of awareness of the extent of one's influence in the world. \\"Matter planes\\" refers to the differentiations of atomic and molecular structure in which evolution takes place, the lower planes (dimensions / wavelength frequency resonance) sometimes correlated with physical solids, liquids, and gases; the higher subplanes of the Physical Octave are sometimes referred to as \\"etheric\\" and are not normally perceivable by the physical senses. The emotional and mental octaves are also made up of electrons and atoms of feeling and thought substance and differentiated into levels of density and vibratory rate. > \\"To understand the above explanation concerning the electron and the > conscious control the individual has through his thought and feeling to > govern the atomic structure of his own body is to understand the One > Principle Governing form throughout Infinity. When man will make the effort > to prove this to himself or within his own atomic flesh body, he will then > proceed to Master Himself. When he has done that, all else in the Universe > is his willing co-worker to accomplish whatsoever he wills through Love.\\" =Fulfillment of the Divine Plan= > \\"Within the Life of every human being is the Power by which he can express > all that the Ascended Masters express every moment ‚Äî if he but chooses to do > so. All Life contains Will but only Self-Conscious Life is free to determine > upon its own course of expression. Hence, the individual has free choice to > express either in the human, limited body or the Super-Human, Divine Body. > He is the chooser of his own field of expression. He is the Self-determining > Creator. He has willed and chosen to live as Self-Conscious Life. . . . When > one individualizes within the Absolute, All-Pervading Life he chooses of his > own free will to become an intensified individual focus of Self-Conscious > Intelligence.

Threefold Flame The Threefold Flame of Life is the Immortal Flame within the Heart of the children of Light and Sons and Daughters of God, and is an actual extension of the Heart of the I AM Presence of each Lifestream in embodiment on Earth. The fall of man It is believed that since the \\"fall of man\\" during the time of the incarnation of the Fourth Root Race, imperfection, limitations and discord increasingly entered into our world. The memory body is considered to have become known as a \\"soul\\", and this temporary personality has taken on the sense of a self that is separated and not connected to God. It is believed that a \\"Dictation\\" from Maitreya further clarified this matter through the \\"Messenger\\", Geraldine Innocente, on September 27, 1954 when what occurred during the time of the \\"Fourth Root Race\\" was described: > \\"Curiosity, rebellion against holding true to the Divine Pattern and the use > of thought and feeling in creation of imperfection, began the building of > what you call the 'soul'. It is a consciousness apart from the full Purity > of God. The first thought a man had that was imperfect and impure, energized > by a secret feeling, was a cause and that, sent out into the atmosphere, > created an effect. Like a boomerang, the effect came back into the > consciousness and made a record. That record was the beginning of an > impression. Energy sent out in a certain manner returned to affect the > lifestream who had sent it forth and there began to be created a shadow > between the I AM Presence and the human consciousness. Endeavoring to > contact the Presence, the individual would find these 'tramp' thoughts and > feelings flowing through that line of contact until more and more imperfect > was the conscious use of them. Finally, those centers got completely away > from the control of the ego and acted independently.The Bridge to Freedom > Journal, February 1956 (Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation > 1989) Purported address from Maitreya on September 27, 1954 \\"through\\" > Geraldine Innocente Dictations Within The \\"I AM\\" Activity, contact and cooperation with the Ascended Masters became a central part of each member's life. Through the Ballards as \\"Messengers\\", the Ascended Masters were believed to have regularly communicated with the students of The \\"I AM\\" Activity. Those Addresses (known as \\"Dictations\\") were delivered before gatherings of members in Conclaves held throughout the United States of America, published in the monthly periodical, The Voice of The \\"I AM\\", and some were collected and reprinted in the books of The Saint Germain Series. In all, 3,834 Dictations from the Masters were received through Guy and Edna Ballard. Other \\"Ascended Master Activities\\" believed that the Ascended Masters, Cosmic Beings, Elohim, and Archangels continued to present a program for both individual development and spiritual transformation in the world.Partridge, Christopher ed.

Dawning Golden Age Students of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that this world is destined to again have a Golden Age, a \\"Heaven on Earth\\", that will be permanent, unlike previous Golden Ages millions of years ago. > \\"In your beloved America, in the not so far distant future, will come forth > a similar recognition of the Real Inner Self, and this her people will > express in high attainment.

(ACCU) is a denomination founded in 2006 based on The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ transcribed from the Akashic Records by Levi H. Dowling. The Aquarian Christine Church actively promotes Ascended Master Teachings and shares many beliefs in common with the I AM Movement, White Eagle Lodge and New Thought and Theosophical groups. The book \\"Initiations of the Aquarian Masters: The Theosophy of the Aquarian Gospel\\" by ACCU founder Rev. Dr. Jacob L.

Joseph Ketley (1802-1875) was a mid-nineteenth century Congregational missionary and abolitionist in Guyana, the former British colony of British Guiana which was known as Demerara and Essequibo at the time when his mission was established. The Dutch colonies of Berbice‚Äö Demerara and Essequibo were ceded to the British in 1814‚Äö and incorporated into a single colony in 1831. Guyana became independent in 1966. In the 1830s and 1840s Joseph Ketley worked towards the abolition of slavery and promoted Christian teaching amongst the African population and the native Indian tribes of the Essequibo River. He was a resident of George Town, Demerara. On 12 July 1840 he attended the Anti- Slavery Convention in London.The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840, Benjamin Robert Haydon, accessed 19 July 2008 In the early nineteenth century, missionary work in Demerara was fiercely opposed by many of the estate owners. They sought to prevent missionaries from advancing the education of slaves and native Indians. Gradually, however the mission schools were established to develop reading and writing skills. Lacking the support of estate owners, missionaries were often in a dangerous position. The earlier missionary, Rev. John Smith, died in prison under sentence of death whilst being held by the authorities following the famous 1823 slave uprising, which was one of the largest in the colonies (he was pastor of a slave congregation at Le Ressouvener, British Guiana, where he taught education to the African slaves on behalf of the London Missionary Society). Smith became known as the \\"Demerara Martyr\\" and his case, and news of the enormous size of the uprising and the brutal loss of African life, caused a great awakening in England, strengthening the abolitionist cause which eventually succeeded in British territories worldwide in 1838. The Rev. Joseph Ketley is buried at the Congregationalists' non-denominational garden cemetery: Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington, London.

The single span Burr Arch Truss covered bridge structure was built by Joseph A. Britton in 1912. Note: This includes , Site map, and Accompanying photographs. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History Around the area where the bridge is built was originally called Thorpe Ford, named after the family that owned much of the land near the ford. The building of the bridge at this location can be attributed to County Commissioner J.M. May. It seems that after his election to County Commissioner he was attempting to travel from Rosedale to Rockville. Obtaining a short cut that would bypass Coxville he set out for Rockville. After following the convoluted directions and getting lost several times he promised that a new bridge would be built. With the construction of the Thorpe Ford Covered Bridge the road became a major route from Terre Haute to Crawfordsville. It was nicknamed the \\"Ben Hur Highway\\" for General Lew Wallace who was a famous Crawfordsville resident and author of the famous novel Ben Hur. Many elephants and other circus animals crossed here on the way to winter camp in Peru, Indiana. In the 1930s the WPA paved the road with concrete but most traffic was diverted to U.S. Highway 41 after its construction in the 1920s. However, heavy agricultural traffic continued to use the road which in 1960 led to the bridge being condemned and bypassed in 1961.

The Star Mill Covered Bridge was the first and then the Harrison Covered Bridge replaced it but was damaged in 1876 prompting the West Union Covered Bridge to be built. The bridge was finished in September 1876. The road was originally part of the \\"Indiana State Highway\\", established with Legislature in 1827, which connected Fort Wayne with Terre Haute. Along with the Armiesburg Covered Bridge it hosted stage coach traffic to Lafayette. Not much is left of West Union today, only a handful of houses. Gone are the school, post office, and the railroad. The Wabash Erie Canal ran just west of town with a feeder canal running south of Sugar Creek and connecting to the west of the bridge. The Chicago & Eastern Illinois Railroad crossed Sugar Creek to the east of the bridge and past West Union on the west side. Little is left of evidence of the railroad or the canal today.

The current massive stone fortification, the second fort, was built between 1844 and 1871 at the Canada‚ÄìUS border of Lake Champlain at Island Point in the village of Rouses Point, New York. Background =\\"Fort Blunder\\"= Construction had begun on the first fort at this location, an octagonal structure with walls, in 1816 to protect against an attack from British Canada such as that which led to the Battle of Plattsburgh in 1814. In July 1817, President James Monroe visited the incomplete fortification and the adjacent military reservation known locally as \\"the commons\\". However, due to an earlier surveying error it was later found that this first fort was inadvertently built on the Canadian side of the border, resulting in its sometimes being better known as \\"Fort Blunder\\". When a new survey discovered that the 45th parallel was actually located some south, effectively placing the fort in Canada, all construction on this first fort stopped and the site was abandoned. Much of its material was scavenged by the locals for use in their own homes and public buildings. No evidence has come to light that this first fort was ever named, with most contemporary documents simply referring to it as the \\"works\\", \\"fortification\\", or \\"battery\\" at Rouse's Point. It is often mistakenly referred to as Fort Montgomery.Millard (2005) The site of the first fort was listed on the National Register of Historic Places under the name \\"Fort Montgomery\\" in 1977. =Fort Montgomery= It was ultimately decided that a second fort would be constructed on the site after the Webster‚ÄìAshburton Treaty of 1842 ceded strategically important Island Point, the site of the 1816 fort and the northernmost point on Lake Champlain, to the United States. Construction began on the new fortification two years later in 1844, dubbed Fort Montgomery, in honor of the Revolutionary War soldier Major general Richard Montgomery who was killed at Quebec City during the 1775 invasion of Canada.Shelton, Hal (1994). General Richard Montgomery and the American Revolution. New York: New York University Press. p154 Fort Montgomery was one of a very few \\"Permanent\\" or \\"Third System\\" forts built along the Northern Frontier, most being constructed along the Atlantic Coast. Work on the fort remained almost continuous through 1870, with the peak of construction taking a frenzied pace during the American Civil War, amidst rumors of possible British intervention against the Union from Canada. Possibly to assuage those concerns, a detachment of the 14th U.S. Infantry was actually garrisoned at the fort for three months in 1862. These fears were eventually proven to be not that far- fetched when the St. Albans Raid, the northernmost action of the Civil War, took place in nearby Vermont in 1864 involving a raid by 21 Confederate soldiers from Canada. Over the roughly 30-year period of Fort Montgomery's construction, no expense was spared and the work represented some of the most advanced and cutting edge military technology of the day. At peak points on the project, the labor force consisted of roughly 400 stonecutters and masons plying their trades at the site. When its basic structure was completed, the fortification boasted walls some high and gun emplacements for 125 cannon on three tiers. The fort was also one of only nine examples constructed in the United States to have a moat, another being Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas. This made Fort Montgomery essentially surrounded on all sides by water and accessible only by a retractable drawbridge from the land side. An interesting and innovative design feature in its own right, this drawbridge could be mechanically pivoted on a central balance point with one end raising to block the entrance and the other end dropping into a curved pit in the postern, or sally port, behind the doorway like a see-saw. Raising this bridge would effectively cut off the fort from any entrance by land as the bottom of the fort's doorway stood a full above the water of the moat or \\"wet ditch\\" below. A similar entrance from the lake side, known as a \\"water gate\\", also utilized a drawbridge which accessed a dock extending from the fort into the lake. Directly behind the fort itself, between it and the actual shoreline, a massive manmade island was constructed. Standing higher than the fort itself, this earthen berm was known as the \\"cover face\\" and protected the fort against an enemy on land being able to utilize heavy siege guns to reduce the walls. It was connected to the land by a narrow stone causeway and to the fort itself by a bridge. Also during the fort's later construction, Chief Engineer of the U.S. Army Joseph Totten invented an iron reinforced embrasure for cannon which would better protect the gunners inside a fort, an upgrade which was retrofitted into Fort Montgomery's design on its unfinished upper gun tier, while the lower, already completed level sported the older style brick embrasures. Totten was no stranger to the area and had served as a Major under Generals Izard and Macomb at the 1814 Battle of Plattsburgh where he had been in charge of laying out the American defensive fortifications and had later been brevetted to Lieutenant-Colonel for gallantry under fire. Initially designed to be manned by a force of 800 men, the fort was never fully garrisoned and mainly took on a role as a military deterrent along the border. Many of the Third System forts by design were never permanently garrisoned, ultimately intended to be waiting and ready for action only if needed. Contrary to local lore, however, although the fort never fired a shot in anger, this does not mean the fort was never armed. According to War Department records, in 1886 when Fort Montgomery was most heavily armed, it mounted 74 guns of its full 125 gun capacity, including and Rodman cannon. Most of these guns were mounted training northward towards Canada. Although never placed in position, two massive Rodmans were present at the site for years sitting on the parade ground waiting to be mounted atop the wall. In 1880, Commanding General of the Army William Tecumseh Sherman toured the fortification and was so impressed with the magnitude of the site, he returned to Washington and intended to have the military garrison at nearby Plattsburgh Barracks stationed instead at the fort. Due to the outcry of many prominent local citizens, however, the troop movement never took place. In the years following the Civil War, with the introduction of much more modern and powerful armaments such as explosive shells and rapid-firing rifled cannon, the military importance of masonry fortifications such as Fort Montgomery was rapidly drawing to a close. Technology now existed which could allow an enemy force to quickly and easily reduce their massive casemates and walls to piles of rubble. The last decade of the 19th century slowly saw the removal of the old fort's guns, now long obsolete. By 1900, 37 guns were still present and by 1901, that number had decreased to 20. Purportedly the last of the larger guns were removed and taken down the lake by barge around 1909. After being loaded onto railroad cars at Plattsburgh, many of the iron cannon met their end being melted down for their scrap value in Philadelphia. Following this period the now empty fort was watched over by a caretaker, usually a retired soldier who lived in a nearby house and patrolled the grounds. Disposal In 1926 the United States Government sold Fort Montgomery along with its adjacent Military Reservation at public auction. During the period of disuse which followed, as had also happened with the abandoned 1816 fortification, many locals visited the fort, carting off untold amounts of lumber, bricks, windows, and doors for use in their homes and other buildings. Ultimately most of the fort, aside from the gutted westward facing officer's quarters, a small portion of the southern wall and three bastions (two of which remain today), was demolished in 1936‚Äì1937. Its massive stones were crushed and dumped into the lake for fill to construct a nearby bridge between Rouses Point, New York and Alburg, Vermont. The property had a number of private owners before it was sold in 1983 to Victor Podd, Sr. who constructed the headquarters of the Powertex Corporation on the adjacent \\"Commons\\" to the west of the fort. Island Point, the actual fort site, was left untouched. During the mid-1980s Podd worked with local historical societies to have the State of New York purchase the property with a view toward possible restoration of the site. Despite being offered the fort at no cost, negotiations were unsuccessful and the State declined to accept the property. Since May 2006, Podds' heirs have attempted to sell the fort on eBay. The first auction ended on June 5, 2006, with a winning bid of $5,000,310. However, the sale was not completed, and the fort and lands surrounding it remain for sale. There are current concerns among local preservationists that what remains of the fort today is in danger of a catastrophic structural collapse. This is in part due to the removal of iron reinforcing rods, emplaced around 1886, which were likely cut out for their scrap value during the wartime scrap metal drives of World War II. These rods were originally devised to brace up and support the massive weight of the fort's detached outer wall face, a defensive element of the fort's construction which later proved over time to be a structural flaw. Previously a third remaining bastion on the northern side of the fort suffered a similar collapse and was completely destroyed in 1980, mostly falling into the moat. In September 2008, the Preservation League of New York State listed Fort Montgomery as one of their \\"Seven to Save\\" properties. This listing effectively recognized the historical significance of the Fort Montgomery ruins. It also identified the ruins as being in dire need of stabilization and preservation.Millard (2009) References Bibliography External links * Fort Montgomery (at Rouse's Point) history and tour, from America's Historic Lakes * Fort Montgomery: The old fort nobody wants * Current photos of Fort Montgomery Montgomery (Lake Champlain) Buildings and structures in Clinton County, New York Government buildings completed in 1844 Montgomery (Lake Champlain) 1844 establishments in New York (state) National Register of Historic Places in Clinton County, New York ","title":"Fort Montgomery (Lake Champlain)"},{"id":"13252378","text":"Dunham Castle is an early medieval castle in Dunham Massey, Greater Manchester, England (). History The castle is first referred to in 1173, in a document stating Hamo de Masci held the castles of Dunham and Ullerwood. Documentary evidence suggests the castle at Dunham was still standing in 1323. The castle fell into disuse between 1323 and 1362. It probably existed on a mound, or motte, near the site of where Dunham Massey Hall is today. The motte is in diameter and survives in height. The site was surrounded by a moat which was later turned into an ornamental lake. Dunham Castle has been confused with Watch Hill Castle in nearby Bowdon, but the two were separate castles, though both probably owned by de Masci. Dunham Castle was a Scheduled Ancient Monument, but was delisted.

Broadcasting at 1150 AM, the station airs news/talk and sports formats, and identifies on air as AM 1150 News, Talk, Sports. It is owned by Bell Media. Current on-air talent include Phil Johnson, who hosts the AM 1150 Early Edition from 6-9am Monday to Friday, Morning News Anchor, Ted Farr, along with morning show producer Daniel O'Hara. Throughout the day, Tamie Williams, Regan Bartel, Brittany Webster read the news during the midday and afternoon newscasts. Regan Bartel, who started with CKFR in the fall of 2000, has been calling the play-by-play of the Kelowna Rockets on the radio station for 20 years. Syndicated programming includes Evan Solomon, Coast to Coast AM, and ESPN Radio, which airs from midnight to 6am seven days a week. Other than in mandated hourly pre-recorded station identifications and the title of the morning show, the callsign \\"CKFR\\" is not mentioned on air or in station branding and promos. The callsign was randomly assigned to replace the former CKBL callsign when the station switched from 1150 AM The Bullet's country music format to Oldies 1150's oldies music format in 2004. History The station originated as CKIQ-AM, first signing on the air on November 8, 1971. It was owned and operated by veteran broadcasters Walter Gray, who would later serve as three-term mayor of Kelowna, and Bob Hall through their company Four Seasons Radio. Four Seasons also owned several stations in Golden, Revelstoke and Salmon Arm. The licence, for an AM station operating on 1150 kHz with a day and night power of 1,000 watts, was awarded July 22 of the same year and beat out a competing application from J.B. Cooper. In the summer of 1972, the offices of CKIQ were destroyed by fire. By the next day, the station was back on the air, reportedly operating out of several motel rooms in the area. Warehouse space in the area was found for CKIQ to operate out of for six months while the fire-ravaged building was rebuilt on the original property. The following year, in December 1973, CKIQ's daytime power was increased to 10,000 watts while nighttime power remained at 1,000 power. Nighttime power is often lower because of changes in the planet's ionosphere that allow a station to be broadcast farther and more clearly at low power. However, in 1981, CKIQ's nighttime power increased from 1,000 to 10,000 watts as well. In 1982, CKIQ's coverage area expanded with the granting by the Canadian Radio- television Telecommunications Commission for an FM rebroadcaster at Big White Ski Village on Big White mountain. It was known unofficially as CKIQ FM, though that was never advertised on air, when the rebroadcaster launched in 1983. In 1995, Four Seasons Radio launched CKBL-FM after receiving approval for an FM licence in the Kelowna radio market. That station was branded as 99.9 The Bullet and broadcast a country music format. A company called Okanagan Skeena Radio Group acquired the remaining 73.2% of a personal holding company, West Global Broadcast Holding that it didn't already own from Walter Gray, Bob Hall, and other shareholders. West Global, in turned, owned the operating company for CKIQ and CKBL, Four Seasons Radio. Following this transaction, Okanagan Skeena Radio Group became the new sole owner of these radio stations, as well as stations in Golden, Revelstoke, Salmon Arm and its southern interior stations. 1997 saw major changes to the two sister stations in the Kelowna radio market. CKBL-FM became CHSU-FM, changing its branding to 99.9 Sun FM and its music format to hot adult contemporary. Simultaneously, CKIQ-AM's call letters became CKBL-AM and its format switched from its twenty- six-year-old news/talk format to a country music format and the station was now branded as 1150 AM The Bullet. This all required, and received, approval of the Canadian Radio-television Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and Industry Canada for the flipping of CKBL from the FM to the AM band and the various callsign changes. Several things happened in 1999. CKBL-AM's CKBL-FM-1 rebroadcaster at Big White Ski Village (98.1 MHz with ERP of 18 watts) ceased to be a rebroadcaster for CKBL-AM. It was now a rebroadcaster for CHSU-FM. Telemedia purchased Okanagan Skeena Group. Finally, on October 28 of the same year, Okanagan Skeena Radio Group's application to convert CKBL to the FM band was denied by the CRTC.Decision CRTC 99-481 The application was submitted by Okanagan Skeena before Telemedia's buyout Okanagan Skeena Radio Group was finalized. In 2002, Standard Radio acquired Telemedia's radio and northern BC TV station assets. Telemedia's printed periodical business were largely acquired by Transcontinental Media at the same time. By buying Telemedia's radio and TV stations, Standard became the largest privately owned radio station owner and operator in Canada. On August 1, 2003, CKBL switched from country music to an oldies format and its branding was also changed to Oldies 1150. In May 2004, its call letters were changed as well to its current callsign of CKFR. KFR Kelowna was added to the Oldies 1150 logo and the station was given a slogan as well, calling itself \\"The Greatest Music on Earth\\". (As of November 1, 2007, CKBL are the call letters of an FM station in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.) On August 29, 2007, CKFR-AM switched to its current format of news/talk and sports radio, branding itself as AM 1150 News, Talk, Sports when cross-town competitor CKOV switched to the FM dial and began offering a country music format as B-103 \\"Kelowna's Best Country\\" on August 17. For two weeks, Kelowna was without a news/talk radio station. In October 2007, Astral Media acquired Standard Broadcasting's terrestrial radio and television assets, including CKFR.
