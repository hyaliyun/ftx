It is the second largest student-run organization and one of the largest cultural organizations on the school's campus. The organization was created on November 7, 1967 to combat problems of black recruit, admissions, and integration on UNC-CH campus. Black Student Movement has created many subgroups and committees such as: Opeyo! Dance Company, Celebration of Black Womanhood (CBW), Emphasizing Brotherhood Across Campus Effectively (EmBrACE), Harmonyx A Capella, UNC Gospel Choir, Ebony Reader's Onyx Theatre (EROT), Black Ink and the Political Action Committee (PAC) to name a few.  History  The Black Student Movement was established on November 7, 1967 as a result Black student dissatisfaction with the NAACP chapter on the campus and because of the slow enrollment of the black population on campus. In 1961 the NAACP chapter had been formed and had actively protested against segregation and discrimination, but by 1967 more militant students led by Preston Dobbins and Reggie Hawkins felt that the NAACP was overly conservative. They voted to disband the chapter and instead form the Black Student Movement. The NAACP's magazine, The Crisis, reported that the chapter president, Kelly Alexander Jr., opposed demands for separate facilities for black students, arguing against \\"any attempt to re-establish institutionalized segregation\\". The state NAACP leadership intervened and the two organizations then co-existed. Although the organization had white sympathizers, it was all-black. The Black Student Movement was officially recognized by the UNC administration in December 1967. In the fall of 1967, UNC reported 113 African American Students enrolled out of 13,352. The Black Student Movement began taking form as the dominant organization who voiced the views and opinions of black students at the university. The ensuing year was momentous black students on the campus because it was within this time frame that the Dixon Resolution and the Phipps Committee were established. The Dixon Resolution, written by Professor John Dixon on May 3, 1968, requested that the Chancellor appoint a five-person committee to generate recommendations for the faculty to help improve the academic climate among Black students. It was the Phillips Committee, led by Professor Dickson Phillips, that recommended an eight-step plan to improve the intellectual climate and remove educational disabilities on the basis of the race of Black students on campus and those to come. On December 11, 1968, the Black Student Movement presented a list of 23 demands to J. Carlyle Sitterson (chancellor at the time) for improvements that they needed to see implemented, including better treatment of the campus workforce and more opportunity and representation at the University for African American students and members of the Chapel Hill community. The demands included the founding of an African-American Studies department at the University, an office titled, \\"Dean of Black Students\\" that would be responsive to black students' needs, and the University‚Äôs partnership with the local black community. On January 24, 1969, six weeks after being presented with the demands and during final exam periods, Sitterson issued a nineteen- page written reply, demonstrating his intent \\"to be responsive to the educational needs of...all races, colors and creeds\\" while also asserting that the University cannot, in policy or practice, provide unique treatment for any single race, color or creed\\", but promised open discussion and the establishment of a faculty-student committee based on minorities and the disadvantaged. Within the following weeks, BSM gained support from students and faculty through the Southern Student Organizing Committee (SSOC), the UNC Graduate Student Association, the Daily Tar Heel, and the New University Conference. Students and faculty alike felt as though the Chancellor's response was dismissive and organized sit-ins. UNC faculty members organized a petition supporting the BSM. The SSOC organized a protest through the university, the town, and South Building in support of the BSM‚Äôs demands on February 7, 1969. The Chapel Hill community became nervous, given the student takeover of Allen administrative building at Duke University on February 13, 1969, which led to conflicts with students and the police who fired tear gas to control the crowd. The BSM held a rally on February 8 to discuss Chancellor Sitterson‚Äôs responses to their demands. Athletes Charlie Scott, the first black basketball player at the university, and Bill Chamberlain attended this rally and publicly supported the BSM. =BSM and Food-workers= A partnership between black students and food-workers began in December 1968, after the BSM presented their demands. Amongst these demands was the urging of the University to \\"begin working immediately to alleviate the intolerable working conditions of the Black non-academic employees\\". The food-workers wanted to address the low wages, lack of holding supervisors accountable, and some sexual harassment claims. They believed that their ‚Äúsupervisors who worked for the University were engaging in unfair labor practices.‚Äù Provoked by Sitterson's response to their demands, BSM met with food-workers to address employee grievances. With encouragement from BSM core members, Preston Dobbins, Reggie Hawkins, Jack McLean and Eric Clay, the food-workers remained determined to be taken seriously by administration. After a conflict with workers and a supervisor, the workers met with the BSM to plan a protest that Sunday. On February 23, 1969, food-workers came to work and set up their counters. When the doors were opened, workers walked out and sat down at cafeteria tables. BSM recruited about 400 students to stand in line and bang their trays on the counters. The following morning, nearly 100 dining hall employees refused to report to work, forcing 3 of the 4 dining facilities to close for the day. The protest would continue to last for almost a month marking UNC's first serious labor dispute. The protest was supported by the BSM, students (high school and college), faculty, community members, even people from other schools. Upset with the lack of response from administration, particularly the Chancellor, on Monday, March 3, 1969 the BSM partnering with Southern Students Organizing Committee changed their tactics, taking a more authoritative stance entering Lenoir and slowing down service to students. Their actions tried to force administration to deal with the issue. During the protest, the BSM, SSOC, and other students ran through Lenoir flipping tables, which forced police with riot gear to intervene. As a result, the administration closed Lenoir. In a meeting with Governor Robert W. Scott, Chancellor Sitterson and UNC System President William C. Friday argued to keep Lenoir Hall closed until Thursday lunch and downplayed the need to bring in the Highway Patrol to maintain order. As Sitterson prepared to announce his plan for reopening Lenoir, Governor Scott declared that four National Guard units were standing by in Durham, and that five squads of riot-trained Highway Patrol were being sent to Chapel Hill to ensure that Lenoir would open for breakfast on Thursday, March 6. Many UNC students, white and black, and faculty were mobilized by the table-turning incident and the Governor's response. The SSOC, the National Student Association Southern Area Conference, and representatives from Student Government attempted to act as mediators between the black students and food-workers on one side and the University administration and North Carolina General Assembly on the other. Though the Faculty Council resolved to support the University administration, some faculty members signed petitions calling on Sitterson to recognize the validity of the BSM's demands and to increase wages and opportunities for promotion for campus non-academic workers. During the protest, the BSM and food-workers occupied Manning Hall, the former law school building. Workers created the ‚ÄúSoul Food Cafeteria‚Äù as a way to earn money and support the community. The BSM gave the food in exchange for donations from those who participated in the ‚ÄúSoul Food Cafeteria.‚Äù They were able to raise $35 per worker per week with this system. On 13 March, the Governor directed Chapel Hill police to arrest BSM members who refused to leave Manning Hall, which was then otherwise unused. Those arrested retained Charlotte attorneys Julius Chambers and Adam Stein to represent them.Ultimately, the UNC Non-Academic Employees Union was formed and its requests were prioritized: a minimum wage of $1.80 per hour, the appointment of a black supervisor, and time-and-a-half for overtime work. The strike came to an end on March 21, 1969, ‚Äúwhen Gov. Scott agreed to pass legislation that would raise not only the Lenoir workers‚Äô wages to $1.80 an hour, but also the wages of all other minimum wage workers across the state.‚Äù =Uprisings and strikes= During 1968, the Movement staged several protest marches following the Orangeburg Massacre and the assassination of Martin Luther King that featured the burning of an effigy of Governor Robert McNair and the Confederate flag, followed by a one-day strike with 95% adherence from black workers. In March of 1969 along with the Southern Student Organizing Committee (SSOC), picketed alongside workers and boycotted the dining halls in solidarity. Faculty picketed as well, carrying signs that said \\"Faculty Supports Lenoir Workers\\". During the second strike, in November and December 1969, students from Black Student Movement chapters across the state planned to convene in Chapel Hill for \\"Black Monday\\" for a rally in support of the strikers. The police attacked a group of demonstrators from the Black Student Movement who allegedly refused to disperse from their picket lines. Nine people were arrested, including two union organizers. Charges included failure to disperse and disorderly conduct. In November 1969, the BSM created the Black Ink newspaper as a counter to the Daily Tar Heel (DTH) student newspaper of the campus. The DTH was seen as a newspaper for white students. Therefore, Black Ink was created to represent the black community and black interests. In January 1965, the BSM protested against guest speaker David Duke, the founder of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. Almost 200 students heckled and shouted at him, forcing him off the stage. Algenon Marbley, BSM president at the time, ‚Äúwas summoned to Undergraduate Court for allegedly leading the protest but was acquitted.‚Äù In 1979, students were angry with the denying of tenure for Dr. Sonja Stone, the head of the African and Afro-American Studies department and BSM‚Äôs advisor. They held sit- ins and marched through South Building to protest the ‚Äúclosed-door‚Äù policy making. BSM further protested the minimal admittance of qualified African Americans into the university and that there was still not an office specific for minority concerns. Dr. Sonja Stone received tenure in the fall of 1980 and the Office of Minority Affairs was formed. In October 1990 a sculpture, The Student Body, was installed to be representative of the UNC student body. Many students felt that the depictions of the characters were unrealistic. The statue showed a black woman balancing books on her head, a white woman looking up a man, and a black man with a basketball. BSM organized a study-in, where students studied around the statue showing what the student body actually looks like. After the passing of Dr. Sonja Stone in 1991, the BSM protested to have a free standing academic building named after her to replace the Black Cultural Center. They gained support from students, faculty, student athletes, and Spike Lee. The building was approved in 1993 and was opened in 2004. On November 14, 1998, to commemorate the BSM's 30th anniversary, students rallied in support of the Housekeeper and Groundskeeper Struggle, and presented Chancellor Michael Hooker with a list of 22 new demands.History On March 28, 2012 BSM, along with other student organizations, marched down Franklin Street in hoodies, Skittles, and tea in hand in response to the murder of an unarmed Trayvon Martin. It was a silent march that was used to inform people of the case and honor his life. =BSM Evolves= The Black Student Movement, commonly referred to as BSM has the mission: \\"We, the members of the Black Student Movement, embrace a culture distinct from the dominant culture found at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In view of this fact, it is the goal of this organization to strive for the continued existence of the unity among all its members, to voice the concerns and grievances of its members to the University, to offer outlets for expressing Black ideals and culture, and finally, to insure that the Black Student Movement members never lose contact with the Black community\\". In November 1997, students on campus still felt as though their voices were not being heard. BSM presented Chancellor Michael Hooker with a list of concerns. The presentation coincided with BSM Awareness Day, remembering those who began the fight for equality thirty years earlier. On Friday afternoon, students presented readings, music and poetry to make the campus community aware of their cause. At the conclusion of their events, the students marched to the Officer of Chancellor Hooker and presented him with a list of demands. They presented 22 demands that were not different from the ones presented to Chancellor Sitterson in 1968, however there was an additional demand for a black cultural center on campus. One of the demands presented at the second round was a free-standing black cultural center. When professor Sonja Haynes Stone died of a stroke in 1991, BSM members voiced their dissatisfaction with the small black cultural center in the Student Union and pushed for a freestanding building dedicated to the late professor.But former Chancellor Paul Hardin said the center should be \\"a forum and not a fortress,\\" and the Black Cultural Center's suite in the Union was dedicated to Stone. After more than a decade of fundraising and rallying, BSM members were able to see the dedication of a freestanding Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History. In addition to advocating for the minority voice, in recent years, the BSM has made an effort to promote change and voter participation. In 2009, the political action committee of BSM presented \\"Vote and Vote Smart\\", to encourage political participation. The group presented the event in conjunction with the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the group United with the Northside Community Now. BSM also has focused the 2011 year on self-identity, hosting \\"Same by Race, Different by Name\\", a panel discussion on identity in the black community as well as an in-depth look at stereotypes about Africans and American Americans and their relationship with one another. BSM continues to encourage their subcommittee involvement from hosting Gospel Choir concerts, Harmonyx Acapella performances, and the BSM Ball, where they crown a Mr. and Ms. BSM. They also began partnership with other campus organizations to promote unity. BSM hosts ‚ÄúCulture on the Lawn‚Äù with Carolina For The Kids (CFTK) and the Homecoming Kickoff Powderpuff Game with Carolina Fever. The goal of unity allows for more cooperation and fluidity with ‚Äúblack issues.‚Äù For example, the Black Lives Matter movement gained support from many black students within BSM and outside of it. BSM supports the protests that occur on campus without having to lead the protests. The ‚ÄúWe Gon Be Alright Scholarship‚Äù was created by Miss BSM (2015-2016) Summer Holmes. The name of the scholarship comes from lyrics by Kendrick Lamar, which has become an anthem for the Black Lives Matter Movement. The mission of the scholarship is to award ‚Äúunderclassmen scholarship money based on their commitment to service and activism within and outside the Carolina community‚Äù and ‚Äúto highlight the valiant efforts of those who have enacted change for the betterment of their constituents during times of institutional injustices and the disenfranchisement of minority populations.‚Äù See also * Black Action Movement, University of Michigan  References  External links * *Black Student Movement on Carolina Story: A Virtual Museum of University History.

The Foundation is responsible for the European Road Assessment Program (EuroRAP) in the UK and Ireland. History The Foundation was created in 1986 as the AA Foundation for Road Safety Research by the AA, while it was still a member-owned institution. The charity became the Road Safety Foundation following the sale of the AA by Centrica to CVC and Permira. Aims Today the Foundation's aims are: * the carrying out of research into all factors of the safe use of roads by all classes of user * the promotion of advice and knowledge on the safe use of roads to all users * to develop ideas and programmes designed to improve road safety including projects to educate young children on the safe use of the road * to provide the transportation industry with access to a library of research materials, as well as policy documentations and relevant publications Governance The Foundation is governed by a Council of Management led by Lord Alf Dubs and includes representation from the Freight Transport Association, FIA Foundation for the Automobile and Society, and International Road Assessment Programme (IRAP). In addition to his role in the Foundation, Lord Dubs, previously a Labour Member of Parliament and Parliamentary Under- Secretary of State in the Northern Ireland Office, is an active member of the House of Lords. In January 2008 Lord Dubs spoke of his interest in Road Safety and the Foundation in a debate on road safety. Research The Foundation has a legacy of research going back to its inception in the mid-1980s. Research covers a wide range of road safety related subjects including the causes of accidents in young pedestrians, risk and safety in the older driver and a review of tyres and road surfaces. Since 2003 the work of the Foundation has focused on EuroRAP in the UK and in 2008 the Campaign for Safe Road Design. =EuroRAP in the UK= The Foundation is the Active Member and licence holder for the European Road Assessment Programme (EuroRAP) in Britain and Ireland. The Foundation regularly issues the list of safest and most dangerous roads in Britain and Ireland. In 2008 the Foundation released its latest results for Britain, naming the A537 Macclesfield to Buxton road as the most dangerous road in Britain. The results also featured in an edition of television programme Police Camera Action!. =Ireland= In May 2008 the Foundation released the latest Risk Rating results for Ireland, reporting that the Ireland network no longer featured any roads in the highest risk banding (Black: High Risk). In the Republic of Ireland, the N53 was identified as a priority for action to improve road safety, while in Northern Ireland the A2 was prioritised. The 2008 Ireland report also published the results of the first Star Rating Assessment of Ireland's roads which showed a clear split in terms of safety design between the historic non-designed single carriageway roads with poor safety provision, and the newer motorways and dual carriageways which achieved a very high safety rating. Campaigning for Safe Road Design The Campaign for Safe Road Design is a partnership between 13 major road safety stakeholders in the United Kingdom that is calling for the UK Government to invest in a safe road infrastructure which could cut deaths on British roads by 33%. The Road Safety Foundation is the lead partner in the campaign. Following the success of the campaign, having influenced the UK Department for Transport to support the increase of EuroRAP risk rate mapping to the wider road network in the UK, EuroRAP has organized a European Campaign for Safe Road Design along the lines of the UK campaign. The European campaign features 28 partners across Europe and aims to influence the EC to use Safe Road Infrastructure Initiatives to cut casualties by 50,000 a year for the next decade, which is the equivalent of ‚Ç¨50 billion over the decade or 0.5% of GDP.

It is headquartered in Bamako. The primary goal of the Mali Red Cross is to provide aid to people suffering the combined effects of armed conflict, promote nutrition and health, and provide assistance during food shortages. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) recognized the Mali Red Cross on September 14, 1967 as the 109 national society of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. 2014 Kidnapping On February 8, 2014, five Malian humanitarian workers, four of them whom were Mali Red Cross workers, were reported missing by the IFRC. Reportedly, the humanitarian workers were traveling on a road between the northern towns of Kidal and Gao in Northern Mali before their disappearance. The abductions led to a temporary suspension in the movement of Mali Red Cross staff members in the northern region. On February 11, an Islamist militant group, the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, or MUJAO, claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of the five Malian workers. On April 17, 2014, a news release by the Bamako-based IFRC reported that the abducted Mali Red Cross workers had been freed during an undisclosed military operation conducted by French military forces. Two of the workers suffered minor injuries. The remaining three went unharmed. 2014 Ebola response The first case of the Ebola virus disease in Mali was detected in October 2014. In response, the Mali Red Cross in collaboration with the IFRC and other healthcare organizations throughout Mali launched an Ebola operation in order to combat and prevent the possibility of an Ebola outbreak. With only a total of eight cases that resulted in six deaths, the response was relatively successful. Mali was declared Ebola-free on January 18, 2015. Statistics In 2014, the Mali Red Cross distributed over 15,000 tons of food, provided access to drinking water for 240,000 people, and secured 4,100 detainee visits.

Six were built at Naples by Societa Pattison between 1910 and 1913. They were the first large Italian destroyers and the first fitted with steam turbines. The class is sometimes also called the I class. Two of the class were sunk during World War I, but the four surviving ships remained in service until 1937‚Äì38. One of the class, , was reinstated during World War II and served in the R√®gia Marina and the German Kriegsmarine before being sunk by U.S. aircraft in late 1944.  Design and construction  The Indomito class was designed by Luigi Scaglia of Societa Pattison of Naples. The boats were the first large destroyers of the R√®gia Marina and the first fitted with steam turbines. The Indomito class were the first in the progression of Italian destroyers to be called either tre pipe or tre canne for their three funnels.Future destroyers, until the 1921‚Äì22 , were also called tre pipe or tre canne.

As built, the ships were armed with one /40 gun, four /40 guns, and two torpedo tubes. In 1914 they were augmented with an additional two torpedo tubes. During World War I, guide rails for laying up to ten mines were added to the ships. Later wartime changes replaced all the guns with five /35 and a single /39 AA gun. Oil capacity was also increased during the war from to in order to increase endurance, but the increased weight had the opposite effect: slowing the ships and reduced their endurance.

Following India's independence in 1947, the Indian National Congress government led by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru completed this codification and reform, a process started by the British Raj. According to the British policy of noninterference, personal- law reform should have arisen from a demand from the Hindu community. That was not the case, as there was significant opposition from various conservative Hindu politicians, organisations and devotees; they saw themselves unjustly singled out as the sole religious community whose laws were to be reformed.Williams, p. 18. However, the Nehru administration saw such codification as necessary to unify the Hindu community, which ideally would be a first step towards unifying the nation.Williams, p. 107. They succeeded in passing four Hindu code bills in 1955‚Äì56: the Hindu Marriage Act, Hindu Succession Act, Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, and Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act.Williams, p. 106. They continue to be controversial to the present day among women, religious, and nationalist groups.Williams, p. 28. Background While there may be a permanence of certain fundamental beliefs about the nature of life that is pervasive through Hinduism, Hindus as a group are highly non-homogenous. As Derrett says in his book on Hindu law, \\"We find the Hindus to be as diverse in race, psychology, habitat, employment and way of life as any collection of human beings that might be gathered from the ends of the earth.\\" The Dharma≈õƒÅstra‚Äîthe textual authority on matters of marriage, adoption, the joint family, minorities, succession, religious endowments, and caste privileges‚Äîhas often been seen as the private law of the Hindus. However, whatever is known and interpreted about this Hindu law is a jumble of rules, often inconsistent and incompatible with one another, that are lacking in uniformity.John D. M. Derrett. Hindu Law Past and Present. 1957. Calcutta. pp. 1‚Äì80. Hindu law's content and structure has ultimately survived as a result of its administration by British judges who gave a lot of attention to Hindu religious-legal texts, while simultaneously invoking English procedure, jurisprudence, and English law to fill any gaps. Opinions often differ as to the extent of the discrepancy between the current law and the public's needs, but most agree that a substantial inconsistency exists.John D. M. Derrett. The Administration of Hindu Law by the British for Comparative Studies in Society & History. 1961. pp. 10‚Äì52.M. Galanter. Hindu Law and the Development of the Modern Indian Legal System. 1964.L. I. and S. H. Rudolph. Barristers and Brahmans in India. 1965. The British colonial government administered India largely through a policy of noninterference, allowing civil matters to be dealt with through respective religious communities. Matters that fell under the jurisdiction of these communities were called \\"personal laws.\\" The British began the intensive process of codifying Hindu personal law in the early 1940s in an attempt to notate and therefore organise the Indian political system. In 1921, the British Government had already gone so far as to welcome individual Members' efforts at piecemeal codification, a limited but significant shift in policy. According to Levy, that year, \\"two Hindu legislators, one a lawyer in the Central Legislative Assembly (the lower House), the other an eminent scholar of Sanskrit in the Central Council of States (the upper House), initiated resolutions seeking Government support for a Hindu Code of family law.\\"Harold Lewis Levy. \\"Lawyer-Scholars, Lawyer-Politicians and the Hindu Code Bill, 1921‚Äì1956\\". Law and Society Review. November 1968. Vol 3, issue 2/3. pp. 303‚Äì316. In the next two decades many such fragmentary measures were enacted, modifying the Hindu law of marriage, inheritance, and joint family property. As a whole, the enacted bills carried further a modest trend toward increasing property alienability, reducing the legal importance of caste, sanctioning religious heterodoxy and conversion and, most significantly, improving the position of women. However, it was the passing of the Hindu Women's Rights to Property Act (Deshmukh Act) in 1937, which had given the widow a son's share in property that was one of the most substantial steps towards the Hindu Code Bill. Uniform civil code In December 1946, the Constituent Assembly convened to devise a Constitution for the soon-to-be- independent India. Some argued that India's various personal laws were too divisive and that a uniform civil code should be instituted in their place. And once the notion of a uniform civil code was put forward, it soon became accepted as an important part of the effort to construct an Indian national identity, over the separate identities of caste, religion and ethnicity.K. C. Markandan. Directive Principles in the Indian Constitution. 1966. Bombay. pp. 104‚Äì110.Syed Tahir Mahmood. Muslim Personal Law: Role of State in the Subcontinent. 1977. pp. 77‚Äì78. Some resistance to the code was on the grounds that its imposition would destroy the cultural identity of minorities, the protection of which is crucial to democracy. Certain feminists thus argue that the uniform civil code debate balances on the polarity of the state and community, rendering the gender-based axis upon which it turns, invisible.Nivedita Menon. \\"State, Gender, Community: Citizenship in Contemporary India\\" [subscription needed]. Economic and Political Weekly. 31 January 1998. Volume 33, issue 5. Reproduced on JSTOR. Retrieved on 15 April 2012. A compromise was reached in the inclusion in the first draft of an article that compelled the state \\"to endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.\\" The clause, a goal, not a right, became Article 44 in the Constitution. It was widely criticised by proponents of a uniform code because it contained no mechanism and provided no timetable for enforcement. However, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and others insisted on its inclusion, arguing that even if it was only symbolic, it was an important step towards national unity.Williams, p. 99‚Äì101. Though Nehru himself likely would have favoured a uniform code, he knew that personal laws were linked with religious identity in India and therefore could not be easily abolished. Recognizing that what he wanted was not a political reality, he settled for an unenforceable clause.Williams, p. 97. Beginning of codification =Initial draft= In 1941, the colonial government had appointed a four-member Hindu Law Committee, known as the Rau Committee after its chairman B. N. Rau. The committee was to resolve doubts about the Deshmukh Act's construction, ensure that its introduction of new female heirs was not made at the expense of the decedent's own daughter and consider bills introduced to abolish women's limited estate and to make polygamy a ground for separate residence and maintenance. Later in 1941, the Committee reported that the time had come for a Hindu Code. Social progress and modernization could only be achieved by fundamental reforms, which recognized gender equality. The code was to be shaped with the aid of orthodox, conservative and reformist Hindus and by a comprehensive blending of the best of the current schools of Hindu law and the ancient texts. The 1941 Report was accompanied by two draft bills, each of which was laid before a select committee of both houses of the legislature. Much publicity was given to the project, and as a result of the committees' reports, the Hindu Law Committee itself was revived in 1944 and under its chairman, B. N. Rau, prepared a Draft Code dealing with Succession, Maintenance, Marriage and Divorce, Minority and Guardianship and Adoption. It was that Code that was widely circulated and discussed and given the name \\"Hindu Code Bill\\". After publication in twelve regional languages and a wide publicity campaign, the Rau Committee toured the country and examined witnesses. The result 1947 report of the committee included and went far beyond the 1941 proposals, recommending the abolition of the joint-family property system, the introduction of the daughter's simultaneous succession with the son to the father's estate, the abolition of the barrier to intercaste marriages, the assimilation of civil and sacramental marriages, and the introduction of divorce for the higher castes. It was the intention of the government that this first draft should become law on 1 January 1948, but the whole project was temporarily suspended when independence led to the priorities of the legislature to be consumed with the task of creating the new regime. By 1943, a significant opposition to the code had begun to develop inside and outside the Legislature. In the 1943‚Äì44 legislative debate, opponents and supporters alike accepted as fact the view that the majority of the legal profession continued to support the code. Opponents tried to undercut the perceived support by arguing that lawyers had become westernized or that the merits of the bill were for the people to decide, not lawyers. Nehru had already been forced to retreat from an original position of passing the bill. However, his position greatly improved in 1951 when he succeeded Purushottam Das Tandon as Congress president. He chose not to test his combined powers as prime minister and party president, in regard to the bill at that time and allowed it to lapse. He, however, promised fellow supporters that he would campaign on the bill, with plain arguments on the merits. =Ambedkar's draft= Law minister B. R. Ambedkar in 1950 The Ministry of Law revised the first draft in 1948 and made some small alterations to it, making it more suitable for discussion in the Constituent Assembly, where it was finally introduced. It was referred to a select committee under the chairmanship of law minister B. R. Ambedkar, and the committee made a number of important changes in the Bill. This edition had eight sections: part one delineated who would be considered a Hindu and did away with the caste system. Significantly, it stipulated that the Hindu Code would apply to anyone who was not a Muslim, Parsi, Christian or Jew, and asserted that all Hindus would be governed under a uniform law. Part two of the bill concerned marriage; part three adoption; part four, guardianship; part five the policy on joint-family property, and was controversial as it included the nontraditional allocation of property to women. Part six concerned policies regarding women's property, and parts seven and eight established policies on succession and maintenance.Williams, p. 103. By allowing for divorce, Ambedkar's version of the Hindu Code conflicted with traditional Hindu personal law, which did not sanction divorce (although it was practiced). It also \\"established one joint family system of property ownership for all Hindus\\" by doing away with regional rules. Finally, it allotted portions of inheritance to daughters, while giving widows complete property rights where they had previously been restricted. Conflicts also arose from the categorization of who would be considered Hindu. The Code established \\"Hindu\\" to be a negative category that would include all those who did not identify as a Muslim, Jew, Christian, or Parsi. Such a broad designation ignored the tremendous diversity of region, tradition and custom in Hinduism. Those who practised Sikhism, Jainism, and Buddhism were considered to be Hindus under the jurisdiction of the Code Bill. While they had originally included aspects of Hinduism, by then, they had evolved into unique religions with their own customs, traditions, and rituals. There was also significant controversy over what was established to be Hindu personal law. Sanctioned under Hinduism were a variety of practices and perspectives. Therefore, the administration had to arbitrate between these variations, legitimating some and disregarding or marginalising others.Williams, p. 14. =Further revisions and passing= The draft that Ambedkar submitted to the Constituent Assembly was opposed by several sections of lawmakers. The motion to begin discussion on the Hindu Code Bill was debated for over fifty hours, and discussion was postponed for over a year. Realizing that he would have to make significant concessions to get the bill passed, Nehru suggested that the proposed law be split into several sections. He told the Constituent Assembly they would contend with only the first 55 clauses concerning marriage and divorce, while the rest would be considered by the Parliament of India after the first general election. However, the compromise was largely ineffective in convincing conservatives to support the bill. When only 3 of the 55 clauses passed after an additional week of debating, Nehru had Ambedkar's committee distribute a new draft that complied with many of the critics' demands, including the reinstitution of the MitƒÅk·π£arƒÅ joint family system, an amendment to allow for brothers to buy out daughters' share of the inheritance, and a stipulation allowing divorce only after three years of marriage.Williams, p. 104. However, after the bills were defeated again in the assembly, Ambedkar resigned. In a letter that he released to the press, he held that his decision was largely based on the treatment that had been accorded to the Hindu Code Bill as well as the administration's inability to get it passed. In 1951‚Äì52, India held its first general elections. Nehru made the Hindu Code Bill one of his top campaign initiatives, declaring that should the Indian National Congress win, he would succeed in getting it passed through parliament. Congress won sweeping victories, with Nehru reinstated as prime minister, and he began a comprehensive effort to devise a Bill that could be passed.Williams, p. 105. Nehru split the Code Bill into four separate bills, including the Hindu Marriage Act, the Hindu Succession Act, the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, and the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. These were met with significantly less opposition, and between the years of 1952 and 1956, each was effectively introduced in and passed by Parliament.; Intentions As Mansfield writes regarding the need for personal laws in India, \\"The spectacle of large political entities in different parts of the world collapsing and giving place to smaller entities based on ethnicity, religion or language or combinations of these factors, rather than strengthening the idea that a powerfully centralised, culturally homogenous nation is essential for order and prosperity, may have confirmed for some the view that the pressing task for India is not to increase central power and cultural homogeneity, but to find an alternative to the 'nation-state' model, an alternative that will sustain unity through some form of 'pluralism'.\\" Nehru's primary purpose in instituting the Hindu code bills was to unify the Hindu community.so it made sense to define Hindu in the broadest possible sense. By legal equity, Nehru intended to \\"erase distinctions within the Hindu community and create Hindu social unity.... The integration of Hindus into a homogeneous society could best be done by enacting an all-embracing code which encompasses within its fold every sect, caste, and religious denomination.\\" The debates over Article 44 in the Constitution revealed that many believed varied laws and legal divisions helped create or at least were reflective of.social divisions. Nehru and his supporters insisted that the Hindu community, which comprised 80% of the Indian population, first needed to be united before any actions were taken to unify the rest of India. Therefore, the codification of Hindu personal law became a symbolic beginning on the road to establishing the Indian national identity. Nehru also felt that because he was Hindu, it was his prerogative to codify specifically Hindu law, as opposed to Muslim or Jewish law.Williams, p. 119. Those in Parliament who supported the bills also saw them as a vital move towards the modernization of Hindu society, as they would clearly delineate secular laws from religious law. Many also heralded the bills' opportunity to implement greater rights for women, which were established to be necessary, for India's development.Williams, p. 108. Support and opposition During the debates over the Hindu code bills in the General Assembly, large segments of the Hindu population protested and held rallies against the bills. Numerous organizations were formed to lobby for the defeat of the bills and massive amounts of literature were distributed throughout the Hindu population. In the face of such vocal opposition, Nehru had to justify the passage of the Hindu code bills.Williams, p. 110. Earlier, he had stated that in accordance with the policy of noninterference, he was undertaking codification in compliance with a demand from the Hindu community. When it became clear that the vast majority of Hindus did not support the Bills, he insisted that though they were a minority, those who supported the Bills were modern and progressive and so held vital weight in the Hindu community, in importance if not in numbers. He also argued that because the bill's supporters were progressive, those who dissented would eventually change their position when confronted with the realities of modernity.Williams, p. 110-12. Proponents included both men and women within and outside of Parliament belonging to various political parties. Significant support for the bills came from Congress' women's wing (All-India Women's Conference) and several other women's organizations. Supporters largely sought to convince the public that the bills did not stray far from classical Hindu personal law.Williams, p. 108-9. Essentially, those in Parliament who opposed the bills were men, largely from Nehru's own Congress party. They believed that the code bills would institute reform that strayed too far from the classical Hindu social order and were too radical. They argued that practices such as divorce were absolutely not condoned by Hinduism. \\"To a Hindu the marriage is sacramental and as such indissoluble.\\" They also felt that should equal property rights be given to women, the MitƒÅk·π£arƒÅ concept of a joint family would crumble, as would the foundation of Hindu society. They also insisted that if daughters and wives were given inheritance, more conflicts would arise within families. Their main argument, however, was that the bills lacked public support. Therefore, they were a direct contradiction to the policy of noninterference and would mean the government was meddling in personal law. They implied that these were bills propagated by a small minority of Hindus onto the majority who did not want them. Today The application of the Hindu Code Bills have been controversial in determining who is to be called a Hindu and who is entitled to be exempted from certain rules of Hindu law. They are also still contentious among many communities, including women's, nationalist and religious groups. At the time of their creation, many portrayed them as a serious deviation from Hindu legal precedent. Feminists, such as Nivedita Menon, argue that since the personal laws cover matters of marriage, inheritance and guardianship of children, and since all personal laws discriminate against women, the tension within the laws is a contradiction between the rights of women as individual citizens and those of religious communities as collective units of the democracy. In her 1998 article \\"State, Gender, Community: Citizenship in Contemporary India\\", she calls for more support and initiation for reform within all personal laws and more legislation in areas that are not covered by secular or personal laws, such as domestic violence. She also argues for a gender-equal framework of rights that covers the \\"public\\" domain of work (maternity benefits, equal wages) and is available to all Indian citizens, thus avoiding a direct confrontation with communities and communal politics.

In 1983, with the amusement park in financial difficulties, the Crystal Beach Company sold the land comprising the Hill jointly to its residents.https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/04/15/lack-of-us-seasonal- residents-on-lake-erie-would-be-devastating-for-shoreline-towns.html The 40 shacks that were built on the dune, for and by park workers, are now fully equipped summer homes that front directly on the beach. Including the three cottages formerly used for customs officers, these 43 homes now comprise a gated community called the Crystal Beach Hill Association (formerly the Crystal Beach Hill Cottagers Organization).

The Mark of Cain (, Ot ·∏≤ayin) is a bestselling novel by Israeli author Ram Oren: it was Israel's top paperback for five weeks;Herbert R. Lottman, 'Jerusalem Gears Up For Its 20th Fair', Publishers Weekly, 248.13 (26 March 2001). was in April 1996 'the fastest selling book in Israeli history';Steven Aftergood, 'Scientists Clash With Security System', Secrecy & Government Bulletin, 57 (April 1996). and by 2008 had sold 100,000 copies. It is based on Neo-Nazi activities in Argentina and the identity of a Mossad chief, Michael Bornstein. Using earnings from earlier books, and marketing wisdom he had garnered suggesting that readers are more likely to buy books they see piled in tall stacks on bookstore counters, Oren decided to publish Mark of Cain himself in a print run thought to have been the largest ever for a novel in Israel, 30,000 copies.. Plot summary The story opens with the liberation of a German concentration camp and the escape of Jewish refugees. One of them, a man named Jacob Bornstein, stumbles across a burning German convoy and finds a crying baby in the car of the commander, Berman. He rescues it and claims it as his own son, looking at it as a compensation from Heaven for his own lost son. However, without food he and the baby fall deathly ill and are taken to a hospital, where they are nursed back to health. But the hospital director suspects that the baby, whom the Jew has named Michael, is not his real son, and Jacob escapes with the infant. He is housed by a kindly German woman whose husband was in the SS and she takes care of him and the baby lovingly until she discovers he is Jewish. Jacob runs away, and is soon placed in a refugee camp. Shortly after he is smuggled into Israel, but the ship is intercepted and when they are discovered by the British, the passengers revolt and the ship is burned. Jacob and the infant barely escape. Years later, when Michael is seventeen, Jacob dies leaving his adopted son devastated, and carrying his secret to the grave. Michael eventually becomes head of the Israeli intelligence, the Mossad, and sends a spy called Dan Elad to intercept Neo-Nazi activities in Argentina. He is housed at the ranch of the former camp commander Herman Mueller and his daughter Ilsa. Soon after their friend Kurt Kirshchner suspects him as a spy, but Ilsa refuses to listen. On a trip to Germany, Herman Mueller tells his daughter that she was the daughter of the commander of a concentration camp, Berman. She visits their graves but finds that a grave for her brother, who should have been a baby when he died, is missing. she hires a detective to locate him and shortly after Mueller, close to arrest, commits suicide. Dan Elad finally manages to organize a plan with the Mossad chief to kidnap Ilsa on her return from Germany, and when she is brought to Jerusalem he at first pretends that he has been kidnapped along with her. Finally Michael discovers that the detective hired by Ilsa is close to discovering his identity, and, shocked, has DNA tests prove if there is any truth in it. They reveal that he is Ilsa's brother. With his friend Amnon, who is running for Prime Minister of Israel, Michael decides that it is better to acknowledge his identity before the detective. He confesses it publicly on the News, and many protest to his remaining the Mossad chief. He visits Ilsa in prison and tells her who he is, and despite his determination to remain a Jew, she admits she cannot hate him. Finally the trial is held in Jerusalem and after Dan Elad's testimony of her activities, Ilsa is sentenced to twenty years in prison. After Michael brings his family to see their aunt, protests to his being chief of Mossad become even higher. His son is kidnapped as a final warning, and returns with scars and minor injuries. In jail Ilsa hangs herself, thinking that it is she who causes the \\"Mark of Cain\\" on Michael, hence the title. But it doesn't help. The present Prime Minister, ill and weakening in his position, decides that it is best to fire Michael. It is hard for Michael to cope with the truth, and when his friend Amnon is named Prime Minister, he reinstates Michael as head of the Mossad, giving a touching speech and calling forth a standing ovation.

The nearest town is Lutterworth, about to the north. Rugby is 6 miles south of the parish. The River Swift flows through the parish, to the north of the village. The parish is located near the M1, M6 and A5, with the main settlement just off the A426 Rugby Road, which was built to bypass the village. Until the year 2000 the village had a small post-office, operated inside the porch of a resident's cottage.  History  The name 'Cotesbach' is believed to mean the dwelling of a person called 'Cott's', which is next to a valley with a stream. In Middle English 'beche' is translated to mean a river or flow of water in a valley. Three places in Cotesbach parish are believed to be sites of early settlements of round houses, dating from around 800 to 42 BC. The Roman period saw some changes for Cotesbach, especially with the creation of nearby roads such as Watling Street and Fosse Way. Shards of Roman pottery have been found in the village, leading to people believing that there could have been a Roman villa in the area. The current site of Cotesbach is believed to have originated from the Saxon period. In this period, Cotesbach was in the 'neutral' area between the Kingdom of Wessex and the Dane Law territory. Many archaeological finds originate from this period, including many brooches, a copper alloy stirrup mount, a small sword/dagger and a shield boss. The Domesday period saw a new Lord of the parish, Hugh de Gretemaisnil (French: Hugues de Grandmesnil) from France. During the Medieval period the population was believed to be around 150 people, who were mostly agricultural workers. Several archaeological finds come from this period, including a piece of decorated tile. The area had been considerably successful until 1591 when the owner of the land, Robert Devereux decided to sell large amounts of land to raise funds. Large amounts of land in Cotesbach came into ownership of John Quarles. Quarles raised rent for tenant farmers, purchased other sections of land and began to enclose the common land for farm animals. This upset many local people, who relied on the common land. A petition was taken to King James, who started an enquiry into the events, however the enquiry resulted in Quarles being given permission to enclose land in 1603. Enclosure of the land occurred across Cotesbach and beyond. Tension peaked in 1607 when the Enclosures Riot occurred, which resulted in people from many rural towns and villages pulling down hedges and fences and opening up the enclosures. In Leicester gallows were installed to try and put-off the rioters. By 1609 Cotesbach was a mixture of common and enclosed land, however in 1612 the land was enclosed again, meaning the agricultural world was changed permanently. This description of Cotesbach was given in the late nineteenth century: \\"A parish in Lutterworth district, Leicester; adjacent to Watling-street and the boundary with Warwick, 1¬æ mile SSW of Lutterworth, and 4 SE by S of Ullesthorpe r. station. It has a post office under Lutterworth. Acres, 1, 227. Real property, ¬£2, 327. Pop., 125. Houses, 23. The property is divided among a few\\". Places of interest The Hall was constructed in 1703. It was originally built as a rectory for Reverend Edward Wells. The hall is believed to be built on land which used to contain a farmhouse. Since 1759 when Robert Marriott bought the estate, eight generations of the Marriott family have resided here. The Manor is the oldest building in Cotesbach to be used as a house and is grade two listed. The manor was re-built around 1630 by George Bennett. The building is on the site of a previous Tudor building. The Manor is made up of many parts from many eras. The Schoolhouse was constructed by Robert Marriott in the late 18th century to provide a good education to the village children. Around the 1870s the schoolhouse was no longer required because another school opened in nearby Lutterworth. The Cotesbach Educational Trust now has a lease on the building. St Mary's Church was constructed in the 13th century, however it is believed that a wooden building was on the same site previously. In the late 14th century the bell for the church was cast. In 1702 Dr Edward Wells restored the building. In 1812, ¬£400 was spent on renovating the church after the central tower collapsed, adding a new roof and side tower, and, later on in the century, installing new heating and applying stucco to the outside. 1919 saw a clock added to the church as a memorial to World War One, as well as a stained glass window which was installed in memorial to the two Marriott brothers who lost their lives during the war. Demographics The occupations of residents of Cotesbach Civil Parish, Leicestershire, as reported by the Census of Population from 1881. The 1881 census reported that the most dominant occupation was domestic service of offices, with 36 people from the parish employed in this sector. 35 people had unknown occupations. 15 people worked in the agricultural sector. Seven people had unspecified occupations. Five people worked in house, furniture and decorations. Five people were classed as 'professionals'. Four people worked in general or unspecified commodities. Four people worked with animals. One person worked in dress, one person in transport/communications, one in commercial occupations and another person in a general/local government role. This shows that the parish was mainly working class, specialising in agriculture, however there were a few members of the middle and upper classes. Women mainly did not have a specified occupation or worked in domestic service, whilst men were mainly working in agriculture, or in domestic service or with animals. This shows the gender divide between men who went out to work on farms, whilst women remained at home or worked as domestic servants in wealthy homes. The occupations of residents of Cotesbach Civil Parish, Leicestershire, as reported by the Census of Population from 2011.The 2011 census reveals a large change in the occupation of residents of Cotesbach from 1881. It reveals that 39 residents work in the 'Professional Occupations' field. 19 people work as managers, directors and senior officials. 18 people are associate professionals and technical professionals. 16 people class themselves as being in a skilled trade occupations. 11 people are working in the administrative and secretarial occupations. Nine people are working in the caring, leisure and other service occupations sector. Six people are working as sales and customer service operators and three people have 'Elementary Occupations'. This shows a move from a mainly agricultural and working class area, to an area mainly for the wealthy and those in professional and skilled occupations. The total population of Cotesbach Civil Parish, Leicestershire, as reported by the Census of Population from 1801 to 2011.The population of Cotesbach increased from the 1801 census until the 1831 census where there was a decrease in population. This decrease could possibly be due to the industrial revolution, especially with the development of steam power. The population then rose slightly in 1851. In 1881 the population appeared to increase rapidly, however this increase occurred because the boundary for Cotesbach was increased. In the 1891 and 1901 census's the population was decreasing, possibly due to people moving out to industrial cities. By the 1911 census the population began to increase and this trend continued up to the 1961 census, with a population of 146 people. The next census included was in 2001, when the population was 212, continuing the increasing trend. In 2011 the population of the parish had decreased by eight people to 204, possibly due to young people leaving the village for employment. Present day The Cotesbach Educational Trust has increased interest in local heritage, helped by the Heritage Lottery Fund donating ¬£570,000 to the Educational Trust to restore three historic buildings including the Schoolhouse as an educational resource centre for heritage, environment and arts.

They straddle the boundary of Forrabury and Minster and Lanteglos by Camelford civil parishes just over a mile (2 km) north-west of the market town of Camelford The settlements are on the B3314 road from the A39 to Delabole (now part of a busy route from the A30 near Launceston to north Cornwall).Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 200 Newquay & Bodmin Description and history Approaching Slaughterbridge from the south on the B3314 Statue of King Arthur at Innsbruck designed by Albrecht D√ºrer and cast by Peter Vischer the Elder, 1520s At Slaughterbridge the B3314 road drops dramatically into the valley of the River Camel, describing a steeply graded 'S' bend and narrowing over the eponymous single-track bridge over the river. Slaughterbridge is a very old settlement and is said to take its name from two battles which reputedly took place nearby during the Early Middle Ages. As 'slaughter' is an Old English word for 'marsh' it provides no evidence that battles were fought here (see Gafulford for details). Worthyvale Manor (mentioned in the Domesday Book although the current building is 17th century) lies north of the bridge and there are several other sites of archaeological interest to the north and east of the river. The inscribed stone at Slaughterbridge near WorthyvaleInscribed stone on the bank of the River Camel, about 150 metres upstream from Slaughter Bridge, near Camelford (CISP WVALE/1). Inscribed \\"LATINI (H)IC IACIT FILIUS MAGARI\\" in the Latin script, and \\"LA[TI]NI\\" ·öÇ·öê·öà·öî·öÖ·öî in the Ogham script Not far from Worthyvale beside the river at Slaughterbridge is a memorial stone which bears ogham and Latin inscriptions (Latini [h]ic iacit fili Macari = Latinus son of Macarus lies here). The stone lies in the remains of an 18th-century garden created by Charlotte Boscawen, Dowager Lady Falmouth (the daughter of Hugh Boscawen ‚Äì see Great Cornish Families). It dates from the sixth century and is thought to commemorate an unknown Celtic chieftain. Legendary and folk associations link this stone with the place where King Arthur met Mordred for the decisive Battle of Camlann in 537. Often referred to as 'King Arthur's Stone', it was first recorded by Cornish antiquary Richard Carew in 1602 but had lain on the river bank for at least a thousand years prior to that. The stone was added to the Historic England Heritage at Risk register in 2020, the stone being particularly at risk from flooding. A mediaeval narrative account of King Arthur's life is found in Historia Regum Britanniae (\\"History of the Kings of Britain\\") by Geoffrey of Monmouth completed around 1138. Geoffrey favours a river bridge as the site of Arthur's last battle: \\"Arthur was filled with great mental anguish by the fact that Mordred had escaped him so often. Without losing a moment, he followed him to that same locality, reaching the River Camlann, where Mordred was awaiting his arrival.\\" Geoffrey claimed to have based his account on a 'very ancient book' in the British language (i.e. Cornish or Welsh), but much of his 'History' is pure invention. It should not be forgotten that if Arthur was a historical figure he preceded Geoffrey by more than 500 years. The History of the Kings of Britain, Geoffrey of Monmouth, ed. Lewis Thorpe (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1966) Alfred, Lord Tennyson described King Arthur's Stone after a visit to Slaughterbridge in June 1848. Among Tennyson's best-known work is Idylls of the King, a work devoted to the legend of King Arthur. It is thought by some that Camelford was the site of Arthur's fabled court of Camelot, both because of the similarity of name and the proximity of Slaughterbridge. =Treague= The hamlet of Treague is on the north side of the B3314 road, at the top of the hill up from Slaughterbridge. There is a commercial Arthurian Centre at Treague with car parking, a gift shop and tea rooms. It features a display of Arthur memorabilia. To the east of Treague are the earthworks and enclosure of a small medieval settlement called Old Melorne. A medieval village is first recorded here in 1296 but by the 18th century, documents refer only to a farm at the site. The name is commemorated by present-day Melorne Farm, a few hundred yards west at Camelford Station crossroads. Archeologist Nick Hanks, currently working for English Heritage with the National Monument Record Centre, runs an archaeological project called 'Slaughterbridge Training Excavation Project' (STEP) in the area around Slaughterbridge and Treague. =Camelford Station= The road sign on the approach to Camelford Station at the junction of the B3266 and B3314 roads Map of the stations on the North Cornwall Railway Camelford Station is half-a-mile east of Treague at the junction of the B3314 and the B3266 from Camelford to Boscastle at . The former station gives its name to the crossroads, a fact recognised on the roadsigns at the junction, and a hamlet. The settlement consists of a farm (Melorne) and its buildings, the former station building and a few other properties including a Methodist chapel. The former Camelford railway station was on the ex-LSWR North Cornwall line which ran from Halwill to Wadebridge and Padstow. Camelford Station was opened in 1893 and it closed in October 1966 when services on the line from Halwill to Wadebridge ended. Although named after nearby Camelford, the station was in Minster parish well over a mile from the town it served. It was located \\"at a road junction in wild country almost devoid of trees\\" which remains an apt description of the exposed location. Camelford railway station served not only Camelford, but also Tintagel and Boscastle (which did not have a closer rail link) with bus services operated by Southern National connecting the villages with the station. The main station building was substantially built from local stone and provided accommodation for the stationmaster. It is now a private residence and home to the British Cycling Museum. This small museum is a private enterprise set up by an enthusiastic couple and consists of a comprehensive collection of over 400 vehicles, cycling memorabilia and an old cycle repair workshop. The museum is now closed. West of Camelford station are a few isolated dwellings and the village of Delabole. The bridge at Slaughterbridge The three-span stone bridge over the River Camel at Slaughterbridge is Grade II listed being one of six listed bridges on the river, the largest number on any Cornish river.

The Irish language term for \\"martial arts\\" is eala√≠ona comhraic. Traditional styles include Dorn√°la√≠ocht (boxing), Cora√≠ocht (wrestling), Speach√≥ireacht (kicking), and Batad√≥ireacht (stick fighting).  Boxing  Dorn√°la√≠ocht is the Irish word for boxing, dorn meaning fist. The Irish are well known for their bare-knuckle boxing style. Dorn√°la√≠ocht's stance is often reflected in Irish caricatures such as that of the Notre Dame Leprechaun. The lead hand stays at a greater distance from the body than done in modern boxing. The lead arm's shoulder stays tight against the jaw while the other arm is tucked tightly to the body, using its fist to guard the jaw. This is due to the bare- knuckle nature of the style. Charlie Mitchell demonstrating the traditional bare knuckle boxing stance. Without large boxing gloves, it is not recommended to tuck and cover up from an assault. Instead, the lead hand is used to block the incoming attack while side stepping and back stepping to create an angle or swaying the torso away from or towards the opponent. The more distantly placed lead hand is also used to more easily obtain a single collar clinch, so that another valued aspect of Dorn√°la√≠ocht can then be employed: dirty boxing. In Irish martial arts, dirty boxing is very effective for striking but is also used to set up many grappling-based attacks from collar-and-elbow. In Irish- American schools, Dorn√°la√≠ocht is sometimes referred to as \\"Irish Boxing\\", \\"Irish Scrapping\\", or \\"Scrapping\\". Radio Telef√≠s √âireann's Prime Time, which discusses Irish related social and political problems, had an hour-long documentary on the Irish Travellers and also their bare knuckle boxing heritage.  Wrestling  Cora√≠ocht is the Irish word for wrestling. Ireland has its own form of wrestling, notably collar and elbow wrestling. Cora√≠ocht is also the name of a back hold style of wrestling practised in Ireland. Cora√≠ocht can be practised with or without a jacket and features a wide array of trips, mares, takedowns, slams, pins, advancements, submissions, grapevines, and escapes. The most quoted \\"modern\\" way of describing the philosophy behind Cora√≠ocht is \\"use balance and speed to obtain position so that strength can then be applied to the leverage created\\". In Irish- American‚Äìbased systems, Cora√≠ocht is sometimes referred to as \\"Irish Wrestling\\", \\"Celtic Wrestling\\", \\"Irish Scuffling\\", \\"Scuffling\\", and \\"Collar- and-Elbow\\". Famous Irish wrestlers include Danno O'Mahony of Cork (former world champion), Steve Casey of Kerry (former world champion), and Con O'Kelly, who competed for Britain in the 1908 Summer Olympics. Famous Irish- American wrestlers include Henry Moses Dufur and John McMahon.  Kicking  Speach√≥ireacht is the term used for kicking techniques. Kicking techniques were practised in sports such as Gaelic football and Irish dancing, but specifically for martial arts as well. Shin kicking would have been the main type used in fighting bouts, both kicking the shin and kicking with the shin, like a shin kick seen used in Mixed Martial Arts today. Most techniques attack the opponent's shins, knees, and thigh areas.  Stick fighting  Bataireacht is the traditional art of the Irish shillelagh, which is still identified with popular Irish culture to this day, although the arts of Bataireacht are much less so. The sticks used for Bataireacht are not of a standardised size, as there are various styles of Bataireacht, using various kinds of sticks. The most preferred of these kinds is a branch or walking stick. By the 18th century, Bataireacht became increasingly associated with Irish gangs called \\"factions\\". Irish faction fights involved large groups of Irish men (and sometimes women) who would engage in melees at county fairs, weddings, funerals, or any other convenient gathering. However, most historians (best summarised by James S. Donnelly, Jr. (1983) in \\"Irish Peasants: Violence & Political Unrest, 1780\\") agree that faction fighting had class and political overtones, as depicted for example in the works of William Carleton. By the early 19th century, these gangs had organised into larger regional federations, which coalesced from the old Whiteboys into the Caravat and Shanavest factions. Beginning first in Munster, the Caravat and Shanavest \\"war\\" erupted sporadically throughout the 19th century and caused some serious disturbances. Over time, traditional rules and methods of Bataireacht and Shillelagh Law degenerated into more murderous fighting involving farm implements and guns. As the push for Irish independence from Great Britain gained traction toward the end of the 18th century (see Irish Rebellion of 1798), leaders of the Irish community believed it was necessary to distance themselves from customs associated with factionism and division, to present a united military front to the British, hence the United Irishmen of the Republican movement. Foremost of these customs were the arts of Bataireacht, and the shillelagh was soon replaced with the gun of the new unified faction of the Fenian Movement.

Contents The Hall of Heroes supplement describes in game terms the main characters from various Forgotten Realms scenarios, novels, and comic books, with a history and illustration for each character. The 128-page book features a one-page introduction by Jim Lowder. The book is divided into three sections. The first section describes the major heroes of the Forgotten Realms novels, including game statistics, personal histories and background information on related characters, and role-playing hints. This section includes at least one page of description for each character, and an illustration. The characters described in this section include Adon, Alias, Bruenor Battlehammer, Cyric, Doin Sanehiro, Drizzt Do'Urden, Dragonbait, Elminster, Kelemvor, Prince Tristan Kendrick, Midnight, Robyn, Shandril Shessair, Narm Tamaraith, and Wulfgar. The second section features 48 minor characters of the setting, who had yet to play a central part in the stories at the time of publication, including game statistics, brief character histories, and role-playing tips.

Cornelis Speelman (2 March 1628 ‚Äì 11 January 1684) was Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies from 1681 to 1684. Cornelis Janzoon Speelman was the son of a Rotterdam merchant. He was born on 2 March 1628. In his 16th year, he left aboard the Hillegersberg for the Indies. He was employed as an Assistant (') in the service of the Dutch East India Company (VOC).  Biography  In 1645 he arrived in Batavia, Dutch East Indies. He became Bookkeeper (boekhouder) in 1648 and Underbuyer (onderkoopman) in 1649. He became Secretary (secretaris) to the Dutch Council of the Indies (Raad van Indi√´). He travelled with ambassador Joan Cunaeus to Persia that year, and wrote an account of the voyage. They were received by the Shah Abbas II with great festivity. Even before his voyage came to an end, in 1652 he was promoted to Buyer (koopman). On his return to Batavia, he took up a post in the office of the Bookkeeper-General (boekhouder-generaal), for whom he deputed for a long time, and whom he succeeded in 1657. Meanwhile, he had married the fifteen-year-old Petronella Maria Wonderaer, daughter to the Receiver-General (ontvanger-generaal). In 1659 he was placed in charge of the Company's clerical and administrative staff (kapitein over de compagnie pennisten) in Batavia. In 1661, he became schepen van Batavia (a sort of alderman post connected with local government there).  Career  On 12 June 1663, Cornelis Speelman was appointed Governor and Director of Dutch Coromandel, but was suspended by the Lords Seventeen (Heren XVII), being accused of having illegally engaged in private trading. He had bought a diamond for his wife and later re-sold it because she had not liked it. Despite his strenuous protests, the court in Batavia wanted to make an example of him and he was sentenced to a 15 months suspension and a fine of 3,000 guilders. In 1666, he was named admiral and superintendent of an expedition to Makassar. On 18 November 1667, he concluded the so-called Bongaais Treaty (Treaty of Bongaya). In the same year, he was named Commissioner (commissaris) of Amboina, Banda and Ternate. Consequently, he became Counsellor- extraordinary (raad extra-ordinaris) to the Dutch Council of the Indies. He travelled once again, in 1669, as admiral of another expedition to Makassar where he completely subjugated the kingdom, receiving a gold chain and medallion in recognition of this the following year. He became a full Counsellor of the Indies on 23 March 1671. The following year he was admiral of a fleet sent against the French. In December 1676, he led an expedition to Central Java, supporting the ruler of Mataram who was facing the Trunajaya rebellion. On Java's East Coast, he went to war against the rebel leader Trunajaya. It took some time before peace was re-established. He was called back to Batavia at the end of 1677 and on 18 January 1678 named First Counsellor and Director-General of the Indies (Eerste Raad en Directeur- Generaal van Indi√´). Also in that year he was appointed President of the College van Schepenen (to do with local government) in Batavia. On 29 October 1680 he was named Governor-General, a post he took up on 25 November 1681, succeeding Rijckloff van Goens. During the term of office of Cornelis Speelman as Governor-General, the Sultan of Ternate was defeated. He ceded all his lands of his kingdom to the Company. Speelman also subdued the city of Bantam. Cornelis Speelman died on 11 January 1684 in the Castle at Batavia. His funeral was accompanied with great clamour and splendour, for which no pains or monies were spared. He was buried in the Kruiskerk to the salute of 229 cannon shots. He was followed as Governor-General by Johannes Camphuys.

She was a claimant to the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish thrones and titular monarch in 1559‚Äì1561.  Biography  Dorothea of Denmark, Electress Palatine Princess Dorothea was born on 10 November 1520 to King Christian II of Denmark and Norway and Isabella of Burgundy, sister of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Dorothea had an elder brother, Johann \\"Hans\\", born 21 February 1518. Her elder twin brothers, Philip Ferdinand and Maximilian, born 4 July 1519, had both died before her birth, the latter in 1519 and the former in 1520. Her sister Christina was born two years later, in 1522, and was her only sibling to reach adulthood. Christina would marry twice, first to Francis II, Duke of Milan, and secondly to Francis I, Duke of Lorraine. On 20 January 1523, disloyal nobles forced her father to abdicate and offered the throne to his uncle, Duke Frederick of Holstein. That month, her mother gave birth to a stillborn son. Three-year-old Dorothea and her sister and brother followed their exiled parents to Veere in Zeeland, the Netherlands, and were taken care of by the Dutch regents, their grandaunt and aunt, Margaret of Austria and Mary of Hungary. Her mother died when she was five years old, on 19 January 1526. The Dutch court was an officially Catholic environment, but influenced with a sympathy for Protestantism, and Dorothea herself acquired Protestant sympathies early on.Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon. KVinfo.dk Dorothea was the object for marriage proposals very early. She has been described mostly in comparison with her sister, and referred to as beautiful, shorter and slighter than her sister. In 1527, Wolsey proposed the Duke of Richmond as a match for either Dorothea or Christina, but this proposal was not accepted by the Habsburgs because Richmond was illegitimate. Her brother Hans died in 1532 at about fourteen years old. As the eldest surviving child of the abdicated Christian II, Dorothea had a claim to the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish thrones. Because of this, King Frederick of Denmark suggested that Dorothea marry his youngest son, Prince John, after which he would name John his heir and leave his eldest son and current heir Christian as heir to the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein instead. This was rejected by the Emperor and regent Mary because they did not wish to negotiate with Frederick, whom they regarded as an usurper. The matter became moot when Frederick died in 1533. In 1532, she received a proposal from the Duke of Milan, but the Emperor chose her sister for that match instead. Dorothea was long expected to marry King James V of Scotland, but the plan was never brought to fruition in fear of offending the French monarch, who wished for James to make a French match, compounded with the difficulty of finding a suitable dowry for her. =Marriage= On 18 May 1535, Dorothea married Frederick of the Palatinate in Brussels, and then in person in Heidelberg, from which they continued to their home in Neumarkt. Frederick had served as a loyal ally of the Emperor, and long desired to marry into the Imperial house. However, his proposals to the Emperor's sisters and nieces had been rejected. To prevent him from entering a French match, the Emperor's brother suggested he propose to Dorothea, who was a ward of the Emperor. Mary of Hungary, Regent of the Netherlands and foster mother of Dorothea, supported the match as a way of supporting Dorothea's claims on the Danish throne and thereby bolstering Imperial influence in northern Europe. At the time of the marriage, the succession of Christian III of Denmark was contested, there was a war in Denmark and Copenhagen was occupied by the Hanseatic League. The Habsburg family selected Frederick to be her consort, as they believed that he could successfully claim the Danish throne through marriage. After the election of Christian III of Denmark to the Danish throne in 1536, however, her chance of succeeding to the Danish throne was realistically over.Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon. KVinfo.dk The Emperor was not very interested in the matter of Denmark. Dorothea became popular in the Palatinate. She had a good relationship with Frederick and his family. The couple had similar characters, shared a love for adventure and festivities, and she \\"was always ready to accompany him on perilous journeys, to climb mountains or ford rivers, with the same unquenchable courage and gaiety of heart.\\"Julia Cartwright: Christina of Denmark. Duchess of Milan and Lorraine. 1522-1590, New York, 1913 She had no children. In her anxiety to conceive, she went on pilgrimages and wore holy girdles: \\"this was done without any spirit of devotion, but with great mirth and laughter.\\"Julia Cartwright: Christina of Denmark. Duchess of Milan and Lorraine. 1522-1590, New York, 1913 In 1537‚Äì38, she hosted her sister Christina, the Dowager Duchess of Milan, during her journey back to the Netherlands from Italy. Dorothea and Frederick were described as great spendthrifts, and it was said that she was not happy until she had spent her last penny.Julia Cartwright: Christina of Denmark. Duchess of Milan and Lorraine. 1522-1590, New York, 1913 As Frederick was of the same character, their common waste of money indebted them greatly.Julia Cartwright: Christina of Denmark. Duchess of Milan and Lorraine. 1522-1590, New York, 1913 Frederick and Dorothea never gave up her claim to the throne of Denmark, and worked actively to have the Emperor support it. In 1539, they visited the Emperor in Spain to press the matter, but without success. Dorothea was a personal friend of the Empress, Isabella of Portugal, and when Isabella died that same year, they lost an ally in their attempts to persuade the Emperor. The couple visited the French court on their way back to the Netherlands, where Dorothea attracted the attention of the French king to such a degree that her relative the Queen of France, Eleanor of Austria, reportedly kept to her side at all times to prevent her from becoming the lover of the King.Julia Cartwright: Christina of Denmark. Duchess of Milan and Lorraine. 1522-1590, New York, 1913 In 1540, Dorothea supported her sister Christina's desired love marriage to Ren√©, Prince of Orange. In February 1540, Dorothea was commissioned by Frederick to visit and plead her father's cause with the Emperor, to prevent a renewal of the truce between the Netherlands and King Christian III. After consulting Archbishop Carondelet, the President of the council, and Granvelle, Dorothea and Christina sent the following petition to the Emperor: \\"My sister and I, your humble and loving children, entreat you, as the fountain of all justice, to have compassion on us. Open the prison doors, which you alone are able to do, release my father, and give me advice as to how I may best obtain the kingdom which belongs to me by the laws of God and man.\\"Julia Cartwright: Christina of Denmark. Duchess of Milan and Lorraine. 1522-1590, New York, 1913 The appeal was however unsuccessful. In 1544, Frederick became Elector Palatine. The Emperor officially acknowledged Christian III of Denmark the same year, but Frederick continued to press her claim. She attended the funeral of her sister's spouse, Francis of Lorraine, in Nancy. At Christmas of 1546 Frederick and Dorothea took communion in the Protestant way in Heidelberg, which provoked the Emperor's displeasure. For a while, Frederick took the side of the Protestant opposition. However, he soon rejoined the Emperor's Catholic cause. After this, Dorothea and Frederick prevented the introduction of Protestant Reformation. Dorothea held Lutheran sympathies her entire life. In 1551, Dorothea and Frederick made an official visit to Lorraine. =Later life= In 1556, Frederick died, nursed by Dorothea. She sent for his successor, Otto Henry, Elector Palatine. Otto Henry introduced the Protestant Reformation, which Dorothea supported. When she visited her sister in the Netherlands in 1557, it was said of her that she: \\"is known to be a Lutheran and against the Emperor, and is as much hated here as her sister Christina is beloved.\\"Julia Cartwright: Christina of Denmark. Duchess of Milan and Lorraine. 1522-1590, New York, 1913 The former Emperor Charles V instructed his son Philip to invite Dorothea to stay in the Netherlands so that she may become Catholic again, and Christina also attempted to persuade her to do so, but Dorothea refused. As a widow, she lived in retirement in the Palatine castle in Neuburg. There were considerations of marriage to a son of Philip of Hesse, or to Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, but none came to fruition, and the latter died in 1557. At the death of her father in his prison in Denmark in 1559, Dorothea assumed the title of Queen of Denmark. However, as a childless widow beyond the usual childbearing age, Dorothea was no longer considered politically useful. The Danish loyalists, headed by Peder Oxe, therefore asked Christina to persuade Dorothea to surrender her claims to Christina and her son. In 1561, Christina visited Dorothea, and reportedly did so.

The parish is on the county boundary with Derbyshire and about south of Derby. The 2011 Census (including Lount) recorded the parish's population as 141. A brook flows from the south through the parish, heading for the River Trent which it joins about to the north. In the parish the brook is dammed to form a pair of small lakes. Nikolaus Pevsner (later Sir Nikolaus) described the view westwards across the lakes to Staunton Harold Hall and Holy Trinity parish church as \\"unsurpassed in the country ‚Äì certainly as far as Englishness is concerned\\". Downstream from Staunton Harold, just over over the boundary in Derbyshire, the brook is dammed again to form Staunton Harold Reservoir. Most of the reservoir is in the Derbyshire parish of Melbourne, but part of the upper reach of one arm of the reservoir is in Staunton Harold parish. Estate and Hall The estate was the seat of the Shirley family. George Shirley (1559‚Äì1622) was created 1st Baronet in 1611. Sir Robert Shirley, 5th Baronet (1650‚Äì1717) was created 14th Baron Ferrers of Chartley in 1677 and 1st Earl Ferrers in 1711. Staunton Harold Hall is a country house that was originally Jacobean, but the 13th Baron had it enlarged in about 1700. Washington Shirley, 5th Earl Ferrers had the present Palladian east front added in 1763. It is of two storeys and eleven bays, eight of which are red brick. The three central bays are ashlar and pedimented, with engaged columns of two orders: Tuscan on the ground floor and Ionic on the first floor. Holy Trinity Chapel Holy Trinity Chapel seen from the north By AD 1122 the Augustinian Priory of Breedon on the Hill had a dependent chapelry at Staunton. Breedon was a house of Nostell Priory, which surrendered all its properties to the Crown in 1539 in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Sir Robert Shirley, 4th Baronet had the present Church of England chapel of the Holy Trinity built in 1653. It is unusual for being built during the Commonwealth era and a notable example of Gothic survival architecture. Two inscriptions commemorate Sir Robert's efforts. One is in the chancel and reads Sir Robert Shirley Baronet Founder of this church anno domini 1653 on whose soul God hath mercy. The other is over the entrance and reads > When all things sacred were throughout ye nation Either demollisht or > profaned Sir Robert Shirley Barronet founded this Church whose singular > praise it is to have done ye best things in ye worst times And hoped them in > the most callamitous. The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance. Sir Robert did not manage to have the chapel completed: the Commonwealth authorities imprisoned him in the Tower of London and he died there in 1656. After the Restoration of the Monarchy Richard Shepheard completed the chapel in 1665 for the young Sir Seymour Shirley, 5th Baronet (1647‚Äì67). The exterior of the chapel is substantially buttressed, battlemented and pinnacled. The nave has a clerestory with square-headed Perpendicular Gothic windows. It is flanked by north and south aisles with windows of an earlier 14th century style and arcades of three bays. Although the architecture is Gothic the furnishings are Jacobean, including extensive panelling, box pews, the pulpit and a west gallery with an organ that predates the chapel. In the chancel is a monument with the white marble semi-reclining figure of Robert Shirley, Viscount Tamworth, who died in 1714. The west tower is of three stages divided by string courses and has a ring of eight bells. George I Oldfield of Nottingham cast the fourth, fifth and sixth bells in 1669 and Immanuel Halton of South Wingfield, Derbyshire cast the third in 1717. Thomas I Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the treble, second, seventh and tenor bells in 1831. For technical reasons the bells are currently unringable. In 1953 John Betjeman, later Sir John Betjeman, recorded on gramophone records, a talk broadcast by BBC Radio on 30 December 1953. It celebrated the Tercentenary of the founding of the Church. While extolling the beauty of the Church and praising the \\"Catholic and reformed \\" Church of England he railed a little against Oliver Cromwell and the Puritans.Betjeman On Faith, ed. K.J.Gardener, page 98, Pub. SPCK, 2011. . Staunton Harold is part of the Benefice of the Church of St Mary and St Hardulph, Breedon on the Hill.

Description These mites are characterized by a very small size (about 600‚Äì900 ¬µm in length) and a close association to arthropodes, mainly insects. A morphologically specialized instar, the deutonymph (earlier \\"hypopus\\"), is adapted to attach e.g. insects for a phoretic transport from one habitat to another. The mites use different insect groups as phoretic carriers such as beetles, flies and Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps). In all species, the digitus mobilis of the chelicera is reduced to small rests, and the distal pedipalp article is connected to a more or less complex membranous structure. These mouthpart modifications form an organ to feed bacteria. Habitats are colonized by the mites such as animal dung, compost, waterfilled treeholes or the fluids of Nepenthes and Sarracenia - pitcher plants.

The population of the civil parish was 131 at the 2001 census, rising to 165 at the 2011 census. It should not be confused with another Normanton in the county which is near Bottesford. The name, which in Old English means the settlement of Northmen on the heath,Watts, Victor et al., (2004) The Cambridge Dictionary of Place Names, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. suggests that the current village was probably an English village taken over by a group of Norse or Danish settlers at the time of the original Viking settlement, and this fits well into the overall pattern of land occupation in the area. It lies on the edge of the great heath that once stretched Westwards from the edge of Charnwood Forest, something which is reflected in the names of a number of other settlements in the area, such as Heather and Donington le Heath. There are, however, signs of significant earlier land usage in the parish. Near to the boundary with Heather and Ravenstone an Iron Age settlement has been discovered. Equally, the newly discovered Roman road from Leicester to Chester has been discovered running through the centre of Normanton. Just over the parish boundary in the southern Ravenstone area there was a small Roman town. A track called the Swepstone Way can be traced running from the Iron Age settlement all the way to Tamworth. The Salt Way which ran through Measham can also be traced to Normanton. It is not totally implausible to suggest that a road/track ran through the centre from Ancaster to Wall. If this is correct it would suggest that this track was of Roman origin. However, this is very much a speculative road at the moment. The settlement is not mentioned in the Domesday Book and the first mention we have is in 1209. Much of the land in the early Middle Ages to the north was known to be woodland or heathland. Coal mining formed part of the economy of the area from a very early period and mines have been found at the abandoned village of Alton to the north of Normanton. To the east of the village was the Long Moor open cast coal mine managed by UK Coal. Over a three-year period from 2007 to 2010 this extracted 725,000 tons of coal.UK Coal case study by Hepworth Acoustics accessed 12 April 2012 Following restoration, the mine site has been acquired by the Woodland Trust.

It was one of Hollywood's few attempts to depict Australian history. Plot In the 1840s, Captain Michael Fury (Brian Aherne) is an Irish patriot transported to New South Wales for his political involvement. He is farmed out as an servant to Arnold Trist, a cruel land owner who uses whipping to keep discipline. He is accompanied by fellow convicts Blackie, Coughy and Bertie. Fury escapes from prison and meets Jeannette Dupre, the daughter of strict Mennonite Fran√ßois Dupre. Fury discovers that Trist is trying to drive settlers from the area to take over their land. Fury organises the settlers to take action against Trist. He returns to prison to recruit convicts to help settlers. Trist's men attack the Bailey ranch. Fury, helped by Blackie, Coughy and Bertie, oppose them. Jeanette begins to fall in love with Fury. Her father forbids her to see him, so she runs away. Dupre then tells Trist where Fury can be found. Trist double crosses Dupre and imprisons him. Fury and his men narrowly escape an ambush from Trist's men. Dupre's house is burnt down and a charred body is discovered in the ruins. Fury is arrested for Dupre's murder and sentenced to hang. However Blackie hears Dupre calling from his cell, rescues him and presents him to the Governor. Trist is exposed. He attempts to escape but is shot by a dying Coughy. The Governor grants Fury a pardon and places Blackie and Bertie in his custody.

Release was to be through United Artists. Aherne made the film as the second in a two-picture deal with Roach the first being Merrily We Live. (Aherne later wrote in his memoirs that the novel Roach wanted to adapt was For the Term of His Natural Life. He may have gotten the novels mistaken.Ahenre p 280) Ahenre said his fee was $40,000.Aherne p 281 In July 1938 it was announced Roach had abandoned plans to make Robbery Under Arms and would instead be filming Captain Midnight with Aherne and Sullavan, directed by John G. Blystone. Geza Herczig and Jack Jevne were writing a script, reports stating \\"the title role is a variation of Captain Starlight in the original.\\" Plans to make Robbery Under Arms had been dropped apparently out of fear of offending Australians. There also may have been an issue with the rights to the novel, which were held by Cinesound Productions. The eventual script was not based on any particular bushranger.author=In October, Roach announced that Norman McLeod would direct and Francine Bourdeaux would play the female lead instead of Sullavan. Bourdeaux was eventually replaced by June Lang and Roach would direct himself. Joseph Calleia was meant to play Coughy; he dropped out and was replaced by John Carradine who was borrowed from 20th Century Fox. W. P. Lipscomb was reported as working on the script. Australian politician Sir Earle Page visited Hal Roach studios in August 1938 and promised to assist the movie by sending over some koalas and eucalyptus trees. =Shooting= Filming was delayed because June Lang had an infected throat. It took place near Malibu Beach. Four kookaburras were hired from Catalina Island Bird Park but refused to laugh during filming. Some location work was done on Santa Cruz Island. Both Brian Aherne and Victor McLaglen had toured Australia with stage shows and were anxious for the film to be as accurate as possible. Frank Baker, brother of Snowy Baker, acted as technical adviser. A few Australians were in the cast, including Billy Bevan and Frank Hagney. Aherne said that Hal Roach improvised the story \\"from day to day... giving the cast dialogue out of his head as he went along, line by line.\\"Aherne p 280) Ahenre was not used to working this way but says Roach was always polite to him as \\"I don't think he has ever worked with legtimiate actors before and he is a little in awe of me.\\"Aherne p 281 Release The film was previewed at the Australian pavilion of the British Empire building at the New York World Fair. Reception =Box office= Aherne later wrote that \\"Captain Fury seemed like such a farrago of nonsense to me that I was very happy to know that Juarez would rescue me by coming out at about the same time. Well, Juarez turned out to be a highly respected box-office flop while Captain Fury cleaned up and went on playing all over the world for many years with countless television runs.\\"Aherne p 282 =Critical= Variety called it a \\"lusty outdoor melodrama on the familiar Robin Hood format. There's action, gunplay, fast riding, surprise attacks, some broad comedy and a' few dashes of romance. Geared to catch adventure-nUnded audiences, picture will do pretty good biz in the keys, but will hit a more profitable stride in the subsequents... Story and direction provide lusty drama concocted in the old style. There are no detours for subleties or development of. characters. Yarn is a familiar westiern in setup, but switch of locale to ihe Australian bush country gives the rugged and easily-distinguished plot a freshness which will be generally accepted.\\"Review of film at Variety The Los Angeles Times said the film would \\"amuse and entertain audiences in first rate fashion.\\" A later review from the same paper criticised Roach's direction saying \\"he has learned nothing and forgotten nothing since earliest slapstick days\\" and that \\"the plot is a cartoon of Captain Blood, the only novelty being that Australia instead of the West Indies is the background.\\" The New York Times called it \\"an amusingly old-fashioned Western melodrama.\\" Reviewer Stephen Vagg commented \\"The Australian setting is not really emphasised, it's just the usual immigrant settlers and evil land baron that you‚Äôd see in the old West.\\" =Awards= The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Art Direction by Charles D.

Manu's wife Indu (Shobhana) realises that the police have been influenced by her brother Hari (K. B. Ganesh Kumar) who seems to know the kidnappers. Indu decides to call her best friend Sagar to help find her husband. Sagar calls his best henchmen from all over Kerala for the job. The gang then travels to Goa where Sagar's contact tells him that the kidnappers are the Rosario brothers (Sampath Raj and Shereveer Vakil) who run the most powerful gang in the Goa underworld. After considerable difficulties, Sagar and his gang locate the night club where Manu is held hostage and helps him to escape.

Swami was working on the script of Baba Kalyani, its producer Antony Perumbavoor approached him with the idea of remaking Swami's earlier work Irupatham Noottandu. Swami contemplated the possibilities for a sequel. In the final events of the first film, the villain Shekharankutty died and Sagar is in Jail. Antony asked him after two years, and Swami suggested taking only the character Sagar and making a completely new film, neither a continuation nor a sequel. In Irupatham Noottandu, Sagar was an introvert who rarely smiles. Now, although the character has aged he is doing something that is not socially accepted.  Soundtrack  The film's soundtrack features six songs composed by Gopi Sundar, with lyrics by Gopi Sundar, Jofy Tharakan, Santhosh Varma and Riya Joy. The soundtrack was released by Manorama Music.

He was born in Nancy, France on 18 August 1896 and died c. 1950. Auscher was a pupil at l‚ÄôEcole des Arts Decoratifs in Paris. His work was exhibited at Le Salon d'Automne and Le Salon des Tuileries between 1923 and 1933. His most characteristic work recorded the life \\"des Annees Folles\\" in the Paris of the 1920s, including scenes in the casinos, gambling clubs and dance halls, evoking the decadence of the demimonde. He also recorded the theatrical community with portraits of actors, some in their famous roles, such as Louis Jouvet as \\"Le Trouhadec indigne\\" and the clown Grock. His best-known work appeared in limited edition folios published by the artist himself (La Faune des Dancings, 1925 and Le Baccara, C 1926). Many copies of the lithographs contained in these were heightened with watercolor. He contributed to the satirical journal Le Rire (\\"Laughter\\"); he also illustrated works by Ir√®ne N√©mirovsky, who was rediscovered when Suite Francaise was republished in 2004. Andre Haguenauer (Les Amertumes (Bitterness), 1925) and (Printemps Sexuel) provided Auscher with subject matter that was again towards the margins of conventional attitudes to sexuality. Auscher later illustrated the court proceedings taken against the collaborationist French government after World War II, including those against Marshal Philippe P√©tain, Charles Maurras, and Pierre Laval. 1896 births Year of death missing 20th-century French artists French caricaturists French illustrators ","title":"Jean Auscher"},{"id":"20631908","text":"Chilcote is a village and civil parish in the North West Leicestershire district of Leicestershire, England.

Fox News reported that Shah communicated with gunmen over the telephone and helped direct their activities as he watched the events unfold on television. On December 10, 2008, Pakistan announced the arrest of Shah for his role in the Mumbai attacks. On December 31, 2008, it was announced that Shah had confessed LeT's involvement as well as his own central role in the attack. According to Pakistani officials, Shah's interrogation confirmed most of the details that had been obtained from the only captured gunman. On February 12, 2009, Rehman Malik, adviser to the prime minister on the interior, stated that Shah was still in custody and that he allegedly wrote the emails claiming responsibility for the attacks. Investigations of Shah's computer and email accounts revealed a list of 320 locations worldwide deemed as possible targets for terrorist attacks similar to the November 2008 strikes in Mumbai. Only 20 of the targets were locations within India.

Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Dual enrollment The high school offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities at their high school. Highlands has partnered with Penn State New Kensington and Community College of Allegheny County (CCAC). The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. For the 2009-10 funding year, the school district received a state grant of $23,672 for the program. Graduation requirements The Highlands School Board requires that a student earn 24.2 credits to graduate, including 4 English credits, 4 Mathematics credits, 4 Science credits, 4 Social Studies credits, 2 Arts and Humanities credits, 2.2 Health/Phys. Ed. credits, and 4 Electives credits. Every student must successfully complete one credit of English, math and social studies every year. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor, and its expectations are set by the individual school district. At Highlands High School, students are required to complete a career portfolio over four years. It includes individual and group projects, visitations to post-secondary schools, community service hours, and career job shadowing, coupled with career awareness activities.

Sixteen-year-old Highlands student and soccer player Austin Babinsack, who has autism, was duct-taped to the goalpost by two 17-year-old classmates and fellow members of the school soccer team. He was left there for 15 to 20 minutes until passers-by noticed and freed him. Soccer coach Jim Turner and the two students were suspended for at least five days. The majority of staff and students united with the soccer players, as they felt there was no ill intentions and believed that the media as well as Austin's mother were trying to exploit the situation and make it into something it was not.

After 32 years of military service, in 1842 he was assigned the rank of Feldmarschallleutnant. In 1848, the circumstance that, as a member of the upper echelons of the Hungarian nobility, he had been entrusted with Hungarian relations with Austria brought him the difficult, but also distinguished, assignment as imperial commissioner charged with bringing about a peaceful adjustment between the emperor and the people. But before his arrival in Pest, Kossuth had incited the legislature to forbid his taking office as palatine of Hungary, and the army was instructed not to obey him. His assignment was without ministerial countersign. After his arrival in Pest, and a short and fruitless discussion with General Hrabowsky, he took a cab to a fortification. While crossing the Danube on the pontoon bridge, a mob which had been advised of his arrival fell upon the cab, murdered Lamberg, mutilated the body, and triumphantly carried it, impaled on scythes, to the disabled soldiers' home. Lamberg's death marked a turning point in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, as the Imperial Court in Vienna decided to dissolve the Hungarian Parliament and send in the troops of Josip Jelaƒçiƒá into Hungary. Family and children With Countess Caroline Hoyos, he had at least two children: * a son, father of Countess Ladislaja von Lamberg; * Countess Theresia von Lamberg, who married Franz, Count of Meran, and had issue.

Mauricio is also a former World Champion of the World Jiu-Jitsu Championship World Championship, Results held by the International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF). Living close to the beautiful beaches in Brazil, Mauricio's hobby was surfing, but once he experienced Jiu-Jitsu, he fell in love with the sport. Mauricio's first experience with the martial arts was not Jiu-Jitsu. When he was seven, he began practicing Judo at Clube do Flamengo, in Rio de Janeiro. At the age of fifteen, Mauricio began to practice Muay Thai. A few months later, a friend invited him to visit a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu academy, and for Mauricio, it began a lifelong journey studying the world's most effective fighting and self-defense system. Almost immediately after becoming a Jiu-Jitsu student, Mauricio began to compete at local and regional tournaments in Brazil. Later, he began to assist Professor Royler Gracie with classes, developing his passion for teaching. He won many major tournaments including the 1996 World Jiu-Jitsu Championship. In 1997, Mauricio accomplished a lifelong dream, receiving his black belt from the hands of his professor, Royler Gracie. In 2002 Mauricio moved to south Florida. Recognizing the opportunity to build a small business in the United States, he decided to continue teaching his style of Jiu-Jitsu in the Palm Beach County, Florida area. Since 2002, Mauricio has been developing and expanding Brazilian Jiu- Jitsu in the West Palm Beach area where he lives and operates an academy in Wellington. With an expanding academy, Professor Villardo has also continued his success in competition. In 2009 he won a silver medal at the IBJJF PAN Championships in California.

A bear attack is an attack by any mammal of the family Ursidae, on another animal, although it usually refers to bears attacking humans or domestic pets. Bear attacks are of particular concern for those who are in bear habitats. They can be fatal and often hikers, hunters, fishers, and others in bear country take precautions against bear attacks. Stephen Herrero, a Canadian biologist, reports that during the 1990s, bears killed around three people a year in the U.S. and Canada, as compared to the 15 people killed every year by dogs.Fergus, Charles. Wild Guide: Bears, p. 97 These numbers are averages over the entire U.S. population, most of whom do not live in bear habitats; for those who do, the risk of a lethal bear attack is much higher. History of human‚Äìbear relationships A drum or barrel trap used to safely relocate bears parked adjacent to a building in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, United States Bear bells for the sightseers in Goshiki-numa, Japan According to Wild Bears of the Worlds, by Paul Ward and Suzanne Kynaston, human contact with bears has existed since the time of the Neanderthals and the European cave bear around 200,000 to 75,000 years ago.Ward, Paul and Suzanne Kynaston. Wild Bears of the World p. 9 There is some evidence of cave bear worship during these early years: between the years 1917 and 1922, Emil Bachler discovered a large stone chest filled with cave bear skulls in the Drachenloch Cave, one of the Wildkirchli; between 1916 and 1922, Konrad Hormann found narrow niches filled with five cave bear skulls. Ward and Kynaston go on to report that Cro-Magnon humans, who first appeared nearly 35,000 years ago, show more obvious evidence of cave bear worship in the forms of paintings, sculptures, and engravings; however, there is still some doubt as to whether these works specifically depict the cave bear or the European brown bear.Ward, Paul and Suzanne Kynaston. Wild Bears of the World pp. 9-10 In the 1900s, bear populations had been decreasing because of increased hunting of bears for sustenance (done mostly by native peoples such as the Inupiat of Alaska and the Inuvialuit of Canada) and for trophy prizes.Ward, Paul and Suzanne Kynaston. Wild Bears of the World p. 176 Polar bear skins became popular as a sign of wealth and prestige, especially in Europe during the Victorian era.Ward, Paul and Suzanne Kynaston. Wild Bears of the World p. 174 Comparatively, the pelts of giant panda, were also highly valued, priced at around 176,000 U.S. dollars.Ward, Paul and Suzanne Kynaston. Wild Bears of the World p. 177 Settlers, indigenous, villagers and farmers defended their families and livestock by killing the local predators, including bears. This practice is still in place where necessary and legal. More recently, laws have been instated to protect the dwindling populations of bears; however, as stated in Return of the Grizzly by David Whitman, these laws have increased the tensions between bears and humans. While this allows bear populations to recuperate, it also prevents people from killing bears that have invaded their property and killed their livestock.Whitman, David. The Return of the Grizzly p. 28 Species, and respective aggressiveness =American black bears= American black bears are abundant in much of North America. In the US and Canada, from 1,000 to 200,000 black bears per state/ province, as of a 1996 count. Only 7 states had none.https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/Traf-121.pdf black bear to a car door in Yosemite Valley Unlike grizzly bears, which became a subject of fearsome legend among the European settlers of North America, black bears were rarely considered overly dangerous, even though they lived in areas where the pioneers had settled. Black bears rarely attack when confronted by humans, and usually limit themselves to making mock charges, emitting blowing noises and swatting the ground with their forepaws. According to Stephen Herrero in his Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance, 23 people were killed by black bears from 1900 to 1980. The number of black bear attacks on humans is higher than those of brown bears, though this is largely because black bears outnumber brown bears rather than being more aggressive. Compared to brown bear attacks, violent encounters with black bears rarely lead to serious injury and death. However, the majority of black bear attacks tend to be motivated by hunger rather than territoriality, and thus victims have a higher probability of surviving by fighting back rather than submitting. Unlike grizzlies, female black bears do not display the same level of protectiveness to their cubs, and will seldom attack humans in their vicinity. The worst recorded fatality incident occurred in May 1978, in which a black bear killed three teenagers fishing in Algonquin Park in Canada. The majority of attacks happened in national parks, usually near campgrounds, where the bears had become habituated to human contact and food. Between 1964 and 1976 in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, there were 1,028 documented incidents of black bears acting aggressively toward people, 107 of which resulted in injury. These incidents occurred mainly in tourist hotspots, where people regularly fed the bears handouts. =Asian black bears= An Asian black bear, shot after charging the \\"Old Shekarry\\", as illustrated in Wild sports of the world: a boy's book of natural history and adventure Though usually shy and cautious animals, Asian black bears are more aggressive toward humans than the brown bears of Eurasia.Bear Anatomy and Physiology from Gary Brown's The Great Bear Almanac, Lyons & Burford, Publishers, 1993 According to Brigadier General R.G. Burton: E. T. Vere of Srinagar, Kashmir wrote of how his hospital received dozens of black bear victims annually. He wrote that, when attacking humans, black bears will rear up on their hind legs and knock victims over with their paws. They then make one or two bites on an arm or leg and finish with a snap to the head, this being the most dangerous part of the attack. There are no records of predation on humans by Asiatic black bears in Russia\\"Human-bear interactions\\" from Status and management of the Asiatic black bear in Russia by Igor Chestin and Victor Yudin in Asiatic Black Bear Conservation Action Plan, chapter 10 of Bears: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan compiled by Christopher Servheen, Stephen Herrero and Bernard Peyton, published by IUCN/SSC Bear Specialist Group and no conflicts have been documented in Taiwan.\\"Human-bear interactions\\" from Status and management of the Formosan black bear in Taiwan by Ying Wang in Asiatic Black Bear Conservation Action Plan, chapter 10 of Bears: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan compiled by Christopher Servheen, Stephen Herrero and Bernard Peyton, published by IUCN/SSC Bear Specialist Group However, in India, attacks on humans have been increasing yearly and have occurred largely in the northwestern and western Himalayan region. In the Chamba District of Himachal Pradesh, the number of black bear attacks on humans has gradually increased from 10 in 1988‚Äì89 to 21 in 1991‚Äì92.\\"Human-bear interactions\\" from Status and management of the Asiatic black bear in India by S. Sathyakumar in Asiatic Black Bear Conservation Action Plan, chapter 10 of Bears: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan compiled by Christopher Servheen, Stephen Herrero and Bernard Peyton, published by IUCN/SSC Bear Specialist Group Recent bear attacks on humans have been reported from Junbesi and Langtang National Park in Nepal, and occurred in villages as well as in the surrounding forest. Li Guoxing, the second person in history to have received a facial transplant, was a victim of a black bear attack. Nine people were killed by black bears in Japan between 1979 and 1989, and more recently, in September 2009, it was reported that a black bear attacked a group of tourists, seriously injuring four, while they were waiting at a bus station in the built-up area of Takayama, Gifu in central Japan. The majority of attacks tend to occur when black bears are encountered suddenly, and at close quarters. Because of this, black bears are generally considered more dangerous than sympatric brown bears, which live in more open spaces and are thus less likely to be surprised by approaching humans.A Book of Man Eaters by Brigadier General R. G. Burton, Mittal Publications They are also likely to attack when protecting food.\\"Bear Behaviour and Activities\\" from Gary Brown's The Great Bear Almanac, Lyons & Burford, Publishers, 1993 =Brown bears= Illustration of a brown bear attacking Russian hunters As a rule, brown bears seldom attack humans on sight, and usually avoid people. They are, however, unpredictable in temperament, and will attack if they are surprised or feel threatened.Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance by Stephen Herrero, Hurtig Publishers Ltd./ Edmonton 1985 Sows with cubs account for the majority of injuries and fatalities in North America. Habituated or food conditioned bears can also be dangerous, as their long-term exposure to humans causes them to lose their natural shyness, and in some cases associate humans with food. Small parties of one or two people are more often attacked than large groups, with no attacks being recorded against parties of more than seven people. In contrast to injuries caused by American black bears, which are usually minor, brown bear attacks tend to result in serious injury and in some cases death. In the majority of attacks resulting in injury, brown bears precede the attack with a growl or huffing sound, and seem to confront humans as they would when fighting other bears: they rise up on their hind legs, and attempt to \\"disarm\\" their victims by biting and holding on to the lower jaw to avoid being bitten in turn. Such a bite can be more severe than that of a tiger, and has been known to crush the heads of some human victims.The living animals of the world; a popular natural history with one thousand illustrations Volume 1: Mammals, by Cornish, C. J., 1858-1906; Selous, Frederick Courteney, 1851-1917; Johnston, Harry Hamilton, Sir, 1858-1927; Maxwell, Herbert, Sir, published by New York, Dodd, Mead and Company] Most attacks occur in the months of July, August and September, the time when the number of outdoor recreationalists, such as hikers or hunters, is higher. People who assert their presence through noises tend to be less vulnerable, as they alert bears to their presence. In direct confrontations, people who run are statistically more likely to be attacked than those who stand their ground. Violent encounters with brown bears usually last only a few minutes, though they can be prolonged if the victims fight back. Attacks on humans are considered extremely rare in the former Soviet Union, though exceptions exist in districts where they are not pursued by hunters.Mammals of the Soviet Union Vol. II Part 1a, Sirenia and Carnivora (Sea cows; Wolves and Bears), V. G. Heptner and N. P. Naumov editors, Science Publishers, Inc. USA. 1998. East Siberian brown bears for example tend to be much bolder toward humans than their shyer, more frequently hunted European counterparts.Wolves, Bears and Human Anti-predator Adaptations In 2008, a platinum mining compound in the Olyotorsky district of northern Kamchatka was besieged by a group of 30 Kamchatka brown bears that killed two guards and prevented workers from leaving their homes. In Scandinavia, only three fatal attacks were recorded in the 20th century. Due to increasing brown bear population in Turkey, attacks still occur in mountainous areas of Northeastern Turkey. Native American tribes whose territories overlapped with those of grizzly bears often viewed them with a mixture of awe and fear. North American brown bears were so feared by the Natives that they were rarely hunted, especially alone. When Natives hunted grizzlies, the act was done with the same preparation and ceremoniality as intertribal warfare, and was never done except with a company of 4 to 10 warriors. The tribe members who dealt the killing blow were highly esteemed among their compatriots. Californian Indians actively avoided prime bear habitat, and would not allow their young men to hunt alone, for fear of bear attacks. During the Spanish colonial period, some tribes, instead of hunting grizzlies themselves, would seek aid from European colonists to deal with problem bears. Many authors in the American west wrote of Natives or voyagers with lacerated faces and missing noses or eyes due to attacks from grizzlies. Within Yellowstone National Park, injuries caused by grizzly attacks in developed areas averaged approximately 1 per year during the 1930s through the 1950s, though it increased to 4 per year during the 1960s. They then decreased to 1 injury every 2 years (0.5/year) during the 1970s. Between 1980‚Äì2002, there were only 2 grizzly bear-caused human injuries in a developed area. However, although grizzly attacks were rare in the back-country before 1970, the number of attacks increased to an average of approximately 1 per year during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. According to bear biologist Charles Jonkel, one reason for bear attacks is the lack of important foods such as huckleberry, buffalo berry, and white-bark pine nut. Winter freezes may be one reason for the food shortages. =Polar bears= Polar bear attacks on humans are extremely rare, and according to records by James Wilder, out of 73 fatal bear attacks between 1870 and 2014, only 20 have been the result of polar bears. Polar bear attacks can also happen in captivity. =Sloth bears= In some areas of India and Burma, sloth bears are more feared than tigers, due to their unpredictable temperament. In Madhya Pradesh, sloth bear attacks accounted for the deaths of 48 people and the injuring of 686 others between the years 1989 and 1994, probably due in part to the density of population and competition for food sources.Wolf Trust - Wolves Killing People - Perspective (www.wolftrust.org.uk/a-wkp8-perspective.html) One specimen, known as the sloth bear of Mysore, was single-handedly responsible for the deaths of 12 people and the mutilation of 2 dozen others before being shot by Kenneth Anderson. Sloth bears defend themselves when surprised, with the majority of confrontations occurring at night. They typically charge on all fours with their head held low, before rearing on their hind legs and striking at their attackers with their claws and teeth. Natural weapons and armor The various species of bear are well-developed for survival, both for attaining food and defending against predators, including unarmed humans. The different species all have the same general physical characteristics and senses that allow them to adapt to situations that threaten their survival. =Fur= A bear's fur is often very thick, and it can function much like armor. In situations between bears and other predators, such as humans, this thick fur acts with the bear's thick skin and layers of fat as a buffer against most physical attacks, sometimes buffering to some extent even against firearms.Brandt, Anthony. Attack p. 46 According to Charles Fergus' Wild Guide: Bears, bear fur is also a source of insulation that allows bears to inhabit almost any habitat, from the hot jungles inhabited by sun bears and sloth bears to the frozen tundra inhabited by polar bears, thus occupying most of the same territory as humanity.Fergus, Charles. Wild Guide: Bears p. 1 =Muscle= A bear's muscular structure is highly suited for strength and power. Polar bears are known to swim for kilometers in search of food and to scoop seals out of the water. Grizzly bears can bring down prey, such as bison or moose, that outweigh the bear by several hundred kilograms and can steal kills from entire packs of wolves. Their top speed running on all fours has been reported to be around ;Fergus, Charles. Wild Guide: Bears pp. 1-2Whitman, David. \\"The Return of the Grizzly\\" pp. 26, 28 comparatively, Usain Bolt ran at a record-breaking speed of at the 2008 Summer Olympics.\\"Usain Bolt 100m 10 meter Splits and Speed Endurance\\" by Jimson Lee, dated August 22, 2008 Retrieved on July 1, 2009. Most people are incapable of reaching speeds even remotely close to this number; thus, it is impossible for a human to outrun a bear. =Claws= Claws and pawprints of an American black bear (left) and brown bear Bears have five digits on each dextrous paw, each digit with a long non-retractable claw. The shape of the claw differs between the bear species: black bear claws are strong and curved, which allows them to claw at tree bark; grizzly bear claws are long and straight, ideal for digging, and can be up to long;Fergus, Charles. Wild Guide: Bears p. 7Whitman, David. The Return of the Grizzly p. 26 polar bear claws are thick and sharp for holding the slippery skins of seals. =Jaws= The jaws of a bear reflect its omnivorous eating habits. A bear has forty-two teeth, with canines, which can be even longer than those of a tiger. While a bear's canines can pierce flesh and tear meat, a bear's back teeth are relatively flat, better suited for eating plants rather than meat. However, the jaws of bears are controlled by large muscles that are capable of crushing bones, which gives access to the nutritious marrow within.Fergus, Charles. Wild Guide: Bears p. 3 Some grizzly bears have jaws that can bite through pine trees.Brandt, Anthony. Attack p. 52 Humans in contrast have thirty-two teeth, sixteen on each jaw, each tooth less than a half-inch long. Of these teeth, there are four incisors, two canines, four premolars, and six molars. While human incisors are capable of biting into meat, bears have more powerful jaw muscles, which make their bite more destructive to flesh.\\"Teeth\\" par. 2 More appropriate comparisons to bear dentition are to those of dogs whose teeth are similar in proportion to those of bears (and of course much smaller, although capable of inflicting much damage even at their smaller size). =Other senses and characteristics= Bears' senses are likely similar to those of dogs, animals that at times have much the same build and dietary habits of bears. Bears' sense of smell is dependent on a Jacobson's organ, or vomeronasal organ, which allows the bear to easily detect airborne scents. Bears use this sense of smell not only to hunt, but to detect other bears as well; male bears use smell to stay away from other male bears and to find female bears during mating season. While humans have a sense of olfaction, or smell, they do not use it for communication or for hunting; its usual range is around 10 square centimeters as compared to a polar bear that can smell a seal from away.Fergus, Charles. Wild Guide: Bears p. 6Anitei, Stefan. \\"The Limits of the Human Nose: How much can a human smell?\\" par. 7 Little is known about a bear's hearing, but scientists concluded that it is at least as good as a human's. Some scientists believe that bears may even be able to detect ultrasonic sounds as well. Natural observers believe that most bear species are near-sighted, which allows bears to forage for small objects such as berries. However, bears are also capable of discerning faraway movements, helping them hunt prey. The Kodiak bear, when compared to other species, appears to have vision comparable to a human (not near-sighted). Experiments show that black bears can see color, unlike many mammals. With scientists still working to determine exactly how perceptive bear eyes are, it is difficult to compare bear eyesight with human eyesight. Causes Almost all recorded bear attacks in the wild have resulted from the human surprising the bear. Hunters are the people most at risk of bear attacks because, as Tom Smith, a U.S. Geographical Survey research biologist, describes, \\"Hunters typically aren't making any noise, and they sleuth around while wearing camo.\\"Batin, Christopher. Bear Attacks! p. 46 Hunters try to be silent and, though many hunters wear reflective clothing so as not to become targets for other hunters, they try to hide their movements so as not to startle game. Most bear attacks result from hunters suddenly appearing in front of them, startling a bear into an instinctive act of aggression. However, a bear's first reaction upon detecting a human is to run away. Fergus lists a few possible causes for this instinctive reaction, each a speculation or theory based more on intuition rather than physical evidence. Some speculate that bears inherit their cautious nature from thousands of years ago when they had to be wary of larger and more dangerous carnivores. Some believe that bears have come to relate a human presence to firearms, or other weaponry, that they have come to fear. Still others think that hunters tend to target more aggressive bears, thus leaving only the more shy and timid bears to reproduce, creating a population of bears less hostile than before. =Protecting young= Most bear attacks happen when a mother bear senses a dangerous approach to her offspring One of the most dangerous situations that leads to bear attacks is when a bear perceives a threat to her offspring. Female bears are very protective of their young, devoting, on their own without any participation of the male bear, many years of their lives just to raise their cubs and teach them to hunt, hence the term \\"mama bear\\" to refer to extremely reactive and protective mothers of humans, particularly those who do this without paternal care.Ward, Paul and Suzanne Kynaston. Wild Bears of the World p. 146-150 While solo bears will usually retreat, a mother bear protecting her cubs is mostly likely to attack any sudden threat. Black bears present something of an exception to this, however, as mother black bears sometimes urge their cubs to climb trees for safety instead of remaining on the ground to protect their young.Masterson, Linda. Living with Bears p. 216 =Hunger= Another dangerous situation is when a human is faced with a hungry bear that has lost its natural fear of humans. With the decrease of hunting grounds and food crops such as berries and bark, bears often become more desperate and aggressive. However, this hunger has also triggered an unexpected reaction: bears began to follow gunfire because they associate it with dead animals that they can eat. Once a bear claims an animal carcass, it becomes very protective of its kill. This becomes a problem when a bear claims a hunter's kill, as the hunter may not wish to kill the bear as well. By avoiding a bear over a carcass, the risk of attack is reduced by around fifty percent. Recovery from bear attacks Aside from the large lacerations, fractures, and other wounds that can result from bear attacks, infections are also physically detrimental. A bear's mouth is full of potentially harmful bacteria, especially if the bear has been feeding on a gut pile or feces. Bear bites can result in infections common to most animal bites, including abscesses, sepsis, and even rabies. Though there is little data, what is available from bear bite statistics indicate that bears do not tend to carry many of the most well-known dangerous anaerobic bacteria strains in their normal oral flora; however, given the circumstances of most bear attacks, wound contamination from the environment is highly likely and means there is risk of tetanus and other external microbial agents. Recovery from bear attacks depends on the extent of damage, but often involves long-term medical treatment. As shown in the medical procedure led by Professor Shuzhong Guo, extreme cases of bear attacks have resulted in plastic surgeries and even facial transplants that, while successful, may take several years to complete and are sometimes fatal.

The general class of zero-magnification sky-orientation scopes using modern geodesy was made possible by the commercialisation of GPS and other GNSS systems in the early 21st century, and the SkyScout was an early example of such use despite being hampered by technical and price limitations.  Specifications  = Hardware = The SkyScout was a handheld, battery powered device about 7.4\\" x 4.0\\" x 2.5\\", and weighing about 1 pound. It had a viewing port, a 3\\" x 1\\" LCD display on the side and several buttons for controlling and selecting device functions. The SkyScout had a 12 channel GPS receiver and orientation sensors (whose accuracy was sensitive to proximity to metal objects, indicated by a horseshoe magnet icon on the display) that measured location and pointing angle. The LCD screen (known to scratch easily) displayed the name of the object (star, planet, deep sky object, etc.) and other relevant data. An audio presentation was available via earphones on 200 of the most popular celestial objects. Battery life was short at about one-half hour and the batteries required sleeves (included) to minimise their electromagnetic interference with GPS signal reception. = Software = From an internal database of some 6,000 celestial objects an object is identified simply by centering it in the device's zero-power optical finder and pressing a button. The database was expandable with extra plug-in SD data cards. A USB connection was also provided for online updates of the object database and device firmware. Since 1 January 2016, the database and firmware can no longer be updated.  Usage  The SkyScout located celestial objects (trivially including the Earth for ease of accessing audio narration about the planet); the user selected the desired object from the database and red arrows in the viewfinder directed the user to point the viewfinder to the object. The SkyScout also featured a \\"Tonight's Highlights\\" mode, leading the user through the night's best objects.  Product lifecycle  = Release = The SkyScout was announced at the January 2006 Consumer Electronics Show, and became available in July 2006. It had an initial retail cost of $675, but was later available at prices as low as $250. Celestron SkyScout Personal Planetarium = End-of-life = Only the years 2005-2015 are selectable as a valid date in the SkyScout's interface. The advent of iPhone/Android and associated astronomy apps have somewhat eliminated the need for this device. However, the Skyscout had a low-intensity light system that allowed users eyes to adapt to the darkness needed for observing stars. The Celestron SkyScout's database of star and planet positions only extended up to Jan 1, 2016. After this date the SkyScout is not supported by Celestron and no longer works as designed. Because the current date cannot be entered, none of the stars are in the positions that SkyScout indicates, although of course the stars remain in the same position for time, date and location (the same principle behind a planisphere). Celestron did not indicate this obsolescence date on the product or in the manual. As of April 7, 2019, the Sky Scout can no longer decode the GPS supplied date and time correctly, because of the GPS week number rollover in 2019. https://energy.gov/oe/articles/april-2019-global-positioning-system- gps-week-number-rollover  References   External links  *SkyScout website amateur astronomy astronomical instruments observational astronomy ","title":"SkyScout"},{"id":"20632376","text":"Wesley Alba Sturges (1893-1962) was a professor of law at the Yale Law School from 1924 to 1961, and served as dean of the law school from 1945 to 1954. He received his LL.B. from Yale in 1923. He retired from Yale in 1961 to become dean of the University of Miami School of Law. He was a prominent figure in Yale's Legal Realism movement. In his article (with Samuel Clark), Legal Theory and Real Property Mortgages, 37 Yale L. J. 691 (1928), he sought to make the Legal Realist point that doctrinal distinctions between \\"lien theory\\" and \\"title theory\\" did not have any actual effect on how courts ruled in litigation about mortgage disputes. Yale Law School, Nascent Realism. His casebook, Cases and Materials on the Law of Credit Transactions, emphasized the contradictions in judicial decision-making and sought to dispel the view that \\"what judges said in one case with its setting can be used to [predict] what they will decide in another case\\" with a different factual setting.Book Review, 40 Harv. L. Rev. 510, 513 (1926). From 22 Oct 1938, Sturges fulfilled the role of Executive Director of the Distilled Spirits Institute and gave evidence to the US Congress Investigation of Concentration of Economic Power (Parts 6-8 Liquor Industry) between 14 and 17 March 1939. As 'czar' of the nation's distilled liquor industry, Sturges drew up a code of practice to reform commercial practices, maintain an open competitive market, to end the system of secret rebates and other corner-cutting dodges, and to balance the field between larger and smaller operations.Bruce Catton, Catton's Washington Column, (Dec 10, 1939). See also (1939). After he stepped down from the deanship, Sturges taught only three courses, annually in rotation, one semester each year‚Äîarbitration, real-property credit transactions, and chattel credit transactions. Using an advanced form of the Socratic method, he sought in these courses to teach students rhetoric and advocacy rather than substantive law‚Äîwhat he termed \\"learning to stand up on your hind legs and make noises like a lawyer.\\" He was famous at Yale for his technique of calling upon a student to recite what a case held, asking him whether he agreed or disagreed with the court's ruling, and regardless of how the student replied, slowly forcing him by pointing out difficulties in that position, to adopt the contrary view, whereupon Sturges would by the same technique then argue the student back to conceding the validity of his original position. The point was to teach students both how to make noises like a lawyer and not to get led down the primrose path by an adversary.Not all of his colleagues agreed with his approach. Professors Friedrich Kessler and Grant Gilmore at times referred to Sturges's brand of legal realism as legal nihilism. See, e.g., Grant Gilmore, The Ages of American Law 81 (1977). Professor Grant Gilmore said of Wesley Sturges: > What did Wesley teach us?...He taught us forever to be on our guard against > the slippery generality, the received principle, the authoritative > proposition. He taught us to trust no one's judgment except our own--and not > to be too sure of that. He taught us how to live by our wits. He taught us, > in a word, how to be lawyers.For Wesley Sturges: On the Teaching and Study > of Law, 72 Yale L.J. 646, 654 (1963). Professor Ralph S.

In 1848, when he was only 19 years old, being entrusted to him the vice-prefecture of Zarand county, he participated in all the national, political and cultural acts of the county. He was elected general secretary of the national assembly on The Field of Liberty, of 3-5 May 1848. As a deputy in the Hungarian diet of Pest, he supported the autonomy and integrity of Transylvania for which he was congratulated by the people of Bra»ôov, Craiova, Bucharest and by those from the Sibiu Academy of Rights. His love for his country inflamed him as much as his father-in-law Simion Balint. This can be seen from the political activity they both carried out, fighting for the rights of Romanians in Transylvania, as well as from some small but still significant deeds. Thus in the letter of November 25, 1858, sent from Vienna to those at home in Ro»ôia, Iosif Hodo»ô and Simion Balint show that he was waiting to go in audience to the emperor, who was gone, then Balint writes: ...but the ugly so they realized that we think we won't get out of here ... we can barely get to our polenta once again.E.

Located in Lafayette, Colorado, the school serves children from kindergarten through twelfth grade) (K‚Äì12) in Lower, Middle, and Upper School on a campus of . History In 1967, Girard B. Henderson established the Colorado Junior Republic School (CJR) at Stapps Lake, Colorado. The school started as a summer school for underprivileged children. In 1970, it expanded into a year-round school, and then converted to a college preparatory program. =Early years= In 1970, the school moved to Lafayette. Colorado, where construction began on several new buildings. An industrious student body, \\"citizens\\" attended class, worked the farm and ranch, prepared meals, built structures, flew airplanes, and ran athletic and theatrical programs. In 1980, the school changed its name to Alexander Dawson School in honor of Henderson's father, Alexander Dawson Henderson. Responding to increasing demand for a rigorous academic program, the school developed into a college preparatory independent school. In the 1990s, the school grew from 26 students in grades 7-12 to a population of 386, grades K-12, and was now an independent day school. =2000‚Äìpresent= Athletic programs became more competitive; today, most sports participate in post-season play, and the school has earned numerous district, regional, and state trophies. Mandarin was added to the world languages curriculum in 2007, and two years later, the language immersion program expanded into China. The Speech and Debate Club launched that same year, and has earned numerous state championships, and a FIRST Robotics program launched as well. On September 6, 2000, the Alexander Dawson Foundation opened a sister school in the Summerlin, Nevada. The Alexander Dawson School at Rainbow Mountain is an independent, day school with over 150 students from kindergarten through fifth grade.The Southwest View newspaper, \\"School to Open This Fall,\\" by Judy DeLoretta, Wednesday, March 22, 2000, pg. 1A, 12A In 2005, Dawson School celebrated the 100th anniversary of Henderson's birthday at the school in Colorado. In 2020, Dawson School celebrated its 50th anniversary. =Today's campus= Dawson's campus includes an upper school, a middle school, and an elementary/lower school. The Athletic Center contains two gyms and a conditioning facility; The Arts Center includes a theater, dance studio, band room, and fine arts studios. In 2018, the first new construction in 20 years was seen with the opening of the Dining Commons, a multi-purpose space for dining, meetings, and events. In 2010, the previous dining space was repurposed into the Learning Commons, an updated library/student center. In 2020, the Dawson Center for Innovation opened, a 24,500 square foot building with classrooms, labs, maker space, and flexible spaces. The campus also includes cottages with classrooms, tennis courts, baseball fields, soccer and lacrosse fields, a swimming pool, learning gardens, a labyrinth, and an orchard. In early October, a student tested positive for the coronavirus. Academics Students in grades Kindergarten-5th grade work in homeroom classes with the core subjects of language arts, mathematics, social studies, and science, and have 10+ hours per week of instruction in specials: art, music, physical education, library, technology skills, and Spanish. Special activities include presentations, class plays, semi-annual choral concerts, and visual arts shows. Character and life skills education begins in the Lower School, and students are given opportunities to develop self-confidence, self-worth, and respect for others. All Middle School academics incorporate a focus on four imperative skills: creativity, collaboration, critical thinking, and communication. Beginning in sixth grade, students have a more departmentalized schedule, anchored by an advisory system. In addition to studying English, mathematics, history, science, and world languages, they choose arts electives -- music, computer graphics, theater, woodworking, visuals arts -- sports electives -- soccer, volleyball, cross-country, tennis, basketball, baseball, canoe & kayak, yoga, and cyclocross. There is also a range of clubs and co-curriculars from which to choose, such as Speech & Debate and Robotics. Additionally, they further their technology and media literacy skills, and have ample opportunity for experiential, outdoor education (see Experiential education). The class and Winterim trips (see Experiential education) are a hallmark of the Upper School experience. In addition, seniors must complete a Senior Project: Seniors spend the last weeks of their high school career in internships of their own design that expose them to career and community service possibilities for the future, and then to make an extensive presentation to faculty and peers on that experience. Throughout all divisions, special emphasis is placed on creating a culture of inclusion, community, and mutual respect. =Experiential education= Dawson School's academic program incorporates a serious focus on experiential, outdoor education. In the Lower School, this takes the form of numerous field/overnight trips. Middle and Upper School class trips integrate curriculum with life skills, character development, citizenship, team- building, and science. During Winterim Week, students devote time to an experiential, thematic study of one topic. In grades K-4, special activities are designed for them on campus; grades five and six take week-long trips as a class. From seventh through twelfth grades, students select a week-long Winterim experience. These typically fall into one of these categories: community service, academic enhancement, technology/arts/athletic education, cultural/religious diversity awareness, environmental awareness, or wilderness adventure. International trips can focus on language, culture, and community service; they may also include ecological, cultural, historical, or wilderness adventure programs. =Faculty= Over 75 faculty members work collaboratively with over 40 additional staff to accomplish all of Dawson School's programs.

He is a bored Shinigami that drops a Death Note, a notebook that allows the user to kill anyone simply by knowing their name and face, into the human world in order to have relief from his boredom. It is picked up by Light Yagami, a bright high school student who uses it in an attempt to create and rule a utopia cleansed of evil, with him at the helm as a \\"god\\". In the anime adaptation, Ryuk is voiced by Nakamura Shid≈ç in Japanese and by Brian Drummond in the English version. Both actors reprise their roles for voicing the computer-generated version of the character in the live-action films, with Jun Fukushima voicing the CG version in the live-action television drama. In the musical, Ryuk was portrayed by K≈çtar≈ç Yoshida. In the American live-action film adaptation Jason Liles played the character in costume while Willem Dafoe provided the voice acting and facial motion capture. Creation and conception  Ohba said that he always mentioned apples in the thumbnails because he wished to use \\"the dying message that Shinigami only eat apples\\" and therefore he needed Ryuk to hold apples and that \\"There's no other reason.\\" Ohba also said that he specifically chose apples as the red \\"goes well\\" with Ryuk's black body and that the apples \\"fit well\\" with Ryuk's \\"big\\" mouth.Death Note 13: How to Read. VIZ Media. 181. When Obata informed Ohba that apples held religious and psychological significance and that a person could \\"read a lot\\" into the inclusion of apples and that he assumed that was the reason why Ohba included the apples, Ohba said that he did not \\"think about that at all\\" and that he believes that \\"apples are cool... that's it. [laughs]\\" Ohba added that he felt including aspects that could become later plot points was beneficial, and the apples were used as a point when Light asked Ryuk to search for the cameras in exchange for apples.Death Note 13: How to Read. VIZ Media. 182. Obata said that he encountered difficulty in designing Ryuk. He said that his original idea of Ryuk consisted of Ryuk looking like a \\"young man similar to Light\\" with black hair and wings. Obata said that he had the idea of Shinigami looking like \\"attractive rock stars.\\" Obata felt that if Ryuk appeared more attractive than Light, he would \\"appear to be the main character\\" and \\"things wouldn't work as well.\\" Obata said that he decided to erase the previous design and use the final design when his editor told that Ryuk did not have to appear human. Obata said that he liked the \\"monster\\"-like appearance and added that, with his face, \\"you can never really tell what he is thinking.\\" Obata said that he encountered difficulty while drawing Ryuk in the pilot chapter since he did not \\"have a good handle\\" on the \\"bone structure of his face.\\" Obata said that during serialization he became \\"so used\\" to the underlying structure that he could visualize it. Obata describes Ryuk's face as appearing different between the pilot chapter and the actual Death Note series. In 13: How to Read Obata thought of an idea involving Ryuk's face being a mask, and under the mask would be an \\"attractive\\" face.\\"Takeshi Obata Production Note: Characters.\\" Death Note 13: How to Read. VIZ Media. 137. When designing Ryuk's Death Note Obata thought about the appearance of Ryuk's handwriting. Ryuk wrote the words \\"Death Note\\" on the cover of his own notebook, and when he took possession of Sidoh's book he wrote the same words on the front cover. =Films= Sh≈´suke Kaneko, director of the live-action films, said that he chose to create Ryuk with computer graphics as it would make the aspect of Ryuk only appearing to people who have touched the Death Note \\"believable\\" and that the audience could \\"tell instinctually\\" that Ryuk is a Shinigami with \\"no real presence.\\" Kaneko added that if a human actor represented Ryuk, the appearance would have been \\"too realistic,\\" the actor may have impacted Ryuk's \\"presence,\\" and the audience may have \\"doubted he was a death god, if only for a second.\\" Kaneko ordered the graphics team to design the graphics as if it were an actor \\"inside a rubber suit.\\"Shonen Jump. Volume 6, Issue 6. June 2008. VIZ Media. 6. Digital Frontier, a computer graphics company, animated Ryuk. Kaneko said that because Ryuk's physical structure is \\"different from a human‚Äôs,\\" he thought of an idea of visualizing a person in a Ryuk costume. He also wanted the audience to think of Ryuk as a person in a Ryuk costume talking to Tatsuya Fujiwara, the actor who plays Light. He said that he was \\"asking for too much\\" and that he wanted audiences to see the film Ryuk as more than \\"a product of the latest CG technology.\\" Fujiwara said that due to the constant filming with Ryuk he rarely interacted with other actors during the filming of the first film; The Star of Malaysia describes Fujiwara's emotions as \\"mock frustration.\\" Fujiwara described the CG Ryuk as \\"so selfish\\" and \\"far more difficult to work with\\" than a human actor.\\"The dummy.\\" The Star. The director of the American adaptation, Adam Wingard, wanted to do the opposite of the Japanese films and have an actor on set portraying Ryuk as much as possible. They had seven-foot- tall actor Jason Liles wearing the suit and performing both the mannerisms and dialogue alongside the other actors, but cut out his face and voice and used Willem Dafoe's facial capture and dialogue. \\"What we did was basically cut out the on-set creature's face and had Jason wear these red LED glasses, so at least we could see a representation of his glowing eyes, knowing we were going to replace that later with some CGI, and then voice it over with Willem.\\" The production initially created a large prototype, animatronic puppet of Ryuk to use, but it was eventually abandoned. Appearances =In Death Note= Ryuk is a Shinigami bored with the activities (or lack thereof) of the Shinigami realm, so he decides to obtain a second Death Note and drop it in the human world for someone to find, hoping to relieve his boredom. He succeeds in tricking the Shinigami King out of a second Death Note. He deliberately writes the instructions inside the front cover (in English, which he assumed to be the most popular language in the human realm) so people would understand its purpose. The Death Note is discovered by Light Yagami, and Ryuk follows him around for much of the series to see how Light uses it. Ryuk has a fairly humanoid appearance. His skin is blueish gray, or a purplish color, his limbs are abnormally long, and he has bulging yellow eyes with black irises (red in the anime); in the films, he is represented by CGI. Ryuk is characterized by his constant amusement by, and apathy in regards to, Light's problems as well as his interest in humans. He enjoys seeing Light overcome the various challenges put to him, and often waits until the worst possible moment to inform him of a certain aspect of the Death Note just to get a laugh. He is occasionally helpful if it serves his own interests, such as obtaining apples or furthering his own amusement, but for the most part will jokingly ask Light what his next move will be or have Light explain to him the point of a certain action. He tells Light in the first volume he doesn't always look at what Light writes because he finds it more amusing. Light describes Ryuk as a \\"crazy-looking, supernatural creature with these wicked eyes\\" who becomes (\\"surprisingly\\") a \\"moral compass\\" for Light in the film version of Death Note.\\"SFIAAFF: Death Note .\\" sfist. Ryuk has a great fondness for apples, comparing their effect on Shinigami to that of cigarettes and alcohol. He claims to go through a type of withdrawal if he goes for too long without them. His withdrawal symptoms involve twisting himself up like a pretzel and doing handstands. He also states that he is shy around girls; when Misa Amane hugs him he becomes intangible. In addition to apples, Ryuk is fond of video games, first shown in the omake eight-panel comic series, where he asks for a Silver Game Boy Advance SP, originally published in Weekly Shonen Jump Volume 4-5 (double issue) in 2005. On another occasion, Ryuk asks Light if he wants to play Mario Golf (changed to \\"video games\\" in the anime), but receives no answer since Light's bedroom is bugged with cameras.Death Note manga; Volume 2, pages 187-188 As Ryuk explains when he first meets Light, he is bound to take Light's life when his time comes. In the manga, Ryuk does this after Light is shot several times by Matsuda. He desperately begs Ryuk to write the names of the investigation team and the SPK members in the Death Note, which he first implies he will do, but Ryuk, reminding Light that he is not on anyone's side, just writes Light's name instead. He was expecting Light might have thought of some way out of his situation, but seeing as he was desperate enough to go to Ryuk for help, he decided it was all over for him. Ryuk returns to the Shinigami realm.\\"The 13 Truths About Chapter 108.\\" Death Note: How to Read 13. VIZ Media. 200. Two years later, Ryuk berates another shinigami in their attempt to replicate his success with Light by giving their own Death Note to a \\"weak\\" human. A further six years later, Ryuk returns to Earth and gives another human his Death Note, who asks him to return with the Death Note in another two years. Subsequently, in 2019, Ryuk returns and the pair sell the Death Note to the U.S. President for $100 trillion, to be divided evenly amongst every Japanese bank account holder under the age of 60, before the human relinquishes (and memories of) his Death Note to Ryuk. When Ryuk returns to the Shinigami Realm before delivering the Death Note, the Shinigami King, berating him, adds a rule forbidding the sale of Death Notes, causing the U.S. President to reject the Death Note out of fear for his own life and merely tell the world he has it, while the human dies when he accepts his ¬•1 billion.\\"One-Shot Special I\\" and \\"One-Shot Special II\\" Many years later, a graying Ryuk, having lost his Shinigami's Eyes,is asked by a new shinigami to recount his time on Earth as they prepare to go there themselves, Ryuk ambiguously addressing the shinigami as life as they leave before his has finished recounting his tale.Death Note ReLight =In the pilot chapter= In the pilot chapter of Death Note, Ryuk is the master of two Death Notes which he drops into the human world; Taro Kagami picks up the first one, and Ryuk talks to Taro. The other is picked up by Taro's classmate, Miura. The police burn Miura's book, not knowing of the existence of the first book.

However his wounds are too severe for him to escape very far, and Ryuk, who is watching him from atop a pole, decides that following Light around during a prison sentence is not worth his time and thus writes Light's name in his Death Note, remarking that he had a lot of fun with him regardless. Light passed away unhappily, with an apparition of L standing over him - mirroring Light standing over L on his death. = In live-action media= In the film series, Ryuk is voiced by Nakamura Shid≈ç. The second film ends in much the same manner as the manga, except Ryuk's silence leads Light to believe that he is willing to help. When Light learns differently, Light yells at Ryuk and jumps through him, trying in vain to stop his death before dying in his father's arms; before this, Ryuk takes this opportunity to reveal to Light that humans who have used the Death Note are unable to enter either Heaven or Hell regardless of their actions in life. In the spin-off L: Change the World, Ryuk offers L the Death Note. When L refuses and proceeds to burn it, Ryuk complains that L is boring and disappears, returning to the Shinigami realm. In the fourth film, Death Note: Light Up the New World, Nakamura Shid≈ç reprises his role as the voice and motion capture of Ryuk. 10 years after the end of Kira case, Ryuk again visits the human world to find the successor of kira on the reaper king's order. He finds Light's biological son Hikari Yagami and gives him a death note. Teru Mikami, his guardian who raised him gets insane and kills him by writing his name in the notebook. The leader of Death Note task force, Tsukuru Mishima witnesses the whole thing and kills Mikami and takes his notebook. Tsukuru becomes the new owner and Ryuk stays with him. Later Tsukuru dispossesses his Death Note and asks Ryuk to give the Death Note and Light's message to the cyberterrorist, Yuki Shien. Ryuk finds his new mate. Later, Yuki is killed in a crossfire and Ryuk is seen for last time talking to Tsukuru explaining why death reapers are looking so hard for the next kira because the death reaper king promised that anyone who finds the next kira would have the throne after he retired. Ryuk also says that they will keep sending death notes until there's a next kira. Ryuk forbades bye and disappears. In the live-action TV drama, Ryuk is voiced by Jun Fukushima and Daisaku Nishino is the motion capture actor of Ryuk. At the end of the series, Light begs Ryuk's help but Ryuk lets Light burn in the fire. Then he returns to shinigami realm with Rem. Actor Willem Dafoe provided the voice acting and motion capture of the character's facial elements in the American adaptation. Unlike the source material, Ryuk does not possess multiple Death Notes, and has passed the Death Note to various people throughout the decades, with each one of them using the notebook for different purposes. Despite the film's overall mixed critical reception, Dafoe's performance and characterization of Ryuk has been widely praised by fans and critics alike, with many singling him out as one of the film's main highlights. Reception Tsugumi Ohba, story writer of Death Note, said that Ryuk is his favorite Shinigami and that \\"If I didn't say Ryuk here, his whole character would be in vain. [laughs]Death Note: How to Read 13. VIZ Media. 190. While praising Obata's artwork for the series, Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network singled out Ryuk as the prime example; describing him as \\"a grotesque hulking beast, the kind of thing most people would probably think of when they're asked to imagine what a grim spectre of death would look like.\\" His colleague Briana Lawrence felt that despite being a previously vital character, Ryuk faded into the background and became \\"unimportant\\" as the series went on, only to become vital once again in the final chapter. On the actor's voicework in the English dub of the anime, Tom S. Pepirium of IGN said that \\"Brian Drummond IS Ryuk.\\"\\"Death Note: \\"Ally\\" Review.\\" IGN. Pepirium described Drummond's voice as \\"excellent\\" and that this makes it \\"hilarious\\" to watch \\"Ryuk and his never-ending grin giggle at the events he put into motion.\\"\\"Death Note: \\"Wager\\" Review.\\" IGN. Kitty Sensei of OtakuZone had her opinions of the film portrayal of Ryuk published in The Star, a Malaysian newspaper.

Of a mixed Aromanian and Albanian background, raised as a Greek Orthodox, he belonged to the Mocioni family, which had been elevated to Hungarian nobility. He was brought up at his family estate in the Banat, at Foeni, where he joined the administrative apparatus, and identified as a Romanian since at least the 1830s. He rose to prominence during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848: he was a supporter of the House of Lorraine, trying to obtain increased autonomy for Banat Romanians in exchange for loyalism. The Austrians appointed Mocioni to an executive position over that region, but curbed his expectations by including the Banat as a whole into the Voivodeship of Serbia. This disappointment pushed Mocioni to renounce politics during much of the 1850s. The attempt by Austria to ensure a new administrative formula in the 1860s saw Mocioni's co-option into the Imperial Diet. He also organized, in 1860, the National Assembly in the Banat‚Äîan abortive project, seeking to obtain autonomy on ethnic grounds. He then oscillated between ethnic federalism within a nominal Hungarian realm and full centralism in Austria's custody, while failing in his bid to promote election boycott as a political weapon. He had noted political rivalries with Romanians who sided with Hungarian radicalism, in particular Eftimie Murgu. Serving one full term in the Diet of Hungary, Mocioni also turned to cooperation with the Romanians of Transylvania, and helped Andrei »òaguna to reestablish an independent Transylvanian Metropolis for Romanian Orthodox Christians. Alongside his brothers Gheorghe and Anton, and his lawyer Vincen»õiu Babe»ô, he founded the newspaper Albina of Vienna. The creation of Austria-Hungary and the Banat's absorption into the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen were significant blows for Mocioni's nationalist- loyalist campaign. Mocioni withdrew to Foeni, ailing and out of the public eye for the final decade of his life. He was still a noted philanthropist and sponsor of the Romanian press, but had conflicts with Krass√≥ County voters and the Romanian peasants on his estates, a matter which contributed to his voluntary isolation. He was survived by his wife Laura, daughter of Petar ƒåarnojeviƒá, and by his nephew, the politician Alexandru Mocioni. Biography =Origins and early life= The Mocionis were probably descended from Petru MucinƒÉ, an Aromanian (or \\"Macedo-Romanian\\") priest from Aspropotamos in Thessaly or Moscopole, who declared loyalty to the Habsburg Monarchy and served in the Great Turkish War.Colta, p. 66; Deheleanu, p. 216.

Like many Romanians, Mocioni supported the former's liberal reforms, and remained loyal to Franz Joseph I, opposing the rise of Hungarian nationalism. This pitted him against the pro-Hungarian revolutionary Eftimie Murgu, who enlisted the loyalties of various other Banatians.Deheleanu, p. 220 The Hungarian State reacted by confiscating Mocioni's property and forcing him into exile.Bugariu, p. 399; Deheleanu, p. 220; Tiron, p. 29 By September 1849, he was in Vienna, where he acted as a Romanian representative, alongside Ioan Dobran and Vincen»õiu Babe»ô.Li»õiu, p. 33 Petru Mocioni was also active there as a \\"man of trust\\" of the Banatian Romanians,Mure»ôan & Suciu, p. 107 presenting Franz Stadion with a set of political proposals on their behalf.CiorƒÉnescu, p. 218 Following the surrender at Vil√°gos and the resumption of Austrian control, Mocioni's loyalty was rewarded, and he was appointed supreme commissioner for the Banat, within the new Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar.Bugariu, p. 399; CiorƒÉnescu, p. 218; Deheleanu, p. 220; Mure»ôan & Suciu, p. 107; Tiron, pp. 29‚Äì30 As such, he governed directly over some 600,000 people. However, he disliked this arrangement, and, in December 1849, petitioned Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg to obtain the secession of Banat as an autonomous, Romanian, province.Tiron, p. 30 During his mandate, the administration was staffed with a growing number of Romanians. In tandem, his Mocioni relatives approached the Romanians of Transylvania, also loyalists, and together with them began pressing for a Romanian dukedom to be created out of Romanian territories in Hungary.CiorƒÉnescu, p. 44; Milin (2011), p. 398. See also Ber√©nyi, pp. 200‚Äì201; Mure»ôan & Suciu, p. 107 The commissioner was also involved in such projects, proposing that a Romanian press be set up in Arad, located on the Banat's traditional border with Transylvania and Partium.Li»õiu, pp. 37‚Äì38 By 1850, Mocioni was also campaigning to reestablish a Transylvanian (Romanian) Orthodox Metropolis, fully separated from the Patriarchate of Karlovci. The cause had first been embraced by Petru in the 1840s. In 1852, he ultimately resigned as commissioner, expressing his protest toward the treatment of Romanians by the Austrian government.Deheleanu, p. 220; Tiron, p. 30 However, he was asked to reconsider by the authorities, who feared that they were becoming unpopular with the majority population. Although he did not resume his earlier posting, he went on to serve as president of the Central Commission in Temeschwar (Timi»ôoara); he was also a counsel for the Austrian Court of Cassation.Tiron, p. 30. See also Deheleanu, p. 220 He resigned all positions in the state apparatus in 1856, and withdrew to Foeni. This decision was cemented in 1858 by the death of brother Petru, killed by his own landlord or doorman in Pest.Bugariu, p. 399; Deheleanu, pp. 219, 220, 221; Tiron, p. 30 The killing, which some authors see as a political assassination, ended with a celebrity trial in which Emanoil Gojdu represented the Mocionis as plaintiffs.Ne»ô, p. 20 In 1859, at Foeni, Mocioni married a Serb coreligionist, Laura, the Countess Csernovich (ƒåarnojeviƒá).\\"Ce e nou?\\", in Familia, Nr. 33/1880, p. 211Deheleanu, pp. 219, 220; Tiron, p. 30 A woman of \\"outstanding beauty\\",Milin (2011), p. 382 she was also noted for collecting Ancient Roman coinsBabe»ôiu, pp. 179‚Äì180 and paintings with Roman subjects by Nicola Popescu.\\"Pesta in 12 Noemvre n.\\", in Albina, Nr. 87/1866, p. 3 Her father, Graf Petar ƒåarnojeviƒá, had been an ally of the Hungarian revolutionaries; dispossessed and bankrupt, he moved to Foeni to live with the couple.Milin (2011), pp. 382‚Äì383 They also shared the manor with Alexandru and the other armalist Mocionis, who were similarly disappointed with Hungarian politics, and who progressively withdrew from Pest.Colta, pp. 74‚Äì75 Author Atanasie Marian Marienescu notes that Mocioni, \\"everywhere encouraged and supported by the Romanian intelligentsia, became in all places a leader of the Romanians in national and church causes, and this leadership was recognized by his brothers as well.\\" From about 1860, he dedicated himself to the national awakening of Romanians, networking between the Austrian subjects in the Banat, Transylvania, and the Duchy of Bukovina, and those residing in the newly formed United Principalities. In November 1860, as Count Mensdorff-Pouilly was sent over to report to Franz Joseph on the demands of Banat Romanians, Mocioni called in and organized a National Assembly. This demanded the creation of a Banat Captaincy, and, when the request was denied, an administrative incorporation with Transylvania.Bugariu, pp. 399‚Äì400; Tiron, p. 30. See also CiorƒÉnescu, pp. 89‚Äì90; Milin (2010), p. 21; Mure»ôan & Suciu, p. 107; Otiman, p. 28 He noted that Romanians needed to form a singular \\"moral body\\", \\"called upon as a nation to partake in Austria's constitutional life.\\"CiorƒÉnescu, p. 90 In his Memorandum to the Throne, Mocioni also theorized that the Banat was an \\"individuality\\" distinct from the Serbian and Hungarian regions, and suggested that \\"never-ending problems\\" would result from its continued amalgamation.Milin (2010), p. 21 =Imperial Diet and church separation= Serbian Voivodeship and Banat Military Frontier (Mg.), also marking the traditional borders of Banat.

He was an \\"extraordinary counsel\\", alongside Andrei »òaguna of Transylvania and Nicolae de Petrino of Bukovina, supporting regional autonomy and the reestablishment and a Romanian Metropolis.Mitropolitul..., pp. 222, 327; Bugariu, p. 399; Deheleanu, pp. 220‚Äì221; Lupa»ô, pp. 187‚Äì189; Otiman, p. 28; PƒÉcƒÉ»õian, passim; Tiron, p. 30 By origin, all three were in fact Aromanians.Deheleanu, p. 221 Reportedly, both »òaguna and Mocioni objected to Diet selections being non-democratic, agreeing with Gy√∂rgy Apponyi that the delegates could only be said to represent themselves. Their objection was registered, but they were asked by Archduke Rainer not to insist on this point.PƒÉcƒÉ»õian, pp. 269‚Äì270 Seen from his regional constituency, Mocioni was also one of two representatives of the Voivodeship, including the Banat. The other was a Serb prelate, Samuilo Ma≈°ireviƒá.PƒÉcƒÉ»õian, pp. 268‚Äì269, 270 By September 1860, Mocioni clarified that he considered himself a legitimate Banat and \\"people's\\" representative.PƒÉcƒÉ»õian, p. 278 On June 6, Mocioni was elected to the Budget Committee, and from this position campaigned to have Romanian Orthodox churches subsidized on par with other state-recognized religions.PƒÉcƒÉ»õian, pp. 270, 274, 278‚Äì279 Proclaiming the equality of nations against demands for Hungarian hegemony, he found himself debating the issue with Gy√∂rgy Majl√°th, who accused him of fostering the rebellious doctrines of Giuseppe Garibaldi. Mocioni defended his ideas as mainstream, arguing that equality had been promised by Franz Joseph himself.Stefan Malf√®r, \\"Les repr√©sentations de Garibaldi en Autriche\\", in Jean-Yves Fr√©tign√©, Paul Pasteur (eds.), Changer d'√©poque, n¬∞ 23.

See also CiorƒÉnescu, p. 89 In the end, Mocioni sided with the \\"centralists\\", who supported proportional representation within a centralized Austria; Petrino, a \\"federalist\\", wanted regional decentralization on the basis of old laws, which, while favoring Bukovinans, would have left Romanians in Hungary underrepresented as a group.Lupa»ô, p. 189; PƒÉcƒÉ»õian, pp. 277‚Äì279 The two made common cause in their opposition to a projected union between Bukovina and Austrian Galicia.PƒÉcƒÉ»õian, p. 275 Mocioni's mandate ended with the Diet recall on September 29, 1860. He had failed in his bid to secure Banat autonomy: the region, alongside all of the Voivodeship, was re-annexed to the Hungarian crown in December 1860. In April 1861, Mocioni persuaded the Banat Romanians to boycott future elections for the reestablished Hungarian Diet. This decision was overturned later that year, when a new ethnic assembly passed a resolution calling for single Romanian candidatures, supported by all voters.Bugariu, p. 400 Mocioni himself was elected for Krass√≥ (Cara»ô) County, at Lugoj (Lugos). His rival was Murgu, who sided with the Address Party and supported incorporation with Hungary. Mocioni, perceived as the Romanian nationalist candidate, won 621 votes to 94.Ber√©nyi, pp. 102‚Äì103.

Mocioni's solution to these setbacks was the attempted creation of a de facto \\"political body\\" and \\"crown land\\" for all Romanians of the Empire.

He donated his only source of income, the revenue of Foeni, to the famine- stricken population of that village, and even ran into debt in his effort to provide for them.Bugariu, p. 400; Deheleanu, p. 221 He was also interested in horse breeding, and one of his steeds became the ancestor of an equine string that populated much of Foeni.C.

For a while, the Romanians of Banat continued to plead with the emperor for Romanian self-rule in the Banat. One such petition, circulated in December 1863, also asked Franz Joseph to surround himself with Romanian advisers, including \\"Andrea de Mocioni, lord of Foeni\\", a man distinguished by \\"political, patriotic, and national virtues\\".\\"Plans√≥rea Romaniloru Banatiani (incheiere din Nrulu trecutu)\\", in Foaia pentru Minte, Anima si Literatura, Nr. 29/1863, p. 207 As noted by historian Tudor-Radu Tiron, the restoration of Hungarian rule ultimately pushed the Mocionis back into Hungarian politics, which explains why Andrei, Anton and Gheorghe all took seats in the last Diet of Hungary (1865).Tiron, p. 31 Alexandru also won a Rittberg seat in that legislature. Known as the theoretician of national liberalism, he was a main proponent of the Nationalities Bill, which, if adopted, would have set up autonomous units for the Romanians in Hungary.Ber√©nyi, pp. 215‚Äì220; Nicolae Boc»ôan, \\"Liberalism and Nationalism in Alexandru Mocsonyi's Parliamentary Activity (1865‚Äì1871)\\", in Transylvanian Review, Vol. XXII, Issue 4, Winter 2013, pp. 17‚Äì24; CiorƒÉnescu, p. 92; Deheleanu, pp. 222‚Äì223; Milin (2010), pp. 21‚Äì28 By then, the Mocionis' contribution to the national cause was being recognized in the United Principalities, customarily known as the \\"Principality of Romania\\". From January 1865, he was an honorary member of the nationalist Bucovina Society.D. MurƒÉra»ôu, \\"Comentarii eminesciene 1866‚Äì1874. La morm√¢ntul lui Aron Pumnul\\", in Mihai Eminescu, Opere I.

On April 22, 1866, the Romanian Regency appointed Andrei Mocioni a founding member of the Romanian Academy (or \\"Romanian Literary Society\\", as it was known at the time).Bugariu, p. 400; Otiman, passim; Tiron, pp. 28, 31 He was inducted as a Banat representative, alongside Babe»ô‚Äîwho, in 1883, wrote Mocioni's biography.Otiman, passim; Tiron, p. 31. See also Bugariu, p. 400; Lupa»ô, p. 271 From 1861, the Mocionis and Babe»ô had cooperated in countering Hungarian nationalist propaganda abroad, publicizing the Romanian point of view. According to Babe»ô, their effort was sabotaged by Abdolonyme Ubicini, Istv√°n T√ºrr, and Giovenale Vegezzi Ruscalla, who wanted a Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian alliance against Austria; but also found backing from L√°szl√≥ Teleki of the Resolution Party.Babe»ôiu, pp. 174‚Äì176 With his parallel career as a lawyer, Babe»ô also helped the Mocionis win back 5 million forint from their Hungarian debtors, and was thereafter their trusted adviser.Cosma, pp. 267‚Äì268 Later in 1866, echoes of Mocioni's \\"Captaincy\\" project were discernible in the radical proposal advanced in the Diet by Babe»ô, Sigismund Popoviciu, and Iosif Hodo»ôiu: it recognized subjection to the Hungarian crown and government, but sought to redefine Hungary on the basis of ethnic federalism and corporatism.Milin (2010), p. 23. See also Ne»ô, pp. 113‚Äì114 These efforts also failed. By September 1866, Mocioni and Babe»ô began speaking out in the Diet about the wish of Austrian Romanians to be united with the Principality of Romania.Sorin Liviu Damean, \\"Rom√¢ni »ôi maghiari √Æn contextul rƒÉzboiului austro‚Äìprusian (1866)\\", in Analele UniversitƒÉ»õii din Craiova, Seria Istorie, Vol. XVI, Issue 1, 2011, pp. 280‚Äì281 The 1866‚Äì1867 interval was a great disappointment for all factions within the Romanian caucus: the return of Hungarian nationalism was unopposed following the Austro-Prussian War, and the Ausgleich of 1867 created Austria-Hungary, attaching most Romanian-inhabited to the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen. Mocioni was especially affected by the outcome.Bugariu, p. 400; Tiron, p. 31 In the months following the new arrangement, Mocioni and Babe»ô participated in the drafting of another protest, also signed by the Diet's Serb, Slovak and \\"Ruthenian\\" deputies. The resolution, which demanded guarantees for the minorities, was supposed to be read by Mocioni. He stepped down to make way for a more popular deputy, the Serb Mil√°n Manojlovics.\\"Manifestatiune colective in cestiunea de nationalitate\\", in Romanulu, December 22, 1867, p. 1096 Brother Anton Mocioni, alongside Serbs Stevan Branovaƒçki and Svetozar Miletiƒá, continued to back the campaign, proposing to divide Hungary into six ethnic-based provinces.Ne»ô, pp. 15, 114‚Äì116, 132‚Äì133 =Final withdrawal= In 1869, Andrei Mocioni withdrew from all activism and returned to Foeni. That year, an analysis in Der Wanderer newspaper noted that \\"although Andrea Mocioni will forever remain the true leader\\" of the Romanian caucus, Alexandru was emerging as the tactician, and moderating the Romanians' resistance to Hungarian nationalism.\\"Varietati. Indreptare\\", in Albina, Nr. 10/1869, p. 2 By then, the various factions seeking to form a Romanian National Party had only managed to establish a Transylvanian caucus and a Banatian one. The latter, presided upon by Anton Mocioni, recognized Hungarian rule and sought to obtain Romanian rights within its jurisdiction.Ne»ô, pp. 132‚Äì133 An 1872 report to his partisans also claimed that Andrei and the other Mocionis were \\"disgusted\\" and \\"demoralized\\" by the behavior of Romanian electors in Lugoj and Krass√≥, who acted as \\"proselytes of the [Hungarian] government\\".\\"Lugosiu, 4 fauru 1872\\", in Albina, Nr. 9/1872, p. 2 Mocioni also continued to be active as a sponsor and philanthropist, providing funds for Babe»ô's ethnological work, and for the Viennese Romanian newspaper, Albina.Cosma, pp. 263‚Äì268; Deheleanu, pp. 221‚Äì222; Munteanu, p. 64; Ne»ô, p. 298; Otiman, p. 28 He and his brothers published and wrote for the latter sheet, alongside Babe»ô,Ber√©nyi, pp. 202‚Äì204; Cosma, pp. 264‚Äì266 while also financing pro-Romanian campaigns in the German-language journal Ost und West.Mitropolitul..., pp. 331‚Äì332 Together with Visarion Roman and Partenie Cosma, they established in 1871 the Albina Bank of Sibiu, providing credit for Romanian businesses.Ne»ô, p. 136 At the time, Mocioni also provided funds in hopes of creating a Romanian regional theater, and became godfather of Andrei, the child of actors Mihail and Matilda Pascaly.Ber√©nyi, pp. 56, 162. See also Ne»ô, p. 228 The family as a whole provided a scholarship fund for disadvantaged children, managed by Babe»ô.Ber√©nyi, pp. 210, 220‚Äì221, 237; Bugariu, p. 400; Deheleanu, p. 221; Ne»ô, pp. 301‚Äì302 Noted recipients include writer Gruia Liuba Murgu,Cosma, p. 270 biologist Victor Babe»ô, and lawyer Coriolan Brediceanu.Ber√©nyi, p. 220 The former deputy and the Hungarian post had an unsolved dispute about the creation of a Foeni post office, which the officials viewed as too costly. Mocioni took the postmaster examination and, at his own expense, erected a building which, with its mahogany furniture and silver inkwells, was recognized as \\"the most elegant post office\\".\\"Diverse. Biroulu postalu celu mai elegantu\\", in Gazet'a Transilvaniei, Nr. 54/1880, p. 3 Mocioni was still pressed by his friends to make a return to politics. He refused on principle, but allowed for a theoretical possibility: \\"I shall no longer fight and sacrifice myself to the four winds, but will patiently wait for a national regeneration to begin, if ever.\\" A local tradition, recorded in 1905 by the newspaper Tribuna, noted that, by then, he and his Serb wife were detested by the local Romanians, who once attacked the manor and shattered its windows.\\"Concertul de la Foenƒ≠\\", in Tribuna, Nr. 37/1905, p. 2 According to a notice in the Arad Orthodox paper Biseric'a si Sc√≥la, Mocioni was also driven away from religious affairs after \\"a mean gossiper libeled him, out of the blue and without a shred of truthfulness\\". Mocioni's health was failing, and for this reason he never attended any session of the Romanian Academy.Otiman, p. 28 From 1879, Mocioni's disease worsened, and, once bedridden, he was taken to Temeschwar to be under specialist care. Mocioni died on May 5 (April 23), 1880. Although some sources give his death place as Foeni, contemporary reports have it that he died in Temeschwar, after having lapsed into a brief coma, and while looked after by his wife Laura. Their marriage had produced no heirs. Legacy Mocioni crypt in Foeni, 2015 photograph Mocioni's body was taken to Foeni for an Orthodox burial at the common Serb‚ÄìRomanian church, which he and his wife had furnished.\\"NoutƒÉ»õi. Intoleran»õƒÉ\\", in Tribuna Poporului, Nr. 110/1900, p. 3 Laura inherited all his wealth, which sparked a Mocioni family feud. Already a licensed postal worker, she continued Mocioni's work as a postmaster. She died on the estate in August 1892, aged 53,\\"Ce e nou? Necrolog\\", in Familia, Nr. 32/1892, p. 382 and was buried at his side. In her late years, she had carried on with Mocioni philanthropy work, but only servicing the local Serb community and punishing Romanian ingratitude. According to Tribuna, the \\"new generation\\" of Romanians, \\"more enlightened than the earlier one\\", was expressing shame and regret for having alienated her. By then, a scandal had erupted over Mocioni's remains. The church remained a property of the Karlovci Patriarchy, which in 1900 refused to hand over the body for reburial in the Mocioni mausoleum. It cited texts which condemned the separation in death of husband and wife, but the Romanian press suspected that such resistance was proof of \\"intolerant\\" Serb nationalism. A separation was eventually made, and Andrei was reburied in the new location. The various Mocioni estates went to brothers Alexandru and Eugen. Some were inherited by Eugen's sons, before passing to Ecaterina Mocioni and her husband, Jen≈ë, Count Teleki; others went to the Bukovinan baron Ioan Mocsony- St√¢rcea, who was Alexandru's adoptive son.Colta, pp. 77‚Äì83 The core manor at Foeni was nevertheless inherited by the Cs√°vossy counts, while his horses continued to be bred by the Austrians Jakob Haas and Ludwig Deutsch. The property was pillaged by peasants during the revolutionary events which marked the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918. According to one Romanian account, this incident provided the Hungarian Royal Gendarmerie with an excuse to murder Romanians.Nicolae Boc»ôan, \\"The Banatian Revolution from the Autumn of 1918 in the Collective Memory \\", in Transylvanian Review, Vol. XXIV, Issue 4, Winter 2015, p. 29 Most other assets were kept by the surviving family following the establishment of Greater Romania, when Anton Jr bought back the Foeni mansion, hoping to turn it into a cultural club. According to historian Vicen»õiu Bugariu, by 1930 Andrei Mocioni was already forgotten, a victim of \\"ignorance and indifference\\". This trend was censured by the Banat politician Sever Bocu. Although a critic of \\"Mocionist\\" conservatism in Austria-Hungary, during the interwar he became noted for his work to preserve and shed light on the family's contribution as a \\"moral dynasty\\".Munteanu, pp. 8, 20, 47, 51‚Äì52, 58, 64‚Äì65, 91 Bocu wrote Andrei Mocioni's profile as a study in national pedagogy,Mure»ôan & Suciu, p. 90 declaring that any Banatian unaware of the Mocionis' role \\"is a Banatian in name only\\".Munteanu, p. 48 Mocioni, or any other of his relatives, is also mentioned in the dialectical Banatian poetry of the interwar. Samples include Gheorghe G√¢rda's CƒÉ tƒÉt BƒÉnatu-i fruncea! (\\"And Yet the Banat Is Tops\\") and Cassian R.

With the death of Anton Jr in 1943, the direct Mocioni lineage was extinguished; however, interest in the family was still kept alive by Bocu's nephew, the scholar Ion D. Suciu.Mure»ôan & Suciu, pp. 89‚Äì90, 92‚Äì94, 106 In the 1950s, the estates were subject to nationalization under the communist regime, which turned the Foeni complex into a public bathhouse, and then into a storage room for chemicals. Following the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the mansion was re-purposed as a cultural club and mainly functioned as a disco, before being taken over by the local town hall.

The movie has received widespread interest from the Turkish media and had an outstanding performance in the box-office. The film's Turkish title Issƒ±z Adam is a triple entendre, as it can mean \\"Abandoned Man\\", \\"My Abandoned Island\\", and \\"My Lonely Ada\\", Ada being the name of the female lead character. Plot The film follows the lives of two people who live in Istanbul who happen to meet each other in a second-hand book shop. Alper is from Tarsus. He and Ada live different lives; Alper is a free-spirited man in his thirties who is the owner and the cook of a popular restaurant whereas Ada is a humble girl in her late twenties who designs child costumes for a living. Alper follows Ada to her shop after the initial meeting but she acts coldly towards him and insists that she doesn't want a serious relationship and throws coffee on him. She later calls him to apologize and Alper asks her out once more. She is reluctant at first but agrees to have dinner at his house and they end up sleeping together. It's the beginning of a moving relationship between them. But soon things begin to go wrong. Alper feels his freedom flying away and the need to utilize prostitutes, as he did before he met Ada. He can't bear the weight of a serious relationship whereas Ada is deeply in love and unable to sense anything unusual. Despite Alper's mother's warning about never letting Ada go, Alper breaks up with her just when their relationship seemed at its best. Ada is devastated and slaps him in the face before leaving. Alper seems happy for himself and for her after the break-up but then falls into depression and feels remorse. Four years later, Alper is taking his friend's son to the cinema where he meets Ada, now married with a daughter and living in London. Their conversation is polite and they act as if they were over each other, but in their thoughts we learn that Ada secretly visited Alper's mother and found out more about his past; and that Alper sits every day in front of her shop imagining that she still works there. They share one tearful last hug before Alper leaves confused and desolate as they look at each other for the last time. Ada imagines a happy ending, an ending they deserved. The film mainly emphasises the desolation and seclusion of modern life and its consequences on the romantic relationship between Alper and Ada.

Austrian Imperial Minister of Trade. He was captain of the frigate SMS Novara, including during the world voyage (Novara-Expedition) in 1857-1859. \\"W√ºllerstorf-Urbair, Bernhard Freiherr von\\", aeiou Encyclopedia, 2008, webpage: aeiou-Bern-W-Urbair.  Life  He was born on 29 January 1816 in Triest (K√ºstenland, today in Italy). After attending the grammar schools (Gymnasium) in Padua and in Ofen, in 1828 he joined the pioneer-cadet school in Tulln. As a cadet of the 40th Infantry Regiment, he accepted the 1833 invitation to move to the Austrian Imperial War Navy. Immediately commanding a ship, he had to acquire his further education largely through self-study. Line ship transported in 1839, he seized the opportunity to be assigned to the observatory in Vienna, where he was taught by astronomers Littrow and Schaub. After the end of these studies, he was with the management of the Naval Observatory in Venice and the lessons in astronomy and nautical at the Naval Academy operation. Through his elegant appearance and his winning nature, he also quickly connected to the Venetian society. Immediately after his marriage to Anna O'Connor of Connaught on 12 April 1848, Venice broke from the revolution. He fled the city with his young wife and, in the course of the escape, her death took place. He traveled immediately to Trieste, where Field Marshal Lieutenant Gyulay had gathered the true-believer remnants of the Navy. He was an important employee of the reorganization concerned with the Vice- Admiral . In 1849, he became Lieutenant. The next few years passed, in alternating between staff work and ship commands. In 1855, he was adviser to the new navy commander Archduke Ferdinand Max. Soon he was able to advance his enthusiastic lord's plan for a voyage around the world: he assisted with its planning in 1856. As line-captain and Commodore of the frigate , already at the time, he commanded the expedition, which lasted from 30 April 1857 to 26 August 1859. Numerous research findings, rich collections for the Vienna museums, and high reputation for the Imperial Navy were the main results of the voyage around the world. Due to his scientific knowledge, he assisted all oceanographic, hydrographic and meteorological observations. For his scientific achievements, he was added in 1863 as an honorary member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. His 3-volume report was published, in 1861, as \\"Journey of the Austrian Frigate Novara around the Earth in 1857, 1858, 1859 under the command of Commodore B. von W√ºllersdorf-Urbair\\". \\"Biodiversity Heritage Library\\", BiodiversityLibrary.org, 2008, webpage: BiodL-1404. After a deployment in the waters around which the free throngs of Garibaldi threatened Sicily, he became Rear Admiral and representative of the navy commander at Reichsrat in Vienna. In 1864, he led the German-Danish War, a squadron into the North Sea according to where Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, even before his arrival, the Battle of Heligoland (1864) had beaten. This suspended a little justified criticism of him. In autumn 1865, he was asked by Prime Minister Count Richard Belcredi to head the Department of Commerce. As Minister in a politically controversial government (in the contemporary press also as a \\"Three Count Ministry\\", referring to him as next to Prime Minister Count Belcredi still the Counts Larisch-M√∂nich and Mensdorff-Pouilly), he tried concluding trade treaties, plus dealt with the communications and postal services. He also led a program designed to supplement the rail network, which largely came to be implemented (see Memorandum 1866, \\"A railway network for the Austrian monarchy\\"). Under his leadership office, the expansion of the port of Trieste was also addressed. The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 led him to resign. Bernhard von W√ºllerstorf-Urbair died in Bolzano, which was then part of the old county of Tyrol. He is buried in the cemetery of the Old Parish Church of Gries in the district.

In 1900 Ament was elected President of the North China Christian Endeavor Union.Porter, 180. =First furlough: ministry in Ohio (1885‚Äì1888)= Due to the severe illness of Ament's mother, Emily Hammond Ament, Ament accepted the call to pastor a 250 member Congregational church in Medina, Ohio (about 30 kilometres from Cleveland, Ohio) so that he could care for her. During his three years there, he built up a strong church.Woman's Board of Missions of the Interior, Mission Studies: Woman's Work in Foreign Lands 29‚Äì30 (1911‚Äì1912):253. Published by Woman's Board of Missions of the Interior of the Congregational Church, 1911; Porter, 90. While in Ohio, Ament became the president of the Ohio Christian Endeavor Union,William Shaw, The Evolution of an Endeavorer: An Autobiography. (Christian Endeavor World, 1924):228. In 1887 the Aments had their fourth (and final) child, William Sheffield Ament (born 25 July 1887 in Medina, Ohio; died 1951), their only child to survive childhood.; Dictionary of American Biography 1:241.

Rawls and Richard J. Orsi, A Golden State: Mining and Economic Development in Gold Rush California (California History Sesquicentennial Series, 2) (University of California Press, 1999):269. =Second missionary term in China (1888‚Äì1897)= In August 1888, Ament and his family returned to Beijing to resume their missionary duties. DAB 1:241. Death of Emily Ament At 9.30 am on Monday, 27 February 1893, the Aments' daughter, Emily died in Beijing of diphtheria at the age of eight and a half. after a week's illness.; Porter, 116, 118. Funds were donated to establish on Fifth Street, Beijing, near the Congregational Church's North Chapel, the Emily Ament Memorial School for the education of Chinese girls.Porter, 116, 122. By late 1899, the school was re-located to Sixth Street.Porter, 164. Editor North China News During 1893 Ament became the editor of the North China News, a Chinese monthly newspaper, with an initial circulation in excess of 550 copies per month.Porter, 124. Among Ament's other duties were being the ABCFM mission treasurer; postmaster for both the ABCFM and Presbyterian Mission; manager of the mission book room; manager of the Bible book store; and pastoral care of three congregations. In addition, he continued to serve as an evangelist.Porter, 124‚Äì125. From October 1894, Ament became superintendent of the boys' school, as well as the preacher at the Beijing South Chapel.Porter, 128. In 1896, Ament presented a paper entitled \\"The Spiritual Needs of Native Christians\\", in which he decried mere numerical addition of church members, indicating that \\"The one thing to be arrived at is a spiritual Church in China.\\"Ament, \\"Spiritual Needs\\", in The Evangelisation of China, 44; Porter, 135. =Second furlough (1897‚Äì1898)= From spring 1897 Ament spent part of the year on furlough in Owosso, Michigan and was active in his home church, the Owosso First Congregational Church, and was responsible for re-invigorating the missionary focus of that church. During summer 1897 he preached daily at the Owosso Y.M.C.A..Porter, 143. =Third missionary term in China (1898‚Äì1901)= On 4 September 1898, Ament left his wife and son, Willie, in Owosso to care for his mother, and his deceased sister's daughter.Porter, 144, 205. Ament returned to Beijing on 8 October 1898, to confront increased anti-foreign opposition as a consequence of the overthrow of the Chinese emperor in a coup d'etat.Porter, 145. In 1898, Ament had a paper \\"The Religions of China\\" published in The Student Missionary Appeal: Addresses at the Third International Convention of the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions, in which he indicated: \\"Some one has said that you cannot tell the truth about the Chinese without lying. They are the most irreligious people on the face of the earth.\\"The Student Missionary Appeal: Addresses at the Third International Convention of the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions (Student volunteer movement for foreign missions, 1898): 336ff. In December 1898, Ament was notified that Oberlin College, his alma mater, had decided to award him an honorary Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) degree.Porter, 153. By the end of 1900, Ament had been responsible for planting 17 of the 22 churches associated with the Peking branch of the China ABCFM mission.Porter, 211. The Boxer Uprising and its aftermath (1900) Ament was captured by Boxers while on an expedition with another missionary about 100 kilometres from Beijing, however was able to escape unharmed.\\"Letters from China\\", The New York Times (22 June 1900):2; https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1900/06/22/102436392.pdf; \\"Escaped from Boxers\\", The New York Times (15 July 1900):2. During the Boxer Uprising of 1900, on Thursday 7 June 1900, Ament requested a military escort from Edwin H. Conger, the United States Minister to China, to allow the evacuation of the besieged ABCFM missionaries in Tungchow (now the Tongzhou District of Beijing) (located 21 kilometres south-east of Beijing). As Conger refused to provide the escort as he believed he needed all his troops in Beijing, Ament himself travelled alone and unarmed to Tungchow by train with 16 carts, and facilitated the successful evacuation of 24 members of the missionary community and a number of Chinese helpers.Richard O'Connor, The Spirit Soldiers: A Historical Narrative of the Boxer Rebellion (Putnam, 1973): 64; Bessie Smith Ewing, Diary (Saturday 9 June 1900), in Death Throes of a Dynasty, 73; Robert Kennaway Douglas and Jeremiah Whipple Jenks, China (P.F. Collier & son, 1913):300. The Tungchow missionaries \\"succeeded in getting up to Peking, with their wives and families, on 8 June, thanks to the pluck and energy of Mr. Ament\\".Robert Hart, \\"These from the Land of Sinim.\\": Essays on the Chinese Question (Chapman & Hall, 1901): 15. During the subsequent attack on the Methodist missionary compound by the Boxers in Beijing, Ament was reportedly the last missionary to leave the compound on the afternoon of Wednesday, 13 June 1900.\\"The Rev. Dr. William S. Ament\\", New York Times (9 January 1909); \\"Cry From Missionaries\\", New York Times (12 June 1900); Bessie Smith Ewing, Diary, Thursday, 14 June 1900, In Death Throes, 77‚Äì79. A week after the evacuation of the Methodist compound, Ament, despite increased Boxer activity, returned to the Methodist compound to assess the possibility of retrieving goods left behind after their evacuation. Ament then organised twenty other missionaries and 60 Chinese to return to the compound to remove as many stores as possible which contributed greatly to their preservation during the siege. \\"This aid to which so many were indebted was the result of Mr. Ament's investigation.\\"A Missionary Observer, letter to the Editor 9 March 1901; \\"Mission Spirit in China\\", The New York Times (12 March 1901). During the subsequent fifty-five-day siege, Ament sheltered in the British Legation in the Beijing Legation Quarter, where he had responsibility for looking after confiscated goods.Arnold Henry Savage Landor, China and the Allies, Volume 2 (London: William Heinemann, 1901), 72. While Ament through his own personal initiative was able to rescue the ABCFM missionaries at Tungchow, there was still significant loss of lives. Thirteen ABCFM adult missionaries and five children were killed by the Boxers.List of the Martyred Protestant Missionaries during the Boxer Crisis of 1900#American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions Included were Miss Mary Susan Morrill (born 1863 in Portland, Maine) and Miss Annie Allender Gould, among the eleven foreign missionaries, four children, and about fifty Chinese Christians killed in Baoding from 30 June 1900.Paul Hattaway, China's Christian Martyrs (Oxford, UK and Grand Rapids, MI: Monarch, 2007):196‚Äì210 Additionally, there was much damage to ABCFM property. The ABCFM Mission compound was razed, as was the Emily Ament Memorial School (named in honour of Ament's daughter) on Sixth Street, Peking.Luella Miner, China's Book of Martyrs: A Record of Heroic Martyrdoms and Marvelous Deliverances of Chinese Christians During the Summer of 1900, (Jennings and Pye, 1903): 240; Robert Hart; John King Fairbank; Katherine Frost Bruner; Elizabeth MacLeod Matheson; and James Duncan Campbell, The I. G. in Peking: Letters of Robert Hart, Chinese Maritime Customs, 1868‚Äì1907 (Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1975): 879. Ament estimated that by the end of July 1900 that losses for the ABCFM Peking station was about $71,000 gold.Porter, 189. From 13 September 1900, Ament, and an assistant, Reverend Elwood Gardner Tewksbury (born 1865, West Newbury, Massachusetts), accompanied by the U.S. 6th Cavalry, searched the areas adjacent to Beijing for Boxers, collecting indemnities for Christians who had been killed by the Boxers, and ordering the burning of some homes and even executing suspected Boxers.Oggel, Mark Twain Encyclopedia 23. Ament had been chosen \\"as the one who would be honorable and just to all.\\"Martha Emily Parmelee Rose, The Western Reserve of Ohio and Some of Its Pioneers, Places and Women's Clubs, National American Woman Suffrage Association Collection (Library of Congress) (Euclid Print. Co., 1914): 133. Indemnities controversy (1901) In 1901 Ament became embroiled in a controversy regarding his activities (and those of other Christian missionaries, including the Roman Catholic Pierre-Marie-Alphonse Favier) subsequent to the Boxer Rebellion. \\"In the war's aftermath came a war of words. Missionary triumphalism clashed with the sarcastic sallies of Mark Twain, who lampooned the apologias for looting given by American missionary William Scott Ament.\\"Bickers & Tiedemann, Boxers, xv. An interview that Wilbur Chamberlin of the New York Sun conducted with Ament elevated the missionary question into a cause c√©l√®bre. =Mark Twain's critique= Mark Twain, was \\"an outspoken critic of American involvement in the Philippines and China\\",Maverick Marvin Harris, \\"China\\", 142, in The Mark Twain Encyclopedia. and \\"one of the mammoth figures in anti-imperialism, and certainly the foremost anti-imperialist literary figure\\".Everett H. Emerson, Mark Twain: A Literary Life (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000):257. Twain decided to use the Sun article as the basis of a sustained attack on both the missionary enterprise and its imperialist tendencies. According to Foner, Twain used the conduct of Ament to \\"drive home the point that the missionary movement served as a front for imperialism.Philip Sheldon Foner, Mark Twain: Social Critic: Social Critic (International Publishers, 1958): 280. Twain especially targeted Ament in this article. According to Susan Harris:‚ÄúTo the Person Sitting in Darkness,‚Äù which Mark Twain published in the North American Review in 1901, attacks Western imperialism as it was manifesting itself in South Africa, China, Cuba, and the Philippines. It names its villains ‚Äì [William] McKinley, Joseph Chamberlain, the Kaiser, the Czar ‚Äì and their instruments, especially the Reverend William Ament, a Congregationalist minister who was affiliated with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.Harris; Albert Bigelow Paine, Mark Twain: A Biography, Chapter 214 After the publication of \\"To the Person Sitting in Darkness\\" in The North American Review for February 1901, as the opening article, there was a huge controversy. This article \\"created a national sensation as well as a savage debate between Twain and the American Board of Foreign Missions.\\"J.C.B. Kinch, \\"Europe and Elsewhere\\", The Mark Twain Encyclopedia, 261. Ament was subsequently attacked in The New York Times;,\\"A Missionary Arrested\\", The New York Times (5 February 1900):5; [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/02/07/117954646.pdf \\"Our Missionaries in China\\", New York Times (7 February 1901):8; \\"Missionaries' Indemnities\\", New York Times (31 March 1901) by John Ames Mitchell, the editor of Life magazine;J.A.

American Ethical Union. (S. Burns Weston, 1901):92‚Äì93. In the same publication, however, referring to Ament: \\"The truth of the matter is, that the missionary has been made the scapegoat by conspiring and corrupt native officials, and by immoral foreigners now in China and their ignorant brethren here in the United States.\\"(35) Ament was defended both by missionaries and the proponents of imperialism. Their reaction was swift and predictable. They charged Twain with treason. \\"Twain's caustic indictment generated, in turn, a defensive apologetics on the part of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Both Judson Smith (born 28 June 1837 in Middlefield, Massachusetts; died 29 June 1906 in Roxbury, Massachusetts), who had been one of Ament's professors at Oberlin College,General Council of the Congregational and Christian Churches of the United States, The Year Book of the Congregational Christian Churches of the United States of America (General Council of the Congregational and Christian Churches of the United States Executive Committee, 1907):38; Daniel Coit Gilman; Harry Thurston Peck; and Frank Moore Colby, eds. The New International Encyclop√¶eia Volume 18 (Dodd, Mead and company, 1909):261. the corresponding secretary of Ament's sponsoring mission (1884‚Äì1906), The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM); and Gilbert Reid (independent missionary, formerly a member of the American Presbyterian mission) claimed that missionary looting was \\"high ethics,\\" and added that American missionaries had only looted to provide money for the relief of Chinese Christians.\\"Bickers & Tiedemann, Boxers, 104; Albert Bigelow Paine, Mark Twain: A Biography, Chapter 214 Smith demanded an apology from Twain.The Mark Twain Encyclopedia, 23. Replying in a letter to the New York Tribune, Twain insisted that Ament had arraigned himself.Philip Sheldon Foner, Mark Twain: Social Critic: Social Critic (International Publishers, 1958): 280; The Mark Twain Encyclopedia, 23. At the end of January 1901 fourteen members of the North China Mission of the ABCFM endorsed the actions of Ament and Tewksbury.\\"Action of Missionaries Indorsed\\", The New York Times (22 March 1901): 6. On 21 March 1901, the Peking Missionary Association demanded Twain retract the statements he made attacking Ament.Howard Culbertson, \\"Missions History: It Happened Today\\"; \\"Demand That Twain Retract\\", The New York Times (22 March 1901):16; Quoted in Porter, 236. After Ament's death in January 1909, Judson Smith's successor, Dr. James Levi Barton (1855‚Äì1936)David M. Stowe, \\"James Levi Barton\\", in The Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions, 46. Ed. Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1999. Gerald H. Anderson. also defended him and his actions.J.L. Barton, \\"A Loss to Both China and America\\", The Congregationalist (1909); quoted in Porter, 365. Ament was not just defended by his colleagues or other Christian organisations. He was defended in an editorial in the Boston Journal;,\\"A Humorist Astray\\", Boston Journal; quoted in Porter, 236‚Äì237. by prominent New York lawyer, and future United States Secretary of State, Henry Stimson;\\"The Missionaries: They Will Still Go On\\".

When Ament became aware of the criticism of his activities and the subsequent controversy, he was affected adversely.Miss N.N. Russell, quoted in Porter 210. Ament admitted the strain in a letter to his wife on Sunday, 27 January 1901: \\"I am doing what I do not recall that I ever did before, remaining at home deliberately and missing all the services. I need the rest and felt that it was imperative. You see there is no let up for me. It is a constant strain from morning till night.\\"Porter, 221. On 17 February 1901, the New York Times issued a retraction after receiving a different account of Ament's actions from Dr Judson Smith of the ABCFM, based on Ament's letter of 13 November 1900 to Smith. The Times reported that in Ament's own letter he indicated the compensation for the losses of the converts obtained by him had been \\"by appealing to the sense of justice among the villages where our people had lived.\\" The Times concluded: \\"It seems that we have been led into doing an injustice to him ... In that case we have to express our sincere regret.\\"Editorial, The New York Times (17 February 1901) In March the New York Sun printed an interview with Ament that indicated that the indemnity was not thirteen times the loss, but only one and one-third of the loss. Twain indicated that he could not comment for publication, but would respond in the April edition of The North American Review. His representative indicated: \\"He hopes that both the Peking Missionary Association and the American Board of Foreign Missions will like it, but he has his doubts.\\"\\"Demand That Twain Retract\\", The New York Times (22 March 1901):16 In response to an open letter from the ABCFM demanding an apology, Twain penned \\"To My Missionary Critics,\\" which offered no apologies, although it ended by acknowledging that missionaries no doubt mean well. The essay, originally entitled \\"The Case of Rev. Dr. Ament, Missionary,\\" was published in the North American Review in April 1901.Emerson, 258. Twain explored the delicate moral difference between a demand thirteen times as great as it should be and a demand that was only one and a third times the correct amount. As Paine explains, \\"The point had been made by the board that it was the Chinese custom to make the inhabitants of a village responsible for individual crimes; and custom, likewise, to collect a third in excess of the damage, such surplus having been applied to the support of widows and orphans of the slain converts.\\"Albert Bigelow Paine, Mark Twain: A Biography, Chapter 214 Ament arrested In February 1901 Ament and two British subjects were arrested by German and French troops near Tungchow, and charged with trying to extort money from the Chinese villagers.J.A, Mitchell, Life (1901): 154. While the two British subjects were released, Ament was held pending an appeal to United States Minister Conger.\\"A Missionary Arrested\\", The New York Times (5 February 1900):5 Ament was subsequently released at the direction of the German military commander, Count Alfred von Waldersee.\\"Mr. Ament Still in Custody: But a Dispatch to London Says Count von Waldersee Has Ordered His Release.\\" New York Times (6 February 1901):6.; Porter, 221. Chamberlin indicated that the French and Germans, under pressure from the Americans, released him, insisting that he was never under arrest.Chamberlin, Ordered, 253‚Äì254. On 15 March 1901, Ament accused German soldiers of plundering the city of Man-Ming, a hundred kilometres from Beijing. Ament said that \\"they ransacked and desecrated a Christian chapel and despoiled the women of their trinkets, even tearing the rings out of their ears and ill-treating them in other ways. The Germans replied by charging the missionaries themselves with partaking of the plunder.\\"A History of the Precious Metals from the Earliest Times to the Present, 355. =Third furlough (1901‚Äì1902)= Ament left Beijing on 26 March 1901 to return to the United States to make his case, clear his name and defend the reputation of the other missionaries.The Current Encyclopedia: A Monthly Record of Human Progress. Volume 1. (Modern Research Society, 1901):37. On 1 April 1901, Ament, refusing to be a scapegoat in the affair, cabled the following to the ABCFM: > Nothing has been done except after consultation with colleagues and the full > approval of the United States Minister. I will secure a certificate from Mr. > [Edwin H.] Conger to that effect.William Ament, cable to ABCFM, 1 April > 1901, in The Open Court: Devoted to the Science of Religion, the Religion of > Science, and the Extension of the Religious Parliament Idea by Paul Carus > (The Open Court Pub. Co., 1901):329. Ament arrived back in the United States on 25 April 1901. On the same day, The New York Times reprinted an interview with Ament and Edwin H. Conger, the United States Minister to China (1898‚Äì1905), originally conducted in Kobe, Japan on 6 April 1901 while both men were en route to the United States. Conger defended the actions of Ament, indicating confiscated goods had been sold to ensure the survival of Chinese Christians.\\"The Missionaries Defended: Interviews in Japan with Minister Conger and Dr. Ament: Goods Sold to Succor Native Christians.\\" Kobe Herald (24 April 1901). Reprinted in The New York Times (25 April 1901):2. Conger indicated that the missionaries \\"only appropriated their property for justifiable ends.\\"A History of the Precious Metals from the Earliest Times to the Present, 358. In May 1901 Ament responded to his critics during an extended visit to the United States of America in 1901.\\"Dr. Ament Answers Critics\\", The New York Times (10 May 1901) In response to the criticisms of Twain and others, Ament denied that the missionaries forced the Chinese to accept Christianity, and that \\"We treat their beliefs kindly, try to extract the good, and never interfere with their customs, except where they interfere with Christianity.\\"New York Times (10 May 1901) On 16 May 1901, Ament addressing guests at the third annual Asiatic Society of America dinner in New York, again defended himself and his fellow missionaries: > The missionaries in China, of whom I am proud to be one, represent a class > of American citizens whose work in the Orient have been purposefully > misrepresented ... The missionaries' words have been twisted, wring > interpretations made. The persistency of work like this can only justify the > feeling that the root of this un-American warfare is due, not so much to > what is seen or known of the deeds of missionaries, but the opposition to > Christianity itself. The purpose was fixed before China was reached at all, > and this murderous spirit stops not at injustice to individuals.\\"The > Asiastic Society Honors Mr. Conger\\" By the end of May 1901 ABCFM Board secretary Dr Judson Smith silenced Ament, as he believed further comments were damaging Ament and his colleagues. Smith attempted a final defence of Ament and the other missionaries in May in an essay entitled \\"The Missionaries and Their Critics.\\"See Judson Smith, \\"The Missionaries and their Critics,\\" North American Review 172 (May 1901); Oggel, 23. Twain was unrepentant, referring to \\"Christian pirates like Ament and professional hypocrites and liars like Rev. Judson Smith of the American Board ... Whenever you ask people to support them [foreign missions] Joe, do bar China. Their presence there is forbidden by the Bible and by every sentiment of humanity ‚Äì and fair dealing. And they have done vast mischief there. I would bar no other country.\\"Mark Twain, quoted in William E. Phipps, Mark Twain's Religion (Mercer University Press, 2003): 212. =Fourth missionary term in China (1902‚Äì1908)= In 1902, Ament and his family returned to Beijing, where he resumed his responsibilities as the pastor the South Chapel of the Congregational Church; and as a trustee of the board of the Methodist Episcopal Church's Peking University (later re-named Yenching University).Porter, 364; http://sarawakiana.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-father- went-to-yen-ching-university.html By 1902, North China was reported as being pacified. Fellow ABCFM missionary, Howard Spilman Galt (1872‚Äì1948) reported: \\"Everything seems to be remarkably quiet in the field where Dr. Ament took the first steps in reconstructing the work just a year ago. In no place could we discover any but the friendliest feelings toward him. Especially did the officials speak well of him.\\"\\"North China Seems Pacified\\", The New York Times (22 March 1902):9; David Shavit, Galt, \\"Howard Spilman\\" in The United States in Asia: A Historical Dictionary, 182. Advocate of Christian unity Ament was an ardent advocate for the \\"federation among Christian forces\\" in China, and supported the comity principle, whereby mission groups would be assigned their own areas for evangelisation to avoid direct competition with other agencies. In 1907 Ament, as Chairman on the Committee on Church Union and Comity, presented a paper to the China Centenary Missionary Conference held at Shanghai.Porter, 369. Missionary college, Rev. J.P. Jones, ABCFM missionary to India, wrote: > His broad Catholic spirit made him a leader among his peers in China in the > advocacy of comity and federation among the Christian forces of that great > land of China. The missionary body wisely chose him as the chairman of the > Committee on Christian Union, of the Shanghai Conference. Few know how > thoroughly and eagerly he studied this fundamental question, but we all know > how eloquently and convincingly he advocated the cause of union in his > report at the great conference. And Christian union in that far-off land > will owe more to his sagacity and eager advocacy than any one can now > realize.Dr. J.P. Jones, Madura Mission, India Letter (January 1909); quoted > in Porter, 358. Illness From late July 1908, Ament underwent a series of four operations in the seaside town of Pei Tai Ho (now Beidaihe), Hebei to relieve a serious septic medical condition. He was able to return to Beijing in October, but by 8 November he had developed severe pressure on his brain, necessitating the decision to repatriate him to the United States. The Aments left Beijing on 24 November 1908, and departed China for the final time from Shanghai on 1 December 1908 on the Nippon Maru. After transiting Kobe, Japan, they arrived in San Francisco on Christmas Day in 1908. Ament was transferred to the Lane Hospital, but his condition was deemed inoperable.Porter, 342‚Äì347. =Death= Despite being \\"a man of unusual physical endurance, ... after thirty-six years of service and much intense strain\\",Mission Studies 29‚Äì30:253. Ament died at the Lane Hospital in San Francisco on 6 January 1909, at the age of 57, with both his wife, and son, Will, with him. Medical authorities determined that : \\"An abscess of the brain, resulting from septic conditions, was the source of the later symptoms and disabilities.\\"Porter, 347. Ament was buried in Owosso, Michigan on Tuesday, 12 January 1909 after a funeral conducted in his home church, the First Congregational Church.Porter, 349. Memorial services were held for Ament on Sunday, 17 January 1909 at Owosso, Michigan; Medina, Ohio; and at the Dwight Place Congregational Church, New Haven, Connecticut. A final memorial service was held on Sunday 14 February 1909 at the Teng Shih K'ou (now Deng Shi Kou) Congregational Church in Beijing,William Scott Ament: Addresses Given at the Memorial Services Held at Teng Shih K'ou Congregational Church, Peking, China, Sunday, February Fourteenth, Nineteen Hundred Nine. North China Union College Press, 1909. with the Chinese language service at 2.00 pm, and the English language service at 4.30 pm.Porter, 349, 351‚Äì352. Evaluation of Ament and his ministry Missionary colleague Charles Ewing in a letter dated 2 January 1899, provided an evaluation of Ament and his ministry: > Dr. Ament was the preacher yesterday and held his audience well throughout > his rather extended discourse. ... I suppose there can be little doubt that > Dr. Ament is the best Chinese [language] preacher in the city. The people > like to hear him. And then, he is exceedingly good in personal work, taking > an interest in men individually and winning them. This kind of pastoral work > is just as invaluable here as it is at home. ... In every way, it is a great > advantage to have the senior member of the station [Peking] back on the > field and at work again. And then, Dr. Ament is a great worker. How he gets > through with so much work, I don't know. I was always said that he could do > two men's work ...Charles Ewing to Judson Smith, 2 January 1899, Peking, > Death Throes of a Dynasty, 58‚Äì59. A colleague called Ament the \\"ideal missionary\\" in recognition of his dedication, courage, proficiency and expertise in China and the Chinese language, and leadership of his flock of Chinese Christians.Thompson, Larry Clinton, William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion.

This audio drama was produced by Big Finish Productions. This is the last of a two-part story, the first part being Sisters of the Flame. Synoposis The Doctor and Lucie investigate the leader of the Cult of Morbius, who is laying siege to Gallifrey. Plot The Doctor and Lucie protest as the Sisters force them over to the dispersal chamber. The Doctor insists that because he‚Äôd done everything they‚Äôd asked of him, the very least they owe him is an explanation. Orthena accepts this and reveals that Zarodnix is the leader of the Cult of Morbius. Lucie confirms that she‚Äôd heard this too and the Doctor is surprised to learn that she was briefed by Straxus ‚Äì but they‚Äôre both still confused as the Doctor has no idea who Zarodnix is and Lucie doesn‚Äôt know who Morbius is! Even when the Doctor explains that Morbius was a Time Lord dictator who wanted to take over the Universe, Lucie still can‚Äôt see what the problem is if he's already dead, but when the Doctor learns that Zarodnix is a rich intergalactic businessman who lives on Karn, the pieces start to fall into place. Haspira believes the Doctor is playing for time and wonders what makes him any different from all the other Time Lords. Lucie realises they must have killed other Time Lords, but Orthena says they were mere bookworms, academics and small-minded researchers with no experience of the Universe outside Gallifrey, whereas the Doctor actually fought Morbius and has a right to know the truth before he dies. She explains that the Zarodnix Corporation drove the Sisterhood from Karn and mined out the surface of their planet. After the Sisterhood found a new home, they discovered Zarodnix has a dangerous obsession with Morbius and has dedicated his entire life to collecting every surviving artefact relating to the despot. Haspira was given the task of infiltrating the Zarodnix Corporation and the Trell were easily manipulated and soon trusted her‚Ä¶but then she learned that Zarodnix planned to revive Morbius‚Ä¶ On Karn, Kristof Zarodnix arrives on level minus 1,087 where the main laboratory is located. After confirming his voice print, retina scan and blood DNA sample, the security computer grants him access. He's overjoyed when he learns that the latest extraction experiment was totally successful and he holds up a molecular-sealed specimen capsule and lovingly admires its engineering. He congratulates the Trell on their work and prepares to fulfil his lifelong vision, but then they‚Äôre interrupted by news that the incoming spacecraft is about to land. Zarodnix doesn‚Äôt care and gives the Trell permission to arrest the occupants or kill them, whatever they prefer. Aboard Haspira's ship, Rosto informs Straxus that they‚Äôre about to land, but the Time Lord panics and insists that the Marshal take them back up into space. None of the controls are working and it's not long before the ship settles on the surface. Straxus appears genuinely terrified and Rosto can‚Äôt understand why he's so frightened. The Doctor reminds the Sisters that the brain of Morbius fell to its death in the deepest canyon on Karn centuries ago and no part of him could have survived. Orthena admits that they don‚Äôt know what Zarodnix's plan is and all they know is that he's been scouring space and time with one aim ‚Äì to find a Time Lord. The Sisterhood warned the Time Lords, who immediately quarantined Gallifrey and recalled all TARDISes, then they used the Timescoop to track down any Time Lords who didn‚Äôt respond. Orthena says that Zarodnix's time particle monitors were able to follow the movements of the Timescoop, which is how his agents found and captured the Doctor. Haspira was there to ‚Äòrescue‚Äô him, but Haspira is now keen to have the Doctor and Lucie executed‚Ä¶ In the laboratory, Zarodnix and the Trell are implanting the specimen capsule into a cabinet-like device called the Genetrotron when news arrives that security scans show one of the occupants of the captured spaceship is a Time Lord. Zarodnix is delighted and orders him to be brought down immediately. Rosto and Straxus hear banging outside the spaceship. Rosto suggests opening the hatch as Zarodnix's people are quite within their rights to arrest them, but Straxus says Zarodnix is a maniac and they have to find a way off the planet quickly. Suddenly the airlock blows open and the Trell storm in, grabbing hold of Rosto and immediately implanting him with augmentation nanocytes. He cries out and collapses, then the Trell turn their attention to Straxus. Haspira demands that the Doctor and Lucie be placed in the dispersal chamber, and despite their protests, the two travellers are dragged inside and the door is closed behind them. Reluctantly Orthena gives the order for the machine to be switched on. Inside, the Doctor is hopeful the chamber is so old it might not work, but they soon discover they‚Äôre not going to be so lucky. The Doctor bangs angrily on the door and demands they be released, but no one is listening. He tells Lucie they have about 37 seconds left and admits that he's run out of ideas. Lucie is remarkably calm and tells him she's glad that if they have to die at least they were reunited first. The Doctor wonders how Straxus was able to find Lucie and she suddenly remembers she took the Time Ring from him. The Doctor rebukes her for not mentioning it earlier, then he grabs it and activates the controls. Immediately an alarm sounds which tells them the dispersal chamber doesn‚Äôt like the energy the Ring is emitting. Outside the chamber, Orthena realises the power is being blocked by the energy of a Time Lord device. The Doctor and Lucie are worried when the Time Ring slows down and the dispersal chamber starts to power up again. The air inside starts getting really hot and the Doctor realises their molecules are getting agitated, so he bangs on the door again and calls out to the Sisters, warning them that Zarodnix already has a Time Lord prisoner. Moments later, the machine is switched off and the door opens. Orthena orders the Doctor to prove what he said and he shows her the Time Ring which belonged to Straxus, who was left behind on Haspira's ship which was en route to Karn. Orthena had already sensed that Lucie was near Karn when the Sisters teleported her away so she realises he's telling the truth. Whatever Zarodnix's crazy plan is, this means he already has the Time Lord he needs. As Straxus is brought before Zarodnix, the businessman orders his Trell servants not to damage him. Zarodnix uses a scanner to confirm the prisoner is a Time Lord, then he tells the Trell to prepare him immediately as they have no time to waste. Straxus warns him that what he's doing is forbidden by the High Council of the Time Lords, but Zarodnix reminds him they‚Äôre currently hiding away on Gallifrey. Straxus is dragged away, screaming‚Ä¶ Haspira insists they kill the Doctor and Lucie anyway ‚Äì just to be sure ‚Äì which makes Lucie realise how wrong she was when she first met Haspira and thought she was really nice. The Doctor returns to the idea of Zarodnix mining Karn and Haspira confirms that she saw mining equipment arrive on the planet. The Doctor realises Zarodnix must have located a fragment of Morbius's brain in the canyon, but that still doesn‚Äôt explain why he needs another Time Lord. Straxus is strapped onto a machine in the laboratory and Zarodnix takes the opportunity to mock the weak, defenceless Time Lord as a typical example of his race. He says they have such power, but they never fulfil their potential or put their greatness to any use. Straxus accuses him of being as deranged as Morbius, but Zarodnix is flattered by the comparison. Then he explains that Straxus is going to help him bring Morbius back to life‚Ä¶ The Doctor has realised Zarodnix's plan must involve genetic fusing. The Sisters can‚Äôt comprehend what he means, but Lucie has seen \\"Jurassic Park\\" and explains that Zarodnix has a piece of Morbius's brain which he can mix with Straxus's DNA to bring him back to life like a dead dinosaur. Orthena confirms that Zarodnix has access to the greatest minds in the known Universe so he's probably bought the know-how to blend their genetic codes. The essentials of Morbius are contained within the brain fragment and everything else Zarodnix needs to create an entirely new Time Lord can be extracted from Straxus. They realise they have to rescue him quickly. Orthena starts to chant in an attempt to teleport Straxus to safety, but the Doctor knows Karn will be protected by energy fields and they‚Äôll never reach him through mind power. Orthena believes all is lost, but the Doctor says they can still use his TARDIS him by coding the ship's co-ordinates to those in Straxus‚Äòs Time Ring. Straxus pleads with Zarodnix to stop the experiment, but to no avail. He tries to convince Zarodnix that Morbius is dead and there's no power in the Universe that can bring him back, but Zarodnix says he's devoted his entire life to studying Morbius's ideals and he believes his reputation is based on propaganda and lies. Among the artefacts he's obtained over the years include Morbius's Presidential robes, the technology he developed with his own hands and, not least, the very cells from his mind. With an infusion of living Time Lord DNA, there can now induce a new regeneration of Morbius. Orthena takes the Doctor and Lucie to the TARDIS, ignoring Haspira's pleads that she's making a mistake for letting them go free. The elder Sister says their only concern is that Morbius should never rise from the dead and this is now the Doctor's sacred mission also. She tells him the Sisterhood will be watching over him and he promises to do his best. As they enter the TARDIS, Lucie asks the Doctor what Orthena meant about watching over them, and he tells her no one's ever been sure about the true extent of the Sisterhood's psychic reach. The Doctor starts programming the controls for Karn, but Lucie asks why they can‚Äôt just go back in time and land inside Haspira's ship before it reached the planet. He says this would involve him crossing his own timeline, which would be very unwise. In fact, he's worried they may have already done that and he reminds her when the power shut down earlier as if the Eye of Harmony had never existed. He decides it's worth taking Lucie's advice and prepares to cross their timeline. Lucie is excited and wonders if they‚Äôll bump into themselves, but suddenly the TARDIS jolts and the Doctor tells them the Timescoop snuck up behind them and disabled the controls while he wasn‚Äôt looking. There's nothing he can do now to stop them being swallowed up by the black hole‚Ä¶ The TARDIS materialises and the Doctor and Lucie emerge to find themselves on Gallifrey. There's no one about and it seems they‚Äôve landed in some kind of holding area inside the Capitol. Bulek calls to them from the shadows and tells them the Timescoop is only employed to bring all their errant children back into the fold in the direst emergencies. He tells them the other Time Lords are all in deep isolation, but when he says he isn‚Äôt happy to discuss such matters in front of Lucie, she realises he's just scared about Morbius coming back from the dead. She reminds him that his ‚Äômate‚Äô Straxus is in trouble and says they were on the way to help him when they were diverted. Bulek knows they were preparing to break the rules of time and he insists they stay here rather than continue on their journey. Bulek's records indicate that Straxus was on his way back to Gallifrey and he expects him to arrive shortly, but the Doctor points out he's been following Straxus's Time Ring, not Straxus himself. In fact, Straxus is now in the hands of Zarodnix‚Ä¶ The processing of Straxus is now complete and Zarodnix is pleased to see he's still alive as they may need him again in the future. The Trell technicians confirm the gene-splicing was completed successfully, then they open up the Genetrotron cabinet and inside the cabinet they see a man wearing Presidential robes. Zarodnix asks Straxus if he can identify the man, but before he can answer, the man steps out and proudly announces that he is Morbius! Inside the TARDIS, the Doctor and Lucie are waiting for Bulek to shut down the Transduction Barriers so they can leave Gallifrey when the ship suddenly starts shaking. The Doctor realises the whole planet is being affected, so they race outside to find Bulek. He tells them they‚Äôre under attack from primitive interplanetary missiles and the earthquakes they‚Äôre feeling are the missiles bouncing off the Barriers. The ships in orbit are manned by the Trell and Lucie realises they must be working for Zarodnix. The Trell can‚Äôt get through the Barriers, but they‚Äôve been sent here to relay a hyperlink transmission from Karn. Everyone turns to look at a screen and they see Zarodnix next to a young man he refers to as his Lord Morbius. Morbius sends a message to the High Council of Time Lords ‚Äì he tells them he's returned and will show them as much mercy as they afforded him. When he receives no response, he assumes the Time Lords are too afraid, so the Doctor asks Bulek to open a channel, then he apologises for the delay and says they were all busy finishing off a particularly good jigsaw puzzle. Morbius recognises the Doctor from centuries ago, but the Doctor tells him he should give up his plans for galactic domination, because although he‚Äôll never succeed, he‚Äôll create endless carnage while trying. Morbius says there's nothing the Time Lords can do to stop his vengeance from consuming the cosmos, but the Doctor mocks him and says he's surrounded by yes-men like Zarodnix. Morbius produces a medallion-like device, which the Doctor identifies as the remote activator for a Stellar Manipulator. He assures Lucie it's harmless without the Manipulator itself and only one was ever constructed, but Morbius says he's mistaken. He presses a switch and says the Stellar Manipulator is now active. On Gallifrey, the lights start to fade and Bulek reports a power drain. Morbius is draining off the energy from the Eye of Harmony and soon the Time Lords will be left without the power of time travel and at the mercy of his Trell army. The Doctor switches the transmission off and tells Bulek to deactivate the Transduction Barriers. Gallifrey will be exposed soon enough anyway, so they need to leave in the TARDIS before it becomes immobilised. The Doctor and Lucie plan to go to Karn, stop Zarodnix and prevent the resurrection of Morbius ‚Äì even if it means breaking the rules of time! On Karn, Zarodnix tells Morbius that the Transduction Barriers have been shut down. Morbius calmly orders the Trell to open fire and says that when the Times Lords have been destroyed, there‚Äôll be plenty more work for them to do‚Ä¶ The Doctor and Lucie race into the TARDIS, but Lucie is worried that when the Eye of Harmony shuts down they‚Äôll be trapped in the ship without any power. The Doctor assures her they‚Äôll have a certain amount of reserve power and if they can latch on to one surviving nano-second of temporal energy they‚Äôll be able to complete their mission. As they dematerialise, Lucie insists they go back to before all this started and nobble Zarodnix. Just then, the console starts to spark and the Doctor realises the Stellar Manipulator is ripping the heart right out of his TARDIS. Then there's an explosion‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶and the TARDIS materialises. The Doctor and Lucie are relieved to be alive and it even looks like there's an ounce of power still left in the ship's cells. They don‚Äôt have enough energy left to check what's outside, so they have to trust the ship's homing instincts. When they emerge, they find themselves in a large cell that reminds Lucie of the London Dungeons. They notice a hooded prisoner in the shadows and when the Doctor removes the man's cowl, he's revealed to be Straxus. Across the planet, the computerised voice of an augmented Trell announces the return of their Lord Morbius in victory from battle. The people are ordered to rejoice‚Ä¶ In the cell, the Doctor and Lucie have also heard the announcement. Weakly, Straxus explains that this is what's happened for the last ten or more years, and Lucie realises to her horror that the TARDIS must have slipped forward in time rather than backwards. Morbius has been going about his conquering ways for over a decade and every opponent has fallen before his might. Straxus says the Palace they‚Äôre in was built on the remnants of a thousand worlds and he only ever leaves his cell for the ‚Äòfeeding‚Äô. The Doctor realises he's referring to unsuccessful gene-splicing and Straxus explains that Zarodnix never really understood the technology that he was using. Every time Morbius's life force weakens, they take more of Straxus's. If Morbius is returning from battle, then Straxus will be summoned shortly and he's not sure how much longer he can survive‚Ä¶ Zarodnix greets his Lord Emperor, but his welcome is dismissed by the weary Morbius who demands they bring up their prisoner from the dungeon. Zarodnix had predicted this and had prepared the gene-infuser the moment he heard Morbius was returning. Morbius admits that he's fatigued by battle, but says it was a good fight and his empire continues to grow‚Ä¶and the more it grows, the more fear itself becomes their greatest weapon. Whole star systems are now surrendering at the mere sight of his fleets, but there are still occasional challenges to enjoy. In the dungeons, Lucie assumes the Doctor's silence means he's coming up with a plan, but she tells him to be quick as someone's going to come through the door any minute now and drag poor Straxus off to have the life drained out of him. The Doctor asks if Morbius is still wearing the Stellar Manipulator remote control around his neck and Straxus says it's always there as a symbol of his power. The Doctor thinks it's more than just a symbol and says it's holding the Eye of Harmony at bay and denying it to the Time Lords. Lucie says if they can switch it off, Gallifrey will get its power back and they can travel back in time to put everything right. The Doctor sarcastically points out that it's not going to be that easy, but essentially she's right. Zarodnix tells Morbius he's heard a rumour that Earth put up a bit of a fight. Morbius says it's true and the humans were very tenacious‚Ä¶for a while at least. He says he's brought back the Statue of Liberty as a trophy to put on top of the Palace and he's already put a thousand slaves to work on it. He wonders whether the humans, if trained and conditioned correctly, would make good soldiers for the empire. Morbius becomes weary again and goes out onto the balcony to think about the many races he still has left to conquer. After a campaign he always likes to come out and look down over the canyon where he once fell to his death. He says he has a lot to thank Zarodnix for, but then Morbius is suddenly gripped by an intense pain and he orders Zarodnix to send for Straxus immediately. When the Doctor takes Lucie back to the TARDIS she's worried he's planning to take off and leave Straxus to his fate, but he tells her it's time to use their last remaining ounce of power. While he activates the ship's telepathic circuits to see if the Sisterhood are still around, he sends Lucie back to Straxus with some water. The weakened Time Lord is sceptical when he learns the Doctor is trying to contact the Sisterhood as he believes they‚Äôll have been one of Morbius's first targets for vengeance. Lucie wonders what happened to her friend Rosto and she's surprised when Straxus tells her he's still here. He says they injected him with whatever Zarodnix was using to control the Trell and ever since then, he's been the one who collects Straxus and takes him to Morbius. He thinks there may be something of the old Rosto still left in the new augmented creature as he speaks to him from time to time and he always says the same two words ‚Äì \\"Lucie Miller\\"‚Ä¶ The Doctor telepathically sends out a message to Orthena, warning that they only have one chance to get things right. He's prepared to sacrifice his life, but it's vital they get the Manipulator away from Morbius. When he switches the device off, the Sisterhood must teleport him away immediately or else they‚Äôll just kill him and re-set it. Although he's sure he can feel Orthena's mind, there's no response. Eventually the power in the TARDIS fades completely and he can do no more. Haspira complains to Orthena that the Time Lords have never done anything for them and that they should leave the Time Lords where they are, besieged and isolated. She believes the Sisterhood are safe and that they don‚Äôt owe anything to the rest of the Universe, so she suggests they let the Doctor fight his own battle without their help. The Doctor returns to the dungeon and reveals that he's used up the last of their power and he doesn‚Äôt know whether the Sisterhood got his message. He's surprised to see Lucie and Straxus being watched over by one of the augmented Trell guard, but Straxus explains that this is Rosto, the policeman who helped Lucie earlier. The Doctor knows that without the bionic alterations, the Trell are normally quite an affable species, and this is confirmed when Rosto turns to Lucie and calls her name. It seems Lucie must have made quite an impression on him after all‚Ä¶ Zarodnix assures the weakened Morbius that the infusion is ready. Straxus is on his way, but he's taking a long time and Morbius wonders what‚Äôll happen if the Time Lord is dead. Zarodnix is confident Straxus should survive for a number of years yet, but Morbius realises that eventually he's going to need another Time Lord ‚Äì and in all his campaigns, there's been no sign of them anywhere. Morbius looks down over the canyon again and wonders if this is where his ultimate destiny lies. Zarodnix says Morbius is overwrought and notes that he's always like this just before the ‚Äôfeeding‚Äô. The doors open and their prisoner is brought in. Morbius urges Zarodnix to bring him straight to the infuser, but when he orders Straxus to remove his cowl so he can see his rotting, stinking face, he discovers the prisoner is none other than the Doctor! Before anyone can react, the Doctor snatches the remote activator from around Morbius's neck. Morbius calls for Zarodnix to kill the Doctor, but then Lucie, Straxus and Rosto burst in. There's a brief battle with the guards in the throne room during which Rosto is hit and falls to the floor. Morbius struggles with the Doctor as they fight over the activator, so the Doctor concentrates and sends a telepathic signal to the Sisterhood, pleading for their help. Morbius taunts the Doctor and says he's not strong enough to fight him without the help of those witches. They soon find themselves out on the balcony. Lucie shouts out a warning, but the Doctor is too busy shutting down the Manipulator. He tells Morbius the power is now returning to the Time Lords and they‚Äôll soon be on their way here, crossing their timelines and shutting Morbius out of history completely. Morbius finally realises he has no future and is determined that at least he can force the Doctor to join him in his oblivion. With the last of his strength, Morbius grabs hold of the Doctor and the two of them fall over the edge of the balcony, disappearing from sight, deep into the canyon below‚Ä¶ Lucie screams for the Doctor. Straxus tells her they‚Äôve gone, but at least Morbius is back where he belongs. Lucie refuses to believe the Doctor could be dead and looks over the balcony, clinging to the hope that he might be holding onto something just below them ‚Äì but there's nothing there. Slowly the truth dawns on her and she realises the Doctor has gone. Suddenly the air is filled with a strange noise and Straxus says it must be the Time Lords correcting the flow of time. Then they miraculously find themselves on Karn many years earlier, before the Zarodnix Corporation came here. Bulek appears and explains that thanks to the Doctor they‚Äôve been able to put everything right. There never was a Morbius empire, but Bulek says the Doctor's death was part of the vital time event that made the repairing of history possible. His actions are at the centre of things, so there's nothing they can do to save him. Lucie threatens to kick some sense into Bulek, but he tells her she too has to be returned to her correct timeline. She begins to cry and says her correct place is down in the canyon with the Doctor. She says they might as well chuck her down there with him, but as she completely breaks down, Straxus knows she doesn‚Äôt mean it. He tells her the Time Lords can make her forget everything and says it might be for the best, but she pushes him away angrily and refuses the offer. She says the Doctor was her mate and he saved the Universe, and that's something she never wants to forget. Bulek says the Doctor always inspired such peculiar loyalty and they agree to respect Lucie's wishes. Lucie says she doesn‚Äôt respect any of the Time Lords because if they really cared they‚Äôd be willing to break a few of their fancy rules and bring him back to life. Bulek asks her if deep down she really thinks it's all over, but all Lucie can say is that she‚Äôll never forget the Doctor. She asks the Time Lords to take her home. Much later, Lucie is at home when there's a ring on the doorbell. Although it's the middle of the night, the caller is obviously impatient as the ringing and knocking becomes more intense. Eventually Lucie opens the door and is shocked to find herself facing her old foe, the Headhunter. The woman raises an alien gun and warns Lucie that she‚Äôll kill her if she makes a move. Lucie protests, but this is enough for the Headhunter and she opens fire. Lucie screams and the sound of her voice echoes in the air and then fades away‚Ä¶ Cast *The Doctor ‚Äî Paul McGann *Lucie Miller ‚Äî Sheridan Smith *Revenant ‚Äî Samuel West *Zarodnix ‚Äî Kenneth Colley *Rosto ‚Äî Alexander Siddig *Straxus ‚Äî Nickolas Grace *Bulek ‚Äî Barry McCarthy *Haspira ‚Äî Nicola Weeks *Orthena/Headhunter ‚Äî Katarina Olsson Continuity * This is Episode 7 of Series two in the Eighth Doctor's audio adventures with companion Lucie Miller, originally broadcast on BBC Radio in 2008. * Morbius and the Sisterhood of Karn previously appeared in the 1976 television serial The Brain of Morbius, during the Tom Baker era. * Straxus appeared in the conclusion to the first series of Eighth Doctor & Lucie audios, Human Resources, broadcast in 2007.

Cyril Cleverdon was born in Bristol, England. He worked at the Bristol Libraries from 1932 to 1938, and from 1938 to 1946 he was the librarian of the Engine Division of the Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd. In 1946 he was appointed librarian of the College of Aeronautics at Cranfield (later the Cranfield Institute of Technology and Cranfield University), where he served until his retirement in 1979, the last two years as professor of Information Transfer Studies. With the help of National Science Foundation funding, Cleverdon started a series of projects in 1957 that lasted for about 10 years in which he and his colleagues set the stage for information retrieval research. In the Cranfield project, retrieval experiments were conducted on test databases in a controlled, laboratory-like setting. The aim of the research was to improve the retrieval effectiveness of information retrieval systems, by developing better indexing languages and methods. The components of the experiments were: # a collection of documents, # a set of user requests or queries, and # a set of relevance judgments‚Äîthat is, a set of documents judged to be relevant to each query. Together, these components form an information retrieval test collection. The test collection serves as a standard for testing retrieval approaches, and the success of each approach is measured in terms of two measures: precision and recall. Test collections and evaluation measures based on precision and recall are driving forces behind modern research on search systems. Cleverdon's approach formed a blueprint for the successful Text Retrieval Conference series that began in 1992. Not only did Cleverdon's Cranfield studies introduce experimental research into computer science, the outcomes of the project also established the basis of the automatic indexing as done in today's search engines. Essentially, Cleverdon found that the use of single terms from the documents achieved the best retrieval performance, as opposed to manually assigned thesaurus terms, synonyms, etc. These results were very controversial at the time. In the Cranfield 2 Report, Cleverdon said: This conclusion is so controversial and so unexpected that it is bound to throw considerable doubt on the methods which have been used (...) A complete recheck has failed to reveal any discrepancies (...) there is no other course except to attempt to explain the results which seem to offend against every canon on which we were trained as librarians. Cyril Cleverdon also ran, for many years, the Cranfield conferences, which provided a major international forum for discussion of ideas and research in information retrieval. This function was taken over by the SIGIR conferences in the 1970s. References  Stephen Robertson, In Memoriam Cyril W.

Pablo the Drug Mule Dog is the main character in a series of anti-cocaine television advertisements produced by the agency Mother for FRANK, the United Kingdom government's national anti-drug campaign. The origins of the name Pablo are rumoured to be named after Pablo Escobar who was head of the Medellin cartel. The main advertisement of the campaign begins with Pablo in a cellar with a large gash the length of his chest, from which bags of cocaine are being removed. From this point, Pablo to sets out to discover, \\"what's the big deal about coke?\\". He encounters an armed dealer before talking with a few pushers and users in a disco. The shot then moves to the inside of a toilet, where a young man's nostril starts to bleed. The advert ends with Pablo using a payphone to talk to Frank. Pablo, voiced by David Mitchell, has a wry sense of humour and manages to satirise not only the cocaine trade but also the advert itself, through quotes like \\"I picked up the phone...somehow..and talked to Frank\\" and \\"Ever woken up with a huge gash in your stomach? I've had better mornings\\". Elements of recreational cocaine use are ridiculed in the campaign's six adverts, from bleeding nostrils being likened to an anus to sob-stories from pound notes used to snort the drug (\\"I hate being up his nostril!\\"). Indeed, the use of Pablo in the anti-drug campaign has been met with praise in the media and in the public eye, particularly for the large impact made without glamorising the drug trade.

Three other important acts were also enacted as part of the Hindu Code Bills during this time: the Hindu Succession Act (1956), the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act (1956), the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act (1956). Purpose The main purpose of the act was to amend and codify the law relating to marriage among Hindus and others. Besides amending and codifying Sastrik Law, it introduced separation and divorce, which did not exist in Sastrik Law. This enactment brought uniformity of law for all sections of Hindus. In India there are religion-specific civil codes that separately govern adherents of certain other religions. Applicability Section 2 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 says: 1. This Act applies - 1. to any person who is a Hindu by religion in any of its forms or developments, including a Virashaiva, a Lingayat or a follower of the Brahmo, Prarthana or Arya Samaj; 2. to any person who is a Buddhist, Jain or Sikh by religion; and 3. to any other person domiciled in the territories to which this Act extends who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion, unless it is proved that any such person would not have been governed by the Hindu law or by any custom or usage as part of that law in respect of any of the matters dealt with herein if this Act had not been passed. This section therefore applies to Hindus by religion in any of its forms and Hindus within the extended meaning i.e. Buddhist, Jains or Sikh and, in fact, applies to all such persons domiciled in the country who are not Muslims, Christians, Parsi or Jew, unless it is proved that such persons are not governed by the Act under any custom or usage. The Act applies to Hindus outside the territory of India only if such a Hindu is domiciled in the territory of India. The Act was viewed as conservative because it applied to any person who is Hindu by religion in any of its forms, yet groups other religions into the act (Jains, Buddhists, or Sikhs) as specified in Article 44 of the Indian Constitution.Department of Revenue, Rehabilitation and Disaster Management - \\"Hindu Marriage Act, 1955\\" d However, with the passage of Anand Marriage (Amendment) Bill in 2012, Sikhs now also have their own personal law related to marriage. A Marriage (Arya Samaj Marriage or an arranged Marriage) is directly registered by the Registrar of Marriage under section 8 of Hindu Marriage Act-1955 on the same working day. Verification of all the documents is carried out on the date of application and thereafter Marriage is registered on the same working day by the registrar of marriage appointed by the Govt. of India and marriage certificate is issued. Hindu view of marriage According to Hinduism, marriage is a sacred relationship. In some Hindu systems of marriage, there is no role for the state as marriage remained a private affair within the social realm.Menski, Werner. 2003. Hindu Law: Beyond Tradition and Modernity. Delhi: Oxford UP. Within this traditional framework reference, marriage is undoubtedly the most important transitional point in a Hindu‚Äôs life and the most important of all the Hindu ‚Äò‚Äôsanskaras‚Äô‚Äô (life-cycle rituals). The Congress Government diluted the Hindu Marriage in 1955 by enactment of HMA and then in 1983 by introduction of 498A. Special Marriage Act in 2000. Therefore there was fierce religious opposition to enacting such laws for marriage, succession and adoption. The greatest opposition was to the provision of divorce, something which is anathema to the Hindu religion. Also resisted was the principle of equal inheritance by sons and daughters regardless of whether the daughter was married or unwed. This was contrary to the Hindu view of family, where married daughters were regarded as belonging to the family of their husband, not to the family of their father. Some have argued that Hindu marriage cannot be subjected to legislative intervention. Derrett predicted in his later writings that despite some evidence of modernisation, the dominant view in Hindu society for the foreseeable future would remain that marriage is a form of social obligation. Conditions Section 5 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 states:- \\"Section 5. A marriage may be solemnised between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely- 1. neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage 2. at the time of the marriage, neither party- 1. is incapable of giving a valid consent to it in consequence of unsoundness of mind; or 2. though capable of giving a valid consent, has been suffering from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of children; 3. the bridegroom has completed the age of twenty-one years and the bride the age of eighteen years at the time of the marriage; 4. the parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two; 5. the parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two.\\" Guardianship Section 6 of the Hindu Marriage Act specifies the guardianship for marriage. Wherever the consent of a guardian in marriage is necessary for a bride under this Act, the persons entitled to give such consent are the following: the father; the mother; the paternal grandfather; the paternal grandmother; the brother by full blood; the brother by half blood; etc. The Guardianship For Marriage was repealed in 1978 after the Child Marriage Restraint Amendment was passed. This was an amendment that increased the minimum age requirement for marriage in order to prevent child marriages. Section Section 7 of the Hindu Marriage Act recognises the ceremonies and customs of marriage. Hindu marriage may be solemnised in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either party. Such rites and rituals include the Saptapadi‚Äîthe taking of seven steps by the bridegroom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire. The marriage becomes complete and binding when the seventh step is taken. Registration As stated in Section 8 of the Act, the state government may make rules for the registration of Hindu marriages that the parties to any of such marriages may have particulars relating to their marriages entered in such a manner and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed in the Hindu Marriage Register. This registration is for the purpose of facilitating the proof of Hindu marriages. All rules made in this section may be laid before the state legislature. The Hindu Marriage Register should be open for inspection at all reasonable times and should be admissible as evidence of the statements contained therein. Nullity of marriage and divorce Any marriage can be voidable and may be annulled on the following grounds: the marriage has not been consummated due to impotency, may be complete or partial impotency (for example conditions such as impotence quoad hoc), contravention of the valid consent mental illness condition specified in Section 5, or that the respondent at the time of the marriage was pregnant by someone other than the petitioner. Divorce can be sought by husband or wife on certain grounds, including: continuous period of desertion for two or more years, conversion to a religion other than Hindu, mental abnormality, venereal disease, and leprosy. A wife can also present a petition for the dissolution of marriage on the ground of if the husband marries again after the commencement of his first marriage or if the husband has been guilty of rape, sodomy, or bestiality. Newly married couples cannot file a petition for divorce within one year of marriage. Supreme Court ruling in 2012 The Supreme Court of India exercised its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India and ruled in August 2012 that marriages can be ended by mutual consent before expiry of the cooling period of six months stipulated in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act provides for the couple seeking divorce through mutual consent to wait for a period of six months after making first joint application for divorce. It is only after the expiry of the six months that the couple can move second application for the dissolution of their marriage. Pronouncing the judgment, Justice Altamas Kabir said: \\"It is no doubt true that the legislature had in its wisdom stipulated a cooling period of six months from the date of filing of a petition for mutual divorce till such divorce is actually granted, with the intention that it would save the institution of marriage. But there may be occasions when in order to do complete justice to the parties it becomes necessary for this court to invoke its powers under Article 142 in an irreconcilable situation (between the couple). When it has not been possible for the parties to live together and to discharge their marital obligations towards each other for more than one year, we see no reason to continue the agony of the parties for another two months.\\" Marriage Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2010 Based on recommendations of the Law Commission, a legislation was proposed. The Marriage Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2010 to amend the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and the Special Marriage Act, 1954 to making divorce easier on ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage was introduced in the parliament in 2012. The Bill replaces the words \\"not earlier than six months\\" in Section 13-B with the words \\"Upon receipt of a petition.\\" It also provides a better safeguard to wives by inserting section 13D by which the wife may oppose the grant of a decree on the ground that the dissolution of the marriage will result in grave financial hardship to her and that it would in all the circumstances be wrong to dissolve the marriage. New section 13E provides restriction on decree for divorce affecting children born out of wedlock and states that a court shall not pass a decree of divorce under section 13C unless the court is satisfied that adequate provision for the maintenance of children born out of the marriage has been made consistently with the financial capacity of the parties to the marriage. Marriage Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2010 makes similar amendments to the Special Marriage Act, 1954 by replacing the words \\"not earlier than six months\\" in Section 28 with the words \\"Upon receipt of a petition\\" and provides restriction on decree for divorce affecting children born out of wedlock. However, there was strong opposition to this bill due to the objection that it will create hardships for women and that the bill strongly supports one party while both parties should be treated equal in divorce.\\"Easier Divorce Bill Tabled in Rajya Sabha\\", \\"Deccan Chronicle\\", 1 May 2012. Therefore, the bill was amended to provide for the wife's consent for waiver of six-month notice with the words \\"Upon receipt of petitions by the husband and the wife.\\" The Bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha in 2013, though it was not passed in the Lok Sabha. There was widespread protest against the bill. Hridaya, a Kolkata-based NGO, demonstrated against the bill. Amartya Talukdar (a Men's Right Activist) raised concern that the bill introduces no-fault divorce for Hindus only. According to him, \\"If the Government really wants to bring about empowerment of women, let them make it open for all sections of the society. Let them bring a uniform civil code. Why is it only for the Hindus?\\" See also * The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 * Sanskara (rite of passage) * Dowry law in India * The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986 * Christian Personal Law * Gullipilli Sowria Raj v.

(2016). Key Success Factors for Smart and Connected Health Software Solutions. Computer, 49(11), 22-28. by using technology to provide healthcare services remotely. Connected health, also known as technology enabled care (TEC) aims to maximize healthcare resources and provide increased, flexible opportunities for consumers to engage with clinicians and better self-manage their care.N. Carroll, C. Kennedy, & I. Richardson (2016). Connected Community Healthcare Ecosystem (CCHE) for managing long-term conditions. Gerontechnology, 14(2):64-77 doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.4017/gt.2016.14.2.003.00 It uses readily available consumer technologies to deliver patient care outside of the hospital or doctor's office. Connected health encompasses programs in telehealth, remote care (such as home care) and disease and lifestyle management, often leverages existing technologies such as connected devices using cellular networks and is associated with efforts to improve chronic care. However, there is an increasing blur between software capabilities and healthcare needs whereby technologists are now providing the solutions to support consumer wellness and provide the connectivity between patient data, information and decisions. This calls for new techniques to guide Connected Health solutions such as \\"design thinking\\" to support software developers in clearly identifying healthcare requirements, and extend and enrich traditional software requirements gathering techniques.Carroll, N., & Richardson, I. (2016). Aligning healthcare innovation and software requirements through design thinking. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Software Engineering in Healthcare Systems (pp. 1-7). ACM. The United States and European Union are two dominant markets for the use of connected health in home care service, in part due to the high availability of telephone and Internet service as compared to other parts of the world. Proponents of connected health believe that technology can transform healthcare delivery and address inefficiencies especially in the area of work flow management, chronic disease management and patient compliance of the US and global healthcare systems. History Connected health has its roots in telemedicine, and its more recent relative, telehealth. The first telemedicine programs were primarily undertaken to address healthcare access and/or provider shortages. Connected health is distinguished from telemedicine by: * A broader concern for healthcare cost, quality and efficiency, particularly as related to the chronically ill * Concomitant interests in making healthcare more patient centric by promoting healthcare consumerism through education, and patient feedback * Efforts in the direction of integrating data generated outside of traditional healthcare settings such as the home with centralised, often electronic patient record Connected health is the \\"umbrella term arrived to lessen the confusion over the definitions of telemedicine, telehealth and mhealth\\". It is considered as the new lexicon for the term telemedicine. The technology view of connected health focuses more on the connection methods between clients and the health care professional. An alternative view is that of a socio-technical perspective in which connected health is considered as a combination of people, processes and technology. In 2015 Connected health was defined as patient-centred care resulting from process-driven health care delivery undertaken by health care professionals, patients and/or carer who are supported by the use of technology (software and/or hardware). In operation Two \\"core platforms\\" are emphasized in connected health, self-care and remote care, with programs primarily focused on monitoring and feedback for the chronically ill, elderly, and those patients located at an untenable distance from primary or specialty providers. Programs designed to improve patient-provider communication within an individual medical practice for example, the use of email to communicate with patients between office visits also fall within the purview of connected health. There are also lifestyle coaching programs, in which an individual receives healthcare information to facilitate behavior change to improve their fitness and/or general well being, (see wellness) or to reduce or eliminate the impact of a particular behavior that presents a risk to their health status. Some of the most common types of connected health programs in operation today include: * Home care via remote monitoring of chronically ill patients including surveillance connected devices or patient controlled monitoring of health parameters * Traditional telehealth programs, where care is provided in remote areas by teams of local clinicians or community healthcare workers teamed up with specialists in medical centers * Monitoring programs whose aim is to ensure the safety and quality of life of elderly parents living at a distance from their relatives * Web-based second opinion services for patients in need of medical care * Lifestyle and fitness coaching for wellness or health risk reduction The Center for Connected Health is implementing a range of programs in high-risk, chronic and remotely located populations. Inherent in the concept of connected health is flexibility in terms of technological approaches to care delivery and specific program objectives. For instance, remote monitoring programs might use a combination of cell phone and smart phone technology, online communications or biosensors and may aim to increase patient-provider communication, involve patients in their care through regular feedback, or improve upon a health outcome measure in a defined patient population or individual. Digital pen technology, global positioning, videoconferencing and environmental sensors are all playing a role in connected health. Goals Proponents of Connected health view it as a critical component of change in human healthcare and envision: * Reductions in the cost of providing quality care to the chronically ill, estimated by the Center for Health Care Economics at the Milken Institute to be over $1 trillion per year * Improved global and local public health surveillance, with a resultant reduction in epidemics, increased control over infectious disease and improved drug safety * Diminished rate of medical errors * Better \\"customer service\\" in healthcare * Ongoing preventive health, with attendant reductions in: morbidity, mortality and the cost of care * Consumer engagement in health and self-management * Safer and more effective clinical trials Evolution Rising costs, increases in chronic diseases, geographic dispersion of families, growing provider shortages, ethnic disparities in care, better survival rates among patients fighting serious diseases, an aging U.S. population and longer lifespan are all factors pointing to a need for better ways of delivering healthcare.\\"The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It\\", The New York Review of Books website, (Accessed December 10, 2008)Americans for Healthcare website (Accessed December 10, 2008)\\"Health Care Costs: Why Do They Increase? What Can We Do?\\" , Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality website, (Accessed December 10, 2008) Direct-to-consumer advertising is a demonstrated contributor to the rise in consumer demand, as is the mass availability of inexpensive technology and ubiquity of the Internet, cell phones and PDAs.PriceWaterhouseCoopers. 2006. The Factors Fueling Rising Healthcare Costs 2006, Prepared for America's Health Insurance Plans, 2006\\"How Changes in Medical Technology Affect Health Care Costs\\" Kaiser Family Foundation website, March 2007 (Accessed December 10, 2008) Connected health experts such as Joseph C. Kvedar, believe that consumer engagement in healthcare is on its way to becoming a major force for change. In summary, connected health has arisen from: 1) a desire on the part of individual physicians and healthcare organizations to provide better access, quality and efficiency of care 2) dynamics of the healthcare economy (such as rising costs and changing demographics) 3) consumerism in health care and a drive towards patient centric healthcare. Together, these factors are providing impetus for connected healthcare in the United States and many other industrialised nations and forcing innovation both from within and outside the system. Evidence While connected health is yet emerging, there is evidence of its benefit. For example, in a program being implemented by the Center for Connected Health and Partners Home Care, over 500 heart failure patients have now been monitored remotely through the collection of vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure and weight, using simple devices in the patient's home. The information is sent daily to a home health nurse, who can identify early warning signs, notify the patient's primary care physician, and intervene to avert potential health crises. A pilot of this program demonstrated reduced hospitalizations.bmj 2007; 334: 942 (5 may) Another initiative at the Center for Connected Health uses cellular telephone technology and a \\"smart\\" pill bottle to detect when a patient has not taken their scheduled medication. A signal is then sent that lights up an ambient orb device in the patient's home to remind them to take their medication. Funding and implementation It appears that connected health programs are operated and funded primarily by home care agencies and large healthcare systems. However, insurers and employers are increasingly interested in connected health for its potential to reduce direct and indirect healthcare costs. In 2007, EMC Corporation launched the first employer-sponsored connected health program, in the beta phase of implementation, aimed at improving outcomes and cost of care for patients with high blood pressure.Kowalczyk, L. Employees to get an online checkup: Care provider, EMC will test a program to cut health costs, The Boston Globe, March 3, 2007 US government agencies Government agencies involved in connected health include: * The Office for the Advancement of Telehealth * The National Center for Telehealth & Technology (T2) * The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to the extent that Medicaid reimburses for telemedicine programs, at the state's option. According to the CMS Web site, at least 18 states are allowing reimbursement for services provided via telemedicine for reasons that include improved access to specialists for rural communities and reduced transportation costs. * The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) is charged with creating an interoperable health information technology infrastructure for the nation, primarily defined as an electronic health records system. Former National Coordinator David Brailer indicated his support for portable personal health records which are controlled by consumers. As of 2006 it remained to be seen how his successor, Robert Kolodner, will interpret this charge.Brailer, David J. Your Medical History, To Go. The New York Times. September 19, 2006. Personal health records Personal health records, or PHRS, (see personal health record) ‚Äì are essentially medical records controlled and maintained by the healthcare consumer. PHRs intersect with connected health in that they attempt to increase the involvement of healthcare consumers in their care. By contrast, electronic medical records (EMRs) (see electronic medical record) are digital medical records or medical records systems maintained by hospitals or medical practices and are not part of connected health delivery.

It is a type of dermatophyte that colonizes keratinized tissues (primarily hair) causing infection. The fungus is characterized by its spindle-shaped macroconidia (7‚Äì30 √ó 35‚Äì160 Œºm), clavate microconidia (2.5‚Äì3.5 √ó 4‚Äì7 Œºm) as well as its pitted or spiny external walls. Growth conditions This fungus is often found in soil that is rich in keratinous material. However, there are other factors that can influence its growth, such as pH, relative humidity, organic carbon, nitrogen and temperature. Microsporum audouinii appears to prefer a neutral pH in the range of 6.8-7.0 and room temperature for growth. Drastic increases or decreases in temperature can inhibit its growth. Microsporum audouinii is effective in utilizing its carbon sources, but growth is strongest in the hexoses (glucose, mannose and fructose) and weakest in maltose, sucrose, lactose and galactose. It is unable to synthesize the vitamins thiamine, niacin and riboflavin and requires an exogenous supply of these materials to support its growth. The fungus is only able to utilize organic nitrogen sources, particularly nitrogen from arginine and urea. Epidemiology Microsporum audouinii causes the infections Tinea capitis (scalp ringworm) and Tinea corporis. These superficial dermal diseases are generally found in prepubescent children (starting at 6 months) and rarely affect adults. There are a few reasons why children are more susceptible to M. audouinii. Differences in the chemical composition and quantity of the triglycerides in hair sebum secreted are the primary reasons. In instances whereby the triglyceride content in the sebum decreases so does the susceptibility of a person to the fungus. Cases like those are seen in postmenopausal women of whom suffer hormonal changes which can contribute to triglyceride reduction. In addition, increased sweat production as well as the presence of Pityrosporum ovale decreases the ability for M. audouinii to thrive. Pityrosporum ovale is an opportunistic lipophilic yeast that is a part of the human cutaneous flora in adults. In most cases of adult onset Tinea capitis due to M. audouinii, there is at least one predisposing factor such as immunocompromise (e.g., diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus, organ transplant and HIV), a local animal reservoir (e.g., infected pet or farm animal) and hormonal changes in postmenopausal women. Tinea capitis is seen in tropical, rural and suburban regions. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, M. audouinii was the primary fungus responsible for Tinea capitis throughout the US and Western Europe. With the advent of antimycotic agents, its prevalence has decreased. But in the poorer parts of Africa, especially Central and West Africa, M. audouinii remains the primary dermatophyte responsible for this disease. Pathology Tinea capitis develops when an inoculum from another individual or animal comes into a 'compromised scalp', which can occur when the stratum corneum of the scalp is exposed. This can be due to trauma of the scalp, tight hair braiding or hair styling with infected tools. In general, fungal spread is facilitated by poverty, poor hygiene and overcrowding. Once the fungus has entered the stratum corneum it continues to invade the epidermis; it then enters a hair follicle, penetrates the hair shaft and grows down the length of the hair. The hyphae grow distally until they reach the upper limits of the zone of keratinization where the nucleated hair shaft cornifies completely and is converted into hard, anucleated keratin. The terminal end of the growing hyphae forms a ring (Adamson's Fringe). As the hair continues to grow outwards, hyphae are brought to the surface (scalp) and arthroconidia are produced. Eventually due to mechanical forces (the movement of the fungi) and keratinase (a chymotrypsin-like enzyme with optimal activity at an acidic pH), all but 1‚Äì2 mm of the diseased hair follicle weakens and falls off. The remaining hair has a characteristic dark grey appearance due to the Adamson's Fringe. Diagnostic tests There is an array of different tests to differentiate between fungi. Direct microscopy with 10% KOH would show small to medium conidia with ectothrix hair invasion. Performing a wet mount would show 'racquet shaped hyphae' with few macro and microconidia. Histological examination of a diseased hair shows clefts that between the inner root sheath and hair. Microsporum audouinii fluoresces when examined in ultraviolet light (Wood's lamp). The two main growth media employed to test for M. audouinii are Sabouraud's Dextrose agar and potato dextrose agar. On the former, growth is slow with and poor sporulation with most strains producing a few abortive macroconidia and sparse microconidia. The colonies are flat, dense and cottony in texture with a greyish-white to reddish brown hue. On Potato Dextrose agar, colonies are white with a silky texture and a peach-coloured underside. Microsporum audouinii can be differentiated from non-sporulating strains of the similar M. canis by culture on autoclaved rice. Under these conditions, M. canis typically yields abundant growth and little to no pigmentation whereas M. audouinii produces no visible growth and abundant brown pigment on the rice grains. PCR fingerprinting is a fairly new diagnostic tool for the rapid identification of these fungi. Treatment A symptomatic patient will present an unusual amount of itching and alopecia. Primary treatment involves griseofulvin, an antimycotic agent. For patients who don't respond to griseofulvin, other drugs, itraconazole, fluconazole, and terbinafine can be used as a replacement to or in conjunction with griseofulvin. These drugs are preferred over griseofulvin as they have a shorter duration for treatment. However, these agents have drug-drug interactions and over a prolonged period of time can cause liver damage. Currently, squalamine, an aminosterol with fungicidal properties is being researched as its mechanism of action is different from that of the aforementioned medicines, making it a good drug for those who don't respond well to itraconazole, fluconazole, or terbinafine. Systemic treatment with oral medication and anti-fungal shampoos has also been effective. Antifungal shampoos (ketoconazole 2% shampoo or selenium sulfide 2.5% ) are effective as they reduce the transmission of the diseased hair by preventing its shedding. Other treatments include, epilation of the infected follicles, topical ointments and steroidal treatments. Topical ointments immobilize the fungus and reduce shedding but they do not penetrate the hair follicle and hence must be used in conjunction with other treatment methods. Steroidal treatments aid in inflammation and pain reduction. Griseofulvin inhibits fungal cell mitosis via disruption of the mitotic spindle structure and preventing cell division at the metaphase stage. In addition, it inhibits nucleic acid synthesis. Both itraconazole and fluconazole inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol which is an important component of fungal cell membranes. Consequently, fluconazole use leads to changes in the permeability and function of the cell membrane. Squalene epoxidase contributes to the formation of ergosterol. Terbinafine inhibits squalene epoxidase thereby preventing cell membrane formation.

Pseudochromis fuscus is a species of saltwater fish in the dottyback family. Dottybacks are generally very bright in color and relatively small, factors which have made them popular among aquarium enthusiasts. Besides their coloration and size, they are probably best known for their aggressive temperament.V. Messmer, G. P. Jones, L. van Herwerden, P. L. Munday, Genetic and ecological characterisation of colour dimorphism in a coral reef fish. Environmental Biology of Fishes 74, 175-183 (2005); published online EpubOct (10.1007/s10641-005-7430-8). While many of the more common dottybacks are in the Pseudochromis genus, there are also species in other genera.H. C. Schultz, in Reefkeeping. (2008). Common names for this particular species include the brown dottyback, the golden dottyback, and the musky dottyback.J. E. Randall, G. R. Allen, R. C. Steene, in fishbase.org. (University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, Hawaii, 1990). The common name ‚ÄúGolden dottyback‚Äù is shared with another species of dottyback, the Pseudochromis pseudoplesiopinae.M. Goren, M. Dor, in Fishbase.org. (The Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, Jerusalem, Israel, 1994). The species name, fuscus, means dark or dusky in Latin.J. E. Randall, G. R. Allen, R. C. Steene, in fishbase.org. (University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, Hawaii, 1990).  Description  Brown dottybacks grow to a maximum length of about 10 centimeters and they have three dorsal spines, several dorsal soft rays, three anal spines and a few anal soft rays. The spine count is what distinguishes them from their close neighbor, the true basses from the family Serranidae.B. Fenner, in Wet Web Media. Like most dottybacks, they are very long and slender.J. E. Randall, G. R. Allen, R. C. Steene, in fishbase.org. (University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, Hawaii, 1990).A. Ryanskiy, in diveplanet. (2013). They are also the largest species within the genus Pseudochromis. Brown dottybacks have pear-shaped eyes, not unlike bass, and canine teeth.B. Fenner, in Wet Web Media. Color usually ranges from bright yellow to dark brown, but orange, pink, and gray fish of this species have been found as well.A. Ryanskiy, in diveplanet. (2013).V. Messmer, L. van Herwerden, P. L.

Valdestamon, in Discover Life (2012). Studies have shown that the color differences in wild brown dottybacks are not due to genetic changes. In fact, individuals seem to be able to change their color, though the factors causing color changes are undetermined. The shade of yellow or brown that a dottyback displays seems to correlate with the shade of prey that a dottyback targets. For example, brown dottybacks with a bright yellow coloration are more likely to be found near prey with a bright yellow coloration.V. Messmer, G. P. Jones, L. van Herwerden, P. L. Munday, Genetic and ecological characterisation of colour dimorphism in a coral reef fish. Environmental Biology of Fishes 74, 175-183 (2005); published online EpubOct (10.1007/s10641-005-7430-8).P.

As is shown on the map, the southern limit of the distribution stops at about the southern limit of the reefs off the eastern coast of Australia. This is because the brown dottyback is most often found in coral reef habitats.W. E. Feeney, O. M. Loennstedt, Y. Bosiger, J. Martin, G. P. Jones, R. J. Rowe, M. I.

The brown dottyback is often found in crevices or ledges. It is also often found swimming near branching corals.J. E. Randall, G. R. Allen, R. C. Steene, in fishbase.org. (University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, Hawaii, 1990).  Diet  Pseudochromis fuscus is a carnivorous fish that often feeds on juvenile coral reef fish or crustaceans, though they also will feed on mollusks. Typically, juvenile fish are only targeted for predation during the summer, as the survivors outgrow their vulnerability to dottyback predation by the winter.W. E. Feeney, O. M. Loennstedt, Y.

Unlike other species of competing piscivors, predation of juvenile fish by the brown dottyback is not affected by the presence of adult males guarding the juveniles. Sometimes, adult male damselfish will guard the nests of their young. While this reduces predation on the young by other predators, predation by dottyback appears to be unaffected.M. I. McCormick, M. G. Meekan, Social facilitation of selective mortality. Ecology 88, 1562-1570 (2007); published online EpubJun (10.1890/06-0830). Because of this predatory behavior, the brown dottyback is considered an important regulator of the composition of the coral reef community.O. M. Loennstedt, M. I. McCormick, D. P. Chivers, Predator-induced changes in the growth of eyes and false eyespots. Scientific Reports 3, (2013); published online EpubJul 25 (10.1038/srep02259).  Behavior  The brown dottyback is a very aggressive predatory fish, and therefore, most of the behavioral research conducted on it relates to the predatory relationship that this fish has with others in the coral reef community. Brown dottybacks appear to preferentially prey on fish with longer bodies, an observation which is consistent with the optimal foraging theory.T. H. Holmes, M. I. McCormick, Influence of prey body characteristics and performance on predator selection. Oecologia 159, 401-413 (2009); published online EpubMar (10.1007/s00442-008-1220-x). While long body types were preferred in prey, various studies have conflicting results when examining the effects of overall prey size on targeting. Some studies have found that brown dottybacks prefer larger prey,T. H. Holmes, M. I. McCormick, Size-selectivity of predatory reef fish on juvenile prey. Marine Ecology Progress Series 399, 273-283 (2010); published online Epub2010 (10.3354/meps08337). while others have found that smaller prey are preferred.O. M. Lonnstedt, M. I. McCormick, D. P. Chivers, Well-informed foraging: damage-released chemical cues of injured prey signal quality and size to predators. Oecologia 168, 651-658 (2012); published online EpubMar (10.1007/s00442-011-2116-8). Brown dottybacks also appear to target rare fish for predation more often than common fish.G. R. Almany, L. F. Peacock, C. Syms, M. I. McCormick, G. P. Jones, Predators target rare prey in coral reef fish assemblages. Oecologia 152, 751-761 (2007); published online EpubJul (10.1007/s00442-007-0693-3).G. R.

Preference is also given to targeting prey in good condition over prey in bad condition, a distinction that is often made through chemical cues. In fact, it appears as though chemical signals are the primary means by which a foraging response is stimulated.O. M. Lonnstedt, M. I. McCormick, D. P. Chivers, Well-informed foraging: damage-released chemical cues of injured prey signal quality and size to predators. Oecologia 168, 651-658 (2012); published online EpubMar (10.1007/s00442-011-2116-8). Predatory behavior also increases for brown dottybacks in a bleached coral reef environment, as the lack of coloration of the coral makes it easier for the predators to detect their prey.D. J. Coker, M. S. Pratchett, P. L. Munday, Coral bleaching and habitat degradation increase susceptibility to predation for coral-dwelling fishes. Behavioral Ecology 20, 1204-1210 (2009); published online EpubNov-Dec (10.1093/beheco/arp113). Studies have also found that external chemical factors affect brown dottyback behavior. For example, carbon dioxide increases the swimming activity of this fish, while at the same time decreasing the ability of the brown dottyback to sense the chemical signals associated with the presence of prey.M. Briffa, K. de la Haye, P. L. Munday, High CO2 and marine animal behaviour: Potential mechanisms and ecological consequences. Marine Pollution Bulletin 64, 1519-1528 (2012); published online EpubAug (10.1016/j.marpolbul.2012.05.032). However, increasing the carbon dioxide concentration does not necessarily help prey escape, as these changes also decrease the ability the dottyback's prey to sense the chemical signals of a nearby predator.M.

Aquaria  Pseudochromis fuscus, along with many other species in the dottyback family, are often kept as aquarium fish. These fish are as aggressive in captivity as they are in the wild, so brown dottybacks are often kept with fish that will not disturb their territory or they are kept completely separate from other fish. For this reason, it is very important to have only one brown dottyback in a tank. Because this fish is so large relative to other dottybacks, the brown dottyback is even more of a bully than the other aggressive species within the genus Pseudochromis. Still, they are a relatively easy fish to keep in captivity, and they can be kept with larger fish like adult damselfish or parrotfish. It is best to feed brown dottybacks with finely chopped meaty foods, like krill or squid, but this fish will also adapt to eating flakes, pellets, and herbivorous foods. Special attention must be given to the choice of foods, because the brown dottyback's diet will affect its coloration. This is why a diet high in vitamins is recommended, as this diet should maintain a rich golden color. Another important consideration for a tank containing a brown dottyback is the need for rocky ledges, crevices, and caves.A. Ryanskiy, in diveplanet. (2013).

The team was member of what was referred to as the National Football League. This league has no connection with the National Football League of today. The whole \\"league\\" was a curious mixture of baseball and football. During the league's only year in existence, two of the three teams that were financed by the owners of the Philadelphia Athletics and the Philadelphia Phillies, hence the names Philadelphia Athletics and Philadelphia Phillies. The Pittsburgh Stars made up the third team and was suspected of being financed by the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team. History =Origins= The Athletics began as a part of the baseball wars between the National League and the new American League that began in 1901. In Philadelphia, the AL's Athletics lured several of the NL's Phillies from their contracts, only to lose them again through court action. When Phillie owner John Rogers decided to start a football team, the Athletics followed suit. A's owner Ben Shibe fielded a team made-up of several baseball players as well as some local football talent. He appointed his baseball manager Connie Mack as the team's general manager and named former Penn player, Charles \\"Blondy\\" Wallace as the team's coach. Each Philadelphia team was named after their respective baseball clubs and became the Philadelphia Athletics and Philadelphia Phillies. The 1902 Philadelphia Athletics of the National Football League However both Rogers and Shibe knew that to lay claim to the World Championship, they had to play a team from Pittsburgh, which was the focal point of football at the time. They called upon Dave Berry, pro football promoter, and a Pittsburgh team was soon formed. These three teams are all that made up the first NFL. Upon hiring Wallace as coach of team, Shibe primarily put Mack in the manager position to watch over Wallace. Mack wasn't an expert on football, but he had always been careful with Shibe's money and his sports teams. Nevertheless, Wallace began signing the best football talent available. The Phillies had a headstart, but A's soon caught up until Philadelphia rosters began to look like a \\"Who's Who of Phialdelphia Football talent\\". =Rube Waddell= Many of the baseball players came from the Major League Baseball teams. The Athletics' star left-hander, Rube Waddell. When in the mood, he could throw a baseball better than anyone in the world, but he wasn't always in the mood. Newspapers of the time charitably referred to Waddell as \\"eccentric\\" while others ranked him between \\"screwball\\" and \\"nutsy.\\" When football began, Connie saw a chance to keep his star in line for a few months more. He signed the lefty on as an extra lineman, against Waddell's recommendation that he be placed at halfback. While there is no mention of Waddell's name in any lineups or game accounts, Wallace may have let the lefty into a few games when the score was safe. Regardless, it was no secret to anyone that the Rube was there to be watched. =1902 Season= First Stars game The league played all of its games on Saturdays, since there were no Sunday sports events according to Pennsylvania blue laws in 1902. The teams began playing various colleges and local football clubs before finally playing each other. On November 8, the Stars traveled to Philadelphia to play the A's. In the first half Pittsburgh scored two touchdowns but failed on each extra point attempts (PAT). In 1902, the PAT was more difficult than those of today. It had to be kicked from a point straight out from where the ball crossed the goal line on the TD. If the angle was bad, the scoring team's fullback punted the ball out into the field from behind the goal line. The extra point man had first to field the punt-out, and then, kick from where he'd caught the ball. If the fullback couldn't give the kicker good field position, he didn't stand a chance on his try. The Athletics also got a touchdown and added the point. Until 1912 a touchdown counted only five points, so the score at the half stood 10-6. However, the A's were not content to be the first team to score against the Stars; they added a second-half field goal‚Äîalso five points, the same as a touchdown. Under modern scoring, the game would have been a 12-10 Pittsburgh victory. In 1902 scoring it was 11-10, Philadelphia. Issues with Waddell However was still more committed to baseball than football and worried more about losing Rube Waddell than any football game. In Elmira, Waddell was tempted to remain in a town that was the home of one of the biggest manufacturers of fire engines, which he loved. Mack had to then convince Rube to stay with the team. Then the night before the first championship game try with Pittsburgh, Connie caught Rube sneaking into the hotel long after curfew. After being delivered a lecture by Mack, Waddell turned to return to his hotel room. However, a loaded pistol dropped out of his pocket and went off. The bullet missed Mack's head by inches. =First championship try= The Athletics had split on the 1902 season with the Phillies, as had Pittsburgh. Although a Philadelphia victory on Thanksgiving Day would give the A's the championship hands down, a win by the Stars could tie the league race tighter than a toper on Saturday night. The game going to be billed by Dave Berry, the league president and manager of the Stars, as the championship game. Mack prepared the A's for the big game by playing an exhibition tour through northern Pennsylvania and southern New York. In Elmira, New York the Athletics joined in the first night game in pro football history. Lights were set up along the sidelines and giant searchlights glared from behind the goal posts. When Mack agreed to the championship game, he was promised $2,000 in return for his team's participation. When he saw that the stands were practically empty, he refused to play until his team was paid their share of the gate. With the stands almost empty, it looked as if the game wouldn't be played. However, Mack soon after received a check for $2,000 from William Corey, the head of Carnegie Steel who impatiently wanted to see the game, and the game soon began. Corey got his money's worth, if he liked evenly matched games. Both teams played at their best and sweated to a scoreless tie. It was a fair verdict, but Dave Berry's \\"championship game\\" hadn't decided anything. =1902 Championship= Another championship game was soon planned between Berry and Mack. The crowd was a little better that day, but not by much. Only about 2,000 fans showed up. With less than three minutes left in a scoreless game, neither team had yet been able to score a point. Everyone was about ready to contend with another tie. However, a late fumble led to a Pittsburgh touchdown and another touchdown soon followed. The Stars won the championship. Meanwhile, the Athletics went home and beat the Phillies to wrap up second place. It was a nice win and gave them the city championship. =Controversy= With the win, A's players decided to call the Stars game an exhibition, and declared themselves the champs. However, the team had agreed to that season-ending championship game against Pittsburgh the Saturday after Thanksgiving, and they had lost it. This was recognized by all parties at the time as the championship game. Each team carried a record of 2-2 for league play. Pittsburgh had by far the better point ratio, scoring 39 points to their opponents' 22. Both the Athletics and the Phillies gave up more points than they scored in their league games. Finally Dave Berry used his power as league president and name his Stars the 1905 champions. In late December of that same year the 1902 World Series of Football was held at Madison Square Garden in New York City. While neither the Phillies nor Athletics participated in this event, several members of both squads joined together on a team known variously as \\"New York\\", the New Yorks and the New York Philadelphians. The \\"New York\\" team played in the first indoor football game against the Syracuse Athletic Club. The Philadelphia Athletics Football Club finished the 1902 season some $4000 in debt. Mack reorganized the team for the 1903 season but the squad played only two games, a 0-12 defeat at the hands of the Watertown Red & Black and a 6-0 victory over the All-Syracuse eleven, before folding.

Built in the weeks following the Union defeat at Bull Run, Fort Ellsworth was situated on a hill north of Hunting Creek, and Cameron Run, (which feeds into it). From its position on one of the highest points west of Alexandria, the fort overlooked the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, the Little River Turnpike, and the southern approaches to the city of Alexandria, the largest settlement in Union-occupied Northern Virginia.  Occupation of Alexandria  The occupation of Northern Virginia was peaceful, with the sole exception of the town of Alexandria. There, as Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth, commander of the New York Fire Zouaves (11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment), entered a local hotel to remove the Confederate flag flying above it, he was shot and killed by James Jackson, the proprietor. Ellsworth was one of the first men killed in the American Civil War.Ames W. Williams, \\"The Occupation of Alexandria,\\" Virginia Cavalcade, Volume 11, (Winter 1961‚Äì62), pp. 33‚Äì34. Throughout the remainder of the war, Alexandria would lean strongly towards the Confederate government, necessitating continued occupation by a Union garrison. = Washington D.C. fortifications = Washington D.C. Fortifications map Over the seven weeks that followed the occupation of northern Virginia, forts were constructed along the banks of the Potomac River and at the approaches to each of the three major bridges (Chain Bridge, Long Bridge, and Aqueduct Bridge) connecting Virginia to Washington and Georgetown.J.G. Barnard and W.F. Barry, \\"Report of the Engineer and Artillery Operations of the Army of the Potomac from Its Organization to the Close of the Peninsular Campaign,\\" (New York: D. Van Nostrand, 1863), pp. 9‚Äì10. While the Potomac River forts were being built, planning and surveying was ordered for an enormous new ring of forts to protect the city. Unlike the fortifications under construction, the new forts would defend the city in all directions, not just the most direct route through Arlington. In mid-July, this work was interrupted by the First Battle of Bull Run. As the Army of Northeastern Virginia marched south to Manassas, the soldiers previously assigned to construction duties marched instead to battle. In the days that followed the Union defeat at Bull Run, panicked efforts were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack.Margaret Leech, Reveille in Washington (New York: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1941), pp. 101‚Äì110. The makeshift trenches and earthworks that resulted were largely confined to Arlington and the direct approaches to Washington. On July 26, 1861, five days after the battle, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was named commander of the military district of Washington and the subsequently renamed Army of the Potomac. Upon arriving in Washington, McClellan was appalled by the condition of the city's defenses. > In no quarter were the dispositions for defense such as to offer a vigorous > resistance to a respectable body of the enemy, either in the position and > numbers of the troops or the number and character of the defensive works... > not a single defensive work had been commenced on the Maryland side.

To remedy the situation, one of McClellan's first orders upon taking command was to greatly expand the defenses of Washington. At all points of the compass, forts and entrenchments would be constructed in sufficient strength to defeat any attack.Official Records, Series I, Volume 5, Chapter 14, p. 679.

John Newton, who was in charge of the forts south of Four Mile Run, supervised the construction and managed the flow of men and material.Official Records, Series I, Volume 5, Chapter 14, p. 684. The Fort was constructed on Shuter's Hill to the east of Samuel Cooper's Cameron plantation house. Construction began on May 25, 1861.

It was first recognized by David Gruby in 1844. Isolates are characterized as the \\"‚Äì\\" or negative mating type of the Arthroderma vanbreuseghemii complex. This species is thought to be conspecific with T. equinum, although the latter represents the \\"+\\" mating strain of the same biological species Despite their biological conspecificity, clones of the two mating types appear to have undergone evolutionary divergence with isolates of the T. tonsurans-type consistently associated with Tinea capitis (particularly in children) whereas the T. equinum-type, as its name implies, is associated with horses as a regular host. Phylogenetic relationships were established in isolates from Northern Brazil, through fingerprinting polymorphic RAPD and M13 markers. There seems to be lower genomic variability in the T. tonsurans species due to allopatric divergence. Any phenotypic density is likely due to environmental factors, not genetic characteristics of the fungus. Colony morphology Colony of Trichophyton tonsurans from scalp scraping cultured on Sabouraud's dextrose agar with cycloheximide, chloramphenicol and gentamicin (7 d)Trichophyton tonsurans may be identified through analysis of its fast-growing colonies. Colonies tend to be flat, powdery, and yellow with a reddish undercolour. It develops into a folded colony, and may vary in colour from off-white to grey, with dark pigments that may diffuse into the medium. The younger colonies fluoresce green on Sabouraud's agar, and are also flat, but are mahogany red or lemon-yellow coloured. On this agar the fungus grows peripherally and develops into a flatter, creamy disk with raised edges. Trichophyton tonsurans also produces many inflated, pear-shaped microconidia, borne on matchstick-like stalks. It also forms fewer macroconidia that are 4-6 cells long, with thick cell walls. A different simple method for identification at early stages is through the detection of chlamydospore-like structures (CLS), which are found on the reverse side of the culture under light microscopy. Chlamydospores are asexual spores that are created through hyphal modification, often with thick cell walls arising from the deposition of hydrophobic materials along the original cell wall. After inoculation on culture media (such as commonly used Mycosel agar), mycelia extend into the media and create the CLS. Normally, strains will produce CLS regardless of the media it is grown on. CLS growth is essentially unaffected by antibiotic treatment with chloramphenicol, as well as by cycloheximide. After 5 days of incubation, CLS production will be evident, suggesting the fungus is highly likely to be T. tonsurans. Responses of T. tonsurans to different growth conditions and nutrient media is useful in aiding identification. For example, growth is enhanced in the presence of thiamine, and this exogenous requirement for thiamine distinguishes T. tonsurans from similar species. Since thiamine stimulates growth, T. tonsurans also displays this behaviour on vitamin-free, thiamine-supplemented casamino acids agar but the growth is more sparse, and subsurface growth is absent. BCP-milk solids glucose agar can also be used as an indicator of this fungus. This medium turns from pale blue to purple in colour in 7‚Äì14 days of growth at . The colour change is due to an alkaline shift arising from the release of ammonium during protein hydrolysis. Epidemiology Trichophyton tonsurans causes tinea capitis infection globally, but it is especially endemic in Latin America (especially northern Brazil), Mexico, and Africa. Infections due to this species have become increasingly common in the United States and Canada since the 1980s as a consequence of changing patterns in global travel and immigration, and it is responsible for a majority of pediatric tinea capitis infections in the US. The modes of dispersal are unclear, though it is associated with homes, schools and other institutions, and barbershops. Transmission can occur through direct transfer, or through the use of shared resources and facilities such as pillows, couches, rugs, and pets, which should be thoroughly examined because they can be carriers of T. tonsurans. Children are most susceptible to Tinea capitis whereas adult infections more often manifest as tinea corporis. This species is a major cause of family and institutional outbreaks because of its persistent nature in indoor environments, and its ability to be transmitted through asymptomatic carriers. Pathophysiology Once the fungal infection has been contracted, it invades hairs and sporulates in the hair shaft, causing it to burst and curl, creating a black dot on the scalp. Tinea capitis is the clinical disease, but it may also cause Tinea corporis, onychomycosis, and Tinea pedis. Cutaneous lesions due to T. tonsurans do not fluoresce under Wood's Lamp. Although some people may not show the symptoms of carrying T. tonsurans, it has a distinctive manifestation. During pathogenesis, the fungus undergoes protease elaboration to hydrolyze structural proteins (such as the keratin found in hair), and isolates show peak values between days 18‚Äì22 during the sporulation phase. There are potentially 23 genes that may have mechanistic roles of this skin infection, and 21 show significant differences in infection rates, especially among children. The genes are typically involved in leukocyte activation and migration, and formation and integrity of the extracellular matrix. In molecular studies of its virulence, common target genes include CarbM14, CER, and Sub2, which encode the proteases carboxypeptidase, ceraminidase, and subtilisin, respectively. Among other virulence-related enzymes, T. tonsurans also produces urease. This fungus has also been found to produce melanin, which may be phenotypically demonstrated through in vitro induction in caffeic acid media. Melanin acts as an antioxidant molecule, providing protective properties to the fungus from damaging UV rays. Since it is endemic in sunny regions, the melanin production is perhaps crucial for survival. In early stages of infection, the lesion has a clear and raised border, although there is not much hair loss yet. However, as it progresses, infected hairs break off at the scalp surface and the scalp is eventually coated in a scaly layer, with short hair stubs remaining. Twisted hairs may be found in keratotic follicular papules that will be formed. The infection is often called \\"black dot ringworm\\" due to the small dark hair stubs that are found on the scalp. Inflammatory reactions are also quite common and can manifest as edema, abscess, or highly inflammatory kerion. Hair regrowth does occur, although some scarring may remain. Males have a tendency to show greater improvement in non-inflammatory presentation as well. Although there are several treatments available, tinea capitis often has no subjective symptoms, so people at risk for infection should still receive fungal examinations regularly. Treatment Treatment options include antifungal shampoo, systemic antifungals, or both. Oral therapy is indicated for complicated infections of those that fail to respond to topical treatment. Still, the use of selenium sulphide or povidone-iodine shampoos greatly reduce fungal viability and may be helpful in person-to-person transmission. Advancements have been made in detection of T. tonsurans in patients with Tinea capitis, using TaqMan PCR assay and primers and probes designed to detect this fungus rapidly and specifically, excluding contaminating skin microorganisms.

The female demons, among whom Lilith is the best-known, are often said to have come from the primeval sea. In ancient Greek religion, female sea monsters that combine allure and deadliness may also derive from this tradition, including the Gorgons (who were daughters of the old sea god Phorcys), sirens, harpies, and even water nymphs and Nereids.A.A. Barb, \\"Antaura. The Mermaid and the Devil's Grandmother: A Lecture,\\" Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 29 (1966), p. 6 In the Septuagint, the Greek version of the Hebrew Bible, the word Abyssos is treated as a noun of feminine grammatical gender, even though Greek nouns ending in -os are typically masculine. Abyssos is equivalent in meaning to Abzu as the dark chaotic sea before Creation. The word also appears in the Christian New Testament, occurring six times in the Book of Revelation, where it is conventionally translated not as \\"the deep\\" but as \\"the bottomless pit\\" of Hell. Barb argues that in essence the Sumerian Abzu is the \\"grandmother\\" of the Christian Devil.Barb, \\"Antaura,\\" pp. 10‚Äì12. The Testament of Solomon In the late antique Testament of Solomon,Testament of Solomon 58‚Äì59, translation and introduction by F.C. Conybeare, Jewish Quarterly Review 11 (1898), p. 30 online. Abyzou (as Obizuth) is described as having a \\"greenish gleaming face with dishevelled serpent-like hair\\"; the rest of her body is covered by darkness.Barb, \\"Antaura,\\" p. 9. The speaker (\\"King Solomon\\") encounters a series of demons, binds and tortures each in turn, and inquires into their activities; then he metes out punishment or controls them as he sees fit. Put to the test, Abyzou says that she does not sleep, but rather wanders the world looking for women about to give birth; given the opportunity, she will strangle newborns. She claims also to be the source of many other afflictions, including deafness, eye trouble, obstructions of the throat, madness, and bodily pain.Barb, \\"Antaura,\\" p. 5; for online texts of the Testament, see \\"Selected bibliography\\" below. Solomon orders that she be chained by her own hair and hung up in front of the Temple in public view. The writer of the Testament appears to have been thinking of the gorgoneion, or the icon of the Medusa's head, which often adorned Greek temples and occasionally Jewish synagogues in late antiquity. Envy is a theme in the Testament,Fr. George R.A. Aquaro, Death by Envy: The Evil Eye and Envy in the Christian Tradition (iUniverse, 2004), p. 99 online. and during his interrogation by the king, Beelzebub himself asserts that he inspires envy among humans.Testament of Solomon 27, p. 22 in Conybeare. Among the succession of demons bound and questioned, the personification of Envy is described as headless, and motivated by the need to steal another's head: \\"I grasp in an instant a man's head ... and put it on myself.\\"Testament of Solomon 43‚Äì44, p. 26 in Conybeare. As with Envy's Sisyphean efforts to replace his head, Abyzou (Obizuth) cannot rest until she steals a child each night. On medical amulets Amulet depicting Abyzou whipped by Arlaph On the inscribed healing amulets of the Near Eastern and Graeco-Roman magico-medical tradition, illness or affliction is often personified and addressed directly; the practitioner may be instructed to inscribe or chant a phrase that orders the ailment to depart: for example, \\"Flee, Fever!\\"For an example of a course of treatment employing a \\"flee\\" charm, see article on Medicina Plinii. The ailment may also be conceived of as caused by a demon, who must be identified correctly by name and commanded to depart. In this mode, magico-healing practice bears comparison to exorcism.Roy Kotansky, \\"Incantations and Prayers on Inscribed Greek Amulets,\\" in Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion, edited by Christopher A. Faraone and Dirk Obbink (Oxford University Press, 1991), pp. 113‚Äì114 and 119; on exorcism of the childbirth demon, Abyzou is depicted and named on several early Byzantine bronze amulets. With her hands tied behind her back, she kneels as she is whipped by a standing figure, identified as Solomon or Arlaph, called Afarof in the Testament of Solomon and identified with the archangel Raphael. On one amulet, the figure is labeled as Arlaph, but an inscription reads \\"The Seal of Solomon [is] with the bearer; I am Noskam.\\" The reverse inscription is written within an ouroboros, the symbol of a snake biting its tail to form a circle: \\"Flee, flee, Abyzou, [from] Sisinios and Sisinnia; the voracious dog dwells here.\\" (Saint Sisinnios sometimes takes the Solomon role on Christian amulets.) Although Abyzou is regarded mainly as a threat to child-bearing women and to infants, some of the names of those seeking protection from her on extant amulets are masculine.Jeffrey Spier, \\"Medieval Byzantine Magical Amulets and Their Tradition,\\" Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 56 (1993), pp. 37‚Äì38, full text available online. Medieval amulets show a variation on this iconography, with Abyzou trampled underfoot by a horseman. The rider is identified again either as Solomon or Arlaph; one example depicts the rider as Sisinnios, with the demon named as both Abizou and Anabardalea, and an angel named Araph (for Arlaph) standing by with one raised wing. The medieval lead amulets that show the rider subduing the female often have a main image that resembles a gorgoneion and is likely a womb symbol (hystera).Fulgum, \\"Coins Used as Amulets in Late Antiquity,\\" p. 142; Spier, \\"Medieval Byzantine Magical Amulets,\\" pp. 38‚Äì40. The names of Abyzou In one magic-related text, the archangel Michael confronts Abyzou and compels her to tell him the 40 names that can control her.Sergio Giannobile and D.R. Jordan, \\"A Lead Phylactery from Colle san Basilio (Sicily),\\" Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies 46 (2006), p. 80, citing Cod.Marc.gr.app. II 163 in F.

In magico-religious practice, the knowledge of the secret name of a deity, divine force, or demon offers power over that entity.The secrecy surrounding the correct names of gods extended to prayer formularies in general and was characteristic of Ancient Egyptian religion, mystery religions, early Christianity and Judaism, and other religions of antiquity. See Matthias Klinghardt, \\"Prayer Formularies for Public Recitation: Their Use and Function in Ancient Religion,\\" Numen 46 (1999) 1‚Äì52, and for an example of dire consequences attending on the revelation of a secret name, see article on Quintus Valerius Soranus. In the Testament of Solomon, the demon herself declares that she has ten-thousands of names and forms, and that Raphael is her antithesis. She says that if her name is written on a scrap of papyrus when a woman is about to give birth, \\"I shall flee from them to the other world.\\"Barb, \\"Antaura,\\"p. 5; Spier, \\"Medieval Byzantine Magical Amulets and Their Tradition,\\" p. 12.

In one Greek tale set in the time of \\"Trajan the King\\", Gyllou under torture reveals her \\"twelve and a half names\\": In medieval texts, one of Gylou's twelve and a half names is given as Anabardalea, a name also associated with Abyzou.Spier, \\"Medieval Byzantine Magical Amulets,\\" p. 38.

Early career and playing style Born at Carlton, Leeds, on 29 March 1911, Lawrence made his name in the Bradford Cricket League in the 1930s, but was not able to break into the strong Yorkshire side, though he played Second Eleven cricket at Minor Counties level. He qualified by residence to play for Somerset at the end of 1939 but then had to wait until after World War II before making his debut, by which time he was 35 years old.However, for all of his cricket career and right up to the time of his death, his birth year was given as 1914. Short and enthusiastic, Lawrence was a pugnacious batsman who, according to one account, \\"could on occasions bat with irremovable resolve\\". As a bowler, in the description of the cricket writer Alan Gibson, Lawrence was \\"one of the slowest bowlers I have ever seen. There were times when he would deliberately bowl slower and slower, until he almost reached the state of Sir James Barrie, who declared that he could bowl a ball so slow that if he did not like the look of it he could run after it and catch it.\\" First-class cricketer Lawrence was an instant success in Somerset's 1946 side, winning his county cap in his first season, scoring 968 first-class runs and taking 66 wickets. The wickets were fewer and more expensive in 1947, but he took his first five-wicket haul in an innings with six for 53 against Hampshire at Weston-super-Mare. At the end of the 1947 season, though a Somerset player, he was picked for the North team in the regular North v South match at Harrogate. The 1948 season saw the start of Lawrence's best bowling years, though his batting fell away. His aggregate of wickets rose from 45 in 1947 to 82, and the bowling average fell from more than 36 runs per wicket to just 22. His two best bowling performances came against Yorkshire, with six for 29 in the match at Harrogate followed by six for 35 in the return match at Taunton. At the end of the season, he played for an England XI in a match at Cardiff Arms Park to celebrate Glamorgan's first County Championship, the only non-Test player in the side. But that and the North v South match the previous year remained the extent of his representative cricket. In 1949, he took 100 wickets for the first time, finishing with 107 at a bowling average of 22.73, but his batting declined even further and he finished without a single 50 to his name all season and with a batting average of less than 14 runs per innings. His eight for 63 in an innings against Hampshire at Portsmouth was the best return of his career so far. But he bettered that performance and his wickets tally the following season, 1950. Against Worcestershire at Worcester, he took eight for 41 on a rain-affected pitch, and these remained the best bowling figures of his career. They contributed to a total of 115 wickets which was not only his highest season aggregate but also, with a bowling average of 18.90, the best season's figures of his career. Moreover, in 1950 his batting form returned and he scored 981 runs, the nearest he came in his career to the all-rounder's \\"double\\" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in an English cricket season. A contributory factor in his bowling success was his understanding with the Somerset wicketkeeper, Harold Stephenson. Somerset's cricket historian described it thus: \\"The prodigious leg-break would beat the bat and 'Steve' would knock off the bails with the merest flick. The glee on Lawrence's face as an exasperated batsman pounded forward and missed...\\" Senior professional Lawrence turned 40 in March 1951 and over the remaining five years of his first-class career there was a subtle change in his role as a Somerset cricketer. Reliable throughout for 70 or more wickets a season, he never passed 100 again, though he got close with 93 in 1954. But his batting continued to develop and was increasingly important in a side whose frailties in every department consigned it to the foot of the County Championship for four consecutive seasons from 1952 to 1955. He was also a fine slip fielder. In 1951, he scored 1,000 runs in a season for the first time, reaching 1067 at an average of less than 21. The following year, 1952, his average rose to 25 on the back of a lot of not-out innings, and he missed the 1,000 runs. But in this season he scored the first two centuries of his career. His first was an unbeaten 103 against the Indians at Taunton, when he batted at No 9 and shared a ninth-wicket partnership of 133 with William Dean, whose only first-class match this was. It was the 306th innings of Lawrence's first-class career, and two months later, again batting at No 9, he followed it with a second century, 111, made against Essex at Taunton. He was Somerset's leading wicket-taker too in 1952, but his 78 wickets cost 30.45 runs each. The bowling return in 1953 was similar, with 70 wickets at 31.77, and the weakness in Somerset's batting rather than any advance in Lawrence's skills led to him being used further up the batting order than in other seasons, even, for a period, opening the innings alongside the long-standing opener Harold Gimblett. He passed 1,000 runs for the season again, though he averaged marginally less than 20 runs an innings. Lawrence was awarded a benefit match by Somerset in 1954, and though the match itself was spoilt by rain, the benefit fund eventually reached ¬£3,000. This was despite the fact that, as a strict Methodist, Lawrence refused to allow any Sunday matches to be arranged for his benefit. Lawrence's death was not recorded in the 1989 Wisden. In the 1990 Wisden, it precedes that of his son Miles, who died just four months later. He also forbade any raffles to be organised for his benefit. In the 1954 cricket season itself, Lawrence responded by making 929 runs and taking 93 wickets, nearer to the elusive double than in any other season apart from 1950. Moreover, the cost of the wickets fell significantly, to 20.66 runs per wicket. For the third consecutive year, he was Somerset's leading wicket-taker. The 1955 season saw the start of a transition in the Somerset side, and the reliance on Lawrence lessened. He still took more than 70 wickets with his leg-spin, and his batting aggregate, at 1128, was his highest for a season. When he made 122 in a second innings follow-on that saved the match for Somerset against Worcestershire at Worcester, he made the highest score of his entire first- class career. Yet within a month, he had asked to be released from his county contract and he left the Somerset staff at the end of the season. After county cricket As part of its programme to revive after four years at the foot of the County Championship, Somerset had been looking far and wide for new players, and among the arrivals in the next couple of seasons were the Australians Colin McCool and Bill Alley, both of whom had been playing Lancashire League cricket. Lawrence went in the other direction: he left Somerset after the 1955 season and took up a contract to be the professional at Haslingden Cricket Club for 1956. Haslingden finished at the bottom of the league that season and Lawrence did not return for the 1957 season. In 1958, he started playing Minor Counties cricket for Lincolnshire and stayed with the side for 10 years, playing his final match for the side at the age of 56 in 1967. The year before, 1966, Lincolnshire qualified for the Gillette Cup List A competition, where the team played Hampshire in a first round match at Southampton that ran into a second day. Lawrence bowled seven overs without taking a wicket and made 2 not out as his side lost by 31 runs. While playing for Lincolnshire, Lawrence resumed his career in the Bradford Cricket League, and he also ran indoor cricket schools in Yorkshire at Lordswood and Rothwell, where among the cricketers he coached was Geoffrey Boycott. He died at Toulston near Tadcaster on 10 December 1988, aged 77. Family Lawrence's son, Miles Lawrence, also a right-handed batsman and leg-break bowler, played 18 first-class matches for Somerset between 1959 and 1961. A younger son, Stephen, played Minor Counties cricket for Cheshire. Character Even Wisden noted that Lawrence was a \\"cheerful\\" cricketer. The history of Somerset cricket put it at greater length: \\"His cheerful disposition was much to the liking of the dressing-room occupants, though his non-conformist attitudes, including his much-voiced disapproval of what is quaintly called industrial language, could be a little too inhibiting for those with a bent for freewheeling linguistics at the end of an unrewarding afternoon in the sun.\\" Another admirer wrote: \\"He was a jolly, kindly man, and perhaps the biggest contribution he made to Somerset cricket was his laughter and comradeship in the dressing room, at a time when things were generally going wrong.\\" References External links 1911 births 1988 deaths English cricketers Somerset cricketers Cricketers from Leeds Lincolnshire cricketers North v South cricketers Non-international England cricketers ","title":"Johnny Lawrence"},{"id":"20633649","text":"Norton railway station can apply to the following railway stations in England: *Norton railway station (Cheshire), a former station in Norton, Cheshire, England *Norton railway station (South Yorkshire), a former station in Norton, South Yorkshire, England *Norton railway station (Worcestershire), a former Birmingham and Gloucester Railway station, closed in 1846 *Norton Halt railway station, a former Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway station in Norton, Worcestershire, England *Worcestershire Parkway railway station, a current station in Norton, Worcestershire, England ","title":"Norton railway station"},{"id":"20633655","text":"Ogilbyina novaehollandiae, the multicolour dottyback, is a species of ray- finned fish from the family Pseudochromidae, the dottybacks from the Western Central Pacific where it is confined to the Great Barrier Reef.

The University is the only comprehensive state university in Eastern Visayas, offering the largest number of undergraduate and graduate degree programs and short-term courses and certificates among the higher education institutions in the region. Its flagship campus is in Catarman, Northern Samar. The University of Eastern Philippines is the first State University in the Visayas. History The University of Eastern Philippines began as the Catarman Farm School (CFS) in September 1918 in a 516-hectare site of forested mountains and rice fields facing the Pacific Ocean. Then Governor Clodualdo Lucero proposed and sought the approval of the Provincial Board for the establishment of the school. Its first principal was Washington Wiren from Maine, USA. He was succeeded by Filipino graduates from American agricultural institutions. Dr. Felipe O. Cevallos from Bicol became the first Filipino principal, followed by Pedro Montellano who was on special detail from the Department of Agricultural Education, College of Agriculture, UP in 1923, and by Sabino Q. Ami who opened the secondary Home Economics curriculum in 1930. Agapito Buenaventura came next and was succeeded by Eulogio Acu≈àa whose term was interrupted by the war in 1941. The CFS was later named Catarman Agricultural School (CAS), which was proposed by Representative Pedro Mendiola of Catarman, raising its status to Insular Provincial, and subsequently making it the Catarman Agricultural High School (CAHS). In 1946 Congressman Agripino Escareal and Senate President Jose Avelino Sr. worked for the complete nationalization of the school. Thus in 1950 the school‚Äôs name was once more changed to the Catarman National Agricultural High School (CNAHS). With the rapid growth of knowledge and the urgent call for scientific and technological involvement of schools in rebuilding a nation, Samar Congressman Eladio Balite of Bobon, Northern Samar sponsored House Bill 6559 creating the Samar Institute of Technology (SIT), which Pres. Carlos P. Garcia signed into R.A. 1434. With Senators Gil Puyat and Decoroso Rosales and Congressman Balite, SIT was inaugurated on September 7, 1958. The first and only President of SIT was Colonel Emeterio Asinas (Ret.) of Catubig, Northern Samar. It was in his term that the Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Chapel (which houses the University chaplain) and the UEP Centre for Culture and Pageantry (commonly known as the RAB Amphitheatre) were founded. When he retired on March 4, 1963, Prof. Toribio G. Sorio of Bobon, Northern Samar, Executive Vice President, took over as officer-in-charge until SIT became a university. In response to the pressing need for manpower development necessary for the upliftment of the socio-economic condition of the service area, House Bill 4050, sponsored by Congressman Eladio T. Balite, was signed by President Diosdado Macapagal on June 20, 1964 converting SIT into the University of Eastern Philippines. UEP is mandated to \\"primarily give technical and professional training, advanced instruction in literature, philosophy, the sciences and the arts, besides providing for the promotion of scientific and technological researches.\\" The elevation of the school to a university status has, in fact, paved the way towards dramatic increase in its academic, research, and extension programs as well as the creation of additional colleges, institutes, centers, and offices. UEP's first president was Dr. Narciso N. Pepito of Cebu who assumed office on January 24, 1966. The Veterinary Medicine Building, Science Building, extensions of the Farm Shop and Machinery Building, the Brackish Water fishpond, former College of Education Building, and the University Research Center were among the completed projects prior to President Pepito's retirement in May 1976. Before Pres. Pepito‚Äôs successor was named, the Head Executive Assistant, Atty Sergio Gelera, Sr. of Catarman, World War II hero of Calbayog, became the OIC. He was responsible for opening graduate programs. From November 1977-November 1983, Dr. Aurora Balite Merida, of Bobon, Northern Samar was appointed as the second president. Her time was when the Australians descended upon Samar for the Northern Samar Integrated Rural Development Project (NSIRDP) and linkages with outside agencies took the form of allowing hectares of lands for the NSIRDP‚Äôs and these agencies‚Äô use. Between the end of President Merida‚Äôs term and the appointment of the next president, the CBA Dean, Dr. Gerardo Delorino, became the OIC. In 1985, Dr. Andres F. Celestino, by birth from Nueva Ecija but a Samare√±o at heart because of marriage and residence, became the 3rd UEP President. A diploma graduate (With Distinction) of the University of Reading, England, he spent more time supervising classes, projects, and construction works. His one consuming, overriding passion: real high quality education informed by research, effective teachers and selective admission and retention. He put up the Institute for Agricultural and Rural Development (IARD), the NSIRDP-ADAB-founded NORSARC, and the UEP Research and Development Foundation with the research grants from the IDRC, Canada; PCMARD and PhilRice. He applied for UEP‚Äôs membership in the Association of Asian Agricultural Colleges and Universities (AAACU). Towards the end of the project, the NSIRDP equipped the Crop and Livestock Diagnostic Laboratory with sophisticated scientific equipment for the Biology Laboratory. The NSIRDP, too, turned over its duck dispersal program and the residences of the Australian nationals to the school. When President Celestino was gunned down in office on April 5, 1990, Dr. Leonor A. Ong Sotto, then Vice President for Academic Affairs, took over UEP‚Äôs helm. On November 15, 1990, Dr.Pedro D. Destura a UEP and UPLB alumnus from Urdaneta, Lavezares, Northern Samar became its 4th President. With President Destura‚Äôs win-win solutions to problems, he succeeded in enhancing UEP‚Äôs educational opportunities and in reinvigorating the University‚Äôs Faculty Development Program, which gave rise to a number of PhDs and MAs. UEP became a Learning Center for the UP Open University, the Regional Science Teaching Center (RSTC) for the non-science and non- mathematics teachers in the elementary and high schools in Region VIII for the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), and the DOE‚Äôs extension arm in the promotion, development and utilization of new and renewable energy technologies and systems in Eastern Visayas via the UEP Affiliated Renewable Energy Center (AREC). In 1999 the Pedro Rebadulla Memorial Agricultural College (PRMAC) and the Laoang National Trade School (LNTS), formerly CHED- supervised institutions, were integrated into the University. Since then, they have been operating as UEP PRMC Catubig Campus and UEP-Laoang Campus under the UEP System. After 17 years of service, Dr. Destura left UEP On February 11, 2007. Prior to the selection of a regular successor, the Board of Regents appointed Dr. Milagros Esparrago, Chief Education Program Specialist of CHED Regional Office V, as UEP‚Äôs Officer-in-Charge. On June 15, 2007 in Tacloban City, Atty Mar P. De Asis of Catubig, Northern Samar took his oath of office as the 5th president of the university. A Doctor of Philosophy in Educational Management, he is the second UEP alumnus to occupy the University‚Äôs highest position. Atty de Asis brings to the post his sterling achievement as dean of the College of Law for fourteen years. Under his stewardship, UEP‚Äôs College of Law consistently placed among the top law schools all over the country. His 13 years experience with the Development Bank of the Philippines and as a lawyer is paying off well in managing and operating the university. He assumed the position at a young age of 48, but because he has the drive to excel and the discipline of working at the DBP, coupled with his natural ability to lead, he revolutionalized UEP‚Äôs management. Within his first term of office, he was able to lead the university to its desired direction. He is presently serving his second term as UEP President. The University of Eastern Philippines takes pride and honor for being the lone comprehensive and the biggest state university in the entire Eastern Visayas region, catering to the human resources and socio-economic development of its service area through the years. As an old but dynamic institution of higher learning, it has gone through significant stages of development until it finally attained a university status and became one of the nationally known higher education institutions in the country. On December 10, 2019, the Board of Regents (BOR) of the University of Eastern Philippines chose Dr. Cherry Iba√±ez Ultra as the next University President. She is professor at the College of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Natural Resources (CAFNR), Dr. Ultra holds a PhD in Agricultural Economics degree from the University of the Philippines in Los Ba√±os. Dr. Ultra succeeds Dr. Rolando A. Delorino in the key university post. She is the university's seventh president (and second lady president). Legal basis UEP is mandated, through Republic Act No. 4126, to \\"primarily give technical and professional training, advanced instruction in literature, philosophy, the sciences and the arts, besides providing for the promotion of scientific and technological researches and democratic access to education to poor but deserving students, not only in Northern Samar, but also in other parts of the country.\\" Campuses and academics UEP has campuses in three municipalities of Northern Samar, Catarman, Laoang, and Catubig. The following colleges, schools, and institutes comprise the Catarman campus: # College of Agriculture, Fisheries and Natural Resources, which offers the BS Agriculture, BS Agricultural Education, BS Agribusiness, BS Fisheries, and BS Forestry degrees. # College of Arts and Communication, which offers the AB major in Language and Literature Teaching, AB Political Science, AB major in Sociology, BS Criminology, BS Community Development, BS Development Communication, and BS Public Administration degrees. # College of Business Administration, which offers the BS Accountancy, BS Business Administration major in Management, BS Business Administration major in Marketing, BS Business Economics, BS in Cooperatives, BS Entrepreneurship, and BS Hotel and Restaurant Management degrees. # College of Education, which offers the Bachelor in Elementary Education (with various specializations) and Bachelor in Secondary Education (with various majors) degrees. # College of Engineering, which offers BS Civil Engineering, BS Electrical Engineering, BS Industrial Engineering, and BS Mechanical Engineering degrees. # College of Law, which offers the Bachelor of L'aws degree. # College of Nursing, which offers the BS in Nursing, BS in Radiologic Technology degrees and BS Pharmacist degrees. # College of Science, which offers BS Biology, BS Chemistry, BS Environmental Studies, BS Information Technology, BS Marine Biology, and BS Mathematics degrees. # College of Veterinary Medicine, which offers Doctor of Veterinary Medicine and Bachelor of Science in Meat Technology degrees. # Graduate School # Institute of Land and Water Resources Management, which offers the BS Agricultural Engineering degree.

Early life and education Bullock was born in Goldsboro, North Carolina. He lived in North Carolina until he was about 12, when his mother died and he and his younger sister, Gloria, moved to Brooklyn to live with their father and his wife. (three-page article) He said he wanted to become a pilot, a police officer, or a U.S. Marine. Career When he was 14 years old, he altered the date on his birth certificate to show that he was born December 21, 1949. He processed through the recruiting station, and enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps on September 18, 1968. He was a member of Platoon 3039 at Parris Island. At first he struggled to make it through, but was able to do so with the help of one of his fellow recruits. Bullock graduated from boot camp on December 10, 1968. Private first class Bullock arrived in the Republic of Vietnam on May 18, 1969, and was assigned as a rifleman in 2nd Squad, 2nd Platoon, Company F, 2nd Battalion 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division. He was stationed at An Hoa Combat Base, west of H·ªôi An in Qu·∫£ng Nam Province. Less than a month later on June 7, 1969, Bullock and 3 other Marines were occupying a bunker near the base airstrip when a People's Army of Vietnam sapper unit attacked the base at night, throwing a satchel charge into the bunker killing all 4 Marines; Bullock was just 15 years old. He had been assigned to cleaning duty that night, but was transferred to the night watch after one Marine was wounded on night duty. After he was interred, his gravesite did not have a marker. A veteran's marker was finally provided in 2000. Legacy On June 7, 2003 a section of Lee Avenue in Brooklyn, where Bullock had lived since age 11, was renamed in his honor. In 2019, a North Carolina state historical marker honoring his life was erected near his childhood home in Goldsboro NC. Marine Corps League, Brooklyn #1, Detachment 217 usually holds a color guard memorial ceremony each June on Lee Avenue honoring Pfc. Bullock.

In this configuration, the intake is in the upper rear center of the aircraft, above or below the stabilizer, while the exhaust and engine is at the rear of the aircraft. The S-duct is located in the tail, or empennage, of the aircraft. The shape of the S-duct is distinctive and easily recognized, and was used in several aircraft, beginning in 1962 with the Hawker Siddeley Trident. Currently, the Dassault Falcon 8X and Dassault Falcon 900 business jets are the only aircraft in production that use the S-duct design.  Benefits and drawbacks  The S-duct was invented as a solution for positioning the central engine on trijets. The S-duct was easier to service than alternative trijet designs. Most trijet designs opted for the S-duct layout. Only the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and MD-11 trijets' designers chose not to use the S-duct and go with a \\"straight-through\\" layout. The straight- through layout leaves the engine high above the ground, making access difficult. The straight-through layout also increases total aircraft aerodynamic drag by 2‚Äì4%. Compared to the straight-through design on the DC-10 and MD-11, the S-duct allows a shorter fin and a rudder closer to the longitudinal axis. On the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, engineers were able to maintain engine performance comparable with straight-through designs by limiting the curve of the S-duct to less than a quarter of the radius of the engine intake diameter. The S-duct design also reduced the total empty aircraft weight. The research undertaken during the design of the L-1011 indicated that losses of using an S-duct were more than compensated for by the above savings. The S-shaped duct is a complicated and costly design. Since modern jet engines have more power and reliability than those of the 1970s and can safely power the aircraft with only two engines, the trijet design is no longer used for large commercial airliners but is used on the latest Dassault Falcon 7X and Falcon 8X business jets in order to provide significantly more total thrust while enabling the continued use of smaller engines in the 15-30kN class that all Falcons have historically been designed with. In international aviation regulations the triple engine layout is also considered inherently safer for the increased redundancy and this allows the use of certain airfields at high elevation only for aircraft with more than two engines. The S-duct also finds use on combat aircraft, where it has the important advantage of blocking the front of the jet engine from radar. The spinning compressor blades would produce a strong radar return, compared to the smooth sides of the duct. List of S-duct aircraft Aircraft currently built with S-ducts are the: *Dassault Falcon 7X *Dassault Falcon 900 *Dassault Rafale *Eurofighter Typhoon *Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Aircraft previously built with S-ducts, but no longer in production, are the: *Boeing 727 *Dassault Falcon 50 *Epic Victory *Hawker Siddeley Trident *IAI Lavi (inverse S-duct, with underside intake and the nozzles on upper fuselage) *Lockheed L-1011 TriStar *Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor *Lockheed YF-22 *Mikoyan Project 1.44 *Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit *Northrop YF-23 (inverse S-duct) *Short SC.1 *Sukhoi Su-47 *Tupolev Tu-154 *Tupolev Tu-154M *Yakovlev Yak-40 *Yakovlev Yak-42 The Boeing 747-300 Trijet (not to be confused with the later 747-300) was designed with an S-duct layout, but never built.

Their voicemail software replaces the voicemail service offered by mobile phone manufacturers, and offers webmail-like voicemail access and voicemail-to-text transcriptions. The company also compiles the YouMail Robocall index by monitoring automated call patterns and behaviors, and verifying that activity against numbers that its customers manually block or report as spam. History The YouMail brand visual voicemail software was first developed, trademarked and brought to market in 2006, by Auckland, New Zealand-based communications software developer Zeacom. The service originally started out as a multi-platform visual voicemail solution, with the novel feature of personal greetings, where users could create different greetings for callers based on their incoming caller ID. To help combat robocalls, their service replaces an ordinary voicemail, instead playing three notes that create the impression of a non-working number to stop further robocalls from coming in. YouMail was spun off as a standalone service in 2007. In November 2007, YouMail announced a partnership with Salient Media, to offer a combination of free and subscription-based comedic voicemail greetings. In 2009, the company saw its first success, with visual voicemail for BlackBerry. It also launched a free iPhone app, which was considered a loss leader for its voicemail transcription services. In 2010, the company announced that YouMail was the standard voicemail that comes with all mobile phones from IMMIX Wireless in Pennsylvania, Cellular One in East Central Illinois, Blue Wireless in New York, iSmart Mobile in Montana, VoicePulse in New Jersey, and Windy City Cellular in Adak, Alaska. In 2011, the company launched WhoAreYou, an app for Android that provides users with caller's names, and gives them the ability to add specific numbers to a block list, screening out robocalls and telemarketers in the process. By 2012, the company reported over 2.5 million registered users of its service. The company also announced they stopped supporting new updates for BlackBerry devices. In November 2015, the company launched the YouMail Robocall Index, to track legal and illegal robocall traffic across the US. The YouMail Robocall Index is a unique online portal which provides a monthly estimate of the volumes and types of robocalls nationwide, and for each specific state, city and area code. The initial report indicated at that time that 1 out of every 6 calls received in the US was generated by a machine. The ongoing monthly estimate is created by extrapolating from the behavior of the billions of calls that YouMail has managed for its users. YouMail identifies problematic numbers through its audio fingerprinting technology and analysis of calling patterns, along with direct consumer feedback. In turn, the Index‚Äôs statistics have been regularly cited by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), consumer advocates and many other groups as the national source for robocalling data trends. YouMail won the American Business Awards' Gold Stevie Award for Technical Innovation of the Year, and the YouMail app was named the nation's best robocall-blocking solution in a competition organized by Geoffrey Fowler of The Washington Post. Products =Voicemail apps= YouMail develops visual voicemail apps for Android phones and iPhones. The app features a voice-to-text feature which automatically transcribes voice messages and displays the text on-screen. This allows users to get their messages without having to listen to them. The company also produces WhoAreYou for Android, which enhances their visual voicemail app by adding call and text blocking and real-time reverse lookups on incoming calls and SMS messages. The app can deter callers by picking up the call, playing a recorded \\"out of service\\" message to the caller, and hang back up, making the caller think the line has been disconnected. The company's visual voicemail app is preloaded or recommended by other carriers including Viaero Wireless and RedPocketMobile. =YouMail Robocall Index= The company also produces the YouMail Robocall Index, which announced in January 2016 that Americans received over one billion unsolicited or automated calls in December 2015. Atlanta, Georgia was identified as the area hardest hit by robocalls, with Houston, Texas in second. US robocalls have reached new highs in the years since, leading to President Trump signing legislation on December 31, 2019 to help reduce the volume of unwanted robocalls. In March 2020, the index identified an expanding set of robocalls leveraging the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying these illegal calls, YouMail notified carriers, enterprises, and the authorities to locate, take down, and punish the callers, helping shut down the COVID-19 scams in just days. =YouMail virtual numbers and receptionist= YouMail virtual numbers provide a second phone number to separate business calls from personal calls, while keeping cell phones private and protected from unwanted calls. YouMail's virtual receptionist is an auto- attendant that creates an impression of a big business that callers reach. =Third party development= Third party developers use YouMail's API to create apps for other platforms, such as MagikMail for Windows Phone.

Leavitt was the brother of Roger Hooker Leavitt, with whom he operated an Underground Railroad station in Charlemont, Massachusetts, where the two brothers, aided by a third sibling in New York, the reformer and abolitionist publisher Joshua Leavitt, sheltered escaped slaves on their journey northward. The Massachusetts homes of Hart Leavitt and his brother Roger Hooker are both listed today on the National Park Service's Underground Railroad Network to Freedom.  Biography  Hart Leavitt was born in Heath, Massachusetts in 1809, the son of landowner and Massachusetts legislator Roger Leavitt and his wife Chloe (Maxwell) Leavitt, and the grandson of Charlemont's first minister, Congregationalist Rev. Jonathan Leavitt, who was eventually turned out by the town for his Loyalist sentiments. Hart Leavitt graduated from Hopkins Academy, which his brother Roger Hooker Leavitt attended as well. The rest of his life he devoted to his substantial business affairs, handling his family's landholdings and serving in the town, county and state government. Leavitt eventually relocated to nearby Greenfield, where his uncle Jonathan Leavitt was a well-known judge. Hart Leavitt operated a store next door to his uncle Jonathan's law office. The store was the location for Greenfield's first newspaper and post office. In October 1835 Hart Leavitt, along with brothers Roger Hooker and Joshua, attended a state convention held in Utica, New York, that was sponsored by the Utica Anti- Slavery Society. The convention's stated aim was to organize the New York Anti-Slavery Society. Hart Leavitt was one of a handful of delegates from outside New York. The convention was marred by violence by pro-slavery factions. Hart Leavitt's brother was already a fervent abolitionist, and following graduation from Yale Law School and Yale Divinity School, Rev. Joshua Leavitt had left both professions for the role of full-time editor of abolitionist and social reform publications including The Emancipator. In December 1836 the Franklin County Anti-Slavery was formed, tying together the strands of regional abolitionist sentiment. Merchant Hart Leavitt was a representative to the meeting. By 1840 Hart's father Roger was president of the Franklin County Anti-Slavery Society, and a co-founder with his son Joshua of the American & Foreign Anti-Slavery Society. That year Roger Leavitt, Hart's father, accepted the nomination of the newly formed Massachusetts Liberty Party to run for state Lieutenant Governor on an abolitionist ticket.Leavitt died the day after accepting the nomination. Hart Leavitt's mother Chloe had begun circulating a petition demanding the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. Hart Leavitt seems to have been increasingly politically active from the mid-1830s onward. By the late 1830 Hart Leavitt was using his Charlemont farm as an Underground Railroad station, shuttling a succession of fugitive former slaves, the most prominent of whom was Basil Dorsey, whom the Leavitt family (the three brothers and their father) sheltered and hid from pro-slavery forces. Dorsey lived with the family for over five years, during which time he apparently moved from one family home to another, hidden in plain sight.Early Florence History and Underground Railroad Studies, The David Ruggles Center, florencehistoryproject.org Leavitt also sheltered other slaves on their way to Canada, and Leavitt's underground activities were extensive enough to prompt Ohio State University historian Wilbur Siebert to list Leavitt as an operator of the Franklin County underground network, calling the merchant \\"a sturdy abolitionist who did all he could to help slaves gain their freedom.\\" Hart Leavitt served as a Selectman for several years for the town of Heath, a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, as well as a Justice of the Peace and Franklin County Commissioner from Charlemont during his later life. Hart Leavitt also served the town of Charlemont as a Selectman during the Civil War. He married in 1831 Mary Miller, daughter of Rev. Moses Miller of Heath. The couple had six children: sons Edward Hart, Joseph Ware, Joshua, Roger, Spencer Miller; and daughter Mary. The home of Hart and Mary Leavitt, located outside Charlemont, is listed on the National Park Service's Network to Freedom.Hart Leavitt also apparently lived for a time in a large home in Charlemont, which he subsequently sold to Allen Barnard of Boston.

She made her acting debut at the Stadttheater in Bielitz, and appeared in theatres in Budapest, Cottbus, Bonn, K√∂nigsberg, Stuttgart and at the National Theatre Mannheim. From 1930, she appeared at the Lessing Theater in Berlin. In Nazi Germany, she was not allowed to work as an actress because she was Jewish, and so she helped in the gynaecolological practice of her husband, Dr. Bernhard Heyde (1899‚Äì1978), in B√∂blingen. After the Kristallnacht, she planned to emigrate to Chile with her husband and her daughter Ruth (born 20 October 1927 in Mannheim), but the ship they were on was ordered to return to Hamburg because of the outbreak of World War II. She was later arrested by the Gestapo and interned in the concentration camp Fuhlsb√ºttel for six weeks. After the war, on 10 December 1945 she opened the Hamburger Kammerspiele theatre in the Hartungstra√üe in Rotherbaum in a theatre building that had been used by the J√ºdischer Kulturbund until 1941. In addition to modern German drama such as Wolfgang Borchert‚Äòs ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Man Outside‚Äô‚Äô (German: ‚Äò‚ÄôDrau√üen vor der T√ºr‚Äô‚Äô), she brought modern pieces by playwrights from other countries for the first time in Germany, including plays by Jean Anouilh, T. S. Eliot, Jean Giraudoux, Jean-Paul Sartre and Thornton Wilder. She continued managing the theatre until her death from a heart attack in 1989.

Originally it was intended to extend the line to the Franz Josef Strauss Airport by running the present-day S 8 above ground through the district. After local protests it was decided to lay the S-Bahn route from the southern edge of the district to Osterfeldstrasse in a tunnel. The tunnel station was built at the same spot as the old station and was opened on 17 May 1992. The delay in constructing the S-Bahn link had no negative impact on the airport, because its construction was postponed by legal disputes. Until 20 November 2005 Ismaning station was, apart from the tunnel station at the airport, the only underground S-Bahn station outside the main S-Bahn line in Munich. Since 21 November 2005 Unterf√∂hring station has also been underground.

Implementation of E-Government Principles . May 2005 FDIC Enterprise Architecture Framework was the Enterprise Architecture framework of the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). A lot of the current article is about the Enterprise Architecture Framework developed around 2005, and currently anno 2011 out-of-date.  Overview  The FDIC's framework for implementing its Enterprise Architecture was based on Federal and industry best practices, including the Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council's Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF) and the Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture. FDIC's framework was tailored to emphasize security. The historic FDIC EA framework complies with the FEAF and highlights the importance of security to all other components of the architecture.Implementation of E-Government Principles AUDIT REPORT, Report No. 05-018, May 2005 The FDIC EA framework included five components. The first component, the Business Architecture, focused on FDIC's business needs. The next three components, the Data Architecture, Applications Architecture, and Technical Infrastructure Architectures, focused on the technological capabilities that support the business and information needs. The final component, the Security Architecture, focused on specific aspects of interest to the Corporation that span the enterprise and must be integral parts of all other architectures.  History  Historically, Federal agencies managed IT investments autonomously. Until the new millennium, there was little incentive for agencies to partner to effectively reuse IT investments, share IT knowledge, and explore joint solutions. Starting in the second half of 1990 a collective, government-wide effort, supported by the Federal CIO Council, utilizing the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA), was undertaken in an effort to yield significant improvements in the management and reuse of IT investments, while improving services to citizens, and facilitating business relationships internally and externally.FDIC (2003). Information Technology Strategic Plan 2004‚Äì2007 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) first realized the value of Enterprise Architecture in 1997, when two business executives had to reconcile data that had come from different systems for a high-profile report to the banking industry. The FDIC's first EA blueprint was published in December 2002.Gregg Kreizman, Cathleen E. Blanton (2005) \\"The FDIC Is Aligning IT to Business Through Enterprise Architecture \\" Gartner, Inc. In 2004 the FDIC received a 2004 Enterprise Architecture Excellence Award from the Zachman Institute for Framework Advancement (ZIFA) for its initiative to manage corporate data collaboratively.FDIC Receives Technology Award  EA framework topics  = Historical FDIC EA framework = The FDIC EA framework from 2005 included five components. * Business Architecture : The Business Architecture described the activities and processes performed by the Corporation to achieve its mission and to realize its vision and goals. Developing the Business Architecture was the first step in creating an Enterprise Architecture (EA) that linked the Corporation's business needs to its Information Technology (IT) environment. Maximizing IT support for these requirements was intended to optimize Corporate performance. * Data Architecture : The Data Architecture described the activities required to obtain and maintain data that support the information needed by the Corporation‚Äôs major business areas. Data and information are different. Data is the foundation of information. Data is the raw material that is processed and refined to generate information. Information consists of a collection of related data that has been processed into a form that is meaningful to the recipient. * Applications Architecture : The Applications Architecture described the major types of applications that manage data to produce the information needed to support the activities of the Corporation. The Applications Architecture provided a framework that enabled the migration from the applications catalog and software development environment in use at the time to the target integrated applications, development and engineering environments. The target architecture promoted the use of commercial and government off-the-shelf products, consolidating applications, where applicable, and the use of emerging technologies where appropriate. * Technical Infrastructure Architecture : The IT infrastructure provided access to application systems and office automation tools used in performance of the business processes. The Corporation placed high priority on maintaining a consistent, available, and reliable technical infrastructure. The Technical Architecture described the underlying technology for the Corporation's business, data, and application processing. It included the technologies used for communications, data storage, application processing, and computing platforms. * Security Architecture : The Security Architecture established a framework for integrating safeguards into all layers of the FDIC's Enterprise Architecture. The security architecture used a risk management and information assurance strategy that provides access control, confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation for the Corporation's information and systems. = Self- Funding Model for Reinvestment in IT= Self-Funding Model for Future IT Development, 2008.CIO Council (2008) Information Technology Strategic Plan 2008‚Äì2013, January 23, 2008. The banking business model of 2008 had become more complex, giving rise to financial instruments such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and structured investment vehicles (SIVs) to manage risk. These instruments created greater dependencies between the domestic and international financial markets. Financial institutions of that time should have, therefore, struck a balance between regulatory, legislative and banker concerns while appropriately managing risk. Notionally, as cost savings are realized from a simplified IT environment and more efficient processes, the savings can be reinvested for IT improvements or accrue to the Corporation. This self-funding model is shown on the right. = 2008 - 2013 technology roadmap = The technology roadmap outlined the major initiatives for standardizing the IT environment and increasing IT‚Äôs efficiency and effectiveness over five years. The initiatives were determined by various sources including business-side IT roadmaps, executive management planning meetings, client planning sessions, and client year-end reviews. The three major initiatives identified were enterprise architecture, security and privacy programs, and fiscal discipline. Five-Year Technology Roadmap, 2008. The enterprise architecture initiative focused on simplifying the environment to ensure stable and economical performance for mission-critical applications. Simplifying the environment to decrease costs included activities, such as decreasing the number of application systems and migrating applications off the mainframe. Efficiencies were also hoped to be gained by expanding capabilities for manipulating large data sets and storing traditional paper- based files electronically. The SOA service center was intended to manage code (or services) for all development teams to discover and use, which was expected to save time and costs in application development, testing and deployment. The organization planned to continue to enhance IT security and privacy programs to address new and evolving risks by improving controls over sensitive data. In some cases, technology, such as scanning outgoing e-mail for sensitive information and encrypting removable storage devices, could mitigate potential risks. The other cornerstone of mitigating risk was educating employees of emerging security and privacy issues. Lastly, in order to continue sound fiscal discipline and responsibility, the organization planned to establish IT baselines and metrics, study steady-state costs, manage service level agreements, and more judiciously choose new development projects. These three areas ‚Äì enterprise architecture, security and privacy programs, and fiscal discipline ‚Äì are shown below with the estimated time frames.

The 160-page book features a two-page introduction, which explains that this book is an update and a revision of Hall of Heroes.Donovan, Dale and Paul Culotta. Heroes' Lorebook. (TSR, 1996) The book compiles information from novels and other sources published through the end of 1995. The book describes 60 characters, each including an illustration, game statistics, suggestions for campaign uses, and a list of the sources consulted for each character's entry. The book's center 16-page section (pages 73‚Äì88) presents a series of color illustrations, many of which were created especially for this book, depicting nearly half of the characters described in the book in a variety of scenes. Character descriptions appear on pages 6‚Äì135, and include such notables as Alias, Arilyn Moonblade, Bruenor Battlehammer, Danilo Thann, Drizzt Do'Urden, Dragonbait, Elminster, Khelben \\"Blackstaff\\" Arunsun, Olive Ruskettle, Shandril Shessair, and Wulfgar. Supplemental material on pages 136-158 includes notes on the Chosen of Mystra, magical items and effects, special wizard spells, heroic groups (including the Harpers and the Knights of Myth Drannor), and an index to the book. A list of sources mentioned throughout the book can be found on pages 159 and 160. Publication history The book, with product code TSR 9525, was published in 1996, and was written by Dale Donovan and Paul Culotta, with cover art by Doug Beckmann and interior art by Jordi Torres, Ned Dameron, Tony Crnkovich, and Valerie Valusek. Reception Paul Pettengale reviewed Heroes' Lorebook for Arcane magazine, rating it a 5 out of 10 overall. He stated that because the Forgotten Realms campaign is the most popular setting and has been around for so long, \\"and there have been so many novels written off the back of it, there are a huge number of heroes wandering the Realms. TSR has now gone about the herculean effort of cataloguing the lot and giving them stats, belongings and character summaries.\\" Pettengale concluded the review by saying, \\"Although this is a highly polished collection of characters, and the background detail is interesting for any fan of Forgotten Realms, one has to wonder at the actual use of it. If you were planning to introduce one of these ultra-powerful characters into your campaign, surely you could make up the stats yourself, and it's unlikely that you're ever going to use more than half a dozen of these characters. So, great in theory, but in practice I think it's a rather pointless exercise.\\" Rick Swan reviewed Heroes' Lorebook in brief for Dragon magazine #235 (November 1996). Swan commented on the usefulness of the book's content to players: \\"With so much history to digest, casual players may feel overwhelmed. But if you take the Realms seriously, and names like Alias and Drizzt Do'Urden make your pulse quicken, welcome to nirvana.\\" References 1996 books Forgotten Realms sourcebooks ","title":"Heroes' Lorebook"},{"id":"20634230","text":"Crazy World Tour Live...

Independents won 13 seats and other parties won 53. Six of the seven constituencies in the Hadiya Zone where elections were run, were won by the Hadiya National Democratic Organization led by Beyene Petros. The second round was held on August 31 for the Somali Region alone, with 23 seats reserved for the region in the House of Peoples' Representatives and the 168 seats in the State Council. About 75% of the 1.15 million registered voters in the Region cast ballots. Announced results gave 19 of the seats to the SPDP, and the remaining four to independent candidates. In the Regional elections, either the EPRDF or one of its member parties won the election except in Afar (where the Afar National Democratic Party won 84 of the 87 local seats), Benishangul- Gumuz (where the Benishangul Gumuz People's Democratic Unity Front won 71 of the 80 seats), Gambela (where the Gambela People's Democratic Front won 40 of the 53 seats), and Somali (where the Somali People's Democratic Party won 150 of the 168 seats). According to observers organized by Ethiopian Human Rights Council, local U.N. staff, diplomatic missions, political parties, and domestic non-governmental organizations, both the general and the regional elections that year were generally free and fair in most areas; however, serious election irregularities occurred in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region (SNNPR), particularly in the Hadiya Zone. Serious election irregularities in the SNNPR According to observers organized by Ethiopian Human Rights Council, local U.N. staff, diplomatic missions, political parties, and domestic non-governmental organizations, both the general and the regional elections that year were generally free and fair in most areas; however, serious election irregularities occurred in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region (SNNPR), particularly in the Hadiya Zone. As a result, the National Election Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) investigated the complaints and determined that many of them had merit. These included incidents of election officials instructing voters for whom to vote, candidates campaigning at polling stations, and candidates being pressured into quitting. There also were credible reports of ballot stuffing, vote count fraud, voter intimidation or bribery, dismissals from work, withholding of salaries, detentions, abductions, and killings. In its annual report on Human Rights, the US State Department stated that there were numerous credible reports that persons who supported or voted for opposition candidates were harassed. For example, there were credible reports that ruling party personnel withheld fertilizer and food aid in the SNNPR as retaliation for voters electing opposition candidates. According to the SEPDC, some of their supporters were suspended or dismissed from their jobs in retaliation, and some teachers in the SNNPR who served as SEPDC election observers found their salaries were withheld and were denied entry to summer update courses. many civil servants who supported the opposition were fired from their positions.

Tinkering with The Composer further, Kawasaki expanded its capabilities and began to refine it into separate programs designed to highlight different aspects of the original program.

The first disk, \\"The Performer\\", is divided into 8 different screens including Demos like the synchronized graphics/music demo entitled \\"Kawasaki Space Dance Theatre\\", a Keyboard Mode allowing input from the Commodore keyboard (top two rows) or Sight & Sound's \\"Incredible Musical Keyboard\\" (IMK) and selection of 21 preset instrumental/effects options and 13 pre-recorded songs with 2 LPs. The second disk, \\"The Composer\\" (an expansion of Kawasaki's original The Composer program), is divided into 4 different screens including a Keyboard Page allowing Monophonic or Polyphonic mode, a Sound Editing Page, and options to perform multifile chaining and three-track recording. The program came with a software version of a techno track by Kawasaki entitled \\"Satellite Station\\", and it allowed a user to select notes to be played and create songs that could then be saved. Numerous other typically Kawasakian influences were also notably discernible, including the \\"Kawasaki Space Dance Theatre\\" which depicted The Kicker Brothers, a pair of Thai kick boxers who would kick in time to the music. The program was regarded as having a dream-like fairy-tale atmosphere, and as future programs were released the color schemes (for example in Kawasaki Magical Musiquill) became increasingly psychedelic. Reception Reviewers from Compute!'s Gazette described Kawasaki Synthesizer as fast, intuitive, and spontaneous. Comparing Kawasaki Synthesizer to Peter Englebrite's Music Processor (which was also released by Sight & Sound for Commodore 64), reviewers found that the Kawasaki Synthesizer would most likely appeal to keyboard performers whereas the Music Processor would be better appreciated by musical arrangers. The review noted that the Sound Editing Page in \\"The Composer\\" module was the most important of the two discs, that the documentation was superb, and concluded that Kawasaki Synthesizer is \\"reasonably priced, brilliantly programmed, [and] attractively packaged\\".Hunkins, Arthur B. \\"Reviews: Sight & Sound Music Software - The Kawasaki Synthesizer\\".

Later synthesizers =Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker= Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker (developed in March 1984 and released in June of the same year) was noted to be considerably different from Kawasaki Synthesizer despite the fact that it used a similar keyboard input and was designed to allow the player to create music in a synthesizer style. The program featured space sounds and high- resolution graphics, a theme that would become common throughout Kawasaki's programs. Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker allowed the player to alter tempo, dub, and bass, and to record his compositions. =Kawasaki Magical Musiquill= The most colorful of Kawasaki's applications, Kawasaki Magical Musiquill was the last program Kawasaki designed as a non-game for children, with his next release, Kawasaki MIDI Workstation, designed as a serious work for professional studio use. =Kawasaki MIDI Workstation= Developed in 1986, Kawasaki MIDI Workstation was Kawasaki's only work of professional software, and after finishing this program he founded Satellites Records in 1987 and returned to making music of his own.

It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. It grows to a length of 24 cm.  Description  The magnificent rabbitfish's name is a reference to its rabbit-like facial features. Its face features black coloring and interlocking jaw. S. magnificus has a flat oval body and is one of the most colorful fish in the genus. Organisms grow to lengths of 24 centimeters. In addition it has a long tubular snout used to obtain food from the bottom of reefs. As well as 13 dorsal spines, 10 soft rays, 7 anal spines, 9 anal soft rays and 23 vertebrae.  Range and distribution  S. magnificus is endemic to the Andaman Sea. The species lives in the Indo-pacific region of the world. The species is only found in reef communities around the Simalian Islands, to as far as Java, Indonesia. The species is tropical,ranging from 15 degrees to 0 degrees latitude. It is usually found at a depth between 2 m- 30m. They live in water temperatures between 24 degrees Celsius and 28 degrees Celsius.  Behavior  Signus magnificus is oftentimes found in pairs or found alone. This makes them particularly difficult to find and study. Adults often occur in pair, but juveniles occur alone and hide around and under corals. Although they are not as venomous as other species of Rabbit Fish they are slightly venomous. When this species becomes startled they change to a pale gray color in order to camouflage themselves. Signus magnificus is usually non-aggressive, however when put together in a tank with members of the same species, the fish can become aggressive.  Diet  S. magnificus feeds on small algae and other plant material. Its preferred place to feed is the harder bottoms of coral reefs. It is suggested that it developed the long tubular nose for this reason. Although S. magnificus has a preferred food source of algae, it also feeds off of small invertebrates.  Biodiversity  A survey was taken of the genus Siganidae before the coral bleaching in 2010 and was abundant. Although S. magnificus is not a species of concern, it was noted that after the coral bleaching, the number of S. magnificus in southwestern Thailand decreased.

He was the oldest American on death row at the time of his death in February 2010. Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, Nash spent much of his life in and out of prison for crimes including transporting stolen vehicles, robbery, and attempted murder. He was first imprisoned in 1930 at 15 years old for armed robbery. In 1947 at 32 years old, he was sentenced to prison again after shooting a Connecticut police officer. He spent almost 25 years behind bars. In 1977 he was sentenced to life for having murdered postal carrier David J. Woodhurst, but escaped from a prison work crew in 1982, at age 66, where soon after he went into a coin shop in Phoenix, Arizona, and shot an employee dead. Nash was sentenced to death in 1983. His attorneys claimed that senility had rendered him legally incompetent to be executed, describing him as a \\"doddering old man, who can't hear, can't see, can't walk, and is very, very loony\\". The sentence was never carried out; Nash died of natural causes on February 12, 2010, at the age of 94 in the Arizona Eyman State Prison Complex.

Published in 1998 using Machiavelli's original source materials, the author recreates his biography. \\"Machiavellian\\" is a pejorative term suggesting serpentine scheming and use of immoral, ruthless means to achieve desired ends. Those ends usually include the maintenance of power at all costs. Some scholars assert that Machiavelli endorses these methods in his works on political philosophy. He lived in interesting but chaotic and often violent times. Viroli states that Machiavelli's longing for a powerful ruler was not merely based on a cynical wish to see power exercised; rather, he posits that Machiavelli hoped for a strong and, if necessary, devious ruler who could rule effectively but also wisely and justly. In his personal life, he is revealed here as a caring, sensitive man who, contrary to expectations, was frequently ruled by his heart rather than his head. Describing \\"Machiavelli's Dream\\", the author recounts a legend in which on his death bed, the great philosopher gathered his friends and told of a dream. In the dream, a band of ragged, poorly dressed and miserable men were the self-described \\"saintly and blessed; we are on our way to Heaven\\". He then saw a crowd of solemnly attired, noble men of grave appearance. He recognized among them Plato, Plutarch, and Tacitus. They told him \\"We are the damned of Hell\\". Machiavelli tells his friends he would be far happier in Hell where he could discuss politics with the great men of the ancient world, whereas in Heaven he would languish in boredom among the saintly and blessed.

He represented Annapolis County in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1793 to 1806.Sutherland, Stuart R J (1983), James Moody in Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online. Retrieved 2008-12-10. He wrote one of the most important loyalist memoires of the war.  Career  Lieutenant Moody who distinguish'd himself as one of the most gallant partizans in the British service, made himself the terror of the rebels, here freeing a British soldier held prisoner by the Americans. He was born in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey, on January 1, 1744, the son of John Moody. His first wife was Elizabeth Brittain (1748-1782). James and Elizabeth had three children including a son John born March 6, 1768 and a daughter Maria born on February 28, 1775. Records for the other child have been lost. His father-in- law William Brittain (1725-1804) was an outspoken Loyalist, though only the three youngest of his six sons were also Loyalists.Shenstone, Susan Burgess (2000), So Obstinately Loyal, James Moody, 1744-1809, (McGill-Queen's University Press, Montreal). By 1777, James and his family were living on a 500-acre farm owned in his father's name, but for his use. On Sunday, March 28, 1777, a Patriot militia came to his house to arrest him because he refused to give up his allegiance to Britain and swear loyalty to the United States. Shots were fired, but he managed to escape. In April 1777, he joined the New Jersey Volunteers under the command of General Cortlandt Skinner. On 22 August 1777, his battalion fought in the Battle of Staten Island, losing 30 men.http://www.royalprovincial.com/military/rhist/njv/5njvhist.htm In 1780, Moody led several men to free eight Loyalist prisoners held in the Sussex County Courthouse in Newton, Sussex County, New Jersey. Moody freed the men and fled with them. Despite a pursuit lasting several days, Revolutionary forces failed to capture them.[http://www.newtonnj.net/Pages/sussexcourthse.htm Newton, NJ - The Sussex Court House He was captured in 1780 but managed to escape to New York City. After that, for a time, he was put into service intercepting rebel correspondence. A measure of his success was that George Washington, whose dispatches he successfully intercepted, referred to him as \\"that villain Moody\\" Fitzpatrick, John J. The Writings of George Washington, vol 23, p. 444 . Following a betrayed attempt to steal the papers of Congress, Moody escaped, but his younger brother John was captured on November 8, 1781 (along with Laurence Marr) and hanged for espionage on November 13. He was only 23. Moody, James (1783) Lieut. James Moody‚Äôs narrative of his exertions and sufferings in the cause of government, since the year 1776 (London). In late February 1782, Moody's wife Elizabeth was thrown by a horse and killed. He married his second wife, Jane Lynson, on March 21, 1782. He went to England that same year. Also that year, he published an account of his experiences during the American Revolution. Moody, James (1783) Lieut.

This paints a unique and gritty picture of how what was effectively the first American civil war played out at the personal level. While Moody described himself as reluctantly becoming a soldier, a 20th-century American study of spies and saboteurs on both sides of the conflict credited him with being the most remarkable agent of the war.

Synopsis Mildred is keen to ascertain whether or not her husband George has remembered their 27th wedding anniversary. Needless to say, he has not. When he finally remembers, he books a table at the restaurant where he first proposed to Mildred. But to his horror, he discovers on arrival that it has been turned into a greasy spoon caf√© run by Hells Angels style bikers. Mildred then decides that she and George will celebrate their 27th wedding anniversary in style at the plush, world famous London hotel - however unhappy George might be at the cost involved. But on arrival, George is mistaken for a ruthless hit-man by a shady businessman (Stratford Johns), who wants a rival eliminated. Reception Released shortly after the death of star Yootha Joyce (who died on 24 August 1980), the film was neither a commercial nor a critical success.

It was first published in American Review: A Whig Journal in April 1845. Plot The narrator eats a very large amount of Welsh rabbit, accompanied by 'brown stout', and then goes to bed for a night's sleep. However, he is soon awakened and taken to Doctor Ponnonner's home to witness the unwrapping of a mummy. They cut into the first sarcophagus, remove it and discover the mummy's name, Allamistakeo. The second and third sarcophagi are removed to reveal the body, placed in a papyrus sheath, covered in plaster and decorated with painting and gold gilt. After removing this, they examine the body. They find it to be in exceptionally good condition, although it does not seem to have been embalmed in the normal way as the skin is red and there are no incisions. The doctor lays out instruments for the dissection, but the men suggest using electricity on the mummy and they begin preparations for this at once. The amount of electricity causes the mummy to awaken and condemn the men for their abuse. The men make their apologies to Allamistakeo, explain to him why they dissect mummies and the scientific importance of it. Satisfied with the explanation and their apologies Allamistakeo shakes hands with the men, who then proceed to patch up the damage caused by their incisions. They gather up proper clothes for Allamistakeo and sit down for cigars and wine. Allamistakeo explains how he came to be a mummy ‚Äì ancient Egyptians had a significantly longer life span than modern men, about one thousand years. They were also able to be embalmed ‚Äì this process arrested the bodily functions allowing them to sleep through hundreds of years only to rise and go on with their lives centuries later. Allamistakeo again chastises the men for their ignorance of Egyptian history. He then explains that throughout time man has always been monotheistic ‚Äì the pagan gods were symbols of the various aspects of the one true god. The men ask him, as he is over five thousand years old, if he knows anything about how the universe was created ten thousand years ago. Allamistakeo responds that no one during his time entertained the fantasy that the universe was ever created, but that it always existed, although, some believed that humans were created by spontaneous generation in a polygenic manner in different places. Finally, one of the men asks if the mummy was familiar with \\"the manufacture of either Ponnonner's lozenges or Brandreth's pills\\". To this Allamistakeo has to accept defeat and, in triumph, the men disperse. The narrator, having gone home and gone back to bed (or dreamt that he has done so), awakes the following morning, decides that he is unhappy with his own time and circumstances, and resolves to go to Ponnoner's to get embalmed for a couple hundred years. Publication history In January 1845, Columbian Magazine listed \\"Some Words with a Mummy\\" as scheduled for publication; Poe likely pulled the article when he was offered more money for it elsewhere.Thomas, Dwight & David K. Jackson. The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe, 1809‚Äì1849. Boston: G. K. Hall & Co., 1987: 484. It was ultimately published in the April 1845 edition of the American Review,Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 224. which also included Poe's revised poems \\"The Valley of Unrest\\" and \\"The City in the Sea\\".Thomas, Dwight & David K. Jackson. The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe, 1809‚Äì1849. Boston: G. K. Hall & Co., 1987: 522. The story was republished without changes shortly after in the November 1, 1845, issue of the Broadway Journal. Analysis  This story is a satire of two things. First the popular interest in Egyptology and mummies during the time that this story was written. Secondly the prevailing thought that in the West humanity had reached the height of civilization and knowledge due to the scientific and industrial revolutions. = Satire of Egyptmania = Poe is clearly poking fun at Egyptmania in this story. In the story a group of men gather together in the middle of the night to examine a mummy for the sake of \\"scientific discovery\\". During their examination they act like a group of children that just got a new toy. They poke and prod the mummy just to see what happens, this is evident when they decide to use electricity. The fact that this is going on at the Doctor's private residence and is attended by his friends only, even though they do not have any kind of medical expertise denotes this fact. Although it seems, in modern times, counterproductive to conduct a serious scientific examination in a party like atmosphere, this was commonly done at the time, a fact that Poe is ridiculing here. The mummy is also a method of ridicule here, right down to its name, Allamistakeo. Unlike serious mummy horror stories, the mummy is not scary, and the characters do not react to it as such. It is another device that Poe uses to censure the reader. Upon its resurrection, the mummy chastises the men for their abuse of himself and mummies in general. =Satire of science and knowledge = In their discussion with Allamistakeo, the men attempt to exalt their time as one of unprecedented knowledge and technology. Again and again, Allamistakeo is able to prove that the technology in his time was not inferior, and often superior, to the modern equivalents. The narrator, who at first is presented as an intelligent, educated man, is later revealed to be completely ignorant. He asks Allamistakeo a series of questions intended to prove that modern technology is superior and each time he asks questions that, ultimately, support Allamistakeo's argument. Even when one of the men tries to stop him and suggests that he consult historical texts before asking his questions, he continues. When the man mentions Ptolemy, the narrator's response is \\"whoever Ptolemy is\\". In the end, the only reason the men can consider themselves the victors of the debate comes down to cough drops. Adaptations The story was adapted as a one-act opera, Allamistakeo, by Giulio Viozzi in 1954.

He later became a solo artist, but was not commercially successful and died in 1988. Life and career During the late 1970s, he was lead singer in a locally successful pub band called \\"The B-52s\\", who later changed their name to \\"The Puritans\\" on discovering the existence of the similarly named US band. Failure to land a recording contract meant the band's dissolution but shortly after he was called to join as singer in a new wave band called The Civilians, comprised by Paul Simon (ex Neo and Radio Stars, now with Ajanta Music) on drums, Mark Scholfield on guitar and Michael French on bass. The band only released two singles: Made For Television/I See My Friends (Arista, November 1979) and without Herion or Simon and featuring Michael French on vocals In America/In Search Of Pleasure (Secret, September 1980). After that, the band broke up (Later, Scholfield and French formed Academy One).

H. erectus is a diurnal species with an approximate length of and lifespan of one to four years. The H. erectus species can be found in myriad colors, from greys and blacks to reds, greens, and oranges. The lined seahorse lives in the western Atlantic Ocean as far north as Canada and as far south as the Caribbean, Mexico, and Venezuela. It swims in an erect position and uses its dorsal and pectoral fins for guidance while swimming. Lined seahorses feed mainly on minute crustaceans and brine shrimp, which they suck in through their snout. They are able to suck their prey by creating a current of water leading directly into its snout. Since seahorses are weak swimmers, they must ambush their prey by blending into their surroundings, which they do rather easily. The lined seahorse's eyes can move independently of one another, allowing it to effectively scan its surroundings. The species is sexually dimorphic and it is easy to distinguish between a male and female lined seahorse. The males are larger and also have longer tails. The lined seahorse is monogamous and performs ritual dances every morning to reestablish the bond with its mate. In addition, they create clicking sounds while embracing their partner. This action occurs when they initially find their mate. The intensity of their bond is also conveyed in how they handle the death of their partner: If either the male or female should die, the mate does not automatically replace the deceased mate with a new one. Often, it fails to find a new mate in its short lifespan. Like with other seahorses, the male lined seahorse is the caregiver. During intercourse, the female sprays her eggs into the male's brood pouch where the eggs will incubate for 20‚Äì21 days. When the juveniles are ready to hatch, the male attaches its tail to a stationary structure and begins to arch its back, back and forth, releasing the juveniles into the water column. The juveniles are approximately 11 mm at birth. They quickly begin to learn and mimic the behavior of its parent. Courtship between the male and female parents begin immediately after birth. The habitat of the lined seahorse is diminishing due to coastal growth and pollution, which ultimately is the cause of the decreasing population. The lined seahorse is also used as Chinese medicine and is common in the aquarium trade, contributing to its \\"vulnerable\\" status.  Description  This image shows the bony structure of the lined seahorse. The lined seahorse was first named Hippocampus Erectus by George Perry in 1810. \\"Hippocampus\\" translates into \\"horse or sea monster\\" in ancient Greek. The lined seahorse is a diurnal species that ranges in length from 12 cm to 17 cm; the maximum length reported for the species is 19 cm. The seahorse is sexually dimorphic, meaning there are distinct differences in appearances of males and females; most notably the brood pouch located on the male's abdomen which it utilized in reproduction. Males are also slightly larger in size and have longer prehensile tails than the females. In the wild, the lined seahorse has a lifespan of one to four years; however, in captivity their lifespan usually reaches the full four years. Four years is the maximum age reported for the species. They have a broad color spectrum, ranging from black, grey, brown, and green, to orange, red, and yellow. They tend to be paler on their front side. However, their colors change due to altercations in their environment, diet, anxiety or stress level, and/or mood. The lined seahorse is brawny and upright in appearance. They have an armor-like body composed of approximately fifty bony plates. Together these bony plates form the outer skeleton of the species. It is common for the species to have white lines outlining the neck area‚Äîhence its common name, \\"lined seahorse\\"‚Äîand for tiny white dots to be present on the tail. The prehensile tail consists of numerous rings and the first, third, fifth, seventh, and eleventh may protrude farther outward than the remaining. The prehensile tail following the bony plates is utilized by the seahorse to grasp onto its environment composed of seaweed and coral. The tail curls forward and is seldom aligned. When a lined seahorse is very young (two weeks to four weeks), the tail is extremely limber. The snout length is approximately half the head length of the lined seahorse. The cheek spines, located diagonally down from the eye on either side may be single or double. In total, the lined seahorse has eleven trunk rings, 34‚Äì39 tail rings, 16‚Äì20 dorsal fin rays, and 14‚Äì18 pectoral fin rays. The pectoral fin is level with the eye on each back side of the lined seahorse's head. The dorsal fin is located on the back of the skeleton and is level with the stomach‚Äìchest area. Female dorsal fins are slightly larger than the male's and are located lower on the back. The eyes of the lined seahorse can concentrate together, or they can operate independently of one another. The lined seahorse may be considered sexually mature as early as four months; however, it is typically about eight months. The minimum size of a sexually mature lined seahorse is 5.6 cm.  Habitat and distribution  The lined seahorse range spans from the northern point of Nova Scotia, Canada, to the southern area of Venezuela in South America. They can be found on the east coast of America in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and North Carolina, as well as in the waters surrounding Mexico and the Caribbean. Species found in Brazil seem to be of a different species; however, more research is needed to determine this proposal. The lined seahorse is native to the following locations: Nova Scotia, Canada, United States, Bermuda, Cuba, Mexico (Veracruz, Yucat√°n), Haiti, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, and Venezuela. It has also been recorded from the Azores but it is not clear that a population has become established in the waters around that archipelago. alt=Photograph The species is found in depths of water up to seventy-three meters. Adults can be found swimming freely in the water column or attached to a stationary object. Juveniles usually swim near the surface. The habitat of the lined seahorse consists of marine vegetation, such as suspended Sargassum, seagrass, sponges, and mangroves. Depending on the season, the species can be found in shallow waters or deep waters along beaches, oyster beds, and banks covered in vegetation, as well as in bays or salt marshes. Lined seahorses can often be found with their tails wrapped around crab pots as well. In the winter, the seahorses are more prominent in deeper waters, versus warmer months, where they are usually found in shallow waters attached to vegetation. The temperature in which the H. erectus dwells varies with the different latitudes. Temperature has an effect on gonad development, brood size, and juvenile development and survival. Many lined seahorses experience temperature fluctuations during the daily tide cycles, the different seasons of each year, and due to precipitation or runoff. Adults have the ability to migrate to deeper waters during cold seasons. A study showed that the highest survival and growth rate of juveniles occurred at 28 to 29 degrees Celsius in captivity. In addition to temperature, there is also a large range of salinity concentration depending on the location that affect the species. The most common salinity is 25 to 35 ppt. In captivity, the species is most commonly kept at 35 ppt. The H. erectus is the only species of seahorse native to the Chesapeake Bay.  Diet  The lined seahorse utilizes its elongated snout in order to consume its prey, consisting primarily of minute crustaceans, mollusks, and zooplankton. Unfortunately, some captive parental males have been known to cannibalize small number of its own fry, or juveniles, following its release into natural habitat. In order to ambush its prey, the seahorse employs color changes to camouflage itself with its surrounding environment, locates the prey, and then jerks its head upward, forcing the prey in the right position to be sucked in through its tubular snout. The lined seahorse is highly accurate, especially if its prey is within one inch from its snout. Overall, this process is quick and accurate. A growing lined seahorse may feed continuously for up to ten hours a day, engulfing approximately 3,600 baby brine shrimp.  Predators and parasites  The predators of the lined seahorse include crabs, rays, skates, seabirds, sharks, tuna, and dolphinfish. Although their camouflage tactics reduce their risk of becoming prey, their poor swimming abilities increase their likelihood of being consumed by their predators, especially large fish. There are many parasites and infections known to affect the lined seahorse, including ciliates (Uronemamarinum), nematodes, fungi, myxosporidian, and microsporidians (Glugea heraldi).  Behavior  A unique characteristic of the lined seahorse (and other species of seahorse) is their practice of monogamy: the male and female seahorses choose partners that they will continue to mate with for their lifetime. The monogamous characteristics of the lined seahorse include ritual dances with their partner that they perform every morning. These dances establish their permanent relationship as mates. If a male or female lined seahorse should lose their partner for any reason, it takes time before they replace their mate. The fins help guide and propel the seahorse. Lined seahorses are weak swimmers; they swim in an erect position. In comparison to their fins, the lined seahorse's body is too large, another reason why they are poor swimmers. They do not swim for long periods of time, nor do they travel far distances, unless they are migrating. The lined seahorse propels its body forward with its dorsal and pectoral fins, which they move rapidly back and forth. These fins are also utilized in directing their bodies throughout the water and beat twenty to thirty times per second, making them almost invisible at first glance. In addition to monogamy, the lined seahorse also cues into sound- making in the mating process. The seahorses have a crown-like bony crest called a coronet located on the backside of their head at the edge of the skull. Each coronet is unique to the organism, just as a fingerprint is unique to every human. The coronet resembles a star pattern and is attached rather loosely and has sharp edges. As the seahorse lifts its head, the edge of the skull slides beneath the coronet and out when the seahorse bows its head. As the skull's edge slides beneath and out from the coronet, a clicking sound is produced. Mating seahorses swim slowly together, alternating their clicking sounds, until they embrace one another. Once the male and female seahorse embrace, the sounds from both the male and female unify, becoming indistinguishable from one another. This action creates a louder, consecutive sound, further establishing their bond.  Reproduction  This image shows the prehensile tail utilized in reproduction by the male seahorse. Like all species of seahorses, the lined seahorse reproduces sexually, laying eggs every season. In addition, the male is the parent that looks after the newborn seahorses. The reproduction process begins at the initiation of the courtship process. Courtship extends for a couple of days and during this process, both the male and female may change to a pale color. The male enlarges his pouch to indicate his desire to pursue the female. Once they are established as monogamous mates though dances and clicking sounds, intercourse takes place. During intercourse, the female sprays her eggs into the males pouch, which is called a \\"brood pouch\\", where they are fertilized and sealed. Females clutch size can be equal to or greater than one thousand and the males' brood size can range from 97 to 1,552 eggs. The number of eggs the female produces varies depending on the size of the seahorse. Six hundred and fifty eggs can be carried by a single male at one time. The eggs are 1.5 mm in diameter. When the eggs are being incubated within the male's pouch, the embryos are provided oxygen via an extensive capillary system. Through this system, the sodium and calcium levels can be altered in order to maintain homeostasis within the pouch environment. When the embryos are approaching birth, the pouch environment is very similar to the seawater. The gestation period lasts for 20‚Äì21 days. When the time finally approaches, the male latches his prehensile tail onto a supportive object while he braces back and forth, until the developed seahorses escape from the pouch. The bracing continues until all seahorses have successfully escaped the pouch. However, unhatched seahorses that have died will create a gas within the male's pouch. Soon after, the male seahorse inevitably floats to the surface, only to become easy prey in the marine food chain. Juveniles are approximately 11 mm at birth for three days and are considered embryos until they are capable of swimming on their own. Juveniles do not reach maximum size until they are 8‚Äì10 months of age. It is estimated by scientists that only about two juveniles grow up to be adults out of the hundreds that are hatched. In captivity, the species maintained a vertical growth rate of 0.55 mm a day for 100 days. Male juveniles develop pouches when they are 5‚Äì7 months old. The juvenile seahorses quickly develop the characteristic of the adult lined seahorse. After birth, courtship begins once again. Breeding occurs in the months of May through October in the Chesapeake Bay. July is when the lined seahorse population is the greatest in Florida.  Aquarium life  The minimum habitat requirements for captive lined seahorses consist of a tank 18 inches vertical in height and 20 to 25 gallons for a pair, 30 to 40 gallons for two pairs. The tank should be kept at a constant temperature between 22 and 25 degrees Celsius (72 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit). The ph value should remain between 8.1 and 8.4 and the specific gravity between 1.020 and 1.025.In this front view of the lined seahorse, the eyes can be seen; they can move independently of one another. The lined seahorse is an easy going species and will not be a threat to other fish that could possibly be in an aquarium. The seahorse thrives in an environment with objects it can hide around and attach its tail to. The H. erectus species should be fed multiple times throughout the day, rather than less amount of larger meals. In captivity, the lined seahorse is often fed live or frozen nauplius or Mysis shrimp, grass shrimp, adult brine shrimp, gammarids and caprellid amphipods, krill fish fry, and frozen krill.  Obstacles  The lined seahorse species was listed as vulnerable since 1996 and was listed as vulnerable in the 2003 IUCN assessment, indicating no significant improvements in protective factors. Due to loss or harm to their habitat by pollution and coastal development, accidental catch, or by purposeful catch, the lined seahorse's population is starting to dwindle, by values of at least thirty percent, probably since 1996 when changes in its population size were noted. The H. erectus is a very common species of the aquarium trade, which also affects the population remaining in the wild, though the vast majority for sale in the aquarium trade are captive-reared. The lined seahorse is also used for ornamental decoration and for Chinese medicine. Despite being a popular seahorse for aquarium trade and Chinese medicine, it is only suspected that the species could be a potential candidate for commercial aquaculture. If successful, this could positively affect the population of the lined seahorse.

It is classified as a Vulnerable species by the IUCN. Description The spiny seahorse is a small fish that can reach a maximum length of 15‚Äì17 cm. The body is slender, elongated and completely covered with thorns. These are sharp with dark tips, and uniformly sized on the prehensile tail. The trunk has long thorns which continue until the coronet, which has 4-5. The head is also provided with numerous spines especially on the forehead, the base of the cheeks, the nose and above the eyes. The snout is very long and tapered. Body coloration is highly variable to match surroundings and goes from grey to cream, and from bright yellow, to green or red and even brownish. It can be plain or with different pattern on the side or/and on the backside. The snout is generally striped with one or more thin white lines. Distribution and habitat Spiny seahorse from East Timor The spiny seahorse is relatively rare but widespread throughout the Indo-Pacific. In Australia it has been reported from the south of Ashmore Reef, Timor Sea, the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, and in Port Stephens, New South Wales. It is also found at Bali, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia and Japan. The species favours relatively deep waters (10‚Äì95 m) and is usually found below 15 m depths. This species is found on a variety of substrates including sponges, weedy rocky reefs, soft corals but mainly on seagrass beds. (, ) Biology The spiny seahorse has a carnivorous diet and feeds on small crustaceans and other planktonic organisms. It is ovoviviparous and the female uses an ovipositor to transfer her eggs into an enclosed pouch under the abdomen of the male. It is the male who broods the eggs in its ventral brood pouch. The latter includes villi rich in capillaries that surround each fertilized egg creating a sort of placenta supplying the embryos. The male fertilizes the eggs inside the pouch and provides physical protection for them as they develop. He also osmoregulates, aerates the embryos, and may provide some nourishment until the offspring are born. When fully grown, pups will be expelled from the pocket and evolve in complete autonomy. Conservation H. histrix is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. Populations are thought to have declined by more than 30% over the last 10-15 years. It is subject both to targeted exploitation for use in traditional medicine and the aquarium trade, and to population losses from bycatch in the shrimp fishery. Inshore sea-grass habitats frequented by the species are also in decline. Like all seahorses, it is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), meaning that it is on the list of species the trade of which must be controlled to ensure their survival. As most seahorses enter trade as bycatch, imposing export quotas would achieve next to nothing for wild populations. Decreases in population sizes are likely due to exploitation for international trade, and to bycatch and habitat destruction. Major threats to seagrass habitats include eutrophication, sedimentation, coastal construction, dredging and invasive species and these threats result in decline in and fragmentation of seagrass habitats It is reasonable to expect that all of these threats will continue into the future. Even excluding the trade demand for this species, it is known to often be bycatch in non-selective fisheries, for example, fish and shrimp trawls which occurs throughout the range of the species and leads to the degradation of the habitat for those seahorses. Shrimp trawls are a major concern to the Hippocampus histrix species. Trade is supplied by catching the species directly but also as bycatch in other non-selective fisheries such as shrimp trawls. The trade of the thorny seahorses is reported throughout the range of the species. It had been reported in international trade since the mid 1990s and to this day fishers and traders report declines in seahorse availability. The species is one of the six most common internationally traded species of seahorse that is reported to CITIES. However, it's common is often used as a label for any spiny seahorse from the Indo-Pacific, which means it could contain specimens of other species as well. It is not often collected for the aquarium trade business because it lives in moderately deep waters, but may be used more often dried and sold for the medicine trade or as antiques/decoration. Its spines are make it undesirable for the medicine trade.

Scholarship Kessler's most celebrated article, Contracts of Adhesion‚ÄîSome Thoughts About Freedom of Contract,43 629 (1943). elaborates the concept of \\"contrat d'adh√©sion\\" which originated in French civil law at the end of the 19th century and was introduced in American jurisprudence in a 1919 Harvard Law Review article by Edwin Patterson.The Delivery of a Life-Insurance Policy, 33 198 The phrase \\"contract of adhesion\\" describes a contract between parties of greatly unequal bargaining power, such that the dominant party could impose a \\"take it or leave it\\" demand on the weaker party. He argued that in such situations Eighteenth or Nineteenth Century concepts of freedom of contract were unrealistic and should be discarded. Kessler saw such contracts as mocking freedom of contract, making it \\"a one-sided privilege,‚Äù in which the historical evolution of the law from status to contract was reversed‚Äîa movement \\"greatly facilitated by the fact that the belief in freedom of contract has remained one of the firmest axioms in the whole fabric of the social philosophy of our culture.‚ÄùContracts of Adhesion (1943) 43 at 640-41. Kessler described himself as a Legal Realist and also wrote on that doctrine.The Heyday of Legal Realism, 1928-1954 in History of Business Law at Yale. In his article, Natural Law, Justice and Democracy‚ÄîSome Reflections on Three Types of Thinking About Law and Justice, Kessler maintained that the task of legal realism was \\"constantly testing out the desirability, efficiency and fairness of inherited legal rules and institutions in terms of the present needs of society.\\"Friedrich Kessler, Natural Law, Justice and Democracy‚ÄîSome Reflections on Three Types of Thinking About Law and Justice, 19 32, 52 (1944). He argued also, however, that we should not \\"overestimate conscious at the expense of unconscious processes.\\"Id. at 60.

In connection with the acquisition of Stream, the company completed a private stock sale to Ares Management for $150 million and a tender offer for most of the publicly held shares of Stream, except those held by the founders of Global BPO Services. On October 1, 2009, Stream Global Services, Inc. acquired e-Telecare in a stock for stock merger valued at approximately $225 million. e-Telecare brought over 10,000 employees and substantial operations in the Philippines. In connection with the merger, the company raised $200 million in a public debt offering led by Goldman Sachs. The combined company provided customer management and information management products. In 2010 Chairman and CEO R. Scott Murray resigned to return to the investment industry. On June 1, 2011, Trillium Capital LLC, owned by R. Scott Murray, the founder and former CEO of Stream, made an offer to acquire 100% of Stream for $4.65 per share plus assumption of debt. The non-binding proposal also included a provision to extend the exercisability of the public warrants by two years that would otherwise expire in October 2011. The transaction had a total enterprise value of approximately $575 million. The offer was subsequently turned down by the private equity shareholders, who were represented by Ares Capital, Providence Equity Partners and Ayala Corporation. Trillium Capital LLC and R Scott Murray agreed to sell its ownership back to the company. Stream was subsequently taken private in 2012 by the three private equity owners at the same price that Trillium Capital sold its shares to the company. Convergys acquisition  On January 6, 2014, Convergys and Stream announced entry into a definitive merger. Under the agreement, Convergys will acquire Stream for a total enterprise value of $820 Million in cash.http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140106006784/en/Convergys- Acquire-Stream-820-Million#.Usw5Mjs_vSk  References  Business process outsourcing companies ","title":"Stream Global Services"},{"id":"20635129","text":"Succinella oblonga is a species of air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Succineidae.

History The City of DeLand began developing a civilian airport in the 1920s, with the first asphalt runway laid ‚Äò‚Äôc.‚Äô‚Äô 1936. In 1942, the City of DeLand donated the airport facility to the United States Navy and it was renamed Naval Air Station DeLand on 17 November. The airfield officially opened after several months of additional land acquisition and extensive military building construction. Captain Tom Turner, the air station's first commanding officer, officiated. A Navy band had not yet been formed for the air station, so the DeLand High School band played for the opening of the base. Following still more extensive military construction, NAS DeLand's primary focus became advanced training for Navy flight crews in land- based Lockheed PBO-1 Hudson, Lockheed PV-1 Ventura and Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer patrol bombers, as well as carrier-based Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers. The first aircraft to arrive at NAS DeLand were the Hudsons,http://www.microworks.net/pacific/aviation/PBO_Hudson.htm which had been transferred from Patrol Squadron 82 (VP-82) at NAS Quonset Point, Rhode Island. In addition to Quonset Point, VP-82 had previously employed these aircraft in training operations at NAS Norfolk, Virginia and detachment operations at Naval Air Station Argentia, Newfoundland and NAS Trinidad, British West Indies. This included the sinking by VP-82 of the , the first U-boat sinking attributed to U.S. forces in World War II. These aircraft subsequently served as the training nucleus for PV-1 Ventura operational training units at both NAS DeLand and nearby Naval Air Station Sanford until greater numbers of newer PV-1s became available. PB4Y-2 Privateer training operations followed in 1943, with the first examples reaching operational Fleet squadrons in 1944http://www.warbirdalley.com/pb4y2.htm Between PBO-1, PV-1 and PB4Y-2 training operations, several of the U.S. Navy's former and present day maritime patrol and reconnaissance (VP) squadrons operating the Lockheed P-3 Orion and Boeing P-8 Poseidon trace their squadron lineage to being established at NAS DeLand with these earlier aircraft during World War II. When the SBD Dauntless dive bombers began to arrive, along with pilots and crew members, Ventura training was scaled back. Samuel Hynes, who in later life was a professor at Yale University, the author of numerous books, and a participant in documentary films made by Ken Burns, was a Marine pilot in World War II. He recounts learning to fly Dauntless dive bombers at DeLand: > The planes on the flight line were old; they had come from fleet duty . . . > Like the planes, our instructors were combat veterans . . . who had been to > the Pacific theater, had seen the islands, and Japanese planes in the air, > had dropped real bombs on real enemy targets, and had been shot at . . . > [they showed us how] to dive an airplane straight toward the earth, and to > drop a bomb while diving. This is the most unnatural action possible in a > plane, a kind of defiance of all life-preserving instincts . . . In Florida > in 1944 one dive-bomber pilot died every day . . . [Off duty, when visiting > Daytona Beach, there] seemed to be no laws that governed the behavior of > Marine pilots . . . the police might scold, but they never arrested > us.Hynes, Samuel (1988). Flights of Passage. Annapolis: Naval Institute > Press, pp.92-95. In 1944, training operations in the Grumman F6F Hellcat carrier-based fighter also commenced at NAS DeLand, as well as an Advanced Carrier Navigation school for replacement pilots.http://www.museumoffloridahistory.com/exhibits/permanent/wwii/sites.cfm?PR_ID=76 Because support functions often exceeded the capability of the air station's uniformed officers, sailors and Marines, many of DeLand's citizens were also employed at the base in administrative and support roles and were paid wages that were a significant improvement over those the community had seen during the recently concluded Great Depression. =Military Training and Exercises= A Grumman F-14 Tomcat on a platform with the Chief Master at Arms house in the background. The house is now the location of the DeLand Naval Air Station Museum. Nine Mile Point on Lake George was also under NAS DeLand's control and was used as a practice bombing site with a Navy Consolidated PBY Catalina seaplane stationed nearby in the event of an aircraft mishap on the lake. The Lake George site is still used today as part of the Navy's Pinecastle Electronic Warfare and Bombing Rangehttp://www.militarybases.us/navy/pine- castle-bombing-range/ complex in the Ocala National Forest that is managed by NAS Jacksonville. NAS DeLand also maintained a duty watch of two sailors to patrol Lake Woodruff in the event of any nearby naval aircraft mishaps. NAS DeLand also had responsibility for Navy Outlying Field New Smyrna Beach and bombing targets near Paisley, Hawkinsville, the Indian River Lagoon, and east of Lake Dias near DeLeon Springs. These facilities were also used by aircraft based at Naval Air Station Daytona Beach and NAS Sanford. The airfield at New Smyrna Beach refueled and rearmed aircraft practicing landings at Outlying Field Spruce Creek and conducting target practice over the Atlantic Ocean. These aircraft occasionally carried 500 pound bombs when they were over the ocean in the event any German U-boats were spotted. =Decommissioning= Following the end of World War II, the base closed as an active naval installation on 15 March 1946. Its control tower also closed and ownership of the air station returned to the City of DeLand as an uncontrolled civilian airport. After the city resumed control of the field, it became DeLand Municipal Airport, a role it continues to this day. =Stetson University College of Law= From 1946 to 1953, the base was also home to Stetson University College of Law.Swygert and Vause, Florida's First Law School: A History of Stetson University College of Law, p. 203 The law school was relocated to Gulfport (St. Petersburg), Florida, in 1954.Swygert and Vause, p. 241 DeLand Naval Air Station Museum Another view of the F-14 with the museum in the background Located in the historic Chief Master at Arms House in DeLand, Florida, the DeLand Naval Air Station Museum was dedicated in 1995 and focuses on the history of Naval Air Station DeLand, U.S. Naval Aviation, and United States Navy history.

He was a deputy to the Polish parliament (Sejm) during the 1968 Polish political crisis and again during the Martial law in Poland. Biography Born in Warsaw in 1923, Reiff studied law at the University of Warsaw. After German invasion of Poland, he took part in the Polish resistance movement in World War II. He was a member of the right-leaning Konfederacja Narodu (Confederation of the Nation) underground organization and commanded one of the first units of the Uderzeniowe Bataliony Kadrowe (Cadre Strike Battalions). Later, he became a member of the Armia Krajowa (Home Army) by default as the Konfederacja Narodu merged with it, and fought against Nazi Germans near Navahrudak. As a member of Armia Krajowa, he was arrested by the Soviet NKVD, and imprisoned for two years (1944-1946). In 1946 after the Soviet liberation, he started work as a publicist, becoming involved with the pro-communist, but also pro-Catholic faction in the Party. First, he worked in Dzi≈õ i Jutro newspaper, and from 1950 to 1953 he was a chief editor of S≈Çowo Powszechne daily and publishing arm of the secular Catholic Polish government sponsored PAX Association, during the darkest years of Stalinism in Poland. In 1976, he became PAX deputy director, and in 1979, its full director. He adopted a position supportive of Solidarity, an independent Polish trade union. A Catholic intellectual, he was a committed critic of Polish government policies, and he once urged a coalition to be formed of leaders from Solidarity, the Polish United Workers' Party, and the Catholic Church, advocating \\"the establishment of a corporatist arrangement between major political actors as the only way to stabilize Poland's political situation and resolve the deepening economic crisis.\\" From 1965 to 1969 and from 1980 to 1985 he was a deputy to the Polish parliament (Sejm). On the night of December 12/13, 1981, martial law was proclaimed in Poland. In an effort to try to make the implementation of martial law appear legal, the Polish military ordered the Polish Council of State‚Äîa collective presidency‚Äîto approve it by a formal vote. Reiff was the only member of the Council of State to vote against the measure, and he lost his position in the Council the following year. In January 1982, he was removed from his leadership of PAX by several members of the organization. Some observers were reported to have concluded that this was because those members wanted to change the direction of PAX towards a pro-government stance similar to what it held in the 1950s, though one source contends that the removal was engineered by the leadership of the Polish government in an effort to re-assert its control over the group. From 1980 to 1985, he was once again a Sejm deputy. With the coming fall of communism in Poland, from 1989 to 1991 he was a member of the Solidarity Citizens' Committee, and joined the Democratic Union party. He was a chairman of the Association of Sybiraks (Polish exiles to Siberia). Between 1939 and 1941, and 1944 and 1953, around 1.8 million Poles were deported to the Russian region of Siberia, resulting in 500 000 deaths. Ostensibly, the deportations occurred to those who had resisted the Soviet takeover of eastern Poland in 1939, assisted the Nazis during the Second World War, and who were members of the Polish Home Army‚Äîan anti-Communist resistance group during the war. A number of human rights groups in Poland protesting against the deportations that occurred, formed the Siberian Union in 1988 with Reiff as its leader. He died on 9 December 2007 in Warsaw.

History; Chapter I, Formation, Early Settlements; \\"Lamar County, Mississippi Genealogy and History;\\" Geoghehan, Kemp and Wells Robert Baylor, a Revolutionary War veteran and contractor from Virginia, was hired by LeNoir to construct a plantation home on the banks of the Pearl River. Baylor traveled to Mississippi with slaves owned by LeNoir. Baylor first lived in a one-room house, now known as the Newsom Home. The LeNoir House was completed in 1818. A family cemetery is located in the heart of what is now Morgantown, and a slave cemetery was located nearby. Following the Civil War other families moved into the area. By 1910, most members of the LeNoir family had relocated elsewhere. In the early 1890s, James Austin \\"Jim\\" Morgan and his wife Samantha (n√©e Dunaway), moved to the local area, becoming the first Morgans to settle in the community. They established the first store in the local community in 1896. Two years later they donated the timber for the construction of the community's first school. James Austin Morgan's son, B. J. Morgan, was appointed to serve as the community's first postmaster. The railroad made its way through the community soon after the turn of the 20th century. By 1914 construction began on a local train depot. When it was nearing completion, railroad officials were discussing a name for the community.

The case of the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator on a closed Riemannian manifold has been most intensively studied, although other Laplace operators in differential geometry have also been examined. The field concerns itself with two kinds of questions: direct problems and inverse problems. Inverse problems seek to identify features of the geometry from information about the eigenvalues of the Laplacian. One of the earliest results of this kind was due to Hermann Weyl who used David Hilbert's theory of integral equation in 1911 to show that the volume of a bounded domain in Euclidean space can be determined from the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues for the Dirichlet boundary value problem of the Laplace operator. This question is usually expressed as \\"Can one hear the shape of a drum?\\", the popular phrase due to Mark Kac. A refinement of Weyl's asymptotic formula obtained by Pleijel and Minakshisundaram produces a series of local spectral invariants involving covariant differentiations of the curvature tensor, which can be used to establish spectral rigidity for a special class of manifolds. However as the example given by John Milnor tells us, the information of eigenvalues is not enough to determine the isometry class of a manifold (see isospectral). A general and systematic method due to Toshikazu Sunada gave rise to a veritable cottage industry of such examples which clarifies the phenomenon of isospectral manifolds. Direct problems attempt to infer the behavior of the eigenvalues of a Riemannian manifold from knowledge of the geometry. The solutions to direct problems are typified by the Cheeger inequality which gives a relation between the first positive eigenvalue and an isoperimetric constant (the Cheeger constant). Many versions of the inequality have been established since Cheeger's work (by R. Brooks and P. Buser for instance). See also *Isospectral *Hearing the shape of a drum  References  * . * .

Herbert then started to direct in 1930 with on the Air, In Town Tonight, Soft Lights and Sweet Music, Calling all Stars, It's a Grand Old World, Leave it to Me, He's Got Everything, In 1938, I've Got a Horse, Around the Town, Home from Home and in 1939, All at Sea. By this time he was the production supervisor at Beaconsfield Studios. Herbert was a great one for deleting his name from the credits. As Executive in charge of Production, many films he controlled while at Denham Studios went by uncredited, such as Henry V and Hamlet both with Laurence Olivier. There are many others not all mentioned here. In 1956 Herbert was called by Sidney Box who asked if he would make a movie about the new Rock 'n' Roll. What came out of this was The Tommy Steele Story, with great music by Lionel Bart ‚Äì his first movie score. Herbert followed up with _6.5 Special (1958)_with all the pop stars of the period. His last film was Too Young to Love (1960) with Thomas Mitchell in 1960. He was an assistant director on five films between 1930 and 1933, before the first 13 for which he was director (the last of them in 1940).

Federal Information Architecture Initiatives. Federal Aviation Administration, February 1998. Enterprise architecture planning (EAP) in enterprise architecture is the planning process of defining architectures for the use of information in support of the business and the plan for implementing those architectures.The Chief Information Officers Council (1999). Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework Version 1.1 September 1999.  Overview  One of the earlier professional practitioners in the field of system architecture Steven H. Spewak in 1992 defined Enterprise Architecture Planning (EAP) as \\"the process of defining architectures for the use of information in support of the business and the plan for implementing those architectures.\\"Steven Spewak and S. C. Hill (1992) Enterprise Architecture Planning: Developing a Blueprint for Data, Applications, and Technology. Boston, QED Pub. Group. p. 1 Spewak‚Äôs approach to EAP is similar to that taken by DOE in that the business mission is the primary driver. That is followed by the data required to satisfy the mission, followed by the applications that are built using that data, and finally by the technology to implement the applications. This hierarchy of activity is represented in the figure above, in which the layers are implemented in order, from top to bottom. Based on the Business Systems Planning (BSP) approach developed by John Zachman, EAP takes a data-centric approach to architecture planning to provide data quality, access to data, adaptability to changing requirements, data interoperability and sharing, and cost containment. This view counters the more traditional view that applications should be defined before data needs are determined or provided for.  EAP topics  = Zachman framework = EAP defines the blueprint for subsequent design and implementation and it places the planning/defining stages into a framework. It does not explain how to define the top two rows of the Zachman Framework in detail but for the sake of the planning exercise, abbreviates the analysis. The Zachman Framework provides the broad context for the description of the architecture layers, while EAP focuses on planning and managing the process of establishing the business alignment of the architectures. EAP is planning that focuses on the development of matrixes for comparing and analyzing data, applications, and technology. Most important, EAP produces an implementation plan. Within the Federal Enterprise Architecture, EAP will be completed segment enterprise by segment enterprise. The results of these efforts may be of Government wide value; therefore, as each segment completes EAP, the results will be published on the ArchitecturePlus web site. = EAP components = Enterprise Architecture Planning model consists of four levels: * Level 1 - getting started : This layer leads to producing an EAP workplan and stresses the necessity of high- level management commitment to support and resource the subsequent six components (or steps) of the process. It consists of Planning Initiation, which covers in general, decisions on which methodology to use, who should be involved, what other support is required, and what toolset will be used. * Level 2 - where we are today : This layer provides a baseline for defining the eventual architecture and the long-range migration plan. It consists of: ** Business process modeling, the compilation of a knowledge base about the business functions and the information used in conducting and supporting the various business processes, and ** Current Systems and Technology, the definition of current application systems and supporting technology platforms. * Level 3 - the vision of where we want to be : The arrows delineate the basic definition process flow: data architecture, applications architecture, and technology architecture. It consists of: ** Data Architecture - Definition of the major kinds of data needed to support the business. ** Applications Architecture - Definition of the major kinds of applications needed to manage that data and support the business functions. ** Technology Architecture - Definition of the technology platforms needed to support the applications that manage the data and support the business functions. * Level 4 - how we plan to get there : This consists of the Implementation / Migration Plans - Definition of the sequence for implementing applications, a schedule for implementation, a cost/benefit analysis, and a clear path for migration. = EAP methodology = The Enterprise Architecture Planning (EAP) methodology is beneficial to understanding the further definition of the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework at level IV. EAP is a how to approach for creating the top two rows of the Zachman Framework, Planner and Owner. The design of systems begins in the third row, outside the scope of EAP. EAP focuses on defining what data, applications, and technology architectures are appropriate for and support the overall enterprise. Exhibit 6 shows the seven components (or steps) of EAP for defining these architectures and the related migration plan. The seven components are in the shape of a wedding cake, with each layer representing a different focus of each major task (or step).  Criticism  The effectiveness of the EAP methodology have been questioned in the late 1980s and early 1990s: * Business Systems Planning (BSP), the conceptual predecessor of EAP, did not work successfully: \\"Given their great expense and time consumption, [...] findings seriously challenge the utility of the [BSP and similar] planning methodologies\\".Lederer, A.L., and Sethi, V. (1988). The Implementation of Strategic Information Systems Planning Methodologies. In: MIS Quarterly, vol. 12, no. 3, pp. 445-461.Goodhue, D.L., Quillard, J.A., and Rockart, J.F. (1988).

In: MIS Quarterly, vol. 16, no. 1, pp. 11-34. * Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) program based on the EAP methodology has largely failed: \\"Enterprise Architecture within the federal government hasn‚Äòt been working, and far more often than not hasn‚Äòt delivered useful results. Moreover, significant parts of the federal EA program have been complete and utter failures\\".\\"Why Doesn‚Äôt the Federal Enterprise Architecture Work?\\", Stanley B. Gaver, visited 19 May 2016. * Even Steven Spewak and Steven Hill (1992) admit that \\"the vast majority of enterprises that undertake Enterprise Architecture Planning are not successful\\" (page 19). * The historical analysis shows that the EAP methodology, as well as all other similar formal, documentation- oriented, step-by-step planning methodologies, never worked successfully in practice.Kotusev, Svyatoslav (2018) The Practice of Enterprise Architecture: A Modern Approach to Business and IT Alignment.

In 1868 she was engaged, briefly, to Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky,Schubertiade music who may have coded her name into works such as his First Piano Concerto and the Romeo and Juliet Fantasy-Overture. After her 1869 marriage to the Spanish baritone Mariano Padilla y Ramos, she was known as D√©sir√©e Art√¥t de Padilla or D√©sir√©e Art√¥t-Padilla.  Biography  =Family background= Marguerite-Jos√©phine-D√©sir√©e Montagney Art√¥t was the daughter of Jean D√©sir√© Montagney Art√¥t, a horn player at La Monnaie in BrusselsGreat singers and professor at the Brussels Conservatory. Her uncle was the violinist Alexandre Art√¥t (1815‚Äì1845). He had been born Alexandre Joseph (or Joseph-Alexandre) Montagney, but adopted the surname Art√¥t professionally, and the rest of his family followed suit. Another uncle was the Belgian portrait painter Charles Baugniet (1814‚Äì1886).Charles Baugnier site =Early career= She studied with Pauline Viardot and Francesco Lamperti in London and Paris. She appeared in concerts in Belgium, the Netherlands and on 19 June 1857 at a State Concert in England. Giacomo Meyerbeer engaged her for the Paris Op√©ra, where she made her debut on 5 February 1858 as Fid√®s in his Le proph√®te, to great success. She also sang the title role in a condensed version of Gounod‚Äôs Sapho. Hector Berlioz and others praised her singing in the Journal des D√©bats on 17 February. However, she abandoned the French repertoire and went to sing in Italy in 1859. She also sang in Berlin that year, at the opening of the Victoria Theatre with Lorini's Italian company. She was highly successful in The Barber of Seville, La Cenerentola, Il trovatore and other roles there. Art√¥t sang in London in 1859-60 and again in 1863 (at Her Majesty's Theatre), in La fille du r√©giment, La traviata, and Norma (as Adalgisa, with Th√©r√®se Tietjens in the title role).answers.com: Therese Tietjens In 1861, she was briefly engaged to the Welsh harpist John Thomas.Creighton‚Äôs collection She returned to England in 1864, where she sang at Covent Garden, and 1866, in Gounod's Faust and other roles. =Russia and Tchaikovsky= In 1868 she visited Russia with a touring Italian company that also include Roberto Stagno.John Warrack, Tchaikovsky. She captivated Moscow: at a reception for her at the home of Maria Begicheva, the hostess knelt before Art√¥t and kissed her hand.Alexander Poznansky, Tchaikovsky: The Quest for the Inner Man. (Maria Begicheva was the wife of the repertory director of the Moscow state theatres, and the mother, from her first marriage, of one of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's future lovers, Vladimir Shilovsky.) D√©sir√©e Art√¥t met Tchaikovsky briefly at a party at the Begichevs in the spring. He also visited her after her benefit performance, for which he wrote additional recitatives for a production of Daniel Auber's opera Le domino noir.SUTHERLAND AND BONYNGE---MYTH AND REALITY; a Year in the Life of the Legendary Couple, by Stephan von Cron They again met by chance at a musical party, where she expressed her surprise that he had not visited her more often during the autumn. He promised he would do so, but he did not intend to keep his promise, however Anton Rubinstein persuaded him to see her at the opera. She then started to send him invitations every day, and he became accustomed to visiting her every evening. He later described her to his brother Modest as possessing \\"exquisite gesture, grace of movement, and artistic poise\\". He had put aside his work on his symphonic poem Fatum in order to give her all his attention. It seems plausible that Tchaikovsky was more captivated in her as a singer and actor than as a romantic interest, and had difficulty in separating the artist from the person. Tchaikovsky dedicated his Romance in F minor for piano, Op. 5, to Art√¥t. By the end of the year, marriage was being considered. It has been said that this was Tchaikovsky's first serious attempt to conquer his homosexuality.Timothy F. Murpy, Reader‚Äôs Guide to Lesbian and Gay Studies Her mother, who was travelling with her, opposed the marriage. There were three reasons for this: a certain unnamed Armenian man who sat in the front seat at all Art√¥t's performances, and was in love with her himself, told her mother lies about Tchaikovsky's background and his financial status which, being a stranger to Russian customs, she had no reason to disbelieve; then there was Tchaikovsky's age - he was five years Art√¥t's junior; and finally, she may have heard rumours about Tchaikovsky's sexual practices. Tchaikovsky's father, on the other hand, supported his son's plans. Art√¥t herself was not prepared to abandon her career to support a struggling composer, and neither was Tchaikovsky prepared to become merely a prima donna's husband. Some of Tchaikovsky's friends, such as Nikolai Rubinstein, advised him against the marriage because being the husband of a foreign singing celebrity would mean he would have to forgo his own musical career. The matter was left undecided, and no formal announcement was made, but they planned to meet again in the summer of 1869 at her estate near Paris to finalise the question of their marriage. Then the opera company left to continue its tour in Warsaw. By the beginning of 1869, however, Tchaikovsky was having second thoughts. He wrote to his brother Anatoly that it was doubtful the marriage would ever take place. He wrote \\"... this affair is beginning to fall apart somewhat\\". Although she did not communicate this fact to Tchaikovsky, as the social conventions of the time would have demanded, Art√¥t also changed her mind. (One source claims it was her singing teacher Pauline Viardot who persuaded Art√¥t not to marry Tchaikovsky.Anne Eugenie Schoen Rene, America‚Äôs Musical Inheritance ‚Äì Memories and Reminiscences) On 15 September 1869, either in S√®vresGrove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed. (1954)Rupert Hughes, The Love Affairs of Great Musicians, Vol. 2 or Warsaw, Art√¥t married a member of her company, the Spanish baritone Mariano Padilla y Ramos. Padilla was seven years her junior, and he was someone she had previously ridiculed to Tchaikovsky. Nikolai Rubinstein was advised of the marriage by telegram, and he went to inform Tchaikovsky straight away. He was in the midst of a rehearsal for his opera The Voyevoda, and when he heard Rubinstein's news, he became quite upset, abandoned the rehearsal, and left immediately. Tchaikovsky got over the affair fairly quickly. When writing his Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor in 1874, he included in the slow movement the tune of a popular French song Il faut s‚Äôamuser et rire, which Art√¥t had in her repertoire. The flute solo that starts the movement may also be a reference to her.Classical Music on the Web The second subject of the first movement starts with the notes D flat-A (in German Des-A), which the musicologist David Brown argues is a musical cipher on Art√¥t's name, D√©sir√©e Art√¥t. The use of initials spelled out in musical pitches is a device often used by Robert Schumann (for example, in his Carnaval), and Tchaikovsky was a great admirer of Schumann's music.Steven Ledbetter, notes for Colorado Symphony Orchestra The sequence D flat-A is naturally resolved by a B flat, which, according to Brown, determined the overall key of the entire concerto, B flat minor, a very unusual key for a concerto or symphony.David Brown, Tchaikovsky, pp. 96-98 The famous opening theme of the first movement is written in the relative major key, D flat major (Des), and after being played twice, it never reappears (perhaps an echo of Art√¥t's sudden disappearance from his life). The theme is introduced by a descending minor key gesture (F-D flat-C-B flat) on the horns, which might be a reference to Art√¥t's father, a professor of horn, but is more likely a reference to the composer himself: he used the sequence E-C-B-A as his own signature in other works,Music Theory Online and the horn gesture is E-C-B-A transposed from A minor to B flat minor. There are other suggestions that Tchaikovsky coded his own name into the concerto, and Art√¥t's name into the symphonic poem Fatum, the Symphony No. 3, and the Romeo and Juliet Fantasy-Overture.Robert Gauldin, Tragic Love and Musical Memory He never revealed the program of Fatum, and later even destroyed the score (although it was reconstructed from the orchestral parts and published posthumously as Op. 77). The Art√¥t episode was very fresh in Tchaikovsky's mind at the time he wrote Romeo and Juliet. He could easily have drawn a parallel between his personal loss and the tragedy of Shakespeare's drama. Mily Balakirev praised Romeo and Juliet's love theme (written in D flat = Des) with an extraordinary choice of words: \\"... the second D flat tune is delightful ... It is full of tenderness and the sweetness of love ... When I play it I imagine you are lying naked in your bath and that the Art√¥t-Padilla herself is washing your stomach with hot lather from scented soap\\".Seen and Heard International It was Balakirev who had first suggested Tchaikovsky write a Romeo and Juliet piece, in May 1869 (or August). The work (in its first version) was completed on 29 November 1869, just two months after Art√¥t's marriage to Padilla.Fact Sheet: Romeo and Juliet On her December 1870 Moscow visit, Tchaikovsky went to hear her as Marguerite in Gounod's Faust. He was reported to have had tears streaming down his cheeks (although he was often moved to tears by music); they did not meet on this occasion. In 1875 she was again in Moscow, singing in Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots. Calling on Nikolai Rubinstein one day at the Conservatorium, Tchaikovsky and his friend Nikolay Kashkin were asked to wait because \\"a foreign lady\\" was with Rubinstein in his office. The foreign lady soon emerged, and it turned out to be D√©sir√©e Art√¥t. Both she and Tchaikovsky were so flustered that they exchanged no words, and she left hurriedly. Tchaikovsky burst out laughing, saying \\"And I thought I was in love with her!\\". In December 1887, she had a chance encounter with Tchaikovsky in Berlin, at a performance of Berlioz's Grande Messe des morts, and they were glad to renew their acquaintance, but there was no mention of past events. On 4 February 1888, Art√¥t met Tchaikovsky again in Berlin. Tchaikovsky spent a part of each of the five days he had there with her, and spent an evening with her on 7 February at 17 Landgrafstrasse, during which she asked him to write a romance for her.Tchaikovsky Research He wrote in his diary: \\"This evening is counted among the most agreeable recollections of my sojourn in Berlin. The personality and the art of this singer are as irresistibly bewitching as ever\\". In May he wrote to her, promising the song by August. During the summer, the composer's time was taken up with various major works, including the Hamlet overture-fantasia, which was completed on 19 October. By now, he had decided to write not one song for Art√¥t, but six, keeping in mind the present range of her voice. He chose untranslated French texts by three poets. The Six French Songs, Op. 65, were finished on 22 October, and the set was dedicated to D√©sir√©e Art√¥t-Padilla. He concluded his 29 October letter to her with the hope that she would like them and \\"... one is a little intimidated when one is composing for a singer one considers the greatest among the great\\". = Later career = After Art√¥t's marriage to Mariano Padilla y Ramos, she was often known as D√©sir√©e Art√¥t de Padilla or D√©sir√©e Art√¥t-Padilla. Art√¥t appeared with Padilla in Italian opera in Germany, Austria, Poland, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Russia, and Finland. She appeared in Moscow in 1868-70 and again in 1875-76, and in Saint Petersburg in 1871‚Äì72 and 1876‚Äì77.Tchaikovsky Research She had a tempestuous temperament and her onstage battles with Minnie Hauk in Moscow in the 1870s are well documented.Historic Opera Art√¥t retired in 1884, but on 22 March 1887 she and Padilla appeared in a scene from Don Giovanni in a celebration of the Emperor's birthday at the Imperial Palace in Berlin; it was also the centenary year of Don Giovanni. She became a singing teacher in Berlin until 1889, before moving to Paris. Her students included the contralto Rosa Olitzka and Berglioth Prom. She died in 1907 in Paris (or Berlin), just four months after her husband died. Art√¥t's and Padilla's daughter Lola Art√¥t de Padilla had a highly successful career as an operatic soprano, creating Vreli in Delius's A Village Romeo and Juliet.

From 1995 to 1997, Berry worked as director of government relations and as senior policy advisor at the Smithsonian Institution. = Department of the Interior = Berry was appointed Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, serving from 1997 to 2001. At the Interior Department, Berry improved credit union and continuing education options, oversaw the expansion of department programs to improve employees' work-life balance, and held town hall meetings with Interior employees and used their suggestions to upgrade a cafeteria and health center. These changes were partly funded through partnerships with federal employees, unions and other agencies to reduce costs for the department. Berry worked to create a complaint procedure for employees who experience discrimination because of their sexual orientation, to expand relocation benefits and counseling services to domestic partners of employees, to establish a liaison to gay and lesbian workers, and to eliminate discriminatory provisions of the National Park Service's law enforcement standards. He helped establish an office supply store for Interior employees, which he staffed with disabled workers. Berry oversaw one of the largest budgetary increases in the department's history. In 2000, Berry became director of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, where he worked with Interior Inspector General Earl Devaney to reconcile twenty years of financial records, improve management, and conserve wildlife habitat through public-private partnerships. Berry was appointed from October 1, 2005, to serve as director of the National Zoo, which had been found to have shortcomings in record keeping and maintenance. Berry created a strategic planning and modernization process for the zoo. This included a twenty-year capital plan, securing $35 million in funding to provide for fire protection, and beginning renovations to animal houses. The Berry Bastion, an Antarctic mountain, was named in his honor. = Office of Personnel Management = Berry greeting employees at OPM headquarters on his first day as agency director In 2008, Berry was mentioned as a possible nominee for U.S. Secretary of the Interior, a position obtained by Ken Salazar. President Barack Obama announced his intention to nominate Berry as director of the Office of Personnel Management on March 3, 2009, and did so on March 4. The nomination hearing before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on March 26, 2009, led to expectation of easy confirmation for Berry, despite opposition from conservative activists based on Berry's homosexuality. In the hearing Berry stated he supported any effective employee compensation system, but that the federal government had the obligation to give employees with comparable job performances similar pay and treatment. He pledged to preserve veterans preference and supplement it with training programs to prepare veterans for federal jobs, and promised reviews of proposals to improve the security clearance and hiring processes. Berry emphasized the importance for agencies to use all recruitment tools, citing relocation benefits that could keep agencies competitive with the private sector, and stated he would create a strategic plan and set performance goals for the Office of Personnel Management. Berry had stated support for benefits for same-sex partners of federal employees and a repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act. The Senate confirmed Berry on April 3, 2009, and he was sworn in April 13 as the first agency director in the Obama administration with all senior staff in place. The ceremonial swearing in on April 23 was attended by First Lady Michelle Obama. At the time, Berry was, according to the Human Rights Campaign, the highest-ranking openly gay official to serve in the executive branch in any U.S. administration. = U.S. Ambassador to Australia = In June 2013, President Obama nominated Berry to be the US ambassador to Australia, the first openly gay U.S. ambassador to a G-20 nation. On August 1, 2013, the United States Senate confirmed Berry by unanimous consent. Australian media coverage of Berry's appointment was overwhelmingly positive with a video he posted to the US Embassy website being described as the \\"friendliest introduction video in diplomatic history\\" while Berry himself was described as \\"modest\\", with an \\"impressive record\\". Federal News Radio in the US reported that, \\"more than 200 people had posted responses\\" to the video, \\"most of which were warm and cordial\\". Personal life Before being appointed as ambassador to Australia Berry lived in Washington, D.C. Berry is openly gay. On August 10, 2013, he married Curtis Yee, his partner for 17 years, at St Margaret's Episcopal Church in Washington.

For hundreds of years there persisted a European misconception that California was an island and many maps were made depicting it as such. Eventually, by the 18th century, enough information about California reached the outside world to dispel that myth. As California became increasingly populated, comprehensive surveying and mapping of its territory seemingly expanded slowly. When gold was discovered in 1848 and it joined the United States as the thirty first state in 1851 interest in plotting California's landscapes boomed. California quickly became a well documented piece of the United States. Time has brought even more mapping; with modern technology, particularly GIS any aspect of California can be and is recorded on a map. Not only are physical maps of California readily available, but maps with all variety of demographic information are as well. History 1650 Nicolas Sanson map showing California as an island.

This is the first known sea-floor canyon and is now called Monterey Canyon. From the 1850s through the 1860s, the United States Coast Survey, now NOAA's Office of Coast Survey, published a set of color maps with five stratigraphic units detailing the geologic makeup of California as well as a comprehensive set of nautical charts for the entire coast of California.Office of Coast Survey Historical Map & Chart Project, Search:\\"California, Nautical Charts.\\" http://historicalcharts.noaa.gov/historicals/historical_zoom.asp Shortly after statehood, the California state government appointed its first State Geologist and began commissioning geologic surveys of their own. The state appointed John B. Trask to the position of State Geologist and he served from 1850 to 1856. He compiled a report entitled \\"On the Geology of the Sierra Nevada, or California Range.\\" The second State Geologist, Josiah Whitney, served from 1860 to 1873. Whitney organized the first comprehensive survey of California and the first complete topographic maps of the state were completed under him. Mount Whitney, the tallest peak in California is named after him, a testament to his legacy. The State Mining Bureau was established in 1880, and the position of State Geologist was changed to State Mineralogist. In 1891, the first state geologic map showing eight color stratigraphic regions was published. The second geologic map of the state was published in 1916 and shows twenty one stratigraphic regions. The State Mining Bureau was renamed the Division of Mines and Geology in 1862. Its pseudonym, the California Geologic Survey, was established in January 2002.

He taught at the Western Reserve School of Design for Women (later renamed to the Cleveland Institute of Art), and it has been said that he \\"contributed more than any other person to Cleveland's artistic development\\". Life and career Gottwald was born in Austria, to Frederick and Caroline Grosse Gottwald, and emigrated to Cleveland, Ohio, as an infant. He first studied painting with Archibald Willard in 1874, with whom he would found the Cleveland Art Club in 1876. He then moved to New York City to continue his training at the Art Students League of New York, followed by stints at the Royal Academy in Munich, the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris, and Cooper Union back in New York. Upon his return to Cleveland in September 1885, he joined the faculty of the design school and would be associated with them for the next 41 years, including serving as director from 1889‚Äì91. His directorship was ended by a demotion to \\"headmaster\\" and there was such bad feeling between him and his replacement, Newton A. Wells, that the two men ended up in a fistfight. Although Gottwald was allowed to remain at the school as an instructor, he never regained the position of director. As an instructor, he taught a large number of Cleveland- based artists, such as Charles Burchfield, Henry Keller, Abel Warshawsky, and Frank N. Wilcox. Italian Landscape, ca. 1920, oil on canvas The 1890s were Gottwald's most successful years as an artist. During this period he exhibited almost yearly at the National Academy of Design, and the Boston Art Club a few times. He also had two pieces at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. In 1897, he founded a summer art school in Zoar which relocated to Chagrin Falls in 1899. After his retirement from the school in 1926, he and his wife Myria Scott moved to Italy. They lived there for several years, returning to Cleveland in 1930, after which they retired to Pasadena, California in 1932. Gottwald died there in 1941.

Through advantageous marriages, he obtained a country estate and became prominent in Surrey politics of the Hanoverian era, although his great nephew Arthur Onslow, as Speaker, judged that Denzil knew \\"no more of the business [of the House of Commons] than one who had been of the standing of a session\\". Early career and marriage As the sixth son of the Parliamentarian Sir Richard Onslow, he inherited little from his father. He was named after Denzil Holles, who stood as his godfather. Apprenticed in December 1661 to William Peake, of London, he soon turned elsewhere to seek his fortune. His elder brother Arthur had married Mary, the daughter of Sir Thomas Foote, 1st Baronet, a wealthy London grocer. Denzil married Mary's sister Sarah Lewis, the widow of Sir John Lewis, 1st Baronet. The money she brought to the match allowed him to buy the manor of Pyrford from Robert Parkhurst (the fourth of a line of the same name) which comprised approximately in 1677, a mixed quality agricultural estate, with patches of sandy soil and manor house in Surrey; and also the manor of Wisley. Rise in Surrey Onslow worked assiduously to improve his estate, and his situation improved again when Foote died in 1688; his estate was divided between Mary and Sarah, and Denzil's income rose to ¬£2,000 a year. As his fortunes and social status rose, Onslow began to cultivate political ambitions. He found his opportunity in the Exclusion crisis in 1679 which was an attempt before the successful attempt to dethrone James II of England. Standing as a pro- Exclusion Whig, he was returned as Member of Parliament for the borough of Haslemere. (His brother Arthur was simultaneously returned as MP for the whole county which stretched into today's London, while Arthur's son Richard was returned for the borough of Guildford.) However, a double return was made for the borough, and Denzil was not declared the member until 11 November 1680, triumphing over his rival James Gresham. Onslow lost his seat in 1681. Around 1686, he was appointed outranger of Windsor Forest, widening the Onslow family's powers over the west of Surrey and which paid Onslow ¬£600 per year.According to Onslow's nephew Arthur, however, the post of outranger was not salaried until 1715. (Onslow MSS p. 497)A warrant for his appointment dated 12 April 1694 is preserved in the Calendar of State Papers Domestic. In 1689, in the aftermath of the Glorious Revolution, he recovered his seat at Haslemere. Onslow's political activity is not readily traced; his nephew Foot Onslow seems to have taken a greater part in Parliamentary affairs. He supported Sacheverell's clause excluding from office members of municipal corporations that had surrendered their charters to James II; however, during 1693 and 1694, some observers considered him an adherent of the Court party. In 1695, he stood alongside his nephew Sir Richard to become a knight of the shire (MP) for Surrey, narrowly eking out a victory over Edward Harvey (which Harvey unsuccessfully appealed to the committee of privileges). Thereafter his votes stamped him as a solid Whig, although his attendance in Parliament was desultory. At the next election in 1698, the Onslow interest was suffering from a scandal: his nephew Foot's electioneering at Guildford after which the family did not dare attempt to monopolize the two seats for Surrey as a whole. He did not return to Parliament until February 1701 in a by-election for Guildford, where Foot had resigned to become an excise officer. Difficult years Safely established at Guildford, Onslow remained a dependable, if not assiduous, supporter of Whig interests, and was rewarded in 1706 with the post of commissioner of victualling, worth ¬£400 a year. The income was of some importance to him, as he had been financially impaired by the death of his wife Sarah, who revenged herself for his extramarital affairs by leaving most of her estate to relatives from her first marriage. During the next several years, Onslow showed considerable interest in promoting the affairs of Surrey in Parliament. However, his new-found support for the impeachment of Henry Sacheverell enhanced the support for Tories who garnered an opposition. Onslow was not unseated in the 1710 election but he faced a difficult contest and seems to have suffered from ill-health. Despite losing his rangership and commissionership in 1711, he continued to follow his party, voting to uphold the principle of \\"No peace without Spain\\" (to end the War of the Spanish Succession) in December. His nephew Sir Richard had lost election for Surrey in 1710 but was instead supporter-funded into the House through the rotten borough of St Mawes; in the 1713 election, Denzil allowed Sir Richard to contest Guildford, which he won. Return to Parliament Sir Richard in the same year won the Surrey poll as well, and chose to sit for the county. Denzil returned to Parliament in the resulting by-election in 1714. Although his rival John Walter contested the result before the Committee for Privileges, Onslow was accepted as victor after a long debate. Queen Anne's early Tory Party heyday was over. The Whigs were re-ascendant under George I and as such Onslow regained the lucrative commissionership of the victualling office. In 1717, Richard (who had been made a baron in 1716) died and was succeeded by his son Thomas triggering a by-election for Surrey. To maintain his family's interest there, Denzil arranged to be reappointed Out-Ranger of Windsor Forest, an office held by Thomas since 1715. As an office of profit under the Crown, this enabled him to vacate his seat at Guildford and contest Surrey, where he was victorious. This is thought to be the second instance where bestowal of an office of profit under the Crown allowed a Member of Parliament to resign his seat.Arthur Onslow explicitly avers that Denzil was granted the office to allow him to vacate his seat. (Onslow MSS p. 497) Onslow died four years later, in 1721. His marriage to Sarah Lewis had been childless, as had a second to the widow Jane Yard, sister of John Weston. Dying without issue, he left his estate to the children of his nephew Richard Onslow, 1st Baron Onslow; of no consequence as he had no children, Denzil had been included in the special remainder for the barony of Onslow.

The house is an Italianate-influenced -story, brick structure built about 1870. It was erected as the residence of a brick manufacturer, Francis Haley. The Francis Haley House is a good example of mid-19th-century middle-class domestic architecture, with Italianate elements, in Cumberland. Throughout various eras in American history, middle-class house builders across the country adapted elements from popular 19th-century architectural styles, such as the Italianate, Gothic and Victorian. These styles were applied with a more limited range of features to homes for the middle-class in a way that was less expensive, yet indicated the modernity of the house and its occupants. The Haley House is typical of this type of house form in Cumberland, and provides a contrast to the city's elaborate upper- class Italianate houses, such as those within the Washington Street Historic District. The Haley House was built around 1870 for successful local brick manufacturer Francis Haley. Haley was active in the brick trade from the 1840s until his death in the early 1880s. In 1875, he was appointed a member of the committee for building a new city hall. Haley was partially responsible for the construction of the surrounding Rolling Mill neighborhood, where his extensive brick yards were located, along with industrial B&O; Railroad operations for which the neighborhood was named. With the growth of the railroad, Rolling Mill rapidly expanded. The Haley House was one of the neighborhood's most elaborate homes. His appropriately brick house has been altered very little since Haley's occupancy, and still consist of two perpendicular rectangular blocks with low gabled roofs that are supported by brackets. The windows in the gable end feature rounded arches and the interior details are simple, yet massive. A portion of the original iron fence manufactured in Ohio, still separates the house from the street. The Francis Haley House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It is located in the Rolling Mill Historic District.

Jukes and published in 1969. It is credited, along with Motoo Kimura's 1968 paper \\"Evolutionary Rate at the Molecular Level\\", with proposing what became known as the neutral theory of molecular evolution. The paper brings together a wide variety of evidence, ranging from protein sequence comparisons to studies of the Treffers mutator geneIts discovery is described in this paper. in E. coli to analysis of the genetic code to comparative immunology, to argue that most protein evolution is due to neutral mutations and genetic drift. It was published in the journal Science on May 16, 1969. The idea of evolution at the molecular level being driven by the random processes of mutation and genetic drift, largely independent from natural selection, was controversial at the time; the provocative title further emphasized the break with mainstream evolutionary thought, which was dominated by the synthetic theory of evolution, often referred to as \\"Neo-Darwinism\\". Although they argued for essentially the same conclusion as Motoo Kimura's earlier paper, King and Jukes criticized one of Kimura's central arguments, an estimate of the rate of amino acid change in proteins that according to Kimura would indicate an impossibly high genetic load if the changes were caused by natural selection. The paper was initially rejected by its reviewers (one thought it was trivial and the other thought it was totally wrong ), but was published after an appeal. This time, the reviewer was James F. Crow, Motoo Kimura's collaborator. Despite the intentionally inflammatory title and \\"antiauthoritarian tone\\"--which according to historian Michael R. Dietrich \\"undoubtedly struck a nerve\\", especially since King and Jukes worked at UC Berkeley during that period of political unrest--the paper acknowledges the significance of natural selection; it merely argues against panselectionism (as advocated at the molecular level by G. G. Simpson and Emil L. Smith in particular). From 1969 until the early 1970s, the concept of neutral mutations driven to fixation by genetic drift was known as \\"Non-Darwinian Evolution\\"; it was subsequently termed the \\"neutral theory of molecular evolution\\". \\"Non- Darwinian Evolution\\" generated considerable interest in neutral mutations, and became very influential in the field of molecular evolution. The response by critics (including direct rebuttals by Bryan Clarke and Rollin Richmond), and subsequent replies (by King and Jukes, Kimura, and others), marked the beginning of the neutralist/selectionist controversy. In the 1970s and 1980s, Kimura became the chief advocate of the neutral theory, but he adopted a number of King and Jukes' arguments and de-emphasized genetic load.

Early life Markham was born into a wealthy and distinguished family of colliers and industrialists. They are particularly associated with Chesterfield, in Derbyshire. Markham's grandfather was the eponymous co-owner of the well-known Markham Colliery, in Chesterfield. Markham's father served as the Member of Parliament, as a Liberal, for Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, another well-known mining area. The family also had business interests in the coal-fields of South Yorkshire and Wales. In 1911, the contribution of Markham's father to this key industry was recognised with a baronetcy, or hereditary knighthood. During the First World War, Sir Arthur campaigned vigorously for the welfare of young soldiers. Lady Markham also interested herself in good causes for the war-effort, and became a CBE, the grade below being made a Dame. Markham's uncle, Charles, was the director of an engineering company, also based in Chesterfield, that made machinery for the mines: Markham & Co., amongst other business interests. Markham's aunt was Violet Markham, who used her privileged position to devote herself to educational causes around Chesterfield. Later, in 1927, she served her year as Mayor of Chesterfield. During the Great War, she turned her abilities to the training of women in war-service and, in 1917, was rewarded with the very high award of Companion of Honour, (CH). In 1916, Markham's father died, comparatively early, and the title was inherited by Markham's elder brother, who became Sir Charles Markham. Marriage and Beryl Markham In 1927, Markham married. His wife was a divorcee, a not-insignificant detail at the time, and was already a very well-known racehorse-trainer, both under her maiden name, as Miss Beryl Clutterbuck, and her previous married name, Mrs. Purves. The engagement had been announced on 27 August 1927, only five months after her engagement had been announced on 19 March 1927 in Kenya to Hon. Robert Fraser Watson, a younger son of the 1st Lord Manton, which change \\"produced a great deal of amused speculation within the (Kenya) Colony, whose chief occupation and innocent delight was social gossip. ...A generally held opinion was that Watson had a lucky escape\\".Lovell, Straight on till Morning Mansfield Markham gave his wife the surname by which she is now best known to history, and the financial support to engage in the new occupation for which she is now probably best-known, thus helping to create the persona of the aviator, or aviatrix as was the style of the time: Beryl Markham.\\"Beryl Markham Links \\" Karen Blixen, accessed 5 June 2010 The couple had a son, Gervase Markham. However, in 1928 and after the birth of the child, Mrs. Markham shocked her high society contemporaries by embarking on an affair with Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, the third son of the reigning King-Emperor, George V. The affair continued, in England, into the following year and Markham decided to bring an action for divorce. He indicated he would name the Prince in the proceedings, at which point Queen Mary intervened to grant Beryl a small annual income, to help her to travel and so enable the affair to cool off. After Beryl's successful Atlantic crossing, she began a new affair with Hubert Broad, and Markham filed for divorce. It was Broad who was named in the divorce proceedings. Beryl eventually returned to Africa and, in 1942, her book West with the Night was published. The couple's son was brought up by Markham's mother, Lady Markham. Movies Markham went into the movie business, and directed eight films in the early 1930s, including 1933's The Return of Raffles. Later life After his mother's death in 1960, Markham took control of Commodore Shipping, a business which began in the late 1940s as an excursion operator in the South East of England, using former Royal Navy vessels.

Hiscott and Julius Hagen, starring Clifford Heatherley, Mary Brough and Ursula Jeans. The film was based on the short story The Coming of Mr. Quin, part of the collection The Mysterious Mr. Quin, which was written by Agatha Christie. It was the first British film to be made of one of Christie's works. The short story was adapted by Hiscott, who would in 1931 direct Alibi, the first film to feature Christie's more well known Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. The film was made at Twickenham Studios in London. Plot Professor Appleby has terrorised his wife, Eleanor, but when he is murdered, and her lover, Derek goes missing, Eleanor suspects the worst. A mysterious stranger, known as 'Mr Quinny' or 'Mr Quin' appears, and begins to seduce Eleanor, but his alcoholism takes over and he dies. Before dying, he reveals that he was Derek all along, and offers the girl to a rival, who promises to make Eleanor a happy wife.This plot also appears in the novelization, discussed above.

Mr and Mrs MacLennan were married in August 1952 but their marriage was not a success. The couple separate shortly afterwards and Mrs MacLennan went to U.S.A. In July 1955 she had a baby girl. Mr MacLennan sued for divorce citing adultery. Mrs MacLennan defended this action and claim she had conceived the child through artificial insemination not through adultery. The Court of Session was faced with defining adultery and whether or not artificial insemination could be defined as under this heading. This is where the definition taken from Lord Wheatley's comments that adultery had to involve \\"physical contact with an alien and unlawful organ\\". The court lays down specific rules for adultery: 1- In adultery there must be two parties, physically present and engaging in sexual act. 2- It is not necessary that there is any interaction between the sperm and the ovum. The court ruled artificial insemination does not constitute adultery. However, Mrs MacLennan could not provide the court with any proof of her taking artificial insemination.

It is one of two major kinds of toxins produced by C. difficile , the other being an enterotoxin (Toxin A). Both are very potent and lethal.  Structure  Toxin B (TcdB) is a cytotoxin that has a molecular weight of 270 kDa and an isoelectric point, pl, of 4.1. Toxin B has four different structural domains: catalytic, cysteine protease, translocation, and receptor binding. The N-terminal glucosyltransferase catalytic domain includes amino acid residues 1‚Äì544 while the cysteine protease domain includes residues 545‚Äì801. Additionally, the translocation region incorporates amino acid residues from 802 to 1664 while the receptor binding region is part of the C-terminal region and includes amino acid residues from 1665 to 2366. Schematic image of the TcdB protein sequence. Catalytic region shown in blue contains residues 1‚Äì543, the cysteine protease region shown in black contains residues 544‚Äì801, the translocation region shown in red contains residues 802‚Äì1664, and the receptor binding region shown in green contain residues 1665‚Äì2366. The glycosylation activity of toxin B occurs in the N-terminal catalytic region (residues 1‚Äì544). This region glycosylates substrates independent of any cytotoxic activity. However, a small deletion of the receptor binding region causes attenuation of toxin B activity. The translocation region contains a hydrophobic stalk-like structure, which may help residues 958‚Äì1130 in forming membrane spanning pores. The receptor binding region that includes the C-terminal repetitive region (CRR) increases the TcdB membrane interaction but does not participate in pore formation. In addition, cysteine protease and translocation regions both have complex structures that play an important functional role in translocation and receptor binding. However, deleting the translocation region of amino acids decreases the cytotoxic activity 4-fold. Both cysteine proteases and a majority of translocation regions harbor hydrophobic proteins, which show access to TcdB and other toxins crossing the cell membranes. = Receptor binding domain = The C-terminal of TcdB (the green region of Fig. 2) contains a region known as the combined repetitive oligopeptides (CROPs) that contains amino acid residues 1831‚Äì2366. These CROPs make up 19‚Äì24 short repeats (SRs) of amino acids, roughly 31 long repeats (LRs) of amino acids, toxin A, and Toxin B. The TcdB CROPs region consists of 19 SRs and 4 LRs. This SRs and LRs region allows formation of cell wall binding motifs that help to bind sugar moieties of the cell surfaces. = Purification = In order to purify toxin B from C. difficile cell cultures, brain heart infusion broth is used because it promotes the synthesis of toxin B. The filtration method facilitates purification of toxin B from the supernatant of C. difficile. The toxin concentration of the supernatant is proportional to the organism cell count. It has been proposed by many studies that the majority of the toxins are released in either late log phase or early stationary phases, hence, toxin B is continuously secreted by cells. Although there are many methods employed by different studies in purifying toxin B, the majority of studies use methods involving concentrations of ultrafiltrated ammonium sulfate or precipitation, in lieu by either gel filtration or ion-exchange chromatography. In addition, the effectiveness of the ion-exchange chromatography method helps to differentiate between TcdA and TcdB.  Function  When the catalytic threonine residue of glucosyltransferase deactivates a family of small GTPases,e.g. the Rho family; Rac, and Cdc42 inside the target cells disturb signal transduction mechanisms, which leads to dysfunctioning of actin cytoskeleton, cell-cell junction, and apoptosis (Fig. 5). Rho induces the activity of actin stress fibers. Rac proteins controls the activities of membrane ruffling and NADPH-oxidase neutrophil. Cdc42 regulates the F-actin filament formation in filopodia. = Cytotoxicity = Figure 3: Toxin B changes the dynamic of cell structure. Images of SEM: a) control cells and b) cells treated with TcdB for 18 hours. Black arrow indicates the location of cell surface blebbing. Several studies have demonstrated that the presence of TcdB in mammalian cells leads to rapid changes within cell morphology and cell signaling. Within a short period of time, cells have the appearance of plaque with small dosages of TcdB and TcdA. In addition, death of the cells is a major impact of these toxins after cells have been intoxicated. An investigation by Donta et al., forwarded that TcdB has serious impacts in other mammalian cells such as chinese hamster ovary cells, human cervical epithelial cells, mouse adrenal cells, rat hepatocytes and rat astrocytes (Fig.3). The cytotoxic activity is based on cell types, which could range from 4-fold to 200-fold. Generally, when cells are infected with TcdB, they not only lose their structural integrity, but also diminutions of F-actin filaments. Cell roundings by TcdB take no longer than 2 hours (Fig. 4), but as far as cell death goes, it can take approximately 24 hours. With regard to Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), the effects of cytopathicity are more critical than actual cell death because once cells lose integrity of the cytoskeleton actin filament, they also lose its normal function. Figure 4: Toxin B's effects on rat astrocytes. This is a probable illustration of rat astrocytes incubated with 100 ng/ml of Toxin B for 2 hours at 37 ¬∞C. = Effects on small GTPases = The cause of cytotoxic activity by TcdB within the host cell is mainly mediated via receptor endocytosis. Acidic endosomes allow toxin B to enter the cytosol. This phenomenon takes place by a binding receptor region, which enables toxin to enter host cells. Through the accessibility of the host cells' cytosol, TcdB deactivates the small GTPases (Fig. 5), e.g. the Rho family members Rac and Cdc42 by the process of glycosylation of threonine 35 in Cdc42 and Rac, and threonine 37 in Rho. These Rho GTPases are found ubiquitously in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells that are responsible for the organization of the actin cytoskeleton because the toxins in the cytosol cause condensation of actin filaments as a consequence of cell rounding and membrane blebbing (Fig. 3), which ultimately leads to apoptosis. TcdB causes critical changes to cell dynamics and morphology. Figure 3 shows the probable effect of toxin B on a cell's surface; membrane blebbing (black arrows). In addition, TcdB inactivates Rho GTPases. As a consequence, cell- cell junctions are disrupted, which enhances epithelial permeability of toxin B and fluid accumulation in the lumen. This is one of the main causative agents in contracting Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD)(Fig. 5). Figure 5: Intracellular modifications by TcdB. Firstly, Toxin B binds to the surface of the cell and is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Secondly, acidification of the endosome triggers the formation of a pore through which the GTD is translocated. Thirdly, uptake by UDP-glucose helps to bind to the GTPases and release into the cytosol. Finally, the GTD glucosylates Rho family GTPases at the cell membrane and control transcription regulation and ultimately apoptosis of the cell. Furthermore, the rate of hydrolysis by TcdB of UDP-glucose is approximately five-fold greater than TcdA. Several studies have indicated that Rho exhibits posttranslational modification through prenylation and carboxymethylation, which occurs in the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, hence, the exchange of GTP to GDP. When TcdB binds to Rho and other small GTPases, GTP hydrolyzes to GDP, which leads to GTP-bound (active) to GDP-bound (inactive) (Fig. 5). In addition, this interchange activity is regulated by guanine factors in the cell's cytosol.  Disturbance on signal pathways  The cellular regulation of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 has effects outside the vicinity of the actin filaments of the cytoskeleton (Fig. 4), These small GTPases are incorporated in the cell cycle that regulates signals via mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs). Some physiological parts of the cells that are not involved in actin filaments, may not cause cell rounding or cell death right away, but in downstream pathway activity, may lead to the deterioration of actin filaments and finally, cell death. In 1993, a study conducted by Shoshan et al., showed that cells with TcdB changed phospholipase A2 activity. This was an independent event from disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Shoshan et al., also showed that TcdB inhibited the receptor signaling activity by deactivating the Rho proteins via phospholipase D. = Pore formation = TcdB accesses the interior of the cell through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, When toxin B is part of the cytosol, the glucosyltransferase passes through the endosomal membrane, which decreases pH, induces translocation and finally leads to morphological changes of translocation region residues (958‚Äì1130). The hydrophobic regions are embedded in the host membrane to form pores that allow glucosyltransferase domains to pass through. When cells are infected with TcdB in an acidic environment, it attenuates toxins and causes shape rearrangements (Fig. 6). As a consequence of acidic pH, TcdB displays clear differences in original fluorescence of tryptophan, susceptibility of proteases, and hydrophobic surfaces. Another group has shown that acidification leads to conformational changes of the toxin and, more importantly, helps to form pores. A putative translocation region ( Fig. 2) makes up approximately 801‚Äì1400 amino acids, of which residues 958‚Äì1130 are hydrophobic and are responsible for the formation of transmembrane pores. A majority of the studies used TcdB strain 630 to show the pore formation activity of C. difficile toxins. = Induced by pH = To see whether effects of proteolytic cleavage of TcdB takes place at the cell surface or in acidic endosomes, studies used Bafilomycin A1, which is known to block the v-type H+-ATPases of endosomes. This reduces the acidity in endosomes. The physiological uptake pathway of TcdB prevents cytopathic activity by TcdB. When cells were in acidic conditions (pH 4.0) for 5 minutes after binding TcdB to the cell surface at 37 degree Celsius, the shape rearrangements and rounding were observed. However, when rounded cells were incubated for an additional hour in neutral pH (7.0) with similar parameters, no cell rounding was observed. Both studies showed that toxin B has a property of proteolytic cleavage, which is critical for access to the cytosol. Having an acidic endosome pH leads to topological alterations of TcdB (Figure 6). Figure 6: Organization domain of TcdB.Showing the difference between neutral and acidic pH (4). = Genetics = The gene that encodes the TcdB protein, tcdB, is located within the chromosomal region of 19.6 kb. This is known as the locus of pathogenicity or PaLoc (Figure 2). The open reading frame (ORF) for tcdB is 7,098 nucleotides in length. It is important to mention that‚Äîbesides the major toxin genes in the PaLoc region‚Äîthere are three other accessory genes that encode in the PaLoc region: tcdR (L), tcdC (R) and tcdE in the middle. These genes help to regulate TcdA and TcdB expression. They also help to secrete or release the toxins from the cell. The encoding gene tcdE, located between tcdB and tcdA, is analogous to holin proteins, thus, it is suggested that tcdE works as a facilitator gene that enhances the release or secretion of TcdA and TcdB consequently increasing the permeability of the host cell membrane. Figure 2: Archetypical Pathogenicity Locus (PaLoc),encoding the large clostridial toxins(LCTs) involved in C. difficile infections CDI. = Toxin detection = There are different plasmid sizes of C. difficile. The detected molecular weights range from 2.7x106 to 100x106, but plasmid sizes show no correlation with toxicity. In order to detect the toxin B level in C. difficile, clinicians extensively use cell culture assays derived from stool specimens from patients with PMC. The cell culture assay is regarded as a ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù for detecting toxicity in C. difficile because a small quantity of toxin B is capable of causing cell rounding (Fig. 4), thus, it is a major advantage of clinical laboratories to make correlations with the CDAD caused by TcdB. Although cytotoxic activity of large clostridial toxins (LCTs) was found in PMC patient stool specimens, toxin B activity had more detrimental cytotoxic effects in comparison with toxin A. Therefore, the activity of toxin A is attenuated when it is not isolated from toxin B. The detection of C. difficile toxicity is extremely sensitive, however, using the cell culture assay allows clinical laboratories to overcome the challenge; using doses as little as 1 pg/mL of toxin B is enough to causes cell rounding. This is the major advantage in using the culture tissue assay to detect toxicity in PMC patients. Even though clinical laboratories have tried to use an assay microtiter plate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and other techniques to detect the cytotoxic activity of toxin B in the feces of PMC patients, the results are not as accurate as those where cell culture assays were used. = Production factor = By adding antimicrobial, e.g. clindamycin, into the culture growth medium, studies have shown that the cytotoxic activity in C. difficile cultures increases by 4‚Äì8 fold. Moreover, knowing the role of antibiotics on the causes of PMC, many earlier studies focused on the effects of antimicrobials production of toxins. As a result, studies were able to conclude that the subinhibitory nature of vancomycin and penicillin levels were increasing the toxin production in cultures of C. difficile. The amounts of toxin production were correlated with the usage of growth medium for the organisms. Another study illustrated that the high levels of toxin production of TcdB were observed in complex mediums such as brain and heart infusion broth. High levels of toxins were produced with isolation of highly virulent. Conversely, low levels of toxins were produced with isolation of weakly virulent. Thus, it shows that the productions of toxins were co-regulated. Although the mechanism behind the environment's involvement in modulating the signals expressing the toxins is not understood, in vitro studies have shown that expression of toxin is strengthened by catabolite repression and stress, e.g. antibiotics. Another study has shown that limiting biotin in well-characterized medium increases the production of TcdB by 64-fold and TcdA by 35-fold. This was done with C. difficile and doses of biotin as small as 0.05nM. Several other early studies have argued against the theory that the production of toxin has anything to deal with stress or catabolite repression of either toxin TcdA or TcdB. Also, many studies say the main reason for the differences among other studies is due to toxin production not occurring with all isolates of C. difficile.  Clinical significance  Many early studies have suggested that toxin A (also known as TcdA) is the major toxin protein causing antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD); however, research scientists within the last decade or so have shown that Toxin B (or TcdB) plays a more important role in disease than anyone had forecasted. With this knowledge, Toxin B has been identified as the major virulence factor that causes the opening of tight junctions of intestinal epithelial cells, which enables toxin to increase vascular permeability and induce hemorrhaging. Hence, this leads to tumor necrosis factor Œ± (TNF Œ±) and proinflammatory interleukins being established as the major causative agents of pseudomembranous colitis (PMC) and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). The involvement of toxin A and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîtoxin B is the key element that determines the disease caused by C. difficile. Clinical laboratories have identified these toxins in patients' stool based on antibody and cytotoxicity assays. These bacterial toxins have been shown to be associated with Clostridium sordellii hemorrhagic toxin (TcsH), lethal toxin (TcsL), and Clostridium novyi alpha toxin (Tcn Œ±), thus, making this cohort to be the large family of toxin clostridial. Because of similarities of these toxins with others, researchers have classified them as the family of large clostridial toxins (LCTs). = Mechanism of bezlotoxumab with TcdB = Bezlotoxumab is a human monoclonal antibody designed for the prevention of recurrence of Clostridium difficile infections. By x-ray crystallized structure of N-terminal of TcdB, the toxin is identified to consist of three domains: a glucosyltransferase domain (GTD), a cysteine protease and a combined repetitive oligopeptide (CROP) domain. Bezlotoxumab specifically binds to two homologous sites within the CROP domain of TcdB. Structural analysis by X-ray crystallography indicates that antibody binding partially occludes putative carbohydrate binding pockets. Consistent with this idea, Bezlotoxumab blocks binding of TcdB to mammalian cells. = Role in pseudomembranous colitis = In early stages of the disease of PMC, many studies have speculated that TcdA is more potent than TcdB. This has been deduced from in vivo experiments where toxin productions of TcdA were more severe than TcdB with antibiotics cecitis. Later, several studies showed that TcdB plays a major role in the disease of PMC and ADD. The study demonstrated that even though C. difficile did not produces TcdA, it still showed symptoms for the disease. Furthermore, later studies have shown that a purified form of TcdB is a more lethal enterotoxin in comparison to TcdA, and also, that intestinal epithelium is severely damaged and causes an acute inflammatory response. With better understanding of the toxin, researchers were able to state that TcdB is the major virulence factor that causes CDI over TcdA. However, when TcdA is present in the gut, it helps to facilitate TcdB's activity to have broader impacts, consequently, affecting multiple organ systems. In addition, when hamsters were vaccinated against TcdA, it showed hamsters were not fully protected from the C. difficile disease and this lead studies to conclude that TcdB is very lethal and potent. Furthermore, injecting a small dose of TcdA with a lethal dose of TcdB intravenously or intraperitoneally proved sufficient in causing the death of an animal. Therefore, TcdA works as a facilitator of TcdB exiting from the gut.

Clostridium difficile toxin A (TcdA) is a toxin generated by Clostridioides difficile, formerly known as Clostridium difficile. It is similar to Clostridium difficile Toxin B. The toxins are the main virulence factors produced by the gram positive, anaerobic, Clostridioides difficile bacteria. The toxins function by damaging the intestinal mucosa and cause the symptoms of C. difficile infection, including pseudomembranous colitis. TcdA is one of the largest bacterial toxins known. With a molecular mass of 308 kDa, it is usually described as a potent enterotoxin, but it also has some activity as a cytotoxin. The toxin acts by modifying host cell GTPase proteins by glucosylation, leading to changes in cellular activities. Risk factors for C. difficile infection include antibiotic treatment, which can disrupt normal intestinal microbiota and lead to colonization of C. difficile bacteria.  tcdA gene  The gene contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 8,133 nucleotides, coding for 2,710 amino acids. TcdA and TcdB share 63% homology in their amino acid sequences. These genes are expressed during late log phase and stationary phase in response to environmental factors. Environmental stresses such as antibiotics and catabolite repression can influence toxin expression.  Pathogenicity locus  The tcdA and tcdB genes are situated on the Clostridioides difficile chromosome in a 19.6-kb pathogenicity locus (PaLoc) found only in toxigenic strains of C. difficile. Non toxigenic strains contain a 127 base pair fragment replacing the PaLoc. This locus also contains three other accessory genes tcdC, tcdR, and tcdE. TcdC expression is high during early exponential phase and declines as growth moves into stationary phase, consistent with increases in tcdA and tcdB expression. Accordingly, expression patterns have indicated tcdC as a possible negative regulator of toxin production. tcdR may serve as a positive regulator of toxin production. tcdE has been speculated to facilitate release of TcdA and TcdB through lytic activity on the bacterial cell membrane. Due to its homology with other proteins of similar function, as well as the location of the gene between tcdA and tcdB, tcdE is predicted to function as the lytic protein that facilitates release since TcdA and TcdB lack a signal peptide for secretion.  Structure  The protein contains three domains. The amino N-terminal domain contains the active site, responsible for the glucosylating activity of the toxin. Both TcdA and TcdB use this highly conserved N-terminal region (74% homology between both toxins) to alter identical substrates. The carboxy C-terminal domain contains repeating units that are responsible for receptor binding on target cell surfaces. These short homologous repeating units have been termed combined repetitive oligopeptide (CROPs). A recent study demonstrates that the CROPs determine the potency of TcdA through interactions with structures on the cell surface. These CROP regions range from 21-50 residues and play a role in receptor binding. This C-terminal repetitive region is designated as the immuno-dominant region since ligand binding can be blocked by monoclonal antibodies specific to this region. This region contains the most hydrophilic portion of the molecule. A centrally located hydrophobic domain containing a cluster of 172 highly conserved hydrophobic amino acids is thought to be important for translocation of the enzymatic portion of the protein.  Mechanism of action  TcdA must be internalized into the host cell via endocytosis in order to access the cytosol. Receptor binding is the first step required for entry into the cell via endocytosis in an acidic endosome. Low pH in the endosome induces structural changes such as exposure of the hydrophobic domains that are crucial for TcdA function. The N-terminal domain of TcdA functions to catalyze a glucotransferase reaction, which transfers a glucose molecule from UDP-Glucose and covalently attaches it to conserved amino acids in target molecules. Therefore, TcdA catalyzes glucosylation and the subsequent irreversible inactivation of target molecules in the Ras family of small GTPases. These target molecules include RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42, which are regulatory proteins of the eukaryotic actin cytoskeleton and modulators of many various cell signaling pathways.  Intracellular targets  TcdA primarily targets Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. These molecules are important regulators of cell signaling. Small GTPases such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 regulate their activity by alternating between an active GTP-bound state, and an inactive GDP-bound state. Guanine exchange factors (GEFs) regulate the exchange of GTP and GDP. TcdA glucosylates RhoA by transferring a glucose molecule from UDP-glucose, a nucleotide sugar, to Thr-37 of the RhoA GTPase. In Rac and Cdc42, the sugar moiety is transferred to the Thr-35. The glucosylation prevents proper binding of GTP and blocks activation. TcdA acts preferentially on the GDP-bound form of the GTPase proteins since this configuration exposes the threonine residue that is glucosylated by the toxin. RhoA regulates the actin cytoskeleton and forms stress fibers and focal adhesions. When RhoA is inactivated via TcdA, its interaction with downstream effectors is inhibited. This leads to changes in the actin cytoskeleton that increase permeability of the intestinal epithelium. Rac and Cdc42 are involved in filopodium formation crucial for movement and cell migration. Overall, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 all regulate processes in cells that are dependent on actin polymerization. Many of the physiologic effects that cells experience after exposure to TcdA can be linked to disregulation of actin polymerization and cellular pathways controlled by TcdA targets.  Physiologic effects  = Cell morphology = Exposure to TcdA leads to immediate changes in cell morphology, including loss of structural integrity due to a decrease in filamentous actin (F-actin), and an increase in globular actin. Disorganization of actin filaments and the cytoskeleton leads to increased permeability of tight junctions resulting in severe epithelial cell damage and fluid secretion. Fluid accumulation and secretion are secondary to mucosal damage that occurs after exposure to TcdA. Distinct changes in the microfilament system lead to cell rounding and cell death. These changes result from the inactivation of Rho proteins, which play an important role in regulating tight junctions. = Apoptosis = Apoptosis is the most likely mechanism accounting for death of cells exposed to TcdA. Rho inactivation can activate caspase-3 and caspase-9; two key components of the apoptotic pathway. TcdA has been linked to mitochondrial membrane disruption and release of cytochrome C through caspase activation and Rho inactivation, further suggesting that TcdA is capable of inducing apoptosis.  Clinical significance  = Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) = Animal models have shown TcdA includes diarrhea, neutrophil infiltration, inflammation of intestinal mucosa, and necrosis of epithelial cells. This toxin is considered the main cause of CDAD. TcdA damages intestinal villous tips, which disrupts the brush border membrane, leading to cell erosion and fluid leakage from the damaged area. This damage and associated fluid response causes the diarrhea associated with Clostridioides difficile infection. = Pseudomembranous colitis = TcdA can induce the physiological changes that occur in C. difficile related pseudomembranous colitis (PMC), a severe ulceration of the colon. Toxin damage to the colonic mucosa promotes accumulations of fibrin, mucin, and dead cells to form a layer of debris in the colon (pseudomembrane), causing an inflammatory response. TcdA damage causes increased epithelial permeability, cytokine and chemokine production, neutrophil infiltration, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mast cell activation, and direct damage to the intestinal mucosa. All can be attributed to TcdA induced inactivation of Rho GTPase proteins. Loss of tight junctions can provide entry for neutrophils into the intestines, leading to neutrophil accumulation; a hallmark of PMC. TcdA induced cytokine production of IL-8 and other inflammatory mediators contributes to the stages of inflammation seen in PMC. Infiltration by neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells in response to TcdA damage increases the inflammatory response through production and release of other mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-1, IL-6, and other monokines. These mediators cause additional damage to intestinal mucosa and further increase the inflammatory response, influencing PMC persistence. If extensive damage to the intestinal wall occurs, bacteria can enter the bloodstream and cause septic shock and death.  Toxin detection and diagnosis  TcdA and TcdB are present in supernatant fluids of Clostridium difficile cultures and can be purified from filtrates. Both toxins are consistently detected in fecal samples from humans and animals and are now used as markers to diagnose C. difficile infection. Over 90% of patients infected with C. difficile were found to have cytotoxic activity in their stool. Glucosylation of Rho GTPases inactivates the GTPase proteins, leading to collapse of the cytoskelton, resulting in cell rounding. A tissue culture assay has been developed to detect C. difficile toxins in stool samples. A cell rounding assay (cytotoxicity assay) has been developed to diagnose C. difficile infection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have been used to detect TcdA and TcdB with specific antibodies. When used with an ELISA, the cytotoxicity assay is the \\"gold standard\\" when used on Vero cells for C. difficile diagnosis.  Importance of TcdA and TcdB in C. difficile infection  Since the 1980s and early 1990s, the roles of TcdA and TcdB in C. difficile infection have been much debated. Previous reports with purified toxins indicated that TcdA alone was enough to cause symptoms of infection and TcdB was unable to do so unless combined with TcdA. A more recent experiment indicated that TcdB was, in fact, essential for virulence. Earlier research established TcdA strictly as an enterotoxin, and TcdB as a cytotoxin, but later both toxins were found to have the same mechanism of action. To fully investigate the role of both toxins in pathogenesis of C. difficile infection, a gene knockout system in a hamster infection model was developed. By permanently knocking out tcdA, tcdB, or both (double knockout), it was shown that C. difficile producing one or both toxins was capable of cytotoxic activity, and this activity translated directly to virulence in vivo. It was also found that a double tcdAtcdB knockout was completely attenuated in virulence. Overall, this research has demonstrated the importance of both TcdA and TcdB in C. difficile infection, showing that either toxin is capable of cytotoxicity.

Fisher Auto Body, having a significant presence here, with both Plant 21 and Plant 23 on Piquette Street alone,Fisher Body Plant Number 21 from Detroit1701.org originally produced wooden horse carriages and was one of the early companies to supply steel auto bodies. Other auto parts companies opened in this area not only because of its many auto company manufacturers, but also because of the confluence of the two major railroad lines, making it efficient to ship cars and parts throughout the US. Auto manufacturers who moved into the area included Anderson Electric Car Company, Brush Motor Car Company, Cadillac, Dodge, Everitt-Metzger- Flanders (E-M-F), Hupp, Packard, Oakland, Studebaker, and Regal.Milwaukee Junction from the Piquette Plant Ford Motor Company also established a presence in Milwaukee Junction when it opened the Piquette Avenue Plant. This was the factory where the Ford Model T was first built before being mass- produced in neighboring Highland Park at the Highland Park Ford Plant.Development of the Model T from the Piquette Plant Henry Ford also conducted experiments in assembly line production at the Piquette Avenue Plant, which was used later in Highland Park. Earlier models of the Ford line were also conceived and produced there, including the Ford Model N. The dominance of Milwaukee Junction in the auto industry lasted until the 1920s. It is now considered the \\"cradle of the Detroit auto industry\\". The attraction of this railroad junction continues into even modern times, with Cadillac building the Poletown Plant adjacent to the junction in the early 1980s. It is almost on the site of the original 1908 Cadillac Motor Car Assembly Plant assembly plant,Cadillac Motor Car Company Assembly Plant and less than 5 miles away from the \\"Cadillac Main\\" Detroit Assembly built in 1920 within the \\"V\\" of another railroad junction (at Junction Street) on the same Grand Trunk Western line. Current service The junction is still heavily used by freight and passenger rail today. Three lines of the Grand Trunk Western Railroad, a US subsidiary of the Canadian National Railway, meet at the junction: The Shore Line Subdivision coming in from the southwest, the Holly Subdivision from the northwest, and the Mt. Clemens Subdivision from the northeast. The Detroit Connecting Railroad comes in from the south and interchanges with the GTW's Shore Line and Mt. Clemens subdivisions. The Conrail North Yard Branch, shared by CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway, also crosses the site coming in from the southwest paralleling GTW's Shoreline and Mt. Clemens subdivisions, but does not interchange with any railways in the junction. Trains of Amtrak's Wolverine service pass through the junction six times a day, using the GTW's Shore Line and Holly subdivisions.

Although they claimed to be Khan, Mongolian chronicles call them Hun Taij, which was a noble rank equivalent to prince. Background After the death of Dayan Khan some time after 1517 his empire was split between his descendants and became a kind of family federation. His grandson, a different Altan Khan (1507‚Äì1582) of Tumet drove the Oirats west to Kobdo in western Mongolia. Dayan Khan's youngest son, Gersendze Huangtaizi, was given lands approximately matching the territory of present-day Mongolia. By the early 17th century most of Outer Mongolia was held by his descendants. These formed four khanates, from west to east: * The Altyn Khan (great grandson of Geresandza) in the far west. * Dzasagtu-khan, khanate founded by Laikhor-khan, a cousin of the Altyn Khan. * Tushetu Khan at √∂rg√∂√∂ (/, today Ulan Bator) founded by Abtai Sain Khan, another grandson. This was the senior branch. * Sechen-khan at the eastern end of modern Mongolia, founded by Shului, a great-grandson. The Altan Khan was important circa 1609-1682. The Tushetu Khan, with his control of the religious capital, was long the leading figure in Khalkha. In the 17th century, to the west, the Oirat Dzungar Khanate was gradually consolidated in modern-day Xinjiang; to the north, the Russians increased their hold over the Siberian forests; and, to the east, the Manchus moved south to conquer the Ming dynasty, eventually forming the Qing dynasty. Rulers * Ubasi Khong Tayiji (Shului Ubasha Khong Tayiji) (?-1623) was the first to take the name Altyn Khan. About 1609 he occupied the former Oirat heartland around Kobdo and Lake Ubsa Nor. He drove the Oirats west into Dzungaria in 1620 and 1623. Ubasi was killed by the Oirats in 1623 and was succeeded by his son Badma Erdeni Khong Tayiji. * Badma Erdeni Khong Tayiji (1623-?) his son. In 1652, he abdicated the throne and his son Erinchin Lobsang Tayiji succeeded. * Erinchin Lobsang Tayiji (or Lobdzang or Rinchen Sayin Khong Tayiji) (ca.1658-91): In 1662 he attacked, captured and put to death his eastern neighbor, the Dzasagtu Khan. This led the senior Tushetu Khan (Chaghun Dorji) to form a league and drive out the Altan-khan. In 1667 he was captured by Sengge, the Dzungar chief and was handed over to the (next) Dzasagtu Khan . With the help of the Dzungar and Qing (divide and conquer), he was able to reinstate himself, but in 1682 he was captured by the Dzasagtu Khan. In 1691 he, and his khanate, disappeared from the records.

Fictional talking animals often are anthropomorphic, possessing human-like qualities but appearing as a creature. The usage of talking animals enable storytellers to combine the basic characteristics of the animal with human behavior, to apply metaphor, and to entertain children. There are a number of alleged real-life talking animals.  Talking creatures which are still creatures  The creature retains its original form without much change, other than being able to speak. Sometimes it may only speak as a narration for the reader's convenience. The rabbits in Watership Down who, except for the ability to discuss their actions, behave exactly as normal rabbits, also come under this category, as do characters from animated films like Happy Feet and The Lion King. Billina, a talking chicken in Oz, by Andr√© Koehne The talking creature concept is featured within much traditional literature, such as in Aesop's Fables, and several mythologies, including Greek, Chinese and Indian mythologies. A notable example from the Judaeo-Christian tradition is the talking serpent from the Book of Genesis, which tempts Eve to eat the forbidden fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Many fairy tales include apparent talking creatures that prove to be shapeshifted people, or even ghosts. The fairy tales How Ian Direach got the Blue Falcon and Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf have the hero aided by a fox and a wolf respectively, but in the similar tale The Golden Bird, the talking fox is freed from a spell to become the heroine's brother, and in The Bird 'Grip', the fox leaves the hero after explaining that it was the dead man whose debts the hero had paid. Whether shape-shifted or merely having the magical ability to speak, the talking creature is perhaps the most common trait of fairy tales. The motif is certainly present in many more tales than fairies.Stith Thompson, The Folktale, p 55, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977 Numerous modern science fiction and fantasy stories intermix human and creature characters. In L. Frank Baum's Land of Oz, creatures (such as the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger) talk. The chicken Billina gains the ability to talk when she is swept away by a storm to land near Oz, as do other animals, and Toto, it is explained in a retcon, always had the ability since arriving in Oz, but never used it. In C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia, the world of Narnia is ruled by a talking lion by the name of Aslan, and many small characters are talking woodland animals, both of which interact with both the humans of Narnia, and the children who act as the protagonists of the books. On the kids shows like Go, Diego, Go! and Dora the Explorer, two cousins Dora and Diego talking to the animals in the rainforest. On few episodes of season 2 in Dora and Friends: Into the City!, Dora and her friends can talk to the animals. On the Disney franchises of The Jungle Book and Tarzan, Mowgli along with Shanti and Ranjan can talk to the animals in the jungles of India, and Tarzan along with Jane and her father can talk to the animals: gorillas and elephants in African jungle. On the French feral child comic book Pyr√©n√©e, Pyr√©n√©e can talk to the forest animals in the French mountains of Pyrenees.  Creatures that portray humans  Most people in the industries of professional illustration, cartooning, and animation refer to these types of creature characters as talking animals,Katalin Orban, Ethical Diversions: The Post-Holocaust Narratives of Pynchon, Abish, DeLillo, and Spiegelman, New York, London: Routledge, 2005, p. 52. funny animals or anthropomorphic characters.M. Keith Booker (ed.), Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas, Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2014, pp. 177. The earliest example of talking creatures portraying humans, as opposed to talking creatures portraying creatures, was in Vishnu Sarma's Panchatantra (Fables of Bidpai), which was set in a world of talking creatures who represent human morals and behavior. A good Western example of the genre is Henryson's Fabillis. The webcomic \\"Anima: Age of the Robots\\" (Anima (webcomic)) uses anthropomorphism to portray an alternate world as modern as ours, but inhabited by creature-lookalikes. The intelligent robots they have made rebel and threaten the creatures. This serves as a warning to mankind's thoughtless pursuit of technological advancement.

Debuted in the 1992 Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W124), this engine family is relatively oversquare and uses 4 valves per cylinder. All engines in the family use a cast iron engine block and aluminum alloy cylinder head.  M111.920 and M111.921  The M111.920 is a 16 valve engine. It produces of power at 5500 rpm and at 4200 rpm. Starting with 1996 it has a variant called the M111.921 which has a MAF (Mass Air Flow)-sensor instead of MAP-sensor on the first one, and using ECU instead of PMS. Applications: * 1993-2000 C180 (W202)  M111.940  The M111.940 is a 16-valve engine with bore and stroke of and compression ratio of 9.6:1. It produces of power and of torque. Applications: * 1992-1995 E200 (W124) * 1997-2002 CLK200 (C208) * 1993-2000 C200 (W202) Unlike the 102, 103, and early 104 series engines, the engine did not use mechanical fuel injection but the Siemens PEC/PMS (Pressure Engine Control) management system, which integrates fuel and spark management. It is a speed-density type of system, as mixture formation is dependent on RPM, TPS angle, and manifold pressure (MAP). Injectors work in pairs (idle, part load), or altogether (full-load). It uses 2 ignition coils and no ignition distributor. Cylinders are fired in pairs (dual fire) - 1 and 4 together, and 2 and 3 together. The crankshaft position sensor is sensing the movement of two radially opposed position plates on the flywheel, one of which is magnetized, and the other is not. Thus, the engine management has precise information which group of cylinders to fire, and which group of injectors to spray.  M111.942  Similar to the M111.940 engine, used in the following years. It produces of power and of torque. Applications: * 1995-2000 E200 (W210) * 1993-2000 C200 (W202) This motor never had PMS. Early models -95 to -97 has a HFM-motronic, hot-film type air/fuel metering device, and -97 to -2002 with ME2.1 motronic. The later system also has a magnet on the intake camshaft, and gives signal to ECU, to assist the motor in producing more torque at low revs. The early motor didn't have any camshaft position sensor, so wiring was much different. The only problem experienced with this M111 excellent reliability motor is the originally installed Victor Reinz headgasket, which eventually tore apart by age, and made the top lose coolant on the side. Other than that, only some year models, had bad insulation on the engine wiring, that needed all the wiring to be replaced.  M111.943  It produces and . Applications: * 1996-2000 SLK200 Kompressor (R170)  M111.944  The M111.944 is a 16-valve engine utilizing a supercharger similar to the 2.3L M111.973 engine. It produces of power and of torque. This engine was built especially for SLK 170 and CLK 208 exported to Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal and Greece for tax reasons. The 'executive cars' tax limit was based in engine's capacity bigger than 2000 cc, so Mercedes in order to hit these markets made a mixture of the M111.940 with the supercharger of M111.973 for high performance at low engine capacity.

This was Russell Crowe's last Australian film until 2014's The Water Diviner. Plot Japanese bride Midori Takada (Youki Kudoh) arrives in Sydney with her new husband Yukio (Kenji Isomura). She believes her marriage is a mistake and uses the honeymoon as a means to escape. Colin O'Brien (Russell Crowe) is an experienced getaway driver. He is hired by an Australian-Afghan family to help rob a bank. During the robbery one member is killed. Midori is in the bank at the same time and they grab her as a hostage. After escaping, the two Afghan brothers decide to get rid of her. Colin will not allow this. He kills one of the brothers and threatens to shoot the other, Mahood (Robert Mammone). He and Midori escape. Colin wishes to travel to see his father, Cam, at his ranch because he hasn't seen him in years. Midori chooses to stay with Colin. The duo rob a bank to fund their trip. Mahood and his father, Boorjan (Petru Gheorghiu), swear revenge and set out to catch Colin. The police, aware of the Afghan family's illegal activities, are also in pursuit. Yukio is told of his wife's involvement and he is aware that she left him by choice. His honor injured, he goes to find her. Colin and Midori venture across New South Wales. The Afghans catch up with Colin and begin to torture him, but Colin manages to kill the patriarch and remaining son. Yukio searches for Midori, killing people along the way. Colin and Midori eventually reach the ranch owned by his father, Cam (Ray Barrett). The duo stays for a short while and officially become lovers. They then leave to visit the seashore. Yukio reaches the ranch soon after and threatens Cam with death if he doesn't tell him where Midori has gone. Cam responds that he believes in karma and Yukio will soon pay for his evil ways. Enraged, Yukio doesn't simply shoot Cam; he drowns him. After some setbacks, Yukio catches up with the lovers and shoots Colin in the torso. Midori retrieves a gun from their car and shoots Yukio, who then shoots her in the side. He tells her that he still loves her, but she counters that he doesn't know what love is and then kills him. The police hear about the shootout and chase the lovers. Midori drives while Colin is slowly dying in the passenger's seat. They reach the shore, but their car rolls over and catches fire. She shoots herself and the car explodes. The police watch as the car burns.

In addition, he is providing support and launching initiatives to grow innovation and entrepreneurship programs within the college and university.  Biography  Prior to coming to TTU, Motevelli founded the Center for Technology Development at Purdue University (2011), led the EcoCar 2 (2011-2013) project at Purdue and served the Head of Mechanical Engineering Technology Department (2009-2012) at Purdue University. In August 2008, Dr. Motevalli accepted to serve as Professor of Engineering and Associate Provost for Graduate Studies and Research of the Dubai Aerospace Enterprise University after having served during 2007‚Äì08 academic year in that position in a Consulting role. Upon closure of DAEU, he spend a year on a leave for educational purposes from the George Washington University where he had been director of the Aviation Institute from 2004-2008, co-Director of the Institute (2002‚Äì04) and Director of the Aviation Safety and Security Certificate Program from 1998-2008. He has been teaching, conducting research and has administrative experience in academic, government and industry with diverse experience in combustion, fire safety, aviation safety and security and transportation safety since 1983. His professional experience outside the academia includes working at National and government laboratories (NIST, NRL), government (US Congress as ASME Congressional Fellow) and consulting. Most recently, he directed the International Aviation Safety and Security Summit program (2001‚Äì2005), which developed a leadership program for ministers and Directors General of civil aviation for more than 100 countries of the world. This program was funded by FAA and supported by the DOT Secretary's office. The program focus was on providing executive level training and technical information and assistance to ministerial level officials, Director Generals of civil aviation and other foreign government officials on oversight responsibilities and requirements in aviation safety and security based on the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices. As Project Director, Dr. Motevalli worked with US and Foreign government officials, Department of State, TSA and aviation industry. Several years of directing the aviation safety and security program has enabled him to study a number of issues in aviation safety and security both in the US and abroad. His broad knowledge of the issues in aviation particularly relates to cabin safety, uncontained engine failures, government oversight issues, aviation security challenges and emerging threats. He also worked closely with the Gore Commission (President's Commission on Aviation Safety and Security in 21st Century) staff in 1996‚Äì97. He has published papers on the various aspects of aviation safety and security. He has been interviewed by US and international media on aviation safety and security as well as automotive technologies numerous times. Dr. Motevalli has participated in a number of consulting projects related to aviation including Business Process Re-Engineering for the Ethiopian Enterprise, development of civil aviation laws and regulations for Afghanistan, advising Department of Homeland Security on aviation security issues, international aviation security training quality assurance and a number of other projects in aviation, transportation and fire safety. Prior to his position at GW, Prof. Motevalli was a tenured faculty of Mechanical Engineering Department at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1994. His research has included aircraft evacuation, injury evaluation, emerging aviation safety and security issues, Finite Element modeling of aircraft engine containment simulation, aircraft cabin safety, aircraft finite element modeling, aviation safety oversight standards, hybrid-electric vehicle research with emphasis on safety of fuel cell, fuel reformers, alternative fuel use and evaluation of airbag models. He has over 100 technical publications in addition to reports, presentations and invited talks and has directed over 35 graduate students and a large number of undergraduate students in a variety of topic areas. Dr. Motevalli has conducted sponsored research and training programs exceeding $13 million since 1988. He was appointed Department Head of MET at Purdue University in September 2009.

They are applied over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.Hak, T. et al. 2007. Sustainability Indicators, SCOPE 67. Island Press, London. Bell, Simon and Morse, Stephen 2008. Sustainability Indicators. Measuring the Immeasurable? 2nd edn. London: Earthscan. . https://books.google.com/books/about/Sustainability_Indicators.html?id=6DOC13cd9c0C Some of the best known and most widely used sustainability measures include corporate sustainability reporting, Triple Bottom Line accounting, and estimates of the quality of sustainability governance for individual countries using the Global Green Economy Index (GGEI), Environmental Sustainability Index and Environmental Performance Index. An alternative approach, used by the United Nations Global Compact Cities Programme and explicitly critical of the triple-bottom-line approach is Circles of Sustainability.  Sustainability need and framework.  Sustainability development has become yardstick of improvement for industries and are being integrated into effective business strategies. The needs for sustainability measurement are, improvement in the operations, bench-marking performances, tracking progress, evaluating process, etc. For the purpose of building a proper sustainability indicator, framework is developed and the steps are as follows:https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-10/documents/framework- for-sustainability-indicators-at-epa.pdf #Defining the system- A proper and definite system is defined. A proper system boundary is drawn for further analysis. #Elements of the system- The whole input, output of materials, emissions, energy and other auxiliary elements are properly analysed. The working conditions, process parameters and characteristics are defined in this step. #Indicators selection- The indicators is selected of which measurement has to be done. This forms the metric for this system whose analysis is done in the further steps. #Assessment and Measurement- Proper assessing tools are used and tests or experiments are performed for the pre-defined indicators to give a value for the indicators measurement. #Analysis and reviewing the results- Once the results have been obtained, proper analysis and interpretation is done and tools are used to improve and revise the processes present in the system. Sustainability indicators and their function The principal objective of sustainability indicators is to inform public policy- making as part of the process of sustainability governance. Sustainability indicators can provide information on any aspect of the interplay between the environment and socio-economic activities.Hak, T., Moldan, B. & Dahl, A.L. 2007. SCOPE 67. Sustainability indicators. Island Press, London. Building strategic indicator sets generally deals with just a few simple questions: what is happening? (descriptive indicators), does it matter and are we reaching targets? (performance indicators), are we improving? (efficiency indicators), are measures working? (policy effectiveness indicators), and are we generally better off? (total welfare indicators). The International Institute for Sustainable Development and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development established the Committee on Sustainability Assessment (COSA) in 2006 to evaluate sustainability initiatives operating in agriculture and develop indicators for their measurable social, economic and environmental objectives. One popular general framework used by The European Environment Agency uses a slight modification of the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development DPSIR system.Stanners, D. et al. 2007. Frameworks for environmental assessment and indicators at the EEA. In: Hak, T., Moldan, B. & Dahl, A.L. 2007. SCOPE 67. Sustainability indicators. Island Press, London. This breaks up environmental impact into five stages. Social and economic developments (consumption and production) (D)rive or initiate environmental (P)ressures which, in turn, produces a change in the (S)tate of the environment which leads to (I)mpacts of various kinds. Societal (R)esponses (policy guided by sustainability indicators) can be introduced at any stage of this sequence of events. Metrics at the global scale There are numerous indicators which could be used as basis for sustainability measurement. Few commonly used indicators are: Environmental sustainability indicators: *Global warming potential * Acidification potential *Ozone depletion potential *Aerosol optical depth * Eutrophication potential * Ionization radiation potential * Photochemical ozone potential *Waste treatment * Freshwater use * Energy resources use Economic indicators: *Gross domestic product *Trade balance * Local government income * Profit, value and tax *Investments Social indicators: * Employment generated *Equity * Health and safety *Education * Housing/living conditions *Community cohesion *Social security Due to the large numbers of various indicators that could be used for sustainability measurement, proper assessment and monitoring is required. In order to organize the chaos and disorder in selecting the metrics, specific organizations have been set up which groups the metrics under different categories and defines proper methodology to implement it for measurement. They provide modelling techniques and indexes to compare the measurement and have methods to convert the scientific measurement results into easy to understand terms. = United Nations indicators = The United Nations has developed extensive sustainability measurement tools in relation to sustainable development United Nations sustainable development indicators as well as a System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting., International Standard Industrial Classification UN System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting 320x320px The UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) has published a list of 140 indicators which covers environmental, social, economical and institutional aspects of sustainable development.http://www.pvsustain.org/dmdocuments/Class%203%20Singh%20Sustainable%20Assessment.pdf =Benchmarks, indicators, indexes, auditing etc.= In the last couple of decades, there has arisen a crowded toolbox of quantitative methods used to assess sustainability ‚Äî including measures of resource use like life cycle assessment, measures of consumption like the ecological footprint and measurements of quality of environmental governance like the Environmental Performance Index. The following is a list of quantitative \\"tools\\" used by sustainability scientists - the different categories are for convenience only as defining criteria will inter grade. It would be too difficult to list all those methods available at different levels of the organisation so those listed here are at for the global level only. * Benchmarks : A benchmark is a point of reference for a measurement. Once a benchmark is established it is possible to assess trends and measure progress. Baseline global data on a range of sustainability parameters is available in the list of global sustainability statistics. * Indices : A sustainability index is an aggregate sustainability indicator that combines multiple sources of data. There is a Consultative Group on Sustainable Development Indices :Air quality index :Child Development Index :Corruption Perceptions Index :Democracy Index :Environmental Performance Index :Emergy Sustainability Index :Education Index :Environmental Sustainability Index :Environmental Vulnerability Index :GDP per capita : Gini coefficient : Gender Parity Index : Gender-related Development Index : Gender Empowerment Measure : Gross national happiness :Genuine Progress Indicator ::(formerly Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare) :Gross National Product :Happy Planet Index :Human Development Index (see List of countries by HDI) :Legatum Prosperity Index :Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare :Life Expectancy Index :Sustainable Governance Indicators.

(eds) 2003. The water poverty index: development and application at the community scale. Natural Resources Forum 27: 189-199. * Metrics :Many environmental problems ultimately relate to the human effect on those global biogeochemical cycles that are critical to life. Over the last decade monitoring these cycles have become a more urgent target for research: ::* water cycle ::* carbon cycle ::* phosphorus cycle ::* nitrogen cycle ::* sulphur cycle ::* oxygen cycle * Auditing :Sustainability auditing and reporting are used to evaluate the sustainability performance of a company, organization, or other entity using various performance indicators.Hill, J. 1992.

Popular auditing procedures available at the global level include: :* ISO 14000 :* ISO 14031 :* The Natural Step :* Triple Bottom Line Accounting :* input-output analysis can be used for any level of organization with a financial budget. It relates environmental impact to expenditure by calculating the resource intensity of goods and services. * Reporting **Global Reporting Initiative modelling and monitoring procedures. Many of these are currently in their developing phase. ** State of the Environment reporting provides general background information on the environment and is progressively including more indicators. **European sustainability Eurostat. (2007). \\"Measuring progress towards a more sustainable Europe. 2007 monitoring report of the EU sustainable development strategy.\\" Retrieved on 2009-04-14. * Accounting :Some accounting methods attempt to include environmental costs rather than treating them as externalities :* Green accounting :* Sustainable value :* Sustainability economics Publications on sustainability measurement used in sustainability economics =Resource metrics= Part of this process can relate to resource use such as energy accounting or to economic metrics or price system values as compared to non-market economics potential, for understanding resource use. An important task for resource theory (energy economics) is to develop methods to optimize resource conversion processes. These systems are described and analyzed by means of the methods of mathematics and the natural sciences. Human factors, however, have dominated the development of our perspective of the relationship between nature and society since at least the Industrial Revolution, and in particular, have influenced how we describe and measure the economic impacts of changes in resource quality. A balanced view of these issues requires an understanding of the physical framework in which all human ideas, institutions, and aspirations must operate.Oil imports by country = Energy returned on energy invested = When oil production first began in the mid-nineteenth century, the largest oil fields recovered fifty barrels of oil for every barrel used in the extraction, transportation, and refining. This ratio is often referred to as the Energy Return on Energy Investment (EROI or EROEI). Currently, between one and five barrels of oil are recovered for each barrel-equivalent of energy used in the recovery process. As the EROEI drops to one, or equivalently the Net energy gain falls to zero, the oil production is no longer a net energy source. This happens long before the resource is physically exhausted. Note that it is important to understand the distinction between a barrel of oil, which is a measure of oil, and a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE), which is a measure of energy. Many sources of energy, such as fission, solar, wind, and coal, are not subject to the same near-term supply restrictions that oil is. Accordingly, even an oil source with an EROEI of 0.5 can be usefully exploited if the energy required to produce that oil comes from a cheap and plentiful energy source. Availability of cheap, but hard to transport, natural gas in some oil fields has led to using natural gas to fuel enhanced oil recovery. Similarly, natural gas in huge amounts is used to power most Athabasca Tar Sands plants. Cheap natural gas has also led to Ethanol fuel produced with a net EROEI of less than 1, although figures in this area are controversial because methods to measure EROEI are in debate. =Growth-based economic models= Insofar as economic growth is driven by oil consumption growth, post-peak societies must adapt. M. King Hubbert believed: Some economists describe the problem as uneconomic growth or a false economy. At the political right, Fred Ikle has warned about \\"conservatives addicted to the Utopia of Perpetual Growth\\". Brief oil interruptions in 1973 and 1979 markedly slowed - but did not stop - the growth of world GDP.http://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2006/pdf/050206.pdf Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers (natural gas), pesticides (oil), and hydrocarbon fueled irrigation.How peak oil could lead to starvation David Pimentel, professor of ecology and agriculture at Cornell University, and Mario Giampietro, senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), place in their study Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy the maximum U.S. population for a sustainable economy at 200 million. To achieve a sustainable economy world population will have to be reduced by two-thirds, says the study. Without population reduction, this study predicts an agricultural crisis beginning in 2020, becoming critical c. 2050. The peaking of global oil along with the decline in regional natural gas production may precipitate this agricultural crisis sooner than generally expected. Dale Allen Pfeiffer claims that coming decades could see spiraling food prices without relief and massive starvation on a global level such as never experienced before.Peak Oil: the threat to our food security = Hubbert peaks = Hubbert Peak vs Oil Production There is an active debate about most suitable sustainability indicator's use and by adopting a thermodynamic approach through the concept of \\"exergy\\" and Hubbert peaks, it is possible to incorporate all into a single measure of resource depletion.The exergy analysis of minerals could constitute a universal and transparent tool for the management of the earth's physical stock. Hubbert peak can be used as a metric for sustainability and depletion of non-renewable resources. It can be used as reference for many metrics for non-renewable resources such as: # Stagnating supplies # Rising prices # Individual country peaks # Decreasing discoveries # Finding and development costs # Spare capacity # Export capabilities of producing countries # System inertia and timing # Reserves-to-production ratio # Past history of depletion and optimism Although Hubbert peak theory receives most attention in relation to peak oil production, it has also been applied to other natural resources. =Natural gas= Doug Reynolds predicted in 2005 that the North American peak would occur in 2007. Bentley (p. 189) predicted a world \\"decline in conventional gas production from about 2020\\". =Coal= Peak coal is significantly further out than peak oil, but we can observe the example of anthracite in the US, a high grade coal whose production peaked in the 1920s. Anthracite was studied by Hubbert, and matches a curve closely.GEO 3005: Earth Resources Pennsylvania's coal production also matches Hubbert's curve closely, but this does not mean that coal in Pennsylvania is exhausted‚Äîfar from it. If production in Pennsylvania returned at its all-time high, there are reserves for 190 years. Hubbert had recoverable coal reserves worldwide at 2500 √ó 109 metric tons and peaking around 2150(depending on usage). More recent estimates suggest an earlier peak. Coal: Resources and Future Production (PDF 630KB ), published on April 5, 2007 by the Energy Watch Group (EWG), which reports to the German Parliament, found that global coal production could peak in as few as 15 years. Reporting on this Richard Heinberg also notes that the date of peak annual energetic extraction from coal will likely come earlier than the date of peak in quantity of coal (tons per year) extracted as the most energy-dense types of coal have been mined most extensively. A second study, The Future of Coal by B. Kavalov and S. D. Peteves of the Institute for Energy (IFE), prepared for European Commission Joint Research Centre, reaches similar conclusions and states that \\"\\"coal might not be so abundant, widely available and reliable as an energy source in the future\\". Work by David Rutledge of Caltech predicts that the total of world coal production will amount to only about 450 gigatonnes.\\"Coal: Bleak outlook for the black stuff\\", by David Strahan, New Scientist, Jan. 19, 2008, pp. 38-41. This implies that coal is running out faster than usually assumed. Finally, insofar as global peak oil and peak in natural gas are expected anywhere from imminently to within decades at most, any increase in coal production (mining) per annum to compensate for declines in oil or NG production, would necessarily translate to an earlier date of peak as compared with peak coal under a scenario in which annual production remains constant. =Fissionable materials= In a paper in 1956, after a review of US fissionable reserves, Hubbert notes of nuclear power: Technologies such as the thorium fuel cycle, reprocessing and fast breeders can, in theory, considerably extend the life of uranium reserves. Roscoe Bartlett claims Caltech physics professor David Goodstein has stated that =Metals= Hubbert applied his theory to \\"rock containing an abnormally high concentration of a given metal\\" and reasoned that the peak production for metals such as copper, tin, lead, zinc and others would occur in the time frame of decades and iron in the time frame of two centuries like coal. The price of copper rose 500% between 2003 and 2007http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/mcs-2008-coppe.pdf Copper Statistics and Information, 2007. USGS was by some attributed to peak copper. Copper prices later fell, along with many other commodities and stock prices, as demand shrank from fear of a global recession.COMMODITIES-Demand fears hit oil, metals prices, Jan 29, 2009. Lithium availability is a concern for a fleet of Li-ion battery using cars but a paper published in 1996 estimated that world reserves are adequate for at least 50 years. A similar prediction for platinum use in fuel cells notes that the metal could be easily recycled. =Phosphorus= Phosphorus supplies are essential to farming and depletion of reserves is estimated at somewhere from 60 to 130 years. Individual countries supplies vary widely; without a recycling initiative America's supply http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/phosphate_rock/phospmcs06.pdf is estimated around 30 years. Phosphorus supplies affect total agricultural output which in turn limits alternative fuels such as biodiesel and ethanol. =Peak water= Hubbert's original analysis did not apply to renewable resources. However over-exploitation often results in a Hubbert peak nonetheless. A modified Hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced. For example, a reserve such as the Ogallala Aquifer can be mined at a rate that far exceeds replenishment. This turns much of the world's underground water and lakes into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to oil. These debates usually center around agriculture and suburban water usage but generation of electricity from nuclear energy or coal and tar sands mining mentioned above is also water resource intensive. The term fossil water is sometimes used to describe aquifers whose water is not being recharged. =Renewable resources= *Fisheries: At least one researcher has attempted to perform Hubbert linearization (Hubbert curve) on the whaling industry, as well as charting the transparently dependent price of caviar on sturgeon depletion. Another example is the cod of the North Sea. The comparison of the cases of fisheries and of mineral extraction tells us that the human pressure on the environment is causing a wide range of resources to go through a depletion cycle which follows a Hubbert curve.  Sustainability gaps  Sustainability measurements and indicators is an ever-evolving and changing process and has various gaps to be filled in order to achieve a proper framework and model. Following points are some of the breaks in continuity: * Global Indicators- Due to difference in social, economical and environmental conditions of countries, each country has their own indicators and indexes to measure sustainability which can lead to improper and varying interpretation at the global level. Hence, there is a requirement of indexes and measuring parameters which is intended to be common among the countries, which could possibly give a comparison among countries. In agriculture, comparable indicators are already in use. Coffee and cocoa studies in twelve countries using common indicators are among the first to report insights from comparing across countries. * Policy making- After the indicators are defined and analysis is done for the measurements from the indicators, proper policy making methodology can be set up to improve the results achieved. Policy making would implement changes in the particular inventory list used in measuring the metric, which can lead to better and positive results. * Development of individual indicators- Value based indicators can be developed to measure the efforts by every human being part of the ecosystem. This can affect the policy making, as a policy is effective only if there is public participation. * Data collection- Due to improper methodology applied to data collection, dynamics of change in data, lack of adequate time and improper framework in analysis of data, can lead to measurements which can be outdated, inaccurate and unpresentable. Data collections are intended to be from grass roots level and there can be proper framework and regulation associated with it. It is intended to have a proper hierarchy of data collection starting from local zones to state level to national level and finally contributing to the global level measurements. Data collected can be made easy to understand so that it could be correctly interpreted and in a presentable manner consisting of graphs, charts and analysis bars. * Integration across academic disciplines- Sustainability involves whole of the ecosystem and is intended to have a holistic approach. For this purpose measurements intends to involve data and knowledge from all academic backgrounds. Moreover, these disciplines and insights is intended to align with the societal actions.

He succeeded Bill Raftery and preceded P. J. Carlesimo. He was a longtime assistant coach for the Pirates and was hired to replace Raftery, who left to pursue his communications career. Preceding his tenure at Seton Hall, he was a very successful New Jersey high school coach at Orange High School and at Essex Catholic High School. He brought both schools to the state finals. He won the Essex county and state championships while at Orange. Mahon's college coaching career began at Fordham University as an assistant to Hal Whistle, where he helped recruit players Ken Charles and Charlie Yelverton for the Rams. After Fordham, he joined Raftery at Seton Hall as an assistant for 12 years. While head coach, he knocked off the University of Houston and Phi Slama Jama in a huge upset and started the season with a 9‚Äì1 record. Then, two starters and one bench player who played large minutes were declared academically ineligible for the Pirates' second half of the season. Despite this, Mahon finished with a respectable season. However, even after doing this, Mahon was not hired by the university at the end of the season. In the end, Seton Hall decided to hire the younger, more energetic P. J. Carlesimo instead of the older, more conservative Mahon. This effectively ended Mahon's tenure at Seton Hall and he later took the reins at both William Paterson University and Upsala University, both of which are New Jersey schools. At both institutions he recorded winning records. His grandson JP Mahon of Red Bank Catholic High School led the Shore Conference in assists during the 2012 - 2013 basketball season.

It was shot in Brooklyn, New York. It was given the Audience Award for Best Feature at the 2007 Slamdance Film Festival and screened within such festivals as Maryland Film Festival. Plot Christopher, a lonely and plain man, finds an invitation to a Halloween costume party entitled \\"Murder Party\\", on the street. Constructing a knight costume out of cardboard, he makes his way to Brooklyn to attend the party, only to discover it is actually a trap set by a group of deranged art students. The art students, in costume, include Paul (a gothic vampire), Macon (a werewolf), Sky (a zombie cheerleader), Lexi (Pris from Blade Runner), and Bill (a Baseball Fury from The Warriors). They intend to commit a murder as a piece of artwork to impress Alexander, their wealthy and sinister patron, in the hopes that they will receive a large arts grant from Alexander. Chris has brought along a loaf of pumpkin raisin bread, which Sky starts to eat. She then reveals that she is allergic to non-organic raisins, and didn't know about them. The group asks if she'll be OK, and she agrees explaining she's only a little dizzy and needs to sit down, but she falls over and hits her head on some old machinery and dies. The group hides the body, as they are embarrassed and don't want their patron to see it when he arrives. After dumping the body in a deep freezer, Macon blames Chris for Sky's death and attempts to murder him before Alexander arrives by pouring a jar of acid on him; however, since it is acetic acid (vinegar), it has no effect. The patron finally arrives to the Murder Party with a friend Zycho (who is unknown to the group), and his dog Hellhammer. Alexander reveals that Zycho is his drug dealer. Each member of the Murder Party then gives their input on how they will commit the murder. Drugs and alcohol fuel the group as they decide to wait for the witching hour, at which time they will all stab Chris in unison. While Macon leaves to pick up some pizza, Alexander has sex with Lexi and then later with Paul. Macon arrives back to see the two having sex and begins binge drinking and ends up covering himself in alcohol in the process. Paul, a photography artist, begins taking pictures of Chris and is frustrated that no one will assist him. Zycho, bored with the party, asks Alexander if they could leave. Alexander then suggests that the group play a game of ultimate truth or dare. They will all take a shot of Sodium Pentothal (\\"truth serum\\") and divulge their most inner secrets. All eventually take a shot from the same needle, except for Alexander, who injects his shot into a slice of pizza. Each reveals mostly trivial truths about their lives and attempt to force Alexander to confirm that he indeed does have grant money to give. Bill, who has mostly kept to himself playing a PSP, discovers that the group make fun of him and plan on kicking him out, but only because his work is so much better than theirs. Macon confesses his long time love for Lexi and recounts a story of when they were in high school and ate a popsicle together on a water tower. Macon shows he kept the leftover popsicle stick as a token but is rebuffed by Lexi. Alexander sends Zycho out to get him some crank. Meanwhile, an extremely inebriated Macon goes outside to smoke a cigarette. Still covered in alcohol, Macon is engulfed in flames as he lights the cigarette, and only Chris notices. Frustrated with not having anyone to assist in his photographs, Paul calls his professional assistant to aid him. The group is not happy as the assistant is not aware of the murder party. An argument breaks out and Paul injects Alexander with a dose of truth serum. The group ask him about the grant again and discover Alexander is actually a fraud: He is a fry cook who plans on killing the group, stealing their art and selling it as he assumes it will be worth more. Lexi discovers Macon on fire and she and the assistant extinguish him. Zycho returns with a bag of crank and Alexander immediately tells Zycho to kill everyone. Paul is shot in the head but doesn't realize and seems to only be annoyed that someone interrupted his shot. The assistant is also shot in the head and Zycho attacks Lexi. Macon, badly burned but still alive, gets his chainsaw and uses it to attack Zycho, killing him and passing out shortly afterward. Lexi immediately begins to untie Chris, but Bill, who has now completely snapped, decides everyone has to die and kills Lexi with an axe. In the excitement, Hellhammer eats the bag of crank and then attacks Alexander. Bill finishes off the wounded Alexander with a baseball bat and begins hunting down the last survivor, Chris, who has now escaped. Macon awakes and pursues Bill with an electric chainsaw to avenge Lexi. The chase leads them to an art student party. Chris attempts to hide in a performance art exhibit and Bill is approached by the organizer, Cicero, and asked if has seen Alexander as a grant was promised to him. Bill is further enraged and vows to murder the whole scene. He enters the art exhibit and murders all the artists before cornering Chris. Macon, who has arrived at the party and has found an outlet to plug in the chainsaw, falls off the roof while plugging it in. The plugged in chainsaw is conveniently left hanging in front of a window where Chris is trapped. He uses the chainsaw to kill Bill in self-defense. Chris then slams a pumpkin onto Bill's destroyed head and screams, \\"You just ruined the party!\\" He exits the room, borrowing a security guard's phone to dial emergency services, explicitly pointing out that the scene is real - not art. He then leaves the exhibit as party-goers assume the murder scene is an art piece. Chris disposes of his anti-anxiety medication and arrives home, where his cat, Sir Lancelot, finally gives him his chair back. Christopher sits down and turns on his television, still wearing his blood-soaked knight costume.

Their first film was made in the 6th grade and was titled Megacop (1986). Later they were joined by Paul Goldblatt, Sandy Barnett, and Bill Lacey. The group would often do school assignments as video projects, so their vast filmography includes interpretations of classical works such as Macbeth and Beowulf. After high school, all went to various film schools and kept in touch. The Lab of Madness' first attempt at a feature was a screenplay titled Moustache. They shot a short film titled Crabwalk in an attempt to get funding for the film. After failing to find investors, the group decided to greenlight Murder Party with no money in August 2005, and in February 2006 they began shooting.Extreme Truth: The Making of Murder Party Production The shoot was rough with many taking multiple roles on the production. Despite the freezing set, a tight knit crew emerged. Much of the planned special effects had to be compromised due to budget constraints but because of this a lot more focus was put on a few individual effects. Visual effects artist Chris Connelly was brought in to work in post-production on the make up effects to supplement what was done on set. Reception The film holds a 100% critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 6 reviews.

The study of causality extends from ancient philosophy to contemporary neuropsychology; assumptions about the nature of causality may be shown to be functions of a previous event preceding a later one. The first known protoscientific study of cause and effect occurred in Aristotle's Physics. Causal inference is an example of causal reasoning.  Understanding cause and effect  Causal relationships may be understood as a transfer of force. If A causes B, then A must transmit a force (or causal power) to B which results in the effect. Causal relationships suggest change over time; cause and effect are temporally related, and the cause precedes the outcome. Causality may also be inferred in the absence of a force, a less- typical definition. A cause can be removal (or stopping), like removing a support from a structure and causing a collapse or a lack of precipitation causing wilted plants. Humans can reason about many topics (for example, in social and counterfactual situations and in the experimental sciences) with the aid of causal understanding. Understanding depends on the ability to comprehend cause and effect. People must be able to reason about the causes of others‚Äô behavior (to understand their intentions and act appropriately) and understand the likely effects of their own actions. Counterfactual arguments are presented in many situations; humans are predisposed to think about ‚Äúwhat might have been‚Äù, even when that argument has no bearing on the current situation. Cause-and-effect relationships define categories of objects. Wings are a feature of the category \\"birds\\"; this feature is causally interconnected with another feature of the category, the ability to fly. Traditionally, research in cognitive psychology has focused on causal relations when the cause and the effect are both binary values; both the cause and the effect are present or absent.Jenkins, H. M., & Ward, W. C. (1965). Judgment of contingency between responses and outcomes. Psychological Monographs, 79, ( 1, Whole No. 594).Cheng, P. W. (1997). From covariation to causation: A causal power theory. Psychological Review, 104, 367‚Äì405. It is also possible that both the cause and the effect take continuous values. For example, turning the volume knob of a radio (as the cause) increases or decreases the sound intensity (as the effect). In these cases, the relation between the variables of the cause and the effect resembles a mathematical function in which change in the variable of the cause changes values in the variable of the effect. Human learning of such relations has been studied in the field of \\"Function Learning\\".Carroll, J. D. (1963). Functional learning: The learning of continuous functional mappings relating stimulus and response continua. NJ: Education Testing Service PrincetonBrehmer, B. (1974). Hypotheses about relations between scaled variables in the learning of probabilistic inference tasks. Organizational Behavior and Human Performance, 11, 1‚Äì27.Koh, K., & Meyer, D. E. (1991). Function learning: Induction of continuous stimulus- response relations. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 17, 811‚Äì836. Even so, it is well understood that physical applications of continuous mathematical models are not literally continuous in practice. Maddy, Penelope (2017). Set-Theoretic Foundations. A knob on a radio does not take on an uncountably infinite number of possible values -- it takes a finite number of possible values fully limited by the mechanical, physical, nature of the knob itself. There exists no one-to-one mapping between the continuous mathematics used for engineering applications and the physical product(s) produced by the engineering. Indeed, this is one of the core open problems within Philosophy of Mathematics. Koellner, Peter (2013). Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: The Continuum Hypothesis Eklund, Matti (2019). Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Fictionalism Balaguer, Mark (2018). Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Fictionalism in the Philosophy of Mathematics While this is one of the most prominent open problems in the philosophy of mathematics, one possible answer to this open question is that reality is rasterized (possibly at the Planck Scale, see Loop Quantum Gravity) and is fundamentally discrete. So goes the theory of mathematical fictionalism, where continuous mathematics serves as a fake or fictional construct of imagery used for reasoning geometrically via drawings and intuitive ideas of shapes absent of measurement data. Indeed, some historical thinkers, such as Gauss, suspected that physical reality was in fact inherently non-euclidean and so developed non-euclidean geometries Banchoff, Thomas. The Development of Non-Euclidean Geometry. which were then used by Albert Einstein in his general theory of relativity with gravity being explained as the force or property which makes reality non-euclidean. Cause and effect may also be understood probabilistically, via inferential statistics. A common example taught in introductory logic is a conditional statement such that that 'the ground is wet.' Often the specific example is presented as a statement, 'If it rained, then the ground is wet' or something along this line. And often the fact that such a conditional statement is in fact true even when the antecedent (that it rained) is false generates some controversy. This fact about the conditional, the controversial (for some) law of excluded middle, hinges on reasoning about cause and effect. You might think, for instance, that the fact that it rained is what caused the ground to be wet, if it rained and the ground is wet. But it could well be that it rained after the ground was already wet, or any other possible cause of the observed effect. These other possible causes are called 'hidden variables.' Hidden variables always cause conditional statements to take a 'true' truth value in situations where both its antecedent is false and its conclusion true. Consequently, it follows that any logic conditional with a true conclusion is always true regardless of whether or not its antecedent is true. And any logic conditional takes a false value only when its conclusion is false. This shouldn't be surprising. In inferential statistics, there exists a mantra 'correlation does not equal causation.' Just because rain and wet grounds do have a positive correlation (they tend to happen together), without more information it would be impossible to know whether or not it was in fact the rain which caused the ground to become wet, so the positive correlation is insufficient for causation. A dump truck could well have come by and dumped out a truckload of water onto the ground, or a man could have dropped his water, or any number of other possible antecedents could be responsible for causing the conclusion that the ground is in fact wet to be true. In this way, ascertaining cause and effect relations is quite hard and arguably impossible barring some variable uncertain degree of confidence in some specific possible cause in relation to all other uncontrolled for potentially equally or unequally probable but still possible causes (some non-100% degree of confidence, known as a confidence interval in inferential statistics). Incidentally, this problem of hidden variables forms the foundation for the scientific method -- which is a solution to this problem of hidden variables. Only via the scientific method can one be absolutely sure that some true antecedent causes a conclusion to also be true. We say a cause causes an effect if and only if there exists a 100% perfect correlation (positive or negative) between the cause and the effect when and only when all other possible variables are controlled for (a 100% degree of confidence). In these cases these effects are called dependent variables, and causes are called independent variables (so named because the dependent variable(s) depend on the independent variable(s), and the independent variable(s) do not depend on any other variable). Indeed, when possible hidden variables cannot be controlled for, such as is the case of quantum physics, causality is indeterminate (quantum indeterminacy). Friederich, Simon. Evans, Peter. (2019). Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Retrocausality in Quantum Mechanics. This constitutes one of the biggest open problems in physics today, the interpretation of quantum physics and its reconciliation with the causal structure of special relativity (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, Rietdijk‚ÄìPutnam argument). Theories of causality also play important roles in debates of both free will and determinism. The empirical observations predicted by special relativity suggest that anything that could happen, already has happened. Putnam, Hilary (1967). The Journal of Philosophy: Time and Physical Geometry Depending on your philosophy of mathematics, since special relativity is a continuous mathematical model, the experimental confirmation of predicted effects described by the possibly fictional and conceptually-reliable-and-informative theory have implications for an ontology of time, which touches on the metaphysics of time which is intimately tied up with notions of causality and reasoning about cause and effect. Markosian, Ed. (2014). Sanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Time. . And the (for now) indeterminism of quantum physics suggests the possibility of free will in a deterministic reality. Balaguer, Mark. (2010). MIT Press: Free Will as an Open Scientific Problem Hameroff, Stewart. (2012). Front Integr Neurosci.:How quantum brain biology can rescue conscious free will. To quote Hameroff, \\"quantum state reductions seem to involve temporal non-locality, able to refer quantum information both forward and backward in what we perceive as time, enabling real-time conscious causal action. Quantum brain biology and Orch OR can thus rescue free will\\" ( Orchestrated Objective Reduction).  Inferring cause and effect  Humans are predisposed to understand cause and effect, making inferences bi-directionally. Temporal cues demonstrate causality. When observing an event, people assume that things preceding the event cause it, and things following the event are effects of it. Coincidence of movement and spatial relationships are another way to infer cause and effect. If objects move together (or one object seems to initiate the movement of another), causality is inferred from that relationship. Animacy may also be inferred from such relationships. Causal reasoning may be activated almost automatically. However, inferences about cause and effect do not always demonstrate understanding of mechanisms underlying causality; causality has been described as \\"cognitive illusion\\". Much understanding of cause and effect is based on associations, without an understanding of how events are related to one another; this is known as the \\"illusion of explanatory depth\\". A 2013 neuropsychology study demonstrates that humans conform new information to old information. This suggests an inverted causal experience: cause must be attributed to effect a posteriori to understand the causal connection between agent and act. Friedrich Nietzsche argued against Aristotelian causality (that cause precedes effect) in The Will To Power.Friedrich Nietzsche. The Will To Power. circa 1880s, which recent neuropsychological experiments confirm. 477 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) \\"I maintain the phenomenality of the inner world, too: every- thing of which we become conscious is arranged, simplified, schematized, interpreted through and through ‚Äî the actual process of inner \\"perception,\\" the causal connection between thoughts, feelings, desires, between subject and object, are absolutely hidden from us ‚Äî and are perhaps purely imaginary. The \\"apparent inner world\\" is governed by just the same forms and procedures as the \\"outer\\" world. We never encounter \\"facts\\": pleasure and displeasure are subsequent and derivative intellectual phenomena ‚Äî \\"Causality\\" eludes us; to suppose a direct causal link be ween thoughts, as logic does ‚Äî that is the consequence of the crudest and clumsiest observation. Between two thoughts all kinds of affects play their game: but their motions are too fast, therefore we fail to recognize them, we deny them ‚Äî \\"Thinking\\" as epistemologists conceive it, simply does not occur: it is a quite arbitrary fiction, arrived at by selecting one element from the process and eliminating all the rest, an artificial arrangement for the purpose of intelligibility ‚Äî The \\"spirit,\\" something that thinks: where possible even \\"absolute, pure spirit\\" ‚Äì this conception is a second derivative of that false introspection which believes in \\"thinking\\": first an act is imagined which simply does not occur, \\"thinking,\\" and secondly a subject-substratum in which every act of thinking, and nothing else, has its origin: that is to say, both the deed and the doer are fictions. Humans understand cause and effect. Research suggests that other animals, such as rats and monkeys, may or may not understand cause and effect. Animals may use information about cause and effect to improve decision-making and make inferences about past and future events. A constant which guides human reasoning and learning about events is causality. Causal considerations are integral to how people reason about their environment.Sloman, S. A. (2005). Causal models. New York, NY: Oxford University Press. Humans use causal cues and their related effects to make decisions and predictions and to understand mechanisms leading to change.Hagmayer, Y., Sloman, S. A., Lagnado, D. A., & Waldmann, M. R. (2007). \\"Causal reasoning through intervention.\\" In A. Gopnik & L. Schulz (Eds.), Causal learning: Psychology, philosophy, and computation (pp. 86‚Äì100). Oxford, England: Oxford University Press.  Types of causal relationships  Several types of causal models are developed as a result of observing causal relationships: common-cause relationships, common-effect relationships, causal chains and causal homeostasis. *In common-cause relationships, a single cause has several effects: Example of a single cause with multiple effects :A virus is an example of a single cause resulting in several effects (fever, headache and nausea). *In common-effect relationships, several causes converge in one effect: Example of multiple causes with a single effect :An increase in government spending is an example of one effect with several causes (reduced unemployment, decreased currency value, and increased deficit). *In causal chains one cause triggers an effect, which triggers another effect: Example of a causal chain :An example is poor sleep leading to fatigue, which leads to poor coordination. *In causal homeostasis, causal relationships form a stable cycle or reinforcing mechanism: Example of causal homeostasis :Feathers, hollow bones, high metabolic rate and flight reinforce each other in birds, with adaptation to the whole rather than one instance beginning a causal relationship.  Types of causal reasoning  While causal understanding can be automatic, in complex situations advanced reasoning is necessary. Types of causal reasoning include: = Deduction = Deductive reasoning implies a general rule; an event is a guaranteed conclusion. An outcome may be deduced based on other arguments, which may determine a cause-and-effect relationship. = Induction = Inductive reasoning is an inference made with uncertainty; the conclusion is likely, but not guaranteed. Induction can be used to speculate about causality. = Abduction = In abductive reasoning, the premises do not guarantee a conclusion. Abduction moves from data description to a hypothesis without a necessary relationship between cause and effect.  Models  There are several models of how humans reason about causality. =Dependency= The dependency model asserts that effects are contingent upon causes; cause and effect have a probable relationship. =Covariation= The covariation (regularity) model, a type of dependency model, suggests that humans understand relationships between causes and effects by their coincidence, inferring that change in a cause changes an effect. =Mechanism= This model suggests that cause and effect are mechanistically related. In this situation, there is a basic process underlying the cause and effect. =Dynamics= This model of causal representation suggests that causes are represented by a pattern of forces. The force theory is an extension of the dynamics model that applies to causal representation and reasoning (i.e., drawing inferences from the composition of multiple causal relations). =Function Learning= If the elements of the cause and the effect are continuous, the cause is commonly known as the \\"cue\\" (e.g., the volume knob) and the effect is known as the \\"criterion\\" (e.g., sound intensity). If the cue and criterion are quantified, people's learning and prediction can be approximated with certain functions (e.g., linear, sigmoid, exponential). This has enabled researchers to model human learning of such functional relations by fitting certain functions on the observed data.Doozandeh, P. (2016). Quantification of human confidence in functional relations. Cognitive Systems Research, 40, 18-34.  Development in humans  Children develop an ability to understand causality and make inferences based on cause and effect at an early age; some research suggests that children as young as eight months can understand cause and effect. An understanding of mechanism and causality go hand in hand; children need to understand cause and effect to understand the operation of mechanisms, which allows them to understand causal relationships. Children ask \\"why?\\" at an early age to understand mechanism and, in turn, causality. A child‚Äôs first \\"why\\" question often coincides with their first attempt to explain something, within the first year after acquiring language. Children ask \\"why\\" to understanding mechanism and causality. The ability to understand and reason about causality at a young age allows children to develop na√Øve theories about many topics. Causality helps children learn about physics, language, concepts and the behavior of others. There is a developmental pattern to the causal understanding children have. Infants have an understanding of causal power. They know that certain causes have particular effects. Young children, from late infancy to early childhood, understand functional relations: a particular property (or component of a mechanism) has a certain function. They also understand causal density: how causes can interact in a complex way. Older children and adults continue to develop an understanding of mechanistic fragments. They understand the components of a working system in isolation, although the full mechanistic details of a system do not emerge until adulthood. Jean Piaget defined preoperational, concrete operational and formal operational stages of development.  Across cultures  Causal attributions have been shown to be dissimilar among different cultures in several ways: =Causal attributions= Yan and Gaier investigated causal attributions of college success and failure between two groups of students, American and Asian. The Asian group was from China, Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia. Performance was similar across the four nationalities. The students were asked to make judgments about someone else's successes and failures in schoolwork, and whether those outcomes were attributable to innate ability or to expended effort. American participants were much more likely to attribute academic achievement to ability than Asian participants were. Although Americans tended to rate success as attributable to effort, failure was not perceived as being a result of a lack of effort. Asian students did not show this pattern. Comparisons between Western and Eastern children and adults suggest differences between the cultures in the causality attributable to particular illnesses. After reading stories of illnesses and making inferences about the causes of those illnesses, both groups showed an understanding of the biological causes of most illnesses. However, all the children and the Eastern adults also attributed some illnesses (and their remedies) to magical causes. =Causal motivations= Members of individualist or collectivist cultures may make different attributions of the origins and motivations of movement on a small scale among animated objects, or what would cause movement within a group of animated objects. Participants from the UK, China and Hong Kong were shown videos of animated fish on a computer screen. The videos depicted a central fish moving toward or away from a group of fish, and participants were asked to determine the relationship among the fish: internally motivated (the central fish was looking for food) or externally motivated (the central fish wanted to join the others). Another set of videos suggested that the group of fish was the predominant agent, with the individual fish being acted upon. These different videos provided an opportunity to determine whether group or individual action is the preferred motivating force among different cultures. Self-reported results suggested that Asian participants preferred descriptions and situations where the group was the central focus and causal agent, while Westerners preferred situations in which the individual was the agent. These effects also extended to memory processes; collectivist participants had better memories of situations in which the group was primary. This suggests that members of individualistic cultures are more responsive to independent agents and members of collectivist cultures are more responsive when groups guide individual action.  Causal reasoning in non-human animals  Causal reasoning is not unique to humans; animals are often able to use causal information as cues for survival. Rats are able to generalize causal cues to gain food rewards. Animals such as rats can learn the mechanisms required for a reward by reasoning about what could elicit a reward (Sawa, 2009). New Caledonian Crow (Corvus moneduloides) New Caledonian crows have been studied for their ability to reason about causal events. This intelligent species uses tools in a way that even chimpanzees cannot, making complex tools to bring food within reach. Experimental work with this species suggests that they can understand hidden causes in a way that was previously believed uniquely human. In the first of two experiments a crow was confined, with food in a tube inaccessible to the crow without some effort. A human entered the enclosure and went behind a curtain, waving a stick near the food tube through a hole in the curtain. When the human left the enclosure the crow confidently moved toward the food area and retrieved the reward, knowing that the human cause of the moving stick (albeit invisible) was gone. In the second experiment, no human entered or exited the enclosure. In this case the crow moved toward the food uncertainly, not knowing what caused the stick to move.

First page of the Continuous Mediation Without Armistice The Wisconsin Plan (also known as the Wales Plan and Canada Plan; originally Continuous Mediation Without Armistice) was a proposal created by Julia Grace Wales to end the First World War.  Origin and purpose  Julia Grace Wales was a Canadian-born Wisconsin university professor who was deeply troubled by reports of the war. She spent the autumn of 1914 considering possible methods for finding a peace solution. The United States was neutral at the time, and President Woodrow Wilson asked his compatriots to remain \\"impartial in thought\\". In December, Wales prepared a plan. She proposed that the United States organize a conference (a \\"world thinking organ\\") composed of delegations from neutral countries, who would mediate between the warring powers and disseminate peace proposals, with the goal of eventually reaching a fair settlement. The conference was to last for as long as the war continued.Wisconsin Historical Society. Teachers' Lessons. \\"Teacher Background‚ÄîJulia Grace Wales and the Peace Movement\\" Two main principles were meant to guide the mediators: no nation could be humiliated by the peace, and there could be no compromises that could later lead to another war. The plan was carefully revised many times.  Reactions  The newly formed Wisconsin Peace Party and the National Peace Party, led by Jane Addams, both endorsed Wales' plan. The former party started printing and distributing the Wisconsin Plan as pamphlets in early 1915. The National Peace Party sent a delegation to present the idea to President Wilson and to the United States Congress, to which it was recommended by Wisconsin's Senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr.. Rosika Schwimmer, who had independently devised a similar idea, proposed the plan at the International Congress of Women, and Wales seconded it. The ICW received several proposals but unanimously agreed that the Wisconsin Plan was the most plausible method. Thousands of pamphlets, printed in four languages, were distributed in Europe and North America. Wilson appeared to be interested in the proposal, but the sinking of the RMS Lusitania by the Germans in March 1915 and the resulting deaths of 1,198 people (128 of whom were U.S. citizens) brought about an uncertainty about the neutrality policy, leading government officials to back away from mediation. The industrialist Henry Ford started advocating the Wisconsin Plan and accompanied Wales to Europe, but the movement began declining. The United States entered the war in April 1917, rendering the plan a dead letter.

The medal is similar to the Multinational Force and Observers Medal presented to peacekeepers of the 11 contingents which serve in the force. Civilians are employed in a variety of jobs, primarily services and administration. Like the medals issued by the United Nations, the medals of the MFO are not issued by a government; the Multinational Force and Observers is an international organization which answers to its headquarters in Rome and to the two interested parties, Egypt and Israel. Criteria The MFO Civilian Service Medal is awarded to MFO Civilian staff members not eligible for the MFO Medal, and to members of the prime Sinai Support Contractor staff in recognition of honorable service at any MFO location. Eligibility for this award will be the satisfactory completion of 12 months (minimum 360 days) of contract service with the MFO in any of its installations.

Located in Chicago, IL, USA, the CSA is headed by an executive committee of American academics who guide the association's efforts to promote the exchange of ideas between scholars, hold annual conferences, and publish an educational journal. Divisions As of 2009, the CSA had the following divisions:Divisions for CSA 2009 Critical Feminist Studies Critical Feminist Studies dedicates itself to work that builds upon, even as it critiques, the institutions and practices of Women's and Gender Studies, focusing in particular on transnational formations and movements, queer and sexuality studies, and politics, practices, and representations. Sarah Rasmusson and Sabrina Starnaman (co-chairs) Cultural Studies and Film The Cultural Studies and Film division pursues the history and cultural politics of cinema and of related media. Approaches include film theory, ethnography, political economy, and textual analysis. Evan Heimlich (chair) Cultural Studies and Literature Socio-historical constructions of certain pleasures, knowledge, and experience in literature are often naturalized under the rubric of \\"fiction.\\" As such, the section on Cultural Studies and Literature calls for a reading of literature that highlights its historical engagement in the social construction of knowledge and interpretation of experience. Helen Kapstein and Caroline H. Yang (co-chairs) Cultural Policy and Legal Studies The cultural policy and legal studies division is concerned with the historical and contemporary processes and institutions regulating and supporting culture in public life. Bridging practice and theory, this division welcomes scholarly and activist work that addresses the wide range of government and industry policies that shape cultural industries in global, national, and local contexts. Particular attention is paid to questions of social inequality and cultural justice. Joseph L. Terry (chair) Environment, Space and Place The CSA Division on Environment, Space and Place spans the union of cultural studies and geography. Approaching culture as spatial allows for powerful analyses of dominance and resistance, style, consumption, identity, ideology, as well as human-environment relations. Space and place‚Äîand representations thereof in various media‚Äîboth result from and reassert force on culture. The Division welcomes discussion in all areas pertaining to environment, space and place, past and present, and encourages interdisciplinary consideration of these topics. Douglas Herman (chair) Media Interventions The Media Interventions Division provides an interdisciplinary forum for scholarship and activism related to alternative, citizens, community, and DIY media. The Division promotes theoretical development in the realm of interventionist media form, content, and practices. In addition, the Division welcomes practitioner perspectives on the intersection between cultural studies, political economy, and prefigurative media politics. Kevin Howley (chair) Pedagogy (In Hiatus) The pedagogy division includes a focus on culture and education, cultural pedagogy, and the curriculum of cultural studies. Pedagogy, broadly conceived and critically understood in this context concerns a wide range of issues taken up in cultural studies including but not limited to mass media, popular culture, subculture, public culture, nationhood, postcolonialism, political economy, identity, race, class, gender, sexuality. Racial and Ethnic Studies The purpose of the Racial and Ethnic Studies Division is to serve as a vehicle to mobilize the production and interrogation of research, theory, teaching, and activism directly concerned with race and ethnicity and their various dimensions (e.g., age, class, culture, economy, education, gender, history, labor, migration, nationality, politics, religion, and sexuality, among many others). Toward these ends, the encouragement of scholarly collaboration across and between disciplinary, methodological, and theoretical boundaries shall be promoted. Matthew W. Hughey (chair) Technology The Cultural Studies Association Technology Division is concerned with critical, indepth examinations of technologies of all kinds. While technology related studies of mediated environments, gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, identity, information, prosthetics, pharmaceuticals, medicine, genomics, distributed consciousness, agricultural technologies and embodiment are among some of the particular contexts investigated, we do not wish to limit the division to the study of media, popular culture and computer technologies. The division is therefore concerned with the critical examination of socio-political contextual analyses of technocultures. The division is particularly interested in the historicizing of technologies old and new, ethnographies of techno-mediated environments whether in rural, urban or digital environments. The division is interested in theory building based in the examination of technologies whether old or new, rural, urban or digital. Radhika Gajjala (chair) and Steve Luber (vice chair) Theories of Cultural Studies The Division of Theories of Cultural Studies is interested in promoting a broad range of theoretical work that includes not only theories of culture and its practices but also theoretical work in other areas such as politics, philosophy, language and literature studies, art, etc. as they intersect with cultural studies. Henry Krips (chair) Visual Culture The CSA Visual Culture Division represents the multi- and inter-disciplinary study of the visual as a primary site for the production and contestation of meaning. The Division is thus concerned with visual forms and visuality, including images, visual media, image technologies, surveillance, theories of spectatorship, visual experience, and visual literacy.

Hickman's name among the American dead of the River Raisin Massacre on the Kentucky War Monument, Frankfort, KY Hickman was born in King and Queen County, Virginia, a son of famous Baptist preacher Reverend William Hickman and his wife Elizabeth Shackelford. William Hickman, a veteran of the Indian Wars as well as of the Revolutionary War, is said to have preached the first Christian sermon in Kentucky. Paschal Hickman served as a private under Gen. Anthony Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. He was an ensign in the 22d Regiment of the Kentucky Militia in 1802, and a lieutenant in 1803. Hickman married Elizabeth Hall in 1797;Register of the Kentucky Historical Society, Volume 7, page xlix he and his wife had three daughters and made their home in Frankfort. Hickman stood tall and weighed 200 pounds. He was the jailer of Franklin County for some years. In August 1812, shortly after the beginning of the War of 1812, Hickman raised a company for Col. John Allen's 1st Kentucky Rifle Regiment and served as its Captain. The regiment served in the campaign under Gen. James Winchester against British Gen. Henry Procter and the Shawnee leader Tecumseh. Hickman was seriously wounded in the American victory at the First Battle of Frenchtown on January 18, 1813 and both of his legs had to be amputated. On January 22, the main British force arrived and Winchester was defeated and captured. Fearing the American army under Gen. William Henry Harrison would now move against him, Procter retreated the next day, taking the uninjured prisoners with him and leaving the seriously wounded behind. No sooner had Procter departed than his Indian allies massacred the American wounded. Paschal Hickman was reportedly dragged from a house and tomahawked to death. At least 68 other Kentuckians also died in the massacre.The History of Franklin County, Kentucky: by L. F.

It is defined as the event where two lipid bilayers approach each other and then merge to form a single continuous structure. In living beings, cells are made of an outer coat made of lipid bilayers; which then cause fusion to take place in events such as fertilization, embryogenesis and even infections by various types of bacteria and viruses. It is therefore an extremely important event to study. From an evolutionary angle, fusion is an extremely controlled phenomenon. Random fusion can result in severe problems to the normal functioning of the human body. Fusion of biological membranes is mediated by proteins. Regardless of the complexity of the system, fusion essentially occurs due to the interplay of various interfacial forces, namely hydration repulsion, hydrophobic attraction and van der Waals forces. center Inter-bilayer forces Lipid bilayers are structures of lipid molecules consisting of a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head group. Therefore, these structures experience all the characteristic Interbilayer forces involved in that regime. =Hydration repulsion= Two hydrated bilayers experience strong repulsion as they approach each other. These forces have been measured using the Surface forces apparatus (S.F.A), an instrument used for measuring forces between surfaces. This repulsion was first proposed by Langmuir and was thought to arise due to water molecules that hydrate the bilayers. Hydration repulsion can thus be defined as the work required in removing the water molecules around hydrophilic molecules (like lipid head groups) in the bilayer system. As water molecules have an affinity towards hydrophilic head groups, they try to arrange themselves around the head groups of the lipid molecules and it becomes very hard to separate this favorable combination. Experiments performed through SFA have confirmed that the nature of this force is an exponential decline. The potential VR is given by :V_R = C_R \\\\cdot \\\\exp\\\\\\\\!\\\\left[{-z\\\\over\\\\lambda_R}\\\\right] where CR (>0) is a measure of the hydration interaction energy for hydrophilic molecules of the given system, ŒªR is a characteristic length scale of hydration repulsion and z is the distance of separation. In other words, it is on distances up to this length that molecules/surfaces fully experience this repulsion. =Hydrophobic attraction= Hydrophobic forces are the attractive entropic forces between any two hydrophobic groups in aqueous media, e.g. the forces between two long hydrocarbon chains in aqueous solutions. The magnitude of these forces depends on the hydrophobicity of the interacting groups as well as the distance separating them (they are found to decrease roughly exponentially with the distance). The physical origin of these forces is a debated issue but they have been found to be long-ranged and are the strongest among all the physical interaction forces operating between biological surfaces and molecules. Due to their long range nature, they are responsible for rapid coagulation of hydrophobic particles in water and play important roles in various biological phenomena including folding and stabilization of macromolecules such as proteins and fusion of cell membranes. The potential VA is given by :V_A = C_A \\\\cdot \\\\exp\\\\\\\\!\\\\left[{-z\\\\over\\\\lambda_A}\\\\right] where CA (<0) is a measure of the hydrophobic interaction energy for the given system, ŒªA is a characteristic length scale of hydrophobic attraction and z is the distance of separation. =van der Waals forces in bilayers= 300px These forces arise due to dipole- dipole interactions (induced/permanent) between molecules of bilayers. As molecules come closer, this attractive force arises due to the ordering of these dipoles; like in the case of magnets that align and attract each other as they approach. This also implies that any surface would experience a van der waals attraction. In bilayers, the form taken by van der Waals interaction potential VVDW is given by :V_{VDW} = -{H\\\\over 12\\\\pi} * \\\\left( {1\\\\over z^2} - {2\\\\over(z+D)^2} + {1\\\\over(z+2D)^2} \\\\right) where H is the Hamaker constant and D and z are the bilayers thickness and the distance of separation respectively. Background For fusion to take place, it has to overcome huge repulsive forces due to the strong hydration repulsion between hydrophilic lipid head groups. However, it has been hard to exactly determine the connection between adhesion, fusion and interbilayer forces. The forces that promote cell adhesion are not the same as the ones that promote membrane fusion. Studies show that by creating a stress on the interacting bilayers, fusion can be achieved without disrupting the interbilayer interactions. It has also been suggested that membrane fusion takes place through a sequence of structural rearrangements that help to overcome the barrier that prevents fusion. Thus, interbilayer fusion takes place through * local approach of membrane * structural rearrangements causing hydration repulsion forces to be overcome * complete merging to form a single entity Interbilayer interactions during membrane fusion When two lipid bilayers approach each other, they experience weak van der Waals attractive forces and much stronger repulsive forces due to hydration repulsion. These forces are normally dominant over the hydrophobic attractive forces between the membranes. Studies done on membrane bilayers using Surface forces apparatus (SFA) indicate that membrane fusion can instantaneously occur when two bilayers are still at a finite distance from each other without them having to overcome the short- range repulsive force barrier. This is attributed to the molecular rearrangements that occur resulting in the bypassing of these forces by the membranes. During fusion, the hydrophobic tails of a small patch of lipids on the cell membrane are exposed to the aqueous phase surrounding them. This results in very strong hydrophobic attractions (which dominate the repulsive force) between the exposed groups leading to membrane fusion. The attractive van der Waals forces play a negligible role in membrane fusion. Thus, fusion is a result of the hydrophobic attractions between internal hydrocarbon chain groups that are exposed to the normally inaccessible aqueous environment. Fusion is observed to start at points on the membranes where the membrane stresses are either the weakest or the strongest. Applications Interbilayer forces play a key role in mediating membrane fusion, which has extremely important biomedical applications. * The most important application of membrane fusion is in the production of hybridomas which are cells that arise as a result of the fusion of antibody-secreting and immortal B-cells. Hybridomas are used in the industry for the production of monoclonal antibodies. * Membrane fusion also has a major role in cancer immunotherapy. Currently, one of the approaches in cancer immunotherapy involves vaccination of dendritic cells which express a specific tumor antigen on their membranes. Instead, the hybrid cells obtained from the fusion of dendritic cells with tumor cells can be used. These hybrids would help in the expression of a range of tumor-associated antigens on their membranes. * Understanding membrane fusion better can also lead to improvements in gene therapy.

It is currently used yearly to host the Arizona State Fair and the Maricopa County Fair, as well as for other events. The Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum, an arena at the fairgrounds, hosted the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association from 1968 to 1992. In 1992, the team moved to what is known today as Talking Stick Resort Arena. The dirt oval track hosted AAA National Championship and USAC National Championship races in 1915 and from 1950 to 1963, and NASCAR Grand National races in 1951, 1955, 1956 and 1960. It was replaced by the Phoenix Raceway in 1964.  History  The fairgrounds was created in 1905, when a volunteer organization, the Arizona Territorial Fair Association, purchased the property and first developed it. At that time, Arizona was not yet a state and had territory status. In 1909, the grounds were purchased by the Territorial Fair Commission, which became the State Fair Commission after statehood in 1912.

She was scuttled at sea on 19 August 1944. She was laid down on 24 May 1941 by Deutsche Werke AG in Kiel as yard number 297, launched on 30 March 1942 and commissioned under Kapit√§nleutnant Gerhard Th√§ter, who remained with her for the rest of her career. U-466 bore a \\"heart & sunburst\\" emblem on her conning tower. She began her service life in the 5th U-boat Flotilla, a training organization, before moving on to the 3rd and 29th flotillas for operational duties. U-466 undertook five war patrols, spending a total of 182 days at sea, with no ships sunk or damaged. She was a member of five wolfpacks. Design German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. U-466 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert GU 343/38‚Äì8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to . The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-466 was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and one twin C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty. Service history =1st and 2nd patrols= The U-boat departed Kiel for her first patrol on 12 January 1943. She made her way to the Atlantic from Kiel through the so-called Faeroes gap - the stretch of water between Iceland and the Faeroe Islands. She arrived in La Pallice in occupied France via a spot southeast of Greenland on the 29th. Her second sortie also took her out into the mid-Atlantic. She departed La Pallice on 17 April 1943 and returned to the same place on 26 May after 40 days at sea. =3rd and 4th patrols= Her third foray took her to a point off Suriname in South America. She was unsuccessfully attacked by US B-18 'Bolo' and B-24 Liberator aircraft on 23 July 1943. A day later, she was attacked by a B-24 which dropped five depth charges. This time the boat sustained damage. Five men were wounded, including the first officer. The boat's fourth patrol was cut short when she was badly damaged following an attack by escort vessels from Convoy MKS 29. The submarine returned to her French base on 19 November 1943 after only 35 days away. =5th patrol= Her fifth patrol involved the U-boat's passage to Toulon in southern France. This voyage included trafficking the heavily defended Strait of Gibraltar. She passed the Rock on 22 March 1944 and arrived in Toulon on the 30th, having been attacked by the British submarine . The vessel fired four torpedoes at the U-boat; they all missed. =Loss= U-466 was severely damaged in a United States Army Air Forces raid on Toulon. As a result, she was scuttled on 19 August 1944 following the Allied invasion of southern France (Operation Dragoon). She was the last U-boat to be scuttled in the Mediterranean. =Wolfpacks= U-466 took part in six wolfpacks, namely. * Haudegen (26‚Äì29 January 1943) * Amsel (22 April - 3 May 1943) * Amsel 4 (3‚Äì6 May 1943) * Rhein (7‚Äì10 May 1943) * Elbe 2 (10‚Äì13 May 1943) * Schill (25 October - 10 November 1943) See also * Mediterranean U-boat Campaign (World War II) References Bibliography  External links * *Captain Gerhard Th√§ter German Type VIIC submarines World War II submarines of Germany 1942 ships U-boats commissioned in 1942 U-boats scuttled in 1944 Ships built in Kiel Maritime incidents in August 1944 ","title":"German submarine U-466"},{"id":"20639189","text":"KFIZ (1450 kHz, \\"News-Talk 1450\\") is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.

The studios and offices are on Winnebago Drive and the transmitter is off West Scott Street. KFIZ is among Wisconsin's oldest commercial radio stations, beginning experimental broadcasts in 1922. Programming The station features local talk, farming and information shows on weekday mornings, followed by syndicated programs the rest of the day. National hosts include Sean Hannity, Dave Ramsey, Mark Levin, Jim Bohannon, Clark Howard and Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. On weekdays, local news updates are heard every hour, with world and national news from Fox News Radio. KFIZ is a member of the Wisconsin Radio Network for regional news and sports programming. Sports programming on KFIZ includes local high school football, high school basketball, and college basketball, plus Major League Baseball as part of the Milwaukee Brewers Radio Network. KFIZ also airs NBA basketball as part of the Milwaukee Bucks Radio Network. On weekends in the fall, KFIZ carries Green Bay Packers NFL football as a member of the Packers Radio Network. KFIZ used CNN Radio for its national news coverage in the 1990s. Around 2007, KFIZ switched its affiliation to Fox News Radio. History KFIZ was founded in May 1922 by Fond du Lac businessman Oscar A. Huelsman. It was one of the first commercial radio stations in Wisconsin. (WHA in Madison is Wisconsin's first radio station, beginning in 1915 as a Morse Code station, but it is owned by the University of Wisconsin and never had a commercial broadcasting license.) KFIZ is one of the few American radio stations east of the Mississippi River with a call sign beginning with a \\"K.\\" Nearly all radio stations east of the Mississippi have call letters starting with a \\"W,\\" while \\"K\\" call signs are usually found west of the Mississippi. But KFIZ traces its history back to the earliest days of broadcasting, when these rules were not strictly followed. KFIZ began experimental broadcasting at 1100 kilocycles with 100 watts of power. Licensed operation began in July 1923. In 1928, the station changed frequencies to 1120 kHz and in 1930 it switched to 1420 kHz, still at 100 watts. In 1942, KFIZ moved to its current frequency of 1450 kHz and in the mid-1940s the station increased signal power to 250 watts. KFIZ currently broadcasts with 1,000 watts of power. Ownership KFIZ was founded in May 1922 by local automobile dealer Oscar A. Huelsman, as a way to advertise his cars. Soon afterward, the Fond du Lac Commonwealth Reporter assumed joint ownership of the station. KFIZ was owned by Reporter Printing Co. in the mid-1930s. The KFIZ Broadcasting Company acquired the station in May 1946 and owned the station through the early 1960s. In November 1986, Wisconsin Cablevision & Radio Co., Inc. completed a merger by transferring the license for this station to Donald G. Jones and Wisconsin Cablevision Inc., a partnership doing business as the Wisconsin Cablevision Partnership. The deal was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on December 19, 1986, and the transaction was completed on December 28, 1986.

Zhang was then defending Heng Prefecture (ÊÅÜÂ∑û, in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), and Wang Wujun persuaded him to submit to Tang. Zhang agreed and submitted to Tang with the five prefectures that he controlled, and turned against remaining Yan forces. Emperor Xuanzong's grandson Emperor Daizong, then emperor of Tang, bestowed the imperial surname of Li on Zhang, and Zhang thereafter became known as Li Baochen. Li Baochen was allowed to retain control over the territory he had, which was organized into Chengde Circuit, with Li Baochen as its military governor (Jiedushi). As Wang contributed in the subsequent campaign that cleared the territory, he was created the Prince of Weichuan. As Li Baochen grew old and intended to pass the territory to his son Li Weiyue, he began killing a number of officers that he feared Li Weiyue could not control. However, as he took a great liking to Wang's son Wang Shizhen and gave Wang Shizhen his daughter in marriage, and Wang Shizhen subsequently gained Li Baochen's trust as well as insider information at LI Baochen's headquarters, Wang Wujun escaped the fate of many of his colleagues.  Service under Li Weiyue  Meanwhile, Li Baochen had also been in alliance with several other military governors who were also ruling their circuits independently from the imperial regime and intending to pass their realms to their descendants ‚Äî Li Zhengji the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), Tian Chengsi the military governor of Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), and Liang Chongyi the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei). When Li Baochen and Li Zhengji, in succession, died in 781, then-emperor Emperor Dezong (Emperor Daizong's son), wanting to break up the warlords' power, refused to let Li Weiyue and Li Zhengji's son Li Na inherit their fathers' positions. Li Weiyue, Li Na, Tian Chengsi's nephew and successor Tian Yue, and Liang thus prepared for war against the imperial regime.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 226. Liang was quickly defeated by Li Xilie and committed suicide, while imperial forces inflicted serious damage on Tian's and Li Na's forces. Meanwhile, Zhu Tao the acting military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing) attacked Li Weiyue from the north and was quickly able to persuade two key Chengde officers, Zhang Xiaozhong the prefect of Yi Prefecture (ÊòìÂ∑û, in modern Shijiazhuang) and Kang Rizhi () the prefect of Zhao Prefecture (Ë∂ôÂ∑û, in modern Shijiazhuang), to submit their respective prefectures turn against Li Weiyue. When Li Weiyue tried to counterattack in spring 782, Zhu and Zhang's joint forces defeated him at Shulu (ÊùüÈπø, in modern Shijiazhuang), forcing him to flee back to Chengde's capital Heng Prefecture. It was said that during the Battle of Shulu, Wang Wujun, serving as Li Weiyue's forward commander and believing that Li Weiyue was already suspicious of him, decided not to fight to the best of his ability, and that this led to the defeat.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 227. After the defeat, Li Weiyue was even more suspicious of Wang, but his advisors pointed out that there was no one other than Wang who would be capable to command the army. Li Weiyue thus commissioned Wang, assisted by Wei Changning (), to attack Zhao Prefecture, and put Wang Shizhen in charge of security at headquarters. Wang Wujun was relieved to get to leave Heng Prefecture, and once he exited the city, initially wanted to flee to Zhang. Wei pointed out that Emperor Dezong had issued an edict promising to give the offices that Li Weiyue wanted to whoever would cut off Li Weiyue's head and advocated for an attack on Li Weiyue. Wang Wujun thus notified Wang Shizhen and involved Li Weiyue's close associate Xie Zun () in the plot at well. He made a surprise attack against Heng Prefecture, and Wang Shizhen and Xie opened the city gates to welcome him. Wang Wujun killed Li Weiyue and his associates and surrendered to the imperial government.  Rebellion against Emperor Dezong  Emperor Dezong, in the aftermaths, divided Chengde's seven prefectures into three smaller circuits ‚Äî with Zhang Xiaozhong receiving three prefectures and the title of military governor of the newly created Yidingcang Circuit (ÊòìÂÆöÊªÑ, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei, later renamed Yiwu Circuit (), while Wang Wujun and Kang Rizhi received two prefectures each with lesser titles of military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi), of Hengji () and Shenzhao (Ê∑±Ë∂ô, both headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang). This displeased both Zhu Tao and Wang ‚Äî as Zhu had wanted Emperor Dezong to give him Shen Prefecture (Ê∑±Â∑û, in modern Hengshui, Hebei), which went to Kang instead (Emperor Dezong gave Zhu two prefectures on paper, De (Âæ∑Â∑û, in modern Dezhou, Shandong) and Di (Ê££Â∑û, in modern Binzhou, Shandong), both then still held by Li Na, and Wang believed that Emperor Dezong had reneged on the promise to reward him with the positions that Li Weiyue had wanted. He was further fearful when he received orders to provide Zhu's army with food and Ma Sui's army (which was then attacking Tian Yue) with horses, believing that Emperor Dezong might be using those orders to divert his power and getting ready to attack him next. Tian, hearing of Zhu's disaffection, sent emissaries to Zhu to persuade him to turn against the imperial forces and aid him. Zhu agreed, and in turn sent emissaries to Wang, persuading him to join the alliance as well and agreeing to give him Shen Prefecture, which Zhu occupied at the time. Wang was pleased, and agreed to join him and Tian. (Zhu also tried to persuade Zhang to join the alliance, but Zhang refused.) When Emperor Dezong sent emissaries to order Zhu and Wang to advance south against Tian, Wang arrested the imperial emissaries and delivered them to Zhu, thus openly turning against imperial authority. Zhu, as promised, transferred control of Shen Prefecture to Wang, while sending forces to join Wang's in sieging Kang at Zhao Prefecture. However, by this point, Tian was in desperate straits under siege from imperial forces commanded by Ma, Li Baozhen, and Li Qiu () at his capital Wei Prefecture (). Zhu and Wang thus advanced south to relieve him, and as they arrived, so did additional imperial forces commanded by Li Huaiguang. Against Ma's advice of waiting until his soldiers had enough rest, Li Huaiguang decided to battle Zhu and Wang immediately. He had initial successes, but Wang cut his soldiers off from each other with a charge, leading to a major defeat for the imperial forces. Zhu and Wang then tried to cut off the imperial troops escape, but Ma then promised to request that Emperor Dezong put Zhu in charge of the entire region north of the Yellow River. Despite Wang's stern opposition, Zhu believed him and did not pursue imperial forces further, so the imperial forces were able to withdraw over a river from Wei Prefecture, and were able to take up a posture against the rebel forces, thus putting the armies into a stalemate. Zhu, seeing that he had been tricked by Ma, apologized to Wang, but Wang, while accepting the apology, thereafter resented Zhu. In the aftermaths of the imperial forces' defeat, Tian was grateful to Zhu, and offered to subjugate himself and Wang to Zhu ‚Äî in effect, offering the emperor title to Zhu. Zhu declined, crediting Wang rather than himself for the victory. At the suggestion of Zhu's staff member Li Ziqian () and Wang's staff member Zheng Ru (), they decided to each claim a princely title to show independence from imperial authority, but keep Tang's era name in order not to completely break from Tang. On December 9, 782,http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms- bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna;=%AD%F0&king;=%BCw%A9v&reign;=%AB%D8%A4%A4&yy;=3&ycanzi;=&mm;=11‚ÖÜ=1&dcanzi;= in an elaborate ceremony, Zhu claimed the title of Prince of Ji; Wang claimed the title of Prince of Zhao; Tian claimed the title of Prince of Wei; and they issued a letter offering Li Na the title of Prince of Qi. They also established administrations with governmental structures paralleling the Tang imperial government to further show independence, although the titles were intentionally different from Tang's to show some subordination.  As self- proclaimed Prince of Zhao  Meanwhile, though, as Zhu Tao's and Wang Wujun's troops were continuing to battle Tang imperial troops on Tian Yue's soil, all three of them were becoming financially drained. They pinned their hopes on alliance with Li Xilie, who had even greater pretensions, who was then ruling Huaixi Circuit (Ê∑ÆË•ø, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan), which was then wealthy. They, along with Li Na, thus sent emissaries to Huaixi, suggesting to Li Xilie that he take imperial title. Li Xilie did not do so immediately, but began to claim titles greater than the ones bestowed him by Emperor Dezong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 228. (Li Xilie would eventually declare himself to be the emperor of a new state of Chu in spring 784, although without further pledge of allegiance by the four.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 229. Meanwhile, in summer 783, an incident would occur to further to erode the alliance between Zhu and Wang. The imperial general Li Sheng had wanted to cut off the supply lines between Lulong and Weibo by capturing Lulong's Zhuo (Ê∂øÂ∑û, in modern Baoding) and Mo (Ëé´Â∑û, in modern Cangzhou) Prefectures, and therefore joined forces with Zhang Xiaozhong's son Zhang Shengyun () in sieging Zhu's general Zhang Jingji () at Qingwan (Ê∏ÖËãë, in modern Baoding). Zhu left his general Ma Shi () at Weibo and personally relieved Qingwan, defeating Li Sheng and Zhang Shengyun and forcing them to withdraw back to Yi Prefecture, under Zhang Xiaozhong's control. Upon defeating Li Sheng and Zhang Shengyun, however, Zhu did not immediately return to Weibo, and Wang sent his subordinate Song Duan () to Zhu, urging him to return to Weibo as soon as possible. When Song met Zhu, Song was harsh in his words, and Zhu threw a fit of anger‚Äîcausing Wang to be fearful and to apologize to Ma in person. Zhu's angers subsided, and it was said that he continued to treat Wang as an ally, but that Wang's secret resentment toward Zhu grew even more. Wang subsequently responded to an overture by Li Baozhen into forming a secret alliance, although he also continued in alliance with Zhu, Tian, and Li Na. In fall 783, soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (Ê∂áÂéü, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), then at Chang'an in preparation for deployment to the Weibo front, were angry that they were not given sufficient rewards, and they mutinied, forcing Emperor Dezong to flee to Fengtian (Â•âÂ§©, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). The mutineers supported Zhu Tao's brother Zhu Ci ‚Äî who had previously served as a major imperial general but who been forced into retirement after Zhu Tao turned against the imperial government ‚Äî as their leader. Zhu Ci subsequently declared himself the emperor of a new state of Qin, and he created Zhu Tao crown prince. Zhu Tao, upon receiving the communique from Zhu Ci, immediately spread the news to the other circuits in hopes that they would declare for Zhu Ci as well. Upon news of Emperor Dezong's flight to Fengtian arriving at the imperial camp at Weibo, the imperial troops scattered, with Li Huaiguang heading for Fengtian to aid Emperor Dezong, and Ma Sui, Li Baozhen, and Li Qiu returning to their respective circuits. Upon the imperial troops' withdrawal, Zhu Tao and Wang also withdrew to their own circuits. Meanwhile, Zhu Tao, who had earlier married a daughter of a Huige khan, requested aid from Huige. Huige sent 3,000 soldiers to aid Zhu Tao in his efforts to further advance south to capture the eastern capital Luoyang. However, by this point, Li Baozhen had persuaded Wang to turn against Zhu Tao ‚Äî pointing out that if Zhu Tao and Zhu Ci were successful together, Wang would be under their control and further that Zhu's title of Prince of Ji showed implicit ambition to possess Wang's Ji Prefecture (ÂÜÄÂ∑û, in modern Hengshui). Emperor Dezong also sent messengers to Tian and Li Na, urging them to turn against Zhu Tao as well, and when Emperor Dezong declared a general pardon in spring 784 ‚Äî the scope of which included even Zhu Tao, Wang, Tian, Li Na, and Li Xilie and implicitly promising them that if they submitted to nominal imperial authority again, he would not dare to interfere with them again ‚Äî Wang, Tian, and Li Na all renounced their self-claimed royal titles.  Resubmission to Emperor Dezong  As a result of Wang Wujun's removal of his own royal title, Emperor Dezong recommissioned him as the military governor of Chengde Circuit ‚Äî adding Kang Rizhi's two prefectures to his territory, although not Zhang Xiaozhong's three prefectures. He also soon made Wang the military governor of Lulong Circuit as well, intending to use Wang's ambitions against Zhu Tao.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 230. Emperor Dezong also made Wang an honorary chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), made him Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies), and created him the Prince of Langye. However, Zhu, unaware of this development, began his plan of march toward Luoyang in early 784. He went through Chengde and Weibo with great ceremonies of welcome from Wang and Tian Yue. Eventually, when Zhu reached Yongji (Ê∞∏Êøü, in modern Handan) and requested that Tian join him in advancing to Luoyang, Tian refused. This drew Zhu's anger, and he divided his troops, along with Huige troops, in attacking several different Weibo cities. Tian put up his defense at Wei Prefecture, waiting for aid; while he was doing so, he was assassinated and succeeded by his cousin Tian Xu (Tian Chengsi's son), and while Zhu rejoiced at the news and Tian Xu initially made overtures to Zhu, Tian Xu eventually continued Tian Yue's policies, continuing to be allied with imperial forces under Li Baozhen and Ma Sui. Zhu thus continued to siege two primary cities of Weibo ‚Äî with Zhu himself sieging Bei Prefecture (Ë≤ùÂ∑û, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), defended by the Weibo general Xing Caojun (), and Ma Shi sieging Wei Prefecture, but could not capture either. Meanwhile, Li Baozhen and Wang had joined their forces and advanced into Weibo territory. Hearing the news, Ma Shi lifted the siege on Bei Prefecture and joined forces with Zhu. When Zhu prepared to battle Wang and Li Baozhen the next day, Ma Shi, citing the fact that his soldiers at just travelled a substantial distance, requested a few days of rest. However, the Huige general assisting Zhu, as well as Yang Bu () and Cai Xiong, advocated for immediate attack. The next day, May 29, 784,http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms- bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna;=%AD%F0&king;=%BCw%A9v&reign;=%BF%B3%A4%B8&yy;=1&ycanzi;=&mm;=5‚ÖÜ=6&dcanzi;= the armies battled, and the overly confident Zhu was defeated by Wang's and Li Baozhen's forces. Over 10,000 of his 30,000 soldiers were killed, and over 10,000 deserted. Zhu, with a few thousand remaining soldiers, feared annihilation at Wang's and Li Baozhen's hands and fled to De Prefecture. Wang and Li Baozhen were unable to give chase because of dense fog. After defeating Zhu, Wang returned to Heng Prefecture and declined the additional title of military governor of Lulong, and Emperor Dezong agreed. Soon, with Wang continuing to attack Zhu, Zhu resubmitted to Tang authority as well.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 231. Meanwhile, in the aftermaths of Wang's and Li Baozhen's victory over Zhu, De and Di Prefectures, which Zhu had taken over, surrendered to Wang and were incorporated into Chengde, formally under the command of Wang's son Wang Shizhen. By 790, however, Zhao Gao () the prefect of Di Prefecture had offended Wang and was refusing Wang's summons. Meanwhile, there were rumors that Li Na, whom Tian Xu's older brother Tian Chao () served under as prefect of Qi Prefecture (ÈΩäÂ∑û, in modern Jinan, Shandong), was planning to escort Tian Chao back to Weibo to vie for control of Weibo Circuit. Tian Xu feared this, and, under suggestion by his staff member Sun Guangzuo (), he sent gifts to Li Na to please him and persuade him to send Tian Chao to Chang'an ‚Äî and further suggested Li Na to accept Zhao's submission. Li Na therefore accepted Zhao's surrender and took Di Prefecture, despite Wang's attacks. Tian further cemented the relationship with Li Na by sending Sun to Pinglu's headquarters at Yun Prefecture (), announcing an imperial edict (which Tian Xu had forged) declaring Di Prefecture to be part of Pinglu Circuit. In anger, Wang Wujun sent his son Wang Shiqing () to attack Weibo's Bei Prefecture (Ë≤ùÂ∑û, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), occupying four counties of Bei Prefecture. In winter 790, Emperor Dezong, wanting to put an end to the campaigns between these circuits, ordered Li Na to return Di Prefecture to Chengde; Li Na demanded that Wang return the four counties of Bei Prefecture to Weibo first. Wang did so, and subsequently, Li Na returned Di Prefecture to Chengde.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 233. In 792, Li Na died, and his son Li Shigu succeeded him. Wang Wujun felt that he could take advantage of Li Shigu's youth, and therefore sent an army to De and Di Prefectures, readying an attack on two Pinglu forts ‚Äî GeduoThe character for Duo is not in Unicode. (in modern Binzhou) and Sancha (). Li Shigu sent Zhao to defend against the expected attack. Emperor Dezong sent eunuchs to order them to stop fighting, and thereafter Wang withdrew. Meanwhile, in 793, after an incident when Zhang Xiaozhong's son Zhang Shenglin (), whose older brother Zhang Shengyun () had succeeded their father Zhang Xiaozhong as military governor of Yiwu in 791 after Zhang Xiaozhong's death and who was also a son-in-law of Li Na's, publicly cursed Wang, Wang submitted an accusation against Zhang Shenglin for disrespect. Emperor Dezong ordered that Zhang Shenglin be removed from his office as military prefect of Hai Prefecture (Êµ∑Â∑û, in modern Lianyungang, Jiangsu) and detained. However, Wang used this excuse to attack Yiwu, capturing Yifeng (Áæ©Ë±ê, in modern Baoding) and seizing 10,000 people. Only after repeated apologies by Zhang Shengyun did Wang withdraw.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 234. In 794, when Li Baozhen died, his son Li Jian () tried to take control of his Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi) and sought material aid (in forms of a loan) from Wang. Wang firmly rebuked him, and subsequently, without support from neighboring circuits or Zhaoyi's own officers, Li Jian gave up his attempt to seize the circuit. In 796, Emperor Dezong bestowed on Wang the greater honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 235. Wang died in 801 and was posthumously honored with the same ceremony that had been used for the great general Hun Jian. Wang Shizhen succeeded him.

She sang a wide repertoire that encompassed bel canto roles, Italian and French grand opera, verismo operas, and the German operas of Richard Wagner. She became particularly associated with the roles of Margherita in Boito's Mefistofele and the title role in Ponchielli's La Gioconda; two roles which she performed in opera houses throughout Italy. She is best remembered today for originating the roles of Desdemona in Giuseppe Verdi's Otello (1887) and Tigrana in Giacomo Puccini's Edgar (1889).Elizabeth Forbes: \\"Romilda Pantaleoni\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed December 10, 2008), (subscription access) Universally admired for her acting skills as well as her singing abilities, Pantaleoni was compared by several critics to the great Italian stage actress Eleonora Duse.Biography of Romilda Pantaleoni on Operissimo.com (in German). Accessed 10 December 2008. Biography Pantaleoni was born into a musical family in Udine, Italy. Her father, Luigi Pantaleoni (?-1872), was a composer and her brother, Adriano Pantaleoni (1837‚Äì1908), also became a successful opera singer. She studied singing in Milan under R. Rossi, B. Prati, and Francesco Lamperti before making her professional opera d√©but at the Teatro Carcano in Jacopo Foroni's Margherita in 1868. She appeared in operas throughout Italy over the next fifteen years, including performances in Rome, Genoa, Modena, Naples, Turin, and Brescia. Her repertoire included such roles as Mathilde in Rossini's Guillaume Tell, Paolina in Donizetti's Poliuto, S√©lika in Meyerbeer's L'Africaine, Marguerite in Gounod's Faust, and Elsa in Wagner's Lohengrin. She also was known for her portrayals of Verdi heroines including: Leonora in both Il trovatore and La forza del destino, Amelia in Un ballo in maschera, Elisabeth de Valois in Don Carlos and the title role in Aida. In 1874 Pantaleoni sang the role of Isabella in the world premiere of Ant√¥nio Carlos Gomes' Salvator Rosa at the Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa. The following year she sang the role of Margherita in Boito's Mefistofele at the Teatro Regio di Torino. Her performance was greatly admired and is considered by music historians to be one of the reasons that Boito's opera enjoyed a renewed popularity after its less than enthusiastic reception in 1868. In 1884 she appeared in several opera with the Vienna State Opera, the only time that she performed outside of Italy. Pantaleoni joined the roster at La Scala in 1883, making her debut in the title role of La Gioconda. She performed numerous roles at La Scala over the next eight years including Valentine in Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots (1884), Anna in Puccini's Le villi (1885), the title role in the world premiere of Amilcare Ponchielli's Marion Delorme (1885), Desdemona in the first performance of Verdi's Otello (1887), and Tigrana in the world premiere of Puccini's Edgar (1889) among others. She retired from the stage in 1891 after the death of conductor Franco Faccio, who was her longtime lover. Her last performance was as Santuzza in La Scala's first production of Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. She died in Milan.

The race starts on the ski slopes of Mount Baker, a volcano, and ends at Marine Park in Fairhaven, on the shore of Bellingham Bay. The seven legs of the race are: cross country skiing, downhill skiing or snowboard, running, road biking, canoeing, cyclocross biking, and finally kayaking. The Ski to Sea Race is managed by Whatcom Events, with a race committee that includes a race director, an operations assistant, one or two chairmen to oversee each event, a volunteer coordinator along with nearly 900 volunteers.  History  The Ski to Sea has its origins in the Mount Baker Marathons of 1911‚Äì1913.Mt. Baker Marathon inspired Ski to Sea. Bellingham Herald, October 20, 2003. The early races ran from the city of Bellingham to the top of Mount Baker and back. Racers could pick between two routes to Mt. Baker, the Glacier trail or the Deming route. If choosing Glacier, a special train transported racers to that location. If choosing Deming, racers would drive to Heisler's ranch. Once at either of these two destinations, racers continued on to the Mt. Baker summit by foot. The event was canceled after a runner fell into a crevasse.Grueling outdoor adventure race blends sportsmanship with competitiveness. USA Today, May 26, 2010. The Ski to Sea would be a toned-down version of those races where people race from the ski slopes of Mount Baker to Bellingham Bay. The race was first proposed in a letter written in 1966 from Fred Elsethagen to Bill Herb, the president of the Bellingham Chamber of Commerce. (December 12, 1966) The name of the race came from the Bellingham slogan of \\"Sea to Ski in Sixty Minutes\\", referring to the proximity of Mount Baker's ski slopes to Bellingham, which sits on a bay of the Strait of Georgia. The first official Ski to Sea race premiered 1973 as a side event to \\"Blossom Time\\". The first race had 177 people racing in a total of fifty teams. During the first four years, the legs of the race were run separately, and their times added up to produce a total team time; this left racers and spectators waiting several hours after the race concluded to find out who had won. Since 1977 the race has been a continuous event, with the exception of 2008 when the canoe leg was cancelled because of unsafe river conditions. By 1977, the Ski to Sea Race had become so popular that the entire Blossom Time festival was renamed Blossom Time Ski to Sea. Six years later, \\"Blossom Time\\" was removed and the event became known simply as the Ski to Sea. Even the parade was renamed the Ski to Sea Parade. Today the Ski to Sea is considered an entire weekend-long event that is centered on the race. More than 300 teams with over two thousand racers participate in the race. Tens of thousands of spectators gather along the sidelines to watch and participate in events throughout Bellingham, Ferndale and Fairhaven near the finish line at Marine Park.  Legs  The original letter written by Fred Elsethagen recommended nine events: skiing, mountaineering, canoeing, kayaking, horseback riding, water skiing, running, fishing boat and sailboat. Over the years all but four (mountaineering, horse back riding, fishing boat, waterskiing) of these events have been used, and only one not recommended (bicycling) has been added. When the Ski to Sea debuted in 1973, the race covered in three legs: downhill skiing, bicycling, and canoeing or kayaking the Nooksack River. Over the next twenty years, the Ski to Sea would grow to seven legs covering . It has also become a continuous event, with a token (wrist-band or timing chip) passed from one teammate to the other at the end of each leg. Though the race has always kept the various legs in the same order, over the years most legs had been modified in one form or another. Some legs have changed the methods used to complete them, and most have adjusted their lengths on at least one occasion. The bicycling leg has changed length a total of nine times with the shortest distance being and the longest being . In 2015, low snowpack forced the replacement of the ski legs with new alpine running and mountain biking legs, for a total of two running and three cycling legs. The new running leg was added at the beginning of the race, before the established road running leg, and the new mountain bike leg was added at the end, after the kayak leg. The standard format was returned to the following year. = Cross country skiing = Cross country skiing, added in 1979, kicks off the Race. This leg consists of two figure-eight loops, beginning and ending at the upper Mount Baker Ski area. It has been extended from one mile in the first three years to four and a half miles at present. = Downhill skiing/snowboarding = Downhill skiing is one of the original components of the race. Skiers hike uphill approximately 800 feet and then ski back to near their starting point. = Running = Added in 1975, the third stage of the race is an eight-mile (13 km) foot race down the Mount Baker Highway, from the upper Mount Baker ski area to the Shuksan Department of Transportation station. The runners drop over two thousand feet in elevation. To further the difficulties, the racers are running on hard asphalt. The running leg has been the most unchanged of the events. The first two years' running leg was five miles (8 km) long. The third year running was seven miles (11 km). The fourth year, in 1979, the running leg was extended to eight miles (13 km) and has remained unchanged since that time. = Bicycling = Bicycling, the longest leg of the race, was one of the original components of the 1973 event. The bicycle leg passes through the towns of Glacier and Maple Falls, and leaves the Mount Baker Highway for Silver Lake Road. The bicycle leg finishes on the banks of the Nooksack River in the town of Everson, where the canoe leg picks up. The bicycling leg has changed distance on eight different occasions. It debuted at , and would later grow to a maximum distance of . Since 1987 the bicycling leg has been long. In 2010, the distance will again be as the bikes go north from Maple Falls on Silver Lake Road. = Canoeing = Canoeing was one of the original events from the 1973 race. The canoe leg is the second longest, and covers . When first introduced in 1973, this leg allowed both two-man canoes and one-man kayaks. After sea kayaks were made the only mode of transportation for the final leg of the race, they were eliminated as an option for the Nooksack River leg of the race. This leg of the race is the only leg with two racer and starts in Everson and ends at Hovander Park in Ferndale. The canoe leg was canceled in 2008 (and almost canceled in 1997) because of the unsafe level of the Nooksack River. This is the only leg to have ever been canceled, not counting the 2020 cancellation of the entire race due to COVID-19.. Racecenter, March 23, 2020. This is possibly the most dangerous part of the race. Though no one has ever been killed in the 37 years of the Ski to Sea, Lorri Rasmussen of Bellingham was killed in 2002 while training for the race.Woman who drowned in Nooksack River ID'd. Associated Press, May 10, 2002. Her canoe tipped and she was swept up in a log jam. = Cyclocross biking = Added in 1990, the Cyclocross bike leg stretches from the banks of the Nooksack river in Hovander Park to Squalicum Harbor on Bellingham Bay. The course was updated in 2011 to be approximately long and now includes a pre- ride on the Saturday before the race. = Kayaking Bellingham Bay = Kayakers in 2007. The Bellingham Bay leg was added in 1980, and it was made exclusively a kayaking event in 1992. The final leg of the event that stretched across Bellingham Bay was added to tie in the Ski to Sea name and to add a more exciting finish to the race. Originally this leg used Hobie cats, though sailboats were allowed in 1981. In 1990 the choice of sailboats or sea kayaks was added for this leg of the Ski to Sea Race. Two years later, the leg was restricted to kayaks, because wind to move sailboats is unreliable on Bellingham Bay. Today, kayakers paddle across Bellingham Bay from Squalicum Harbor on the north side of Bellingham to Marine Park in Fairhaven on the south side of Bellingham, then beach their kayaks and run across land to ring a bell at the finish line.  The baton  The first several races used an actual baton. Later, necklace medallions were added and racers had to place the medallion over around the neck of their teammate as they tagged off to the next event. For many years, a sweatband, worn on the wrist, took the place of the medallion. Racers would pass the sweatband to their teammate racing the next leg at the transition points. In recent years, the race has used transponder timing and teams have carried an electronic timing chip attached to a lanyard. The chip is swiped at the start of the race and is carried by the lanyard that is traded off from one teammate to the other at the exchange of each leg. At the transition point for each leg of the race, the chip is swiped again to register the end time of the previous leg, and the start of the next. The chip has to be swiped at the end of the race by the kayaker after ringing the ceremonial bell. For the 2011 edition of the race, the chip was mounted to a neoprene wristband instead of a lanyard. From 2012, the race has returned to chips on the wristbands.  Divisions  Although everyone races in the same Ski to Sea Race, teams registered in eight divisions: Competitive, Whatcom County, Recreational, High School, Masters, Veterans, Family, and Corporate. Three of the divisions (Competitive, Whatcom County, and Recreational) are further divided by \\"Open\\" (three or fewer females), \\"Mixed\\" (four or more females), and \\"Female\\" (women only). Typically almost half of the teams register in the Recreational division, and about a quarter in the Competitive divisions. Since the divisions were established almost every winning team has come from the Competitive division, with winning teams from 1987 and 2016Beavers Tree Service captures historic Ski to Sea win . Bellingham Herald May 29, 2016. coming from the Whatcom County division. In the past, when different types of boats were allowed in the water events, further subdivisions existed accordingly.  2020 Cancellation  On March 23, 2020, the organization responsible for organizing the Ski to Sea race announced that the race scheduled for May 24, 2020, would be cancelled due to the COVID-19 outbreak. This was the only time that the race was cancelled since its inception in 1973. . Racecenter, March 23, 2020.

Distribution and habitat Caesio xanthonota is widely distributed throughout the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea and Persian Gulf excluded, to Indonesia in the western Pacific Ocean.http://eol.org/pages/1012926/details#distribution It lives in mid-water in deep lagoons and close to external reefs from the surfaceto 50 m deep.http://www.fishbase.org/Summary/SpeciesSummary.php?id=927 Diet It feeds on zooplankton, so it is a planktivore.Lieske & Myers,Coral reef fishes, Princeton University Press, 2009, Behaviour The yellowback fusilier is diurnal, and lives in groups and forms schools with other caesionids such as Caesio teres. Often, confusion between these two species occurs, thus Caesio teres has a variable yellow zone which changes with the age. This yellow zone starts from the anterior part of the dorsal fin and draws a diagonal to the low part of the caudal peduncle.

Featuring the band's original incarnation comprising brothers John and Rob Wright, the album was released independently on LP in 1982. Nomeansno reissued a remastered version the album in 1992 on their own Wrong Records imprint, coupled with the tracks from their Betrayal, Fear, Anger, Hatred EP of 1981. Recorded after a period of gigging as a two-piece lineup with bass, drums, and vocals, the album reflects the band's early live sound, with minimal guitar overdubs. Nomeansno later expanded their sound with the addition of guitarist Andy Kerr and developed a following after signing with the Alternative Tentacles imprint, but Mama remained popular with fans and critics. Writing for Trouser Press, critic Ira Robbins described Mama and the band's early 7\\"s as \\"Devo on a jazz trip, Mot√∂rhead after art school, or Wire on psychotic steroids.\\" Background and recording Brothers Rob and John Wright began recording music in their parents' basement in 1979. They adopted the moniker Nomeansno and recorded songs with traditional rock arrangements, including guitar, bass, drums, keyboards, and vocals. Some of these recordings were issued as the \\"Look, Here Come the Wormies / SS Social Service\\" split 7\\" (1980) and the Betrayal, Fear, Anger, Hatred EP (1981), while others appeared on various compilations throughout the next few decades. In 1981, the brothers began performing as a live duo comprising bass and drums, played by Rob and John respectively, while both sang. The songs from this incarnation featured hardcore punk influence, but their sound remained experimental. John Wright later reflected on their early sound and its development without a guitar: The band recorded some of these songs at Key Studios in Victoria in 1982 with engineer Sandra Lange. Rob Wright added very minimal guitar overdubs, and John Wright additional keyboards. Tracks 1 through 8 on Mama were taken from the Key Studios session, while the final track, \\"Living in D√©tente,\\" was taken from the brothers' home recordings. The Key Studios session also yielded the outtake \\"No Means No.\\" This song was later reissued on compilations, including Over a Century of Vivisection and Anti-Vivisection (How Much Longer?) in 1992 and All Your Ears Can Hear in 2007. Release The album was originally self- released by the band in a limited run of 500 copies. The cover featured a Rorschach test and lettering by future Nomeansno member Andy Kerr. The band distributed the copies themselves, and the album quickly went out of print. With the original reels from the recording session thought to be lost, Nomeansno later issued a cassette version made from a vinyl copy of the album to be sold through mail order. As the band gained an international audience through touring and further albums, original copies of the Mama LP became highly-sought collectors items. The original reels were ultimately rediscovered, and the tracks were remastered in 1992 at Whipping Post Studio in Vancouver. The band issued a CD version of the album, packaged with the four tracks from the Betrayal, Fear, Anger, Hatred EP, on their own Wrong Records that year. An additional CD re-release was issued in 2004, which included bonus video footage of the Wrights performing \\"Rich Guns\\" and \\"Forget Your Life\\" on public broadcast television in 1981. Wrong Records reissued further LP versions in 2012 and 2013. Reception Mama was largely ignored by the music press upon its initial release. Critics generally received the album well retrospectively, while hedging that it anticipated, but did not fulfill, the band's potential. Trouser Press critic Ira Robbins retrospectively praised the album as \\"an accomplished and impressive display of taut and direct lock-formation bass/drums/etc. simplicity\\" with \\"pointedly warped lyrics.\\" AllMusic critic Laurie Mercer called the album \\"an intriguing embryonic work for the band\\" but assessed the record as \\"underwhelming compared to later work.\\" Mercer awarded the album three out of five possible stars.

The hospital was established in 1912 under the name Maimonides Hospital, with a mission of serving poor immigrants from Europe while providing training to Jewish physicians, primarily of Eastern European descent.Irving Cutler, The Jews of Chicago: From Shtetl to Suburb (1996), p. 158-160. After a period of financial difficulty, it closed in 1918, and was reopened as \\"Mount Sinai Hospital\\" in 1919, with 60 beds and continuing its original mission. History The second Jewish hospital to be established in the city, Mount Sinai Hospital differed from Michael Reese Hospital, which had been established in 1881 on Chicago's South Side primarily by German Jews, whereas Mount Sinai was founded by Eastern European Jews. Unlike other hospitals, Mount Sinai had a kosher kitchen. Morris Kurtzon sought to provide the West Side community in Chicago a suitable hospital, one where Jewish doctors could practice without facing exclusion from hospital staffs by anti-Semitism. Purchasing with his own money the bankrupt Maimonides Hospital, Kurtzon re-organized it under the name Mount Sinai Hospital Association. He refused an attractive offer to sell the property to the University of Illinois, preferring to donate it for the benefit of the entire community. The community responded to this gesture with a strenuous effort to build financial support for the new hospital. Although women had not traditionally been welcome to participate in many communal activities, the early history of Mount Sinai included a strong presence of women among its supporters. Kurtzon devoted a good deal of his time to planning and designing the new facility. The final hospital plans were drawn up by the Chicago architectural firm of Schmidt, Garden and Erikson. Garcy Corporation of Piedmont, Alabama, designed custom equipment for the new hospital, much of it made of stainless steel. Patient services Mount Sinai Hospital is a non-profit institution, which provides charity care to 59% of its patients and is a teaching hospital affiliated primarily with Ross University School of Medicine, but also Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science and the University of Illinois at Chicago. The hospital is operated by Sinai Health System, which also includes Holy Cross Hospital at 68th Street & California Avenue, Schwab Rehabilitation Hospital and Sinai Children's Hospital. The latter has a Level 3 neonatal intensive care unit and performs outpatient surgery for children. The hospital is an adult Level 1 trauma center, chest pain center, and stroke center. Due to relatively low utilization and the availability of pediatric inpatient facilities at other institutions nearby, Mount Sinai in 2017 discontinued offering pediatric trauma care and hospitalization for children under age 16. While operating at a financial loss in an aging facility, even in its current state the hospital provides medical care to a vital part of the community. Ruth Rothstein, who served as the president of the hospital from the 1970s to the 1990s, resisted calls to move Mount Sinai to the suburbs. Residency Training Programs Mount Sinai Hospital has four ACGME (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education) accredited residency training programs in the fields of General Surgery, Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, Pediatrics, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and Obstetrics and Gynecology. It has trained numerous physicians who went successfully into primary care as well as into competitive subspecialty fellowships. Mount Sinai also has its own Adult Cardiology and Interventional Adult Cardiology fellowship programs.

The primary aim of the business was to reduce migrant isolation; particularly for European migrants from Germany, France, Italy, Czechoslovakia and Austria, disembarking from ships into Australia. Over time, increasing immigration from many other countries sparked the need to expand into new languages‚Äîa trend which continues today. Wigston was subsequently elected to the position of Mayor of the Bourke Street Traders Association. History of owners (chronology) William Bernard (WB) Wigston was born and raised in Ashtead Surrey, England, and was an entrepreneur who spent time in South Africa with his younger brother Nigel, managing mining operations in the late 1920s. He migrated to Australia in the early 30s. A well-to-do gentleman, when Foreign Language Bookshop was started in Bourke Street it started as a library and he mainly spent his time as a share trader, using ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù staff to help keep his share records. WB lived in a Toorak mansion with a live-in maid and his cat. He would not allow married women to work for him but made an exception for Mrs Bess Carmichael who commenced working for him as a single lady and in later years was rostered to cover brief periods for other staff on leave or away ill. During World War II, the library was forced to move to the corner of Bourke Street and Elizabeth Street. It was in this site that the library started to become a bookshop. Worried about his failing health in the 1940s, he used to have his chauffeur Herbie follow him around when taking his morning walks as he felt it would be socially inappropriate to pass away on his walk and be left lying on the road. WB died in 1956. WB left money in his will to all staff and willed the business of Foreign Language Bookshop to Mrs Connie Tink who sold it in 1959 to Mrs Felder, who sold it in 1966 to Mrs Leser. In 1971 Mrs Leser sold the business to Mrs Annette Monester. During 1982, Ms Monester moved the business to the top end of Collins Street. FLB is now owned by the Bookery which in turn is owned by the university sector in Australia. Since June 2020 Bookery ceased operating as a bookshop and is now exclusively online.

Plant stem cells serve as the origin of plant vitality, as they maintain themselves while providing a steady supply of precursor cells to form differentiated tissues and organs in plants. Two distinct areas of stem cells are recognised: the apical meristem and the lateral meristem. Plant stem cells are characterized by two distinctive properties, which are: the ability to create all differentiated cell types and the ability to self-renew such that the number of stem cells is maintained. Plant stem cells never undergo aging process but immortally give rise to new specialized and unspecialized cells, and they have the potential to grow into any organ, tissue, or cell in the body. Thus they are totipotent cells equipped with regenerative powers that facilitate plant growth and production of new organs throughout lifetime. Unlike animals, plants are immobile. As plants cannot escape from danger by taking motion, they need a special mechanism to withstand various and sometimes unforeseen environmental stress. Here, what empowers them to withstand harsh external influence and preserve life is stem cells. In fact, plants comprise the oldest and the largest living organisms on earth, including Bristlecone Pines in California, U.S. (4,842 years old), and the Giant Sequoia in mountainous regions of California, U.S. (87 meters in height and 2,000 tons in weight). This is possible because they have a modular body plan that enables them to survive substantial damage by initiating continuous and repetitive formation of new structures and organs such as leaves and flowers. Plant stem cells are also characterized by their location in specialized structures called meristematic tissues, which are located in root apical meristem (RAM), shoot apical meristem (SAM), and vascular system ((pro)cambium or vascular meristem.) Research and development Traditionally, plant stem cells were thought to only exist in SAM and RAM and studies were conducted based on this assumption. However, recent studies have indicated that (pro)cambium also serves as a niche for plant stem cells: \\"Procambium cells fulfill the criteria for being stem cells since they have the capacity for long-term self renewal and being able to differentiate into one or more specialized cell types.\\" Cambium is a type of meristem with thin walls which minutely exist in small populations within a plant. Due to this structural characteristic, once physical force is applied to it, it is easily damaged in the very process of isolation, losing its stem cell characteristics. Despite 160 years of biological effort to isolate and retrieve plant stem cells, none succeeded in the isolation due to the distinct structural characteristics of plant stem cell: \\"[t]he cambium consists of a few layers of narrow elongated, thin-walled cells, easily damaged during sampling.\\" This highly vulnerable feature has made studies on cambial structure and ultrastructure difficult to achieve with conventional methods. Thus failure to isolate plant stem cells from meristematic tissues prompted scientists to administer plant cell culture by using callus (dedifferentiated cells) as an alternative to plant stem cells. Callus, or dedifferentiated cells, are somatic cells that undergo dedifferentiation to give rise to totipotent embryogenic cells, which temporarily gains the ability to proliferate and/or regenerate an embryo. Since embryogenic cells were considered totipotent cells based on their ability to regenerate or develop into an embryo under given conditions, dedifferentiated cells were generally regarded as stem cells of plant: \\"‚Ä¶we propose to extend the concept of stem cells to include embryogenic stem cells that arise from plant somatic cells. We examine the cellular, physiological and molecular similarities and differences between plant meristematic stem cells and embryogenic stem cells originating directly from single somatic cells.\\" Plant stem cell vs. callus Despite that callus exhibits a number of stem cell-like properties for a temporary period and that it has been cultured for useful plant compounds as an alternative source of plant stem cell, callus and plant stem cell are fundamentally different from each other. Callus is similar to plant stem cell in its ability to differentiate, but the two are different in their origin. While plant stem cell exists in the meristematic tissues of plant, callus is obtained as a temporary response to cure wounds in somatic cell. Moreover, callus undergoes dedifferentiation as differentiated cells acquire ability to differentiate; but genetic variation is inevitable in the process because the cells consist of somatic undifferentiated cells from an adult subject plant. Unlike true stem cells, callus is heterogeneous. Due to this reason, continuous and stable cell division of callus is difficult. Hence a plant stem cell originated from cambium is an immortal cell while that from callus is a temporarily dediffertiated cell obtained from stimulating the somatic cell. Furthermore, the ability to differentiate and proliferate is different that differences between plant stem cell and callus are prevalent in culture and research. Only plant stem cells embedded in meristems can divide and give rise to cells that differentiate while giving rise to new stem cells. These immortal cells divide infinitely. Bioprocess innovation Plant cells are cultured to acquire plant useful compounds. However cell cultures are often hindered by various factors especially if cell culture continues long- term. However, strong vitality and structural characteristics of plant stem cell overcome previous drawbacks to plant cell culture. Thus plant stem cell culture is the most ideal and productive method of cell culture and phytochemical production as cells are successfully mass cultured while maintaining quality. Further applications Numerous medicines, perfumes, pigments, antimicrobials, and insecticides are derived from plant natural products. Cultured Cambial Meristematic Cells (CMC) may provide a cost- effective, environmentally friendly, and sustainable source of important natural products, including paclitaxel. Unlike plant cultivation, this approach is not subject to the unpredictability caused by variation in climatic conditions or political instability in certain parts of the world. Also, CMCs from reference specifies may also provide an important biological tool to explore plant stem cell function. In 2010, researchers from the (formerly Unhwa Institute of Science and Technology) presented their data to the world via Nature Biotechnology. Their research demonstrated the world's first cambial meristematic cell isolation. Due to the valuable and beneficial compounds for human health (i.e. paclitaxel) which are secreted by the CMC's, this technology is considered a serious breakthrough in plant biotechnology.

When Caldwell submitted the manuscript to Maxwell Perkins in 1937, she was an unknown housewife from Buffalo, New York. Dynasty of Death launched her prolific career.  Background  The novel is set in Windsor, Pennsylvania, a fictional mill town on the Allegheny River north of Pittsburgh. It is an epic multigenerational saga, stretching from 1837 to the eve of World War I, about the Bouchard and Barbour families, who grow their small munitions factory into a great international corporation. Joseph Barbour is a servant who becomes a successful businessman and arms manufacturer. His younger son Martin is not interested in money and is an idealist and altruist. Elder son Ernest is an egoist who believes that money is the greatest power in the world. Ernest loves Amy Drumhill, the niece of Gregory Sessions, owner of a steel factory. Amy marries Martin, however, who establishes a hospital and dies in the American Civil War. Ernest's hardness ruins Joseph, and he is cursed by his mother. This story of the Bouchard clan is continued through World War II in Caldwell's later novels The Eagles Gather (1940) and The Final Hour (1944), although the Pittsburgh setting is largely left behind as the family takes its place on the world stage.

Chiao is an American physicist best known for his experimental work in quantum optics. He is currently an emeritus faculty member at the University of California, Merced physics department, where he is conducting research on gravitational radiation. Biography Raymond Chiao was born in Hong Kong on Oct. 9, 1940, and moved as a child to the United States in 1947. He grew up in New York City, where he attended Collegiate School. It was there that he first got interested in science through reading Gamow‚Äôs book One, Two, Three, ..., Infinity. He was admitted to Princeton University in 1957 as an electrical engineer, but then switched to the physics department, where he worked on a senior thesis project given to him by John Archibald Wheeler on the quantization of general relativity. He then switched from theoretical physics to experimental physics in graduate studies at MIT under the supervision of Charles Hard Townes, shortly after the experimental realization of the ruby laser. His thesis topic was on the first observation of stimulated Brillouin scattering. After obtaining his Ph.D. in 1965 from MIT, he taught as an assistant professor there until 1967. He moved to UC Berkeley in 1967, and remained there until 2006, after which he took a position at the UC's newly opened campus UC Merced. Discoveries Chiao has become well known in the field of quantum optics due to several important experiments. Based on former experiments carried out by G√ºnter Nimtz in 1992 he measured the quantum tunnelling time, which was found to be between 1.5 and 1.7 times the speed of light. Interpretation of these results is open to question (see references below pertaining to tunneling time). He also was the first to measure the topological Berry's Phase (Geometric phase). Current work As of 2006, he accepted a faculty position at UC Merced and turned his full energy on the project of detecting gravitational waves through the use of superconductors. As of 2010 he became emeritus faculty but he continues to advise several PhD Students.

He was foreman of the first grand jury in New England, served most of his life in early colonial government, and according to noted historian Henry Reed Stiles, Phelps \\"was one of the most prominent and highly respected men in the colony.\\"  Origin of William Phelps  William Phelps was a Puritan Englishman who arrived in Dorchester, Massachusetts, in 1630 aboard the ship Mary and John with his wife Ann and four children. Oliver Seymour Phelps and his son-in-law, Andrew T. Servin, published The Phelps Family in America in 1899. They mistakenly concluded that William Phelps was the brother of George Phelps, who apparently arrived in Windsor, Connecticut in 1635 aboard the Recovery of London, and that both emigrated from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, England. Modern researchers have concluded this is incorrect. = From Crewkerne= Phelps and Servin's identification of the origin of William Phelps in Tewkesbury was based solely on an estimate of his birth date, derived from what was thought to be his age of 72 at death on July 14, 1672. Oliver Phelps located a William Phelps who was baptized in Tewkesbury on August 19, 1599, and thus identified him as the original immigrant. He also believed that George Phelps was William's brother, despite the fact that they could not locate any records for a George Phelps in Tewkesbury. Recent genetic research has shown no biological relationship between the descendants of William and George Phelps. Additionally, the will of William Phelps' mother Dorothy in Tewkesbury, probated on May 5, 1617, mentioned a brother-in-law, Edward Phelps. His will in turn, probated on July 1, 1637, named as overseer of his estate his nephew, William Phelps, likely placing William Phelps of Tewkesbury in England and not across the Atlantic in the Massachusetts Bay. More recent expert research has identified William Phelps of Crewkerne, Somersetshire, England as the immigrant. = Family = Phelps was married twice: (1) Mary (surname unknown), buried in England in 1626, and (2) Anne Dover, who accompanied him and children from both marriages to Dorchester, Massachusetts, a town later annexed by the city of Boston. The names and birthdates of the children correspond to the records later found in the American colony. = Marriage to Mary = Phelps was born in Crewkerne, England and is estimated to have married his first wife Mary sometime between 1615‚Äì1618, as their first child William was baptized at Crewkerne on September 9, 1618. Mary and William had four children, all baptized before 1625 at Crewkerne: William, Samuel, an unnamed infant who died young, and Nathaniel. Mary was buried at Crewkerne on August 13, 1626. = Marriage to Ann Dover = Three months after Mary's death, William married Ann Dover at Crewkerne, on November 14, 1626. They had five children in England: Cornelius, Joseph and Mary (twins), and another child named Mary. Researchers can not find further records of Cornelius or either of the twin girls named Mary, and presume they all died young. Records in the Colonies have been found for the children born in England named Joseph, Sarah, Timothy and the last Mary. After arriving in the Colonies, Ann and William had three more children: Sarah, Timothy, and a third Mary. Records in the International Genealogical Index corresponding to the children born in Somerset list the names of William Phelps' children from both wives. = Children and grandchildren = * William Phelps (c. 1593‚Äì1672), * m.

After the Puritans assumed control of Parliament, they began to pose a serious threat to the King's authority. In January 1629, in a move to neutralize his opponents, Charles dissolved Parliament entirely. The religious and political climate became so difficult for Puritans that many began to make arrangements to leave the country. William Phelps was among them. Phelps had been a member of Reverend John Warham's church. Warham had been a minister since 1614, but was relieved of his ministerial duties in 1627 because of his \\"strong Puritan leanings.\\" The group Phelps joined was organized by the Reverend John White, Vicar of Dorchester, England. White is generally regarded as the sponsor of the earliest Massachusetts settlement after Plymouth. At his urging, nearly 150 individuals gathered from the English West Country counties of Dorset, Somerset, Devon and Cornwall. While many historians assumed that the emigrants were motivated by religious persecution like others in the Winthrop Fleet, the West Country was free from it. Unlike many who fled England for Canada, Ireland, and the Caribbean during this time, the Puritans who migrated to the New World were on the whole better educated, emigrated with their entire family, and tended to leave relatively prosperous lives to establish a new society of pious family values.New England's Great Migration While the Pilgrims were non-conformists or separatists, the Puritans were reformers. They were not leaving England for economic reasons or for religious freedom, per se, because they believed their faith to be the only true religion. They disrespected all other faiths, especially Quakers. The emigrants were organized by Rev. White on March 19, 1630 as the West Country Company at New Hospital, Plymouth, England, the day before leaving England. Although very few knew one another, they agreed to emigrate as a body to Massachusetts, where White had sent other groups over the prior six years. White has been called \\"the father of the Massachusetts Colony,\\" despite remaining in England his entire life, because of his influence in establishing this settlement. From their first arrival aboard the Mayflower in 1620, until 1629, only about 300 Puritans had survived in New England, scattered in small and isolated settlements. The group fasted, prayed and prepared themselves for their perilous long voyage. White preached sermons in the morning and afternoon; then, with his blessing, the group departed on March 20 for the New World aboard the Mary and John.  Arrival in the New World  The Mary and John made a good passage and arrived at Nantasket (later Hull) on May 30, 1630 without casualty. They quickly found pasture for their cattle at Mattapan. They made their settlement inland, about to the west on the edge of the bay, and named it Dorchester, honoring Reverend John White of Dorchester, England. Under the oversight of the Massachusetts Bay Colony headed by Governor John Winthrop, the village became the first permanent settlement in present-day Suffolk County. The arrival of 140 passengers in New England significantly increased the local population. Along with William Phelps was Roger Ludlowe, John Mason, Samuel Maverick, Nicholas Upsall, Henry Wolcott and other men who would become prominent in the founding of a new nation. The passengers are generally known as the Dorchester Company, referring to the place they selected for their settlement. They remained together as a distinct body and contemporary records identify most of them. Their ship arrived in Massachusetts only 10 days before the first ships of the Winthrop Fleet.The Colonies - The Dorchester Company While the passenger lists for this voyage are not well documented, researchers from the Mary and John Clearing House concluded that it is highly likely that William Phelps, his wife Ann Dover, and their sons William, Samuel, Nathanial and Joseph were aboard ship. These names support the conclusion that William Phelps was from Crewkerne and not Tewkesbury.  Early colonial life  The Mary and John immigrants organized the town of Dorchester upon their arrivalNotable Events in Massachusetts at what is now the intersection of Columbia Road and Massachusetts Avenue in South Boston. The Puritan settlers landed at Columbia Point, which the Native Americans called \\"Mattaponnock\\".\\"Calf Pasture Pumping Station\\" , Dorchester Atheneum First Parish Church of Dorchester as of 1896 The immigrants founded the First Parish Church of Dorchester in 1631, which exists today as the Unitarian-Universalist church on Meeting House Hill, being the oldest religious organization in present-day Boston. The first church building was a simple log cabin with a thatched roof.See Historical Sketch The settlers held their first town meeting at the church, and they set their laws in open and frequent discussion. In all of this they were inspired by the ideal of the Kingdom of God on earth and the attempt to realize this in England in the time of the Rev. John White. The church is referred to as a 'Foundation Stone of the Nation\\".Revd. John White - First Parish Church of Dorchester, Mass. Photo of The Mather School built in 1694 as of 1913. This school was replaced in 1798 when the town voted to sell the old school and build a new one of brick on Meeting House Hill The new settlers also founded in 1639 the first elementary school in the New World supported by public money, the Mather School. The school is the oldest elementary school in America.Mather Elementary School Dorchester was annexed by the City of Boston in 1970. = Foreman of first grand jury = Phelps served continually in varying governing capacities for many years. He was a member of the first General Court held in the colony in 1636, a member of the Court of Magistrates from 1637 to 1643, and was foreman of the first Grand Jury in 1643. = Early service in government = Phelps name was spelled in the Massachusetts Colonial Records variously as Felps, Phelips and Phelps. He was made constable, assigned to serve on committees given authority to settle land and boundary disputes, and given other key responsibilities in administering the affairs of the new town, including serving on the General Court, or general meeting, at which individuals were tried for offenses including absence from church, forgery, fornication, and \\"bastardy.\\" Phelps remained in Dorchester until 1635 when he and a large number of other families relocated to a new site inland which they named Windsor.  Founding of Windsor  Plan of Ancient Windsor, Connecticut, circa 1640‚Äì1654, showing the names and locations of settlers' homes, the Palisade, and various geographic features In 1633, the Plymouth Trading Company established the first Connecticut settlement, a trading post at what would become Windsor, Connecticut, in territory the Dutch claimed and in which they maintained a fort and trading post, about seven miles downriver in what was later Hartford, Connecticut. In 1635, Puritan and Congregationalist members of Reverends Warham's and Maverick's congregation, including William Phelps, John Mason, Roger Ludlow, Henry Wolcott, and others, all prominent settlers, were dissatisfied with the rate of Anglican reforms. They disagreed with Governor Winthrop's leadership, as he thought that the settlement should be run by only a few people. They believed they should have a voice in electing their leaders. They sought permission from the Massachusetts General Court to establish a new ecclesiastical society in the Connecticut Valley subject to their own rules and regulations. In October 1635, about 60 individuals, totaling 23 heads of households, undertook a two-week journey about to the east. They took a route known as the Old Connecticut Path, which took them through a region of swamps, rivers, and over small mountains. They sent most of their belongings and provisions via water and ship. Before they were established in their new homes, winter arrived. The river quickly froze over in mid-November, and the ship carrying their provisions could not reach them. Their few supplies were soon exhausted, and they faced starvation. A few struggled back to Dorchester and the rest survived the winter with help from the original Plymouth settlers and the Native Americans. When spring arrived, the transplanted settlers moved to higher ground in the meadow north of the river and were finally able to receive their provisions. They initially named their settlement Dorchester. Two years later in 1637, the colony's General Court changed the name of the settlement from Dorchester to Windsor,Public Records of the Colony of Connecticut, Volume 1, Page 7 believed to be named after the town of Windsor, England, on the River Thames. The new town was the first English settlement in the state. Under pressure from continued English settlement, the Dutch abandoned their post in 1654. = First town government in the colonies = Windsor was supposed to be under the control of the Massachusetts Company. When Connecticut was set apart as a colony, the General Court of Massachusetts set the terms of the new colony's government in a commission granted by on March 3, 1636. It set out how differences were to be resolved, fines and imprisonment imposed, trading, planting, building, lots, military discipline, defense in war, and the people to be self-governed in their new town. William Phelps was one of eight commissioners appointed by the Colony of Massachusetts Bay to govern the Colony of Connecticut. All meetings were to meet in a legal and open manner. Eight men were given \\"full power and authority\\" to lead the new colony: \\"Roger Ludlowe, Esqr., William Pinchon, Esq., John Steele, William Swaine, Henry Smythe, William Phelpes, William Westwood & Andrew Warde.\\" Roger Ludlow later wrote a book on the democratic procedures of Connecticut which furnished the outline for the Constitution of the United States. = Pequot war service = The Mashantucket Pequot had lived in Southeastern Connecticut for over 10,000 years. When the colonists occupied Windsor, Connecticut, they came into contact and later conflict with the Pequot who inhabited the area. The Pequot had recently conquered the area from another tribe. In 1637, the Pequot killed two British slave raiders who had been capturing Native Americans for the slave trade. The colonists demanded that the Indians who killed the slavers be turned over for punishment. The Pequot refused. Other skirmishes and confrontations ensued, including an attack on settlers working in fields near Wethersfield. This was retribution for the confiscation of land belonging to sachem Sowheag. The English, unlike the French, considered land more important than fur trade, and they enslaved or killed most of those who survived the periodic epidemics, like the smallpox epidemic among the Pequot during 1630‚Äì32. The newcomers wanted the land for themselves, and they believed God afflicted the Pequot with smallpox as a blessing to the settlers. \\"At a General Court held May 1, 1637 in Hartford, Connecticut, William Phelps presiding, it was ordered that there shall be an offensive war against the Pequot Indians, in which war he served.\\" On May 26, 1637, about 90 English militia combined forces with Indians who were also enemies of the Pequot, the Narragansetts and Mohegan. They attacked the Pequot palisade or fort at Mystic. Many of the Pequot men from that village, led by their sachem Sassacus, were largely absent from the village as they prepared another raid on Hartford, Connecticut. The militia, commanded by Captain John Mason, surrounded the palisaded village at dawn and set it to fire, striving to kill any who escaped the flames. By their own estimate they killed 600 to 700 individuals, captured seven, and saw seven escape. most of whom where women and children. This was later referred to as the Mystic massacre. In the ensuring weeks the Pequot, already decimated by smallpox, were virtually eliminated as a tribe. The remaining individuals were enslaved by neighboring enemy tribes, sold into slavery to other colonies, or enslaved by the white settlers themselves. = Later public service = William Phelps was a member of the General Court for 23 years from 1636 to 1662. He was a member of Council in 1637. In 1641, he and later Governor Thomas Welles, of Hartford, were a committee on lying, \\"considered a grievous fault.\\" That same year he served as Governor of the Windsor Colony. He was also one of the earliest Governor's Assistants and Representative from 1645 to 1657. Phelps participated in enacting laws which with others were later called the \\"Blue Laws of Connecticut\\". The law of the day was specific regarding crimes and punishment, and Phelps was cited on numerous occasions for his responsibility in administering the law. = Land purchases = Detail of map of central area of Windsor, Connecticut, circa 1640‚Äì1654, showing homes of William Phelps Sr., at top, after his move away from the river, and his son William Phelps Jr. immediately next to his. His home in Windsor was \\"a short distance north of the Mill River Valley\\", and after the Connecticut River flooded during the breaking up of ice in the spring of 1639, he moved his home further north, \\"about three-quarters of a mile northwest of Broad Street on the road to Poquonock, the place owned, in 1859, by Deacon Roger Phelps.\\" Phelps purchased land from the Indians on more than one occasion. In a deed dated March 31, 1665, Phelps recorded that he had purchased a parcel of land about 30 years previously from Sehat, a Paquanick sachem. He was unable to provide title and prove his previous payment, forcing him to buy the land again. He paid to Sehat's descendant \\"Nassahegan, an Indian sachem\\" and his kinsmen \\"four trucking coats\\" and wampum.

William Phelps received this distinguished title of Mr.\\" Two volumes Stiles further noted that William Phelps \\"was one of the most prominent and highly respected men in the colony.

It was produced by John Scher and Metropolitan Talent Presents. It was directed and choreographed by Ron Lewis, with vocal arrangements by Kay Thompson and Billy Stritch. Minnelli performed with four dancer-singers: Cortes Alexander, Jim Caruso, Tiger Martina, and Johnny Rodgers. The concert contained songs written by Kander and Ebb, among others. The first act included a revised version of a vaudeville tribute her mother once performed at the Palace.Holden, Steven \\"To Godmother, Old Chum\\",The New York Times, December 5, 2008 The second act included a \\"re-creation of [Kay] Thompson's celebrated nightclub act with the four Williams brothers\\".Haun Harry \\"PLAYBILL ON OPENING NIGHT: Liza's at the Palace... ‚Äî Garlands for Minnelli\\", Playbill.com, December 4, 2008 Critical response Stephen Holden of The New York Times said, \\"From the moment Ms. Minnelli joins forces with a male singing and dancing quartet to resurrect parts of a famous nightclub act Thompson created in the late 1940s and early ‚Äô50s with the Williams Brothers, the Palace Theater blasts off into orbit. There it remains, deliriously spinning until the end of a 2-hour-20-minute show (with intermission) that leaves the star in a state of breathless exaltation. The end of the opening-night show on Wednesday found Ms. Minnelli panting, drenched in sweat, her hair matted, as if she had just finished running the New York marathon, which in a sense she had... I would love to report that Ms. Minnelli‚Äôs voice and physical agility have been magically restored to their former glory, but those days seem to be gone. On Wednesday night her voice was in tatters, her diction unsteady. When she belted, her wide vibrato wobbled to the breaking point. Most of her s‚Äôs were slurred sh‚Äôs. Frequently short of breath, she swallowed phrases. Many of her highest notes were dry, piercing caws. But there were still occasional moments of beautifully focused dramatic singing... As for movement, there were no kicks or even half-kicks, although Ms. Minnelli can still strut stealthily and sprawl across a director‚Äôs chair in sensual abandon... Once the show began to soar, though, Ms. Minnelli‚Äôs force of will became a triumph of spirit over flesh. As she insisted on doing what she can no longer do, her audacity was inspiring: her message was you do the best you can, and if you have to, fake it. She trusted the listener‚Äôs imagination to fill in the blanks.\\" In Variety, David Rooney observed, \\"In her return to Broadway after nearly 10 years‚Äô absence, Minnelli had the opening-night audience in the palm of her hand from her first moment onstage - striking that signature, one-arm-pointed-skyward pose, appropriately framed by a giant pink triangle of light... [W]hat makes Minnelli a great entertainer when she's firing on all cylinders is how hard she works for the audience's love. And how much she clearly thrives on it. In an age in which so many female concert performers are overproduced automatons, deigning to be worshipped by their fans, Minnelli's emotional give-and-take makes her a disarming relic... Sure, the voice is frayed and husky, the control wavers, many of the lyrics are slurred and the big belt at times hides behind the orchestra's ample brass section to disguise the effort. But nobody who would buy a ticket to this show in the first place is going to care a whit. Minnelli's charisma is undiminished and her vocals still have power, warmth and a startling ability to make every song personal.\\"Rooney, DavidVariety, December 4, 2008 Brian Scott Lipton of Theatermania.com stated, \\"To get the big questions out of the way, Minnelli's voice isn't what it was many years ago, but it's strong and powerful and mostly gets the job done, and she moves rather than really dances. But her skills as a performer, honed over five decades, and her genuineness and vulnerability make these shortcomings seem relatively unimportant.\\"Lipton, Brian S.

The tymbal (or timbal) is the corrugated exoskeletal structure used to produce sounds in insects. In male cicadas, the tymbals are membranes in the abdomen, responsible for the characteristic sound produced by the insect. In tiger moths, the tymbals are modified regions of the thorax, and produce high- frequency clicks. In lesser wax moths the left and right tymbals emit high frequency pulses that are used as mating calls. The paired tymbals of a cicada are located on the sides of the abdominal base. The \\"singing\\" of a cicada is not stridulation as in many other familiar sound-producing insects like crickets (where one structure is rubbed against another): the tymbals are regions of the exoskeleton that are modified to form a complex membrane with thin, membranous portions and thickened \\"ribs\\". These membranes vibrate rapidly, and enlarged chambers derived from the tracheae enable the cicada's body to be a resonance chamber, greatly amplifying the sound. Some cicadas produce sounds louder than 106 dB (SPL), among the loudest of all insect- produced sounds. They modulate their noise by positioning their abdomens toward or away from the substrate. The tymbals of a tiger moth are specialized regions on the metathoracic episterna, normally corrugated such that sound is produced when the entire tymbal surface is buckled by muscular contraction and then released, producing a series of extremely rapid \\"clicks\\" as the corrugations flex back into place.J.H. Fullard and B.

She has published in the field of entomology as Katja Seltmann, and is the current director of the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration at the University of California, Santa Barbara. However, she is best known for her alter-ego Irene Moon, under which name she has released a series of musical recordings, performance art-entomology lectures, insect/human hybrid dolls and Auk Theatre, a cycle of absurdist-horror plays that she writes and performs. She has also toured extensively throughout the United States and Europe in all of these capacities. Since 2015, she co-hosts the weekly science and music radio program Unknown Territories, on KCSB 91.9 FM in Santa Barbara. Biography Moon was born in Raleigh, North Carolina. She began creating performances and films with the Melted Men, Deonna Mann and the Noisettes in Athens, Georgia during the late 1990s, and recorded her first album in 1996. She moved to Lexington, Kentucky, in 2000 for masters work in entomology with a concentration in insect systematics and evolution. While in Lexington, Moon developed Auk Theatre and began recording music under the name the Collection of the Late Howell Bend (credited for the soundtracks to Auk Theatre). Moon moved to Szeged, Hungary to study ecology. Here she received her PhD in ecology. Moon worked as a research associate in multiple subjects and she now works in the field of biodiversity informatics/entomology at The University of California Santa Barbara Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration. She previously worked at the American Museum of Natural History, now she works at UCSB and continues to create musical and performance art. Scientific career While Moon is most well known for her artistic performances, most of her performances are created specifically to perform or teach science. Moons uses the intersection between science and art to allow for communication about science and natural history through popular culture. Moon performs \\"lectographies\\" in an attempt to educate people on the beauty of the insect world. In these \\"lectographies,\\" Moon uses multiple forms of media such as film, song, dance, handouts, slides, PowerPoint presentations, preserved specimen, and any other form of media that Moon believes will be useful in teaching the audience about the world of insects. Moon also has over 20 years of experience researching entomology. Specifically, insect morphology and evolution, Hymenoptera systematics, plant-insect interactions and other studies focusing on natural history and science. Lectures Moon has given surrealist entomological lectures throughout the United States and Europe, and has toured with noise music bands the Hair Police and psychedelic folk band Eyes and Arms of Smoke, among many others. Lectures are accompanied by music, slideshows, flip charts, recorded commentary, insect sounds, and often feature background film accompaniment. Lectures are then followed by pop quizzes and/or question and answer sessions. Topics have included the Cornu aspersum snail, the death's-head hawkmoth, and the Nantucket pine tip moth. She has lectured at such diverse venues as the Knitting Factory in New York City, Sluggo's in Pensacola, Florida, the 2003 Entomological Society of America Annual Meeting and Exhibition, and at an abandoned cathedral in Amsterdam. Recordings Moon has released several of her lectures as recordings. She has also released the musical accompaniment to those lectures as stand alone albums. Her first full-length record, Floralaldehyde, was released in 1996 (re-released in 1999). Notable works include Scientifically Speaking with Irene Moon, a series of her lectures and music, From Field Station A (1997, re-pressed 2004), and the soundtrack to the Thin Wax Line, an animated bee propaganda film. Radio show Moon currently has a weekly radio show called Unknown Territories, an hour long cultural arts program. Her radio shows cover a variety of scientific and historic topics such as combustion, rust, and evolution. She has also interviewed scientists and researchers about their work and/or scientific findings through a series called, \\"Let's Talk Science\\". Some of these shows can be found on the Unknown Territories website. Natural history work has inspired much of the music played on the radio show. Moon even plays several pieces that are specifically about natural history collections. Music Aside from her recorded lectures, Moon has also released music under the name Collection of the Late Howell Bend. Notable titles among these works include For the Neonate (2004‚Äì2005), and a split with Kentucky-based psychedelic band Warmer Milks. The Collection of the Late Howell Bend have supplied the musical soundtracks to Moon's Auk Theatre. Moon's music (and lectures) have been released and distributed by Begonia Society, Surefire, Ignivomous, Carbon Records, APOP Records, Yod, Armageddon Record Shop, fusetron, tomentosa, RRRecords, Eclipse Records, Mimaroglu Music Sales, and White Denim. Auk Theatre Moon describes Auk Theatre as: \\"Noisy, short and simple Absurdist theatre with only the best topics in consideration; shoes, cardboard, bats, wine, shapes and murder.\\" To date, thirteen \\"Auks\\" have been constructed and performed. Their performances are marked by overstated art design, obscure, usually frightening subject matter, surrealism, medievalism, and occasionally, graphic violence. Auk Theatre's membership has included artist Matt Minter, musician and performance artist Sara O'keefe, musician Jeremy Midkiff (as Jeramy Midkiff), Deek hoi, Ellen Molle', Christopher Cprek, Trevor Tremaine and Robery Beatty of Hair Police, Darryl Cook, and Ben Fulton and John Ferguson of ulysses. Films In addition to several filmed performance of Auk Theatre, Moon also makes films that support her lectures and musical performances, as well as stand-alone short films. These films mix factual information (usually entomological, but also historical, occult, and esoterica) with her own music, field-recorded insect sound samples, photomicrography, and animation. Initially, Moon used 8mm film for her shorts, but has since experimented with videotape and DV. About her films, Moon has remarked: \\"Primarily thee visuals ... explain or emphasize the emotion of a composition. These films are highly synthesized and predominantly fantasy. They are memories not processed, distortions of important details that are often missed or not remembered.\\" Doll-making Moon has also created insect-human hybrid dolls, which she has used for a series of \\"micro-puppet\\" shows. These dolls were sold at the La Superette gallery in New York.

There are many different aspects of this fear and not everyone has every part. Some of these parts include fear of surgery, fear of dental work, and fear of doctors. These fears are often overlooked, but when a patient has one to the extreme it can be very damaging to their health. Formally, medical fear is defined as \\"any experience that involves medical personnel or procedures involved in the process of evaluating or modifying health status in traditional health care settings.\\" Classification Fear of medical procedures can be classified under a broader category of ‚Äúblood, injection, and injury phobias‚Äù. This is one of five subtypes that classify specific phobias.Specific Phobias: Clinical Applications of Evidence-Based Psychotherapy pg 5 A specific phobia is defined as a ‚Äúmarked and persistent fear that is excessive or unreasonable, cued by the presence (or anticipation) of a specific object or situation.‚ÄùDiagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994)Phobic Disorders and Panic in Adults: A guide to Assessment and Treatment pg 79 Often these fears begin to appear in childhood, around the age of five to nine. It is normal to become squeamish at the sight of blood, injury, or gross deformity,Fears, Phobias, and Rituals: Panic, Anxiety and their Disorders pg 376 but many overcome these fears by the time they reach adulthood. Those who do not are more likely to avoid medical and dental procedures necessary to maintain health, jobs, etc. Research shows that when people encounter something that they have a specific phobia of many of them have a feeling of disgustPhobic Disorders and Panic in Adults: A guide to Assessment and Treatment pg 82 which makes them not want to come near or experience the object or situation which is disgusting to them. This feeling of disgust, especially in the blood, injection, and injury phobias may be passed down in families. Women have been known to avoid becoming pregnant because it requires blood and medical examinations that they would rather avoid.Fears, Phobias, and Rituals: Panic, Anxiety and their Disorders pg 377 Also, most phobic people have an increased heart rate upon encountering the thing they fear, but blood, injection, injury phobic people also seem to have an increase of fainting after the initial speeding up of heart rate. Their heart rate will go up and then slow again, leading to nausea, sweating, pallor, and fainting. This fainting can also lead to seizures, making life very difficult for those who have this fear.Fears, Phobias, and Rituals: Panic, Anxiety and their Disorders pg 378 However, only 4.5% of individuals who have this phobia as a child will have this fear their entire lifetime.Phobic Disorders and Panic in Adults: A guide to Assessment and Treatment pg 84 For those who do experience this phobia in an extreme manner, specific coping treatments have been found to help them. Biological treatments, such as medications used for other anxiety ailments, are generally found to be inappropriate for fear of medical procedures or other specific phobias. Psychological treatments are the treatment of choice because they are more accurate at addressing the problem. Some of these treatments used especially for fear of medical procedures include exposure-based treatments, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, and applied tension to react against fainting.Phobic Disorders and Panic in Adults: A guide to Assessment and Treatment pg 98-102 Fear of surgery Fear of surgery or other invasive medical procedure is known as tomophobia. Fear of surgery is not a fear experienced often, but is still just as harmful as other phobias that are more common. Since surgery is not a common occurrence, the fear is based on inexperience or something that is out of the ordinary. This fear is one of those categorized under all fears of medical procedures that can be experienced by anyone, all ages, and have little need for actual psychological treatment, unless it is uncharacteristically causing the patient to react in a way that would be harmful to his or her health. =Children= Fear of surgery is common among young children. Christine Gorman, of Kids and Surgery, states ‚ÄúSurgery is scary enough for adults. But imagine what goes through the mind of a three- year-old when he sees a doctor or nurse all suited up and wearing a surgical mask: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a monster! It‚Äôs got big eyes and no mouth! It‚Äôs taking me away from Mommy and Daddy.‚Äù No wonder half of all children from ages of 2 to 10 show evidence of distress‚Äîfrom bed-wetting to nightmares‚Äîfor at least two weeks after their operation. Some of them remain traumatized even six months later.‚ÄùKids and Surgery by: Gorman, Christine, Time, 0040781X, 06/07/99, Vol. 153, Issue 22 This statement shows that the fear that comes when young children go into surgery can be a serious matter because they are still traumatized by the effects for weeks after the surgery has taken place. Being scared of surgery has led to ‚Äúeating disorders, sleep disturbances, regression to earlier levels of behavior, depression, and somatizations such as loss of voice after tonsillectomy.‚Äù The Children‚Äôs Surgical Worries Questionnaire: Reliability and Validity of a New Self-Report Measure, (Fosson, Martin & Haley, 1990; Setterstro:m, 1984) Many children see surgery as a form of punishment and, since they sometimes can‚Äôt see what they did ‚Äúwrong‚Äù, the fear is escalated, leaving greater chance for a longer effect on the psychological and emotional feelings of the child. Many ways have been tried to help children overcome this fear, including their parents and doctors simply telling them that the surgery won‚Äôt hurt, or sedatives given by the doctor to minimize the feelings of anxiety later. There are certain types of treatments that have been proven to be better methods than others. Some hospitals allow parents to come into the surgery room and stay with the child, calming them until the anesthetic has taken effect. This is noted to keep anxiety down for both the parent and the child.Assuaging Children‚Äôs Fear of Surgery, by Linda Saslow The New York Times, January 7, 1990 If the child can enter the surgery calmly, there is much less of a chance that they will have many complications after the surgery due to fear.Other ways to treat the fear of surgery for children include having a doctor explain to them what the surgery is going to do and acting out the operation on a doll or stuffed animal. This makes the surgery something less scary and able to be understood in the child‚Äôs mind. When the surgery is understood by the child, the fear of the unknown is less of a factor of how scared the child will be, and how much that will impact their reaction to the surgery. =Adults= Children are not the only ones to express fear of surgery, or have after effects that can affect the mental and physical well being of the person. Adults most fear the pain they expect to receive from the surgery. ‚ÄúThe Roche Pain Management Survey polled 500 Americans, 27% of whom had surgery during the previous five years. Of those who had surgery, 77% reported pain afterwards, with four out of five of those saying they experienced moderate to extreme pain. 70%, indicated they experienced pain even after receiving medication; 80% reported they received pain medication on time, although 33% had to ask for it; and 16% had to wait for medication.‚ÄùSurgery Patients‚Äô Number-One Fear. USA Today Magazine, 01617389, Feb96, Vol. 124, Issue 2609 Unlike children, adults seem to have less fear of the surgery itself, but rather fear of the effects of surgery. Milano and Kornfeld in 1980 said ‚ÄúAny operation is a destructive invasion of the body and therefore frightens many patients‚Äù.Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339-1346, pg.1339 Some operations seem to invoke more fear from patients than others. Aged persons who require cataract surgery often fear the procedure, even though success is very likely. The fear of going blind because of the surgery is more apparent in women, who over all fear surgery more than men.Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339-1346pg.1339 (Paddison, Strain, Strain & Strain, 1989) The cataract is a disease that attacks the lens, causing it to swell until sight becomes obscured. Operation is recommended when the disease begins to hamper everyday activities.Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339- 1346, pg. 1340 Even though becoming blind was the only option without the surgery, over 25% of the patients were afraid of becoming blind as a result of the surgery: 34% feared the failure of the operation.Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339-1346, pg. 1342 Ritva Fagerstr√∂m, concerning the fears of cataract operation said, ‚ÄúThese fears are understandable as the condition of the retina was not known in advance,‚Äù Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339-1349, pg. 1344 Two women out of 75, taking part in a study dealing with the fear of cataract operation felt that the experience of the first operation was so bad that they would not agree to have the second eye operated on.Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339-1349, pg. 1345 If a patient had this fear, understandable, and did not go through with the surgery, the blindness that would follow would keep them from being able to do normal things, easily leading them into situations of depression, or other dangerous situations which would be destructive to their overall health. Ways to overcome this fear are specific to the individual. Often adults seem to become less fearful when given more information about the surgery, those who will be performing it, or the things to expect during recovery; 69% said that they had received much information and half of the patients trusted the ophthalmologist to do his best. Although adults have less fear of surgery than children, the impact of this fear can still be just as great for both. Fear of surgery no matter who has it can be harmful to the patient if not taken care of properly before the surgery. Fear of dental work Fear of surgery is not the only fear based on medical procedures that can be harmful to the health of those who experience it; fear of dental work can also be dangerous if taken to an extreme. Dental fear has been ranked fifth among the most common fears. (DeJongh, Morris, Schoemakers, & Ter Horst, 1995)Dental fear: Comparisons Between Younger and Older Adults, M. Michelle Rowe, PhD American Journal of Health Studies: 20(4) 2005 pg. 219-224 Those who start with dental fear when they are young and continue with it into adulthood can have total avoidance of all dental work, causing problems for their health.Dental Fear in Children- a proposed model, H.R. Chapman and N.C. Kirby-Turner, British Dental Journal, Vol. 187, No.8 October 23, 1999 Fear of dental care is often diagnosed using a fear measurement instrument like Corah‚Äôs Dental Anxiety Scale or the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale. =Children= Dental fear in children varies from 3%-21% depending on age and method used to measure dental fear. ‚ÄúA very young child may find the smells of a dental surgery and the sounds of the equipment working very overwhelming‚Äù says H.R. Chapman and N. C. Kirby-Turner. Such overwhelming situations can make a child afraid and if the fear is not corrected, it can become harder to get the child to participate in dental procedures. Some forms of treatment for children who do experience dental fear include allowing the family to come into the room with them to allow the child to see that the other members of the family are not scared, allowing the child to have time to explore the room and the equipment used on them, under the supervision of the dentist, to become familiar with the things surrounding them. Other methods include tell-show-do, positive reinforcement, distraction, nonverbal communication or even general anesthesia and conscious sedation.A Controlled Trial of the impact of exposure to positive images of dentistry on anticipatory dental fear in children, C. Fox and J.T. Newton, Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology 2006; 34: 455-459 =Adults= When fear of dental work is not overcome in childhood it is very likely to continue into adulthood, causing a total avoidance of dental visits, which can lead to poor hygiene and lack of proper care for their teeth. Both age and gender have huge differences in how people express and deal with their fear of dental work. Overall women express a fear of dental procedures more than men.Gender differences in reported dental fear and fear of dental pain, Marc W. Heft, Xiaoxian Meng, Margaret M. Bradley and Peter J. Lang Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology 2007; 35: 421-428 Although dental anxiety is shown to be lower in men than in women, men expect more pain from the procedure. This expectance of pain leads many to miss appointments and be unwilling to seek professional help for simple things like toothaches. These simple things can lead to larger problems resulting in decaying teeth and poorly cared for gums. Age also makes a difference in how dental work is dealt with. Dental fear in young adults (ages 18‚Äì23) is significantly higher than fear in adults (ages 26‚Äì79) showing that over the years, with maturity the fear of dental work decreases. Still many are making appointments and breaking them or not making them at all, leading to a deterioration of their dental condition. Treatment for this medical fear is similar to that of the treatment of adults who suffer from fear of surgery. Explanations of what is going on can help, also dentists speaking to patients with less embarrassing wording (such as calling what they have a phobia or treating them like a child while discussing their problem) to encourage them to express and cope with their dental fear. Fear of doctors and fear of needles Two of the most common fears of medical procedures are the fear of doctors and the fear of needles. These simple fears, when not overcome by patients, either by themselves or with medical help, can cause great problems in the future for their health. =Fear of doctors= People of all ages deal with fear of doctors (iatrophobia). Children often express fear by trying to hide from doctors when their parents take them in for checkups or by trying to avoid going to the doctor by not telling their parents when they don‚Äôt feel well. This fear as a child can be easily treated in much the same way that doctors deal with children in surgery. An explanation or example (like seeing the doctor check an older sibling, or a stuffed animal) can help a child feel more comfortable with what the doctor will do for them. Fear of doctors for adults can be extreme. Avoidance of visiting a doctor can lead to problems with not only short term but also long term health. There is a medical condition called white coat hypertension that deals with the raising of high blood pressure while in the presence of doctors.White coat Hypertension: how should it be diagnosed? E O‚ÄôBrien Journal of Human Hypertension 1999 13, 801-802 Such high blood pressure is not good for health considerations, so this fear leads to more complications in health aspects of life for those who deal with it. =Fear of needles= The fear of needles (also known as trypanophobia) is sometimes a complex condition that can cause serious health problems that may sometimes result in the death of the patient. Some needle phobics refuse to receive shots that are mandatory, thus leading to greater risk of getting certain diseases, and many avoid treatment for serious medical conditions. Needle phobia is unique in the fact that it is a phobia that is documented to have resulted directly in the deaths of a few patients. In the New England Journal of Medicine, Lountzis and Rahman published an article about a 34-year-old woman who had a growth on her fingers that doctors were unable to completely remove because of her fear of needles.Lountzis and Rahman 359 (2): 177, July 10, 2008 The New England Journal of Medicine Notes and references =Articles used= * Specific Phobias: Clinical Applications of Evidence-Based Psychotherapy * Fears, Phobias, and Rituals: Panic, Anxiety and their Disorders * Phobic Disorders and Panic in Adults: A guide to Assessment and Treatment * Kids and Surgery by: Gorman, Christine, Time, 0040781X, 06/07/99, Vol. 153, Issue 22 * Assuaging Children‚Äôs Fear of Surgery, by Linda Saslow The New York Times, January 7, 1990 * The Children‚Äôs Surgical Worries Questionnaire: Reliability and Validity of a New Self-Report Measure. * Surgery Patients‚Äô Number-One Fear.

It was founded in 1973 by a group of Delhi's radical theatre amateurs who sought to take theatre to the people. Theatre personality Safdar Hashmi is the best-known figure associated with the troupe. Janam collects donations after each performance and funds its work in this manner. As a matter of policy, the group does not accept donations or grants from state, corporate or NGO agencies. The company does street as well as open-air proscenium performances, and also occasionally organises talks, discussions, workshops, exhibitions, film shows, etc. The company has performed its plays in festivals organised by Prithvi Theatre (Mumbai), National School of Drama (New Delhi), Sahitya Kala Parishad (New Delhi), Natrang Pratishthan (New Delhi), Sangeet Natak Akademi (Kerala), Natya Akademi (West Bengal) and others. So far this group of self-trained actors has done over 8,500 performances of nearly 80-odd street plays and 16 proscenium plays in about 140 cities in India. The company has performed outside India once, in spring 2007, when they toured the United States, performing, lecturing and conducting workshops on several university and colleges campuses.  Early history  Janam was founded in 1973 by a group of Delhi‚Äôs left-wing theatre amateurs, who sought to take theatre to the people. It was inspired by the spirit of the Indian People‚Äôs Theatre Association (IPTA). Its early plays, though initially designed for the proscenium, were performed on makeshift stages and chaupals in the big and small towns and villages of North India. It also experimented with street skits. Janam‚Äôs street theatre journey began in October 1978. The first play Machine with lyrical, stylised dialogues depicted the exploitation of industrial labour. Janam has played a significant role in popularising street theatre as a form of voicing anger and public opinion. It has done plays on price rise, elections, communalism, economic policy, unemployment, trade union rights, globalisation, women‚Äôs rights, education system, etc. Some of its best-known street plays are Hatyare, Samrath ko Nahi Dosh Gosain, Aurat, Raja ka Baja, Apaharan Bhaichare Ka, Halla Bol, Mat Banto Insaan Ko, Sangharsh Karenge Jitenge, Andhera Aaftaab Mangega, Jinhe Yakeen Nahin Tha, Aartanaad, Rahul Boxer, Nahin Qabul, Voh Bol Uthi and Yeh Dil Mange More Guruji. This form of theatre has become a vital cultural tool for workers, revolutionaries and social activists. Street theatre addresses topical events and social phenomenon and takes them straight to peoples‚Äô places of work and residence.  Safdar Hashmi  Safdar Hashmi was Janam's Convenor, who was killed in performance in 1989. The attack on Janam took place on 1 January that year, in Sahibabad, an industrial township on the outskirts of Delhi. The play being performed was Halla Bol, in support of workers' demands. This play, and its previous version Chakka Jam, were both done in support of a seven-day strike of industrial workers in November 1988. A spectator, Ram Bahadur, was also killed in the attack. There were massive protests all over the country following this murder and these protests led eventually to the formation of the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (Sahmat) in Delhi. Hashmi, a founder member of Janam, was a brilliant theoretician and practitioner of political theatre, especially street theatre. A versatile personality, he was a playwright, a lyricist, a theatre director, a designer and an organiser. He also wrote for children. His film scripts were much acclaimed. He wrote on various aspects of culture and related issues in journals and newspapers. Safdar was a member of the C.P.I. (M). In recognition of his contribution to the street theatre movement and to the growth of a democratic culture, the University of Calcutta in 1989 conferred on Safdar the degree of D.Litt. posthumously. Safdar was born to Haneef Hashmi and Qamar Azad on 12 April 1954 in Delhi. He spent his childhood in Aligarh and finished his schooling in Delhi. He did his M.A. in English literature from University of Delhi. After short stints of teaching in the universities of Garhwal, Kashmir and Delhi he worked in the Press Institute of India and then joined as the Press Information Officer of the Govt. of West Bengal in Delhi. In 1984 he gave up his job to work full-time as a political cultural activist. In 1980, Habib Tanvir directed the play Moti Ram ka Satyagraha for Janam. Every year, Janam and CITU jointly organise an event to commemorate Hashmi's martyrdom at Jhandapur, at the same place where the 1989 attack had taken place.  Janam after Safdar  Since 1989 Janam has been engaged in both street and proscenium theatre (including Moteram ka Satyagraha, Satyashodhak, Varun ke Bete, Hum Yahin Rahenge, Ek Aurat Hypatia Bhi Thi). In 1993 it began a bilingual theatre quarterly Nukkad Janam Samvaad and also instituted the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Lecture series. Among Janam‚Äôs recent proscenium plays is Aazadi Ne Jab Dastak Di, based on Manini Chatterjee‚Äôs book Do and Die. In January 2004, Janam created Bush ka Matlab Jhadi (Bush is a just a bush!), a multimedia presentation celebrating the anti-imperialist sentiment the world over. The play used giant masks, video projection, and live music to create a hilarious expose of the US-UK role in Iraq, their ambitions of world conquest, and the people‚Äôs resistance to it. The play was the outcome of Janam‚Äôs collaboration with many artists including Surajit Sarkar (video artist), Arunkumar (sculptor), Kriti Arora (artist), Kanishka Prasad (architect), and Ashish Ghosh (music director). This 45-minute play was commissioned by the World Social Forum in Mumbai. Later in 2004 Janam produced a proscenium play Shambookvadh on the question of caste. This play is scripted by Brijesh, has music by Kajal Ghosh, and is directed by Sudhanva Deshpande. The play was invited to the National School of Drama‚Äôs theatre festival in 2006, and to the Prithvi Festival in November 2006. In the summer of 2008, Janam produced Ulte Hor Zamaaney Aye, a proscenium play written by Brijesh, with music by Kajal Ghosh and directed by Sudhanva Deshpande. This was a black comedy about a woman who struggles to get treatment for her husband, who is initially mistaken for a bomb blast victim in a hospital, but dropped like a hot brick when they find out he is actually an industrial worker. Among Janam‚Äôs recent street plays, Yeh Dil Mange More Guruji is on the attempts of the Hindu Right brigade to destroy India‚Äôs secular and democratic framework; Aakhri Juloos is on the right to protest; Yeh Bhi Hinsa Hai is a play against the growing violence on women; One Two ka Four is a reworked version of an earlier play, Nahi Qubool, on the nuclear deal; Yeh Hum Kyon Sahen is on the conditions of workers in and around Delhi.  Safar, the mobile theatre  In 1997 Janam constructed an innovative and dismantleable mobile theatre, Safar (acronym for Safdar Rangmanch), to take proscenium plays to working class areas. Safar is a flexible, innovative structure designed by Janak Mistry. It is set up by the actors of Janam wherever they go to perform their large proscenium plays, and is equipped with lights and a sound system. It can be used for a variety of purposes, and various kinds of spaces can be created in it. It can seat about 600-700 people.  Studio Safdar, Shadi pur  In 2012, Janam moved into its own space. Located about 6 km west of Connaught Place is a neighbourhood known as Shadi Khampur, where the group has created a small black box theatre, called Studio Safdar. Janam also has premises on the top floor of the same building, and uses the open terrace to do its own rehearsals. Studio Safdar is envisaged as a space that can used by theatre and other artists to experiment in, create new work, and to show it. The larger idea of how the space came into being and the activities therein within the first year of its establishment are explained by Sudhanva Deshpande in interviews here and here. Next door to Studio Safdar is the May Day Bookstore and Cafe, managed and run by LeftWord Books.  In popular culture  The 1989 Hindi film, Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro, directed by Saeed Akhtar Mirza, was dedicated to the memory of Safdar Hashmi. The 2008 Hindi film, Halla Bol, directed by Rajkumar Santoshi, was inspired by his life of founder Safdar Hashmi, and also depicts a scene, where a street theatre activist is shown being beaten by political goons, but turns into a catalyst for public uprising in the film.Rajkumar Santoshi Interview Monsters and Critics.

Plants in this genus are shrubs with five petals joined to form a tube-shaped flower with four stamens of unequal lengths. Description Plants in the genus Pityrodia are evergreen shrubs with erect, usually cylindrical branches. The leaves are simple, net- veined and their bases partly wrap around the stem (decurrent). The flowers may occur singly or in groups and exhibit left-right symmetry. There are 5 sepals which are joined at their bases and 5 petals joined to form a tube. The tube may have 5, unequally sized lobes at the tip or two \\"lips\\" - the upper lip having two lobes and the lower one three. There are four stamens with one pair longer than the other. The fruit is a drupe containing up to four seeds. Taxonomy and naming The genus was first described by Robert Brown in 1810. Brown published his description in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae and designated Pityrodia salvifolia as the type species. The name Pityrodia is an Ancient Greek word meaning \\"scale-like\\". Pityrodia was originally included in the Verbenaceae. In a review of the genus in 1979, Ahmad Abid Munir included Pityrodia and nine other genera in a family Chloanthaceae, all endemic to Australia and sometimes referred to as \\"Australian Verbenaceae\\". The name Chloanthaceae has not been widely adopted and Pityrodia is now included in the Lamiaceae. Distribution In his 1979 paper, Munir described 27 species from Western Australia, 16 from the Northern Territory and one from Queensland, but in 2011, Barry Conn, Murray Henwood and Nicola Streiber transferred some species to Dasymalla, Hemiphora and Quoya and raised a new genus Muniria to which four species of the former Pityrodia were transferred. A new species from Western Australia, (Pityrodia iphthima) has since been described. The species remaining in Pityrodia are: *Pityrodia augustensis Munir \\\\- Mt.

Mughal Road is the road between Bufliaz, a town in the Poonch district, to the Shopian district, in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, India. The 84-kilometre road traces a historic route used in the Mughal period over the Pir Panjal Pass, at an altitude of 3,500 m (11,500 ft), higher than the Banihal pass at 2,832 m. The road connects Poonch and Rajouri to Srinagar in the Kashmir valley, and reduces the distance between Shopian and Poonch from 588 km to 126 km. It also provides an alternative route into the Kashmir valley off the Jammu-Srinagar highway. The road passes through Buffliaz, Behramgalla, Chandimarh, Poshana, Chattapani, Peer Ki Gali, Aliabad, Zaznar, Dubjan, Hirpora, and Shopian.  History  A route linking Hirapur (modern Hirpora) in the Kashmir Valley with Rajauri via the Pir Panjal Pass (Peer Ki Gali) has been use from ancient times. During the period of the sultans, it was extended to Bhimber. Historian Mohibbul Hasan says it played an important role during this period. After conquering the Kashmir Valley, the emperor Akbar strengthened the route into an \\"Imperial Road\\" stretching from Lahore to Kashmir. In modern times, the route has been referred to as the \\"Mughal Road\\".  Construction  The new road was proposed in the 1950s to improve the economy of the Kashmir valley. Then Chief Minister Sheikh Abdullah took up this project in 1979 and named it the \\"Mughal Road\\", but it came to a halt as terrorism took over. Bafliaz Bridge on the road was blown up by the terrorists. Actual construction began in October 2005 with a target of completion in March 2007 and an estimated cost of 255 crore rupees. A conservation trust petitioned the Supreme Court to stop construction, citing the disturbance to animals in the Hirpora Wildlife Sanctuary, especially the endangered Markhor goat; and claiming the road would get early snowfall in winter and hence would not serve as an alternate route to the existing Jammu- Srinagar highway. However, the Court gave conditional permission for the construction of the road. Construction was to be completed in December 2008, but was delayed for a number of reasons, including the Amar Nath land row. The road was opened on 12 July 2009 for inspection by state legislators, officials, engineers, and others. It was supposed to be thrown open for light vehicles in October 2010 but the law-and-order situation in Kashmir in 2010 imposed delays. A double-lane road was completed and opened for light vehicles in August 2012. A Mughal Road Car Rally has been held annually since 2010. It covers 600 km, including the picturesque stretch across Pir Panjal.

The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.org. *Denisonia devisi ‚Äì De Vis's banded snake, De Vis' banded snake *Denisonia maculata ‚Äì ornamental snake Etymology The generic name, Denisonia, is in honor of William Thomas Denison, mid 19th century governor of parts of Australia. The specific name, devisi, is in honor of English herpetologist Charles Walter De Vis.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Genus Denisonia, p. 69; species Denisonia devisi, p. 71). Description D. devisi is a short, thick, and slightly flat snake. The eyes are set near the top of the head and have a conspicuous iris. D. devisi is yellowish brown to olive green in colour with irregular, ragged edged narrow dark bands running across the body. De Vis's banded snake is usually confused with death adders as both have thick, banded bodies. The main difference is that the De Vis' banded snake's tail does not taper abruptly and its head is not broad and triangular. Geographic range D. devisi is distributed throughout the alluvial flats of the mid eastern interiors of Australia. Behaviour and habitat D. devisi is a sluggish snake inhabiting low-lying areas and particularly near sites subjected to seasonal flooding. During the day, this adder stays in soil cracks or deep cavities and emerges at night to feed on frogs. Reproduction D. devisi gives birth to fully formed young (viviparous).

It is currently a Franciscan monastery. History The predecessor of the current castle occupied the site since c. 1000, and first belonged to the counts von Peilestein (known locally as \\"Pil≈°tajn\\"), including Hemma of Gurk (), an 11th-century saint and member of the family. Around 1550, a Count Tattenbach rebuilt the castle in renaissance style, at the same time adding a defensive ditch to guard against Turkish incursions. In 1658 the castle was bought by Baron Ivan Zakmardy of Zagreb, who began converting it into a monastery, and in 1663 donated it to brothers of the Pauline order from Lepoglava, Croatia. Between 1665 and 1675, they completed the conversion and added a handsome baroque church, whose altar of the Assumption of Mary is considered one of the finest baroque altars in Slovenia. In 1740, the monk Ivan Ranger painted the entire presbytery, and a side chapel was built and decorated. The Paulines also established a pharmacy, among the oldest in Europe; the monastery contains a fresco honoring Paracelsus. The anticlerical reforms of Joseph II forced the monks out, as their activities did not include running a school or other charitable institution, and Olimje was not a parish, which it became in 1785. The former monastery was bought by the noble house of Attems in 1805; due to high taxes, the new owners could however not afford the upkeep of the entire structure, and had the north and west wings torn down. The castle was nationalized after World War II. In 1974, a major earthquake badly damaged it; soon afterward it was thoroughly renovated with the assistance of national, municipal, and parish funds. The sanctuary and parish were given to the Conventual Franciscans in 1990. On the 15th of August, 1999, they revived the monastery after 217 years. Today they care for both pilgrims and the tourists visiting the historic castle and pharmacy. Due to public interest, they have also established a herbal apothecary.

Adriano.Conradus Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii aevi I, editio altera (Monasterii 1913), p. 11.

In 1305, after the Conclave of 1304-1305 and two weeks after his coronation, the new Pope, Clement V, made him Archpriest of S. Peter's Basilica in Rome.Monks of the Order of S. Benedict, Regestum Clementis V I (Rome 1885), no. 4 (September 19, 1305). During the Avignon Papacy Napoleone realigned himself with the Colonna and testified against Boniface at the latter's posthumous trial. Cardinal Napoleone Orsini participated prominently in the long Conclave of 1 May 1314 to 5 September 1316, following the death of Clement V. There was, to be sure, a long intermission in the proceedings, caused by multiple forces which began with dissensions among the retinues of the cardinals, included an attempt to set fire to the Conclave, and the direct involvement of the Royal family of France. The Conclave finally elected a Gascon, Cardinal Jacques Du√®se on 7 August 1314. He was crowned in the Cathedral of S. Etienne in Lyon on 5 September 1316. Immediately after the election, even before the Coronation, Cardinal Napoleone managed to obtain from the new Pope for the benefit of his cousin Paul de Comite, a Papal Chaplain, the reversion of a canonry and prebend in the Church of Lichfield; and for the benefit of another cousin Peter de Comite the confirmation of a Canonry and prebend in the Church of London.Bliss, Calendar II, p. 124. In the Conclave of 1334, following the death of Pope John XXII, he participated as senior Cardinal Deacon, prior Diaconum. The Conclave began on 13 December 1334 in the Apostolic Palace in Avignon with twenty-four cardinals in attendance. On the evening of 20 December 1334, they chose Cardinal Jacques Fournier, O.Cist., of Savardun near Toulouse, in the Diocese of Pamiers, who adopted the name Benedict XII. On 8 January 1335, he was crowned by Cardinal Napoleone Orsini in the Dominican Church in Avignon.Ptolemy of Lucca, in Theiner, Vol. XXV, p. 20; Baluzius I, p. 825. Cardinal Napoleone was diplomatically active during the pontificates of Pope Clement V and Pope John XXII. He wrote his Testament at Avignon on 13 April 1337, and revised it on 13 February 1342.\\"Orsini di Monterotondo,\\" Libro d'Oro della Nobilta mediterranea, no. A 1. He died at the age of seventy-nine in 1342, at Avignon, only one month before the death of Pope Benedict XII. He had participated in six conclaves, and narrowly missed his seventh.

It was commissioned by the Corporation of the City of Birmingham for its new Museum and Art Gallery in 1887,Wildman, pp. 293-94 two years after Burne-Jones was elected Honorary President of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists. At 101 1/8 x 152 inches, The Star of Bethlehem was the largest watercolour of the 19th century. It was completed in 1890It is signed \\"EBJ 1890\\" (Wildman, p. 293) and was first exhibited in 1891. Origin of the composition Adoration of the Magi tapestry, 1887 In 1886, John Prideaux Lightfoot had approached William Morris and Burne-Jones to create a tapestry as a gift for their alma mater Exeter College, Oxford, suggesting the Adoration of the Magi as a subject. The two quickly agreed. Burne-Jones completed a 26 x 38 inch modello or design in watercolour and bodycolour heightened with gold in 1887. Morris and his assistant John Henry Dearle based the cartoons for the tapestry weavers on Burne-Jones's watercolour, changing the colour scheme and adding background details including the flowering plants characteristic of Dearle's tapestry work. The Adoration of the Magi tapestry was woven by Morris & Co. at Merton Abbey over the next two years and displayed in their London showrooms at Easter 1890 before being presented to Exeter College. The Adoration was ultimately the most commercially successful of all Morris & Co. tapestries. Of the ten versions woven,Parry 1996, p. 294 one is in Eton College Chapel, one in the Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, one in the Art Gallery of South Australia, and one at Manchester Metropolitan University. The original hangs in the Exeter College Chapel. The painting Star of Bethlehem, from The Flower Book. The Birmingham commission gave Burne- Jones an opportunity to revisit his tapestry design as a full-scale painting. The colour palette with its rich blue-greens differs greatly from both the original watercolour modello and the Morris tapestry, and its large size allowed him to add a wealth of fine detail not possible in the tapestry version, especially in the clothing. Burne-Jones worked on a ladder, and wrote \\"a tiring thing it is physically to do, up my steps and down...\\" A photograph by Barbara Leighton Sotheby, preserved as a platinum print by Frederick Hollyer, shows Burne-Jones on his ladder in front of the work-in-progress. The Star of Bethlehem was completed in 1890 and exhibited at the New Gallery, London, in the spring of 1891 before being sent on to the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery, where it remains. Burne-Jones used a different pose of the angel holding the star, this time in a warm colour palette, to illustrate the wildflower called Star of Bethlehem (Ornithogalum umbellatum) in The Flower Book, a collection of watercolours on themes inspired by the names of flowers that he completed between 1882 and 1898.

It operated as a rump state after the collapse of the Yuan dynasty of China in 1368 and lasted until its conquest by the Jurchen-led Later Jin dynasty in 1635. The Northern Yuan dynasty began with the end of Yuan rule in China proper and the retreat of the Yuan remnants led by Toghon Tem√ºr (Emperor Huizong of Yuan) to the Mongolian steppe. This period featured factional struggles and the often only nominal role of the Great Khan. Dayan Khan and Mandukhai Khatun reunited the entire Mongol nation in the 15th century.Jack Weatherford-The Secret History of the Mongol Queens However, the former's distribution of his empire among his sons and relatives as fiefs caused the decentralization of the imperial rule.Ren√© Grousset-The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia, p. 508 Despite this decentralization, a remarkable concord continued within the Dayan Khanid aristocracy, and intra- Chinggisid civil war remained unknown until the reign of Ligdan Khan (1604‚Äì1634), C.P.Atwood ‚Äì Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, see: Batum√∂ngke Dayan Qaghan who saw much of his power weakened in his quarrels with the Mongol tribes and was defeated by the Manchus. The last sixty years of this period featured the intensive penetration of Tibetan Buddhism into Mongolian society.  Name  The regime that existed between 1368 and 1635 is known by various names, including the Northern Yuan (dynasty).Jae-un Kang, Suzanne Lee, Sook Pyo Lee, \\"The Land of Scholars: Two Thousand Years of Korean Confucianism\\" The dynastic name of \\"Great Yuan\\" () was officially used between 1368 and 1388, as was the preceding Yuan dynasty. Following the death of Uskhal Khan T√∂g√ºs Tem√ºr, the \\"Great Yuan\\" dynastic name along with other Chinese-style imperial titles were abandoned by his successor Jorightu Khan Yes√ºder, hence the name \\"Northern Yuan\\" is sometimes limited in its usage to referencing only the period between 1368 and 1388.Luc Kwanten, \\"Imperial Nomads: A History of Central Asia, 500‚Äì1500\\" The term \\"Northern Yuan\\" is derived from the corresponding term \\"ÂåóÂÖÉ\\" (Bƒõi Yu√°n) in Chinese, in which the prefix \\"Northern\\" is used to distinguish between the Yuan dynasty established in 1271 and the regime that existed after 1368. The \\"Great Yuan\\" dynastic title was briefly reintroduced during the reign of Dayan Khan whose regnal name \\"Dayan\\" came from the Chinese term \\"Â§ßÂÖÉ\\" (D√† Yu√°n; lit. \\"Great Yuan\\"). Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that Taisun Khan and Esen Taishi had also used the \\"Great Yuan\\" dynastic name and Chinese imperial titles during their rule. In English, the term \\"Northern Yuan (dynasty)\\" is generally used to cover the entire period from 1368 to 1635 for historiographical purpose. Apart from \\"Great Yuan\\" (before 1388 and during the rule of Dayan Khan), the Mongols called their nation \\"Ikh Mongol Uls\\", meaning the \\"Great Mongol State\\".

After eliminating the Song dynasty in 1276 and destroying the last Chinese resistance in 1279, the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty (1271‚Äì1368) ruled all of China for about a century. Even prior to the Yuan dynasty, the Mongols had dominated Northern China for more than 40 years, since the time they conquered the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1234. Mongol rule in China began to collapse in 1344 when the Yellow River flooded and the Yellow River changed course, causing widespread droughts, flooding, and making the Grand Canal impassable. In 1351, the Red Turban Rebellion erupted in the Huai River valley, which saw the rise of Zhu Yuanzhang, a Han Chinese peasant, who eventually established the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) in South China. In 1368, a Ming army advanced on the Yuan capital Khanbaliq or Dadu (present-day Beijing). = Retreat to Mongolian Steppe (1368‚Äì1388) = Ming dynasty and the Northern Yuan in the early 15th century. The Mongols lost some lands in China proper after the Ming defeated Toghus Temur in 1388. Toghon Tem√ºr (r. 1333‚Äì1370), the last ruler of the Yuan, fled north to Shangdu (located in present-day Inner Mongolia) from Dadu upon the approach of Ming forces. He tried to regain Dadu but failed and died in Yingchang (located in present-day Inner Mongolia) two years later (1370). Yingchang was seized by the Ming shortly after his death. The Mongols retreated to Karakorum after the fall of Yingchang in 1370, where they carried on calling themselves the Great Yuan, known retroactively as the Northern Yuan. The Ming army pursued the Yuan remnants into Mongolia in 1372, but were defeated by Biligt√º Khan Ayushiridara (r. 1370‚Äì1378) and his general K√∂ke Tem√ºr (d. 1375). In 1375, Naghachu, a Mongol official of Biligtu Khan in Liaoyang province invaded Liaodong with aims of restoring Mongol power in China. Although he continued to hold southern Manchuria, Naghachu eventually surrendered to the Ming dynasty in 1387‚Äì88.Willard J. Peterson, John King Fairbank, Denis Twitchett' The Cambridge History of China, vol. 7, p. 158 The Yuan loyalists under the Kublaid prince Basalawarmi (the Prince of Liang) in Yunnan and Guizhou were also defeated and killed by the Ming earlier in 1381‚Äì82.Raoul Naroll, Vern L. Bullough, Frada Naroll. Military deterrence in history: a pilot cross-historical survey, p. 97 In 1380, the Ming invaded Northern Yuan and sacked Karakorum, although they were eventually forced to withdraw. Around 70,000 Mongol captives were taken. In 1387, the Ming defeated the Uriankhai Mongols, and in the following year they achieved decisive victory around the Buir Lake against Uskhal Khan T√∂g√ºs Tem√ºr.Michael Prawdin, The Mongol Empire, its Rise and Legacy p. 389.

According to the traditional Chinese political orthodoxy, there could be only one legitimate dynasty whose rulers were blessed by Heaven to rule as Emperor of China (see Mandate of Heaven), so the Ming also denied the Yuan remnants' legitimacy as emperors of China, although the Ming did consider the previous Yuan which it had succeeded to be a legitimate dynasty. = Oirat domination (1388‚Äì1478) = Location of the Oirats In 1388, the Northern Yuan throne was taken over by Jorightu Khan Yes√ºder, a descendant of Arik B√∂ke (Tolui's son), with the support of the Oirats. In the following year, one of Uskhal Khan's subjects, Gunashiri, a descendant of Chagatai Khan, founded his own small state called Kara Del in Hami.Ed. Reuven Amitai-Preiss, Reuven Amitai, David Morgan-The Mongol empire and its legacy, p. 294 The following century saw a succession of Genghisid rulers, many of whom were mere figureheads put on the throne by those warlords who happened to be the most powerful. From the end of the 14th century there appear designations such as \\"period of small kings\\" (–ë–∞–≥–∞ —Ö–∞–∞–¥—ã–Ω “Ø–µ).Bat-Ochir Bold. Mongolian nomadic society, p. 93 On one side stood the Western Mongols and on the other the Eastern Mongols. While the Oirats drew their khans from the descendants of Ariq B√∂ke and other princes, Arugtai of the Asud supported the old Yuan khans of Kublaid descent. The House of Ogedei also briefly attempted to reunite the Mongols under their rule. The Mongols eventually split into three main groups: the Oirats in the west, the Uriankhai in northeast, and the Khorchin between the two. The Uriankhai surrendered to the Ming dynasty in the 1390s. The Ming divided them into the Three Guards: Doyin, Tai'nin and Fuyu. Yuan relations with the Ming dynasty consisted of sporadic bursts of conflict intermingled with periods of peaceful relations and border trade. In 1402, √ñr√ºg Tem√ºr Khan (Guilichi) abolished the dynastic name Great Yuan; he was however defeated by √ñljei Tem√ºr Khan (Bunyashiri, r. 1403‚Äì1412), the prot√©g√© of Tamerlane (d. 1405), in 1403. Most of the Mongol noblemen under Arugtai chingsang sided with √ñljei Temur. The Yongle Emperor (r. 1402‚Äì1424) issued √ñljei Tem√ºr an ultimatum demanding his acceptance of the Ming dynasty as a suzerain state. √ñljei Temur refused, resulting in the Ming dynasty conducting several campaigns against the Mongols. In 1409, a Ming army of 100,000 entered Mongolia but suffered a defeat against √ñljei Temur and Arugtai at the Battle of Kherlen. In the following year, the Yongle Emperor personally led an expedition into Mongolia and defeated the Mongols. After the death of √ñljei Temur, the Oirats under their leader Bahamu (Mahmud) (d. 1417) enthroned an Ariq B√∂kid Delbeg Khan in 1412. Originally the Ming had supported the Oirats in their power struggle with the eastern Mongols, but as the Oirats gained supremacy over them, the Ming withdrew their support. After 1417 Arugtai became dominant again, and Yongle campaigned against him in 1422 and 1423. Bahamu's successor Toghan pushed Arugtai east of the Greater Khingan range in 1433. The Oirats killed him in the west of Baotou the next year. Arugtai's ally Adai Khan (r. 1425‚Äì1438) made a last stand in Ejene before he was murdered too. Toghan died in the very year of his victory over Adai. His son Esen Taishi (r. 1438‚Äì1454) brought the Oirats to the height of their power. Under his puppet khans, he drove back Moghulistan and crushed the Uriankhai Three Guards, Kara Del and the Jurchens. In 1449 he defeated a 500,000 strong Ming army with just 20,000 cavalry and captured the Zhengtong Emperor in what came to be known as the Tumu Crisis.D. Morgan, The Mongols, p. 178 However, after this astounding victory, Esen failed to take the Ming capital of Beijing. In the following year a peace was concluded between the two sides and the captive emperor was allowed to return home. After executing the rebellious Tayisung Khan (r. 1433‚Äì1453) and his brother Agbarjin in 1453, Esen took the title of not just khan, but also Yuan Emperor.Ph. de Heer, The care-taker emperor, p. 99 This called widespread dissent among the Genghisids, and in 1455, a series of revolts resulted in Esen's death. His death started the decline of the Oirats, who would not recover until their rise as the Dzungar Khanate in the 17th century. From Esen's death to 1481 different warlords of the Kharchin, the Belguteids and Ordos Mongols fought over succession and had their Genghisid khans enthroned. The Mongolian chroniclers call some of them the Uyghurs and they might have had some ties with the Hami oasis.C. P. Atwood. Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p. 408 During his reign, Manduulun Khan (1475‚Äì1478) effectively won over most of the Mongol warlords before he died in 1478. = Restoration (1479‚Äì1600) =  Second reunification  The Tumens of Mongolia proper and relict states of the Mongol Empire by 1500 Manduulun's young khatun Mandukhai proclaimed a seven-year-old boy named Batumongke of Genghisid descent as khan. Mandukhai made persistent efforts to bring the various Mongol tribes under control. The new khan took the title Dayan meaning the \\"Great Yuan\\".Memory of the Dai Yuan ulus (the Great Yuan dynasty) Mandukhai and Dayan Khan defeated the Oirats and the taishis who ruled the Yellow River Mongols. However, one of them killed Dayan Khan's son and revolted when Dayan Khan appointed his son, Ulusbold, as jinong (crown prince) over them. Dayan Khan finally defeated the southwestern Mongols in 1510 with the assistance of his allies, Unebolad wang and the Four Oirats.Ming shi, p. 378 Making another of his sons jinong, he abolished old-Yuan court titles of taishi, chingsang, pingchan and chiyuan. From 1495 onward, Dayan exerted pressure on the Ming dynasty, which closed border-trade and killed his envoys. Dayan invaded Ming territory and subjugated the Uriankhai Three Guards, who had previously submitted to the Ming. As a result, the T√ºmed Mongols ruled in the Ordos region and they gradually extended their domain into northeastern Qinghai.W. D. Shakabpa, Tibet: A Political History In 1517, Dayan even threatened Beijing itself. Mongol armies raided the Ming dynasty not only in the north but also in the hitherto quiet west. The Ming dynasty lost Kara Del as a protectorate to the Turpan Khanate at the same time. Dayan kept defeating the Ming in battle right up until his death in 1543.G√©rard Chaliand. Nomadic empires: from Mongolia to the Danube, p.102 At the apogee of Dayan's reign, the Northern Yuan stretched from the Siberian tundra and Lake Baikal in the north, across the Gobi, to the edge of the Yellow River and south of it into the Ordos. The lands extended from the forests of Manchuria in the East past the Altai Mountains and out onto the steppes of Central Asia.Jack Weatherford. The Secret History of the Mongol Queens Dayan Khan's reorganization of the Mongols into six Eastern Mongol t√ºmens (literally \\"ten thousand\\") and four Oirats t√ºmens had far reaching effects on the development of Mongol society. * Left Wing: ** Khalkha tumen: Northern 7 otog: Jalaid, Besud, Eljigin, Gorlos, Kh√∂kh√ºid (Khukhuid), Khataghin, and later added Uriankhai.

The Barga and Buryats later became subject of Khalkha. The six Eastern Mongol t√ºmens were granted to his 11 sons while the four Oirat t√ºmens were ruled by taishi nobles. His youngest son Gersenji Khongtaiji of the Jalayir became the ruler of the Khalkha Mongols, the largest of the six t√ºmens. The t√ºmens functioned both as military units and as tribal administrative bodies who hoped to receive taijis, descended from Dayan Khan. Northern Khalkha people and Uriyankhan were attached to the South Khalkha of eastern Inner Mongolia and Doyin Uriyangkhan of the Three Guards, respectively. After the rebellion of the northern Uriankhai people, they were conquered in 1538 and mostly annexed by the northern Khalkha. However, his decision to divide the six tumens to his sons, or taijis, and local tabunangs- sons in law of the taijis created a decentralized system of Borjigin rule that secured domestic peace and outward expansion for a century. Despite this decentralization there was a remarkable concord within the new Mongol order created by Dayan Khan. Last reunification Realm of Altan Khan in 1571 Temple at Erdene Zuu monastery established by Abtai Khan in the Khalkha heartland in the 16th century. After Dayan Khan's death, the Northern Yuan began falling apart again under the two succeeding khans. By 1540 new regional circles of taijis and local tabunangs (imperial sons-in-law) of the taijis emerged in all the former Dayan Khan's domains. The khagan and the jinong had titular authority over the three right wing tumens. Darayisung G√∂deng Khan (r. 1547‚Äì1557) had to grant titles of khans to his cousins Altan, ruling the Tumed, and Bayaskhul, ruling the Kharchin. Under T√ºmen Jasagtu Khan (r. 1558‚Äì92), the realm was unified again with the aid of Altan Khan, Abtai Sain Khan, and Khutughtai Sechen Khongtaiji of Ordos. Jasagtu defeated the Uriankhai and Daghur Mongols and subjugated the Jurchens to the east. Abtai and Sechen brought many of the Oirat tribes under their domination. Altan conquered large parts of Qinghai and left one of his sons in charge there. Jasagtu also tried to unify the Mongols under a new code of law, written in the old Mongol script derived from the Uyghur script. A series of smallpox epidemics and lack of trade forced the Mongols to repeatedly plunder the districts of China. In 1571 the Ming opened trade with the three Right Wing Tumens.Our great Qing: the Mongols, Buddhism and the state in late imperial China By Johan Elverskog, p. 68 By the end of the 16th century, the Uriankhai Three Guards had lost their existence as a distinct group. Their Fuyu was absorbed by the Khorchin after they had moved to the Nonni River. Two other, Doyin and Tai'nin, were absorbed by the Five Khalkhas.Willard J. Peterson, John King Fairbank, Denis C. Twitchett. The Cambridge history of China: The Ch'ing empire to 1800, Volume 9, p. 16 Conversion to Buddhism Although Yuan emperors had previously adopted Buddhism, most Mongols ignored it and remained shamanist in their belief. From 1575, a large-scale conversion to Tibetan Buddhism in the Right Wing Tumens occurred. Jasagtu appointed a Tibetan Buddhist chaplain of the Karmapa order and agreed that Buddhism would henceforth become the state religion of Mongolia. In 1577, Altan and Sechen received the 3rd Dalai Lama, which started the conversion of Tumed and Ordos Mongols to Buddhism. Soon after the Oirats also adopted Buddhism. Numerous Tibetan lamas entered Mongolia to proselytize. =Fall (1600‚Äì1635)= Chahar- Jurchen War, 1619-1634 The White House of Tsogt Taij (White Castle) was built in 1601. By the reign of Ligdan Khan (r. 1604‚Äì34), the Northern Yuan tumens had ceased to function as a unified entity. Ligdan only controlled the Chahar tumen and the Khalkha and Oirat Mongols no longer obeyed his authority. Ligdan built a new capital in Chahar land known as Chaghan Baishin (White House) and promoted the building of Buddhist monasteries, translation of Tibetan literature, and trade with the Ming dynasty. In 1616, the Jurchens rose to the forefront of East Asian powers under the reign of Nurhaci. Although sharing many similar characteristics with the Mongols, the Jurchens were not nomads, but a tribal people who had adopted Chinese agricultural practices. Nurhaci had ambitions to conquer the Ming dynasty and sought allies in the Khorchin Mongols, subjects of Ligdan. The princes of Khorchin, Jarud and southern Khalkha Mongols made a formal alliance with the Jurchens from 1612 to 1624.Evelyn S. Rawski. The Last Emperors: A Social History of Qing Imperial Institutions, p. 493 In response, Ligdan waged war on the Mongol allies of the Jurchens in 1625. The Jurchen-Mongol army defeated Ligdan and forced him back. In the following year, Uuba Noyan of the Khorchin had his younger brother marry one of Nurhaci's daughters, cementing the alliance. Many of the Jurchens married Mongols. Ligdan appointed his own officials over the tumens and formed an elite military band to coerce opposition. In 1628, Ligdan defeated the Khorchins and Jurchen auxiliary at Zhaocheng but fled a large Jurchen punitive expedition. Only Tsogt Taiji (1581‚Äì1637) supported the Great Khan whilst other nobles of Khalkha remained neutral and inactive. In 1632, Ambaghai of the Khamag Mongols and his Jurchen Mongol allies defeated the Chahars and captured Ligdan's family. Ligdan lost any authority he had over the non-Chahar tumens. Ligdan died on his way to Qinghai to punish the Gelug order in 1634. His son, Ejei Khan, surrendered to the Qing dynasty and was said to give the Imperial Seal of the Mongols to Qing emperor Hong Taiji the next year (February 1635), ending the Northern Yuan.Ann Heirman, Stephan Peter Bumbacher. The spread of Buddhism, p. 395 After Ligdan Khan's death in 1634, the Mongols formed four Khanates, from west to east: * The Altan Khan of Khalkhas in the far west, founded by Sholoi Ubashi, great grandson of Geresandza. * The Dzasagtu Khans, khanate founded by Laikhor-khan, a cousin of the Altan Khan. * The Tushetu Khans at Ulaanbaatar founded by Abatai, another grandson. This was the senior branch. * The Sechen Khans at the eastern end of modern Mongolia, founded by Sholoi, a great-grandson. Aftermath Major Mongol and Jurchen rulers prior to Jurchen unification =Outer Mongolia= In 1636, Ambaghai declared himself khagan of all the Mongols but by then, all of Inner Mongolia had already been conquered by the Manchus, and Ambaghai too was under Manchu authority. The son of Ligdan, Ejei Khan, died under mysterious circumstances. His rank was given to his brother Abunai, who refused to attend court with the Manchus. Abunai's rank was then passed on to his son, Burni, who rebelled against the Manchus in 1675, but the uprising was defeated and Burni died in battle. The Qing emperors then placed the Chahar Mongols under their direct rule. In Outer Mongolia, the T√ºsheet Khan Gombodorj retained his independence and suzerainty over the Sechen and Jasagtu khans. However another independent entity known as Altan Khan of the Khalkha emerged in Jasagtu territory. With the loss of Inner Mongolia and the Imperial Mongol Seal, the Mongols had to search for a new source of authority. As a result, in 1639, Gombodorj's brother became the first Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the spiritual head of the Gelug Buddhists in Mongolia. Gombodorj did his best to maintain peaceful relations with the rising Manchus by sending tribute. He also stopped providing horses to the Ming dynasty. Diplomacy failed after the Manchus defeated the Ming in 1644 and seized Beijing. In 1646, a Mongol noyan rebelled against the Qing but was crushed under overwhelming odds. In 1647, Gombodorj met the Qing in battle with 50,000 cavalry and neither side were able to obtain a decisive victory. Although both sides suffered heavy losses, the Mongol army constituted a larger part of their overall forces than the Qing, signalling that the Mongols no longer had the numbers to directly confront the Qing in battle. In the mid-17th century, Gombodorj died and was succeeded by his young and inexperienced son Chikhundorj. In 1655, the Qing began interfering in Tusheet affairs by appointing their own lamas in Tusheet territory. Thus Outer Mongolia also gradually fell under Qing control. =Dzungar Khanate= Dzungar‚ÄìQing Wars, 1687‚Äì1757 Meanwhile, to the west, about 1600‚Äì1620 the Oirats united under Kharkhul. In 1635, the Oirats under Kharkhul's son Erdeni Batur formed the Dzungar Khanate. This unification was partly driven by their wars with the Altan Khans. When the Jasagtu Khan Shira lost part of his subjects to the T√ºsheet Khan Chikhundorj, Galdan Boshugtu Khan of the Dzungars moved his orda near the Altai Mountains to prepare an attack. Chikhundorj attacked the right wing of the Khalkhas and killed Shira in 1687. In 1688, Galdan dispatched troops under his younger brother Dorji-jav against Chikhundorj but they were eventually defeated and Dorji-jav was killed in battle. Chikhundorj then murdered Degdeehei Mergen Ahai of the Jasagtu Khan who was on the way to Galdan. To avenge the death of his brother, Galdan established friendly relations with the Russians who were already at war with Chikhundorj over territories near Lake Baikal. Armed with Russian firearms, Galdan led 30,000 Dzungar troops into Outer Mongolia in 1688 and defeated Chikhundorj in three days. The Siberian Cossacks, meanwhile, attacked and defeated a Khalkha army of 10,000 near Lake Baikal. After two bloody battles with the Dzungars near Erdene Zuu Monastery and Tomor, Chakhundorji and his brother Jebtsundamba Khutuktu Zanabazar fled across the Gobi Desert to the Qing dynasty and submitted to the Kangxi Emperor. By 1690, Galdan had control of Outer Mongolia as far as the edge of Manchuria, before turning his attention east towards Beijing. This expansion of the Dzungar state was viewed with worry by the Qing, which led the Kangxi Emperor (Enh-Amgalan khaan-in Mongolian) to block Galdan. Late in the summer of 1690, Galdan crossed the Kherlen River with a force of 20,000 and engaged a Qing army at Battle of Ulan Butung 350 kilometers north of Beijing near the western headwaters of the Liao River. Galdan was forced to retreat and escaped total destruction because the Qing army did not have the supplies or ability to pursue him. In 1696, the Kangxi Emperor led 100,000 troops into Mongolia. Galdan fled from the Kherlen only to be caught by another Qing army attacking from the west. He was defeated in the ensuing Battle of Jao Modo near the upper Tuul River. Galdan's wife, Anu, was killed and the Qing army captured 20,000 cattle and 40,000 sheep. Galdan fled with a small handful of followers. In 1697 he died in the Altai Mountains near Khovd on 4 April. Back in Dzungaria, his nephew Tsewang Rabtan, who had revolted in 1689, was already in control as of 1691. Outer Mongolia was thus incorporated into the Qing Empire, and the Khalkha leaders returned to Outer Mongolia as Qing vassals. A Qing garrison was installed at Ulaanbaatar. The Qing forces occupied Hami but did not advance into Dzungaria. The Dzungars later expanded into Tibet and Kazakhstan, but they too were conquered by the Qing dynasty in 1755, and all resistance was crushed by 1758.

The bomblet contained BZ, an incapacitating agent and was developed with the M43 in 1962. The M138s, along with all other U.S. BZ weapons were destroyed during the 1980s. History The U.S. Army Chemical Corps began mass-production of the chemical M43 BZ cluster bomb in March 1962.Smart, Jeffery K.

The M43 was designed to utilize the M138 bomblet. The M138, like its parent cluster bomb and all BZ munitions, were stored at Pine Bluff Arsenal in Arkansas. Between 1988 and 1989 all U.S. BZ munitions, including the M138 bomblets were demilitarized and destroyed.Mauroni, Albert J. Chemical Demilitarization: Public Policy Aspects, (Google Books), Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, p. 19, (). Specifications The M138 bomblet had the largest continuous diameter of any chemical bomblet in the U.S. arsenal, a full 72 millimeters (mm).Trott, p. 1 The M138 also possessed the thickest steel walls of U.S. bomblets, about 3 mm. The M43 cluster bomb was designed to hold 57 M138s, arranged in three stacks of 19 bomblets. Each bomblet held about 6 ounces of the incapacitating agent BZ, also known as 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate. The bomblets themselves were composed of M7 canisters which held a 50/50 mixture of pyrotechnic and agent (pyromix).Trott, p. 70 Each bomblet was a thin-walled cylinder that held an M150A2 \\"all-ways\\" acting impact fuze with an M308 delay element. The M138 became armed immediately upon separating from the M43 cluster bomb and its M30 cluster adapter. When the bomblet impacted the ground it ignited the fuze, and, after a short delay, the pyromix was ignited. Tests involving the M138 The M138 was the subject of various tests, including those to determine its effectiveness and its detonability as demilitarization plans for BZ weapons ramped up during the 1980s. Tests undertaken at Pine Bluff Arsenal in 1981 showed that the M138 was a non-detonable item.Trott, p.57 Because of these test results it was determined that any demilitarization plant need not include provisions for the containment of accidental detonation of the M138. Regardless, an Army report issued on the results of the testing emphasized that extreme care must be exercised in order to prevent accidental detonation of the M138 bomblets as they were destroyed. Other testing of the M138 was carried out by the U.S. Army's Deseret Test Center under the auspices of Project 112.\\"Project 112/SHAD Fact Sheets \\", Force Health Protection & Readiness Policy & Programs, The Chemical-Biological Warfare Exposures Site, accessed December 11, 2008. These tests, known collectively as \\"Tall Timber\\" were carried out from April through June 1966 at the Waiakea Forest Reserve near Hilo, Hawaii. The purpose of the Tall Timber tests was to determine the effectiveness of BZ-filled M138 bomblets in a tropical forest environment.

The movement, which began in the early 2000s, has organized demonstrations, sought reform via the legal system and media, defended victims of human rights abuses, and written appeal letters, despite opposition from Communist Party authorities. Among the issues adopted by Weiquan lawyers are property and housing rights, protection for AIDS victims, environmental damage, religious freedom, freedom of speech and the press, and defending the rights of other lawyers facing disbarment or imprisonment. Individuals involved in the Weiquan movement have met with occasionally harsh reprisals from Chinese officials, including disbarment, detention, harassment, and, in extreme instances, torture. Authorities have also responded to the movement with the launch of an education campaign on the \\"socialist concept of rule of law,\\" which reasserts the role of the Communist Party and the primacy of political considerations in the legal profession, and with the Three Supremes, which entrenches the supremacy of the Communist Party in the judicial process. Background Since the legal reforms of the late 1970s and 1980s, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has moved to embrace the language of the rule of law and establish a modern court system. In the process, it has enacted thousands of new laws and regulations, and begun training more legal professionals. The concept of \\"rule of law\\" was enshrined in the constitution, and the CCP embarked on campaigns to publicize the idea that citizens have protection under the law. At the same time, however, a fundamental contradiction exists in the implementation of rule of law wherein the CCP insists that its authority supersedes that of the law; the constitution enshrines rule of law, but also emphasizes the principle of the \\"leadership of the Communist Party.\\" The judiciary is not independent, and is therefore subject to politicization and control by the Communist Party. This has produced a system that is often described as \\"rule by law,\\" rather than rule of law. Because judicial decisions are subject to the sometimes arbitrary assessments of the CCP, citizens who attempt to make use of the legal system to pursue grievances find that, if their cause is determined to have the potential to undermine the authority of the Communist Party, they may be suppressed.Cai Yongshun, \\"Collective Resistance in China: Why Popular Protests Succeed or Fail\\" (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2010) Defendants who find themselves facing criminal charges, such as for conducting activism or for their religious beliefs, often have few means of pursuing an effective defense. The Weiquan movement coalesced in the early 2000s in response to these inherent contradictions and the arbitrary exercise of legal authority in China, though its roots could be traced to the consumer protection movement that began in the 1990s. The movement is informal, and can be understood as including lawyers and legal activists who advocate for civil rights and defend the interests of citizens against corporations, government or Communist Party organs. Fu Hualing and Richard Cullen note that Weiquan lawyers \\"are generally always on the side of the weaker party: (migrant) workers v. employers in labor disputes; peasants in cases involving taxation, persons contesting environmental pollution, land appropriation, and village committee elections; journalists facing government censorship; defendants subject to criminal prosecution; and ordinary citizens who are discriminated against by government policies and actions.\\" The emergence of the Weiquan movement was made possible by a confluence of factors, including a market for their services, and an emerging rights consciousness. It was also facilitated by the 1996 \\"Lawyers Law,\\" which changed the definition of lawyers from \\"state legal workers\\" to professionals holding a legal certificate who perform legal services. The law effectively delinked lawyers from the state, and gave lawyers greater (though still limited) autonomy within the profession.Elizabeth Lynch, Rule of Law Mirage, George Washington International Law Review, 26 April 2011. Weiquan lawyers tend to be especially critical of the lack of judicial independence in China. Rather than challenging particular laws, they frame their work as being in keeping with Chinese laws, and describe their activities as a means of defending and upholding the Constitution against abuses. As such, Weiquan lawyering has been described as a form of Rightful resistance. Weiquan lawyers Weiquan Lawyers (), or \\"rights protection\\" lawyers, refer to a small but influential movement of lawyers, legal practitioners, scholars and activists who help Chinese citizens to assert their constitutional, civil rights and/or public interest through litigation and legal activism. In the context of a rising number of lawyers in China, the proportion of Weiquan lawyers is very small.Teng Biao, 'Chinese Human Rights Lawyers Under Assault', The Washington Post, 25 July 2009. Weiquan Lawyers face considerable personal, financial and professional risks. Notable Weiquan Lawyers include He Weifang, Xu Zhiyong, Teng Biao, Guo Feixiong and Chen Guangcheng, Gao Zhisheng, Zheng Enchong, and Li Heping. Many barefoot lawyers are peasants who teach themselves enough law to file civil complaints, engage in litigation, and educate fellow citizens about their rights. Some Weiquan lawyers are the pragmatists and some are more radical. Major fields =Freedom of expression= Although freedom of speech is enshrined in Article 35 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, Chinese authorities enforce restrictions on political and religious expression.Congressional Executive Commission on China, 'Human rights and rule of law in China' Such restrictions are sometimes in accordance with Article 105 of the criminal code, which contains vague and broadly defined provisions against \\"inciting subversion of state power\\". Weiquan lawyers, along with international human rights organizations, have argued that the provisions against subversion are inconsistent both with China's own constitution and with international human rights standards, particularly in light of the lack of transparency and clear guidelines used in applying the laws. Several Weiquan lawyers have been involved in litigation and other forms of advocacy to defend the rights to free expression for individuals charged with the crime of subversion. Notable cases include that of Liu Xiaobo, a prominent Beijing intellectual sentenced to 11 years in prison for inciting subversion in December 2009. Chengdu activist Tan Zuoren was sentenced to five years for inciting subversion for publishing writings on the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, advocating for the families of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake victims, and accepting interviews from the Falun Gong-affiliated Sound of Hope radio. His lawyers were reportedly barred from entering the courtroom. In October 2009, intellectual Guo Quan was sentenced to 10 years in prison for publishing \\"reactionary\\" articles online. Weiquan lawyers have also challenged the application of state secret laws, which are sometimes used to prosecute individuals who disseminate information on politically sensitive issues. In November 2009, for instance, lawyers were involved in arguing for Huang Qi, a Sichuan activist who had advocated online for the parents of Sichuan earthquake victims. Huang was sentenced to three years in prison for possession of state secrets. =Judicial independence= The Chinese Constitution enshrines rule of law, but simultaneously emphasizes the principle of the \\"leadership of the Communist Party.\\" The legal profession itself is subordinate to the authority of the Communist Party; the Ministry of Justice, not the bar associations, is responsible for issuing and renewing lawyers' licenses. Weiquan lawyers have argued that this structure precludes the emergence of genuine rule of law, and in some cases have advocated for reforms to advance judicial independence and the protection of legal professionals. In late August 2008, a collection of several dozen Beijing lawyers signed a petition stating that the Beijing Bar Association leaders should be elected by the organization's members, rather than being appointed. The petition letter stated that selection process in place for the Association's directors is inconsistent with official guidelines and the Chinese constitution, and should be replaced with a democratic voting process. The Beijing Bar Association responded to the campaign by asserting that \\"Any individual who uses text messages, the web or other media to privately promote and disseminate the concept of direct elections, express controversial opinions, thereby spreading rumors within the Beijing Bar Association, confuse and poison people's minds, and convince people of circumstances that do not exist regarding the so-called 'Call For Direct Elections For the Beijing Bar Association' is illegal.\\" The following year, the Beijing Bureau of Justice refused to renew the licenses of 53 Beijing Weiquan lawyers, all of whom had signed the petition for elections to the Bar Association. =Land rights= The practice of land requisitions and forced evictions is widespread in China as local governments make way for private real estate developers. Under Chinese property law, there is no privately held land; \\"urban land\\" is owned by the state, which grants land rights for a set number of years. Rural, or \\"collectively owned land,\\" is leased by the state for periods of 30 years, and is theoretically reserved for agricultural purposes, housing and services for farmers. Forced evictions are forbidden under International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which China has ratified. Under China's constitution and other property laws, expropriation of urban land is permitted only if it is for the purpose of supporting the \\"public interest,\\" and those being evicted are supposed to receive compensation, resettlement, and protection of one's living conditions. The \\"public interest\\" is not defined, however, and abuses are common in the expropriation process, with many citizens complaining of receiving little or no compensation.Congressional Executive Commission on China, 2010 Annual Report. 10 October 2010, pp 41‚Äì42 Forced evictions with little or no compensation occur frequently in both urban and rural China, with even fewer legal protections for rural citizens. Collectively owned rural land may be \\"reallocated\\" at the discretion of authorities, and in many regions local governments collude with private developers to reclassify rural land as urban land, which can then be sold. from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s, an estimated 40 million Chinese peasants were affected by land requisitions. Citizens who resist or protest the evictions have reportedly been subjected to harassment, beatings, or detention, and land-related grievances occasionally escalate into large-scale protests or riots.The Economist, ‚ÄúProtest in China: The Cauldron Boils‚Äù, 29 September 2005. Several Weiquan lawyers have advocated for the rights of individual citizens whose land and homes were taken with inadequate compensation, including Shanghai lawyer Zheng Enchong. Ni Yulan, a Beijing lawyer, was herself left homeless by forced eviction, and became an outspoken advocate for victims before being sentenced to two years in prison. In 2007, a 54-year-old farmer in Heilongjiang Yang Chunlin published numerous articles on human rights and land rights, and helped to organise a petition entitled: \\"We want human rights, not the Olympics.\\" The petition reportedly collected over ten thousand signatures. Yang was put to trial, and sentenced to five years in prison, where he has allegedly been tortured. Li Fangping was hired to defend him, but was denied access to his client. =Defense of ethnic minorities= Several Weiquan lawyers, including Teng Biao, Jiang Tianyong, and Li Fangping, offered legal aid to Tibetans in the wake of the March 2008 Tibetan protests. The protests resulted in the imprisonment of at least 670 Tibetans, and the execution of at least four individuals. Chinese government sources asserted that the unrest and violence in Tibet had been masterminded by the Dalai Lama and executed by his followers for the purpose of fomenting unrest and disrupting the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The Open Constitution Initiative (OCI), operated by several Weiquan lawyers and intellectuals, issued a paper in May 2009 challenging the official narrative, and suggesting that the protests were instead a response to economic inequities, Han Chinese migration, and religious sentiments. The OCI recommended that Chinese authorities better respect and protect the rights and interests of the Tibetan people, including religious freedom, and pursue the reduction of economic inequality and official corruption. Tibetan Filmmaker Dhondup Wangcheng was sentenced to six years in prison for making a documentary on human rights in Tibet in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics. Two lawyers who sought to represent him, Chang Boyang and Li Dunyong, faced threats and harassment for their advocacy. In July 2010, a group of Chinese activists including Teng Biao co-signed a letter to the Chinese leadership to protest the 15-year prison sentence that had been meted out to Uighur journalist Halaite Niyaze. Niyaze was not permitted to have a lawyer at his trial, where he was charged with \\"endangering state security.\\" According to reports, Niyaze was being charged because he had criticized the Chinese government in an interview with a Hong Kong news agency for not doing enough to prevent the July 2009 √úr√ºmqi riots. =Falun Gong= Falun Gong practitioners demonstrate outside the Zhongnanhai compound in April 1999 to demand official recognition. The practice was banned three months later. Falun Gong, a spiritual qigong discipline that once claimed tens of million adherents in China, was banned in July 1999 under the leadership of the Communist Party, and a campaign was launched to suppress the group. In an attempt to have Falun Gong adherents renounce their belief in the practice, they are subject to state-sanctioned, systematic violence in custody, sometimes resulting in death. Some sources indicate hundreds of thousands may have been detained in reeducation-through-labor camps for practicing Falun Gong and/or resisting persecution. In November 1999, the Supreme People's Court offered a judicial interpretation of article 300 of the criminal code, stating that Falun Gong should be regarded as a \\"xie jiao,\\" or cult. Large numbers were subsequently sentenced to long prison terms, often under article 300, in what are typically very short trials without the presence of a lawyer.Congressional Executive Commission on China, ' Annual Report 2010, 10 October 2010. Human rights groups, including Amnesty International, note that the application of the law to persecute Falun Gong adherents contravenes both China's own constitution and international standards. Several Weiquan lawyers have argued similarly while defending Falun Gong adherents who face criminal or administrative sentencing for their beliefs. Lawyers who have defended Falun Gong include Guo Guoting, Zhang Kai and Li Chunfu, Wang Yonghang,Tang Jitian and Liu Wei, among others. In addition to litigation work, Weiquan lawyers like Gao Zhisheng have also advocated publicly and in the media for human rights for Falun Gong. In 2004 and 2005, Gao wrote a series of letters to China's top leadership detailing accounts of torture and sexual abuse against Falun Gong practitioners, and calling for an end to the persecution of the group. In response, Gao lost his legal license, was put under house arrest, detained, and was reportedly tortured. =HIV/AIDS= Some Weiquan lawyers have advocated for the rights of HIV/AIDS victims who contracted the virus as a result of state-sponsored blood drives. In the 1990s, government officials in central China, and especially in Henan, encouraged rural citizens to sell blood plasma in order to supplement their incomes. Gross mismanagement of the process resulted in hundreds of thousands of individuals being infected with HIV. According to activists, victims have not been compensated, and no government officials were held accountable. Authorities continue to suppress information about the epidemic, which is particularly sensitive in light of the involvement of Li Changchun, the Communist Party Propaganda head and formerly Party chief in Henan. Hu Jia is arguably the most well known advocate for HIV/AIDS victims, having served as the executive director of the Beijing Aizhixing Institute of Health Education and as one of the founders of the non-governmental organization Loving Source.Amnesty International, 'Hu Jia jailed for three and a half years, 4 April 2008. =Women's rights= Chen Guangcheng, a blind self-taught Weiquan lawyer, rose to prominence for defending victims of China's one-child policy. First implemented in 1979, the one-child policy mandates that couples may only have one child, though there are exceptions for some rural citizens, ethnic minorities, and couples who were themselves only children.Laura Fitzpatrick, 'A Brief History of China's One-Child Policy', Time, 27 July 2009. Though Chinese laws condemn harsh enforcement measures, Chinese authorities and family planning staff have been accused of carrying out coercive, late-term forced abortions, sterilization, incarceration and torture to enforce the policy.Amnesty International, 'Thousands at risk of forced sterilization in China', 22 April 2010.Simon Elegant, 'Why Forced Abortions Persist in China', Time, 30 April 2007. In 2005, Chen Guangcheng filed a class action case against family planning officials in Linyi, Shandong, who were accused of subjecting thousands of women to sterilization or forced abortions. =Underground Christians= China's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, yet also provides a caveat specifying that only \\"normal\\" religious activities are permitted. In practice, religious freedom is granted only within the strictly prescribed parameters of the five officially sanctioned \\"patriotic\\" religious associations of Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Protestantism and Catholicism. Groups falling outside the state-administered religions, including \\"underground\\" or \\"house church\\" Christians, are subject to varying degrees of repression and persecution.U.S. Department of State, July‚ÄìDecember, 2010 International Religious Freedom Report: China (Includes Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau), 13 September 2011. Although there are no definitive figures on the number of underground Christians in China, some estimates have put their total number in excess of 70 million. At least 40 Catholic bishops operate independently of official sanction, and some are under surveillance, house arrest, detention, or have disappeared. Several leaders and members of underground Protestant churches have also been detained and sentenced to reeducation through labor or prison terms. Violent raids and demolitions have been carried out on underground churches, sometimes resulting in injury to congregants inside. Chinese officials have labelled several underground Protestant churches as a xie jiao (translated literally as \\"evil religion\\"), or cult, thus providing a pretext for harsher punishment of members. Several prominent Weiquan lawyers themselves identify with the underground Protestant movement, and have sought to defend church members and leaders facing imprisonment. These include Zhang Kai, Li Heping, and Gao Zhisheng. Former house church leader Bob Fu's US-based organization \\"ChinaAid\\" has sponsored legal cases, and provided \\"rule-of-law training\\" and legal help for distressed clients in China. =Other initiatives= A number of specific events have attracted the help and attention of Weiquan activists. In the March 2008 earthquake in Sichuan province, shoddy school construction resulted in the collapse of several schools full of students. A number of Weiquan lawyers, including Tan Zuoren, were involved in advocating for the rights of parents, and in investigating allegations that corrupt officials were responsible for the poor construction. Parents and lawyers met with reprisals from Chinese officials for their activism. Later the same year, it was revealed that large quantities of infant formula had been tainted with melamine, causing 300,000 infants to fall ill and resulting in several deaths. A group of parents of the victims were reportedly detained for attempting to draw media attention to their plight. Dozens of lawyers‚Äîparticularly from the provinces of Hebei, Henan and Shandong‚Äîoffered pro-bono legal services to victims, but their efforts were obstructed by authorities.Radio Free Asia, 'Lawyers‚Äô Outrage at Milk Case Ban', 7 October 2008. Individual human rights cases, such as the Deng Yujiao incident and the death of Qian Yunhui, have also drawn help from rights defenders such as Wu Gan. In 2003, a group of legal scholars, including Teng Biao and Xu Zhiyong, formed the Open Constitution Initiative () to advocate for greater rule of law. The organization was involved in the Sun Zhigang case, and has advocated for petitioners, labor rights, freedom of expression, HIV/AIDS victims, Tibetans, land rights, and protection of public health, among other issues.The Economist, 'Open Constitution Closed', 23 June 2009. Government response =Retrenchment on rule of law= In response to the emergence of the Weiquan movement, which often makes use of the official language about \\"rule of law\\" to justify its work, in April 2006 a political campaign was launched to solidify the Communist Party's leadership over judicial work, combat the idea of greater independence for judges and lawyers, and educate people and judicial authorities about the \\"socialist concept of rule of law.\\" The campaign was announced by Luo Gan, then the head of the Party Central Committee's Political and Legislative Affairs Committee. Luo urged that in order to protect political stability, \\"forceful measures\\" be adopted \\"against those who, under the pretext of rights-protection (weiquan), carry out sabotage.\\"Donald C. Clarke, \\"China's Legal System: New Developments, New Challenges,\\" Cambridge University Press, (Cambridge, UK: The China Quarterly, 2008). The launch of the campaign coincided with a crackdown on Weiquan lawyers. Shortly after the campaign's launch, Party Committees provided instruction to judges reminding them of the political goals that their work must uphold. According to one document issued to judges in Zhejiang and quoted by Human Rights Watch, \\"Recently, some judges have started to believe that to be a judge you just have to strictly apply the law in a case. In fact, this kind of concept is erroneous [...] all the legal formulations have a clear political background and direction [...] We must stamp out the kind of narrow viewpoint that thinks that you can also do court work by having judicial independence.\\" During a December 2007 conference on political-legal work, CCP general secretary Hu Jintao articulated the theory of the \\"Three Supremes,\\" which emphasized again that legal work should regard as supreme the concerns and interests of the Communist Party. In March 2008, Wang Shengjun was confirmed as the new head of the Supreme People's Court. Wang, who has no formal legal training himself, abandoned the efforts of his predecessors to improve judicial competence, training, and autonomy, and instead placed primary importance on the ideological implications of the \\"Three Supremes\\" theory and upholding the leadership of the Communist Party. In 2010, China's Ministry of Justice issued two new regulations intended to \\"strengthen the supervision and management of lawyers and law firms\\". According to the Associated Press, the new regulations would serve to \\"allow authorities to punish lawyers ... for actions such as talking to the media or even causing 'traffic troubles.'\\" In March 2012, China's Ministry of Justice issued a new directive requiring lawyers first obtaining their license or renewing an existing license to swear an oath of loyalty to the Communist Party. According to the Ministry's website, a section of oath includes the following: ‚ÄúI swear to faithfully fulfill the sacred mission of legal workers in socialism with Chinese characteristics. I swear my loyalty to the motherland, to the people, to uphold the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system, and to protect the dignity of the Constitution and laws.\\" =Suppression of lawyers and coercive measures= Weiquan lawyers have faced various challenges to their work from the Chinese government, including disbarment or suspension, violence, threats, surveillance, arbitrary detention, and prosecution. This is particularly true for lawyers who take up politically sensitive cases. Reports of harassment, intimidation, and violence against Weiquan lawyers increased in 2006 following the launch of the campaign to promote the \\"socialist concept of the rule of law.\\" Authorities have refused to renew the licenses of several dozen Weiquan lawyers, and several have effectively been banned for life from the legal profession. In 2009, for instance, at least 17 Weiquan lawyers were not permitted to renew their legal licenses after taking on politically sensitive cases.Human Rights in China, Chinese Rights Defense Lawyers Under All-out Attack by the Authorities, 4 June 2009. Several Weiquan lawyers have themselves been sentenced to prison in response to their activism. A selection of notable instances of suppression are listed here: * Gao Zhisheng, once recognized as one of China's ten most promising lawyers, was an advocate for a range of disenfranchised individuals and minorities. In 2006, after he wrote a series of letters to the Chinese leadership concerning the torture of Falun Gong adherents, Gao had his legal license revoked and his law firm was shut down. His family was placed under house arrest, and he was detained for six months. Gao was sentenced, with a five-year reprieve, to four years in prison. He has been the subject of several prolonged disappearances into custody, during which he has reportedly been tortured. * On 27 December 2007, AIDS and pro-democracy activist Hu Jia was detained as part of a crackdown on dissents during the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. A well known rights advocate who had advocated on behalf of AIDS victims, peasants, victims of land requisitions, Hu had also been critical of the lack of human rights progress that had been made ahead of the Olympic games.Jim Yardley, 'China formally arrests detained activist Hu Jia', The New York Times, 1 February 2008. Hu pleaded not guilty at his trial in March 2008. On 3 April 2008, he was sentenced to 3.5 years in prison for \\"inciting subversion of state power.\\" He had previously been under house arrest, and has reportedly been beaten by police. * In response to his work to bring a class action lawsuit against family planning authorities in Linyi, Shandong Province in 2005, Chen Guangcheng was put under house arrest, threatened, detained, and beaten. Three other Weiquan activists ‚Äì Li Fangping, Li Subin, and Xu Zhiyong‚Äî visited him to offer support, but were themselves beaten and interrogated. On 24 August 2006, he was sentenced to four years and three months in prison for \\"damaging property and gathering crowds to disturb transport order.\\" Following his release, he remains under house arrest. * On 22 April 2010, Beijing lawyers Liu Wei and Tang Jitian were permanently disbarred for defending Falun Gong practitioners. * On 13 May 2009, lawyers Zhang Kai and Li Chunfu are violently beaten and detained in Chongqing for investigating the death of Jiang Xiqing, a 66-year-old Falun Gong practitioner killed in a labor camp. One month earlier, Beijing lawyer Cheng Hai was similarly beaten by police in Sichuan province for seeking to defend a Falun Gong adherent. * Yang Chunlin was arrested in July 2007 and charged with \\"inciting subversion of state power\\". His trial began in February 2008 in the city of Jiamusi. Yang was sentenced to five years in prison on 24 March 2008.\\"'Olympic Protester' Yang Chunlin sentenced to five years in prison\\", Chinese Human Rights Defenders, 24 March 2008. He maintained his innocence throughout the trial. During and after the hearing at which he was sentenced, Yang was reportedly beaten with an electric rod on at least two occasions. * On 4 July 2009, around 20 security agents broke into the home of Wang Yonghang. Wang, a Weiquan lawyer from Dalian City, had defended Falun Gong adherents. He was taken into custody for interrogation and was reportedly beaten severely. Wang's lawyers were not permitted to contact him. In November 2009, Wang was sentenced in a closed court to seven years in prison for his advocacy on behalf of Falun Gong practitioners. When his lawyers were permitted to see him in January 2010, they reported that he had been tortured. * On 17 July 2009, authorities in Beijing raided and shuttered the Open Constitution Initiative, an NGO established by legal scholars Teng Biao and Xu Zhiyong. * On 20 February 2011, several Weiquan activists were detained following online calls for pro-democracy protests in China, including Chen Wei, Jiang Tianyong, Tang Jitian, and Teng Biao. * In May 2014, as multiple Chinese activists began preparing for the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, a number of lawyers were arrested for planning or being suspected of planning demonstrations. Among those arrested was Pu Zhiqiang, a lawyer who was involved in organising the demonstrations in 1989.Jonathan Kaiman, China cracks down on dissent ahead of Tiananmen anniversary, The Guardian, 13 May 2014. International response Although there is relatively little awareness of the Weiquan phenomenon as a movement outside of China, Western governments and human rights organizations have consistently expressed concern over the treatment of individual Weiquan lawyers in China, some of whom have faced disbarment, imprisonment, prolonged disappearance, sentencing and alleged torture for their work in promoting civil rights and speaking out against one-party rule. In October 2010, a bipartisan group of 29 members of the U.S. House of Representatives pressed President Obama to raise the cases of Liu Xiaobo and Gao Zhisheng with the Chinese leadership, writing of Gao Zhizheng's prolonged detention: \\"If lawyers are hauled away for the \\"crime\\" of defending their clients, then even the pretense of rule of law in China has failed.\\" The U.S. State Department claims to have raised the cases of these two individuals with their Chinese counterparts. In 2008, Hu Jia was awarded the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament recognizing his human rights advocacy. The same year, Hu and Gao Zhisheng received nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize, and were considered to be favorites for the award. Two years later, seven members of the U.S. House of Representatives nominated imprisoned lawyers Gao Zhisheng and Chen Guangcheng, along with fellow dissident Liu Xiaobo for the prize. The letter noted that these individuals have sought to \\"raise the Chinese people's awareness of their dignity and rights, and to call their government to govern within its constitution, its laws, and the international human rights agreements it has signed,\\" and thereby made a significant contribution to peace. The Nobel Prize Committee awarded the honor to Liu in absentia in December 2010.

The treaty was signed in September 1926 and was described as a friendship treaty. At the time, Italy was ruled by the fascist National Fascist Party with Benito Mussolini as head of government. The treaty recognized Imam Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din as King of Yemen and acknowledged his claims to Aden. The treaty was renewed on October 15, 1937, after Italy had annexed Abyssinia (present-day Ethiopia). Background The Red Sea was of strategic importance to the United Kingdom due to both trade and as a route for its navy to pass through in order to reach India among other places. South of Yemen was the British Colony of Aden and Aden Protectorate which were at considerable risk of anti-colonialist rebellions. Italy had colonies of its own in the region: Eritrea and Somaliland, both of low profitability. There was expectation that increased ties with Yemen would fuel increased trade with the colonies and bring the region into the Italian sphere of influence. The Kingdom of Yemen at this point had its eye on annexing Aden and Imam Yahya also had aspirations for a Greater Yemen.

It belongs to the hunt game family. The board is a 4x4 square grid, where pieces are placed on the intersection points and move along the lines. It is one of the smallest hunt games. Three tigers are going up against eleven buffaloes. The tigers attempt to capture as many of the buffaloes by the short leap as in draughts or Alquerque. The buffaloes attempt to hem in the tigers. The game most resembles tiger hunt games (or tiger games) and perhaps can be classified as one. Examples of tiger games are Bagh- Chal, Rimau-rimau, and Catch the Hare. Tiger games usually consist of a standard Alquerque board which is a 5 x 5 square grid with several diagonal lines. Tiger and buffaloes consist of only a 4 x 4 square grid with no diagonal lines. It therefore most resembles hunt games such as Khla si ko, Len c√∫a k√≠n ngoa, and Sua Ghin Gnua. The game was described by Milo≈° Zapletal in his 1986 book Velk√° encyklopedie her; II. Hry v klubovnƒõ which when translated from Czech is Great Encyclopedia of games; II. Games in the clubhouse. Another name for the game is Tiger game.  Setup  A 4x4 square grid is used, and this creates 16 intersection points (here-in-forth referred to as \\"points\\"). There are 3 tiger pieces and 11 buffalo pieces with each set of pieces distinguishable from the other by color or design. Players decide who will play the Tigers, and who will play the Buffaloes. The board is empty in the beginning with each player's pieces set beside it.  Rules  * Players alternate their turns throughout the game. * The first stage of the game is the Drop phase. The Buffaloes move first. Four buffaloes are placed on any vacant points on the board. Then the Tiger player places one tiger on any vacant point. Then the Buffalo player places four more of its pieces on any vacant points. Then the Tiger player places another tiger piece onto any vacant point. Then the Buffalo player places its last three buffaloes on any vacant point. Lastly, the Tiger player places its last tiger onto any vacant point. * The next stage is the Movement phase. The Buffaloes move first. Both tigers and buffaloes can move along a line onto a vacant adjacent point. There are only orthogonal lines on the board, and therefore all moves are orthogonal (right, left, forward, backward). However, the tiger instead can capture an adjacent buffalo. The tiger leaps over the adjacent buffalo, and lands on a vacant point immediately beyond. The leap must be in a straight line, and follow the pattern on the board. The captured buffalo is removed from the board. It is uncertain if multiple leaps and captures are allowed. It is also uncertain if captures are compulsory, but in all other hunt games, captures are never compulsory. * The tigers win if they capture enough buffaloes such that the buffaloes can no longer effectively block their movements. * The buffaloes win if they block the movements of the tigers (i.e., the tigers cannot perform a legal move or capture).  Khla si ko  Khla si ko is a Cambodian variant of Myanmar's Tiger and Buffaloes and of Thailand's Len c√∫a k√≠n ngoa. Khla si ko when translated from Khmer to English means tigers and cows, or tigers and bulls. The game is also sometimes spelled as Kla si ko or Khlaa syi kau. Khlaa syi kau may also mean tiger eats cow. The game also uses a 4 x 4 board as in Tiger and buffaloes, but Tiger and buffaloes uses a 4 x 4 square grid where pieces are played on the gridded lines and intersection points. Khla si ko uses a 4 x 4 square board where the pieces are played within the squares. There are also 4 tigers and 12 cows in Khla si ko which is a contrast to the 3 tigers and 11 buffaloes of Tiger and buffaloes. There are a few other differences also. But both Khla si ko and Tiger and buffaloes have only orthogonal movement of pieces, and only move one space at a time. Tigers in both games capture by the short leap as in draughts and Alquerque, and only in orthogonal directions. Diagonal movements or captures are not allowed in both games. A game called Dragons and Swans is played exactly the same way with the same board and number of pieces. Khla si ko is a hunt game, and may be considered a tiger hunt game, or in short tiger game, since one side is represented by tigers. Usually tiger games consist of an Alquerque board which is a 5 x 5 square grid with several diagonal lines, and pieces are played on the intersection points and move along the lines. These features are missing in Khla si ko. = Setup = The board is a 4 x 4 square consisting of 16 squares. There are 4 tiger pieces and 12 cow pieces with each set of pieces distinguishable from the other by color or design. Players decide which animal to play. The game begins with the 4 tigers situated on the four corner squares of the board with the rest of the board empty. The 12 cows are set beside the board awaiting to be placed on the board. = Rules = * Players alternate their turns throughout the game. * Cows have the first turn, and one cow may be place onto any vacant square on the board. All 12 cows will be entered on the board one cow in a turn before any of them can be moved on the board. * The tigers on their turn may move orthogonally (up, down, right, or left) to a vacant adjacent square. Alternatively, a tiger may capture a cow if one is available for capture. The tiger must leap (in a straight line) over an orthogonally adjacent cow, and land on an empty square immediately beyond. The leapt cow is captured, and removed from the board. A tiger may only move or capture exclusively in a turn, it cannot do both, and only one tiger may be used in a turn. Multiple captures in a turn are not allowed. * As with the tigers, cows move only orthogonally one space onto a vacant adjacent square. However, cows are not allowed to capture or leap over any tigers or fellow cows. Only one cow may be moved in a turn. * Tigers are not allowed to leap over or capture fellow tigers. * If the tigers eat all the cows, the tigers wins. If the tigers block the movements of the cows preventing the cows from moving, then this is also deemed a win for the tigers. * If the cows block the movements of the 4 tigers, then the cows win.  Len c√∫a k√≠n ngoa  Len c√∫a k√≠n ngoa or The game of \\"tigers eating cattle\\" is a game from Thailand (formerly Siam). It was observed and documented by Captain James Low in Asiatic Researches (1839). The game resembles Khla si ko and Tiger and Buffaloes in that it is a hunt game that uses a 4 x 4 board. It especially resembles Khla si ko in that the 4 x 4 board is specifically a 4 x 4 square board where game pieces are placed within the squares; moreover, there are 4 tigers versus 12 oxen, and that the opening setup has the tigers on the four corners squares of the board. There are however some features that make this game possibly unique which will be described in the Rules section. The following setup and rules are based upon Low's description, however many parts of his description were vague. = Setup = The board is a 4 x 4 square consisting of 16 squares. There are 4 tiger pieces and 12 oxen pieces with each set of pieces distinguishable from the other by color or design. Players decide which animal to play. The game begins with the 4 tigers situated on the four corner squares of the board with the rest of the board empty. The 12 oxen are set beside the board awaiting to be placed on the board. = Rules = * Players alternate their turns throughout the game. * Oxen have the first turn, and one ox may be place onto any vacant square on the board. Captain James Low does not describe how the remaining 11 oxen are specifically entered on the board, but it might be assumed that all 12 oxen are entered on the board one ox per turn as in Khla si ko especially since only one ox was placed on the first turn suggesting that oxen are entered one per turn. In most hunt games only one piece may be dropped or moved in a turn. Low also does not describe when the oxen can move, but in Khla si ko, an ox may only move on the board after all 12 of them have been dropped. * The nearest tiger to the first oxen dropped on the board is the first tiger to move, but Low does not describe how tigers can move, that is, whether or not they can move orthogonally or diagonally, and whether their movements are limited to an adjacent vacant square, or if they can move any number of unoccupied squares. * Low describes that a tiger may capture an ox by the short leap if the ox is orthogonally adjacent to the tiger, and there is an empty square immediately beyond. Low explicitly rules out diagonal captures. * Low does not describe if oxen move only orthogonally or diagonally, or whether they are limited to moving only to an adjacent vacant square, or whether they can move any number of unoccupied squares. Low does not rule out whether or not oxen can capture using the short leap, but since he doesn't describe it, it is unlikely. In most hunt games, the side with the greater number of pieces usually can not capture by the short leap. * Low does describe that the tigers can be captured if they are hemmed in by the oxen. He writes \\"The tigers are taken and put off the board when hemmed in so that they cannot move, or they are taken then by the oxen moving (only then) diagonally. If only two tigers are left on the board the oxen are victors.\\" This statement suggest that each tiger (or group of tigers) when hemmed in by the oxen is captured and removed from the board, thus allowing the tigers to be reduced to two (or less) delivering the victory for the oxen. Hemming in a single tiger or a group of tigers and capturing them is a form of custodian capture that's found in other games but is highly uncommon in hunt games.Len c√∫a k√≠n ngoa's custodian capture method resembles that of Rek and Watermelon Chess. The phrase that tigers \\"are taken then by the oxen moving (only then) diagonally\\" is vague. If we assume that the oxen can only move orthogonally as in Khla si ko, then it appears strange or contradictory that they can move diagonally only when attempting to capture the tigers. But if that is not Low's intent, then perhaps he is suggesting that the oxen can only move diagonally and not orthogonally, and it's only now that he's taking the time to describe the exclusive diagonal movements of the oxen. Another possibility is that the oxen may move orthogonally or diagonally, but only hem in and capture the tigers when moving diagonally.

Spigel was a key member of the influential Expressionist group Jung Idysz. He exhibited his works throughout Europe until his internment in Radomsko ghetto in 1939. Natan was murdered in Treblinka in 1942, and only about 20 of his works survived the Shoah-Holocaust. Life and artistic career Natan Spigel was born into an Orthodox Jewish family in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, now in Poland, in 1892. ( see autobiographic letter to Prof.Otto Schneid ). The remnants of his family are now based in London. He studied art as a young man and then in 1910 traveled to Rome on sponsorship, where he continued his studies with Henryk Glicenstein. His first major success, in Paris, was the invitation to show in the 1924 Salon d'Automne, although his first public exhibition was in Lodz in 1921. He was invited to exhibit in London at the Ben Uri Gallery in 1930 and also, at a joint exhibition with Jacob Epstein. In Poland Natan Spigel was regularly exhibiting his work, with shows in Lodz, Cracow and Warsaw (1921, 1928 & 1937). Spigel considered himself a Jewish painter, and his painting reflected this focus, depicting scenes of Jewish life in Poland, as well as portraits and still-life, in both watercolours and oils. A particularly distinctive feature of some of his watercolours was his use of varnish to give age and contrast. Spigel was a key member of the Expressionist group Jung Idysz. He was also a member of ‚ÄòStart‚Äô, a group of mainly Jewish, Lodz artists, who exhibited across Poland throughout the 1920s and '30s. By the 1930s, his work was in collections in Poland, London, and Israel. Shortly after the German invasion of Poland, in 1939, Natan Spigel, together with his family, was interned in the Radomsko ghetto. He continued to paint during this time. He perished in the Treblinka extermination camp in 1942. Today Natan Spigel‚Äôs work can be seen in public collections in Tel Aviv, London, Lublin, and Ein Harod. Only about 20 of his paintings are definitely known to have survived.
