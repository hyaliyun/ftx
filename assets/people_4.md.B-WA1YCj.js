He was director of the Military Intelligence Directorate (1979-1983) a Knesset member for Likud (1988-1992) and mayor of the coastal city of Bat Yam. Biography Yehoshua Sagi was born in Jerusalem during the Mandate era He attended a local high school and later earned a B.A. in history and international relations from Tel Aviv University. Military career Sagi entered the Israeli Defense Forces in 1951. From 1953 to 1954, he served in the Southern Command, fulfilling field duties. During the Suez Crisis in 1956, he served as intelligence officer of the Armored Corps and as commander of a reconnaissance unit. Following the 1956 war, he served as an intelligence officer with the 7th Brigade, and later as assistant intelligence officer. From 1967 until 1970, he was an intelligence officer in the Southern Command, and during the Yom Kippur War was a divisional intelligence officer. In 1974 he became assistant to the head of research at the Military Intelligence Directorate. After serving as deputy head beginning in 1978, he rose to become head of Military Intelligence in 1979. During the leadup to the 1982 Lebanon War, Sagi was charged by Prime Minister Menachem Begin with obtaining some form of American approval for an Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon. The result was the admission by U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig that the infiltration of terrorists over any of Israel's borders constituted a violation of the July 1981 ceasefire, but not terrorist actions against Israeli or Jewish targets outside of the region. Saguy was asked to resign in 1983 following the recommendations of the Kahan Commission, which had determined that he was guilty of indifference during massacres at Palestinian refugee camps in Israeli-occupied Lebanon. Saguy subsequently resigned from the army.\\"Around the world; Israeli General Resigns From Army\\" The New York Times, 15 August 1983 Political career After leaving the IDF, he won a place on the Likud list for the 1988 elections, and won a seat in the Knesset.

Armenian chant, like Byzantine chant, consists mainly of hymns. The chants are grouped in a system of eight modes called oktoechos. The oldest hymns were in prose, but later versified hymns, such as those by Nerses Shnorhali, became more prominent. The official book of hymns, the sharakan, contains 1,166 hymns (≈†araknoc').

Armenian chant is now sung to a precise rhythm, including specific rhythmic patterns which are atypical of plainsong. This is considered by some scholars (such as P. Aubry) to be a result of Turkish influence, although others (such as R. P. Decevrens) consider it to be of great antiquity and use it as evidence in favor of a more rhythmic interpretation of Gregorian chant. The chants used by communities in the Armenian Diaspora are usually harmonized and differ from the original forms.

Described as a \\"20th Century Warrior\\", Yellowtail was the first Native American to hold the post of Agency Superintendent at a reservation.  Early Life & Education  Yellowtail was born in Lodge Grass, Montana in 1889.Throughout his life, Yellowtail went by three Crow names. He was referred to as B√≠awakshish, or \\"Summer,\\" then Shoop√°aheesh, or \\" Four War Deeds,\\" and finally Ax√≠chish or \\" The Wet\\", which was shared with another war chief who was in the same clan as Yellowtail. Separated from his mom at the age of 4 years old, Yellowtail was culturally assimilated into a reservation boarding school. When he was 13 years old, he went to the Sherman Institute, in Riverside, California, graduating in 1907. He then attended the Extension Law School in Los Angeles, transferring to the University of Chicago Law School, where he gained his J.D. degree.  Personal Life  Yellowtail was married four times. In 1911, he married a daughter of Spotted Horse, and after she died during the 1920's, he then married Lillian Bull Shows. His second marriage ended in divorce, and in 1932, he married his late wife, Margaret Picket. After which in 1960, he entered his fourth marriage to Dorothy Payne. He also has seven children and many grandchildren which extended his family connections far and wide.  Political Activism  In 1910, He was immediately enlisted by Crow chief Plenty Coups to defend the Crow Indian Reservation against a bill sponsored by Montana Senator Thomas J. Walsh that sought to open the reservation to homesteading. The bill was defeated after seven years of work in Washington by Yellowtail. Yellowtail's first official position was as a district representative in 1912, it was on a tribal business committee where he negotiated grazing leases, and gave the tribe a voice during land disputes. Initially, Yellowtail was in this committee to fight disputes related to Crow land, but caught the attention of other political leaders like Plenty Coup. Less than a year later he made his first trip to Washington D.C. He attended the National Indian Memorial in New York City as an interpreter for Medicine Crow, Plenty Coup and other leaders. In 1920, he helped to draft the \\"Crow Allotment Act\\" that protected Crow lands, and was instrumental in obtaining voting rights for Native Americans in 1924. In 1934, Yellowtail became the Superintendent of the Crow Indian Reservation, the first superintendent to administer his own tribe. Yellowtail held the office until 1945. During this time, Yellowtail was able to get white ranchers to return 40,000 acres of land back to the tribe, built a Crow Hospital, brought horses and cattle from Canada, and buffalo from Yellowstone National Park. Yellowtail was a leading figure in opposition to a proposed dam on the Bighorn River in the southern portion of the reservation. The dam would flood the Bighorn Canyon, sacred to the Crow. Yellowtail was unable to prevent the dam's construction, which began in 1961, but won a modest increase in compensation to the tribe after a divisive fight. In a final irony, Yellowtail Dam was named after Yellowtail. Yellowtail continued to fight for compensation for the Crow people in the 1980s, arguing against sales of coal from mineral rights held by the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the Crow reservation. Yellowtail was the subject of a 1985 video, Contrary Warriors: A Story of the Crow Tribe.

The Globe and MailNov. 21, 2016 Marsha Lederman False sexual and physical assault accusations & defamation lawsuit In November 2015, UBC announced that Galloway was suspended from his position with pay because allegations, which were not specified in the announcement, had been made against him. The Faculty Association of UBC criticized the institution for announcing the suspension, stating it was an invasion of privacy. In June 2016, Galloway was fired from the university after an investigation by Mary Ellen Boyd, a former B.C. Supreme Court justice. In announcing Galloway's termination, university spokesperson Philip Steenkamp cited \\"a record of misconduct that resulted in an irreparable breach of trust\\". The nature of the misconduct was not made public at the time. The Canadian Press spoke with five of the people who had filed complaints against Galloway, and found that complaints included alleged \\"sexual harassment, bullying, threats and an incident in which Galloway is accused of slapping a student\\". In November 2016, a large group of Canadian authors, including Margaret Atwood and Yann Martel, signed an open letter, written by Joseph Boyden, criticizing UBC for carrying out its investigation in secret and denying Galloway the right to due process. Some of the authors, including Miriam Toews and Wayne Johnston, later withdrew their names and support. The letter caused controversy in the Canadian literary community, with some accusing the signatories of taking Galloway's side over that of his accusers. In December 2016, Galloway revealed that he had had an affair with a student, for which he apologized. Galloway stated that Justice Boyd had concluded in her report that the charge of sexual assault against him could not be substantiated and that Boyd had dismissed several other allegations of misconduct against him as well.\\"Author Steve Galloway apologizes in first statement since being fired by UBC\\". Toronto Star, Laura Kane of The Canadian Press. Nov. 23, 2016 page A16. In 2018, UBC was forced to pay Galloway $167,000 for violating his privacy rights and damaging his reputation. On July 13, 2018, Galloway published an essay in the Toronto National Post asserting that he was \\"not a monster,\\" despite what he felt had been a coordinated campaign to paint him as such, and revealed that the woman who had accused him of assault was the one with whom he had had the affair. Steenkamp told a local newspaper the same day, however, that the dismissal was \\"fully justified\\" and that the sexual allegations against Galloway were not the only issues the university had considered. However, this comment was met with further sanctions when they were held up as a breach of the confidentiality agreement with additional damages awarded to Galloway. In October 2018, Galloway filed a defamation lawsuit against the woman who accused him of sexual assault, along with 20 others who had spread the allegations, in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The lawsuit was originally set for trial in June of 2020, but currently remains ongoing. Books =Finnie Walsh= Galloway's debut novel, Finnie Walsh (2000), was nominated for the Amazon.ca/Books in Canada First Novel Award. It was described as \\"a work about the love of hockey and the way two boys form a bond that carries them through life's tragedies and trials\\".Davis, Charlene. \\"Galloway, Steven.\\" The Canadian Encyclopedia. Historica Foundation, 1 Sep 2007.

Winnipeg: Mar 31, 2006. Vol. 12, Iss. 15; 1 pgs The ethnic and economic diversity of the characters had critics describing it as a \\"truly Canadian book both in content and sensibility\\". It was noted that \\"The style of Galloway's early literary influences, Farley Mowat and John Irving, is apparent\\" in this first novel. =Ascension= His second novel, Ascension (2003), was nominated for the BC Book Prizes' Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize, and has been translated into over fifteen languages. Notably different from his first novel, Ascension takes a look at the events in the life of a 66-year-old Romanian man leading up to his famous tight rope walking between the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center. \\"He expertly walks a very fine line, spinning the makings of what might have been a gimmicky immigrant tale into a gripping story of one man's lifelong balancing act.\\" =The Cellist of Sarajevo= Galloway's third novel, The Cellist of Sarajevo (2008), was nominated for the International Dublin Literary Award, longlisted for the 2008 Scotiabank Giller Prize and won the 2009 Evergreen Award, the George Ryga Award for Social Awareness in Literature and the Borders Original Voices Award. It was heralded as \\"the work of an expert\\" by The Guardian,Green, Zoe. \\"War notes.\\" The Observer. Guardian.co.uk, 29 June. 2008. and has become an international bestseller with rights sold in over 30 countries. The novel is set during the siege of Sarajevo in the mid-1990s and explores the dilemmas of ordinary people caught in the crisis. The title references the true story of Vedran Smailoviƒá, a cellist who played Albinoni's Adagio \\"dressed in evening tails and perching on a fire-scorched chair\\" every day for 22 days, \\"always at the same location\\", to \\"honour the 22 people killed by a mortar bomb while they queued for bread at 10 in the morning on May 26, 1992\\". The novel follows the lives of three fictional citizens of Sarajevo as they struggle to survive the war, including one who seeks to protect the cellist: \\"He has said he will do this for twenty-two days. This is the eighth. People see him. The world has seen him. We cannot allow him to be killed.\\" The novel examines the gentleness found in humanity and the lasting and healing power of art. Vedran Smailoviƒá did not learn of the book until after it had been published. Galloway had been advised to contact Smajloviƒá, who had purposefully embraced a quiet, private life in Warrenpoint, Northern Ireland, but did not do so. When Smailoviƒá learned of the publication, he expressed feelings of indignation and dismay, objecting to the use of his story and his personal information without permission or compensation, and pointing out differences between the story and his actual life. However, a meeting between the two took place in 2012, moving a step closer to conflict resolution. Galloway, who has been described as \\"honest and talented young man with no intentions to steal\\", claimed that Smailoviƒá's act of playing the cello as a protest was a public act, and that fiction writers were under no obligation to pay those who inspired them, and that it was unreasonable to expect that. Galloway insisted that the cellist in his story, while inspired by the photos and story of Smailoviƒá, was imaginary. Galloway sent the cellist a signed copy of the book. =The Confabulist= The Confabulist is a story told some time after 2010 by an elderly man named Martin Strauss who claims to have killed Harry Houdini.\\"Book Talk: Steven Galloway on magic, memories and Houdini\\". Chicago Tribune, June 19, 2014, By Nicholas P. Brown Mostly employing flashbacks, the novel alternates between Houdini's point of view and Strauss's point of view to describe the years leading up to their 1926 encounter in Montreal. Several aspects are historically accurate including attempts to have Houdini join espionage circles, and his efforts to champion skepticism over spiritualism. However, it gradually becomes clear that Strauss is an unreliable narrator. The Confabulist was shortlisted for The Rogers Trust Fiction Prize and received favourable reviews from Marcia Kaye of The Toronto Star and Keith Donohue of The Washington Post. In the National Post, Zoe Whittall said \\"But this is Steven Galloway we‚Äôre talking about ‚Äî a brilliant Vancouver novelist, and the author of The Cellist of Sarajevo ‚Äî and I believe that, no matter the setting or conceit, a good novelist can make anything worth your while. And Galloway is nothing if not a good novelist. I‚Äôm happy to report that The Confabulist, his fourth novel, is a stunning achievement.\\" Conversely, Jenny Hendrix of the New York Times criticized the narrative as heavy handed.

Originally established in each sheriffdom to collect tax, they later took on much of the responsibility for the local government of the counties of Scotland. In 1890 they ceded most of their duties to the county councils created by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. They were finally abolished in 1930. Creation The Parliament of Scotland passed legislation creating Commissioners of Supply for each of the shires or sheriffdoms in 1667. The act specified that the commissioners for each sheriffdom should consist partly of ex officio members: all privy councillors and senators of the College of Justice \\"within the severall respective shyres wher any part of ther lands and estates doeth ly\\", and partly of nominated members: a number of named prominent landowners in each shire.The sheriffdoms listed were Edinburgh (i.e. Midlothian), Hadingtoun (i.e. East Lothian), Berwick, Roxburgh, Selkirk, Peebles, Lanerk, Dumfreize, \\"the sherifdome of Wigtoun and stewartrie of Kirkcudbright\\", Air, Dumbartan, Bute, Renfrew, Striviling (i.e. Stirlingshire), Linlithgow (i.e. West Lothian), Perth, Kincairdine, Aberdene, Inverness and Ross, Nairne, Cromarty, Argyle, Fyfe and Kinross, Forfar (i.e. Angus), Bamf (i.e. Banff), Sutherland, Caithnes, Elgine (i.e Moray), Orkney and Zetland, Clakmannan. The commissioners had the duty of ensuring the collection of \\"cess\\" or land tax to supply the financial needs of the sovereign. A total of 72,000 pounds was to be raised monthly throughout Scotland, with each sheriffdom responsible for a set sum. This ranged from 33,183 pounds and 8 shillings in Midlothian to 352 pounds, 7 shillings and 3 pence in Clackmannanshire. The royal burghs lying within each sheriffdom were not subject to the commissioners, the cess being collected by the burgh magistrates. In 1686 the commissioners took on their first local government functions. In that year an act was passed providing that the repair of highways and bridges should be the responsibility of \\"the several shires and burghs... within their respective bounds\\". The sheriff of each shire was given the power to compel the commissioners of supply and justices of the peace to convene and agree funding and allocation of labour for road repairs. 1707-1930 The commissioners continued to exist following the passing of the Act of Union in 1707. From 1718 they became responsible, along with justices of the peace, for county roads and bridges, and in 1832 they were charged with raising \\"rogue money\\" for the keeping of the peace.Highway (Scotland) Act 1718 (1718 c. 30) and Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1832 (1832 c. 65, section 44) In many cases the commissioners appointed special constables for all or parts of their counties, and by the Police (Scotland) Act 1857 they were required to establish a county police force, in all areas outside police burghs, from 1858. In 1862, the functions and property of the Commissioners of Highland Roads and Bridges were transferred to the Commissioners of Supply.Highland Roads and Bridges Act 1862, sections 4 and 5. In 1890, as a result of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, virtually all of the powers and duties of the commissioners passed to the newly created county councils. The commissioners continued to exist, however, meeting once a year to elect a convener and to appoint members to the Joint Standing Committee that was responsible for the county constabulary. The other members of the committee were nominated by the county council, and it was chaired by the sheriff of the county. Commissioners of Supply were finally abolished in 1930 by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929.

Biography Virgilio Pi√±era was born in C√°rdenas, Matanzas Province. In 1925 he and his family moved to Camag√ºey, where he obtained his high school diploma. In 1938 he established himself in Havana, earning his doctoral degree in philosophy and letters from the University of Havana in 1940. Beginning the previous year he began to publish his poems in the literary magazine Espuela de plata (Silver Spur), the predecessor to Or√≠genes. In 1941 he wrote his first collection of poems, Las furias (The Furies), and his best known play, Electra Garrig√≥. The latter was premiered in Havana eight years later and was poorly received by the press. In 1942 Pi√±era founded and headed the magazine Poeta (Poet). The following year he published La isla en peso (The Island in Weight), subsequently regarded as one of the heights of Cuban literature, but in its time the object of scorn from fellow poets Gast√≥n Baquero, Eliseo Diego, and critics such as Cintio Vitier. Together with Jos√© Lezama Lima and Jos√© Rodr√≠guez Feo he founded Or√≠genes, despite his aesthetic disagreements with them. Among his most notable contributions were a number of poems, an essay titled El secreto de Kafka (The Secret of Kafka), and another essay on Argentine literature. In February 1946 Pi√±era traveled to Buenos Aires, where he would remain on and off until 1958, working for the Cuban Embassy as a proofreader and translator.Biblioteca de Traducciones Hispanoamericanas While in Argentina he forged friendships with Jorge Luis Borges, Victoria Ocampo, Graziella Peyrou, and Jos√© Bianco; the latter contributing the foreword to Pi√±era's collection of short stories, El que vino a salvarme (The One Who Came to Save Me), published by Editorial Sudamericana. Pi√±era also became friendly with Witold Gombrowicz, and was part of the team that translated Ferdydurke into Spanish. During this period he wrote his plays Jes√∫s and Falsa alarma (False Alarm). Pi√±era's first novel, La carne de Ren√© (Ren√©'s Flesh), was published in 1952. Three years later, following a bitter dispute among the co- founders of Or√≠genes which resulted in its closure, he founded his final magazine, Cicl√≥n (Cyclone). He would also occasionally contribute to Sur, as well as to the French magazines Lettres Nouvelles and Les Temps modernes. In 1958 he left Argentina and settled permanently in Cuba, arriving there shortly before the Cuban Revolution, contributing thereafter to the newspaper Revoluci√≥n and its supplement Lunes de Revoluci√≥n. In 1960 he staged Electra Garrig√≥ once again and published his complete plays. In 1968 he received Premio Casa de las Am√©ricas for the play Dos viejos p√°nicos (Two Old Panics), which would not be performed in Cuba until the 1990s. Beginning in 1971 Pi√±era was ostracized by the Cuban government and literary establishment because of his sharply divergent ideological beliefs and his homosexuality, which he never occulted.

Cumberland Furnace is served by a U.S. Post Office, ZIP Code 37051. History General James Robertson purchased the land in 1793 and built the first furnace. In 1804, Montgomery Bell moved to Middle Tennessee and purchased James Robertson's iron works business for $16,000. Bell expanded his operations and built other furnaces and mills including a hammer mill south of Charlotte, at Tennessee on Jones Creek using water power. By 1808, Bell was buying wood at 50 cents per cord for charcoal to fuel his Cumberland Furnaces which cast cannonballs used in the War of 1812 by General Andrew Jackson's troops at the Battle of New Orleans. A nearby unincorporated community where many of Bell‚Äôs workers lived is called Bell Town. Bell suffered losses in the Panic of 1819 and in 1824 he advertised the Narrows and other properties for sale in the Nashville Whig. Bell offered to sell his ironworks to the U.S. Army for an Armory but floods on the Harpeth were well known and that idea failed. Bell sold the ironworks to Anthony Wayne Van Leer, who was a member of a well known historical family in Pennsylvania and noted in the anti-slavery cause. Van Leer‚Äôs granddaughter married a Union Captain James P. Drouillard and built the near byhistorical Drouillard House on his property. His mansion was also used as a Union headquarters.

The town is also known as Rest Town owing to its strategic location next to East-West Highway , the main route linking Kedah and Penang to the east coast.  History  From the historical records, the first person to enter Gerik was Tun Saban, the son of Tun Perak, and the treasurer of the Malacca Sultanate in the early 16th century. During the fall of the Malacca government into the hands of the Portuguese, Tun Saban migrated to Hulu Patani and then moved to Belum, Gerik. He became the chairman of the community at Belum. Gerik is bordered by Reman State to the north. Raja Reman trespassed into Gerik and captured Klian Intan and Kroh (Pengkalan Hulu). By the 19th century, most of Gerik's territory was conquered by King Reman. In 1902, the monarchy in Reman was abolished by the Siamese government and the Gerik region was incorporated as a colony. On July 9, 1902, the Siamese government entered into an agreement with the British government to hand over Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan and Terengganu to British rule. The agreement was signed in Bangkok by Sir John Anderson (Straits Settlements) and the Siam Foreign Secretary. Among the conditions in the agreement, the Siamese government also had to hand over the Gerik district which had been taken by Raja Reman to the Perak government. The ceremony of handing over the Gerik area was held in Kroh on July 16, 1909.

He engages in dialogues with his father, mother, and elder brother. In Gide's version of the parable, the prodigal has a younger brother, who is on the verge of also leaving home; the returned prodigal promises to join this brother when he has made good.

He had left in the morning of February 14 to meet his accountant and then meet his mother for lunch in Manhattan. At 7:30 that morning, an unknown person rang the apartment building's security buzzer and Rashawn went down to meet him. According to other witnesses, Rashawn met a man outside his Brooklyn apartment and the two men entered the subway together at the Gates Avenue station. Witnesses believe the two exited at the Nostrand Avenue station in Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant a short time later. Rashawn was never seen alive again. Discovery of body On February 18, two bags full of body parts were found on the tracks near the Nostrand Avenue station, and the parts were positively identified through fingerprints as being Rashawn Brazell. An arm and leg, also identified as Brazell's, were found in a recycling plant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. His head was never found.

The police arrested Kwauhuru Govan, Brazell's cousin and former neighbor, who had a criminal history predating 2005; he had since moved to Florida and was imprisoned there in 2014 on an armed robbery conviction. Govan was charged with Brazell's murder. After DNA linked him to another unsolved Brooklyn homicide, he was extradited to New York and charged with the killing of Sharabia Thomas. Govan was convicted of Thomas' murder in 2018. Detectives who asked Govan about the Brazell case claim that he made false and evasive statements.

The former village also gives its name to a civil parish, which is still outside the town.Brampton civil parish (E04002864), Geography Linked Data, Office for National Statistics.

Cutthorpe is a small village about north-west of Chesterfield with a village school, a butcher's shop and a small post office/grocery store, three public houses and two historic halls, and forms part of the former parish of Brampton; the main road straggles through the village for three miles, reaching the Grange at its highest point, with commanding views all around. The parish also includes Eastmoor, the last hamlet encountered when going west on the A619 towards Bakewell. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 Census (including Wadshelf) was 1,201.  Entertainment  The Chatsworth Road area was known for the 'Brampton Mile.' This was a stretch of pubs, approximately a mile long, where a night out would include one drink in each bar. There are now fewer pubs in the area and many of the buildings have been demolished to make way for new businesses and housing development. In recent years the area has become known for its plethora of independent shops along Chatsworth Road. A number of new retail developments, notably 131 Chatsworth Road and the Hanger, have sprung up alongside well-established, traditional family businesses. The area has been loosely compared to Ecclesall Road in Sheffield. A festival celebrating the local community and small businesses on and around Chatsworth Road is held in October. A monthly publication, called S40 Local, seeks to promote the vibrancy of the local area and its many amenities. The Brampton area is also served by glossy monthly publication 'Twist'.  Housing  The area boasts several housing estates, some of which date from many decades ago. However, new housing is being built all the time and this area is rapidly expanding. Plans for regeneration of the former Walton Works site, which includes retail and housing development, is due to be considered by Chesterfield Borough Council in early 2013.  Politics  Brampton is divided into two electoral wards on Chesterfield Borough Council called Holmebrook and West. The area comes under Hipper Division on Derbyshire County Council.  Industry  Robinson and Sons established its box manufacturing business at Wheatfield House in Brampton in the 1840s. By the 1950s the company's packaging and dressings factories covered a large area by the River Hipper in Brampton, with a workforce of thousands of employees. The Robinson Packaging headquarters is still at Field House in Brampton but most of the manufacturing has closed in Chesterfield since the 1980s.

The name Liber Augustalis was invented by commentators who believed the laws were a statement of the theory of autocracy (David Abulafia, Frederick II (1988) 203. were a new legal code for the Kingdom of Sicily promulgated on 1 September 1231 by Emperor Frederick II. It was given at Melfi, the town from which Frederick's Norman ancestors had first set out to conquer the Mezzogiorno two centuries earlier. Originally a reform of the Assizes of Capua of 1220, themselves his reform of the Assizes of Ariano of 1140, the Constitutions formed the basis of Sicilian law for the next six centuries. The author of the Constitutions is purported to be Frederick himself, though Giacomo Amalfitano, Archbishop of Capua, appears as an influence as well. He was even reproved by the pope for accepting and advising clauses contrary to the wishes of the church. Traditionally, the work has been attributed to Pier delle Vigne, but it is almost certain that, while Frederick, Giacomo and Pier had their hand in it, the Liber is the product of months of work by a committee. The Constitutions were written in Latin and translated into Greek before their promulgation. They were meant to apply, as with previous Sicilian law, to all the peoples of the realm: Lombards, Greeks, Saracens, Germans, Jews. The 253 clauses are divided into three books: *The first regards public law (107 clauses; one of them missing in all manuscripts) *The second regards judicial procedure (52 clauses) *The third regards feudal, private, and penal law (94 clauses) The Constitutions, like the Assizes before them, strengthened the power of the king and diminished the power of his feudatories. The centralising and bureaucratising tendencies of Roger II's legislation continued a century later in the Constitutions. It also continued to emphasise the sacral role and God-given right to rule of the monarch. Frederick II wrote in the Constitutions that \\"we, whom He elevated beyond hope of man to the pinnacle of the Roman Empire.\\" Militarily, the Constitutions prohibited bearing arms without permission. A standing Saracen army was created to prevent the king from having to call up the unreliable barons, surely angered by the Constitutions. These, the feudatories, were gravely affected in other ways, too. For example, the sale of fiefs was banned, putting an end to subinfeudation, and all vassals were subject to the king's taxes and other imposts. Ecclesiastically, the Constitutions affected the bishops as they did all great landholders, but they also affected them in unique ways. The clergymen were made subject to the common courts. They were deprived also of judgement over heretics, prohibited from acquiring lands, and forced to sell inheritances. Also like the great dioceses and baronies, the cities were affected by the centralising laws which removed their powers and made them more directly subject to not only the king, but his ministers as well. Cities could not become communes, as many in Northern Italy had, and were prohibited from electing consuls or podest√†s, on pain of sack and pillage. Like the baronage, the cities were deprived of rights of penal justice. These were transferred to the king and his magistrates alone. These magistrates or ministers became a more important class. Fewer and fewer noblemen served the king as more and more simple freemen were raised to power. The magistrates were elected for a year pending reaffirmation and received a salary from the state. This made them loyal to the king and his administration, for without it they were nothing. The great officers of the Regno were the ancient ammiratus ammiratorum, the grand protonotary (or logothete), great Chamberlain, great seneschal, great chancellor, great constable, and master justiciar. The last was the head of the Magna Curia, the court of the king (his curia regis) and the final court of appeal. The Magna Curia Rationum, a division of the curia, acted as an auditing department on the great bureaucracy. Other than this, there was a sort of parliament, consisting of not only the barons, but the universities and the landed commoners. It did not debate or rubber-stamp legislation, which was the king's to make and unmake, but merely received it and promulgated, giving its advice where it could. Economically, state monopolies were imposed on silk, iron, and grain. On the other hand, tariffs on trade within the Regno were abolished. The privileges granted previously to Pisa and Genoa were, however, rescinded. Weights and measures were uniformly regulated across the realm. Finally, the equality of all citizens before the law was affirmed. The Constitutions made much of reducing the power of the nobility and of following the Roman tradition of equality before the law: thus, all freemen, all citizens, were equals, in theory. Likewise, for the benefit of commoners, Frederick banned trial by ordeal, ordering his judges to use instead \\"the common methods of proof which have been introduced both by the ancient laws and by our constitutions.\\" The Constitutions notably used reason and logic to dismiss the superstitious foundations of the ordeal; for example, the use of trial by hot iron was dismissed because people believed \\"the natural heat of white-hot iron grows hot and, what is even more foolish, grows cold for no good reason at all\\", and trial by water was forbidden because of the belief \\"that the defendant of the crime, who has been established only by his guilty conscience, will not be received by the element of freezing water, when, in fact, it is the retention of sufficient air that prevents him from submerging.\\" Frederick also banned trial by battle, ordering that more weight be given to the testimony of witnesses, although exceptions to this were granted to knights, and for cases in which no witnesses could be provided. The Constitutions also contain incidental information relating to the practice of medicine. Frederick proclaimed that, in order to become a medical practitioner, it was necessary to have some practical experience, which many European university-educated doctors did not have in 1231. According to Ernst Kantorowicz, the Liber \\"is the birth certificate of the modern administrative state.\\" Editions and translations Constitutionum Regni Siciliarum (ed. 1773) Literature * David Abulafia, Frederick II.

A waterpark, Buccaneer Bay, river boat rides, kayak and paddleboard rental are some of the other activities offered at Weeki Wachee Springs. Mermaid statue at Weeki Wachee Springs, Florida History A fashion photograph taken at Weeki Wachee spring, by Toni Frissell, first published in Harper's Bazaar, December 1947. ) Slide photo of Weeki Wachee Springs sometime in the 1950s The spring was named \\"Weeki Wachee\\" by Seminole Indians, which means \\"Little Spring\\" or \\"Winding River\\" in their language. The attraction was created in 1947 by stunt swimmer and attraction promoter Newt Perry, who based the show on underwater air hose breathing techniques. First an 18-seat theater, then later a newer theater with a capacity of 50, were embedded in the lime rock of the spring with viewing windows below the surface of the water, to allow visitors to watch the mermaids perform in the spring. \\"The Incredible Mr. Limpet\\", an American live- action/animated comedy film produced by Warner Bros. had its premiere on January 20, 1964, at the Weeki Wachee Springs Underwater Theater. It was the world's first underwater movie premiere. In 1982, Buccaneer Bay was opened with water slides, a lazy river, and a white sand beach for visitors to enjoy alongside the theater with the mermaid shows. Guests to the park have included Elvis Presley, Don Knotts, Esther Williams, Arthur Godfrey, Kevin Smith, and Larry the Cable Guy. Hollywood has occasionally used the attraction and its mermaids in the filming of movies such as Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid (1948), Neptune's Daughter (1949), and many television shows like Bobcat Goldthwait's Misfits & Monsters (2018). At one point, the attraction was owned by broadcast network ABC, and this led to an increase in publicity for the attraction. Currently, the park is owned by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and is a member of the Florida State Park System. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020. Recent events In 2005, English rock band Supergrass filmed their video for their song \\"Low C\\" at the Springs. They filmed a short documentary about the spring, as well as playing at a local bar and swimming with the mermaids. An NBC television special featuring Penn & Teller and filmed at the Springs was released later that year. In summer of 2006, stand-up comedian Thomas J. Kelly became the park's first ever male mermaid. His adventures were chronicled in a Web television series called \\"The Little Merman\\". On November 1, 2008, the state of Florida took over Weeki Wachee Springs as a state park. From May 22 until August 30, 2007, the discharge level at Weeki Wachee spring dropped to a level that allowed for cave divers to gain effective entry into the cave system at the spring. The Karst Underwater Research team successfully executed exploration dives and the necessary in-water decompression to explore approximately 6,700 feet in multiple passages at an average depth of 265 Feet Fresh Water (ffw) with a maximum depth of 407 ffw. The 407 ffw depth makes the cave system under Weeki Wachee springs the deepest known freshwater cave system in the United States. Scenes from Kelly Clarkson's video \\"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\\" include the mermaids of Weeki Wachee Springs. Key scenes from Amy Seimetz's directorial debut Sun Don't Shine take place at the Springs and include the mermaids. The 2017 documentary Mermaids featured the attraction as well as a number of former and serving mermaids.Mermaids - Documentary Panoramic picture of Weeki Wachee Springs, Florida, April 2012 See also * Cave diving * Glass-bottom boat * National Register of Historic Places listings in Hernando County, Florida References Further reading * External links * Weeki Wachee Springs State Park at Florida State Parks Weeki Wachee Cave System * National Geographic: \\"Mermaids\\" Fight to Save Florida Roadside Attraction * The Mermaids of Weeki Wachee Springs 1947 establishments in Florida Caves of Florida Bodies of water of Hernando County, Florida Mermaid shows Parks in Hernando County, Florida Protected areas established in 2008 Roadside attractions in Florida Springs of Florida State parks of Florida Tourist attractions in Hernando County, Florida Water parks in Florida National Register of Historic Places in Hernando County, Florida Parks on the National Register of Historic Places in Florida ","title":"Weeki Wachee Springs"},{"id":"4969867","text":"Sterky is a Swedish surname of Swiss originhttps://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=20152 that may refer to: * Anna Sterky, a 19th-century Swedish Social Democrat and union organiser * Fredrik Sterky, a 19th-century Swedish Social Democrat and union organiser See also * Styrbj√∂rn Sterki, Styrbj√∂rn the Strong *Victor Sterki References ","title":"Sterky"},{"id":"4969877","text":"Ipum of Geumgwan Gaya (died 407) (r. 346‚Äì407)Ilyeon gives these dates, which are widely accepted.

His body of work consists of a large number of compositions: symphonic, choral, ballet and theatre music, chamber, electronic, film scores, pieces for solo instruments, pieces in jazz and fusion style, songs in Greek and world poems. Early life Sfetsas was born in Amfilochia and raised in Lefkada where, at an early age, he studied music for the first time at the Philarmonic Band and the National Conservatory of the city with the late Fotis Vlachos. He continued his studies at the National Conservatory of Athens (1963‚Äì1966), where he studied the piano with Krino Kalomiri and theory of music with Michalis Vourtsis. On August 30, 1964, in Lefkada, he accompanied Maria Callas on the piano in her last performance in Greece. A few months after the 1967 dictatorship, he moved to Paris. There, on a French State scholarship (1969‚Äì1972), he pursued further studies with the composer and educator Max Deutsch (composition, analysis, orchestral conducting), while seeking the mentorship and advice of Iannis Xenakis, Luigi Nono and Henri Dutilleux. Composition The first public performance of his work (\\"Episodes for piano solo\\") took place just after the uprising of May '68 at the \\"Latin America Hall\\" in Paris, receiving favourable reviews. After that, his music was often performed and he had his first commissions (by French Radio and TV, the Ars Nova Orchestra and the Dance Group of Vitry). After that period, several of his works are performed in renowned international contemporary music festivals (Royan, Reims, Bordeaux and Paris); at the same time, he works on a regular basis with the contemporary dance group of Vitry and the choreographer Michel Cazerta. A portion of his Paris works were published by Editions Transatlantiques, and it was in Paris in 1974 that he released for the first time one of his works on record: Four-channel electro-acoustic music for the \\"Ballet Smog\\", one of the first pieces written for four-channel tape in the world. In Greece, he made his debut as a composer at the 4th Hellenic Week of Contemporary Music (Athens, 19‚Äì26 September 1971) with his work \\"Docimology\\". He returned to Greece in autumn of 1975, this time to stay. At the invitation of Manos Hatzidakis, he worked at the Third Programme of the Hellenic Radio (1975‚Äì1976) as a freelance producer. In 1977, as a regular employee of the Hellenic Radio, he served as head of the music departments of the 2nd and 1st Programmes, and from the summer of 1982 to January 1994 as director of the 3rd Programme. In 1980, his music for Pavlos Tassios' \\"Parangelia\\" receives first prize at the Film Festival of Thessaloniki. He also writes the music for Stigma, by the same director (1982), D. Panagiotatos' The night with Silena (1986), M. Ditsas' Night Exit (1991), N. Grammatikos' U Turn (1991) and \\"A time to kill\\" (1993). Since the recording of \\"Without Boundaries\\" (1980), several recordings of his work have been released on several labels (EMI, CBS, ENM, PRAXIS etc.), with favourable reviews. In the spring of 1991, he released his first digital recording (on CD), Silent Days, on UTOPIA; and in 1993, the CD Colours in Double, a tribute to the art of the great traditional music performer Vassilis Soukas, containing the works Colours in Double and Lyrical Suite (recorded live at the Festivals of Irakleion ('88) and Patra ('87)), in which the late musician had substantial solo parts. In 1999, his entire recordings were re-released in 8 CDs on FINEAS, a record label owned by S. Gavrielides Publications. Most of his work in the last few years has been commissioned by Greek and other cultural authorities and organizations, and has been performed in Europe, Australia and America by renowned music ensembles, such as the Bolshoi Soloists, the Ensemble Modern of Frankfurt, Polyrhythmia of Sofia, the Okada percussion ensemble of Tokyo, the Russo and Mlada Quartets, the Symphony Orchestras of Leipzig, Ljubljana, ABC (Australian Radio), ALEA (Boston University), the Orchestra of the Hellenic Radio and the State Orchestra of Thessaloniki. In addition, from its very early days, the Athens Concert Hall (Megaron) has on numerous occasions commissioned and hosted works by Kyriakos Sfetsas, performed by famous Greek and other soloists and ensembles, including the organist Daniel Chorzempa and the Camerata Orchestra. Critical response In volume 9B of the Dictionary of World Biography, the music critic Giorgos Leotsakos notes, among other things: \\"No other Greek 'avant-garde' composer's return to tradition was more impressive than that of Sfetsas. Before 1977, in France, he was distinguished by a sound 'pointillisme': a marked harmonic sensitivity, with which he organized imaginative soundcolour combinations into 'microstructures' spread out in an imaginary sound canvas, bringing to mind the paintings of Joan Mir√≥, who had charmed the composer at the time. (Docimology, one of his more beautiful and characteristic works, is from this period.) Chronologically, his musical turn Concert Music Slides, 1977 follows his coming home (1975): melody (tonal, modal, atonal), themes, elaboration as well as improvisation, 'physical' rhythms (sometimes asymmetrical and folkish), chords contradicted by unisoni, elements or inspirations from folk music (from Greece and Eastern cultures, either traditional or elaborated through 'ethnic' schools) and Byzantine music (his Love Song is performed by a cantor), and other codes or techniques of communication (e.g. jazz, rock). However, by replacing this 'hermetic' idiom with authenticated codes of communication, the music of Sfetsas expands sometimes into great lengths, and reveals a painful loneliness and a quest for the other, in which it is difficult to distinguish between the personal and the socio-environmental factors. Behind the persistence of his writing one can guess a dramatic need for communication. Despite the ruggedness of the themes and some instances of classical 'elaboration', the three parts of his gigantic (duration: 61'46\\"!) piano suite Cactus Light ('80-'83) often give the impression of one lonely pianist improvising. One of the most fascinating of his latest works is Moments of a Lonesome Town: within the aloneness and inhumanity of the modern world, the quest for the other continues, with a more emphatic lyricism. So, hope still persists.\\" External links * Kyriakos Sfetsas official webpage classical composers database on Kyriakos Sfetsas * Musicians Gallery on Kyriakos Sfetsas 1945 births Living people People from Amfilochia Greek film score composers Male film score composers Greek composers ","title":"Kyriakos Sfetsas"},{"id":"4969966","text":"Auf Achse Auf Achse (, \\"on the road\\", \\"on the axle\\") is a logistics-themed board game designed by Wolfgang Kramer and published in 1987 by FX Schmid.

The station is a contributing property to the Ulster and Delaware Railroad Depot and Mill Complex, a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. History This depot was originally constructed by the Rondout & Oswego Railroad with construction completed in January 1872. The R&O; would be reorganized into the New York, Kingston and Syracuse railroad only three months later, in April 1872. The NYK&S; RR itself only lasted until 1875, at which time it was reorganized into the Ulster & Delaware Railroad. The station as originally built consisted of a single rectangular structure, with an internal dividing wall separating passenger and freight rooms. It was substantially altered sometime between 1888 and 1891 by the U&D.; Some believe Helen Gould Shepherd (railroad tycoon Jay Gould's daughter) designed and/or financed the renovation. Local history has it, she wanted a more elaborate waiting room for her friends and family, so an addition was constructed on the north side of the building. The addition consisted of two rooms: the tickets agents office (facing the tracks through a bay window) also containing a telegrapher's office, and the main waiting room. Also of particular note, is that this station was equipped with what is believed to be the first indoor flush toilet in Delaware County, and central heating, with a common coal fired furnace in the basement with duct work and registers to transport hot air to the Ticket Agent's Office & Waiting Room upstairs. This \\"modern convenience\\" eliminated the ever-popular \\"potbelly\\" stove ever so present and common in railroad stations across the country. Another addition to the station at this time was a portico, or colonnade (open air roofed area similar to a pole barn) attached to the north side. Most U&D; RR stations did not have this feature. Roxbury, although not as busy as Halcottsville, did have several business located there, including a retail coal dealer, feed and grain supplier, and a paint factory as well as several local creameries. Although passenger service ended in 1954, the station agent stayed on until 1957. After that date, it was subsequently used in two commercial ventures, first by a feed & grain dealer from 1959-1976 (when freight service ended this same year); and then by a body shop owner, in the mid-1990s. Although the entire station was covered with metal siding by the feed supplier, little was changed on the inside, making it one of the best preserved U&D; stations. Roxbury Depot Museum Today the Roxbury Station proudly houses a multitude of interpretive display kiosks showing local history and interaction with local businesses, as well as maps and diagrams illustrating the history of the U&D; RR, and scale dioramas of the station in various eras. The structure itself, is in remarkably good shape (being protected by the sheet metal curtain wall); and the station is being restored by the Ulster and Delaware Railroad Historical Society, which other than the Roxbury Station restoration, has undertaken the restoration of a 1920 H.

At the time, the town of Sigtuna, situated to the north of lake M√§laren and to the south of Uppsala in the Swedish province of Uppland, had been the centre of royal power for some decades, and existed until the middle of the 12th century. It was eventually out-competed by the earlier pagan religious centre Gamla Uppsala (Old Uppsala), which was raised to the status of archbishopric in 1164 (see: Archdiocese of Uppsala). King Stenkil (about 1030-1066) is said to have been the driving force behind its establishment. First bishop is said to have been Adalvard the Younger (died before 1072). Five Sigtuna bishops are known from written sources, four diocesan bishops, but it seems that apart from Adalvard most were not stationed in Sigtuna and episcopal Sigtuna was mostly unoccupied. Approximately in 1120, the Diocese of Sigtuna was indicated but not of that of Uppsala.Florenslistan √∂ver den kyrkliga stiftsindelningen i Norden circa 1120 Uppsala diocese was formed, however, in the 1130s while Sigtuna ceased to have its own bishop. The Diocese of Sigtuna formally ceased at latest when the Diocese of Uppsala was elevated to archbishopric in 1164.  History  In the middle of town Sigtuna there was a royal estate on which the first stone church in the area around lake M√§laren was built in the end of the 11th century. The bishopric of Sigtuna was established with Adalvard the Younger around 1060, as the first one in Svealand. The above-mentioned stone church was the bishop's church, the cathedral. It was demolished during the high Middle Ages, but the remains of the walls are preserved below ground. The plot is now occupied by the Sigtuna Museum. The contemporary significance of the town was testified by Adam of Bremen, who in circa 1070 refers to Sigtuna as a \\"civitas magna\\".Swedish encyclopaedia, tapes 25 cr. 1091 (Sigtuna) During the early Middle Ages no less than six or seven stone churches were erected with surrounding cemeteries. All but the cathedral was laid along a newly built street outside the old settlement area. Of these churches, only remnants of the churches of Saint Peter, Saint Lawrence and Saint Olaf remain left as ruins. Of the other ones, nothing appears above ground. King Gustav I of Sweden allowed to use the stones from the ruins for the construction of Svartsj√∂ Palace. In contrast, King John III of Sweden later commanded the ruins to be preserved.NH Sj√∂borg, Collections of the Nordic region's ancient lover, I-III, 1822-1830 .

It is south of East Midlands Airport and off Junction 23A of the M1 motorway. A village of some 670 residents, it is located 14 km to the north-west of Loughborough and 2.5 km to the south-east of Castle Donington. At the 2011 census the population was included in the civil parish of Long Whatton and Diseworth. The settlement is in the Parish of Long Whatton and Diseworth, and lies within an undulating agricultural landscape and occupies a shallow valley created by the Diseworth Brook as it flows eastwards before becoming Long Whatton Brook and proceeding to its confluence with the River Soar. The four principal streets of the village - Grimes Gate, Hall Gate, Clements Gate and Lady Gate - meet at The Cross; a staggered crossroads close to the Church of St Michael's and All Angels. Page Lane runs parallel to Lady Gate. The Green running along the southern edge of the settlement gives access into Hall Gate - via The Bowley -and into Lady Gate. Diseworth Brook flows to the south of Hall Gate and is joined by tributaries to the east of Shakespear Close and near Town End. The famous astrologer and occultist, William Lilly was born in Diseworth on 1 May 1602. Diseworth Heritage Trust The Diseworth Heritage Trust is a charitable trust, registered in the UK (No. 1112223) that is dedicated to preserving the historical and architectural heritage of the village of Diseworth in Leicestershire, England, and its surrounding area, from its earliest origins to the present. The Trust was responsible for the restoration of the redundant Baptist Chapel building in Diseworth (originally built in 1752, and therefore one of the oldest in the county), as a local Heritage centre, which will provide a variety of facilities for education and entertainment. This was made possible by sponsorship from local and national organisations, including the Heritage Lottery Fund. The Trust welcomes members with a general interest in local history, as well as those directly associated with the village. The Trust works closely with the Diseworth and Long Whatton History Societies, and other organisations to develop interest in local history.  Diseworth's History  Archaeological evidence shows that the site of Diseworth was inhabited in the Roman, Saxon and Viking periods. Its position in a sheltered valley next to the brook is a classic setting for early settlement, and the development of farmsteads. Diseworth has had many variations on its name, but almost always with the suffix 'worth', meaning enclosed settlement. At the time of the Norman conquest, Diseworth was sufficiently important to be part of an award to a Norman knight, and appear in the Domesday book. William Lovett held some 360 acres in Diseworth, although his tenure did not last for long. By the early 12th century, land around Diseworth was held by the Earls of Leicester and Chester, and by Robert de Ferrers. Many disputes over the ownership of the land followed in the period up to the late 15th century, when in 1487 the estate was declared the property of Sir Henry Colet. The nearby Langley Priory had exercised considerable control over the parish church and the villagers, many of whom worked for the nuns. Benefactors who donated land to the Priory often chose land in Diseworth. Shortly before the dissolution of the Priory, along with other religious properties and land in England, Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII, purchased a considerable part of the village to found what became Christ's College, Cambridge. For the next five hundred years Diseworth was dominated by the owners of Langley Priory estate and Christ's College, and saw the villagers paying rent to either the Reverend Gentlemen of Christ's, or the new owners of Langley: first the Grays, then the Cheslyns and then the Shakepears. The college sold their interest in Diseworth in 1920, but there remain a few farms and houses still owned by landlords. Today, Diseworth is still notable for having several active farms contained within the village itself, although its proximity to East Midlands Airport is a constant reminder that its future prosperity is also dependent on the trade generated by its position in the M1 corridor, close to Derby, Nottingham and Leicester.

It stands in the centre of Kirkcudbright, on the south side of the River Dee which flows into the Solway Firth. The L-plan castle was the residence of the MacLellan family from whom it derived its name. The family sold the castle in 1752, and from 1782 to 1912 it was held by the Earls of Selkirk. Today, the site is curated by Historic Scotland. History MacLellan's Castle was covered in ivy in the 19th century. In 1569 Thomas MacLellan of Bombie was given the site of a ruined Greyfriars monastery in the town of Kirkcudbright. The monastery, which was built in around 1455, was demolished leaving only its chapel and on the site an L-plan castle was built. The chapel is now called Greyfriars Church. Construction of MacLellan's Castle began around 1577, instigated by Thomas. The work is commonly assumed to date to 1582 based on the year being carved into a stone panel above the entrance. Despite never being finished in its entirety, it was home to MacLellan's descendants until 1752 when it was sold to Sir Robert Maxwell. By this time the castle was in a state of ruin and the roof had collapsed. Thirty years later, Maxwell sold MacLellan Castle to Dunbar Douglas, 4th Earl of Selkirk. In MacGibbon and Ross' 1887 work, The Castellated and Domestic Architecture of Scotland, the authors remarked \\"the whole building is a mass of ivy, giving it the appearance of a huge haystack, of a green rather than yellow colour\\", however they were of the opinion that aside from the roof the building was in good condition. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland was created in 1908 to preserve Scotland's historic buildings. Several buildings were already under state care, and as part of this growing concern to preserve standing buildings twenty buildings (eight of them castles) were taken into state care between 1911 and 1913. MacLellan's Castle counted among these ‚Äì it was handed over to the state in 1912 ‚Äì and is now under the guardianship of Historic Scotland. Architecture MacLellan's Castle is laid out in an L-plan, consisting of two wings meeting at right angles. This type of tower house is typical of Scottish architecture and often dates from 1540‚Äì1680. One wing runs north‚Äìsouth and the other east‚Äìwest; they meet in the southwest corner. The simple 'L' shape is embellished with an additional tower attached to the southwest corner, and projections on the inner angle where the two wings meet. The four-storey castle has a kitchen on the ground floor and a great hall on the first for entertaining guests. The upper floors most likely provided accommodation. Behind the fireplace in the great hall is a peephole and on the other side is a small room dubbed the \\"Laird's Lug\\" where the conversations in the hall could be overheard. This was not an uncommon feature in Scottish tower houses. The castle was entered at the inner angle where the two wings join. On the exterior, above the doorway, is a panel divided into three parts. The two lower parts are carved two coats of arms: those of Thomas MacLellan, for whom the castle was built, and his wife, G. Maxwell.

The dynasty lost control of York in the mid 10th century, but reigned over the other domains at variously disputed times, depending on which rulers may be counted among their descendants. This has proved a difficult question for scholars to determine, because reliable pedigrees do not survive. Additionally, for between three and four decades, the U√≠ √çmair were overkings of the Kingdom of Scotland itself, distinct from the Kingdom of Strathclyde, of which they may also have been overkings, and later briefly the Irish province of Munster, dominated from Waterford, and later still, briefly the English kingdom of Mercia. In the west of Ireland, the U√≠ √çmair also supplied at least two kings of Limerick, from which they may have attempted to conquer Munster again. Two members are styled queens of Ireland in the Irish annals (they were also queen of Mide and queen of Munster, respectively), while another was queen of Leinster (and Osraige). In the Norse sources, another was queen of Norway. Finally, another may have been queen of Brega. The name U√≠ √çmair in Old Irish means \\"grandchildren\\" or descendants of Ivar, but the dynasty includes its progenitor and his sons. The Irish annals describe Ivar as the brother of Amla√≠b Conung and of Auisle, and the Annals of Ulster record his obituary under the year 873, reading: Imhar, rex Nordmannorum totius Hibernie & Brittanie, uitam finiuit [\\"Ivar, king of all the Norse of Ireland and Britain, ended his life\\"]. Probably the senior leader of the Great Heathen Army,Woolf (2007), p. 71 Ivar may thus have become the inspiration for the legendary Ivar the Boneless (fl. 865‚Äì860), son of Ragnar Lodbrok. In any event, U√≠ √çmair dynasts may also have exercised power as overkings of East Anglia during their career in Britain. Alex Woolf points out it would be a mistake to view the lordship as a \\"unitary empire\\";Woolf, Alex (2002) \\"Age of Sea-Kings: 900‚Äì1300\\", in: Donald Omand (ed.), The Argyll Book, Edinburgh: Birlinn, pp. 95‚Äì96. it was, rather, a collection of lordships ruled by the same kindred, with only varying degrees of unity depending on the political circumstances of the moment and the charisma of individual leaders. Especially in the early period, a great portion of the dynasty's wealth, probably the majority, came from the international slave trade, both as slavers themselves and from the taxation of it,Valante, passim for which they were infamous in their time. In this role they star as the principal antagonists in the early 12th-century Irish epic political tract The War of the Irish with the Foreigners, although the account is exaggerated.ed. & tr. James Henthorn Todd (1867) One of the greatest dynasties of the Viking Age, the U√≠ √çmair were at their height the most fearsome and wide-reaching power in the British Isles and perhaps beyond.The dynasty may have retained influence in their Scandinavian homelands, and also held some in Normandy. For both these areas our sources are very poor. However, unlike the contemporary Rurikids in the East they ultimately failed to make any long-lasting territorial gains of significance and are considered a strategic failure, despite their considerable economic and political influence. √ì Corr√°in, Downham, Woolf, Valante Ancestral homeland Some historians believe √çmar and Ivar the Boneless to be identical, others claim they are two different individuals. According to Irish annals, √çmar was the son of Gofraid (also Goffridh, Gothfraid or Gu√∞r√∏√∞r), who was the king of Lochlann. The Norwegians at this point were often referred to as Lochlanns by the Irish. Lochlann was widely accepted among scholars as being identical to Norway, recently however this has been questioned, among others by Donnchadh √ì Corr√°in. His and others' theory is that Lochlann was the \\"viking Scotland\\" (Norse/Norwegian settlements on the Scottish islands and northern mainland). Whether the Irish annals used the term Lochlann to refer to Norway or to the Norse settlements in Scotland is still a matter of debate, however by the 11th century the term had come to mean Norway.http://www.ucc.ie/celt/Vikings%20in%20Scotland%20and%20Ireland.pdf According to Donnchadh √ì Corr√°in there is no evidence that any branch of the royal Danish dynasty ruled in Ireland. He also claims that √çmar's brother, Amla√≠b Conung (the name \\"Conung\\" is from the Old Norse konungr and simply means \\"king\\"), who often has been identified as part of the royal Norwegian dynasty (Ynglingene), was in fact not. He argues that both √çmar and his brothers were part of a Norse dynasty centered in and around the Scottish mainland. The Norwegian historian Kim Hjardar and archaeologist Vegard Vike claim that √çmar is the same person as the Dane Ivar the Boneless, and that he and the Norwegian chieftain Amla√≠b Conung (Olaf the White) arrived in Ireland as leaders of a coalition of Vikings whose goal was to take control over the Viking settlements in Ireland. When the Irish annals describe √çmar and Amla√≠b Conung as brothers, Hjardar and Vike claims that this has to be interpreted as a metaphor for \\"warrior brothers\\" or \\"brothers in arms\\".Kim Hjardar & Vegard Vike, Vikings at War, p.224-226. Dynasts The following list contains only members mentioned in the Irish annals and other reliable and semi-reliable sources, such as the Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib, and among those only the ones who can be placed in the pedigree with relative confidence. Thus it is by no means complete. Among recent developments in scholarship it has been argued that the historical king of Northumbria contributing to the character of Eric Bloodaxe was actually an U√≠ √çmair dynast.Downham 2004, passim; 2007, passim First proposed by James Henthorn Todd in 1867,Todd 1867 and most recently considered by Alex Woolf and Clare Downham, it is possible the U√≠ √çmair were peculiar in that some early members, and possibly the entire known later dynasty, descended from the founder via the female line.Woolf (2007) p. 131; Downham (2007) p. 34. The latter speculates that the known grandsons of √çmar, who lack a patronymic, and are referred to as \\"ua √çmair\\", may have been the \\"children of a daughter (or daughters) of √çvarr\\". She provides a note that \\"Alex Woolf has put forward this idea in conversation\\". After various authors. Birthdates are unknown. mac = son of; ingen = daughter of; ua = grandchild of; Ua (h)√çmair = surname (descendant of √çmar). * √çmar/√çvar/Ivar/√çvarr (died 873) ** B√°rid mac √çmair (died 881) ** Sichfrith mac √çmair (died 888) ** Sitriuc mac √çmair (died 896) ** ? mac/ingen √çmair, and/or among the above sons *** Amla√≠b ua √çmair (died 896) *** √çmar ua √çmair (died 904) *** Ragnall ua √çmair (died 920/1) **** ? mac Ragnaill (died 942) **** √çmar (died 950)? ***** probably √çmar of Waterford (died 1000) ****** Gilla P√°traic mac √çmair (died 983) ****** Ragnall mac √çmair (died 995) ****** Donndub√°n mac √çmair (died 996) ****** Ragnall mac √çmair II (died 1018) ******* ? mac Ragnaill (died 1015) ******* Ragnall mac Ragnaill (died 1035) ****** Sihtric mac √çmair (died 1022) *** Sitric C√°ech (died 927) **** Sichfrith mac Sitric (died 937) **** Ausle mac Sitric (died 937) **** Aralt mac Sitric (died 940) ***** probably Maccus mac Arailt (died 984/7) ***** probably Gofraid mac Arailt (died 989) ****** Ragnall mac Gofraid (died 1005) ****** Lagmann mac Gofraid (died ?) ******* Amla√≠b mac Lagmann (died 1014) ******** ?

He was either a descendant of Ivar of Waterford (died 1000) or Gofraid mac Arailt (died 989). That of Cacht ingen Ragnaill, Queen of Donnchad mac Briain, may or may not depend upon Echmarcach's. =Family tree= Later Waterford and Limerick The independent dynasty of Waterford founded or continued by Ivar of Waterford (died 1000) cannot be linked genealogically to the 'central' line of Dublin kings, but James Henthorn Todd gave him a descent from Ragnall ua √çmair, who never ruled there.Todd, p. 294. He is followed by Valante, p. 178. Their claim to Dublin and the names of their dynasts suggest they did belong to the dynasty.Downham, p. 56-7 Like in the case of the late Waterford dynasty, the pedigree of the last Norse to rule in Limerick is also uncertain. Ivar of Limerick (died 977), and surnamed Ua h√çmair, features prominently in the early 12th century saga Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib, although he appears less in the annals, which are lacunose and in general poorer for western Ireland. In any case he and/or the Waterford dynasty are probably survived today through intermarriage with the O'Donovan family, verifiably associated with both and known for their use of U√≠ √çmair dynastic names in medieval times. A notable sept of the O'Donovans known as the Sliocht √çomhair or \\"Seed of Ivor\\" survived into early modern times. It is also periodically claimed that some of the family may even be male line descendants of Ivar of Waterford, a variant of which (through his son Donndub√°n) actually appeared in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica for a few decades.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica This remains unverified and the family do not make this last claim themselves. All (surviving) septs profess a Gaelic lineage. Loss of Dublin How long the U√≠ √çmair remained in Dublin after losing it to the U√≠ Cheinnselaig in 1052 is unknown. Following the death of Diarmait mac Ma√≠l na mB√≥ in 1072 the kingship appears to have been held by one Gofraid mac Amla√≠b meic Ragnaill, who may or may not have been a candidate supported by Toirdelbach Ua Briain. While it has been argued he was installed by Toirdelbach,√ì Cr√≥inin the annals themselves make no such statement, which but for one only briefly report Gofraid's death in 1075, and variously style him King of the Foreigners and King of Dublin. But according to the Annals of Inisfallen \\"Gofraid grandson of Ragnall, king of √Åth Cliath, was banished over sea by Tairdelbach Ua Briain, and he died beyond the sea, having assembled a great fleet [to come] to Ireland.\\" So Gofraid, regardless of how he took the throne, thought he had some chance of reestablishing the dynasty independent in Dublin in spite of the Gaels. Godred Crovan may have been successful for a period after him. Later Ireland in general, and intermarriage The U√≠ √çmair dynasty was the precursor of a number of families in Ireland, both Gaelic and Norse speaking. However, the Norman invasion of Ireland led to the destruction of a vast majority of the medieval Norse-Irish and Gaelic aristocracy alike. This destruction was completed with the later Tudor conquest. Nevertheless, dense clusters of given names strongly associated with the Norse dynasty can be found in notionally Gaelic families, in the great genealogical compilations of Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh and C√∫ Choigcr√≠che √ì Cl√©irigh, and in various other sources. And, while the dynasty was concentrated in Dublin, Waterford and Limerick, and thus in the southern half of Ireland, Gaelic families later using their given names with great frequency are found mainly in the northern half of Ireland: their pedigrees associate them with the Connachta, U√≠ Maine, and Northern U√≠ N√©ill. None of these northern dynasties have a documented history of willing association with the U√≠ √çmair, or in the case of the first two any association at all. The U√≠ √çmair are only documented intermarrying with the Osraighe (the FitzPatricks), Laigin, O'Brien dynasty, the Southern U√≠ N√©ill Clann Cholm√°in and S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine and the aforementioned O'Donovans. In any event, the one long surviving source that might have contained pedigrees of surviving septs of the U√≠ √çmair themselves was a section in the Great Book of Lecan. This section, specifically focused on the pedigrees and doings of the Norse families of Ireland, was still in existence in the 17th century, as reported by Mac Firbis himself, but has since become lost.Alexander Bugge (ed. & tr.), of Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh, On the Fomorians and the Norsemen. Christiania: J. Chr. Gundersens Bogtrykkeri. 1905. See Bugge's introduction. From his daughter M√°el Muire the FitzPatricks of Ossory are descendants of Gofraid mac Arailt, probable grandson of Sitric C√°ech, King of Dublin. Their ancestor Cerball mac D√∫nlainge counted √çmar I (died 873) as an ally. Later Mann and the Isles =Crovan dynasty= Descendants of the Dublin U√≠ √çmair most likely persisted into the 13th century in the line of Godred Crovan, King of Dublin and King of Mann and the Isles, even though his ancestry is not completely agreed upon.Se√°n Duffy, \\"Irishmen and Islesmen in the Kingdom of Dublin and Man 1052‚Äì1171\\", in √âriu 43 (1992): 93‚Äì133. p. 106 He was most likely the grandson of √çmar mac Arailt above, one of the last certain U√≠ √çmair kings of Dublin and a grandson of Amla√≠b Cuar√°n. Godred's descendants, although vassals of the Kings of Norway, continued to rule into the 1260s, the last being Magn√∫s √ìl√°fsson (to 1265), or briefly his son Gu√∞r√∏√∞r (1275). =Clann Somhairle= Although their descent from Godred Crovan is through the female line, Alex Woolf believes the Clann Somhairle (Clan Donald and Clan MacDougall) or the Lords of the Isles can be regarded as a \\"cadet branch\\" of the U√≠ √çmair, as they apparently based their claim to the Isles on this descent (according to Woolf).Alex Woolf, The origins and ancestry of Somerled: Gofraid mac Fergusa and 'The Annals of the Four Masters', Medieval Scandinavia 15 (2005) Their founder Somerled married Ragnhild, daughter of Olafr Godredsson, King of Mann and the Isles and son of Godred Crovan. This of course assumes these dynasts belonged to the U√≠ √çmair. Sir Iain Moncreiffe attempted to reconstruct a male line descent from Echmarcach mac Ragnaill himself to Somerled.Iain Moncreiffe, The Highland Clans: the dynastic origins, chiefs and background of the Clans connected with Highland history and of some other families. Clarkson N. Potter. Revised edition, 1982. p. 56. Gwynedd Amla√≠b mac Sitriuc (√ìlafr son of Sigtrygg Silkbeard, King of Dublin) became an ancestor of the Kings of Gwynedd through his daughter Ragnhild, wife of Cynan ab Iago and mother of the famous Gruffudd ap Cynan.

British Museum Basse-taille (bahss-tah-ee) is an enamelling technique in which the artist creates a low-relief pattern in metal, usually silver or gold, by engraving or chasing. The entire pattern is created in such a way that its highest point is lower than the surrounding metal. A translucent enamel is then applied to the metal, allowing light to reflect from the relief and creating an artistic effect. It was used in the late Middle Ages, and then again in the 17th century. Medieval examples A 14th- century silver plaque in basse-taille with translucent enamels, with considerable losses, showing the prepared metal surfaces beneath, and the tinting with different colours. The technique had been known to the Ancient Romans, but was lost at the end of the Middle Ages until the 17th century.\\"British Museum Investigation\\"; Lightbown; Maryon (1971), 188; Osbourne, 333 Translucent enamel is more fragile than opaque enamel, and medieval survivals in good condition are very rare. Medieval examples begin in Italy in the 13th century, with the earliest dated work being a chalice by the Sienese goldsmith Guccio di Mannaia, made for Pope Nicholas IV about 1290, which is part of the collection of the Treasure Museum of the basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi. The technique then spread to other centres for high- quality courtly work, at a time when the champlev√© enamels associated above all with Limoges had become almost mass-produced and relatively cheap. It is generally agreed that the late 14th century Royal Gold Cup, now in the British Museum, is the outstanding surviving example of basse taille enamel.Osbourne, 333 It is one of only four known survivals done on gold, including both secular or religious pieces; another is the small Salting Reliquary, also in the British Museum.Dalton, 11. The \\"Salting Reliquary\\" , British Museum Highlights, accessed, June 16, 2010. The \\"King John Cup\\" in King's Lynn, of ca. 1340, silver-gilt with transparent enamel, is the best example of basse- taille work probably made in England; the metalwork expert Herbert Maryon describes this and the Royal Gold Cup as the \\"two examples of outstanding merit, unsurpassed in any collection\\".\\"Maryon (1971)\\";Alexander & Binski, #541 However it is unclear if most of the enamel at King's Lynn is original.\\"Maryon (1971)\\", 187; (Poor image of King John Cup from West Norfolk Council). See Campbell, 435-436, with good photo and full catalogue entry; Osbourne, 333. Four restorations and re-enamellings between 1692 and 1782 are recorded in inscriptions under the base - see Campbell. The technique was rediscovered in the 17th century, but was not much practiced thereafter. In a variant of the technique, translucent enamel was applied over a guilloch√© machine-turned metal backing by Peter Carl Faberg√© on the Faberge eggs and other pieces from the 1880s until the Russian Revolution, and this technique is still used, usually in a single colour.Marit Guinness Aschan and Rika Smith McNally. \\"Enamel.\\" In Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online, Subscription required (accessed July 28, 2010). 17th century The revived technique was used in the 17th century for the covers and faces of pocket watches, gold boxes and similar items, but mostly with opaque enamel, achieving a rather different effect from medieval examples using translucent enamel. The French watchmaker Josias Jolly made frequent use of it. Technique Medallion of the Death of the Virgin, with damaged basse-taille enamel The process for creating basse- taille enamel began by marking the outline of the design and the main internal outlines on the gold with a tool called a \\"tracer\\". Then the interior area was worked, either with chasing tools, hammering and punching rather than cutting, or with chisels, to form a shallow recess to hold the enamel. The more important parts of the design were modelled by varying the depth of the surface to produce different intensities of colour when the translucent enamel was added; for example in the Royal Gold Cup the gold under folds of drapery often rises near the surface to create a paler highlight. In the example illustrated with Luke's ox the lowest lobe shows tufts of grass formed by cutting deeper into the background. In many of the recessed areas further decoration was added by either engraving or punching which would show through the translucent enamel, or to facet the background so the reflections change as the viewing angle changes slightly. Most background areas to the enamelled scenes were decorated in the same way. Finally the surfaces were cleaned up, made good and polished, perhaps including scraping off any bumps showing through on the reverse of the metal.Lightbown. Maryon (1951) - see further reading - and his colleagues established the method for making the recesses; Read and Dalton had thought they were cut out with chisels. For other objects with translucent enamels, see Campbell, 458-461. The enamel lies flush with the gold surfaces; it was a preparation of finely ground glass paste applied with great care to the prepared recessed areas, and then fired. When different colours of enamel meet each other with a neat boundary, this was achieved by firing one colour with a retaining border of gum tragacanth before adding the next. The difficulty was often increased by the application of tints of a different colour to a base shade of enamel before firing, so that the added colour blends gradually into the background colour around the edges of the tinted area. This is especially used on \\"flux\\", or colourless enamel, as in the ground areas, rocks and trees. In the Royal Gold Cup, flux was also used for flesh areas as on a gold background it darkens slightly when hard to a suitable colour for skin. The rouge clair or \\"ruby glass\\" red, used so effectively here, was made by adding tiny particles of copper, silver and gold to the glass; here scientific tests have shown that copper was used. After firing the enamel was polished flush with the surrounding metal, which was presumably decorated last.

However, he should not be confused with Ross Youngs, an outfielder who played for the New York Giants from 1917 to 1926 and who was also known by the nickname \\"Pep\\". Nor should he be confused with Pep Young who played at second base in the major leagues from 1933 to 1945.t was an American professional baseball player and coach. A native of Philadelphia, Young played nine seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), principally as a second baseman, from 1913 to 1922, including nine seasons in Major League Baseball with the New York Yankees in 1913, the Detroit Tigers from 1915 to 1921, and the Philadelphia Athletics in 1922. He threw right-handed and batted as a switch hitter. Over the course of Young‚Äôs big league career, he appeared in 1,022 games, 993 as a second baseman, and compiled a .247 batting average. Fueled by a disciplined batting eye, Young's on-base percentage was nearly 100 points higher at .339. He collected 495 bases on balls and struck out only 235 times in 4,342 plate appearances. Young was also known as one of the best defensive second baseman in the American League (AL) during his playing career until a back injury in 1921 led to erratic throwing. After Young‚Äòs playing career ended, ge served as a college baseball coach in Philadelphia for the Temple Owls baseball team from 1932 to 1942 and for the Saint Joseph's Hawks baseball team from 1948 to 1955. In 19 seasons as a head coach, Young compiled a 158‚Äì154 win‚Äìloss record. Early years Young was born in 1888 in Philadelphia. His father operated a grocery store in Philadelphia. He attended Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland. Professional baseball =Minor leagues= Young began playing professional baseball in 1910 and 1911 with the Scranton Miners. He continued to play in the minor leagues with the Steubenville Stubs in 1911 and the Harrisburg Senators in 1911 and 1912. In 1912, he drew attention after he compiled a .308 batting average in 357 at bats, scored 79 runs, stole 31 bases, and in 80 games at shortstop garnered 284 assists and 165 putouts with a .941 fielding percentage. While playing in the minors, he earned the nickname \\"Pep\\". According to a 1913 newspaper account: \\"He is the sort of player much sought by the big leaguers. One who is on his toes all the time, chock full of life and ginger. It was his great display of energy in the minors that earned him the nickname of 'Pep.'\\" Former major league shortstop and manager Arthur Irwin called Young as promising a young shortstop as he ever saw. =New York Yankees= In January 1913, Young signed with the New York Yankees. He appeared in his first major league game on April 10, 1913. He appeared in only seven games for the Yankees, all as the team's starting shortstop, compiled a .067 batting average in 15 at bats, and committed five errors. Roger Peckinpaugh won the job as the Yankees' regular shortstop, and on April 27, 1913, the Yankees released Young to the Sacramento Sacts of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). =Sacramento Sacts= Young appeared in 160 games for Sacramento in 1913. His father was opposed to Young choosing baseball as a career and offered him a fifty percent stake in the family grocery store if Young would give up baseball at the end of the 1913 season. Young announced his retirement, but changed his mind and returned to Sacramento in 1914. He appeared in 199 games in 1914, and his batting average rose to .275. In September 1914, pitcher John Birdie Williams said of Young: \\"Pep Young is the best infielder on the coast today. He is a wonderful fielder, a great base runner, a fine man to get passes, and he used to be a fairly good hitter. . . . The best description I can give is that he is a second Donie Bush, and you know what that means.\\" =Detroit Tigers= On August 12, 1914, Young was sold by Sacramento to the Detroit Tigers on the condition he would finish the 1914 season with Sacramento. Young remained as the Tigers' starting second baseman for seven seasons from 1915 to 1921. During his first year with the Tigers, Young received daily, one-on-one batting instruction from the team's center fielder, Ty Cobb. During the 1915 Tigers season, the club compiled a 100‚Äì54 for the second highest winning percentage (.649) in franchise history. Young appeared in 123 games for the 1915 Tigers, including 113 as the team's starting second baseman. He only managed to compile a .243 batting average in 1915, but he demonstrated a sharp batting eye and drew 53 bases on balls to boost his on-base percentage to .339. He led the American League's second basemen with 32 errors, but showed promise in also ranking highly among the league second basemen with 371 assists (fourth), a 5.46 range factor per nine innings (fourth), 233 putouts (fifth), 44 double plays turned (fifth), and a .950 fielding percentage (fifth). Throughout his career, Young's offensive contributions were fueled by his discipline as a batter and an ability to collect bases on balls and avoid striking out. At five feet, five inches, Young's small stature assisted in allowing for a correspondingly small strike zone. In 1916, he drew 62 bases on balls for a .342 on-base percentage. In 1918, he actually drew nearly as many walks (54) as hits (56) and struck out only 17 times in 368 plate appearances. Over the course of his career, Young collected 495 bases on balls and struck out only 254 times in 4,341 plate appearances. Whether due to the tutelage of Ty Cobb or the arrival of the live-ball era, Young's offensive numbers jumped dramatically in 1920. That year, he had a batting average of .291 (up from .211 the prior year) and an on-base percentage of .406. He had a career highs with 173 hits and 85 walks, with only 30 strikeouts in 705 plate appearances. Young saw his offensive numbers climb further in 1921, as he hit for a career high .299 batting average and a .406 on-base percentage. The 1921 season saw remarkable hitting throughout the Detroit lineup. The 1921 Tigers still hold the American League record for highest single season team batting average at .316. Of the starting position players, only Young and shortstop Donie Bush, who was traded to the Washington Senators in August, failed to break the .300 mark, and Young only missed by one point. But true to the adage that \\"good pitching beats good hitting\\", the 1921 Tigers lacked strong pitching and finished in sixth place, 27 games behind the Yankees, despite averaging 5.7 runs per game. Despite his abilities as a contact hitter, Young's greatest contribution came in his fielding. In eight seasons as a second baseman (1915‚Äì1922), Young proved to be a talented fielder. In 1919, Young's range factor rating of 5.70 was 51 points higher than the league average for second basemen. He collected season highs of 405 putouts (1920), 449 assists (1917), and 55 double plays (1916). His 449 assists was tops among American League second basemen in 1917, though he also led the league's second basemen in errors in 1915 and 1918. For his career, he collected 2,411 putouts, 3,009 assists, and 359 double plays. Young was also involved in three triple plays as a second baseman, including one of the most unusual double plays in history. On May 18, 1921, in a game against the Boston Red Sox at home in Detroit, Young started a 4‚Äì4‚Äì6 double play (i.e., second basemen makes two outs and third basemen makes the final out) ‚Äì one of only three such plays in MLB history. After years of reliable defensive play, Young began to have problems with the accuracy of his throws in 1921. One writer noted: > \\"His arm suddenly went wrong, and try as he might he couldn't make the short > toss to first base with any degree of accuracy. Time after time he would > make a sensational stop only to follow it with a weird throw to the cushion. > His whip seemed to become paralyzed momentarily with the result that batsmen > were getting \\"lifes\\" with what should have been certain outs. Young's > trouble was mental, as he could throw with great speed, but no accuracy.\\" Young's erratic throwing led to his removal from the lineup in the latter part of the 1921 season. During the off-season, Young stated than an x-ray had revealed that he had been playing with a \\"dislocated vertebrae\\" for which he was undergoing treatment in Philadelphia. =Philadelphia Athletics= On April 3, 1922, the Tigers placed Young on waivers. Ty Cobb said at the time that he doubted whether Young would regain his old form. On April 7, he was claimed off waivers by Connie Mack and the Philadelphia Athletics. This gave Young the opportunity to play for his home town team. Young appeared in 125 games for the 1922 Athletics, including 116 games as the team's starting second baseman. Young's arrival required the Athletics' second baseman, Jimmy Dykes, to move to third base for the 1922 season. Young compiled a .223 batting average and .309 on-base percentage in 1923. Young spent only one season with the Athletics, appearing in his last major league game on September 29, 1922. On February 7, 1923, Young was given an unconditional release by the Athletics. At the time of his release, one writer noted it marked \\"the passing of one of the smartest men in the game,\\" an individual who \\"played 'heads up' baseball, and in his prime was considered one of the best second sackers in the majors.\\" =Minor leagues= In February 1923, Young was offered a contract by the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. He declined the offer and retired from professional baseball. He reportedly signed a contract in March 1923 with a club in Chester, Pennsylvania. In a game played on June 30, 1923, Young had five hits for Chester, matching the hit total of the entire opposing team. He was reportedly \\"instrumental\\" in helping Chester win a pennant in 1923. College coaching career After his career as a professional baseball player, Young coached college baseball in his hometown of Philadelphia. On March 1, 1932, he was hired as the head coach of the Temple Owls baseball team. He remained the head coach at Temple for 11 seasons from 1932 to 1942. He compiled a 110‚Äì85 record at Temple. In November 1942, Young was granted a leave of absence from Temple to serve for the duration of World War II as an associate inspector of engineering machinery at a war plant. On March 23, 1948, Young was hired as the head coach of the Saint Joseph's Hawks baseball team. He coached at Saint Joseph's from 1948 to 1955. He compiled a 48‚Äì69 record in eight years at Saint Joseph's. He was inducted into the Saint Joseph's University Baseball Hall of Fame in 2000. Later years In January 1965, Young died in Philadelphia after a brief illness at age 76. He was survived by his wife and a daughter.

Education and business career Kemp was born at Beechwood, Rochdale, Lancashire, and educated at Shrewsbury and Mill Hill Schools.Published under Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians. Matriculating at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1883, aged 16, Kemp transferred to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1884, where he graduated B.A. in the Classical Tripos in 1888. In business, Kemp went into the woollen industry eventually becoming Chairman of Kelsall & Kemp, flannel manufacturers. Cricket From 1885 to 1892, Kemp played first- class cricket for Lancashire and Cambridge University. A batsman, he scored three centuries all against Yorkshire - 109 in the Roses Match, at Huddersfield, in 1885 whilst still a teenager and 125 and 103 within 18 days of each other in 1886 at Fenner‚Äôs and Sheffield respectively. While at Shrewsbury School he appeared in one county cricket match for Shropshire. He was also, at university, a lawn tennis 'Blue'. Politics In 1895, he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Heywood as Liberal Unionist. He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to William Ellison-Macartney, Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, until January 1900, when he resigned to serve in the Second Boer War. In 1904, along with Winston Churchill, Kemp was among a group of Conservative and Liberal Unionist Free Traders who crossed the floor to join the Liberals in response to Joseph Chamberlain's Tariff reform policies. In 1909, he was knighted for his war services and at the January 1910 general election he was elected MP for Manchester North West, this time as a Liberal. Kemp found himself increasingly out of step with the actions of the Liberal government. He was opposed to the Liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer Lloyd George's financial policies. He also opposed Lloyd George's advocacy of Welsh disestablishment. His long-standing opposition to Irish Home Rule had not diminished and he opposed the Liberal Government's Irish Home Rule bill. As he still felt out of step with the Unionist's advocacy of Tariff Reform, he decided to retire from the House of Commons.A Liberal Chronicle 1908-1910 by Jack Pease He declared that he \\"loathed politics\\". A year later he was raised to the peerage as Baron Rochdale, of Rochdale in the County Palatine of Lancaster. Military career Kemp had been a captain of the Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry since July 1891. In early February 1900, Kemp volunteered for active service in South Africa during the Second Boer War. He was appointed a captain of the Imperial Yeomanry, in command of the 23rd company (the Yeomanry detachment of the Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry), to serve as part of the 8th Battalion Imperial Yeomanry. His company left Liverpool on the SS Africa on 12 February, and arrived in Cape Town the following month. For his service he was mentioned in despatches. He left again for South Africa in May 1902, as temporary lieutenant-colonel in command of the 32nd Battalion of the Imperial Yeomanry, including a machine-gun section which he had helped raise. The battalion arrived shortly after the war ended by the Treaty of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902, and never saw any fighting. Kemp obtained leave to return home before his regiment, and left Cape Town on the SS Kildonan Castle in late September 1902, arriving at Southampton the following month. He relinquished his commission with the Imperial Yeomanry and was granted the honorary rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the Army on 12 October 1902. Called to war again in 1914, Lord Rochdale was Lieutenant-Colonel in command the 1st/6th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, part of 125th (1/1st Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade, and was temporarily Brigadier-general of 127th (1/1st Manchester) Brigade of the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division during the Battle of Gallipoli in 1915.Maj A.F.

New names were given to the dioceses, as the old ones were in use by the Church of England. The bull aroused considerable anti-Catholic feeling among English Protestants. History When Catholics in England were deprived of the normal episcopal hierarchy, their general pastoral care was entrusted at first to a priest with the title of archpriest (in effect an apostolic prefect), and then, from 1623 to 1688, to one or more apostolic vicars, bishops of titular sees governing not in their own names, as diocesan bishops do, but provisionally in the name of the Pope. At first there was a single vicar for the whole kingdom, later their number was increased to four, assigned respectively to the London District, the Midland District, the Northern District, and the Western District. The number of vicariates was doubled in 1840, becoming eight: the apostolic vicariates of the London district, the Western, Eastern, and Central districts, and the districts of Wales, Lancashire, Yorkshire, and the North. The legal situation of Catholics in England and Wales was altered for the better by the Catholic Relief Act 1829, and English Catholics, who before had been reduced to a few tens of thousands, received in the 19th century thousands of converts from Anglicanism and millions of Irish Catholic immigrants, so that Catholics came to form some 10% of the general population of England and a considerably higher proportion of church-goers.Modern History Sourcebook In response to petitions presented by local clergy and laity, Pope Pius IX issued the bull Universalis Ecclesiae restoring the normal diocesan hierarchyThe full text of the bull is given, in English translation, in . The reasons stated in the bull are: \\"Considering the actual condition of Catholicism in England, reflecting on the considerable number of the Catholics, a number every day augmenting, and remarking how from day to day the obstacles become removed which chiefly opposed the propagation of the Catholic religion, We perceived that the time had arrived for restoring in England the ordinary form of ecclesiastical government, as freely constituted in other nations, where no particular cause necessitates the ministry of Vicars Apostolic.\\" The London district became the metropolitan Diocese of Westminster and the diocese of Southwark; the Northern district became the diocese of Hexham; that of Yorkshire became the diocese of Beverley; the district of Lancashire became the dioceses of Liverpool and Salford; the Welsh district (which included neighbouring English territory) became the two dioceses of Menevia and Newport and Shrewsbury; the Western district became the dioceses of Clifton and Plymouth; the Central district became the dioceses of Nottingham and Birmingham; and the Eastern district became the diocese of Northampton. Thus the restored hierarchy consisted of one metropolitan archbishop and twelve suffragan bishops. { ! Diocese !! Bishop - ! Westminster  Nicholas Patrick Stephen Wiseman - !

Thus there was not to be a Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury. Instead, the Diocese of Westminster was created with its own archbishop. The Archbishop of Westminster was likewise not declared Primate of All England. However, he and his successors see themselves as successors to the Catholic Archbishops of Canterbury. Accordingly, the heraldic arms of Westminster, featuring the pallium, is similar to that of Canterbury, with Westminster claiming to have better right to display the pallium, which is no longer granted to the Archbishop of Canterbury.arms of the Diocese of Westminsterarms of the Archdiocese of Canterbury The bull Universalis Ecclesiae did not indicate the reason for choosing to erect new dioceses rather than to restore the old. The main factor is likely to have been the law enacted under King George IV in 1829,This law is cited as 10 George IV c. 10 (cf. English law#Citation style). which \\"forbade the use of the old titles, except by the clergy of the Protestant Church by law established\\". Report of the House of Commons Select Committee on Ecclesiastical Titles and Roman Catholic Relief Acts, 2 August 1867, p. 85 John Henry Newman declared: \\"A second temple rises on the ruins of the old. Canterbury has gone its way, and York is gone, and Durham is gone, and Winchester is gone. It was sore to part with them. We clung to the vision of past greatness, and would not believe it could come to nought; but the Church in England has died, and the Church lives again. Westminster and Nottingham, Beverley and Hexham, Northampton and Shrewsbury, if the world lasts, shall be names as musical to the ear, as stirring to the heart, as the glories we have lost; and Saints shall rise out of them if God so will, and Doctors once again shall give the law to Israel, and Preachers call to penance and to justice, as at the beginning.\\" In contrast with what was done in England and Wales, when in 1878 the normal Catholic hierarchy was reestablished in Scotland, where the established Reformed Church did not maintain an episcopate, the old dioceses were reestablished, Until then, Catholics in Scotland were, as in England and Wales, under the pastoral care of vicars apostolic. The first apostolic vicar for Scotland was appointed in 1694, and the country was divided into two vicariates in 1727, the Lowlands District and the Highlands District, which became three vicariates in 1827, Eastern, Western and Northern. In Ireland, the Catholic Church maintained without break the succession in the old sees, with a parallel succession claimed, with government support, by the Church of Ireland. Reaction In his first pastoral letter as Archbishop of Westminster, Wiseman wrote a sentence often quoted later, \\"Catholic England has been restored to its orbit in the ecclesiastical firmament\\". =Anti-Catholic reaction= Publication of the bull was met with an outburst of hostility. The Reformation Journal published an article under the heading \\"The Blight of Popery\\". \\"No Popery\\" processions were held all over England, and windows of Catholic churches were broken.Anthony S. Wohl, The Re-establishment of the Catholic Hierarchy in England, 1850 Guy Fawkes night proved to be a focal point for anger as demonstrated by the burnings of effigies of the new Archbishop Wiseman and the pope. At Farringdon Market 14 effigies were processed from the Strand and over Westminster Bridge to Southwark, while extensive demonstrations were held throughout the suburbs of London. Effigies of the twelve new English Catholic bishops were paraded through Exeter, already the scene of severe public disorder on each anniversary of the Fifth. Joseph Drew of Weymouth responded with strong criticism in his essay Popery against the Pope, an Appeal to Protestants and in his satirical verses The Vision of the Pope; or A Snooze in the Vatican, both published in 1851. Lord John Russell, the Prime Minister, published a letter protesting against the insolence of the \\"Papal Aggression\\". Parliament passed the Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851, making it a criminal offence for anyone outside the \\"united Church of England and Ireland\\" to use any episcopal title \\"of any city, town or place, or of any territory or district (under any designation or description whatsoever), in the United Kingdom\\". However, this law remained a dead letter and was repealed 20 years later. Subsequent adjustments In 1861 the name of the Hexham diocese was changed to Hexham and Newcastle. In 1878 Beverley was divided into the two new dioceses, that of Leeds and that of Middlesbrough, the original diocese becoming extinct. The Diocese of Portsmouth was formed in 1882 by the division of the Diocese of Southwark into the Dioceses of Southwark and Portsmouth. In 1895 the Diocese of Newport and Menevia was divided into the Diocese of Newport (later becoming, in 1916, the Archdiocese of Cardiff) and that of Menevia. =Three ecclesiastical provinces= Thus, the metropolitan Diocese of Westminster came to have fifteen suffragan sees, the largest number in the world. Accordingly, by the Apostolic Letter Si qua est of 28 October 1911, Pope Pius X erected the new provinces of Birmingham and Liverpool, making these two dioceses metropolitan archdioceses. There remained under Westminster the suffragan sees of Northampton, Nottingham, Portsmouth, and Southwark; to Birmingham were assigned those of Clifton, Newport, Plymouth, Shrewsbury, and Menevia; and to Liverpool, Hexham and Newcastle, Leeds, Middlesbrough, and Salford. It had for many years been felt that a division was necessary, but there had always been the fear of causing disunion thereby, especially if, as in pre-Reformation times, the division would be between north and south. This was obviated by ignoring the precedent of York and Canterbury, and arranging for three instead of two provinces. Under the new Apostolic Constitution, the Archbishop of Westminster was granted the right to \\"be permanent chairman of the meetings of the Bishops of all England and Wales, and for this reason it will be for him to summon these meetings and to preside over them, according to the rules in force in Italy and elsewhere.\\" He ranks over the other two archbishops. Instead of the natural geographical division into a northern, a midland, and a southern province, formed by drawing a line from the Humber to the River Mersey, and another from The Wash to the Bristol Channel, the Westminster or eastern province and the Birmingham or western province reach from the south-east and south-west to the Humber and Mersey respectively. In this way the northern province is contiguous to both the other two, bringing all three into closer intercommunication. In pre-Reformation times, an attempt was made in 787 to have a third English province, roughly covering the Anglo- Saxon kingdom of Mercia, with a metropolitan see at Lichfield, but in 803 this was abandoned and the bishops of central England were again made subject to Canterbury. Notes : Joseph William Hendren O.F.M. was actually the first bishop of Clifton but after less than a year he was made bishop of Nottingham.

The worm has a short abdominal region and a slightly broader thorax terminating in colourless tentacles, used to filter food from the water. One of the tentacles is slightly larger than the rest and shaped like a saucer, which is used as an operculum. This seals the opening of the shell and serves to protect the worm from predators and desiccation when out of water. It lives primarily on the red algae Corallina officinalis, after which it takes its name, but is also known to live on Irish Moss (Chondrus crispus). The shell is often confused with the white growing tips of Corallina fronds. The Spirorbis genus are cross fertilising hermaphrodites, who brood their young in a tube attached to the worm inside the shell. The larvae are released at an advanced stage of development and spend just a few hours as free-living organisms before attaching themselves to the nearest suitable surface, often the same seaweed as the parent.

It was unusual in that it did not serve any community, being simply an interchange. Forty years following closure, East Midlands Parkway railway station was opened for functionally similar purposes. The complex network of tracks in this area is popularly known as Trent Junction, though strictly this was the junction of the Derby and the Leicester line at the south of the triangular layout, later renamed Trent South. It was built in 1839 by the Midland Counties Railway which linked Derby and Nottingham with Leicester and thence to London St Pancras. Other individual junctions within the complex are Attenborough Junction, Sheet Stores Junction, Toton Centre, Toton East, Trent East (now just Trent) and Trent South. Additionally the Meadow Lane, South Erewash/Trent Station North, Sawley Junction and Platt's Crossing components were removed when those sections of line disappeared. Immediately to the south-west is Trent Lock, a four-way junction on the British canal system, linking the River Soar and Erewash Canal to the River Trent, and leading to the Trent and Mersey Canal. History Between 1847 and 1862, the Midland built a line from Chesterfield (now known as the Erewash Valley Line - pronounced Error-wash). This had a curve to join the northbound line towards Nottingham, but crossed the Derby- Nottingham curve on the level at Platt's Crossing to meet the southbound line. At this time passengers from Nottingham travelled to Derby before heading for London, an round trip. Trent Station was built in 1862 as an island platform, in typical \\"Midland Gothic\\" style, on the Nottingham-Leicester arm. Through its century long existence it barely changed - even retaining the gas lighting. Platt's Crossing was removed and the Derby line brought round in a sharp curve to enter the station from the north. This curve was so tight that it was said that passengers in the leading coaches could see the tail of their own train. At the same time a curve was built from the south of the station on to the Derby line. It was particularly remarkable in that, although there was an up and a down platform, trains for a given destination might face in either direction. There is a famous comment by Sir Edmund Beckett:Kingscott, G., (2006) Last Train from Trent Station Newbury: Countryside Books You arrive at Trent. Where that is I cannot tell. I suppose it is somewhere near the River Trent; but then the Trent is a very long river. You get out of the train to obtain refreshment, and having taken it, you endeavour to find your train and your carriage. But whether it is on this side or that, and whether it is going north or south, this way or that way, you cannot tell. Bewildered, you frantically rush into your carriage; the train moves off around a curve, and then you are horrified to see some red lights glaring in front of you, and you are in immediate expectation of a collision, when your fellow passenger calms your fears by telling you that they are only the tail lamps of your own train! In 1869 a further line was built from Sawley, from what was known as Sheet Stores Junction, to Stenson which allowed trains for the West Midlands to bypass Derby. On 13 August 1886 lightning struck a chimney stack. The stone coping and brickwork fell through the glass roof doing considerable damage. Many passengers were on the platform, but no one was injured. Goods traffic increased to such an extent that, in 1893, the quadruple track was extended from Ratcliffe to Trent across Trent Viaducts and through a second Red Hill Tunnel and, with the growth of the sidings at Toton, the goods line was taken at high level over the Nottingham line in 1901. Through the early part of the 20th century, the station was an important changing point for a variety of local services. In addition the Erewash Valley was used by expresses from London to Leeds and the north, such as the Thames-Clyde Express, which first ran as a named train in 1927. Some of the Nottingham expresses instead used the line through Melton Mowbray and Corby, which opened to Kettering in 1880. Derby continued to handle the services from London to Manchester along what is now the Derwent Valley Line, some of which bypassed Trent due to the difficulty of negotiating the North Curve. A Down empties from the Derby/Burton direction passes Trent Station South Box in 1965 On 22 September 1920 a collision occurred at 4.40am. A goods train from Derby to Nottingham was passing down the outside line and another goods train from Leicester to Nottingham was passing down the platform line. Both lines converged at the junction, and this is where the trains met. No one was injured but 10 freight wagons were derailed and damaged. Passenger services to Long Eaton were worked on the single line until the wagons were rerailed and traffic restored around 11.00 am. On 1 December 1930 the LMS Manchester to Yarmouth express derailed at the station when 5 coaches left the rails, destroying of permanent way. After the station closed on 1 January 1968, Trevor Park MP for South East Derbyshire raised a complaint to Sir Edmund Compton, Parliamentary Commissioner. By the time the commissioner had made a ruling in September 1968, the station had already been demolished. The North Curve was also removed, in spite of much local opposition. The route of Fields Farm Road now uses the trackbed of the former curve. The name Trent remains however, perpetuated on the Power Signal Box built in 1969. =Stationmasters= *George Henderson Smart ca. 1864 *E. Laty 1876 - 1880 *W.

The First Great Migration occurred during the Habsburg-Ottoman War (1683-1699) under Serbian Patriarch Arsenije III Crnojeviƒá as a result of the Habsburg retreat and the Ottoman reoccupation of southern Serbian regions, which were temporarily held by the Habsburgs between 1688 and 1690. The Second Great Migration took place during the Habsburg-Ottoman War (1737-1739), under the Serbian Patriarch Arsenije IV Jovanoviƒá, also parallel with the Habsburg withdrawal from Serbian regions; between 1718 and 1739, they were known as the Kingdom of Serbia. The masses of earlier migrations from the Ottoman Empire are considered ethnically Serb, and those of the First Great Migration nationally Serb. The First Great Migration brought the definitive indicator of Serbianness, Orthodox Christianity and its leader, the patriarch. Background Some Serbian historians, citing a document issued by Emperor Leopold I in 1690, claim that the masses were \\"invited\\" to come to Hungary. The original text in Latin shows that Serbs were actually advised to rise up against the Ottomans and \\"not to desert\\" their ancestral lands. First migration Arsenije III, leader of the First Great Serb Migration Main territory settled by Serbs during the Great Serb migration in 1690 (represented with blue colour) Serbs crossing the river for Austrian territory. Arsenije IV, leader of the Second Great Serb Migration Confirmation of Serbian Privileges, issued by Maria Theresa in 1743 During the Austro-Turkish war (1683‚Äì1699) relations between Muslims and Christians in the European provinces of the Ottoman Empire were extremely radicalized. As a result of the lost rebellion and suppression, Serbian Christians and their church leaders, headed by Serbian Patriarch Arsenije III sided with the Austrians in 1689. Albanian Catholics were also part of the exodus. They settled mainly in the southern parts of the Kingdom of Hungary. The most important cities and places they settled are Szentendre, Buda, Moh√°cs, P√©cs, Szeged, Baja, Tokaj, Oradea, Debrecen, Kecskem√©t, Szatm√°r.Maro≈° Melich√°rek, 2017, Great migration of the Serbs (1690) and its reflections in modern historiography, https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/55351257/367693013-.pdf?response- content- disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DGREAT_MIGRATION_OF_THE_SERBS_1690_AND_IT.pdf&X-Amz- Algorithm;=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz- Credential;=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20200206%2Fus- east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date;=20200206T174437Z&X-Amz- Expires;=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders;=host&X-Amz- Signature;=b08c45a63511e2fe7a409644cb1c39054fcc011e805068d1e52f611a0e74154e#page=88 In 1690, Emperor Leopold I allowed the refugees gathered on the banks of the Sava and Danube in Belgrade to cross the rivers and settle in the Habsburg Monarchy. He recognized Patriarch Arsenije III ƒåarnojeviƒá as their spiritual leader. The Emperor had recognized the Patriarch as deputy-voivode (civil leader of the migrants), which over time developed into the etymology of the northern Serbian province of Vojvodina (this origin of the name of Vojvodina is related to the fact that patriarch Arsenije III and subsequent religious leaders of Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy had jurisdiction over all Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy, including Serbs of Vojvodina, and that Serbs of Vojvodina accepted the idea of a separate Serbian voivodeship in this area, which they managed to create in 1848). In 1694, Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor appointed Arsenije III ƒåarnojeviƒá as the head of the newly established Orthodox Church in the Monarchy. The patriarchal right of succession was secured by the May Assembly of the Serbian people in Karlovci in 1848, following the proclamation of Serbian Vojvodina during the Serbian revolution in Habsburg lands 1848‚Äì49. Serbs received privileges from the Emperor, which guaranteed them national and religious singularity, as well as a corpus of rights and freedoms in the Habsburg Monarchy. Second migration The breakout of the Habsburg-Ottoman War (1737-1739) triggered the Second Great Migration of the Serbs. In 1737, at the very beginning of the war, Serbian Patriarch Arsenije IV Jovanoviƒá sided with Habsburgs and supported the rebellion of Serbs in the region of Ra≈°ka against Ottomans. During the war, Habsburg armies and the Serbian Militia failed to achieve substantial success, and subsequently were forced to retreat. By 1739, entire territory of the Habsburg Kingdom of Serbia was lost to Ottomans. During the war, large portion of the Christian population from the region of Ra≈°ka and other Serbian lands migrated towards the north, following the retreat of Habsburg armies and the Serbian Militia. They settled mainly in Syrmia and neighbouring regions, within the borders of the Habsburg Monarchy. Among them were also the Catholic Albanian tribe Klimente, which settled in three villages in Syrmia. Number of migrants Sources provide different data regarding the number of people in the first migration, referring to the group led by Patriarch Arsenije III: * 37,000 families into Habsburg Monarchy, according to a manuscript at ≈†i≈°atovac monastery written by monk Stefan of Ravanica 28 years after the first wave.Stanojevic, Ljubomir. (ed) Stari srpski zapisi i natpisi, vol 3, Beograd 1905, 94, no 5283: \\"37000 familija\\" * 37,000 families, according to a book by Pavle Julinac, printed in 1765.Pavle Julinac, Kratkoie vredeniie v istoriiu proikhozhdeniia slaveno-serbskago naroda. Venetiis 1765 (ed. Miroslav Pantic, Belgrade, 1981), p. 156: numbers derived from an official Imperial report to Vienna. * 37,000 families led by the Patriarch, according to Jovan Rajiƒá, published in 1794‚Äì95.Jovan Rajiƒá, Istoriia raznikh slavenskikh narodov, naipache Bolgar, Khorvatov, i Serbov, vol 4, 1795, p. 135: \\"37000 familii Serbskikh s Patriarkhom * 37,000 families led by the Patriarch, according to Johann Engel, published 1801.Engel, Johann Christian von, Geschichte des ungrischen Reichs und seiner Nebenl√§nder, vol. 3. Halle 1801, 485: \\"37000 Serwische Familien, mit ihrem Patriarchen\\" * √âmile Picot concluded that it was 35,000 to 40,000 families, between 400,000 and 500,000 people. \\"It is a constant tradition that this population is counted by families, not by heads\\" also insisting that these were large extended families (see Zadruga).A.E. Picot, Les Serbes de Hongrie, 1873, p. 75 * The Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences, supports the figure of 37,000 families. * Tatjana Popoviƒá, cites as many as 60,000 Serbian migrant families for the First Serbian migration alone. * At least 30,000 people, according to Stevan K. Pavlowitch. * 20,000‚Äì30,000 people, according to \\"Teatri europei\\".Aleksandar Protiƒá, Jo≈° koja o istom, Seoba u sporovima, Novi Sad, 1991, page 91. * According to Noel Malcolm, two statements from Arsenije survive. In 1690 he wrote \\"more than 30,000 souls\\", and six years later he wrote that it was \\"more than 40,000 souls\\".Two written statements by Arsenije survive, specifying the number of people: at the end of 1690 he gave it as \\"more than 30,000 souls\\", and six years later he wrote that it was \\"more than 40,000 souls\\". These are the most authoritative statements we have... Noel Malcolm: Albanische Geschichte: Stand und Perspektiven der Forschung; by Eva Anne Frantz. p. 238 Malcolm also cites Cardinal Leopold Karl von Kollonitsch's statement from 1703 of more than 60,000 people led by the Patriarch from Belgrade to the Kingdom of Hungary, a figure Malcolm claims Kollonich may have been inclined to exaggerate. According to Noel Malcolm, data that state that 37,000 families participated in this migration derive from a single source: a Serbian monastic chronicle which was written many years after the event and contains several other errors.Noel Malcolm, Kosovo - a short history, Pan Books, London, 2002, page 161. * According to Sima ƒÜirkoviƒá, the figure of 40,000 people is an exaggeration. He says that there is no testimony other than those of the Patriarch for a more reliable estimate. *Mikael Antoloviƒá studied articles by Ilarion Ruvarac who claimed that between 70,000 and 80,000 refugees left Kosovo during the migration, while the Serbian public claimed that it was more than half a million, and that the majority fled due to \\"fear of Ottoman vengeance\\". *Other historians state that only a few thousand refugees left during this time. Aftermath Serbs from these migrations settled in the southern parts of the Hungary (though as far in the north as the town of Szentendre, in which they formed the majority of population in the 18th century, but to smaller extent also in the town of Kom√°rom) and Croatia. The large Serb migrations from Balkans to the Pannonian plain started in the 14th century and lasted until the end of the 18th century. The great migrations from 1690 and 1737‚Äì39 were the largest ones and were important reason for issuing the privileges that regulated the status of Serbs within Habsburg Monarchy. The Serbs that in these migrations settled in Vojvodina, Slavonia and the parts belonging to the Military Frontierhttps://ww1.habsburger.net/en/chapters/serbs-habsburg- monarchy#:~:text=In%201910%20the%20Serbs%20were,enjoy%20an%20absolute%20majority%20anywhere. increased (partly) the existing Serb population in these regions and made the Serbs an important political factor in the Habsburg Monarchy over time. The masses of earlier migrations from the Ottoman Empire are considered ethnically Serb, while those of the First Great Migration nationally Serb. The First Great Migration brought the definitive indicator of Serbianness, Orthodox Christianity and its leader, the patriarch. Modern analysis The narrative about the migration is part of the Serbian identity narratives. It is a national-religious myth with a heroic theme. Frederic Anscombe suggests that it, together with other narratives of the Kosovo myth, form the basis of Serbian nationalism and have fueled the conflicts. According to Frederick Anscombe, the Great Migration reconciles romantic national history with late modern reality, portraying Albanians of Kosovo as descendants of Ottoman- sponsored transplants who settled after the expulsion of the Serb population and supposedly took over the control of the territory,Melich√°rek, 2017, (p.93) thus replaying of a \\"second Battle of Kosovo\\" and continual struggle for freedom. Malcolm and Elsie state that various migrations took place because of the War of the Holy League (1683-1699), when thousands of refugees found shelter on the new Habsburg border.Anscombe, ibid. Saggau states that the modern adaptation and popularisation of the migration retrieves inspiration from Vuk Karad≈æiƒá and Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈°, and prior to this, had not yet become a component of Serb national identity. According to Maro≈° Melich√°rek, the migration has also been depicted with Serbian national symbolism. The famous painting by Paja Jovanoviƒá, commissioned in 1896 by Patriarch Georgije Brankoviƒá was compared with notable American painting by Emanuel Leutze Washington Crossing the Delaware. The depiction and symbolism of Great Serbian migration is still very strong and up-to-date. History professor Maro≈° Melich√°rek mentions that other comparisons were made of the Great Migrations, such as to the Great Retreat and a photo of Serbs fleeing from Republika Srpska Krajina. Among the refugees that moved to Austrian-dominated territories at the time there was also a substantial number of Albanians, both Eastern Orthodox and Catholic. The topic of the Great Migrations is a source of disputes between some Serbian and Albanian historians, with each side having its viewpoint. Istv√°n De√°k from the University of Colombia states that Serbs, who were somewhat better educated than the Albanians, were willing to move in search of better economic opportunities, which helped demographic changes in the territory of Kosovo throughout the centuries.

Its main business was the freight coming from the local farms and dairy products from the Decker-Slawson Creamery, which later became the Sheffield Farms Creamery. It also served the nearby community of Prattsville. For a time Grand Gorge was the site of great activity when the construction of the Schenectady and Margaretville Railroad was attempted. Special sidings were built for contractors and a large volume of equipment and supplies were delivered to commence construction. Hundreds of Italian laborers recruited from New York City were set to work grading the new line. Unfortunately, the money soon ran out, the workers were not paid and the whole project collapsed. Many of the laborers walked back to New York City following the tracks on which they had arrived. Evidence of the grading can still be seen today along the valley from Grand Gorge down to Prattsville. The original station at Grand Gorge was one of the old board-and-batten Rondout and Oswego stations. However, this station was razed by fire in the 1890s, and was replaced with a more traditional station. However, this station was abandoned in 1954, with the end of passenger service on the U&D.; It was eventually so deteriorated, that the Penn Central tore it down in the late 1950s in fear that someone could get hurt. The station was located at the intersection of New York Route 30 and Ferris Hill Road.

Armenia 75px The Grand Lodge of Armenia is a national organization, supervising Freemasonry in Armenia. It was consecrated in 2002 by representatives of the Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia, the Grande Loge Nationale Fran√ßaise and the Grand Lodge of Russia. The Grand Lodge of Armenia is recognised by the United Grand Lodge of England. China Freemasonry in China is outlawed by the Chinese Communist Party. The Grand Lodge of China (in Taiwan) was founded in 1949, it has 10 lodges with 750 members and is recognised by the United Grand Lodge of England. India Freemasonry was introduced to India in the 1730s by the English. The fraternity remained under the jurisdiction of the United Grand Lodge of England through the colonial era. An independent Grand Lodge of India was founded in 1961. As of February 2011, it has 370 lodges spread across India with more than 14,900 members and is recognised by UGLE. The Confederation of United Grand Lodges of India was founded in 2001 and is recognised by the Grand Lodge of Belgium. Iran The first Persian contact with freemasonry dates back to the 19th century during the Qajar period.http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/freemasonry-ii-in-the-qajar- period The Grand Lodge of Iran, established in 1969 in Tehran, existed in the country prior to the Islamic Revolution of 1979, hosted membership from various political figures, including former prime minister Jafar Sharif-Emami (who served as the lodge's grand master at one point), and branched to 43 Lodges and at least 1,035 members. Since the Revolution, Freemasonry has been banned in Iran; a \\"Grand Lodge of Iran in Exile\\" is currently established in Los Angeles, where the local Grand Lodge approved its practice in 1985. Israel The Grand Lodge of the State of Israel was founded in 1953, it has 53 lodges with 2000 members and is recognised by the United Grand Lodge of England. Le Droit Humain also has an Israeli jurisdiction founded in 1989. Japan Freemasonry in Japan first began with the opening of trade with foreign countries occasioned by Commodore Perry's Black Ships in 1866. Prior to World War II, several Grand Lodges had subordinate Lodges there, including those of England, Ireland, and Scotland. Most went dark as the war loomed. After World War II, the Grand Lodge of the Philippines charted new Lodges throughout the country.Peck, Nohea. Masonry in Japan: The First One Hundred Years, 1866-1966. Kodansha, 1966. General MacArthur, commander of US forces occupying Japan, a mason himself, supported the creation of several Lodges. The Grand Lodge of Japan was founded in 1957, it has 18 lodges with 2500 members and is recognised by the United Grand Lodge of England. Le Droit Humain has a lodge in Tokyo, the lodge \\"Soleil Levant\\" founded in 2008 and working at the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite in French. Korea In late 1907 and early 1908 a number of Freemasons then residing in Korea undertook to establish the first Masonic Lodge on the Peninsula. A Charter was issued by the Grand Lodge of Scotland on November 5, 1908, and the name Han Yang, one of the ancient names for the capital city, was chosen to designate the new Lodge. The members were initially merchants, miners, and missionaries from Lodge Hyogo and Osaka 498 in Japan; occupations that represented most of the foreign population in what was then known as Chosun. In addition to Lodge Han Yang, there are two other Scottish lodges on the Korean Peninsula: Lodge Pusan and Lodge Harry S. Truman #1727 https://trumanlodge1727.com/namesake/ in Pyeongtaek (on the roll of the Grand Lodge of Scotland). In December 1978 a letter was sent to facilitate Truman Lodge, and began as such, \\"Sixteen Master Masons, all members of the US Uniformed services or US civilian component thereof, have petitioned Lodge Han Yang 1048 and Pusan Lodge 1675, for support for the formation of a lodge in or in the immediate vicinity of (US) Osan Air Force Base located in the city of Songtan Up some 45 miles south of Seoul. There are reportedly some 30 Brn. additionally, who have indicated a keen interest in the formation of the lodge and who will lend their support.\\" Similarly, MacArthur Lodge (under the jurisdiction of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of the Philippines). MacArthur Lodge currently holds meetings on the United States military base located within Seoul. Furthermore, numerous Prince Hall Freemasonry Lodges from the MWPHGL of Washington and Jurisdiction (and other PHA Grand Lodges) meet on various United States military bases throughout the country, including II Corinthians #96 at USAG Yongsan in Seoul, Sprig of Acacia #93 at Camp Casey, and Billy G. Miller #43 (MWPHGL Oklahoma) at Camp Humphreys. Lebanon There are a number of different Grand Lodges and Grand Orients in Lebanon.Layiktez, Cecil Freemasonry in the Islamic World Pietre-Stones Review of Freemasonry 1996 Irregular Grand Lodges include the King Solomon Grand Lodge of Lebanon , Sun Grand Lodge (SGL) ,Grand Orient de Canaan the Grande Loge Centrale du Liban, the Grande Loge de C√®dres, the Grand Orient Arabe, and the Grande Loge Bet-El, all in the tradition of Continental Freemasonry. There are also UGLE recognised lodges active in Lebanon operating under the Grand District of Lebanon, under the Grand Lodge of Scotland and two lodges under the Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia. On 24 October 2018, the Grand Lodge of New York created the independent Grand Lodge of the Free and Accepted Masons of Lebanon.https://nymasons.org/site/the-grand-lodge-of- lebanon/ Malaysia Jesselton Freemason Hall in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. Freemasonry started in Malaysia 180 years ago and was first established on the island of Penang. There are freemason lodges in all states in Malaysia except Terengganu, Kelantan and Perlis. The largest freemason lodge in Malaysia is located in Bukit Jalil. Pakistan Masonic Temple (Lahore) Freemasonry was introduced to Pakistan during the era of the British empire. Masonic organisations continued in the country until they were completely ousted in 1972 by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and again by Zia-ul-Haq in 1983. The Sindh Wildlife Conservation building in Saddar, Karachi, served as a Masonic hall until it was taken over by the government. The Masonic Temple in Lahore, built in 1860, has been renamed to Mason Hall and is today used as a multi-purpose government building by the Government of Punjab. Philippines The Grand Lodge of the Philippines was founded in 1912, it has 360 lodges with 16 500 members and is recognised by the United Grand Lodge of England. It had a pivotal role in the reestablishment of Freemasonry in Japan after World War II. Sri Lanka Freemasonry was introduced in Ceylon by the British in the early 1800s. Currently there are ten English Lodges, two Scottish Lodges and four Irish Lodges in Sri Lanka. Most are based at the Victoria Masonic Temple at Galle Face, Colombo while others are based at the Kandy Masonic Temple in Kandy; the New Masonic Temple in Nuwara Eliya and the Masonic Temple of Kurunegala. Thailand After several rocky starts, Lodge St John (Scottish Constitution) was founded in Bangkok on January 24, 1911. One century later there are lodges from the United Grand Lodge of England, Grand Lodge of Ireland, Grand Lodge of Scotland, Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Delaware, Grand Orient of the Netherlands, National Grand Lodge of France (GLNF) and the Grand Lodge of France (GLdF). Lodges from GLdF are not recognized by the other lodges in the kingdom. Turkey In Turkey Freemasonry was introduced by foreign merchants in the eighteenth century (1721) and was outlawed by Mahmud I in 1748, although it slowly came back and Freemasons were exiled as part of a crackdown on the Bektashis in 1826. A Grand Orient was formed in 1909. Freemasonry was suppressed from 1935 to 1948. A schism occurred in 1964, with a small group of freemasons creating the Grand Lodge of Liberal Freemasons of Turkey, which later attached itself to the Grand Orient de France References  External links  * Grand Lodge of Armenia * Grand Lodge of Japan * The Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of F. & A.M. of the Philippines Asia ","title":"Freemasonry in Asia"},{"id":"4970393","text":"George Dennis (21 July 1814 in Ash Grove, Hackney, Middlesex ‚Äì 15 November 1898 in South Kensington, London) was a British explorer of Etruria; his written account and drawings of the ancient places and monuments of the Etruscan civilization combined with his summary of the ancient sources is among the first of the modern era and remains an indispensable reference in Etruscan studies.  Early life  George Dennis left school at the age of 15. He never went to college, and yet he interested himself in languages, studying ancient Greek and Latin on his own and eventually becoming a polyglot in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, modern Greek, Turkish and some Arabic. A strongly physical man as well, he often went for 40-mile hikes in the uplands of Scotland and Wales. He resolved to become an explorer; however, he worked mainly alone.Wellard dedicates Chapter Four, The Founder of English Etruscology, to Dennis. This material comes from there.  Solitary Explorer  At age 22 Dennis conducted his first explorations in Portugal and Spain, writing his first work, A Summer in Andalucia, in 1839. Dennis roughed it in Etruria between 1842, at age 28, and 1847, in the company of artist Samuel Ainsley in three separate trips from 1842 to 1844. Etruria of the times had reverted to a semi-wilderness state, rural, depopulated, malarial and infested with bandits. There were few roads. Dennis hiked about the country living in the outdoors or in rural quarters infested with insects studying and recording the monuments he found and any traditions about them. The result of his travels was his 1,085 page treatise Cities and cemeteries of Etruria, published in 1848 by the British Museum and including sketches by Dennis and Ainsley. Dennis captures Etruscan civilization and Tuscan landscapes in able prose with scholarly detail. It was nevertheless generally unknown and unappreciated by the British public, partly because of Dennis' lack of academic credentials. He did make some fast friends among the academics who read his work, such as Austen Henry Layard.  Colonial officer  As his book did not receive the recognition and remuneration it deserves, George used his contacts to obtain work with the Colonial Service, which shipped him off to British Guiana. He married there but he found life dreary. After 14 years he asked his friend Austen Henry Layard to mediate with Lord John Russell to get him out of Guiana. The ploy was successful and in 1863, at age 50, Dennis went as vice-consul to Sicily, subsequently to Benghazi and Smyrna in Turkey, accompanied by his wife. He had no children.  Recognition  Meanwhile, his magnum opus became widely read and was appreciated for the masterpiece it is. Oxford University awarded him an honorary Doctorate of Civil Law for it. He was made a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. His lack of a formal education was a stigma that prevented higher honors. He endured shallow reviews and comments for the rest of his life.  End  George Dennis died alone in London at age 84 officially of \\"senile decay.\\" At some time before his death second and third editions of his work had come out.

He was one of the early defenders of Cubism, with Guillaume Apollinaire and Maurice Raynal.  Biography  Andr√© Salmon was born in Paris, in the XI arrondissement, the fourth child of √âmile- Fr√©d√©ric Salmon, a sculptor and etcher, and Sophie-Julie Cattiaux, daughter of a founder of the Radical Socialist party. Often assumed to come from a Jewish family,Peter Y. Medding, Studies in Contemporary Jewry: Volume XIV: Coping with Life and Death: Jewish Families in the Twentieth Century, Oxford University Press (1999), p. 313 they were in fact secular Republicans, frequently in financial difficulty, and moved several times. Andr√© Salmon claimed in a letter to the editor of Le Crapouillot, now in a private collection, that his family descended from the Renaissance poet Jean Salmon Macrin, whose position in the court of Francis I surely indicated that his forebearers were not Jewish. Salmon's education was neglected, although he received some tuition from the Parnassian poet Gaston de Raisme, a friend of Fran√ßois Copp√©e. During 1897‚Äì1902 he stayed in St-Petersburg, first with his parents and then as an assistant in the chancellery of the French consulate. In 1902 Salmon returned to France for military service but due to weak physical condition was dismissed after a few months. In the first decade of the 20th century he mixed with literary circles of Paris' Latin Quarter. Then he met a young, then unknown poet Guillaume Apollinaire and with a group of young artists they formed an artistic group. In 1904 he moved into the Bateau- Lavoir and lived there with Picasso, Max Jacob and Apollinaire. For several years he lived a Bohemian life, until he fell in love with Jeanne Blazy- Escarpette. He found work as a journalist with L'Intransigeant and also contributed to Le Soleil. He married Jeanne on 13 July 1909 and settled with her on rue Rousselet in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. Portrait of Salmon by Josette Bournet, c.1947 During World War I (1914‚Äì18) Salmon enlisted in the army as a volunteer and served in the trenches. He was invalided in 1916 and returned to Paris where he became a factotum on the journal L'√âveil of Jacques Dhur. Salmon organized the exhibition L'Art Moderne en France from 16‚Äì31 July 1916 for the wealthy fashion designer Paul Poiret. Salmon gave \\"26 Avenue d'Antin\\" as the address and called the exhibition the \\"Salon d'Antin\\". Artists included Pablo Picasso, who showed Les Demoiselles d'Avignon for the first time, Amedeo Modigliani, Mo√Øse Kisling, Manuel Ortiz de Z√°rate and Marie Vassilieff. Another of Poiret's exhibitions, also organized by Salmon, was La Collection particuli√®re de M. Paul Poiret, from 26 April to 12 May 1923. In the following years Salmon continued to work as a journalist for works such as L'Europe nouvelle and La Paix sociale, while publishing poems, short stories, critiques and essays. From 1928 Salmon worked for Le Petit Parisien as a court reporter. In the 1930s he ran into financial difficulties, while his wife became increasingly dependent on opium. Salmon was sent to Spain by the Petit Parisien to report on the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39) from the Francoist side. His reports, deeply critical of the Fascists, were censored by the paper. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) he was sent to Beirut as a war correspondent. After the fall of France he made his way back via Marseille to Paris, where he found his wife struggling to survive. He rejoined Le Petit Parisien, but avoided any controversial subjects, and was forced to defend himself against attacks from the far Right who accused him of being a Jew and a supporter of \\"degenerate art\\". After the Liberation of France Salmon was sentenced to five years of \\"national indignity\\" for his work as a journalist in occupied France, and had to publish under a pseudonym. His wife died on 1 January 1949. On 29 October 1953 he married again to L√©o, an elegant and lively former mannequin. In November 1961 he moved from Paris to Sanary, where he had built a small house in 1937. In 1964 Salmon was awarded the Grand Prix for poetry by the French Academy. He died on 12 March 1969 at his home in Provence.

He was known as the \\"Iron Master of the Harpeth\\" and the \\"Iron Master of Middle Tennessee\\". Today he is remembered mostly for founding Montgomery Bell Academy, one of the largest private non-sectarian all-boys high schools in the United States. Early life Montgomery Bell was born on January 3, 1769 in Chester County, Pennsylvania. His father, John Bell, was an Irish emigrant to the United States. His mother was Mary Patterson. He was of Scotch-Irish descent on both sides. Bell served a three-year apprenticeship to a tanner and later became a hatmaker with an older brother. At age 20, he left Pennsylvania for Lexington, Kentucky where a widowed older sister lived and opened a hat-making business paying for the education of his sister's children. Career Bell moved to Middle Tennessee and became involved in the iron business purchasing James Robertson's iron works at Cumberland Furnace, Tennessee in 1804 for $16,000. Bell expanded his operations and built other furnaces and mills including a hammer mill south of Charlotte, at Tennessee on Jones Creek using water power. By 1808, Bell was buying wood at 50 cents per cord for charcoal to fuel his Cumberland Furnaces which cast cannonballs used in the War of 1812 by General Andrew Jackson's troops at the Battle of New Orleans. Bell built another forge and hammer mill called \\"Pattison Forge\\" after his mother's maiden name. Bell finished a tunnel approximately 100 yards (91 m) long through a narrow limestone and sandstone ridge from a point seven-miles upstream creating a 4-foot fall to operate his hammers and forge. There had been an earlier plan to shorten the river path for flatboats to ship goods. Bell named another of his iron works \\"Worley Furnace\\" after James Worley, a slave. Bell made the Narrows his operational headquarters and built a home there which he called Bell View. A nearby unincorporated community where many of his workers lived is called Bell Town. Bell suffered losses in the Panic of 1819 and in 1824 he advertised the Narrows and other properties for sale in the Nashville Whig. Bell offered to sell his ironworks to the U.S. Army for an Armory but floods on the Harpeth were well known and that idea failed. Bell sold the ironworks to Anthony Wayne Van Leer, who was a member of a well known historical family in Pennsylvania and noted in the anti-slavery cause. The Narrows property was not sold during Bell's life but much was lost through looting, flooding, and the effects of time. The tunnel remains and part of the Tennessee State Park system. As early as 1835, Bell sent 50 of his freed slaves to Liberia.John F. Baker, The Washingtons of Wessyngton Plantation: Stories of My Family's Journey to Freedom, New York City: Simon and Schuster, 2010, p. 87 In 1853, he sent 50 more of them. He eventually emancipated 150 more of his slaves. Additionally, he hired a teacher from Philadelphia to teach them how to read and write, at a time when this was illegal. Death He died on April 1, 1855 in Dickson County, Tennessee which location became Cheatham County in 1856. He was buried near the Narrows property in a cemetery near his Bell View home Legacy He bequeathed $20,000 toward \\"the education of children not less than ten nor more than fourteen years old who are not able to support and educate themselves and whose parents are not able to do so.\\" This was the foundational grant for the Montgomery Bell Academy in Nashville, Tennessee.

Biography Primatesta was born in Capilla del Se√±or, Exaltaci√≥n de la Cruz, province of Buenos Aires. He was ordained priest in 1942 and elected titular bishop of Tanais and appointed auxiliary bishop of La Plata on June 14, 1957 and became its vicar general. On June 12, 1961 he was appointed first bishop of Diocese of San Rafael, Mendoza, and four years later on February 16, 1965 he became Metropolitan archbishop of C√≥rdoba. Since 1970 he was part of the ruling body of the Argentine Episcopal Conference, which he presided on four occasions. Primatesta was elevated to Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria Addolorata a Piazza Buenos Aires on March 5, 1973 by Pope Paul VI. He participated in the conclaves that elected popes John Paul I and John Paul II in 1978. As required when he turned 75 in 1994 he presented his resignation, but John Paul II accepted it only in 1998. Primatesta continued presiding the Social Pastoral Commission of the Episcopal Conference until 2002. Primatesta suffered from a chronic heart condition. He underwent heart surgery in 1995 and had to have blocks removed from two arteries in January 2005. In April 2005 he had to be hospitalized for two weeks. He died during the first hours of May 1, 2006, at the age of 87, in his private home in C√≥rdoba, after a complication of his cardiovascular condition. His funeral was conducted in the Cathedral of C√≥rdoba, where he was then buried. The provincial government decreed three days of mourning. =Political involvement= Cardinal Primatesta was considered very influential in the internal workings of the Argentine Church and its relationship to the national government. He was linked to top figures of the military dictatorship of the Proceso; after its downfall in 1983 he defended the stance of the Catholic hierarchy at the time, and opposed institutional self-criticism for it, which the Church only started after Primatesta lost his dominant position. Bishop Emeritus of Mor√≥n, Justo Laguna, called Primatesta \\"a man of little commitment\\" (un hombre de jugarse poco) and noted that the Cardinal never took a clear position on the issue of Bishop Enrique Angelelli's murder in 1976. Mar√≠a Elba Mart√≠nez, a human rights advocate and lawyer, stated after the Cardinal's death that \\"Primatesta took a large part of the truth [about the dictatorship] to his grave, mainly about the desaparecidos, the kidnapping of children and the complicity of the ecclesiastic hierarchy with the dictatorship, with the goal of dismembering or weakening the Third World movements of the Second Vatican Council\\". Mart√≠nez further said that Primatesta \\"was useful\\" to the military, and that he had \\"named people\\" for them. During the 1990s, Cardinal Primatesta was a strong critic of the neoliberal policies of President Carlos Menem (1989‚Äì1999), whom he charged with leaving behind a massive amount of poverty. While in charge of the Social Pastoral Commission he asked for a \\"social agreement\\" to overcome the economic crisis of Argentina, and organized discussion meetings for union leaders, businessmen and government representatives. Primatesta mediated also on many social conflicts, including cases where unemployed families took the Cathedral of C√≥rdoba. On a different note, the Cardinal defended the position of the Church on contraception to the point of denouncing C√≥rdoba Governor Ram√≥n Mestre at the top of his voice for a provincial health program that included handing out condoms near the seat of the Archbishopric.

She was the inspiration for many of Eugene O'Neill's stories. Life She was born in New Haven, Connecticut, the daughter of Bridget (n√©e Lundigan) and Thomas Quinlan, both Irish immigrants from County Tipperary. Mary Ellen grew up in a comfortable home in Cleveland, Ohio, where her father prospered as a local businessman and real estate. He first sold stationery supplies, dry goods, candies, tobacco and liquors. Her father did so well that he was able to provide his children with a sound education and music lessons. Mary Ellen attended the Ursuline Academy on Euclid Avenue.Shaughnessy, Edward L., \\"Ella O'Neill and the Imprint of Faith\\", The Eugene O‚ÄôNeill Review, Suffolk University, 1992 At 15, she attended St. Mary's Academy and graduated with honors in music, playing Chopin's Polonaise for piano, op. 22, at the commencement. Shaughnessy, Edward L., \\"Ella, James, and Jamie O'Neill: 'My Name Is Might-Have-Been'\\", The Eugene O‚ÄôNeill Review, Suffolk University, 1991 Ella met James O'Neill at her father's house. Quinlan's store was less than two blocks from the Cleveland Academy of Music, a flourishing hall where the dashing James O'Neill began appearing as early as 1870. Ella developed a crush on the 26-year-old actor. O'Neill left Cleveland for a theater company in Chicago, but met Ella again a few years later. Thomas J. Quinlan died on 25 May 1874 of tuberculosis at age 41. On June 14, 1877, Ella married James in St. Ann's Church on East 12th St. in Manhattan despite her mother's concern that her sheltered and refined daughter would not be happy as the wife of a touring actor.\\"Eugene O'Neill\\", American Experience, PBS Almost immediately Ella had to contend with a lawsuit against her husband from a former mistress who claimed James was the father of her son. The scandal devastated her. Many years later, long after her death, her son Eugene O'Neill, in his play Long Day's Journey Into Night created a character who represents his mother. The character Mary Tyrone bemoans her lonely life: \\"I've never felt at home in the theater. Even though Mr. Tyrone has made me go with him on all his tours, I've had little to do with the people in his company, or with anyone on the stage.\\" Ella was on tour with James in San Francisco when in September 1878, her first son, James, Jr., was born in the house of one of the actor's friends. A second son, Edmund Burke O'Neill was born in 1883 in a St. Louis hotel, the young family again on the circuit. In late winter 1885, Ella left her sons with her mother in New York to join her husband on the road in Denver. While she was away, her older son contracted measles, a highly contagious disease. Edmund then fell ill with the measles and died. Ella blamed James Jr., believing that he purposely exposed his brother to the disease. Ella never got over the guilt she associated with this \\"desertion\\" nor did she ever conquer an irrational resentment toward her first born. Her surviving son was sent to boarding school, and she vowed not to have another child. She did, however, when Eugene was born in October 1888. In October 1888, in order to relieve the pains of the difficult birth of her third son, Eugene Gladstone O'Neill, Ella was administered morphine by the attendant physician. This was the beginning of a longtime addiction to the drug. When he was a teenager, Eugene walked in on his mother giving herself an injection. Later her husband was afraid to leave her alone when they traveled together on tour. He brought her to the theater with him, where she sat in his dressing room in a drug-induced stupor. Early in 1914, Ella went through a cure, and this time remained free for the rest of her life. In April 1919, she underwent a mastectomy for breast cancer.Black, Stephen A., \\"Mrs. O'Neill's Illness\\", New York Theater wire When her husband died in August 1920, Ella handled his financial affairs, selling their cottage in New London, Connecticut, which was the setting for Long Day's Journey into Night. While on a trip to California with her son Jamie, Ella took ill and was diagnosed with a brain tumor. She died on February 28, 1922. In popular culture Ella O'Neill later became the model for Mary Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's final work Long Day's Journey Into Night, which tells the story of the Tyrone family, who closely resemble the members of Eugene's family. This character says the famous line \\"Something I need terribly. I remember when I had it I was never lonely nor afraid. I can't have lost it forever, I would die if I thought that.

Happy-go-lucky Tony tries to carve himself a successful business and steady home for his family, but nothing he does is ever good enough for his nagging wife. Storylines Trinidadian born Tony is married to his second wife, Hannah Carpenter (Sally Sagoe), with whom he has two children, Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford) and Cassie Carpenter (Delanie Forbes). However, Tony and Hannah are separated and Hannah is in a relationship with another man. Kelvin lives with Tony, while Cassie stays with Hannah. Tony has various altercations with the local villain Nick Cotton (John Altman), and is understandably furious when he discovers that Nick has joined a racist organisation. After Nick taunts Kelvin about the colour of his skin, Tony teaches him a lesson, which at least manages to scare him out of spreading his racial hatred for a while. In February 1985, Tony secures himself a job renovating The Queen Victoria public house and gives the unemployed Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) a job as his aid. It is whilst he is working here that Tony gains the interest of the married landlady Angie Watts (Anita Dobson). Angie has grown tired of her cheating husband, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), and whilst he is on a holiday in Spain with his mistress, Angie seduces Tony and they embark on an affair. Tony takes the relationship seriously, but Angie is only using him to get back at Den and make him jealous. The affair is conducted in secret, but after Angie initiates a kiss in The Queen Vic with Tony, she is caught by her adoptive daughter, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean). Angie is forced to use bribery to keep her daughter from informing her husband. Upon Den's return, Angie calls off the affair but it is not long before Sharon tells her father that Angie has been unfaithful. However, Den cares more about his reputation than her and tells her that he does not care about the affair, so long as it is done discreetly. Tony is very hurt by the whole ordeal, but he is even more concerned for his own safety, should Den find out that it was him his wife was seeing. Tony's identity is never disclosed to Den, though Den later works it out. Later, Hannah arrives at Tony's house with the disturbing news that her new lover, Neville Agard (Gordon Case), had been beating both her and their daughter Cassie. Tony is furious and promptly confronts Neville, returning later with Hannah and Cassie's belongings and a cut lip. Tony and Hannah reunite and she and Cassie move in, however, Tony is confused when Hannah wants to live in the flat above Tony's instead of with him. Problems still persist, however, and Hannah regularly nags Tony and makes it clear to him that Walford is not good enough for her. Things reach a climax when Tony hits Mehmet Osman (Haluk Bilginer) the following year for making a pass at Hannah. Hannah is furious and cannot condone Tony's violent actions. Hannah subsequently decides that the marriage is over and she leaves Walford to live with her sister. Tony spends the rest of the year doing odd-jobs and driving a car for Ali Osman's (Nejdet Salih) cab firm. He gets himself into trouble when he buys some stolen silverware from Nick, who later tries to blackmail him. Tony tires of life in Walford and a few months later he departs Albert Square for Trinidad, leaving Kelvin in charge of his property.  Character creation and development  Tony Carpenter was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Tony was originally intended to be named Alan, and his son Kelvin Carpenter was originally named Kevin. They were the first black characters to appear in the soap. Black and Asian characters were two ethnic minorities that had previously been under-represented in British soap before EastEnders aired. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with. Additionally, if the programme was to be realistic, it had to reflect the cross-section of society that actually existed in the real location. For these reasons, different sexes, ages, classes, religions and races were all included in the original character line- up. Both Holland and Smith had been at the forefront of the move towards 'integrated casting' in television and had encountered an array of ethnic diversities in the process. Even though the ethnic minority groups were deemed the hardest to research, Holland and Smith called upon their contacts to relay information about their origins and lifestyles and were then able to portray Walford's most recent immigrants more realistically. Tony's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, EastEnders: The Inside Story (In this passage, Tony will be referred to as Alan). :\\"Alan is Caribbean: one of the \\"came here when ten\\" from an idylic life in Trinidad with his gran....A confusing childhood and, at first, he hated England. He felt different, felt coloured, suffered abuse from the white kids...He met Hannah. She was several cuts above him socially. He liked the idea of a \\"princess\\" and she liked the idea of a \\"a bit of rough\\". In the beginning this made their marriage all the more exciting...But he was short on staying power...In and out of jobs...Boredom always setting in early...A constant desire for change at any price...Hannah meanwhile became more and more stubborn...They set themselves on a collision course...Hannah became too housebound, houseproud, too disciplined with the two children, too rigid, not seeing the wood for the trees. Alan became too anarchic, too sleeping-around, too devil-may-care and up-yours, frequently not seeing the wood for the booze...Perhaps if they split, they could find themselves again?...Alan has bought a house in the Square. His sixteen year old son Kevin wants to stay with his dad...How would Alan react to the discovery that Kevin's visiting his mother? How would Kevin react to his father trying to smuggle a woman for the night? And, how would dad react to son doing the same thing? What happens when they're competing for the same woman? As he wants to leave his mark - physically - on the walls of the building, so he wants to leave his mark on his son. Will Kevin take it, or leave it?...The house is the framework. The container...It will change its personality as the owners find theirs...\\" (page 58-59). Alan's name was later changed to Tony following the development of the character of Ali Osman and Holland and Smith decided they couldn't have two male characters with such similar-sounding names. Oscar James, an experienced television and theatre actor, was chosen to play the role. James was physically much bigger than they'd originally had in mind, however they felt that his interpretation of Tony would be expansive and get noticed. They also thought it was a nice idea for father and son to be not only different in ages, but different physical types as well. Storywise it was felt it would be possible to build on this and also give them different attitudes. Tony's storylines mainly centred on his developing relationship with his son, and marital issues with his wife. Before the series began it was decided that Hannah (Tony's wife) plus their other child, would come back into Tony's life for the sake of the family - but not stay around too long because the neighbourhood would appal her. This was eventually recreated on-screen. James had initially been full of praise for the way the team had chosen to depict a black family. However, shortly before he left the series in 1987, he controversially criticised EastEnders and the BBC for not promoting their black or other ethnic minority characters: Tony Carpenter lasted in the show for two years and was the fourth of the original twenty three characters to leave the show after Saeed Jeffery, Andy O'Brien and Debbie Wilkins. Tony returned to Trinidad to search for his roots.

He first appeared in Justice League of America #100‚Äì101 (1972). Originally a villain responsible for the disappearance of the Seven Soldiers of Victory, he has since reappeared as Neh-Buh-Loh, the primary antagonist in the 2005‚Äì2006 mega-series Seven Soldiers by Grant Morrison. Before this reappearance Morrison built up the character's backstory, starting in 1997 with more extensive appearances in JLA: Classified (2005). Fictional character biography The Neh-Buh-Loh is in fact the adult version of a sentient universe called Qwewq. He first appeared as the Nebula Man in Justice League of America #100, described as a cosmic being \\"whose touch has the power of 20 atomic bombs\\". He was supposedly created by a villain known as The Hand to defeat the original Seven Soldiers of Victory (a later retcon would give him his current origin, with The Hand's involvement being more incidental). He battled the Soldiers in Tibet. His actions scattered the Soldiers through time, a fate from which they were later saved by the Justice League and Justice Society. The Nebula Man was defeated when the sidekick of the Crimson Avenger, Wing, sacrificed himself to deliver the final blow with a cosmic device, he was buried in Tibet by Monks who witnessed his death. During the JLA storyline \\"Rock of Ages\\", the Flash, Aquaman, and Green Lantern are sent by Metron through time and space and they land on Wonderworld. During a brief tour of Wonderworld's Omnitropolis and its museum district by that world's Atom analogue Mote, a few peculiar items are mentioned. Amongst them are an evil 5 dimensional imp trapped in a 6 dimensional bottle, a speedster Glimmer's treadmill, and a larval universe they call Qwewq. They say that they are feeding it and hope to allow it to grow to its full potential. Collected in The Nebula Man appeared once more in Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E., before reappearing in JLA: Classified #1‚Äì3, working with Gorilla Grodd and announcing the end of the world. At the same time, the Justice League were in the Infant Universe of Qwewq, unaware that this was Neh-Buh-Loh's larval form. Collected in In the Seven Soldiers series, Neh- Buh-Loh was revealed to be allied with (or perhaps created by) the Sheeda, time travelling predators from the end of time. He served as the personal huntsman of the Sheeda Queen Gloriana Tenebrae. In the past, Neh-Buh-Loh had been sent to slay the queen's innocent stepdaughter Rhiannon (a.k.a. Misty Kilgore). However, moved by her beauty and symmetry, he could not bear to do it and allowed the girl to escape. This was Neh-Buh-Loh's secret shame for many years. It was further explained that in the 1940s, Neh-Buh-Loh had been summoned (rather than created) by The Hand using a sonic horn. The creature was seeking \\"seven soldiers\\" who were prophesied to one day defeat his mistress, Gloriana. The Hand was all too eager to point him in the right direction, thus leading to the original Seven Soldiers becoming lost in time. This same sonic horn was used by The Hand's nephew Boy Blue to once again summon Neh-Buh-Loh and the Sheeda in the present, leading to the destruction of an ad hoc Seven Soldiers team created by the original Vigilante. This set the stage for the Harrowing of Earth which the heroes of the Seven Soldiers series attempted to prevent. Neh-Buh-Loh was finally defeated by Frankenstein, who capitalized on a flaw placed in him as an infant by the Ultramarine Corps, a team of heroes who had entered Qwewq seeking redemption. Allusions The use of Neh-Buh-Loh in Seven Soldiers is influenced by several characters in myth and legend. His failed mission to kill his queen's lovely stepdaughter is a direct parallel with the fairy tale of Snow White. In addition, his role as the horned Huntsman of the Sheeda has elements of characters from Celtic mythology such as the horned god Cernunnos and later legends such as the King of the Wild Hunt and Herne the Hunter.

Background Marking a new direction the band would follow in years to come, Hex stands in stark contrast to Earth's previous works. While retaining the extremely heavy doom/drone metal song structure of epic riffs over simple repetitive drum beats, the guitar was inflected with country influences that favored a cleaner reverb-heavy tone layered with acoustic instruments over the band's previous predilection for distortion. The press release cited diverse influences such as Ennio Morricone, Billy Gibbons, Neil Young's soundtrack to the movie Dead Man, country musicians Duane Eddy, Merle Haggard, and Roy Buchanan.http://www.southernlord.com/press/earth/ Carlson indicated that he viewed this shift as part of a continuum rather than a categorical change in direction: The album was influenced by Cormac McCarthy, particularly his novel Blood Meridian. Every song title on the album is named after a phrase found in the text of the novel. Carlson commented that: Carlson said that \\"There's an arc to each song and an arc to the album, rather than just a collection of songs. There's silence and a sense of space to the music\\". The subtitle is from William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. It was well received by fans of the band and critics alike despite the change in sound. When asked about the elimination of distortion, Carlson remarked: Reception Critics acknowledged the sharp transformation in the band's sound and were generally favorable towards Hex. Writing for Pitchfork, Austin Gaines described the album as a \\"surprisingly beautiful instrumental album\\" that exchanged distorted riffing for \\"the austere beauty of a telecaster roaming the Western U.S.\\" In Exclaim!, Kevin Hainey praised the album as \\"an elegant and singular effort filled with sparsely beautiful passages that lead headlong into the void\\".

Her disappearance, along with that of her 3-year-old son, Andrew, is currently Britain's longest-running missing persons case, and within Scotland, the case is as notorious as Glasgow's Bible John murders. On 11 September 2019, William (Bill) MacDowell was charged with the murder of Renee and Andrew. Their bodies have never been found.  Disappearance  c. 1976 MacRae lived in Inverness and was married to Gordon MacRae, though the couple were separated. She had two sons, 9-year-old Gordon and 3-year-old Andrew. On Friday 12 November 1976 MacRae left her home in Cradlehall with both her sons. She dropped her elder son Gordon at her estranged husband's house and turned south on to the A9 in the direction of Perth to visit her sister in Kilmarnock. Neither MacRae nor her son Andrew have ever been seen again. Later the same night, 12 miles away, a train driver spotted MacRae's burning BMW car in an isolated lay-by. When the police reached the vehicle, it was charred and empty, apart from a rug stained with blood matching MacRae's blood type. One of the most intensive searches ever mounted in Scotland failed to find any trace. It was concluded that they had been murdered, that the murderer had made careful plans and had disposed of the bodies without leaving any clues. Witnesses on the A9 reported seeing a man dragging something they thought was a dead sheep not far from the car, while others saw a man with a pushchair near the quarry. MacRae was reported to have been wearing a sheepskin coat when she disappeared. As police investigated, it became apparent that MacRae's personal life was not straightforward. Circa 1971, unbeknownst to her husband, MacRae began to have an affair with Bill MacDowell, who was married with two children and worked for Gordon MacRae as an accountant and company secretary. Nobody knew about the affair except Valerie Steventon, MacRae's best friend. She revealed that MacRae had not been planning to visit her sister that night, but had intended to travel to Perthshire to visit MacDowell, who happened to be Andrew's biological father. MacRae had first confided to her friend about her conducting an affair in the spring of 1973, when she had been pregnant with Andrew. According to Steventon, \\"Renee was completely besotted by Bill\\", and he had told her that he had a job with Texaco in Shetland and had found a house where they could live. Although, according to Steventon, these details \\"turned out to be a pack of lies.\\" MacDowell admitted their affair but has not spoken about the case again except to deny any involvement.  Investigation  The revelation of MacRae's four-year affair with MacDowell led senior officers to admit that the case was \\"mired in a sea of deceit and untruthfulness from its start.\\" Detective Sergeant John Cathcart coordinated the search and after eight months he had a breakthrough. While excavating Dalmagarry quarry he was hit by a stench after removing a layer of topsoil. Convinced it was a sign of corpses, he continued digging, but was told by a superior officer to stop as the bulldozer they were using had to go back to the contractors due to short funds. The inquiry was wound down two years later. However, a 2004 Grampian Television documentary, Unsolved, screened throughout Scotland, renewed interest in the case and the investigation was reopened. In 2004, Chief constable Ian Latimer launched a cold case review, which led to ¬£122,000 being spent on an excavation of Dalmagarry quarry in August. Over the course of three weeks, 20,000 tons of earth from the quarry had been excavated and 2,000 trees were removed. All that was found were two crisp packets, some men's clothing and rabbit bones. , ¬£250,000 has been spent re-investigating the case. In recent years speculation has focused on the bodies having been buried under the A9, which was in the middle of a major programme of upgrading at the time of the disappearance. An 80-year-old farmer with supposed divining skills took his divining rods to Dalmagarry and declared the bodies to be under a track, 12 ft down. He now thinks the bodies are under the A9, at a spot he has marked with a yellow circle. In 2010, the Scottish Government announced that a ¬£2.6 million contract had been awarded for an overtaking lane at the location, which renewed interest from the farmer, who claims to have discovered \\"anomalies\\" in a radar survey of the area. However, a spokeswoman for Northern Constabulary said that after studying aerial photographs taken by the RAF during the construction of the A9, they were satisfied the bodies were not buried under the road. On 2 October 2018 it was reported that Leanach quarry, near to Culloden Battlefield was being searched by Police Scotland in relation to the case. Suspect Northern Constabulary named a suspect in a report to the Procurator fiscal in October 2006, but the Crown Office declared there was insufficient evidence to go to court. From the start the prime suspect was MacDowell. He has always been reluctant to speak to the media, however in 2004, he broke his 28-year silence and insisted that he did not kill her. A week after the disappearance, MacDowell walked into Inverness police HQ to make a voluntary statement, however his wife dragged him out of the building and nothing was said ever again. More than 40 years after the disappearance, further details emerged of a suspect who had fled to the US the day after being interviewed by an investigator in the aftermath of the disappearance. James Taylor said his late friend Sandy Thompson, a senior officer who worked closely with MacRae's contacts, who carried out fieldwork investigating the case had been sure MacRae was murdered and buried on the A9 near a flyover. Taylor reported his concerns to Police Scotland following an appeal for information to mark the 40-year anniversary of the case. He said that Sandy Thomson spoke to a foreman in the roads department who had said someone had dug up a section of the road on the day Renee disappeared. There was one man he spoke to about the road and showed the evidence they had gathered. Taylor recalled: \\"Sandy said he knew right away when the man looked at it that the woman was dead, that was where she was buried and this man knew far more about it than he was telling.\\" The man fled to the US the next day before returning to the UK later when the case had gone cold. In September 2019, detectives from Police Scotland's Major Investigation Team arrested a 77-year-old man in connection with the disappearance. At Inverness Sheriff Court on Wednesday 11 September MacDowell was charged with the murders of Renee and Andrew MacRae.

Despite being members of the tree frog family, they are not arboreal. It has two recognized subspecies.  Description  The northern cricket frog is one of North America's three smallest vertebrates, ranging from long. Its dorsal coloration varies widely, and includes greys, greens, and browns, often in irregular blotching patterns. One New York biologist has identified six distinct color morphs and four pattern morphs, and several intergrades between these.(Westerveld,1977). Typically there is dark banding on the legs and a white bar from the eye to the base of the foreleg. The skin has a bumpy texture. It is very similar to the southern cricket frog, Acris gryllus, found in the US Southeastern Coastal Plain, but with some overlap along the Fall Line. The southern cricket frog has longer legs, with less webbing on the hind feet, and a more pointed snout; northern cricket frogs have been observed with snouts indistinguishable from those of the southern species.(Westerveld, 1998). The line on the back of its thigh is typically more sharply defined than that of the northern cricket frog.(Conant et al. 1998, Martof et al. 1980). Biologists have recorded northern cricket frogs in the northern fringes of their range with extremely sharp posterior leg stripes.  Behavior and diet  Northern cricket frogs are diurnal and generally active much of the year, except in midwinter in northern areas when the water is frozen. Their primary diet is small ( long) insects, including mosquitos. They are, in turn, preyed upon by a number of species, including birds, fish, and other frogs. To escape predators, they are capable of leaping up to 3 feet in a single jump and are excellent swimmers.  Reproduction  Acris crepitans eggs Breeding generally occurs from May through July. The males call from emergent vegetation with a high-pitched, short, pebble-like call which is repeated at an increasing rate. The sound suggests pebbles being clicked together, much like a cricket, hence the name. One egg is laid at a time, generally attached to a piece of vegetation. The tadpoles hatch in only a few days, and undergo metamorphosis in early fall. Maturity is usually reached in less than a year.  Habitat  Cricket frogs prefer the edges of slow-moving, permanent bodies of water. Large groups of them can often be found together along the muddy banks of shallow streams, especially during premigratory clustering. The northern cricket frog has been observed to hibernate upland, often at considerable distances from water.  Subspecies  Acris crepitans blanchardi *Eastern cricket frog, A. c. crepitans (Baird, 1854) *Coastal cricket frog, A. c. paludicola (Burger, Smith and Smith, 1949)  Geographic distribution  *A. c. crepitans is found from New York, south to Florida, and west along the Gulf Coast states to Texas. *A. c. paludicola occurs in southwestern Louisiana to East Texas.  Conservation status  Frogs such as A. crepitans are important as an indicator of wetland health and general environmental quality in the areas they inhabit.

They speak the Otuho language. Demographics The Otuho are bordered by the Pari in the North, the Bari on the West, the Acholi and the Madi in the South, and the Didinga and the Boya in the East. Their region is characterized by ranges and mountain spurs such as the Imotong mountain, the highest mountain in South Sudan with an altitude of 10,453 ft above sea level. It is divided into 5 major sub- regions: Imatong, Valley, Dongotolo, Lopit, and the Great Plains. The Murle people have recently raided Otuho, the Lopit, and other tribes in the area, abducting their children. Subsistence As agro-pastoralists, they keep large herds of cattle, sheep and goats, and supplement this with hoe-farming, hunting, and fishing. They engage in some subsistence agriculture; their main crops are sorghum, ground nuts, simsim (sesame), and maize in the plains, or telebun, dukhn, sweet potatoes, and tobacco in the hills. Land is owned by no single person, but in trust by the community. In the mountains, after finding a site, the group decides the boundaries of each person's garden, with certain areas being fallow (for up to 10 years) and others open to cultivation (for up to 4 years).  Religion  Their primary religion is an ethnic religion based on nature and ancestor worship that is deeply rooted in their ethnic identity; conversion to another religion essentially equates to cultural assimilation. The chief god of the Otuho is called Ajok; he is generally seen as kind and benevolent, but can be angered. In Otuho mythology he once answered a woman's prayer for the resurrection of her son. Her husband, however, was angry and re-killed the child. Ajok was annoyed by his actions and swore never to resurrect any Otuho again, and in this manner, death was said to have become permanent.

The Luxembourg Crisis (, , , ) was a diplomatic dispute and confrontation in 1867 between the French Empire and Prussia over the political status of Luxembourg. The confrontation almost led to war between the two parties, but was peacefully resolved by the Treaty of London. Background Luxembourg City boasted some of the most impressive fortifications in the world,the Fortress of Luxembourg, partly designed by Marshal Vauban and improved by subsequent engineers, which gave the city the nickname \\"Gibraltar of the North\\". Since the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg had been in personal union with the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In a concession to neighbouring Prussia, Luxembourg was to be a member of the German Confederation, with several thousand Prussian soldiers stationed there. The Belgian Revolution of 1830 had divided Luxembourg into two, threatening Dutch control of the remaining territory. As a result, William I of the Netherlands entered Luxembourg into the German customs union, the Zollverein, to dilute the French and Belgian cultural and economic influence in Luxembourg. Seven Weeks' War Otto von Bismarck's non-committal answers encouraged Napoleon III. The Second Schleswig War of 1864 had further advanced nationalist tensions in Germany, and, throughout 1865, it was clear that Prussia intended to challenge the position of the Austrian Empire within the German Confederation. Despite potentially holding the balance of power between the two, Emperor Napoleon III kept France neutral. Although he, like most of Europe, expected an Austrian victory, he could not intervene on Austria's side as that would jeopardise France's relationship with Italy post-Risorgimento. As a result, at Biarritz on 4 October 1865, Napoleon III promised Prussian Prime Minister, Otto von Bismarck, France's neutrality, hoping that such an open statement of intent would strengthen France's negotiating position regarding the western bank of the Rhine. Bismarck refused to offer any land from the Rhineland, which was Napoleon's preferred region. However, he did make suggestions of French hegemony in Belgium and Luxembourg, although not committing anything to writing. When Austria and Prussia did go to war in 1866 (the so-called Seven Weeks' War), the result was a shock to Europe. Prussia quickly defeated Austria and her allies, forcing Austria to the negotiating table. Napoleon III offered to mediate, and the result, the Treaty of Prague, dissolved the German Confederation in favour of a Prussian-dominated organisation, the North German Confederation. French offer Napoleon III, whose misjudgment of the Prussian mood caused the escalation of the crisis. Assuming that Bismarck would honour his part of the agreement, the French government offered King William III of the Netherlands 5,000,000 guilders for Luxembourg. Being in deep financial trouble, William accepted the offer on 23 March 1867. But the French were shocked to learn that Bismarck now objected. There was a public outcry against the deal in Germany; Bismarck's hand was forced by nationalistic newspapers in north Germany. He reneged on the pledge that he had made to Napoleon at Biarritz, and threatened war. Not only had Bismarck united much of northern Germany under the Prussian crown, but he had secretly concluded agreements with the southern states on 10 October. William III's personal troubles. To avert a war that might drag their own countries into conflict, other countries rushed to offer compromise proposals. Austria's Foreign Minister, Count Beust, proposed transferring Luxembourg to neutral Belgium, in return for which France would be compensated with Belgian land. However, King Leopold II of Belgium refused to part with any of his lands, putting paid to Beust's proposal. With the German public angered and an impasse developing, Napoleon III sought to backtrack; he certainly did not want to appear to be unduly expansionist to the other Great Powers. Thus, he demanded only that Prussia withdraw its soldiers from Luxembourg City, threatening war in the event that Prussia did not comply. To avoid this fate, Emperor Alexander II of Russia called for an international conference, to be held in London. The United Kingdom was more than happy to host the talks as the British government feared that the absorption of Luxembourg by either power would weaken Belgium, its strategic ally on the continent. London Conference All of the Great Powers were invited to London to hammer out a deal that would prevent war. As it was clear that no other power would accept the incorporation of Luxembourg into either France or the North German Confederation, the negotiations centred upon the terms of Luxembourg's neutrality. The result was a victory for Bismarck; although Prussia would have to remove its soldiers from Luxembourg City, Luxembourg would remain in the Zollverein. The Luxembourg Crises showed the influence the public opinion could have on the actions of governments. It also demonstrated the growing opposition between France and Prussia and foreshadowed the Franco-Prussian War which would break out on 1870. For Luxembourg, this was an important step towards full independence, despite the fact that it remained united in a personal union with the Netherlands until 1890. Luxembourg was provided an opportunity to develop itself independently, leading to the emergence of the steel industry in the South of the country. In the Netherlands, there was criticism from parliament against the king and government, especially against Foreign Affairs minister Jules van Zuylen van Nijevelt. The liberals found that this actions from the king and cabinet had endangered the Dutch neutrality and almost dragged the country into a European war. Parliament blocked the budget of the Foreign Affairs department and when the irritated king disbanded the parliament, the new parliament confirmed this and demanded the dismissal of the government. The king and government adhered and the unwritten rule of confidence was created in Dutch state law: a minister or government could rule only with support of (a majority in) parliament.

Life Sister Madeleva was born in Cumberland, Wisconsin, in 1887, and christened Mary Evaline Wolff. Her father, August Wolff, was a Lutheran and a saddle and harness maker, who was twice mayor of Cumberland. He read poetry to Mary Evaline. Madeleva‚Äôs mother, Lucy, was a devout Catholic. Mary Evaline learned how to handle pliers, tacks and hammers. She climbed thorn apple trees, diagrammed wildflowers and in winter ice-skated from morning to night. At school, she \\"lived to learn, and so lived richly,\\" she wrote in one of her books, My First Seventy Years. Madeleva decided to become a religious sister during her first semester at Saint Mary's College. She was given the name \\"Madeleva\\" upon her acceptance into the Congregation of Holy Cross in 1908. Sister Madeleva was known for her poetry, her eloquence and her outspokenness. She was a medieval scholar, whose literary essays won her distinction. She wrote a good deal in defense of Geoffrey Chaucer's character \\"The Prioress\\". In all, she authored more than 20 books. She studied at numerous universities, including the University of California, Berkeley and University of Oxford. When she completed her M.A. degree in English at The University of Notre Dame, she had been one of only four Sisters to pursue graduate work there. In 1925, she earned a doctorate in English from the University of California at Berkeley. She served as a teacher and the principal of the Academy of the Sacred Heart (opened in 1878, the school closed in 1937) in Ogden, Utah, and as President of College of Saint Mary-of- the-Wasatch in Salt Lake City. She later became the head of the English department at Saint Mary's College. The tenure of Sister Madeleva as President of Saint Mary's College began in 1934.

Their population is estimated to be about 300,000 in Chad. Other estimates place the total number of Burgu people in Sudan to be about 700,000. The Burgu today primarily adhere to Islam, following the Maliki Sunni denomination. They supported the Sultans of Abeche and the Sudanic kingdoms, who spoke their language. Little is certain about their history before the 17th century. They are noted as having helped expel the Christian Tunjur dynasty and installed an Islamic dynasty in their region in the early 17th- century. Their homelands lie in the path of caravan routes that connect the Sahel and West Africa with the Middle East. The Burgu people are an Arabized African people. They are traditionally pastoral and farmers who are clan- oriented. The Burgu people have also been referred to as the Wadai, a derivative of Ouadda√Ø. They speak Maba, a Nilo-Saharan language, of the Maban branch. Locally this language is called Bura Mabang. The first ten numerals in Maba language, states Andrew Dalby, are \\"tek, bar, kungal, asal, tor, settal, mindri, rya, adoi, atuk\\", and this is very distant from other Nilo-Saharan languages. Although a small ethnic group, their Maba language was the state language of the Islamic state of Wadai, and continued to be an important language when the Islamic Bornu Empire conquered these lands. Many Burgu people also speak Arabic, as their traditional trade language. The Burgu people rebelled against the tribute demands of the Bornu Empire, and became sovereign people. They then led raids to southern regions for plunder and slaves from non-Muslim African ethnic groups. The African slaves of the Burgu people were absorbed in the Burgu tribal culture, and often they converted to escape slavery. In the 19th century, a powerful Burgu Sultanate on slave trading caravan route emerged under rulers such as Muhammad al-Sharif and Doud Murra. The Burgu Sultanate was abolished by the French in 1912, and the Burgu people's region thereafter annexed into the Ubangi-Shari colony. The Burgus participated in the efforts to end the colonial rule and then in the civil wars in Chad. The Burgu people are subdivided into many sub-clans, each controlling certain grazing lands and sources of water. Among the various sub- clans, the largest are the Marfa, Djene and Mandaba.

At the time of his execution, an eclipse of the sun was seen. The common people, who had given the marquis his nickname of El Tapado (the \\"covered-up\\", or \\"hidden\\"), viewed the eclipse as a sign from God that an innocent man was about to be executed.

It is also called civies/civvies (slang for \\"civilian attire\\"). Origin The word originates from the Arabic: Mufti (ŸÖŸÅÿ™Ÿä) meaning an Islamic scholar. It has been used by the British Army since 1816 and is thought to derive from the vaguely Eastern style dressing gowns and tasselled caps worn by off-duty officers in the early 19th century. Yule and Burnell's Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive (1886) notes that the word was \\"perhaps originally applied to the attire of dressing-gown, smoking- cap, and slippers, which was like the Oriental dress of the Mufti\\". Mufti day A mufti day (also known as casual clothes day, casual Friday, colour day, own clothes day, home clothes day, plain clothes day, non-uniform day, mufting day, free dress day, civvies day, dress down day, uniform-free day) is a day where students and staff go to school in casual clothing instead of school uniform. This is found in many countries where students are required to wear uniform, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Fiji, Australia, India, New Zealand, Nigeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Pakistan and Bangladesh. By extension the term is used in reference to the practice of wearing \\"smart- casual\\" office clothing in place of business suits or other conventional clothing.

His work has included assistance with messaging for Newt Gingrich's Contract with America, and public relations support for pro-Israel policies in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. He advocated use of vocabulary crafted to produce a desired effect; including use of the term death tax instead of estate tax, and climate change instead of global warming. Luntz has frequently contributed to Fox News as a commentator and analyst, as well as running focus groups during and after presidential debates on CBSN. Luntz describes his specialty as \\"testing language and finding words that will help his clients sell their product or turn public opinion on an issue or a candidate.\\" He is also an author of business books dealing with communication strategies and public opinion.  Background  Luntz was born and grew up in West Hartford, Connecticut, the son of Phyllys (n√©e Kelmenson) and Lester Luntz, who together wrote the first American forensic dentistry textbook. His family was Jewish. He graduated from Hall High School, earned a bachelor of arts degree in history and political science from the University of Pennsylvania, and received a doctorate in politics from Trinity College, Oxford where he was a contemporary of future British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Luntz's doctoral thesis formed the basis for his first book, Candidates, Consultants, and Campaigns: The Style and Substance of American Electioneering. published in 1988.New York: Blackwell, 1988. Luntz's studies at Oxford was funded by The Thouron Award, a scholarship established in 1960 by Sir John R.H. Thouron, K.B.E., and Esther du Pont Thouron to strengthen the \\"special relationship\\" between the United States and the United Kingdom through educational exchange between British universities and the University of Pennsylvania to foster the sort of relationship that Luntz had with Boris Johnson (as Luntz counseled Johnson regarding his election as President of the Oxford Union debate society). Since its founding in 1960, the Thouron Award has sponsored programs of graduate study for more than 650 fellows, known as Thouron Scholars. Luntz has appeared as a consultant or panel member on a number of television news shows, including The Colbert Report, Capital Gang, Good Morning America, Hannity, Hardball with Chris Matthews, Meet the Press, PBS NewsHour, Nightline, The O'Reilly Factor, Real Time with Bill Maher, and The Today Show. He has written op-eds for publications such as The Financial Times, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post. He was an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania from 1989 until 1996 and also taught at George Washington University and Harvard University. On January 10, 2020, Luntz suffered a stroke, a matter he freely discussed in interviews afterwards. He recovered, and continued his public analysis and media appearances.Interview with Al Jazeera, August 2020, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7MseJ9pR-4  Use of language  Luntz frequently tests word and phrase choices using focus groups and interviews. His stated purpose in this is the goal of causing audiences to react based on emotion. \\"80 percent of our life is emotion, and only 20 percent is intellect. I am much more interested in how you feel than how you think. ... If I respond to you quietly, the viewer at home is going to have a different reaction than if I respond to you with emotion and with passion and I wave my arms around. Somebody like this is an intellectual; somebody like this is a freak.\\" In an article in The New Yorker Luntz is quoted as saying, > The way my words are created is by taking the words of others.... I've > moderated an average of a hundred plus focus groups a year over five > years... I show them language that I've created. Then I leave a line for > them to create language for me. In a 2007 interview on Fresh Air with Terry Gross, Luntz redefined the term \\"Orwellian\\" in a \\"positive\\" sense, saying that if one reads George Orwell's essay on language, \\"To be 'Orwellian' is to speak with absolute clarity, to be succinct, to explain what the event is, to talk about what triggers something happening‚Ä¶ and to do so without any pejorative whatsoever.\\" Luntz believes that Orwell would not have approved of many of the uses to which his pseudonym is applied by quoting Orwell's essay \\"Politics and the English Language\\", where Luntz focuses on how Orwell derides the use of clich√© and dying metaphors.Fresh Air with Terry Gross, \\"Frank Luntz Explains 'Words That Work'\\", January 9, 2007. Retrieved June 28, 2007. Luntz's description of his job revolves around exploiting the emotional content of language. \\"It's all emotion. But there's nothing wrong with emotion. When we are in love, we are not rational; we are emotional. ... my job is to look for the words that trigger the emotion. ... We know that words and emotion together are the most powerful force known to mankind.\\" Additionally in his 2007 interview on Fresh Air, Luntz discussed his use of the term \\"energy exploration\\" to refer to oil drilling. His research on the matter involved showing people a picture of current oil drilling and asking if in the picture it \\"looks like exploration or drilling.\\" He said that 90 percent of the people he spoke to said it looked like exploring. \\"Therefore I'd argue that it is a more appropriate way to communicate.\\" He went on to say, \\"if the public says after looking at the pictures, that doesn't look like my definition of drilling‚Äîit looks like my definition of exploring‚Äîthen don't you think we should be calling it what people see it to be, rather than adding a political aspect to it all?\\" Terry Gross responded, \\"Should we be calling it what it actually is, as opposed to what somebody thinks it might be? The difference between exploration and actually getting out the oil‚Äîthey're two different things, aren't they?\\" James L. Martin, chairman of the conservative 60 Plus Association, described Luntz's role as being that of pollster and popularizer of the phrase \\"death tax.\\" > Martin gained an important ally in GOP pollster Frank Luntz, whose polling > revealed that 'death tax' sparked voter resentment in a way that > 'inheritance tax' and 'estate tax' couldn't match.

Retrieved 31 May 2017. Luntz is credited with advising the Bush administration that the phrase \\"global warming\\" should be abandoned in favour of \\"climate change\\", which he called a \\"less frightening\\" phrase than the former (see below).  Publications  Luntz is the author of the 2007 New York Times Best Seller, \\"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear.\\" His second book, \\"What Americans Really Want ... Really: The Truth About Our Hopes, Dreams and Fears,\\" climbed to #6 on the New York Times Business Best Sellers list. In March 2011, Luntz released his book,\\"Win: The Key Principles to Take Your Business From Ordinary to Extraordinary\\".  Work and views  = U.S. politics, 1990s = Luntz speaking at a Republican event in Des Moines, Iowa. Luntz was Pat Buchanan's pollster during the 1992 U.S. Republican presidential primary, and later that year served as Ross Perot's pollster in the general election. Luntz also served as Newt Gingrich's pollster in the mid-1990s for the Contract with America. During that time, he helped Gingrich produce a GOPAC memo that encouraged Republicans to \\"speak like Newt\\" by describing Democrats and Democratic policies using words such as \\"corrupt,\\" \\"devour,\\" \\"greed,\\" \\"hypocrisy,\\" \\"liberal,\\" \\"sick,\\" and \\"traitors.\\" In 1993 and 1997 Luntz served as pollster and strategist for the successful mayoral campaigns of Rudolph Giuliani in New York City. = Israel and the Palestinians = In December 2008 to January 2009, Luntz wrote a report titled \\"The Israel Project's 2009 Global Language Dictionary\\" that has been used by the Israeli government to defend Israeli policy in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. The report, commissioned by The Israel Project, advised media spokespeople to use specific language that Luntz believed would create a more favorable impression of Israel in the United States and the rest of the international community. For example, when discussing the contours of a two-state solution, the report advised describing Palestinian negotiating points as \\"demands\\" because Americans dislike people who make \\"demands.\\" The report was marked \\"not for distribution or publication\\", but it was leaked to Newsweek shortly after it was written. According to the Guardian, Luntz also wrote that \\"Israeli spokesmen or political leaders must never, ever justify 'the deliberate slaughter of innocent women and children' and they must aggressively challenge those who accuse Israel of such a crime.\\" Luntz cited as an example of an \\"effective Israeli sound bite\\" one which read, \\"I particularly want to reach out to Palestinian mothers who have lost their children. No parent should have to bury their child.\\" Patrick Cockburn criticized the report as essentially admitting \\"the Israeli government does not really want a two-state solution, but this should be masked because 78 per cent of Americans do.‚Ä≥ = Global warming = Although Luntz later tried to distance himself from the Bush administration policy, it was his idea that administration communications reframe global warming as climate change since \\"climate change\\" was thought to sound less severe. Luntz has since said that he is not responsible for what the Bush administration did after that time. Though he now believes humans have contributed to global warming, he maintains that the science was in fact incomplete, and his recommendation sound, at the time he made it. In a 2002 memo to President George W. Bush titled \\"The Environment: A Cleaner, Safer, Healthier America\\", obtained by the Environmental Working Group, Luntz wrote: \\"The scientific debate is closing [against us] ... but not yet closed. There is still a window of opportunity to challenge the science. ... Voters believe that there is no consensus about global warming within the scientific community. Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate, and defer to scientists and other experts in the field.\\" In 2010, Luntz announced new research that shows the American people are eager for Congress to act on climate legislation that would promote US energy independence and a healthier environment. \\"Americans want their leaders to act on climate change‚Äîbut not necessarily for the reasons you think,\\" Luntz said. \\"A clear majority of Americans believe climate change is happening. This is true of McCain voters and Obama voters alike. And even those that don't still believe it is essential for America to pursue policies that promote energy independence and a cleaner, healthier environment.\\" In reference to recent political events, Luntz added: \\"People are much more interested in seeing solutions than watching yet another partisan political argument.\\" On July 25, 2019 Luntz spoke in front of the United States House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis where he shared his advice to people pushing for action on the climate crisis. Furthermore he stated that \\"I‚Äôm here before you to say that I was wrong in 2001\\",\\"That was a lifetime ago\\" and \\" I‚Äôve changed.\\". He promised to help the Democrats on the climate committee, provided that they put \\"policies ahead of politics\\" and commit to nonpartisan solutions. He had his change of heart after a wildfire, the Skirball Fire, threatened and forced him to evacuate his home in 2017. = 2005 UK Conservative leadership election = In 2005 Luntz conducted a focus group broadcast on the Conservative leadership race on the BBC current affairs show Newsnight. The focus group's overwhelmingly positive reaction to David Cameron was seen by many as crucial in making him the favorite in a crowded field. Cameron was the eventual victor.\\"How a celebrity pollster created Cameron\\" by Nick Cohen, The Observer, 10 December 2006 In March 2007, Newsnight invited him back to gauge comparative opinions on Cameron, Gordon Brown and Sir Menzies Campbell in the city of Birmingham. = 2007 Irish general elections = Luntz led a focus group telecast with the Irish state broadcaster RT√â to gather the opinions of the Irish people before the May 24, 2007 general elections. RT√â hoped to show viewers some of the campaign techniques the political parties were using without their knowledge. = 2007 Australian federal election = Another focus group of swing voters was analysed by Luntz in the lead-up to the November 2007 poll between the ruling Coalition and the opposition Labor party. Luntz noted that, like the Irish scenario, the Coalition was well established, presiding over the country for 11 years and overseeing continued economic growth for much of that period; and that unlike the lead-up to the Irish elections, Australia had a stronger and more popular opposition leader in Kevin Rudd: \\"This is much closer to the Irish election where the leader just barely scraped in, Bertie Ahern, because the economy was so good. But the big difference there was the opposition leader was not as good as Kevin Rudd.\\" Luntz was brought in to conduct his research in a collaborative effort by Sky News Australia and The Australian newspaper. = 2010 UK General Election = During the 2010 UK General Election, Luntz led focus groups during the Prime Ministerial debates between Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg, and also appeared on the BBC's Daily Politics. Luntz predicted that 2015 would likely result in a hung parliament. P = Gun control = In 2012 Luntz conducted a poll that found that sizable majorities of gun owners supported gun control measures such as mandatory criminal background checks, minimum age restrictions, and eligibility requirements for concealed weapon permits. = U.S. politics, 2010s =  Occupy Wall Street movement, 2011  In November 2011, during the height of the Occupy Wall Street movement, Luntz had a meeting with the Republican Governors Association to discuss how to address the growing populist Occupy movement sweeping the country. > I'm so scared of this anti-Wall Street effort. I'm frightened to death. > They're having an impact on what the American people think of capitalism.  Depression and sale of LuntzGlobal, 2012‚Äì2014  According to a 2014 article in The Atlantic, Luntz became frustrated with the contention and argumentation of voters after the 2012 presidential election and, at the time of the interview for the article, was in psychological turmoil: \\"Something in his psyche has broken, and he does not know if he can recover.\\" As a result, in 2014, he sold the majority of shares of his polling business, LuntzGlobal, but he continues to be a contributor to news outlets.  State of the Republican Party  In August 2020, Luntz was asked what the defining principles of the Republican Party were, to which he responded, \\"You know, I don‚Äôt have a history of dodging questions. But I don‚Äôt know how to answer that. There is no consistent philosophy. You can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs about making America great again at a time of Covid and economic distress and social unrest. It‚Äôs just not credible.\\"  Criticism  = Refusal to release poll data = In 1997, the American Association for Public Opinion Research, of which Luntz was not a member, criticized Luntz for refusing to release poll data to support his claimed results \\"because of client confidentiality\\". Diane Colasanto, who was president of the AAPOR at the time, said > It is simply wanting to know, How many people did you question? What were > the questions? We understand the need for confidentiality, but once a > pollster makes results public, the information needs to be public. People > need to be able to evaluate whether it was sound research. In 2000 he was censured by the National Council on Public Polls \\"for allegedly mischaracterizing on MSNBC the results of focus groups he conducted during the [2000] Republican Convention.\\" In September 2004, MSNBC dropped Luntz from its planned coverage of that year's presidential debate, saying \\"[W]e made a decision not to use focus groups as part of our debate coverage. This decision had nothing to do with Frank's past work or politics.\\" Luntz disagreed, believing that MSNBC \\"buckled to political pressure\\" from activist David Brock.Howard Kurtz's Media Notes, Washington Post: Pink-slipped pollster. October 4, 2004. =2010 \\"Lie of the Year\\" award = Luntz was awarded the 2010 PolitiFact Lie of the Year award for his promotion of the phrase 'government takeover' to refer to healthcare reform, starting in the spring of 2009. \\"'Takeovers are like coups,' Luntz wrote in a 28-page memo. 'They both lead to dictators and a loss of freedom.'\\"PolitiFact's Lie of the Year: 'A government takeover of health care', by Bill Adair, Angie Drobnic Holan, PolitiFact, December 16, 2010 In an editorial response, the Wall Street Journal wrote that \\"PolitiFact's decree is part of a larger journalistic trend that seeks to recast all political debates as matters of lies, misinformation and 'facts,' rather than differences of world view or principles.\\" The editors of PolitiFact announced \\"We have concluded it is inaccurate to call the plan a government takeover.\\" = Leaked tape from the University of Pennsylvania = On April 25, 2013, The American Spectator, a conservative news outlet, published a scathing article about Luntz entitled \\"The Problematic Frank Luntz's Stockholm Syndrome\\". > In fact, what Luntz has done is simply reveal the kind of thinking that goes > on in the minds of too many on the right who, whether they realize it or > not, have been intellectually and culturally bullied that there is some sort > of 'right way'‚Äî'right' as in 'correct'‚Äîto think. Resulting in some > conservatives who suffer from what might be called a political version of > Stockholm Syndrome‚Äîwhere the captives identify with their captors. The article was a response to an April 22, 2013 leaked recording of Luntz at the University of Pennsylvania, where he said conservative radio personalities (specifically Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin) were being \\"problematic\\" and \\"destroying\\" Republicans' ability to connect with more voters, or even maintain a majority in the House of Representatives in the 2014 mid-term elections. As part of his critique Luntz said: > And they get great ratings, and they drive the message, and it's really > problematic. And this is not on the Democratic side. It's only on the > Republican side. ... [Democrats have] got every other source of news on > their side. And so that is a lot of what's driving it.

That's what's causing this thing underneath. And too many > politicians in Washington are playing coy. After the leak, Luntz announced that he would no longer fund a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania. The scholarship, which was in his father's name, supported student trips to Washington, D.C.

It lies on Exhibition Square, in the city centre. History King's Manor was originally built to house the abbots of St Mary's Abbey, York. The Abbot's house probably occupied the site since the eleventh century, but the earliest remains date from the fifteenth century. When the abbey was dissolved in 1539, Henry VIII instructed that it be the seat of the Council of the North. It performed this role until the Council was abolished in 1641. From 1667 to 1688, it was the residence of the Governor of York. During the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the Governor, Sir John Reresby, 2nd Baronet, remained loyal to the King, James II, but a party of armed men, led by Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby, captured the Manor and the City of York, and held them for William of Orange. After 1688, the building was hired out to private tenants until the nineteenth century, when it was taken over and expanded by the Yorkshire School for the Blind. For a detailed description of the history and architecture of the building, perhaps the best source is that contained in the RCHME Inventory of the City of York, Volume IV.  Use by University of York  On the departure of the Blind School in 1958, the Manor was acquired by York City Council, who leased it to the University in 1963. The main University later moved to the Heslington Campus. From 1966, the principal academic department to use the Manor was the Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies (IoAAS). The IoAAS was a leading UK provider of mid-career education for architects and related professionals, specialising latterly in architectural conservation studies. The main public room of the Manor is the Huntingdon Room, used for courses and meetings. As well as the IoAAS, there were several other Departments in the King‚Äôs Manor, the main ones being the Centre for Medieval Studies, a Language Teaching centre and the Design Unit (an architectural practice, but part of the IoAAS). The building also housed six University staff flats. The Dining Room provided an important place for the meeting of ‚Äòtown and gown‚Äô, especially in the early years of the University. Following the closure of the IoAAS, the main occupant became the Department of Archaeology (including the Archaeology Data Service), plus the Centre for Medieval Studies and the Centre for Eighteenth Century Studies.

It replaced the Director General and the Office of the National Lottery (Oflot). On 1 October 2013 it was abolished, with its responsibilities being assumed by the Gambling Commission. The Commission was a non- departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and its costs were reimbursed from the National Lottery Distribution Fund and Olympic Lottery Distribution Fund. The Commission‚Äôs duties were to ensure that players are treated fairly; the nation‚Äôs interest in the Lottery is protected; and the operator is motivated to maximise the enjoyment and benefits that the Lottery brings to the Nation. It also ran the competitions in 2001 and 2007 to select the commercial operator of the Lottery, on both occasions choosing Camelot Group plc. Structure The Commissioners, of which there were seven, were appointed by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. Commissioners met each month to discuss business and make decisions about developments affecting the Lottery. They also appointed the full-time Chief Executive. The Commission was a small organisation of fewer than 50 people. The majority of staff were based in central London with some based at the operator‚Äôs headquarters in Watford. There were two divisions within the organisation: the Corporate Group, which was led by the Chief Executive, and the Regulatory Operations Group, led by the Deputy Chief Executive. Functions =Protecting players= The Commission protected National Lottery players by ensuring that clear information was provided to them; and by setting rules and procedures for each game. If a player was unhappy about any aspect of the National Lottery, they should have raised this with Camelot in the first instance. The Commission then reviewed cases where players were not satisfied by Camelot Group‚Äôs response. They also ensured that there were controls in place to protect against excessive and under-age play. =Safeguarding the integrity of the lottery= The Commission monitored all aspects of the running of the Lottery, from the televised draws to the way players were paid their prize money, to ensure they were conducted properly and in accordance with the terms of the licence. =Maximising proceeds to the good causes= The Commission worked to secure the greatest possible returns to good causes by monitoring the performance of the Lottery and ensuring that the allocated funds went to the right place, in the right amounts. It was not the NLC‚Äôs responsibility to distribute the good causes funds. There are 14 Lottery distributors who distribute the money to local communities and national projects. Licensing competition The National Lottery is operated by Camelot Group under a licence that was awarded to them by the Commission following a competition to select the operator. The competition for the third Lottery licence took place between January 2005 and August 2007. The Invitation to Apply (ITA) was the formal invitation to bid for the licence and was published on 29 June 2006. Bids were received from Camelot Group plc and Sugal & Damani UK Ltd. Following an evaluation period, on 7 August 2007 the NLC announced that Camelot Group plc was the preferred bidder to become the operator of the next National Lottery Licence. Camelot‚Äôs bid was selected as the bid most likely to generate the best returns to good causes over the course of the licence. The licence came into force on 1 February 2009, to run until 2019, with the option of up to five years' extension.

Etymology The name hankido is a mix of the name Hanguk (the Korean name for South Korea) and hapkido. The resulting word hankido is often written with the han in Old Korean, where the letter \\"a\\" („Öè) is written as arae-a, which looks like a dot. Hankido aims to be a Korean martial art for and from the Korean people, accessible to everyone. The precise origin of hapkido, from which hankido is derived, is one of many Japan‚ÄìKorea disputes, as there is a strong connection to the Japanese martial art aikido. \\"Aikido\\" is always written in kanji, which is similar to hanja. The word hankido actually consists of three different hanja: * Han (Ìïú / Èüì): Korea, Korean culture and mentality (see Names of Korea). * Ki (Í∏∞ / Ê∞£): Ki * Do (ÎèÑ / ÈÅì): The way So you could say that hankido means: The way for Korean people to develop their internal energy/strength. History Hankido is a relatively new hapkido style, developed by Myung Jae Nam. Myung Jae Nam studied traditional hapkido which formed the basis of this new art. Myung Jae Nam started the development of what we now know as hankido in the 1980s. This new hapkido style can be recognized by its elegant, circular movements which the hankido practitioner uses to get in control of his or her opponent. Of course this is partly because hankido has its roots partly in hapkido, but also because Myung Jae Nam, who was a talented dancer, mixed the techniques with traditional Korean dance. This part of hankido is called: Moo Yae Do Bub (Î¨¥ÏòàÎèÑÎ≤ï). Hankido was first officially introduced during the 1st International H.K.D Games in Seoul, South Korea. The development of hankido did not stop there, and in the years after its introduction hankido lost some of its rough edges. In 1993 the IHF trademarked the name hankido in both hangul and hanja writing in South Korea for the first time. Myung Jae Nam toured Europe and the United States to promote his new art until his death in 1999. During the 3rd edition of these games, Myung Jae Nam introduced another art, called hankumdo. Hankido and hapkido floatThe difference between hapkido and hankido is that hankido is much more an internal art where hapkido is a semi-internal art. Hankido emphasizes the use of three principles, which are Won (Âúì), Yu (ÊµÅ), and Hwa (Âíå), and using the power of softness. To give the hankido practitioner more insight into these principles, there are three exercises they can practice, the Sam Dae Wolly (ÏÇºÎåÄÏõêÎ¶¨). The name of the exercise representing the circle- principle is called Jeon Hwan Bub (Ï†ÑÌôòÎ≤ï). The name for the exercise of the flow-principle is called Young Nyu Bub (Ïó≠Î•òÎ≤ï) and the last exercise, representing the heart-principle, is called Shim Hwa Bub (Ïã¨ÌôîÎ≤ï). This last one is also referred to as the rowing exercise. Techniques Another unique aspect of hankido is that it consists of twelve basic self-defense techniques (ho shin ki, Ìò∏Ïã†Í∏∞) which are connected to 24 breathing techniques: twelve for the defender called 'Techniques of the Sky' (Chun Ki Bub, Ï≤úÍ∏∞Î≤ï, Â§©Ê∞£Ê≥ï) and twelve techniques for the attacker called 'Techniques of the Earth' (Ji Ki Bub, ÏßÄÍ∏∞Î≤ï, Âú∞Ê∞£Ê≥ï). Heaven and Earth are each other's opposites and thus resemble the Korean Um (Yin in Chinese) and Yang. There is more to hankido than just these twelve circle techniques, but these form the stable basis for every hankido practitioner. Curriculum There are 8 disciplines (directions) in which the I.H.F teaches the hankido curriculum. # Ho Shin Do Bup (Self defense) # Moo Ye Do Bup (Spinning/dancing techniques) # Su Jok Do Bup (Striking techniques) # Kyuk Ki Do Bup (Sparring techniques) # Ki Hap Do Bup (Ki-development techniques) # Byung Sool Do Bup (Weaponry) # Su Chim Do Bup (Use of pressure points) # Hwan Sang Do Bup (Visualisation and breathing exercises) The twelve basic self-defense techniques on which the hankido curriculum is built are: # Kwan Jul Ki Bub - Í¥ÄÏ†àÍ∏∞Î≤ï # Chi Ki Bub - ÏπòÍ∏∞Î≤ï # Sib Ja Ki Bub - Ïã≠ÏûêÍ∏∞Î≤ï / ÂçÅÏûêÍ∏∞Î≤ï # Nae Wae Ki Bub - ÎÇ¥Ïô∏Í∏∞Î≤ï / ÂÖßÂ§ñÍ∏∞Î≤ï # Kyeo Rang Ki Bub - Í≤®ÎûëÍ∏∞Î≤ï # Mok Kama Bub - Î™©Í∞êÏïÑÎ≤ï # Mok Keokki Bub - Î™©Í∫æÍ∏∞Î≤ï # Oh Kae Too Bub - Ïñ¥Íπ®Ìà¨Î≤ï # Joong Pal Too Bub - Ï§ëÌåîÌà¨Î≤ï # Hwae Jeon Too Bub - ÌöåÏ†ÑÌà¨Î≤ï # Pal Mok Ki Bub - ÌåîÎ™©Í∏∞Î≤ï # Pal Bae Ki Bub - ÌåîÎ∞∞Í∏∞Î≤ï Development After Myung Jae Nam's death the development of hankido has been overseen by the Jaenam Musul Won Foundation. There are several international and Korean initiatives to spread the art of hankido. Most well known for his effort to do this is Master Ko Baek Yong from the Sang Moo Kwan International Training Center.

Etymology ' has two parts, the prefix is related to \\"again\\" or \\"against\\", \\"towards\\" (compare , ') and ' ('against'), from ' ('in, on') and ' ('straight, direct') and ' which comes from a word meaning 'foot' or 'walker', thus it means \\"walking again\\" as in \\"walking after death\\". The form ' comes from ' meaning 'after' and originating from ' meaning \\"of, away from\\" but adding the contrastive suffix ', in essence meaning \\"after walking\\", \\"walking away from in contrast with close by\\", again implying walking after death.Etymology of ‚Äúweiter‚Äù and ‚Äúwieder‚Äù stackexchange.com  Characteristics  A gjenganger could have several reasons to return from the afterlife. Murdered people and their murderers could seldom sleep peacefully in their graves. People who had committed suicide often came back as gjengangere. At other times, people came back from the grave because they had left something undone. Most often they needed someone to help them do this, before they could finally be at peace. The gjenganger in the Scandinavian tradition took on an entirely corporeal form. It normally had no spectre-like qualities whatsoever. In older traditions, the gjenganger was very malicious and violent in nature, coming back from the grave to torment its family and friends. Their relatives took extensive precautions to make sure they stayed in their graves. This tradition of the violent gjenganger goes back to the Viking Age, where they are present in many of the Icelandic sagas, among others: Grettis saga, Eyrbyggja saga and The Saga of Eric the Red. In this tradition, the gjenganger was a mortal creature. An example of this is Grettir slaying the gjenganger Gl√°mr with his sword. These Viking-age gjengangere were often called draugr, and the two are likely to be different names for the same phenomenon.  Protection and prevention  People had numerous ways of both defending themselves against the gjenganger, and stopping people from becoming one in the first place. * Crucifixes and Christian incantations * Painting symbols, especially the cross * Coffin was carried three times around the church before being buried. The tradition of a pile of stones or twigs (varp) often marked a place where someone has died. It was believed that when you passed this place, you should throw another stone/twig on the varp, to commemorate what had happened there. Doing so would sometimes bring luck on your further travels, while not doing so would result in bad luck and dangerous accidents. Many of these varps have now disappeared, but in a few places the varp is marked with a sign or something similar. Modern Era  In slightly newer tradition, the gjenganger remains a violent entity, though in a less direct way, now becoming more of a disease-spreader. These gjengangere would attack people with their so-called dead man's pinch (d√∏dningeknip). The pinch was often administered when the person was asleep. Both the forest creature (huldra) and the water spirits (n√∏kken) were also accused of doing the same, using bites instead of pinches, often aimed at the victim's face. This belief in beings attacking people in their sleep was used as a warning against going to sleep in specific places; near the graveyard, mountains or water. In later Swedish folklore, a distinction is made between the traditional gjenganger, in Swedish called geng√•ngare, and another type of ghost known as gast. Whereas the geng√•ngare looked virtually identical to a living human, the gast was known to be transparent and/or skeletal in appearance, making it impossible to see who the phantom had been while alive. And whereas the Swedish version of the geng√•ngare were usually said to be rather harmless, it was the gast who was known to cause diseases. They were also known to cause accidents and scare people for no apparent reason other than that they enjoyed doing so. Today it mostly compares with the modern perception of ghosts, most often being ethereal in form, and non-violent in nature. The word gjenganger is being used less, the contemporary word ghost (sp√∏kelse) having mostly taken over. Where the term gjenganger does occur, it may be treated simply as a synonym for ghost. The corresponding verbal phrase walk again (g√• igjen) is just one way of saying \\"haunt\\" with reference to ghosts.

The principal local authority is Cornwall Council. In May 2019, Heamoor residents voted at a public meeting to submit a bid under Cornwall Council's Community Governance Review to split from Penzance Town Council and form a separate parish council to be known as Heamoor Village Council. Volunteers from the community have set up a Steering Group to prepare a bid (submitted in July 2019), build community awareness, and manage the transitional arrangements. Heamoor is one of only two communities in Cornwall to have applied to create a new local council in the Community Governance Review. Heamoor has a number of shops, The Sportsman's Arms pub, The British Legion and Scout group as well as several community facilities. There are two schools; Heamoor Community Primary School and Mounts Bay Academy (formerly Heamoor Secondary Modern School, and later Mount's Bay School and Community Sports College), a comprehensive school. History Village Cross, Heamoor The first mention of the village is in 1274 as La Hae/'Leye, followed by Hay Moor in 1663 and Hae/Anhea in 1869. Heamoor saw initial growth in the 19th century due to its proximity to a major crossroads and the need of farms for agricultural labour. The village originally consisted of two areas‚Äîthe Hea which is the southern part of the village where the main road enters from Penzance and then to the east of this towards St Thomas's Church. The moor occupies the area at the opposite end of the village and could be seen as the poorly drained area now occupied by the playing fields of Mount's Bay Academy and the housing estate nearby. The reason for the moor was the poor drainage which in turn was due to the outcrop of a Felsite dyke (this rock is also called 'elvan' in Cornwall) that can be seen forming the ridge where Poltair woods abuts onto the road leading from Heamoor to Trengwainton. This dyke channels water onto the ground lying below it giving rise to the swampy conditions. Further along the same road are a pair of reservoirs that were once the main supply for the nearby town of Penzance; the water for these reservoirs comes from this dyke. Nowadays the main water supply for the area is Drift Reservoir. The Scout Hut, originally situated in Barn Lane, behind Rosparvah Gardens was the only building to be bombed during WW2. Following the war the Scout Hut was rebuilt in Bolitho Road, behind the British Legion, and named the Venning Hall. Following World War II Heamoor was identified by the then Penzance Borough Council as area of potential development for housing, during the 1970s and 1980s this was realised with the building of a number of large modern housing developments. Churches Polmennor Bible Christian Chapel (1866) Until the mid-20th century, Heamoor had three centres of Christian worship: Wesley Rock Wesleyan Chapel; a Bible Christian Chapel (opened in 1866); and the Church of England Church of St Thomas. Wesley Rock Methodist Church is so called because of the frequent visits by John Wesley to the area where he is said to have preached from a rock in a field. The 'Rock' in question now forms the base of the pulpit in Wesley Rock Church itself. It was moved upon completion of the building that now forms the Church, being previously held in the older adjacent building. The Rock is believed to have originally come from the Rosehill area. On 24 August 1884 the chapel was reopened following an extensive restoration removing the gallery, benches, pulpit and the plaster on the walls. The floor is raised at the rear of the chapel, giving an uninterupted view and the new seats are made of pitch pine and laid out in the amphitheatre style. St Thomas's Church was built in Heamoor in the late 19th century as a Chapel of ease to serve those living in the outskirts of Penzance. The Church is part of Madron parish and was dedicated in 1892: it was licensed for weddings in 1975. Unitil 1934 Heamoor was in the parish of Madron and Heamoor's religious communities still celebrate Madron feast.

It runs from U.S. Route 67 and Illinois Route 111 in Godfrey north to Illinois Route 104 and Business Interstate 72 (abbreviated BL 72) in Jacksonville. This is a distance of 59 miles (95 km). However, the state of Illinois' 2006 data shows the length of Illinois 267 as , which is the distance from the Illinois 111/267 wye north to BL 72 at Illinois 104.  Route description  Illinois 267 is a two-lane surface road for its entire length. It runs through the small towns of Brighton, Medora, Rockbridge and Greenfield.  History  The routing of Illinois 267 over its lifetime is directly related to the routing of U.S. 67 since the 1950s. This is because U.S. 67 has been used at times over both the western route through Carrollton and Jerseyville, and the eastern route through Brighton and Greenfield, with various alternates to U.S. 67 being used on the other routing during these times. The western route originally was U.S. 67 until 1950. It became Alternate U.S. 67 from the 1950s through 1965 as U.S. 67 was moved to the eastern route. In 1965, the western route was renamed from Alt U.S. 67 to Illinois Route 267. In 2001, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) finished construction of the Jacksonville bypass (a four-lane freeway around the western edge of Jacksonville, north of Murrayville). As part of this project, IDOT reverted U.S. 67 south of Jacksonville to its original, western routing. The eastern route was established as U.S. 67 in the mid 1950s, and continued as U.S. 67 through 2001. It then became Illinois 267 in 2001. The southern terminus of Illinois 267 initially was in Medora at Illinois 111; between 2001 and 2006, it was extended south to reconnect to U.S. 67 in Godfrey, concurrent with Illinois 111. Around 2006, IDOT completed the U.S. 67 bypass south of I-72. U.S. 67 was then moved onto this new segment, and Illinois 267 extended north from Murrayville to Business I-72 in Jacksonville.

It lies at the north end of the Wapta Icefield, in Banff National Park, about one km (0.6 mi) east of the border with British Columbia and north of the town of Field. Five kilometres to the northeast lies Bow Pass, one of the high points of the Icefields Parkway. Between the peak and the pass lies picturesque Peyto Lake. Three kilometres southwest of Peyto Peak is Mount Baker, the highest point in the immediate vicinity. History Peyto Peak was named in 1896 by Walter Wilcox for Ebenezer William \\"Bill\\" Peyto, an early outfitter, trail guide and trapper in the Banff and Lake Louise areas. The first ascent of the peak was in 1933 by famed mountaineer Conrad Kain and party. The mountain's name became official in 1928 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Like other mountains in Banff Park, Peyto Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Peyto Peak is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below -30 ¬∞C. Precipitation runoff from Peyto Peak drains into the Mistaya River which is a tributary of the Saskatchewan River.

It is normally used for long-distance haulage, heavy duty distribution haulage and construction haulage. It is available in weights starting at 18 tonnes and is powered by an inline-6 diesel engine with turbocharger and intercooler. Daimler Trucks/Lorries launched the version II of the Actros in 2002, and the version III in 2007. The fourth generation of the Actros, named officially \\"the New Actros\\", launched in July 2011. First generation (MP1, 1996‚Äì2003) First Generation Actros The first generation Actros was introduced in 1996 and production continued until 2003 and had a Innovative features such as Electronically Controlled Air Brake System, Intelligent Disc Brakes on both front and rear, introduction of the Controller Area Network (CAN) Technology for the chassis and drivetrain. Electro-pneumatic circuit on the new transmission models and the introduction of the new OM 500 V6 and V8 diesel engines with Telligent engine control. Chassis and Powertrain The Actros was the first truck to emerge with the collaboration between designers and aerodynamic engineers, the manufacturer was able to reduce the flow resistance by 17%. The chassis of the Actros is available in two, three or four axles with the option of air suspension. A total of 3300 mm and 6300 mm wheelbase can be selected, the construction version of the Actros is available between 3300 and 5100 mm wheelbase with the option of Leaf or Air Suspension on the front axle and Parabolic leaf springs on the rear. The Construction variant of the Actros with 4x2 axle configuration are equipped with drum brakes. Engine and Transmission The Engines for the MP1 Actros is equipped with OM501LA V6 or OM502 V8 mated to a 16-speed manual gearbox or 16-speed hydropneumatically-operated automatic gearbox. Fuel Processing Another new feature of the Actros is the Pump-Line Nozzle Fuel injection system, an improvement for the plug-in pumps that have been used for decades. Each Cylinder has its own injection pump which is driven by its own camshaft. Second generation (MP2, 2003‚Äì2008) Second Generation Actros The second generation Actros was released in 2003 with upgraded interior and exterior components such as the new Bi-Xenon headlamps and the updated Euro 3 emission compliant. A lighter rear axle and new special equipments as well Mercedes Benz released a new special edition of the Actros, the Black Edition series which is only limited to 250 units. This Black Edition Series comes with a 612 hp OM502LA V8 engine with upgraded interior and exterior components such as Birds-eye maple, leather-wrapped steering wheel and seat covers with Mercedes- Benz \\"Star\\" badge, a specially-designed grille with chrome clasp, a new front apron with stainless steel grill, chrome-framed headlights and chrome-plated side mirrors. Third generation (MP3, 2008‚Äì2012) Third Generation Actros (2008 facelift) at IAA Commercial Vehicles 2008 The third generation Actros was introduced in 2008 at the IAA Commercial Vehicles and it was the last facelift of the previous Actros. The Changes for the MP3 Actros is the side mirror that were adapted from the special edition models of the previous generation and has closed brackets and a slightly revised Bi-Xenon headlamps. The third generation Actros ended production in 2011 and replaced with the New Actros but production continues in Asia. Engine fr 0 3130 The Mercedes Benz Actros is equipped with two types of engines. The OM 501 LA-541 and the OM 502 LA-542. The OM 501 is a 12-litre V6, and has outputs ranging from 310 HP to 480 HP. The engine management system employed by this engine is the PLD (Pumpe Leitung Duese-German abbr) which incorporates single plug-in pumps for each cylinder supplying fuel under pressure (up to 1,600 bar) to the injection valves. A control unit MR monitors all engine operating conditions via several sensors and varies the injection pressure to suit each operating condition. OM502 is a v8 engine, has an output ranging from 350 HP to 652 HP. The fourth version offers several engine options in either Euro-5 or Euro-6 .In Euro-6 use inline six engine both series OM471 with 12,8 litre engine range power output:422 HP to 530 HP and OM473 with 15,6 litre engine range power output:517 HP to 626 HP, with common rail pressure 2800 bar and double camshaft with 4 valve per cylinder to compliant models. Gearbox The second generation comes with an electronic sequential gearbox that Mercedes-Benz has dubbed the \\"Telligent Gearbox\\". It pushes forward the principle used in some earlier Mercedes-Benz tractors; using the gearshift lever to command a pneumatically actuated system that changes the gears. The Telligent gearbox utilizes a computer, together with a load-sensing system on the fifth-wheel coupling, to estimate the proper gear that the truck must be in. For example, if you want to upshift, the computer estimates the load on the tractor and the current engine mode, and gives you the proper gear for decreasing engine On the other hand, if you want to downshift, the computer assumes you wish to overtake, and gives you a proper gear for acceleration. There's an automatic version which works like the Tiptronic system found in Mercedes-Benz cars. The fourth-version launched in 2011 offers exclusively the 12-speed powershift transmission. =Operation= The system consists of a small lever mounted under the right armrest and a flat switch underneath. The lever is slightly tilted, so that it matches the natural curve of the driver's hand when it's on the armrest. The lever has two buttons on either side. When at a standstill, the driver must push the right button, then (while holding it), push the lever forward and release it select fourth fast. The current gear is shown as a large number on the main display. After doing this, the driver steps on the clutch pedal and waits for approximately two seconds. After the gearshift has completed, a double click is sounded through the speakers, and the driver proceeds with pulling off as normal. Once moving, the driver has two choices. He or she may push or pull the lever to let the computer choose the gear for them, or they can use the splitter switch (the small switch under the lever) to pre-select gears. Either way, the gear is selected first, then the clutch is depressed. For example, if you're in fourth fast, pulling the splitter switch up once pre-selects fifth slow. The left button (known as the 'flush button', as it is flush with the lever) is used to switch to neutral. Cabin Instrument Cluster in 2010 Actros 3 The Actros cabs come in four types: *S - designed for daily operation and construction vehicles such as cement trucks. The daily cab has its front bumper lower to the ground to prevent under-run, whereas the construction version of the S cab has its front bumper higher to prevent hitting an obstacle when driving off-road on the site. *M - designed for distribution vehicles. It offers a sleeper, though comfort has not been focused on as in the L cab. It comes in short and long sleeper versions. *L - Low-roof long-haul cab, providing comfortable driving and rest for the driver. *LH \\"MegaSpace\\"- Long-haul high-roof cab, providing comfort for long driving, as well as enough space for the driver and/or passenger to freely move around the cab when needed. Electronics Depending on model either Actros 1,2 or 3 the electronics may vary. For example, the braking system known as EPB or BS from Wabco incorporates ABS and ASR functions. This system is very reliable and efficient. The stopping distance in the Actros was drastically reduced as compared to its predecessor the SK. In later models of Actros 2 and all Actros 3 models the braking System was improved to EPB 2. The Electronics in the Actros 1 are networked via Controller Area Network (CAN) in a system known as IES (Integrated Electronics System) with the instrument cluster as the Central Gateway (CGW) or the interphase. In the Actros 2 and 3 the electronics are networked also by CAN in a system known as KontAct (Concept of the Electronic systems in the Actros). There is a wide range of other electronic features, offered as extras. These include lane assist (warns the driver if they inadvertently leave their lane), Autonomous Intelligent Cruise Control ART (which engages the brakes if the vehicle in front suddenly stops), side looking radar for warning the driver about a vehicle in their blind spot, and many more, mostly oriented towards safety. All of them are marketed as \\"Telligent\\". Military variants Armoured Heavy Support Vehicle System of the Canadian Army in Afghanistan. Actros Armoured Heavy Support Vehicle System (AHSVS) is a military armoured truck (86 ordered by Canadian Army in 2007) using the civilian Actros platform with a protected cab developed by Land Mobility Technologies in South Africa in cooperation with Composhield of Denmark for Mercedes-Benz.

This pattern will be achieved by a truncated paraboloid reflector or a circular paraboloid reflector. Since the reflector is narrow in the vertical plane and wide in the horizontal, it produces a beam that is wide in the vertical plane and narrow in the horizontal. (The larger the antenna dimension, the narrower the beam.)  Principle  Circular paraboloid (red) and its truncated reflector (green). In a parabolic antenna, the feed horn is placed at the focal point and irradiate the reflector. The latter send back in space a highly focused parallel beam that one can describe as pencil shape. When one removes a section of the paraboloid, rays coming from that section are lost. In keeping the antenna only in the horizontal or the vertical, only the rays at right angle to the remaining antenna section will be focused and thus create a narrow beam in that direction while being wide in the other direction.  Usage  AN/FPN-36 radar, with search (left) and height-finding (right) Fan beam antennas are used in radar sets. Primary radar in airport have often fan-beam with the section of antenna oriented horizontally to give a narrow beam in azimuth.

Its modern-day descendant, The Capital, was acquired by The Baltimore Sun Media Group in 2014. Previously, it was owned by the Capital Gazette Communications group, which published The Capital, Bowie Blade-News, Crofton-West County Gazette, and Capital Style Magazine. The Gazette and their sister publications have a long history, having been composed and printed in numerous locations, all in the Annapolis area, for more than 270 years. The company has moved headquarters seven times, including from 3 Church Circle to 213 West St. in 1948, to 2000 Capital Drive in 1987 and to Bestgate Road in September 2014. 18th century  = William Parks = The Maryland Gazette was founded in Annapolis, Maryland in 1727 and published through 1734 by William Parks. Parks moved to Virginia in 1736. =Jonas Green= The Gazettes second publisher was Jonas Green, a former prot√©g√© of Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia. The Gazettes early masthead read as follows: :\\"Annapolis, Printed by Jonas Green at his Printing Office on Charles Street; where all persons may be supplied with this Gazette at twelve shillings, six pence a year, and Advertisements of moderate length are inserted for 5 shillings the First Week and 1 shilling each time thereafter; and long ones in proportion.\\" Money was sometimes hard to come by, so Green sometimes traded an ad or a subscription for supplies. His wife, Anne Catherine Hoof Green, also helped to make ends meet by selling homemade chocolates at the post office. = Anna Catherine Hoof Green = When Green died in 1767, his jobs as editor and publisher were taken over by his wife, Anne Catherine Hoof Green, making her one of the first women to hold either of the top jobs at an American newspaper (preceded by Ann Smith Franklin of Rhode Island). A strong supporter of Colonial rights, she continued her husband's policy of operating an independent newspaper under the nose of the royal governor in Annapolis. Ultimately, she published the newspaper for eight years while raising 14 children. The newspaper remained in the Green family for 94 years. The Green House on Charles Street in Annapolis, publication site of the Maryland Gazette, now bears a commemorative historical plaque. =American Revolution= Maryland Gazette September 5, 1765. A skull and crossbones was displayed where the stamp should have been affixed. Jonas Green hated the Stamp Act, which among other things directly taxed his newspaper. Refusing to pay, he published the Gazette with what was then a blaring headline: \\"The Maryland Gazette Expiring: In Uncertain Hopes of a Resurrection to Life Again.\\" Green wrote that because of the Stamp Act, the newspaper \\"will not any longer be published.\\" In the bottom right-hand corner of the page, where the tax stamp should have been placed, there appeared instead a skull and crossbones. Calmer heads persuaded Green to return to publishing as part of the struggle against tyranny, and he later resumed publication under this banner headline: \\"An Apparition of the late Maryland Gazette, which is not dead, but only sleepeth.\\" Defenders of this newspaper's claim as \\"the oldest in the nation\\" say this brief interruption of publication was not a business decision as much as a deliberate political statement by a determined and courageous publisher. Samuel Chase, described by the Maryland Gazette as \\"a foul-mouthed and flaming son of discord.\\"\\"Maryland 400 deserve a memorial\\", by John W. Van de Kamp, The Capital Gazette In 1766, the Maryland Gazette was one of the venues for a war of words between a future signer of the Declaration of Independence and several loyalist members of the Annapolis political establishment. In the Maryland Gazette Extraordinary of June 19, 1766, Walter Dulany, George Steuart (1700‚Äì1784), John Brice (1705‚Äì1766) and others published an article excoriating Samuel Chase, co-founder of the Anne Arundel County chapter of the Sons of Liberty and a leading opponent of the 1765 Stamp Act.Samuel Chase at Maryland Online Encyclopedia Retrieved January 19, 2010 The article called Chase \\"a busy, reckless incendiary, a ringleader of mobs, a foul-mouthed and inflaming son of discord and faction, a common disturber of the public tranquility\\". Chase responded with an open letter accusing Steuart and the others of \\"vanity...pride and arrogance\\", and of being brought to power by \\"proprietary influence, court favour, and the wealth and influence of the tools and favourites who infest this city.\\"Sanderson, John J, p.67, Biography of the Signers To the Declaration of Independence, Volume 5, published by R W Pomery (1823). Retrieved January 21, 2010 In 1772, Charles Carroll of Carrollton engaged in a debate conducted through the Maryland Gazette, maintaining the right of the colonies to control their own taxation. Writing in the Gazette under the pseudonym \\"First Citizen\\", he became a prominent spokesman against the governor's proclamation increasing legal fees to state officers and Protestant clergy. Opposing Carroll in these written debates and writing as \\"Antillon\\" was Daniel Dulany the Younger, a noted lawyer and loyalist politician.Williamson, Claude, p.247, Great Catholics, Williamson Press (March 15, 2007) Retrieved November 2010Warfield, J. D., p. 215, The Founders of Anne Arundel and Howard Counties, Maryland Retrieved November 2010 In these debates, Carroll argued that the government of Maryland had long been the monopoly of four families, the Ogles, the Taskers, the Bladens and the Dulanys, with Dulany taking the contrary view. Eventually word spread of the true identity of the two combatants, and Carroll's fame and notoriety began to grow.McClanahan, Brion T., p.203, The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Founding Fathers Retrieved November 2010 Dulany soon resorted to highly personal ad hominem attacks on \\"First Citizen\\", and Carroll responded, in statesmanlike fashion, with considerable restraint, arguing that when Antilles engaged in \\"virulent invective and illiberal abuse, we may fairly presume, that arguments are either wanting, or that ignorance or incapacity know not how to apply them\\". 19th century =Civil War= After the Civil War began and martial law was imposed on Maryland, thousands of Marylanders were imprisoned, including thirty members of the Annapolis-based Maryland General Assembly. Despite the First Amendment, the crackdown did not spare the press. Nine Maryland newspapers were suppressed temporarily or permanently, and at least a dozen newspaper owners and editors were locked up at Fort McHenry. The Maryland Gazette opted for survival, despite the known sympathies of Annapolis and Anne Arundel County for the South. In 1860, for example, Lincoln received only three votes in Anne Arundel County, and only a single one from Annapolis. However, any loss of revenue from disgruntled readers and advertisers was at least partially compensated for when President Abraham Lincoln appointed the publisher federal paymaster for the state of Maryland. 20th and 21st centuries The Gazette merged with the Evening Capital after being purchased by Capital owner William Abbott in 1919. The newspaper was promoted to twice-weekly publication in 1969 and primarily covered the north county area. References External links *HometownAnnapolis.com The Capital.

His career led to appointment as Professor of Immunochemistry at Boston University. Boyd's signal contribution was to discover that human blood groups are inherited and not influenced by environment. By genetic analysis of blood groups he hypothesized that human races are populations that differ by alleles. On that basis, he divided the world population into 13 geographically distinct races with different blood group gene profiles. In 1955, Boyd co- published the book Races and People with Isaac Asimov; they were both then professors at Boston University School of Medicine. Later, Boyd coined the term 'lectin'. He also studied the blood groups of mummies. Boyd also wrote and published several science fiction short stories in collaboration with Lyle G.

Retrieved 5 October 2012. is a Wesleyan Methodist church that operates across both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland on an all-Ireland basis. It is the fourth-largest Christian denomination in Northern Ireland. The Irish Methodist Church has close links with the Methodist Church in Britain. For the year ending 31 December 2012, there were 105 Methodist ministers, 227 local preachers and over six hundred lay people in leadership positions serving over 200 congregations, which combine to form a total community of 49,394 people. The governing body of the Methodist Church in Ireland is the annual Conference. History The Methodist Church was founded by John Wesley and his younger brother Charles Wesley during the 18th century initially as a movement within the Church of England. John Wesley visited Ireland on twenty- one occasions between 1747 and 1789. Wesleyan Theology remained close to the Anglican criteria of scripture, tradition and reason. It has been suggested that nobody who lived in the 18th century has influenced more people in the years since than John Wesley, and in the dissemination of that influence Irish people have played a significant role. Methodist belief The Methodist Church as part of the worldwide church shares those core beliefs which it believes to have been passed down from the time of the Apostles. Those beliefs are founded on the Bible and are summed up in the creeds, which are regularly used in Christian services of all denominations. It is widely considered that the Protestant Reformation focused on three main matters of belief: the supreme authority of scripture; salvation by faith through faith in Christ, and; the priesthood of all believers. The Methodist Church affirms the importance of these matters. John Wesley (the founder of Methodism) believed that certain aspects of the Christian Faith required special emphasis. Methodists today still hold to these emphases, known to them as, the 'Four Alls': * All need to be saved ‚Äì \\"All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\\" (Romans 3:23) ‚Äì Sin is a deep-seated self-seeking from which no-one is immune. * All can be saved ‚Äì We can be saved from the consequences of our sin through the work of Jesus Christ on the cross. This is a Gospel ('good news') for everyone ‚Äì \\"God sent the Son into the world... that the world might be saved through him\\" (John 3:17) * All may know themselves saved ‚Äì through the promises in scripture, the intense conviction of God's graciousness to us individually, and a different outlook on life leading to a changed quality of living ‚Äì \\"If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord', and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.\\" (Romans 10:9) * All may be completely saved ‚Äì there can be no limits on what God can do in our lives, as we are continually becoming more and more perfect in love for God and also our fellow humans Structure Knock Methodist Church, Belfast The Methodist Church in Ireland works on a democratic structure. There are no bishops or ordained hierarchy. Authority in the Church is vested in the Conference and the trustees. =Classes= The small group (or 'class') has always been the lifeblood of Methodism... They have different names now, whether an Alpha Home group, prayer triplet, Bible study, or whatever: but the aim is the same ‚Äì to encourage one another in the Faith. =Societies and circuits= These small groups gather, along with other people, to worship together on Sunday and \\"to work and witness in the community throughout the week\\". These congregations (or 'societies') can be linked with up to six or seven other congregations in the local area to form a 'circuit'. The direction of a circuit is guided by the Circuit Executive, composed of one senior minister ('Circuit Superintendent'), other ministers, local preachers and a group of leaders from the member congregations. =Districts= There are 73 Methodist circuits on the island of Ireland, which have been gathered into eight 'districts' to co-ordinate and motivate at a more general geographical level. Each district appoints a Superintendent and a Secretary to oversee the work and provide pastoral support to clergy. =Conference= The annual Conference is usually held over the second weekend of June each year. There are several boards and departments which work at the Connexional level to serve individuals and the Methodist Church in Ireland as a whole. Each year Conference elects an administrative and representative president for 12 months. Social action and education The Methodist Church has made a large contribution to Ireland both through education and social action. =Social action= The church has an emphasis on social action in society. One of the church's mottoes is that the organisation is \\"Friends of all, enemies of none\\". The Methodist Church maintains a number of \\"City Missions\\". Work carried out by the City Missions includes listening services, homeless help, retirement and nursing homes and various other self-help groups. Strongly emphasised is that the relief of social and personal needs are addressed irrespective of creed. The Methodist Church attempts to make a proactive contribution to society as a whole through its Council on Social Responsibility, World Development & Relief Committee and Home missions department. The Church can also claim a positive contribution to the peace process in Northern Ireland. =Education= The Methodist Church maintains two large secondary schools in Ireland, one north and one south. Methodist College Belfast has made a significant contribution to the life of Ireland and internationally, with some distinguished past pupils including Ernest Walton. Its counterpart in the Republic, Wesley College Dublin has a similar reputation. Famous past pupils of Wesley include George Bernard Shaw and Senator Gordon Wilson. The Methodist Church also maintains a number of primary schools in both the Republic and Northern Ireland. In addition to these schools the church also maintains a theological college at Edgehill which has been in existence for over 80 years. Edgehill Theological College is a constituent college of the Queen's University, Belfast and provides a series of undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in theology, part-time courses in faith and worship and other areas of church life as well as correspondence courses and seminars. Edgehill is the ministerial training college for the Methodist Church in Ireland. The church also owns an agricultural college in the Republic of Ireland called Gurteen College. =Children's and youth work= Methodism has a long tradition of organised youth work, currently instigated and supported by the Irish Methodist Youth and Children's Department [IMYC] (formerly Department of Youth and Children's Work). The first full-time general secretary was appointed over thirty years ago. IMYC exists to establish links between the Church and children and young people, so that every generation in the church's life is appreciated and listened to. This involves representing and advocating youth and children's issues within the whole life of the Church as well as providing training to ministers and youth and children's workers. The current general secretary is Gillian Gilmore, and her predecessors have included: Rev Dr David Rock, Rev David Neilands; Rev Dr Johnston McMaster, Rev Winston Good and Rev John Knox, the department's first general secretary. Current members of staff are: Janette McCormick & Nicky Blair (Children's Ministry), Lisa Best, & Gemma Barclay (Youth Ministry), Amy Anderson (Communications) & Leanne Hill (Training & Development). It offers a year out discipleship and evangelism programme known as Team on Mission (TOM) which is currently in its 31st year, members including Amy McSharry, Sara Fullerton and Aaron Sweeney; TOM succeeded the older programme known as Youth Evangelism Team (YET). The Department also runs a number of flagship events such as Follow the Star (an interactive prayer room for under 8s), Soul Mates (For ages 9‚Äì13), Overflow (for young leaders aged 15+) and Autumn Soul (for ages 13+). =The Methodist Newsletter= The Methodist Newsletter is a newsletter produced by the Methodist Church in Ireland every month(except August). Contribution to Northern Ireland 2011 census). The Methodist population is highest in County Fermanagh; south County Antrim and Belfast; the Ards Peninsula; and the Upper Bann valley Eric Gallagher is an example of Methodist people who have made an arguably enormous contribution to the peace process in Northern Ireland. As president of the Methodist Church in Ireland he was the first Protestant churchman who met with IRA representatives in Feakle, County Clare in the 1970s to unsuccessfully try to broker a peace. The meeting was broken up by the Garda S√≠och√°na, but the fugitive IRA men had already left. =Gordon Wilson= Further commitment to the Peace Process was achieved from seeming tragedy in 1987. Gordon Wilson, a member of the Church was the father of Marie Wilson, one of 11 victims of the Enniskillen Remembrance Sunday Parade bombing by the Provisional IRA. He came to national and international prominence with an emotional television interview he gave to the BBC the same evening in which he described his last conversation with his daughter, a nurse, as they both lay buried in rubble. Wilson declared at the end of his interview that he forgave his daughter's killers and urged loyalist paramilitaries not to take revenge for her death. This was seen as a turning point in the peace process, that somebody so soon after such a disaster was able to forgive his own daughter's murderers. His contribution was honoured when he was invited to take a seat in Seanad √âireann by request of the Taoiseach in 1993. In 2005, The Church was once again thrown into the centre of the Peace Process as a former president of The Methodist Church in Ireland, Rev Harold Good, was asked to be an independent witness for the historic decommissioning of IRA arms. Ecumenical relations The Methodist Church is a member of several ecumenical bodies, including the World Council of Churches, the Conference of European Churches, Churches Together in Britain and Ireland, and the Irish Council of Churches. Into the future In 1998 The Methodist Church in Ireland embarked on a period of reflection on its position within Irish Society which it called 'Dreaming Dreams'. Although in many areas of the country the Church is increasing in numbers it is aware that as a whole numbers are decreasing in church membership across the country in every denomination. The church has since published its 'ConneXions' plan. The core vision of ConneXions is that each local Church will reflect the life of Christ in its own area. Each church was asked to participate in a community survey so as to find a policy in each church which will best match the needs of its locality. The Methodist Church hopes that this plan when fully implemented will put the entire connexion in a strong position for regrowth and redevelopment in the 21st Century whilst holding fast to the emphasises of the Wesleyan tradition on which it was formed. In 2002 The Methodist Church in Ireland signed a covenant for greater cooperation and potential ultimate unity with the Church of Ireland. Presidents of the Methodist Church of Ireland Rev.

It was completed and dedicated in 1999 as the church's 60th operating temple and serves church members living in 16 stakes, covering most of Ohio, but also extending into western Pennsylvania and southwestern West Virginia. The temple is in the western edge of Columbus, adjacent to Interstate 270 just north of its western junction with I-70. History The temple was announced by LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley during a visit to Columbus on April 25, 1998, with a groundbreaking held later that year on September 12. Following completion of construction in 1999, an open house was held from August 19 to 28. The open house attracted approximately 30,000 people, including Ohio Governor Bob Taft. The temple was dedicated in six sessions by Hinckley on September 4, 1999, with approximately 11,000 members attending. The dedication of the Columbus Ohio Temple marked the first modern LDS temple in the state and the first since the 1836 dedication of the Kirtland Temple, the first temple built by the Latter Day Saint movement. Kirtland is located approximately northeast of Columbus and was the headquarters of the church for much of the 1830s. Increasing persecution and other factors led to the Kirtland Temple being mostly abandoned by 1838, after most church members moved west to Missouri, eventually relocating to Illinois in 1839 and ultimately present-day Utah in 1847. The Kirtland Temple is today a National Historic Landmark owned and operated by the Community of Christ. The temple is one of nearly 40 that uses the Small Temple Plan. The plan features a marble exterior and art glass windows with two ordinance rooms, two sealing rooms, and a total of . The temple in Columbus was the first of thirteen announced in 1998 using the smaller plans. It was the second such temple completed, and one of nine smaller temples dedicated in 1999 out of a total of 13 dedicated that year. The statue of the angel Moroni atop the spire was originally used on the Monticello Utah Temple and was white instead of the traditional gold. In Monticello, the white proved difficult to see on cloudy days, so the statue there was replaced with a slightly larger gold leaf statue, while the white fiberglass statue was covered in gold leaf and sent to Columbus. In February 2013, a shooting took place in the temple's parking lot in which at least two people were injured. According to an LDS Church spokesperson, the shooting was unrelated to the temple. Along with other LDS temples around the world, the Columbus Ohio Temple was closed in late March 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Later in March, the LDS Church announced that the temple will close for renovation on August 15, 2020, and is anticipated to reopen in late 2022.

Throughout life Angus achieved a name for himself as a man of outstanding physical strength. He was widely reported to be the strongest man on Lewis and possibly Britain. His incredible feats of strength have become folklore on the island, one being the rolling of a large boulder which is still to be seen on the Barvas moor in Lewis. The large boulder, possibly weighing more than a ton, was moved by Angus when he was around 40 years old. In recent times the boulder has been painted white, by someone wishing to ensure that the stone was not forgotten. This stone is marked by a commemorative plaque which was unveiled by Kenneth John Mackay, chairman of the Angus Graham Stone Committee, celebrating the strength of Angus Graham.

It is a clone of both the ColecoVision and Sega SG-1000 consoles, with one cartridge slot for each platform, and came bundled with the game Meteoric Shower, which was built into the system. Telegames never advertised its compatibility with the SG-1000. Hardware The Dina's controllers are modeled after the D-pads made famous by the Nintendo Entertainment System. The cables connecting the system are attached to the side of the controllers, making them difficult to grasp comfortably. Since the controllers are too small to possess numeric keypads, a single numeric keypad is present on the console itself. Any ColecoVision game that requires two keypads cannot be used. A difference in the Dina's controller wiring prevents use of Coleco's Roller Controller and Super Action Controllers and games dependent on either one. The Dina does not include the ColecoVision expansion module interface; ColecoVision games that rely on expansion modules cannot be used. The console is not compatible with all ColecoVision cartridges, partly from its lack of a second numeric keypad. Expansion modules for the ColecoVision are also incompatible, as the expansion port is of a completely different pinout and shape. Some units possess a manufacturer's defect that causes the system to draw too much power into the motherboard, causing damage after long-term play. The Telegames Personal Arcade was advertised as an alternative to the ColecoVision, leaving the function of the Sega SG-1000 cartridge port unexplained. Despite this, SG-1000 games are completely functional.

Watkinson is situated on Bloomfield Avenue adjacent to the University of Hartford. It serves students from 6th through 12th grade. Watkinson also offers a postgraduate option, called The Academy at Watkinson, which allows students who have just graduated from high school to spend an additional year taking courses at Watkinson as well as the University of Hartford. Watkinson is the oldest independent school located within the city limits of Hartford. Currently, Watkinson enrolls 240 students who come from 37 towns all around the Greater Hartford and Pioneer Valley area. Watkinson is a founding member of the Coalition of Essential Schools. It is one of only five schools to be named a Lead School for this coalition. Campus and early school history The organization that became the Watkinson School has its origins in a major bequest of businessman and philanthropist David Watkinson (1778-1857), whose will included provisions for establishing a school for troubled boys. Originally led by noted Hartford educator Henry Barnard, school trustees built Watkinson's bequest to over $200,000 by 1880. In that year, a farm was purchased on Park Street, and the institution was opened as a school and working farm known as the Watkinson Juvenile Asylum and Farm School. In 1892, under the leadership of Rev. Francis Goodwin, the school leased land on the Prosser Farm at the corner of Albany Street and Bloomfield Avenue, which had been purchased by Goodwin for the Handicraft School, an organization whose leadership was identical to that of the Watkinson School. The Watkinson School facilities were built on this land at the northern end, while those of the Handicraft School were located in its south. The land occupied by the Watkinson School was formally transferred to the school in 1949. The school formally adopted the name \\"Watkinson School\\" in 1923. The school campus is located at 140, 180, and 190 Bloomfield Avenue in Hartford and West Hartford. The complex consists of nine buildings on about , most of which (including all of the buildings) is in Hartford. Feringa Hall is the oldest academic building on the campus, built in 1894-5 to a Queen Anne design attributed to Francis Goodwin. Residence houses, originally for the headmaster and his assistant, date to the early 20th century. Frances Goodwin Hall is a two-story brick classroom building with attached gymnasium, built in 1924. The campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

The format inspired a further series of sf doubles published by Tor Books between 1988 and 1991, the Tor Double Novels.

Phillifent Life With Lancelot / William Barton Hunting on Kunderer (August 1973) Serial number 48245, above, was the last Ace Double published in the t√™te-b√™che format. The remainder of the books listed in this section contain two novels, but are published in the traditional way with a single cover and the text the same way up throughout the book. Another Ace SF double(G-723-Andre Norton-Star Hunter/Voodoo Planet) was published in 1968 as a traditional reprint in the second G series (begun in 1964). G-723 was the only traditionally printed SF double included in that series and thus does not fit under any of the categories listed here. *66995 SF Mack Reynolds The Rival Rigelians / Planetary Agent X (June 1974) *14250 SF Mack Reynolds Depression Or Bust / Dawnman Planet (September 1974) *20571 SF Samuel R.

Early life Born in Glasgow, Hulett discovered traditional music as an early teen and began playing the folk circuit in New Zealand in 1968, after immigrating with his family. By 1971, he relocated to Australia continuing to perform at festivals. In the early 1980s Hulett founded the folk punk five piece, Roaring Jack, and opened for international acts such as Billy Bragg, The Pogues and The Men They Couldn't Hang. The band was nominated for two ARIA Music Awards during their career.Alistair's Biography Folk Icons. Accessed 30 January 2010. Solo career Hullett's first solo CD, Dance of the Underclass, was released in 1991 and was completely acoustic, featuring contributions from other members of Roaring Jack, and a rendition of The Internationale. \\"Dance of the Underclass\\" established Hulett as a key contemporary Australian writer, with several of the songs now regarded as modern Australian standards. One of the CD's songs He Fades Away, concerning the death of an Australian blue asbestos miner, was covered by Roy Bailey and June Tabor, and later by Andy Irvine. Both He Fades Away and Blue Murder were featured on the Niamh Parsons album Old Simplicity. A second album, In The Back Streets Of Paradise, was released in 1994, and was a collection of songs originally intended as the next Roaring Jack's release. This CD featured long- term collaborator, Jimmy Gregory, with whom Hulett played in a duo for many years on the Sydney folk circuit. The release of In The Back Streets of Paradise coincided with the formation of a new touring band Alistair Hulett and The Hooligans, featuring Lindsay Martin (fiddle), John Deery (uilleann pipes), Jimmy Gregory (Bouzouki), James Fagan (Bouzouki and clarinet) and Phil Murray (accordion). Later music In addition to his solo albums, Hulett worked with Dave Swarbrick of Fairport Convention, producing three albums, and towards the end of his life, formed a new band, The Malkies, with whom he released one album.The Malkies The Malkies. Accessed 29 January 2010. He also sang on six songs on the Linn Records 12 CD Complete Songs of Robert Burns project. Political beliefs In 1991 while living in Australia, Hulett joined the International Socialist Organisation after becoming radicalised by the Gulf War. In 1995, Hulett co-founded the Australian Trotskyist organisation Socialist Alternative, while often playing political benefits and rallies with Roaring Jack. Hulett wrote songs in support of Indigenous Australians, the Builders Labourers Federation, the Maritime Union of Australia, Scottish socialist John Maclean and Chilean singer-songwriter and political activist Victor Jara, and songs attacking Stalinism, Australian Imperialism, former Australian Labor Party Prime Ministers Bob Hawke and Ben Chifley, Postmodernists and Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen over his support for Israel.Alistair Hulett - comrade and friend Socialist Alternative, 30 January 2010.

Begun after the success of Lynch's 1977 film Eraserhead, Ronnie Rocket was shelved after Lynch felt he would be unable to find financial backing for the project. He instead sought out an existing script on which to base his next film, settling on what would become 1980's The Elephant Man. Ronnie Rocket was to feature many of the elements which have since come to be seen as Lynch's hallmarks, including industrial art direction, 1950s popular culture and physical deformity. The script featured a three-foot tall man with control over electricity; Lynch first met Michael J. Anderson when tentatively casting for this role, and later cast him in Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive as a result. Overview Ronnie Rocket concerned the story of a detective seeking to enter a mysterious second dimension, aided by his ability to stand on one leg. He is being obstructed on this quest by a strange landscape of odd rooms and a threatening train; while being stalked by the \\"Donut Men\\", who wield electricity as a weapon. In addition to the detective's story, the film was to show the tale of Ronald d'Arte, a teenage dwarf, who suffers a surgical mishap which leaves him dependent on being plugged into an electrical supply at regular intervals; this dependence grants him an affinity over electricity which he can use to produce music or cause destruction. The boy names himself Ronnie Rocket and becomes a rock star, befriending a tap-dancer named Electra-Cute. The film was to make use of several themes that have since become recurring elements within David Lynch's works, with a write-up for The A.V. Club describing its contents as \\"idealized 1950s culture, industrial design, midgets, [and] physical deformity\\". In addition, the film features two separate but connected worlds, another hallmark of Lynch's writings. The film's art direction would have featured a heavily industrial backdrop, setting the action against an \\"oil slick, smokestack, steel-steam-soot, fire-sparks and electrical arcs realm\\", similar to the direction ultimately taken in the depiction of Victorian England in The Elephant Man and the planet Giedi Prime in Dune. Although Lynch's first two feature-length films were shot in black-and-white, he had hoped to film Ronnie Rocket in color, inspired by the works of French film-maker Jacques Tati. Lynch planned to experiment for some time in order to find the right balance and application of color for the film. Background Michael J. Anderson was considered for the title role, which led to his involvement in Twin Peaks. After releasing 1977's Eraserhead, a black-and-white surrealist film and his d√©but feature-length production, Lynch began work on the screenplay for Ronnie Rocket. Lynch and his agent Marty Michaelson, of William Morris Endeavor, initially attempted to find financial backing for the project. They met with one film studio on the matter, with Lynch describing the film to them as being \\"about electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair\\"; the studio never got in touch again. Lynch also met Stuart Cornfeld during this time. Cornfeld had enjoyed Eraserhead and was interested in producing Ronnie Rocket; Cornfeld was working for Mel Brooks and Brooksfilms at the time, and when the two realized that Ronnie Rocket was unlikely to find sufficient financing to be produced, Lynch asked to see some already-written scripts to work from for his next film instead. Cornfeld found four scripts he felt Lynch would be interested in, but on hearing the name of the first, the director decided his next project would be The Elephant Man. Lynch would return to Ronnie Rocket after each of his films, intending it at different stages as the follow-up not only to Eraserhead or The Elephant Man, but also Dune, Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me. After producing The Elephant Man, Lynch had planned to cast Dexter Fletcher in the title role. Brad Dourif, Dennis Hopper, Jack Nance, Isabella Rossellini, Harry Dean Stanton, and Dean Stockwell have also been considered for possible roles in the film at various times; each has worked with Lynch on other projects. In 1987, after having released Blue Velvet, Lynch once again attempted to pursue Ronnie Rocket. While scouting actors for the eponymous role, Lynch met Michael J. Anderson, whose work in short films the director had previously seen. As a direct result of meeting Anderson during this time, Lynch would cast the actor in a recurring role in the television series Twin Peaks, with his first appearance coming in 1990's \\"Episode 2\\". Anderson would also appear in Lynch's 1990 short film Industrial Symphony No. 1, and the 2001 film Mulholland Drive. Lynch also visited northern England to scout a possible filming location; however, he found that the industrial cities he had hoped to use had become too modernized to fit his intended vision. The project has also suffered setbacks due to the bankruptcy of several potential backers; both Dino De Laurentiis's De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and Francis Ford Coppola's American Zoetrope were attached to the project at different times; both production companies went bankrupt before work could begin. Lynch had stayed with Coppola in the latter's home in Napa County, California, while Coppola and musician Sting read the script several times; however the failure of 1982's One from the Heart forced Zoetrope to file for bankruptcy. Legacy Having been temporarily unable to begin production on the film for some time, due to De Laurentiis owning the rights, Lynch stopped actively pursuing Ronnie Rocket as a viability in the early 1990s. However, he has never officially abandoned the project; frequently referring to it in interviews as \\"hibernating\\". The director has expressed interest in filming the project in the same manner as Eraserhead, using a small crew, building the sets himself and living on them during the length of the production. He has also claimed that he will revisit the film when he is at the stage in his career \\"when I don't really care what happens, except that the film is finished\\". However, in a 2013 interview, Lynch expressed the view that the passage of time‚Äîand the decline of \\"smokestack industry\\"‚Äîwas making it more difficult to envisage the film, stating \\"It was still really alive in the ‚Äô50s and ‚Äô60s, but this industry is going away [‚Ä¶] And then a thing happened. This thing called graffiti. Graffiti to me is one of the worst things that has happened to the world. It completely ruined the mood of places. Graffiti kills the possibility to go back in time and have the buildings be as they were. Cheap storm windows and graffiti have ruined the world for Ronnie Rocket\\". Speaking of the film's difficulty in attracting financing, Fletcher has said \\"I should imagine that the big money heads at whatever studio it was couldn't get their brains round it at all. It's fine for the artist to read and enjoy, but for accountants it was probably a very different proposition. But that's David Lynch all over in a lot of ways\\". The Guardian Danny Leigh has compared the script's reputation among film fans to those of Sergei Eisenstein's unproduced adaptation of An American Tragedy and Michael Powell's unmade adaptation of The Tempest. Leigh recalled having read a photocopied version of the script in the early 1990s, and felt that it \\"might have aged far better than Wild at Heart\\". Filmmaker Jonathan Caouette has expressed interest in reviving the project, though he believes Lynch will \\"do it someday\\".

Stating that slalom skiing was the best event, the magazine concluded that \\"Epyx does such a nice, consistent job of execution, tho, that it's hard to take off too many points even for such boring material\\". Computer Gaming Worlds Rick Teverbaugh criticized the slalom skiing and log rolling events' difficulty, but concluded that \\"World Games is still a must for the avid sports games\\". Charles Ardai called the game \\"an adequate sequel\\" to Epyx's previous Games, and praised the graphics. He criticized the mechanics \\"as bizarre little joystick patterns which have little to do with the events\\" but still recommended the game because of the log rolling event. Jame Trunzo praised the game's use of advanced graphics and sound, including humorous effects. Also noted was the variety in the included games, preventing the game from getting too repetitive.

Postville is inaccessible by road and may be reached only by air or sea. In the 18th century, the Franco-Canadian merchant Louis Fornel landed near the present site of Rigolet and claimed the land for France in 1743. The Franco-Canadians established trading posts in Kaipokok Bay at that time. The English took control of the Labrador coast in 1763 after the Seven Years' War. This brought a flood of European fishermen and whalers to settle on the Labrador coast. Around 1784, Pierre Marcoux and Louis Marchand reopened the old Kaipokok trading post. In 1795, the Moravian Brothers of Hopedale observed that Pierre Marcoux and the former partner of George Cartwright Collingham were the first Europeans to settle in Kaipokok Bay. In order to compete with the Moravians, the Hudson's Bay Company established a coastal trading post in Kaipokok Bay in 1837 shortly after Rigolet. The counter was operated until 1878. The village was first known as The Post because of the Hudson's Bay Company trading post located in the area. Inuit families traded in the fall, winter and spring before returning to the coastal camps in the summer. The village was renamed Postville in the 1940s by a pastor who helped establish the community by building a school and a church.

In computer terms, a port generally refers to the part of a computing device available for connection to peripherals such as input and output devices. Computer ports have many uses, to connect a monitor, webcam, speakers, or other peripheral devices. On the physical layer, a computer port is a specialized outlet on a piece of equipment to which a plug or cable connects. Electronically, the several conductors where the port and cable contacts connect, provide a method to transfer signals between devices. Bent pins are easier to replace on a cable than on a connector attached to a computer, so it was common to use connectors for the fixed side of an interface. Computer ports in common use cover a wide variety of shapes such as round (PS/2, etc.), rectangular (FireWire, etc.), square (Telephone plug), trapezoidal (D-Sub ‚Äî the old printer port was a DB-25), etc. There is some standardization to physical properties and function. For instance, most computers have a keyboard port (currently a Universal Serial Bus USB-like outlet referred to as USB Port), into which the keyboard is connected. Physically identical connectors may be used for widely different standards, especially on older personal computer systems, or systems not generally designed according to the current Microsoft Windows compatibility guides. For example, a 9-pin D-subminiature connector on the original IBM PC could have been used for monochrome video, color analog video (in two incompatible standards), a joystick interface, or for a MIDI musical instrument digital control interface. The original IBM PC also had two identical 5 pin DIN connectors, one used for the keyboard, the second for a cassette recorder interface; the two were not interchangeable. The smaller mini-DIN connector has been variously used for the keyboard and two different kinds of mouse; older Macintosh family computers used the mini-DIN for a serial port or for a keyboard connector with different standards than the IBM-descended systems. Electrical signal transfer Electronically, hardware ports can almost always be divided into two groups based on the signal transfer: * Serial ports send and receive one bit at a time via a single wire pair (Ground and +/-). * Parallel ports send multiple bits at the same time over several sets of wires. After ports are connected, they typically require handshaking, where transfer type, transfer rate, and other necessary information is shared before data is sent. Hot-swappable ports can be connected while equipment is running. Almost all ports on personal computers are hot-swappable. Plug-and-play ports are designed so that the connected devices automatically start handshaking as soon as the hot-swapping is done. USB ports and FireWire ports are plug-and-play. Auto-detect or auto-detection ports are usually plug-and-play, but they offer another type of convenience. An auto-detect port may automatically determine what kind of device has been attached, but it also determines what purpose the port itself should have. For example, some sound cards allow plugging in several different types of audio speakers; then a dialogue box pops up on the computer screen asking whether the speaker is left, right, front, or rear for surround sound installations. The user's response determines the purpose of the port, which is physically a 1/8\\" tip-ring-sleeve mini jack. Some auto- detect ports can even switch between input and output based on context. As of 2006, manufacturers have nearly standardized colors associated with ports on personal computers, although there are no guarantees. The following is a short list: * Orange, purple, or grey: Keyboard PS/2 * Green: Mouse PS/2 * Blue or magenta: Parallel printer DB-25 * Amber: Serial DB-25 or DB-9 * Pastel pink: Microphone 1/8\\" stereo (TRS) minijack * Pastel green: Speaker 1/8\\" stereo (TRS) minijack FireWire ports used with video equipment (among other devices) can be either 4-pin or 6-pin. The two extra conductors in the 6-pin connection carry electrical power. This is why a self-powered device such as a camcorder often connects with a cable that is 4-pins on the camera side and 6-pins on the computer side, the two power conductors simply being ignored. This is also why laptop computers usually have only 4-pin FireWire ports, as they cannot provide enough power to meet requirements for devices needing the power provided by 6-pin connections. Optical (light) fiber, microwave, and other technologies (i.e., quantum) have different kinds of connections, as metal wires are not effective for signal transfers with these technologies. Optical connections are usually a polished glass or plastic interface, possibly with an oil that lessens refraction between the two interface surfaces. Microwaves are conducted through a pipe, which can be seen on a large scale by examining microwave towers with \\"funnels\\" on them leading to pipes. Hardware port trunking (HPT) is a technology that allows multiple hardware ports to be combined into a single group, effectively creating a single connection with a higher fault tolerance because a failure on one port may just mean a slow-down rather than a dropout. By contrast, in software port trunking (SPT), two agents (websites, channels, etc.) are bonded into one with the same effectiveness; i.e., ISDN B1 (64K) plus B2 (64K) equals data throughput of 128K.

As Syria was one of the earliest centers of Christianity, its style of chant is among the oldest in the world. However, as no early musical manuscripts exist, it is conjectural to what extent the modern repertoire reflects the early traditions. In the early church, the music consisted of hymns and antiphonal psalmody. The earliest extant work is the Gnostic Psalter of the 2nd century, a collection of Psalm texts in hymn form reflecting a Gnostic theology. The first orthodox work are the hymns of Ephrem the Syrian (306‚Äì373), some of which are still used today. Both hymns and antiphonal psalmody were brought by St. Ambrose to Milan and are apparently the basis for Ambrosian chant. Modern Syrian chant is much more rhythmic and syllabic than Gregorian chant. Syriac Chants from South India. The Christian liturgy that developed in Syriac as the Christian Aramaic came to be known in the early Christian era) flourished in South India.

In a long career, Coborn was known largely for two comic songs: \\"Two Lovely Black Eyes\\", and \\"The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo.\\" Biography He was born in Stepney, east London, and adopted his stage name from Coborn Road, near Mile End. He made his music hall debut on the Isle of Dogs in 1872, and by 1879 was being billed at the Oxford Music Hall in London as \\"The Comic of the Day\\". In 1886, he heard American William J. Scanlan's song \\"My Nellie's Blue Eyes\\". Liking the melody but not the words, Coborn rewrote it as \\"Two Lovely Black Eyes\\", and began performing it regularly wearing a faded frock coat, carrying a battered umbrella and with two blackened eyes. He premi√®red it at the Paragon Theatre, in the Mile End Road, and the song was instantly successful. In 1891, he bought the rights to Fred Gilbert's song, \\"The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo\\". When Gilbert first offered the song, Coborn was reluctant to adopt it. In his autobiography he stated: \\"[I] liked the tune very much, especially the chorus, but I was rather afraid that some of the phrasing was rather too highbrow for an average music hall audience.\\" But when he found that he could not get the chorus out of his head, he changed his mind. The song became a staple of his act, and he performed it on tour in different languages throughout the world. Coborn later estimated that he had performed the song 250,000 times in the course of his career, and could sing it in 14 languages.The Glory of Music Hall, Neil Kellas 2007 Coborn confirmed that Gilbert's inspiration was the gambler and confidence trickster Charles Wells, who was reported to have won one-and-a-half million francsThe Times, 13 July 1893 at the Monte Carlo casino, using the profits from previous fraud.Michael Kilgarriff (1998) Sing Us One of the Old Songs: A Guide to Popular Song 1860‚Äì1920Coborn, C.: The Man who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo (pp. 227‚Äì8): (London: Hutchinson, c. 1928) Coborn's other, less successful, songs included \\"Should Husbands Work?\\", in which he took up the music hall tradition of (normally conservative) social comment; \\"I've Loved Another Girl Since Then\\"; \\"He's All Right When You Know Him\\"; and \\"I've Never Turned Money Away\\", which created controversy when Coborn performed it in the stereotyped manner of a Jew in a Jewish-owned theatre. He apologised afterwards, but was banned from appearing at the venue again. He toured extensively, and performed in New York City and Toronto in 1900. Described as a 'literate man of high principles', he was never fully accepted by the music hall establishment, but undertook much charitable work in the First World War and later in efforts to improve the conditions of music hall entertainers. He continued to make occasional appearances, including a performance in the 1943 film Variety Jubilee at the age of 91. He died in London in 1945. He is buried with his wife in Brompton Cemetery, London. Recordings that he made in the 1920s can be found on the Chairman's Choice ‚Äì Music Hall Greats album.

The four daughters - Anna (the oldest), Louisa (one year younger), Elizabeth (three years younger than Louisa), and Abigail (the youngest, five years younger than Elizabeth) - lived in Orchard House from 1858-1877. History The Alcotts had first moved to Concord in 1840, although they left in 1843 to start Fruitlands,Amos Bronson Alcott Network - Concord a utopian agrarian commune in nearby Harvard. The family returned in 1845 and purchased a house named \\"Hillside,\\"Louisa May at the official site but left again in 1852, selling to Nathaniel Hawthorne, who renamed it The Wayside. The Alcotts returned to Concord once again in 1857. They moved into Orchard House - which was then a two-story clapboard farmhouse - in the spring of 1858.Saxton, Martha. Louisa May Alcott: A Modern Biography. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1995: 218. At the time of purchase the site included two early eighteenth-century houses on a 12-acre (49,000m2) apple orchard. Consequently, the Alcotts named the property \\"Orchard House.\\" \\"'Tis a pretty retreat,\\" Bronson Alcott wrote soon after moving in, \\"and ours; a family mansion to take pride in, rescued as it is from deformity and disgrace.\\" Bronson Alcott made significant changes to the building. He installed alcoves for busts retrieved from his failed Temple School, repaired the staircase, installed bookcases, constructed a back studio for his youngest daughter May's artwork, and installed a rustic fence around the property. He also moved a smaller tenant house to adjoin the rear of the main house, making a single larger structure. While the home was being renovated, the family rented rooms next door at The Wayside while the Hawthornes were living in England.Matteson, John. Eden's Outcasts: The Story of Louisa May Alcott and Her Father. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2007: 238. Later, Lydia Maria Child visited the house and recorded her thoughts: \\"The result is a house full of queer nooks and corners and all manner of juttings in and out. It seems as if the spirit of some old architect had brought it from the Middle Ages and dropped it down in Concord...The whole house leaves a general impression of harmony, of a medieval sort.\\"Saxton, Martha. Louisa May Alcott: A Modern Biography. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1995: 337. Orchard House is adjacent to The Wayside on the historic \\"American Mile\\" roadway toward Lexington, and is less than a half- mile from Bush, the home of Ralph Waldo Emerson,Lexington Rd, Google Maps where Henry David Thoreau and the Alcotts were frequent visitors. The Alcotts in Residence Orchard House was the most permanent home of the Alcotts, with the family in residence from 1858 to 1877. During this period, the family included Bronson, his wife Abigail May, and their daughters Anna, Louisa, and May. Elizabeth, the model for Beth March, had died in March 1858, just weeks before the family moved in. Orchard House, 1941 The Alcott girls befriended the Hawthorne children, who lived next door, though Nathaniel Hawthorne himself was elusive. Bronson Alcott was disappointed, and recorded: \\"Nobody gets a chance to speak with him unless by accident.\\" However, he added, \\"Still he has a tender kindly side, and a voice that a woman might own, the hesitance is so taking, and the tones so remote from what you expected.\\"Saxton, Martha.

The Alcotts were vegetarians, and harvested fruits and vegetables from the gardens and orchard on the property.The Dining Room at the official site Conversations about abolitionism, women's suffrage, and social reform were often held around the dining room table. The family performed theatricals using the dining room as their stage while guests watched from the adjoining parlor. The parlor was a formal room with arched niches built by Bronson to display busts of his favorite philosophers, Socrates and Plato.The Parlor at the official site On May 23, 1860, Anna married John Bridge Pratt in this room. The youngest daughter, May, was a talented artist.May at the official site Her bedroom contains sketches of angelic, mythological, and biblical figures on the woodwork and doors.May's Room at the official site In Louisa's room, May painted a panel of calla lilies as well as an owl on the fireplace.Louisa's Room at the official site Copies of Turner landscapes by May adorn various rooms in Orchard House. In 1868, Louisa May Alcott wrote her beloved classic novel, Little Women, in her room on a special \\"shelf desk\\" built by her father. Set within the house, its characters are based on members of her family, with the plot loosely based on the family's earlier years and events that transpired at The Wayside. Also written in the house were Bronson Alcott's Ralph Waldo Emerson (1865; published 1882), Tablets (1868), Concord Days (1872), and Table Talk (1877). On the grounds to the west of the house is a structure designed and built by Bronson Alcott originally known as \\"Hillside Chapel,\\" and later as \\"The Concord School of Philosophy.\\" Operating from 1879 to 1888, the School was one of the first highly successful adult education centers in the country. In 1877, Louisa May Alcott bought a home on Main Street for her sister Anna. After Mrs. Alcott's death in the same year, Louisa and her father moved into the home as well. Orchard House was then sold to long-time family friend William Torrey Harris in 1884.Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States.

Bush and First Lady Laura Bush. She lived with the Bush family for almost two decades. Biography The Bushes acquired India, an all-black, female American Shorthair, as a kitten in late 1991 or 1992 when their twin daughters Barbara and Jenna Bush were nine years old. India remained with George and Laura Bush once their daughters left for college. The cat moved with the Bushes to the White House from the Texas Governor's Mansion in Austin in early 2001 following Bush's inauguration as President. Despite living at the White House with the First Family, India had been largely overshadowed in the media by two of the Bushes' more famous Scottish terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley. However, she's seen in the \\"Barneycam\\" videos produced by the White House staff around Christmas time, her first being Where in the White House is Miss Beazley?, where she was referred to as \\"Willie\\". The dogs received significantly more media attention from the White House press corps during the Bush presidency. The Bush family cat made an appearance in the March 2008 Architectural Digest, as \\"Willie\\", in the East Sitting Hall of the White House.\\"At Home with History in the White House\\", Architectural Digest, March 2008 India died at the White House on January 4, 2009, at the age of 18.Gillman, Todd J., Bush family cat dies at White House Dallas Morning News, 2009-01-05, retrieved 2009-01-05 In a statement to the press regarding India's death, a spokesperson for First Lady noted that the family was deeply saddened by their cat's death, and went on to say India was a beloved member of the Bush family for almost two decades. She will be greatly missed. Controversy in India There was some controversy reported in India as some people were upset with the cat's name. In July 2004, demonstrators in the southern Keralian city of Thiruvananthapuram denounced the cat's name as an insult to the nation of India, and burned an effigy of President Bush in protest. The Bushes did not change the cat's name in response to the demonstrations, as their cat had been named after the baseball player Rub√©n Sierra, who was nicknamed \\"El Indio\\" during his time with the Texas Rangers when Bush owned the team. The name \\"India\\" had reportedly been given to the family cat by their daughter Barbara Bush.

Identified as the ancient town of Yizre'el (Jezreel), it was known as Zir'in during Islamic rule, and was near the site of the Battle of Ain Jalut, in which the Mamluks halted Mongol expansion southward. Under the Ottomans, it was a small village, expanding during the British Mandate in the early 20th century. After its capture by Israel in 1948, Zir'in was destroyed. The Israeli moshav of Yizre'el was established shortly after on the village lands of Zir'in. Etymology Derived from a common Canaanite root meaning to \\"sow\\", Yizre'el translates in Hebrew as \\"God give seed\\" and its Arabic name \\"Zir'in\\" has a similar connotation.Khalidi, 1992, p.339. The Crusaders referred to it as \\"le Petit Gerin\\" or \\"the Little Jenin\\" to distinguish it from Jenin, which they called \\"le Grand Gerin\\". In Latin literature of the time it was called \\"Gezrael\\", \\"Iezrael\\", \\"Parvum Gerinum\\" or \\"Zarain\\".Pringle, 1997, p. 56. History =Bronze and Iron Ages= Zir'in is identified with the Canaanite town of Yizre'el mentioned in the Bible. =Crusader period= A vaulted building and other structures remain from a castle that belonged to the Templars by the 1180s. During the Battle of al-Fule, Saladin has sent skirmishers to raid then Crusader-held Zir'in in October 1183.Lyons and Jackson, 1984, p.207. In September 1184, Saladin and his Ayyubid forces passed through the village on their way to Nablus. =Mamluk period= After the Mamluks took control of the area in the late 13th century, the Mamluk sultan Zahir Baybars defeated the Mongols in the Battle of Ain Jalut, at a site just west of Zir'in. After the battle, Baybars ordered the renovation of the village mosque. During the Mamluk period the village was one of the stops on the postal route between Jenin and Irbid.Sauvavet, 1941, p. 74-75. Quoted in Petersen, 2001, p. 322 =Ottoman period= In 1517, Zir'in was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire along with the rest of Palestine, and in 1596 it was a part of the nahiya (\\"subdistrict\\") of Jinin, a part of Sanjak Lajjun. A village of 4 Muslim households, it paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat, barley, beehives, and goats; a total of 5,000 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 160 In the 17th and 18th centuries the village was most likely under the control of the Turabay, an Arab tribe that ruled part of northern Palestine on behalf of the Ottomans at the time.Cohen, cited by Petersen, 2001, p. 322 In 1799, Pierre Jacotin named the village Zezin on his map from the French campaign in Egypt and Syria.Karmon, 1960, p. 169 In 1838, Edward Robinson said Zir'in contained about 20 houses.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, pp. 161-167 In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine found Zir'in as consisting of about thirty houses, with the most prominent family living in a tall, tower-like house in the village center. A spring and well supplied Zir'in with water.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, pp.88, 131, quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.339. The Ottomans founded a boys' school in the village. =British Mandate= General view of Zir'in with its mosque in background, 1918 In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Zir'in had a population of 727; 723 Muslims and 4 Christians,Barron, 1923, Table IX, Sub- district of Jenin, p. 29 all 4 Christians were Orthodox.Barron, 1923, Table XV, p. 47 In the 1931 census this had increased to a population of 978 persons; 975 Muslims and 3 Christians, in 239 inhabited houses.Mills, 1932, p. 72 In the early 20th century, Zir'in was the birthplace of Mahmud Salim, a leader of the 1936-39 revolt in Palestine. The majority of the village's houses were constructed of mud and were clustered together, but house building and renovation also expanded. The commercial center of Zir'in consisted of the Mosque of Baybars, a marketplace, and the Ottoman school. Residents mainly cultivated grains, fruits, and vegetables. In the 1945 statistics, the population was 1,420, all Muslims,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 17 with a total of 23,920 dunams of land. In 1944/45 a total of 22,595 dunums of village land was allocated to cereals,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 100 while 81 dunams were built-up (urban) areas.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 150 =1948 war= Zir'in, after occupation, on 30 January 1949 Prior to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, in March 1948, Zir'in's defenders, the Arab Liberation Army (ALA), reported that the Haganah had attempted several times to capture the village, but their assaults were suspended for ten days after heavy losses. On April 19, Zir'in was briefly captured, and most of the village houses were ordered destroyed, while the remainder were to be used to accommodate Jewish troops.Morris, 1987, p.159, quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.339. Controlled by the ALA, Zir'in was located in a strategic commanding position overlooking the towns of Afula and Baysan. The fear of Iraqi forces from Gesher in the east and Jenin in the south to form a \\"spearhead\\" and capture the Baysan and Jezreel valleys convinced the Jews to take Zir'in. After a mortar barrage to soften its defense, the village was captured on May 28 by the Thirteenth Battalion of the Golani Brigade with \\"little resistance\\". Women and children fled weeks prior to its capture,Morris, 2004, p. 75 and after word had spread of its capture, the residents of nearby Nuris and al-Mazar also abandoned their villages. The ALA unsuccessfully attempted to recapture Zir'in two days later.Tal, 2004, p.258. On July 10, the Iraqi Army based in Jenin, intended to recapture the village, but were unable to break through Israeli lines, followed by another unsuccessful attempt on July 19, after the second truce of the war. The final armistice line was drawn just to the south of Zir'in. =Israel= Following the war, the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. The kibbutz of Yizre'el was established on the northwestern side of Zir'in in August 1948.Khalidi, 1992, p.340. The tower house The Tower House, early 1880s In the 19th century this was described as the Castle of Zir'in, which was used as an inn (manzil) for travellers.Wilson, 1884, II p.27. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 322 A representative for the Palestine Antiquities Museum (PAM), Mr Husseini, visited Zir'in in 1941, and noted: \\"S-E. of Church in a lane a part of a wall about 8m. long with two rough courses of masonry...S. within house of Abdul Karim Abdul Hadi in an open yard more building foundations are visible to N. two medieval vaults known as el-Uqud.\\"Petersen, 2001, p. 322 Pringle believes the vaults are part of the destroyed Crusader castle, but according to Petersen, they could equally well be from the Mamluk time. Petersen, who inspected the place in 1994, notes that the appearance of the building indicate that it was constructed over a long period of time. Geography Situated on a plateau off the Mount Gilboa, Zir'in was not much higher than the surrounding Jezreel Valley at its southern and western sides, with an average elevation of above sea level. To the north and east was Wadi al-Jalut. Located north of Jenin, it was the northernmost locality in the Jenin District, and alongside a lateral road linking two highways; one towards Jenin, the other towards Baysan. Nearby localities included Nuris to the southeast, Sandala to the south, Zububa to the southwest, Sulam to the north, and Qumya to the northeast.Satellite view of Zir'in Palestine Remembered. In 1945, it consisted of 23,920 dunams. The majority of the village lands (20,964 dunams) were allocated for cereals, while the built-up area of Zir'in consisted of 81 dunams. Demographics Zir'in had a population of 22 in 1596 according to Ottoman records. In 1922, a British Mandate survey recorded a population of 722,Welcome to Zir'in Palestine Remembered. rising to 978 in the 1931 census.

This brotherhood was one of the largest and oldest brotherhoods of Piva. recorded 45 houses of Tadiƒá in Piva. They have for long lived in Smrijeƒçno (in Plu≈æine), where they are mainly concentrated, while one or two houses exist in Potprisoje, Donja Brezna and Stabna, which they settled later.

They are most famous for their 1990 album, Bezerk which made the Top 40 in the UK Albums Chart and spawned the hit singles \\"Love Bomb Baby\\" and \\"Heaven\\". The band reformed in 2005. Formation and early years Tigertailz (originally called Stagefright) formed in 1983 after bassist Pepsi Tate and drummer Ian Welch placed an advert in the Cardiff record store, Spillers Records, looking for a guitarist. Jay Pepper answered the advert. Local guitarist Phil Harling and singer Jim Dovey joined and the band began to write and record demos, although the demos were never released. The band began to get gigs and they started to amass a local following, however lead singer Jim Dovey soon left the band therefore Pepper and Tate placed an advert in the National Sounds magazine and vocalist Steevi Jaimz answered the call and joined the band. Welch left the band in 1984 and was finally replaced with Ace Finchum. Commercial success (1987-1995) Part of the nascent glam metal scene in the late 1980s, Tigertailz first line-up issued their debut album, Young And Crazy, in 1987. The album featured vocalist Steevi Jaimz, guitarist Jay Pepper, bassist Pepsi Tate and drummer Ace Finchum. The debut album also provided their first single, \\"Livin' Without You\\". As the band toured, vocalist Steevi Jaimz was not fully committed to the band, and several instances of fighting were recorded. The band recruited Kim Hooker to replace Jaimz in time for follow-up album, Bezerk, which was released in 1990 on the Music For Nations label. Prior to the release of Bezerk, the band re-recorded \\"Livin Without' You\\" with Hooker as vocalist, and released it as a single. Bezerk saw the band breakthrough as a headline act, and delivering three singles, \\"Love Bomb Baby\\",Ray Zell \\"The Bomb Party\\", Kerrang, June 1989 (copy online at Klassickerranginterviews.weebly.com). Retrieved 2013-05-24. \\"Noise Level Critical\\" and \\"Heaven\\". The album peaked at No. 36 in the UK Albums Chart. They released Banzai!, a collection of B-sides and re-recorded tracks, in 1991 in Japan. They also issued Wazbones in 1995, by which time the Hooker- Pepper-Tate-Finchum line-up had fragmented, and was replaced by the Hooker- Danahar-Tate-Skinner line-up. Touring proved successful, but there was insufficient record label interest to sustain the band. Reunion (2005-2009) In 2005, the band reformed their classic line-up, with the addition of former City Kidds drummer Matt Blakout, who replaced Andy Skinner. The band won a court order winning ownership of the Tigertailz name from a spin-off band fronted by Steevi Jaimz. This problem resolved, Tigertailz were able to work on Bezerk 2.0. They completed a short reunion tour of the UK, culminating in some festival dates in Sweden and Spain, playing to over 70,000 people with Whitesnake and Twisted Sister. Kerrang! magazine wrote in praise of the reunion; journalist Steve Beebee describing it as \\"persistently entertaining, with monstrous melodies that reach delirious peaks\\". Bezerk 2.0 was released through Demolition Records on 7 August 2006. Bass player Pepsi Tate was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2007. The band signed a new recording contract with Sanctuary Records, and released Thrill Pistol on 27 August 2007, barely a year after their previous album release. This release was a double album, packaged with the original 1992 version of the Wazbones album, that had never been officially released. Beebee again wrote in praise of the album in Kerrang!, calling on fans to \\"kindly hail this rejuvenated band for the time-defying devils they are\\". Following Tate's death in September 2007, Tigertailz continued to tour with former City Kidds lead guitarist, Glenn 'Nailz' Quinn, playing bass. As well as numerous European festival shows, they supported ex-Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley in the UK, and performed at the UK's Hard Rock Hell Festival in both 2008 and 2009. Bezerk anniversary (2010) In January 2010, Tigertailz recruited Sarah Firebrand as their new bass player. They also announced that they would be playing Bezerk, originally released in 1990, in its entirety and in sequence at some subsequent live shows. Some of these performances were recorded for use as a future live album. After playing a show at the Fuel Rock Club in Cardiff on 17 April to raise money for the Amser Justin Time charity set up in Pepsi Tate's memory, the band headlined the Stockholm Rock Out Festival in Sweden on 1 May. Following further 'Bezerk Live' dates, Tigertailz replaced drummer Matt Blakout with former Rachel Stamp sticksman Robin Guy. Tigertailz headlined the first night of 2010's Hard Rock Hell and released Bezerk Live - Burnin' Fuel on 6 December. In June 2011, it was announced, via the band's website, that Ace Finchum had re-joined the band. They were expected to record their next studio album in 2011 but on 23 November, in an interview with Queens Of Steel webzine, [ Queens Of Steel - Tigertailz interview ] Jay Pepper cast doubt on the future of the band, stating that it was \\"facing a crossroads as to its survival. I don't know if we can survive the latest troubles.\\" Suggesting that Tigertailz might still continue \\"with a different line-up\\" the band parted company with Sarah Firebrand in late 2011, this being made public in a statement issued on 9 January 2012 [ ]. Frontman Kim Hooker went the same way on 28 March 2012, the remaining members citing 'a total breakdown of relationship resulting from the singer's unprofessional conduct'[ ]. They further described themselves as \\"relieved\\". New line-up (2012) On 26 June 2012, Tigertailz announced its new line-up, and a European tour for September and October. Joining original members Jay Pepper and Ace Finchum were Jules Millis (vocals), Rob Wylde (guitar) and Jason Sims (bass). The band re- recorded an old song, \\"Fall In Love Again\\", and filmed a video for it - with all proceeds going towards a charity set up in Pepsi Tate's memory. After a tour and an appearance at the Hard Rock Hell festival, this line-up fragmented in 2013. In a statement, Jay Pepper confirmed that there would be no reunion but that he would continue to perform as Tigertailz, and in June 2013 it was confirmed that drummer Matthew Blakout had re-joined the band, with Wylde switching from guitar to bass, and a new EP 'Knives' being prepared for release. On 7 October 2013, the Classic Rock Magazine website premiered Tigertailz latest video \\"The Shoe Collector\\", ahead of the release of the \\"Knives\\" EP on 15 October. The magazine described it as \\"a major step on Tigertailz‚Äô road back from the brink\\". On 17 February 2014, Classic Rock premiered the second video release from \\"Knives\\" EP \\"One Life\\". On 30 June 2014, Classic Rock once again premiered the final video from \\"Knives\\" EP \\"Punched In The Gutz\\" Filmed in Cardiff's St David's Hall in November 2013. Tigertailz announced European tour dates for Autumn 2014 and also made their US debut. They supported Kiss and Cheap Trick on the 2014 Kiss Kruise. A further line up change happened in 2015 when vocalist Jules Mills was replaced by guitarist turned bassist now turned vocalist Rob Wylde, with the bass position being filled by Berty Burton. In 2016, this line up released the song \\"Pipped It, Popped It\\" which they - unsuccessfully - submitted for consideration as a UK Eurovision Song Contest entry. The song was included on the largely ignored 2016 Blast album released on the band's own TT Records. In 2019, the band were forced to cancel an appearance at Hard Rock Hell due to guitarist Jay Pepper's worsening hearing loss. Bare Knuckle Messiahs A second Tigertailz reunion (of sorts) took place in 2019 when departed vocalist Kim Hooker announced his new band Bare Knuckle Messiahs which features Hooker on vocals and guitar, joined by two former \\"Wazbones\\" era Tigertailz members, guitarist Cy Danaher and drummer Andy Skinner, with the line up being rounded out with the addition of bassist JJ. Hooker's new band released their debut album That Which Preys On The Dead through the DIAFOL label in October 2019.

The campaigns were fought by German , local resistance movements and forces of the British Empire, France, Italy, Belgium and Portugal. Background =Strategic context= German colonies in Africa had been acquired in the 1880s and were not well defended. They were also surrounded by territories controlled by Britain, France, Belgium and Portugal. Colonial military forces in Africa were relatively small, poorly equipped and had been created to maintain internal order, rather than conduct military operations against other colonial forces. Most of the European warfare in Africa during the 19th century had been conducted against African societies to enslave people and later to conquer territory. The Berlin Conference of 1884 had provided for European colonies in Africa to be neutral if war broke out in Europe; in 1914 none of the European powers had plans to challenge their opponents for control of overseas colonies. When news of the outbreak of war reached European colonialists in Africa, it was met by little of the enthusiasm seen in the capital cities of the states which maintained colonies. An editorial in the East African Standard on 22 August argued that Europeans in Africa (colonists and migrants) should not fight each other but instead collaborate to maintain the repression of the indigenous population. War was against the interest of the white colonialists because they were small in number, many of the European conquests were recent, unstable and operated through existing local structures of power; the organisation of African economic potential for European profit had only recently begun. In Britain, an Offensive sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence was appointed on 5 August and established a principle that command of the seas was to be ensured and that objectives were considered only if they could be attained with local forces and if the objective assisted the priority of maintaining British sea communications, as British army garrisons abroad were returned to Europe in an \\"Imperial Concentration\\". Attacks on German coaling stations and wireless stations were considered to be important to clear the seas of German commerce raiders. The objectives were at Luderitz Bay, Windhoek, Duala and Dar-es-Salaam in Africa and a German wireless station in Togoland, next to the British colony of Gold Coast in the Gulf of Guinea, which were considered vulnerable to attack by local or allied forces and in the Far East, which led to the Siege of Tsingtao. North Africa =Zaian War, 1914‚Äì1921= Attempts were made by Germany and the Ottomans to influence conditions in the French colonies by intriguing with the potentates who had been ousted by the French. Spanish authorities in the region informally tolerated the distribution of propaganda and money but thwarted a German plot to smuggle 5,000 rifles and 500,000 bullets through Spain. The maintained several agents in North Africa but had only two in Morocco. The Zaian War was fought between France and the Zaian confederation of Berber people in French Morocco between 1914 and 1921. Morocco had become a French protectorate in 1912 and the French army extended French influence eastwards through the Middle Atlas mountains towards French Algeria. The Zaians, led by Mouha ou Hammou Zayani quickly lost the towns of Taza and Kh√©nifra but managed to inflicted many casualties on the French, who responded by establishing , combined arms formations of regular and irregular infantry, cavalry and artillery. By 1914 the French had in Morocco but two- thirds were withdrawn from 1914 to 1915 for service in France and at the Battle of El Herri (13 November 1914) more than soldiers were killed. Hubert Lyautey, the governor, reorganised his forces and pursued a forward policy rather than passive defence. The French regained most of the lost territory, despite intelligence and financial support from the Central Powers to the Zaian Confederation and raids which caused losses to the French when already short of manpower. =Senussi campaign, 1915‚Äì1917= Coastal campaign, 1915‚Äì1916 On 6 November, the German submarine U‚Äì35 torpedoed and sank a steamer, , in the Bay of Sollum. U-35 surfaced, sank the coastguard gunboat Abbas and badly damaged Nur el Bahr with its deck gun. On 14 November the Senussi attacked an Egyptian position at Sollum and on the night of 17 November, a party of Senussi fired into Sollum as another party cut the coast telegraph line. Next night a monastery at Sidi Barrani, beyond Sollum, was occupied by 300 and on the night of 19 November, a coastguard was killed. An Egyptian post was attacked east of Sollum on 20 November. The British withdrew from Sollum to Mersa Matruh, further east, which had better facilities for a base and the Western Frontier Force (Major-General A. Wallace) was created. On 11 December, a British column sent to Duwwar Hussein was attacked along the Matruh‚ÄìSollum track and in the Affair of Wadi Senba, drove the Senussi out of the wadi. The reconnaissance continued and on 13 December at Wadi Hasheifiat, the British were attacked again and held up until artillery came into action in the afternoon and forced the Senussi to retreat. The British returned to Matruh until 25 December and then made a night advance to surprise the Senussi. At the Affair of Wadi Majid, the Senussi were defeated but were able to withdraw to the west. Air reconnaissance found more Senussi encampments in the vicinity of Matruh at Halazin, which was attacked on 23 January, in the Affair of Halazin. The Senussi fell back skilfully and then attempted to envelop the British flanks. The British were pushed back on the flanks as the centre advanced and defeated the main body of Senussi, who were again able to withdraw. In February 1916, the Western Frontier Force was reinforced and a British column was sent west along the coast to re-capture Sollum. Air reconnaissance discovered a Senussi encampment at Agagia, which was attacked in the Action of Agagia on 26 February. The Senussi were defeated and then intercepted by the Dorset Yeomanry as they withdrew; the Yeomanry charged across open ground swept by machine-gun and rifle fire. The British lost half their horses and men but prevented the Senussi from slipping away. Jaafar Pasha, the commander of the Senussi forces on the coast, was captured and Sollum was re-occupied by British forces on 14 March 1916, which concluded the coastal campaign. Band of Oases campaign, 1916‚Äì1917 On 11 February 1916 Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi, leader of the Senussi order in Cyrenaica, occupied the oasis at Bahariya, which was then bombed by British aircraft. The oasis at Farafra was occupied at the same time and then the Senussi moved on to the oasis at Dakhla on 27 February. The British responded by forming the Southern Force at Beni Suef. Egyptian officials at Kharga were withdrawn and the oasis was occupied by the Senussi until they withdrew without being attacked. The British reoccupied the oasis on 15 April and began to extend the light railway terminus at Kharga to the Moghara Oasis. The mainly Australian Imperial Camel Corps patrolled on camels and in light Ford cars to cut off the Senussi from the Nile Valley. Preparations to attack the oasis at Bahariya were detected by the Senussi garrison, which withdrew to Siwa in early October. The Southern Force attacked the Senussi in the Affairs in the Dakhla Oasis , after which the Senussi retreated to their base at Siwa. In January 1917, a British column including the Light Armoured Car Brigade with Rolls- Royce Armoured Cars and three Light Car Patrols was dispatched to Siwa. On 3 February the armoured cars surprised and engaged the Senussi at Girba, who retreated overnight. Siwa was entered on 4 February without opposition but a British ambush party at the Munassib Pass was foiled, when the escarpment was found to be too steep for the armoured cars. The light cars managed to descend the escarpment and captured a convoy on 4 February. Next day the Senussi from Girba were intercepted but managed to establish a post the cars were unable to reach and then warned the rest of the Senussi. The British force returned to Matruh on 8 February and Sayyid Ahmed withdrew to Jaghbub. Negotiations between Sayed Idris and the Anglo-Italians which had begun in late January were galvanised by news of the Senussi defeat at Siwa. In the accords of Akramah, Idris accepted the British terms on 12 April and those of Italy on 14 April. =Volta-Bani War, 1915‚Äì1917= The Volta-Bani War was an anti-colonial rebellion which took place in parts of French West Africa (now Burkina Faso and Mali) between 1915 and 1917. It was a war between an indigenous African army, a heterogeneous coalition of peoples against the French Army. At its height in 1916, the indigenous forces mustered from 15,000‚Äì20,000 men and fought on several fronts. After about a year and several setbacks, the French army defeated the insurgents and jailed or executed their leaders but resistance continued until 1917. =Darfur Expedition, 1916= On 1 March 1916 hostilities began between the Sudanese government and the Sultan of Darfur. The Anglo-Egyptian Darfur Expedition was conducted to forestall an imagined invasion of Sudan and Egypt by the Darfurian leader, Sultan Ali Dinar, which was believed to have been synchronised with a Senussi advance into Egypt from the west. The Sirdar (commander) of the Egyptian Army organised a force of men at Rahad, a railhead east of the Darfur frontier. On 16 March, the force crossed the frontier mounted in lorries from a forward base established at Nahud, from the border, with the support of four aircraft. By May the force was close to the Darfur capital of El Fasher. At the Affair of Beringia on 22 May, the Fur Army was defeated and the Anglo-Egyptian force captured the capital the next day. Dinar and had left before their arrival and as they moved south, were bombed from the air. French troops in Chad who had returned from the Kamerun Campaign prevented a Darfurian withdrawal westwards. Dinar withdrew into the Marra Mountains south of El Fasher and sent envoys to discuss terms but the British believed he was prevaricating and ended the talks on 1 August. Internal dissension reduced the force with Dinar to men; Anglo-Egyptian outposts were pushed out from El Fasher to the west and southwest after the August rains. A skirmish took place at Dibbis on 13 October and Dinar opened negotiations but was again suspected of bad faith. Dinar fled southwest to Gyuba and a small force was sent in pursuit. At dawn on 6 November, the Anglo-Egyptians attacked in the Affair of Gyuba and Dinar's remaining followers scattered. The body of the Sultan was found from the camp. After the expedition, Darfur was incorporated into Sudan. =Kaocen revolt, 1916‚Äì1917= Ag Mohammed Wau Teguidda Kaocen (1880‚Äì1919), the Amenokal (Chief) of the Ikazkazan Tuareg confederation, had attacked French colonial forces from 1909. The Sanusiya leadership in the Fezzan oasis town of Kufra declared Jihad against the French colonialists in October 1914. The Sultan of Agadez convinced the French that the Tuareg confederations remained loyal and Kaocen's forces besieged the garrison on 17 December 1916. Kaocen, his brother Mokhtar Kodogo and Tuareg raiders, armed with rifles and a field gun captured from the Italians in Libya, defeated several French relief columns. The Tuareg seized the main towns of the A√Ør, including Ingall, Assod√© and Aouderas. Modern northern Niger came under rebel control for over three months. On 3 March 1917, a large French force from Zinder relieved the Agadez garrison and began to recapture the towns. Mass reprisals were taken against the town populations, especially against marabouts, though many were neither Tuareg or rebels. The French summarily killed in public in Agadez and Ingal. Kaocen fled north; in 1919 he was killed by local militia in Mourzouk. Kaocen's brother was killed by the French in 1920 after a revolt he led amongst the Toubou and Fula in the Sultanate of Damagaram was defeated. = Somaliland Campaign, 1914‚Äì1918 = In British Somaliland, Sayyid Mohammed Abdille Hassan (the \\"Mad Mullah\\", who was neither) leader of the Dervish state, continued his campaign against Ethiopian and European encroachment. In March 1914, forty Dervishes had ridden to attack Berbera, the capital of British Somaliland, which caused considerable panic; in November, troops of the Somaliland Camel Corps, with 600 Somali and 650 Indian Army troops, captured three forts at Shimber Berris and then had to return in February 1915 to take them again. The British adopted a policy of containment given their slender resources and tried to keep Sayyid and his 6,000 supporters penned in eastern Somaliland, to encourage desertion and ruthless killings of his own men by Sayyid, which succeeded. British prestige depended on the protection of friendly Somali areas and the deterrence of those Somali peoples inspired by Sayyid from crossing into the East Africa Protectorate (British East Africa, now Kenya). When the Ottoman Empire entered the war in November 1914, the British colonial authorities in British East Africa became apprehensive of attacks from the Muslims of Ethiopia and Somaliland but none transpired until 1916, when trouble also broke out in some Muslim units of the Indian Army stationed in East Africa, including desertions and self-inflicted wounds. In February, about 500 Aulihan warriors from Somaliland captured a British fort at Serenli and killed 65 soldiers of the garrison and their British officer. The British retired from their main fort in the north-east at Wajir and it was not for two years that the Aulihan were defeated. The complications caused by the Ottoman call to Jihad had put the British to considerable trouble in East Africa and elsewhere, to avoid the growth of a pan-Muslim movement. Even when the Ottoman call had little effect, the British were fearful of an African Jihad. To impress the Somali people, some elders were taken to Egypt in 1916 to view the military might of the British empire. The warships, railways and prison camps full of German and Ottoman soldiers made a great impression, which was increased by the outbreak of the Arab Revolt in June. West Africa =Togoland campaign, 1914= The Togoland Campaign (9‚Äì26 August 1914) was a French and British invasion of the German colony of Togoland in West Africa (which became Togo and the Volta Region of Ghana after independence) during the First World War. The colony was invaded on 6 August, by French forces from Dahomey to the east and on 9 August by British forces from Gold Coast to the west. German colonial forces withdrew from the capital Lom√© and the coastal province and then fought delaying actions on the route north to Kamina, where a new wireless station linked Berlin to Togoland, the Atlantic and South America. The main British and French force from the neighbouring colonies of Gold Coast and Dahomey advanced from the coast up the road and railway, as smaller forces converged on Kamina from the north. The German defenders were able to delay the invaders for several days at the battles of Bafilo, Agbeluvhoe and Chra but surrendered the colony on 26 August 1914. In 1916, Togoland was partitioned by the victors and in July 1922, British Togoland and French Togoland were created as League of Nations mandates. The French acquisition consisted of of the colony, including the coast. The British received the smaller, less populated and less developed portion of Togoland to the west. The surrender of Togoland was the beginning of the end for the German colonial empire in Africa. =Bussa uprising, 1915= In the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria (now Nigeria), the British policy of indirect rule through local proxies was extended after the outbreak of the First World War, when British colonial officers and troops were withdrawn for war service. The British became more dependent on local emirs but in Bussa, the reorganisation of local government in 1912 overthrew the authority of the traditional ruler. The hereditary Emir of Bussa, Kitoro Gani was moved aside and the Borgu Emirate was divided, each area ruled by a (native administration). In June 1915, about 600 rebels, armed with bows and arrows occupied Bussa, captured and killed half of the new native administration; the survivors fled the district. The rebellion caused panic because the British authorities were so short of troops. A small force from the West African Frontier Force (WAFF) and the Nigeria police moved into Bussa and skirmished with the rebels. No soldiers were killed and only 150 shots were fired. Sabukki, one of the ringleaders fled to nearby French Dahomey and the rebellion was suppressed. =Kamerun campaign, 1914‚Äì1916= By 25 August 1914, British forces in Nigeria had moved into Kamerun towards Mara in the far north, towards Garua in the centre and towards Nsanakang in the south. British forces moving towards Garua under the command of Colonel MacLear were ordered to push to the German border post at Tepe near Garua. The first engagement between British and German troops in the campaign took place at the Battle of Tepe, eventually resulting in German withdrawal. In the far north British forces attempted to take the German fort at Mora but failed and began a siege which lasted until the end of the campaign. British forces in the south attacked Nsanakang and were defeated and almost completely destroyed by German counterattacks at the Battle of Nsanakong. MacLear then pushed his forces further inland towards the German stronghold of Garua but was repulsed in the First Battle of Garua on 31 August. In 1915 the German forces, except for those at Mora and Garua, withdrew to the mountains near the new capital of Jaunde. In the spring the German forces delayed or repulsed Allied attacks and a force under Captain von Crailsheim from Garua conducted an offensive into Nigeria and fought the Battle of Gurin. General Frederick Hugh Cunliffe began the Second Battle of Garua in June, which was a British victory. Allied units in northern Kamerun were freed to push into the interior, where the Germans were defeated at the Battle of Ngaundere on 29 June. Cunliffe advanced south to Jaunde but was held up by heavy rains and his force joined the Siege of Mora. When the weather improved, Cunliffe moved further south, captured a German fort at the Battle of Banjo on 6 November and occupied several towns by the end of the year. In December, the forces of Cunliffe and Dobell made contact and made ready to conduct an assault on Jaunde. In this year most of had been fully occupied by Belgian and French troops, who also began to prepare for an attack on Jaunde. German forces began to cross into the Spanish colony of Rio Muni on 23 December 1915 and with Allied forces pressing in on Jaunde from all sides, the German commander Carl Zimmermann ordered the remaining German units and civilians to escape into Rio Muni. By mid-February, and civilians had reached Spanish territory. On 18 February the Siege of Mora ended with the surrender of the garrison. Most Kamerunians remained in Muni but the Germans eventually moved to Fernando Po and some were allowed by Spain to travel to the Netherlands to go home. Some Kamerunians including the paramount chief of the Beti people moved to Madrid, where they lived as visiting nobility on German funds. =Adubi War, 1918= The Adubi War was an uprising that occurred in June and July 1918 in the British Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria, because of taxation introduced by the colonial government. Direct taxes were introduced by the colonial government along with existing forced labour obligations and various fees. On 7 June, the British arrested 70 Egba chiefs and issued an ultimatum that resisters should lay down their arms, pay the taxes and obey the local leaders. On 11 June, a party of soldiers returned from East Africa were brought in and on 13 July, Egba rebels pulled up railway lines at Agbesi and derailed a train. Other rebels demolished the station at Wasimi and killed the British agent and Oba Osile was attacked. Hostilities between the rebels and colonial troops continued for about three weeks at Otite, Tappona, Mokoloki and Lalako but by 10 July, the rebellion had been put down, the leaders killed or arrested. About 600 people died, including the British agent and the Oba Osile, the African leader of the north-eastern Egba district, although this may have been due to a dispute over land and unconnected to the uprising. The incident led to the abrogation of Abeokutan independence in 1918 and the introduction of forced labor in the region; imposition of the direct taxes was postponed until 1925. South West Africa =German South West Africa campaign, 1914‚Äì1915= An invasion of German South West Africa from the south failed at the Battle of Sandfontein (25 September 1914), close to the border with the Cape Colony. German fusiliers inflicted a serious defeat on the British troops and the survivors returned to British territory. The Germans began an invasion of South Africa to forestall another invasion attempt and the Battle of Kakamas took place on 4 February 1915, between South African and German forces, a skirmish for control of two river fords over the Orange River. The South Africans prevented the Germans from gaining control of the fords and crossing the river. By February 1915, the South Africans were ready to occupy German territory. Botha put Smuts in command of the southern forces while he commanded the northern forces. Botha arrived at Swakopmund on 11 February and continued to build up his invasion force at Walfish Bay (or Walvis Bay), a South African enclave about halfway along the coast of German South West Africa. In March Botha began an advance from Swakopmund along the Swakop valley with its railway line and captured Otjimbingwe, Karibib, Friedrichsfelde, Wilhelmsthal and Okahandja and then entered Windhuk on 5 May 1915. The Germans offered surrender terms, which were rejected by Botha and the war continued. On 12 May Botha declared martial law and divided his forces into four contingents, which cut off German forces in the interior from the coastal regions of Kunene and Kaokoveld and fanned out into the north-east. Lukin went along the railway line from Swakopmund to Tsumeb. The other two columns rapidly advanced on the right flank, Myburgh to Otavi junction and Manie Botha to Tsumeb and the terminus of the railway. German forces in the north-west fought the Battle of Otavi on 1 July but were defeated and surrendered at Khorab on 9 July 1915. In the south, Smuts landed at the South West African naval base at Luderitzbucht, then advanced inland and captured Keetmanshoop on 20 May. The South Africans linked with two columns which had advanced over the border from South Africa. Smuts advanced north along the railway line to Berseba and on 26 May, after two days' fighting captured Gibeon. The Germans in the south were forced to retreat northwards towards Windhuk and Botha's force. On 9 July the German forces in the south surrendered. Maritz rebellion, 1914‚Äì1915 1st Rhodesia Regiment in Cape Town, December 1914 General Koos de la Rey, under the influence of Siener van Rensburg, a \\"crazed seer\\", believed that the outbreak of war foreshadowed the return of the republic but was persuaded by Botha and Smuts on 13 August not to rebel and on 15 August told his supporters to disperse. At a congress on 26 August, De la Rey claimed loyalty to South Africa, not Britain or Germany. The Commandant-General of the Union Defence Force, Brigadier-General Christian Frederick Beyers, opposed the war and with the other rebels, resigned his commission on 15 September. General Koos de la Rey joined Beyers and on 15 September they visited Major Jan Kemp in Potchefstroom, who had a large armoury and a force of many of whom were thought to be sympathetic. The South African government believed it to be an attempt to instigate a rebellion. Beyers claimed that it was to discuss plans for a simultaneous resignation of leading army officers, similar to the Curragh incident in Britain. During the afternoon De la Rey was mistakenly shot and killed by a policeman, at a roadblock set up to look for the Foster gang, and many Afrikaners believed that De la Rey had been assassinated. After the funeral, the rebels condemned the war but when Botha asked them to volunteer for military service in South West Africa they accepted. Manie Maritz, at the head of a commando of Union forces on the border of German South West Africa, allied with the Germans on 7 October and issued a proclamation on behalf of a provisional government and declared war on the British on 9 October. Generals Beyers, De Wet, Maritz, Kemp and Bezuidenhout were to be the first leaders of a new South African Republic. Maritz occupied Keimoes in the Upington area. The Lydenburg commando under General De Wet took possession of the town of Heilbron, held up a train and captured government stores and ammunition. By the end of the week De Wet had a force of and Beyers had gathered more in the Magaliesberg. General Louis Botha had pro-government troops. The government declared martial law on 12 October and loyalists under General Louis Botha and Jan Smuts repressed the uprising. Maritz was defeated on 24 October and took refuge with the Germans; the Beyers commando force was dispersed at Commissioners Drift on 28 October, after which Beyers joined forces with Kemp and then was drowned in the Vaal River on 8 December. De Wet was captured in Bechuanaland on 2 December and Kemp, having crossed the Kalahari desert and lost and most of their horses on the journey, joined Maritz in German South West Africa and attacked across the Orange river on 22 December. Maritz advanced south again on 13 January 1915 and attacked Upington on 24 January and most of the rebels surrendered on 30 January. German invasion of Angola, 1914‚Äì1915 Portuguese troops embarking for Angola The campaign in southern Portuguese West Africa (modern-day Angola) took place from Portuguese forces in southern Angola were reinforced by a military expedition led by Lieutenant-Colonel Alves Ro√ßadas, which arrived at Mo√ß√¢medes on 1 October 1914. After the loss of the wireless transmitter at Kamina in Togoland, German forces in South West Africa could not communicate easily and until July 1915 the Germans did not know if Germany and Portugal were at war (war was declared by Germany on 9 March 1916.). On 19 October 1914, an incident occurred in which fifteen Germans entered Angola without permission and were arrested at fort Naulila and in a m√™l√©e three Germans were killed by Portuguese troops. On 31 October, German troops armed with machine guns launched a surprise attack, which became known as the Cuangar Massacre, on the small Portuguese outpost at Cuangar and killed eight soldiers and a civilian. On 18 December a German force of under the command of Major Victor Franke attacked Portuguese forces at Naulila. A German shell detonated the munitions magazine at Forte Ro√ßadas and the Portuguese were forced to withdraw from the Ovambo region to Humbe, with and taken prisoner. The Germans lost killed and Local civilians collected Portuguese weapons and rose against the colonial regime. On 7 July 1915, Portuguese forces under the command of General Pereira d'E√ßa reoccupied the Humbe region and conducted a reign of terror against the population. The Germans retired to the south with the northern border secure during the uprising in Ovambo, which distracted Portuguese forces from operations further south. Two days later German forces in South West Africa surrendered, ending the South West Africa Campaign. East Africa =East African campaign, 1914‚Äì1915= Military operations, 1914‚Äì1915 Contemporary painting of the Allied defeat at the Battle of Tanga in 1914 On the outbreak of war there and in the King's African Rifles in East Africa. On 5 August 1914, British troops from the Uganda Protectorate attacked German outposts near Lake Victoria and on 8 August and bombarded Dar es Salaam. On 15 August, German forces in the Neu Moshi region captured Taveta on the British side of Kilimanjaro. In September, the Germans raided deeper into British East Africa and Uganda and operations were conducted on Lake Victoria by a German boat armed with a QF 1 pounder pom-pom gun. The British armed the Uganda Railway lake steamers , , and and regained command of Lake Victoria, when two of the British boats trapped the tug, which was then scuttled by the crew. The Germans later raised the tug, salvaged the gun and used the boat as a transport. German colonial volunteer mounted patrol in 1914 The British command planned an operation to suppress German raiding and to capture the northern region of the German colony. Indian Expeditionary Force B of in two brigades would land at Tanga on 2 November 1914 to capture the city and take control the Indian Ocean terminus of the Usambara Railway. Near Kilimanjaro, Indian Expeditionary Force C of in one brigade, would advance from British East Africa on Neu-Moshi on 3 November, to the western terminus of the railway. After capturing Tanga, Force B would rapidly move north-west to join Force C and mop up the remaining Germans. Although outnumbered and Longido, the under Lettow-Vorbeck defeated the British offensive. In the British Official History, Charles Hordern, wrote that the operation was \\"... one the most notable failures in British military history\\". =Chilembwe uprising, 1915= The uprising was led by John Chilembwe, a millenarian Christian minister of the \\"Watch-Tower\\" sect, in the Chiradzulu district of Nyasaland (now Malawi) against colonial forced labour, racial discrimination and new demands on the population caused by the outbreak of World War I. Chilembwe rejected co-operation with Europeans in their war, when they withheld property and human rights from Africans. The revolt began in the evening of 23 January 1915, when rebels attacked a plantation and killed three colonists. In another attack early in the morning of 24 January in Blantyre, several weapons were captured. News of the insurrection was received by the colonial government on 24 January, which mobilised the settler militia and two companies of the King's African Rifles from Karonga. The soldiers and militia attacked Mbombwe on 25 January and were repulsed. The rebels later attacked a nearby Christian mission and during the night fled from Mbombwe to Portuguese East Africa. On 26 January government forces took Mbombwe unopposed and Chilembwe was later killed by a police patrol, near the border with Portuguese East African border. In the repression after the rebellion, more than were killed and were imprisoned. =Naval operations, 1914‚Äì1916= Battle of the Rufiji Delta, 1915 A light cruiser, of the Imperial German Navy, was in the Indian Ocean when war was declared. K√∂nigsberg sank the cruiser HMS Pegasus in Zanzibar harbour and then retired into the Rufiji River delta. After being cornered by warships of the British Cape Squadron, two monitors, and , armed with guns, were towed to the Rufiji from Malta by the Red Sea and arrived in June 1915. On 6 July, clad in extra armour and covered by a bombardment from the fleet, the monitors entered the river. The ships were engaged by shore-based weapons hidden among trees and undergrowth. Two aircraft based at Mafia Island observed the fall of shells, during an exchange of fire at a range of with K√∂nigsberg, which had assistance from shore-based spotters. Mersey was hit twice, six crew killed and its gun disabled; Severn was straddled but hit K√∂nigsberg several times, before the spotter aircraft returned to base. An observation party was seen in a tree and killed and when a second aircraft arrived both monitors resumed fire. German return fire diminished in quantity and accuracy and later in the afternoon the British ships withdrew. The monitors returned on 11 June and hit K√∂nigsberg with the eighth salvo and within ten minutes the German ship could only reply with three guns. A large explosion was seen at At seven explosions occurred. By K√∂nigsberg was a mass of flames. The British salvaged six guns from the Pegasus, which became known as the Peggy guns, and the crew of K√∂nigsberg salvaged the main battery guns of their ship and joined the . Lake Tanganyika expedition, 1915 The Germans had maintained control of the lake since the outbreak of the war, with three armed steamers and two unarmed motorboats. In 1915, two British motorboats, and (Commander Geoffrey Spicer-Simson), each armed with a 3-pounder gun and a Maxim gun, were transported by land to the British shore of Lake Tanganyika. The British captured the German ship Kingani on 26 December, renamed it and accompanied by two Belgian ships, attacked and sank the German ship Hedwig von Wissmann. The MV Liemba and the Wami, an unarmed motorboat, were the only German ships left on the lake. In February 1916 the Wami was intercepted and run ashore by the crew and burned. Lettow-Vorbeck had the K√∂nigsberg gun removed and sent by rail to the main fighting front. Graf von G√∂tzen was scuttled in mid-July after the Belgians made bombing attacks by floatplanes, loaned by the British, before Belgian colonial troops advancing on Kigoma could capture it; Graf von G√∂tzen was refloated and used by the British. =East African campaign, 1916‚Äì1918= Military operations, 1916 General Horace Smith-Dorrien was sent from England to take command of the operations in East Africa but he contracted pneumonia during the voyage and was replaced by General Smuts. Reinforcements and local recruitment had increased the British force to Africans British and Rhodesians and and African troops, from a ration strength of which included the Carrier Corps of African civilians. Belgian troops and a larger but ineffective group of Portuguese military units based in Mozambique were also available. During the previous 1915, Lettow-Vorbeck had increased the German force to The main attack was from the north from British East Africa, as troops from the Belgian Congo advanced from the west in two columns, over Lake Victoria on the British troop ships and and into the Rift Valley. Another contingent advanced over Lake Nyasa (now Lake Malawi) from the south-east. Lettow-Vorbeck evaded the British, whose troops suffered greatly from disease along the march. The 9th South African Infantry began the operation in February with and by October it was reduced to troops, mostly by disease. The Germans avoided battle and by September 1916, the German Central Railway from the coast at Dar es Salaam to Ujiji had been taken over by the British. As the German forces had been restricted to the southern part of German East Africa, Smuts began to replace South African, Rhodesian and Indian troops with the King's African Rifles and by 1917 more than half the British Army in East Africa was African. The King's African Rifles was enlarged and by November 1918 had Smuts left in January 1917 to join the Imperial War Cabinet at London. Belgian-Congolese campaign, 1916 Belgian troops in East Africa in 1918 The Belgian of formed three groups, each with yet expected to live off the land. The 1915 harvest had been exhausted and the 1916 harvest had not matured; Belgian requisitions alienated the local civilians. On 5 April, the Belgians offered an armistice to the Germans and then on 12 April commenced hostilities. The advanced between Kigali and Nyanza under the command of General Charles Tombeur, Colonel Molitor and Colonel Olsen and captured Kigali on 6 May. The Germans in Burundi were forced back and by 17 June the Belgians had occupied Burundi and Rwanda. The and the British Lake Force then advanced towards Tabora, an administrative centre of central German East Africa. The Allies moved in three columns and took Biharamulo, Mwanza, Karema, Kigoma and Ujiji. Tabora was captured unopposed on 19 September. To forestall Belgian claims on the German colony, Smuts ordered Belgian forces back to Congo, leaving them as occupiers only in Rwanda and Burundi. The British were obliged to recall Belgian troops in 1917 and after this the Allies coordinated campaign plans. Military operations, 1917‚Äì1918 Major-General Jacob van Deventer began an offensive in July 1917, which by early autumn had pushed the Germans to the south. From 1917, Lettow-Vorbeck and the British fought a mutually costly battle at Mahiwa, with casualties and casualties. After the news of the battle reached Germany, Lettow-Vorbeck was promoted to Generalmajor. British units forced the further south and on 23 November, Lettow-Vorbeck crossed into Portuguese Mozambique to plunder supplies from Portuguese garrisons. The Germans marched through Mozambique in caravans of troops, carriers, wives and children for nine months. Lettow-Vorbeck divided the force into three groups, one detachment of under Theodor Tafel, was forced to surrender after running out of food and ammunition when Lettow-Vorbeck and Tafel were unaware they were only one day‚Äôs march apart. The Germans returned to German East Africa and then crossed into Northern Rhodesia in August 1918. On 13 November two days after the Armistice was signed in France, the German Army took Kasama unopposed. The next day at the Chambezi River, Lettow-Vorbeck was handed a telegram announcing the signing of the armistice and he agreed to a cease- fire. Lettow-Vorbeck marched his army to Abercorn and formally surrendered on 23 November 1918. =Makonbe uprising, 1917= In March 1917 the Makonbe people achieved a measure of social unity, rebelled against the Portuguese colonialists in Zambezia province of Portuguese East Africa (now Mozambique) and defeated the colonial regime. About 20,000 rebels besieged the Portuguese in Tete. The British refused to lend troops to the Portuguese but people were recruited on the promise of loot, women and children. Through terrorism and enslavement, the Portuguese quashed the rebellion by the end of the year. Repercussions of the rising continued as British administrators in Northern Rhodesia in 1918 struggled to compensate local civilians for war service, particularly during the famine of 1917‚Äì1918. The Colonial Office banned the coercion of local civilians into British service in the colony, which stranded British troops. =Barue uprising, 1917= The colonial authorities in Portuguese Mozambique increased the brutality of their occupation during the war. \\"Revolting practices\\" criticised by the British, such as forced labour, were increasingly applied despite the abolition of slavery. Press gangs (cipais) used the most brutal coercion to mobilise whole populations, young, old and infirm people not being exempted and women being raped. By the end of 1916, many young men had fled to Southern Rhodesia and Transvaal to escape the Portuguese and to earn living wages. The condition of the populations left behind worsened to the point that when the cipais tried to raise another 5,000 carriers from the kingdom of Barue in March 1917, the population rebelled. Disgust at Portuguese depredations united many peoples but the rivals for the title of Makombe of the Wabarue fought independent campaigns, attracting support from the bandits in the Zambesi valley. At the end of April, the rebels routed a Portuguese force sent to suppress the rising and reached the provincial capital of Tete; by the end of May had overrun most of Zambezia Province. About 100,000 people crossed the border into British Nyasaland and the Rhodesian colonies to escape the violence but the disruption did little to alter British disdain for Portuguese methods and despite having received troops to help put down the Chilembwe rebellion, they refused to send troops, only allowing guns and ammunition over the border. In May the Portuguese began to suppress the rebels by butchering thousands of people, enslaving women and plundering territory. The rebels held out into November and the rivals for the title of Makombe fled to Southern Rhodesia. During June the Portuguese had to divide their forces and send thousands of Portuguese and local troops to attack the Makonde living on the Mvua plateau, who had also rebelled. Another rebellion broke out early in 1918. Aftermath =Analysis= The war marked the end of the German colonial empire; during the war, the Entente powers posed as crusaders for liberalism and enlightenment but little evidence exists that it was seen as such by Africans. Many African soldiers fought on both sides, with a loyalty to military professionalism, rather than nationalism and porters had mainly been attracted by pay or had been coerced. The war had been the final period of the Scramble for Africa; control and annexation of territory had been the principal war aim of the Europeans and the main achievement of Lettow-Vorbeck, had been to thwart some of the ambitions of the South African colonialists. In the post-war settlements, Germany's colonies were divided between Britain, Belgium, Portugal and South Africa. The former German colonies had gained independence by the 1960s except for South West Africa (Namibia) which gained independence from South Africa in 1990. =Casualties= The British official historian of the campaigns in \\"Togo and the Cameroons\\", F. J. Moberly, recorded casualties, casualties, the invaliding of Europeans and soldiers. Civilian porters were brought from Allied colonies and of killed or died of disease and invalided as they could be \\"more easily replaced than soldiers\\". Of recruited civilians no records were kept. Franco- Belgian troops under the command of General Joseph Aymerich had and died of disease. In 2001 Strachan recorded British losses in the East African campaign as in action, of disease and deaths among African porters. In South West Africa, Strachan recorded Africans killed in action and of disease or accidents. German casualties were whom killed and taken prisoner. In 2007 Paice recorded casualties in the East African campaign, of whom the in the campaign. By 1917 the conscription of as carriers, had depopulated many districts and had died, among them the British Carrier Corps in East Africa. A Colonial Office official wrote that the East African campaign had not become a scandal only \\"....because the people who suffered most were the carriers - and after all, who cares about native carriers?\\" In the German colonies, no records of the number of people conscripted or casualties were kept but in the German Official History, the writer referred to Paice referred to a 1989 estimate of and a death rate Carriers impressed by the Germans were rarely paid and food and cattle were stolen from civilians; a famine caused by the consequent food shortage and poor rains in 1917, led to another deaths in Ruanda, Urundi and German East Africa. The conscription of farm labour in British East Africa, the failure of the rains at the end of 1917 and early 1918 led to famine and in September Spanish flu reached sub-Saharan Africa. In British East Africa died, in South Africa there were and in German East Africa of the population died of famine and disease; in sub-Saharan Africa, died in the epidemic.

Background A one-time national secretary of the Social Credit Party, Reznowski once worked for former Socred leader Robert N. Thompson and was a \\"doctrinal purist\\"\\"Socreds sow new ideas.... \\", Globe and Mail, March 13, 1978 when it came to social credit monetary theory. Reznowski ran for the party leadership at its 1978 convention and was elected leader. He resigned four months after losing an October 16, 1978 by-election in Saint Boniface, Manitoba, in which he finished in fourth place with only 1,204 votes out of 43,572 valid votes (2.76%).History of Federal Ridings since 1867: St. Boniface, October 16, 1978 by-election, Parliament of Canada website Reznowski cited the need for him to finish his doctoral thesis in medieval literature in order to retain his teaching position for his resignation. However, he also said that the party wanted a francophone leader and that it would have a better chance of retaining its nine seats in the House of Commons of Canada, all of which were in Quebec, with a leader from that province. It had been hoped that Reznowski's leadership would help revive the party in its former base of Western Canada. Policies Reznowski was described as a \\"doctrinal purist\\" who advocated the original social credit monetary theory of C.H. Douglas. He promised that a Social Credit government would cut retail sales tax by 25 per cent and argued for moral responsibility in society with the family as its basic union. He also expressed his opposition to homosexuality, abortion, birth control and working mothers and his support for capital punishment. Reznowki also argued that Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was soft on communism and that there was an imminent threat of a takeover of Canada by the Soviet Union. As national party leader Reznowski criticized Bill Bennett, leader of the British Columbia Social Credit Party and Premier of British Columbia for rejecting social credit doctrine quipping that Ogopogo would be a better name for Bennett's party.

He was Chairman of the Board of Directors for the China Mail Steamship Company, and President of the Canton Bank of San Francisco. He was also a real estate developer. Today, his legacy is being carried on in the Pacific Cannery Lofts in Oakland by Holliday Development, where dedications are made in his honor in one of his original buildings for the Pacific Coast Canning Company. Early life Lew Hing was the second of three children born to his father's third wife (after the first two wives died). Lew had an older sister and a younger brother, as well as half brothers and sisters. His birthplace and ancestral roots were in the greater Hoisan (Âè∞Â±±) region, former district of Sunning (Êñ∞ÂØß), village of Li‚Äôao (Ë£°Âù≥ÈÑâ) in the province of Guangdong, China. He received his formal education in Hong Kong. Before Lew Hing was born, his father had journeyed to San Francisco to find prosperity. He didn‚Äôt find it. Rejecting conscription as a laborer, as well as the debauchery of San Francisco's Barbary Coast lifestyle, he camped along the shores of San Francisco Bay until the frustration of disappointment and loneliness caused him to return to China after two months. A few years later, Lew Hing would cross the ocean to San Francisco and fare much better. In 1868 an older half brother of Lew Hing ventured to San Francisco to start a small metal shop on Commercial Street. With the success of his shop, in 1871 he urged his 12-year-old half brother, Lew Hing, to immigrate to America to join him in his growing business. A few months after Lew arrived, his half- brother planned a brief vacation back to Canton to visit his family. His square rigged sailing vessel was off the coast of Japan when it caught fire and sank, causing all aboard to perish at sea. This left the young Lew Hing, at age 13, alone in San Francisco, without family or money. Despite his grim circumstance, the growing Chinese community that would later become known as San Francisco's Chinatown was beginning to form familial associations that provided leadership and social opportunities among the Chinese immigrants to America. Men with the same surnames would help each other as brothers. This was the beginning of Family Associations in Chinatown, and it was through such association that the young Lew Hing was able to survive. It was with such Family Association guidance that Lew continued working at his deceased brother's metal shop, while attending a local church mission to learn to read and write English. In doing so, he also learned to do his own bookkeeping and accounting. Never afraid to work long hours, he also accepted odd jobs for extra money. His industrious and entrepreneurial spirit carried him through these difficult years. Marriage and children In 1877, Lew Hing married Chin Shee (July 1860 ‚Äì July 1947) in San Francisco. They had three sons and four daughters, each born in San Francisco. *Lew Yuet-yung, aka Mrs. Quan Yick-sun (1879‚Äì1967) *Lew Gin-gow (1885‚Äì1943) *Lew Yuen-hing, aka Mrs. Ho Chou-won (1889‚Äì1978) *Lew Wai-hing, aka Mrs. Ng Min-hing (1890‚Äì1969) *Thomas Gunn-sing Lew (1894‚Äì1974) *Lew Soon-hing Rose, aka Mrs. Francis Moon (1898‚Äì1993) *Ralph Ginn Lew (1903‚Äì1987) Early career Though he was never as skilled in metalwork as his older half-brother had been, he nonetheless learned the basics, such as soldering. In addition, among his odd jobs he helped a European woman make her fruit jams for storage in glass jars. This taught Lew about food preservation and how to avoid food poisoning. It was a natural next step for Lew to combine his metalwork with his food preservation skills to join in the new industry of canning foodstuffs. At age 18 in 1877, Lew Hing founded his first cannery with another metalworker of Family Association ties, Lew Yu-tung. The cannery was located at the northeast corner of Sacramento and Stockton Streets in San Francisco and took up the first two stories of the building with the basement as storage. Lew Hing and other Family Association members lived on the third floor. In the 1880s‚Äì1890s, canning food was still a new concept. Lew Hing had embarked on a long period of trial and error before the cannery could reliably produce safe and edible canned foods. When food was not preserved properly or the cans were not fully sterilized (for example, each can had to be soldered individually by hand), noxious bacterial action would ruin the product, causing cans to swell and even explode. Eventually, Lew Hing developed safer and more effective formulas for canning various fruits and vegetables. These formulas were never documented since they were Lew Hing's trade secrets and were kept from rival canneries. Canned fruit items became a very good seller in Chinatown as many Chinese made purchases to take back to China. Soon, the products were purchased by Westerners and sales expanded outside San Francisco's Chinatown. Middle years Lew's original cannery thrived for over two decades. Then, in 1902, at age 44, he decided to close the cannery and retire to Canton. However, within a year Lew returned to the Bay Area, opening the Pacific Coast Canning Company at 12th and Pine Streets in Oakland. Always on the cutting edge of progress, Lew built his new cannery as the first concrete building in the industrial part of Oakland, plus he insisted on the most advanced machinery for mass production of his products. Also, in contrast to San Francisco, Oakland had space for a larger cannery as well as providing the Southern Pacific railroad tracks directly to the cannery dock for easy shipping of Lew's Buckskin brand canned goods throughout the United States. Products included asparagus, cherries, apricots, peaches, pears, and grapes. Tomatoes were the most popular. Always a stickler for quality, each morning, Lew would go to the Tasting Room and open, inspect, and taste batches of food processed the day before. Eventually, Buckskin canned goods would make their way throughout the Western hemisphere. In 1906, Lew Hing was able to make substantial assistance to Bay Area earthquake victims. He opened his cannery to the homeless and also provided tents elsewhere for temporary shelter. He hired cooks to provide meals. Following the earthquake, many San Franciscans relocated to Oakland, including several Chinese. As with several ethnic groups, Chinese were compelled to remain in ethnic clusters. Lew assisted these Chinese with finance and leadership by organizing neighborhoods, including the area that became Oakland's Chinatown. As a consequence, he became involved with many Oakland Chinatown organizations, making contributions to their many causes and forming business alliances in relation to the Pacific Canning Company. As the Pacific Canning Company prospered, Lew Hing diversified his interests into many other areas, including a personal interest in the Loong Kong Tien Yee Association, an organization for the families of Lew, Quan, Jung and Chew, and fostered the group in both Oakland and San Francisco. In 1907 Lew returned to San Francisco for added business interests. Given his natural leadership in the Chinese community, he became President of the Canton Bank of San Francisco, located at the northeast corner of Montgomery and Sacramento Streets. In the same year he also entered the hotel business, building The Republic Hotel on Grant Avenue (near Sacrament Street). However, his San Francisco interests had to be juggled with his work as president and owner of Pacific Coast Canning Company in Oakland. Always a careful and punctual man, he devised a schedule that allowed him to spend half of each work day in San Francisco, half in Oakland. Later years  By 1910, Lew Hing had entered the import-export trade, first as an investor with Sing Chong and Fook Wah Companies which imported art goods from China. Then, in 1910, Lew Hing began his own import-export business, shipping wholesale Chinese food items from Hop Wo Cheung in Canton, China to Hop Wo Lung, a store on Grant Avenue in San Francisco. By 1911, Lew Hing's Pacific Coast Canning Company had become one of Oakland's largest businesses, providing over 1,000 jobs during the peak canning seasons. Employees were usually from the local Portuguese, Italian, and Chinese communities. Lew Hing was the Bay Area's single largest employer of Chinese. In 1912 Lew built his second hotel, originally named the Mun Ming Lue Kwan, at 858-870 Clay Street, between Grant and Stockton Streets. Still in existence, the name has since been changed to The Lew Hing building in honor of Lew. In 1915, Lew accepted the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors for the China Mail Steamship Co. Ltd., whose office was in the same building as his Canton Bank office. In 1917, Lew Hing expanded his cannery business by investing in the Bayside Canning Company, a sardine cannery at Monterey's famed Cannery Row. It was said that the sardines were so plentiful in Monterey Bay that they actually swam their way into the cannery. By World War I, Pacific Coast Canning Company was regularly exporting convenient canned goods to Europe. This provided an easy source for Herbert Hoover's food rehabilitation program for Europe. Lew Hing's efforts were now helping the United States to win the war. From 1916 to 1921, Lew Hing was the principal owner of a cotton plantation known as Wa Muck in Mexicali, Mexico. For laborers, he conscripted hundreds of Chinese from China who would pass through San Francisco and go directly to Mexico by rail. Lew Hing set aside a few city blocks of land on the plantation for shops to accommodate the needs of Chinese workers. The remains of this impromptu Chinatown still exist in Mexicali. In 1928, at age 70, Lew Hing established his fourth cannery, the West Coast Canning Company, along the shores of San Pablo Bay in Antioch, California. Legacy Lew Hing was a pioneer in California industry. The Lew Hing building remains in San Francisco's Chinatown, and Oakland's Chinatown owes incalculable gratitude to Lew. The Pacific Coast Canning Company's building had remained, though empty, at 12th and Pine Streets in Oakland. In 2006 this building was torn down and replaced by housing, Pacific Cannery Lofts, with a plaque commemorating Lew Hing and his importance to the site. After a rich career in canning, shipping, hotels, banking, and other industries, Lew Hing considered his most worthy contribution to be the swimming pool for the youth at the San Francisco Chinese YMCA, built in 1925. For more than 80 years, the pool that Lew Hing built was the only swimming pool in San Francisco's Chinatown. Inventive and industrious throughout his life, Lew Hing was very progressive for his time. He was also a man of high principles. Coming from his very humble beginning, he had great compassion for Chinese immigrants in America because he understood them well. He was a well-respected gentleman who generated much business in the community and created many job opportunities for the Chinese in the Bay Area. He contributed in upgrading the quality of life for Chinese immigrants in their ordeal of assimilation and integration into the Western ways of life in these United States. He also related well to the Caucasian community, as indicated when he often attended formal civic events and was included in the inner circle of San Francisco's long-time mayor, Jimmy Rolph. Lew became very American in his ways, never again desiring to return to China.

Biography After the Fall of Constantinople Lascaris was taken to the Peloponnese and to Crete. When still quite young he came to Venice, where Bessarion became his patron, and sent him to learn Latin at the University of Padua.Jonathan Woolfson, Padua and the Tudors: English Students in Italy, 1485-1603, James Clarke & Co, 1998, p. 4. On the death of Bessarion, Lorenzo de' Medici welcomed him to Florence, where Lascaris gave Greek lectures on Thucydides, Demosthenes, Sophocles, and the Greek Anthology. Lorenzo sent him twice to Greece in quest of manuscripts. When he returned the second time (1492) he brought back about two hundred from Mount Athos. Meanwhile, Lorenzo had died. Lascaris entered the service of the Kingdom of France and was ambassador at Venice from 1503 to 1508, at which time he became a member of the New Academy of Aldus Manutius; but if the printer had the benefit of his advice, no Aldine work bears his name. He resided at Rome under Leo X, the first pope of the Medici family, from 1513 to 1518, returned under Clement VII in 1523, and Paul III in 1534. In the meantime he had assisted Louis XII in forming the library of Blois, and when Francis I had it removed to Fontainebleau, Lascaris and Guillaume Bud√© had charge of its organization. We owe to him a number of editiones principes, among them the Anthologia Graeca (1494), four plays of Euripides, Callimachus (about 1495), Apollonius Rhodius, Lucian (1496), printed in Florence in Greek capitals with accents, the scholia of Didymas (Rome 1517) and of Porphyrius (1518) on Homer (Rome 1518), and the scholia vetera on Sophocles (Rome 1518). Among his pupils were Alessandra Scala, Marco Musuro, Germain de Brie, Dimitrije Ljubaviƒá, and Jacques Dubois. He was buried in the gothic church of Sant' Agata dei Goti. On his memorial the following epigram is inscribed, composed by himself: :ŒõŒëŒ£ŒöŒëŒ°ŒôŒ£ ŒëŒõŒõŒüŒîŒëŒ†Œó ŒìŒëŒôŒó ŒïŒùŒôŒöŒëŒ§ŒòŒïŒ§Œü ŒìŒëŒôŒóŒù, ŒüŒ•Œ§Œô ŒõŒôŒóŒù ŒûŒïŒôŒùŒóŒù, Œ© ŒûŒïŒùŒï, ŒúŒïŒúŒ¶ŒüŒúŒïŒùŒüŒ£.

Together they authored several humorous short novels in the so-called \\"Psi-Power\\" series: Brain Twister (1962), The Impossibles (1963), and Supermind (1963). For Brain Twister they were nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960 (under the novel's original title, \\"That Sweet Little Old Lady\\"). They also co-authored the novel Pagan Passions (1959) with Garrett using his own name and Janifer using his Larry M. Harris pseudonym. Laurence Janifer and Randall Garrett Laurence Janifer was a prolific science fiction author, with a career spanning over 50 years. Though his first published work was a short story in Cosmos magazine in 1953, his career as a writer can be said to have started in 1959 when he began writing for Astounding and Galaxy Science Fiction. Janifer's best known work is the \\"Survivor\\" series, comprising five novels and many short stories. In the early 1960s Janifer teamed with Randall Garrett, a prolific contributor to Astounding and other science fiction magazines who is today best known for the Lord Darcy books. In hopes of replicating the success of spy stories such as James Bond (which were hugely popular at the time), the pair decided to combine a traditional spy narrative with humor and extra-sensory perception to appeal to readers of science fiction.  Psi-Power Series  The first story they wrote in this so-called \\"Psi-Power\\" series was \\"That Sweet Little Old Lady,\\" published in the Sept./October 1959 edition of Analog Science Fiction and Science Fact. Subsequent stories including \\"Out Like a Light\\" (Analog, April/May/June 1960), and \\"Occasion for Disaster\\" (Analog, November/December 1960 and January/February 1961). All of the stories were novella length and were subsequently reprinted in 1962 and 1963 by Pyramid Books under different titles (\\"That Sweet Little Old Lady\\" as Brain Twister, \\"Out Like a Light\\" as The Impossibles, and \\"Occasion for Disaster\\" as Supermind). \\"That Sweet Little Old Lady\\" (Brain Twister) was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960 but lost out to Starship Troopers by Robert A.

From Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie: Tom Van Vleck, a Multics engineer, has also reminisced about the extension rc: \\"The idea of having the command processing shell be an ordinary slave program came from the Multics design, and a predecessor program on CTSS by Louis Pouzin called RUNCOM, the source of the '.rc' suffix on some Unix configuration files.\\" This is also the origin of the name of the Plan 9 from Bell Labs shell by Tom Duff, the rc shell. It is called \\"rc\\" because the main job of a shell is to \\"run commands\\".

The area currently known as Highlandtown was established in 1866 when the area known as \\"Snake Hill\\" was established as a village outside the Baltimore city limits. The first settlers of the community were primarily German Americans. In 1870, residents renamed the neighborhood \\"Highland Town\\" because of the views it offered over the city. The neighborhood was made part of Baltimore City in 1919. The neighborhood today is bounded by Haven Street to the east, Baltimore Street to the north, Linwood Avenue to the west, and Eastern Avenue to the south. The long stretch of Eastern Avenue that runs through the neighborhood is notable as the Highlandtown's main commercial thoroughfare. The area was designated as a \\"Main Street District\\" by a previous mayor Martin O'Malley, seeking to promote commercial revitalization through economic incentives from the National Main Street Program. Highlandtown is one of Baltimore's traditional blue-collar neighborhoods, and for this reason was designated as part of the Patterson Park/Highlandtown Historic District in the National Register of Historic Places.Patterson Park/Highlandtown Historic District In Baltimorese the neighborhood is pronounced \\"Hollantown\\". Historically one of the city's main commercial and industrial hubs, the neighborhood suffered a period of decline beginning in the 1970s as the manufacturing sector declined and department stores were replaced by shopping malls. Highlandtown was once known as a \\"Little Appalachia\\" or a \\"hillbilly ghetto.\\" Before, during, and after World War II many Appalachian migrants settled in Baltimore, including in Highlandtown. Appalachian people who migrated to Highlandtown were largely economic migrants who came looking for work. Modern Highlandtown is in transition. The German, Polish, Czech, Italian, Irish, Greek, and Ukrainian population are being augmented with a growing Latino community. The headquarters of the Baltimore Science Fiction Society can be found on the northern edge of Highlandtown. Former United States Senator Barbara Mikulski grew up in Highlandtown. The easternmost eight blocks are occupied by parallel-running north‚Äìsouth streets that start with consecutive letters of the alphabet, from B to H: Baylis, Conkling, Dean, Eaton, Fagley, Grundy and Haven. This scheme continues in Greektown to the east, and resets at Bayview. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 7,820 people living in the neighborhood. The racial makeup of Highlandtown was 42.3% white, 34% Hispanic, 19.7% African American, and 5% all other (Asians, Native Americans etc.). Most of the Hispanic population consist of Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Salvadorans, Dominicans, Hondurans, Nicaraguans, Cubans, and Colombians, among others. 59.8% of occupied housing units were owner-occupied. 15.5% of housing units were vacant. 52.0% of the population were employed, 5.0% were unemployed, and 42.7% were not in the labor force. The median household income was $28,813. About 14.8% of families and 22.6% of the population were below the poverty line.

The relationship is well described in the literature. The logarithmic profile of wind speeds is generally limited to the lowest 100 m of the atmosphere (i.e., the surface layer of the atmospheric boundary layer). The rest of the atmosphere is composed of the remaining part of the planetary boundary layer (up to around 1000 m) and the troposphere or free atmosphere. In the free atmosphere, geostrophic wind relationships should be used. Definition The equation to estimate the mean wind speed (u_z) at height z (meters) above the ground is: u_z = \\\\frac{u_*}{\\\\kappa} \\\\left[\\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{z-d}{z_0} \\\\right) + \\\\psi(z,z_0,L)\\\\right] where u_* is the friction velocity (m s‚àí1), \\\\kappa is the Von K√°rm√°n constant (~0.41), d is the zero plane displacement (in metres), z_0 is the surface roughness (in meters), and \\\\psi is a stability term where L is the Obukhov length from Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. Under neutral stability conditions, z/L = 0 and \\\\psi drops out and the equation is simplified to, u_z = \\\\frac{u_*}{\\\\kappa} \\\\left[\\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{z-d}{z_0} \\\\right)\\\\right]. Zero-plane displacement (d) is the height in meters above the ground at which zero wind speed is achieved as a result of flow obstacles such as trees or buildings. It can be approximated as 2/3 to 3/4 of the average height of the obstacles.Holmes JD. Wind Loading of Structures. 3rd ed. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press; 2015. For example, if estimating winds over a forest canopy of height 30 m, the zero-plane displacement could be estimated as d = 20 m. Roughness length (z_0) is a corrective measure to account for the effect of the roughness of a surface on wind flow. That is, the value of the roughness length depends on the terrain. The exact value is subjective and references indicate a range of values, making it difficult to give definitive values. In most cases, references present a tabular format with the value of z_0 given for certain terrain descriptions. For example, for very flat terrain (snow, desert) the roughness length may be in the range 0.001 to 0.005 m. Similarly, for open terrain (grassland) the typical range is 0.01-0.05 m. For cropland, and brush/forest the ranges are 0.1-0.25 m and 0.5-1.0 m respectively. When estimating wind loads on structures the terrains may be described as suburban or dense urban, for which the ranges are typically 0.1-0.5 m and 1-5 m respectively. In order to estimate the mean wind speed at one height ({{z}_{2}}) based on that at another ({{z}_{1}}), the formula would be rearranged, u({{z}_{2}})=u({{z}_{1}})\\\\frac{\\\\ln \\\\left( ({{z}_{2}}-d)/{{z}_{0}} \\\\right)}{\\\\ln \\\\left( ({{z}_{1}}-d)/{{z}_{0}} \\\\right)}, where u({{z}_{1}}) is the mean wind speed at height {{z}_{1}}. Limits The log wind profile is generally considered to be a more reliable estimator of mean wind speed than the wind profile power law in the lowest 10‚Äì20 m of the planetary boundary layer. Between 20 m and 100 m both methods can produce reasonable predictions of mean wind speed in neutral atmospheric conditions. From 100 m to near the top of the atmospheric boundary layer the power law produces more accurate predictions of mean wind speed (assuming neutral atmospheric conditions). The neutral atmospheric stability assumption discussed above is reasonable when the hourly mean wind speed at a height of 10 m exceeds 10 m/s where turbulent mixing overpowers atmospheric instability.

Water supply projects During the dry season when the water supply of Darjeeling from Senchal Lake becomes short, water is often pumped from Khong Khola to the town. In 2002, the Darjeeling Municipality submitted proposals for four drinking water projects to the state government. These proposals involve construction of water reservoirs, as follows: A Sindhap ground reservoir at an estimated cost of Rs 6.6 million; a Rungdung Khola water project at an estimated cost of Rs 46 million; a Khong Khola water project at estimated cost of Rs 2 million, and a Senchal Lake water reservoir at an estimated cost of Rs 14 million. Drinking-water problem in Darjeeling Natural springs in the Senchal Range provide most of Darjeeling's water supply. Water collected is routed through stone conduits to two lakes that were constructed in 1910 and 1932, from where it is piped to the town after purification at the Jorebungalow filtration plant. However, there is a steadily widening gap between water supply and demand; just over 50% of the town's households are connected to the municipal water supply system.

Early life Shastri was born in Varanasi, India where his father Madhav Raj and mother Ratna Maya Joshi were living in forced exile due to political reasons. Madhav Raj was a leader of the Arya Samaj in Nepal. The Joshis were originally from Lalitpur.Whelpton, John (2005). A History of Nepal. Cambridge University Press. , . Page 79. Shukra Raj was schooled in India, and he acquired the title Shastri after earning a Shastri degree from Dehradun. He became better known by this name than his actual surname Joshi. Democracy fighter Returning to Nepal, Shastri joined the democracy struggle. During a demonstration organized at Indra Chok, Kathmandu by the Citizens' Rights Committee, he spoke out strongly against the Rana regime and demanded the people's rights. For this act, he was arrested and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. He was subsequently sentenced to death, and on 24 January 1941, he was hanged from a tree on the side of the road at Pachali, Teku, Kathmandu. The Ranas were eventually overthrown in February 1951, and democracy was established in Nepal. The Rana oligarchy ruled Nepal from 1846 until 1951. During this time, the Shah king was reduced to a figurehead and the prime minister and other government positions were hereditary. Jang Bahadur Rana established the Rana dynasty in 1846 by masterminding the Kot massacre in which about 40 members of the nobility including the prime minister and a relative of the king were murdered. Tyranny, debauchery, economic exploitation and religious persecution characterized Rana rule. This 104-years of Rana regime has been called as one of the darkest periods of Nepalese history. Writer Shastri was one of the leaders of the Nepal Bhasa renaissance. Page 87. He wrote a grammar of the language entitled Nepal Bhasa Vyakaran which was published from Kolkata in 1928.

He spent most of his reign in constant conflict with other Nepali kingdoms including that of Prithvi Narayan Shah in the Battle of Kathmandu. He was the last king of Kathmandu (at that time, Kathmandu functioned as an independent state or principality) before King Prithvi Narayan Shah attacked Kathmandu when the Kathmandu city folk were celebrating the festival of Indrajatra and conquered it. He contributed to the literature of Nepal Bhasa with works such as \\"Padma Samuchaya\\" and three dramas that were concerned with Hindu mythology being Ratneshwar Pradurbhav, Birdhwojopakhyan Natakam and Bhairavpradurbhav.Baidhya, Janaklal: Nepalbhasha ya Prachin Kabyra Sirjana, p. 118; ) When Gorkhali king Prithvi Narayan Shah attacked Nuwakot, a protectorate of Kantipur, Jaya Prakash Malla sent troops under Kashiram Thapa. The battle occurred in 1746 where Kashiram Thapa lost the war and Jaya Prakash Malla thought of deceit. Jaya Prakash Malla was angered and killed him. In the day of Indrajatra , when there was festival going on, Prithvi Narayan Shah attacked Yen (Kantipur). Jaya Prakash Malla was helpless and he went to Lalitpur to seek asylum. Tej Narasimha Malla ruled that kingdom. After some time Prithvi Narayan Shah attacked Lalitpur and Jaya Prakash Malla along with Tej Narasimha Malla ran to Bhaktapur to seek asylum.

The Augustine priory is situated alongside King's River beside the village of Kells in the townland of Rathduff (Madden), about 15 km south of the medieval city of Kilkenny. The priory is a National Monument and is in the guardianship of the Office of Public Works. One of its most striking features is a collection of medieval tower houses spaced at intervals along and within walls which enclose a site of just over . These give the priory the appearance more of a fortress than of a place of worship and from them comes its local name of \\"Seven Castles\\". 4 km southeast of the priory on the R697 regional road is Kilree round tower and 9th century High Cross, said to be the burial place of Niall Caille. It was used in the film Barry Lyndon as the location for the English Redcoat encampment.movie-locations.com -Barry Lyndon film locations History left Kells Priory was founded by Geoffrey FitzRobert in 1193. FitzRobert was brother-in-law to Strongbow and the priory succeeded an earlier church that was dedicated to St. Mary, the Blessed Virgin and served as parish church to nearby Kells village. During its first century and a half the priory was attacked and burned on three occasions, firstly by Lord William de Bermingham in 1252, by the Scots army of Edward Bruce on Palm Sunday 1326, and by a second William de Bermingham in 1327. It seems likely then that the walls and fortifications date back to this period of unrest. In 1324 the Bishop of Ossory Richard de Ledrede paid a lenten visit to the priory. Following an inquisition into a Kilkenny sect of heretics, Alice Kyteler and William Outlawe were ordered to appear before the Bishop to answer charges of witchcraft. Outlaw was supported by Arnold de Paor, Lord of Kells who arrested the Bishop and had him imprisoned in Kilkenny Castle for 17 days. This caused great scandal and on his release, the Bishop successfully prosecuted the heretics. Alice Kyteler fled to England and remained there, Alice Smith also fled, but her maidservant Petronilla de Meath became Ireland's first heretic to be burned at the stake. Dissolution of Kells Priory finally took place in March 1540 and the church and property were surrendered to James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormonde.  Layout  The priory is divided into two parts, an inner monastic Precinct alongside the river and a large outer enclosure to the south. In the fifteenth century, the latter was referred to as Villa Prioris but in more recent times it has been known as Burgher's Court, the Burgess or Burgess Court. Burgess Court is adopted here because it best reflects the purpose for which it was constructed. In the past Burgess Court was thought to have been the site of the medieval borough of Kell but modern research has shown that this was not the case. Today all the monastic remains are grouped together in the Precinct while Burgess Court is little more than a walled field populated by tourists and sheep.  Excavations  Tom Fanning, a state archaeologist and subsequently senior archaeology lecturer in NUI Galway began an excavation of the site in 1972, his work was completed by Miriam Clyne after Mr. Fanning's death in 1993. The excavation is one of the largest ever undertaken in Ireland at a monastic house and the publication by , Kells Priory, Co. Kilkenny: archaeological excavations by T. Fanning & M. Clyne, is one of the largest ever published on a rural medieval site.Gormley Launches Kells Priory Publication There were some 20,000 archaeological finds which range from pieces of carved stone, pottery including Ham Green, floor and ridge tiles, metal objects as well as a collection of painted window glass which has allowed the reconstruction what some of the window patterns may have looked like. The original priory church was a simple cruciform building, but, over time, was extended in almost every possible direction including the fifteenth-century second enclosure.

Biography He was born on December 28, 1882 to Irish immigrants. He studied architecture at Cooper Union and at age 35 served in World War I as a staff officer in the 105th Field Artillery. Deegan later joined the United States Army Corps of Engineers as a major, where he supervised the construction of military bases in the New York area under the command of General George W. Goethals. After the war he helped organize the American Legion in 1919, advancing to State Commander in 1921. Deegan worked as an architect at a number of distinguished firms, including McKim, Mead, and White; Post, Magnicke and Franke; and Starrett and Van Vieck. Later in life he held a number of political positions, most of them in the Bronx. Deegan was President of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce until the chamber grew critical of Mayor Jimmy Walker, at which point he resigned.

It was founded in 1936 by two Alliance, Nebraska natives, Peary Rader and his wife, Mabel Rader. History The magazine's first print run of fifty copies was done via a duplicating machine which sat on their dining room table. Iron Man started out as an educational vehicle to inform and enlighten those people who were interested in weightlifting, bodybuilding and eventually, powerlifting. The magazine is published in Oxnard, California and printed in Kentucky. The focus of Iron Man Magazine during its first fifty years was on all three sports, with emphasis on weight training in general as a life-enhancing activity. Iron Man at one time stressed the health and character building aspects of weight training, though it later shifted its focus to hardcore bodybuilding. In the early 1950s, Iron Man Magazine was the first weight-training publication to show women working out with weights as part of their overall fitness regimen. It even went so far as to show a pregnant woman training with weights and educating readers on the benefits of exercise during pregnancy; thoroughly modern concepts decades ahead of their time. In the late 1950s to early 1960s, Iron Man was the first to talk about high-quality proteins derived from milk and eggs as well as liquid amino acids. By this time, the bimonthly magazine had acquired over 30,000 subscribers simply on the strength of its information. The Raders never worked at expanding its circulation. It grew by word of mouth; fueled by Iron Man's ability to provide reliable information. By 1970, Arthur Jones had created the first Nautilus prototype. He was eager to share his exercise concepts with the world, but every magazine except Iron Man turned him down. Peary Rader saw the potential of the Nautilus concept and in keeping with Iron Man's goal to remain an open forum for ideas, Rader embraced Jones' enthusiasm and ideas. Iron Man was the leader in bringing Nautilus to the marketplace and the only publication to stand behind it. The entire exercise machine industry today was built on the shoulders of the Nautilus. By the early 1980s, the Raders (now in their seventies) had spent nearly fifty years working long hours to put out a bimonthly publication. In 1986, the Raders sold the magazine to John Balik, who repositioned the magazine as a hardcore bodybuilding publication. Iron Man Magazine has featured covers with athletes from both hardcore and natural bodybuilding including: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jay Cutler, Sebastian Siegel, Michael O'Hearn, Bob Paris, Scott Steiner in 2000,Lee Haney and Lee Labrada. It's also famous for publishing numerous swimsuit issues. In 1993 the editorial offices of Iron Man magazine moved to Oxnard, California.

The character was created by editor and co-plotter Julius Schwartz, writer Gardner Fox and penciler Gil Kane. The Atom was one of the first superheroes of the Silver Age of Comic Books and debuted in Showcase #34 (October 1961). The Atom has been played in various TV series by Alfie Wise and John Kassir. He was currently played by Brandon Routh in Legends of Tomorrow in the shared DC Arrowverse on The CW. His character first appeared in the third season of Arrow. Publication history The Atom debuted in Showcase #34 (cover-dated Oct. 1961) from the DC Comics precursor, National Comics.Showcase #34 at the Grand Comics Database. Early comics-fandom pioneer Jerry Bails wrote to the National Comics editor Julius Schwartz in December 1960 outlining an updated version of Al Pratt, the company's 1940s Golden Age Atom. Bails and future Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Roy Thomas collaborated on a suggested version that incorporated elements of a Golden Age hero, Quality Comics' Doll Man.Thomas, \\"Splitting the Atom\\", pp. 8-9 Eventual Atom writer Gardner Fox wrote Bails on January 1, 1961, stating that Schwartz passed along Bails' letter to him. Schwartz wrote Bails on January 6 saying he had already been planning a new version of the Atom, in the vein of National's reimagined Golden Age superheroes the Flash and Green Lantern, and had already asked artist Gil Kane to sketch designs.Schwartz letter to Bails, reprinted in Thomas, \\"Splitting the Atom\\", p. 10 Kane, unaware of Bails' suggestions,Thomas, \\"Splitting the Atom\\", p. 11 said he did \\"a series of drawings\\" on large illustration boards, including a depiction of the new Atom riding a German shepherd dog and another of a pistol firing at the Atom, who wore the costume he eventually would in his comic debut but without a belt.Thomas, \\"Splitting the Atom\\", p. 10 Kane, who lived in Jericho, New York, on Long Island, at the time, drove to the nearby Hicksville home of DC production person Tom Nicolosi, who colored the drawings using St. Martin's dyes. Schwartz, after seeing the drawings, had the belt added, a detail Kane said he disliked since \\"it broke up the costume lines.\\"Kane in Thomas, \\"Splitting the Atom\\", p. 11 Schwartz said he had not wanted to reuse the Golden Age Atom, Al Pratt, and had read about dwarf stars and thought a fragment of one could power the new hero's miniaturization. He added that he and Fox together plotted the early stories of this new Silver Age Atom.Thomas, \\"Splitting the Atom\\", p. 13 Fox said in 1979, \\"I doubt that any feedback from Bails or Thomas had very much of an influence, though always kept their ideas in the back of our minds.\\"March 26, 1979, letter from Fox to James Flanagan, published in Robin Snyder's History of Comics vol. 2, #2 (Feb. 1991) and quoted in Thomas, \\"Splitting the Atom\\", p. 14 His alter ego, Ray Palmer, is an homage to science-fiction magazine editor Raymond A. Palmer. Fictional character biography =Silver Age= Raymond \\"Ray\\" Palmer, is a physicist and professor at Ivy University in the fictional city of Ivy Town, somewhere in New England, specializing in matter compression as a means to fight overpopulation, famine and other world problems. Using a mass of white dwarf star matter he finds after it lands on Earth, Palmer fashions a lens that enables him to shrink any object to any degree he wishes. Compression destabilizes an object's molecular structure, however, causing it to explode. Ray Palmer with his girlfriend and later wife, Jean Loring. Art by Gil Kane and Murphy Anderson from Showcase #34 (Oct. 1961). During a spelunking expedition, Palmer and his students, along with his girlfriend, lawyer Jean Loring, find themselves trapped in a cave. In desperation, Palmer secretly uses the lens he has carried with him to shrink himself in order to be able to climb through a small opening in the fallen rocks sealing the cave, knowing he will likely explode. Using a diamond engagement ring, Palmer enlarges the hole sufficiently and descends to the floor to try to alert the others of the escape route before dying. However, upon entering the lens' beam, he finds himself returned to normal size and without danger of exploding. As the lens is covered with cave moisture, Palmer believes this has altered the beam to allow this strange effect. When subsequent experiments still result in objects exploding, Palmer concludes some unknown force in his own body allows him to safely size-shift. He decides to use this effect to become a superhero. A retcon in Brightest Day: The Atom Special (July 2010) removes the influence of his exotic physical makeup, tying his survival instead to the discovery of a compression matrix, a fabric able to spread the effects of the ray on the entire body, stabilizing it. The prototype matrix later became his costume.Brightest Day: The Atom Special (July 2010) Palmer creates a belt tool to control his miniaturization to subatomic size with an emergency backup mechanism in his gloves, and develops a costume that he can wear at most times that only becomes visible when he shrinks significantly. In addition, he develops equipment that allows him to decrease his weight in addition to his size, allowing him to glide on air currents on a low setting, while a high setting allows him to handle or strike objects with the equivalent strength of his normal size and build. A favorite travel method is to call some location on the telephone and when the phone is answered, Palmer can shrink enough to travel through the phone lines in seconds to emerge out the answering phone. He carries out the bulk of his early superheroic adventures in Ivy Town, where he often helps his girlfriend, Jean Loring, win her cases. Much later, he gains the innate equivalent powers within his own body. Palmer has fought against several alien and supernatural threats, as well as having his own rogues gallery: his arch enemy is Chronos the Time Bandit, the menace of the Bug-Eyed Bandit, the dangerous eco-terrorist Floronic Man, and the miniature misguided Bat-Knights of Elvaran. He also had several time travel adventures by means of Professor Alpheus V. Hyatt's Time Pool. The Atom is a member of several incarnations of the Justice League, and the team is gracious enough to supply a special chair scaled to his default size which can elevate to whatever height needed so he can easily partake in team meetings without having to go out of costume. There, he meets Hawkman (Katar Hol pre-Hawkworld, Carter Hall post-Hawkworld), one of his closest friends in the superhero community. Neither character achieved major popularity, and even in their heyday were mostly supporting characters, often with Palmer as a specialist in size alteration who was often needed to access extremely confined areas only he could access. Hawkman would manufacture prosthetic wings for a myna Ray saved, taking on the name Major Mynah and became the Atom's partner and steed. =Sword of the Atom, Power of the Atom, and Teen Titans= Sword of the Atom #3. Cover art by Gil Kane. The Atom had one short-lived miniseries and three subsequent specials, all titled Sword of the Atom, in which Palmer abandons civilization after divorcing his wife Jean, who had an affair with fellow lawyer Paul Hoben, and becomes the hero of a tribe of six-inch (152 mm) -tall yellow-skinned humanoid aliens called Morlaidhans in the jungles of South America. He also becomes consort to their princess, Laethwyn. Palmer bequeathes his size-changing belt and role as Ivy Town's protector to Jean's new husband, Hoben. During this time, Palmer's friend Norman Brawler pens the book The Atom's Farewell, in which he reveals Palmer's identity as the Atom. Eventually the colony is destroyed, despite Palmer's attempt to save it, by a group associated with the US Government acting as loggers.Power of the Atom #1 Palmer is forced to escape via the telephone to North America. In the attempt, he fails to anticipate that the connection will involve satellite relay and the unexpectedly arduous trip causes him to remain at approximately three feet high and without his costume's size changing equipment. With the help of a friend, Ray creates a new costume from the material of the white dwarf star. This time, instead of a belt, Palmer uses an encephalotronic grid in the costume's headpiece to control the costume. The grid is keyed to his unique brainwaves. This enables him to transfer his mass into an unknown dimension which allows him to alter his size and weight just by thinking about it. He can even make the new costume appear or disappear with a thought by shifting most of its atoms to or from the other dimension. This allows him to be in costume while at full height or to shrink without having to have his costume appear. He can even increase his weight while remaining six inches (152 mm) tall or reduce his weight while remaining at full size. Ray often does this and is then light enough to ride wind currents, where he actually appears to be flying to a limited degree. Palmer also develops a mental link with the white dwarf matter to which he has been regularly exposed. Most of the mass lies within another dimension. Ray can draw upon that mass and hit with a super-concussive force. He has been shown to punch through concrete walls, crush an exam table and break the axle of a car that is moving at high speed. Power of the Atom #7, depicting the Atom in his new costume Palmer would learn of those behind the genocide of the Morlaidhans, namely five CIA operatives, part of a group called the Cabal. In a mission called Operation: Fireball, the tiny aliens were murdered in hopes Ray would return as the Atom and become a tool for the Cabal (as Ray worked for the CIA in his earlier years). Instead, Palmer shrank the five agents to six-inch height and the CIA would employ them as a group called Micro/Squad. The Atom would take on new enemies during this period, such as Humbug, a sentient robot in control of an army of duplicates of itself, and Strobe, a technological armor-clad crook. Micro/Squad would also return, attempting to murder Palmer for what he did to them. Instead, teammate Ginsburg dies in the explosion they set and Ray approaches Adam Cray about becoming the new Atom in order to bring the remaining Micro/Squad into the open. Cray agrees, steals Paul Hoben's size-changing belt, and joins the Suicide Squad. The plan works as the villains emerge and Palmer takes the place of operative Sting; but their leader, Blacksnake, kills Cray and takes the belt for himself, returning to normal height. Blacksnake murders the remaining members of his crew as Ray arrives, revealing himself, posing as Sting, and battles him. After Blacksnake is defeated, the Cabal employs Task Force X II to murder him in order to protect their secrets. Later, during the events of Zero Hour, Palmer is rejuvenated to a teenage state and develops the ability to grow in height in addition to his previous abilities, all of which he was capable of controlling innately without using his white dwarf star- based equipment. He becomes field leader of a new group of Teen Titans, composed of hybrids of human beings and the H'San Natall, after a chance meeting with Isaiah Crockett on his first day attending Ivy University. As a former member of the Justice League, Palmer viewed his affiliation with the Teen Titans as a step backward. The group primarily battled the Veil, an anti- alien organization that employed Deathstroke and Dark Nemesis, but it's revealed that their leader Pylon was actually a H'San Natall. They would also face Jugular (hired by the H'San Natall) and Loren Jupiter's son Jarrod, aka Haze. The Atom's new growth powers were instrumental in the battle against Sekhmet of the Millennium Giants. Ray subsequently regains his original age and memories and loses his new powers after he begins to rapidly age and Waverider has to use DNA taken prior to his rejuvenation to restore him to his original state. Palmer returns to his teaching job at Ivy University, but also becomes an associate and alternate member of the JLA. With his exit from the Teen Titans, the group disbands. One notable student under Palmer was Ronnie Raymond, who, without the knowledge of elements of Martin Stein, found difficulty in fully employing his abilities as Firestorm. = Identity Crisis and Countdown = In the 2004-05 limited series Identity Crisis, Jean Loring kills Sue Dibny, the wife of the Elongated Man. After stealing some of the Atom's shrinking technology and his costume, she kills Sue in a misguided attempt to win Palmer back. She also arranges a hit on Tim Drake's father which is carried out by Captain Boomerang (Digger Harkness). The intent is for Jack Drake to kill some random attacker, but both manage to kill each other. After committing her to Arkham Asylum, Palmer shrinks himself to microscopic size and disappears. Palmer eventually meets up with his old friend Carter Hall after microscopically traveling through phone lines. He warns Hall of the consequences of mindwiping Batman and of harassing criminals over a crime that is perpetrated by Jean, one of their own. Palmer explains he needs time away, and shrinks himself again after Hall agrees to keep the meeting secret. His legacy lived on, however. Ryan Choi, a student of Physics in Hong Kong that corresponded with Ray Palmer via mail in the past, found a copy of his costume and shrinking device to become the current Atom. Around this same time, an unnamed teenager with powers similar to Palmer joins the Teen Titans under the name Molecule. After a brief tenure with the team, he is later killed during a confrontation with the Terror Titans. During the missing year, Palmer's technology is employed by Supernova to shrink and grow in size in order to enter and exit the bottle city of Kandor.

During the crisis, Palmer was able to deduce with the heroes that the black rings are simulations taking the identities of the deceased and needing to feed. The Indigo Tribe take the heroes to the Hall of Justice, unceremoniously taking Hal Jordan and abandoning the rest when the Black Lanterns renew their attack.Blackest Night #3 (September 2009) Palmer helps the heroes escape via a phone line, and then brings them to the JSA, who were also being attacked by Black Lanterns.

Indigo-1 claims that she can teleport the armies of each Lantern Corps onto Earth, if given time to meditate. The responsibility falls to Palmer to protect her while she does so. Before she enters her trance, she reveals to Palmer that the indigo staff and his overwhelming compassion allows him to mimic the other powers of the Lantern Corps; she demonstrates this by temporarily becoming a Red Lantern and vomiting corrosive blood all over an attacking company of Black Lanterns. She then enters her trance, while Palmer fights off Black Lanterns Hawkman and Hawkgirl by temporarily becoming an Orange Lantern, loudly proclaiming \\"I want my friends back!\\" He then summons two orange energy duplicates of Khufu and Chay-Ara to help him fight off his and Indigo-1's attackers. He is briefly successful. But then Jean shows up to torment him, and she leaps into Indigo-1's ring. Palmer follows her. He ends up reliving Sue Dibny's death, and is then attacked by various Black Lantern Morlaidhans, the minuscule race he befriended during Sword of the Atom. He fights them off and, summoning the powers of a Green Lantern, destroys Jean. Indigo-1 manages to summon the various armies and thanks Palmer for his help. He tells her to keep his involvement in the deployment of the troops a secret, and asks that she help him find a way to legitimately resurrect Hawkman and Hawkgirl.The Atom and Hawkman #46 (January 2010) In the final battle, Palmer gets his wish when Hawkman and Hawkgirl are brought back to life by power of white light at the end of the Blackest Night series.Blackest Night #8 (March 2010) Ray's involvement of secret resurrect remains unknown. =Brightest Day and Adventure Comics co-feature= In July 2010 Ray Palmer had a Brightest Day one-shot that led to a co-feature in Adventure Comics.

When Ryan goes to get Ray from his workshop where he has seemingly been confined for a week, he instead finds a video recording from Ray. In it he reveals he discovered a universe beyond the subatomic, a so-called Microverse while investigating a disruption in space and time, and within he found something that posed an existential threat to their universe. He asks Ryan, the only other person who knows how to use the Atom's technology and whom Ray trusts, to go into it, rescue him, and finish his work. Ray informs Ryan that upon arrival he will also meet with someone who he himself has encountered. He tries to warn Ryan about something, but the footage cuts out abruptly before he can finish.DC Universe: Rebirth one-shot (May 2016) When Batman begins recruiting for his new Justice League of America, he chooses Ray as one the members of the new league, however when he enters Ray's office he finds Ryan instead.

Together they recover a starship located on the living planet Moz-Ga which belonged to several of Hall's past lives.Hawkman #6 (October 2018) Powers and abilities The Atom possesses the power to alter his size down to the subatomic level while retaining his natural strength level. This is accomplished by using the remnants of a white-dwarf star made into a belt buckle worn with his costume. Originally, he had to manipulate his abilities via the belt, and later with hand movements, before eventually syncing directly with his brain via mental commands. The Atom is one of the few heroes in the DC Universe that has 100% control over his body on the molecular level (Plastic Man being another), thus making him exponentially more powerful than he is often portrayed; he is limited only by his application of his powers. Some of the applications he has demonstrated include reducing his mass to glide through the air (simulating flight, like Wonder Woman) and increasing his mass to punch through concrete. He also demonstrated the ability to make his costume appear and disappear at will by shifting its atoms between this dimension and another. During Countdown to Final Crisis, Palmer learned he could shrink down beyond the Subatomic scale in order to traverse the Multiverse by slipping below the quantum layer beneath reality.Countdown to Final Crisis #18 (December 2007) He has been shown to be able to ride phone lines to his destination by dialing a number and traveling through the handset (his signature use of his power), and recently shrinking small enough to travel on photon signals through fiber optic cable.Blackest Night #4 (October 2009) Some of The Atom's more impressive feats include shrinking into Superman's bloodstream and manually rearranging his molecules to create Kryptonite and defusing Black Lantern Al Pratt's Atomic Punch and resizing within him, ripping his body apart in the process. Following the events of Zero Hour, the Atom gained the ability to also grow in size and internalizes his other abilities without the use of his white dwarf star-based apparatus. However, when returned to his natural age, these abilities were lost. As a member of the Indigo Tribe, Ray possessed an indigo power ring powered by compassion, which provided him with flight, energy projection, and a protective force field. He also utilised a staff capable of duplicating the abilities of other wielders of the Emotional spectrum within range. He has also shown the ability to allow others to shrink down with him if the situation requires it, such as when he shrank himself, Superman, Flash, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Plastic Man to repair the links between seven shattered subatomic particles, or shrinking Steel, Supergirl and Superboy to directly treat a kryptonite tumor in Superman's body. However, this ability is relatively limited; initially anyone other than himself who was shrunk would explode after two minutes if not returned to their normal size, although by the time he sent Superman's allies into the Man of Steel, he was able to extend this time to around an hour.

The group, dubbed Micro/Squad, composed of Mr. Baily, Ms. Hubbard, Ginsburg, Sting, and led by Blacksnake, returned and believed they murdered Palmer in an explosion.

Other versions =The Dark Knight Strikes Again= Frank Miller portrayed Ray Palmer as a major player in Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again.

He was then instrumental in the liberation of Kandor, gaining access to the bottle by 'hiding' inside Lara- the daughter of Superman and Wonder Woman- when she confronted Brainiac, slipping inside the bottle to break it from the inside and allowing the Kryptonians within to gain superpowers to defeat Brainiac. In The Dark Knight III: The Master Race, Palmer attempts to restore the natives of Kandor to their full height, but is instead tricked into reviving a twisted Kryptonian cult, whose leader proceeds to crush Palmer and Kandor. =League of Justice= Other re-imaginings of the Atom include an appearance in League of Justice, an Elseworlds story portraying the Justice League in a The Lord of the Rings-type story where the Atom was recast as a wizard/fortune teller called \\"Atomus The Palmer\\". =JLA: Age of Wonders= In JLA: Age of Wonder, Ray Palmer worked with a science consortium whose members at one point included Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. =JLA: Rock of Ages= In JLA: Rock Of Ages, the Atom is part of what remains of the Justice League in an alternate future where Darkseid has taken control of the Earth.

The Justice League arrives and battles a group of monsters while searching for the Ultimate Nullifier, but Ray stays behind after a brief confrontation with the Avengers, where he sees them meeting with Metron who gives a story different from the one given to the League by The Grandmaster. Intrigued at this turn of events, Ray jumped on Metron's chair, which took him to the Grandmaster's base. When Batman and Captain America arrive, having tracked Metron with the aid of equipment provided by the Fantastic Four, he shows them that while the Grandmaster is trying to stop Krona, his team in his game is the League, rather than his own universe's Avengers. When the Grandmaster merges the universes to stop Krona, Ray disappears until the two teams join up to go after Krona himself. Ray participates in the battle and ends up disappearing after Krona's defeat. =DC: The New Frontier= In DC: The New Frontier, Ray Palmer doesn't become the Atom but is a leading scientist in using lenses to shrink matter.

In the sequel, the Flash and the Atom are briefly sent to the Earth of the Crime Syndicate of America during the dimensional anomalies caused by the limbo cell, with the Atom observing that the Syndicate's tendency to steal everything they have prevents them from understanding the true nature of their current threat. Despite their efforts, the two only return to their world after the Limbo Cell has been defeated. =Countdown to Final Crisis= In Countdown to Final Crisis, The Search for Ray Palmer and Countdown: Arena (2007), a number of alternate versions of Ray are introduced. * On Earth-6, Ray Palmer has developed solar powers and taken the name of superhero the Ray. * Ray's counterpart on Earth-11 is a woman on a gender-reversed world. * The Jessica Palmer of Earth-15 is a young physicist on a world of efficient second- and third-generation heroes. * On Earth-30 in the Superman: Red Son limited series, Ray is an American scientist living in Russia. * On Earth-51, a younger Ray's life is cut short during a dangerous experiment.

He was voiced by Pat Harrington, Jr., who would be better known a decade later for his role as Dwayne F. Schneider on the sitcom One Day at a Time. * Ray also made occasional appearances on The All-New Super Friends Hour and Super Friends voiced by Wally Burr. * Ray Palmer was featured in the DCAU. ** In the Justice League episode \\"Hereafter Pt. 2\\" Vandal Savage mentions his attempted theft of one of Ray Palmer's inventions resulted in the death of everyone except Savage. ** Ray Palmer eventually appeared in Justice League Unlimited voiced by John C. McGinley. He first appears in \\"The Return\\" to help Lex Luthor defend himself against Amazo by building a nanotechnology- disabling laser that would deactivate Amazo. When it fails, Atom shrinks himself and Lex Luthor only for Amazo to follow them. In \\"Dark Heart\\" (written by Warren Ellis), Atom helps the Justice League disable a grey goo-like alien weapon known as the Dark Heart which uses nanotechnology to replicate its forces. He manages to disable it, which also deactivated its forces. The Atom's final vocalized appearance was in \\"Clash,\\" when he examined a device built by Lex Luthor which Superman had mistaken for a bomb. In \\"Panic in the Sky,\\" Atom was shown in his small form unconscious before Supergirl's fight with Galatea. * Ray Palmer appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Sword of the Atom!\\" voiced by Peter Scolari. In the episode, it is revealed that Ray had been the original Atom and Ryan Choi's mentor, but that he had eventually retired and moved to the Amazon. There, he encountered the Morlaidhans and Princess Laethwyn. After teaming up with Batman, Ryan and Aquaman to defeat a traitorous and xenophobic Chancellor Deraegis, Ray chooses to stay in the Amazon as Laethwyn's lover. * Ray Palmer appears in Young Justice voiced by Jason Marsden. He is first mentioned in the episode \\"Agendas\\" where he is considered for membership in the Justice League. In episode \\"Usual Suspects\\", Ray becomes a member of the Justice League. In episode \\"Auld Acquaintance\\", Ray is shown as one of the infected Leaguers by the Starro Tech of Vandal Savage and then he is cured by Miss Martian. In episode \\"Happy New Year\\", Bumblebee mentions that she has a lab assignment with Dr. Palmer and has to postpone a date with Mal Duncan. In \\"True Colors,\\" Atom and Bumblebee attempt a micro-surgery to get the Scarab off of Jaime Reyes only for them to be extracted when the Blue Beetle Scarab started producing antibodies to fight them off. * Jason Marsden reprises his role of the Atom in the DC Nation Short titled \\"Sword of the Atom.\\" * Ray Palmer appears in Justice League Action, voiced by Jerry O'Connell. Live- action * The Atom appeared in \\"The Roast\\", the second of two 1979 live- action TV specials aired under the umbrella title Legends of the Superheroes. In \\"The Roast\\", the Atom (played by Alfie Wise) is engaged to marry villainess Giganta (played by actress A'leshia Brevard). * The Atom appeared in the 1997 live action TV series pilot, Justice League of America played by John Kassir. =Arrowverse= Brandon Routh as Ray Palmer/The Atom Brandon Routh portrays Dr. Raymond \\"Ray\\" Palmer / The Atom in The CW's Arrowverse. Unlike most versions, Ray's suit does not solely shrink himself and other obejcts; instead, it was originally designed as a combat exosuit with blasters, capable of flight. * Ray Palmer first appears as a recurring character in Arrow. ** In season three, Ray is a brilliant scientist (with a 140 I.Q. and 4 PhDs) and the CEO of Palmer Technologies (formerly Queen Consolidated, rebranded after he purchases it from receivership). His fianc√©e, Anna Loring, was murdered by Slade Wilson/Deathstroke's Mirakuru men (which takes place during the second season), and he vows to never let anything like Slade's attack happen again. To achieve this, he devotes much of his efforts to building a high tech suit of armor with built-in weapons and flight capability, acquiring the necessary resources from various businessmen. He also has an ambition to rebuild Starling City and rechristen it \\"Star City\\". He hires Felicity Smoak to work for him and becomes romantically attracted to her. He eventually starts dating her, much to the jealousy of Oliver Queen. After succeeding in building his suit, the \\"Arrow\\" (in reality, Maseo Yamashiro framing Oliver on behalf of Ra's al Ghul) begins killing people. Ray uses his suit's x-ray vision feature to discover the real Arrow's identity as Oliver Queen. On learning of Felicity's affection towards Oliver, Ray becomes jealous and tries to apprehend him. However, Oliver defeats Ray and tells him to trust Felicity, and Ray accepts that Oliver is being framed. When Maseo tries to kill Felicity, Ray saves her, but at the cost of his being shot in the chest. He is able to survive by secretly using a new micro-technology to heal himself. Ray later realizes that Felicity is indeed in love with Oliver, and the pair have a civil break-up and decide to resume being friends. In the season finale, Ray assists Team Arrow in their attempt to stop Ra's destroying Starling City with a bio-weapon and partakes in their initial attack on the League's men in Nanda Parbat. After this fails he accompanies them back to Starling City and succeeds in dispersing the antidote, saving hundreds of lives. At the end of the episode, Ray works on a new technology to give his suit the ability to shrink, but is seemingly killed in an explosion that destroys the entire top floor of Palmer Technologies. ** In season four, it is revealed that the explosion, in conjunction with the micro-tech injected into him several weeks before, actually shrunk Ray and his suit to miniature sizes. For months, Ray sends distress calls to Felicity with no response, as she had left the city to be with Oliver. One of these messages is eventually intercepted by Damien Darhk, leader of H.I.V.E., who captures Ray and keeps him in a miniaturized state to use his suit's powers for Darhk's own agenda. Meanwhile, the city is re-branded \\"Star City\\" in Ray's honor, and Felicity inherits Palmer Technologies as part of Ray's will. Felicity begins getting encrypted messages on her phone with him calling her name. After tearfully listening to Ray's last message, Felicity discovers Ray is alive. Team Arrow locates and rescues him and, with the help of Curtis Holt, are able to restore Ray to normal size. However, seeing that Star City has not gotten any better, believing that nobody really cared that he \\"died\\", and that Palmer Technologies is teetering on bankruptcy, Ray concludes that his past life has amounted to nothing. He elects to remain officially dead until he can figure out where he wants his new life to go, but still assists Team Arrow whenever they need help. * Routh portrays Ray during season one of The Flash, in the episode \\"All-Star Team- Up\\". Here, he helps Barry Allen/The Flash deal with a villain using a swarm of cybernetic bees to attack those who ruined her career. He works with Cisco to fix some bugs in the suit and states in the end that the solution was \\"to go smaller\\", a veiled reference to the powers of his comic book counterpart, and forms a friendship with Cisco out of their shared interest in mechanics. Ray also shares Cisco's love for naming super-villains; he and Cisco both come up with \\"Bug-Eyed Bandit\\", and Cisco approves of Ray's naming another metahuman \\"Deathbolt\\" (Arrow, \\"Broken Arrow\\"). Ray is briefly mentioned in the season's penultimate episode, \\"Rogue Air\\"; when Oliver helps Barry fight Eobard Thawne/Reverse-Flash, he shoots him with an arrow that delivers \\"nanites... courtesy of Ray Palmer\\" which temporarily disables Eobard's speed. * Routh reprises his role as Ray in the spin-off series Legends of Tomorrow as part of the main cast. ** In the first season he is recruited by time-traveler Rip Hunter to help him defeat Vandal Savage across the timeline. Ray accepts the offer as he is attracted by the thought of giving his current life meaning after seeing the waste he believes his former life to have been, although his enthusiasm and optimism still occasionally overrides his lack of practical experience. Ray/Atom's suit now has the ability to shrink, and he later uses the suit's technology to grow to gigantic size to defeat a similarly gigantic robot (\\"Leviathan\\"). He also begins a flirtatious friendship with Kendra Saunders, which develops into a romantic relationship and ultimately an engagement. However, when another reincarnation of Carter Hall is located, Ray ends the relationship amicably, knowing that Kendra is meant to be with Carter. Ray also forms something of a bond with Mick Rory/Heat Wave, who nicknames Ray \\"haircut\\", despite being polar opposites in personality. Mick denies any connection between them, but he has protected Ray on occasion and the two work well together, as when they take out the 1958 version of Savage and destroy his meteor before its effects can destroy time. ** Ray returns in the second season, still acting as a member of the Legends. During time in 1942, Ray modifies a Super-Serum provided to the Nazis by Eobard Thawne to save the team's new ally Nate Heywood from his hemophilia, giving Nate the ability to turn into a metallic skinned state. His suit is destroyed during a trip to feudal Japan when it is stolen by a ruthless local warrior, but Mick Rory gives Ray the cold gun that used to belong to the now-deceased Leonard Snart so that he can still act as a hero. When the team travel to Colorado in 1874, Ray rebuilds his suit with dwarf star minerals. In the crossover episode \\"Invasion!\\", Ray notes that Supergirl looks a lot like his cousin, which is a reference to Routh's portrayal of Superman. In season three, Ray begins an ambiguous relationship with Damien Darhk's daughter Nora who is played by Routh's real life wife Courtney Ford The characters during season 5 get married before leaving the waverider and the team. Ray forms a bromance with Nate and in season four agrees to become the host of the demon Neron to save Nate's life. Ray ends up in hell, where he uses his warmth and charm to befriend old Legends enemy Vandal Savage, before being rescued by Nora and John Constantine. * Routh reprises his role in the animated web series Vixen. =Film= * Ray Palmer appeared in Justice League: The New Frontier, voiced by Corey Burton, who was not credited for the role. He provided his flawed shrinking technology, which makes whatever it attempts to shrink explode, to destroy the creature known as \\"The Centre.\\" * An alternate universe version of Ray Palmer appears in Justice League: Gods and Monsters voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. He appears as a scientist who was a part of Lex Luthor's \\"Project Fair Play,\\" a weapons program contingency that would be used to destroy the Justice League if necessary. Ray was first seen driving home with shrunken horses as a result of his experiments with molecular miniaturization. He was ambushed during his ride and killed by a Metal Man secretly designed by Will Magnus to frame Wonder Woman. * The Atom appeared in Teen Titans Go! To the Movies, voiced by Patton Oswalt. =Video games= * Ray Palmer appears in Injustice: Gods Among Us as a non-playable cameo in the Insurgency stage. He is also playable in one of the Joker's S.T.A.R. Labs mission minigame, although he possesses no special moves or abilities, and merely runs and jumps. * Ray Palmer appears as a playable character in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, voiced by Troy Baker. * In Batman: Arkham Knight a locker in Ace Chemicals belongs to Ray Palmer, and an atom symbol is engraved in it. * Ray Palmer is mentioned by Cyborg in Injustice 2 as having been the one who wrote the encryption for Superman's red sun cell. In Ryan Choi's ending, he mentions that Ray has disappeared into the Microverse and left clues that led to Ryan Choi becoming the new Atom. Using Brainiac's technology, he upgrades his suit to go subatomic and rescue Ray in the Microverse. * The Arrowverse version of Ray Palmer appears in Lego DC Super-Villains, with Brandon Routh reprising his role. He appears in the DC TV Super-Heroes DLC pack. Reception This version of Atom was ranked as the 144th Greatest Comic Book Character of All Time by Wizard magazine. IGN also ranked the Atom as the 64th Greatest Comic Book Hero of All Time stating; \\"Of all the superheroes out here, Dr. Ray Palmer might be one of the most brilliant tortured souls imaginable.\\" See also *Ant-Man References External links * Index to the Atom's Earth-1 adventures * Article on the history/legacy of The Atom from the Comics 101 article series by Scott Tipton. * Profile of the Atom from the Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure * The Atom (1961) at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

It is light yellow in colour with very slight green overtones. It is cut in the form of an irregular (although very intricate) nine-sided 126-facet double rose cut, with a weight of 137.27 carats (27.454 g). The stone is also known as the Tuscan, the Tuscany Diamond, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, the Austrian Diamond and the Austrian Yellow Diamond. Disputed history The stone's origins are disputed. Reportedly, it has been cut by Lodewyk van Bercken for Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy.The Diamond Invention. Chapter 11 by Edward Jay Epstein Charles is said to have been wearing it when he fell in the Battle of Morat on June 22, 1476. A peasant or foot soldier found it on the Duke's person and sold it for a 2 francs, thinking it was glass. The new owner Bartholomew May, a citizen of Bern, sold it to the Genoese, who sold it in turn to Ludovico Sforza. By way of the Fuggers it came into the Medici treasury at Florence. Pope Julius II is also named as one of its owners. Another version of the stone's early history is that the rough stone was acquired in the late 16th century from the King of Vijayanagar in southern India by the Portuguese Governor of Goa, Ludovico Castro, Count of Montesanto. The crystal was deposited with the Jesuits in Rome until, after lengthy negotiations, Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany succeeded in buying it from the Castro-Noronha family for 35,000 Portuguese scudi crocati. Duke Ferdinand's son, Cosimo II, finally entrusted his father's purchase to a cutter, Pompeo Studentoli, a Venetian working in Florence. The finished gem was delivered on October 10, 1615. An inventory drawn up on Cosimo's death confirms the acquisition of the rough diamond by Ferdinand and describes the gem as 'faceted on both sides and encircled by a diamond encrusted band'. It is also known as Dufner Diamond. Documented history Documented history begins when Jean Baptiste Tavernier, the French jeweller and traveller, saw the stone among the possessions of Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1657. It then passed into the hands of the Habsburgs when the last of the Medicis died through the marriage of Francis III Stephan of Lorraine to Empress Maria Theresa of Austria and was placed in the Habsburg Crown Jewels in the Hofburg in Vienna. At the time, it was valued at $750,000. After the fall of the Austrian Empire during World War I, the stone was taken by Charles I of Austria into exile in Switzerland. The stone was stolen some time after 1918 by a person close to the Imperial family and taken to South America with other gems of the Crown Jewels. After this, it was rumoured that the diamond was brought into the United States in the 1920s and was recut and sold.

It has an apparent visual magnitude of 6.07, which indicates it is near the lower limit on brightness that is visible to the naked eye. According to the Bortle scale, the star can be viewed from dark suburban skies. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 19.03 mas as seen from Earth, this star is located about 171 light years from the Sun. Houk (1978) listed a stellar classification of F2/3 V for Nu Caeli, which would indicate this is an F-type main-sequence star. In contrast, Malaroda (1975) assigned in to class F1 III-IV, which would suggest it is a more evolved F-type subgiant/giant transitional hydrid. It is an estimated 880 million years old with 1.34 times the mass of the Sun. The star is radiating eight times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,870 K.

In the US, a particular form is evidence laundering, where one police officer obtains evidence via means that are in violation of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, and then passes it on to another officer, who builds on it and gets it accepted by the court under the good-faith exception as applied to the second officer. This practice gained support after the Supreme Court's 2009 Herring v. United States decision. By the United States Drug Enforcement Administration In August 2013, a report by Reuters revealed that the Special Operations Division (SOD) of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration advises DEA agents to practice parallel construction when creating criminal cases against Americans that are based on NSA warrantless surveillance. The use of illegally obtained evidence is generally inadmissible under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine. Two senior DEA officials explained that the reason parallel construction is used is to protect sources (such as undercover agents or informants) or methods in an investigation. One DEA official had told Reuters: \\"Parallel construction is a law enforcement technique we use every day. It's decades old, a bedrock concept.\\" An example from one official about how parallel construction tips work is being told by Special Operations Division that: \\"Be at a certain truck stop at a certain time and look for a certain vehicle.\\" DEA would alert state troopers and they may wait for that certain vehicle and decide to use drug searching dogs to see if there is any illegal drug-related activity. Parallel construction allows the prosecution building the drug case to hide the source of where the information came from to protect confidential informants or undercover agents who may be involved with the illegal drug operation from endangering their lives. A number of former federal agents had used parallel construction during their careers, according to Reuters interviews. Most of the former agents had defended the practice of parallel construction because no falsified evidence or illegally obtained material were presented in courts. A judge can rule evidentiary material inadmissible if it is suspected that the evidence was obtained illegally. Parallel construction in this case in the US usually is the result of tips from the DEA's Special Operations Division that are derived from sources within foreign governments, intelligence agencies or court-authorized domestic phone recordings. According to a senior law enforcement official and a former US military intelligence official tips are not given to the DEA until citizenship is verified to avoid any illegal wiretapping of US citizens who are abroad. US authorities require a warrant to wiretap domestic US-persons (citizens and non-citizens alike) and to wiretap US citizens who are abroad. The Reuters piece occurred amid reporting of the 2013 NSA leaks, although it made no \\"explicit connection\\" to the Snowden leaks. In the United Kingdom The Register argues the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 introduces parallel construction for evidence obtained through surveillance under the act, and prevents it being revealed or questioned in court.

It came 73 years after the original The Wolf of Wall Street directed by Rowland V. Lee and premi√®ring in 1929. Plot On the advice of a bartender familiar with the Wall Street crowd, Jeff Allen (William Gregory Lee) applies to the Wolfe Brothers brokerage firm in New York City for his dream job as a stock broker. What he does not know is that the brokers are werewolves, and he is bitten, thus he \\"joins the pack\\". He is forced to abandon his love and values for cunning and instinct during which time he cheats on his girlfriend, Annabella, and brutally kills and eats various humans. After a change of heart, he finds that leaving the brotherhood is harder than joining. Jeff goes to Annabella's friend's birthday party, and a drunk tries hitting on Annabella. Jeff rips a piece out of the neck of the drunk and then chases his girlfriend back to her apartment and bites her, transforming her into a werewolf too. Annabella had given him a silver pen when he first started as an intern at the Wolfe Brothers firm, and he goes back to the headquarters and he tries to quit, but his mentor, Dyson Keller, refuses to let him go. Jeff leaves anyway, but the werewolves led by Vince, go to Annabelle's apartment and seize her. They force him to return to headquarters, and he stabs the person he thought was the alpha but he was wrong, and a fight ensues during which him and his girlfriend kill all of the werewolves, and then they start walking away. The alpha who they thought they had killed, opens his eyes a split second before the end of the film, showing that they were not successful.

It is located in the vicinity of the urban-type settlement of Makaryevo in Lyskovsky District of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. History =Legendary foundation= The Makaryev (Makaryevsky) Convent was founded as a men's monastery. According to the legend, it was founded by the missionary Saint Macarius (Makary) in the early 15th century (1435, or, according to the Nizhny Novgorod Eparchy site, in 1415) by the waters of Zhyoltoye Ozero (Yellow Lake), from where comes the appellation \\"Zheltovodsky\\". In 1439, the monastery was burned by Tatar Khan Ulu Mukhammed. Macarius was taken prisoner, but released by the Khan on the condition that he not rebuild the monastery. Macarius then went into the Kostroma forests, where he founded a new monastery on the Unzha River, now known as Unzhensky Makaryev monastery. =The monastery and the fair= In 1620, the monk Avramy (Abraham) from Murom came to this place to rebuild the monastery, and soon he was surrounded by other monks. In 1624, the first wooden Cathedral of the Holy Trinity was consecrated. Most of the existing major monastery buildings were constructed of stone between 1651 and 1667. The entire complex is surrounded by a fortress-like stone wall with towers, forming a square with each side being about 200 meters long. The notable buildings of the period include the (rebuilt) Cathedral of Holy Trinity (1658), the Church of the Dormition of Our Lady (the Uspensky Church) with the large attached refectory (trapeznaya) (1651), the bell tower (1651), the Church of St. Michael the Archangel above the southern gate, and the monastic cells. The refectory is a large (420 m¬≤), two-storied building. The Church to St. Macarius was built in classical style in 1808. Eventually, the monastery had seven churches and one cathedral where the remains of St. Macarius were venerated. A well in the monastery was said to have been dug by St. Macarius himself. Despite the fortifications, the monastery was captured by Stenka Razin's rebel forces in 1670. The famous Makaryev Fair took place every summer for more than two centuries outside of the walls of the monastery. This was one of the most famous and important merchant fairs in Eastern Europe. Many merchants from Europe and Asia arrived in July to exchange goods. From the 1620s the fair was an important event in the Russian economy. By 1800, there were over three thousand government and private buildings to house the millions of rubles worth of trade goods. In 1816, a huge fire burned most of the buildings and millions of rubles were lost. The fair was then (in 1817) moved to Nizhny Novgorod, where it became even more famous. =After the fire= After the fair had been moved to Nizhny Novgorod, the monastery lost its main source of income and monks started leaving. Besides, in the early 19th century the Volga had shifted its course, absorbing the Yellow Lake. The monastery buildings were now threatened by the waters of the great river, with its annual spring floods. First, parts of the monastery walls fell due to erosion of the shore; in 1859, the main dome of the cathedral was shattered. Concerned with the monks' security, the Nizhny Novgorod Eparchy (Orthodox Diocese) and the local authorities decided to abolish the monastery. In 1869, the monastic community was dissolved; a sole hieromonk remained as a caretaker of the deserted compound. The diocese transferred the icons, bells, and other valuables to other churches. Only the Holy Icon of St. Macarius stayed in the monastery, due to the pleadings of the residents of the adjacent town of Makaryev (currently, the urban-type settlement of Makaryevo). A few years later, the Volga shifted its course again, and now was almost a kilometer away from the monastery buildings, not endangering them anymore. In 1882, the old monastery was resurrected, now as a women's convent. In 1910, the main dome of the Trinity Cathedral was rebuilt and decorated with new paintings. By 1917, around three hundred nuns lived in the convent. After the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks nationalized monastic properties. In 1927, the nuns were expelled from the convent. In 1928-1929, the buildings were used for an orphanage, and later rented out to various institutions. The premises were used by a military hospital during World War II, and in 1943 they were transferred to the Lyskovo College of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine (). Modern condition The Saint's homecoming: more than five centuries after Venerable Macarius' flight from the ruins of his monastery, his head gets red-carpet treatment in the towns it visits on its way back to Makaryevo In January 1992, Zheltovodsky Makaryev Convent of Holy Trinity was restored to the Nizhny Novgorod Orthodox Diocese. As of 2006, twenty-two nuns live there. The hegumenia (abbess) of the convent is Sister Mikhaila (Orlova). On the occasion of the Feast of the Venerable Macarius in August 2007, the Saint's head was transferred to Makaryev Monastery from Nizhny Novgorod's Pechersky Ascension Monastery, where it had been previously kept.

The main structure of the hotel is a 19th-century Gothic gingerbread mansion set in a lush tropical garden. The mansion was built as a residence for the powerful Sam family, including two former presidents of Haiti. The hotel was the real- life inspiration for the fictional Hotel Trianon in Graham Greene's 1966 novel The Comedians. Since 1990, the hotel has been the regular performance venue of the mizik rasin band, RAM, famous for their protest music during the Raoul C√©dras military dictatorship from 1991 to 1994. The hotel was one of Port-au- Prince's only hotels left standing after the 2010 Haitian earthquake and the worldwide media subsequently decamped to the hotel and its grounds during the disaster. History The hotel was constructed in the late 19th century as a private home for the Sam family. The head of a prestigious and influential family in Port-au-Prince, Tir√©sias Simon Sam was president of Haiti from 1896 to 1902. The mansion was built by Tir√©sias's son, Demosthenes Simon Sam. The Sams lived in the mansion until 1915, when their cousin Vilbrun Guillaume Sam was selected from among a group of powerful politicians to assume the post of president, the fifth president in five years. Guillaume would be president for a scant five months. Sam had acted harshly against his political opponents, particularly the better educated and wealthier mulatto population. The epitome of his repressive measures came on July 27, 1915, when he ordered the execution of 167 political prisoners, including former president Oreste Zamor, who was being held in a Port-au-Prince jail. This infuriated the population, which rose up against Sam's government as soon as news of the executions reached them. Sam fled to the French embassy, where he received asylum before being torn to pieces by an angry mob.Roman, Monica (2001). \\"Graham Greene Would Still Adore This Hotel\\". Business Week. May 7, 2001. United States President Woodrow Wilson, concerned that the Haitian government might be seized by Rosalvo Bobo, who was thought to be sympathetic to the Germans, ordered the United States Marine Corps to seize Port-au-Prince. The occupation would eventually extend to the entire nation of Haiti. The Sam mansion was used as a US military hospital for the duration of the occupation.Secom (2002). \\"Links\\" . Retrieved May 1, 2006. In 1935, when the occupation ended, the mansion was leased to Werner Gustav Oloffson, a Swedish sea captain from Germany, who converted the property into a hotel with his wife Margot and two sons Olaf and Egon. In the 1950s, Roger Coster, a French photographer, assumed the lease on the hotel and ran it with his Haitian wife, Laura. The hotel came to be known as the \\"Greenwich Village of the Tropics\\", attracting actors, writers, and artists. Some of the suites in the hotel were named after the artists and writers who frequented the hotel, including Graham Greene, James Jones, Charles Addams, and Sir John Gielgud.Vergane Glorie Erelijst (2003) \\"Hotels\\". Retrieved May 1, 2006. Poolside A New York native, Al Seitz, acquired the hotel lease in 1960. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the hotel enjoyed a brief period of fame and good fortune. Celebrities such as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Mick Jagger were regular guests, and like Coster before him, Seitz named favorite rooms at the hotel after the celebrity guests. After Al Seitz died in 1982, his widow, the former Suzanne Laury, continued to operate it. As the grip of Duvalierism closed over the country, however, the foreign tourist trade dried up. The hotel survived by serving as the desired residence for foreign reporters and foreign aid workers who needed secure lodging in the center of town. In 1987, with the help of his half- brother Jean Max Sam, Richard A. Morse signed a 15-year lease to manage the Hotel Oloffson, then in near ruins after the final years of Duvalierism. In restoring the hotel business, Morse hired a local folkloric dance troupe and slowly converted it into a band. Richard Morse would become the songwriter and lead male vocalist and the name of band, RAM, comes from his initials. Throughout the political upheaval of Haiti in the 1990s, RAM's regular Thursday evening performance at the hotel became one of the few regular social events in Port-au-Prince in which individuals of various political positions and allegiances could congregate. Regular attendees of the performances included foreign guests at the hotel, members of the military, paramilitary attach√©s and former Tonton Macoutes, members of the press, diplomats, foreign aid workers, artists, and businessmen. Attendees included both black Haitians and members of the nation's less populous racial groups. During the January 12, 2010, earthquake, the Hotel Oloffson was damaged. US photographer Tequila Minsky who was also staying in the Oloffson, told the New York Times that a wall at the front of the Hotel Oloffson had fallen, killing a passer-by, and that several neighboring buildings had collapsed. Richard Morse, using the social networking site Twitter, was a major source of news coming out of the disaster area in the early hours. In a Twitter post from January 12, he states \\"Our guests are sitting out in the driveway.. no serious damage here at the Oloffson but many large buildings nearby have collapsed.\\" The hotel is open, continues to operate, and RAM continues to play their regular Thursday night show. left center Popular culture *The Hotel Oloffson was the inspiration for the fictional Hotel Trianon in Graham Greene's 1966 novel about Duvalierist Haiti, The Comedians.Greene, Graham (1966).

The following season, Ryan played 32 league games as Millwall made the First Division play-offs, losing to Birmingham City. At the end of his contract, Millwall offered him another one-year deal, which he declined in favour of a three-year deal with Bristol Rovers, despite dropping down two divisions. He had played 226 league games for Millwall. His last appearance in a Millwall shirt happened to be the 2004 FA Cup Final against Manchester United where he was marking Cristiano Ronaldo. Computer game Championship Manager played its part in Ryan's transfer. Utilising real-life statistical data, the game revealed to Ryan Molesworth, the son of Bristol Rovers scout Paul Molesworth, that Robbie Ryan's contract was expiring. Rovers then became interested in signing the player, which after negotiations, actually took place. In the 2004‚Äì05 season, Ryan made 40 league appearances for Bristol Rovers.

Bromodomains, as the \\"readers\\" of lysine acetylation, are responsible in transducing the signal carried by acetylated lysine residues and translating it into various normal or abnormal phenotypes. Their affinity is higher for regions where multiple acetylation sites exist in proximity. This recognition is often a prerequisite for protein-histone association and chromatin remodeling. The domain itself adopts an all-Œ± protein fold, a bundle of four alpha helices each separated by loop regions of variable lengths that form a hydrophobic pocket that recognizes the acetyl lysine.  Discovery  The bromodomain was identified as a novel structural motif by John W. Tamkun and colleagues studying the drosophila gene Brahma/brm, and showed sequence similarity to genes involved in transcriptional activation. The name \\"bromodomain\\" is derived from the relationship of this domain with Brahma and is unrelated to the chemical element bromine.  Bromodomain-containing proteins  Bromodomain-containing proteins can have a wide variety of functions, ranging from histone acetyltransferase activity and chromatin remodeling to transcriptional mediation and co-activation. Of the 43 known in 2015, 11 had two bromodomains, and one protein had 6 bromodomains. Preparation, biochemical analysis, and structure determination of the bromodomain containing proteins have been described in details. =Bromo- and Extra-Terminal domain (BET) family= A well-known example of a bromodomain family is the BET (Bromodomain and extraterminal domain) family. Members of this family include BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT. =Other= However proteins such as ASH1L also contain a bromodomain. Dysfunction of BRD proteins has been linked to diseases such as human squamous cell carcinoma and other forms of cancer. Histone acetyltransferases, including EP300 and PCAF, have bromodomains in addition to acetyl-transferase domains. Not considered part of the BET family (yet containing a bromodomain) are BRD7, and BRD9.  Role in human disease  The role of bromodomains in translating a deregulated cell acetylome into disease phenotypes was recently unveiled by the development of small molecule bromodomain inhibitors. This breakthrough discovery highlighted bromodomain-containing proteins as key players in cancer biology, as well as inflammation and remyelination in multiple sclerosis. Members of the BET family have been implicated as targets in both human cancer and multiple sclerosis. BET inhibitors have shown therapeutic effects in multiple preclinical models of cancer and are currently in clinical trials in the United States. Their application in multiple sclerosis is still in the preclinical stage. Small molecule inhibitors of non-BET bromodomain proteins BRD7 and BRD9 have also been developed.

History The Creation Seventh Day Adventists broke away from the official Seventh-day Adventist church in 1988, because of doctrinal disagreements; specifically, as a response to the acquisition and enforcing of a trademark regarding the name \\"Seventh-day Adventist\\" on other believers outside of the denominational umbrella. In 2012 there was a United States congregation located in Guys, Tennessee, and a church house in the country of Uganda as a result of missionary efforts in Africa. =Litigation= WIPO ruling on disputed domain names On May 23, 2006, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Arbitration and Mediation Center received notice from the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists regarding several domain names operated by the Creation Seventh Day Adventist Church . The defendant claimed that such a confiscation of web domains would be a violation of religious freedom. In the decision rendered on July 21, 2006, WIPO concluded that although \\"Respondent alleges that he is involved in the free dissemination of the gospel of Jesus Christ and not in commercial activity [...]\\" and disclaimers were posted on the domains in question, \\"persons interested in finding religious information are Internet users and consumers within the meaning of the Policy.\\" They further concluded several of the church's domain names to be infringing on the trademark held by the General Conference, and based on these conclusions, WIPO ordered \\"that the Domain Names be transferred to Complainant.\\" U.S. federal trademark lawsuit The General Conference filed a lawsuit against the Creation Seventh Day Adventist Church in 2006, with Walter McGill as the defendant. McGill's defense cited the Free Exercise Clause, the fact that the church's name had never been used in commerce, and the lack of any actual confusion over the course of the church's fifteen-year history. He later added the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in support of his Free Exercise claim, citing that the use of the name \\"Creation Seventh Day Adventist\\" was mandated by his religion. The jury trial was initially rescheduled from January 2008 to June, but was further delayed. In the interim, on June 11, the Tennessee district court judge issued a partial summary judgment on behalf of the plaintiff that the name \\"Seventh-day Adventist\\" could not be used in the promotion of the church's materials or services at any locality in the United States, despite the Judge's conclusion that the Church sincerely believed that it took the name as a result of divine revelation with no intent to confuse or deceive the public. As of May 27, 2009, a recommendation for permanent injunction was adopted by the Court against McGill and the Church enjoining them from using the names \\"Seventh-day Adventist,\\" \\"Seventh-day,\\" \\"Adventist,\\" or the acronym \\"SDA\\" either alone or in conjunction with modifying terms, with an order to submit a sworn notice of compliance to the Court by June 17, 2009. No compliance report was filed. In August 2009, an appellant brief was filed by the Creation Seventh Day Adventist Church in the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. On November 21 attorneys representing the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists submitted a Proposed Order of Contempt and Sanctions to the Court, seeking among other things the arrest of Pastor McGill pending his compliance, the dispatch of U.S. Marshals to the CSDA Church property to destroy signs and materials containing the terms banned under the injunction, the cost of attorney's fees, the authority to conduct an inquisition into others aside from Pastor McGill involved in managing the Church's websites, and the removal of all such websites. On December 14, Magistrate Judge Bryant issued a report and recommendation to the Court adopting much of the Conference's wording, but advising against the use of U.S. Marshals for the destruction of the Church's signs and materials in favor of having it done by the Plaintiffs themselves or their agents. Judge Breen adopted the recommended order in full on January 6, 2010, further authorizing the confiscation of several websites and domains registered either by the Church or suspected associates, including several not in violation of the injunction. On February 16, the order was enforced by a sign crew and a constable at the Guys property,The Daily Corinthian, front page, February 17, 2010 . Dailycorinthian.com.

Retrieved December 2, 2011. which the General Conference responded to with a motion for a contempt hearing, scheduled to be held on May 25. Lucan Chartier, the assistant pastor of the Guys congregation, testified to his involvement in the repainting of the signs and maintenance of Church websites, further answering when questioned that he would continue to do so because he \\"has no option but to continue doing what my religion dictates.\\" On June 26, the Judge filed his report and recommendation to find both Mr. Chartier and Pastor McGill in contempt of court for disobeying the Court order in repainting the Church signs, maintaining websites, and editing the Wikipedia entry describing the movement. On August 10, the Court of Appeals handed down their judgment affirming the ruling of the District Court, concluding that while the ruling substantially burdens Pastor McGill's religious convictions, religious liberty laws were inapplicable in property disputes, with trademark law under that category as intellectual property. They further defined the RFRA as applying only to cases in which the Federal Government is a direct party, not cases in which a private party seeks to enforce Federal laws against another. In so ruling, the Court sided against a prior Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling concluding the opposite, siding instead with the previous dissenting opinion of then-Judge Sonia Sotomayor. On November 8, a petition for certiorari was filed with the Supreme Court of the United States, focusing on a portion of the Sixth Circuit's decision rejecting the defendant's claim that the RFRA's protection against religious beliefs being burdened applies to this case. The petition referenced disagreements between various Courts of Appeal on this matter, pointing out that while the Fifth and Seventh Circuits are in agreement with the Sixth Circuit in this regard, others, such as the Eighth and DC Circuits have in fact applied the RFRA to similar cases involving only private parties. The Rutherford Institute filed an amicus curiae brief with the Supreme Court on February 11, 2011, arguing that the case should be heard and the RFRA's protections defined as applicable to civil suits such as employment discrimination claims, intellectual property disputes, and bankruptcy proceedings. On April 18, the Supreme Court denied the petition. A second Report and Recommendation was filed on December 16 advising that McGill and Chartier both be placed into custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and required to serve thirty-day sentences in addition to a $500.00 fine. Overruling objections by both Chartier and McGill, Judge Bryant adopted the R&R; and modified it in part on April 5, authorizing warrants for the arrest of both McGill and Chartier by the U.S. Marshals Service. =Arrests and incarceration= Pastor McGill was arrested in Loma Linda, California on July 13, 2012, two days before he intended to turn himself in at the location,Olson, David.

Doctrinal positions Guys, TN, 2006 The group holds to certain mainstream Adventist beliefs, such as the observance of the seventh day Sabbath, avoiding unclean meats, death as a sleep, the investigative judgment, and an imminent Second Coming of Christ. Alongside these are several more notable doctrines, such as the following. While differing from modern Seventh-day Adventists on the matters listed below, their doctrines regarding religious accountability, rejecting the Trinity, separation of Church and State, and victory over all known sins were practiced and observed by early prominent Adventist leaders. =Victory over sin= The CSDA Church teaches an experience of complete victory over known sins for the born again believer. The CSDA Church teaches that when an individual is born again, the Spirit of Christ comes to dwell in them in place of the nature of the ‚Äúold man,‚Äù which they consider to be dead. The result of this union is taught to be a complete conformity to the will of God as revealed in a life lived free from all known sins. CSDAs believe in free will and are quick to differentiate between their beliefs and the doctrine of once saved always saved in that, while the OSAS doctrine teaches that a man is saved regardless of his actions, the victory over sin doctrine teaches an actual ceasing from the wrong actions themselves as a result of being saved from sin. In some ways the victory over sin doctrine is similar to that taught by reformer John Wesley regarding the new birth, however it differs in that, while Wesley believed that a person could not commit sin while in vacillating state known as ‚Äúbeing born of God,‚Äù the CSDA Church teaches that this is a one-time event with a subsequently permanent state, the result being that a born again Christian by definition will not commit known sin at any time. The CSDA Church believes this was presented to the Seventh-day Adventist denomination in 1888 under the name \\"Righteousness by Faith,\\" by elders A. T. Jones and E. J. Waggoner, but rejected by the leading men of the General Conference despite strong endorsement from Ellen G. White. =Rejection of the Trinity doctrine= While not a test of fellowship, the CSDA Church generally considers the doctrine of the Trinity as an error. They believe that the Father and Son are two distinct and separate beings which each may be referred to by the Hebrew term El, translated as God in the Old Testament, or collectively by the plural Elohim, also translated as God. They reject the idea of the Holy Spirit as a person in the same sense as the Father and Son, believing it to be the shared essence, power, characteristics, presence, and personality of those two. They believe that it is by sharing the same Spirit that the Father and Son are referred to as \\"one\\", and that it is in this same way that Christ and the believer are \\"one\\". They also see this shared Holy Spirit as being the means of unity between believers, citing several passages from John 17. While they believe that the Son fulfills a submissive and thus lesser role in relation to the Father, they do not accept the idea that the Son is an inherently inferior being to the Father or that he was created by the Father. They have argued that the original edition of Ellen White's book The Desire of Ages did not support the Trinity. The CSDA view was held by the great majority of the early Seventh-day Adventist leadership,‚Äô‚ÄôMinistry Magazine, October 1993‚Äô‚Äô, George Knight‚Äô‚ÄôAdventist Review, Jan 6, 1994‚Äô‚Äô, William G. Johnsson but was however abandoned in favor of the Trinity doctrine by the Seventh-day Adventist denomination in the mid-20th century. =Trademark dispute= The CSDA Church believes in a complete separation of Church and State (i.e., a rejection of the idea that governmental agencies possess the authority to intrude upon freedom of religion), and religious accountability for a church's actions. They differ from the Seventh-day Adventist denomination in their interpretation of this concept; the foremost example is that while the General Conference leadership sees trademark registration and enforcement as a necessary action to protect the Church's identity the CSDA Church views this as a union of church and state to regulate religious observances, which they consider forbidden by the Scriptures. Their understanding of the accountability of members for the actions of their church leadership taken from passages such as Revelation 18:4, caused their separation from the mainstream Adventist body, particularly after the incarceration of Pastor John Marik over his use of the name \\"Seventh-day Adventist\\".‚Äô‚ÄôTiny Church in Hawaii Battles Adventists Over Trademark Use‚Äô‚Äô, Russel Chandler, L.A. Times November 27, 1988 The CSDA Church teaches that when a Church joins to the state to regulate religious observances, they ‚Äúfall‚Äù in the sense that they are no longer God's chosen body, and the faithful people must come out of that organization. This view was also taught by early Adventists. The CSDA Church believes that the trademark on the name Seventh-day Adventist fulfills the prophecy of the mark of the beast, in that it both regulates religious observances and requires believers to submit to a law that they believe to violate their conscience. =The name Seventh-day Adventist= The CSDA Church believes that the name Seventh-day Adventist was given by God to describe the faith of Seventh-day Adventism, and that as a result, those who accept the beliefs of Adventism must use the name in identifying themselves and their organizations. They consider this to be a matter of conscience equivalent to denying or affirming the name ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù based on several quotes from Ellen G. White regarding the adoption and use of the name being Divinely commissioned. =Church membership= The CSDA Church holds strict views on church membership, claiming that once one has come into unity with Christ, unity with his church (which they hold themselves to be) will be the natural result, with one not being valid while rejecting the other. =Holy days and sacred names= The CSDA church observes New Moons monthly during the conjunction phase of the lunar cycle. Also referred to in their writings as the ‚ÄúNew Moon Festival of Humility,‚Äù it is the day on which they partake of the communion meal, foot washing, and a meal called the agape feast in which they eat fresh fruits and nuts in anticipation of the marriage supper of the lamb after the return of Christ. They observe New Moons in a similar fashion to weekly Sabbaths in that they cease from secular work and trade. The CSDA Church holds their biannual camp meetings during the Spring and Fall feasts of Unleavened Bread and Tabernacles, respectively. This fashion of observing some of the Annual Feasts found in the Old Testament and use of the names ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î (Yahweh) and ◊ô◊î◊ï◊©◊¢ (Yahshua) for the Father and Son of the Godhead in worship are generally practiced by members, although these are not dogmatically taught.

In the sixteenth century, the caballer√≠a or cavalry, was the typical military branch for nobles to follow, but the aforementioned skills had become less common as the Spanish aristocracy converted into a class of courtiers. These noble institutions created a dedicated cavalry corps that was directly funded by its members. The participating nobles, or maestrantes, organized themselves under the advocacy of a holy patron and took the internal form of a confraternity. Traditional maestranzas Philip II of Spain issued a Royal Decree on September 6, in which he encouraged the distinct local nobilities to organize themselves into noble brotherhoods. On August 3, 1573, the nobility of Ronda created the Hermandad del Santo Esp√≠ritu under the advocacy of Nuestra Se√±ora de Gracia ('Our Lady of Grace'), which would later become the Real Maestranza de Caballer√≠a de Ronda. Seville created a fraternity in the name of its patron saint, Saint Hermengild, soon thereafter, though it dissolved rapidly. By 1670, a group of nobles took Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario ('Our Lady of the Rosary') as its patron saint and the following year drew up orders which would give rise to the Real Maestranza de Caballer√≠a de Sevilla from that time forward. Nuestra Se√±ora del Triunfo ('Our Lady of the Triumph') became the patroness of the Real Maestranza de Caballer√≠a de Granada, created in 1686 to imitate its Sevillian counterpart. Eleven years later, another of the modern-era maestranzas was formed: the Real Maestranza de Caballer√≠a de Valencia. Infante Luis Fernando de Orl√©ans wearing the uniform of the Real Maestranza de Caballer√≠a de Granada, ca. 1910 Other traditional maestranzas of cavalry include the Real Maestranza de Caballer√≠a de Zaragoza, created in 1819 from the old Cofrad√≠a de Caballeros Hijosdalgo de San Jorge, and the Maestranza de Caballer√≠a de Segovia (Castilla) established circa 1808, and reorganized between 1990 - 1992.  Disbanded maestranzas  Historians are certain of the existence of several maestranzas in different Spanish cities. Their decay and disappearance were due to a range of factors, including the prohibition of the use of small firearms, abandonment of old customs and accoutrements consistent with the jineta riding style and the decline of the equine trade in the south of Spain, etc. In 1728, a petition was sent to the Spanish King by the city of Carmona, which acknowledged the existence of a Maestranza de Carmona. It would be governed from 1732 onwards under the auspices of the Real Maestranza de Caballer√≠a de Sevilla. Also in 1728, Philip V of Spain responded affirmatively to a memorial presented by the horsemen Diego Chac√≥n y Rojas and his son Juan with the intention of reorganizing the Maestranza de Antequera. This maestranza was also governed by the rules of the Sevillian group. Three years later, a series of horsemen asked the Crown to form the Maestranza de Ja√©n, but the Council of the Kingdom's Cavalry declined the request. The same case occurred with the Maestranza de Utrera in 1732. Conversely, in 1739, the Council of Caballer√≠a ruled in favor of the creation of the Maestranza de Jerez de la Frontera. Finally, in 1758 a request was submitted for a Maestranza de Palma de Mallorca. The request was approved, and the henceforth guild has governed itself with its own bylaws.  Maestranzas in the Americas  Although it is little known, in 1713 King Philip V approved the Real Maestranza de Caballer√≠a de La Habana (Havana) with the intention of helping with the ever-challenging defense of Cuba from incessant corsair attacks. The move had a very limited effect and disappeared after fifty years at most. The Real Maestranza de Caballer√≠a de La Habana was refounded in Spain on November 9, 2011. In 1789, the festivities surrounding Charles V's initiation inspired a group of Mexican nobles to seek royal authorization to create a Real Maestranza de Caballer√≠a de M√©xico. Some of the nobles were members of existing maestranzas, and the whole group was undoubtedly inspired by the guild in Cuba. They proposed their idea to the King on 3 February 1790, along with the support of the powerful Viceroy, but the initiative was struck down by the Consejo de Indias due to fears that any kind of autonomous organization among the American nobility could possibly sow the seeds for an independence movement.

The response, said afterwards, is Deo gratias (\\"Thanks be to God\\"). It is also sung as a versicle at the end of all Offices. History and liturgical use Apparently the chant was unknown in Rome before about AD 1000, and may have originated in the Gallican liturgy. In modern chantbooks, the music given for the chant is exactly the same as for the Ite missa est, but it is not known how much that was true in the medieval period as well.Hoppin, Richard. Medieval Music. New York: Norton, 1977. Page 142. The text was frequently troped, especially by adding text between the two words, or using the melody as the cantus firmus for an organum. The use of this chant as a tenor was common in the St. Martial and Notre Dame schools of polyphony, including a dozen settings in the Magnus Liber Organi. During the liturgical reforms of Pope Pius XII (1938‚Äì1958) and Pope John XXIII (1958‚Äì1963) the use of the Benedicamus Domino was much restricted. By 1963, it was only recited or chanted when an exposition immediately follows the Mass (Eucharisticum Mysterium, 120). It is rarely heard in Anglo-Saxon countries, processions being rarities there. It is still however, used in the Divine Office. Lutherans continue to use it in the Divine Office and at the end of their Divine Service. Some orders of traditionalist Catholics continue to use the pre-1955 liturgical books without the permission of the Holy See, such as the Society of Saint Pius V (SSPV), the Institute of the Mother of Good Counsel (IMBC), and Bp. Donald J. Sanborn's Roman Catholic Institute (RCI), and thus use the Benedicamus Domino in the traditional manner.

The highway runs east to west (hence its name) for ‚Äìfrom Pennsy Drive in Landover Hills to MD 355 in Bethesda. MD 410 serves as a major east-west commuter route through the inner northern suburbs of Washington, D.C., connecting the commercial districts of Bethesda, Silver Spring, and Hyattsville. In addition, the highway serves the industrial area of Landover Hills and the residential suburbs of Chevy Chase, Takoma Park, Chillum, Riverdale, and East Riverdale. The road also connects many of the arterial highways and freeways that head out of Washington. Additionally, it provides a highway connection to transit and commercial hubs centered around Washington Metro subway stations in Bethesda, Takoma Park, Hyattsville, Silver Spring, and New Carrollton‚Äìthe latter two of which provide additional connections to MARC and Amtrak trains. MD 410 was originally built along a mostly new alignment between Bethesda and Silver Spring in the late 1920s. The Montgomery County portion has not changed much in the ensuing decades. In the mid-1930s, the highway was extended east to Hyattsville in Prince George's County. where it has been realigned and extended multiple times. These changes included: an extension along existing roads further into Hyattsville in the mid-1940s; a realignment within Hyattsville in the mid-1950s; an extension through Riverdale in the late 1960s; and the final extension to New Carrollton and Landover Hills in the early 1990s. Route description MD 410 is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) except for three municipally maintained segments in the city of Takoma Park and a short stretch maintained by Prince George's County in East Riverdale. The segments maintained by the city of Takoma Park run from Chestnut Avenue to near Cedar Avenue for ; from Maple Avenue to MD 195 for ; and from the second junction with MD 195 to Elm Avenue, the longest non-state maintained portion with a length of . In Prince George's County, in East Riverdale, MD 410 is county maintained for , from the Baltimore-Washington Parkway to its turn from Riverdale Road onto Veterans Parkway. Here, in its final 2.6 miles, MD 410 becomes a part of the National Highway System, serving as a principal arterial for US 50\\\\. Past Route 50, MD 410 reaches its eastern terminus at Pennsy Drive. =Montgomery County= MD 410 begins at a pair of junctions with MD 355 (Wisconsin Avenue) and MD 187 (Old Georgetown Road) on either side of Bethesda station on the Washington Metro's Red Line in downtown Bethesda. Westbound MD 410 ends at the intersection of two-way MD 355 and the southern terminus of MD 187, which begins one-way northbound along Old Georgetown Road. Traffic from the southbound direction of MD 187 follows Woodmont Avenue and Montgomery Lane to the start of eastbound MD 410 at the intersection of MD 355 and Montgomery Avenue. MD 410 heads east as a one-way pair--East-West Highway westbound and Montgomery Avenue eastbound--to the eastern edge of downtown Bethesda, where the two directions converge east of Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School. From that intersection, traffic can use a U-turn lane from Montgomery Avenue to enter westbound East-West Highway back towards Maryland 355 or use a merge lane to enter MD 410 heading east. From there, the highway continues east as a four-lane, undivided East-West Highway. View east along MD 410 east of MD 384 near the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration headquarters in downtown Silver Spring MD 410 crosses over the Capital Crescent Trail. It then follows the northern edge of the town of Chevy Chase; crosses Coquellin Run; and runs along the southern edge of the Columbia Country Club to its intersection with MD 185 (Connecticut Avenue). MD 410 then leaves Chevy Chase and passes through an unincorporated area of Chevy Chase, within which the highway meets the northern end of MD 186 (Brookville Road). It descends into the valley of Rock Creek, where it intersects with Jones Mill Road and Beach Drive‚Äìthe main road through Rock Creek Park). MD 410 then crosses over Rock Creek, passes to the north of Meadowbrook Park, and leaves the valley as a four-lane divided highway with a narrow median and flanking service roads. MD 410 reaches the top of a hill at Grubb Road and descends into the valley of a branch of Rock Creek. The highway becomes undivided at Sundale Drive and crosses the branch stream just west of the northern corner of the District of Columbia and its attendant boundary marker. It then leaves the stream valley and ascends to an intersection with MD 390 (16th Street) at the western edge of downtown Silver Spring. alt=Ground-level view of a mid-sized street in an urban area, with one lane closed in the direction headed away from the viewer. In the far background are high-rise office and residential buildings, while the near background features a construction site with a large crane against an overcast sky on a winter day. MD 410 intersects MD 384 (Colesville Road) next to the headquarters of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and just south of the Metro's Silver Spring station, which serves the Washington Metro's Red Line and the MARC Brunswick Line. The highway parallels CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision and the Red Line southeast to a five-way intersection with US 29 (Georgia Avenue) and 13th Street. Here MD 410 crosses Georgia Avenue to Burlington Avenue. (No direct access exists from eastbound MD 410 to northbound Georgia Avenue (US 29) or from southbound Georgia Avenue US to eastbound MD 410.) MD 410 continues east on three-lane Burlington Avenue (two lanes westbound and one lane eastbound) and crosses over the rail and Metro lines. At Fenton Street, the highway veers southeast onto two-lane Philadelphia Avenue, where it enters the city of Takoma Park as it passes by the Takoma Park/Silver Spring campus of Montgomery College. MD 410 intersects MD 320 (Piney Branch Road) and then a four-way stop at Holly Avenue next to Takoma Park Elementary School. The highway continues through an intersection with Maple Avenue, next to the Takoma Park Library; then follows Philadelphia Avenue to its end at MD 195 (Carroll Avenue) at Takoma Junction; runs concurrently with MD 195 for one block; continues east along Ethan Allen Avenue, which it follows‚Äìthrough a three-way stop at Jackson Avenue‚Äìto the eastern city limit of Takoma Park and the Montgomery-Prince George's county line at MD 650 (New Hampshire Avenue). =Prince George's County= MD 410's name becomes East-West Highway again as it heads east from MD 650 as a four- lane undivided highway through the northern part of Chillum. The highway has frontage roads on either side of its crossing of Sligo Creek, then becomes divided ahead of its intersection with MD 212 (Riggs Road). As it heads southeast briefly on Ager Road, MD 410 briefly has six lanes. Ager Road eventually passes the West Hyattsville station on the Washington Metro's Green and Yellow lines. MD 410 has a partial intersection with Ager Road; the missing movements between MD 410 and Ager Road are made via 23rd Avenue to the east. MD 410 then branches into its own road again, where it becomes a four lane divided highway. It crosses the Northwest Branch Anacostia River and enters Hyattsville. The highway expands to six lanes as it passes between The Mall at Prince George's and Metro's Prince George's Plaza station. Beyond University Town Center and the headquarters of the National Center for Health Statistics, MD 410 approaches a four-way intersection with the northern end of MD 500 (Queens Chapel Road) and the southern end of Adelphi Road. The six-lane divided highway continues east, between Hyattsville to the south and University Park to the north. Eventually the south side of the highway is flanked by the town of Riverdale Park. As MD 410 crosses US 1 (Baltimore Avenue), it fully enters Riverdale Park, where it reduces to four lanes. It crosses over CSX's Capital Subdivision tracks, which also carry the MARC Camden Line. (The Camden Line can be boarded at the Riverdale station within the Riverdale Park Historic District to the south, which also contains the Riversdale Mansion.) A tributary of the Northeast Branch Anacostia River briefly runs within the median of the highway shortly before it crosses over the Northeast Branch. Then MD 410 intersects and crosses MD 201 (Kenilworth Avenue) leaving the town of Riverdale Park. The highway continues as Riverdale Road, a four-lane road with a center turn lane, through the unincorporated area of East Riverdale on its way to a diamond interchange with the Baltimore- Washington Parkway (unsigned MD 295). MD 410 then continues east on Riverdale Road and turns southeast onto Veterans Parkway, a four-lane divided highway (while Riverdale Road continues toward New Carrollton). The divided highway briefly enters the city of New Carrollton around its intersection with MD 450 (Annapolis Road). MD 410 continues south and intersects Ellin Road (unsigned MD 594F) before passing through a diamond interchange with US 50 (John Hanson Highway). The highway crosses over US 50; Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad tracks, also used by MARC's Penn Line; and Washington Metro's Orange Line. South of the railroad tracks, MD 410 quickly reaches its eastern terminus at Pennsy Drive. The nearby New Carrollton Metro station serves as the eastern terminus of the Orange Line subway and hosts MARC and Amtrak service and commuter and Intrastate bus service. Nearby Ardwick Ardmore Road provides access to the primary entrance to the Metro New Carrollton station. Secondary access to the station is provided by Ellin Road north of US 50. History The Bethesda-Silver Spring Highway was conceived in the late 1920s as a means of directly connecting the two Montgomery County inner suburbs on the north side of Washington. The highway was under construction between 1927 and 1929, and it was signed as MD 410 by 1930. When completed, MD 410 extended between what was then US 240 in Bethesda and 16th Street in Silver Spring, which had been extended north from the District of Columbia in 1928. Continuing to the present center of Silver Spring required heading south on 16th Street to Blair Portal, then east on Colesville Road, which had been extended to Blair Portal in 1927, to Georgia Avenue. Most of MD 410 was built on a new alignment with the exception of the part between present day MD 186 and Jones Mill Road, which followed the old Brookville Road. alt=Ground-level view of the intersection of two wide streets, with one street one-way headed toward the viewer. The streets intersect within an urban area featuring high-rise office buildings on a sunny day during the winter.By 1933, the new state highway was the busiest road in Montgomery County. The road, which became known as East- West Highway, was originally built with a width of 20 feet, but the heavy traffic led the Maryland State Roads Commission (SRC), the predecessor of MDSHA, to suggest in 1934 that the road be widened to 40 feet in the near future. The SRC also recommended extending East-West Highway through Silver Spring and Takoma Park to Hyattsville. By 1935, the highway was extended along a new alignment east from 16th Street to Takoma Park, then placed on Philadelphia Avenue and Ethan Allen Avenue within Takoma Park. The extension to MD 212 in Hyattsville was completed in 1936. After World War II, MD 410 was extended even further east and saw significant improvement on its extant sections. By 1946, MD 410 was extended over Hyattsville's Ager Road, Hamilton Street, 38th Avenue, and Jefferson Avenue‚Äìroads then designated MD 209‚Äìto a new eastern terminus at US 1 in Hyattsville. In addition, the pre-1946 course saw completion of efforts to widen the road to 40 feet. The highway between Connecticut Avenue (then MD 193) and Georgia Avenue (US 29) was widened in 1946 and 1947. In 1950, two segments were widened: Wisconsin Avenue (US 240) to Connecticut Avenue (MD 193), and MD 650 (New Hampshire Avenue) in Takoma Park to US 1 in Hyattsville. Beyond minor improvements, the configuration of MD 410 in Montgomery County has remained much same since 1950. The only major change was the highway being split onto a one-way pair of streets in Bethesda in 1988. The Prince George's County section has seen more substantial changes over the intervening decades. The first major change in alignment occurred in 1956, when MD 410 was completed on a new alignment as a four-lane divided highway between Ager Road (just east of MD 212) and MD 500. MD 410 was subsequently extended east over the former MD 403 (Colesville Road), which ran between MD 500 and US 1 in Riverdale. By 1970, this segment was upgraded to a multi-lane divided highway. Then, between 1967 and 1970, MD 410 was extended as a four-lane divided highway on a new alignment east from US 1, past MD 201, to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway interchange at Riverdale Road. This extension bypassed and replaced MD 412 between US 1 and the B-W Parkway. Finally, MD 410 was completed in 1991 when it extended east on Veterans Parkway past US 50 to its current terminus at Pennsy Drive. The sections of MD 410 in Takoma Park from Chestnut Avenue to Cedar Avenue and from Maple Avenue to Elm Avenue were transferred from municipal to state maintenance in an agreement dated February 16, 2013. The portion of MD 410 between MD 295 and Veterans Parkway in Prince George's County was transferred from county to state maintenance in an agreement dated May 11, 2017. Junction list Auxiliary route MD 410 has one former auxiliary route. MD 410A was the designation for the portion of Belcrest Road between MD 500 and MD 410 in Hyattsville. The route was assigned by 1999. MD 410A was transferred to county maintenance in 2004.

Due to the asymmetric design of the head for which it is named, the one-flue harpoon was less likely to cut its way out of the whale meat and blubber, and was therefore more successful in whaling. In the mid-19th century the one flue harpoon was replaced by the toggling harpoon, which was an iron version of the ancient design used in the Arctic by the native whale hunters there.

Created by Ken Finkleman and produced by One Hundred Percent Television, the series aired on CBC Television in 2006. The music is composed by Robert Carli. This is the only Ken Finkleman production in which he did not cast himself as a character. He does however make a very brief on- screen appearance as a member of the crew shooting a music video in the hotel. Background At The Hotel is a six-episode miniseries created, co-written, and produced by Ken Finkleman, which aired on CBC Television in 2006.http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/hotel.html Like Finkleman's The Newsroom, the miniseries was notable for its use of surreal plot devices and unique use of music. At first glance, the story appears to be a series of unconnected vignettes, woven against a mystery in the past which may be the reason behind a murder in the present day. Each episode opens with a short flashback to that critical night during a party back in 1961, during which a nameless chambermaid died. In the fifth episode, the audience discovers that everything they have just been told may lie solely in the imagination of a writer who is also a character in the miniseries. The end of the miniseries winds up the end of the novel, which pays for the writer's bar tab at the hotel; but the hotel hallways still have closed doors and the audience is left knowing nothing more about the hotel than when the miniseries began. Plot A writer arrives at the Chateau Rousseau, an illustrious Montreal hotel known for its favourable treatment of struggling artists. He has been hired by Lucy Knowlton, the alcoholic owner of the hotel, to research and write a book about its history. She will comp his room and board until the book is written. At the same time, Jenny arrives at the hotel and is hired as a chambermaid. While the writer researches the hotel's past, Jenny hears a gunshot at the hotel pool and arrives to find a body floating in the pool. She also finds herself face to face with the murder suspect, gun in hand; but she cannot identify him because she is near-sighted and can't see him clearly. The death may be related to events in the past. It may also be related to an attempt by Jacob Knowlton to have his sister Lucy murdered, leaving him with sole ownership of the hotel. He plans to demolish it, partly to support his son's election campaign, but knows that his sister would never allow it. The body is that of Lucy and Jacob's old friend Peter Miflin, whose daughter was killed when Jacob's son got drunk and drove the car into a river. News of her death was hushed up. In the meantime, guests come and go at the hotel, each with his or her own story like a cross-section of their lives. Some have affairs, one couple tries to sell a baby, there is even a case of spontaneous human combustion. A young girl whose mother dies at the hotel successfully covers up the death by hiring another guest as her \\"father.\\" The chambermaids and bellhops also have complex relationship problems, which are made worse for Adelaide and Jeremy by Jeremy's constant scheming to turn an additional illicit buck at the expense of the guests. Jenny's uneasiness over what she has witnessed also factors into many of the vignettes. In the fifth episode, it becomes apparent that many if not all of these stories are actually the novel the writer has written instead of the history he was supposed to write. The writer blames the closed doors of the hotel, which told him nothing, so he had to make things up. Lucy agrees to read the novel. If it is good enough, she will tear up his bar bill, which was not included under the terms of room and board. With that, the story plunges back into other guest vignettes, while continuing to follow Jenny and the other hotel staff. The novel does not end with the operatic death and funeral of another guest, because the writer thinks that would be too maudlin. A formerly famous opera singer was overcome with emotion and died when a famed tenor came to serenade her. All the staff and guests at the hotel break into operatic song at her funeral. Jenny has a knack for being in the right place at the right time. When one of the guests learns of his father's death over the telephone, she is present to console him. It turns out that the guest is now the King of Saudi Arabia, and she will become his queen. It turns out that Jacob's son is not Jacob's son at all. Instead, he was secretly adopted by Jacob after he was born to Lucy out of wedlock to an unknown father. When the young man finds out, he rejects Jacob and his scheming. Jacob is ruthless and reveals the secret of the accident in revenge against his son's betrayal. Jacob's son saves himself from the disclosure by discovering Christianity. Jacob is arrested for his friend's death in the pool, but turns out to be innocent of that death. He was, however, the person at the 1961 party who killed the chambermaid. The novel finally ends when Jacob is killed in the halls of the hotel he tried so hard to own. The story told by the miniseries ends when the writer receives an envelope with the torn-up bar bill inside. Lucy never tells him that she thinks the novel is rather bad. However, she has a soft spot for artists.

Born and raised in Berkeley, Herbert is a self-proclaimed hippie and fan of the Grateful Dead. Herbert got his start in the music business with the aid of his mentor Bill Graham. Through Graham, Herbert became a roadie for the multi-platinum-selling band Santana (where he met Neal Schon and Gregg Rolie). He managed Frumious Bandersnatch (where he met Ross Valory and George Tickner). When Santana imploded in 1973, Herbert put together the original lineup of Journey and remained its manager through 1993. Herbert was heavily involved in all business aspects of the band and traveled as their road manager. With a sharp business sense, Herbert brought everything in house under the name of Nightmare Productions and pioneered the use of large screen videos, impressive lighting and sound for arena-sized concerts. A shrewd businessman, Herbert made a fortune with Journey's real estate holdings, Nocturne video company, and catalog management. He and Jim Welch, his art director, devised a creative marketing plan to promote the band using the Grateful Dead's artists Stanley Mouse and Alton Kelly, thematic one-worded album titles, and exposure at point-of-purchase outlets. In 1993 Steve Perry asked that he resign from managing Journey due to personality conflicts. In addition to his work with Journey, Herbert brought Swedish rock groups Roxette and Europe to the United States in the mid to late-1980s, and managed Mr. Big and R&B; artist Tara Kemp and rock band Signal. In the late 1990s, Herbert moved from backstage into the spotlight, recording three albums as Sy Klopps and touring the San Francisco Bay Area with the Sy Klopps Band, which has included current and former Journey band members Neal Schon, Gregg Rolie, Prairie Prince, and Ross Valory.

Its mapped length of 2.481 miles (3.993 kilometers) places it at 361st on the United States Long Caves List. Lookout Mountain Cave was owned by Robert Cravens during the Civil War. He contracted with the Tennessee Military and Financial Board to deliver saltpeter to the Confederate government. On June 1, 1862 he rented the cave to the Confederate Nitre and Mining Bureau, who operated the cave until 1863 when Federal forces occupied Chattanooga. At one point the saltpeter mining operation was attacked by Federal forces: \\"Morale suffered after forces under General Ornsby Mitchell shelled the cave on June 7, 1863.\\" Clearly, the cave was still in Confederate hands on that date. (See Matthews, 2007) Although Lookout Mountain Caverns has not been open to tourists for quite some time, the management of Ruby Falls did allow researchers to take the elevator (the shaft excavated in 1928-1929) down to Lookout Mountain Caverns by prior arrangement. This access resulted in the discovery of new passages since Barr's description was published in 1961. It also resulted in the discovery of prehistoric bones dating back to the last Ice Age (Pleistocene). Many old names and dates in this cave are of great interest to historians. The map of the cave in Barr's book indicates the existence of \\"Andy Jackson's Signature.\\" Unfortunately, in 2005 the State of Tennessee's elevator inspectors required the Ruby Falls operators to seal the portion of the elevator shaft below Ruby Falls and the cave became totally inaccessible as of 2006. Barr's 1961 discussion of the cave says that the cave was intersected by a railway tunnel, and thus the cave accumulated soot that led to its closing to tourists. He says that \\"exploring of the cave is unpleasant because of the necessity of wading, crawling, climbing, and becoming covered with soot, which coats all the upward-facing surfaces.\\" He says the soot extends well over a mile into the cave.

Sackler Museum (established in 1985) and four research centers: the Archaeological Exploration of Sardis (founded in 1958), the Center for the Technical Study of Modern Art (founded in 2002), the Harvard Art Museums Archives, and the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies (founded in 1928). The three museums that constitute the Harvard Art Museums were initially integrated into a single institution under the name Harvard University Art Museums in 1983. The word \\"University\\" was dropped from the institutional name in 2008. The collections include approximately 250,000 objects in all media, ranging in date from antiquity to the present and originating in Europe, North America, North Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. Renovation and expansion In 2008, the Harvard Art Museums' historic building at 32 Quincy Street, Cambridge, was closed for a major renovation and expansion project. During the beginning phases of this project, the Arthur M. Sackler Museum at 485 Broadway, Cambridge, displayed selected works from the collections of the Fogg, Busch-Reisinger, and Sackler museums from September 13, 2008 through June 1, 2013. The renovated building at 32 Quincy Street unites the three museums in a single state-of-the-art facility designed by architect Renzo Piano, which increases gallery space by 40% and adds a glass, pyramidal roof. In a view of the front facade, the glass roof and other expansions are mostly concealed, largely preserving the original appearance of the building. The renovation was supervised by LeMessurier Consultants and Silman Associates. The renovation adds six levels of galleries, classrooms, lecture halls, and new study areas providing access to parts of the 250,000-piece collection of the museums. The new building was opened in November 2014. Directors *Charles Herbert Moore: 1896-1909 *Edward W.

According to Donald Preziosi, the museum was not initially established as a gallery for the display of original works of art, but was founded as an institution for the teaching and study of visual arts, and the original building contained classrooms equipped with magic lanterns, a library, an archive of slides and photographs of art works, and exhibition space for reproductions of works of art. In 1925, the building was replaced by a Georgian Revival-style structure on Quincy Street, designed by Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch, and Abbott. (The original Hunt Hall remained, underutilized until it was demolished in 1974 to make way for new freshman dormitories.) =Collection= The Fogg Museum is renowned for its holdings of Western paintings, sculpture, decorative arts, photographs, prints, and drawings from the Middle Ages to the present. Particular strengths include Italian Renaissance, British Pre-Raphaelite, and French art of the 19th century, as well as 19th- and 20th-century American paintings and drawings. The museum's Maurice Wertheim Collection is a notable group of impressionist and post- impressionist works that contains many famous masterpieces, including paintings and sculptures by Paul C√©zanne, Edgar Degas, √âdouard Manet, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and Vincent van Gogh. Central to the Fogg's holdings is the Grenville L. Winthrop Collection, with more than 4,000 works of art. Bequeathed to Harvard in 1943, the collection continues to play a pivotal role in shaping the legacy of the Harvard Art Museums, serving as a foundation for teaching, research, and professional training programs. It includes important 19th-century paintings, sculpture, and drawings by William Blake, Edward Burne-Jones, Jacques-Louis David, Honor√© Daumier, Winslow Homer, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Alfred Barye, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Auguste Rodin, John Singer Sargent, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and James Abbott McNeill Whistler.

William James spoke at its dedication. Its holdings include significant works of Austrian Secession art, German expressionism, 1920s abstraction, and material related to the Bauhaus design school. Other strengths include late medieval sculpture and 18th-century art. The museum also holds noteworthy postwar and contemporary art from German-speaking Europe, including works by Georg Baselitz, Anselm Kiefer, Gerhard Richter, and one of the world's most comprehensive collections of works by Joseph Beuys. The Busch‚ÄìReisinger Art Museum has oil paintings by artists Lovis Corinth, Max Liebermann, Gustav Klimt, Edvard Munch, Paula Modersohn-Becker, Max Ernst, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Franz Marc, Karl Schmidt-Rotluff, Emil Nolde, Erich Heckel, Heinrich Hoerle, Georg Baselitz, L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, and Max Beckmann. It has sculpture by Alfred Barye, Kathe Kollwitz, George Minne, and Ernst Barlach. From 1921 to 1991, the Busch‚ÄìReisinger was located in Adolphus Busch Hall at 29 Kirkland Street. The Hall continues to house the Busch‚ÄìReisinger's founding collection of medieval plaster casts and an exhibition on the history of the Busch‚ÄìReisinger Museum; it also hosts concerts on its Flentrop pipe organ. In 1991, the Busch‚ÄìReisinger moved to the new Werner Otto Hall, designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates, at 32 Quincy Street. In 2018, Busch‚ÄìReisinger featured \\"Inventur‚ÄìArt in Germany, 1943‚Äì55\\", which was named after a 1945 poem by G√ºnter Eich. =Curators= * Kuno Francke, 1903‚Äì1930 * Charles L.

The museum building, which was designed by British architect James Stirling, was named for the major donor, Arthur M. Sackler, a psychiatrist, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. The museum also housed offices for the History of Art and Architecture faculty, as well as the Digital Images and Slides Collection of the Fine Arts Library. , the old Sackler Museum building houses the History of Art and Architecture Department and the Media Slide Library. =Collection= The museum collection holds important collections of Asian art, most notably, archaic Chinese jades (the widest collection outside of China) and Japanese surimono, as well as outstanding Chinese bronzes, ceremonial weapons, Buddhist cave-temple sculptures, ceramics from China and Korea, Japanese works on paper, and lacquer boxes, and ancient Iranian metalwork. The ancient Mediterranean and Byzantine collections comprise significant works in all media from Greece, Rome, Egypt, and the Near East. Strengths include Greek vases, small bronzes, and coins from throughout the ancient Mediterranean world. The museum also holds works on paper from Islamic lands and India, including paintings, drawings, calligraphy, and manuscript illustrations, with particular strength in Rajput art, as well as important Islamic ceramics from the 8th through to the 19th century. =Architecture= The Sackler Museum, originally designed as an extension to the Fogg, elicited worldwide attention from the time of Harvard's commission of Stirling to design the building, following a selection process that evaluated more than 70 architects. As a measure of the excitement generated by the project, the University mounted an exhibition of the architects' preliminary design drawings in 1981, James Stirling's Design to Expand the Fogg Museum and issued a portfolio of Stirling's drawings to the press. After completion, the building's coverage was even greater, with general acknowledgment of the building's significance as a Stirling design and a Harvard undertaking. Aside from descriptions of the building's organization and exterior appearance, perhaps most noted was the way in which the inventive design accommodated its diverse program on a challenging site. Harvard published a 50-page book on the Sackler, with extensive color photos by Timothy Hursley, an interview with Stirling by Michael Dennis, a tribute to Arthur M. Sackler, and essays by Slive, Coolidge and Rosenfield. In spite of global critical acclaim, a few have been critical, Martin Peretz even proposing demolition, though his case was undermined by mis-attributing the building to another British architect, Norman Foster. , the future use of the building was unclear, as its collection has been relocated to the Renzo Piano extension to the Fogg. Stirling's structure still stands . Since 1984, the building has housed the University's department of the History of Art + Architecture, with building renovations being completed in early 2019 to better accommodate the faculty and students.

(Jelleke) Veenendaal at parlement.com She was one of the three candidates in the 2006 VVD leadership election, but obtained only 803 votes (3%). Life =Life before politics= After attending a public elementary school in Utrecht, Veenendaal attended MULO. She graduated in 1971 specializing in the sciences. She worked for a development cooperation NGO in Frankfurt between 1971 and 1974. She continued to study for medical analyst at MBO-level, graduating in 1976. She took several jobs as a medical analyst in 1978-1979. She then endeavoured in travel, and had management functions with several foreign travel organisations, in the period 1979-1983. In 1984 she returned to the Netherlands, working as a medical analyst in Amsterdam. In 1989 she became a manager for the HEMS, which coordinates the restaurants and bistros at Schiphol Airport. She took an evening course in business administration, resulting in a completed HEAO-study in 1990. After her studies she took a job at the Chamber of Commerce of Alkmaar, as head of public relations. In 1993 she became a professional advisor for small businesses in Zaandam. In 1997 she temporarily quit working because of an illness. In 2001 she became commercial director of Reek Weegtechniek in Purmerend. A job she gave up in 2003, to enter parliament. In this period she had already become active within the VVD, as secretary of the Purmerend branch, and as member of the board of the party's women organisation. She also took courses in liberalism and liberal politics, and in political communication from the Haya van Someren Foundation, which trains the VVD members on request. She also was member of the board of the NVVH, the Dutch Association of Home Makers. =Political life= In 2003 she entered the House of Representatives. She was not on an eligible position, but after the formation, many VVD MPs had become minister, leaving their parliamentary seats. In parliament she was member of the backbench, and spokesperson for housing policy. In 2005 she proposed a plan together with social-democratic MP, Staf Depla. She also pleaded for a more lenient policy towards permanent housing in vacation houses. Quite unexpectedly Veenendaal announced her ambition to become leader of the VVD, and would run in the 2006 VVD leadership election as -then only- candidate against Mark Rutte. She claimed that without another candidate the election would be a sham and that it was important that a woman ran. She did not discuss her ambition with the party board, but did consult her political friends. She was generally seen as a very unlikely candidate against the popular Rutte, who is backed by the party's board, and after Rita Verdonk entered the game, her chances have vanished entirely. In the debates set up around the election, Veenendaal shows herself more left and progressive than Verdonk and Rutte. She lost the elections to Rutte obtaining only 803 votes, 3% of the total. The same year she left politics.

Passing through Prokletije mountains and the village of Vermosh, it re-enters Montenegro under the name of Grnƒçar. Receiving the Vruje stream from Ali Pasha's Wellsprings from the right at Gusinje, it continues as Ljuƒça for a few more kilometers where it empties into the Lake Plav, creating small delta. It flows out of the lake to the north, next to the high mountain Visitor, under the name Lim for the remaining . It passes through Murino, continuing generally to the north through areas of Vasojeviƒái, Gornji Kola≈°in, Donji Kola≈°in and Komarani, the Tivran gorge and the cities of Andrijevica, Berane, Bijelo Polje, Resnik and Nedakusi, entering Serbia between villages of Dobrakovo and Gostun.

Lim continues between the mountains of Jadovnik, Pobijenik and Zlatar, and runs through the northern part of the Sand≈æak area (or Ra≈°ka oblast). Upstream of Priboj, the river is dammed by the hydro power plant \\"Potpeƒá\\", creating Potpeƒá Reservoir. The villages of Garƒçanica and Luƒçice and the towns of Brodarevo, Prijepolje, Pribojska Banja and Priboj. After Priboj it turns north-west and enters Bosnia and Herzegovina, but only for a few kilometers when it flows back to Serbia and then again to Bosnia at Rudo. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lim flows between the mountains of Biƒá, Javorje and Vuƒçevica from the south, and the Varda mountain from the north, before it empties into the Drina near the village of Meƒëeƒëa. The lowest section of the river is flooded by the Vi≈°egrad Reservoir, created by the Vi≈°egrad hydroelectrical power plant on the Drina.  Characteristics  Lim belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin through Drina, Sava and Danube. Its drainage basin covers and the river is not navigable. It receives many smaller streams in Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina, however, the two most important are its major right tributaries in Serbia, the Uvac and the Mile≈°eva river. Two hypotheses exist about the origin of its name: * Latin origin derived from the word limes, which means border * Celtic origin from the root llyn or llym, meaning drink or water  Polimlje  The fertile valley of the river is called Polimlje (–ü–æ–ª–∏–º—ô–µ), meaning \\"Lim valley\\". It represents area around composite river valley, made of several gorges and depressions. The valley is divided in three large parts, Montenegrin, Stari Vlah and Bosnian. It is important agricultural region, especially for cultivating fruits and stockbreeding. It is also important route for the both road and railways from Serbia to Montenegro and Adriatic coast, most notably, Belgrade-Bar railway. Industry is not much developed (smaller industrial centers are Berane, Bijelo Polje and Prijepolje), except for heavily industrialized Priboj. Most use of the river has Serbian electricity production, with power station Potpeƒá being constructed and several more stations on the Lim's major tributary, the Uvac. Despite the potentials, the entire area the Lim flows through is undeveloped and for decades highly depopulating.  Border dispute  After breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991-1992, on the part of Lim's course entering and re-entering Serbia and Bosnia, several villages of Serbia remained physically cut off from the rest of the republic's territory. The governments in Belgrade and Sarajevo proposed an exchange of territories but no agreement was reached.

It is known for the composition of tropes, sequences, and early organum. In this respect, it was an important precursor to the Notre Dame School.  History of the Abbey Saint Martial de Limoges  Plagi proti intonation. Sequentiary from Aquitaine, end 10th century (F-Pn lat. 1118, fol. 114r) Many of the modern musicological studies concerning a \\"Saint Martial School\\" focus on four manuscripts with remarkably innovative compositions for the 12th century.See Alejandro Enrique Planchart's and Sarah Fuller's article \\"St Martial\\" (New Grove Dictionary). It is often assumed that these fragments derived from different Southern French monasteries, despite the lack of cantor attributions in the rubrics. However, Sarah Fuller has suggested that this may not be the case, discussing the \\"myth of a Saint Martial school\\", where she suggests that the fragments are rather a collective activity of the Abbey's librarians than a didactic activity of the Abbey's cantors.Sarah Fuller (1979) These manuscripts (F-Pn lat. 1139, 3549, 3719, and GB-Lbl Add MS 36881) were, it would seem, more likely collected and bound together by the librarian Bernard Itier, than composed or compiled at St Martial itself.Already Marion Gushee (1964) emphasized the fragmentary nature of these sources. They employ a \\"libellum\\" structure, often bound together from individual quaternio gatherings of different ages (F-Pn lat. 1139), unlike other sources during this period where polyphonic pieces are most often found added, by a later hand, at the end of quaternios of older monophonic manuscripts. Despite the concordances between these manuscripts, the collection includes many variants. The repertory combines modern forms of poetry with modern forms of musical composition, consisting of settings of proses, tropes, sequences, liturgical dramas, and organa. Even a polyphonic setting of an epistle recitation survives as florid organum. Other modern musicological studies have attempted to identify unifying centre for these sources, such as Cluny rather than Limoges, and with reference to the Cluniac Monastic Association, Fleury and Paris (especially the Notre-Dame School), the Abbey of Saint Denis, and the Abbey Saint-Maur-des-Foss√©s. Questions about periphery and centre (Arlt 1975) may be answered by the research of political and church history relative to Cluny (Huglo 1982, Gillingham 2006). In contrast to Fuller's study, James Grier's recent examination of earlier monophonic Proser-Sequentiaries suggests that they were created in the scriptorium of the Abbey Saint-Martial 100 years earlier (than the fore- mentioned fragments including polyphonic compositions), explicitly for liturgical use at Limoges, by Roger and Ad√©mar de Chabannes.James Grier (1995). The concept of a local school of cantors who documented their innovations in newly designed liturgical books with the libellum structure‚Äîlater imitated elsewhere (even in the Parisian Magnus liber organi)‚Äîis therefore still credible; at least for the 11th century. = Roger and Ad√©mar de Chabannes and the troper-sequentiary = Ad√©mar de Chabannes was educated as a cantor and poet by his uncle Roger de Chabannes. The manuscripts written or revised by Roger de Chabannes together with his nephew, were created in the form of troper-prosers and sequentiaries with a new diastematic form of neume notation (F-Pn lat. 1240, 1120, 1121, 909),James Grier (2006). which became soon much more popular than the letter notation of William of Volpiano. They belonged to a new type of chant book which was no longer simply a liturgical book, but rather collected new poetry based on liturgical forms (in music as well as in poetry). This new form of chant book consisted of several books (\\"libelli\\") - the \\"proser\\" or \\"troper\\" for verses and tropes, the \\"sequentiary\\" for prosulae and sequences (troped elaborated alleluia refrains), the processional with processional antiphons, the offertorial for offertories etc. and the tonary.See Helmut Spanke (1930-1933) who studied the poetic innovations of the manuscripts of the Abbey of Saint Martial. This new structural form soon spread beyond Aquitaine becoming popular in France and Normandy, due in part to the Cluniac Monastic Order, which was expanding its influence and adopted the work of the school of cantors at the Abbey of Saint- Martial for liturgical use.Bryan Gillingham (2006), Susan Boynton (2006). Cluny Abbey was founded by William I and already in Ad√©mar's time its laic association had gained its power over more and more abbeys, their cantors and their scriptoriums. Ad√©mar's fruitless efforts to become an abbot at Saint Cybard of Angoul√™me was a personal disappointment, but his ambitions were quite symptomatic for monasteries under Cluniac influence. According to James Grier, Ad√©mar de Chabannes also contributed within two troper-sequentiaries (F-Pn lat. 1121, 909) which have the finest tonaries of the region. He regards this late activity as a craftship which he learnt from his uncle, while he was revising older manuscripts, often by adding modal signatures to earlier manuscripts. But the intonation formulas of the tonaries had as well an explicit creative function, which can be demonstrated by an earlier manuscript already written in diastematic neumes. Some composed sequences of this earlier troper-proser-sequentiary (F-Pn lat. 1118, fol. 114r) are nothing else than a simple repetition of a more and more elaborated intonation, but the verse units cut the melodic motive into different parts, often against its modal structure. These early permutation technique already anticipated later isorhythmic composition techniques. = Early polyphony and the Cluniac influence on liturgical reforms = The scriptorium of Limoges continued its activities after Ad√©mar's death in 1034, but it was no longer the only scriptorium of the Limousin diocese.Sister Anthony Marie Herzo (PhD thesis, 1966) has already made a comparison of 5 Aquitanian graduals and found two groups‚Äîthe one of St Martial of Limoges (F-Pn lat. 1132) and the Cathedral of Narbonne (F-Pn lat. 780) and the other between the Cathedral of Toulouse (British Library, Harley 4951), Saint Michel-de-Gaillac (F-Pn lat. 776), and Saint Yrieix (903). William Sherrill made the hypothesis, that the Gradual of St Yrieix with Gallican preces in its appendix (F-Pn lat. 903) has not been written at Limoges, but by the cantors of the Abbey itself which was possible since it promoted as canon chapter during the second half of the 11th century and depended directly of the Monastery of St Martin at Tours. He even went so far to assume that this gradual has copied from Beneventan graduals, because the included Cassinese chants for the patronal feast of St Benedict, and might have served to copy for the gradual of Gaillac, while the latter could have served to write the later gradual for Toulouse.William Manning Sherrill (2011, pp. 158-162). Concerning the tonaries Michel Huglo (NGrove) had so far regarded the tonaries of the cathedral rite around Toulouse as one group together with F-Pn lat. 1118, but according to James Grier the latter already influenced Ad√©mar's tonaries, because it has later additions from his hand concerning his new liturgy dedicated to Saint Martial. In this comparison the liturgy of the Saint-Martial Gradual (F-Pn lat. 1132) is rather dependent on Cluniac reforms and especially the one of Narbonne, written by the end of the 11th century for the use at the cathedral, resembles to many others written with the same notation in Spain after the conquest of Northern Andalusia, when Aquitanian aristocrats had been related with the Castilian family by marriage. Polyphony was neither invented at Limoges nor did it appear the first time in the notation of its scriptorium. An oral tradition of a polyphonic performance can be traced back to the time, when the Musica enchiriadis had been written,Giovanni Varelli (2013) found recently practical examples of this early organum practice which he dated back to the 10th century. and Ad√©mar was a contemporary of Guido of Arezzo, who described in his treatise Micrologus a similar practice as \\"diaphonia\\" (discant), which already allowed to sing more than one note against the cantus during cadences (\\"occursus\\"). Notated evidence of alternative practices, where the organal voice changes between different strategies of heterophony (parallel and counter movement) and holding notes which support the modal colour of the cantus, can be found as later added exemplification in monophonic manuscripts of the Abbeys in Saint- Maur-des-Foss√©s, Fleury, and Chartres.See Wulf Arlt's reconstruction in Rankin (‚Ä≥Stylistic layers in eleventh-century polyphony‚Ä≥, 1993, 102‚Äì141). A systematic discussion of the various treatises and of the examples given in chant manuscripts is offered by Sarah Fuller (1990). One example concerning the tradition of Fleury Abbey is an addition of an organal voice (similar to the organum notation of the Winchester Troper) in a hagiographic Lectionary (I-Rvat Cod. Reg. lat. 586, fol. 87v) for three Mass graduals ¬´Viderunt omnes¬ª (Christmas), ¬´Omnes de Saba¬ª (Epiphany), and ¬´Gloriosus deus¬ª (Fabianus and Sebastianus). The local style of the cantors were counter movement and holding notes with the syntactic structure underlined by occursus endings. The only exception was Winchester Cathedral, where a systematic collection of organa can be found in the troper part‚Äîthe so-called \\"Winchester Troper\\".See the reconstructions of the Winchester Troper organa by Susan Rankin, and those of the French organa by Wulf Arlt (Rankin 1993). The earliest polyphony developed in a rather secular context and Cluny played a prominent role in it. What was exactly the role of the Abbey of Saint Martial for a school of anonymous cantors associated with Aquitanian polyphony? The earliest evidence can be found in an older Troper-Proser with libellum structure (F-Pn lat. 1120). In some late additions cantors made exemplifications of a polyphonic performance of organum similar to those additions in the Gradual of the Abbey of Saint- Maur-des-Foss√©s (F-Pn lat. 12584, fol. 306). Under Cluniac influence the latter abbey developed an extravagant liturgy since 1006, when it was ruled by a new Abbot, who was sent from Cluny, where he had served as a cantor.Michel Huglo (1982) also discussed hagiographic sources which document, that this change caused several conflicts and that part of the monastic community left the Abbey. The polyphony can be easily recognized, because the notator used a method similar to a modern score. There had been other methods as well. Some later additions in the early Troper-Proser (F-Pn lat. 1120) on folio 73v and on 77v look monophonic on the first sight, but the melody is organized in pairs so that each verse of it has to be sung together with an organum voice. The organum voice simply sings the text of the first verse with the melody notated with the text of the second one, and the cantus does vice versa repeat the melody of the first verse, while the singers applies it to the text of the second verse. On folio 81r and 105r we have three early examples of later added florid organum. Its notation technique had already developed in the monophonic manuscripts notated in parts by Ad√©mar, in cases where the scribe of the text did not leave enough space for the neumes. The notator already used vertical strokes, which do indicate how the melismas have been coordinated with the syllables. On folio 105 recto, a ¬´Benedicamus domino¬ª was notated separately from the florid organum. Both techniques of polyphonic performance, the punctum contra punctum (discant) and florid organum as puncta contra punctum have been once discussed in a 15th-century treatise from Italy, which had been obviously associated with the treatise \\"Ad organum faciendum\\" of Aquitanian provenance.In a recent critical edition, Christian Meyer (2009) could prove that certain parts of it can be traced back to the 12th century and belong to an abbot and cantor Guy de Cherlieu of the Cistercian reform group. In fact, there is no evidence that \\"discantus\\" and \\"organum\\" have been distinguished this way already during the 11th century. Guido of Arezzo's term was \\"diaphonia\\", about 1100 the term \\"organum\\" became more common for all kind of polyphony without being specified whether it was florid or simple like in \\"diaphonia\\". Concerning Cecily Sweeney's hypothesis that the Cistercian reform prohibited polyphonic performance of liturgical chant, which could not convince Christian Meyer, we cannot exclude the possibility that Guy de Cherlieu's ideas failed to convince Bernard of Clairvaux and other reformers. Nevertheless, even in that case an implicit prohibition had no real effect on the liturgical tradition of Cistercians, because one of the earliest treatises dedicated to the practice of fauxbourdon and its ornaments has a Cistercian provenance and the Las Huelgas Codex rather prove that Cistercian customs were also here not so far from Cluniac ones. = The manuscripts of Aquitanian polyphony = In comparison with the few late traces of a polyphonic singing in the earlier manuscripts, the four main manuscripts and a lot of similar manuscripts of Aquitaine are so full of later developments, that their manifold forms, the calligraphy, the illuminations, and the poetry have not lost their attraction for philologists and musicians. A well-known example is ¬´Stirps iesse¬ª, which is nothing else than a florid organum over a ¬´Benedicamus domino¬ª cantus which was widespread within the Cluniac Monastic Association including the Magnus liber organi of the Notre-Dame school. As ¬´Benedicamus domino¬ª verses concluded almost every divine service, Cluniac cantors were supposed to know a great variety of them. Many of them had been new compositions and became favored subjects for new experiments in poetry and musical composition.The aforementioned folio of the Gradual-Antiphoner of the Abbey Saint-Maur-des-Foss√©s (F-Pn lat. 12584) is probably one of the earliest sources for this popular tune, which seemed just to be an intonation formula of plagis protus with a final melisma. Florid organum itself like any tropus can be regarded in two ways, as a useful exercise to memorize a certain cantus precisely note by note on the one hand or, as a very refined and embellished performance by a well-skilled soloist or precentor. ¬´Stirps iesse¬ª was actually a combination of both, as a Benedicamus performed ¬´cum organo¬ª it was rather a longer performance during an important liturgical feast, but the troped organal voice added a certain Marian poem to it, which fixed it within the week between Christmas and New Year. The manuscripts \\"Saint-Martial C\\" und \\"D\\" even were nothing more than additional quaternia within a homiletic collection of sermons. Most of the manuscripts with polyphonic compositions are not just from the Abbey of Saint-Martial at Limoges, but as well from other places of Aquitaine. It is unknown to what extent these manuscripts reflect the products of Saint Martial in particular, it rather seems that there were prosar collections from various places in Southern France. During the 12th century, only a very few composers of the school are known by name, and the new poetic experiments were not only in Latin, they obviously inspired as well courtly poetry of the Troubadours. Even if St-Martial poetry (versus, tropes and sequences) was almost entirely in Latin, some melodies collected in the manuscripts of the Abbey were also used to compose Old Occitan poetry. Before the collections of the chansonniers, there are already contemporary Old Occitan songs with musical notation for all stanzas which has been written at the scriptory of Saint-Martial Abbey like O Maria, Deu maire.F-Pn lat. 1139, fol. 49r. It shows that aristocratic circles present at the Abbey have been closely related to those of the troubadours.

From the 1870s through the 1920s the line served its namesake towns in Southwestern Pennsylvania (often referred to as the Wayynie). After the 1930s, the line did struggle on, but mostly on paper. Today, all that remains from the railroad's heyday is one locomotive, a few stations, and a few images. However, Greene County owes a lot to the Waynesburg and Washington Railroad because the rail system gave the county an opportunity to grow. By missing the western parts of the county, it continued to keep that portion hidden from progress. The east had already grown from the river, and the railroad supported the central section. Its beginnings were started because of the boom in oil and gas. Coal was already being mined on the eastern end of the county near the river. This railroad helped all the natural resource industries to grow and caused the increase in population in Waynesburg. History The Waynesburg and Washington Railroad ran between the county seats of Washington and Greene Counties. It was first conceived by John Day in 1874. The charter was signed in 1875 and work began in August of that year. It was to be a three-foot narrow gauge line, because of the current inclination toward the building of those types of lines and because they were cheaper to build. The line had fallen by the wayside around the time of the Great Depression. Passenger service was decided to be canceled on July 9, 1929. There were rail truck services to the towns along the line until 1976, when the ownership passed to Conrail. The line is now used up for a portion as a rail link to a local coal mine. The other portions of the line are now abandoned. The line itself ran in crazy horseshoes and prompted many who rode the line to say that the \\"Waynie\\" had been designed by a snake. The line stretched out for twenty eight miles. Horseshoe Curve, named for the more famous one near Altoona, was an astounding 35 degrees, or 164 feet radius. The line rose from 900 feet above sea level at Waynesburg, the low point, to just above 1400 feet above sea level at Summit about four miles south of Washington. There were points where locomotives had a climb of 200 feet in less than two miles. This combination made for travel on the line quite grueling. Because of both of these facts there were never any locomotives with greater than six driving wheels. There were Moguls on the line in later times, but these had to have the center drivers blind. This made for an interesting rolling stock and mainline. Waynesburg was the southern terminus. This was the main yard for the line and had a roundhouse, turntable, freight house, stockyard, all the associated yard structures for locomotives - and of course the station. The station was built in 1885 and the two track train shed was built in 1893. By 1904, the station had a long freight room, waiting room, ticket office, and the railroad's offices. The Downey House and the Walton House both had porters that met every train and shouted the name of their respective hotels. They toted luggage the several blocks uptown to the hotels. When war broke, Company K would all pile into the coaches at the station to ride to Washington and then on to Pittsburgh. After the line started failing, the yard was torn up and the station was passed on to a local wool dealer and then to the county road department. The yard was completely gone by the 1980s, and the station was near collapse. In the late 80's, the station was torn down; Conrail now has an office and a siding in this spot.

An extremely famous example is the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.

Zooming in on the Mandelbrot set Relationships of fractal curves to other fields Starting in the 1950s Benoit Mandelbrot and others have studied self-similarity of fractal curves, and have applied theory of fractals to modelling natural phenomena. Self- similarity occurs, and analysis of these patterns has found fractal curves in such diverse fields as # economics, # fluid mechanics, # geomorphology # human physiology, and, # linguistics.

It is currently programmed with a Gospel music and Ministry format and has a power of 1,000 watts; operation is limited to daytime hours to prevent interference to WJR, Detroit, Michigan. History on 1430 kHz The historic WENO broadcast on the frequency of 1430 kHz currently assigned to WPLN (AM). It was the only Nashville-area station in the early post-World War II era to program country music as its major format; even WSM, known in the public mind as the most influential station in the genre's development, at this time broadcast country music only during selected parts of the day (mainly at night, when the clear-channel signal penetrated deeply elsewhere in the country). The bulk of WSM's programming actually consisted of popular music, judged by its owners to be more \\"mainstream\\" and, hence, more attractive to the majority of listeners, particularly those affluent listeners most attractive to advertisers. WSM did not adopt country full-time until 1979. The unwillingness of most broadcasters in the Nashville market to allow country music prominent airplay meant that WENO became very influential in the country music industry in the 1950s and 1960s, especially for what was then a 5,000-watt station; as the main country music station in what had become the recording capital of country music, it provided recording executives with immediate input as to what country audiences, at least those in the Nashville area, desired. Disc jockey Bob Jennings, a one-time WLAC employee, was probably the most influential on-air personality at the station during this period. WENO was licensed to the Nashville suburb of Madison, Tennessee, then on the edge of a rural area; the station's five-acre (two-hectare) campus was promoted to listeners on air as the \\"WENO Radio Ranch\\". WENO began to decline as other, more-powerful stations switched to a country format, and as AM listeners in general, especially among the young, affluent consumers coveted by advertisers, switched increasingly to FM stations. By the 1980s, the station had gone silent; the callsign was used for a period by a gospel music station in Chattahoochee, Florida prior to being returned to Nashville for its current usage.

He was baptised in the village of Edern, whose name he later added to his first name Jean. Hallier, returning to France after World War II, first studied at the Pierre-qui-vire convent and then at a Paris lyc√©e and at the University of Oxford . He travelled extensively, even getting shipwrecked in the Persian gulf, and in 1960 founded the literary review Tel Quel along with Philippe Sollers and Jean-Ren√© Hughenin. Three years later he published his first novel, Les Aventures d'une jeune fille (\\"The Adventures of a Young Girl\\"). He then worked as an editor for publishing house Plon and completed a second novel, Le Grand √©crivain (\\"The Great Author\\"), in 1967. Deeply stirred by the 1968 student riots in Paris, Hallier disclosed left-wing political views in the partly autobiographical La Cause des peuples (1972). He engaged into politics full-time and started the first, leftist version of his paper, L'Idiot international, partly funded at first by Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. Hallier traveled to Chile after Pinochet's 1973 coup, carrying funds gathered by R√©gis Debray. Hallier was supposed to hand the money out to the Chilean resistance. However, he returned to Paris without the money and without having delivered it to the resistance, claiming he had bought 400.000 hectares in the Amazon Basin to provide shelter for the future Chilean exilesFr√©d√©ric Biamonti, Jean-Edern, le fou Hallier (a pun on fou √† lier, raving mad), France 5, 2005. 52 minutes. (See here for France 5's presentation) includes various images from the INA. He progressively broke up with the left-wing after this event. He also broke with the literary style of the nouveau roman with Chagrins d'amour, which was shortlisted for the Prix Goncourt in 1974. He hosted one of the first pirate radio stations in 1977, \\"Radio Verte\\", close to the ecology movement. Radio Verte only ran for two days, but wielded a lasting influence. He was suspected of simulating his own kidnapping in 1982, and of organizing a bombing in R√©gis Debray's building (which caused no casualties), a suspicion recently confirmed by R√©gis Debray and Gilles M√©nage, who worked for President Fran√ßois Mitterrand in the Elys√©e cell involved in the wiretap scandal. He also committed, it was alleged, less serious \\"attacks\\", such as setting fire to Fran√ßoise Mallet-Joris's doormat. Mallet-Joris was a member of the Goncourt jury, and the fire was meant as a protest against the way literary prizes were awarded. Politically, Hallier was successively a Maoist, an admirer of Fidel Castro, while at the same time getting close to Jacques Chirac, and supported Pinochet after his return from his expedition to Chile. For a time, he was close to Fran√ßois Mitterrand, who successfully ran for President in 1981 for the Socialist Party (PS), but later opposed him, threatening to reveal the existence of his illegitimate daughter Mazarine Pingeot. From the moment he threatened to publish a pamphlet on Mitterrand in 1982, he was closely watched by the special cell in the Elys√©e Palace in an attempt to block the revelation of Mazarine's existence. Hallier's telephone conversations were continually eavesdropped on by the Elys√©e palace from 1982 onward¬´ Jean-Edern Hallier mord encore ¬ª, Jean-Pierre Thiollet interview by S√©bastien Bataille, Causeur, 8 October 2016.. He and any potential publisher were hounded by tax inspectors dispatched to instil the fear of \\"God\\" (Mitterrand's nickname) into them. His apartment was also burned down in an arson attack. In 1991, L'Idiot international was one of the French newspapers which opposed participation to the Gulf War, and Jean-Edern Hallier went to Iraq to cover the events. Earlier, he had published Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses (1988), and personally delivered a copy of the book to the Iranian embassy in Paris. He was sued for defamation in articles published in L'Idiot international by Jack Lang as well as other people. He never defended himself during the trials, and never went to Appeal Court; he had to auction off his flat in order to pay damages to Bernard Tapie who had successfully charged him with defamation. Jean-Edern Hallier died from a cerebral haemorrhage after falling from his bicycle in Deauville in 1997.

Biography Olaus was a student at Uppsala University from its very first semester in 1477 until at least 1486, and later became a monk in the Brigittine Abbey of Vadstena. His name is a latinization of Olof Johansson or Olof Jonsson (or a similar form), with the byname indicating that he was from the island of Gotland. He is mentioned as a baccalaureus in artibus in an undated note, and was a magister artium by the time he entered the monastery in 1506. However, Olaus had not yet graduated as a baccalaureus in 1486, at the time of the last dated notes, which may be explained by his young age at the time of enrollment; students could enter university as young as seven or eight years old, but were not allowed to take the baccalaureate until the age of seventeen. Olaus died in 1516 during a visit to Poland. When entering the monastery in 1506, Olaus was required to give up all his private possessions; the notes from lectures in Uppsala which he donated to the monastery library made up seven bound volumes. These were eventually returned to Uppsala along with the rest of the library after the dissolution of the Abbey of Vadstena in the late 16th century, and they now belong to the Uppsala University Library. The manuscripts (C 195, 242, 599, 600, 601, 602 and 627) were edited and published with an introduction by the Latinist Anders Piltz in his dissertation Studium Upsalense (1977). The earliest notes cover theology, although Olaus started his studies in the Faculty of Philosophy in 1482. The notes show a strong emphasis on Aristotelian philosophy and the influence of Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas that pervaded education in all universities in Europe at the time. His teachers included the theologians Ericus Olai, remembered for his chronicle Chronica regni gothorum, and Peder Galle, who later became known as one of the leading opponents of the Protestant reformation in Sweden. The Uppsala curriculum also included Euclid's mathematics and the astronomy text De sphaera mundi by Johannes de Sacrobosco.Piltz, op. cit.; Sten Lindroth, Uppsala universitet 1477-1977 (1976), p. 17 f.

Through her second marriage, she became Grand Duchess Anastasia Nicholaievna Romanova of Russia. She and her sister \\"Militza\\" (Princess Milica), having married Russian royal brothers, were known colloquially as the \\"Montenegrin princesses\\" during the last days of Imperial Russia, and may have contributed to its downfall by the introduction of Grigori Rasputin to the Empress Alexandra. Childhood Princess Anastasia was born in Cetinje, Montenegro, on 4 January 1868, the third child and third daughter of her parents. Although named Anastasia at birth, after her paternal grandmother, she was often known Princess Stana Petrovich Njegosh of Montenegro. As of the date of her father's assumption of the title and style of Royal Highness in 1900, she became known as Her Royal Highness Princess Stana Petrovich Njegosh of Montenegro.Genealogy of the Royal Family of Montenegro. geocities.com She retained her childhood nickname of \\"Stana\\" to close relations. Anastasia was educated at the Smolny Institute with her older sister, Princess Milica.The Memoirs of Count Witte First marriage On 28 August n.s., 1889, at the Imperial Russian Palace of Peterhof, Stana married Prince George Maximilianovich of Leuchtenberg (later the Duke of Leuchtenberg.) The Duke had previously been married and widowed, with one son, Alexander Georgievich, from his prior marriage to Princess Therese of Oldenburg. The couple had two children before divorcing in St. Petersburg on 15 November 1906. * Sergei Georgievich, 8th Duke von Leuchtenberg (1890‚Äì1974). * Elena Georgievena, Duchess of Leuchtenberg, Princess Romanovskaya (1892‚Äì1971). She married on 18 July 1917, in Yalta, Count Stefan Tyszkiewicz (1894‚Äì1976, London). He was son of Count W≈Çadys≈Çaw Tyszkiewicz and Princess Krystyna Maria Lubomirska. By birth he was a member of powerful and wealthy Tyszkiewicz family, one of few families which belonged to Magnates of Poland and Lithuania. Second marriage On 29 April 1907, at the age of 39, Anastasia was married to Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856‚Äì1929). The marriage was childless. Both her husbands were descendants of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia (1796‚Äì1855): the first one was his grandson through a maternal line, and the second one was his grandson through a direct male line. Imperial Russia Both Anastasia and her second husband Nicholas were religious Eastern Orthodox Christians, with a tendency to and interest in Persian mysticism. Since the Montenegrins were a fiercely Slavic, anti-Turkish people from the Balkans, Anastasia reinforced the Pan Slav tendencies of Nicholas. Her sister, Princess Milica (Cetinje, Montenegro, 26 July 1866 ‚Äì Alexandria, Egypt, 5 September 1951) was married to Grand Duke Peter Nicolaievich Romanov of Russia, brother of Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaevich. The two Montenegrin princesses were thus also sisters-in-law, as their husbands were brothers. Anastasia and her sister were intrigued by the more mystical side of the Eastern Orthodox religion; they were early supporters of the French seer \\"Dr.\\" Philippe VachotRasputin: The Saint Who Sinned and of the starets Rasputin, and introduced both in turn to the Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, the last Tsarina of Russia. According to popular Russian belief, the influence of Rasputin was instrumental in the downfall of the Romanov family. Anastasia's husband, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856‚Äì1929), was Commander in Chief of the Russian Army during the first year of World War I, carrying out campaigns on the Austro-German front and in the Caucasus. His Supreme Commandership was terminated by Tsar Nicholas on 21 August 1915. Post Revolution In March 1917, the last Tsar was overthrown and the ruling Romanov family removed from power by the Bolsheviks. Anastasia and her husband lived from 1917‚Äì1919 first in the Caucasus, then in the Crimea. From Yalta in the Crimea, Anastasia and her husband escaped Russia in 1919 aboard a British battleship, HMS Marlborough. They settled briefly in Italy, living with her sister Elena, Queen of Italy and later in France, spending winters on the Riviera. She died in Cap d'Antibes on 15 November 1935, having outlived her husband by six years. Grand Duchess Anastasia and her husband died in exile and were originally buried in the church of St. Archangel Michael in Cannes, France. Requests to transfer their remains came from Nicholas Romanov, Prince of Russia, who died in 2014 and Prince Dimitri Romanov (who died in 2016), and were made in 2014. Their remains were re- buried in Moscow, at the Bratsky military cemetery in May 2015.

Born in the parish of Shadwell, near London, she was the daughter of Isham Randolph, a ship's captain and a planter. Born in London, Jefferson was proud of her heritage and brought customs of aristocracy to her family. Jefferson was revered within her family's household and positively influenced her son, Thomas Jefferson. Early life and education St Paul's, Shadwell on February 25, 1720, aged 15 days, the daughter of Isham Randolph of Shakspear Walk, mariner and Jane, his wife.

Codpeic Row D. Cock Hill E. Cut throat Lane. F. Labour in Vain Street Jane Randolph Jefferson was born on February 10, 1720, at Shakspear Walk, in Shadwell, then a maritime village about a mile east of the Tower of London. She was the daughter of Isham Randolph, a mariner and planter born in Virginia, and his wife Jane Lilburne Susan Rogers, who were married in St Botolph-without- Bishopsgate, London in 1717.Jefferson Family Bible, University of Virginia Special Collection The Randolphs lived in London and at Randolph's estate in Goochland County, Virginia. The Randolphs lived in Virginia by October 1725, when Jane's sister, Mary, was born in Williamsburg. As was common in the eighteenth century, she received her education entirely at home. Jane was the oldest of eight children and was raised in the Anglican faith. The Randolph family was described by a merchant in 1737 as a \\"very gentle, well-dressed people.\\" Marriage and family Randolph married Peter Jefferson in Goochland County, Virginia on October 3, 1739. More specifically, she may have been married at her father's plantation, Dungeness. For a year or two following her marriage, the couple lived at Peter's plantation and house, Fine Creek Manor. in present-day Powhatan County, Virginia near Fine Creek. (It is now part of Fine Creek Mills Historic District). In 1741 or 1742, they established a home along the Rivanna River, which they named Shadwell, after her London birthplace. In 1745, they moved to Tuckahoe Plantation, upon the death of William Randolph, a widower and Jane's cousin, to raise the Randolph children. The Jeffersons returned to Shadwell in 1752 when Thomas Mann Randolph came of age. Jane and Peter offered a privileged life for their family whether in established areas of eastern Virginia or, later, as they settled in the Shadwell plantation of the Piedmont. They ate on fine dishware, frequently entertained, enjoyed classic books and music, and attended dances. The family was considered prosperous and cultured. While Thomas Jefferson rarely mentioned his mother, much is known of her from extant records, including public records and inscribed family bibles.Malone, Dumas. Jefferson, The Virginian. Jefferson and His Time. Little, Brown. 1948, 437‚Äì40. She was particularly known for her ability to manage the family's finances. Peter died in 1757 at Shadwell, after which Jane inherited the Shadwell plantation and house. Jane managed the affairs of the household and raised her eight surviving children. The children ranged in age between 17 years and 22 months of age, the eldest a daughter and the youngest were a set of twins. Thomas, the eldest son, became the \\"man of the house\\" and assumed his father's business responsibilities. At the time of Peter's death, the estate included 2,750 acres, 66 slaves, and a staff that included hired laborers. In 1770, the main house at Shadwell was destroyed in a fire, and Jane had a smaller house built as a replacement. Thomas lived at Shadwell until the fire, at which time he removed to Monticello. By 1773, Thomas had taken responsibility for settling Jane's debts. Unable to reimburse him, she provided Thomas with deeds to her remaining slaves.Deed from Jane Randolph Jefferson for the Conveyance of Slaves, 29 September 1773,‚Äù Founders Online, National Archives, accessed September 29, 2019, [Original source: The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, vol. 27, 1 September‚Äì31 December 1793, ed. John Catanzariti. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1997, pp. 675‚Äì677.] Her health declined, requiring a number of visits by physicians and periodic convalescence with Thomas and Martha at Monticello. Her final years were lived under the strain of the American Revolutionary War. She died suddenly due to apoplexy on March 31, 1776. Jane was buried in the Monticello family graveyard. =Children= Jane had the following children: * Jane Jefferson (1740‚Äì1765) - close to her brother Thomas, she died unmarried at age 25. * Mary Jefferson Bolling (1741‚Äì1817) - her husband John Bolling III served in the Virginia House of Burgesses. * Thomas Jefferson (1743‚Äì1826), third President of the United States * Elizabeth Jefferson (1744‚Äì1774) * Martha Jefferson Carr (1746‚Äì1811) - her husband Dabney Carr, Thomas Jefferson's best friend and a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, helped launch the intercolonial Committee of Correspondence in Virginia in March 1773 * Peter Field Jefferson (1748) - died as an infant. * Peter Jefferson (1750) - died as an infant. * Lucy Jefferson Lewis (1752‚Äì1810) * Anna Scott Jefferson Marks (1755‚Äì1828) - twin of Randolph * Randolph Jefferson (1755‚Äì1815) - twin of Anna Scott =Relationship with Thomas= Over time, speculation regarding the nature of Thomas Jefferson‚Äôs relationship with his mother. Some look to the lack of remaining correspondence with his mother to mean that there was a lack of affection for his mother. Yet, Jefferson did not retain correspondence with many people important to him, such as his wife and best friend. There is evidence that Jane was ‚Äúrevered‚Äù in family remembrances and 19th century biographers. Author William Judson Hampton and others credited Jane for his success as a statesman and his writing abilities. She also instilled in her son her love of music and the finer things of life, as well as her religious beliefs. Jon Meacham finds that Thomas lived with his mother at Shadwell \\"long into Jefferson's adulthood\\" to indicate his affection for his mother. He did not move to Monticello until the main house at Shadwell was destroyed in a fire. His first daughter was named Martha, and his second daughter was named Jane Randolph Jefferson for his mother. Ancestry Ancestor William Randolph established the Randolph family in Virginia. He established a residence at Turkey Island and his descendants included General Robert E. Lee and Mary Isham Randolph, the grandmother of Chief Justice John Marshall (1755 ‚Äì 1835). Jefferson, said by historian Jon Meacham to have been proud of her British heritage, descended from gentry of England and Scotland, said to include the \\"powerful Scot Earls of Murray\\" (also spelled Moray). The Randolph family traced their heritage to Lord Regent of Scotland Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray of the 14th century.

The maximum takeoff weight is estimated at 2500 tons, hence its name. Design and development It has been designed to serve both as a conventional jet aircraft, flying at high altitudes transcontinentally, as well as a craft using the ground-effect at intercontinental routes across the sea. It is planned though to preferably fly through intercontinental routes, taking off from normal sea ports without needing special infrastructure. The concept derives from the VVA-14 of the 1970s. If it entered service, it would become the new largest airplane in the world. The concept of the aircraft was developed in 1980s by the Beriev Design Office in collaboration with TsAGI and TsIAM. There are two versions of the design that differ in the arrangement of the gear units and in the geometric design of the dragon structure. Initially, the NK-116 engine was designed to be installed, but foreign engines were also introduced, including the Rolls- Royce Trent 800 and General Electric GE. The NK-116 plans were developed by samara i [Kuznyecov Design Office] by 1994. Beriev is planned to cooperate with foreign partners in the development of the aircraft, including financing issues. It was estimated in 2007 that the cost of a development program would reach $ 10‚Äì15 billion. The company claims that such aircraft would operate as a \\"flying ship\\" that would compete with the shipping and air transport industries and could easily be integrated into the existing infrastructure.
