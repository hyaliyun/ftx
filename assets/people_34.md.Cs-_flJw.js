Early life and education  Partridge was born in Maryland in 1823. He graduated from Harvard University in 1841 and received masters and law degrees from Harvard in 1843. After graduation, Partridge practiced law in Baltimore and served on a federal commission appointed to resolve Mexican War claims.  Political Life  Partridge was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1856, serving as the chairman of its judiciary committee. He was appointed Maryland Secretary of State two years later by newly-elected Governor of Maryland Thomas H. Hicks. He served in the role from 1858 until 1861. In 1862, Partridge was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln to serve as the first foreign minister to Honduras, a post he held from April 25, 1862 until November 14, 1862. Partridge later served as the first U.S. foreign minister to El Salvador from June 15, 1863 to March 22, 1866, and as foreign minister to Venezuela from July 8, 1869 to May 9, 1870. Partridge was one of the individuals responsible for establishing diplomatic relations with El Salvador, and supervised the opening of the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador. In 1871, Partridge was appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant to the role of U.S. Ambassador to Brazil. He served in the post for nearly six years, from July 31, 1871 to June 11, 1877. During that time, Partridge retained a residence in Washington, D.C. In April 1882, Partridge was appointed as a foreign minister to Peru after the sudden death of Stephen A. Hurlbut. He took the oath of office and proceeded to the post, but did not present credentials. He was recalled after trying to coordinate the intervention of European diplomats in a war between Peru and Chile, which the Arthur administration said was unauthorized and a violation of the Monroe Doctrine. He left Peru in March of 1883. He was later named for a post as a foreign minister to Nicaragua, but his nomination was withdrawn from the United States Senate for consideration.  Death  In the last year of his life, Partridge sailed for Europe, traveled to France, Malta and the Holy Land, and resided for a brief period in Spain. Depressed over the deaths of his wife and children which had occurred over several years, he committed suicide in Alicante on February 24, 1884.

History Andrews and his family arrived in Western Australia from England by the ship Warrior in 1830. He purchased the southern half of Robert Ansell Partridge's property, which he named Daviot Park, for Daviot, the home town of his mother-in-law in Scotland. Additional land was purchased in the names of his children: Elizabeth C. Andrews, Alexanderina [sic] J. M. Andrews, Walter Boyd Tate Andrews, Henry James Andrews, Francis Jane Andrews, Henrietta M. W. Andrews in 1833 and John William Andrews in 1834. He was in 1841 a member of the Perth Town Trust and on 8 February 1842 took office as the first elected chairman of the committee that became the City of Perth. Andrews was associated with Richard W. Nash and John Schoales, jun. in various enterprises and public bodies including * Children's Friend Society, charged with the ensuring the welfare of minors sent out from England, most to become servants * Western Australian Steamboat Company, formed to establish water communication along the Swan River * W.

An assertion that Rev. Schoales emigrated to Perth is without foundation. =Arrivals in Adelaide= In September 1846 Walter Boyd Andrews and his youngest sons John William Andrews, Richard [sic, see below] Tapley Andrews and Lewis Grant Boyd Andrews sailed to South Australia aboard Joseph Albino and at some stage secured a residence in Gilbert Street. In January 1847 his wife and the remainder of their offspring Elizabeth Christiana Andrews, Alexandrina Isabella Andrews, Walter Boyd Tate Andrews, Frances Jane Andrews, and Henrietta Matilda Wittenoon [sic] Andrews sailed to South Australia on the same ship. =Return to Perth= Andrews must have returned to Western Australia around this time, as was appointed to the colony's Legislative Council in June 1847, just three months before his death. His remains were interred in the East Perth Cemeteries. The identity and fate of John William Andrews are not clear.

The incident, deemed accidental by the magistrates, was reported in only one newspaper, cursorily, and four weeks after the event. The home may have been the site of the accidental death of Horatio Spencer in 1839.

The narrow-gauge version (Konstal 2N) was built from 1950 to 1956. Trailers (tram units with no engine) were marked ND or 2ND. The N was the first tram manufactured in Poland after the Second World War.  Specifications  The N was a bidirectional motor tramcar, equipped with four sliding doors. In post-war Poland, many cities struggled with significant shortages of rolling stock, and therefore it was necessary to develop a tram with simple construction and easy assembly. It was decided to copy the construction of the German tram Kriegsstra√üenbahnwagen (KSW), developed during the Second World War to satisfy the demand of local tram transport companies. Due to the lack of motors, initially the ND trailers for Upper Silesia were built. The successor of Konstal N was Konstal 4N.  Usage  The N standard-gauge trams were supplied to: Gda≈Ñsk, Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski, Sopot, the Upper silesian conurbation, Krak√≥w, Pozna≈Ñ, Szczecin, Warsaw, and Wroc≈Çaw, while narrow-gauge versions were used, among others, in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça, Bydgoszcz, GrudziƒÖdz, ElblƒÖg, Inowroc≈Çaw, Jelenia G√≥ra, Legnica, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Olsztyn, S≈Çupsk, Toru≈Ñ and Wa≈Çbrzych.

She produced art during the 1960s and 1970s and was best known for her erotic artwork that explored femininity and pushed back against Brazil's oppressive government.  Biography  Teresinha Soares was born in 1927 in Arax√°, in the state of Minas Gerais. Soares is still alive today and lives and works in Belo Horizonte. She first began writing and acting before she pursued art as a full-time career, but she still continues to enjoy these activities. Soares was producing art while Brazil was under military rule. She fought back against Brazil's dictatorship by making art that was more political and challenged the government's conservatism and strict censorship rules. Her artwork was considered pop art, which depicts popular and mass culture, and Brazilian new figuration, a type of art that Soares was introduced to in either Rio de Janeiro or S√£o Paulo. Cecelia Fajardo-Hill and Andrea Giunta have stated that this is because her pieces, which were usually two-dimensional and three-dimensional, were vibrantly colored and contained bold shapes. According to Fajardo-Hill and Giunta, her artwork was also considered erotic. Traditionally, the erotic was defined as men having sexual thoughts about women. Women were always the object of men's sexual feelings and desires. The two have further stated that many artists like Teresinha Soares created erotic art that fought back against this sexist view of females. Unfortunately, Soares did receive criticism for her art throughout her career. Her artwork was controversial because it was erotic and dealt with topics like sexual orientation and liberation, women's rights, and Brazil's dictatorship. Her art greatly upset conservative Brazilian people.  Education  Soares was educated and trained in art, as she had studied at multiple universities and enrolled in several classes to better her art skills. She began her art training in 1965 at an art university in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. One year later in 1966, Soares continued her education by taking composition classes with Fayga Ostrower, who was a well-known painter. While taking composition classes, she also enrolled in metal engraving classes at a university in Belo Horizonte. In the same year, Soares moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to continue to take art classes. Some of the classes she was enrolled in were taught by the Brazilian artists Ivan Serpa, Rubens Gerchman, and Anna Maria Maiolino.  Artworks  = A Box to Make Love In (1967) = One of Soares's popular pieces of artwork is titled A Box to Make Love In. It was one of Soares's earliest sculptures and was displayed in an exhibit titled Box Form at the Petite Galerie in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A Box to Make Love In is a wooden box painted with bright greens, reds, and yellows. It has random objects attached to it like rubber tubes, a meat mincer, and a small bottle of dragon Vaseline. On the top of the box, there are two faces that make the shape of a heart. It also has a red fabric heart coming out of the box. A Box to Make Love In is a type of art called Brazilian new objectivity. Brazilian new objectivity is the creation of new forms of art that are slightly avant-garde. = She Hit on Me (BEDS) (1970) = One of Soares's well-known artworks is titled She Hit on Me (BEDS), which was installed at Municipal Park in Belo Horizonte, Brazil in 1970. She Hit on Me (BEDS) is three wooden beds that are the colors of a Brazilian football team and have shutters shaped as the bodies of naked females on it. On the other side of the shutters, there are brightly painted pictures of three football players named Pel√©, Yustrich, and Tost√£o. This particular piece was participatory artwork since visitors could interact with the piece by sitting on the beds. According to Sofia Gotti, She Hit on Me (BEDS) represented masculinity and femininity, but was also political because it allowed for the coming together of Brazil's national identity with the intimate, perhaps sexual, aspect of the beds. = Corpo a corpo in cor-pus meus (1971) = Teresinha Soares's first big installation is titled Corpo a corpo in cor-pus meus, which translates to \\"body to body in colour-pus of mine.\\" This installation was based on erotic drawings Soares made a year earlier titled Eur√≥tica. Corpo a corpo in cor-pus meus consists of four blocks of white wood that are all different shapes. They are all different heights and take up twenty-four square meters of space. The piece is open to participation by the viewers. When Corpo a corpo in cor-pus meus was first revealed to the public, there was an opening day performance at the Grand Salon of the Museu de Arte da Pampulha in 1970. Teresinha Soares spoke while performers danced around and on the blocks of wood. =Xif√≥pagas Uterinas= Another one of Teresinha Soares's artworks is titled Xif√≥pagas Uterinas. It is a painting of what seems to be a female body. The colors Soares used are bright greens, blues, reds, and oranges. Xif√≥pagas Uterinas can be considered pop art because of its vibrant colors.

Early life and education  Woodgate was born in 1981 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. As a child, Woodgate spent weekends illustrating comic books and building experiments with her brother. Woodgate reported being \\"an avid collector of crap and nonsense things, like the cigarette boxes of different brands, erasers with different shapes, stickers, letter papers, bottle caps, stones, coins.\\" Woodgate states she found developed her style as a teenager. She would illustrate her weekend adventures and gift photocopies to friends. She would then go on to draw her dreams, describing her drawings as \\"delirious nonsense images.\\" She received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Instituto Universito Nacional de Arte, Buenos Aires in 2004. Shortly after, Woodgate moved to Miami, where she gained recognition for clandestinely sewing labels inscribed with poetry into clothing at thrift stores, a project that Woodgate described as \\"poetry bombing.\\"  Career and exhibitions  Woodgate works in a variety of forms, including radio, public art, and sculpture. Woodgate's solo projects include New Landscapes, Art Positions, Art Basel Miami Beach (2012), Collectivism, Spinello Projects, Miami (2011); Growing Up, Miami-Dade Public Library (2010); Endlessly Falling, Dimensions Variable, Miami (2009) and Radio Espacio Estacion, an \\"ongoing online nomadic bilingual radio station.\\" Woodgate's public projects include I. Stanley Levine Memorial Bench, commissioned by the Art in Public Places committee of Miami Beach (2013), Hopscotch, commissioned by the Bass Museum, Miami (2013), Kulturpark, an initiative set in an abandoned amusement park in East Berlin (2012), 1111, Highway Billboards & Bus Shelter Posters, Commissioned by Locust Projects (2011), and Concrete Poetry, a permanent urban design project as a part of the Miami Poetry Festival in collaboration with O, Miami and Miami-Dade County's Department of Transportation and Public Works (2018). Woodgate has been a part of many group exhibitions, including the Denver Art Museum (2013), KW Institute for Contemporary Art, Berlin (2012); White Box, NY (2012); Gallery Nosco, London (2011); Good Children Gallery, New Orleans (2011); Naples Museum of Art, FL (2011); North Carolina Museum (2011); Montreal Biennale, Canada (2009) and Museum of Contemporary Art, Miami (2007). Her work is included in the permanent collection of the Denver Art Museum. Woodgate's work has been commissioned by many institutions, including the Bienal de las Am√©ricas, Denver; ArtPort, Tel Aviv; PlayPublik, Poland; DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities, Washington, DC; The Bass Museum of Art, Miami; Kulturpark, Berlin; Locust Projects, Miami y MassMOCA, Massachusetts; Storefront for Art and Architecture, St.Paul MN; CIFO Foundation, Miami; Love the Everglades Movement; and Florida International University. Woodgate is also the recipient honours and awards including the South Florida Cultural Consortium Fellowship, National Association of Latino Arts and Culture, San Antonio, TX (2011); Art Matters Grant, NY (2010) and the Joan Mitchell Foundation Grant (2008). She was included in the 2019 Whitney Biennial. Her work is included in the permanent collection of the Denver Art Museum.  Works  Woodgate's approach has been described as \\"speculative, practical, and site and context- responsive, presenting critical alternatives to concepts on social orders, resource management and information distribution bringing clarity, scale, and accessibility.\\" Some of Woodgate's pieces includeThe Ballroom, Milky Ways, Tower, Sandcastle, Hopscotch, and National Times, which was featured at the 2019 Whitney Biennial. Spinello Projects presented Woodgate at ABC Art Berlin Contemporary with The Ballroom, a collection of 50 outdated hand-sanded world globes kept to roll around on the floor. Spinello Projects' webpage reads, \\"by sanding away the topographical and political markers of the nations of the world down to homogenous land masses, Woodgate implies a kind of cartographic implosion. The Ballroom becomes a representation of an ever changing ecology and a cartography that urges for a new assessment of the land and its use.\\" Milky Ways is a continuation of Woodgate's Skin Rug Collection, in which Woodgate sews handmade rugs using the outer skin layer of discarded stuffed animals. Tower and Sandcastle are a part of Woodgate's I Want to Be a Princess Series, in which Woodgate used human hair to create 3000 bricks for her projects. Tower is approximately four feet tall. The castle's window frame is made of blonde hair, and Woodgate used senior citizens' hair for the white necessary for the ledge above the window. Sandcastle is made to look as if it had been molded from sand using a bucket. Hopscotch (2015) is a large sidewalk 'game' piece charted over the South Elm neighbourhood. According to Elsewhere, a museum and artist residency, \\"Hopscotch is an invitation to the public to imagine new ways to play in the city, to discover new parts of the neighborhood and to occupy public space. As a drawing that unfolds in real space, it also functions as a political map that inscribes the contours of the neighborhood.\\" National Times (2016) was featured in the Whitney Biennial 2019. National Times is a display of 40 clocks, spanning all three walls of the room, interconnected by a network of tubing, and synchronized by one master system. National Times‚Äô synchronization is attributed to the closed- circuit network set up in a ‚Äú‚Äòmaster/slave‚Äô configuration.‚Äù The system is controlled and kept in order by an individual ‚Äúdigital master clock [which] sends power signals to a series of analog slave clocks, commanding synchronized measure across an entire institution.‚Äù This frequency of time is synchronized to ‚Äúthe atomic clock at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which establishes official United States time.‚Äù Woodgate had also slipped sandpaper around each hand, so that as the hand make rotations around the face of the clock, the numerals are gradually etched away. The Whitney Biennial website reads, ‚ÄúConditioned by the current state of labor and power, the slave clocks progressively erode their functional value, collectively reclaiming autonomy in the process of disintegration.\\"  Whitney Biennial 2019  Woodgate was on the official artist list for the Whitney Biennial 2019. However, she was later one of the eight artists who asked the Whitney Museum of American Art to remove their works from the Biennial, \\"citing what they describe as the museum‚Äôs lack of response to calls for the resignation of a board member with ties to the sale of military supplies, including tear gas.\\" Woodgate and fellow artist Eddie Arroyo announced through Spinello Projects that ‚Äúthe request is intended as condemnation of Warren Kanders‚Äô continued presence as Vice Chair of the Board and the Museum's continued failure to respond in any meaningful way to growing pressure from artists and activists.‚Äù Her work National Times (2016) remained available for viewing during the Whitney Biennial 2019.

It is known from a fairly complete skeleton discovered in a borehole on Kolguyev Island, though damage to the specimen and loss of certain bones has complicated study of the genus. Boreopricea shared many similarities with various other archosauromorphs, making its classification controversial. Various studies have considered it a close relative of Prolacerta, tanystropheids, both, or neither. Boreopricea is unique among early archosauromorphs due to possessing contact between the jugal and squamosal bones at the rear half of the skull.  History  Boreopricea funerea was named and described by Soviet paleontologist L. P. Tatarinov in 1978. It was primarily based on a fairly complete skull and skeleton collected in 1972 from a borehole at Kolguyev Island in the Arctic Ocean. This holotype specimen, PIN 3708/1, included bones from most of the body, apart from the hip area, the tip of the snout, and various miscellaneous missing fragments. During Tatarinov's preparation, the bones were removed from a slab of rock and glued onto a large piece of card stock, positioned as they originally were in the rock. Tatarinov also mentioned a second specimen, PIN 3708/2, which was a portion of the snout. However, this specimen could not be found by subsequent studies and is now considered lost. The rock layers preserving Boreopricea fossils hail from the Ustmylian Gorizont, the most recent portion of the Vetlugian Supergorizont. The Ustmylian Gorizont is a regional biochronological zone which corresponds to the early Olenekian stage of the Early Triassic. The genus was redescribed in 1997 by University of Bristol paleontologists Michael Benton and Jackie Allen. They found that the specimen had been damaged during storage, as the skull was crushed and certain bones were missing (i.e. parts of the shoulder) or placed into odd positions (i.e. the hand). A plaster cast of the skull prior to its crushing was utilized for their description of the skull, but some areas, such as the palate and braincase, eluded restudy. Further study of the specimen was undertaken as part of Martin Ezcurra's 2016 study on archosauromorph systematics.  Description  Boreopricea would have had a sprawling posture and a generalized lizard-like body shape, though with a longer neck than most modern lizards. Benton & Allen (1997) estimated that Boreopricea had a total (snout tip to tail tip) length of 44.0 centimeters (17.3 inches), with a 2.9 cm (1.1 inch) skull and 23.0 cm (9.1 inch) inch tail, although these estimates are uncertain considering that the tip of the snout and large portions of the backbone are missing. = Skull = The skull had a broad snout, large orbits (eye sockets), and two temporal fenestrae (holes at the back of the skull) like other diapsid reptiles. Bones which lie at the top edge of the head, such as the nasal and frontal bones, were rectangular. The parietal bones are incomplete, but preserved portions contact the frontals along a straight edge without a parietal foramen (a hole in the skull, present in many reptiles, which houses the pineal gland). The jugal (cheek bone) was unusually shaped. It lacked a posterior process (lower rear prong), which meant that the lower temporal fenestra was open from below. Conversely, the ascending process (upper rear prong) was elongated, stretching above the lower temporal fenestra to contact the squamosal bone at the rear of the skull. This jugal-squamosal contact (unique to Boreopricea among early archosauromorphs) effectively barricades the postorbital bone from the edge of the lower temporal fenestra. The lower jaw was long and slender. Teeth, when preserved, were conical, sharply pointed, and slightly curved. = Postcranial skeleton = The neck was somewhat elongated. A sequence of five cervical (neck) vertebrae were preserved, probably the third to seventh vertebrae in the backbone. They were longer and narrower towards the skull and shorter and wider towards the shoulder. The later cervical and dorsal (torso) vertebrae had two rib facets on each side: a large, outwards-projecting facet which was triangular in cross section, and a smaller, circular facet which barely projects at all. The upwards-projecting neural spines of the vertebrae were low. Cervicals had narrow neural spines while dorsals had neural spines which gradually expanded into teardrop-shaped structures when seen from above. These expansions on the neural spines have been termed mammillary processes. The caudal (tail) vertebrae were numerous; they were broader towards the base of the tail and much thinner towards the tip. The scapula (shoulder blade) was very thin when seen head-on but large and boxy when seen from the side. Other shoulder bones, including a bony sternum, were described by Tatarinov (1978) but are now lost. The humerus (upper arm bone) had a shape like a heavily twisted hourglass, with the long axis of the portion near the shoulder offset at a right angle from that of the portion near the elbow. The ulna and radius (lower arm bones) were thin, curved rods like those of most other reptiles. Metacarpal III (the third bone of the hand) was as long as if not longer than metacarpal IV (the fourth bone of the hand), as with tanystropheids. Hindlimb bones are overall fairly typical in structure, although the femur (thigh bone) was broader than in most reptiles. The ankle was formed by four tightly-connected bones: the centrale, astragalus, calcaneum, and distal tarsal IV. Although the astragalus and calcaneum were the most prominent bones in the ankle, all of the ankle bones were similar in size. Boreopricea also lacked a hole along the contact between the astragalus and calcaneum and the second phalanx (toe bone) of the fifth toe was long, both traits shared by tanystropheids. Metatarsal V (the fifth bone of the foot) was hook-shaped, as with various other archosauromorphs.  Classification  When first described in 1978, Boreopricea was considered to be a \\"prolacertiform\\" reptile, meaning that its closest relatives were believed to be other long-necked lizard-like creatures such as Prolacerta and Macrocnemus. At this time, it was uncertain whether \\"prolacertiforms\\" were truly ancestral to modern lizards, or alternatively closer to archosaurs such as crocodilians and dinosaurs. In the 1980s, cladistics helped to clarify some aspects of reptile classification, and analyses by Jacques Gauthier, Michael Benton, and Susan Evans found substantial evidence that \\"prolacertiforms\\" were archosauromorphs (closer to archosaurs) rather than lepidosauromorphs (closer to lizards). Some of these analyses featured or mentioned Boreopricea. Benton (1985) noted that Boreopricea was probably a prolacertid, but differed from Prolacerta due to the shape of its nasal and squamosal bones. Evans (1988) placed Boreopricea as an intermediate branch between Prolacerta, which was closer to the base of the \\"prolacertiform\\" group, and Macrocnemus, which was closer to the most derived and bizarre \\"prolacertiforms\\", the tanystropheids. The classification of Boreopricea and \\"prolacertiforms\\" in general was given further scrutiny in 1997. Benton & Allen's redescription of the genus involved a phylogenetic analysis which found that Boreopricea was the sister taxon to Prolacerta, at least when superfluous and unstable data was cleared. Macrocnemus was not found to be close to either taxa; instead it was placed closer to the tanystropheids. Nour-Eddine Jalil performed a very similar study that year, as part of his description of the African \\"prolacertiform\\" Jesairosaurus. In contrast to Benton & Allen, Jalil's study placed Boreopricea deep within Tanystropheidae and unrelated to Prolacerta. Some traits of Boreopricea, such as a reduced posterior process of the jugal, were shared by both Prolacerta and tanystropheids. Boreopricea shared certain adaptations of the hands and feet with only tanystropheids, yet the shape of its scapula was closer to that of Prolacerta. A landmark study by David Dilkes in 1998 found that Prolacerta was more closely related to archosauriforms rather than tanystropheids, dissolving the concept of a monophyletic \\"Prolacertiformes\\" (i.e. a group where Prolacerta and tanystropheids had a common ancestor to the exception of archosaurs). Boreopricea would not be analyzed under this new framework until 2016, when it was restudied by Martin Ezcurra. Ezcurra did not consider Boreopricea close to tanystropheids, instead he found that it was an archosauriform relative, nearly as close as Prolacerta. Some features visible in Boreopricea which justify this placement include the presence of mammillary processes and a heavily twisted humerus. Ezcurra also named a new group, Crocopoda, which includes all archosauromorphs closer to archosaurs than to tanystropheids. Boreopricea was part of this new grouping, which also included rhynchosaurs, allokotosaurs, archosauriforms, and various other archosauriform-like reptiles, such as Prolacerta. The following cladogram is based on Ezcurra's 2016 study. A 2017 study by Adam Pritchard & Sterling Nesbitt slightly shifted the position of Boreopricea, placing it closer to allokotosaurs rather than Prolacerta and archosauriforms.  Paleoecology  Ustmylian (or Ustmylskian) layers of Russian biostratigraphy record a lakeside environment filled with animals recovering and diversifying after the Permian- Triassic extinction event, the greatest mass extinction in the history of the earth. The most common fossils at this time and place were freshwater amphibians such as Wetlugasaurus malachovi, Vladlenosaurus alexeyevi, Vyborosaurus mirus, and Angusaurus. On land, the small omnivore niche was filled by a diverse assortment of endemic procolophonids, including Timanophon raridentatus, Orenburgia bruma, and Lestanshoria massiva. The large predator niche was probably filled by early archosauriforms such as Chasmatosuchus magnus and Tsylmosuchus jakovlevi. These layers also preserved fossils of Scharschengia, which may be one of the earliest rhynchocephalians (tuatara relatives). Boreopricea funerea probably filled a small carnivore niche alongside mammal-like therocephalians as well as Microcnemus efremovi, a reptile which was similar to and probably closely related to it.

Since 2001, he has hosted the morning radio programme Bourdin Direct on RMC. Since 2018, he has also presented the monthly talk show Rien n'est impossible on RMC Story.  Early life and education  Jean- Jacques Bourdin was born in Colombes in the department of Hauts-de-Seine, the eldest of five children. He grew up in Al√®s in the Gard department in a family environment he describes as well-off and of Protestant culture. His father owned a small company and his mother was a housewife. At the age of 16, he participated at the 1965 presidential election by posing posters for the far right candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour with his father. Graduated with a high school certificate in literature in 1967, Jean-Jacques Bourdin briefly went to university, and then did various jobs.  Career  Having failed to join the daily sport newspaper L'√âquipe, Jean-Jacques Bourdin joined in July 1976 the sport service of the radio station RTL with the help of the director Raymond Castans. He stayed on RTL for 25 years, where he entered as a sport journalist, and progressively became a reporter and a presenter of programmes. In 1991, he became editor-in-chief and presenter of the midday programme of the station at rue Bayard in Paris. In 1996, he replaced Alain Krauss at the presentation of the interactive programme Les auditeurs ont la parole. In September 2000, not having a friendly relationship anymore with the direction of RTL, he left the radio and was replaced by Christophe Hondelatte, being unemployed. In 2001, he joined RMC as an advisor of Alain Weill, the new director of the station. He became the famous presenter of the morning programme Bourdin and Co from Monday to Friday, that focuses on information and interactivity with the auditors. The programme began with an interview with a politician. Concerning the stage organization, the journalist and his guest are both at less than one meter of distance, and the incisive tone of Jean-Jacques Bourdin participated on creating a tension and the success of the programme. Since 2007, his morning programme Bourdin Direct on RMC is broadcast simultaneously on BFM TV. During the 2007 French presidential election, he co-hosted between the two rounds the duel opposing the candidates S√©gol√®ne Royal and Nicolas Sarkozy on BFM TV. He voted Fran√ßois Bayrou at the first round and blank at the second round. At the 2012 French presidential election, he voted Fran√ßois Bayrou at the first round and Fran√ßois Hollande at the second round. From July to November 2010, he presents Abus de confiance on TF1, a programme about swindlers produced by Julien Courbet. Since October 2018, Jean-Jacques Bourdin presents a new talk show titled Rien n'est impossible, broadcast live on Friday evening once a month on RMC Story. The programme is broadcast on the first part of the evening and opposes two personalities about a current subject.  Personal life  Jean-Jacques Bourdin has two daughters from his previous marriage with Marie-Laure Bourdin : Cl√©mence, a restaurant owner, and Fanny, a journalist.

Selected Works  =Erasure= On September 26, 2014, the small town of Iguala, Mexico made national headlines when 43 college students were brutally abducted and slain. According to a Time Magazine article, ‚Äúcorrupt police and cartel thugs in the town of Iguala went on a killing spree.‚ÄùGrillo, Ioan. ‚ÄúMexico‚Äôs Nightmare.‚Äù TIME Magazine, vol. 184, no. 20, Nov. 2014, p. 30. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=f6h&AN;=99399119&site;=ehost- live&scope;=site. Although she didn‚Äôt know any of these victims of violence personally, Fern√°ndez tackled this tragedy through an installation entitled Erasure. The installation includes paintings, sculpture, text, as well as a performance. A video and photographs from the performance where Fern√°ndez paints the entirety of a room black and proceeds to paint herself black until nothing but her piercing green eyes are visible. In a 2017 interview for the Denver Art Museum, Fern√°ndez speaks about Erasure and the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping explaining, ‚Äú[T]hrough this absence of my identity, I was kind of wanting people to question who are these students? Who are these 43 individuals?‚Äù =Foreign Bodies= In the exhibit Foreign Bodies, Fern√°ndez takes on women‚Äôs rights within her own culture. During her Ted Talk, Fern√°ndez spoke of traveling to the Yucatan Peninsula where a tour guide explained that a sinkhole, also known as a cenote, with beautiful blue water was actually a mass grave for girls that were sacrificed as offerings to the Gods. An article was written about a team of archaeologists that went to the Yucatan Peninsula discovered evidence that the human sacrifice Fern√°ndez learned of was more than a myth about the Mayan culture. The October 2003 issue of National Geographic explains, ‚Äú[N]ewly discovered skeletons have yield evidence of sacred funerary rites and human sacrifice.‚ÄùVesilind, Priit J. \\"Watery Graves of the Maya.\\" National Geographic, vol. 204, no. 4, 10, 2003, pp. 82-94,96,98-100. ProQuest, https://search.proquest.com/docview/200957703 Shaken by this, Fern√°ndez returned to the cenote in Mexico in 2012. This time she rented a white stallion named Tequila and outfitted in stilettos and a black dress, she entered the cenote on horseback attempting to conquer nature instead of being sacrificed in it. In a 2014 interview with SF Art Enthusiast, Fern√°ndez illuminates, ‚ÄúI went to a sink hole in Mexico where thousands of virgins had been drowned as sacrificial offerings to the gods. I went into the sink hole and attempted to ride a wild white stallion, as a way to reclaim or change the history of that site.‚Äù =Borrando la Frontera (Erasing the Border)= Borrando la Frontera or Erasing the Border is Fern√°ndez‚Äôs most renowned performance. It is possibly also the most personal. She used shade of sky blue paint to give the illusion of camouflaging a section of the barrier at the Mexico-United States Border in San Diego into the sky and surrounding ocean. It was the same border that she crossed as a child to come to emigrate from Mexico to the United States with her family. She did this for the first time in 2011 after learning about the way undocumented people were suffering. In a Hyperallergic article dated November 2, 2015, Fern√°ndez enlightened, ‚ÄúAs immigration becomes more and more of an apparent reality with deeper problems, and intimate stories of despair and frustration get revealed, the general public is more open to listen and talk about it. And art is doing just this, opening a platform to address these issues in new ways, being open, honest, but also imaginative.‚Äù Borrando la Frontera started off as an understated performance piece with photo and video documentation and transformed when she was invited by Arizona State University to continue the project at the US- Mexico border in Nogales. Circa 2003-2004, Fern√°ndez‚Äôs mother took her to Friendship Park, where the U.S./Mexico border meets and extends into the Pacific Ocean. Fern√°ndez credits this visit as being the time that inspired her to use the border as a site specific part of her work. This came full circle more recently, as both her mother and father were involved in the third performance of Borrando La Frontera. On April 9, 2016, Fern√°ndez collaborated with her parents and Border/Arte to perform Borrando La Frontera in three locations along the border: Agua Prieta, Ju√°rez, and Mexicali. In an interview with Lakshmi Sarah for KQED, Fern√°ndez explained the impact of this third performance and installation. \\"It was so incredibly moving to see so many people, from so many different communities and walks of life, come together to want to be a part of something bigger. I have worked with my family before, but this time, my mom and dad helped lead Borrando la Frontera in Mexicali all on their own. I'm still feeling the immense high from it all, as well as exhaustion. You feel different, like you have a voice that can really talk back to the government and say, 'We can help paint a different reality or truth, using paint and imagination as your weapon... no guns, no violence, just the community working together, tearing down walls with creativity.‚Äô‚Äù = Illustrations for Rebecca Solnit's Men Explain Things to Me = Fern√°ndez also provided illustrations Rebecca Solnit‚Äôs iconic book of essays, Men Explain Things to Me. In an interview with Paul Farber for Monument Lab on June 6, 2019, Fern√°ndez described how Solnit approached her about including some of Fern√°ndez's art in her book. Fern√°ndez explains that one of the images \\"was a performance that I did around the time of SB 1070 in Arizona, the introduction of racial profiling. There's the hiding of identity, but then revealing of other truths in the attempt to hide your identity.‚Äù She continues, articulating how her art work ties to the subject of Solnit‚Äôs title essay: \\"And so much of that writing [Solnit‚Äôs] is trying to push through that insistence of hiding the identity. That initial story that she begins with of someone insisting that they know more about the story that she wrote more than her.\\" Solnit and Fern√°ndez have continued to partner together in various capacities, including a quote from Solnit that Fern√°ndez featured in a text installation in her exhibit Erasure as well as an exhibition catalogue essay that Solnit penned for Fern√°ndez's 2015 exhibit All or Nothing at Humboldt State University's then First Street Gallery (now Third Street Gallery).

Bendaoud was sentenced to four years in prison in March 2019 for harboring Abaaoud and Chakib Akrouh, one of the other terrorists involved in the attacks. Bendaoud had previously been acquitted of the charges in February 2018. In August 2019, he was sentenced to an additional six months in prison for verbally assaulting a prison guard. Prior to the attacks, Bendaoud already had an extensive criminal history. In 2006 he killed his best friend, David, who tried to break up a fight. Bendaoud was accusing another friend of stealing his cellphone. He was later sentenced to eight years in prison for voluntary manslaughter (out of which he only served six). At the time of the attacks, Bendaoud was a drug dealer. A few days after the attacks, Bendaoud was contacted by Abaaoud's cousin, Hasna Aitboulahcen, asking for a flat to rent for two people, to which Bendaoud agreed. Aitboulahcen's flatmate contacted the police and the flat was raided on November 18, resulting in Abaaoud, Aitboulahcen and Akrouh all being killed. While the raid was ongoing, Bendaoud was interviewed and insisted he was unaware the people he was renting to were the wanted terrorists and was arrested live on TV. Bendaoud was acquitted at his first trial in February 2018 on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence that he knew the people he was renting to were terrorists. The Paris prosecutor appealed the court's decision, and Bendaoud was found guilty in a second trial and sentenced to four years in prison in March 2019. In August 2019, he was sentenced to an additional six months in prison for verbally assaulting a prison guard. Bendaoud has been the subject of numerous internet memes. Bendaoud was widely mocked in France because of his interview where he claimed to have no idea who the men he was renting to were. Following his conviction, a video of Bendaoud leaving court went viral and became known as the \\"Tough Guy Entrance\\".

It was discovered on 2005 March 11 by Marc William Buie at Kitt Peak Observatory. The primary body measures perhaps in diameter. Its ‚âà120-kilometer (75-mile) companion «ÉH√£unu was discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009. The «ÇK√°Ã¶g√°ra‚Äì«ÉH√£unu system is currently undergoing mutual occultation and eclipsing events in which one body casts its shadow upon or obstructs the view of the other. Names The proposed names «ÇK√°Ã¶g√°ra and «ÉH√£unu are from the mythology of the «ÄXam people of South Africa. (also rendered ) and his brother-in-law fought an epic battle in the east using thunder and lightning, producing mountainous clouds and rain. The conflict was over «ÇK√°Ã¶g√°ra's returning his younger sister, «ÉH√£unu's wife, to their parents.‚â†kagara's fight with !haunu in the east. Lucy Lloyd xam notebooks, vol. VIII-30, July 1879. The proposed names must be approved by the International Astronomical Union's Working Group for Small Body Nomenclature before they become official. In the «ÄXam language, the names are thought to have been pronounced Bleek & Lloyd wrote when the posterior release of the click was audible. Based on the sounds attested in the closely related language N«Ång, this may therefore represent a palatal pulmonic-contour click, though this is not certain. and ,Based on the co-occurrence of the letter for aspiration of the click and the tilde for nasalization on the following vowel, together with the patterns of sounds in N«Ång, it is suspected that the click in «ÉH√£unu has delayed aspiration (i.e., is a long, aspirated, nasalized click), rather than a simple , though again this is not certain. respectively.Will Grundy: 469705 (how to say) The initial letters «ÇK and !H (and indeed the letter «ÄX in '«ÄXam') represent some of the many click consonants that characterize «ÄXam and other San languages. The diacritic under or after the first 'a' in «ÇK√°Ã¶g√°ra/«ÇKa ªgara indicates that it is a pharyngealized vowel, which are also characteristic of San languages. Usually, when speaking English, the click consonants in words from «ÄXam and other San languages are simply ignored (much as Xhosa is pronounced () rather than ), resulting in () and (). ASCII approximations of the names are =Ka'gara (or =Kagara, #Kagara, etc.) and !Haunu. Orbit and occultations «ÇK√°Ã¶g√°ra is a cold classical Kuiper belt object. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 44 AU once every 290 years. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 3¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. If the two bodies are spheres with equal density, then mutual occultation events between «ÇK√°Ã¶g√°ra and its satellite «ÉH√£unu should have begun in 2015 and should continue until 2035. When «ÇK√°Ã¶g√°ra passes in front of «ÉH√£unu, events may last as long as 8 hours, but when «ÉH√£unu passes in front of «ÇK√°Ã¶g√°ra, they are expected to last as long as 2 days. These latter events are only expected to occur from 2022 to 2027. Formation Prograde orbits dominate tight binary systems such as 469705 «ÇK√°Ã¶g√°ra, those with satellite semimajor axes less than about 5% of their Hill radii. Grundy et al. suggest that this could be \\"the signature of planetesimal formation through gravitational collapse of local density enhancements such as caused by the streaming instability\\", which has been suggested as the formative mechanism of the only visited planetesimal, 486958 Arrokoth.

Production by province = Newfoundland and Labrador = Newfoundland and Labrador is the third largest petroleum producer in Canada, making up 4.4% of Canada's petroleum. As of 2015, the province produced over 27,370 m3 per day of light crude oil from the Grand Banks offshore oil fields. The Jeanne d'Arc Basin is the province's most active oil field project. = Nova Scotia = The offshore oil industry of Nova Scotia accounts for about 0.07% of Canadian petroleum production. The majority of its offshore industry is located on the Nova Scotian continental Shelf, within the Sable Island offshore natural gas fields. In 2015, Nova Scotia produced 438 m3 of liquid natural gas per day. As of 2019, that figure is up to 3,200 m3 per day.  Production  = Jeanne d'Arc Basin = The Jeanne d'Arc Basin is located about 340 km to the southeast form the Island of Newfoundland, Canada. The geological region is defined by an offshore sedimentary basin covering an area greater than 6000 km3 and 20 km in depth. Hydrocarbon exploration first began during the 1960s by Amoco and Imperial Oil. Exploration wells indicated the potential of the basin for active petroleum drilling. In 1979, the first major well began pumping operations. = Sable Offshore Energy Project = Since 1999, the Sable Offshore Energy Project (SOEP) is an ongoing initiative to conduct natural gas exploration along the Nova Scotian continental Shelf. This project produces over 14,000,000 m3 of natural gas and 3,200 m3 of liquid natural gas daily. The major partners include ExxonMobil, Shell Canada, Imperial Oil, and Pengrowth Energy. = Shelburne Basin Venture Exploration Drilling Project = Beginning in 2013, this exploratory hydrocarbon drilling project was conducted by Shell Canada about 250 km southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Between 2013-2015, seven exploration wells have been proposed. The project took place in the Shelburne Basin, which has been a consistent source for Nova Scotian hydrocarbon production.  Oil fields  = Hebron-Ben Nevis oil field = The Hebron-Ben Nevis oil field is located 350 km east from the coast of Newfoundland, situated in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin. The oil field was discovered in 1981, however only began production in 2017. An estimated 700 million barrels of light crude oil exist within the oil field. = Hibernia oil field = The Hibernia oil field is located 315 km from the east from Newfoundland in 80 m of water. The Hibernia platform is the world's largest oil platform by weight and size. The oil field was discovered in 1979 but production only began in 2007.

It is used in cases of severe fetal anemia, such as when fetal red blood cells are being destroyed by maternal antibodies. IUTs are performed by perinatologists at hospitals or specialized centers.  History  Intrauterine transfusion (IUT) was introduced in 1963 by A.W. Liley. Early IUTs involved transfusion into the fetal peritoneum (abdomen). Almost 20 years later, the procedure was improved to a transfusion into the umbilical vein, which allowed for better absorption of red blood cells.  Indications  = Hemolytic disease of the fetus = Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) is a rare condition that affects 3 out of 100,000 to 80 out of 100,000 patients per year. It occurs when maternal antibodies cross the placenta during pregnancy and destroy fetal red blood cells (RBCs). This process can lead to fetal anemia, and in severe cases can progress to hydrops (edema), ascites, heart failure, and death. For HDFN to occur, the fetus must be antigen positive (paternally inherited) and the mother must have antibodies to the given antigen. Such antibodies typically form when the mother undergoes alloimmunization to the antigen during a previous pregnancy or transfusion. Historically, RhD alloimmunization accounted for the majority of cases. However, the rates of these cases have been significantly reduced by RhIg (RhoGam) administration. Measures are not available for preventing alloimmunization to non-RhD antigens (Kell, Duffy, Rhc, RhE, etc.), which can also cause HDFN. Fetal anemia is monitored throughout pregnancy using Doppler measurement of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) peak systolic velocity (PSV). This non-invasive technique is used as a surrogate measurement for assessing fetal anemia. Doppler multiples of median (MoM) measurements exceeding 1.5 are correlated with moderate to severe anemia. At this point, invasive testing via percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling (PUBS, also called cordocentesis), potentially followed by fetal transfusion is indicated.  Procedure  Prior to the procedure, compatible blood is obtained. This is usually type O, RhD-negative, and antigen-negative for maternal RBC antibodies. The selected blood then undergoes irradiation and leukocyte reduction.. Antenatal corticosteroids are typically given to mothers before IUT to anticipate the need for an emergency cesarean section The procedure is usually performed in a hospital under sterile conditions, within or near an operating room in case an emergency cesarean section is necessary due to complications caused by the procedure. The mother's abdomen is cleaned with an antiseptic solution, and she may or may not be given a local anesthetic injection to numb the abdominal area where the transfusion needle will be inserted. During the procedure, medicine may be given to the fetus to temporarily stop fetal movement. An ultrasound is performed to view the position of the fetus and to help guide the needle. The first step is to locate a relatively stable segment of the umbilical cord. The procedure may be achieved with more ease if the placenta is in the anterior position. However, if the placenta is in the posterior position, the fetus might block direct access to the umbilical cord. Once a suitable location is established, the needle is inserted through the mother‚Äôs abdomen into an umbilical vessel using ultrasound guidance. If insertion into an umbilical vessel is not possible, blood may be transfused into the fetal abdomen. Prior to the transfusion, percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling (PUBS) is conducted. The fetal blood sample is drawn and immediately analyzed for hematocrit using an automated analyzer in the operating room or hospital hematology laboratory. The result confirms the level of fetal anemia and indicates the correct amount of blood to be transfused. With the needle still in place, the blood is delivered into the fetus's umbilical cord blood vessel. Following the transfusion, an additional blood sample is drawn and analyzed to determine the ending hematocrit level. The target hematocrit is usually at least 40. In a study of 135 IUTs performed on 56 fetuses, the mean hematocrit was 25.2 before IUT and 40.3 after IUT. This study also noted that repeated IUTs were generally needed in anemic fetuses. In this study, there was a median of two IUTs per fetus, with a range of one to seven.  Associated risks  An IUT is typically only performed when the fetus is known or suspected to have life- threatening anemia. Risks of intrauterine transfusions may include uterine infection, fetal infection, preterm labor, excessive bleeding and mixing of fetal and maternal blood, amniotic fluid leakage from the uterus, or (rarely) fetal death. Fetal survival rates after intrauterine transfusion through the umbilical cord are more than 90% for fetuses that do not have hydrops and about 75% for fetuses that have hydrops. In a study of 135 IUTs performed on 56 fetuses over 14 years, 121 (90%) of the procedures were uneventful. In 14 cases, (10%), mild adverse events occurred. The most common mild events were prolonged hemorrhage from the puncture site and uterine contractions. In two cases, these led to a severe adverse event: one emergency cesarean section within 24 hours after IUT and one preterm birth within 7 days after IUT. There were no fetal or neonatal deaths in the study population. Risks associated with an IUT may be avoided by delivering the fetus (via induction or cesarean section) if an acceptable gestational age has been reached.

The lake originated as a series of beaver ponds along Delintment Creek, a tributary of Silver Creek in Harney County. In 1940, the United States Forest Service combined and enlarged the ponds, and in 1953 local interest groups made further changes to improve conditions for fishing and other recreation.

The Costa Rican cinema comprises the art of film and creative movies made within the nation of Costa Rica or by Costa Rican filmmakers abroad. Though nearly all Costa Rican cinemas exclusively show Hollywood productions, the number of films produced in Costa Rica has increased in recent years. The films range from horror and comedy films focused on entertainment value to art cinema. The country's art films are often character studies, focusing on aesthetics and narrative and less on political issues. Costa Rican auteur directors successful in the international art film circuit include Paz F√°brega and Isthar Yasin Gutierrez.  History  The first full-length film produced and directed by Costa Ricans is El Retorno in 1930. Historically, opportunities to create films in Costa Rica was limited. The prohibitive cost of equipment and materials for celluloid film-making combined with the lack of both private and governmental support meant that a national or regional film industry was difficult to realize. The Centro de Cine was founded in 1973, but remained stagnant for decades. Only one fictional feature film was made in the 1990s in all of Central America - Guatemalan director Luis Argueta‚Äôs El Silencio de Neto (Neto's Silence, 1994). However, increased funding and institutional support, the lower cost of digital film-making, and alternative distribution channels have led to increased film production since 2000. The Central American film fund Cinergia was launched in 2004 with support from foreign nonprofits and film industries. It supported 80 productions in Central America including Agua Fr√≠a de Mar (Cold Water of the Sea, 2010) by Paz F√°brega, which earned the Tiger Award at the Rotterdam Festival. In 2015, a national production fund called El Fauno was launched and supported 40 indigenous film, TV, and Internet projects as of April 2019. Regional organizations like Ibermedia and DocTVLatinoam√©rica have helped fund projects in Costa Rica. Young graduates from film schools in Europe, the United States, and especially Cuba's International School of Filmmaking and Television have returned to the country to make films. Several local colleges such as Universidad Veritas and the University of Costa Rica are now offering film training. Though more films are being produced, broad distribution is still an issue for Costa Rican films. Even well-received films often aren't available on DVD via streaming. Regional film festivals have succeeded in recognizing and promoting regional films and promoting regional connections. The first regular showcase for local films in Central America was Costa Rica's Filmmaking and Video Showcase, which lasted from 1992 to 2012. In 2012, it became the International Film Festival San Jos√© Peace on Earth, and included both national and international films for the first time. In 2015, it expanded into the Costa Rican International Film Festival, and grew to show 73 films in 2017. The festival shows films in competition for prizes in national, regional, and international categories and provides help for projects underway. The Icaro Central American Film Festival has promoted Central American film regionally and internationally. Since 2004, the festival's touring showcase, known as Muestra √çcaro, has been exhibited in every Central American country and, recently, to Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the US. Costa Rica's National Film Council started submitting entries for the Oscars since 2005. A new National Cinematheque building is being constructed in San Jose to support screenings and educational programs. As of January 2015, Maikol Yordan de viaje perdido (Maikol Yordan Travelling Lost, 2014), a neo-costumbrista comedy directed by Miguel G√≥mez and the comedy troupe La Media Docena, was the most successful film in the Costa Rican box office. It attracted 700,000 viewers and showed in local cinemas for six months.

The size of the fire site was about , and it emitted toxic smoke across the city‚Äôs northern suburbs. The fire was finally extinguished four days after it started. The company which operated the property where the fire took place, Bradbury Industrial Services, collapsed in July 2019, leaving taxpayers to potentially foot a multimillion-dollar clean-up bill.Company behind Campbellfield fire collapses, taxpayers could foot bill On 1 August 2019, the administrators for the company were given three months to clean up the site.EPA sets deadline on Campbellfield chemical waste cleanup  Background  The fire occurred at a waste management factory owned by Bradbury Industrial Services on Thornycroft St at 6:40 am. Buildings and vehicles were turned into fireballs and chemical drums sent soaring high above the warehouse as the inferno raged for hours. A witness in a nearby suburb to the fire said he saw a \\"massive explosion that looked like a mushroom cloud\\". Two other fires had broken out in the facility previously. Bradbury Industrial Services provides storage and disposal services for hazardous and industrial waste, and specialises in treating solvent and other waste from paint and related industries.  Fire  Metropolitan Fire Brigade firefighters brought the blaze under control by midday on 5 April; however, the fire was not fully extinguished until four days later. About thirty people were believed to have escaped the building before the firefighters arrived. At least two factory workers were hospitalised as a result of severe burns from the fire, with one employee receiving an eye injury. The fire was initially contained within four hours by 175 firefighters. Fire crews remain at the scene, using heat- detection devices to continually identify and dampen-down hotspots. The fire forced the closure of nearby schools and businesses. Some residents fled their homes to escape toxic fumes. A number of schools and kindergartens in proximity to the fire were closed as of 7 April including: * Dallas Brooks Community Primary School in Dallas * Coolaroo South Primary School in Coolaroo * Broadmeadows Primary School in Broadmeadows * Hume Central Secondary College in Broadmeadows * Meadows Primary School in Broadmeadows * Hume Valley School in Dallas * St Thomas More Primary School in Hadfield * Ilim College in Broadmeadows * Holy Child Primary School in Dallas * St Dominic‚Äôs Primary School in Broadmeadows * Corpus Christi School in Glenroy  Investigations  Investigations into the cause of the fire were started on 9 April, involving police, fire investigators from the Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade, WorkSafe Victoria, and the Victorian Coroner. Initial speculations focused on the illegal or improper storage of flammable chemical waste. The fire began less than one day after Victorian Environment Protection Authority authorities inspected the factory, and fifteen days after the factory had its license revoked for storing three times as much waste as it was permitted. The EPA's inspection on 4 April discovered 300,000 litres of chemicals inside. EPA executive director Damian Wells said the factory contained \\"highly flammable materials\\". The EPA has begun an independent review into its systems and processes for dealing with toxic waste.

Career Almond was a photographer for John Cassavetes' 3 Plays of Love & Hate and was also involved in many of Cassavetes' projects that her brother, Bo Harwood, was involved in. Almond was an archival photographer for Charles Kiselyak's book and film A Constant Forge (2000) about the 3 Plays of Love & Hate and Cassavetes' life. The first exhibition of Almond's black-and-white photos was a collection of 55 photos, Jerusalem: The Gathering of Nations (1987), presented at the Saidye Bronfman Centre in Montreal. The photos in this show were selected from the over 10,000 photos (b/w and color) Almond had taken while on a photo assignment for the architect, Moshe Safdie for his book The Harvard Jerusalem Studio. Saidye had hired a team as part of a large urban design project in Jerusalem and approximately 150 of Almond's photos were selected to illustrate this book. In 1998, the Canadian Photography Institute of the National Gallery of Canada purchased eight of Almond's platinum and palladium photographic prints: Shadows and Shoes, Tinehir, Morocco (1985); A Room of her Own, Darman, India (1996); Tiger Beware, Udaipur, India (1996); Cool Passage, Farafra, Egypt (1987); Kitchen, Farafra, Egypt (1987); Algerian Villager, Bousaanda, Algeria (1985); Main Street, Mersa Matruk, Egypt (1991) Water Carriers and Donkey, Saqqara, Egypt (1987) for the national collection:.

Picture shows light snow on Mount Robie Reid. The Hatzic Valley is the southerly, lowland portion of the Fraser Valley Regional District Electoral Area \\"F\\" of British Columbia‚Äôs Lower Mainland. The valley was carved as a result of southward glacial action, being \\"centered along a low‚Äêlying glacial trough that extends from Stave Lake to the Fraser Valley.\\" The perimeter of Hatzic Valley is described in the current British Columbian Official Community Plan document ‚ÄúOfficial Community Plan for Hatzic Valley, Electoral Area ‚ÄúF‚Äù Bylaw No. 0999, 2010‚Äù, published by the Fraser Valley Regional District, and which illustrates the valley as occupying the area from the southeast point of Stave Lake in the northwest to Hatzic Lake in the south. The valley is flanked on the eastern side by the Douglas Ranges, the ridge nearest the valley known as Durieu Ridge, the southern point of which forms Dewdney Peak. The valley includes the area occuped by Davis Lake Provincial Park and Mount St. Benedict in the north and that of Cascade Falls Regional Park in the northeast. The valley measures about 12.5 kilometers long from Davis Lake to Hatzic Lake, and about 2.5 kilometers wide at Durieu. The valley is home to approximately 1,300 people. Hatzic Valley in turn comprises various unincorporated communities, specifically Hatzic Prairie in the south, the town of Durieu in the center, and the localities of McConnell Creek and Miracle Valley in the north. Hatzic Valley communities =McConnell Creek= North across Hartley Rd viewing the McConnell Creek Community Hall with Mount St. Benedict behind it, June 2019. McConnell Creek is the portion of Hatzic Valley that exists north of Durieu Road. A portion of McConnell Creek - 14100 Stave Lake Road - is called \\"Miracle Valley\\" and is described below. McConnell Creek is also the former name of Cascade Creek that drains Cascade Falls and runs through the McConnell Creek area, draining into Stave Lake. McConnell Creek is named after a logger, Jack McConnell, who logged in the area, but in fact lived in Silverdale, British Columbia. McConnell changed his name from John Connell after the failure of his Columbia River logging business. The bulk of McConnell Creek is at an elevation of around 100 meters above level, with the lowest point being Durieu Road at around 20 meters above sea level. The highest point in McConnell Creek, and also the Hatzic Valley perimeter as defined by the FVRD above, is the summit of Mount St Benedict at 1,278 meters above sea level. Historically, McConnell Creek supported various timber mills, all of which have since shut down. The area was electrified in 1949, the same year that the McConnell Creek Community Hall on Hartley Road opened. Miracle Valley Miracle Valley is a parcel of land located at 14100 Stave Lake Road within the McConnell Creek community. It was purchased in 1963 by The Salvation Army, and is so-named as the Salvation Army used it as a rehabilitation center for recovering substance abusers. The facility ran into financial difficulties and closed in 2010, it was sold to become Khalsa Centre, a cultural retreat/campground with an attached blueberry farm. =Hatzic Prairie and Durieu= North across Durieu Road, June 2019. Hatzic Prairie is the portion of Hatzic Valley that exists south of Durieu Road. Historically, Hatzic Prairie was first occupied by members of the Kwantlen (formerly Sto:lo) First Nations as a summer camping place. The first recorded settler of European descent was the Irish squatter John or James Kelly in the 1860s who was formerly a Cariboo teamster, and further to being apprehended for illegally importing cattle was deported and left for the USA. Subsequently in the 1880s some 1,200 acres of land, up to present-day Durieu Road was owned by the Burton family, and known as \\"Burton Prairie\\". The name changed around 1889 after Ralph Burton sold up because of the flooding of the Fraser River. One of the new owners, Livingston Thompson - a former army captain - built a post office that opened on 1 April of the same year, he became the first postmaster and renamed the land to Hatzic Prairie. Looking West over Hatzic Prairie Community Hall, June 2019. The post office was subsequently renamed on 1 March 1910 as \\"Durieu Post Office\\" in remembrance of the life of the Archbishop of New Westminster Pierre-Paul Durieu who had died around a decade earlier. This name change led to the settlement name \\"Durieu\\" being recognised on 12 December, 1939 by British Columbian government officials and cartographers. Although the post office closed around three years later on 31 December 1942, the name Durieu stuck, in fact Durieu was elevated from \\"settlement\\" to \\"community\\" status since the BC government definition of community had been met, being \\"an unincorporated populated place, generally with a population of 50 or more, and having a recognized central area that might contain a post office, store and/or community hall, etc, intended for the use of the general public in the region\\". Flooding on Hatzic Prairie The name \\"Hatzic Prairie\\" owes its existence to renaming by Livingstone Thompson further to the land sale by Ralph Burton, a sale which, as mentioned above, would not have occurred but for flooding of the area by the Fraser River. The area continued to flood - notably in 1894 \\\\- but the most serious recorded flooding by the Fraser River was the \\"Great Flood\\" of 1948 which flooded over 13,000 acres of land in adjacent lowland areas, twelve square miles of which were on Hatzic Prairie. Because of historical issues with flooding, extensive studies have been completed regarding potential floodwater impact on lower-lying Fraser Valley communities. These studies have focussed in particular on Hatzic Prairie, where much of the terrain is lower than 20 meters above sea level, being for the most part drained by Legace Creek, which additionally drains Pattison Creek. These studies include the following publications: * The \\"Hatzic Prairie Drainage Study\\" of August 1992, whose purpose, stated at p123, was to \\"develop a comprehensive plan to reduce flood damages and channel instability.\\" * The \\"Flood Damage Recovery Plan, Legace Creek, Hatzic Valley Draft Report\\" of June 2005, prepared by Northwest Hydraulic Consultants, which examined drainage of Hatzic Valley via Legace Creek, and proposed, per page i, \\"gravel removal, channel recontouring, bank protection and sediment traps\\" to mitigate the likelihood of overbank flooding and ensuing property damage. The costs of dredging and associated work were put at just over $1M, and the report advised on page ii that any such work undertaken may be overwhelmed by \\"the chronic occurrence of high-energy debris flood or debris flow events that regularly introduce vast quantities of sediment to the channel.\\" Since the above reports were published, The Fraser Basin Council has embarked on authoring a multi-phase Lower Mainland Flood Management Strategy (LMFMS), the first phase of which completed in 2016, being focussed on \\"BC Lower Mainland flood scenarios, a regional assessment of flood vulnerabilities and a review of flood protection works and practices in the region.\\" In commenting on the maps published under Phase 1 of the LMFMS, The Hope Standard observed that \\"the deepest floodwaters would swamp the north and east of Hatzic Lake, in and around Dewdney and Deroche on the north side of the Fraser River, and the Glen Valley in northwest Abbotsford and northeast Langley, where many areas could see flood waters rise three metres or more above ground.\\" The second phase of the LMFMS program consists of multiple projects, and has the purpose of \\"developing a long-term strategy\\", having an expected completion date of late 2020/ early 2021. Water There are three known aquifers in the Hatzic Valley area * The \\"Hatzic Prairie Aquifer\\", the southmost and shallowest aquifer in the Hatzic Valley, * The \\"Cascade Aquifer\\", the northmost aquifer in the valley, laying north of Cascade and south of Davis Creeks, * The \\"McConnell Aquifer\\", also described in some of the following references as \\"Miracle Valley Aquifer\\", an aquifer between the above two aquifers in the Hatzic Valley. The Hatzic Prairie and Cascade aquifers are described as \\"highly vulnerable\\" because of high levels of soil permeability, readily allowing contaminants into the aquifer. The McConnell Aquifer is described as having \\"low vulnerability because the aquifer is capped with relatively impermeable sediments, which prevent contaminants from entering the aquifer.\\" However Tom Millard, geomorphologist, indicates in his 2013 paper titled \\"Hatzic Region Hydrology and Watershed Stability Assessment\\" that the low vulnerability aquifer may not replenish as readily as the others because of its permeability. Many of the residents in Hatzic Valley have wells directly connecting to one of the three abovenamed aquifers. Additionally, the FVRD supplies water south of Durieu Road via various wells, pumps, reservoirs and pipelines. Groundwater in the Hatzic Prairie community is an ongoing concern on account of the heightened water table relative to ground level and resulting potential contamination of fresh water by farms and septic systems, especially given the vulnerability of the aquifer as described above. Expansion of the current FVRD supply system is an ongoing concern, with a number of studies and academic publications probing sustainability and hydrogeological issues. These include a 2011 study by Thomas D'Hoore of UBC on behalf of various Hatzic Valley Ratepayer Associations and 2012 (Miracle Valley Aquifer paper), 2014 (Well viability paper with regard to the Hatzic Prairie and Miracle Valley Aquifers), and 2017 (Construction and testing of a named production well in the valley) publications by Piteau Associates on behalf of the District of Mission and the FVRD.

He later served on the United Nations Conciliation Commission as its chairman. Early life and education Born in Providence, Rhode Island, on November 29, 1887, Palmer studied at Brown University, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1907; and at George Washington University, which awarded him a master's in diplomacy in 1909 (which, as he would later note, is no longer awarded). Palmer later studied at the University of Paris. Career In December 1910, Palmer joined the United States consular service as a consular assistant, and was later posted to Mexico City and Bucharest. With the establishment of the United States Foreign Service in 1924, pursuant to the Rogers Act, Palmer became one of the original class of foreign service officers; he was thereafter sent to Madrid, Paris, Jerusalem, and Sydney. From Sydney, Palmer was posted to Afghanistan, in 1945. He proceeded to serve as the United States minister to Afghanistan, from 1945 to 1948; thus, upon the elevation of the legation to an embassy, he became the first United States Ambassador to Afghanistan, which lasted for a few months. Like President Harry S. Truman, who nominated him, Palmer found Afghanistan to be \\"a fascinating country\\". His successor, Louis G. Dreyfus, took office in 1949. Following his time in Afghanistan, Palmer succeeded Paul A. Porter as the representative of the United States on the United Nations Conciliation Commission, in October 1949. After President Harry S. Truman approved his appointment in November, Palmer began to work within the week. During the course of his appointment, Palmer met with diplomats and stakeholders to try to find a solution for the Arab-Israeli conflict. He also served as the chairman of the commission, starting in January 1950. Amidst a diplomatic impasse, he had to convince French diplomat Claude Br√©art de Boisanger in matters regarding remuneration for Palestinian refugees, a position rejected by Dean Acheson; ultimately, even the study of possible compensation was tabled in fanciful hopes of more negotiation. However, Palmer considered the question of compensation to be the most pressing matter, and many of his actions as chairman would attempt to resolve this issue. Nonetheless, it became clear to both the Israelis and the Arab League, (as James Grover McDonald noted), that the Commission was rather ineffective, and disliked by both sides. Despite the warnings of John Blandford Jr., a conference in Paris was organized in an attempt to facilitate peace negotiations and to investigate the possibility of compensation. Held from September 1951 to November 1951, it failed to produce any progress, in either monies or peace. Lacking support from his superiors, Palmer's term as the American representative on the Commission proved to be rather ineffectual; and his work proved to be for naught. Under the Foreign Service Act of 1946, career diplomats of certain prominence could retire, but only at the rank of Career Minister. So, Palmer retired from the Foreign Service, at the rank of Career Minister, on July 31, 1952. At that point, he went to live on his ranch in California. Personal life Palmer married Mrs. Eno Ham Johnson, in Paris, June 1913; His Canadian-born wife would follow him from posting to posting. She predeceased him in 1961. Their son George went into the Foreign Service as well: George Palmer served in Spain, Panama, Canada, and Mexico. George also predeceased Palmer, in 1976. Both before and after retiring, Palmer was known for his acquaintance with Eugene Ormandy. Throughout his career, he collected autographs.

Biography  He was born to a wealthy family. His father, Sante, was originally from Bergamo and had moved to Chieti to be a grain merchant. His sister, Caterina, was married to Baron Ludovico de Pizzis of Ortona; known for his numerous feuds. His earliest art lessons may have come from Domenico Carpinoni in the 1620s.Brief biography @ Lib-Art Spinelli established himself throughout Abruzzo, At the there is a Coronation of Mary, done around 1630. He also painted at churches in Chieti and Penne. After 1630, he moved to Naples, where he worked with Massimo Stanzione and Battistello Caracciolo. He is believed to have been the latter's last student. Both of them had a great influence on his compositional style. His is also known to have been an avid collector of prints from Northern Europe; including Lucas van Leyden, Hendrik Goltzius, Jacob Matham and Heinrich Aldegrever. Their influence is often obvious, especially in his mythological and historical portraits. In recent years, his works have been studied by many art historians, including Roberto Longhi, and his reputation has been somewhat rehabilitated. He has been especially praised for the physical and physiognomic characteristics of his figures. Many of his works can be found at Castellammare di Stabia and in private collections in Naples. Other works are at the Uffizi gallery and an \\"Adoration of the Shepherds\\" is in the collection of the National Gallery in London. His individual canvases are difficult to date and of uneven quality; having been painted to the specifications of private clients. According to his biographer, Bernardo De Dominici, Spinelli gave up painting for alchemy and died while conducting an experiment in 1647, at the approximate age of fifty.

Because of the large volume of Red River Cart traffic, the ruts created during this period are still visible today. The historical significance of this resulted in The Battleford Trail becoming a provincial heritage site in 1982.  History  * First Nations Era - In pre-contact times, First Nations likely used the trail's general route as a way of travelling between wintering areas to the north of Battleford and the rich summer bison hunting grounds around Swift Current. * M√©tis Era - The Trail was used by the M√©tis in the earliest days when they roamed across the prairie hunting buffalo buffalo. When the railway finally arrived in Swift Current in early 1883, the entrepreneurial M√©tis began hauling freight and mail along the trail overland to Battleford. Prior to that, goods were hauled overland to Battleford from Winnipeg. Soon after, settlers, merchants, traders and even government officials followed the Metis lead and began using the trail. The route was in such demand that a stagecoach was established to transport people, freight and mail between the two points. * Railway Era - Fort Battleford was the seat of the Northwest Territories Government when the Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in Swift Current in 1883. As Swift Current was the closest railway head to Battleford, it became Battleford's primary trade and communication link to the outside world and remained so until 1891. An official survey and mapping of the trail was undertaken by R.C. Laurie in 1886. * Northwest Rebellion Era - During the Northwest Rebellion of 1885, Colonel William D. Otter, his troops, and around 50 Northwest Mounted Police officers traveled the route on the march from Swift Current to Battleford to confront Louis Riel‚Äôs forces. The NWMP patrolled the trail from Swift Current to the Battlefords to ensure that military supplies arrived safely at their destination. They provided security for the 500 troops as well as the 200 civilian teamsters who were contracted to haul the supplies. Starting in 1886 the police presence in the area was reduced in numbers, however police continued patrols to provide general security, enforce laws, and assist settlers. For several years, the trail was well-trafficked with people, freight and mail all using the route. * Era of Decline - The trail was only active for about 7 years as a result of the construction of a railway between Regina and Prince Albert via Saskatoon in 1890. This made Saskatoon the closet railway to Battleford and signalled the end of the Swift Current - Battlefords Trail. The trail remained in use for local travel as late as 1925.  Important Sites on the Trail  Sixty Mile Bush Outpost - Sixty Mile Bush Outpost was an important rest stop on the Swift Current-Battleford Trail. It was located close to the current town of Biggar, Saskatchewan on Township 34 Range 15 West of the 3rd Meridian. It was named sixty mile bush as a result of being about sixty miles south of Battleford. It served as a NWMP post and a way station for travellers and the stagecoach. Half-way houses were established about every forty miles along the trail to supply the stage coaches with a fresh set of four horses. They were stocked with food and provisions for the winter months for stage coach stopovers and a rest stop for passengers. In 1910 a few Metis were ranching in the area at which time a Catholic mission was established. Settlers began arriving in the area around 1906 and began laying claims to homesteads. The Sixty Mile Bush Outpost Monument, erected to commemorate the post reads; \\"This was the site of the sixty mile bush outpost. A stopping place on the Swift Current-Battleford Trail. A log house provided lodging over the trail. Two NWMP were stationed here from 1886 to 1889. The house later became a store for the settlers. A Roman Catholic Church was built at the site in 1906. The settlement disbanded about 1911 after the Grand Trunk Pacific Railroad and the town of Biggar were established.\\" Battleford Trail Wheel Rut Area - The Battleford Trail Wheel Rut Area is located in the city of Swift Current. It consists of a small plot of native grass prairie that contains two deep and parallel Red River Cart and wagon wheel ruts.

He was a leader in the failed Siege of Diu. Zufar was an experienced merchant with the distant markets of the Arabian Gulf around the Strait of Mecca and Lepanto at the Mediterranean.  Name  For centuries, his name has been given in different forms, depending on whether the writer is English, an Ottoman Turk, or Portuguese. These include Khoja Zufar, Coje √áafar, Coge Sofar, Cogeatar, and Khojah Zaffar. Muhammad III of Gujarat had forced him to change his Christian name to \\"Khwaja\\". He was later known as Khudawand Khan Safar Salmani.  Early life Zufar was born in Otranto, into an Albanian family. His mother was from Brindisi. He was born to Catholic Albanian parents in Otranto in the Kingdom of Naples in modern-day Italy. He began his career as a military adventurer, serving in the armies of Italy and Flanders, and was captured at sea at the age of fifteen by an Ottoman general Selim I, and the Ottoman sultan was impressed by the young Zufar and sent him to Constantinople where he was put in command of several vessels to attack the Portuguese. He was then sent to Cambaya (Khambhat) where he became good friends with King Bahadur Shah of Gujarat.Alexander Chalmers, 1810, p. 565 He was also the captain of the king. Around 1527, Khoja Zufar took refugee in Diu, where he was met with great respect, and with him he had 300 000 \\"cruzados\\" and 600 Turkish soldiers. \\"Portuguese drawing of Khoja Zufar (Coge Cofar) from 1798\\"  War with the Portuguese  In February 1531, Khoja Zufar and Ottoman Admiral Mustafa entered the harbor of Diu, a Portuguese island fortress on the coast of the Gujarat Sultanate in what is now Western India. In 1532, Zufar established himself in Gujarat, and obtained privileges in Surat and Diu, becoming the general of the Muslim forces. Here he was known as \\"Khoja Sofar of Surat\\". He initially cooperated with the Portuguese who put him in charge of Diu, but when he heard of Hadƒ±m Suleiman Pasha's naval expedition, he betrayed the Portuguese and joined Suleiman. Among the sailors of Suleiman were many of Venetian origin. Prior to Zufars change of allies, he had been very offended by Suleiman Pashas arrogance.  Zufar meeting Nuno da Cunha and Antonio da Silveira  On February 1537, When Bahadur Shah of Gujarat was killed on his ship by the Portguese, led by Nuno da Cunha, Zufar abandoned ship and swam ashore where he was well met by the Portuguese, who massacred the rest of Bahadurs crew. Cunha was so impressed by Zufar that he recommended him to Portuguese commander Antonio da Silveira de Menezes. Khoja then fled to King Mahmud of Cambaya, where Khoja was instructed to once again fight the Portuguese, with the help of the Ottoman fleet which was on its way. Khoja then appeared in front of the city of Rums, near Diu, where he was wounded in the arm. Zufar was aided by the local kings which resulted in Silveira ordering his men to abandon the town and instead fortify the port. When the Ottoman fleet arrived, Silveira sent letter to Nunho asking for help.  Suleiman Pasha's fleet  In 1537, the Portuguese sent a fleet to attack Diu, which was defended by Zufar's land forces. Suleiman witnessed the preparations: In 1537, Sultan Bahadur and Khoja Zufar agreed to meet with the Portuguese governor Nuno da Cunha in Diu, on his ship and despite being warned, Bahadur was murdered and his body thrown into the ocean, while Zufar barely escaped onto the ship of Antonio de Soto-Maior. Determined to avenge himself, Zufar wrote to his relative Nacoda Hamede, the ruler of Zebit, to send the Ottoman army to India, to which the Sultan approved.Portuguese and the Sultanate of Gujarat, 1500-1573, Kuzhippalli Skaria Mathew, p. 44-46, According to Portuguese author Lu√≠s Vaz Cam√µes letters published in 1776, Zufar and Nunio had been serving together in service of the Portuguese, but Zufar, with a party of locals of Cambaya, switched side and joined Hadim Suleiman Pasha. In April 1538, Zufar, having received news of the Portuguese fleet preparing for war, secretly sent his wife and children to safety. He then presented himself before the new sultan, Mahmud III, who made him governor of Surat with the title of Khudawand Khan. Zufar then made an attack on the outer fort of Diu, driving the Portuguese into the city, and initiating the Siege of Diu which was made possible thanks to Zufar's close friend Ruy Freire, a Portuguese who collected information. In June 1538, Zufar was wounded by the Portuguese, and attacked again on June 26 with 4,000 men outside the village of Rome. Throughout his reign as a governor, Zufar had urged the Muslim leader of Gujarat to expel the Portuguese, who had taken possession of Surat Port and robbed the city at the beginning of the century. The following quote is attributed to him, as part of a speech to his men about the Portuguese: Delayed by other conflicts, Suleiman arrived with a fleet of 72 vessels, and told his men of a certain \\"Cosazaffer who originally came from Otranto and was a renegade for Islam\\". In 1540, to resist the attacks of the Portuguese, Zufar constructed a strong, high, and large fort in the place of the small old fort. The Portuguese protested against the decision. Zufar had a personal relationship with Garcia de Orta as he would receive gifts of curcas (cataputia minor), from Zufar. In 1542, a ship filled with 60,000 pieces of Venetian gold was sent to Zufar, to prepare for the incoming fleet. In 1545, Zufar attempted another siege of Diu and failed. In 1546, Zufar complained that his merchant vessels were harassed by the Portuguese cartaz which resulted in skirmishes with the Portuguese fleets. The Sultan, determined to retake Diu, applied for support from Indo-Islamic states. In 1546, Zufar fortified his base at Surat and persuaded the sultan of Gujarat to once again attack Diu. In March, 1546, Zufar appeared in front of Diu with 7,000 \\"guzatteres\\" and 1,000 Turks in order to take it from the Portuguese.Saturnino Monteiro (2010): Portuguese Sea Battles - Volume I - The First World Sea Power 1139-1521 p.223 Their leader, Dom Joao Mascarenhas, defended the city as did his predecessor Antonio da Silveira. Portuguese women participated in the defence as well. The sieges failed and Suleiman departed on November 5\\\\. Zufar then set fire to his encampment and abandoned the island of Diu. According to Diogo do Cuoto, the keeper of the Portuguese Record Office in Goa, through out the 1540s, Zufar received letters every year from his mother, a Catholic, who was much upset that Zufar had converted to Islam.  International writings  C. K. Goertz wrote that \\"Safar Salmani was a man of genius and determination, circumspection and foresight, and it was upon these qualities that he advances to Bahadur Shah's inner circle. Later, Pope Julius III would consider him sufficiently important to mention him in his bull \\"pracclara charissimi\\" of December 30, 1551.  Death  Before his death, Zufar had a wakil, a servant, named Bahar Khan Yagut Salmani, an Ottoman slave, who also accompanied him during the Siege of Diu. On June 24, 1546, while supervising the trenches, Zufar's head was taken off by a cannonball fired from the Portuguese in the fort of Diu. One of Zufar's men, Bilal Khairit Khani Habashi, was killed as well.https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/144517428.pdf, p. 159 His son, Ramazan Rumi Khan, inherited the title and ruled Surat in 1554.

After Malawi's independence, he became a member of the Malawi parliament and an advocate of the authoritarian and centralising policies of its first President, Hastings Banda. He was rewarded with posts as a junior minister and in Malawi‚Äôs diplomatic service, but retired from politics in 1969, spending the rest of his life in relative obscurity. Musopole was born in the Northern Province of what was then Nyasaland. He went to South Africa as a labour migrant in the 1940s, and became radicalised there, forging links to the South African Communist Party. He returned to Nyasaland in 1955 and began a campaign against colonialism and the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland that capitalised on existing popular discontent with colonial agricultural measures, developing a radical, peasant-based anti-government movement in the north of the country. Musopole promoted mass membership of the Nyasaland African Congress throughout the Northern Province and organised boycotts of the agricultural regulations. In February 1959, he led a campaign designed to paralyse colonial rule in Northern Province through unauthorised demonstrations and clashes with police. These disturbances were one of the triggers for the declaration of a State of emergency in March 1959, which led to the arrest and imprisonment of most Nyasaland African Congress leaders. However, Musopole and a number of his followers evaded arrest and conducted an armed campaign against the security forces until his capture in Tanganyika (territory) in August 1959. He was convicted of sedition and imprisoned for two years. After his release from prison, he was elected to the Malawi Parliament in 1964. At the time of the Cabinet Crisis of 1964 in Malawi, he supported President Hastings Banda against the ministers, many from the Northern Region, who sought to restrict Banda‚Äôs power. He was subsequently appointed as a junior minister and, in 1967, was assigned to the Malawian mission to the United Nations. After two years, Musopole was sent to the Malawi Labour Office in Botswana and soon after, he returned to Malawi, left politics and became a businessman in his home district of Chitipa. Early life and education Much of Flax Musopole‚Äôs early life is obscure and is known only through his own or his relatives‚Äô later accounts.McCracken (2002), p. 78 He was born in the Misuku Hills area of Chitipa District, Malawi, which was then part of the Karonga District of Nyasaland in 1918 and attended local elementary schools and then a Senior Primary school run by the Church of Scotland on the Karonga lakeshore.Kalinga (2012), p. 330 He may also have attended a senior school at the Livingstonia MissionMcCracken (2002), p. 78 Musopole‚Äôs activities before he migrated to South Africa in the 1940s are unclear, but in South Africa he worked as a clerk in several businesses in the Johannesburg area and passed the South Africa university matriculation examinations through correspondence study.Kalinga (2010), p. 750Kalinga (2012), pp. 329-30 This qualified him to enter the University of Cape Town in 1952 and he either entered the university in that year, leaving without graduating two years later,Kalinga (2010), p. 750 or interacted with students at the universities of Cape Town and Witwatersrand without matriculating in either.McCracken (2002), p. 78 During his time in South Africa, Musopole became an atheist and a strong advocate of anti-colonialism, becoming involved in the Defiance Campaign there, and forming links to the South African Communist Party (SACP). Although he returned to Nyasaland in 1955, Musopole maintained links with the SACP, which in 1957 sponsored him for a scholarship the Moscow State University, which he did not take up.McCracken (2002), p. 78 Opposing the colonial government In 1954, there were less than 1,000 paid- up members of the Nyasaland African Congress, which had been founded in 1944. The membership consisted mainly of clerks and businessmen based in the south of the protectorate and prosperous tobacco-growers from the Central Province. Northern branches were few and Congress did not seek mass membership. The growth of Congress from a moribund talking-shop in 1955, when Musopole returned to Nyasaland, to a dynamic mass party in 1959 was less through the activities of educated members in the south than expansion through the recruitment of peasants in Nyasaland's north. Musopole was central to this growth, which resulted in 48 out of Nyasaland‚Äôs 63 Congress branches being in the Northern Province by 1959, even though this was the least populous of the three provinces.McCracken (2002), pp. 71-2 Musopole was described by the Nyasaland police in 1957 as ‚Äòa known Communist sympathiser‚Äô. He was later joined in the Northern Province by Gilbert Kumtumanje, who had lived in Southern Rhodesia for ten years and had been President of the Mashonaland Province branch of the Nyasaland Congress before his expulsion from Southern Rhodesia in December 1957. Kumtumanje and Musopole were supported by the younger Kanyama Chiume and R. R. Chumia, and these four reinvigorated Congress throughout the Northern Province, opening new branches and building up a substantial following in the towns along Lake Malawi. Chiume, Musopole and Chumia were described by the police as ‚Äòthe main driving force‚Äô behind Congress in the Northern Province.Groves (2013), p. 164 Musopole and his associates were able to find many supporters because peasant farmers in the north were adversely affected by colonial agricultural and land conservation policies. Firstly, government agricultural officers targeted a local system of cultivating millet that involved cutting down and burning trees and planting millet in the wood ash. As the millet was mainly used to brew beer, it was widely condemned by administrators and agricultural officers in the north as both morally and environmentally destructive. From 1938, a comprehensive soil conservation scheme, the Misuku Land Usage Scheme, was introduced in the Misuku Hills in the extreme north of the Northern Province. This scheme involved attempts to stop deforestation, to promote the growing of coffee, to restrict the growing of millet and to reduce the numbers of cattle and the extent of grazing land for them. Soil erosion on hilly areas was to be countered by the construction of contour ridges, which took significant amounts of land out of cultivation and involved onerous and unpaid work by the local people to create them.McCracken (2002), pp. 73-4 Contour ridging was not applied on the flat Karonga Lakeshore, but owners of the many cattle there had to register their animals and take them to government cattle dipping tanks regularly.Kalinga (2010), p. 747 The opposition of peasants was at first unorganised and passive, and included some farmers fleeing across the nearby borders of Tanganyika and Northern Rhodesia. It was nevertheless reasonably successful in many areas of the Northern Province, because the colonial authorities had too few agricultural officers and police to enforce conservation rules, and local courts were unwilling to punish defaulters, so the regulations were largely ignoredMcCracken (2002), pp. 74-6 Once Musopole returned to the province, he organised demonstrations, strikes and boycotts as part of a scheme of more active opposition to the agricultural rules, in particular those relating to coffee growing in the Misuku Hills and the compulsory cattle dipping in Karonga, and he promoted the traditional method of cultivating millet that involved burning trees.McCracken (2002), pp. 73-4 State of Emergency In January 1959, the governor of Nyasaland, Sir Robert Armitage, after consulting Alan Lennox-Boyd, the Colonial Secretary, rejected the proposals of the Nyasaland African Congress for constitutional change that would have led to an African majority in the Nyasaland legislature, and he suspended constitutional talks with CongressMcCracken (2012), pp. 346-8. In view of this apparent stalemate, Kanyama Chiume was one of the Congress leaders that led demands for the party to escalate its campaign of anti- government protests and disobedience. He proposed action involving unauthorised demonstrations which would lead to arrests, followed by protests in favour of those arrested, and the intimidation of police and government workers in a cycle designed to cause chaos. Musopole, Chiume, Kumtumanje and Chumia orchestrated an outbreak of violent protest in the Northern Province that brought colonial rule there to a standstill. Rioting began on 8 February when police tried to stop meetings called by Congress leaders without official sanction. Karonga town was taken over by a crowd of about 600 demonstrators on 19 February and the Fort Hill aerodrome, from where the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association flew mineworkers to South Africa, was occupied the next day. In the same month, Musopole directed attacks that damaged mission properties at Livingstonia, Ekwendeni and Loudon, during which some African teachers were beaten and others fled.Kalinga (2010), p. 752McCracken (2002), p. 79 Despite this violence and the deteriorating security situation, the Nyasaland government continued to negotiate with Banda and other Congress leaders until late February 1959, but the governor then decided against offering any concessions. He made preparations for mass arrests of Congress leaders and declared a State of Emergency on 3 March 1959.McCracken (2012), pp. 350-2. Operation Sunrise, the police and military campaign to arrest and detain Congress leaders immediately after the emergency was declared, involved mass arrests of those individuals identified as Congress leaders or advocates of violence. Most of those scheduled for arrest in the Karonga and Chitipa districts were apprehended on 3 March, and armed police shot dead two demonstrators who were trying to secure their release in Karonga town on the same day.Kalinga (2010), pp. 744, 754 Musopole was able to evade arrest and immediately began organising the sabotage of conservation projects and road bridges, the destruction of government buildings and the intimidation of government workers. He and his armed followers travelling widely over the Northern Province, unhindered at first by the limited security force presence in the area.McCracken (2002), p. 78 In the Misuku Hills, property belonging to two missions was also destroyedKalinga (2010), p. 754 Once the Southern Province was brought fully under control in April 1959, military forces from Southern Rhodesia were sent to the north as part of Operation Crewcut, which was specifically aimed at capturing Musopole and more generally at ending support for Congress in the north. This operation proved abortive, as almost a fortnight of intensive patrolling left Musopole and his followers at liberty in the Misuku hills or in neighbouring Tanganyika. Operation Crewcut ended in October 1959, by which time over a thousand suspected members of Congress had been convicted of criminal offences, collective fines had been imposed on several areas, many homes and much other property had been destroyed and large numbers of Africans had been physically abused by the troops involved.McCracken (2012), pp. 355‚Äì6. The Devlin Commission later upheld complaints about frequent house burnings, arbitrary fines and bullying behaviour, all of which it considered to be illegal and excessive.McCracken (2012), pp. 356, 358‚Äì9. The violent and destructive activities of Musopole and his supporters and their intimidation of those that wished to remain neutral alienated some, but were seen as legitimate opposition to the colonial government by many local Congress supporters. Musopole was finally arrested in Tanganyika in August 1959.McCracken (2002), pp. 79-80 He was returned to Nyasaland and charged with sedition, being defended at his trial by the eminent British lawyer and Labour Party politician Dingle Foot. After conviction, he served two and a half years in prison and was released in March 1962.McCracken (2002), p. 81 Malawi politician As he was in prison, Musopole had little contact with his political base in Chitipa or with the Malawi Congress Party, formed in 1959 to replace the banned Nyasaland African Congress, which was less strong in the Northern Province than in the centre and south of the country. By the time of his release in 1962, he had little choice but to join the dominant new party, which found him a position as clerk of the Karonga District council.McCracken (2002), p. 81. As he was a prisoner at the time, Musopole had been ineligible to stand in the 1961 Legislative Council election but, on his release, he was nominated to the Malawi Congress Party‚Äôs candidate for the newly created Karonga West (later, Chitipa) constituency. He was elected in the pre-independence election of 1964 as the constituency's first Member of parliament.Kalinga (2002), p. 81 Shortly after his election Musopole became involved in the Cabinet Crisis of September 1964. As every Member of parliament was required to speak in the emergency debate that followed the dismissal of three cabinet ministers and the resignation of four more in sympathy with them, neutrality was impossible. Although Musopole acknowledged that these ministers, in particular Kanyama Chiume, were his friends, he pledged loyalty to Banda. He was rewarded by being appointed as Parliamentary secretary in the Ministry of Community Development in October 1964.Kalinga (2012), p. 330McCracken (2002), pp. 85-6 McCracken has suggested that Musopole‚Äôs apparent unquestioning support for Banda could be an honest conviction reflecting authoritarian attitudes that he had adopted as the result of his exposure to Communist ideology, rather than to the liberal views accepted by the ministers who had completed their university education and had not had contact with Communist parties or sympathisers.McCracken (2002), p. 87 Later life In 1967, Musopole was assigned to the Malawian mission to the United Nations but, after two years, he was sent to the Malawi Labour Office in Botswana, an apparent demotion. Within a short time, he left politics and diplomacy and returned to Chitipa where he became a businessman. There is very little information about his final two decades.Kalinga (2012), p. 330 Flax Katoba Musopole died in Chitipa in 1989.Kalinga (2012), p. 330 References Sources *Groves, Zoe (2013) 'Transnational Migration and Pan-African Solidarity: the case of the Central African Federation, 1953-1963' African Studies', Vol. 72, No2, pp. 155‚Äì75. *Kalinga, Owen (2010).

Sopi describes the suffering and the exile of Catholic Albanians in Karadak (modern day Letnice in Gjilan) who in the years of 1845 publicly declared their Christian faith. The Albanian Maliq Beg of Gjilani then ordered for their arrest where 30 members were sent to Skopje and then to Istanbul where they remained in prisons for months. Later they were deported to a swamp region in Anatolia, Turkey, where half of them died. In 1848, survivors returned where they once again were persecuted.

He also did some portraits.  Biography  He was born to a family of painters. In addition to his father Richard (who was also an architect), his grandfather Pierre, granduncle Adrien and cousin Daniel of Chaumont were all painters. His mother, Marguerite (n√©e Louys), was the daughter of a goldsmith. He probably received most of his training in the family workshop. Later, he travelled to Rome where, in 1634, he is listed in the register of the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo. It is also known that he made a copy of \\"The Transfiguration\\" by Raphael.Collections du mus√©e des beaux-arts de Dijon - Affichage d'une notice . It is unknown which living Italian painters he may have been in contact with although, judging from his use of lighting effects, he was probably influenced by the recently deceased Caravaggio. Documents from 1636 indicate that he was in Avignon. He was back in Langres in 1647, when he married Simone Contet. He spent the remained of his life there and held some municipal offices. Despite his rural location, he kept track of artistic developments in Paris and shows some influence from the works of Simon Vouet and Laurent de La Hyre. A traditional story has it that Charles Le Brun invited him to Paris to assist in creating decorations commissioned by King Louis XIV, but Tassel declined, preferring to stay in Langres. Like his father, his workshop took orders from the entire province. Customers in Dijon were especially numerous, as evidenced by the number of his paintings seized from religious communities there during the Revolution. Of particular note are a series of works made for the Ursuline convent, under the direction of Catherine de Montholon (1568-1650). Most of these are now in the Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Dijon.

Life He was born in 1745; William Thomas Parke, also an oboist, was his younger brother. John Parke studied the oboe under Simpson, and musical theory under Charles Frederick Baumgarten. In 1768 he was appointed principal oboe at the King's Theatre; in the same year he played at the first Birmingham festival, and also at the Three Choirs Festival in Hereford. He continued to perform at the Three Choirs Festivals for thirty- five years. In 1768 Johann Christian Fischer, an oboist from Dresden, first came to London: his performances stimulated Parke to greater ambition, and he improved his style; two years later he succeeded Fischer as concerto player at Vauxhall Gardens. In 1771 he accepted an offer from David Garrick to become first oboe at Drury Lane Theatre. He was also engaged by John Christopher Smith and John Stanley as a principal at the Lenten oratorios, and in the summer he played at Ranelagh Gardens and Vauxhall Gardens. The Duke of Cumberland took Parke into his band, led by Baumgarten, in 1783, and the Prince of Wales employed him at his Carlton House concerts, with a salary of ¬£100. He was a prominent performer at the Concerts of Antient Music, the Professional Concerts, and other concerts. He composed some oboe concertos, but did not publish them. In 1815, at the age of seventy, he retired. Falling into debt, he was imprisoned in the Marshalsea in 1823. He died in London on 2 August 1829, and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields.

The club selected Fowler with pick 70; she was expected to play as a key forward and ruckwoman assisting Eliza Hynes, because of her 180-centimetre stature.

Osterholm and writer Mark Olshaker, that explores public health emergencies including antimicrobial resistance, emerging infectious disease, and the threat of an influenza pandemic. It proposes a nine-point \\"battle plan for survival\\" for dealing with these threats, including solutions to antimicrobial drug resistance. The book also focuses on the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), toxic shock syndrome, Zika, Ebola, bioterrorism, influenza research, and the antivaccine movement. The book was first published in March 2017 by Little, Brown and Company.  Synopsis  Osterholm describes his book as \\"part history, part current affairs, and part blueprint for the future\\". Top of his concerns are influenza pandemics, antibiotic resistance and bioterrorism, combined with \\"no clear international governance structure for how we are going to deal with these issues\\". Focusing on major infectious diseases, he highlights the world's vulnerability to their emerging threats. His concerns include the effects of major outbreaks on medicine and vaccine production, should countries where these are produced be affected. Content includes a chapter on coronaviruses titled \\"SARS and MERS: Harbingers of Things to Come\\". Other chapters are on the HIV/AIDS, toxic shock syndrome, the 2015‚Äì16 Zika virus epidemic, and Ebola outbreaks, covering all the main outbreaks over the previous 30 years, including influenza bioterrorism, gain-of-function influenza research, the antivaccine movement, and antimicrobial resistance. The concept of \\"game-changing influenza vaccines\\" is introduced in the chapter \\"Taking influenza off the table\\". This provides reasoning and mechanisms for developing vaccines. Solutions to antimicrobial drug resistance are suggested in the chapter titled \\"Fighting the resistance\\". The authors divide infectious diseases into four classes: pathogens that have the potential to cause pandemics; pathogens important to particular regions; endemic diseases; and bioterrorism, dual-use research of concern, and concerns over gain-of-function research, where modifying pathogens in the laboratory might potentially be misused. The book contains personal experiences, including Osterholm's La Crosse encephalitis, and it uses medical history to assess the threat of pandemics and anti-microbial resistance, while also discussing political responses. The authors propose a nine-point \\"Battle Plan for Survival\\" to fight emerging threats, with the aim of informing and inspiring people into public health work. Reception The book was described by Richard Preston as a \\"powerful and necessary book\\" that \\"offers us not just fear but plans\\". John M. Barry described the book as Osterholm's way of getting results. Frank Weimann described the book's \\"dismal introduction on the threat of epidemics\\" and the main content as \\"a disturbing description of what humans are doing to keep\\" epidemiologists in business. Weimann is convinced by Osterholm's call for planning, research, and funding. Excerpts from the book appeared in Wired and on MPR News. It was listed in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's best books of 2017.

Spiritualism Mathilda Nilsson was a high-profile within the spiritualistic society in Stockholm. She was one of the first members of the spiritualistic organisation \\"Spiritistiska Litteraturf√∂reningen\\" from its founding in 1877. Mathilda Nilsson was member of \\"Kl√∂verbladet\\" and one of the founders of the Edelweiss Society in Stockholm, founded in December 1888. She was a very active member of the Society, where she took notes of messages received from spirits, healed through laying on of hands and received messages from the dead. She left the Edelweiss Society in 1896. 1891 she became editor of the spiritualistic magazine \\"Efter√•t? Tidskrift f√∂r spiritism och d√§rmed besl√§gtade √§mnen\\" [Afterwards? Journal of Spiritualism and related topics],http://runeberg.org/lundstedt/2/0282.html which was the main publication for spiritualism in Sweden. The magazine was issued during the period 1891-1922 and had its editorial offices in her home at Kammakargatan. In 1904 Mathilda Nilsson became member of the Stockholm lodge of the Theosophical Society. Mathilda Nilsson was one of the five members of De Fem, a spiritualistisc group founded in 1896, and dissolved in 1907, with several of its members moving on to collaborate with Hilma af Klint for the Paintings for the Temple. The artists Hilma af Klint, Anna Cassel, Sigrid Hedman och Cornelia Cederberg (Mathilda Nilsson's sister) were the other four members. During group's s√©ances, spirit leaders presented themselves by name and promised to help the group's members in their spiritual training. The spirits communicating with the five women were mostly Gregor, Georg, Clemens, Ananda och Amaliel. Such leaders are common in spiritualist literature and life. Graphical drawings Through their spiritural guidance, Cornelia Cederberg, Hilma af Klint and Anna Cassel was inspired to draw automatically in pencil, a technique that was not unusual at that time. When the hand moved automatically, the conscious will did not direct the pattern that developed on the paper, and, in theory, the women thus became artistic tools for their spirit leaders. This technique, called automatism was used a decade later by the Surrealists. In a series of sketchbooks, religious scenes and symbols were depicted in drawings made by the group collectively. Their drawing technique developed in such a way that abstract patterns‚Äîdependent on the free movement of the hand‚Äîbecame visible.\\"Revolt, They Said\\". www.andreageyer.info.

She is one of the founders of the Ahoti ‚Äì for Women in Israel movement. Alon was on the editorial board of the literary journal \\"Criticism and Review\\", and was head of the Gender Studies program at Beit Berl College. In 2017, Alon received the Prime Minister's Prize for Hebrew Literary Works.  Biography  Alon was born in Jerusalem in 1971. She completed her undergraduate degree in art history and communications at the Hebrew University. Her MA focused on Jewish-Christian relations, and her PhD was in Hebrew literature. In her academic career, Alon teaches or has taught at the Open University, at Ben Gurion University, and was the head of the Gender Studies department at Beit Berl College. Alon is a founding activist of the Mizrahi feminist movement, which found its beginnings at the 10th Feminist Conference 1994, in Givat Haviva, at which a major confrontation between Mizrahi and Ashkenazi feminists led to a final rift in the feminist movement. Alon then participated in founding the Mizrahi movement, Ahoti ‚Äì for Women in Israel.  Writing  Alon's writing focuses on the concept of Mizrahim. She presents the social, cultural and political meanings of Mizrahi-ness through presentation of poetry, art and essays by Mizrahi Jews, which she analyzes and expands upon. She is particularly interested in the intersection of feminism and Mizrahi-ness, which is expounded in the book she wrote with Shula Keshet, Breaking Walls. In her research, Alon compares and contrasts the dichotomy of Ashkenazi/Mizrahi, in the past and present, with other socio-political dichotomies in Israel, such as Jews and Arabs, religious and secular, political left and right, rich and poor, men and women. Alon points out the way that the concept of the Mizrahi creates discomfort, because it undermines categories of identity such as Jews and Arabs, given that the Mizrahi is most often an Arab Jew. Alon says that she cannot accept the social polarization that has formed in Israeli society around Ashkenazi and Mizrahi identities, claiming that Mizrahi-ness refuses to remain at a defined and separate pole, much as she denied the attempt to separate men and women in this manner.  Select works  Alon has published ten books, and many articles: * ◊ê◊û◊†◊ï◊™ ◊î◊°◊ô◊û◊§◊ò◊ï◊ù: ◊ß◊®◊ô◊ê◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ô◊¶◊ô◊®◊ï◊™◊ô◊ï ◊©◊ú ◊ê◊î◊®◊ü ◊ê◊§◊ú◊§◊ú◊ì / ◊ô◊ï◊ó◊ê◊ô ◊ê◊ï◊§◊†◊î◊ô◊ô◊û◊®, ◊ß◊¶◊ô◊¢◊î ◊¢◊ú◊ï◊ü. ◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊™ ◊í◊û◊ê, 2014 ‚Äì Omanut ha-simp·π≠om : ·∏≥eri ºot bi-yetsirota·πø shel Aharon Apelfeld ; The art of symptoms : reading Aharon Appelfeld's fiction * ◊ê◊§◊©◊®◊ï◊™ ◊©◊ú◊ô◊©◊ô◊™ ◊ú◊©◊ô◊®◊î: ◊¢◊ô◊ï◊†◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊§◊ï◊ê◊ò◊ô◊ß◊î ◊û◊ñ◊®◊ó◊ô◊™ / ◊ß◊¶◊ô◊¢◊î ◊¢◊ú◊ï◊ü. ◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊™ ◊î◊ß◊ô◊ë◊ï◊• ◊î◊û◊ê◊ï◊ó◊ì, 2011 ‚Äì Efsharut shelishit le-shirah :  ªiyunim be-po ºe·π≠i·∏≥ah Mizra·∏•it * ◊©◊ï◊©◊†◊™ ◊î◊û◊®◊ô ◊î◊©◊ó◊ï◊®◊î: ◊ß◊®◊ô◊ê◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊©◊ô◊®◊î ◊û◊ñ◊®◊ó◊ô◊™ / ◊ß◊¶◊ô◊¢◊î ◊¢◊ú◊ï◊ü. ◊û◊©◊®◊ì ◊î◊ë◊ô◊ò◊ó◊ï◊ü ‚Äì ◊î◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊î ◊ú◊ê◊ï◊®, 2014 ‚Äì Shoshanat ha-meri ha-she·∏•orah : ·∏≥eri ºot be-shirah mizra·∏•it * ◊©◊ï◊ë◊®◊ï◊™ ◊ß◊ô◊®◊ï◊™: ◊ê◊û◊†◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊û◊ñ◊®◊ó◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊¢◊õ◊©◊ï◊ï◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú / ◊ß◊¶◊ô◊¢◊î ◊¢◊ú◊ï◊ü, ◊©◊ï◊ú◊î ◊ß◊©◊™. ◊ê◊®◊í◊ï◊ü ◊ê◊ó◊ï◊™◊ô, 2013 ‚Äì Shovrot ·∏≥irot : omaniyot Mizra·∏•iyot  ªakhsha·πøiyot be-Yi≈õra ºel * ◊ê◊†◊ê ◊û◊ü ◊ê◊ú◊û◊í◊®◊ë: ◊ß◊ï◊ë◊• ◊û◊ê◊û◊®◊ô◊ù ◊¢◊ú ◊î◊ô◊¶◊ô◊®◊î ◊î◊§◊ï◊ê◊ò◊ô◊™ ◊©◊ú ◊ê◊®◊ñ ◊ë◊ô◊ò◊ï◊ü / ◊ß◊¶◊ô◊¢◊î ◊¢◊ú◊ï◊ü, ◊ô◊ï◊ó◊ê◊ô ◊ê◊ï◊§◊†◊î◊ô◊ô◊û◊®. ◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊™ ◊í◊û◊ê ◊ï◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊™ ◊î◊ß◊ô◊ë◊ï◊• ◊î◊û◊ê◊ï◊ó◊ì, 2014 ‚Äì Ana min al-Magreb : ·∏≥eri ºot be-shirat Erez Bi·π≠on * ◊¢◊ì◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ô◊ï◊§◊ô ◊ï◊ó◊ï◊ß◊™ ◊î◊ñ◊û◊ü, ◊û◊ê◊û◊®◊ô◊ù ◊¢◊ú ◊ê◊û◊ô◊®◊î ◊î◊° / ◊ß◊¶◊ô◊¢◊î ◊¢◊ú◊ï◊ü. ◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊™ ◊í◊û◊ê, 2016 ‚Äì  ªEdut ha-yofi ·πøe-·∏•u·∏≥at ha-zeman :  ªal shiratah shel Amirah Hes: ma ºamrim ·πøe-si·∏•ot ; Testament of beauty and laws of time : discussing Amira Hess's poetry : essays and talks * ◊ê◊ï◊§- ◊§◊ï◊ò◊ï, ◊ê◊ï◊°◊£ ◊î◊¶◊ì ◊î◊ê◊ó◊ï◊®◊ô ◊©◊ú ◊î◊¶◊ô◊ú◊ï◊ù ◊î◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú◊ô / ◊ß◊¶◊ô◊¢◊î ◊¢◊ú◊ï◊ü. ◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊™ ◊í◊û◊ê, 2017 ‚Äì Op fo·π≠o : ha-tsad ha-a·∏•ori shel ha- tsilum ha-Yi≈õre ºeli ; Photo opp : The other side of Israeli photography * ◊ú◊©◊õ◊ï◊ü ◊ë◊™◊ï◊ö ◊û◊ô◊ú◊î: ◊î◊®◊î◊ï◊®◊ô◊ù ◊¢◊ú ◊ñ◊î◊ï◊™ ◊û◊ñ◊®◊ó◊ô◊™ / ◊ß◊¶◊ô◊¢◊î ◊¢◊ú◊ï◊ü. ◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊™ ◊í◊û◊ê, 2015 ‚Äì Li- shekhon be-tokh milah : hirhurim  ªal zehut mizra·∏•it ; To dwell in a word  References  Mizrahi feminists Israeli activists Israeli academics 1971 births Living people Recipients of Prime Minister's Prize for Hebrew Literary Works ","title":"Ketzia Alon"},{"id":"60434072","text":"Enorma is a genus of bacteria from the family of Coriobacteriaceae.

She was commonly referred to as \\"the Angel on the end of the line\\". Early life She was born Mona Lee Bruster on a farm in Madill, Oklahoma to farmer Floyd Bruster and Ada Roninson, one of eight children. She attended Kingston High School. In 1947 she met F.M. Brock, a farmer and they married on 12 July, the same year. They would farm together in Lincoln County, Oklahoma. In later life, she attended Southeastern State College where in 1964, she obtained a bachelor's degree in education. Further studies saw her obtain a master's degree in Education in 1967 from the University of Oklahoma. She became a teacher in the Moore Public School system, Oklahoma, a guidance counsellor and principal. Later life During the 1980s, American farming faced a crisis made of droughts, poor commodity prices, higher production costs, bad loans and a Russian embargo on grain. These factors left farmers struggling to survive and Mona Lee set out personally to try to save farms and farmers. She started by organising gatherings at her home in Lincoln County where local farmers could talk about how to survive. She would later bring together farmers, lawyers, businessmen and bankers as advocates for their cause. As suicides amongst farmers increased she started personally taking phone calls from them seven days a week at any hour. She or others would attempt to reach those farmers while they were kept on the line, sometimes with success and sometimes not. Willie Nelson came to hear about her, making contact with her and personally helped finance her causes. He would later go on to form Farm Aid which would raise over $50 million for aid. She was approached by the Oklahoma Conference of Churches who wanted to set up a suicide intervention hotline. She assisted them by moving her operation to Oklahoma City to help set up a state-wide hotline. Death She died in Durant, Oklahoma of congestive heart failure. Her husband died in 1986 and a son Gary in 2003. Honours In May 2018, she received a Citation from the Oklahoma House of Representatives for advocating on behalf of farmers in the state.

Read grew up in Dummerston, Vermont, in an impoverished farming household. He walked or hitchhiked daily to his high school and was the first high school graduate in his family. He enlisted in the United States Army during World War II, serving in Italy as a military policeman. Upon an honorable discharge from the military in 1945, Read returned to Brattleboro, Vermont, where he worked as a gas station attendant and mechanic for about 25 years. Read retired for one year and then took a part-time janitor job at J. C. Penney where he worked for 17 years, until 1997. Read died in 2014. He received media coverage in numerous newspapers and magazines after bequeathing US$1.2 million to Brooks Memorial Library and $4.8 million to Brattleboro Memorial Hospital. Read amassed a nearly $8 million fortune by investing in dividend-producing stocks, avoiding the stocks of companies he did not understand such as technology companies, living very frugally, and being a buy and hold investor in a diversified portfolio of stocks with a heavy concentration in blue chip companies. Early life and career Brattleboro High School yearbook Ronald James Read was born on October 23, 1921, to George and Florence Ray Read into an indigent family that managed a farm. He was raised in Dummerston, Vermont, in an extremely tiny house. To travel to high school, he daily walked and hitchhiked to Brattleboro. Read graduated from Brattleboro Union High School in 1940 and was the first high school graduate in his family. He had an older brother, Frank. During World War II, he enlisted in the United States Army and was deployed to North Africa, Italy, and the Pacific Ocean theater. In Italy, he worked as a military policeman. He reached the Army rank of technician fifth grade. Right before Christmas 1945, he finished his deployment, was honorably discharged, and traveled back to Brattleboro. Read worked for almost a quarter of a century as an attendant and mechanic at Haviland's Service Station, a gas station that he and his older brother, Fred, later purchased and then sold upon retiring. He retired in 1979, which lasted a year. He then worked part-time at J. C. Penney where he did custodial and maintenance work before retiring in 1997 after working there for 17 years. Personal life Read met his future wife, Barbara March, at Haviland's Service Station when she was a customer and he worked as a gas station attendant. March had two teenaged children including Phillip Brown who was in college when Read and March married in 1960. Read purchased for US$12,000 a house where he lived with his wife and stepchildren. He financed his stepchildren's college education. His wife died in 1970 of cancer and he did not remarry. Read's hobbies included wood chopping, stamp collecting, and coin collecting. He frequently drove his car to his family's homestead and stored firewood he chopped there, and looked for tree branches on the ground to use for the wood- burning stove at his house. Read frequently patronized Brattleboro Memorial Hospital's coffee shop to drink one cup of coffee and eat a breakfast of an English muffin with peanut butter. After the coffee place shuttered, he began to eat breakfast at Friendly's. Read met the hospital development director, who suggested he check out the library and helped him secure his first library card in 2007. He regularly visited the library to return a pile of books and check out another pile. Investing and frugality Reader's Digests Juliana LaBianca said Read was \\"a blue-collar guy with blue-chip smarts\\". The Wall Street Journal noted that his roughly $2,380 purchase of 39 Pacific Gas and Electric Company shares on January 13, 1959, grew to $10,735 by the time he died. Read bought many shares of The J.M. Smucker Company, CVS Health, and Johnson & Johnson and held for long-term several blue chip companies, including Procter & Gamble, JPMorgan Chase, General Electric, and Dow Chemical Company. He focused on companies that paid generous dividends, which he would reinvest into purchasing additional stock. He did not invest in technology companies and the stock du jour because he concentrated largely on companies he knew about. When he died, he had no fewer than 95 stocks that were diversified in many industries such as healthcare, telecommunications, public utilities, rail transport, banks, and consumer goods. Although he owned shares of Lehman Brothers when it went bankrupt in 2008, the bankruptcy minimally affected his returns because his investments were diversified. In a safe deposit box at his bank, Read stored his stock certificates, which when piled together reached five inches high. To remain updated on his investments, he relied on The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, and the public library near him. Read read The Wall Street Journal daily. His neighbors, family, and friends did not know the scale of the money he had amassed. Read used a safety pin on his fraying khaki denim jacket so he could continue wearing it and put on shabby flannel shirts. Read was a regular at a Friendly's where one time a patron paid for his meal because the patron thought Read could not afford the meal. He owned a used 2007 Toyota Yaris, which Read's lawyer, Laurie Rowell, said despite his being a millionaire, whenever he visited, he parked in the further parking spaces that did not have parking meters. Writing in The Boston Globe, Nik DeCosta-Klipa called Read \\"the epitome of Yankee frugality, according to those who knew him\\". Despite the limited salary from his employment, he was able to amass a substantial fortune through purchasing equities. Barry Ritholtz of The Washington Post praised Read, writing, \\"How a man of modest means accumulated so much wealth contains exemplary lessons for saving that apply to all of us.\\" He noted that lessons could be learned from Read's experience: \\"But there is also a cautionary tale about recognizing the value of your finite time here on Earth. Perhaps learning to enjoy life while you can is part of that equation.\\" The Wall Street Journal said that \\"Besides being a good stock picker, he displayed remarkable frugality and patience‚Äîwhich gave him many years of compounded growth.\\" Referring to Thomas J. Stanley's 1996 book The Millionaire Next Door, Los Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik found Read to be \\"a Vermont retiree who appeared to be one of Stanley's emblematic secret blue-collar millionaires\\". Death and legacy As Read's health deteriorated, Brattleboro Memorial Hospital attended to him. He died there on June 2, 2014, at 92. Read was a widower, survived by two stepchildren, Philip Brown and Bonnie Brown. His funeral was conducted with military honors, and he was buried at Meeting House Hill Cemetery. His estate was nearly $8 million, much of which was in shares of stock. He bequeathed $2 million to his stepchildren, caregivers, and friends. He donated $4.8 million to Brattleboro Memorial Hospital and $1.2 million to Brooks Memorial Library, which at the time had a $600,000 budget and a $600,000 endowment and was affected by the local budget squeeze like other libraries in the state. Both bequests were the largest donations the institutions had received. Read also gave a historic phonograph and a collection of drums to the Dummerston Historical Society. The news of his donations was reported in numerous newspapers and magazines.

Much of his fraktur was produced for the children of York County, and many of his pieces are similar to one another in their format, in which two female figures border the text and various flowers and birds are added as decoration. For his family, he created more elaborate pictures, in which a variety of objects, from sailing ships to pianos, are shown. One baptismal record for a nephew includes in its decorative scheme a market house, chickens, and a dog. Sometimes he added Adam and Eve into his compositions; he also drew courting couples. His palette is bright. Peterman used ruled paper to continue his art when hand-milled paper became unavailable; he continued to work well into the 1860s. He was among the most prolific fraktur artists active in York County, alongside Johannes Bard. Nearly all of his pieces were made for families in Paradise, Codorus, Shrewsbury and Manheim townships.

The composition, scored for four voices, SATB, was published in Rome in 1585 in Officium Hebdomadae Sanctae (Office of the Holy Week).  History, text and music  Victoria, a late Renaissance Spanish composer, set a liturgical text from the Improperia (Reproaches) prescribed for the Catholic liturgy on Good Friday. Victoria set two refrains, one from the ninth century, worded as if Jesus on the Cross addressed his people: \\"Popule meus, quid feci tibi?\\" (My people, what have I done to you?), the other the Trisagion (in Greek, \\"thrice holy\\") and its Latin translation. The refrains are used during the Veneration of the Cross in the liturgy, chanted by two choirs in antiphonal singing, one singing the Greek, the other one the Latin. The Greek text is the only remnant in Greek in the Roman liturgy besides the Kyrie eleison. The composition was published by Alessandro Gardane in Rome in 1585 as No. 27 of the collection Officium Hebdomadae Sanctae (Office of the Holy Week). It is scored for four voices, SATB. Victoria's setting of the two refrains has been described as \\"of compelling beauty\\" and \\"music of great expressiveness\\", achieved by simple harmonies, mostly in homophony.  Recording  The motet has been recorded often, as part of different collections. A 1996 recording offers music by Victoria, including his Missa Dum Complerentur, sung by the Westminster Cathedral Choir, conducted by James O'Donnell. A 2004 collection offers the motet as part of music from the time of the reign of Philip II of Spain, performed by Musica Ficta.

He was Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum between 1956 and 1976. He was additionally Geddes‚ÄìHarrower Professor of Greek Art and Archaeology at the University of Aberdeen from 1972 to 1973, and, in retirement, visitor to the Ashmolean Museum from 1979 to 1987. He had served in military intelligence during the Second World War. Early life and education Haynes was born on 15 February 1913 in Harrogate, Yorkshire, England. He was educated at Marlborough College, then an all-boys independent boarding school, between 1926 and 1932. In 1932, he matriculated into Trinity College, Cambridge to study the classical tripos. He specialised in classical archaeology, and graduated with a first class Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1935. He then undertook a further year of study in Roman provincial archaeology at the University of Bonn. Career =Pre-war= Haynes began his academic career as a scholar at the British School at Rome from 1936 to 1937: during this time he undertook research fro his first book, Porta Argentariorum, which was published in 1939. In 1937, he joined the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A;) in London, having been appointed an assistant keeper in its Department of Metalwork. He developed an interest in foundry techniques and bronze figures during his two years at the V&A.; In 1939, Haynes was invited to join the staff of the British Museum by Bernard Ashmole, the newly-appointed Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities. On 11 April 1939, he was appointed assistant keeper in the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities: he joined the department in the aftermath of a scandal involving the over-cleaning of the Elgin Marbles. With the outbreak of the Second World War, he was involved in the preparing and packing of the British Museum's extensive collection for safe storage. =Second World War= During the Second World War, Haynes was released by the British Museum for war work. On 11 September 1941, he enlisted in the Royal Artillery, British Army. He transferred to intelligence, and worked with the Intelligence Service in the United Kingdom. He also served abroad, having been assigned to the map room of General Harold Alexander during the Italian Campaign. As his intelligence work involved information that had been decoded via the cracked Enigma machine, he could not speak about it, and rarely spoke about his wider war work. In either 1943 or 1945, he was appointed Antiquities Officer for Libya and was based in Tripoli. His duties were to record and preserve the sites of ancient Libya: this resulted in the publication of Ancient Tripolitania in 1946. This book was a guidebook aimed \\"primarily for the military tourist\\". It was layer revised and expanded to target a wider audience, and published as Antiquities of Tripolitania ten years later. =Post-war= Gallery in the British Museum displaying the Bassae Frieze Haynes returned to England in September 1946, and rejoined the British Museum. His first assignment was to return the antiquities that had been safely stored away to the museum. He was made Deputy Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities in 1954. When Ashmole moved to the University of Oxford in 1956, Haynes was selected to replace him as Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities and thereby head of the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities. Among the galleries and exhibitions that he oversaw was the re-display of the Elgin marbles in the Duveen Gallery which opened in 1962, and the creation of an exhibition on daily life in Ancient Greece and Rome. He also supervised building work that transformed ten ground floor rooms into fourteen rooms which held a chronological display of classical art and sculpture from the Greek Bronze Age through to the Roman Empire: this exhibition opened on 3 July 1969. Among the galleries created, was one built specifically for the Bassae Frieze with the same interior dimensions as the Temple of Apollo from which they originated. Haynes main duties at the museum were curatorial and administrative. He did, however, have some time to continue academic pursuits. He wrote a number of books relating to various antiquities in his department, usually linked in with new exhibitions, and also had a number of papers published in learned journal. From 1972 to 1973, he was Geddes-Harrower Professor of Greek Art and Archaeology at the University of Aberdeen: this required the delivery of a lecture series which was later published as Greek Art and the Idea of Freedom. He also served as Chairman of the Society for Libyan Studies from 1973 to 1975. Haynes retired from the British Museum in 1976, and was succeeded as Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities by Brian Cook. Personal life 89 Great Russell Street On 18 January 1951, Haynes married Dr Sybille Edith Overhoff. She is a classical archaeologist and noted Etruscologist. They did not have any children. Following the Second World War and his marriage to Sybille, Haynes lived next to the British Museum at 89 Great Russell Street, London, and then at 24 Hereford Square, South Kensington. Following his retirement, they moved first to Dean, Oxfordshire, and then in 1985 to Banbury Road, Oxford. Haynes led an active retirement, dedicating time to academic research and published a number of works. From September 1976 to June 1977, he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. From 1979 to 1987, he was a visitor to the Ashmolean Museum: this is a position that forms part of the leadership and oversight of the museum. On 27 September 1994, Haynes died of ischaemic heart disease at the Acland Hospital in Oxford; he was 81 years old. In his obituary in The Independent, he was described as \\"one of the last gentleman-scholars\\" to have worked at the British Museum.

Political Affairs called Eternal Treblinka, \\"a wonderful book about terrible subjects\\". JVNA called it \\"very well researched ... written with great sensitivity and compassion\\". Eternal Treblinka has been translated into French, German, Spanish, Italian, Hebrew, Polish, Czech, Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian, Russian, and Japanese.https://lanternbooks.presswarehouse.com/books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=60933  Summary  = Part I = In part one of Eternal Treblinka, Patterson opens chapter one by quoting Sigmund Freud. ‚ÄúIn the course of his development towards culture man acquired a dominating position over his fellow-creatures in the animal kingdom.‚Äù This quote sets the stage for the first chapter which expresses the relationship between humans and animals. Patterson describes how the domination of man over animals is a recent phenomenon. ‚ÄúMans emergence as the dominant species is a very recent development.‚Äù He brings in Carl Sagan's idea of the Cosmic Calendar to show just how little time humans have actually spent on this earth to begin to portray this idea. He then illustrates the different arguments on what caused the technological advances of the human species beyond that of animals, by presenting the ideas of those ranging from Jared Diamond to Barbara Ehrenreich. Once the proper technological advances of humans were acquired, then came the domestication of animals. Patterson quotes ‚ÄúThe transition to herding and farming happened gradually. Those who hunted wild sheep and goats attached themselves to a particular herd, which then became ‚Äútheir‚Äù herd to follow and exploit.‚Äù Patterson notes that in order to domesticate animals for human purposes such as meat and labor, herders learned how to control the animals whole lives through the use of ‚Äúcastration, hobbling, branding, ear cropping, and such devices as leather aprons, whips, prods, and eventually chains and collars‚Ä¶‚Äù He describes the brutal processes such as castration, and the early weaning of calves from their mothers. He then goes on to divulge the relationship between the exploitation of animals and victims of the Holocaust. ‚ÄúOnce animal exploitation was industrialized and accepted as part of the natural order of things, it opened the door to similar ways of treating other human beings, thus paving the way for such atrocities as human slavery and the Holocaust.‚Äù Patterson also brings up the topic of how the domestication of animals has led to the domination and sexual subjection of women. He quotes Elizabeth Fisher, ‚ÄúThe domestication of women followed the initiation of animal keeping.‚Äù she writes ‚Äúand it was then that men began to control women‚Äôs reproductive capacity, enforcing chastity and sexual repression.‚Äù Fisher wrote this in her book Woman's Creation: Sexual Evolution and the Shaping of Society \\"Feminist philosopher Elizabeth Fisher (1979) was one of the first authors to discuss the link between domination of women and the domestication of animals.\\" Patterson believes that the keeping of animals set a model for the domination over women and the enslavement of humans in general. Slaves, especially were treated just as animals are now. Patterson writes that slaves were even branded and castrated just as animals still are to this day. ‚ÄúBranding was used as a way to mark and identify slaves throughout the Americas until the late 1700s.‚Äù Patterson then moves on to the idea of The Great Chain of Being. It was created by Plato, which ‚ÄúFormalized the belief of the Greeks that they ranked higher than non-Greeks, women, slaves, and, of course, animals.‚Äù Because of this early hierarchical arrangement, Patterson thinks that this is part of the reason that men look upon themselves as better and more superior than animals. It created a hierarchical of social classes and determined their place in society. According to the humanocentric view, animals were made for man, thus creating the human/animal divide. Patterson insists that Descarte and his followers had a large influence in this when they maintained that animals did not feel pain and claimed that their cries, howls, and writhings were only external reflexes, unconnected to inner sensation. Patterson quotes that ‚ÄúWidening the gulf between man and animals to such an extent provided by far the best rationalization yet for the human exploitation of animals.‚Äù In chapter two he uncovers how humans began vilifying others as animals. Since Europeans began describing Native Americans and Africans as animals, it justified slavery to them. Since animals were already looked down upon them as less superior, when they associated them Africans with animals it made it easier for them to treat them this horribly. Patterson writes ‚ÄúCalling people animals is always an ominous sign because it sets them up for humiliation, exploitation, and murder.‚Äù When the Europeans traveled to Africa in the sixteenth century some described the people there as rude and beastlie; they even referred their language to that of apes because they did not understand. Native Americans were vilified as well, in a similar way as a prelude to their destruction. ‚ÄúStannard writes that in California, as elsewhere, whites described indians ‚Äúas ugly, filthy, and inhuman ‚Äòbeasts,‚Äô ‚Äòswine,‚Äô ‚Äòdogs,‚Äô ‚Äòwolves,‚Äô ‚Äòsnakes,‚Äô ‚Äòpigs,‚Äô ‚Äòbaboons,‚Äô ‚Äògorillas,‚Äô and ‚Äòoran-gutans,‚Äô to cite only a few of the press's more commonly published characterizations.‚Äù Even Japanese were vilified as animals during World War II. They were seen as animals, reptiles, and insects. Patterson quotes John Dowers words from his book War Without Mercy. \\"Japanese were perceived as animals, reptiles, or insects (monkeys, baboons, gorillas, dogs, mice and rats, vipers and rattlesnakes, cockroaches, vermin..‚Äù After Pearl Harbor, Japanese-Americans were literally treated like animals. They were rounded up and forced to live in animal facilities. Lastly, Patterson brings up the topic of the vilification of Jews. ‚ÄúIn Germany this kind of vilification began long before the Nazis came to power. At first, the leader of the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther (1483-1546) praised Jews for rejecting the corrupt teachings of the papal ‚Äúantichrist.‚Äù But when it soon became clear the Jews weren‚Äôt all that eager to convert to his brand of Christianity, he denounced them as ‚Äúpigs‚Äù and ‚Äúmad dogs.‚Äù\\" Patterson then begins to discuss the topic of the Holocaust and how Jews were viewed during this time. He quotes one of the leading members of the Nazi party on his views of Jews. this time. He quotes one of the leading members of the Nazi party on his views of Jews. ‚ÄúHeinrich Himmler, who regarded the Jew as ‚Äúspiritually and mentally much lower than any animal,‚Äù saw the war as a racial struggle to the death against the horde of ‚ÄúAsiatic animals‚Äù under the control of Jewish Bolshevism.‚Äù‚Äù Jews were viewed as animals by members of the Nazi party. Viewing Jews as animals made it easier for Nazis to do their job. It made them feel like connected to them emotionally and physically. ‚ÄúThe use of animal terms to vilify and dehumanize the victims, combined with the abominably degraded conditions in the camps, made it easier for the SS to do their job, since treating prisoners like animals made them begin to look and smell like animals.‚Äù Since civilization was built on the murder and exploitation of animals, it was easier to kill the lower and more degraded human victims. Patterson ends part one by relating the concentration camps such as Auschwitz to factories and slaughterhouses where they keep and slaughter animals. = Part II = In part two of Eternal Treblinka Patterson draws direct connections to the industrialization of animal slaughter and the holocaust Early on he mentions a German Jewish philosopher, Theodor Adorno, who said ‚ÄúAuschwitz begins wherever someone looks at a slaughterhouse and thinks: they‚Äôre only animals.‚Äù Patterson then delves into the foundations of the industrialized factory farms that began with Western expansion. Patterson says ‚Äúthe European settlers brought with them to the Americas their practices of exploiting animals for labor, food, clothing, and transportation.‚Äù He says the slaughter of animals in North America arrived with the English. To describe this phenomenon he discusses the famine facing the Jamestown settlers in the winter of 1607-8 where they slaughtered and ate all the animals they brought from England. After the livestock supply was replenished they butchered the surplus at the start of each winter, and soon the settlers of Jamestown were continuing the slaughter and meat preservation process in bulk. The industrialization of slaughter continued with the colony of New Amsterdam, which became New York in 1664; by 1665 the number of butchered animals a year was almost 10,000 and the colony required slaughter permits. As the amount of slaughter increased, the slaughterhouses kept moving ‚Äúin deference to the public, wanting to be spared the sights, sounds, and smells of slaughter‚Äù Patterson notes that the first step toward the division of labor that would transform the American meat industry was evident in Cincinnati by the mid 1800s when larger plants combined their slaughter and meatpacking operations. According to Patterson, by the 1850s the construction of Union Stock Yards turned meatpacking into a major industry and Chicago became the slaughter capital of America The Meatpacking industry also introduced the conveyor belt, increasing the efficiency and speed of the nation's first mass-production industry with the assembly line process In 1905, after the meat industry lobby blocked a bill in Congress that would‚Äôve implemented meat inspection standards, the paper The Appeal To Reason enlisted Upton Sinclair to investigate the Chicago meatpacking industry. Sinclair published fictional novel The Jungle based on what he saw while investigating, which exposed the horrors of the meatpacking industry to the public. Patterson says that the biggest difference between the slaughter of animals today and in the early 1900s is that slaughterhouses have become faster and increased in volume of production, ‚Äú[a slaughterhouse] today... kills more animals in a single day than all the slaughterhouses in Sinclair's day killed in a year.‚Äù Patterson then discusses political artist, Sue Coe's, book Dead Meat about her six years visiting slaughterhouses around the country In her book Coe says that the Holocaust kept coming to mind as she visited the slaughterhouses, ‚Äúshe says she wonders if [the Holocaust] is ‚Äòthe comforting measuring rod by which all horrors are evaluated?‚Äô‚Äù Patterson continues his argument of relating the industrialization of the meat industry to the Holocaust by discussing Henry Ford, ‚Äúwhose impact on the twentieth century began, metaphorically speaking, at an American slaughterhouse and ended at Auschwitz.‚Äù In his autobiography, Ford said that his inspiration for assembly-line production came from visiting a Chicago slaughterhouse. Patterson says that not only did Ford help the Holocaust happen by developing the assembly-line method that the Germans used for killing, but he also launched an anti-Semitic campaign. Hitler praised Ford; he even said ‚ÄúI regard Henry Ford as my inspiration.\\" According to Patterson, Ford was not the only American influence on the Holocaust, the eugenics movement and Mendel's theory of heredity had an impact, as well. In addition to eugenics, sterilization in America influenced the German atrocities. Patterson claims that ‚ÄúNazi Germany looked to the United States for racial leadership‚Äù because Hitler was impressed by America's laws on sterilization, racial segregation and immigration restrictions. Patterson continues by describing how the Nazi's compared mentally challenged people to animals in order to justify and practice research on sterilization and eugenics on them. Patterson then discusses Heinrich Himmler, attributing Himmler's work operating on a chicken farm to begin his interest in breeding and killing humans; ‚ÄúHimmler didn‚Äôt consider his victims human, so he was not at all concerned about their suffering or their fate.\\" By 1942, Himmler's work led to a running Auschwitz for the mass extermination of all ‚Äúsub-humans.\\" Patterson's argument that animal slaughter has a direct relation to the holocaust culminates in his last chapter. He states, ‚Äúthe study of human history reveals the pattern: first humans exploit and slaughter animals; then, they treat other people like animals and do the same to them.\\" It was not only in the murdering that the Nazi's dehumanized their victims, but in their treatment before it as well; they were naked and crowded together in herds. Just like animals in a slaughterhouse, those who arrived to concentration camps sick and would be inefficient and slow down the process were shot. Patterson says that ‚Äúchildren were shown no mercy at death camps either,‚Äù much like the baby animals he claims cry just like human babies and are mercilessly slaughtered. The Nazi's created a hierarchy in which ‚Äúsub-humans,‚Äù such as Jews, were ranked below animals and thusly treated that way. Patterson mentions a little girl in a warsaw ghetto that said, ‚ÄúI would like to be a dog because the Germans like dogs, and I would not have to be afraid they would kills me.\\"  Key terms in Eternal Treblinka  1\\\\. Treblinka: The name of a Nazi death camp during the World War II era, where an estimated 800,000 Jews were killed. Treblinka and the Holocaust are compared to the human treatment of animals. 2\\\\. Human Megalomania: The self-declared ownership humans gave themselves over other occupants of the world, such as animals. This idea is the basis for chapter one, and breaks down human supremacy over other inhabitants on earth. Synonym: \\"Human Arrogance\\". 3\\\\. Amar-kud: Sumerian term for castrated slave boys, donkeys, oxen, and horses. That the ancient Mesopotamian city-states used the same term for these indicates that they treated their slaves and livestock in the same manner. 4\\\\. Emasculation: The act of weakening or depriving a man of his identity as a male. It was used in the book to describe how American colonists treated black slave men, for example, by castrating them. They castrated male slaves the same way they castrated bulls. This exemplifies how white men exerted their self-declared power over black men. 5\\\\. Homo Ferus: \\"A wild man who was four-footed, mute and hairy.\\" The term was coined by Carolus Linnaeus to characterize non-whites as being half human and half animal. 6\\\\. Great Chain of Being: A concept originating from Plato that places organisms in a hierarchy with Greeks at the top, followed by non-Greeks, women, and then slaves and animals. 7\\\\. Subhuman: Being lesser than human. This is referred to often in reference to treatment of prisoners during the Holocaust. 8\\\\. Craniometry: The scientific measurement of brain sizes. This was used as a way to rank humans based on brain size in order to portray specific foreign people as lesser. 9\\\\. Extermination: The killing of an entire group, usually in reference to animals or insects, though it may also refer to eff. 10\\\\. Foramen Magnum: The Hole located in the base of one's skull where the spinal cord passes through. Research on the location of the foramen magnum, done by a French pathologist, determined black people's skulls resembled monkeys in order to place them as lesser than white people.

After World War I, he was elected as secretary of the Lancshire Divisional Council of the ILP, and also of its Rochdale Federation. From 1928 until 1931, he served as a nationally-elected member of the ILP's National Administrative Council.

The team, which is working with Southeast Asia Rainforest Research Partnership (SEARRP), has named the tree ‚ÄúMenara‚Äù, which means \\"tower\\" in the Malay language. Menara was discovered in August 2018. On January 6th, 2019 Unding Jami established a measurement for the tree by climbing it and measuring its height using a tape measure. Later that year, a research team scanned the tree with a terrestrial laser scanner and drone flights to produce a 3D model . Menara is likely the tallest flowering plant in the world as it's taller than the previous record holder, a Mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) in Tasmania that may be 100.5 m tall. If not counting its roots, Menara weighs nearly 81,500 kilograms. 95% of this mass is located in the trunk, while 5% comes from the 40 meter-wide crown. The stem is extremely straight, with its center of mass at 28 m above the ground, which is just 0.6 m off from the central vertical axis. This indicates that the tree is highly symmetrical and well-balanced, even though it is sitting on a slope.

She became physically disabled from rheumatism, unable to walk, and lost almost the entire use of her hands. She learned to read Italian, Spanish, German, Greek, and Russian without any instruction. Then she took up Volap√ºk, and became well-known as a Volap√ºk scholar. She carried on correspondence with several linguists in Europe and associations for the spreading of this language. Early years and education Neal Dow House in Portland, Maine. Louisa Dwight Dow was born in Portland, Maine, March 23, 1831. She was the eldest child of General Neal Dow and Maria Cornelia Durant Maynard Dow. Her siblings included Emma Maynard Dow, Frederick Neal Dow, and Cornelia Maria Dow. She was educated in the best schools of Portland, the last and chief of which was the Free Street Seminary for young ladies, Master Hezekiah Packard, teacher. She had, besides these, teachers in French. Career On December 12, 1860, she married Jacob Benton, of Lancaster, New Hampshire. They passed four seasons in Washington, D.C., while Mr. Benton was a member of Congress, after which they resided at \\"Benton Manor\\" in Lancaster. In the fall of 1887, she contracted rheumatism. She went several times to mineral springs in Canada, and to Hot Springs, Arkansas, but derived no benefit from any of them. Eventually, she could not walk or stand; she passed the time with reading books, writing, drawing and painting. Her hands and arms were so greatly and increasingly affected by the disease that she stopped drawing and painting, and devoted herself to the acquisition of languages, a study which was always especially attractive to her. She learned to read fluently Italian, Spanish, German, Greek and Russian, all with no teacher except for Greek. After that, she took up the Volap√ºk and mastered it easily. She was so well known as a Volap√ºk scholar that correspondence came to her from several prominent linguists in Europe, and several European Volap√ºk associations elected her corresponding member. Personal life Benton Fountain Benton designed and gave a fountain to the town of Lancaster in memory of her husband, who died from the effects of an accident in the fall of 1892. He had long been a resident of the town and had attained prominence as a lawyer, business man and politician. This memorial fountain was erected on the corner of Main and Mechanic streets, directly in front of the doorway of the Town Hall building. It was inscribed with the following memorial: \\"In memory of Jacob Benton as a gift to the town this fountain was erected by his wife Louisa D. Benton, on the day of his death September 29, 1892.\\" She died at her home in Lancaster on December 7, 1895, from the effects of an operation for the removal of a cancer.

It was one of the first French railway guns mounted on a standard gauge rail car during the First World War. History Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns. However, a paradox faced artillery designers of the time; while large caliber naval guns were common, large caliber land weapons were not due to their weight, complexity, and lack of mobility. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it didn't necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed.  Design  The Obusier de 200 \\"P√©rou\\" sur aff√ªt-truck TAZ Schneider began life as two rail mounted coastal defense howitzers ordered by Peru in 1910 from Schneider that were produced at their Le Havre factory. The two howitzers were seized by the French Army when war broke out. The howitzers were designated as Obusier (\\"howitzer\\" in English), sur aff√ªt-truck \\"railway carriage mounted\\", and TAZ (from Tous Azimuts) \\"all azimuth\\" in English. The barrels were of built-up steel construction consisting of a rifled steel liner and protective outer jacket 15 calibers in length. The barrels were trunnioned at their center and were mounted on high-angle center pivot mounts and provided with gun shields. The howitzers incorporated a U-shaped hydro- pneumatic recoil mechanism below the barrel, interrupted screw breech and fired separate-loading, cased charges and projectiles. A disadvantage was that the ammunition was not used by any other French guns. The howitzers were mounted on four-axle well base carriages and were top carriage traversing mounts with 360¬∞ of traverse. Once on site the carriage's outriggers would be unfolded and jackscrews at the ends of the outriggers lowered to level the carriage and take the weight off the axles while four rail clamps would anchor the carriage in place. A circular gun platform unfolded to give the gun crew a level work surface for loading, traversing and elevating the guns. The elevation system had a combination of a rapid system which lowered the barrel to +5¬∞ for reloading while a slow system allowed for small adjustments to vary range. Traverse was by a worm gear at the base of the mount which allowed for fine adjustment. In service, the two guns formed a battery and they shared an ammunition wagon and a command wagon which had a telescopic observation post for an artillery spotter. Ammunition was transferred from the ammunition wagon to the howitzers by an elevated trough and the projectiles could be loaded on a cart which ran on a rail inside of the firing platform for loading. This allowed the howitzer to be loaded while facing any direction.  Functioning  The mobile battery consists of four railroad cars. Two cars have an 8-inch rapid-fire gun, there is an ammunition car that is between the two gun cars, and a telescoping observation car. The advantages of the Schneider train were that it was less costly than a fixed battery of the same firepower; the train allowed a degree of secrecy since it was not in a fixed location; ease of maintenance since it could be stored in a train shed; there was no need to construct new roads for its use; and any railroad tracks laid for its use can also be used by passenger and freight haulage. The cars of the train were arranged with the train engine first, followed by the observation car, then the first gun car, the ammunition car, and then the second gun car. The observation car was placed near the engine so that the commanding officer could more easily place the train where required. The ammunition car was placed between the two gun cars to provide the shortest distance to move the artillery shells to each gun.  World War I  The two guns were assigned to the 51e batterie du 1er R√©giment d'Artillerie √† Pied or foot artillery regiment in English of the ALVF (Artillerie Lourde sur Voie Ferr√©e) or rail mounted heavy artillery in English. They first saw action in Belgium during 1914 in the Race to the Sea to protect Belgium's channel ports from a German offensive and served throughout the war.

Unable to disengage the afterburner, Holden ran down the runway narrowly missing a crossing fuel bowser and a de Havilland Comet taking off, before taking off himself. Flying without a helmet, the ejection seat disabled, and the landing gear locked down, Holden aborted a couple of attempted landings. He landed on his third approach, striking the runway with the aircraft's tail as he adopted in his flare the attitude of a taildragger aircraft. The aircraft returned to service, and was subsequently acquired by the Imperial War Museum Duxford. Aircraft The English Electric Lightning was a high-performance short-range interceptor aircraft. The Lightning had a max takeoff weight of 20 tons, and could reach Mach 2.0. The aircraft involved in the incident was the second production Lightning, designated XM135. XM135 was suffering from an electrical fault that would only manifest during acceleration for takeoff,Empire of the Clouds: When Britain's Aircraft Ruled the World, James Hamilton-Paterson, pages 223-5 the electrical inverter supplying power to flight instruments would cut out during the first yards of the takeoff, and the standby inverter would switch in. Crew A de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk similar to that in which Holden had some practice flights Wing Commander Walter \\"Taffy\\" Holden enlisted in 1943, gaining a cadetship to a university. Studying mechanical engineering, Holden also learnt to fly on the de Havilland Tiger Moth biplane. Holden pursued an engineering career in the RAF; however, the RAF did qualify him with pilot wings after training on the Harvard. He subsequently practised on the de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk during his early career.A Memorable Fright, Walter Holden, The Wheel, reprint of The Haltonian In 1966, Holden was in command of No. 33 Maintenance Unit RAF at RAF Lyneham, which was in the process of closing. The unit maintained Gloster Meteors, English Electric Canberras, and English Electric Lightnings. At the time, the unit was in the process of winding down and was disposing of its last aircraft. The unit had a test pilot on staff for its Canberras and Meteors, but that pilot was not qualified for the Lightning. For Lightning flights, Holden had to locate RAF test pilots with a current rating who could usually be found within 24 to 36 hours.Pilot by accident: The mechanic that took off in the world's strongest aircraft (Hebrew), Calcalist, Nitzan Sadan, 5 April 2019English Electric/BAC Lightning Mks 1-6, Kev Darling, pp. 56‚Äì57 Flight history The troubles with aircraft XM135 were holding up the closure of the unit, and at the time of the incident, no test pilot was available for another week. A pilot from RAF Boscombe Down, who was involved in previous tests, suggested Holden perform the test himself as it involved only ground taxiing for 30 to 40 yards at a time. At each test, Holden was to test a different electrical configuration, rev up the engine to high RPMs, then cut the engine and hit the brakes. Holden was to communicate by hand signals with his support crew on a Land Rover, which would coordinate the next test with the control tower. Holden was not wearing a helmet and had no radio. The canopy of the aircraft was removed due to electrical wires running out of the cockpit. The landing gear was locked in a down position due to being in a test mode. Lightning with afterburners engaged After the Lightning was in position, Holden carried out the first test as expected, moving the aeroplane . However, in a subsequent test Holden pushed the throttle past the afterburner gate. Once the afterburner was engaged, disengaging it required pushing the gate keys located behind the throttle, which Holden was inexperienced in operating. The Lightning gained speed quickly and just missed a fuel tanker that was crossing the runway in front of Holden. The Lightning crossed the main runway as a mid-takeoff de Havilland Comet passed over the Lightning. Holden was also running out of runway, so he pulled the stick back and took off. Following takeoff, Holden managed to disengage the afterburner after feeling for the gate keys. Holden considered ejecting; however, that was not possible, because the ejection seat was in inert ground mode. On his first two landing attempts his speed and height were wrong, and Holden aborted the attempts. Holden, who vaguely recalled that the landing speed for the Lightning was 150 knots, took a wide circuit around Lyneham and attempted to land in the opposite direction of the runway, running away from the village. In Holden's final flare, he adopted the attitude used in a taildragger aircraft due to his earlier training. This resulted in a tailstrike, the rubber tail bumper of Lightning hitting the concrete, breaking, and detaching the cable of the drogue parachute used for assisting braking. Braking hard, Holden managed to bring the Lightning to a stop some one hundred yards before the end of the runway. All in all, Holden was airborne for 12 minutes. Aftermath XM135 at Imperial War Museum Duxford The aircraft was repaired and returned to service. The electrical fault was determined to be caused by wires left in place from a deleted ground test button for the standby inverter, which shorted into the UHF radio which moved on its trunnions during the takeoff run. After flying for 1343 hours,Aircraft Illustrated Annual, I. Allan, 1980, p. 18 XM135 was acquired in 1974 by the Imperial War Museum Duxford, where it is on display. The inadvertent flight was impossible to hide from the press since the base was filled with civilian contractors. Holden was sent to Italy on leave when the news broke; however, he was recognised there as well. An inquiry found that Holden did not actually act against any orders in the Flight Order Book (though these orders were subsequently amended) and that Holden did save himself and the plane. According to Holden, in a review before Air Marshal Kenneth Porter he was asked whether he agreed that \\"With the limited flying experience I had, the test would have been better left to an experienced and current Lightning test pilot\\", which he answered in the affirmative, following which Porter related some of his own unfortunate flying incidents. Holden remained in RAF service and retired in the late 1970s / early 1980s. Holden died in 2016, aged 90.

The Ely Community Center initially housed the public library, an auditorium, meeting rooms, and offices, as well as a cafeteria and public showers. The building's design mixed Art Deco with restrained Neoclassical formalism, a style that came to be known as PWA Moderne. The Ely Community Center continued serving many of its original functions for the rest of the 20th century, with community organizations headquartered there into the 1990s and events still being held in the auditorium and cafeteria. The building was vacated in 2014, when the library moved to a newly built facility. In 2018 the Ely City Council voted to sell the building to the K America Foundation, which plans to use it for Korean culture and heritage camps. The Ely Community Center was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016 for its local significance in the themes of architecture, entertainment/recreation, and politics/government. It was nominated as a distinctive example of a local partnership with the Public Works Administration to create a multi-purpose municipal facility, and for its characteristic PWA Moderne architecture.

Biography Born in Gilroy, California on August 16, 1887, Gene Hildebrand began his career in Thoroughbred racing in 1901 working as a stable hand then as a jockey at Emeryville Race Track near Oakland, California. In 1904 he won the Burns Handicap which at the time was the most important race in California. Prominent owners on the East Coast took notice and Hildebrand competed at the big New York tracks where at Gravesend Race Track he won the 1904 Preakness Stakes on May 28th aboard the colt Bryn Mawr. He went on to win numerous top stakes races including the most prestigious event of that era, the Belmont Futurity Stakes. Back on the West Coast for the winter racing season, on December 23, 1904 Hildebrand set a new world record for wins in a year when he rode win number 293 at Ascot Park in Los Angeles. He would finish the year as the national champion in total races won with 297 and in stakes wins with 35. Returning to the East Coast in 1905, on May 24 Hildebrand rode the filly Tanya to victory in the 1905 Belmont Stakes in its first running at the new Belmont Park track in Elmont, New York. Suspended on September 23, 1905 for rough riding, Hildebrand was not reinstated until March 9, 1906. The following day he rode at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas. From three mounts in the first three races on the day's card, he finished second in the opening race, won the second race, and finished fourth in the third race. Gene Hildebrand battled weight gain which hindered his racing and would force him to retire from riding in 1909. For several years he remained in the industry as an owner of a small stable of racehorses. In 1919 he fell ill with a flu that plagued him for two years until it turned to pneumonia and he died in an Oakland, California hospital on November 26, 1921, at the age of 34.

He was the son of George Ross of Nether Pitkerrie. He continued in Kincardine after the establishment of prelacy and owes his leaving to a meeting with John M'Gilligan. On the roll of ministers ejected after the Restoration the name of Ross appears amongst the ‚Äúouted‚Äù in the Presbytery of Dingwall. Along with some other recusant Presbyterians, he took a warm interest in Ô¨Åeld preaching until the summer of 1675, when he was arrested under a warrant, issued to the Earl of Moray, commanding him ‚Äúto execute the laws against the keepers of conventicles in the county of Moray and neighbouring places.‚Äù Wodrow relates, (perhaps mistakenly and perhaps misleading Crighton), that after undergoing terms of imprisonment at Nairn and Inverness, Ross made his acquaintance with the dungeons of the Bass Rock. Dickson suggests that he probably died there. Wodrow also mentions him as being a prisoner at Tain on the same page as other Bass prisoners. Porteous says that \\"after the release of Robert Gillespie, Alexander Peden had been sole prisoner of the Bass for a year and four months, when in the month of May, 1676, two ministers were brought thither for his occasional relief. These were Mr Thomas Ross, a minister from Ross-shire, and Mr Alexander Forrester, minister of St. Mungo, in Annandale.\\" Smellie quotes him as uncompaining as he neared his death. He was admitted to Kincardine in Sutherland before 28 August 1655. He was deprived by an Act of Parliament and Decreet of Privy Council on 1 October 1662, and went to Tain, where he is said to have made himself useful in the work of the Gospel. He was in Moray in 1669 where he was accused of keeping conventicles, and was imprisoned in 1675 in the Tolbooth of Nairn. In 1676 he was removed to the prison of Tain and confined till 9 October 1677, when he was liberated on finding caution for 2000 merks to appear when called upon. He died in his own house in Tain 13 January 1679. He had been suffering from a painful disease of the throat which kept him from even saying grace for a long period of time. James Fraser of Brea dedicated his Memoirs to him as a \\"singularly pious minister.\\" He was summoned to appear before representatives of the Privy Council in January 1685. Lilias Dunbar Lilias Dunbar lost her parents early in life and was brought up by Sir Hugh Campbell. Anderson relates that Lilias Dunbar (later Mrs Campbell) visited Thomas Ross, along with Jean Taylor, while he was sick in prison. She had a religious experience under Ross' ministry two years previously at Kilraick Old Town (Kilravock) pg 320. In the summer of the year 1679, in the twenty-second year of her age, Lilias Dunbar was married to Mr. Alexander Campbell of Torrich, a young gentleman descended, like herself, from the family of Calder, and a cousin of her own. The union was, however, formed by Mr. John Stewart, who, at the restoration, was minister of a parish in the presbytery of Deer, in the synod of Aberdeen, but who was ejected for nonconformity. Hew Scott said Thomas Ross married Lilias Dunbar, and had sons: Alexander of Nether Pitkerrie, minister of Fearn; and George, minister of Kincardine.

Taxonomy  A species proposed by Arthur H. S. Lucas and Charles Frost, given the name Ebenavia horni to ally the taxon to a clawless gecko species found in Madagascar, basing their description on material collected on the Horn expedition to central Australia. The taxon was later placed as a subspecies of Crenadactylus ocellatus, but re-elevated to species status in a revision of the genus that recognised seven distinguishable species. The type locality was identified as Charlotte Waters in the Northern Territory. The specific epithet horni is named by Lucas and Frost for the sponsor of the scientific expedition that provided the type specimen, the pastoralist William Austin Horn. Description  A species of Crenadactylus, distinguished by superficial details of the scales and coloration. The snout vent length is recorded up to 34.8 mm, a larger and robust species of the relatively smaller genus of geckos. The stripes running the length of the body contrasts a darker colour against the mostly tan and pale brown of the scales. Records of the habitat at the collection sites indicate an association with spinifex mounds, a dominant vegetation type of the arid centre of Australia. Crenadactylus horni presumed to have become geographically isolated around twenty to thirty million years ago, shown in evidence of ancient genetic divergence, persisting in micro- habitat that has become separated from sister species by the increasingly dry climate of the continent.

The decision of McGuinness J further suggested that \\"blameworthy prosecution delay was insufficient without some evidence of prejudice to the accused, whether in the form of a real risk of an unfair trial or stress and anxiety arising from the delay\\". The applicant in the case was successful in their appeal.  Background  In April 1994, Darren Bernard Blood was alleged to have been in possession a nine millimetre Mauser pistol and ammunition in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable inference that he did not possess the firearm for a lawful purpose. On 6 July 1999, Mr Blood was arrested and charged with firearms offences under section 27A(1) of the Firearms Act 1954, as inserted by section 8 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act 1976 and amended by section 14 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.Blood v DPP [2005] IESC 8. As pointed out by Byrne, the charge \\"appeared to arise out of the investigation into an unlawful killing which occurred in 1994\\". Mr Blood sought to prevent his prosecution for these offences on the grounds of prosecutorial delay. For example, it was put that the trial judge had \\"erred in law and in fact by failing to find that the delay on the part of the respondent in deciding to prosecute the applicant in 1994, 1995 and in 1996 was inexcusable and inordinate\\" and that the trial judge had \\"erred in law and in fact by failing to hold that the delay on the part of the respondent between 1994 and 1999 in directing the institution of a prosecution against the applicant constituted inordinate and excusable delay and thereby violated the applicant‚Äôs right to trial with due expedition in accordance with Article 38.1 of the Constitution of Ireland\\".  Supreme Court  The Supreme Court distinguished delays in criminal trials involving allegations of child sexual abuse where the delay is not caused the action or inaction of the prosecuting authorities. As Mr Blood's complaint concerned prosecutorial delay, the Supreme Court considered the circumstances to be more comparable to cases such as the Director of Public Prosecutions v Byrne [1994] 2 IR 237. Notably, McGuinness J stated that she would ‚Äúaccept that the applicant in the present case has not provided very strong evidence of specific prejudice resulting from the delay which has occurred in prosecuting the offences with which he has been charged.‚Äù However, McGuinness J found it relevant that the events connected with the alleged offences occurred in the context of a ‚Äúmotor bicycle fraternity‚Äù and that the applicant had ‚Äúceased to associate with any of that fraternity and has lost contact with any potential witnesses‚Äù. McGuinness J also acknowledged the stress caused by the impending proceedings and the related breakdown of the applicant's marriage. A further factor taken into account by McGuinness J was the fact that when initially under investigation in 1994-1996, the investigation concerned a charge of murder ‚Äì a much more serious offence than that subsequently brought. McGuinness J found that the ‚Äúright to an expeditious trial is implied in the right to a fair trial. There is a danger that a lengthy delay in itself will, through its effect on the memory of potential witnesses and of the accused person himself, render a trial unfair. ‚Ä¶ In the case of the applicant his loss of contact with his motor cycling associates, together with his anxiety and concern at the impending proceedings against him and the fact that he has now been charged with a less serious offence must be added factors.‚Äù As assessments of whether the right to an expeditious trial has been granted must be made on an ad hoc basis, McGuinness J concluded that taken as a whole, \\"the delays in the latter period of the prosecution of the applicant amount to a denial of his right to an expeditious trial. There is also a real risk that this may lead to an unfair trial.‚Äù  References  Supreme Court of Ireland cases Irish criminal law 2005 in Irish law 2005 in case law ","title":"Blood v DPP"},{"id":"60435611","text":"Fancy You may refer to: * Fancy You (EP), by Twice, 2019 * \\"Fancy You\\", a 2005 song by Wet Dog * \\"I Fancy You\\", a song by Crush from his 2014 EP Crush on You ","title":"Fancy You"},{"id":"60435620","text":"Velli Vitiyar was a Sangam poet.

It was chaired by Mr William Kellock, who was an officer at the bank of Scotland in the town. Following their inaugural event in January 1948, they held events roughly every fews months, which were frequented by many famous Scots associated with the advancement of Scottish independence, the Scottish Renaissance and the Scottish Folk Revival. Namely Thurso Berwick (Morris Blythman), Hamish Henderson, Hugh MacDiarmid, Wendy Wood and Dr. Robert Mcintyre, among others. They continued to publish song books until late 1966.  History  A photo of some of those involved in the Bo'ness Rebels. Featuring Hugh MacDonald (second from left in back row) and chairperson William Kellock (furthest on right, front row) The earliest record of the society is recorded on the 30 January 1948 in the Bo‚Äôness Journal, which details ‚ÄúVisitors from as far away as Scalpay off Harris, Lochinver and Dornoch were present at the first social function by the newly formed ‚Äòrebels‚Äô Literary club in Bo‚Äôness - a burns supper in the coffee house (a restaurant in the town). William Kellock explained that he had gathered together talent from the four corners of Scotland to honour the national bard and Scotland‚Äôs cultural heritage before and since his day. The night followed the usual Burns nicht pattern, at the conclusion of which the affiliations of the organisers were made clear. Mr. Clancy, Headmaster at Armadale Academy stated that he had come in loyalty to the Scottish National Party, and had been overwhelmed and delighted with the musical and cultural fare provided.\\" They continued to hold ceilidhs after this, either in the Viewforth hotel on the Wynd, in the Douglas Masonic lodge on Stewart Avenue, or Bo'ness Miners Welfare on Harbour Road, as well as a couple of other places  Publications  *The Rebels Ceilidh Song Book (Early 50s) - Features 35 songs. Including Bo'ness specific ones like 'The ballad o' the Learig', also songs made popular by the Glasgow Song Guild like Coronation Coronach (the Scottish Breakaway), as well as more well known songs traditionally associated with Harry Lauder, Andy Stewart, The Alexander Brothers and the like, for example Nicky Tams, Barnyards O' Delgaty, and Johnnie Lad. There are also three songs in Scottish Gaelic. The first edition of the book was printed at Type Composing Co., 17 Claremont Street, Glasgow, C.3. The Second Edition of the Rebels Ceilidh songbook has the same song collection as the first edition, however with advertisements and noticeable links to the SNP. For example, it was for sale at the party's headquarters, which at that time was at 59 Elmbank Street, Glasgow, C.2. It also features numerous advertisements promoting \\"Support Scottish Industry, Buy Scottish goods\\", as well as political advertisements. Even apolitical advertisements in the book are promoted on behalf of businesses by people known to be supporters of the SNP, for example Angus McGillveray Painter and Decorator of Bathgate, has an advertisement placed. McGillveray ran the SNP publications department from 1964 until his retirement in 1995. *Patriot Songs for Camp and Ceilidh (Mid to late 50s) - 35 different songs. For the first time mentions frequenters of the societies events, and contributions of Morris Blythman, Hamish Henderson, Norman McCaig, and Wendy Wood. *The Rebels Ceilidh Song Book No. 2 (1965) - 34 different songs, in Welsh, Irish and Scots (No Gaelic - also omission of Uisdean Mac Dhomnaill following the preface as was the case in the other editions - this is Gaelic for Hugh Macdonald. This suggests Hugh's primary contribution in the former books was the Gaelic songs, as there is no Gaelic whatsoever in this, their final publication.) This edition also mentions Angus McGillveray as the primary address for the SNP's publications department. It also advertises single poems for sale by the Rebels Society, including Hugh Mcdiarmids \\"A drunk man looks at the thistle\\" and Norman McCaig's works, obtainable from \\"Shonna\\" on Dean Road in Bo'ness. (presumably a house name) The Rebels Ceilidh Song Book No. 2 (1965) Bo'ness Rebels Literary Society, p.36 There are no surviving copies of these. *Rebel Ceilidh Song Book 67 (1966) - a reprint of the above book with Hugh MacDiarmids caricature in the shape of a thistle on the front cover.  Ambiguity around publishing dates  The preface to ‚ÄòThe rebels ceilidh song book No. 2‚Äô, states that their first publication, 'The rebels Ceilidh song book' was published in 1951/2, however it includes the song ‚ÄòBallad of the Learig bar‚Äô, and the Learig bar did not get its license and thus was unable to open until 9/10/1953. It also features songs referencing the postbox bombings in Inch, ‚ÄòThe ballad of the inch‚Äô, ‚ÄôSky-High Joe‚Äô and ‚ÄòSky-High pantomime‚Äô, which didn‚Äôt happen until 1953. So their first book must‚Äôve been published after 1953.  Links to the organisation from the town  There are numerous advertisements in their published works, most of which are related to business' in Bo'ness. Interestingly, it is likely the Bo'ness Rebels Literary Society collected their advertisements from people who were SNP supporters, as is evident through the following examples; The most apparent of these is the Learig bar of Dean Road to which, a 27 verse poem is dedicated in 'The Rebels Ceilidh Song Book'. By the time of their final publication, the poem had 32 verses. The Learig bar was owned by Charles Auld, next to his grocers often referred to as \\"Chairlie P's\\" in reference to him, on Dean Road in Bo'ness. All of the rebels songbooks were sold there, according to their preface's. Auld was a nationalist, as was his brother, according to the ballad. The \\"elbow room\\" is mentioned , a quiet room in the pub. According to Bo'ness SNP councillor Harry Constable in Ewan Macvicor's 'The Eskimo Republic' \\"It wasn‚Äôt a concert ceilidh, it was almost like a debating society. We had people from the Labour Party, communists, left wing socialists, nationalists, it was remarkable. But not only left wingers. Discussions took place, and I believe a lot of people learned a lot.\\" However, former Labour MP and teacher at Bo'ness Academy Tam Dalyell, were also welcome, as was former Bo'ness town provost Charlie Sneddon, and both are mentioned in the 32 verse version of the poem in 'The rebels Ceilidh song book No. 2'.The Rebels Ceilidh Song Book No. 2 (1965) Bo'ness Rebels Literary Society, p.30 Indeed, the opening preface to the first book states \\"This Book is Labour, it is Nationalist, it is Tory in the original sense of the word\\" - so perhaps it is not as partisan as it would initially appear. On page 30 of 'The rebels Ceilidh Song Book' there is an advertisement for Willie Ross Jewellers on north street. Willie Ross was a group scout master in the town, and a jeweller, as well as being known for being in the SNP. He also did Baritone singing at the Rebels Ceilidhs. On the same page, as well as numerous times throughout the Bo'ness Rebels books, there is an advertisement for the Viewforth hotel. The Viewforth hotel, now shut, was on the Church Wynd. The Bo'ness rebels literary society held ceilidhs there, for example in July 1949, when the Bo'ness Journal states \\"The Bo'ness Rebels Literary Club held a smokers ceilidh in the Viewforth hotel, in honour of Councillor William Horne, first Bo'ness Councillor to be elected under the banner of Scotland's National Party\\". This suggests that there were sympathetic individuals working for or in ownership of the Viewforth at this time. The Lino-Cuts on the front cover of the books were done by Jimmy Dewar who was an art teacher at Linlithgow Academy.  Links to the organisation from the Scottish National Party  The books were published by the SNP's publications department, following the second edition of the first book. On page one of said book, there is an 'Obtainable from' heading, which mentions all the places the book can be bought from, including the Learig, William Kellock of Bo'ness, Glasgow Song Guild, Angus Mcgillvery of the SNPs publications department, but also the SNP's headquarters on 59 Elmbank Street Glasgow. All their following publications are the same. An advertisement for Angus Mcgillveray's painting and decorating business' features on page 39 of the first songbook, and again in the following additions. There are numerous political advertisements in their publications.  Legacy  Simon Mckerrel of Newcastle University argues that Bo'ness is one of the key sites in the history of the folk revival in Scotland. He makes the point that this growth in the 1950s and 1960s may have been instrumental in the upsurge of Scottish nationalism during this time which ultimately led to the 1979 referendum. The Bo'ness Rebels are often cited in books looking at the Scottish folk revival. On 17 February 2011, the ‚ÄòLets Get Lyrical‚Äô festival in Edinburgh, featured a show called ‚ÄòRebel Shenanigans‚Äô, which was an event which would ‚Äúre-create the sounds of the Bo‚Äôness Rebels Ceilidhs of the 1950s, a movement in favour of a Scottish Republic.‚Äù In 2016, a show called ‚ÄúFrom Thurso to Berwick‚Äù celebrating the songs and poetry of Morris Blythman (aka Thurso Berwick) who wrote many of the songs in the Ceilidh Songbooks was put on at the Scottish Storytelling centre in . He also wrote the ‚ÄòSangs O the Stane‚Äô songbook which as mentioned earlier was available in Bo‚Äôness. Blythman was also behind a lot of the Republican songs associated with the Glesga Song Guild. Alastair McDonald was the main musician involved in this show and in the subsequent year of 2017 released a CD with nineteen of Blythman‚Äôs tracks on it. In 2017, Alastair McDonald released the album \\"The Rebels Ceilidh\\" which features a nineteen songs which were in the Songbooks, mostly ones contributed by Morris Blythman. The front cover also features Jimmy Dewar's illustration from the front cover of \\"The Rebels Ceilidh Song Book No.2\\" The Original Rebels Ceilidh Song Book and Rebels Ceilidh Song Book No.2 sit in the Library of Congress Washington DC. The first book is also available in the New York Public Library system.

Taxonomy  Crenadactylus occidentalis was first described in a taxonomic revision in 2016 of rare and poorly known geckos of the genus Crenadactylus, assembling evidence of greatly under-estimated speciation previously only recognised as subspecies of monotypic genus. One of four new species to emerge from molecular studies that had reported chromosomal distinctions that indicated the population's divergence around twenty to thirty million years ago. The holotype was collect by Brad Maryan and Robert Browne-Cooper during April in 1992 at Dirk Hartog Island. Crenadactylus ocellatus, found in a wider distribution of Southwest Australia, has also been referred to as the western clawless gecko. Prior to the revision in 2016, the population had been identified as two 'forms' found at adjacent ranges in the western regions of Australia and tentatively recognised as subspecies C. ocellatus ocellatus (southwestern clawless gecko) and C. ocellatus horni (central west coast clawless gecko).  Description  A species of Crenadactylus, all of which differ in subtle details of their appearance but with deep divergence in the genome that indicates long periods of geographic isolation (20‚Äì30 mya). C. occidentalis has a relatively wide head and medium size, the snout vent length is recorded as 32.6 millimetres. The base colour over the body is tan and light brown. The striping common to the genus is distinctly contrasted, occasionally broken by spots where a few scales are yellow or white.  Distribution and habitat  Records of Crenadactylus occidentalis are at altitudes less than 100 metres asl. The distribution range of the species is restricted to sub-coastal and coastal habitat in Western Australia, from Carnarvon to the south beyond the Northwest Cape to Yardie Creek. The range includes offshore areas near Carnarvon and at Shark Bay on Dorre and Berniers. The vegetation type of their habitat is composed of grass mounds of spinifex country and low coastal shrub-lands, dominated by banksia and acacia species. C. occidentalis has been located in waste piles associated with recent human habitation of the rural region.  Conservation status  The IUCN has classified the species as least concern and notes the species is located within at least one conservation zone of an extensive area of coastline. No specific conservation plan has assessed and evaluated threatening factors to the population, although the species is recognised for the purposes of conservation assessment. The quality and area of extent is noted as declining. Crenadactylus occidentalis is thought to be uncommon, although the lack of specific research, surveys and former position as a hidden species within Crenadactylus leaves some uncertainty about its population structure.

They resemble other species of the genus Crenadactylus, tiny clawless Australian geckos found across a large area of the continent, but has persisted as an ancient lineage in a region of the northwest.  Taxonomy  Unrecognised as a species before 2016, the first description was published in a revision of the genus that elevated the subspecific ranks of a single species and published this as one of three new species. The vernacular and specific epithet, pilbaraensis, refers to the only region in which it is recorded, the Pilbara craton in the northwest of Australia. A common name for the species is Pilbara clawless gecko.  Description  The coloration is distinguished by their small size and contrasting light and dark stripes that appear along the length of the body. A large scale at the chin is characteristic of Crenadactylus pilbarensis.  Habitat and range  Crenadactylus pilbarensis occurs at arid habitat characterised as stony gullies and slopes of hills in association with spinifex, mounds of vegetation formed by Spinifex and Triodia species occupying rocky outcrops in the Pilbara region. The known range extends beyond the Pilbara craton to the Burrup Peninsula and is recorded at Dolphin Island.  Conservation status  Crenadactylus pilbarensis is listed at the IUCN with the conservation status as non-threatened, while noting it as new and poorly known species lacking evidence to the contrary there are no apparent threatening factors. Fire may impact local areas without affecting the trajectory of the population, and the wide distribution range reduces the species vulnerability to rapid ecological changes. C. pilbarensis is known to occur within two areas listed as protected by conservation legislation, Karlamilyi National Park and Meentheena Conservation Reserve.

Early life Ricketson was born in Malvern, Victoria, to Sophia Henrietta (n√©e Sheppard) and Henry Joseph Ricketson. He was named after his paternal grandmother Georgina Staniforth. He had ties to stockbroker Jonathan Binns Were on both sides of his family ‚Äì Were was his mother's maternal grandfather and his father's step-grandfather. Ricketson attended Prahran North State School, where he was dux in 1905. He subsequently attended Wesley College for two years on scholarships, before leaving school in 1907. He worked as a jackaroo for a period and then became a correspondence clerk with the Australian Mercantile Land & Finance Company. In 1909, Ricketson moved to King Island with his brother Lancelot. They ran the Ricketson Bros. general store and Staniforth edited The King Islander, a local newspaper. The following year he became a reporter for the North Western Advocate and Emu Bay Times. =World War I= Ricketson enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in August 1914, as a private in the 5th Battalion. He took part in the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915 and was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) for his leadership that day, after all the officers and NCOs in his company became casualties. He was commissioned as a lieutenant on 27 April, and later mentioned in despatches. Ricketson received a glancing bullet wound in June 1915 and a shell blast in August left him partially deaf. He was evacuated to England for health reasons in October, and returned to Australia on leave in February 1916. He arrived back in England in September and was promoted captain in January 1917, subsequently serving on the Western Front. Business career Ricketson had joined the family stockbroking business J. B. Were & Son in 1911 and was admitted as a partner in 1914. After the war, the firm consolidated its market share and in 1928 established Were's Investment Trust Ltd, which later became the Australian Foundation Investment Company (AFIC). The firm also backed the National Reliance Investment Company in 1929, the Capel Court Investment Trust in 1936, and the Jason Investment Trust in 1937; its holdings became known as the Capel Court group of companies. Ricketson's firm promoted and underwrote share offerings for many large companies. From 1936 to 1939 he chaired the holding company for The Argus and The Australasian. His career extended into the 1950s and 1960s. Politics Ricketson came to prominence politically during the Great Depression as an opponent of default on national debt and supporter of debt restructuring (known as \\"loan conversion\\" at the time). In late 1930, he and his friend Robert Menzies assisted the loan conversion campaign that acting treasurer Joseph Lyons had initiated to allow Australia to meet its obligations to international financiers. At the time, Lyons was a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). Ricketson had \\"grown increasingly impatient with the dysfunction of Labor's caucus through 1930\\". He became the leader of the so-called \\"Group of Six\\" (or simply \\"The Group\\") which helped convince Lyons to leave the ALP and eventually become the figurehead of the anti-Labor United Australia Party (UAP). Ricketson had first met Lyons while in Tasmania in 1911. The Group met with Lyons regularly in early 1931 and became \\"the spine that held the diverse groups together to create the UAP\\". In May 1931, Ricketson became the temporary secretary of the central council of the UAP's Victorian section. After Lyons led the UAP to victory at the 1931 election, the Group's influence declined and Ricketson was one of the only members to remain close with the new prime minister. Ricketson was a strong advocate of separating the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's central banking and commercial banking functions. According to the Australian Dictionary of Biography, \\"the establishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia in 1959 has been attributed in part to his influence and persistence\\". Personal life Ricketson married Mary Gwendolyn Brown in April 1916, while home on medical leave from the army. The couple had six children together, before divorcing in 1945. Ricketson remarried in October 1946 to his secretary Edna Letitia Holmes, with whom he had another two children. He died at his home in Kew on 6 December 1967, aged 76.

Designed by Michael Henderson in the early 1960s and built by Newbridge Boats Ltd from 1963, the boat's shallow draft (when sailing) of less than three feet allows the boat to sail with versatility in even the shallowest of waters. When under motor, the dagger boards and twin rudders can be lifted, reducing the draft to just 8 inches. This allows the boat to operate easily in tidal areas and beach for quick loading and unloading of crew and equipment. The boat is 20 feet (6.10m) long and has a beam of just over 8 feet (2.44m), allowing four or more adults to comfortably sail for extended periods of time. The front cabin area, on both the Mk I and Mk II versions allows the stowing of food, equipment and clothes out of the elements, facilitating longer passages where conditions may change unexpectedly. However, there are some problems with the early version of the Cracksman 20; whilst the boat did grow popular fast, this was more due to its sailing performance than the interior amenities (or lack thereof). Michael Henderson and Newbridge Boats Ltd decided to launch a successor model, the Cracksman 20 Mk II, which along with some minor structural and rigging differences, aimed to address the lack of interior amenities and improve the possibility of overnight passages and passages of a greater length.  Versions  Since its early designing in the 1960s by Michael Henderson, two versions of the Cracksman 20 have been developed, as follows below: = Mark I = The Cracksman 20 Mk I (see photo above) was the early version of the Cracksman 20 sailing catamaran. Unlike its successor, the early Cracksman's interior was open and empty, allowing easy storage of equipment. A partial length trunk cabin, extended with the use of a canopy, allows the interior space some shelter from the elements, and also helps to increase the size of the 'cabin' from a fairly minimal one to one of a decent size. Whilst both models of the Cracksman 20 are rigged in the form of a sloop, the early version opted for a fractional rig as opposed to the more powerful masthead rig. = Mark II = The Cracksman 20 Mk II included a far more meaningful interior, with four berths included as standard as well as other features such as a cooker and sea toilet. The boat also featured a more substantial 'trunk cabin' which provided the extra space needed for the addition of internal features. The open rear to the trunk cabin that was observed on the Mk I was replaced instead with a sealed off rear with trunk boards fitted. As well as the physical differences to the vessel, the Mk II also differed in rigging to the Mk I; Henderson opted for a more powerful masthead rig which featured a foresail that went to the top of the mast, as opposed to the fractional rig whose foresail only goes partly up the mast. = Similarities = Both vessels are rigged with an aft mainsheet and an adjustable traveller, the latter of which allows the boat to cope with weather helm. A large anchor well is present in the bow of both the Mk I and Mk II boats, allowing the user to stow the anchor out of the way of the foresail. Whilst the Mk I uses a fractional rig and the Mk II uses a masthead rig, both have a genoa as a foresail, however storm jibs are fitted when sailing in extreme circumstances. Both boats are made of fibreglass and feature wooden liftable, remove-able rudders and dagger boards.

It is found in the northeastern Pacific Ocean at depths down to about . It usually lives in a mutualistic symbiosis with a sponge, or sometimes a hydroid.  Description  Pagurus dalli has a smooth, partially calcified carapace up to long, and a curved abdomen. The legs are light tan with white stripes, and it is the broad white band on the merus segment of the chelae (claws) that gives this hermit crab its common name. The dorsal surface of the carapace has a network of white, red, light and dark brown markings and is rimmed with red, and the flagellae (terminal segments) of the second pair of antennae are reddish-brown and white.  Distribution  This hermit crab is native to the northeastern Pacific Ocean, its range extending from the Bering Sea to Oregon, but is not particularly common anywhere. Its depth range is from the low intertidal zone to a depth of about , and it is found on sandy or muddy substrates or on gravel.  Ecology  Like other hermit crabs, P. dalli uses an empty gastropod mollusc shell to protect its soft parts, primarily its abdomen. It usually lives symbiotically with a sponge such as Suberites ficus or Suberites latus, which overgrows and eventually dissolves the shell. The sponge benefits from the crab's ability to move away from predators such as nudibranchs, while the crab may benefit from the sponge's unpalatability and the camouflage it provides. P. dalli has been found enveloped in a similar way by the colonial hydroid Schuchertinia milleri. After the hydroid has dissolved the shell its semi-calcareous matted structure acts as a substitute. Being encrusted by a hydroid colony seems to deter predation by octopuses. Pagurus dalli is one of several species of hermit crabs in the infraorder Anomura that the parasitic barnacle Clistosaccus paguri uses as a host. A female cyprid larva of the parasite injects some cells into the crab's abdomen at any stage in the crab's moulting cycle. These develop internally sending out root-like growths into the host's tissues, and later developing an external, stalked protuberance housing the parasite's reproductive organs; its presence effectively castrates the host by causing the host's gonads to diminish in size.

It was the 54th edition of the Amstel Gold Race and the 18th event of the 2019 UCI World Tour. Teams As the Amstel Gold Race was a UCI World Tour event, all eighteen UCI WorldTeams were invited automatically and obliged to enter a team in the race. Seven UCI Professional Continental teams competed, completing the 25-team peloton. Pre-race favourites The main bookmakers' favourites before the race were Mathieu van der Poel, who was set to make his debut in the Amstel Gold Race, and Julian Alaphilippe. Both cyclists had already been successful in the early season, with Van der Poel winning Dwars door Vlaanderen and the Brabantse Pijl and Alaphilippe taking the victory in Strade Bianche and Milan‚ÄìSan Remo. Other riders seen as contenders included Michael Matthews, Peter Sagan, Maximilian Schachmann, Alejandro Valverde and Jakob Fuglsang, as well as former winners Philippe Gilbert and Micha≈Ç Kwiatkowski. Defending champion Michael Valgren also participated, but was not seen as a favourite due to his disappointing start of the season. Race summary Early in the race, a breakaway group of 11 riders escaped the peloton. Their lead would grow to eight minutes before Jakob Fuglsang's Astana team increased the pace in the peloton. Mathieu van der Poel was the first of the favourites to attack at 43 km to the finish together with Gorka Izagirre, but their attempt was brought back by the peloton soon after. Julian Alaphilippe was the next to attack after the early breakaway was caught, joined by Fuglsang and Matteo Trentin. Trentin was unable to follow the other two and would be joined by Micha≈Ç Kwiatkowski, with a chase group containing most of the favourites following shortly behind them. After the final ascent of the Cauberg, Alaphilippe and Fuglsang had a lead of 30 seconds over the two chasers and nearly a minute over the group behind. With 3 km to go their lead was up to 40 seconds over Kwiatkowski, who had left Trentin behind. At that point, the two in front stopped collaborating with each other, attempting to conserve energy for their final sprint. However, they were then caught in the last kilometer, first by Kwiatkowski and then by the other chase group led by Van der Poel. In the ensuing sprint, Van der Poel proved to be the strongest, while the other podium places were taken by Simon Clarke and Fuglsang.

A native of Cocalico, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, Bentz was the son of Reverend Peter Bentz and Anna Maria Caffroth Bentz; his father, an itinerant farmer, joiner, and unordained Lutheran preacher, committed suicide in 1818, and his mother was forced to raise him on her own. He became a schoolmaster in the vicinity of Ephrata. Shortly before his death, Peter had established a school on the family land, and Samuel taught there for much of his life, living in the school building. Much of his fraktur was birth records, which he produced to augment his income. Some pieces refer to Mount Pleasant, and Bentz was designated the \\"Mount Pleasant Artist\\" until a bookplate with his signature was discovered. At his death, he left behind a box with eighteen frakturs. Much of Bentz's work is distinguished by its bold lines and the use of architectural elements as decoration, almost Greek Revival in style. Sometimes a human face is included; more often, a clock face, with its implications of memento mori, will appear. Sometimes he wrote the tetragrammaton into his paintings, an unusual inclusion for a fraktur artist, especially given his background as a member of the Reformed Church. Also unusually, he rarely included Bible verses in his work. Six works by Bentz are in the collection of the Winterthur Museum, including a cutout piece. His work has also been forged.

He then published articles in Jeune Afrique on the Sudan Civil War in 1997, and a photographic reportage on Yemen, le Y√©men, un pays en armes, published in the monthly Arabies in November 1999. After returning to France, he studied at Institut pratique du journalisme (IPJ), graduating in 1999. = Early career = Nicolas H√©nin started working at Infomedia, only to resign in November 2002 to work as an independent in Iraq. He reported for several months on the runup to the Iraq War and later for the whole of the conflict, notably for Radio France. He then reported on the aftermath of the Invasion, first in Baghdad until September 2004, and then from Amman, where he sought a safe location upon request from the management of Radio France, following the abduction of Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot. He then went on to reporting about Africa and the Middle East for several French-language media, such as Le Point, Arte, Radio France, RTBF, Radio T√©l√©vision Suisse, Radio Canada, Marianne and L'Hebdo. He worked as a chief operator for images and as researcher for the documentary film Tonnerre roulant sur Bagdad, by Jean- Pierre Krief, broadcast on Arte for the tenth anniversary of the invasion.

Nicolas H√©nin has been nominated several times for the Bayeux- Calvados Awards for war correspondents in radio (2004 and 2011), TV reporting (2008) and printed press (2013). = Abduction by ISIS and captivity in Syria = On 22 June 2013, agents of ISIS abducted H√©nin as he was on assignment at Raqqa, along with photographer Pierre Torr√®s. The abduction was initially kept a secret upon request of H√©nin's and Torr√®s' families, before being publicised by French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault on 9 October 2013. French authorities reported that signs of life had been recorded in August and October 2013. In captivity, H√©nin met with other hostages, notably US journalist James Foley. A number of support actions and demonstrations organised notably by the \\"Hostages in Syria\\" committee were held to push for H√©nin's and Torr√®s' liberation, as well as that of Didier Fran√ßois and Edouard Elias, who had been captured on 6 June. H√©nin's Alma mater IPJ (Institut pratique du journalisme) named its 34th class after him. The four hostages were eventually freed on 18 April 2014. Although litte information was released on H√©nin's conditions in captivity, he stated that he had escaped after three days, on 22 June 2013, but had been recaptured after a night trying to flee. On 26 April 2014, the German weekly Focus stated that France had paid 18 million dollars to secure the hostages' freedom. In Septembre 2014, after the allegations were made in Le Monde, H√©nin confirmed that Mehdi Nemmouche, suspected in the Jewish Museum of Belgium Shooting, had been one of his guards in Syria and had treated him with brutality. = Reporting on Jihadism = In September 2014, he was awarded the Fondation May Chidiac Award for courage in journalism. In March 2015, he published the essay Jihad Academy on policy mistakes against ISIS, and Papa h√©risson rentrera-t-il √† la maison?, a children book illustrated by his fellow hostage Pierre Torres. During an interview in the TV show On n'est pas couch√©, he chastised the policies of the Obama administration towards Syria. In 2018, a group of Syrian refugees identified 35-year-old Kais A., also known by his nom-de-guerre \\"Abu Hamza al- Kimawi\\" (\\"the Chemist\\"), a terrorist and explosive expert of the Islamic State, infiltrated in Germany in the guise of a Chemistry student at the University of G√∂ttingen. Abu Hamza having been instrumental in H√©nin's and Torres' capture by ISIS in 2013, the group contacted them. H√©nin forwarded the information to the French anti-terrorist jurisdiction, who had Abu Hamza arrested by the German police in order to be extradicted to France. = Reporting on Russian connections in France = In 2016, H√©nin published La France russe, enqu√™te sur les r√©seaux Poutine (\\"Russian France: investigation into Putin's networks\\") in which he argues that \\"Russian intelligence services spend as much resources on France as they used to during the Cold War\\" (\\"les services de renseignement russes consacrent √† la France autant de moyens que lors de la Guerre froide\\"), and that \\"just like when the Komintern was active and the Soviet Union would buy support from 'brotherly Parties', Moscow today still buys her supporters\\" (\\"comme du temps du Komintern, o√π l‚ÄôUnion sovi√©tique finan√ßait des 'partis fr√®res', Moscou ach√®te aujourd‚Äôhui ses soutiens\\"), and states that politicians such as Nicolas Sarkozy, Fran√ßois Fillon, Jean-Luc M√©lenchon and Marine Le Pen have been \\"seduced\\" by putinism. H√©nin notably gave an account of the first meeting between Nicolas Sarkozy and Vladimir Putin, where he claims that Putin had bullied and intimidated Sarkozy into such a state of shock that he seemed drunk during the press conference immediately following the event. Amongst the critics of the book, Tigrane Y√©gavian argued that H√©nin overstates influence of Moscow, which he deems to be far weaker than US soft power and support networks, and called the description of Putin's and Sarkozy's meeting oulandish; Jean-David Levitte, an advisor to Sarkozy, also dismissed this account. = Fight against hate speech and cyberbullying = In February 2019, H√©nin was targeted by a cyberbullying operation organised by far-Right accounts. H√©nin had reported Patrick Jardin, father of a victim of the November 2015 Paris attack, after Jardin had first demanded French Jihadists captured in Syria be summarily shot instead of brought back to France to stand trial, and then, in a tweet of 31 January, demanded their children be killed as well: \\"Then let us kill their children as well, that is where we should start\\" (\\"Alors tuons aussi leurs enfants, d‚Äôailleurs on devrait commencer par l√†\\"). Nicolas H√©nin reacted by calling upon witnesses to report the tweet to Twitter moderators and to Pharos, the French authority where illegal activity on the Internet can be reported: \\"Please report this account to Twitter and Pharos. Having lost a child in terrible circumstances is no excuse for such a torrent of hate\\" (\\"Merci de signaler ce compte √† Twitter et Pharos. Avoir perdu son enfant dans des conditions terribles n‚Äôest pas une excuse pour d√©verser un tel torrent de haine\\"). In retaliation, several far-Right Twitter accounts came in support of Jardin and issued death threats against H√©nin and his children. H√©nin filed charges. H√©nin heads Action R√©silience, a consulting company specialised in anti-terrorism and de-radicalisation. On 16 September 2019, H√©nin was promoted to Knight of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

The church was commissioned by Sir Robert Throckmorton, 8th Baronet, in the years after the Catholic Emancipation Acts which would re-allow the profession of the Catholic faith officially for the first time since the Tudor period. The church currently holds Grade II listed status.  History of the Church  The Throckmorton family had remained Catholic even after the formation of the Church of England and the break from Rome in the 1530s starting with the Act of Supremacy in 1534. The family had remained recusant Catholics, celebrating Mass in the saloon of Coughton Court, which acted as a chapel.The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1509-1558, ed. S.T. Bindoff, 1982. Article: THROCKMORTON, Sir George (by 1489-1552), of Coughton, Warws. Evidence of this recusancy are still evident in the houe today. A double priest hole is present in the tower of the house, elucidating the role the house played in the celebration of the Catholic faith in this period. After the move towards Catholic emancipation, Sir Robert Throckmorton, 8th Baronet, commissioned the building of a new church on the grounds, after the original church on the estate had been re-dedicated to the Anglican faith. This was done to celebrate the new found freedoms for Catholics in Britain which included the ability to build non-Anglican places of worship in Britain. The church was commissioned by Sir Robert Throckmorton, 8th Baronet, in the 1850s. This followed the movement towards Catholic emancipation in Britain after the ending of discriminatory rules and laws against Catholics. The house was built with an accompanying presbytery. The Catholic architect Charles Hansom was chosen to design the church. He was the brother of J A Hansom, designer of the Hansom cabs. Hansom designed the church with a notably thin tower, which is based upon Irish church architecture. The original plans for the church are held with the Throckmorton papers in the Warwickshire Record Office. Stone for the church was quarried from the Throckmorton's estates. The church was only formally opened in 1857 to be used by the family and other Catholics within the area. The northeast chapel also serves as the family pew, with a separate entrance. The carved stone pulpit and font date from the mid-1850s. The east window stained glass is by John Hardman between 1855 and 1862. The organ in the west gallery was built by Henry Bevington of London in around 1855. Interior of St Peter, St Paul and St Elizabeth, Coughton  Present-Day Church  The Coughton Court estate was transferred to the care of the National Trust in 1946. The church is currently cared for in conjunction with the National Trust and the Catholic Historic Churches Trust, but is still recognised as being privately owned. The church hosts masses, and is served by Our Lady and St Joseph Parish, Alcester. The church is recognised as being at risk by Historic England, with a number of issues which currently need addressing. The owners of the church have however expressed a desire to address these issues. The church contains the Stations of the Cross, as well as a number of statues including ones which depict the Virgin Mary. A set of images adorns the ceiling above the altar. The sanctuary of the church was remodelled during the 1960s to fit the new liturgy of the Mass introduced during the Second Vatican Council. This included the reordering of the sanctuary and the moving of the altar to allow the priest to face the congregation. This was a key change introduced by the Second Vatican Council.

He recorded the 1950s song \\"Rock, Pretty Mama\\", recognized as \\"a seminal rockabilly classic\\" by critics. Other songs he recorded in the 1950s include \\"You Heard Me Knocking\\", \\"True Love Will Come Your Way\\", and \\"You Gotta Have a Duck Tail\\". He toured with his family band for decades and, as his rockabilly interest declined, he entered the ministry and wrote Gospel songs. He made a comeback late in his career when a collection of 27 of Adams' songs was released in 2002. Fans re-embraced his rockabilly music 45 years after the original recordings, igniting demand for his appearances at music festivals in U.S. and Britain. Adams died March 30, 2019, at age 79. Early life He was born in Redbush, Kentucky, one of 14 children. His father was a coal miner at the Van Lear Coal mine in Kentucky. As a youth, he had no money for instruments; he strummed a lard bucket lid, pretending it was a guitar, while listening to Bill Monroe on the Grand Ole Opry. At age 12, Adams borrowed a neighbor's guitar to perform on the radio for the first time on WCMI in Ashland, Kentucky. He formed his first band at age 14 called \\"The Rock & Roll Boys\\", soon renamed \\"The Rock-A-Teers\\". Career Influenced by Elvis Presley's style heard on the radio, Adams formed a band in 1954 consisting of his brother Charles (guitar) and Curtis May (upright bass). Encouraged by local entertainer Luke Gordon, Adams went to Cincinnati in 1957 to record his composition \\"Rock, Pretty Mama\\", called by music writer Lorie Hollabaugh \\"a seminal Rockabilly classic\\". It was released on an independent label, Quincy Records, and the original 45rpm record is sought-after as a collector's item. The recording was included on a Sanctuary/BMG compilation album in 2003 called \\"Rockabilly Riot \\" along with songs by Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Roy Orbison. Brian Setzer used a similar title in two of his albums including the 2014 album \\"Rockabilly Riot! All Original \\" which pays homage to this original compilation but features all-new rockabilly songs. In 1961, Adams married Freda Lousie Riffe; they had three daughters, Tina Maria, Teresa Louise and Janetta Darlene. They formed a family band toured together for decades. In 1965, Adams changed his direction and went into Christian ministry. He wrote gospel and country songs including the gospel tune, \\"I Saw The Man\\", by the Happy Goodman Family. After his early rockabilly career faded and his focus had turned to religious music, his recordings from 45 years prior began a resurgence of popularity and were released by MCA, Bear Family and Ace Records. In 2002, he recorded a comeback album at Sun Studio in Memphis, called \\"Legacy \\", which received critical acclaim. In 2002, the U.K.'s Sanctuary Records released \\"Billy Adams‚Äì Rockin' Thru The Years \\", a 27-song compilation of his rockabilly career. This helped re-energize his career and he was asked to perform at Austin's \\"South by Southwest\\" and other music festivals in the U.S. and the U.K. in his later years. He received the Kentucky Colonel commission by the State of Kentucky. His wife died of cancer in 2007 and he remarried in Sue Justice in 2010, who survived him.

European in origin, Brechall came to the Thirteen Colonies sometime before the American Revolution, in which he fought; an 1818 pension application states that he enlisted in April 1777 and reenlisted until 1783. During the war he saw action at the battles of Short Hills, Brandywine, and Monmouth, among others, and was also present at the surrender of Charles Cornwallis. Later in life he became a schoolmaster in Weisenberg Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. He produced baptismal certificates for children in the neighborhood, residents of about a dozen towns in Lehigh and Berks Counties. A handful of pieces from Penn Township, at the time in Northumberland County, also exist, suggesting that he may have worked in the vicinity for a time; other pieces have also been found in Schuylkill County. Brechall's work is typical of the style; however, he had certificates of his own design printed to speed the decoration process along, and he signed many of these, in the process becoming among the first fraktur artists to be named. Most of his pieces are painted in a palette of red and black, using hearts and rectangles as design elements. Sometimes he would add decoration such as an angel's head or an eagle, or a crown containing the alphabet. Besides baptismal certificates he designed a house blessing, a prayer for children, and presentation frakturs, many for the children he taught. He lived in an area inhabited mainly by members of the Lutheran and Reformed Churches, and consequently his art was produced for members of both faiths. Five works by Brechall are owned by the Philadelphia Museum of Art. A Child's Prayer of Thanksgiving is owned by the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Other work is in the collections of the Library of Congress, the Free Library of Philadelphia and Franklin and Marshall College.

Women earned the right to vote in Spain in 1933 as a result of legal changes made during the Second Spanish Republic. Women lost most of their rights after Franco came to power in 1939 at the end of the Spanish Civil War, with the major exception that women did not universally lose their right to vote. Repression of the women's vote occurred nevertheless as the dictatorship held no national democratic elections between 1939 and 1977. The Franco regime imposed changes around women's suffrage, namely as it related to the need for women to be heads of household and around women's age of majority. Originally, the age was 23, but this was reduced to 21 in 1943 provided women were no longer living with their parents; otherwise the age of majority was 25. Several national referendums were held in Spain, where women could vote if they were over the age of 21, for example in 1942, 1947 and 1966. Women could, under certain conditions involving age and marital status, vote in municipal elections. They could also run in municipal elections. Dolores P√©rez Lape√±a was one such women, winning in Valladolid in the 1963 elections. The first national elections in which women could vote took place in 1977, two years after the death of Franco. Despite this, there were legal ambiguities in the democratic transition period over married women's right to vote as Article 57 of the Civil Code said women needed to obey their husbands. It was not clear if this applied to their voting rights until 1981.  History  = Francoist period (1939‚Äì1975) = The first time all Spanish women could vote in elections for the national legislature was on 19 November 1933 during the Second Spanish Republic. These women would only be able to vote in national elections one more time, in 1936. This period ended with the Spanish Civil War and the official start of Francoist Spain in 1939. Between 1939 and 1976, the opportunities to vote on the national level were nearly non-existent in Spain. There were three national referendums, and two elections for attorneys to represent families in the courts. There were also eight municipal elections. Because of controls by the dictatorship, elected municipal and legislative officials were limited in the changes they could enact. Women nominally maintained the right to vote, one of the few rights carried over from the Second Republic to the Francoist period. Universal suffrage existed in Spain during the dictatorship, but the only time people could vote was during referendums and for municipal officials. While direct voting was allowed, repression of women still existed as only the head of household could vote. This largely excluded women, as only widowed women were generally considered heads of household. Women's suffrage also changed because of rules around the age of majority and the voting age. The age of majority for women became 23 as a result of the imposition of the reintroduction of the Civil Code of 1889, Article 321. This changed in 1943, when the age of majority was lowered to 21 so as to be consistent for both genders. An additional clause still stipulated women did not reach majority until they were 25 unless they were married or joined a convent. No elections or referendums took place in the period between 1939 and 1944; despite legal changes in the age of majority, women continued to be disenfranchised as the dictatorship did not hold elections. The voting age for women appeared to change again in 1945, when the age for some women was lowered to 18. According to Article 5 of the Decree of 29 September 1945, voters included, \\"Spaniards, neighbors and people over 21 years, or emancipated people over the age of 18, men or women, under whose dependence other persons coexist in the same home.\\" Most public efforts around franchising of women in this period were based on regime attempts to be perceived abroad as more democratic, and did not necessarily lead to greater numbers of eligible voters or meaningful and free elections that could result in undermining the regime. The Cortes Espa√±olas was created in 1942, to act as a pseudo-representational body. Selection for the body was done indirectly, through other political organs of the state, including state-sanctioned unions, city councils and state-run businesses. The 1942 Referendum Act stated in Article 2, \\"The referendum will be held among all the men and women of the Nation over twenty-one years [...]\\" Municipal elections entailed three categories. These included union elections, corporate and entities, and family representatives. The first municipal union elections took place in 1944. The union elections of 1944 were broadly boycotted by many union workers who were skeptical of the regime's actions. These elections were controlled by Franco through the right-wing Falange. UGT and CNT continued to boycott union elections into the 1950s and 1960s, as they saw them as legitimizing the regime. Elections were not a threat to the regime as they had control over who could run. The regime's continuing was assured as Emilio Lamo de Espinosa, civil governor of M√°laga, explained saying that it had been created \\"by the effort of a war and only an action of equal but opposite meaning can ruin our political continuity.\\" Alejandra Bujedo Fern√°ndez and Mar√≠a Pilar Zarzuela Plaza were the first female candidates for a municipal union election in Valladolid but they did not run until 1970, and were joined by Esperanza L√≥pez Delgado who ran for one of three corporations and entities positions. A referendum on the Succession Law of 1947 was held, with women being allowed to vote. The new law prohibited women from being allowed to succeed the Spanish throne. Voter turnout was alleged by the regime to be 100%. Government propaganda poster featuring Francisco Franco asking for the affirmative vote in the 1966 referendum. Madrid held municipal elections in 1948, the first such elections since the end of the Civil War. Only heads of household could vote, which disenfranchised most women. Voters had few options, all of them involving right-wing candidates, mostly Falangists, who belonged to official parties or who were unofficial candidates. Records show there was an abstention rate of 40%. The Madrid municipal elections of 1954 had the same conditions as 1948 for voting. The candidates were primarily made up of official party candidates and monarchists who had become disconnected from the regime. While allowing these right wing monarchists to run, the Government used all its available tools to discourage voters from supporting them. Voter abstention in these elections was 67%. The votes for the official party candidates ranged between 7,000 and 22,000 while the highest number of votes for a monarchist candidate was 7,600. The 1963 municipal elections for corporations and entities positions in Valladolid saw Dolores P√©rez Lape√±a come out victorious. Only three people were elected into this position, and she won along with Rafael Tejedor Torcida and Juan Ignacio P√©rez Pell√≥n. It was the first time since the Spanish Second Republic that a woman had been elected to office in the city. She told the local newspaper, El Norte de Castilla, at the time, \\"For the first time, women have to be represented in their thoughts and concerns before their City Council by another woman.\\" Her concerns as an elected official included \\"displacement from the towns before the industrial growth of the city.\\" They also concerned \\"her daily concerns [about the woman] of the market, her situation in some distant places, its supply, transport.\\" She would win again in the 1966 elections. Mar√≠a Teresa √ç√±igo de Toro and P√©rez Lape√±a also ran in those elections, with P√©rez Lape√±a emerging victorious. The 1966 Spanish organic law referendum gave universal suffrage to all citizens over the age of 21.Referendum 1966. Nueva Constituci√≥n. Madrid: Servicio Informativo Espa√±ol (Ministerio de Informaci√≥n y Tursimo), 1966. Citizens were so confused about who could vote in this election, that a newspaper needed to explain, stating: \\"All Spanish citizens over twenty-one years of age, without distinction of sex, state or profession, have the right and obligation to take part in the referendum vote, freely casting the ballot for or against the legislative draft consulted.\\" This referendum was little more than the regime trying to get the electorate to support its policies while appearing more democratic. Among the people who went to the polls were 103-year-old Benigna Medrano from Avila and groups of cloistered nuns. In the 1966 referendum in Alicante, some districts with high numbers of older people and women had lower turnout rates than younger districts with more male voters. The 1967 Law on Family Representation allowed women to vote, but only if they were the head of their household. Voter turnout was alleged by the regime to be 90%. Secci√≥n Feminina played a critical role in advancing changes to the 1955 Ley de Regimen Local about the role of married women in 1968. Consequently, married women were allowed to vote and run in local elections. Married women would get the right to vote in national referendums in 1970. The 1967 municipal elections were the first to allow direct election. In Madrid, the election was again dominated by Falangist candidates, and politically rebellious Francoists. The abstention rate was 44.3%. Municipal elections also took place in 1970 and 1973. The 1971 Madrid municipal elections had an abstention rate of 68.3%, higher than the national average of 50%. Voters in the region were extremely skeptical of the regime, and did not turn out. Abstention for many voters was a way of expressing anti-Francoist sentiment. Law 31/1972 changed in respect to Articles 320 and 321. It reduced the age of majority to 21 in all cases for women, and allowed women to act as an adult in civil life. Article 320 now read, \\"The oldest age begins at 21 years of age. The adult is capable of all acts of civil life, apart from the exceptions established in special cases of this Code.\\" = Democratic transition period (1975‚Äì1986) = Toledo during the 1977 Spanish general elections. Reproduction of the poster of the Referendum for the Law of Political Reform of 1976. 1978 Spanish constitutional referendum ballot. The first national elections held in Spain following the death of Franco in 1975 took place in 1977. For the first time since the Second Spanish Republic, women were fully franchised. For many women, these elections were a hopeful moment and represented a milestone in the democratic transition. Many felt that they had been neglected for too long by the state. A referendum was held in 1976 over the proposed 1977 Political Reform Act.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p1824 77.8% of heads of households voted, with 94.17% voting in favor. In Madrid, 22% of voters submitted blank ballots or null votes, higher than most other regional capitals. Spaniards between 18 and 21 years of age were not eligible to vote. The 1945 national referendum voting rules were applied, with both men and women being allowed to vote. On 16 November 1978, Royal Decree-Law 33/1978 modified the age of majority for all women, with Article 320 then stating, \\"The age of majority begins for all Spaniards at eighteen years of age.\\" This was reaffirmed in the 1978 Spanish Constitution in Articles 12 and 14. Article 14 gave men and women full legal equality under the law. Article 12 confirmed an age of majority and voting age of 18 for everyone. No women took part directly in writing the new Spanish constitution, so gender discrimination continued to exist within Spanish law. The 1978 Constitution and the Spanish Civil Code enshrined discrimination against women, specifically against married women. Article 57 of the Civil Code stated, \\"The husband must protect the woman, and she must obey the husband.\\" This was viewed as conflicting with Article 322 of the Civil Code which stated, \\"The adult is capable for all acts of civil life, apart from the exceptions established in special cases by this Code.\\" There were other questions about what this implied, and if it meant women were obligated to obey their husbands when it came to how they should vote. The Cortes made changes in the Civil Code in 1981, but none explicitly addressed the issue of whether women were obligated to vote as their husbands told them. These changes in 1981 did however make it explicit that men and women were equal in marriage and allowed women the ability to divorce their husbands.

She moved to Beirut in 1982, during the Lebanese Civil War, and worked as a free-lance journalist and translator in association with several newspapers, including the Lebanese English-medium Monday Morning (Beirut); the Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun (Osaka); the Arabic Lebanese weekly al-Kifah al- Arabi (Beirut); The New York Guardian; the International Herald Tribune; the Atlanta Journal-Constitution; and the Philadelphia Inquirer. At the time of her death she was finishing a PhD dissertation at Penn on popular Arabic theater, under the supervision of the Arabic literary scholar and translator, Roger Allen. =Prisoner advocacy= As a longtime human rights activist, associated with Amnesty International and other organizations, Stevens advocated for prisoners of conscience. In the early 1970s she researched cases of political prisoners in Tunisia under the regime of Habib Bourguiba. A colleague later attributed the release of several Tunisian prisoners to her efforts. While living in Tunis in the 1970s, Stevens also participated in an activist, leftist theater group. This group performed Arabic plays in private homes, streets, and markets for popular audiences. She was married during this time to the Tunisian playwright Taoufik Jebali, who years later wrote dialogue for the acclaimed 1990 film of F√©rid Boughedir, Halfaouine: Boy of the Terraces. =Palestinian advocacy= While living in Beirut in 1982 and 1983, Stevens frequently visited the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps and became an advocate for the Palestinian residents, who were mostly refugees of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and their descendants. Writing under the pseudonym June Disney, she published, for example, an article on the Israeli use of cluster bombs and other advanced explosives in the war in Lebanon, and the injuries that Palestinians (including children) in the Burj al-Barajneh camp sometimes sustained when they encountered them or picked them up. During this time she also volunteered at two of the refugee camp hospitals, called Akka Hospital and Gaza Hospital. The writer Kai Bird observed that some people at the time considered her a \\"partisan journalist\\" while others suspected her of working for an intelligence agency. She befriended Dr. Fathi Arafat, the medical doctor who founded and directed the Palestine Red Crescent Society. She knew Fathi‚Äôs brother, Yasir Arafat, who was chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and she interviewed him on several occasions. The Palestinians called Stevens \\"the little drummer girl\\" because of her staunch support for their cause. In 1982, she gave the British novelist David Cornwell, also known as John le Carr√©, a tour of the Sabra and Shatila camps. Stevens inspired the title of John le Carr√©‚Äôs novel The Little Drummer Girl, which was published in 1983, made into a film in 1984, and developed as a BBC/AMS television miniseries in 2018. According to one source, Stevens and Le Carr√© became friends; he consulted her on possible sites for filming in the region; and she was reportedly scheduled to fly to Cyprus to see him a day after the bombing in which she died. The writer Kai Bird claimed that on August 8, 1982, shortly before Yasser Arafat's departure for Tunis, Stevens visited Arafat in his bunker, begged him not to leave with his PLO fighters, and warned him of the dangers the Palestinian women and children would face if left alone in the camps. Bird traced this account of Stevens‚Äôs meeting with Arafat to Imad Mughniyah, Arafat‚Äôs bodyguard at the time, who went on to become a leader in Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shi'ia Islamist militant party. Mughniyah later orchestrated a string of kidnappings and attacks, including the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut of October 1983, the hijacking of TWA flight 847 in June 1985, the bombing of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires in March 1992, and the bombing of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in June 1996. =Sabra and Shatila massacre= One month after the withdrawal of the PLO fighters to Tunis, on September 16‚Äì18, 1982, a massacre occurred in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camp in southern Beirut. This massacre was the work of the Phalange, a mostly Maronite Christian right-wing militia, which acted with the knowledge of allies in the Israel Defense Forces, including Ariel Sharon, in order to uproot residual PLO elements at a time when Israeli forces were poised to enter West Beirut. Stevens toured Sabra and Shatila immediately after the massacre; witnessed the Red Crescent's efforts to collect the dead bodies, some of which, she reported, showed evidence of rape and mutilation; and interviewed survivors.  Death  =Embassy bombing= According to UCC Palestine Solidarity Campaign, a group of students and staff at University College Cork (Ireland) engaged in recording the history of Palestinian political advocacy, Stevens went to the U.S. embassy on the day of her death to urge William McIntyre, Deputy Director of USAID in Lebanon, to pledge more U.S. aid to Palestinian refugees and Lebanese Shi‚Äôa groups in Lebanon. According to the University of Pennsylvania's Almanac, Stevens had also been serving as an interpreter to an Arab delegation to the embassy. Stevens and McIntyre were lunching together in the embassy cafeteria when a truck carrying 2,000 pounds (900kg) of explosives crashed into the building and detonated. Seven floors in the middle of the building collapsed and \\"pancaked\\". The bombs killed 63 people, including 32 Lebanese and 17 Americans. At least eight of the dead were officers of the Central Intelligence Agency, including Robert Ames, the CIA‚Äôs leading Middle East expert. The remainder were Lebanese staff and others. About 120 more people were injured. Stevens and McIntyre died instantly in the explosion. Stevens‚Äôs former employer, Shigeo Arata, Beirut correspondent for the Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun, later identified her body in the hospital morgue of the American University of Beirut. Stevens was pregnant at the time of her death. Franklin Lamb, who later became executive of the Sabra and Shatila Foundation, identified himself as her partner and claimed that they were expecting a baby boy when she died. =Embassy memorial= Stevens was among the Americans honored at a memorial service for the victims of the U.S. embassy bombing, which was held at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. U.S. President Ronald Reagan spoke at the service. Stevens's brother, Scott Stevens, later testified before a federal court that the U.S. government charged her family $2,100 to bring her body back from Beirut, because she was not an embassy employee. Bombing aftermath =Recognition of bombing survivor PTSD issues= Of the people like Stevens who had been eating lunch in the U.S. embassy's cafeteria in Beirut on April 18, 1983, only two survived the bombing. One of these survivors, diplomat Anne Dammarell, wrote a 1994 Georgetown University MA thesis in which she argued that the bombing caused the American Foreign Service Officers posted in the embassy to experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms \\"similar to those faced by war veterans\\" but at a time when the U.S. State Department \\"did not provide sufficient training and follow-up support to allow them to recognize, acknowledge, and fully process the trauma\\". Dammarell collected questionnaires from other embassy survivors, one of whom, a USAID officer named Letitia Kelly Butler (\\"Tish Butler\\"), later recalled that the Defense Attach√© asked her to identify bodies in the makeshift morgue in the hospital basement. Butler recalled: \\"I saw Janet Stevens, the long-haired journalist, who had been interviewing Bill McIntyre in the cafeteria. She was in a corner with a military guy. He had his hands up and she was almost in a macabre death embrace\\". Butler added that seeing the bodies of Stevens and others was \\"the worst part of the whole event for me\\" and that it \\"seared images of bodies and body parts on my consciousness\\". The Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training (ADST) later cited Dammarell‚Äôs study for pointing to the lack of adequate support from the U.S. State Department in preparing diplomats for trauma, offering mental health services after incidents, and establishing long-term, follow-up procedures for PTSD survivors. The ADST also suggested that Dammarell's study contributed to changes in policies. =Lawsuit against Iran= The Islamic Jihad Organization claimed responsibility for this attack. This organization had links to the Lebanese Shi‚Äôa party, Hezbollah, and operated with support from the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which objected to Israel‚Äôs invasion of southern Lebanon in June 1982 in response to PLO attacks. Twenty years after the bombing, Anne Dammarell encouraged the family of Stevens, representing one of eighty plaintiffs of the dead and injured, to join a civil suit in U.S. Federal District Court of Washington, DC against the Islamic Republic of Iran and its Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). The hearing of this case, Dammarell v. the Islamic Republic of Iran, began on September 8, 2003 and cited evidence that agents of the Iranian government had supported, funded, and planned the embassy attack. Among those who testified were Stevens's identical twin sister, Jo Ann Stevens, and her brothers Hazen H. Stevens and Scott C. Stevens. Lawyers for the plaintiffs connected the embassy bombing attack to other events in which they claimed Iranian government complicity: the suicide bombing of the U.S. Marine Corps in Lebanon in October 1983; the assassination of Malcolm Kerr, president of the American University of Beirut, in 1984; the bombing of the U.S. Embassy Annex in East Beirut, Lebanon, in September 1984; and the kidnapping between 1982 and 1991 of 50 hostages who included American, British, French, and German nationals. In Dammarell vs. the Islamic Republic of Iran, the court of Judge John D. Bates decided on May 12, 2005 for the plaintiffs and ordered Iran to pay damages, including $13,449,000 to members of the Stevens family, including her three siblings, the estate of Stevens, and the estate of her late father, Hazen Stevens. The Iranian government did not respond to the case, and did not pay. =Other similar cases= On April 28, 2015, the journalist Kai Bird, writing in The New York Times, discussed Dammarell v. the Islamic Republic of Iran (2003), in conjunction with a second case, Peterson v. the Islamic Republic of Iran (2007). The latter case was filed by one thousand plaintiffs, relatives of the 241 people killed in the bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks on October 23, 1983. Bird argued that the failure of the Iranian government to pay settlements in both cases would pose for the administration of U.S. president Barack Obama \\"a major stumbling block to any diplomatic resolution of Washington‚Äôs troubled relations with Iran\\" at a time when the member states of the U.N. Security Council were negotiating over Iran‚Äôs nuclear program (see Iran Nuclear Deal Framework). Bird also claimed that Ali Reza Asgari, the Iranian Revolutionary guard identified as having masterminded the embassy attack in which Stevens and others died, later defected to the United States. Without citing his sources, Bird claimed that President George W. Bush authorized granting asylum and witness protection to Asgari in return for information about the Iranian nuclear program. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) rejected Bird‚Äôs claims through a spokesperson. Claims about Asgari continued to surface, as in a March 10, 2019 article in The Hill that urged President Donald J. Trump to expose details that could bear upon the kidnapping of the former FBI agent and CIA consultant Robert Levinson who disappeared in Iran in 2007. New evidence surfaced in 2020, however, which suggested that Levinson had died in Iranian custody some time before.  Legacy  During her time as a doctoral student at Penn, Stevens introduced her mentor, Roger Allen, to the novels of the Saudi-Iraqi writer, Abdul Rahman Munif. In 1987, Roger Allen published a translation of Munif's Endings, and dedicated it to Stevens's memory. =Stevens Memorial Fund= Friends, family, and professors established a Janet Lee Stevens Memorial Fund at the University of Pennsylvania. The fund intended to honor Stevens‚Äôs legacy of fostering cultural understanding vis-√†-vis the Arab world. Professor Thomas Naff originally administered the award, following a nomination procedure which awarded an individual outside the university a $1000 prize for promoting Arab-American understanding. The first winner of this award, in 1986, was Gail Pressberg of the American Friends Service Committee. The second winner of the Janet Lee Stevens Memorial Award, in 1987, was Edward Said, the Palestinian-American literary and music critic, political advocate, and theorist of Orientalism. In 1993, the winners of this award were Jack Shaheen, journalist, professor of mass communications, and author of the book Reel Bad Arabs (about Orientalist portrayals of Arabs in American cinema) and Grace Halsell (journalist and author of Journey to Jerusalem and other books). Beginning in 1996, when George McGovern, Senator of South Dakota and 1972 Democratic party nominee for U.S. President, came to speak at Penn, the Janet Lee Stevens Fund supported an annual lecture series. Other distinguished speakers included Professor John L. Esposito, founding director of the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown University, who lectured on \\"The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality\\" in 2003. The final speaker in the series in 2005 was the Palestinian-Israeli-American musician Simon Shaheen. Shaheen is a composer and performer of oud and violin, who also directs the Arab Music Retreat, an annual program of Arabic music hosted at Mount Holyoke College to promote cultural understanding through the study and performance of classical and neoclassical music from Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Jordan. Since 2002, the Janet Lee Stevens Fund has supported an annual grant program at the University of Pennsylvania for an MA or PhD student who demonstrates academic excellence, a commitment to Arabic study, and a record of promoting cultural understanding. It was originally called \\"The Janet Lee Stevens Award for the Promotion of American-Arab Understanding\\". Past winners include the literary scholar John Joseph Henry (\\"Chip\\") Rossetti, translator of works including Bahaa Abdelmagid‚Äôs novellas Saint Theresa and Sleeping with Strangers (American University in Cairo Press, 2010); the folklorist Dana Hercbergs, author of Overlooking the Border: Narratives of Divided Jerusalem (Wayne State University Press, 2018); the political scientist Murad Idris, author of War for Peace: Genealogies of a Violent Ideal in Western and Islamic Thought (Oxford University Press, 2019); and the sociolinguist Uri Horesh, co-editor of The Routledge Handbook of Arabic Sociolinguistics (Routledge, 2019). =Awards and recognition= The Washington DC Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for promoting human rights and democracy in Iran features Stevens in its database called \\"Omid, a Memorial in Defense of Human Rights in Iran\\". Founded in 2002, this database originally included people whom it described as \\"victims of the Islamic Republic\\" and its human rights abuses since 1979, and also by all Iranian governments since December 10, 1948, when General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the UN Declaration of Universal Human Rights with Iran as a signatory. Peace Monuments around the World listed Stevens among \\"77 Notable Peacemakers in Palestine and Israel\\".

A specialist sprinter, he was unraced as a juvenile and did not win a race until the August of his four-year-old campaign. In 2016 he made steady progress, winning three handicap races before taking the Listed Beverley Bullet Sprint Stakes. He won two minor races in 2017 and in the following year he recorded his biggest success when he won the Group 1 Nunthorpe Stakes. Background Alpha Delphini is a bay gelding bred in England by Mrs B A Matthews. In 2012 the yearling was consigned to the Tattersalls October Yearling Sale where he was bought for 20,000 guineas by Oliver St Lawrence Bloodstock. He entered the ownership of The Alpha Delphini Partnership and was sent into training with Bryan Smart at Hambleton, North Yorkshire. He is the best horse sired by Captain Gerrard, a sprinter who won the Cornwallis Stakes in 2007 and the Palace House Stakes in 2008. Alpha Delphini's dam Easy To Imagine never raced but was a successful broodmare who also produced the Prix de l'Abbaye winner Tangerine Trees. Her grand-dam Emmaline was a half-sister to both Bates Motel and the San Antonio Handicap winner Hatim as well as being closely related to the Kentucky Oaks winner Optimistic Gal. Racing career =2014 & 2015: early career= Alpha Delphini was gelded as a two-year-old in 2013 and did not race that year. He made a belated racecourse debut in October 2014 when he finished unplaced in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Redcar Racecourse. In 2015 he ran second in a maiden at Doncaster Racecourse in May and fifth in a similar event at Hamilton Park Racecourse in June. On 29 August the gelding started at odds of 5/1 for a maiden over five furlongs at Beverley Racecourse and recorded his first success as he won by one and a half lengths from Grand Beauty. On his final run of the year he came home fifth in a handicap race at Pontefract Racecourse in October. =2016: five-year-old season= In 2016, Alpha Delphini was ridden in all of his races by Connor Beasley and began his campaign by carrying 130 pounds to victory in a minor handicap at Musselburgh Racecourse on 24 April. In May he finished fifth and third in similar contests at Thirsk and Pontefract respectively. On 8 July Alpha Delphini was assigned a weight of 137 pounds for a handicap at York Racecourse and finished strongly to win by a head from Gamesome. Two weeks later he followed up in a more valuable handicap at Ascot Racecourse, wearing down the long time leader Final Venture to gain the advantage in the last stride and win by a short head. The gelding was then stepped up in class to contest the Listed Beverley Bullet Sprint Stakes on 27 August and started the 13/2 second favourite behind Muthmir (King George Stakes) in a ten-runner field which also included Kingsgate Native, Maarek (Prix de l'Abbaye) and Final Venture. After tracking the leaders Alpha Delphini finished strongly and got up on the line to win in a \\"blanket finish\\" by a neck, a short-head and a nose from Willytheconqueror, Muthmir and Final Venture. He was then moved up in class again for the Group 3 World Trophy at Newbury Racecourse on 17 September and sustained a narrow defeat as he went down by a short head to the four-year-old Cotai Glory. =2017: six-year-old season= For the first half of the 2017 season Alpha Delphini was matched against top class opposition and struggled to make an impact. He finished eighth to Marsha in the Palace House Stakes at Newmarket, third to Priceless in the Temple Stakes at Haydock Park, sixth to Lady Aurelia in the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot and ninth to Battaash in the Coral Charge at Sandown Park. He was then dropped back in class and started favourite for a minor event at Hamilton, but was beaten three quarters of a length by the filly Glenrowan Rose. After this race Beasley lost the ride on the gelding and was replaced by Graham Lee, a former National Hunt jockey best known for winning the 2004 Grand National on Amberleigh House. The change of jockey brought about no immediate improvement as Alpha Delphini ran unplaced in the Nunthorpe Stakes and then came home seventh behind Take Cover when attempting to repeat his 2017 success in the Beverley Bullet. On 25 September Alpha Delphini started 5/4 favourite for a minor race at Beverley and recorded his first win of the season as he took the lead inside the final furlong and held on to prevail by a neck from Line of Reason. In a similar race at Musselburgh in October Alpha Delphini ended his season with another victory as he took the lead approaching the last quarter mile and won by a length at odds of 6/5. =2018: seven-year-old season= Alpha Delphini began his 2018 season by finishing second to Kyllang Rock when favourite for a minor race at Musselburgh on 31 March and then ran a close third behind Mabs Cross and Judicial in the Palace House Stakes. He was narrowly beaten in his next two starts, going down by a short head to Muthmir in the Achilles Stakes at Haydock after leading for most of the way and then failing by a head to run down Mr Lupton in the City Walls Stakes at York in July. On 24 August Alpha Delphini ran for the second time in the Nunthorpe Stakes and started a 40/1 outsider in a fifteen-runner field. On Lee's recommendation it was decided to run the horse without the cheekpieces he had worn in most of his recent races. Battaash started favourite ahead of Blue Point with the other fancied contenders including Mabs Cross, Mr Lupton, Sioux Nation (Phoenix Stakes), Judicial, Havana Grey (Sapphire Stakes), Washington DC (Phoenix Sprint Stakes), Take Cover and Judicial. After tracking the leaders down the centre of the straight Alpha Delphini moved up to dispute the lead entering the final furlong with his main challenge coming from Mabs Cross who was racing up the stands side rail. The pair crossed the line together, finishing clear of Blue Point and Battaash in third and fourth. The finish was exceptionally close and the judge had to examine the photo-finish for ten minutes before declaring Alpha Delphini the winner by a nose. After the race Lee said \\"He'd been running really well, game as a pebble, and then when he's headed, he's been rallying like mad. I suggested leaving the cheekpieces off so that he could see them coming, and then you might not have to wait until they get past. The hardest part of riding him is usually going down to the start. It‚Äôs like trying to hang on to a bag of cement on a window sill but he was so relaxed today.\\" On his final run of the year, Alpha Delphini finished unplaced behind Mabs Cross in the Prix de l'Abbaye at Longchamp Racecourse in October. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prix_de_l'Abbaye_de_Longchamp Pedigree References 2011 racehorse births Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Thoroughbred family 9-f ","title":"Alpha Delphini (horse)"},{"id":"60437030","text":"Byambajavyn Javkhlant√∂gs (born 23 October 1959) is a Mongolian wrestler.

Initially formed to contest the 2009 South African General elections, the party grew and began running for elections itself. Women Forward's membership spans women, men, and LGBTQI people. Their mission is to \\"work towards a more inclusive world\\" for women. Missions include eradicating gender-based violence, improve sex education as well as getting more women in positions of government. Women Forward has caused controversies surrounding it's view on rapists as well as excluding sex workers on their platform. As of the 2019 South African general election, Women Forward has not won any seats in the National Assembly or Provincial Legislatures.  History  Ngobese was inspired to create Women Forward by her grandfather's advocacy for \\"female leadership\\"; he wrote about the immense influence a mother has on a child as well as how his wife edited every one of his speeches. Ngobese also says women are more naturally \\"caring\\" and \\"inclusive\\", making them better suited to be leaders. Ngobese worked as a gender consultant for a decade, and then joined the government. After becoming concerned about the lack of governmental concerns for gender issues, Ngobese decided to start her own political party. Women Forward was founded on June 25th, 2008, as an independent political party out of South Africa. The party contested the 2009 South African General elections, subsequently lost and lost their deposit in the process. The party's manifesto was launched in Rustenburg on March 30th, 2019.  Membership  Women Forward has over 30,000 members within South Africa. Most membership is centered out of Limpopo, South Africa. Membership is open to people who identify as LGBTQI. Men are also permitted to join, as long as they \\"listen more to women's ways of doing things.\\" Women Forward is also committed to actively recruiting \\"women of all races\\" to become members.  Mission  Women Forward's mission is to \\"help rebuild grassroots movement to advance women's agenda, democracy, freedom, peace, and justice.\\" The party has a manifesto that lays out its major points of interest. Their main issues are as followed: # Eradication of Extreme Poverty and High Unemployment Levels # Eradication of Gender Based Violence (GBV) due to High Levels of Crime # Introduction of Robust Sex Education for both boys and girls to combat teen pregnancy and other health hazards by pre-adulthood sex # Introduction of Targeted Education (Skills Development) for all women, including those 35 years of age and above # Addressing Land Ownership by Marginalized Women/Families # Focusing on the Environment and Sustainability for Community Wellbeing Their manifesto also has a \\"call to action\\", urging the people of South Africa to come together to empower women to help them \\"achieve self-determination.\\" Women Forward aims to achieve gender parity in the South African government by 2025.  Controversies  In March 2019, Ngobese said: > \\"I actually think rapists should be executed, but castration is the second > best. Rape is the worst of all crime and at the moment the law's response is > pitiful. Ngobese went on to say the party would advocate for the castration of rapists and child assaulters. Women Forward has also been criticized for not addressing how lack of resources due to capitalism stops women from accessing basic services and impedes their livelihoods. Women Forward also fails to recognize women who work in informal sectors, such as sex work, effectively excluding them. Critics have also claimed that Women Forward is not a feminist party, rather, promotes ideas about women that are detrimental and further bolsters the point that politics are only for men.

She formed the Auckland Home Birth Association, a lobby group for domiciliary midwives, was a founding member of the New Zealand Domiciliary Midwives Society, and is considered the unofficial founder of the New Zealand College of Midwives. Her book is Save the Midwife (1986). Donley's midwifery career spanned 21 years. She was active politically and argued that women should have the right to reject medicalised maternity care, and helped establish several organisations which promoted natural childbirth and an extension of the rights of midwives. Donley regarded home birth as a ‚Äòfeminist and a political act‚Äô by which women could reclaim their bodies from ‚Äòthe white, male-controlled obstetrics and gynaecology ... specialty which is trying to gain a complete monopoly of childbirth in New Zealand.

She took up nursing because she could not afford to study to be a doctor. She trained at Saskatoon City Hospital, graduating as a registered nurse in 1938 and taking a position with the British Columbia Coast mission at Pender Harbour soon afterwards. Her work there focused on tuberculosis, logging injuries, and childbirth. Carey married fisherman Robert (Bob) Fuhland Donley (1914‚Äì1992) in Vancouver on 22 November 1941. She left nursing to start a family, giving birth to her first child in 1942 and her fifth and last in 1957. The couple initially operated a fishing boat out of Pender Harbour, with Joan becoming one of the first women in the province licensed for hand-lining cod. In the mid-1940s they purchased 19 acres of uncleared land at Middle Point, Pender Harbour where they operated a sawmill and a smokehouse. The couple were active in seeking better roading, electricity, and educational facilities for their district. Life was work, and the marriage difficult, and at 39 Joan had a heart attack. She nursed herself back to health using natural remedies. In 1959 the couple shifted to a ten- acre property at Sechelt. In the early 1960s Joan edited the local newspaper, the Sechelt Peninsula Times, which provided an outlet for her causes and campaigns until she was fired for being too outspoken.  Emigration to New Zealand, early career, and education In 1964 the family decided to emigrate to New Zealand, motivated in part by fear of nuclear war and the growing influence of the United States in Canadian politics. They settled in Auckland and opened the Crescent Fish Mart in Grey Lynn in 1965. Joan left her husband late in 1969, and used family money from Canada to pay off the couple's debts and purchase a home in Mount Albert. She decided to become a midwife to support herself and her youngest son, the other children having left home. She undertook the six-month maternity training at National Women's Hospital in 1970 and completed her midwifery training at St Helen's Hospital in 1972, aged 56. She then worked as a midwife for two years at Waitakere Hospital.  Career  In 1974 an older midwife, Vera Ellis Crowther, persuaded her and Carolyn Young to leave the hospital environment and take over from her as domiciliary (home-birth) midwives. Women had been offered the choice of a free hospital birth or a midwife-assisted home birth since the late 1930s, but almost all women chose the hospital option. In 1970 there were just 87 home births in the whole country (0.13 percent of all births). The 1971 Nurses Act made it illegal for a midwife to provide maternity care unless a medical practitioner took responsibility for the mother during childbirth. Some doctors continued to support home births attended by midwives, and in 1974 Donley and Young were among the few domiciliary midwives practising in Auckland. Their practice covered an area from Albany to Papatoetoe. Donley's first home birth was that of her granddaughter, Mandy, in 1974. Donley attended up to 800 births over the course of her 30-year career as a home- birth midwife. She noted in 1986 that calls for assistance ‚Äòcome in clusters ‚Äì frequently around the full or new moon and when it‚Äôs dark and stormy. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs something to do with electromagnetic forces.‚Äô She used herbal teas, acupuncture, massage, and warm baths to help women give birth without medical intervention, and formed lasting friendships with many of the mothers. It was not a lucrative career, with the Health Department paying only $180 per birth in 1986. But Donley was not in it for the money; for her it was a crusade embedded in her political and philosophical beliefs related to socialism and feminism. Donley played a central role in setting up a series of organisations to promote the interests of domiciliary midwives. In 1978 she formed the Auckland Home Birth Association, a lobby group for domiciliary midwives. She was a founding member of the New Zealand Domiciliary Midwives Society, established in 1981 and soon accepted as a bargaining body by the Department of Health. At a 1988 meeting of the Midwives and Obstetric Nurses Special Interest Section of the New Zealand Nurses‚Äô Association, she argued that the section should be disbanded in favour of the formation of an independent College of Midwives to ensure the survival of midwifery as a profession. The New Zealand College of Midwives was founded the following year to represent all midwives, set professional standards, and oversee midwife education. A 2010 history of the college credited Donley as its ‚Äòofficial founder‚Äô; without her \\"amazing insight, conviction and energy‚Äô it would never have come into existence.\\"  Social and political activism  Donley's social activism found various outlets. She was active in the Citizens Association for Racial Equality and the New Zealand Peace Council by the late '60s, and in the early '70s she grew interested in communist China. She served as secretary of the New Zealand China Friendship Society, for which she ran a seminar in Auckland in 1974, and was involved in three tours of China. Her 1975 tour surveyed the women‚Äôs liberation movement in the Asian country, which she considered relevant to New Zealand's women‚Äôs movement. She noted, \\"the struggle for socialism is basic. Without that, women‚Äôs liberation is merely a dream.\\" She supported the New Zealand Communist Party as the only organisation correctly applying the principles of Chinese communism and encouraged other women to follow her lead. Donley's political views were directly relevant to her approach to the politics of childbirth. She viewed having a baby at home as a \\"feminist and a political act\\" by which \\"women rebelled against the technological takeover of their bodies\\" by male doctors and hospital nurses. She rejected the medicalisation of childbirth as \\"modern medical megalomania\\", demanding that women be free to choose to deliver their babies naturally and at home. She asked: \\"Whose body is it? Whose baby is it?\\"5 Donley encouraged mothers to be aware of the political issues. She was particularly critical of midwives who worked in hospitals, asserting that most of her country's midwives had become a \\"nurse-midwife, a hybrid, a medically-oriented handmaiden, while the real midwife is an endangered species.\\" She opposed the government policy of regionalisation of maternity services in the 1970s and 1980s, which involved closing some small maternity hospitals and basing operative, resuscitation, and neonatal technology in regional centres. Donley claimed that this policy was supported by multinational drug companies which made huge profits, and was a self-perpetuating system which guaranteed obstetricians and gynecologists \\"a monopoly of clinical material\\" ‚Äì that is, women. She opposed immunisation for similar reasons, seeing it merely as a \\"lucrative enterprise promoted by the pharmaceutical empires\\". She was supportive of the anti-vaccination campaigner Hilary Butler and the Immunisation Awareness Society she founded in 1988. She lobbied for professional recognition of midwives by the government and for direct entry into midwifery training (without the requirement to first train as a nurse). The 1990 Nurses Amendment Act gave midwives pay parity with doctors for attendance at childbirth and the right to practice independently. Tertiary institutions soon offered direct-entry midwifery courses. Donley had influenced this legislation by writing regularly to Health Minister Helen Clark, her local member of parliament. The 1980s was a decade of intense political campaigning for Donley. She published many articles and several books, notably Save the Midwife (New Women's Press, 1986), a polemical history of New Zealand midwifery. She networked with radical and home-birth midwives in the country as well as in Australia, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Ireland. In 1984 she traveled to the U.S. and Canada; the next year she attended a National Homebirth Australia Conference in New South Wales. She corresponded with the International Confederation of Midwives, and with the UK-based Association of Radical Midwives. In 1990 she attended an Invitational Forum on Midwifery Education and Practice, in Toronto. From the late 1980s Donley was active on the Auckland Women's Health Council. She kept a watching brief over developments in midwifery education and practice into the '90s, attending meetings, speaking at conferences and writing reports. She accumulated an extensive archive of offprints, reports, and newspaper clippings. She continued to show an interest in all aspects of feminine and children's health, with a particular interest in alternative medicine. She visited China again in 1992 to study the applicability of acupuncture and homeopathy to childbirth.  Later life  Donley's contributions to the politics of childbirth were publicly recognised in various ways. In the 1990 New Year Honours, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to midwifery, and was awarded both the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal and the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal 1993. In 1997, she was awarded an honorary master's degree in midwifery from the Auckland Institute of Technology, and in 2001 the New Zealand College of Midwives established the Joan Donley Midwifery Research Collaboration as its research arm. She retired from midwifery in 1995 after she was injured in a car accident. In 1998 the College of Midwives reprinted Save the Midwife as Birthrites: Natural vs Unnatural Childbirth in New Zealand. Donley declared in a new introduction, \\"After 50 years of being ‚Äúunder the doctor‚Äù it is difficult for women to overcome their fear-based medical dependence and opt to regain control of their bodies and their births.\\" She maintained her feminist principles to the end and died in Auckland following a stroke on 4 December 2005 at the age of 89. She is survived by her children, 12 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

It was established to meet the need for the growing population in the early twentieth century. The first burial took place in 1905, and the cemetery church, the , was consecrated in 1907. The cemetery was primarily a burial place for the poor, until the Second World War. During the siege of Leningrad, from 1941 to 1944, it was one of the main sites for burying those who were killed, or died of cold or starvation. At least 100,000 people were buried during this period, mostly in mass graves. The cemetery expanded after the war, and today covers 59 hectares. It contains the graves of a wide range of society, including military figures, and prominent people from the arts, sciences and sports. History By the late nineteenth century population growth in the Staraya Derevnya area, formerly on the outskirts of the city, was putting pressure on the existing cemeteries. The local clergy approached the Spiritual Consistory with a request to establish a new cemetery on church land. The Consistory passed the case to the Holy Synod, which approved a decree on 23 June 1903, setting aside 27 dessiatins for this purpose. The Provincial Office gave their permission, and a plot of land was set aside, initially a bare field behind railway tracks. The plot was fenced, drained and divided into eight sections, with the prices for graves ranging from three to forty rubles. The first burial at the cemetery took place on 28 May 1905. Burials in the pre-revolutionary period included opera singer and early aviator Nikolai Kostin. Funds were solicited in early 1905 for the construction of the cemetery church, with the Holy Synod advancing a loan of fifty thousand rubles, repayable over 10 years. A construction commission was established in early 1906, and on 25 July the foundation stone of the church was laid. was built in eighty-seven days to a design by , and was consecrated on 1 March 1907 in honour of Seraphim of Sarov, who had been canonized in the summer of 1903. Initially the cemetery was primarily a burial place for poor people, as well as soldiers and sailors who died in the First World War. The church remained open during the Soviet period, because of the \\"proletarian\\" background of those buried in the cemetery. During the Second World War the cemetery became a burial place for those who died during the siege of Leningrad. By one calculation one hundred thousand people were buried at the cemetery during the siege, though the true figure may perhaps be two or three times higher. The dead were buried in mass graves, often trenches that had been blasted out of the frozen ground with explosives during winter. When the siege was lifted the bells of the church rang for two days, the first time they had been heard since the Soviet government banned bell ringing in 1933. After the war the cemetery became one of the main burial locations for the city, and expanded significantly, eventually covering fifty nine hectares, and today is mostly full, with most interments being in existing family plots. New burials generally take place in the northern part of the cemetery. A new chapel, to Saint George, was built in 1999, the first stone being laid on 15 February 1999, the 10th anniversary of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. It opened that same year on 2 August, the Day of the Airborne Forces, opposite the Afghan War memorial, itself inaugurated in 1996, sponsored by the veterans' association Afganvet. Nataliya Danilova, of the University of Aberdeen, writes that \\"The unique character of the Cemetery is its ability to function as a place for both public commemoration and private grief.\\" She notes that \\"from the 1990s onwards, the Serafimovskoe Cemetery has functioned as a major regional site for military commemoration.\\" Memorials The memorial to those who died in the Siege of Leningrad A memorial to the victims of the siege was opened the right of the main cemetery entrance on 27 January 1965, the 21st anniversary of the lifting of the siege. A four-span portico sits on a high base, with five monumental sculptures depicting the defenders and workers of Leningrad. In front of the portico is a granite cube with an eternal flame and a platform paved with black labradorite. It stands on the site of sixteen mass graves from the time of the siege. The Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery is the usual place for the main commemorations of the siege, with the Seraphimovskoe Cemetery often commemorating other military events, including Victory Day on 9 May, the anniversary of the withdrawal from Afghanistan (15 February), the deaths of troops from the 76th Guards Air Assault Division in the Battle for Height 776 during the Second Chechen War (1 March), the Day of the Airborne Forces (2 August) and the foundation of the OMON (4 October). The cemetery contains many monuments dedicated to naval officers and professors of the Naval Academy. The few surviving graves from the pre-war period are located along one of the alleys, and include nuns and novices of the St. John Convent on the Karpovka River. Another section holds a number of graves of physicians and employees of the 1st Leningrad Medical Institute. There are also a number of communal war graves of soldiers of the Second World War, marked by white obelisks. A number of Heroes of the Soviet Union are also interred in the cemetery, among whom; , , , , , Ivan Yumashev, and . There are memorials to the dead of several tragedies, including the 1981 Pushkin Tu-104 crash, and the loss of the ships in 1982, Polessk in 1993, and Kursk in 2000. There are also memorials to the mountaineers who died in an avalanche on Lenin Peak in 1990, the firefighters who died in the 1991 fire at the hotel Leningrad and the dead of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. On 6 July 2019 the fourteen men who died in a fire aboard the submarine Losharik were interred in the cemetery. Interments The grave of Hero of the Soviet Union Admiral Ivan Yumashev Those buried at the Serafimovskoe Cemetery include naval officers Giorgi Abashvili, Vladimir Alafuzov, Ivan Yumashev, and Mikhail Zakharov. Other military figures interred in the cemetery include Soviet Air Force Lieutenant General Dmitry Alexandrovich Medvedev, two flying aces of the Korean War, Anatoly Karelin and Mikhail Mikhin, and Major General Sergei Ivanovich Tiulpanov, who commanded the Propaganda Administration of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany. Numerous sportspeople have also been buried here, among whom; Olympians Valentin Boreyko, Igor Novikov, Nikolai Panin, Nikolay Puzanov, Rinnat Safin and Gennadiy Tsygankov; and footballers Lev Burchalkin, Valentin Fyodorov, Vladimir Kazachyonok, Nikolai Lyukshinov, Nikolai Sokolov and Yevgeni Yeliseyev.

The cemetery on the northern slope of Kr√≥lewskie Wzg√≥rze (King's hill) on Romualda Traugutta Street is now a publicly accessible park. It is not a protected heritage site.  History The first Jews settled in Wrzeszcz, outside the gates of the city of Gda≈Ñsk in the 1680s. By 1765, the Jewish quarter in the area had 230 inhabitants. The cemetery was established in the middle of the 18th century. Until 1775, it was administered by the chevra kadisha of the suburb of . In 1775, administration of the cemetery was taken over by a newly established synagogue in the marketplace in Wrzeszcz, later known as the . This synagogue remained in use until 1887, when the Great Synagogue was opened for all the Reform Jews in Gda≈Ñsk. In 1814, during the Napoleonic Wars, the cemetery was largely destroyed and Wrzeszcz was incorporated into Gda≈Ñsk. The cemetery was re-established and restored to use in 1823. Under pressure from the National Socialist government of the Free City of Danzig, the Jewish community decided to dissolve itself at the end of 1938. To finance the emigration of the members of the community, the 'Israelite cemetery' in Wrzeszcz was sold. The final burial took place in January. Since then, and especially after the official closure of the cemetery in 1942, the graves have fallen into disrepair. Today, the 0.35 hectare area contains only seven tombstones, the oldest of which dates from the year 1823. For a long time it was rumoured that a stairway, called the 'Stairs of Shame' (), built on the hillside in the 1970s was made out of Jewish gravestones. In 2014, it was established that it is actually made of Christian tombstones.Schody do lasu: by≈Çy z nagrobk√≥w, sƒÖ z drewna trojmiasto.pl (poln.)
