It is credited as being the first purpose- built radio factory in the world. History Guglielmo Marconi had established his company offices at the former silk-works on Hall Street, Chelmsford in 1898. It was the world's first wireless factory, making maritime SOS equipment that played a vital role in ensuring the rescue of survivors from both the Titanic and Lusitania liners. But 14 years later, these were deemed too small for the expanding concern. Purchasing a plot of land on part of the old Essex County Cricket Club ground on New Street, Marconi commissioned architects W.Dunn and R.Watson to design a new purpose-built factory. From conception to completion, the project took only 17 weeks, with construction work commencing work on 26 February 1912. Providing of production space equipped with the latest tools and laboratories, the changeover between Hall St. and New St. happened in just one weekend. The Works were opened and ready for inspection on 22 June 1912 by the delegates of the International Radiotelegraphic Conference, each of whom was issued with a commemorative booklet. The site is credited with being the world's first purpose-built radio factory, giving Chelmsford the claimed title \\"Home of the radio\\". In 1919, two aerial masts were added to the site. In 1920, a number of licences were issued by the General Post Office in accordance with the Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1904, for the purpose of conducting experimental transmissions. The first occurred from New Street Works on 15 June 1920, featuring Dame Nellie Melba singing two arias and her famous trill, with the signal received throughout Europe and as far away as Newfoundland, Canada. The event today is commemorated by a blue plaque. In 1936–39, the art deco-styled factory and attached 5-storey Marconi House were completed, the later housing the factories offices. The company also opened the Marconi Research Laboratory in 1936, to bring together their various radio, television and telephony research teams in a single location.Birthplace of Radio , Invest Essex. Retrieved 13 October 2011 At its peak, the factory employed 4,500, while the Research Centre employed an additional 1,200 engineers. The Research Centre was also home to the original Marconi museum, containing numerous original artefacts from the pioneering period of Guglielmo Marconi's work on wireless telegraphy.The emergence of broadcasting in Britain, Brian Hennessy, John Hennessy, Post World War II, the Marconi company was bought by English Electric. In 1949 building 720 was added, which boasted the largest unsupported roof span in the United Kingdom, and also housed the new canteen. In 1999 the residual defence arm of Marconi was bought by British Aerospace to form BAE Systems, who still occupy the new building within the Marconi Research Centre to the west of the site. A residual part of the original company was sold-off in 2001 to Selex Communications, part of Italian- conglomerate Finmeccanica, who resultantly took over the New Street works the same year. In 2005, Selex announced its own move to a new factory in Basildon, completed in 2008, ending nearly 100 years of communications industry on the site. Present New Street Factory entrance with the blue plaque in 2018 Following de-occupation, Chelmsford Council successfully Grade2 listed four buildings on the site: 1912 New St building; New St Cottages; the powerhouse; the water tower. The art-deco factory, Marconi House and building 720 are not listed. Bought by Ashwell Property Group, the company fell into administration in 2008/9, with redevelopment due to start in 2010. The site was finally sold for redevelopment to Bellway Homes in the summer of 2012 with demolition of the majority of the site including the iconic Marconi House and Building 720 in April/May 2013. Only the Grade II listed water tower, The 1912 front building façade, the New Street cottages and the power house will remain. On 6 June 2008, Chelmsford Amateur Radio Society (CARS) set up an amateur radio station to commemorate the 96 years of production at the site, broadcasting under special callsign GB96MWT.

In addition, the UIM is found, often in tandem or triplet arrays, in a variety of proteins either involved in ubiquitination and ubiquitin metabolism, or known to interact with ubiquitin-like modifiers. Among the UIM proteins are two different subgroups of the UBP (ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase) family of deubiquitinating enzymes, one F-box protein, one family of HECT-containing ubiquitin-ligases (E3s) from plants, and several proteins containing ubiquitin-associated UBA and/or UBX domains. In most of these proteins, the UIM occurs in multiple copies and in association with other domains such as UBA (INTERPRO), UBX (INTERPRO), ENTH domain, EH (INTERPRO), VHS (INTERPRO), SH3 domain, HECT, VWFA (INTERPRO), EF-hand calcium-binding, WD-40, F-box (INTERPRO), LIM, protein kinase, ankyrin, PX, phosphatidylinositol 3- and 4-kinase (INTERPRO), C2 domain, OTU (INTERPRO), DnaJ domain (INTERPRO), RING-finger (INTERPRO) or FYVE-finger (INTERPRO). UIMs have been shown to bind ubiquitin and to serve as a specific targeting signal important for monoubiquitination. Thus, UIMs may have several functions in ubiquitin metabolism each of which may require different numbers of UIMs. The UIM is unlikely to form an independent protein domain. Instead, based on the spacing of the conserved residues, the motif probably forms a short alpha- helix that can be embedded into different protein folds. Some proteins known to contain an UIM are listed below: *Eukaryotic PSD4/RPN-10/S5, a multi- ubiquitin binding subunit of the 26S proteasome. *Vertebrate Machado-Joseph disease protein 1 (Ataxin-3), which acts as a histone-binding protein that regulates transcription; defects in Ataxin-3 cause the neurodegenerative disorder Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). *Vertebrate epsin and epsin2. *Vertebrate hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS). *Mammalian epidermal growth factor receptor substrate 15 (EPS15), which is involved in cell growth regulation. *Mammalian epidermal growth factor receptor substrate EPS15R. * Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly) liquid facets (lqf), an epsin. *Yeast VPS27 vacuolar sorting protein, which is required for membrane traffic to the vacuole.

A frequent visitor to Soho's Marquee Club and Flamingo Club he began working as a DJ at Basildon & Ilford Mecca ballrooms. At 19 years old he then turned professional and moved to Copenhagen and Stockholm to earn a full-time living as a club DJ. In the early 1970s, Doherty returned to London and secured a position in the post room at Island Records before becoming a road manager for music impresario Jo Lustig, working on tours for artists including Jethro Tull, The Chieftains and Richard & Linda Thompson, Nico & Fairport Convention. In the 1979 Doherty moved to Joe Boyd's Hannibal Records independent label as a press officer.  Live Aid  Doherty took charge of media for Bob Geldof's Live Aid concert in 1985. In 2005 he led public relations for the Live 8 concerts.  Laister Dickson  A 1989 takeover by Shandwick Plc. shifted the focus of Rogers & Cowan away from music so in 1990 Doherty left, taking with him three clients - The Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney and Tina Turner. He joined music PR firm Laister Dickson as a director reporting to founder of the company Wendy Laister. Five years later he acquired the company and became the CEO of the renamed LD Communications Ltd.

The 23-letter Latin alphabet belongs to the oldest of this group.  Encoding  The 26-letter ISO basic Latin alphabet (adopted the earlier ASCII) contains the 26 letters of the English alphabet. To handle the many other alphabets also derived from the classical Latin one, ISO and other telecommunications groups \\"extended\\" the ISO basic Latin multiple times in the late 20th century. More recent international standards (e.g. Unicode) include those that achieved ISO adoption.  Key types of differences  Apart from alphabets for modern spoken languages, there exist phonetic alphabets and spelling alphabets in use derived from Latin script letters. Historical languages may also have used (or are now studied using) alphabets that are derived but still distinct from those of classical Latin and their modern forms (if any). The Latin script was typically slightly altered to function as an alphabet for each different language (or other use), although the main letters are largely the same. A few general classes of alteration cover many particular cases: * diacritics could be added to existing letters; * two letters could be fused together into ligatures; * additional letters could be inserted; or * pairs or triplets of letters could be treated as units (digraphs and trigraphs). These often were given a place in the alphabet by defining an alphabetical order or collation sequence. These sequences can vary between languages. Some of the results, especially from just adding diacritics, were not considered distinct letters for this purpose. For example, the French é and the German ö are not listed separately in their respective alphabet sequences. Digraphs in some languages may be separately included in the collation sequence (e.g. Hungarian CS, Welsh RH). New letters must be unless collation is not practised.  Properties  = Letter inventory = Coverage of the letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet can be * complete * partial and additional letters can be * absent * present, either as ** letters with diacritics (e.g. (Å å) in the Danish alphabet) ** new letter forms (e.g. (Ə ə) in Azerbaijani alphabet) = Grapheme order = Most alphabets have the letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet in the same order as that alphabet. Some alphabets regard digraphs as distinct letters, e.g. the old Spanish alphabet had CH and LL sorted apart from C and L. Some Spanish dictionaries still list \\"ll\\" separately. Some alphabets sort letters that have diacritics at the end of the alphabet. Examples are the Scandinavian Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, and Finnish alphabets. Icelandic sorts some additional letters at the end, as well as one letter with diacritic, while others with diacritics are sorted behind the corresponding non-diacritic letter.

Willis, (born Howard Alan Willis on 15 November 1948), is an Australian essayist, critic and editor. Early life The son of a Lands Department inspector in Victoria, Willis was born at Colac and grew up at Apollo Bay, Kyneton and Ballarat. He subsequently lived in Darwin and Auckland, New Zealand (1970–80) and rural Tasmania before settling with his wife and two young sons in Perth in late 1981.http://www.austlit.edu.au/run?ex=ShowAgent&agentId;=A$Yq As a student at La Trobe University in the late 1960s, Willis was part of a group (which also included Philippe Mora, Peter Beilby, Rod Bishop and Demos Krouskos), that wrote and produced the first issue of Cinema Papers (October 1967). While studying at the University of Auckland, Willis was a founding member of Alternative Cinema, an Auckland film-makers’ cooperative established in 1972. He contributed articles to and edited several early issues of that group’s journal, Alternative Cinema. Willis later (1976) wrote an in-depth account of the New Zealand film industry for Cinema Papers. Career Willis (under the credit \\"Alan Willis\\") produced a half-hour television documentary, Stanley, filmed in October–November 1974 for the NZBC. The film concerned the twelve- day manhunt (in October 1941) for mass killer Stanley Graham. Based on his interviews with participants in the manhunt, and his access to the previously closed Police files, Willis wrote Manhunt, the most detailed account of the event. The feature film Bad Blood, based on his book,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0932345/ starred Jack Thompson and Carol Burns. In 2012, Willis returned to Hokitika, where Graham is buried. His account of his trip to Westland and the Graham story was published in the \\"Travel\\" section of The West Australian.http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/lifestyle/a/-/lifestyle/14270949/south- islands-buried-past/ South Islands buried past in online version: variant editing in newsprint version The Scene of the crime page 2 of travel section of paper of same date, 19 July 2012 Willis's 2012 visit to New Zealand also generated articles paying homage to the earthquake damaged city of Christchurch and the philosopher Karl Popper (a resident of Christchurch in 1937–45).http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/travel/a/-/more/14220345/christchurch- recovery/ Christchurch rising from the ruins in online version: variant editing in newsprint version Picking up the pieces pp 8-10 of travel section of paper of 14 July 2012 After settling in Western Australia, Willis worked as an archival researcher, film script assessor (WA Film Council, 1991–93), book editor and reviewer. Between 1989 and 2006, he wrote about 250 reviews for The West Australian, The Age and The Canberra Times.See, for example, reviews of Killing Mister Watson, by Peter Matthiessen, The Age, 15 September 1990; Invisible Invaders, by Judy Campbell, The West Australian, 20 July 2002; and The Historian’s Conscience, edited by Stuart Macintyre, The Canberra Times, 13 November 2004. He also wrote a number of longer articles on subjects that included the closure of the old Metters Limited stove factory in Perth, chronic pain, east European cultural and political history, cultural stereotyping,Eureka Street (as Howard Willis) and environmental issues.http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article.aspx?aeid=23033 In an essay on Colonial frontier violence he identified and reproduced the first known photograph (1865) taken in the Kimberley region. His essay on pain was selected as the Western Australian finalist for the MBF Health and Well Being awards for 1994. In 1994 he interviewed Tim Winton for Eureka Street; Winton later dedicated his novel Breath (2008) to Willis. Willis has been involved in two aspects of the Australian \\"History wars\\". When Keith Windschuttle published The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One (2002), Willis undertook a detailed analysis of the author's cited sources in order to dispute his figure for Tasmanian Aborigines killed during hostilities in Van Diemen's Land. In relation to that debate, Robert Manne described Willis as “a conservative scholar ... known for his scrupulousness”. In 2010, he joined the debate over the introduction and history of smallpox in Australia, arguing that the origin of the 1789 outbreak near Sydney was most likely from a Macassan introduction through Northern Australia. As a non-fiction editor, Willis prepared for publication (including the title) The Last of the Last (2009), the autobiography of Claude Choules, the last combat veteran of World War I. At the time of publication Choules was 108, making him the world’s oldest first time author.http://www.hesperianpress.com/index.php/booklist/2011-06-16-08-07-49/l-titles/456-last- of-the-last-the-claude-choules Other titles edited by Willis include From Kastellorizo (2006), Michael (Stratos) Jack Kailis’s memoir of his extended family, and Nurses with Altitude (2008), a collection of stories by Western Australian nurses of the Royal Flying Doctor Service.http://www.hesperianpress.com/index.php/booklist/2011-06-16-12-23-53/n-titles/249-nurses- with-altitude Between 1982 and 1991 Willis published eleven short stories in various literary journals, including Overland, Australian Short Stories, Brave New Word, 'Going Down Swinging, The Weekend Australian, and Island Magazine.

Introduced by Lethem et al. in 1983, this model helped explain how these individuals experience pain despite the absence of pathology. If an individual experiences acute discomfort and delays the situation by using avoidant behavior, a lack of pain increase reinforces this behavior. Increased vulnerability provides positive feedback to the perceived level of pain and rewards avoidant behavior for removing unwanted stimuli. If the individual perceives the pain as nonthreatening or temporary, he or she feels less anxious and confronts the pain-related situation. Avoidant behavior is healthy when encouraging the individual to avoid stressing injuries and permitting them to heal. However, it is harmful when discouraging the individual from activity after the injury is healed. The resulting hypervigilance and disability restricts normal use of the tissue and deteriorates the individual physically and mentally. Once the avoidant behavior is no longer reinforced, the individual exits the positive feedback loop. In 1993, Waddell et al. developed a Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) which showed that fear-avoidance beliefs about physical activities are strongly related to work loss.  Examples  = Anxiety sensitivity = Anxiety sensitivity is the fear of the symptoms of anxiety. An example of the fear-avoidance model, anxiety sensitivity stems from the fear that the symptoms of anxiety will lead to harmful social and physical effects. As a result, the individual delays the situation by avoiding any stimuli related to pain-inducing situations and activities, becoming restricted in normal daily function. = Chronic pain = Chronic pain is another example that can originate from the drastic misinterpretation of pain as a catastrophe. As a result of this misinterpretation, the individual repeatedly avoids the pain- inducing activity and will likely overestimate any future pain from such activity. The excessive sensitivity to pain discourages the individual from exercise and weakens his or her body. Criticisms Research involving the fear-avoidance model has led some to question its accuracy in representing or predicting the actual avoidance of physical activity due to negative reinforcement. In certain cases, the individual completely avoids anxiety- inducing behavior, so that the fear response never becomes directly involved. Other factors affecting the perceived level of danger and spatial awareness further complicate the model. While the fear-avoidance model may be simplistic for every situation involving fear, discomfort, and/or chronic pain, its effectiveness is generally acknowledged for diagnosing and understanding how humans positively or negatively react to fear and anxiety.

It was closed after World War II, with all flight operations being moved to the Greenwood County Airport north of the city.  History  Chinquapin Airport, also known as Greenwood Municipal Airport and Johnson Field, was built in the mid-1930s by the Works Progress Administration. It replaced a smaller Greenwood Municipal Airport which was built in the late 1920s that was being encroached by the city of Greenwood. It had two grass or dirt runways, reportedly 2,300' & 2,000' long. The fixed-base operator (FBO) at the airport was Johnson Air Services, which operated a flying school at the airport. In 1940, the school began government-sponsored flight training. Both flight instruction and ground school training were conducted for CAA pilot licensing using about 15 Piper J-3 Cubs. The civil flight training continued at the airport even after the United States entry into World War II. Beginning about 1944, the United States Army Air Forces supplied civil flight instructors under contract to screen potential air cadets for military flight training bused in from nearby Erskine College. This was part of a program to reduce the failure rate at the military flight schools. The Air Force supplied about 10-15 instructors, and each of the flight screening classes consisted of about 60 potential flight cadets. With the end of the war, the Air Force closed Coronaca Army Airfield north of Greenwood, and it was subsequently deeded to Greenwood County in 1947. Flight operations were then moved to the former military training school, it being reopened as Greenwood County Airport. Chinquapin Airport was closed, the property sold in 1948 and the land was redeveloped into a housing development. The hangars at the airport were moved to the new airport. The runways were subsequently converted into streets. One runway is now Marietta Drive, and the other is Westgate Drive, with houses built along each side of the streets.

It is the work on which Chalmers' fame as a biographer mainly rests. Background The Dictionary was an enlarged edition of the New and General Biographical Dictionary, which was first published in eleven volumes in 1761. Other editions of this compilation appeared in 1784 and in 1798–1810. The latter, in fifteen volumes, was edited (first five) by William Tooke, and (last ten) by Archdeacon Nares and William Beloe. Then Chalmers's edition had as full title The General Biographical Dictionary: containing an historical and critical account of the lives and writings of the most eminent persons in every nation, particularly the British and Irish, from the earliest accounts to the present time. The first four volumes of this work, in octavo, were published monthly, commencing in May 1812, and then a volume appeared every alternate month to the thirty-second and last volume in March 1817, a period of four years and ten months of incessant labour and of many personal privations. The preceding edition of the \\"Dictionary\\" was augmented by 3,934 additional lives, and of the remaining number 2,176 were rewritten; while the whole were revised and corrected. The total number of articles exceeds nine thousand. For many years Chalmers was employed by the booksellers in revising and enlarging the \\"Dictionary\\"; but at the time of his death only about one-third of the work, as far as the end of the letter D, was ready for the press. Chancellor Christie remarked that \\"Chalmers's own articles, though not without the merit which characterises a laborious compiler, are too long and tedious for the general reader, and show neither sufficient research nor sufficient accuracy to satisfy the student.\\" Sources The Dictionary gives references in footnotes at the end of most articles; Saxii's Onomasticon is the most commonly cited source. There are almost 10,000 separate articles by the second edition of the book; some of them cite the previous dictionary as a reference. Reception The book was praised for its comprehensiveness. It had 32 volumes, each of approximately 500 pages, and was considerably larger than the Encyclopædia Britannica. The book served as an inspiration for many other authors who wrote similar books under the same title.

The Sunday Times Culture magazine said 'its formula is unique. Learning by rote (repetition, not sheet music), amateurs rehearse harmonies and choreographed movements to those hits that everybody knows and impulsively sings along to'.Boase, Tessa 'Singing is Believing' The Sunday Times Culture Magazine, 22 March 2009 Redman Lusher first came up with the concept in the 1990s, while teaching music and performing arts at Farnborough 6th Form College, Hampshire. To help students pass their singing modules, she introduced weekly group singing sessions in which she taught three-part harmonies to well-liked songs. In 2005, Redman Lusher placed an advertisement for Rock Choir in a coffee shop in Farnham, Surrey, which initially attracted the first 70 members. =Public performances= Rock Choir's first local public performance was in November 2005, at the Farnham Maltings, Surrey, raising money for Age Concern. More Rock Choir performances followed in 2006 and 2007 at a wide range of local events, including the annual music festival, GuilFest. The growing success of Rock Choir has led to increasing regional and national press interest. Rock Choir have performed en-masse at iconic venues such as 02 Arena, London, The Liverpool Echo Arena, Wembley Arena, Hammersmith Apollo and the Royal Albert Hall. Rock Choir celebrated its 10th Anniversary by inviting thousands of members to perform at the NEC, Birmingham alongside special guests, Chesney Hawkes, Kiki Dee and Kim Wilde. =Album recording= On 1 April 2009, BBC Breakfast showed a pre-filmed clip of a Rock Choir rehearsal and interviewed Redman Lusher live in the studio. Afterwards Redman Lusher was contacted by Universal Records, who offered Rock Choir a multi-album record deal. A few months later, 987 Rock Choir members aged between 6 and 70 recorded Rock Choir Vol. 1. With no recording studio able to accommodate such a large number of singers, Decca hired a school in Cranleigh, Surrey and sent a mobile recording studio. Rock Choir Vol. 1 was released in July 2010 and reached number 1 in the Amazon charts, entering the top 20 in the UK album charts. Tom Lewis, Head of A&R; for Universal’s label, Decca Records, described it as \\"The feel-good album of the year.\\"Rudd, Lewis Reading Post 'Wokingham Rock Choir Are The Ultimate In Feel-Good Music' 30 June 2010 On the release of the album, Redman Lusher said to The Daily Telegraph; \\"To have the opportunity of making an album that will be released worldwide is extraordinary.

She joined them and Rock Choir as a soloist on the tour, which culminated in a performance at the Royal Albert Hall. ='The Choir That Rocks'= In 2010, Redman Lusher was approached by 10 Star Entertainment and ITV, who wanted to produce a documentary following the Rock Choir story. By now Rock Choir had over 8,000 members across the UK. In January 2011, the TV crews filmed Redman Lusher, her team and the members as Rock Choir prepared for its biggest ever show at Wembley Arena. The filming featured new choirs as they opened in Yorkshire, Scotland and Dorset, and resulted in a three-part ITV1 documentary 'The Choir That Rocks', which was aired in June 2011, and repeated in September 2011. After the first episode, 23,000 people logged on to the Rock Choir website, crashing the server, and 8,000 people emailed with membership enquiries. The second Rock Choir album, 'Rock Choir Deluxe', was released at the same time as the TV show. = Awards = In 2015, Rock Choir was awarded the Sun Mark Big Heart award at the Red Ribbon Awards, which recognises businesses which are intrinsically generous and passionate about volunteering, fundraising and having an impact on the local community. =Charity work= Rock Choir is a small family-run organisation, not a franchise.Reynolds, Stefan (ed.)

It is located approximately one mile as the crow files to the south-east of Mawbray, or two-and-a-half miles by road, and a similar distance east of Salta, and north-east of Allonby. The small hamlet of Jericho is located less than a mile to the north-east. Approximately 23 miles to the north-east is the city of Carlisle. Allonby Bay, an inlet of the Solway Firth, is one-and-a-half miles to the south-west, as is the B5300 coast road which runs between Silloth-on-Solway, six-and-a-half miles to the north, and Maryport, six miles to the south. Notable landmarks in the area include Edderside Hall and the church at Holme St. Cuthbert. Excavations of a cropmark enclosure at Edderside were conducted in 1989–1990 by Robert H. Bewley. Etymology The name Edderside is derived perhaps from the Old English ædre- sīde, meaning \\"beside the water-course\\".'Plain People – Bygone Times on the Solway Plain' (2004) Holme St. Cuthbert History Group, Another possibility for the first part of the name is *ador, an ancient Brittonic river-name element, meaning \\"a channel\\", from the name for a stream that flows into the Black Dub. Recorded variant spellings include Eddersyde, Edarside, Eddysid, Etherside, Ederside, and Adderside. History The area around Edderside has a very long history. On nearby Salta Moss, a Bronze Age rapier was discovered in the 1980s, and may have been crafted as early as 1100BC, proving the area was inhabited at least by that time. The rapier currently resides in the Tullie House museum in Carlisle. The site of the present hamlet was inhabited by the second century AD, and there are Roman remains in the vicinity. This section of the west Cumbrian coastline was fortified by the Romans during this period, as a series of milefortlets were constructed to guard the Solway coast beyond the western end of Hadrian's Wall. The remains of Milefortlet 17 are located at nearby Dubmill Point. Following the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s, records from Holmcultram Abbey in Abbeytown showed Edderside paid an annual tithe of six large baskets of meal. Also during the 16th century, raids by Scots across the Solway Firth were still relatively common. At Dubmill Point, a man named William Osmotherly was kidnapped for ransom during such a raid. As such, local communities including Edderside participated in the \\"seawake\\", a night watch along the coast. In the 19th century, there were six functioning farms in the hamlet, each paying an annual tithe of twelve bushels of barley. In 1828, a man named William Barwise built a large home in the hamlet which is still standing. He and his wife Fanny moved to the area from Shropshire and lived in Edderside Hall until 1845, when they left the area for Liverpool. Between the 1820s and 1870s, one additional cottage was built for farm labourers. By the mid-19th century, Edderside was considered to be a wealthy settlement, at least by the standards of the area, with a single estate in the early 1880s being worth at least £10,000. Adjusted for inflation, such an estate would be worth £1,000,000 in the 2010s. Edderside Hall was built by William Barwise in the 19th century. In 1878, an iron ship was commissioned in Liverpool bearing the name Edderside by the Whitehaven Ship Building Company. She had her maiden voyage from Liverpool that year, arriving in Sydney in June 1879. In 1895 she was converted to a barque rig, and sold to new owners based in Norway in 1903. She sank off the coast of South Africa in 1919, having left the port of Durban bound for Buenos Aires with a cargo of coal, but collided with another vessel in dense fog. All seven hands were lost. Edderside today A public footpath near Edderside which leads to the village of Allonby. Edderside is a small hamlet with three functioning farms, but lacks any facilities of its own. There is a caravan park and restaurant, Manor House Park, to the south-west on the road leading to the coast. At nearby Mawbray, the Lowther Arms pub closed in May 2018. The village of Allonby has several hotels and restaurants, a leisure centre with a swimming pool, and Twentyman's, a small shop. On the B5300 coast road, a mile- and-a-half to the south-west of Edderside, a bus service runs approximately once every two hours north to Silloth-on-Solway and south to Maryport. From Maryport railway station, the nearest station to the hamlet, trains along the Cumbrian Coast Line head north to Carlisle and south to Whitehaven, Barrow-in- Furness, and occasionally Lancaster. Edderside lies within the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. This AONB was designated to preserve what was determined to be one of the most picturesque stretches of coastline in all of England. Nearby Salta Moss is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

After winning the 2020 elections, Santokhi was the sole nomination for President of Suriname. On 13 July, Santokhi was elected president by acclamation in an uncontested election. He was inaugurated on 16 July. Early life Santokhi was born on 3 February 1959, into an Indo-Surinamese Hindu family in Lelydorp, in district Suriname (now known as district Wanica). He grew up in the countryside as the youngest in a family of nine children. His father worked at the harbor of Paramaribo and his mother worked as a shop assistant in Lelydorp.  Career  = Police career = After Santokhi obtained his vwo diploma at the Algemene Middelbare School highschool in Paramaribo, he received a scholarship to study in the Netherlands. From 1978 till 1982 he studied at the Police Academy of the Netherlands in Apeldoorn. After completing his study he returned to Suriname in September 1982 to work for the police. Since the age of 23, Santokhi worked as a police inspector in Geyersvlijt and Wanica until he was appointed in 1989 as head of the national criminal investigation department. In 1991 he was appointed chief commissioner of police. = Minister of Justice = In September, 2005, Santokhi was sworn in as Minister of Justice and Police on behalf of the Progressive Reform Party. His period in office was marked by a heavy crackdown on crime, in particular drug trafficking, and a strict, no-nonsense enforcement of law and order. This earned him the nickname sheriff, which he got from Dési Bouterse. = December murders trial = Santokhi who, as police commissioner, led the investigation to the December murders did in the start of his ministership a lot so that the December murders trial could finally commence. Exclusive for the December murders trial he had a heavily secured courtroom built in Domburg, Wanica. Because Santokhi was the impulse behind the trial, he became a much discussed matter of the main suspect in that trial, Dési Bouterse. Bouterse said on November 26, 2007, four days before the commencement of the trial, that Santokhi wanted to \\"imprison and kill him\\". Bouterse adduced that numerous previous attempts to \\"take him out\\" all failed and warned Santokhi to be cautious with his \\"intentions to eliminate Bouterse\\". On 29 November 2019, the Court of Appeal reached a verdict in the December murders trial, and Bouterse had been convicted to 20 years' imprisonment. On 10 September 2008, Santokhi sued Bouterse for insult, slander and defamation, because Bouterse had alleged that Santokhi had ties to drug dealers and other criminals. On 23 September 2008, the court ruled that the allegations were unproven, ordered Bouterse to publish a rectification, and a penalty payment of SRD100,000 for each day Bouterse failed to execute the sentence. The same day, Bouterse placed a rectification in De West where he admitted that the statements were untrue. =2010 general election= In the 2010 Surinamese general election, Santokhi received the highest number of votes after Dési Bouterse, despite being placed relatively low on the party list of the Progressive Reform Party. In July of that year, he was appointed as presidential candidate on behalf of the ruling political alliance New Front for Democracy and Development. Santokhi's opponent in the presidential elections was Dési Bouterse. Since Bouterse (NDP) cooperated with Ronnie Brunswijk (ABOP) and Paul Somohardjo (PL), his political alliance had a total of 36 seats, while the New Front only had fourteen. Consequently, Bouterse was elected the eighth President of Suriname. = President of CICAD = Santokhi, who for fifteen years was the official representative of the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD), was chosen on 6 December 2010, as president of this organization for one year. CICAD is an autonomous body of the Organization of American States, that coordinates the drug policy of the Western Hemisphere. In 2009, Santokhi was, also for one year, the vice-president of this organization. =Chairman of the Progressive Reform Party= On 3 July 2011, Santokhi was elected as chairman of the Vooruitstrevende Hervormings Partij (VHP) (Progressive Reform Party). The Progressive Reform Party, which was once an Indo-Surinamese party, has grown, since the appointment of Santokhi as chairman, into a multi- ethnical party which, according to current statistics, is the second-biggest political party in Suriname.http://www.dewest-online.com/?p=15457 VHP groeit sinds aantreden Santokhi, De West 13/01/2012 With eight seats in the parliament, the VHP was the biggest opposition party until 2020. =President of Suriname= Santokhi with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in September 2020 On 26 May 2020, the preliminary results of the 2020 Surinamese general election showed that the VHP was the largest party, and that Chan Santokhi was the most likely candidate to become the ninth President of Suriname. On 30 May, Chan Santokhi announced his candidacy for President of Suriname. On 29 June, the VHP nominated Chan Santokhi as their candidate for the Presidency. On 7 July, the coalition nominated Chan Santokhi as President of the Suriname and Ronnie Brunswijk as vice-president. No other candidates had been nominated on 8 July 2020, 15:00 (UTC−3), and on 13 July Santokhi was elected as president by acclamation in an uncontested election. He was inaugurated on 16 July on the Onafhankelijkheidsplein in Paramaribo in ceremony without public due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He belongs to a Hindu family of Indian origin.He surprised the world by reciting Sanskrit shloks and mantras in his oath ceremony. Santokhi's inauguration was also blessed by several Christian religious leaders. Personal life On 19 July 2020, Chan Santokhi married Melissa Seenacherry who had been his partner for years. The marriage took place in a private ceremony. Melissa is a lawyer by profession. He also has two adult children (a daughter and a son) from a previous marriage.

The productions comprise collaborative live performances by various leading folk, bluegrass and country musicians from both sides of the North Atlantic, playing music from Scotland, Ireland, England and North America, who congregate under the musical direction of Aly Bain and Jerry Douglas to record and film a set of half-hour TV episodes. The Television director is Mike Alexander and the producer is Douglas Eadie. In addition to the TV productions, public performances of the Transatlantic Sessions have been staged recently by some of the participating artists, receiving critical acclaim in the press and six series albums have been released in both CD and DVD format by Whirlie Records (see also External links, below). TOC Background The first (Original) Transatlantic Sessions episode was produced in 1995 - a project conceived at that time by Douglas Eadie, Mike Alexander and Aly Bain. Subsequent sessions were produced in 1998, 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013. To date, the series comprises the six sessions shown below in the History (listed in reverse-chronological order). For each session, the producer and directors select a special setting - typically a country manor, lodge or hotel in Scotland where the musicians perform and stay while the session is recorded (see also below). Each session was filmed in a different location with the exception of Series 4 and 5 which were both filmed in the same house, the hunting lodge at Glen Lyon near Aberfeldy in Perthshire. Series 6 was filmed and recorded at a location on the banks of Loch Lomond.

D. Hopkins in 1894., Hopkins, A. D. Note and Record Keeping for the Economic Entomologist. Insect life 103–109 (1894) The System was formally initiated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1902 by Hopkins himself, who was subsequently named Chief of Forest Insect Investigations. It was still in use in 1987 by more than twenty Forest Service units of Forest Insect and Disease Research and Forest Pest Management, and by the Agricultural Research Service Systematic Entomology Laboratory (ARS-SEL). A salient feature or the System was the controlled assignment of “Hopkins numbers” to avoid redundancy within or between field units. These unique numbers allow for the keying of records, an essential per-requisite for the creation of a proper relational database. The paper records of the Hopkins Notes and Records System and the corresponding digital records in the Hopkins US System Index (HUSSI) are co- dependent repositories for data about specimens of forest insects and their damage. These specimens were curated by Government professionals beginning with Hopkins' work at the USDA. The more than 80 years of records with identification and collection information are from all geographic areas managed by the USDA Forest Service, as well as small subset of records from other countries.  Genesis  A.D. Hopkins, commonly referred to as the father of forest entomology in the United States, formulated the record- keeping system that now bears his name. Hopkins brought his system to the federal government when he came to work for the Division of Entomology in the late 1890s, by which time he had already been using his record keeping system at West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, where he previously worked. Hopkins then brought the system to the USDA Division of Entomology in 1902., Henneberry, T. J. Federal Entomology: Beginnings and Organizational Entities in the United States Department of Agriculture, 1854-2006, With Selected Research Highlights. 87 (United States Department of Agriculture: Washington, D.C., 2008) It was subsequently adopted by personnel of Forest Insect Investigations at field stations throughout the country. The System contains U.S. in its name to distinguish it from those earlier Hopkins records at West Virginia University. The Hopkins U.S. System became widely used by Forest Service Research, by other pest management units, and also by ARS-SEL. The it was in continuous use until the mid-1980s. = The Hopkins Notebook Series = The biological data from the original Hopkins records were recorded on either 3\\"x5\\" forms, or on 3\\"x5\\" or 5\\"x8\\" cards (hereafter referred to simply as cards) that were filed in the Hopkins Notebook Series. These Notebooks are the original “database” from which the Hopkins U.S. System developed. The system, represented in these volumes, consists of notebook entries bearing “checklist numbers,” and a set of such file cards. Cards are indexed to the descriptive narratives or notes that appear in the notebooks in numerical order by checklist number. Additional notes often provide extensive textual descriptions of the writer’s observations and many include detailed drawings as well. The table of contents for a given notebook was derived from the way in which those checklist numbers were assigned to individual collectors. Taken as a whole, the Notebook Series chronicles the work and travels of many of the pioneering figures of North American entomology, from the turn of the century to about 1920. Beginning in 1899, number-series – usually in blocks of 100 to 200 – appear to have been assigned to entomologists as needed. There are also blocks of numbers that were evidently set aside to accommodate material that was sent to the staff entomologists for identification. Such blocks of numbers are designated “Office Notes.” Some blocks of numbers in the Office Notes series are from outside the contiguous United States. For example, specimens or collections from Central and South America, Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Africa appear there. The information shown in the Office Notes often include references to the original correspondence accompanying the specimens when they were submitted. = The Hopkins Record cards = The card observations consist of the collection and identification information associated, by number, with specific insect or damage specimens. The numbers also correspond to identical numbers originally attached to mounted insects in collections distributed across the country. They connect that field sample to the information about how, when, and by whom, the work was done. All of that information is detailed by the Hopkins Record cards. The cards are the only link that exists between the sample and its physical provenance. At some archive locations, the early records included the above-mentioned notebooks or ledgers containing more detailed information. The card files usually have three components: a numerical file, the basic file of cards in numerical order; the species file or insect species index; and host file or host index. The System has been applied differently at the various field locations; some units have only the numerical file.  Organizational framework  Hopkins' organizing scheme was based on a series of duplicate paper records that contained collection and identification information about the specimens. Each record was given a unique sequential Hopkins U.S. Number. Specimens, each one bearing its own unique Hopkins US Number, and collection records were stored at Forest Service Research Stations and Laboratories, Regional Offices, and at the ARS-SEL in the U.S. National Museum / Smithsonian Institution. The Hopkins US System contained about 163,000 paper records representing several hundred thousand identified specimens or series of specimens. These are either of insects or samples of insect-damage. Each record has information about taxon, insect and plant association, collection location, date, and collector at a minimum. In addition to the drawings and textual narratives, the record can also have measurements, notes on the research study or spray program, or rearing and other biological data provided by the original collector. = Specimen collection, preparation and record keeping = All the details of the overall process can be found in R.G. Mitchell's unpublished monograph.Mitchell, R. G. Contents and Use of the Hopkins U.S. File System. Research; Unpublished. Portland, OR: USDA Forest Service, Division of Forest Insect Research, September 1961. That work includes \\"the procedures one follows from the time insect materiel is collected until identifications are obtained\\". A numbered list of those procedures, taken from the monograph, is reproduced below, with a block diagram of the corresponding workflow shown on the right: Workflow for the Hopkins records system # Collect insects or infested material, keeping insects separated by host. # Rear insects from infested host material or, in the case of defoliators, on fresh host material. When insects are collected as adults, rearing may not be necessary. (At times mating of insects and egg-laying may be desired to obtain needed biological information). # If the rearing or collecting results are of interest, assign a Hopkins number to the collection. (A single Hopkins number cannot be assigned to insects collected from more than one host species, or to insects of the same host species when the collections are separated appreciably by time, space, or host condition). # Fill out general note card (Figure 1) in the number file after preparing and editing a rough draft. The information should be typed on the card stamped with the Hopkins number. # If the insects were reared, fill out rearing notes summary card). # Fill out, if needed, species note card. # Separate insects by order and family. By microscopic examination decide how many species are represented. # Assign a \\"letter\\" suffix to the Hopkins number for each tentative identification and fill out species summary card. # Label insects (including a suffixed Hopkins number label) and place specimens in a Schmidt box in order of Hopkins number. Later, the insects to be identified will be removed and sent to a specialist. The duplicates retained at the Station are labeled with a blue tag to show that specimens have been sent away. # Make out three copies of the species determination card for each insect species being sent away for identification. # Write a covering memo for the insects to be shipped. One white copy is prepared for the Division Chief in Washington, D.C. in addition to the copy for the Station files. # Type six copies of the insect identification slip. # Attach two copies of each species determination card (step #9) and three copies of the insect identification slip (step #12) to the covering memo going to the specialist (usually through A.R.S. Division of Identification and Parasite Introduction). Mail memo. # Attach one insect identification slip (step #11) to the covering memo going to the W.O. This goes with other mail to the Chief, U.S.F.S. # Attach one insect identification slip (step #11) to the file copy of the covering memo and place in the pending file (U.S.F.S file code #4500-4). # Place one insect identification slip (step #11) in the shipping box and mail specimens to the specialist for identification. # Clip (use paper clip) all file copies of species determination cards together and place in pending section at the back of the number file. Place the other cards in the proper place in the number file.  Current status  In 1986, concern for the safety and integrity of the Hopkins US System files prompted what was then the Forest Insect and Disease Research Staff (FIDR-WO) to take steps to preserve the information contained in the Hopkins US System. The intent was also to consolidate the information and make it more useful and accessible to the scientific community. About 153,000 Hopkins US System cards and nearly 10,000 notebook pages throughout the Forest Service and at ARS_SEL were microfilmed. Microfiche sets of the file cards were distributed to the office of FIDR-WO, Forest Service labs, Regional Offices, and field units nationwide, and to ARS- SEL. To make the information in the Hopkins files more accessible, in 1987, FIDR began building the digital database that would become HUSSI. Approximately 61,000 ASCII records were initially created. Of these, about 37,000 records from Hopkins System files held by Forest Service units, mostly in the West, were developed into a relational database. The additional 20,000+ digitized ASCII records are from the Hopkins System paper records held by ARS- SEL at the U.S. National Museum. These have yet to be included in the database.  Future of the digital records  The existing HUSSI database can be queried to produce plant-host and insect-host lists, historical records, and, for example, information on historic and recent geographic range of forest insects to indicate climate change. The unique Hopkins US Number allows users to obtain desired supplemental information on the physical location of curated specimens, and additional information on the original paper Hopkins record(s). Such information is available from Forest Service repositories, ARS-SEL at the U. S. National Museum / Smithsonian Institution, and from several universities where specimens, records, and/or microfiche now reside. The goal is to make the records available over the Forest Service's internal network, and over the Internet as well. The Hopkins U.S. System is of great potential for use in forestry and forest entomology from a global perspective. The notes and records accumulated in the System constitute the foundational work for forest entomology in North America and elsewhere. They represent an invaluable set of historical field observations. The System was also a means of information sharing for the very earliest investigators during the pioneering phases of forest entomology in the United States. At that time, little was known, not even the identities, of a large proportion of forest insects in this country. With its files containing nearly 200,000 records, the System is most important as a repository for information on the biologies, habits, and distributions of many thousands of insects of forest trees and other woody plants. Moreover, the observations in the notes have formed an important basis for the study of most of our major forest insect pests. They continued until recent times to provide information for field manuals, host lists, and biological studies. As forest conditions and forest management practices change, the roster of insects perceived to be pests changes. The Hopkins U.S. System files contain valuable biological information that can be used basis for dealing with insects reaching pest status. Because the files contain a vast amount of information on relationships between forest pests and their parasites, predators, and other associated insects, they have served as a source of information to evaluate the potential for biological control through introductions/redistributions of natural enemies or manipulation of habitats.

He was a founding member of the Society of Ethical and Religious Vegetarians (SERV),Website of the Society of Ethical and Religious Vegetarians and a former outreach director of the Fund for Animals.Phelps, Norm (2007). The Longest Struggle. Lantern Books. He authored four books on animal rights: The Dominion of Love: Animal Rights According to the Bible (2002), The Great Compassion: Buddhism and Animal Rights (2004), The Longest Struggle: Animal Advocacy from Pythagoras to PETA (2007), and Changing the Game: Animal Liberation in the Twenty-first Century (2015). Biography Phelps spoke at numerous conferences, including the National Conference on Organized Resistance, the University of Oregon's Public Interest Environmental Law Conference, several of the annual Animal Rights Conferences sponsored by the Farm Animal Rights Movement (FARM), and the Compassionate Living Festival. He also published articles, essays, and book reviews in several periodicals: Journal of Critical Animal Studies,Phelps, Norm (2008). \\"Rhyme, Reason, and Animal Rights\\", Journal for Critical Animal Studies, vol 6, issue 1 Philosophia, Satya, The Animals’ Voice, and VegNews. Phelps had become a vegetarian and then a vegan following the death of his dog Czar in 1984. As Phelps describes this change process on his website, \\"Czar was a person. He had a personality as individual and well-defined as any human being. He could love, he could trust, he could share, he could enjoy, he could fear, he could worry, he could look forward to the future and remember the past, he had a sense of who he was, and he would have sacrificed himself for me without a moment's hesitation. . . . If Czar was a person, what about other animals? What about cows, pigs, chickens and sheep? Weren't they people, too? How could we love some and eat others?\\" In 1994, Phelps retired from the federal government and joined the campaigns office of The Fund for Animals in Silver Spring, Maryland, where he became active in the campaign to end the live pigeon shoot which was then held every Labor Day in the village of Hegins, Pennsylvania. (The shoot ended in 1998.) When The Fund for Animals merged with The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), Phelps joined the staff of the HSUS wildlife protection campaign, where he worked until he resigned for reasons of age and health in 2011. (From 2002 until his death, Phelps had suffered from myasthenia gravis, an auto-immune neuromuscular condition that causes severe fatiguable weakness.) As an animal rights theorist, Phelps argues that the animal rights movement must: 1) Engage religious communities on the side of animal rights, 2) Join with progressive movements for social and economic justice and environmental protection to create a genuine universal rights movement, and 3) pursue a \\"two-track\\" strategy of advocating veganism and the abolition of all animal exploitation while simultaneously campaigning for more moderate reforms, such as Meatless Mondays and the abolition of battery cages for laying hens. Although he is generally opposed to militant direct action on the grounds that it is counterproductive, Phelps supported live rescues of animals from farms and laboratories. In 1994, he was arrested at a pigeon shoot in Pikeville, Pennsylvania for releasing 200 pigeons who were slated to become living targets. He spent two days in Berks County Prison and was subsequently convicted of malicious mischief. He lived in Funkstown, Maryland (USA) with his second wife, Patti Rogers. He is survived by his 2 children, his son Nelson and his daughter Kyra.

He is the director of the Institute for Contemporary Affairs at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs and a former partner in the Tel Aviv law firm of Moshe, Bloomfield, Kobo, Baker & Co. He was a military prosecutor and senior legal adviser in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and represented the Ministry of Defense at international conferences, and then joined the Foreign Ministry as legal adviser. He participated in the negotiation and drafting of agreements and peace treaties with Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians. In January 2012 he was appointed by Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu to the three member committee chaired by former Justice Edmund Levy to examine the legal aspects of land ownership in the West Bank. The committee's report, referred to as Levy Report, was published by the Israeli government in Hebrew in July 2012. Life and career Baker was born to a traditional Jewish family in the UK. He studied law at University College London, where he received his Bachelor of Laws in 1969, when the family emigrated to Israel, and has a Master of Laws in International Law from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1972). He was admitted to the Israel Bar Association in 1977. Baker spent the bulk of his professional career working in different capacities for Israel. Two years after graduating from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Baker became a Military Prosecutor and Senior Legal Officer in the International Law Branch of the Military Advocate General's Unit. Most of Baker's dealings during this time revolved around international humanitarian law, human rights law, and the law of armed conflict.Curriculum Vitae of Alan Baker, March 19, 2017, 2. Serving in this capacity until 1979, Baker returned to public service in 1985 where he was seconded by the government of Israel to the United Nations in New York serving as a senior legal adviser. This role, which lasted until 1988, saw Baker dealing directly with specialized agencies and bodies within the UN system such as the Administrative Tribunal. In 1995, Baker also served as Israel's representative to the international negotiations of the International Criminal Court (ICC) as well as the Rome Diplomatic Conference in 1998. Beginning in 1974, over the decades Baker has engaged in direct negotiations with Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and the Palestinians. Accordingly, Baker's role during these meeting largely focused on the fields of international law. More specifically, Baker contributed to discussions on international humanitarian law, crime prevention, disarmament, aviation law, and water resources. Moreover, he has represented Israel at international conferences and negotiations, including Israel's legal presentation to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the issue of IsraeL's security barrier in 2004. Accordingly, among Baker's most recent publications concerns UNWRA role in perpetuating refugeedom, UNESCO's undermining of Jewish religious heritage, and the implications of the Balfour Declaration 100 years since its signing. From 1996 to 2004, he was legal adviser and deputy director-general of Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and served as Israel's ambassador to Canada from 2004 to 2008. He retired from government service in February 2009 and joined the Tel Aviv law firm of Moshe, Bloomfield, Kobo, Baker & Co. In 2010 he took up the post of Director of the Institute for Contemporary Affairs at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. At this institution, Baker also oversees the Global Law Forum. His publications range from the legal dimensions of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict to the interaction between international organizations and Israel. Baker is a member of the Israel Bar, the International Law Association, the International Institute of Humanitarian Law, the International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists, and serves as a member of Israel's panel of arbitrators at the Permanent Court of Arbitration. Opinions On the question of legality of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, Baker outlined Israel's interpretation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention in a 2003 interview: Baker explained the reference to the continued Israeli presence in the West Bank pursuant to the Oslo accords between the PLO and Israel in the interview as follows, stating: And he explains the status of Israeli residents of settlements in the West Bank, In January 2012 Baker was appointed by Prime Minister Netanyahu to serve on a three-member government committee to \\"examine real estate issues in the West Bank\\". The committee's report published in July 2012, usually referred to as Levy Report, recommends procedures for ensuring that settlement construction is carried out legally, and comes to the conclusion that Israel's presence in the West Bank is not occupation, and that the Israeli settlements are legal under international law.

The BOLD mission objective would be to quantify the amount of hydrogen peroxide () existing in the Martian soil and to test for processes typically associated with life. Six landing packages are projected to impact 'softly' on Mars that include a limited power supply, a set of oxidant and life detection experiments, and a transmitter, which is able to transmit information via an existing Mars orbiter back to Earth. The mission was first proposed in 2012.The Biological Oxidant and Life Detection (BOLD) Mission: A Proposal for a Mission to Mars. Concepts and Approaches for Mars Exploration (2012)  Overview  The Viking program to Mars was the only mission to date that conducted life-detection experiments. It revealed ambiguous and still controversial results. The mission proponents argue that new findings and hypotheses urge a re-evaluation of the Viking results and a re-evaluation of the evidence for the possible presence of life on Mars in general. Recent and current missions to be launched focus on habitability considerations (e.g., Phoenix, Mars Science Laboratory), but shy away from directly testing for life on Mars, with the potential exception of the ESA ExoMars mission. The BOLD mission is designed to be less expensive than most current Mars missions as it consists only of a carrier vehicle with 6 probes attached. No orbiter is assumed. Instead the probes take advantage of existing Mars orbiters for communications relay. The number of probes is intended to provide a certain degree of mission redundancy in case some of them do not land successfully or fail.  Scientific objectives  The scientific objectives of the BOLD mission are: to identify the unknown oxidant in the Martian soil, which was postulated after the Viking program, and to probe whether there is extant life near the Martian surface. In contrast to the Viking mission, which was geared toward finding abundant heterotrophic life on Mars with a global distribution, the BOLD mission is aimed at a more comprehensive search including lithoautrophic and photosynthetic microbes, and a variety of biosignatures.  Lander probes  If selected and funded, the carrier vehicle with the landing probes would be propelled into a circular orbit around Mars. The orbiter would be equipped with a small solid rocket to provide the deceleration required to insert the spacecraft in an entry trajectory that can safely release the probes on the Martian surface. A terrain navigation system, coupled with robust propulsion, potentially permits targeting with precision on the order of meters if required to meet the science objectives. Each probe would have a mass of 59 kilograms (130 pounds) with a science payload of less than . Each of the probes' lander system uses a parachute and a crushable shell behind the heat shield for a 'soft impact' landing. Upon landing, the science instruments at their tips would penetrate up to 30 centimeters (one foot) into Martian regolith, a depth sufficient to conduct accurate scientific measurements. The landing probes will be powered by batteries. The mission duration for each landing probe is anticipated to be 10 sols (10 Martian days).

Sayf al-Dawla had established an emirate based in Aleppo in 945, and quickly emerged as the main Muslim antagonist of the Byzantine Empire on its eastern frontier. Both sides launched raids and counter-raids with alternating success: the Hamdanids invading the Byzantine provinces of Asia Minor, and the Byzantines raiding Hamdanid possessions in Upper Mesopotamia and northern Syria. In mid-960, taking advantage of the absence of much of the Byzantine army on campaign against the Emirate of Crete, the Hamdanid prince launched another invasion of Asia Minor, and raided deeply and widely into the region of Cappadocia. On his return, however, his army was ambushed by Leo Phokas at the pass of Andrassos. Sayf al-Dawla himself barely escaped, but his army was annihilated. Following a series of Byzantine successes in the previous years, the battle of Andrassos is considered by many scholars to have finally broken the power of the Hamdanid emirate. Having lost much of his strength, and increasingly beset by illness, Sayf al-Dawla would never again be able to raid as deeply into Byzantine territories. Led by Leo's brother Nikephoros Phokas, the Byzantines now launched a sustained offensive that by 969 had conquered Cilicia and northern Syria around Antioch, and resulted in the vassalization of Aleppo itself.  Background  In the middle of the 10th century, after a period of expansion on its eastern frontier, led by John Kourkouas, at the expense of the Muslim border emirates, the Byzantine Empire was confronted by the Hamdanid prince Sayf al-Dawla. In 945, Sayf al-Dawla made Aleppo his capital, and soon established his authority across northern Syria, much of the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), and what remained of the Abbasid Caliphate's frontier districts (thughūr) with Byzantium. Committed to the spirit of jihad, during the following two decades the Hamdanid ruler emerged as the main enemy of the Byzantines. By the time of his death in 967, Sayf al-Dawla was said to have fought against the Byzantines in over forty battles. After his establishment in Aleppo, in winter 945–946 Sayf al-Dawla launched his first raid into Byzantine territory, but a truce was arranged and regular warfare between Sayf al-Dawla and the Byzantines began only in 948. Initially, the Byzantines were led by the Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief) Bardas Phokas the Elder, but although he was capable enough as a subordinate commander, his tenure as commander-in-chief proved largely a failure. In 948–950 the Byzantines scored a few successes, sacking the border fortresses of Hadath and Marash, and taking Theodosiopolis, putting an end to the Muslim border emirate there. Bardas' second son, Leo, distinguished himself in these years, leading the capture of Hadath and a raid that reached the outskirts of Antioch and defeated a Hamdanid army. In November 950 Leo scored a major success against Sayf al-Dawla, who had previously advanced deep into Byzantine Asia Minor from Cilicia and defeated Bardas in battle. Leo ambushed the Hamdanid army during its return journey in a mountain pass; Sayf al-Dawla lost 8,000 men and barely escaped himself. Sayf al-Dawla nevertheless rejected offers of peace from the Byzantines, and continued his raids. More importantly, he set about restoring the frontier fortresses of Cilicia and northern Syria, including at Marash and Hadath. Bardas Phokas repeatedly tried to hinder him, but was defeated each time, even losing his youngest son, Constantine, to Hamdanid captivity. In 955, Bardas' failures led to his replacement by his eldest son, Nikephoros Phokas. Under the capable leadership of Nikephoros, Leo, and their nephew John Tzimiskes, the tide began to turn against the Hamdanid emir. In 956, Tzimiskes ambushed Sayf al-Dawla but the Hamdanid army, fighting amidst torrential rain, managed to drive the Byzantines back; at the same time, however, Leo Phokas defeated and captured Abu'l-Asha'ir, a cousin of Sayf al-Dawla, near Duluk. The city of Hadath was sacked again in 957, and Samosata in 958, after which Tzimiskes scored a major victory over Sayf al-Dawla himself. In 959, Leo Phokas raided through Cilicia to Diyar Bakr and back to Syria, leaving a trail of destruction behind him.  Sayf al-Dawla's invasion of Cappadocia  Map of the Arab–Byzantine frontier zone in south-eastern Asia Minor, with the major fortresses. In early summer 960, Sayf al-Dawla saw an opportunity to reverse his recent setbacks and re-establish his position: the best troops of the Byzantine army, and Nikephoros Phokas himself, departed the eastern front for an expedition against the Emirate of Crete. With the Tarsiot troops he launched an invasion of Byzantine territory from Cilicia, while his lieutenant Naja launched a parallel raid from Mayyafariqin in the western Jazira. The task of confronting the Hamdanid emir fell on Leo Phokas, who according to the Byzantine chroniclers had been appointed as Domestic of the Schools of the West (i.e., of the European armies) following the accession of Romanos II in November 959 (with Nikephoros being named Domestic of the Schools of the East) and had just defeated a Magyar raid into Thrace in a daring night attack on their camp. The 11th-century Christian Arab chronicler Yahya of Antioch, however, reports that Leo had been appointed Domestic of the East, and that he had remained on the eastern front throughout 959–960, leading raids into the Hamdanid domains up until the invasion of Sayf al-Dawla. The forces at Phokas' disposal are unknown, but were clearly considerably inferior in numbers to the army of the Hamdanid ruler. At the head of a strong cavalry force—the numbers reported in the sources vary from 3,000 to as many as 30,000—Sayf al-Dawla invaded Byzantine territory, and advanced unopposed as far as the fortress of Charsianon, capital of the theme of the same name. There he and his army sacked the fortress and massacred the garrison; they pillaged and torched the surrounding region and its settlements and took many prisoners. Other than Charsianon, the invasion appears to have avoided fortified centres and cities. According to the historian William Garrood, this fact, along with the great depth of penetration, and the long duration of the raid, points to it being \\"a grand campaign of destabilisation of the border\\" rather than an expedition with specific targets in mind. Indeed, Garrood opines that after Charsianon, Sayf al-Dawla appears to have turned to the west in order to maximize the area devastated during the raid. Towards the end of autumn, Sayf al-Dawla finally began the journey home, taking his booty and prisoners with him. The contemporary Byzantine historian Leo the Deacon gives a vivid portrait of the Hamdanid prince, who, elated at the success of his raid and full of self- confidence, sped back and forth alongside his troops on his horse, a mare \\"of extraordinary size and speed\\", throwing his spear in the air and catching it again with remarkable dexterity.  Ambush at Andrassos  In the meantime Leo Phokas, heavily outnumbered by the Arab army, decided to rely once more on his proven ambuscade tactics, and occupied a position in the Arabs' rear, awaiting their return. Leo had been joined by the remaining forces of the adjoining provinces, including the theme of Cappadocia under its strategos, Constantine Maleinos, and occupied the narrow pass of Kylindros on the south-western Taurus Mountains between Cilicia and Cappadocia. The Byzantine troops occupied the local fort, and hid themselves along the steep sides of the pass. According to the Arab chronicler Abu'l-Fida, this was the same pass that Sayf al-Dawla had crossed to begin his expedition, and many of his commanders advised against using it for the return as well; the Tarsiots even recommended that he should follow them on their own, different return route. Nevertheless, the Hamdanid prince, confident of his ability and judgment, had grown haughty, and refused to heed any advice, seeking to reap the glory for this expedition alone. The Tarsiots withdrew, and thus were preserved from the subsequent disaster. On 8 November 960, the Hamdanid army entered the pass, where, according to Leo the Deacon, they \\"had to crowd together in the very narrow and rough places, breaking their formations, and had to cross the steep section each one as best he could\\". Once the entire Arab force, including their train and their captives, was in the pass, with the vanguard already nearing the southern exit, Leo Phokas gave the signal for the attack. With the trumpets blaring, the Byzantine soldiers raised cries and charged the Arab columns, or threw rocks and tree trunks down the slopes on them. The ensuing battle was a complete rout. Many Arabs were killed—Leo the Deacon claims that their bones were still visible at the site years later—and even more were taken captive—John Skylitzes writes that so many prisoners were taken that the cities and farmsteads were filled with slaves. All the Christian captives were liberated and the booty recovered, while the treasure and baggage of Sayf al- Dawla himself were captured. The Hamdanid prince himself barely managed to escape; Theophanes Continuatus claims that he was saved when a Byzantine renegade named John gave him his own horse to escape, while Leo the Deacon reports that he threw gold and silver coins behind him to slow his pursuers. According to the 13th-century Syriac chronicler Bar Hebraeus, of the great expedition he had mustered, Sayf al-Dawla returned to Aleppo with only 300 horsemen. Several of the most distinguished Hamdanid leaders fell or were captured at this battle. Some Arab sources mention the capture of Sayf al- Dawla's cousins Abu'l-Asha'ir and Abu Firas al-Hamdani, but most chroniclers and modern scholars place these events on different occasions (in 956 for Abu'l-Asha'ir, and 962 for Abu Firas). His nephew Muhammad, son of Nasir al- Dawla, was captured, while the qadi of Aleppo, Abu'l-Husayn al-Raqqi, was taken prisoner or fell in battle according to different accounts. Bar Hebraeus also records the deaths of the commanders \\"Hamid ibn Namus\\" and \\"Musa-Saya Khan\\". Leo Phokas released the Byzantine prisoners after providing them with provisions, and took the booty and Arab prisoners back to Constantinople, where he celebrated a triumph at the Hippodrome. Indeed, the battle of Andrassos made a deep impression among contemporaries, provoking outbursts of celebration in the Empire, and grief and lamentation in the Syrian cities; it is mentioned by all historical sources of the time, and upheld in the contemporary Byzantine treatise De velitatione bellica (\\"On Skirmishing Warfare\\") as one of the chief examples of a successful ambush.  Aftermath  Both contemporary Arab and modern historians, such as Marius Canard and J. B. Bikhazi, have commonly considered the defeat at Andrassos as a decisive engagement that destroyed Hamdanid offensive abilities for good, and opened the path for Nikephoros Phokas' subsequent exploits. The disasters inflicted on Sayf al-Dawla by the Byzantines over the following years are regarded as an inevitable consequence of this battle. Garrood on the other hand argues that the Hamdanid ruler had been able to recover from similar failures on previous occasions, and that the forces of Naja and his Tarsiot allies remained intact; furthermore, unlike the disasters that followed, his power does not appear to have been challenged in the aftermath of the battle. The capture of Aleppo by the Byzantines in late 962, from the Madrid Skylitzes Nevertheless, Sayf al- Dawla's 960 raid was the last of this scale and ambition, and the Byzantines did not allow him to recover his strength: as soon as Nikephoros Phokas returned victorious from Crete in mid-961, he resumed the offensive in the east. The Byzantines captured Anazarbus in Cilicia, and followed a deliberate policy of devastation and massacre to drive the Muslim population away. Sayf al-Dawla's attempts to halt the Byzantine advance in Cilicia failed, and Nikephoros Phokas, with an army reportedly 70,000 strong, took Marash, Sisium, Duluk and Manbij, securing the western passes over the Anti-Taurus Mountains. Sayf al-Dawla sent his army north under Nadja to meet the Byzantines, but Nikephoros ignored them. Instead, the Byzantine general led his troops south and in mid-December they suddenly appeared before Aleppo. There they defeated an improvised army before the city walls. The Byzantines stormed the city and plundered it, except for the citadel, which continued to hold out. The Byzantines departed in early 963, taking much of the populace with them as captives. In 963, following the death of Emperor Romanos II, Nikephoros turned his attention to the power struggle that saw him ascend the imperial throne. The defeats of the previous years, and particularly the sack of Aleppo, had dealt an irreversible blow on Sayf al-Dawla's power and authority. From then on, until his death, Sayf al-Dawla's rule would be plagued by revolts and disputes between his subordinates. At the same time, the Hamdanid prince also suffered from physical decline, with the onset of hemiplegia, as well as worsening intestinal and urinary disorders, that confined him to a litter. The disease limited Sayf al-Dawla's ability to intervene personally in the affairs of his state; he soon abandoned Aleppo to the charge of his chamberlain, Qarquya, and spent most of his final years in Mayyafariqin, leaving his senior lieutenants to carry the burden of warfare against the Byzantines and the various rebellions that increasingly occurred in his domains. In autumn 964, Nikephoros, now emperor, campaigned in the east. Mopsuestia was besieged but held out. Nikephoros returned in the next year, stormed the city and deported its inhabitants. On 16 August 965, Tarsus was surrendered by its inhabitants. Cilicia became a Byzantine province, and Nikephoros re-Christianized it. Amidst rebellions and Byzantine raids as far as the Jazira, Sayf al-Dawla died at Aleppo in February 967. His son and successor, Sa'd al-Dawla, faced constant internal turmoil, and he did not secure control of his own capital until 977. On 28 October 969, Antioch fell to the Byzantines. The fall of the great metropolis of northern Syria was soon followed by a treaty between the Byzantines and Qarquya, the ruler of Aleppo, which made the city a tributary vassal. Byzantine rule was extended over the entirety of the former thughūr, as well as the coastal strip of Syria between the Mediterranean Sea and the Orontes River until the environs of Tripoli, Arqa, and Shayzar. The rump Emirate of Aleppo was left almost powerless and became a bone of contention between the Byzantines and the new power of the Middle East, the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt.

The building was close to, but not within, the Ent Air Force Base complex, and was leased by the military for several decades, housing headquarters for several military commands, starting with the Air Defense Command (ADC) and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). When Chidlaw was completed, personnel from multiple locations, including the Ent Air Force Base, were consolidated into the new building. In 1993, the building was renovated into an office building and housed Premiere Global Services (PGi) as its main tenant. Once PGi moved out in 2011, building occupancy dropped to 45%, but still included a customer service center for Time Warner Cable. The building went into foreclosure in 2012. Background By April 1958, North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) informed the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the need for a Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) to be located in a new, underground Combat Operations Center in the Colorado Springs, Colorado area. Building the Combat Operations Center within a granite mountain in the Colorado Springs area was shown to be the best solution at the lowest cost. NORAD also concluded that it was important to have related commands nearby, such for joint planning and combat readiness, but not so close that they could be destroyed easily at the same time. On March 18, 1959, and upon review of findings by the Corps of Engineers, the Joint Chiefs of Staff determined that Cheyenne Mountain should be the location of the underground facility (Cheyenne Mountain Complex). While the construction was performed, an interim location for the Zone of Interior BMEWS equipment was to be established in the basement of a building near the base. That way, BMEWS equipment could be utilized as early as 1961 and until the new Combat Operations Center was completed. NORAD said that the only initial active Advanced Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (AICBM) system that could be ready in sufficient numbers to be effective by 1964 was the Nike Zeus, which would integrate the use of radar, anti-missile missiles and atomic warheads. In December 1958, NORAD called for the hasty development of the anti-Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system, the WS-117L reconnaissance satellite. The Clear Air Force Station system in Alaska was scheduled to be completed in 1961, but the hardened Combat Operation Center would not be operations until sometime after that. So, an interim BMEWS central display facility was built as an annex to the Ent Combat Operation Center. It would not, though, have an interim satellite prediction computer, that that would be placed in the new Cheyenne Mountain facility. In the meantime, each radar site's computer would make its own calculations. The Ent Air Force Base COC annex would not be completed until December 1960, so an interim solution was to be implemented at Thule by September 1960 and until December 1960. SPADATS was transferred to NORAD and CONAD command in November 1960 and was activated at the Ent Air Force Base on February 14, 1961 by the 1st Aerospace Surveillance and Control Squadron, which was also responsible for the operation of the BMEWS Central Computer and Display Facility in the NORAD Operations Center. SPADATS was dedicated at Ent on July 3, 1961, just a few months after excavation began on Cheyenne Mountain. The plan to use an off-base leased facility was implemented for the Combined Operations Center when the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station was delayed and an earlier Semi- Automatic Ground Environment command post was needed as an interim Air Defense Operations Center for combining NORAD's attack warning and CONAD's weapons direction missions. Military building General Benjamin W. Chidlaw was commander of the Air Defense Command (1951-1955) at Ent Air Force Base and then commander of the Joint Service Continental Air Defense Command (1954-1955), which merged the defense forces of all branches of the military under one command in 1957. CONAD joined with the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1957 to become NORAD. The Chidlaw Building, built in 1963 as the headquarters for the Aerospace Defense Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), was named for retired Air Force Gen. Benjamin W. Chidlaw. The building was built with fortified walls, an auditorium for 174 people, two electrical substations, and elaborate heating and cooling systems. Of three floors, one is underground, and the only windows were those in the lobby. The Chidlaw Building consolidated Air Defense Command personnel from 14 different locations, including the Ent Air Force Base, into one location. It had command sections for NORAD headquarters, ADTAC headquarters, and an ADTAC command section, and a secure communications complex with links to the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station. Facilities included a printing plant, exercise room, cafeteria, and executive dining room. There were also a food store, small base exchange, commercial bank, and Ent Credit Union on site. There was a civilian guard force. Department of Defense graphic artist Terrance Patterson was commissioned to make nine paintings of the evolution of air and space for the building. When the military vacated the building, the paintings were moved to the lobby of the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station technical support building. =Combined Operation Center= The Chidlaw Building's Combined Operations Center was transferred from the Ent AFB combat center. It had an IBM 1410 computer in 1965 for systems analysis, and air defense consoles presenting data from various Air Divisions (e.g., for the Goose Air Defense Sector in Canada). Systems which transmitted data to the building included AN/FSQ-8 Combat Control Centrals at Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Combat Centers which forwarded the divisional air defense status to NORAD. As the highest echelon of command and control for the SAGE Defense System, the Chidlaw Building was the primary node of NORAD's Alert Network Number 1. The network was to warn military installations with low rate teletype data, like SAC Emergency War Order Traffic that included Positive Control/Noah's Ark instructions through northern NORAD radio sites to confirm or recall SAC bombers if SAC decided to launch the alert force before receiving an execution order from the JCS. The NORAD Combined Operations Center operations was transferred from Ent Air Force Base to the Cheyenne Mountain Complex on April 20, 1966. Space Defense Center at Cheyenne Mountain Complex became fully operational on February 6, 1967. =Command headquarters= In addition to the Combined Operations Center, the Chidlaw Building housed the headquarters for several military commands: ;North American Aerospace Defense Command: Chidlaw Building became the NORAD headquarters in March, 1963. Prior to that Ent Air Force Base had been headquarters. In January 1988, Peterson Air Force Base became NORAD headquarters. ;Continental Air Defense Command: CONAD and NORAD offices were consolidated. CONAD was disestablished on June 30, 1975. ;Air Space Command / Aerospace Defense Command: Chidlaw was built to consolidate personnel that were on the Ent Air Force Based and 13 other locations in 1963. On July 1, 1975, ADCOM Headquarters were established at the Chidlaw Building when Ent Air Force Base was closing. ;Air Defense, Tactical Air Command: On 21 September 1979, the ADTAC headquarters of Major General John L. Piotrowski was established at the Chidlaw Building. ADTAC received Aerospace Defense Command's \\"atmospheric\\" assets, including interceptors, bases, and SAGE radar stations) on October 1, 1979. Strategic Air Command assumed responsibility for missile warning and space surveillance systems. ;Air Force Space Command: Space Command headquarters activated September 1, 1982, at the Chidlaw Building and moved in November 1987 to Peterson AFB's Building 1 The Chidlaw Building had been the site of the January 1978 presentation to a general- officer review group chaired by new SAC Commander in Chief General Richard H. Ellis and ADCOM Commander General Hill, who formally advocated formation of Space Command. ;United States Space Command: During December 1987, 2500 USSPACECOM and AFSPACECOM personnel relocated to their new Headquarters on Peterson AFB [Bldg 1470 (Ent Building) for USSPACECOM] from the Chidlaw Building. =Transition and inactivation= The Chidlaw Building was an off- site building of the Ent Air Force Base that was leased under an \\"expensive rental arrangement\\". The Ent Air Force Base was a complex in Colorado Springs without room for expansion, so the base was closed down in 1975 and became an annex to Peterson Air Force Base. In December 1976, personnel from Ent were moved to Chidlaw and Peterson Air Force Base. By 1979, the General Services Administration had leased the Chidlaw for use by the Air Force. A plan calling for a realignment, or distribution, of the Aerospace Defense Command responsibilities and assets to the Tactical Air Command, Strategic Air Command, and the Air Force Communication Services. It also included distributing personnel from Chidlaw to other military locations and deactivating the Aerospace Defense Command/. By the late 1980s, the functions performed within the building were moved to other military installations. USSPACECOM and NORAD headquarters were moved to Peterson Building 470. When preparing to move furniture from Chidlaw's Air Defense Command war room to Peterson Air Force Base, Tony Wells was surprised to find the chair that President John F. Kennedy sat in when he received a Cheyenne Mountain briefing on June 5, 1963. The chair, which had a plaque affixed to the underside of the chair to commemorate the occasion, was then placed in the Peterson Air and Space Museum. Office building Several million dollars were spent since 1993 to gut the building, make numerous improvements and turn it into office space. Lars Akerberg purchased the building in 1993, and Premiere Global Services (PGi), which operated a teleconference center, became its largest tenant. The building went into foreclosure in early 2012 with an occupancy rate of only 45% after Premier Global had moved out the previous year. According to Turner Commercial Research, the city's office vacancy rate (14.5%) is almost three times what it was in 2000. Buildings like the Chidlaw struggle to compete with modern buildings that are more conveniently located either along the Interstate 25 corridor or within downtown Colorado Springs.

The season officially began on May 15 in the northeast Pacific Ocean and on June 1 in the central northern Pacific. They ended on November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the time of year when most tropical cyclones form in northeast Pacific Ocean. Before the satellite age started in the 1960s, data prior to that time on Pacific hurricanes is extremely unreliable as most east Pacific storms are of no threat to land. Of the four known tropical systems, two became hurricanes. Although only a tropical storm, the first storm of the season was the deepest, with a pressure of . This season is unusual in that no one was killed, no damage was inflicted, and no tropical cyclones made landfall. Seasonal summary Only four known systems were observed during the 1953 season. This was below the average at that time, which was six. Furthermore, the season was well below the 1949-2006 average of 13 named storms and had the fewest storms in the hurricane database. Only two tropical cyclones reached hurricane status, compared to the modern-day average of seven. Furthermore, 1953 is also one of the few seasons without a major hurricane. This season was part of a decade-long absence of major hurricanes; from 1950–56, no major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale) were reported in the Eastern Pacific basin. However, it is possible that some storms were missed due to the lack of satellite coverage in the region in addition to the lack of Hurricane Hunter data, which did not become available until the following year. The four known storms developed between the 14° N and the 20° N. All of the storms remained at sea throughout their lifetime; no deaths nor damages were noted during the season, though moisture from two of them reached the Southwestern United States. The season got onto an extremely slow start. The first storm formed in late August. At that time, it was believed that two systems would have long formed by then on average. According to the modern-day National Hurricane Center, 8-10 storms would have by that time on average. Additionally, 1953 had the latest start date of any Pacific hurricane season on record. Additionally, 1953 is the only season in the database to have no storms by August. Throughout the 1953 hurricane season, the Weather Bureau office in Los Angeles (WBOLA) issued 42 advisories during the season, mostly due to the storms' threat to Southern California. In addition to the four storms in the dataset, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and Japan Meteorological Agency, on October 22 Tropical Storm Alice crossed the International Dateline, entering into CPHC's area of responsibility. The storm eventually became extratropical on October 23 over open waters. Systems =Tropical Storm One= Thunderstorm activity off the Mexican coast was quite for the first half of August. Based on data from six ships, a closed atmospheric circulation may have formed near the Revillagigedo Islands at 0000 UTC on August 23, which are situated roughly south of the Baja California Peninsula. At this time, winds were estimated to be no higher than . After formation, One moved west-northwest and on August 25, the storm attained its peak intensity of . Furthermore, the ship S.S. Sirocco measured a minimum barometric pressure of . Although the WBOLA reported that the storm dissipated that night near the peninsula, the HURDAT database suggests that the storm maintained peak intensity for another day, until August 27 when it dissipated. The remnants of Tropical Storm One brought heavy rains to Arizona at the very end of the month. Rainfall peaked at in Williams, while two other weather stations reported more than of precipitation. =Tropical Storm Two= Ships reports from the Hawaiian Islands to Panama indicated that an area of disturbed weather formed just west of the Revillagigedo island group. Initially, evidence of closed wind circulation was not sufficient enough to warrant an upgrade into a tropical disturbance. By the afternoon, pressures in the region began to fall. By that night, it was estimated to have developed winds of . A tropical storm formed on September 9; meanwhile, ship reports indicated a pressure of and sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). Maintaining peak intensity for a day, the low moved northwest before dissipating on September 10 as barometric pressures began to rise. The remnants of the storm later brought rain to Central California on September 15. =Hurricane Three= A tropical cyclone first formed on September 13 near Western Mexico (in the extreme southern Gulf of California) while generating winds of . It traveled north-northeastward and Three was upgraded into a hurricane on September 14 while reaching its maximum sustained wind speed of . After turning east-northeast, Hurricane Three attained its peak pressure of . The storm held on to its wind speed, until September 17, when the storm dissipated. The remnants of the storm deluged the Mexican coast with rain, especially in Sinaloa. Winds of were reported in Mazatlan on land; however, no damage was recorded. =Hurricane Four= On October 1, a closed low formed in the Gulf of Tehuantepec from an area of disturbed weather, which had persisted for several days prior. The next day, the hurricane database suggests that Four became a hurricane on October 2 while peaking in intensity, with winds of . That day, a peak pressure of was measured. The hurricane dissipated on October 8 later after holding on to its maximum wind speed for six days before finally dissipating nowhere near land.

He has been involved in theatrical productions, concerts, operas and special events around the world. Whiting is also known for developing \\"Stage Write,\\" an app that allows creation, duplication and editing of floorplan charts to facilitate stage choreography.  Biography  Whiting was born on March 27, 1972, in Denver, Colorado, the son of David L. Whiting and Bette Whiting (née Snelson). He was the third of five siblings. He grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah. At the age of 10, he was introduced to theater, dance, acting and singing, under Xan S. Johnson's tutoring at The University of Utah's Children's Theater program. In 1996 he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Music Dance Theater from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Whiting began his performing career after graduation. He made his first professional appearance in 1996 as Quasimodo in Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame at Disney/MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida. In 1997, Whiting moved to New York City and performed in numerous regional theatrical productions. With a desire to create new works for the theater, Whiting began to find work as a director and choreographer. He was hired as an assistant director for the national tours of Hairspray and The Producers, which is how he was introduced to Susan Stroman. In 2007, Stroman invited him to be assistant choreographer on the Broadway production of Young Frankenstein, marking Whiting's first Broadway credit. He went on to collaborate with Stroman on several other projects. He was assistant director and choreographer on Happiness at Lincoln Center and was associate director/choreographer on The Scottsboro Boys, which received 12 Tony Nominations. He was also Diane Paulus' associate director on the Broadway revival of Hair, which won the Tony Award for best musical revival. In 2013, Jeff was the Associate Director for Big Fish (musical).

Survival to hospital discharge rates are as low as 7% for cardiac arrest in general and although treatable, rearrest may worsen these survival chances. Rearrest commonly occurs in the out-of-hospital setting under the treatment of health care providers.  Cause  Rearrest, which may have a similar etiology to cardiac arrest, is characterized as a compromise in the electrical activity of the heart often due to an ischemic event. The post- arrest patient who has recently obtained pulses, is dependent on prehospital care providers for ventilation assistance, arrhythmia correction through medication and blood pressure monitoring. Therefore insufficient care in any of these treatments may contribute to a rearrest event. The lethal arrhythmia may be either ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia or asystole. A strong suspect that may be a critical contributor to rearrest is the administration of chest compressions to the patient when the patient has already achieved a pulsatile rhythm. It is often difficult to determine the presence of a pulse in a cardiac arrest patient, thus chest compressions may be given by the unaware resuscitator and this added stress on the heart may contribute to a rearrest event.  Treatment  Similar to cardiac arrest, rearrest is treated with both cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. The goal of treatment is to reestablish a self perfusing heart through correction of the electrical activity within the heart. CPR entails chest compressions along with rescue breaths, while defibrillation involves a biphasic shock across the chest with the purpose of restarting the electrical activity of the heart. Anti-arrythmic drugs are commonly given during the ROSC phase. These drugs may include lidocaine and amiodarone.  Prognosis  Rearrest may reduce the likelihood of survival when compared to patients who have had just one episode of cardiac arrest. Overall resuscitation rates have been estimated to be about 34%, however survival to hospital discharge rates are as low as 7%. This phenomenon may be contributed to rearrest.  Epidemiology  A recent study by Salcido et al. (2010) ascertained rearrest in all initial and rearrest rhythms treated by any level of Emergency Medical Service (EMS), finding a rearrest rate of 36% and a lower but not significantly different rate of survival to hospital discharge in cases with rearrest compared to those without rearrest.  Research  Current research seeks to predict the event of rearrest after patients have already achieved ROSC. Biosignals, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), have the potential to predict the onset of rearrest and are currently being investigated to preemptively warn health care providers that rearrest could be imminent. A stronger pulse detector would also contribute to lowering the rate of rearrest. If the resuscitator could accurately know when the patient has achieved ROSC, there would be less instances of chest compressions being provided when a native pulse is present.

Construction on the 1st operational complex, Titan I Missile Complex 1A, began in April 1959, mining excavation of 1/2 million cubic yards of rock was completed by 4 June 1961, and the site was finished in December 1961 (the dedication was on April 18, 1962).

The partnership was the first Japanese sourced major film financing for Disney and the largest Japanese financing outside of a outright purchase of a film studio. Terms Disney has received better terms with Touchwood than with their previous funding partnerships, Silver Screen. The Partnership offers a lower interest than Silver Screens due to the lower Japanese interest rates in 1990. Also, there are no guarantees regarding the minimum financial performance of the financed films. Disney's Buena Vista Pictures Distribution receives a 30% fee before any money goes to a Disney—-Touchwood joint venture. After the joint venture takes into account third-party participation and residuals, the joint venture pays 42% of the remaining to Buena Vista. If the limited partners do not capture back their initial investment after the last film is release plus 5 years, Disney is required to return only the distribution fees up to the original invested amount. Thus the Disney's limited its potential loss to its printing and advertising expenses which could be from $200 million to $300 million. History On October 23, 1990, The Walt Disney Company formed Touchwood Pacific Partners I which would supplant the Silver Screen Partnership series as their movie studios' primary funding source. Animated movies were not included in the slate for Touchwood. Yamaichi General Finance Co. planned to sell $180 in limited partnerships, but sold in a private placement to about 50 Japanese institutional or private investors in the amount of $191 million. An additional $420 million line of credit was arranged for the partnership with a group of banks led by Citibank and including Fuji Bank Ltd., Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. By May 1992, the first ten Touchwood films averaged $31 million at the box office (BO) and a low 2 to 1 revenue-to-cost ratio, compared to a $45 million BO average and 5-to-1 ratio for Disney's 1985 to mid-1990s films. However, some Hollywood executives thought that Disney was issuing weaker films in the spring to leave the summer for high-potential films. The next three films would have to match the 1985–mid-1990s average.

The issues involved not only whom to appoint as the successor to Muhammad, but also what attributes a true successor should have. Sunnis regarded Caliphs as a secular leaders, (originally elected by general agreement, though later the hereditary principle became the norm). To the Shiite, however, the question of succession is a matter of designation of an individual (Ali) through divine command. In the same way, Shias believed that each Imam designated the next Imam by the leave of God. So within Shia Islam it makes no difference to the Imam's position whether he is chosen as a Caliph or not. Historians dispute the origin of Shia Islam, with many Western scholars positing that Shiism began as a political faction rather than as a religious movement.Francis Robinson, Atlas of the Islamic World Since 1500, pg. 23. New York: Facts on File, 1984. However, Jafri disagrees, considering this concept or religious- political separation as an anachronistic application of a Western concept. Sunnis, on the other hand, often claim that Shiite beliefs only first formed under the scheming of Abdullah ibn Saba'; Sunnis reject the idea that Ali followed any beliefs that were contrary to the rest of the Sahaba. Shia View Shia Islam began when Abu Bakr, Umar and Abu Ubaydah al Jarrah offered each other the helpers (ansar) despite the announcement of Ghadir Khumm where Ali was declared master of the believers. Ali and his supporters stayed in his house then Abu Bakr sent Umar to threaten those in side by attempting to burn the house. After a confrontation Ali eventually pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr. Ali would remind the companions of the tradition of Ghadir over 10 years later in the courtyard of the mosque in Kufa in a tradition known as Yawm al Ruhba. Shi’i sources are clear about the collusion of the above individuals as well Sunni ones, for example where Umar announces close to his passing that he would elect Abu Ubaydah or Salim (one of the first people to pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr) if they were still alive. Therefore the Sunni leadership doctrine was really a reaction by some individuals to Ali being announced as their master. These personalities are known by some as the people of the contract (ahl al-‘Uqd): It was narrated that Qais bin 'Ubad said: \\"While I was in the Masjid in the first row, a man pulled me from behind and moved me aside, and took my place. By Allah, I could not focus on my prayer, then when he left I saw that it was Ubayy bin Ka'b. He said: '0 boy, may Allah protect you from harm. This is what the Prophet instructed us to do, to stand directly behind him.' Then he (Ubayy) turned to face the Qiblah and said: 'Doomed are Ah1 Al-'Uqd, by the Lord of the Ka'bah! - three times.'Then he said: 'By Allah, I am not sad for them, but I am sad for the people whom they have misled.' I said: '0 Abu Ya'qub, what do you mean by Ah1 Al-'Uqd?' He said: 'The rulers.\\"' https://sunnah.com/nasai/10/32 From then on the different Shia groups developed different Imamate theories with the most popular current form alleging having 12 imams with the last one in occultation, which means he has been hidden from the view of the people until the end of time. Other Shia groups do not limit the number of imams and instead encourage that the imam be a just and knowledgeable leader. Starting point Shiism began for the first time with a reference made to the partisans of Ali the first leader of the Ahl al-Bayt (Household of the prophet). In the early years of Islamic history there was no \\"orthodox\\" Sunni or \\"heretical\\" Shiite, but rather of two points of view that were drifting steadily until became manifest as early as the death of Muhammad the prophet of Islam. On the death of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, in an assembly known as Saqifah a group of Muhajirun forced on the Ansar their wish for the acceptance of Abu Bakr as the successor to the prophet, Muhammad who was to be washed and buried. A distinguished absentee of this gathering was Ali the cousin and son-in-law of the prophet. There were some people who on view of some statement made by Muhammad in his lifetime believed that Ali should have taken the position, not only as a temporal head (Caliph) but also as spiritual head(Imam). According to the Sunni sources, Ali \\"was a valued counselor of the caliphs who preceded him\\"; Umar is, therefore, reported by some of the important early Sunni authors as saying: \\"Had there not been Ali, 'Umar would have perished.\\" Jafri, on the other hand, quotes Veccia Vaglieri as saying \\"Ali was included in the council of the caliphs, but although it is probable that he was asked for advice on legal matters in view of his excellent knowledge of the Quran and the Sunnah, it is extremely doubtful whether his advice was accepted by Umar, who had been a ruling power even during the caliphate of Abu Bakr.\\" And that is why Ali's decisions rarely find a place in the later developed Sunni schools of law, while Umar's decisions find common currency among them. According to some sources, the Shiites are believed to have started as a political party and developed into a religious movement, influencing Sunnis and producing a number of important sects. Other scholars argue Western scholarship that views Shi'ism as a political movement is factually incorrect. According to Jafri, however, the origin of shiite is not merely the result of political partisanship concerning the leadership of Ummah. In his book the origin of shiite islam he points out that those who emphasize the political nature of Shi'ism are \\"perhaps too eager to project the modern Western notion of the separation of church and state back into seventh century\\", since such an approach \\"implies the spontaneous appearance of Shi'ism rather than its gradual emergence and development\\". Jafri says Islam is basically religious because Muhammad was appointed and sent by God to deliver His message, and political because of the circumstances in which it arose and grew. In the same way Shi'ism, in its inherent nature, has always been both religious and political. In one occasion, for example, when the Shura after Umar proposed that they would give him the Caliphate on condition that he acted according to Quran, Sunnah of Muhammad, and precedents established by the first two caliphs, he refused to accept the last condition. In another occasion when Ali's Partisans asked him to play politic and reaffirm Muawiyah I as the Governor of Syria and sweet-talk him with promises before they could topple him from his position Ali said I have no doubt that what you advise is best for this life, he retorted. But I will have nothing to do with such underhanded schemes, neither yours nor Muawiya's. I do not compromise my faith by cheating, nor do I give contemptible men any say in my command. I will never confirm Muawiya as governor of Syria, not even for two days. Ali accepted the political realities of his day, however, believed he was better qualified for the caliphate, which is evidence from the historic exposition of Ali, known as Sermon of the roar of a camel. According to Shiite, Ali declined to make use of the military support offered to him by Abu Sufyan ibn Harb to fight Abu Bakr. At the same time, however, he did not recognize Abu Bakr and refused to pay him homage for six months. Imamate the Distinctive Institution of Shiite Islam The distinctive institution of Shi’ism is the Imamate and the question of the Imamate is inseparable from that of walayat, or the esoteric function of interpreting the inner mysteries of the Quran and the Shari’ah. Both Shiite and Sunni are in agreement over the two functions of prophet hood: to reveal God's law to men, and to guide men toward God. However, while Sunnis believe that both have come to an end with the death of Muhammad, Shiites believe that whereas legislation ended, the function of guiding and \\"explaining divine law continued through the line of Imams.\\" In Shiite theology, thus, God does not guide via authoritative texts (i.e. the Qur'an and Hadith) only but also guides through some specially equipped individuals known as Imams. This constitution, Shiite says, is not limited to Islam, but each great messenger of God had two covenants, one concerning the next prophet who would eventually come, and one regarding the immediate successor, the Imam. For example, Sam was an imam for Noah, Ishmael was an Imam for Abraham, Aaron or Joshua for Moses, Simon, John and all the disciples for Jesus, and Ali and his descendants for Muhammad. It is narrated from the sixth imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq who had said \\"where there to remain on the earth but two men, one of them would be the proof of God\\". The different between apostles (Rasuls), the prophets(Nabi) and the Imams, thus, is described as follows: Rasul sees and hears the angel in awakness and sleep. Nabi hears the angel and sees him while asleep, but does not see him while awake though hears the speech. Imam (muhaddith) is the one who hears the angel in awakness while does not see him in awakness or sleep. According to the fifth Imam, however, this kind of revelation is not the revelation of prophethood but rather like the inspiration (ilham) which came to Mary (mother of Jesus), the mother of Moses and to the bee. Hence the question was not only who the successor to Muhammad was, but also what the attributes of a true successor were.  Imamate vs Caliphate  The very life of Ali and his actions show that he accepted the previous caliphs as understood in the Sunni sense of Caliphate (the ruler and the administrator of the Sharia), but confined the function of Walayah, after the Prophet, to himself. That is why he is respected as the fourth caliph in the Sunni sense and as an Imam in the Shi’ite sense. Sunnites, on the other hand, reject Imamate on the basis of Quran which says Muhammad, as the last of the Prophets, was not to be succeeded by any of his family; and that is why God let Muhammad's sons to die in infancy. And that is why Muhammad did not nominate a successor, as he wanted to leave the succession to be resolved \\"by the Muslim Community on the basis of the Quranic principle of consultation (Shura).\\" The question Madelung propose here is that why the family members of Muhammad should not inherit other (other than prophethood) aspects of Muhammad's character such as rule (hukm) wisdom (Hikmah), and the Imamate. Since The Sunnite concept of the \\"true caliphate\\" itself defines it as a \\"succession of the Prophet in every respect except his prophethood\\". Madelung further asks \\"If God really wanted to indicate that he should not be succeeded by any of his family, why did He not let his grandsons and other kin die like his sons?\\" It is said that one day the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid questioned the seventh Shiite Imam, Musa al-Kadhim, saying why he had permitted people to call him \\"Son of Allah's Apostle,\\" while he and his forefathers were Muhammad's daughter's children. And that \\"the progeny belongs to the male (Ali) and not to the female (Fatimah)\\". In response al-Kadhim recited the verses Quran, 6:84 and Quran, 6:85 and then asked \\"Who is Jesus's father, O Commander of the faithful?\\". \\"Jesus had no father.\\" Said Harun. Al-kadhim argued that God in these verses had ascribed Jesus to the descendants of the prophets through Mary; \\"similarly, we have been ascribed to the descendants of the Prophet through our mother Fatimah,\\" Said al-Kadhim. It is related that Harun asked Musa to give him more evidence and proof. Al-Kadhim, thus, recited the verse of Mubahala arguing that \\"None claims that the Prophet made someone enter under the cloak when he challenged the Christians to a contest of prayer to God (mubahala) except Ali, Fatimah, Hasan, and Husayn. So in the verse: \\"Our sons\\" refers to Hasan and Husayn. In one of his long letters to Muawiya I, summoning him to pledge allegiance to him, Hasan ibn Ali made use of the argument of his father, Ali, which the latter had advanced against Abu Bakr after the death of Muhammad. Ali had said: \\"If Quraysh could claim the leadership over the Ansar on the grounds that the Prophet belonged to Quraysh, then the members of his family, who were the nearest to him in every respect, were better qualified for the leadership of the community.\\" Mu'awiya's response, to this argument is also interesting, for Muawiyah, while recognizing the excellence of the Muhammad’s family, further asserted that he would willingly follow Hasan's request were it not for his own superior experience in governing:\\"…You are asking me to settle the matter peacefully and surrender, but the situation concerning you and me today is like the one between you [your family] and Abu Bakr after the death of the Prophet…I have a longer period of reign [probably referring to his governorship], and am more experienced, better in policies, and older in age than you. …if you enter into obedience to me now, you will accede to the caliphate after me.\\" Wrote back Muawiyya. In his book, The Origins and Early Development of Shi’a Islam, Jafri comes to the conclusion that the majority of the Muslims who became known as Sunnis afterwards \\"placed the religious leadership in the totality of the community (Ahl al-Sunnah wal Jamaah), represented by the Ulama, as the custodian of religion and the exponent of the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet, while accepting state authority as binding… A minority of the Muslims, on the other hand, could not find satisfaction for their religious aspirations except in the charismatic leadership from among the people of the house of the Prophet, the Ahl al-Bayt, as the sole exponents of the Quran and the Prophetic Sunnah, although this minority too had to accept the state's authority. This group was called the Shiite.\\" Husayn's uprising To Sunnis, Husayn's decision to travel to Iraq was a not mere political adventuring that went wrong, rather it was a decision to uphold the religion of Islam. To uphold the teachings of His Grand Father Prophet Muhammad and to stand against the wrong changes being incorporated in Islam by Yazid I.(Haider) According to Shiite historians,Lapidus p. 47 on the other hand, Husayn had \\"received plenty of warning of the collapse of the shii revolt in Kufa as he approached Iraq.\\" Shiite historians record that on his journey to Kufa when Husayn received grim news from Kufa, he addressed his companions telling that \\"of the death and destruction that awaited them ahead.\\" At this point, they argue, Husayn could have retired to Medina or at least accepted the offer which was made to him to refuge in the mountain strongholds of the Tayy tribe. But he refused these and even addressed his companions telling them to leave him as he proceed toward Kufa. Jafri, the Shiite historian, writes: \\"Husayn did not try to organize or mobilize military support, which he easily could have done in the Hijaz, nor did he even try to exploit whatever physical strength was available to him… Is it conceivable that anyone striving for power would ask his supporters to abandon him,… What then did Husayn have in mind? Why was he still heading for Kufa?... According to Jafri it is disappointing that historians have given too much attention \\"to external aspects of the event of Karbala and has never tried to analyze the inner history and agonizing conflict in Husayn's mind\\". He points out that Husayn \\"was aware of the fact that a victory achieved through military strength and might is always temporal, because another stronger power can in course of time bring it down in ruins. But a victory achieved through suffering and sacrifice is everlasting and leaves permanent imprints on man's consciousness… The natural process of conflict and struggle between action and reaction was now at work. That is, Muhammad's progressive Islamic action had succeeded in suppressing Arab conservatism, embodied in heathen pre-Islamic practices and ways of thinking. But in less than thirty years' time this Arab conservatism revitalized itself as a forceful reaction to challenge Muhammad's action once again. The forces of this reaction had already moved into motion with the rise of Muawiya , but the succession of Yazid was a clear sign that the reactionary forces had mobilized themselves and had now re-emerged with full vigor. The strength of this reaction, embodied in Yazid's character, was powerful enough to suppress or at least deface Muhammad's action. Islam was now, in the thinking of Husayn, in dire need of reactivation of Muhammad's action against the old Arabian reaction, and thus a complete shake-up. \\" Jafri continue to say that \\"Husayn's acceptance of Yazid, with the latter's openly reactionary attitude against Islamic norms, would not have meant merely a political arrangement, as had been the case with Hasan and Muawiya, but an endorsement of Yazid's character and way of life as well.\\" He then comes to the conclusion that Husayn \\"realized that mere force of arms would not have saved Islamic action and consciousness. To him it needed a shaking and jolting of hearts and feelings. This, he decided, could only be achieved through sacrifice and sufferings.\\" \\"for those who\\", he writes, \\"fully appreciate the heroic deeds and sacrifices of, for example, Socrates and Joan of Arc, both of whom embraced death for their ideals, and above all of the great sacrifice of Jesus Christ for the redemption of mankind. It is in this light that we should read Husayn's replies to those well-wishers who advised him not to go to Iraq. It also explains why Husayn took with him his women and children, though advised by Ibn Abbas that should he insist on his project, at least he should not take his family with him.\\" \\"Aware of the extent of the brutal nature of the reactionary forces, Husayn knew that after killing him the Umayyads would make his women and children captives and take them all the way from Kufa to Damascus. This caravan of captives of Muhammad's immediate family would publicize Husayn's message and would force the Muslims' hearts to ponder on the tragedy. It would make the Muslims think of the whole affair and would awaken their consciousness.\\" So, according to Gafriii that is exactly what happened. He continue to writes that \\"Had Husayn not shaken and awakened Muslim consciousness by this method, who knows whether Yazid's way of life would have become standard behavior in the Muslim community, endorsed and accepted by the grandson of the Prophet.\\" Then he arrives to the conclusion that \\"although after Yazid kingship did prevail in Islam, and though the character and behavior in the personal lives of these kings was not very different from that of Yazid, but the change in thinking which prevailed after the sacrifice of Husayn always served as a line of distinction between Islamic norms and the personal character of the rulers.\\" Notes References  Shia Islam Shia ","title":"Origin of Shia Islam"},{"id":"36483239","text":"David Graves is a fictional character, a DC Comics supervillain, and enemy of the Justice League.

It was intended to produce a trustworthy throw of one or more dice. It was discovered in 1985 in Germany. It is preserved in the Rheinisches Landesmuseum of Bonn. The tower dates to the fourth century AD and was apparently presented as a gift. It bears two Latin texts. The longer text commemorates a military defeat of the Picts. The shorter text wishes good luck to the unnamed recipients of the item. Discovery The dice tower was discovered in 1985 near the modern villages of Vettweiss and Froitzheim. During the Roman era this location was in the province of Germania Inferior on the Imperial frontier with Germania. This was the site of a villa in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The major military centre of Cologne was located nearby. Description It is an upright, hollow cuboid of copper-alloy plate designed to sit level on a flat surface. The top of the dice tower is open, allowing for the introduction of dice, and it contains three levels of projecting baffles which would produce random motion in the dice as they fell through the tower. The dice would then emerge at the base of the tower via a miniature flight of steps. The dice, while emerging, would ring three bells which formerly hung above the exit. One of these bells survives intact. The tower is decorated on all faces with pierced patterns and two short Latin texts are displayed prominently. The front face of the tower bears the words: :PICTOS VICTOS :HOSTIS DELETA :LVDITE SECVRI Which can be translated as: :With the Picts defeated, :The enemy has been destroyed, :So play in safety. Around the top of the three remaining faces is the phrase, :UTERE FELIX VIVAS Which can be translated as: :Use [me] and live luckily/happily.

A Democrat, he has served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives since 2007. He represents the Eleventh Norfolk District, which includes his hometown of Dedham, Westwood, and the Eighth Precinct of Walpole. McMurtry attended elementary school at the now-closed Dexter School in Dedham, and graduated from Dedham High School. He earned his B.S.B.A. in Management from Northeastern University. He has been self-employed since the age of twenty as the owner of several small businesses, including PM Productions, a video store he created while in college, and the Dedham Community Theatre, which he currently owns and operates. McMurtry is actively involved in the local branch of Rotary International, where he served twice as club president. Representative McMurtry ran in a special election in 2007 to replace outgoing Representative Robert Coughlin. McMurtry ran as an independent having not held any prior elected office. He won a plurality of the vote in the three way race, garnering 37.6% of the vote overall and 53.8% in his hometown of Dedham. McMurtry ran unopposed for re-election in every subsequent biannual election until John McDonald challenged him in 2018.  Personal life  McMurtry is Catholic and is a member of the Knights of Columbus.  Political career  In 2018, McMurtry was one of the original sponsors of Bill H.4479, which placed restrictions on e-cigarettes and raised the age for buying tobacco from 18 to 21. Citing the increasing vaping epidemic among youth, McMurtry sponsored the bill in able to \\"prevent young people from taking up the deadly habit and getting addicted to nicotine products\\". Governor Charlie Baker subsequently signed McMurtry's legislation. The same year, McMurtry filed legislation to protect independent auto repair shops against vehicle manufacturers. Some vehicle manufacturers use wireless technology to bypass current right-to- repair information sharing laws, and McMurtry's bill intends to renew discussion on keeping laws updated with the progress of technology. In January 2019, The Boston Globe reported that McMurtry allegedly \\"walked up behind an incoming legislator and grabbed her backside during an orientation cocktail hour for newly elected members.\\" McMurtry denied the allegations. The Globe also reported that McMurtry put an aide on leave after the aide filed a lengthy complaint against McMurtry's chief of staff. The aide was given a one year's salary, signed a nondisclosure agreement, and resigned. The House of Representative conducted an investigation into the allegations against McMurtry which exonerated him of any wrong doing. The Boston Herald's Peter Lucas wrote that the allegations had been suspicious from the outset and that it seemed as though this was a political hit aimed at Speaker of the House Robert A. DeLeo. McMurtry currently serves as the House Chair of the Committee on Tourism, Arts and Cultural Development.

A tropical depression formed on July 21 far from land. It became Tropical Storm Ignacio later that day. Ignacio then rapidly intensified and peaked with 130 mph (215 km/h) winds on July 24. Ignacio weakened quickly, though it briefly leveled off in intensity as a Category 2 hurricane. Ignacio was downgraded into a tropical storm on July 26 while passing south of Hawaii. Continuing to weaken, Ignacio dissipated on July 27. A hurricane watch was briefly issued for the Hawaiian Islands even though the watch was dropped when Ignacio weakened. However, Ignacio still brought high waves and light rainfall to the islands. A few roads were closed, but otherwise, damage was minimal. Meteorological history Based on data from the ships UJGN and Okean and satellite imagery, the next tropical cyclone of 1985 was spotted early on July 21 while located southwest of San Diego. Situated over sea surface temperatures, the depression attained tropical storm intensity a few hours later. Intensifying further west than normal, the storm reached winds of 70 mph (140 km/h) roughly 24 hours after formation. Nine hours later, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center dropped advisories on Ignacio as it had left their area of responsibility and into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's (CPHC) warning zone. A Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated Ignacio at daybreak on July 22, and found that Ignacio had developed a well-defined eye and winds of 85 mph (165 km/h). Based on this, the CPHC upgraded Ignacio to hurricane status. Continuing to rapidly intensify, Hurricane Ignacio moved west-northwest at and was soon upgraded into Category 2 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS). Several hours later, the hurricane attained major hurricane status, Category 3 or higher on the SSHS. Later that day, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft discovered that Hurricane Ignacio had reached its peak wind speed of 130 mph (210 km/h) and a central pressure of , making Ignacio one of the most intense hurricane to traverse the Central Pacific. The hurricane held peak intensity for several hours, however, an upper trough northwest of the Hawaiian Islands was gradually approaching Ignacio. Subsequently, the environment was rapidly becoming less conductive as the trough induced increased southwesterly wind shear and introduced colder and drier air into Ignacio's circulation. By 1800 UTC July 24, Ignacio was no longer a major hurricane as satellite imagery suggested that the eye had become irregular and soon disappeared. Air Force aircraft confirmed the weakening trend despite being located in an area where other hurricanes such as Hurricane Dot in 1959 and Hurricane Fico in 1978 maintained their intensity around the same time of the year. Minor re- intensification may have occurred the next day as the eye re-developed, however, this theory is not supported in the hurricane database. The hurricane resumed its westerly course, and Hurricane Ignacio was downgraded a Category 1 hurricane at 1800 UTC on July 25, and a tropical storm the next day. While passing south of Hawaii, Ignacio dropped to tropical depression status early on July 27, and dissipated shortly after that. Preparations and impact Because of a strong trough was located northwest of Ignacio, many tropical cyclone forecast models predicted a more northerly track than what ultimately occurred. By July 24, a high surf advisory was in effect for east-facing shores of Hawaii; subsequently, a hurricane watch was issued at 0300 UTC July 25 for the Big Island of Hawaii Because the island chain only recently recovered from the devastating Hurricane Iwa during the 1982 Pacific hurricane season, civil defense authorities evacuated low-lying residents. One drugstore opened a special hurricane supplies center. In addition, beach activities on south-facing shores were cancelled. Roughly 24 hours after the hurricane watch was issued, the watch was cancelled as Ignacio resumed weakening though a small craft advisory initially remained in effect for the Hawaiian Islands. Ignacio resulted in to surf, peaking midday on July 25. Rainfall from the storm was generally light, with a few reports exceeding on the windward slopes of Maui and the Big Island. Some structures and roads near Kalapana and Kapoh were damaged. Many secondary roads that led to the beaches were closed. Picnic areas and nature trails in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park were closed and overnight camping throughout the state was banned.

History section of the official site of the 2nd Infantry Division History =World War I= The Second Army was part of the Romanian offensive in Transylvania during the autumn of 1916. The offensive of the 2nd Romanian Army in Transylvania Following the failure of the offensive and due to the Central Powers counterattack, which led to the occupation of most of the country's territory, the Second Army, along with the remnants of other Romanian military units, were forced to retreat into the region of Moldavia, the only Romanian territory unoccupied by enemy forces. The Second Army, among other units, underwent a process of reorganization and modernization in the winter of 1916 - 1917 as part of French General Henri Berthelot's mission to revitalize the exhausted and decimated Romanian military. Article about Berthelot's mission in Romania The Central Powers advance towards Moldavia was hampered by bad weather and poor infrastructure and as a result hostilities were only resumed in the summer of 1917. A plan to break through the lines of Field Marshal August von Mackensen's German forces was elaborated, requiring a dual offensive from the First Army in the Nămoloasa sector and the Second Army in the Mărăşti sector. Although the Nămoloasa offensive was canceled, the Second Army's attack led to the Battle of Mărăşti, which ended with the Romanians' victory after creating a breach 30 km wide and 20 km deep in the front, after nine days of fighting, between 22 July and 1 August. The Battle of Marasti (July 1917) Field Marshal von Mackensen launched a counterattack on 6 August 1917, which led to the Battle of Mărăşeşti; the Romanians managed to resist against repeated German attacks until 8 September, when both sides ran out of fresh units. Victory came at a great cost, with the Romanians losing over 27,000 men, including 610 officers; the Germans lost 47,000 men. The motto of the Romanian Army during the battle was \\"Pe aicea nu se trece\\" (English: \\"You shall not pass\\"). Battle of Marasesti (August-September 1917) At the same time, German and Austro-Hungarian forces launched an attack in the Oituz valley against forces of the Second Army. The Battle of Oituz lasted from 8 August to 22 August 1917 and ended with a Romanian strategic victory, as the Austro-Hungarian forces failed to break through into the Trotuş Valley. Third battle of Oituz (August 1917) On 1 June 1918, the Second Army was disbanded after Romania was forced to conclude the Treaty of Bucharest with the Central Powers. = World War I commanders = *Divisional general Alexandru Averescu : 15 August 1916 - 25 August 1916 *Divisional general Grigore C.

In college, he was the 2001 Mountain West Conference Player of the Year while playing for Brigham Young (BYU). Professionally, Wesley's staggered career began in 2001 and officially ended in 2010. He now works in the insurance industry.  Early life  Wesley was born in Suva, Fiji as one of five children to parents Hiagi and Susan Wesley, who met one another while attending BYU. He grew up in Provo, Utah and attended Provo High School. While on the basketball team, Wesley guided the Bulldogs to state championships in 1994–95 and 1996–97. For his high school career he averaged 21.7 points and 10.8 rebounds and was a three-time all-state selection. Both the Salt Lake Tribune and Deseret News named him their MVP. Wesley also represented Western Samoa in National Junior Olympics. He was recruited by universities such as Colorado State, Hawaii, Washington State, LSU, Marquette, Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount. Ultimately, however, Wesley chose BYU and enrolled the fall of 1997.  College  During Mekeli Wesley's four-year career as a Cougar, he scored 1,740 points and held the school record for most free throws made in a game with 16 (since broken by Jimmer Fredette). As a freshman, Wesley started in 29 of 30 games, was named to the WAC All-Newcomer Team, was named the most valuable player of the Cougar Classic, and held averages of 13.5 points and 5.0 rebounds per game.

Then, as a junior in 1999–2000, he increased his averages to career-highs of 16.8 points and 5.8 rebounds en route to an All-Mountain West Conference Second Team selection. In his final collegiate season, Mekeli led BYU in scoring at 17.2 points per game and in rebounding at 5.2 per game. For the first time since 1993, BYU won or shared a conference title, and for the first time since 1992 won the conference tournament championship.

Through active participation in hockey, IHIH student-athletes learn the fundamentals of the game, engage in an active lifestyle, and broaden their life experiences. Since 1987, thousands of boys and girls have taken part in the program and have grown into capable, responsible adults who continue to live, work and, in many cases, raise their own children in Harlem. Each season, Ice Hockey in Harlem looks to offer new athletic and educational opportunities for children in its community. IHIH uses the sport of hockey to engage students and improve their self-esteem, while also providing a safe after school alternative that keeps them from harm and improves their school attendance and grades. Ice Hockey in Harlem is also a member program of the National Hockey League's Hockey Is For Everyone initiative and has enjoyed a long relationship with New York Rangers, dating back to its inception. History and growth Ice Hockey in Harlem began in the winter of 1987 with forty eager participants ranging in age from 9–12 years old. All participants agreed to attend weekly classroom sessions and skate one night a week. In class these Ice Hockey in Harlem pioneers were taught math, reading, and geography using hockey cities and statistics as teaching tools. With a cursory knowledge of the basics, the youngsters donned mismatched, second-hand equipment and wobbled onto the ice of Lasker Rink, an outdoor facility at the northern end of Central Park. Under the tutelage of Co- Founders Dave Wilk and Todd Levy, and with the help of former New York Ranger Pat Hickey, the boys were soon skating, shooting, and passing as though they had been playing the game for years. After that rookie season, the program managed to raise enough money to send one player to a summer hockey camp in California. By Year Five, Ice Hockey in Harlem had expanded to 125 kids. With this increase in enrollment, IHIH was on the ice at Lasker Rink three nights a week for clinics, a six-team intramural league, and an All-Star touring team. The New York Rangers were generously supporting the program with a mid-season clinic at Lasker and fund-raising efforts. That summer players went off to summer hockey camp, in Canada and the U.S. Two players graduated from the program to attend prep schools on IHIH scholarships. Before the start of Year Seven, the Ice Hockey in Harlem Board of Directors decided that expansion of the program and the increase in participants exceeded the capabilities of an all-volunteer staff. The full-time staff includes a Hockey Director and an Events Manager. Today Now in its third decade, Ice Hockey in Harlem has become a widely recognized and highly respected name throughout the hockey community. It has also served as the model for numerous successful programs throughout the country. For nearly two decades now, Ice Hockey in Harlem has helped thousands of needy youngsters learn a sport that would otherwise be financially unavailable to them. More importantly, through its educational and community service components, IHIH has given its participants the tools to succeed in their schools and as solid citizens in their communities. =Hockey programs= On-Ice Programming takes place three nights per week and Saturdays at Lasker Rink in Northern Central Park. Students normally spend a minimum of one and a half hours on ice each week. The hockey program is broken out into an introductory hockey program for beginners and advanced sessions by age groups as approved by USA Hockey. The Learn to Skate/Learn to Play program is for children between the ages of 4-12 who are just getting started. They are provided with hockey equipment and ice skates and begin the process of getting comfortable on the ice and learning the rules of the game. This is where they begin to build confidence and an appreciation for the game and their coaches. Age specific on ice activities are for students from 4–18 years old include skills development sessions and game setting scrimmages. Eventually students take part in intramural scrimmages to begin gaining in-game experience and then home and travel exhibition games against teams from the local New York City and Westchester community, New Jersey and Connecticut. =Educational programs= These programs focus on academic achievement and character development for students between the age of 9-13. Through educational programming, participants are given the opportunity to develop their academic skills, and by doing so, demonstrate Ice Hockey in Harlem’s motto: “Education is our Goal.” Students are required to attend weekly classroom sessions as a condition for participation in the hockey program. The IHIH after school curriculum teaches geography, history, and social studies, and skills in math, reading, and writing, using hockey as the central reference for study. This includes hockey literature, cities, statistics, players, rules of play, etc. IHIH has made literacy a focus of its educational programming. Four years ago, 'Book Club' was created for participants ages 9-16 to enhance their reading skills and promote a love of reading. This year, students read “The Game of their Lives” by Peter Gwozski about the 1980-81 Edmonton Oilers. Benefit On The Green For over 20 years, Ice Hockey in Harlem has hosted their annual Benefit on the Green Golf Tournament. This annual BOTG golf, and now, tennis outing brings together past and present NHL stars along with top corporate and private sponsors for a day that includes 18 rounds of golf, a tennis tournament, a cocktail reception, awards dinner, and live sports auction. Over the years, they’ve had such NHL players as Mark Messier, Mike Richter, Brad Richards, Brian Leetch, Willie O’Ree, Rod Gilbert, Martin St. Louis, Stephane Matteau, Jeff Beukeboom, and Manny Malhotra, among others. Through the BOTG, Ice Hockey in Harlem has raised much needed funding for programs to help ensure every student has a meaningful experience on and off the ice. Celebrating its 25th Anniversary, Ice Hockey in Harlem will be hosting this year’s BOTG at the Quaker Ridge Golf Club in Scarsdale, NY. =Winter Sports Celebration= Each year, Ice Hockey in Harlem and the New York Rangers team up to co-host the Winter Sports Auction. IHIH’s Winter Sports Auction brings together kids from the program, friends, and members of the New York Rangers and Rangers alumni for an evening of fun and auction shopping in support of the kids. The event normally consists of a live sport memorabilia auction, silent auction, and raffle while allowing fans to mingle and collect autographs from current and former New York Rangers.

workers activist. Almodovar worked as a traffic officer for ten years. In 1982, she quit her job with the Los Angeles Police Department and began working as a call girl. In 1984, she attempted to recruit a former coworker to begin working as a prostitute. Her actions resulted in her arrest and conviction for pandering. In 1986, Almodovar ran for lieutenant governor in the California gubernatorial election, as a Libertarian. Almodovar's autobiography was published by Simon & Schuster in 1993. She is the founder of the International Sex Worker Foundation for Art, Culture and Education (ISWFACE). , Almodovar also serves as the executive director of the Los Angeles branch of the sex workers' rights organization COYOTE. Personal background Norma Jean Almodovar (née Wright) was born on May 27, 1951 in Binghamton, New York. She is the daughter of Harold M. and Helen Ruth (née) Doolittle Wright. Her father served in World War II with the US Army and, upon his return, began working in a local factory. Her mother taught school, but retired early as her family continued to grow. Almodovar is the oldest daughter, with eight brothers and five sisters. During Almodovar's childhood, her mother began attending the Baptist church, following her conversion to Christianity. From that point, Almodovar's social and spiritual life centered around the church. Fully embracing Christianity along with her mother, Almodovar felt drawn to spend her life in direct service to God. She began preparing to serve as a missionary to Puerto Rico, believing that God had a higher purpose for her life. In 1969, following her graduation from Binghamton Central High School, Almodovar enrolled in the Philadelphia College of the Bible. After enrolling, she began looking for work to cover tuition and living expenses, but eventually relocated to New York City with a classmate. Soon after arriving in Manhattan, Almodovar began clerking at the Empire State Building. =Crisis of faith= In January 1970, Almodovar went to California to visit relatives. After spending a week with her aunt, she spent time with some friends from New York, who had recently relocated to Los Angeles. After their arrival, her friends became involved with a religious sect that presented extreme unorthodox teachings and displayed cultic tendencies. After Almodovar arrived in California, her friends began proselytizing, working to convert her to their fundamentalist beliefs. Prior to visit to California, Almodovar had experienced a crisis of faith and began reconsidering her long-held spiritual beliefs, encompassing the teachings of the Baptist church and her personal conviction about the existence of God. When her group of friends expressed their beliefs, she willingly accepted their invitation and joined their church. After she became a member, she began volunteering and serving the church and leadership in various capacities. In summer 1970, she met a relative of one of the members in the church, who had recently completed his tour of duty with the US Air Force. After a short courtship, she married Radames Almodovar on November 19, 1970. The marriage lasted for three years, during which time, Almodovar continued to evaluate her religious beliefs and eventually chose to distance herself from the Christian beliefs of her childhood and those of her recent conversion to the church that had been embraced by her friends. At the time of her divorce to Almodovar, she no longer embraced Christianity. Professional background =Los Angeles Police Department= In 1972, Almodovar joined the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) as a civilian traffic officer. For the majority of her career, she was assigned to the Rampart and Hollywood Divisions, working the night shift. Her responsibilities included issuing parking tickets, recovering stolen property, and directing traffic and spectators at scene of automobile collisions, as well as the site of local fires or crime scenes. During her employment, Almodovar witnessed felony corruption and criminal activity carried out by other members of the police force. She additionally experienced three injuries while on the job. ;On the job injuries In 1974, Almodovar was injured, when her three-wheeled, LAPD-issued Harley-Davidson motorcycle rear- ended the vehicle in front of her. The driver of the other car initially intended to run a red light, but upon noticing the police vehicle behind him, stopped suddenly and put his car in reverse, hitting Almodovar's motorcycle. As a result of her injuries from the collision, Almodovar was on disability for over 18 months. Almodovar's second injury came as a result of an attack by a local, well-known businessman and member of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. He reportedly attempted to run over Almodovar with his vehicle. While he was initially arrested for aggravated assault, the City of Los Angeles chose not to prosecute him. Due to local statutes as a city employee, Almodovar was not allowed to file a lawsuit to recover damages for the physical and emotional injuries she received. On April 18, 1982, Almodovar was injured for the third time. The department vehicle that she was driving was rear-ended by a man who was heavily intoxicated. After the collision, the driver fled the scene of the accident, but was quickly apprehended after a brief pursuit by undercover police officers that were nearby. Following his apprehension, the initial investigation revealed that the driver was an unauthorized Mexican national, who had stolen the vehicle and had just committed an armed robbery. While the individual was released from police custody shortly after being processed into the Hollywood jail, Almodovar was at the hospital undergoing medical tests to determine the extent of her injuries. Radiology reports indicated that she had an injured back and neck. Following the incident of April 18, 1982, Almodovar became disillusioned with the Los Angeles Police Department and her former colleagues. She felt personally offended by individuals on the police force who had knowingly engaged in illegal and corrupt activities. These activities in which officers allegedly participated, encompassed organized crime rings that were responsible for burglaries,West, Richard (July 30, 1982). \\"5 More Charged in LAPD Scandal\\". Los Angeles Times, page OC A8Farr, Bill (April 6, 1982). \\"Judge Issues Gag Order in Case of Police Officers Charged in Burglary\\". Los Angeles Times, page C1 drug trafficking, contract killing, and sexual exploitation of minors.Friedman, Arnie (October 3, 1976). \\"2 quit, 2 suspended, 7 face charges in cop sex scandal\\". Los Angeles Times. The response of the police department following Almodovar's last injury served as the straw that broke the camel's back in the anger and disillusionment that she felt about the LAPD. She became frustrated at the lack of support from her colleagues, who consistently refused or neglected to prosecute individuals responsible for the injuries she had incurred. She was no longer confident that the City of Los Angeles or her coworkers were able or interested in protecting her from harm. After finishing the required paperwork and accident report, Almodovar went home and never returned to work for the Los Angeles Police Department again. =Prostitution= When her disability benefits ended, Almodovar began working as a call girl in Beverly Hills. When asked by others why she chose to work in the sex industry, she often replies that she > wanted to make a social statement about the moral hypocrisy of our society, > a society which seemed completely untroubled by the police corruption that > permeated the LAPD, and yet demanded that law enforcement spend a > significant portion of its scarce and valuable resources to set-up and > arrest women whose sole crime was to accept money from men for acts of sex > in which they could otherwise legally engage, even with thousands of men, > provided the sex was free. Almodovar was opposed to arresting women for prostitution, done in an effort to protect them from exploitation, while the arrest itself would establish a police record and label them as a prostitute, potentially limiting opportunities throughout the rest of their lives. In comparing her work as a call girl with her work for the LAPD, she has said, \\"I would rather be a whore (an outcast from society) than to work for the Los Angeles Police Department. It is much more honest and I can live with myself.\\" =Cop to Call Girl= While Almodovar was working on the night shift for the LAPD, she often spent several hours waiting for a tow truck to arrive and pick up stolen and illegally parked cars. During this down time, she began working on a manuscript that documented her life and career. After leaving the police force, she continued working on the book, adding her experiences as a prostitute. The book was titled, Cop to Call Girl. Legal proceedings =Arrest and probation= On September 17, 1983, Almodovar was arrested at her home for one count of pandering, then taken to the police station where she had previously worked. During the investigation, the police confiscated her unfinished manuscript, claiming that it was \\"evidence\\" of her crime. The case against her centered around the testimony of a former coworker, that Almodovar attempted to recruit as a prostitute. In her defense, Almodovar stated that she was merely helping to fulfill the sexual fantasy of the coworker and former friend, by setting her up with a wealthy businessman, who was willing to pay her for sex. During the subsequent trial, presided by Judge Aurelio Muñoz, the coworker testified that she had arrived at Almodovar's house with a hidden tape recorder to document their conversation. Almodovar stated that her coworker had approached her as part of a setup by police officials, who wanted to stop her from completing her manuscript, which detailed her sexual escapades, along with department corruption. This was corroborated by the coworker on the witness stand, when she admitted that she had been working with other members of the LAPD to set up Almodovar, in an effort to keep her from publishing her book, which was believed to be an exposé of the inner workings and corruption of the Los Angeles Police Department. Almodovar's defense attorney, Lawrence Teeter, offered little credible evidence to refute the prosecution's case. As a result, Almodovar was convicted of one count of felony pandering, which called for a mandatory three- to six-year prison sentence. Following her conviction, the judge ordered a 90-day psychiatric evaluation to determine whether or not Almodovar posed a threat to society. She was remanded to custody on November 21, 1984, the day before Thanksgiving. Following the completion of Almodovar's psychiatric evaluation on January 9, 1985, Muñoz chose to disregard the mandatory sentencing guidelines, claiming them to be cruel and unusual punishment that was out of proportion for the actions for which Almodovar was convicted. Muñoz imposed a sentence of three years' probation. In December 1985, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office filed an appeal with the California State Court of Appeals, which overturned the sentence imposed by Muñoz and sent Almodovar to the California Institution for Women to serve the mandatory three years required by the sentencing guidelines.

Type-Moon published five volumes from December 2012 to December 2014. A manga adaptation illustrated by Akira Ishida is serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Comp Ace magazine. An anime television series adaptation by A-1 Pictures premiered in July 2017. Plot Fate/Apocrypha takes place in an alternate timeline from Fate/stay night. In the Third Holy Grail War, Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia steals the Greater Grail, smuggling it to Romania. Sixty years later, the Yggdmillennia clan declare war upon the Mage’s Association in the Greater Grail War, pitting two teams of Servants against one another. Yggdmillennia and the Mage’s Association’s teams are referred to as the Black and Red factions respectively. Kairi Shishigou, a necromancer hired by the Clock Tower, summons the Saber-class Mordred. The Red faction is led by priest Shirou Kotomine, though Shishigou remains independent, distrusting him. Shirou and his Servant, Semiramis, subdue the other masters of Red, stealing their command seals to control their Servants: Karna, Atalanta, Achilles, William Shakespeare, and Spartacus. The Black faction’s Servants include Vlad III, Siegfried, Chiron, Astolfo, Avicebron, and Frankenstein's monster. Their rebellious seventh member, Jack the Ripper, murders her intended master in favour of prostitute Rika Rikudou. Jeanne d’Arc is summoned as the mediating Ruler-class in the war, inhabiting the body of Laeticia, a French student. Receiving visions of Shirou, Jeanne tries to reach the Red faction, but they travel in Semiramis’ Hanging Gardens of Babylon towards Yggdmillennia’s domain in Trifas. Spartacus is captured by Yggdmillennia after trying to storm their domain. Yggdmillennia use homunculi to fuel the mana sustaining the Servants’ presence. Astolfo helps a male homunculus escape. When the homunculus is mortally wounded in the escape attempt, Siegfried sacrifices himself by giving his enchanted heart to the boy. Jeanne takes the homunculus, Sieg, into her custody, leaving him in the care of a hermit. Sieg decides he wishes to liberate the homunculi, returning to Trifas during battle. As the Black and Red factions clash, the Greater Grail is transported into the Hanging Gardens. Frankenstein’s monster and Spartacus die fighting Mordred. Sieg defends Astolfo from Mordred, discovering he can temporarily transform into Siegfried. Mordred decapitates Astolfo’s master Celenike Icecolle Yggdmillennia, Sieg becomes Astolfo’s new master. Whilst storming the Hanging Gardens, Darnic fuses with Vlad, becoming a vampire, but is slain by Shirou. Jeanne and the gathered Servants discover Shirou is in fact Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, a Ruler- class Servant summoned by the Einzberns in the Third Holy Grail War. Shirou wishes to use the Grail’s power to bring about eternal happiness for mankind, materialising their souls in a new world. Aside from Mordred, the Red faction and Avicebron agree to help him. Avicebron distracts Yggdmillennia whilst the Red faction escape, using his master Roche Frain Yggdmillennia to power his Noble Phantasm, but is killed by Sieg and Mordred. The Black faction form an alliance with Shishigou, Mordred, Sieg, and Jeanne to stop Shirou. They eliminate Rika and Jack the Ripper, Jeanne purifying the latter’s soul. Jeanne falls in love with Sieg, assuming they are Laeticia’s feelings, and has visions of Sieg dying in battle. Fiore Forvedge Yggdmillennia, the de facto leader of the Black faction, surrenders her magic and title to her brother Caules, unwilling to take a life as necessary. The Black faction attack the Hanging Gardens using a fleet of airplanes. Upon Karna’s request, Caules transports the captured Red faction’s masters to safety. During the assault, Chiron, Karna, Atalanta, Achilles, Shishigou, and Mordred die. Jeanne confronts Shakespeare, who taunts her with the visions of Sieg’s death. He then introduces Gilles de Rais, summoned as a Saber, to convince Jeanne of Shirou’s wish. Shirou’s wish is granted by the Greater Grail, activating on his command. Upon Sieg’s arrival, Jeanne convinces Gilles to redeem himself for past sins by siding with them. Jeanne and Gilles sacrifice themselves to stop Shirou, though Laeticia is spared. Empowered by the combined power of Siegfried and Frankenstein’s Monster, Sieg is able to defeat Shirou, who is given a painless demise by Semiramis via a poisoned kiss. The remaining Red servants vanish soon after. Sieg and Astolfo, being the winners of the war, speak to the Grail’s avatar Justeaze Lizrich von Einzbern, who explains Shirou’s wish will occur, but it will prevent humanity from evolving. Sieg requests that he be transformed into Fafnir, transporting the Grail to the Reverse Side of the World, where its magic will be neutralised. In the war’s aftermath, Astolfo sets off to explore the world. Jeanne’s spirit reunites with Sieg, confessing her love to him.

The museum displays include a glassworks from the time of Georgius Agricola, as well as a workshop (Werkstattstube) and other writing implements and tools of Ore Mountain glassmakers as well as the history of Neuhausen and Purschenstein Castle. In addition there are demonstrations of glass blowing.  Museum  Historic glasses from the Ore Mountains The glassworks museum in Neuhausen preserves evidence of the work of glassmakers in the Ore Mountains, an industry that goes back to the original settlement of the area around 1200 and includes work from both the Saxon and Bohemian regions of the Ore Mountains. The significance of these glassworks had an impact far beyond the Ore Mountain region. This is also true of the old Neuhausen glassworks of Heidelbach, founded in 1488, which worked until about 1827 and is represented in the exhibition. In the Heidelbach glassworks, in addition to simple everyday glasses and plate glass and high-quality glass work was also carried out. For example, the glass factory belonged to the purveyors of glas to the Saxon electors and other noble houses. \\"The Four Evangelists\\", four round panes of glasse painted with enamel, made for Purschenstein's castle chapel and dating to the year 1612, may be seen in the exhibition. The Glassworks Museum portrays an almost extinct, traditional craft. The exhibition shows the diversity of the glass as a material and the possibilities in terms of colour, shape and finish. On display are historic everyday glasses as well as special glass pieces, such as the round glass panes of 1612 and an Ore Mountain chandelier (Leuchterspinnen), over a hundred years old.  History  One of the exhibition rooms An excavated glass figure, believed to have been lost, at Purschenstein Castle In the early 1990s the socage vault, built in 1750, of Purschenstein Castle was placed under protection. Through grants the house, which is owned by the parish, was refurbished and, with the help of the local branch of the Ore Mountain Club, turned into a museum. In May 1996 the Ore Mountain Glassworks Museum (Erzgebirgische Glashüttenmuseum) opened its first exhibition. It contained pieces from the roughly 800-year-old glassmaking industry in the Ore Mountains. The exhibition focusses particularly on the history of the Heidelbach Glassworks from 1488 to 1827. Since opening, the museum has also been enhanced by the replica of a glass melting furnace in an adjoining building, which should enable the production of clear glass jars to be demonstrated to the public. In May 2006, the museum celebrated its anniversary with a festive weekend. Since then, there have been glass blowing demonstrations on public holidays. Here replicas, such as fly traps, Goethe barometers or Nuppen glasses are made. Nuppen are typical glass ornaments that imitate shimmering, coloured gemstones but also serve to improve grip. Such glasses were used in the late Middle Ages amongst the upper classes. Stained glass painting and glass engraving can be seen on demonstration days at the museum. The museum is the only one of its kind in the Ore Mountains and is sponsored by a support association in the Ore Mountain Club branch at Neuhausen. On 12 and 13 August 2002, when a hundred year flood occurred, the museum, which lies on a hill, was damaged by the overflowing waters of the adjacent castle pond, but was able to be restored thanks to a fundraising campaign and has since been reopened. In 2010/11, with state funding, the dilapidated wooden shingle roof of the museum completely replaced. The construction work had had to be repeatedly postponed for several years because of uncertainty over the funding.  Glassmaking  A glass blower holding a demonstration at the Glassworks Museum at Pentecost in 2009 The art of glassmaking and glass refining developed in the Ore Mountains was once a booming industry. In the Middle Ages, there were more than 50 forest glassworks in the Saxon and Bohemian Ore Mountains. This led to a wealth of regional types of glass and glass colours. Using minerals that were already present in the raw materials, only a green-tinted glass could be produced. Decolourizing material used to be referred to as \\"glassmakers soap\\" and neutralized unwanted shades of colour. Additives of the mineral manganese dioxide or arsenic, allowed the glass to appear colourless. By using other additives, glass could be coloured, especially in cobalt-blue, purple, red, green or white. The end of the Heidelbach Glassworks around 1827 was mainly due to its outdated smelting technology and strong competition from the Bohemian glass industry at that time. Mining, smelting and even wood carving in the \\"Seiffen Toy Triangle\\" increased the shortage of wood for fuel and took the livelihoods of glassmakers away, because they needed timber in large quantities. The industrialization of glass production began in the Ore Mountains in 1880. Major glass factories were established in the early industrial age in Carlsfeld, Zwickau and Brand-Erbisdorf. With the closure of glass furnaces in Carlsfeld in 1979 the history of glassworks in the Saxon Ore Mountains came to an end.

At its height the organization had klaverns in each of Georgia's 159 counties, as well as klaverns in Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina and Florida. It also had connections with klaverns and kleagles in Ohio and Indiana. After Green's death, however, the organization foundered as it split into different factions, was hit with a tax lien and was beset by adverse publicity. It was moribund by the time of the Supreme Court's \\"Black Monday\\" ruling in 1954.Michael and Judy Ann Newton eds. The Ku Klux Klan; an encyclopedia Garland Reference Library of the Social Science Vol.499 London and New York; Garland Publishing inc. 1991 pp.xi, 27-8, 238 A second Association of Georgia Klans was formed when Charles Maddox led dissatisfied members out of the U.S. Klans in 1960. This group appears to have folded into James Venable's National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan by 1965.Newton and Newton pp.374–375 There is also a current Klan group by that name.  History  = Prelude = Two children wearing Ku Klux Klan robes and hoods stand on either side of Dr. Samuel Green, Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon, at an initiation ceremony in Atlanta. July 24, 1948. The Association was formed at the same klonvokation that dissolved the Second Era Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The new group was to be an \\"informal, unincorporated\\" alliance of klaverns which would remain active in the state of Georgia. Green was elected to the post of Grand Dragon, the usual designation of a state leader of the KKK. Initially there were only twelve klaverns in the Association. In October 1945 the group conducted the first cross burning since the end of World War II atop Stone Mountain. At the time Green told the press that cross burning had been suspended during wartime because \\"all factions had to unite to win the war\\". At the time of the cross burning the Association claimed 20,000 members. On March 21 the Klans attorney, Morgan Telser, filed a corporate registration with the Georgia Secretary of State for the \\"Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc\\" and paid up the dues for the period 1943–6. On May 9, 1946 Green held the first large scale initiation ceremony on Stone Mountain. Approximately 1,000 on-lookers watched as 227 aliens were naturalized by 1,000 robed Klansmen under the light of five burning crosses. Green triumphantly announced \\"We are revived.\\" The initiates included a bus load of visitors from Tennessee. The presence of women among the assembled Klan members was also noted. Some altercations broke out with journalists, as the AGK had granted Look exclusive rights to take pictures.Rice, Arnold S The Ku Klux Klan in American politics Washington, Public Affairs Press 1962 pp.108–9 = Legal problems = These demonstrations were met with hostility from labor and political groups. On May 30 the Internal Revenue Service filed suit against the Association on the basis that they were a continuation of the former \\"Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc.\\" and thus owed the government the $685,305 in back taxes owed by the former organization. Green countered that his association was not organically linked to the Knights, though there was a five-man board of directors who were tasked with \\"keeping the charter alive\\" and could \\"reactivate\\" the national klan at the appropriate time. Pending that, he led a group of klaverns informally \\"associated\\" with each other to perpetuate the beliefs and activities of the parent organization. The Klan also faced opposition from Gov. Ellis Arnall. The governor instructed Attorney General Eugene Cook to institute quo warranto proceedings against the group to revoke its charter. Among the reasons for the revocation of the charter, the governors order listed: that the Klan operated as a for-profit group, despite its non-profit charter, and as such owed federal back taxes; that it was political, despite being described as non- political in its charter; the Klan engaged in violent and unlawful activities; and despite its \\"fraternal\\" appellation, it existed to foster hate, prejudice and intolerance. As for the Association of Georgia Klans being different from the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Dan Duke, an assistant attorney general heading the investigation, stated that the Association was the \\"ragtag and bobtail of the old order and their claiming to be different will not interfere with the legal procedure contemplated in any way\\". The quo warranto petition was presented to Judge Frank A. Hooper of Fulton County Superior Court on June 20. The petition alleged that the Association was, in effect, a for-profit organization that existed to enrich its officers. The petition further stated that the Association used the same Kloran, titles, passwords, grips and signs of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc. and the seven klaverns in the Atlanta area were charted by the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc. While the process to revoke the charter was going on the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that they had found evidence of specific violent acts, either claimed or contemplated by AGK members. A GBI infiltrater (Stetson Kennedy) announced that he had overheard members of the Klavalier Klub, a Klan wrecking crew, taking credit for the death of a black taxi driver the previous August and the flogging of another African American. The authorities linked this to the death of taxi driver Porter Flornoy Turner in August 1945, and the kidnapping and beating of black Navy veteran Hugh Johnson, who had been given 52 lashes on Feb. 13, 1946.Newton and Newton p.321Slaying linked to reborn klan after boasts. date=Jun 8, 1946Chicago Daily Tribune (1923–1963), pp. 13. There was also an alleged conspiracy to assassinate or \\"take care of\\" Gov. Arnell.Newton and Newton p.24 The legal manoeuvrings over the charter dragged on through the late summer and fall. Duke made trips to confer with New Jersey officials to clarify the Klans links with the German American Bund, and continuing links with fascists. In September, the Klan backed Eugene Talmage, who won the Democratic primary. Talmage promised to drop the suit once he became governor in January. The dateline for the suit to come to court was delayed throughout November and into December. It was finally scheduled for December 13. As the state courts were to adjourn on December 15, it was thought that the suit would never go to trial, as Talmage would soon be inaugurated. On December 21 Eugene Talmage died. There was no clear successor to the governor-elect, and the state's executive was thrown into chaos among competing claims to the governorship. Talmadge was buried on the 23rd. The Klan sent a \\"huge\\" floral wreath with a white ribbon with four golden Ks emblazoned on it. After a drawn-out crisis to determine who the next governor would be, Melvin E. Thompson was inaugurated on March 20, 1947. He pledged to continue the suit against the Klan. In June 1947, the Klan finally decided to surrender its Georgia state charter after the state dropped the charges of murder, flogging, false arrest and breach of the peace. Attorney General Eugene Cook stated that it would be too difficult to prove the individual acts of violence were attributable to the organization. This prevented the AGK from suing to protect its name, or have any other sanction of law, but did not dissolve the Association. On Nov. 4, 1947 Cook announced that files on the Klan which named \\"prominent individuals\\" were stolen from his office. = Voter intimidation = In the 1948 election the AGK used intimidation tactics to discourage black voters. In Wrightsville 300 robed klansmen paraded in the street before the Democratic primary and burned a 15 ft cross on the county courthouse lawn. Grand Dragon Green condemned President Harry S. Truman's civil rights policies and told the crowd \\"whenever the Negro takes a place at the side of a white man through the force of federal bayonets, blood will flow in the streets\\". None of the 241 qualified black voters voted in the next day's Democratic primary. In Swainsboro, Mount Vernon and Jeffersonville cross burnings, threatening letters and the distribution of coffins marked \\"KKK\\" convinced black voters to stay at home.

Map of the lands of Bellême House of Bellême also referred to as the Family of Bellême was an important seigneurial family during the 10th through the 12th centuries. Members of this family held the important castles of Bellême, Alençon, Domfront and Sées as well as extensive lands in France, Normandy and Maine. Rapid rise to prominence The first known progenitor of this family is Yves de Bellême who was probably the son of Yves de Creil,Yves de Criel and Yves de Bellême are confused by several sources and thought to be the same person by some. Yves de Criel, who was instrumental in saving young Richard I of Normandy would not chronologically be possible to be the same as Yves de Bellême, the subject of this article, who died c. 1005. Geoffrey White believed Yves de Criel was probably the father of Yves de Bellême, which was also accepted by all the French writers, but was of the opinion it should not be stated as fact as it was by Prentout. See: Geoffrey H. White, The First House of Bellême, TRHS, Vol. 22 (1940), pp. 70-71.Geoffrey H.

Yet in a charter to the abbey of Lonlay of the lands of Neustria Pia, he describes himself as William princeps and provinciae principatum gerens indicating he considered himself an independent ruler or prince of his own domains.Kate Norgate, England Under the Angevin Kings, Vol. I (Macmillan and Co., New York, 1887), p. 114 & n. 1 His sons Fulk and Warin died in his lifetime leaving Robert as his heir.Geoffrey H.

He built several castles to ensure control of the vast lordship of Bellême and held in total forty castles, including those of Alençon and Bellême, defends the territory and form a barrier to any attempt to bid. In 1098 Robert's younger brother Hugh died, and Robert inherited, on payment of £3,000 in relief, the English properties that had been their father's, including the Rape of Arundel and the Earldom of Shrewsbury.C. Warren Hollister, Henry I (Yale University Press, New Haven & London, 2003), p. 155 Robert had also acquired the countship of Ponthieu jure uxoris and the honor of Tickhill; all of which combined made him the wealthiest magnate in both England and Normandy. Robert rebelled repeatedly against the King of England and Duke of Normandy. In 1112 Robert was sent as an envoy of the French king to Henry I at his court at Bonneville whereas Henry seized Robert and imprisoned him.Kathleen Thompson, 'Orderic Vitalis and Robert of Bellême', Journal of Medieval History, Vol. 20 (1994), p. 138 Robert spent the rest of his life as a prisoner; the exact date of his death is not known.J.

While William Talvas was as treacherous and self-serving as any of his family before him he surpassed them in wickedness and cruelty.Geoffrey H. White, 'The First House of Bellême', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Fourth Series, Vol. 22 (1940), p. 83 He had married a Hildeburg, daughter of a nobleman named Arnulf, but he had his wife strangled on her way to church, according to Orderic, because she loved God and would not support his wickedness. Then on the occasion of his second wedding, William Talvas invited one of his vassals William fitz Giroie to attend. Suspecting nothing, fitz Giroie, while a guest at the festivities, was suddenly seized by Talvas' men and imprisoned, then according to Orderic horribly mutilated and blinded before being released. Somehow William Giroie survived his torture and mutilation and retired to Bec Abbey to live out the remainder of his life as a monk.The Ecclesiastical History of Orderic Vitalis, Ed. Marjorie Chibnall, Volume II (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1993), P. 15 Of all of Orderic's female subjects William's daughter Mabel was the most cunning and treacherous; if not entirely for her own misdeeds then as the mother of Robert de Bellême, who had a reputation for savagery as well as cruelty.Violence Against Women in Medieval Texts, Ed. Anna Roberts (University Press of Florida, 1998), p. 49 In one passage Orderic describes her as \\"small, very talkative, ready enough to do evil, shrewd and jocular, extremely cruel and daring.Geoffrey H. White, The First House of Bellême, Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Fourth Series, Vol. 22 (1940), p. 86 Mabel was hostile to most members of the clergy; but her husband loved the monks at Saint-Evroul so she found it necessary to be more subtle.Geoffrey H. White, The First House of Bellême, Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Fourth Series, Vol. 22 (1940), p. 87 She deliberately burdened their limited resources by visiting the abbey for extended stays with a large retinue of her soldiers. When rebuked by Theodoric the abbot for her callousness she snapped back that the next time she would visit with an even larger group. The abbot predicted that if she did not repent of her evilness she would suffer great pains and that very evening she did. She left the abbey in great haste as well as in great pain and did not abuse their hospitality again. In continuing her family's feud with the Giroie family she set her sights on Arnold de Echauffour, she son of William fitz Giroie who her father had mutilated at his wedding celebration.David C. Douglas, William the Conqueror (University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1964), p. 414 She attempted to poison Arnold of Echauffour by placing it in a glass of wine but he declined to drink. Her husband's brother, Gilbert, refreshing himself after a long ride, drank the wine and died shortly thereafter. In the end though she bribed Arnold's chamberlain providing him with the necessary poison, this time being successful. In 1077 she took the hereditary lands of Hugh Bunel by force.Elisabeth Van Houts, The Normans in Europe (Manchester University Press, Manchester, UK, 2000), p. 276 & n. 300 Two years later while resting after a bath, she was murdered in her bed by the same Hugh BunelPauline Stafford, 'Women and the Norman Conquest', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Sixth Series, Vol. 4, (1994), p. 227 But, Orderic Vitalis may have been most strongly biased against Robert de Bellême and his treatment of that magnate belies a moral interpretation of his actions.Kathleen Thompson, 'Orderic Vitalis and Robert of Bellême', Journal of Medieval History, Vol. 20 (1994), p. 133 The basis for Orderic's animosity towards Robert and his de Bellême predecessors was the longstanding and bitter feud between the Giroie family, patrons of Orderic's Abbey of Saint-Evroul, and the de Bellême family.Kathleen Thompson, 'Orderic Vitalis and Robert of Bellême', Journal of Medieval History, Vol. 20 (1994), p. 134 William Talvas (de Bellême), Robert's grandfather, had blinded and mutilated William fitz Giroie.For more on the feud between the Bellêmes and the Giroies see the article William I Talvas Robert did at times appropriate church properties and was not a major donor to any ecclesiastical house. But Robert's attitudes toward the church are typical of many of his contemporaries; certainly no worse than the secular rulers and other magnates of his day.Kathleen Thompson, 'Robert of Bellême Reconsidered', Anglo-Norman Studies XIII; Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1990, Ed. Marjorie Chibnall (The Boydell Press, Woodbridge, 1991), p. 280 The assessment of William II Rufus by R.W.

Networks of such queues are known to have a product form stationary distribution under certain conditions. Under heavy traffic conditions a bulk queue is known to behave like a reflected Brownian motion. Kendall's notation In Kendall's notation for single queueing nodes, the random variable denoting bulk arrivals or service is denoted with a superscript, for example MX/MY/1 denotes an M/M/1 queue where the arrivals are in batches determined by the random variable X and the services in bulk determined by the random variable Y. In a similar way, the GI/G/1 queue is extended to GIX/GY/1.

A mixed commercial and residential area on the west bank of the Arkansas River, it is home to Friends University, Riverfront Stadium, and Exploration Place, the Sedgwick County science museum. History Thanks to the availability of inexpensive land under the Homestead Act of 1862, settlers purchased land across the Arkansas River from Wichita, Kansas. These settlers named their new community Elgin. In 1870, Elgin became a cattle shipment point on the Chisholm Trail and began to grow. In March 1871, local residents renamed the town Delano after Columbus Delano, Secretary of the Interior under President Ulysses S. Grant. Hotels, saloons, and other new businesses opened over the next two years along with a post office and a toll bridge across the river to Wichita. Unlike Wichita, Delano had no law enforcement. As a result, it became an area center of drinking, gambling, and prostitution for cowboys working in the cattle trade. Gunfights occurred as well, including a fatal and locally famous incident between two saloon keepers in 1873. In the late 1870s, the cattle trade relocated west to Dodge City, and Delano’s period as a rowdy cowtown ended. Wichita annexed Delano in 1880, and it became locally known as West Wichita.Edwards Map of the City of Wichita; John P. Edwards; 1882. An economic boom a few years later triggered residential development. Streets in the neighborhood were named after prominent settlers. New businesses opened as well, including a watch factory. Garfield University, later repurposed as Friends University, opened in Delano in 1887. By the end of the decade, however, the city had entered an economic recession, and many locals went bankrupt. Development returned in the early 1900s with renewed growth in manufacturing and the oil industry. In the 1920s, Wichita became a center of aircraft manufacturing, and several companies opened facilities in Delano. These included Travel Air in 1925 and Cessna in 1927 as well as smaller companies such as the Wichita Blue Streak Motor Company, Hilton Aircraft, and Yunker Aircraft Company. By the 1930s, the majority of Delano consisted of modest residential property built during the preceding three decades. In the early 1930s, the Ackerman Island sandbar located in the middle of the Arkansas River was moved westward to become the west bank of the current river. The former baseball stadium on Ackerman Island was razed, so a new baseball field was built, Lawrence Athletic Field, later Lawrence–Dumont Stadium, which opened in Delano in 1934. That same year, the city government had the Ben F. McLean Memorial Fountain built in the neighborhood to commemorate McLean, a former mayor. In the 1950s and 60s, businesses and retailers began to leave the neighborhood since the aircraft industry relocated elsewhere in the city. By the 1990s, the area had entered a period of modest decline. In 1999 and 2000, neighborhood organizations and the city government collaborated to develop and implement a revitalization plan, including infrastructure investment and new business development. Since, Delano’s business district has become a booming local shopping and entertainment area marketed as the Historic Delano District. In November 2018, the city government had Lawrence- Dumont Stadium demolished. Construction of its replacement, Riverfront Stadium, began soon thereafter and finished in August 2019. Geography Delano is located at (37.682778, -97.359722) at an elevation of 1,299 feet (396 m).

He was the ancestor of the Holywood family of Artane Castle, and of the St. Lawrence family, Earls of Howth. Career  He took his surname from the parish of Holywood (also spelt Hollywood), near Balbriggan, County Dublin.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p.84 He was a Remembrancer of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in 1356 and in 1359 he was charged with organising the defence of Leinster. He was appointed Chief Baron in 1363: he was superseded the following year, but reappointed in 1367. In 1376 he finally stepped down as Chief Baron. He died eight years later.Ball p.84 In 1361 he received a royal pardon for purchasing land without royal permission, something strictly forbidden for Crown officials. This pardon may relate to his purchase of Artane Castle, of which he was the first recorded owner and which remained in his family for several centuries (unlike most judges of the time he was not in holy orders).Adams, C.L. Castles of Ireland London 1904 p.18 In 1367 he sat on a powerful commission to determine whether or not the manor of Rathkeale was Crown land, but it apparently never reported, since an identical inquiry was launched in 1374. Ball notes that while many of his fellow judges willingly exposed themselves to the dangers of going on assize, Holywood preferred the security of Dublin.Ball p.34 In 1373, in consideration of his good services to the Crown, he was given permission to found a chantry with five chaplains at Holywood and in 1376 was given permission to allow them to choose a warden. The chaplains were required to pray for the souls of Sir Robert himself, his two wives, and Queen Philippa of Hainault, the lately deceased wife of King Edward III.Patent Rolls of Edward III vol.xv. p.338 Family  His first wife was named Joan; his second wife, who was still alive in 1376, was called Nesta. At his death in 1384, his son Sir Christopher de Holywood succeeded to the estate. Christopher became a distinguished soldier, and in 1413 was appointed one of the commanders of the King's army in Ireland.Otway-Ruthven, A.J.

Vaněk first appeared in the play Audience by Václav Havel. He subsequently appeared in three other plays by Havel (Protest, Unveiling, and Dozens of Cousins), as well as plays by his friends and colleagues, including Pavel Landovský and Tom Stoppard. Today, the Vaněk plays are among Havel's best-known works. Origins Ferdinand Vaněk first appeared in the play Audience in 1975 as a stand-in for Havel. Vaněk, like Havel, was a dissident playwright, forced to work in a brewery because his writing has been banned by the Czechoslovak Communist regime. In the course of the play, it becomes clear that the brewmaster has been asked to spy on him. A long, rambling, comic dialogue proceeds, in the course of which the brewmaster eventually becomes a sympathetic figure, rather than a villain. Since Havel's work was banned, the play was not performed in any theater. Instead, it was performed in living rooms and distributed as samizdat. However, the work became quite well known in the Czech Republic, in part because of a widely circulated radio production of Audience. The Vaněk Plays  Introduction Subsequent to 'Audience', Havel used Vaněk in the plays Unveiling, a comic one-act about a couple who desperately want Vaněk to absolve them for their collaborative relationship with the Communist regime, and Protest, in which Vaněk tries to convince an old colleague to sign a protest letter. Further Vaněk plays Havel's Czech friends Pavel Landovský, Pavel Kohout, and Jiří Dienstbier all wrote subsequent plays starring Vaněk, and the character became a national symbol.Goetz-Stankiewicz, Markéta. The Vaněk Plays, University of British Columbia Press, 1987. Subsequent plays by other authors have also featured Vaněk, such as Tom Stoppard's play Rock 'n' Roll, which addressed the importance of music in Czechoslovakia, and Edward Einhorn's The Velvet Oratorio, which imagined Vaněk during the Velvet Revolution. Havel himself wrote a short modern sequel to Unveiling entitled Dozens of Cousins in 2010.

It is a not-for-profit, socio-political body that represents all the tribes of the Kukis. Kuki government The key of the Kuki government is the Chiefship, which became known to the British colonial rule in India. The King of Tripura is the National Chief, and all the Kuki Clan Chiefs (Phung Upas) and Village Chiefs (Kho Haosas) are linked up with and subordinate to him. The King is named “Kumpi,” equivalent to English word “emperor”.T. Lunkim, \\"Traditional System of Kuki Administration\\", in Thongkholal Haokip (ed.). The Kukis of Northeast India: Politics and Culture. New Delhi: Bookwell, 2012, Chapter 1. Structure of Kuki Inpi The following is the basic structure of the Kuki Inpi. Basically, Kuki Inpi is of two houses, namely (1) Upa Inpi and (2) Haosa Inpi. It is comparable to the present United Kingdom government which has two houses, (1) the House of Lords and (2) the House of Commons. The Upa Inpi is to be understood in a simple way as heredity based linked up with the national level government. The Haosa Inpi has the following tier of administration. Kho administration A village administration is headed by Kho Haosa as the Chief, in whose name land and other properties, both movable and immovable, are registered and the Chief owns the land for the whole village. Village Chief (i) guides and advises the village administration in accordance with customs and traditions. Kho Semang of the village is an elected cabinet member who administrate the entire village on behalf of the Chief. Kho Pachong of the village is another elected cabinet member, who is responsible for village defence and security, and village labour force. Kho Lhangsam is also an elected cabinet member, who is responsible for public relations, publicity, external affairs and communications. Lhang administration A number of villages in a compact geographical area will be grouped into Lhang which is similar to a district Administration. Lhang is administered by: (a) Lhang Haosa (Lhang Chief), (b) Lhang Semang, and (c) Lhang Pachong, whose responsibilities are that same as that of a village (Kho Haosa) Chief, Kho Semang and Kho Pachong. Gamkai administration Kuki Inpi will group certain number of Lhangs in a certain geographical areas, whose income will be able to meet the expenses of the administration and the Lhangs within that zone will come under the Gamkai (State), and that Gamkai will be administered in the same administrative pattern of the village and the Lhang. The Lhang leaders namely (a) Haosas, (b) Semangs, (c) Pachongs and (d) Lhangsams of the number of Lhangs, will democratically elect Gamkai (i) Haosa, (ii) Semang, (iii) Pachong and (iv) Lhangsam for a period of one term indirectly. Like in Kho and Lhang administration, Gamkai administration has (a) Gamkai Haosa, (b) Gamkai Semang, (c) Gamkai Pachong and (d) Gamkai Lhangsam, whose responsibilities are that same as that of a village (Kho Haosa) Chief, Kho Semang and Kho Pachong. Kuki Inpi Kuki Inpi (Kuki Government) is the national government with geographical boundaries with neighbouring countries. The policies of Kuki Inpi (Kuki government) are: > *Non-Communal; *Peaceful coexistence with all peace loving peoples/nations; > and *Justice in governance in the country irrespective of caste and creed. Kuki Inpi has been the government of the Kuki nation from time immemorial. The whole set up of Kuki Inpi administration is the same principle beginning from village going up to the national government. All matters will be framed by the Kuki Inpi and will be executed through the Gamkai, Lhang, and Kho in the whole country. Kuki Inpis Kumpipu is the overall head of all the Kuki Inpis.

The risks associated with working with and caring for the animals, include visitor employee safety. There are numerous safeguards in place to prevent injury, disease, and death. Employee safety Zookeeper or zoo workers are labeled dangerous job positions. Limited regulations regarding the safety of zoo workers exist. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is a federal agency responsible for setting and monitoring workplace health and safety regulations. OSHA does not designate a specific section of standards and regulations for zoo workers. Requirements for zoos fall under OSHA's general regulations for maintaining a safe and healthy work environment.\\"Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970\\", \\"Occupational Safety and Health Administration\\" January 1, 2004 The Association for Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) is a private nonprofit organization offering accreditation to institutions that apply and meet their very high standards. While the majority of standards focus on the health and safety of animals, standards pertaining to worker safety are included.\\"Guidelines for zoo and aquarium veterinary medical programs and veterinary hospitals\\", \\"American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,\\" 1998 The zoo itself and their governing authority are ultimately responsible for creating their own safety policies and procedures. The policies must fall within broad federal regulations. Zoos employ safety officers responsible for developing, implementing, and evaluating safety and training policies.\\"Occupational Health and Safety Programs: In Animal Care and Management at the National Zoo: Final Report (chapter 6)\\", \\"National Research Council,\\" 2005 Zoo keepers are in charge of cleaning, feeding, and care of animals. These activities present a level of risk. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential in these tasks. Examples of PPE used by zoo workers are masks, gloves, boots, goggles, and communication devices. Techniques and specialized equipment also contribute to zoo worker safety. Modified sliding doors and guillotine doors aid in feeding large or dangerous animals. Shifting, a technique commonly used for feeding and cleaning the enclosure, requires directing the animal to a securable section of their habitat.\\"Zoo Visitors Frequently Asked Questions: Do You Go into the Exhibit with the Leopards, Lions, Tigers, Bears?\\" , \\"Biodeath,\\" October 19, 2009 This technique protects the worker as well as prevents disruption of the cleaning process. When needing to transport or care for animals, basic capture and restraint equipment varies by animal. Equipment commonly used includes gloves, nets, blow darts, projectile guns/darts, and crates or cages. There are other health risks for respiratory- related illness and disease such as asthma and allergies. Also, for those who work with certain species, there is risk of toxicity due to venomous exposure. Much of the research on these topics is extrapolated from studies on laboratory workers, however there are a few specific studies for zoo employees. Most studies have been in the form of voluntarily questionnaires. Using tools including the skin prick test,a skin allergy test, zoo employees were identified to have allergies or not.Krakowiak, A, Palczyñski, C, Walusiak, J, Wittezak, T, Ruta, U, Dudek, W, & Szule, B,\\"Allergy to Animal Fur and Feathers among Zoo Workers\\" 2009 In these studies, the researchers took into account confounding variables such as pet presence at home. They also accounted for duration of work with animals. This study determined significant allergic reaction for employees who work with parrots.Swiderska-Kielbik, S, Krakowiak, A, Wiszniewska, Dudek, W, Kowalczyk, M, Walusiak-Skorupa, J, Sliwkiewicz, K, & Palcynski, C,\\"Work-Related Respiratory Symptoms in Bird Zoo Keepers – Questionnaire Data\\" 2009 Another potential hazard for zoo employees is for those who work with venomous animals.Vohra, R., Clark, R., & Shah, N, \\"A Pilot Study of Occupational Envenomations in North American Zoos and Aquaria\\" 2008 These animals have bites or stings that expose the victim to a toxin. Many of the reptiles in zoos are exotic and poison control centers may not keep the appropriate anti-venom in stock. If anti-venom is unavailable, emergency hospitalization or a fasciotomy may need to be performed. Other common injuries include needlestick injuries, radiation exposure from x-rays and animal related injuries such as bites and kicks. Also, there is a risk for chemical exposure due to anesthetic agents, formaldehyde, pesticides, and disinfectants.Hill, D, Langley, R,& Morrow, M,\\"Occupational Injuries and Illnesses Reported by Zoo Veterinarians in the United States\\" December 2008 Many of these hazards can be minimized using personal protective equipment. Education on proper animal care procedures is essential, including proper handling of chemical and sharps waste. Zoonotic diseases, otherwise known as zoonosis, are diseases that can be transferred from animals to humans and vice versa.National Centre for Zoonosis Research hosted by the University of Liverpool, \\"About zoonosis\\" 2012 They can be spread through the air, through common animal vectors (such as animals), or through direct contact. Within zoos, the most susceptible group for contracting a zoonotic disease is zoo workers such as veterinarians and zookeepers who have direct contact with the animals. The most commonly known zoonotic diseases are: * West Nile * Avian influenza * Salmonella * Escherichia coli Other, less known diseases that can be spread between humans and animals are: * Tuberculosis * Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) most often found as retroviruses in animals. The design and structure of each exhibit limits the exposure of zoonotic diseases to guests and workers by limiting exposure and direct contact to the animals. Using personal protective equipment properly, examining animals on a regular basis and reporting new illnesses and outbreaks to proper authorities (e.g. State Health Department), as well as providing extensive education and training on how to properly handle and care for animals are all important components of limiting zoonotic disease transmission.National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, INC, \\"Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report: Compendium of Measures to Prevent Disease Associated with Animals in Public Settings, 2011\\" \\"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\\" May 6, 2011 Guest safety Proper enclosure design is the best method to protect zoo patrons from animal exposures. In addition to ensuring animal welfare, exhibits are designed to immerse the viewer in a particular habitat while maintaining a barrier between guests and animals.Hutchins, M & Smith B,\\"Characteristics of a world class zoo or aquarium in the 21st century\\" \\"International Zoo Yearbook,\\" 2003 Enclosures must also reflect species- specific characteristics, such as ability to fly, jump, climb, swim or dig.Taronga Zoo Education Centre, \\"Enclosure Design Stage 4 - Design Technology\\" 2011 Dry moats are built by digging a deep trench around a section or the entirety of the exhibit that is wide enough to prevent an animal from jumping across. Signs and railings are used to prevent guests from climbing into the exhibit or falling into the moat. Wet moats are similar to dry moats with the exception that they are filled with water and often built to resemble naturally occurring bodies of water such as a river. However, unless the water is circulated and filtered, wet moats have the potential to become habits for mosquitoes and other disease spreading entities.Pan Z, Yan, Z & Tang, X, \\"Study of the breeding state of the natural mosquito population in guangzhou\\" \\"Chinese Journal of Vector Biology and Control,\\" 2003 Glass barriers prevent allergens and zoonotic diseases from passing between the guest and the animal because they restrict the flow of air and provide a physical barrier to objects crossing into or out of the exhibit. However, glass requires cleaning on both sides of the exhibit and might expose staff to diseases or physical hazards unless additional safety measures are taken. Fences are most often designed so that pressure placed upon them by the animal does not damage the integrity of the fence. The exact type of fencing used depends on the species being housed in the exhibit. “Apron fencing” or fencing that extends underground is used to enclose species that can dig. “Overhang fencing”, or fencing that curves towards the inside of the exhibit at the top is used to enclose species that can jump or climb. A new movement in enclosure design is to disguise safety fences with natural features such as ivy, or to paint them black so they appear invisible when viewed from a distance. Physical Hazards for Guests at the Zoo: Safety signage is primarily responsible for detouring unsafe behaviors such as standing on barriers and avoiding potential tripping hazards Additionally, the presence of zoo security staff, guest services and zookeepers may help limit potentially hazardous situations for guests. Federal regulation The Animal Welfare Act (AWA), which was signed into law August 24, 1966, is the only federal law which regulates the treatment of animals in research, exhibition transport and by dealers. The Act has been amended seven times since (1970, 1976, 1985, 1990, 2002, 2007, 2008) but the most recent amendments have focused on animal rights regarding matters such as farm animals and animal fighting. It not only regulates the well-being of animals but it also monitors how animals in zoos may be exhibited and treated. Although it provides protection for all animals who meet the criteria defined in the statute, its scope is limited in the number of animals covered. The AWA provides a minimum acceptable standard of care for the treatment of animals. It also gives authority to the Secretary of Agriculture to enforce the rules and regulations outlined within the law. As well, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) are charged with enforcing compliance issues for standards of care. The APHIS carries out yearly inspections of zoos and other facilities to monitor and report any issues which arise, while also investigating complaints received from individual facilities. Despite the presence of a national law governing the treatment of animals, it often falls upon the states to implement more inclusive zoo policies to provide ample care for the animals within their facilities. The AWA has a few limitations; for example, only warm-blooded animals are covered by the definition outlined in the statute. In addition, the APHIS is hindered by a lack of resources for investigating claims; they have only 104 inspectors to monitor over 2,000 facilities nationwide. Also, the AWA lacks a citizen suit provision, which would allow a concerned citizen to sue on behalf of a mistreated animal.Grech, K. \\"Overview of Laws Affecting Zoos\\"\\"Animal Legal & Historic Center,\\" 2004 Major accidents * (June 26, 2012 - Los Angeles Zoo, California) A baby chimpanzee was killed by an adult male chimp in front of visitors.\\"Deadly Chimp Attack Frightens Zoo Visitors\\" \\"CBS Local News,\\" 2012 * (June 21, 2012 - Lake Superior Zoo, Minnesota) Major rainfall caused a nearby creek to overflow, leading to the flooding of several exhibits, animal escapes and drowning and property damage.\\"Flooding causes animal deaths at Lake Superior Zoo\\" \\"Greenbay Press Gazette,\\" 2012 * (March, 2010 - Lincoln Park Zoo, Wisconsin) A woman ignored barriers and warning signs and tried to feed two bears.

The effect of the Act was to transfer responsibility for trying election petitions from the House of Commons to the Judges of the High Court of Justice. The Act was designed to, and did, provide a more effective measure for preventing corruption and fraud in Parliamentary elections. Background The 1865 general election was regarded by contemporaries as being a generally dull contest nationally, which exaggerated the degree of corruption within individual constituencies. In his PhD thesis, Cornelius O'Leary described The Times as having reported \\"the testimony is unanimous that in the General Election of 1865 there was more profuse and corrupt expenditure than was ever known before\\". As a result of allegations of corruption, 50 election petitions were lodged, of which 35 were pressed to a trial; 13 ended with the elected MP being unseated. In four cases a Royal Commission had to be appointed because of widespread corrupt practices in the constituency. When he came into office in 1867, Benjamin Disraeli announced that he would introduce a new method for election petition trials (which were then determined by a committee of the House of Commons). Disraeli proposed that this take the form of two assessors visiting the constituency and determining the outcome, with an appeal to the House of Commons which could appoint a select committee should it decide to take the matter up. This Bill was referred to a select committee which altered it so that the jurisdiction was given to the Court of Queen's Bench, with no appeal to the House, but with a three-member Court of Election Appeals for points of law. At this point the Bill was withdrawn, so that it could be reintroduced the following year. Legislation When the Bill was reintroduced in February 1868, Disraeli noted that the Lord Chief Justice Sir Alexander Cockburn, had written to the Lord Chancellor expressing the \\"strong and unanimous feeling of insuperable repugnance\\" to their proposed duties under the Bill. He had therefore changed the proposal again, to propose an election court which would have three members. The Liberal opposition did not attack the principle of the Bill, although two individual Liberal MPs fervently opposed it, with Alexander Mitchell arguing he was \\"convinced that the retention by the House of its own jurisdiction and the right of determining who were its Members was essential to its dignity and independence\\". There was a feeling in the press and in Parliament that a makeshift court was not of suitable esteem to take over what had been a matter of Parliamentary privilege. Disraeli therefore came up with a compromise, which William Gladstone accepted, whereby two Judges of the Court of Common Pleas, Exchequer of Pleas or Queen's Bench would be designated to try election petitions with full judicial salaries. The passage of the Bill was prolonged in the House of Commons because of opposition, but passed through the House of Lords in five days and the Bill received Royal Assent on 31 July 1868.

While serving on the IACHR, the Procuraduría General de la República opened an investigation against him for alleged misuse of funds given by the Mexican government to the IACHR to finance its activities relating to the Ayotzinapa mass disappearance; the investigation was ultimately abandoned. In 2016, he was replaced by Paulo Abrão of Brazil. =Ahora movement and presidential bid= On 27 February 2017, Álvarez announced he was launching a political movement in Mexico City, known as Ahora (Now), initially with the goal of putting citizen candidates on the ballot in 2018 and as a vehicle for an independent presidential bid. That October, citing the outcome of the State of Mexico election earlier that year, he withdrew his candidacy, worried that the election had been too similar to that of 1988 and declaring that he \\"would not be useful to the PRI\\", like other independent candidates who he claimed had their candidacies secretly supported by the presidency. =2018 Senate candidacy= In March 2018, Álvarez announced that Ahora would back the Por México al Frente coalition, including presidential candidate Ricardo Anaya Cortés, and that the movement would run legislative candidates in the coalition, with three candidates for Senate and five for the Chamber of Deputies. Álvarez joined the PAN-PRD-MC Senate ticket for Mexico City alongside Xóchitl Gálvez Ruiz. The ticket finished second in the election, giving Álvarez a seat as the first minority senator. On 23 August 2018, Álvarez announced he would serve as an independent senator and not join the caucuses of any of the parties that ran him for Senate, noting that he is not a member of any of them; additionally, the other Ahora candidates elected, Ana Lucía Riojas Martínez and Carlos Morales Vázquez, would enter the legislature as independents, though they ran on the PRD and PAN lists, respectively.

As closest confidant of the King Urdăreanu was, alongside Madame Lupescu, the King’s mistress, the third member of the triumvirate which held virtually all power in the state during the 1930s. It is alleged that he was, after the King, the most powerful and the most hated man in Romania. Following the abdication of the King in 1940, Urdăreanu left the country together with him and Madame Lupescu to seek asylum and he stayed with them for the rest of his life. Early years Little is known about the early years of Urdăreanu. He had two brothers – one an engineer and the other a businessman. His family's background was in the military; his father was a captain in the army. Urdăreanu also received military training. He was a skilled car driver and was interested in motor sports. In 1928 and 1929 he won the first and second Rally of San Remo, on Fiat cars. Originally a cavalry officer in Craiova, Urdăreanu came in 1931 into the service of the King as an aide at the palace, advocated by Romania's Minister in London, Nicolae Titulescu, who allegedly was a relative of his. He then became head of the palace garage and the regular chauffeur of Madame Lupescu. In 1933 he was appointed private secretary of the King, after a conflict between the King and Constantin ‘Puiu’ Dimitrescu, who had been the King’s secretary and ‘watchdog’ from the time of their asylum in France in the late twenties. In 1936 Urdăreanu was promoted to vice-marshal of the palace and a year later marshal of the palace, or head of the royal household.  The Camarilla  Urdăreanu was part of the so-called camarilla around the King, which consisted of the King's mistress Elena ('Magda') Lupescu, the wealthy industrialists Nicolae Malaxa, Max Auschnitt, Aristide Blank and others. This camarilla, partly Jewish (Auschnitt, Blank and Lupescu), attracted much hatred in Romania because of its members' decadent lifestyle and of their corruption. Urdăreanu owed his strong position not to any special skills or capacities, but to the unlimited trust of the King and of Madame Lupescu. Contemporaries called him shrewd, sly, slick, resentful and corrupt. In the palace he decided who had access to the King and for what purposes. It was alleged that people who wanted to speak to the King first had to pay Urdăreanu to get access. Urdăreanu also had a decisive vote on political appointments. He is quoted to have boasted: ‘Madame Lupescu controls the King, but I control Madame Lupescu, so I control Romania’. There were also rumours that Urdăreanu and Lupescu were lovers.  Royal Minister  Urdăreanu was not only an influential adviser to the King, from 1938 till the end of the reign on September 6, 1940, he was as Minister of the Court the representative of the King in the government. In that capacity he was member of the Crown Council, which made decisions during moments of severe crises – for instance the forced cession of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina in June 1940 and Northern Transylvania in August 1940. According to King Carol II's diary, Urdăreanu voted, on 28 June 1940 in the Crown Council, against the cession of Bessarabia to the Soviet Union, no doubt on orders from the King. In 1938 Urdăreanu accompanied King Carol and Crown Prince Michael on their state visit to the United Kingdom, and afterwards on their visit to the French Government in Paris and Adolf Hitler at Berchtesgaden, although Urdăreanu was not received by the Führer. Urdăreanu served regularly to solve difficult tasks for the King. In February 1939, on occasion of the King's conflict with the historian Nicolae Iorga concerning the King's political party, the National Renaissance Front (FRN) which was vehemently opposed by Iorga, Urdăreanu was dispatched to the University of Bucharest to stop Iorga from publicizing his criticism. At the beginning of 1940 Urdăreanu also acted as a representative of the King to reach a settlement with the Fascist Iron Guard. As the King's man Urdăreanu had a seat on the boards of numerous companies in which Carol II had financial interests. It is generally believed that Urdăreanu was helping the King to transfer large sums of money out of the country and to foreign banks, and that he did not neglect his own financial benefit in the process.  Exile  When King Carol and Madame Lupescu were forced to leave the country after the King's abdication on 6 September 1940, Urdăreanu accompanied them on their adventurous flight from the country during which the royal train was hounded and shot at by members of the Iron Guard. First they went to Switzerland and afterwards to Spain, where they stayed in Barcelona, Madrid, and Seville. Due to constant pressure from the German and Romanian governments for the extradition of Lupescu and Urdăreanu, on account of their suspected crimes and corruption, in March 1941 Urdăreanu organised their flight to Portugal. After a brief stay in Portugal, King Carol, Lupescu and Urdăreanu sought asylum further, first in Cuba, afterwards in Mexico and Brazil. A long- time bachelor, Urdăreanu himself married in 1944 in Mexico the 18 year old Monique Cook. He organized in 1947 in Brazil the marriage of King Carol to Elena Lupescu. In 1949 all four returned to Portugal, where they set up a household in Estoril, with Urdăreanu still as secretary and chamberlain of the King. After the unexpected death of King Carol in 1953, Urdăreanu organized the funeral in Lisbon, which was not attended by ex-King Michael, partly because the latter didn’t want to meet Lupescu and Urdăreanu. Michael, who detested Urdăreanu, used to call him ‘Murdăreanu’ (‘murdărie’ meaning dirt). After King Carol II's death, Urdăreanu and his wife stayed with Madame Lupescu until her death in 1977. Urdăreanu later died in Portugal in 1985, at 88, never returning to Romania.

During his 15 years at Purdue, he was able to attract a number of talented players, including All-Americans Terry Dischinger and Dave Schellhase. While finishing as Big Ten runner-up on three occasions, Purdue failed to win the title during Eddy's tenure, and never advanced to postseason play. Eddy's 176 wins rank third all-time at Purdue, as do his 15 years on the bench. In addition, Eddy ranks 3rd all-time in Big Ten wins among Purdue coaches with 92. His 92 Big Ten wins currently rank 23rd in 100+ years of Big Ten history. In addition to All-Americans Dischinger and Schellhase; Eddy also coached 2 college football All-Americans: ( Lamar Lundy, the future NFL great, Bob Griese, NFL Super Bowl Champion, Hall of Famer. ) Eddy also coached Pete Brewster, a 2x Pro Bowl TE for the Cleveland Browns and Joe Campbell, former PGA Tour player and Purdue golf coach. Several of Eddy's players went into coaching at the collegiate as well as high school level; the most well-known include Schellhase (Indiana State, Moorhead (Minn) State), Joe Sexson, (Butler) and Mel Garland (IUPUI).

Life  From 1963, Wikander studied Classical Archaeology and Ancient History, History, History of Art, and Classical Languages at Lund University. He received his BA in 1967 and PhD in 1980, both at Lund. From 1979 to 1981, Wikander worked as a curator at the Greek and Roman department of the Medelhavsmuseet (Mediterranean Museum) in Stockholm. From 1981, he has been on the staff of the Department of Classics and the Department of Archaeology at the University of Lund. From 1985 to 1991, he held the position as researcher in ancient technology at the Swedish Research Council of Humanities. He was appointed professor at Lund University in 2001 and retired in 2008. Wikander took part in the Swedish excavations at Acquarossa, Etruria in 1968–1975, 1978 and 1991. For shorter periods, he excavated at Uppåkra, Sweden (1968), Val Beretta, Etruria (1972, 1974), and in the Baths of Caracalla, Rome (1980). As of 2011, Wikander has published five books and more than 120 scholarly and popular articles and reviews. He has been the editor or co-editor of four conference acta and handbooks.  Work  Roman watermill (modern model) Wikander, basing his argument on the constantly increasing archaeological evidence for ancient watermills, makes a case for the breakthrough of watermilling occurring much earlier than previously thought, possibly already in the first century A.D. The wide distribution of watermill sites indicates that this labour-saving technology was adopted throughout the empire and must have had a significant impact on the late Roman economy. The relative lack of ancient written evidence compared to the medieval period is rather due to the general urban focus of ancient authors, while the watermill was primarily a rural phenomenon. Wikander's studies of ancient architectural terracottas are focused around the development of tiled roofs in Archaic Etruria. By detailed publications of the entire tile material from some of the most important sites (Acquarossa, San Giovenale, Poggio Civitate), he has been able to present a general systematization of the early typological development in the area, together with a description of its basic technological prerequisites. He is also working on the publication of parts of the monumental zone at Acquarossa. Wikander's prosopographical studies of senators and equites aim at a better understanding of the connections – economic and other – between the two leading classes of the Roman Republic. His basic hypothesis is that these contacts, often confirmed by marriage alliances, were far closer than generally acknowledged. Together with his late wife Charlotte, Wikander has put in order the notes and documents concerning Etruscan inscriptions assembled by Olof August Danielsson during his preparations for the Corpus Inscriptionum Etruscarum (CIE) between 1886 and 1933. One substantial result of this work has been the publication of addenda and corrigenda to CIE II,1,4.

It is located next to the city of Kirwin in northern Kansas. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation built it and continues to operate it for the purposes of flood control and area irrigation. The Kirwin National Wildlife Refuge lies on its shores. History Following the agricultural devastation of the Dust Bowl during the 1930s, local residents and state officials advocated for construction of a dam in the Solomon River basin to create a reservoir for irrigation. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation began investigating potential sites in 1939. The Flood Control Act of 1944 authorized construction of Kirwin Dam and Reservoir as part of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program, but World War II and its aftermath delayed the effort. Kirwin Irrigation District No. 1 organized in 1950. A massive flood of the entire Kansas River basin stoked public demand for flood control infrastructure. In response, the U.S. Congress passed an appropriation act directing the immediate construction of Kirwin Dam and Reservoir for flood control, but allowing for further study before starting irrigation operations. Construction of Kirwin Dam began in March 1952 and lasted until completion of the project in August 1955. Storage of water in the reservoir began in October 1955. The next month, contractors started building Kirwin Canal and its extensions east of the dam, finishing construction in January 1958. Kirwin National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1954 as an overlay project on the flood control and irrigation efforts at the site. The first such national refuge in Kansas, it was created to conserve and manage local wildlife, specifically migratory birds. Geography Kirwin Reservoir is located at (39.6560352, -99.1609843) at an elevation of . It lies in northern Kansas in the Smoky Hills region of the Great Plains. The reservoir is located entirely within Phillips County. The reservoir is impounded at its eastern end by Kirwin Dam. The dam is located at (39.6583439, -99.1239777) at an elevation of . The North Fork Solomon River and Bow Creek are the reservoir's primary inflows; the North Fork Solomon is also its primary outflow. Kansas Highway 9 runs generally east-west north of the reservoir. East 1100 Road, a paved county road, runs generally north-south immediately east of the reservoir. There is one settlement at the reservoir: Kirwin, Kansas, located immediately below the dam. Hydrography The surface area, surface elevation, and water volume of the reservoir fluctuate based on inflow and local climatic conditions. In terms of capacity, the Bureau of Reclamation vertically divides the reservoir into a set of pools based on volume and water level, and it considers the reservoir full when filled to the capacity of its active conservation pool. When full, Kirwin Reservoir has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . When filled to maximum capacity, it has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . The streambed underlying the reservoir has an elevation of . Since the reservoir's initial flooding, sedimentation has gradually accumulated on the reservoir bottom thus raising its elevation. Infrastructure Kirwin Dam is a rolled earth-fill embankment dam with a structural height of and a length of . At its crest, the dam has an elevation of . A concrete spillway controlled by 15 gated sluiceways is located at the south end of the dam. It empties into a short channel which joins the North Fork Solomon River east of the dam. Outlet works through the dam, including a stilling well, empty directly into the river and the Kirwin Main Canal. When the reservoir is at maximum water surface elevation, the spillway has a discharge capacity of . The canal outlet has a discharge capacity of , and the river outlet has a capacity of . The Kirwin Main Canal extends east from the dam for on the north side of the river. It then branches into the Kirwin North Canal, which continues for another , and the Kirwin South Canal, which crosses the river in a siphon and continues along its south side for another . of lateral canals extend outward from all three central canals. The entire network provides irrigation to of land. Management The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation operates and maintains Kirwin Dam and Reservoir. The local irrigation authority, Kirwin Irrigation District No. 1, operates and maintains the canals, laterals, and drains. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service administers the reservoir surface and most of the surrounding land as the Kirwin National Wildlife Refuge. Recreation Kirwin Reservoir is open for sport fishing year-round. The Fish and Wildlife Service permits hunting for waterfowl and upland game during appropriate seasons. Wildlife Fish species resident in Kirwin Reservoir include black crappie, channel catfish, largemouth and smallmouth bass, walleye, and wiper. The surrounding wildlife refuge is home to a broad variety of animals including mule and white-tailed deer, hawks, owls, pheasants, prairie chickens, bobwhite quail, and Rio Grande turkeys. During the winter, the area hosts populations of both bald and golden eagles. In addition, Kirwin serves as a staging point for water birds such as cormorants and pelicans. A remote portion of the refuge serves as a Research Natural Area consisting of bluestem Big bluestem, Andropogon gerardi, and little bluestem, Schizachyrium scoparium. and grama prairie grasses.

The crash occurred on April 26, 1937, as the train was traveling Northwestward from Delta, Colorado to Grand Junction, Colorado, on the D&RGW; tracks, near Dominguez Canyon. The trestle had burned out earlier that same day, leaving the rails hanging unsupported over Wells Gulch. Due to the darkness, the engineer was not able to see the danger ahead until it was too late. Earlier that same day, the same engine and crew had passed over the same location westbound, and at that time the trestle crossing was in good condition. The official inquiry ruled that the crash was an accident due to the burned-out bridge. Both members of the engine crew were killed and seven were injured including five passengers, as well as the railway clerk and express manager, but none seriously.  Sequence of events  On April 26, 1937, the D&RGW; train number 319 had left Delta at 7:25pm heading Northwest to Grand Junction, Colorado. About 35 minutes later, when it was about 17.1 miles from Delta and traveling along the tracks next to the Gunnison River, it crashed into Wells Gulch near Dominguez Canyon. The train had attempted to cross over the gulch without realizing the trestle had burnt out sometime earlier that same day. Due to the time of the accident, at 8pm, the engineer had no indication whatsoever of the condition and didn't even have time to apply the brakes. The train, which consisted of the coal-powered steam engine #777, plus a combination mail and baggage car, an additional baggage car, one coach and one Pullman sleeping car, was traveling at about 25-30 mph and was derailed as it crossed over the south end of Wells Gulch at bridge 389.60. The trestle supporting the tracks had been destroyed by fire sometime in the previous twelve hours. The last train to cross over the same spot, had been the same train and crew at about 7:40am the morning of the crash. The investigation that followed the crash was unable to determine the cause of the fire, but two possible theories were mentioned, but no facts to support either were presented, so the crash was ruled an accident. The fireman, Fred S. Perkins, who had worked for the D&RGW; since 1898, was killed instantly. The engineer, Charles D. Freeman, who had worked for the D&RGW; since 1903, suffered extensive burns from the escaping steam, and died the following day at St. Mary's Hospital, in Grand Junction. The locomotive pulling the train, T-29 class 4-6-0 Ten-wheeler #777 (built by Brooks Locomotive Works in 1908) was later scrapped in October 1938.  Causes  The immediate cause of the accident was the burned out trestle that left the rails unsupported as they crossed over Wells Gulch, near Domniguez Canyon.  Recommendations  No known recommendations were made.

Kacem speaks English, as well as German, French, Arabic and Berber. Mostly known for his publicly voiced atheism, his writings stress the importance of freedom of thought which, in his view is lacking in countries dominated by Islam. His articles have been published in/by the Richard Dawkins Foundation, Huffington Post, Le Monde, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Basler Zeitung and others. In 2017 El Ghazzali was granted Swiss citizenship, and was chosen as one of the 14 most influential Swiss intellectuals of the year by the Basler Zeitung. El Ghazzali was also named Swiss of the Year 2018 by the Sunday newspaper SonntagsZeitung among 30 other personalities. In the same year he was one of the 200 most prominent Zurich personalities of the Swiss Magazine Who is Who.  Biography  Kacem El Ghazzali comes from a sufi Berber family. His grandfather built a mosque in his village, his father, a dentist, wanted to have the son trained as an imam. Although Sufism preaches a mystical, undogmatic Islam, Kacem felt the religion of childbirth as restrictive and controlling. = Blogging and activism = El Ghazzali was the author of the Bahmut blog, one of the most controversial blogs in the Arab world, and has received a number of death threats because of his views. His blog discusses issues ranging from freedom of expression to political Islam. He used to be the head of the Youth Chapter at the Moroccan Center for Human Rights and is a member of the Executive Board of the Moroccan Blogger Association and CyberDissidents.org Blogger Board and one of its founders. El Ghazzali is one of the few atheist activists in Morocco and is a proponent of religious and sexual freedom. When he publicly declared his atheism in 2010, it caused outrage in Moroccan society, and resulted in public protests and numerous death threats against him. He has been living as a refugee in Switzerland since 2011. He has appeared repeatedly in international media, including television. In 2012, he launched the \\"Masayminch\\" initiative, which calls on Moroccans who do not observe Ramadan to eat publicly. Moroccans born in non-Jewish families are forbidden by law to drink, eat, or smoke in public during Ramadan. In the same year, El Ghazzali founded the Association of Ex-Muslims of Switzerland, which in December 2012 successfully raised public pressure to ban Saudi fundamentalist imam Mohamad al-Arefe from entering Switzerland to preach. His novel Casablanca Geneva flight number: 8J540 (2013) is named after the airplane 'flight to freedom' that brought him from Morocco to Switzerland. El Ghazzali was a speaker at the 47th session of the St. Gallen Symposium on 3–5 May 2017 and was one of the carefully hand- picked members of the Symposium Leaders of Tomorrow-knowledge pool. = Human rights at the UN HRC = El Ghazzali looking over Zürich, 2014 Since 2012 El Ghazzali has been serving as International Humanist and Ethical Union Representative at the United Nations Human Rights Council, Geneva, where he criticized Saudi Arabia for persecuting freethinkers and liberals like the poet Hamza Kashgari and the blogger Raif Badawi. El Ghazali also criticised his home state of Morocco for unconstitutionally silencing the voices of atheists. During the 25th Session of the Human Rights Council, El Ghazzali criticised the fact that several states in which convicted ‘blasphemers’ are currently in jail are also current members of the Human Rights Council. At the beginning of the 37th session of the Human Rights Council, Iran's Justice Minister Alireza Avayi criticised “self-identified champions of human rights who, through finger pointing, unjustly and widely blame others for violations of human rights” at the United Nations. In his intervention, El Ghazzali criticised the fact that Iran prevents girls and women from attending certain sporting events and forces them to wear the veil. Addressing the council, El Ghazzali also said that \\"Iran’s human rights record brings shame on us all.\\" = Raif Badawi Foundation = Ensaf Haidar with Kacem El Ghazzali In September 2015, Ensaf Haidar announced the formation of the Raif Badawi Foundation, named for her husband who is now carrying out a decade-long prison term, sentenced to 1000 lashes for his religious and political dissent. El Ghazzali was chosen as a member of the international advisory board (as co- director) of Raif Badawi Foundation for Freedom.

History =Beginning= Fisher Foods, Cleveland’s largest supermarket chain for its 80-year history, was founded in 1907 as Fisher Brothers Company. The Fisher Brothers, Manning and Charles, were natives of Jersey City, New Jersey. They started in the grocery business in New York City at the end of the 19th century, when Manning worked for James Butler, a grocer who owned 150 stores in the city. The brothers were eager to start their own chain, and opened their first store in Cleveland at 4623 Lorain Avenue. =Post-war era= Fisher Foods was not doing well in the post-war era. By the mid-1960s, the 75-store chain was losing money on $86 million in annual sales, and held only 12% of the Cleveland market it had once dominated. In 1965, a group of investors that included two sets of brothers, Carl and John Fazio and Sam and Frank Costa, purchased a controlling interest in Fisher Foods for an estimated $3.1 million. The investors were all involved in the Stop-N-Shop Super Markets Association. The purchase merged Fisher Foods with the other investors' namesake chains, the Fazio's and Costa supermarkets. =Expansion= In 1968, Fisher Foods made its first acquisition outside the Ohio market, with the purchase of Chicago's Dominick's, an 18-store chain with locations throughout the city and near the suburbs. Dominick's was a family- owned business with a good reputation. Dominick’s was a relatively small chain compared to Chicago market leader Jewel Tea, other competitors National Tea and A&P;, but that changed in the coming years as Dominick’s grew tremendously under Fisher Foods, eventually making it number two in the market. Dominick DiMatteo, Jr., company president and son of Dominick’s founder, was named as vice president of Fisher Foods. Fisher Foods also acquired the Kanter's chain in Cincinnati, Ohio Fisher Foods entered the fast food business in 1969, when it acquired a stake in Columbus, Ohio-based National Fast Food Corporation, owners of the Arthur Treacher's Fish & Chips chain. As part of the agreement, Fisher Foods took over territory rights for Arthur Treacher’s in the Cleveland and Chicago markets, then totaling over 100 restaurants. Another company Fisher Foods took over during the late sixties was Clabers, a seven-store chain of department stores in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area. The company expanded into the Southern California market in 1972 with the purchase of Shopping Bag, which was itself the combination of a chain that Vons had to divest due to an antitrust ruling in the Supreme Court and the Southern California A&P; operation. Following the merger, the stores were rebranded Fazio's Shopping Bag. These stores were later sold to Albertsons, which bought 46 Fazio's stores in 1978 from Fisher Foods. Albertsons already operated 47 stores in Southern California, mainly in Orange County. In the 1980s, the DiMatteo family became unhappy with the agreement and bought back the Dominick's chain for $100 million.dominick-s-finer-foods-inc: Web Search Results from Answers.com =Downfall= In 1988, Fisher Foods was in financial problems, and merged with Rini-Rego Stop N Shop chain and Seaway Foods Wholesaler to form Riser Foods.

George Washington's winning side in the war called themselves \\"Patriots\\", and in this article Americans on the revolutionary side are called Patriots. For a detailed analysis of the psychology and social origins of the Loyalists, see Loyalist (American Revolution). This article is an overview of some of the prominent Loyalist military units of the Revolution, and of the fighting they did for the British Crown. The Loyalist population The number of Americans who adhered to the British side after fighting commenced is still debated. An American historian has estimated that about 450,000 Americans remained loyal to Britain during the Revolution. This would be about sixteen percent of the total population, or about 20 percent of Americans of European origin. The Loyalists were as socially diverse as their Patriot opponents but some groups produced more Loyalists. Thus they included many Anglicans (Episcopalians) in the North East, many tenant farmers in New York and people of Dutch origin in New York and New Jersey, many of the German population of Pennsylvania, some Quakers, most of the Highland Scots in the South, and many Iroquois Indians.Middlekauff, Robert, The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789, Oxford University Press, 1982, pp. 549-550 Many people with close business connections to Britain who lived in coastal towns remained loyal. Loyalists were most often people who were conservative by nature or in politics, valued order, were fearful of 'mob' rule, felt sentimental ties to the Mother Country, were loyal to the King, or concerned that an independent new nation would not be able to defend themselves.Leonard Woods Labaree, Conservatism in Early American History (1948). Some escaped slaves became Loyalists. They fought for the British not out of loyalty to the Crown, but from a desire for freedom, which the British promised them in return for their military service. (Other African-Americans fought on the Patriot side, for the same motive). The story of the black Loyalists is outlined, with references, later in this article. The longer the Revolutionary War went on, the more fluid and dynamic the \\"Patriot\\" and \\"Loyalist\\" categories became; and the larger the population became that did not fit neatly into either camp.Ellis, Joseph J., American Creation: Triumph and Tragedies at the Founding of the Republic, Vintage Books, 2007, p. 75 It is estimated that between 20-45% of the population were somewhere in the middle as \\"Trimmers' or neutrals who bent with the wind. Arming the Loyalists in New England As early as 1774, the Loyalist Edward Winslow met secretly with the Royal Governor of Massachusetts, Thomas Hutchinson, who approved Winslow's raising a \\"Tory Volunteer Company\\", whose purpose was to protect Loyalist families from roving mobs. Before fighting begin, Colonel Thomas Gilbert of Massachusetts had already raised the first Loyalist military unit. This was a force of three hundred men, armed by the British. Gilbert stored muskets, powder and bullets in his home. Shortly thereafter, Brigadier General Timothy Ruggles formed a Loyalist military unit called the \\"Loyal American Association\\", also in Massachusetts. Loyalists in New Hampshire also were arming.Thomas B. Allen, Tories Fighting for the King in America\`s First Civil War Harper, 2010, pp. 19-20; pp. 34-36 However, Patriots were arming and drilling all over New England, and outright revolution broke out on April 19, 1775, with the battles of Lexington and Concord, near Boston. The war begins Loyalists were present at the outset: British general Lord Hugh Percy's relief column, coming to the rescue of the redcoats retreating from Concord and Lexington, was accompanied by armed Loyalists in civilian clothes, members of a unit called Friends of the King. One of their number, Edward Winslow, had his horse shot out from under him, and was personally cited by Percy for bravery. Another, Samuel Murray, was captured but later released. After the British were besieged inside Boston, Loyalist recruits inside the city continued to join the British side. After the Battle of Bunker Hill, Loyalist auxiliary units helped to maintain order inside the city. But that was all they were permitted to do, prior to the British evacuation of the city.Allen, p. 61; p. 74 The Patriot invasions of British Canada The first organized Loyalist unit permitted to fight in a serious battle of the Revolution was Allan Maclean's 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants), who helped the British successfully defend Quebec after the American invasion of Canada in the last days of 1775.Allen, pp. 100-102 In 1776, Josiah Eddy, a Nova Scotian who favoured the Patriot cause, got the blessing of George Washington to try to capture Nova Scotia for the Revolution. In November, 1776, Eddy, commanding a Patriot force of Indians, exiled Acadians and Maine Patriot militia, appeared at the gates of Fort Cumberland, Nova Scotia, and demanded its surrender. His plan was then to march on Halifax. The fort was manned by the Loyalist Royal Fencible Americans. They repelled two assaults by Eddy's men, and were later joined by elements of the Royal Highland Emigrants, after which Eddy's invasion failed.Allen, pp.106-108 Highland Loyalists in America Highland Scots who had emigrated to America overwhelmingly favored the king over the Revolutionary cause. In the South, most of the Highland Scots organized quickly in the royal cause. But they early on suffered a devastating defeat. In early 1776, under the command of Brigadier General Donald Macdonald, a substantial force of North Carolina Loyalists, possibly as many as five thousand, began a march to the seacoast to join a British assault on Charleston. However, on February 27, 1776, a large Highland force under Macdonald encountered a Patriot force at Moore's Creek Bridge. The Patriots waited until an advance guard of Loyalists had crossed the bridge, then annihilated them with devastating musket and cannon fire. The Loyalists were routed.Smith, Page, A New Age Now Begins A People's History of the American Revolution (Vol. One), McGraw-Hill, 1976, pp. 624-625 The British invade New York There were many Loyalists on Long Island and in New York City; the city was sometimes called \\"Torytown\\". In August, 1776, the British commander, William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe, landed a huge force of British and Hessian troops on Long Island, and won a major victory that drove Washington's army from the island and the city of New York. Many Long Island Loyalists, wearing pieces of red cloth on their hats to show their sympathies, landed with Howe, and participated in the fighting. At the end of the revolution, Long Island was the major staging area for many Loyalist emigrant ships departing for Canada. As his men abandoned New York, Washington had wanted to burn the city to prevent the British using it, but Congress forbade it. In the aftermath of the British victory, many Loyalists came forth to be organized into uniformed Loyalist regiments. The British called these \\"provincial\\" regiments. Loyalist militia patrolled the streets of New York. Loyalist spies were extensively used to get information about Washington's dispositions. By the end of 1776, about eighteen hundred Loyalist soldiers had been recruited, most from Long Island, Staten Island, and Westchester County. Brigadier General De Lancey, a member of a prominent New York Loyalist family, organized De Lancey's Brigade. The King's American Regiment was formed. The popular French and Indian War hero Robert Rogers organized a Loyalist regiment which was very effective. By the end of 1776, seven hundred of Rogers' Rangers were raiding Patriot outposts in Westchester. Recently unearthed documents indicate that it was Rogers and his Rangers who captured the famous Patriot Nathan Hale. There was a clash between Continental troops and Rogers' men at Mamaroneck in October, 1776. Rogers was retired soon after, but his unit, now called the Queen's Rangers, went on under the command of John Graves Simcoe, to fight throughout the Revolution.Allen, pp. 157-183 More Loyalists enlist As Howe's army burst out of New York, new Loyalist regiments sprang into being. One was the New Jersey Volunteers (Skinner's Greens) who wore green coats, as did so many other Loyalist soldiers that they were often called \\"greencoats\\". The Prince of Wales' American Regiment was also raised. The British continued to recruit in southern New York, so much so that \\"Tory\\" New York eventually contributed more soldiers to the British side than to the Patriots. These men became part of an ongoing civil war in New Jersey and New York. Loyalists now sought revenge for injuries inflicted upon them while Patriots had been in the ascendant. Cruelty on both sides was commonplace. Many died. Kidnappings were also common. Loyalists seized Richard Stockton, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, and after imprisonment and cruel treatment, he broke down, and signed an oath of allegiance to George III. A British commander called the unceasing Loyalist raids \\"desolation warfare\\". Another scion of the Loyalist De Lancey family, James De Lancey, raised De Lancey's Cowboys, which raided Patriot houses and farms. The Patriots paid the De Lanceys back by burning down a De Lancey family mansion.Allen, pp. 184-208 At this early stage of the war, the Loyalist soldiers were primarily used for guard duties and keeping order, or distracted with civil warfare. Burgoyne's invasion of New York and the Vermont Republic On the northern frontier, Loyalists were often harshly treated, and they reacted in many instances by joining Loyalist military units, fearing that they could never return to their homes unless the British prevailed. A number of influential Loyalists in northern New York quickly set to work building military forces. The King's Royal Regiment of New York was raised by the wealthy Loyalist Sir John Johnson. Large numbers of Iroquois Indians were recruited to the British side by the Mohawk leader Joseph Brant (Thayendenegea).Allen, pp.214-221 In the spring of 1777, the British General John Burgoyne was ordered to invade northern New York by way of Lake Champlain. Burgoyne started south from Canada at the end of June, 1777, with a force of nearly eight thousand British regulars, German mercenaries, Loyalists, Indians and French Canadians. (There were few English-speaking Canadians at this time). Burgoyne's plan called for the British Lieutenant Colonel Barry St. Leger, commanding a force of eighteen hundred, to capture the Patriot Fort Schuyler (Fort Stanwix) at the head of the Mohawk Valley. The British besieged the fort. On August 6, 1777, a Patriot force of eight hundred men, commanded by Colonel Nicholas Herkimer, set out to relieve the Patriot garrison at the fort. Herkimer's strung-out Patriot column was ambushed near Oriskany by a force of Indians, Loyalist militia, and the Loyalist King's Royal Regiment of New York. The Patriots suffered heavy casualties in the ambush, and Herkimer was severely wounded. The dying Herkimer propped himself against a tree and continued to command his troops in a battle which saw very heavy losses on both sides. At one point, a column of Loyalists turned their green jackets inside out as a ruse, and got very close to Herkimer's men; this was followed by hand-to-hand fighting. The Indians finally fled, and the Loyalists retreated.Smith, Page, A New Age Now Begins A People's History of the American Revolution (Vol. Two), McGraw-Hill, 1976, pp. 891-912 Lieutenant Colonel Friedrich Baum's detachment of Hessian mercenaries, accompanied by Loyalists, Indians and French Canadians, was sent by Burgoyne in the direction of Bennington, Vermont. Their mission was to seize supplies. On August 16, 1777, the British column was met by a large Patriot force under John Stark. In the ensuing battle, many of the Loyalist, French Canadian and Indian positions were quickly overrun, and the defenders fled or were captured.Smith, (Vol. Two), pp. 915-919 The Loyalist Queen's Loyal Rangers were shattered as a fighting force, with more than two hundred of their men killed, wounded or captured.Allen, pp. 229-230 The Germans eventually surrendered, (and a relief force was driven off) in what was a major Patriot victory. Burgoyne's invasion was now in serious trouble. His supplies were low, Loyalists were not rallying to the colors in the numbers expected, and a huge force of Patriots was gathering against him. At Saratoga, Loyalists, Indians and French Canadians acted as scouts and sharpshooters for the British, but the fighting ended with a decisive defeat for the royal cause—the surrender of Burgoyne and his army on October 17, 1777.Allen, pp. 230-234 The Loyalist and Indian raids in New York and Pennsylvania The British general Guy Carleton, impressed by the ambush at Oriskany, authorized John Butler to raise eight more companies of Loyalist Rangers, \\"to serve with the Indians, as occasion shall require\\". This unit was Butler's Rangers.Allen, p. 252 Butler's headquarters were established at Fort Niagara. This gave the Loyalists access to the river valleys of northern New York. The British now decided that raids upon frontier settlements were the correct path to follow. An early raid was made in May, 1778, on Cobleskill, New York, where three hundred Loyalists and Indians, led by the Mohawk chief, Joseph Brant, defeated a small Patriot force of militia and Continental regulars, then burned homes, crops and barns.Allen, pp. 252-255 In late June, 1778, a mixed force of Indians and John Butler's Loyalist Rangers attacked the settlement in Wyoming Valley, in Pennsylvania. The raiders were resisted by a force of inexperienced Patriot militia. These were badly defeated. The Loyalists and Indians devastated the whole area. Reports indicated that some prisoners and fleeing Patriots were tortured and murdered. One historian has said, \\"The Tories [Loyalists] usually neither gave nor expected any quarter, and when this vengeful spirit was augmented by the Indian propensity for total war, the results were almost invariably grim.\\"Smith, (Vol. Two), pp. 1150-1158 Now Loyalists and Indians swept through the Mohawk Valley in \\"endless raids\\". In November, 1778, a mixed force of Loyalists and Indians attacked settlements in Cherry Valley, New York. The Loyalist commander this time was Walter Butler, son of John. Again, there was enormous devastation, and many civilians were killed. A contemporary account depicts Joseph Brant stopping some of Butler's men from killing a woman and child with the words \\"... that child is not an enemy to the King, nor a friend to Congress.\\"Smith, (Vol. Two), pp. 1159-1162 In retaliation for all this, George Washington ordered a full-scale attack by regular troops of the Continental Army. Generals John Sullivan and James Clinton and Colonel Daniel Brodhead, at the head of forty-six hundred men, advanced on the Indians, their objective \\"the total destruction and devastation\\" of the Iroquois settlements.Smith, (Vol. Two), p. 1163 A substantial blow to the pro-British Indians was achieved.Allen, p. 264 The British turn to the South Throughout Lord Howe's campaigning in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, many uniformed Loyalist troops had continued to be used for guard duties, keeping order and foraging. Many saw action too. John Graves Simcoe and his Queen's Rangers executed a very successful raid on Patriot forces in the Battle of Crooked Billet, in May, 1778. At Brandywine, the Queen's American Rangers fought throughout the day, and sustained heavy casualties.Allen, p. 235-251 But the British were planning a new strategy. The already-enlisted Loyalist soldiers from the North, and the not-yet-mobilized Loyalists of the South were about to go into battle on a larger scale. The British were being told that large numbers of Loyalists eagerly awaited their arrival in the South. It was decided to tap this supposed loyal sentiment. Slowly, British sentiment shifted toward a major Southern effort. To begin with, Lieutenant Colonel Archibald Campbell, in command of a British regiment, two Hessian regiments, four Loyalist battalions and artillery, was dispatched to Georgia. On December 29, 1778, the Patriots were badly defeated near Savannah, with New York Loyalists proving invaluable in the victory. Savannah was soon in British hands.Middlekauff, pp. 434-435 The British then moved against Augusta, Georgia. They were assisted by a Georgia Loyalist named Thomas Brown. Son of a wealthy family, Brown had in the summer of 1775 been confronted by a group of Patriots who demanded that he swear allegiance to the revolutionary cause. Refusing, Brown shot and wounded the Patriot leader. The other Patriots fractured Brown's skull, partially scalped him and tarred his legs and held them over a fire, burning off two of his toes. (He was known thereafter to the Patriots as \\"Burntfoot Brown\\". Two weeks after these injuries, Brown was in South Carolina, recruiting hundreds of men to the King's cause. He became a scourge to the Patriots. Brown's East Florida Rangers, some of the New York Volunteers, and the Carolina Royalists marched in Lieutenant Colonel Archibald Campbell's British column when it marched on and took Augusta. Campbell said jubilantly that he had taken \\"a stripe and star from the rebel flag\\" Allen, pp. 278-279 The British Southern strategy called for the large-scale enlistment of Southern Loyalists. The British hoped that, with the aid of the Northern Loyalist regiments now arriving in the South, the Southern Loyalists could maintain control over their neighborhoods, slowly enlarging the scope of British domination. This policy was energetically pursued. An early setback for the policy lay in the fate of the eight hundred North and South Carolina Loyalists who gathered at the Broad River under Captain Boyd. These Loyalists marched toward the Savannah, inflicting a great deal of devastation. On February 14, 1779, at Kettle Creek, Georgia, a Patriot force caught up with them, and in the ensuing battle, the Loyalists were defeated. Five of their leaders were hanged for treason.Smith, (Vol. Two), pp. 1309-1311 But the recruitment of Loyalists proceeded. The British position in the South was strengthened when British and Loyalist forces repelled a French and Patriot siege of Savannah in the fall of 1779, with great loss of life to the besiegers. Early British victories in the South Banastre Tarleton The British besieged Charleston in an arduous campaign. A crucial contribution was made by Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton, the English commander of a Loyalist unit called the British Legion. In a night attack on April 14, 1780, Tarleton took Monck's Corner, South Carolina, a strategic victory which helped seal off the Patriot garrison of Charleston from help or escape. Charleston's surrender to the British on May 12, 1780 was a disaster to the revolutionary cause. Over twenty-five hundred Continental regulars and huge supplies of Patriot weapons and ammunition were lost. Middlekauff, pp. 448-449 Another leader of Loyalists, the Scotsman Patrick Ferguson, commanded a force called the American Volunteers, who formed part of the army which took Charleston. Allen, p. 281 Now the civil war in the South widened. Banastre Tarleton's British Legion, sometimes called the Loyal Legion, was a force consisting mostly at first of Pennsylvanians. It was quickly augmented by volunteers from the South. At one point the Legion grew to nearly two thousand men. On May 29, 1780 Tarleton and his men defeated a Patriot force under Abraham Buford at Waxhaws, South Carolina. After Buford refused to surrender, the Legion charged. Tarleton's horse was shot from under him; he mounted another. Buford and eighty or ninety men escaped. Over three hundred Patriots were killed or wounded, an almost incredible percentage of those engaged. The story soon spread that the Loyalists had bayoneted many of the wounded and those trying to surrender. Patriots began to speak bitterly of \\"Buford's Quarter,\\" or \\"Tarleton's Quarter,\\" meaning none. In the civil war in the South, both sides resorted to the burning of farms and homes, torture, and summary execution on a huge scale.Allen, pp. 281-287 In the Battle of Ramsour's Mill, North Carolina, on June 20, 1780, the combatants on both sides were untrained militia, few if any in uniform. The battle was fought between neighbors, close relations and personal friends. More than half the Patriots in the battle were killed or wounded, and Loyalist casualties were very high. After the battle, the Loyalists retreated and left the Patriots in possession of the field. A prominent historian called this \\"... the most desperate engagement of the war in terms of the proportion of casualties to men involved on each side\\". The same historian has written, \\"The battle of Ramsour's Mill... was the archetypal battle of the 'new man,' the American, whether Tory or patriot; it was the supreme military expression of individualism... here every man was a general in the sense that he fought, to a very large degree, in response to his own best judgment of what should be done.\\"Smith, (Vol. Two), pp. 1399-1404; p. 1485 British fortunes reached their high point in August, 1780, when Lord Charles Cornwallis's force of British regulars and Loyalists inflicted a seemingly-decisive defeat on Patriot forces at the Battle of Camden. A substantial number of Cornwallis's three thousand men were Loyalists—North Carolina Loyalist regulars and militia, a Northern unit called the Volunteers of Ireland, and the infantry and cavalry of the British Legion. Lord Cornwallis did not oppose his Loyalists to the Patriot militia, and send his British regulars against the Continental regulars. Instead, the Loyalists faced the Patriot regulars, and the British attacked the inexperienced Patriot militia, routing them, exposing the Patriot flank, and causing the collapse and total rout of the whole Patriot army.Middlekauff, pp. 454-457 The huge British success at Camden diverted attention from a Patriot victory at Musgrove's Mill, South Carolina, fought about the same time. This little-known battle was important. In it, an outnumbered force of Patriots confronted a force of Loyalist regulars and militia. The battle was fierce and protracted, but the frontier Patriot sharpshooters inflicted heavy casualties on the Loyalists, who were completely defeated. This success did much to hearten backwoods Patriots in the aftermath of so many British successes. Smith, (Vol. Two), pp-1404-1405 The Patriot sharpshooters fared less well in September, 1780, in an attempt to retake Augusta from the British. The Patriot Colonel Elijah Clarke led nearly seven hundred mountain riflemen against a Loyalist garrison of only one hundred and fifty, accompanied by a few score Indians. But the Augusta garrison was commanded by Thomas \\"Burntfoot\\" Brown of Georgia, a resourceful man. Judging Augusta indefensible, Brown drove Clarke's men back by artillery fire, and the Loyalists then forced their way by bayonet right through the Patriot force, to the top of nearby Garden Hill. Brown held out for four days. Eventually the Patriots ran out of ammunition, but they cut off the Loyalists' water supply. Brown, in agony after yet another leg wound, ordered his men's urine be kept and cooled, and took the first drink himself. Eventually Brown's garrison was relieved by Loyalists, and the Patriots retreated. Smith, (Vol. Two), pp.1423-1424 Continuing Loyalist and Indian raids Despite Washington's retaliation, the Loyalist and Indian raids on the frontier intensified. The first order of business for the British was to destroy the Oneidas, the one tribe in New York which supported the Patriot cause. Supported by British regulars and Loyalists, the Mohawks, Senecas and Cayugas destroyed the Oneida settlements, driving the Oneidas away and destroying their usefulness as an early warning line to alert defenders that the Indian and Loyalist raiders were coming. Now Joseph Brant's Loyalist Indians devastated the frontier. In May, 1780, Sir John Johnson, commanding four hundred Loyalists and two hundred Indians, attacked many settlements in the Mohawk Valley. Brant then led his men down the Ohio, where he ambushed a detachment of troops under the command of George Rogers Clark.Smith, (Vol. Two), pp. 1178-1182 In the autumn of 1780, Johnson, commanding over a thousand Loyalists and Indians, launched another series of raids.See Watt, Gavin K., The Burning of the Valleys Daring Raids From Canada Against the New York Frontier in the Fall of 1780, Dundurn Press, 1997 Revenge was soon to follow, however. In 1781, after renewed raids, the Patriot leader Marinus Willett inflicted two defeats on the Loyalists and Indians. The second one was won over a force composed of eight hundred Loyalists and British regulars, accompanied by a much smaller force of Indians. This Patriot victory was decisive, and in it Walter Butler was killed. Marinus Willett's son said that Butler \\"had exhibited more instances of enterprise, had done more injury, and committed more murder, than any other man on the frontiers.\\" Yet only six years before, he had been a lawyer in Albany, a member of a prominent family, a handsome, graceful man.Smith, (Vol. Two), pp. 1184-1189 The tide turns in the South After Camden, Banastre Tarleton's and Patrick Ferguson's Loyalist forces had been in the ascendant. An example was Tarleton's victory over Patriot raiders at Fishing Creek, shortly after the battle at Camden.Smith, (Vol. Two), pp.1419-1420 Then a turning point came at King's Mountain, on the border of the Carolinas, on October 7, 1780. Major Patrick Ferguson commanded a Loyalist force which was enjoying success in pacifying northern South Carolina for the royal cause. But a Patriot force of over one thousand \\"over- the-mountain men\\", pioneers from the westernmost settlements, experts in the use of the rifle, was coming after him. Augmented by several hundred Patriot militiamen from the Carolinas, this force cornered Ferguson at King's Mountain. Ferguson had nine hundred Loyalist troops, made up of Southern militia and detachments from three Northern units--the King's American Rangers, the Queen's Rangers and the New Jersey Volunteers. Ferguson, inventor of a breech-loading rifle, found himself in a situation where his Loyalists were armed with muskets, and the Patriots with rifles, whose range was greater. A series of Loyalist bayonet charges drove the over-the-mountain men back several times, but eventually Loyalist resistance collapsed. Ferguson was killed. After the Loyalist force surrendered, the frontiersmen fired point- blank into a mass of Loyalist prisoners, killing nearly a hundred of them. Other Loyalists were summarily hanged. Some Loyalists escaped, but Ferguson's force was completely destroyed, a huge blow to the British.Smith, (Vol. Two), pp. 1419-1434 Now a defeat lay in store for another commander of Loyalists—Banastre Tarleton. On January 17, 1781, Tarleton went into action against the Patriot commander Daniel Morgan at Cowpens, South Carolina. Tarleton had over five hundred Loyalist infantry and cavalry of his British Legion, along with Loyalist militia and British regulars. His eleven hundred men slightly outnumbered Morgan's force, which consisted of Continental regulars and Patriot militia. The culminating moment of the battle occurred when the Patriot right gave way. The Loyalists thought that the Patriots were panicking, as they had at Camden. The Loyalists began to advance, and Tarleton ordered one of the impetuous charges for which the British Legion was famous. The Loyalists ran into massed Patriot fire, and then were taken on their flank by an expertly timed Patriot cavalry charge. It was all over very quickly. Tarleton and a few others escaped, leaving behind a hundred killed, and over eight hundred captured, including two hundred and twenty-nine wounded. Another important Loyalist force had been nearly destroyed.Middlekauff, pp. 470-476 Another Loyalist defeat followed on February 24, 1781, at the Haw River, North Carolina. The Patriot commander Colonel Henry Lee (father of Robert E. Lee) was in pursuit of Tarleton, who was moving around the area with a renewed force, recruiting Loyalists. A force of four hundred Loyalists under John Pyle was moving to join Tarleton. But they made a disastrous mistake. Lee's men wore green coats, like Loyalists, rather than the usual Patriot blue. Pyle and his men rode up to meet what they assumed was Tarleton's Legion (Tarleton himself was only a mile away). Lee actually grasped Pyle's hand, intending to demand surrender. At the last minute, a Loyalist officer recognized the ruse and ordered his men to open fire. Ninety Loyalists were then killed and many more wounded; not a single Patriot died.Smith, (Vol. Two), pp. 1470-1472 On March 15, 1781, the British won a victory at Guilford Court House, North Carolina. Tarleton's cavalry was present. This was a tactical British victory with huge losses, which made it clear that British power in the South was waning. On April 25, 1781, another battle was fought at Hobkirk's Hill, near Camden. An American historian has called Lord Rawdon's outnumbered nine- hundred-man British force \\"a motley collection of Loyalists stiffened by a few regulars\\".Smith (Vol. Two), p. 1492 In fact, the British force consisted mostly of Northern Loyalist units--the King's American Regiment, the New York Volunteers and the Volunteers of Ireland-- and a South Carolina militia unit. The Patriot forces were eventually driven from the field.Smith (Vol. Two), pp. 1486-1495 But British power in the South continued to decline. Now the forts established by the British and manned by Loyalists fell to the Patriots, or were abandoned one by one. A major engagement was fought at Fort Ninety-Six, South Carolina, from May 22 to June 19, 1781. The defenders consisted of five hundred and fifty Loyalists, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Cruger, a New Yorker. Three hundred and fifty of Cruger's men were members of regular Loyalist regiments; the rest were South Carolina Loyalist militia. The besiegers consisted of a thousand Patriots under Nathanael Greene. The Patriots at Ninety-Six used classic siege warfare techniques, inching ever closer to the Loyalist fortifications. Cruger ordered attack after attack on the Patriot lines, to try to disrupt the work. Exhorted to surrender, Cruger defied Greene's \\"promises or threats\\". Hearing that Lord Rawdon was marching to the relief of the fort, Greene ordered a general attack. It was a failure. One hundred and eighty-five Patriot attackers were killed or wounded. In a few more days, the fort would have fallen, but Greene broke off the engagement and retreated.Smith (Vol. Two), pp. 1502-1506 The story of the Ninety-Six siege from the Loyalist point of view is told in detail in the classic novel Oliver Wiswell, by Kenneth Roberts. The last major battle in the South took place on September 8, 1781, at Eutaw Springs, South Carolina. The British forces included Loyalist units commanded by John Coffin and John Cruger (still fighting after abandoning Fort Ninety-Six.) After a long, bloody struggle the Patriots retreated. But the battle did nothing to halt British decline in the South. Middlekauff, pp 493-495 The British and Loyalists in the South had shown energy and courage. It had not been enough. As one historian said, \\"A vast area, far from the center of the stage in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, was seized by the British. The patriots, without anything but hindrance from their French allies, met initially with disastrous setbacks but finally, in a campaign that is a textbook study in the tactics and techniques of partisan warfare, recovered, for all practical purposes, the Carolinas and Georgia.\\" Smith, (Vol. Two), p. 1507 By the time of the battle at Eutaw Springs, Cornwallis and the main part of his army had marched into Virginia. During the early part of his Virginia campaign, Cornwallis used the Loyalist cavalry as his \\"eyes.\\" Tarleton's Legion had, after its defeats in the Carolinas, grown back to eight hundred men, mounted on Virginia thoroughbred hunters. Their defeats had robbed them of some of the dash they'd previously shown. But they remained dangerous. Cornwallis sent Tarleton and his men on a lightning raid against the Virginia Patriot government at Charlottesville, Virginia. The aim was to capture the House of Burgesses, and the Governor, Thomas Jefferson. Tarleton moved with his usual swiftness, by back roads. As his men passed the Cuckoo Tavern, near Louisa, Virginia, they were overheard by a celebrated Patriot marksman and horseman named Jack Jouett. He saw through a window, by faint moonlight, the hated Tory cavalry trotting past. Jouett set out with great success to arouse the neighborhood. He woke up Jefferson and his family at Monticello. Mrs. Jefferson and the children were removed to safety. Jouett also warned the Patriot legislators. When Tarleton stopped at the plantation of a Patriot, Mrs. Walker, she reputedly deliberately delayed Tarleton and his Loyalist officers with an enormous breakfast of salt herring, salt beef and johnnycake. But then the Legion lunged at Charlottesville. They moved so fast that they captured a thousand Patriot muskets, four hundred barrels of gunpowder, seven members of the House of Burgesses, and very nearly, Jefferson himself. At about the same time, John Graves Simcoe and his Loyalist Rangers moved against the Patriot commander von Steuben, who was guarding Patriot supplies. Steuben fled, and the stores were captured by the Loyalists. Smith, (Vol. Two), pp. 1631-1633 But the endgame was at hand. Cornwallis moved to fortify himself at Yorktown. A huge force of Patriot and French soldiers moved against him, and Cornwallis's surrender on October 19, 1781 proved decisive in winning the war. British-Loyalist raids Minor Loyalist raids continued well after the surrender at Yorktown. On July 2, 1779, William Tryon, a former royal governor, assembled a force of twenty-six hundred regulars, Hessians, and a major Loyalist regiment, the King's American Regiment. This force attacked New Haven, Connecticut. Colonel Edmund Fanning of the King's Americans dissuaded Tryon from burning Yale College and the town (Fanning was a Yale graduate). The sacking of New Haven gave birth to a Yale legend. Napthali Daggett, a former college president, was caught firing at the royal troops. A British officer asked him if he would fire on them again if his life was spared. \\"Nothing more likely,\\" said Daggett, who was promptly bayoneted. But a former student of his, William Chandler, a Loyalist officer, saved his life. Tryon's force went on to sack and burn the nearby town of Fairfield, then the town of Norwalk.Allen, pp. 302-306 William Franklin was the Loyalist son of Benjamin Franklin, and the former royal governor of New Jersey. One historian has called Franklin \\"one of the most dangerous Tories in America.\\"Allen, p. 295 Franklin's unit, the Associated Loyalists, launched a series of raids in New Jersey.Allen, pp. 307-320 On one occasion, the Associated Loyalists seized a well-known Patriot leader, Joshua Huddy. The Loyalists wanted revenge for the death of Philip White, a Loyalist who had been captured by Patriots and shot while trying to escape. The Loyalists hanged Huddy, leaving him swinging with a message pinned to his breast, reading in part \\"... Up goes Huddy for Philip White.\\"Smith (Vol. Two), p. 1750 The last major event of the war in the North came in September, 1781, when Benedict Arnold, now a British general, led a mainly Loyalist force of seventeen hundred men, which included Arnold's own American Legion, some New Jersey Volunteers and other Loyalists, in burning down New London, Connecticut.Allen, pp. 320-321 This was the last of the major Loyalist raids in the North. The Black Loyalists Sir Guy Carleton The Revolution offered an opportunity for large numbers of slaves to fight, and many did, on both sides, in the hope of earning their freedom.For a full account, see Gilbert, Alan, Black Patriots and Loyalists Fighting For Emancipation in the War For Independence, University of Chicago Press, 2012 It has been suggested that two revolutions went on at once—the Patriot one against the British, and a second one fought by blacks for their freedom.Gilbert, p. 6 Throughout the war, the British repeatedly offered freedom to those slaves who would join their side. One historian has said, \\"Thousands of blacks fought with the British.\\"Zinn, Howard, A People's History of the United States, Harper Perennial Modern Classics, 2005, p. 88 One American historian has gone so far as to assert that the British position on black civil rights during the Revolution was morally superior to that of the Patriots. Gilbert, p. xi The story began when Lord Dunmore, the former royal governor of Virginia, on November 7, 1775, proclaimed freedom for all slaves (or indentured servants) belonging to Patriots, if they were able and willing to bear arms, and joined the British forces. One historian has said, \\"The proclamation had a profound effect on the war, transforming countless slaveholders into Rebels and drawing thousands of slaves to the Loyalist side.\\"Allen, p. 155 Within a month of the proclamation, more than five hundred slaves left their masters and became Loyalists. The Ethiopian Regiment was raised, and put on uniforms with \\"Liberty to Slaves\\" across the chest. British regulars, white Loyalists and the Ethiopian Regiment attacked Great Bridge, near Norfolk, Virginia. The attack failed, and thirty-two captured blacks were sold by their captors back into slavery.Allen, pp. 154-155 Some of the Ethiopian Regiment escaped with Dunmore to New York shortly after the city was captured by the British in 1776. There the regiment was disbanded, but some of its men joined the Black Pioneers. This unit had been formed by the British general Henry Clinton, in North Carolina, from slaves responding to Dunmore's proclamation. (A pioneer in the British Army was a soldier who built bridges and fortifications.)Allen, pp.172-173 In August 1775, South Carolina Patriots executed Thomas Jeremiah for treason. Jeremiah was a freed black man allegedly sympathetic to the British. Within three months of his death, five hundred blacks, a tenth of the black population of Charleston, had escaped to join the British forces, and both black and white Loyalists were raiding Patriot plantations.Gilbert, pp. 39-45 At the end of 1775, the British officer Captain William Dalrymple proposed that blacks be used as \\"irregulars\\"—that is, for what we now call guerilla warfare.Gilbert, p. 29 As the war ground on, an increasing number of blacks did indeed fight as Loyalist irregulars, or with the regular British forces. Estimates of the number of slaves who escaped to the British range from twenty thousand to one hundred thousand.Gilbert, p. xii Thomas Jefferson estimated that thirty thousand slaves fled their masters just during the brief British invasion of Virginia in 1781.Gilbert, p. ix Recent studies show that black soldiers fought in the British forces in large numbers, and one historian has said, that \\"... black soldiers were the secret of the imperial [British] army in North America.\\"Gilbert, p. 261 In Massachusetts, the British organized both all-black and multi-racial units. In 1779, Emmerich's Chasseurs, a Loyalist unit in New York, included blacks who raided the Patriots. There were black soldiers in De Lancey's Brigade in Savannah. There were blacks in the Royal Artillery units in Savannah, and black dragoons (cavalry). There were also large numbers of black pioneers and other non- combatant troops. At one point, ten per cent of the British forces at Savannah were black. There were substantial numbers of black soldiers in the British forces at Charleston, and analyses of British records show that blacks were represented in British units in Rhode Island at about the same time (1779).Gilbert, pp. 122-127 One of the most prominent black Loyalists was an escaped slave named Tye. This young man escaped in 1775 from his master in New Jersey, at that time a colony where slavery was legal. In Virginia, Colonel Tye joined Dunmore's regiment. After the regiment was disbanded, Tye fought on the British side in the battle of Monmouth. Colonel Tye, so-called by the British, then founded a unit which the British called the Black Brigade. The Brigade raided Patriot homes and farms in New Jersey, gathered intelligence for the British, kidnapped Patriot leaders, and gathered firewood and provisions for the British Army. Colonel Tye's men became a scourge to the Patriots. They were headquartered in a timber-built fortress at Bull's Ferry, New Jersey. George Washington sent a thousand troops against the fortress. A force of black and white Loyalists fought them off after an assault, and the raids went on. Colonel Tye finally died after being wounded in an assault by his men on the home of Joshua Huddy, the Patriot later hanged by William Franklin's Associated Loyalists.Allen, pp. 315-317 From at least 1776 through 1779, other black Loyalists were heavily involved in raids against Patriot forces in New Jersey.Gilbert, p. 147 An American historian has said about the war in the South, \\"The more intelligent and articulate [sic] of the freed slaves were quite frequently used by the British as guides in raiding parties or assigned to the commissary…\\"Smith, (Vol. Two), p. 1393 (to help round up provisions). Eliza Wilkinson, daughter of slave-holding Patriots, recorded a Loyalist raid of which she thought one of the most terrible features was the presence of \\"armed Negroes\\".Smith, (Vol. Two), p. 1394 Battalions of blacks fought in the successful defense of Savannah against a French and Patriot siege at the end of 1779. One British observer wrote, \\"Our armed Negroes [were] skirmishing with the rebels the whole afternoon\\", and, later, \\"... the armed Negroes brought in two Rebel Dragoons and eight Horses, and killed two Rebels who were in a foraging party.\\"Gilbert, p. 154 When Lord Cornwallis invaded Virginia in 1781, twenty-three of Jefferson's slaves escaped and joined the British forces.Allen, pp. 154-155 It was said that two or three thousand black Loyalists were with Cornwallis in the Carolinas.Smith, (Vol. Two), p. 1399 British treatment of the black Loyalists was not uniform. The black soldiers were often housed in crowded, disease-ridden conditions.Smith, (Vol. Two), p. 1393 On one occasion, British transport ships were leaving a Southern port for the West Indies, and were not able to take on all the blacks who wanted to escape. The black Loyalists clung to the sides of ships (risking capsizing them) until their fingers were chopped off by British soldiers. Others were abandoned on an island where twenty years after the Revolution, the ground was littered with their bones.Smith, (Vol. Two), p. 1330 When the war ended, the question arose as to what would happen to the Loyalists. The British were willing and anxious to reward white Loyalists and their families by helping them escape from the vengeance of Patriots. This particularly included those who had fought on the British side. But what would happen to the blacks? As the fighting ended, escaped slaves were flooding into British- occupied New York City. Even there, blacks lived in terror of their former owners. Boston King, an escaped slave who had fought with the British, said \\"... we saw our old masters coming from Virginia, North Carolina, and other parts, and seizing upon their slaves in the streets of New York, or even dragging them out of their beds.\\"Allen, pp. 330-331 Then the British government, having promised emancipation to all former slaves who fought for it, concluded a peace treaty ending the war. The treaty said, in article 7, that the British were to leave the United States \\"without ... carrying away any Negroes\\". Many of the senior British officers in North America refused to comply with article 7. The British general Sir Guy Carleton (later Lord Dorchester), who commanded in New York City, believed that any black American who had served the mother country was not property; he (and his family) were British subjects. In defiance of the plain language of the treaty, (and of his own political masters in London), he began to issue passes which allowed the black bearer to go to Nova Scotia, or wherever else the freed black thought proper.Allen, p. 331 In May, 1783, George Washington met with Carleton. Washington protested about the British policy of carrying escaped slaves away. Carleton told Washington that the British were compiling a list of all the blacks who were being helped to escape, called the Book of Negroes.Allen, pp. 331-332 A contemporary account states that \\"Sir Guy Carleton observed that no interpretation could be put upon the article [article 7 of the peace treaty] inconsistent with prior [promises] binding the National Honor which must be kept with all colors\\", and Carleton rebuked Washington for the suggestion that a British officer would consent to a \\"notorious breach of the public faith towards people of any complexion\\".Gilbert, pp. 177-178 One black Loyalist who was eventually evacuated by Carleton had belonged to Thomas Jefferson, and three to George Washington.Allen, p. 332 Eventually, nearly three thousand ex- slaves were evacuated by Carleton to Nova Scotia. One of their leaders there was Colonel Stephen Blucke, commander of the Black Brigade after Colonel Tye's death. Some eventually went on to Sierra Leone. Boston King and his wife were among them. Many remained in Nova Scotia.Allen, pp. 330-333 Nor were Carleton's evacuees from New York City the only black Loyalists to escape from the United States. Thousands of other blacks escaped to Canada by other means, many on ships leaving Charleston or Savannah. Others escaped to British Florida. A total of between ninety-one hundred and ten thousand four hundred black Loyalists eventually found refuge in Canada.Gilbert, pp. 190-205 The fate of the Loyalists \\"Tory Refugees on their way to Canada\\" by Howard Pyle The majority of the 400,000 to 500,000 Loyalists remained in the United States after the British left. Those who were in Loyalist combat units, and non- combatant Loyalist families who had very visibly aided the British cause, and/or were unshakably loyal to Britain, mostly left. The largest number became the foundation of the English-speaking Canadian community.Maya Jasanoff, Liberty's Exiles: American Loyalists in the Revolutionary World (2011). According to recent estimates, about 62,000 Loyalists at a minimum left the United States by 1784: 46,000 to Canada, 8000-10,000 to Great Britain and the rest to the Caribbean. 5,090 whites and 8,385 blacks went to Florida, but almost all moved on after it was returned to Spain in 1784: 421 whites and 2,561 blacks returned to the States.. The greater part of Loyalist emigration to Canada went to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. There were at least two waves of American immigration shortly after the Revolution to what is now Ontario, then Upper Canada. The first wave were the wartime Loyalists, who in the early 1780s, went to the southern and eastern parts of the Niagara Peninsula. (Others went to the Eastern Townships in Quebec.) The emigrants to Ontario numbered approximately 6,600, not counting the Native American Iroquois. Small numbers of dedicated \\"Tories\\" continued to arrive in Upper Canada during the 1780s either as individual families or in small groups from the Mid-Atlantic States. In the second wave, 30,000 Americans, attracted by promises of land and low taxes in exchange for swearing allegiance to the King, went in the 1790s to the western Niagara Peninsula. Referring to this later group of land- seeking immigrants, Canadian historian Fred Landon concludes that, \\"Western Ontario received far more land-seekers than Loyalists.\\" Fred Landon, Western Ontario and the American frontier (1941) p 280. However, the first wave, the dedicated Loyalist soldiers and families who came shortly after the Revolution, had a much greater influence on the political and social development of Ontario. As to the Loyalists who went to England, their story was sometimes not as happy as they had no doubt dreamed. \\"Transplanted Americans were treated as Americans, not former or new Britons,\\" and, \\"Some wealthy Loyalists chose exile in England, though they knew Loyalists were not welcome there.\\" As to the Loyalists who remained within the United States, Loyalists were a minority in every state and in most communities. This differentiated them from the assertive, vocal, white pro-Confederate majorities in the South after the Civil War, who proudly proclaimed their Confederate heritage. After the Revolution, Loyalists and their descendants, prudently, rarely drew attention to themselves. An example of some who did is the Tiffany family, originally of Connecticut, who donated the diary of a Loyalist ancestor to the Library of Congress in 2000. The diary indicated that in fact the Patriot hero Nathan Hale was captured by Robert Rogers and his Loyalists, a narrative not known before. Allen, p. 175 Remaining in the United States after the Revolution, or leaving and later returning, were not options for some of the Loyalists. Those who had fought for, or supported, the King sometimes rejected the new republic. The figure of a minimum of 62,000 Loyalist emigrants is given above. Another, higher, estimate is given in an American work dated 2010, which states that about one hundred thousand Loyalists were evacuated, most of them to Canada.Allen, p. 333 The numbers of those who left, and who stayed away, are debatable. For more information on this topic, see Loyalist (American Revolution), United Empire Loyalist, and Expulsion of the Loyalists. In Canada, land was sometimes allotted according to what regiment Loyalists had fought in. Thus, the King's Royal Regiment of New York, Butler's Rangers, Jessup's Corps, the King's Rangers and Joseph Brant's Iroquois got land in what is now Ontario; part of de Lancey's brigade, the Pennsylvania Loyalists, the King's American Dragoons, the New Jersey Volunteers, the Royal Fencible Americans, the Orange Rangers and others were given land in what is now New Brunswick. Other Loyalists settled in Nova Scotia and Quebec.D.G.G. Kerr, ed., A Historical Atlas of Canada ( Thomas Nelson and Sons, 1966), pp. 36-37 The defeated Tories of the Revolution became the United Empire Loyalists of Canada, the first large-scale group of English- speaking immigrants to many parts of that country, and one which did much to shape Canadian institutions and the Canadian character. Loyalists became leaders in the new English-speaking Canadian colonies. John Graves Simcoe, commander of the Queen's Rangers, became the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada (Ontario), and the city of Brantford, Ontario is named for the Loyalist Indian leader Joseph Brant. There is a bust of John Butler of Butler's Rangers at the Valiants Memorial in Ottawa. The pro-Loyalist tradition in Canada has been summed up by an American historian: \\"Many Canadians believe that their nation's traditional devotion to law and civility, the very essence of being a Canadian, traces back to being loyal, as in Loyalist.\\" Allen, p. 333 This Canadian self-image is reflected in the British North America Act, (1867), the founding Canadian constitutional document, which defines the aims of the new Dominion as \\"peace, order and good government\\"--contrast with \\"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\\" 8-10,000 Loyalists went to England, including hundreds of former slaves and Anglican clergy.Keith A. Sandiford. Measuring the Moment: Strategies of Protest in Eighteenth-century Afro-English Writing (Susquehanna University Press, 1988), p 24. Eventually about 25% returned over the following decades. Popular culture By the time of the Civil War, American popular hostility to the Loyalists was fading, to be replaced by a vague memory of a few malcontents who for some reason could not accept the Revolution. Yet Loyalists appear in American popular culture. In Stephen Vincent Benet's short story \\"The Devil and Daniel Webster\\", Webster in his quarrel with the devil demands \\"an American jury\\", and gets one containing the Loyalist officer Walter Butler. In the book and film Drums Along the Mohawk, Loyalists are shown looting and burning with their Indian allies. The Disney television series The Swamp Fox (about the Patriot leader Francis Marion) showed Loyalists as cowardly guns-for-hire and was condemned by the Canadian House of Commons. The 1985 Al Pacino film Revolution depicts a rich Loyalist family named the McConnahays, whose youthful daughter falls for Pacino and the Patriot cause. The film The Patriot has a British character, Tavington, based on Banastre Tarleton. In history, Tarleton's men were mostly Loyalists. In the film, one, Captain Wilkins, is given a chance to declare his British allegiance at the beginning of the film, and is seen helping Cornwallis to the end. The novel Oliver Wiswell, by the American historical novelist Kenneth Roberts, tells the whole story of the Revolution from the Loyalist side. Roberts did not portray his Loyalist hero as eventually seeing the error of his ways and returning to the American fold. Instead, the book depicts Oliver Wiswell from his new home in Canada (which he calls \\"land of liberty\\") as still being hostile to the revolution and its leaders. Another American historical novelist, Bruce Lancaster, also depicted Loyalists, although from a more conventional condemnatory point of view. Two novels at least deal with the story of the black Loyalists. One is Washington and Caesar by Christian Cameron, which tells the story of a black Loyalist fighting in the British forces. The Canadian novel The Book of Negroes, by Lawrence Hill, depicts an enslaved black woman who helps the British and escapes with their help.

The HPP model is a fundamental lattice gas automaton for the simulation of gases and liquids. It was a precursor to the lattice Boltzmann methods. From lattice gas automata, it is possible to derive the macroscopic Navier-Stokes equations.Succi, section 2.3 describes the process Interest in lattice gas automaton methods levelled off in the early 1990s, due to rising interest in the lattice Boltzmann methods.Succi, section 2.6  History  The HPP model was first introduced in papers published in 1973 and 1976 by Hardy, Pomeau and de Pazzis, whose initials give the model its name. The model can be used as a simple model for both the movement of gases and fluid.Gershenfeld, pp. 103  Model  Visual examples of the four rules governing the HPP Model.In this model the lattice takes the form of a two- dimensional square grid, with particles capable of moving to any of the four adjacent grid points which share a common edge, and particles cannot move diagonally. This means each grid point can only have one of sixteen possible interactions. * Particles exist only on the grid points, never on the edges or surface of the lattice. * Each particle has an associated direction (from one grid point to another immediately adjacent grid point). * Each lattice grid cell can only contain a maximum of one particle for each direction, i.e., contain a total of between zero and four particles. The following rules also govern the model: # A single particle moves in a fixed direction until it experiences a collision. # Two particles experiencing a head-on collision are deflected perpendicularly. # Two particles experience a collision which isn't head-on simply pass through each other and continue in the same direction. # Optionally, when a particles collides with the edges of a lattice it can rebound. The HPP models follows a two-stage update process. = Collision Step = In this step the above rules, 2., 3. and 4. are checked and applied if any collisions have occurred. This results in head-on collision particles changing direction, pass-through collisions continuing unchanged, or non-colliding particles simple remaining the same. = Transport Step = The second step consists of each particle moving one lattice step in the direction they are currently travelling, which could have been changed by the above Collision Step.  Shortcomings  The model is badly flawed, as momentum is always conserved in both the horizontal and vertical lanes. No energy is ever removed from the model, either by collisions or movement, so it will continue indefinitely. The HPP model lacked rotational invariance, which made the model highly anisotropic. This means for example, that the vortices produced by the HPP model are square-shaped.Succi, footnote p. 22 Notes References * (Chapter 2 on Lattice gas Cellular Automata) * Computational fluid dynamics ","title":"HPP model"},{"id":"36486340","text":"Roskilde Mansion (Danish: Det Gule Palæ i Roskilde), also known as Roskilde Palace and as the Yellow Mansion (Danish: Det Gule Palæ), is a former royal Baroque mansion in central Roskilde, Denmark. Located just east of Roskilde Cathedral, it now houses both an exhibition venue for contemporary art and the office and official residence of the Bishop of Roskilde. History Roskilde Mansion's courtyard in the late 18th century Roskilde Mansion replaced a bishop's palace which had stood at the site since the Middle Ages. Commissioned by King Christian VI, the new building was constructed to provide a residence for the royal family when they passed through the city or attended royal funerals and other ceremonies in Roskilde Cathedral. Lauritz de Thurah who had recently been engaged as royal master builder, was charged with its design in 1733 and the palace was completed in 1736. Roskilde Mansion in 1948 During the English siege of Copenhagen in 1807, the mansion served as headquarters of general Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington. Later in the century, it provided a venue for the so-called Assembly of the Estates (Danish: Stænderforsamlingerne for øerne), a key event leading up to the adoption of the Danish constitution in 1849. Architecture Built in the Baroque style, in yellow-washed masonry and with red tile roofs, the four- winged complex consists of a two-storey main wing, two one-storey lateral wings and a curved gate wing opening to the Stændertorvet. The four wings are connected by curving galleries. Facing the courtyard, the facade of the main wing has pilasters and a median risalit tipped by a triangular pediment decorated with the royal coat of arms. Dating from the 13th century, the Gate of Absalon which connects the mansion to the apse of Roskilde Cathedral, is the only surviving part of the former bishop's palace.

On February 14, 2012, Fat Mike revealed to Rolling Stone that NOFX was going to begin recording their twelfth studio album in April and added, \\"I've got 12 songs, but I don't have a name for it and only a few of the songs are finished. We're demo-ing it right now.\\" On April 12, he posted a message on his Twitter page saying that the band was back in the studio with Bill Stevenson, who produced Wolves in Wolves' Clothing and Coaster. The recording process of Self Entitled was finished in two-and-a-half weeks and it was eventually announced that NOFX would release the album internationally on September 10, 2012 and in the United States on the following day.

He plays Gaelic football with his local club Termon and also, formerly, for the Donegal county team. Educated at St Eunan's College in Letterkenny, he was his county's number one goalkeeper in the past, though Paul Durcan had something to say about that. Boyle has also played soccer for Finn Harps in the League of Ireland. Playing career =College= Boyle studied Sports Science and Health at Dublin City University (DCU). Boyle won the Sigerson Cup twice in 2010 and 2012 with the DCU GAA team. He was goalkeeper on both occasions, on the team that beat UCC in the 2010 final and the team that beat Maynooth in the 2012 final. The Higher Education GAA later barred him for playing for his college due to a new rule it introduced, prompting the team manager to consider a boycott. =Club= Despite being a goalkeeper, Boyle was Termon's top scorer with four points in an away fixture against Aodh Ruadh at Fr Tierney Park in 2012. Termon defeated Aodh Ruadh by a total of five points, a score of 0–13 to 0–8. Boyle's performance led to media comparisons with Dublin goalkeeper Stephen Cluxton, who would regularly do likewise for his team, including scoring the winning point in the 2011 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final. Later that year, Boyle won the Donegal Intermediate Football Championship, again against Aodh Ruadh. He also played for Donegal Boston, winning the North-East Men's Senior Football Championship in 2015. =Inter- county= Boyle was a member of the Donegal squad that won the 2007 National Football League. He played in the first team for periods in 2005 and 2009. Rivalling Paul Durcan for a place in the Donegal team, Boyle appeared at half- time in a 2009 All-Ireland qualifier after Durcan fouled Clare player Gary Brennan and conceded a penalty. Boyle retained his starting place for the games against Galway at Markievicz Park and Cork at Croke Park. Boyle was named on the bench for the 2012 Ulster Senior Football Championship final against Down, although he later claimed to have picked up 43 points playing golf at Slieve Russell in Cavan. He was also on the bench for the 2012 All- Ireland Senior Football Championship Final against Mayo. A noted penalty saver, he was named on the \\"Future Champions 2012\\" football team. In 2014, Boyle sustained a cruciate injury. This left him lacking match fitness in 2015 when the chance to play for Donegal presented itself following Durcan's transfer to Dubai. He made a substitute appearance for Durcan in the second round of 2015 National Football League fixtures against Dublin at Croke Park. He also started the league games against Tyrone and Mayo, as well as the NFL semi-final against Cork. Ahead of Donegal's 2015 Ulster semi-final, Boyle left the panel to travel to Boston for the summer. He was \\"not fit\\" for the 2016 championship, leaving the goalkeeping position vacant for Mark Anthony McGinley and Peter Boyle. McGinley was selected ahead of Peter Boyle.

Afflicted animals may be visibly deformed at birth and unable to stand, or seemingly normal for the first 4 to 6 weeks of their lives. The name derives from the limbs of afflicted animals being thin, elongated, and \\"spider-like\\".  Symptoms Symptoms have been observed on fetal lambs as early as by the completion of the second gestational trimester.Developmental progression of the Spider Lamb Syndrome, by A.M. Oberbauer, N.E. East, R. Pool, J.D. Rowe, and R.H. BonDurant; in Small Ruminant Research; Volume 18, Issue 2, October 1995, Pages 179-184 Under normal production circumstances, the lambs usually do not survive past the neonatal period. For this reason, the disease is considered semi-lethal. The disease typically affects the musculo-skeletal system. The clinical signs can include: skeletal abnormalities, twisted or humped spines, facial defects, bent legs, abnormally long legs, flat ribs, and underdeveloped muscles. Due to these symptoms, lambs cannot stand to nurse. Spider lamb syndrome is untreatable, and in almost all cases, the lambs must be euthanized. Causes Spider lamb syndrome is caused by a mutation to the gene for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), on ovine chromosome 6. FGFR3 is in the tyrosine kinase receptor family and its function is to restrict the proliferation of cartilage at the growth plates of the long bones: regulating ossification (the conversion of cartilage into bone), limiting skeletal elongation, and thereby ensuring that the limbs are the right length.

Considered an underage prodigy, he was reborn after Jim McGuinness took over as manager of Donegal and became regarded as \\"the poster boy for the new Donegal\\". He emigrated to Abu Dhabi in 2013 after collecting one All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and two Ulster Senior Football Championships. Playing career Bradley made his debut for Donegal in the National Football League in 2005 when Brian McEniff was in charge. He transferred to Boston that summer to play for the Donegal club. Brian McIver brought him back into the fold for the 2007 National Football League campaign when Donegal won the title. He continued his involvement with the team in 2008. Bradley was involved in the early part of 2009 and scored a goal in the final when Donegal won the 2009 Dr McKenna Cup. However, becoming increasingly disillusioned, Bradley left again to pursue his career in Boston in 2009. Jim McGuinness telephoned him upon his appointment as Donegal manager in 2010 — Bradley would later say, “I talked to Jim once and after that conversation he had it drummed into my head. If I hadn't have come back after that phonecall I'd have been better just to give up football”. McGuinness would later write in his autobiography Until Victory Always: A Memoir: \\"Ryan ran the roads seven days a week. He went out running when every muscle in his body was screaming for rest. Usually he put up eight or ten kilometres in the morning so he could burn fat. And he went from fifteen and a half stone to thirteen stone six\\". Bradley made his first Ulster Senior Football Championship start against Antrim in May 2011. He scored two points during the game and The Sunday Game gave him their man-of-the-match award. TV pundit Pat Spillane controversially claimed Bradley was \\"the best of a bad bunch\\". McGuinness reacted furiously, calling Spillane's comments “way over the top”. In July 2011, Bradley became the first man from Buncrana to help Donegal to an Ulster title. He scored a point in the final against Derry. He won the Ulster title again the following season, scoring a point in the final for the second consecutive year, this time against Down. He later played in the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final as Donegal defeated Mayo. Donegal won. Against Down in the 2013 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship he was concussed and received hospital treatment. In August 2013, he announced he was transferring to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. Personal life Bradley is a plasterer by trade. He is a past pupil of Crana College. He is married to Claire Sheerin, a cousin of Donegal teammate Michael Murphy. He is not fond of the media spotlight.

Plot Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) accidentally offends Cassandra July (Kate Hudson), her dance instructor at the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts (NYADA) in New York City, who begins to push Rachel as much as she can. Rachel also befriends upperclassman Brody Weston (Dean Geyer), who helps her adjust to life in the dorm. Rachel later confronts Cassandra about her bullying attitude towards her. To affirm her superiority to Rachel, Cassandra performs a mashup of Lady Gaga's \\"Americano\\" with Jennifer Lopez's \\"Dance Again\\". In Lima, Ohio, glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) reunites with the returning members of New Directions—Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale), Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz), Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss), Sugar Motta (Vanessa Lengies), and Joe Hart (Samuel Larsen)—who have become popular after winning Nationals. He announces that Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams (Alex Newell) has transferred to William McKinley High School to join New Directions. Tina, Brittany, Blaine and Wade decide to compete to see who's going to be \\"The New Rachel\\" and perform Carly Rae Jepsen's \\"Call Me Maybe\\" for Artie, who has been asked to choose the winner. He eventually chooses Blaine. McKinley graduate Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) visits cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) to meet her baby daughter, Robin, and is introduced to Sue's new protegé and head cheerleader Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin), who mocks him for not yet being in college. New Directions holds auditions to select new members for the club. A student who only identifies himself as Jake (Jacob Artist) performs The Fray's \\"Never Say Never\\", but becomes angry when he's not allowed to finish the song and storms off. The next candidate, Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist), performs Billy Joel's \\"New York State of Mind\\", the same song Rachel performs in a NYADA class, having just seen Carmen Tibideaux (Whoopi Goldberg) cut the first freshman to sing from the program for failing to impress her. Rachel elicits a \\"nice\\" from Tibideaux and impresses Brody, who later compliments her and helps her deal with the strangeness of New York and pressure of NYADA. Marley is welcomed into New Directions, but is disappointed when she hears them making fun of an obese lunch lady (Trisha Rae Stahl), whom she reveals is her mother. Sam and New Directions later apologize for their behavior, and their actions motivate Kitty to deem them unpopular once more and slushie Marley and Unique. Blaine invites Marley to sing lead at the club's next rehearsal. Blaine performs Imagine Dragons' \\"It's Time\\" to encourage Kurt to go to New York and follow his dreams. Kurt soon does, and his father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) drives him to the airport, where they share a heartfelt goodbye. Will learns that Jake is actually Noah \\"Puck\\" Puckerman's half-brother. He invites Jake to join New Directions, seeing that it helped Puck. Will also explains that he interrupted Jake's performance because he had already seen that Jake was good, but Jake refuses, unwilling to let go of his anger and saying that he is nothing like his half-brother. Rachel and Kurt reunite in New York, and Kurt suggests they rent a small apartment and move in together, and Marley and New Directions perform Adele's \\"Chasing Pavements\\" as Jake looks on.

In comparison with 2011's third-season premiere episode, the cast's opening-week sales totaled a lower sum (149,000); however, only five songs were released that week, so the average download sale total was slightly higher (30,000 in 2011 vs. 26,000 in 2012). While song sales for the Glee premiere weeks of the third and fourth seasons are comparable, both heavily trail that of 2010's second-season premiere episode, the cast's five first-week singles totaled 409,000 in sales, led by \\"Empire State of Mind\\" (106,461).

Glee version debuted at number 95 with 41,000 copies sold, and was the only one of the six singles released to chart. In Canada, \\"It's Time\\" was also the only single from the episode to chart on the Canadian Hot 100, and debuted at number 87, behind the Imagine Dragons original, which debuted the same week at number 69. The Glee cast added to one of the Billboard Hot 100's most prominent records: \\"It's Time\\" is its 204th song to appear on the chart, which was launched the week of August 4, 1958. Lil Wayne and Elvis Presley are tied for the second most Billboard Hot 100 appearances at 108.

It can occur as the result of heredity, accident, or the constant rubbing or wiping of the nose, commonly referred to as the allergic salute. Occurrence In addition to cases caused by heredity, physical injury, the transverse nasal crease is common in children and adults with chronic nasal allergies. People with allergies often use their hands to remove mucus from a runny nose or rub an itchy nose. As the hand slides upward, the tip of the nose is pressed up, thus creating the crease. Appearance The appearance of the line depends on skin pigmentation. On lighter-skinned people, the transverse nasal crease is lighter in color than the surrounding skin, and may appear white. This is due to hypopigmentation resulting from the low level of melanin present in the damaged skin. In darker-skinned people, the line may appear darker than the surrounding skin.

This was perhaps the first use of the word caucus to mean a meeting of members of a movement or political party to agree on a common position. The Boston Caucus was established in around 1719 by the popular physician and merchant Elisha Cooke, Jr. It quickly grew as a powerful political force in the area but its later activities are what associate it most with Samuel Adams and the run up to American Independence. Adams became an influential leader of the caucus in the 1750s and used the club in the 1760s and 1770s to help gain him political leeway. The group developed a nefarious, rebellious reputation, meeting in taverns, and plotting. The Boston Caucus and Samuel Adams were reputed to have had significant influence in 1773 with the events associated with the Boston Tea Party. Early years No written records survive of the early years of the caucus before 1740, but there is strong evidence to suggest that it was established around 1719 by the popular physician and merchant Elisha Cooke, Jr. Cooke was one of the richest men in the province, with an estate valued at his death in 1737 at £63,000. He was a heavy drinker, and the owner of the Goat Tavern on King Street. Another early member of the Caucus was Deacon Adams, father of Samuel Adams, a wealthy businessman who became an eminent figure in New England politics. The goals of the caucus were to protect the interests of the lower and middle classes in Boston, and to champion popular programs. Members of the Caucus included the leadership of the \\"popular party\\", also known as the \\"whigs\\" or \\"patriots\\", and the caucus had growing influence in Boston as it defined issues, promoted political views and challenged the authority of the crown. Although providing representation for the common people, the Caucus in some ways subverted the democratic process by setting the agenda for the Boston Town Meetings in advance, and through concerted action largely predetermining the results. According to Peter Oliver, the last chief justice of Massachusetts before the revolution, the caucus spent huge amounts of money on liquor to win elections in the 1720s. Cooke seems to also have had much influence in the marked relaxation in liquor licensing in the 1720s, which was popular with large numbers of voters. The historian G.B. Warden said that Elisha Cooke Jr. \\"contributed more than anyone else to the public life of colonial Boston.\\" Meeting structure John Adams, second cousin of Samuel Adams and later President of the U.S., described the caucus meetings in 1763 The Rev. William Gordon, in his History of the Independence of the United States of America (London, 1784), said: John Adams, at the time a country lawyer from Braintree, described the way in which the caucus worked in 1763. He said that at the meetings, \\"...selectmen, assessors, collectors, fire-wards and representatives are regularly chosen before they are chosen in the town ... there they smoke tobacco till you cannot see from one end of the garret to the other\\". Adams said that after coming to a decision, \\"They send committees to wait on the merchants' club.\\" This implies that the leading businessmen of the city still ultimately made the decisions, while listening to the views of the Caucus and taking into consideration the popular support that the Caucus could muster. The technique of making decisions like this in smoke-filled rooms before the public democratic process started was to have a long history in U.S. politics. The Caucus set the model for modern political machine politics in which the inner circle would select the candidates and ensure election through buying drinks for the working class voters. Samuel Adams era Samuel Adams, a leading member of the caucus from the 1750s Samuel Adams, whose father had been one of the founders of the caucus, became an influential leader of the caucus in the 1750s. Adams also became part of the Sons of Liberty, a mass movement of mostly working class men that could be used in street protests to support the goals of the Boston leaders. opposed to British rule. The caucus remained true to its principles of supporting the rights of the common man to political and economic freedom. However, in 1763 members of the court party gave a less flattering view of what they called \\"the Junto\\", saying that the members of the caucus were involved only to gain personal advantage, and that they opposed the government for this reason. Some said that Samuel Adams used the Caucus to make himself \\"Dictator\\" of Boston. This slur originated with loyalists who hated Adams and could not believe that common people - \\"the mob\\" - could act in their own interests without guidance from Adams. From 1751 the caucus collaborated with a \\"Merchant's Club\\", a \\"select group of shipowners and wholesalers\\", to \\"protest the oppressive tactics of royal customs officials\\". Three more Caucus Clubs were formed in the 1760s, for the South End, North End and Middle, in addition to the original club. Sam Adams was a member of all of them. These clubs complemented the Loyal Nine and Sons of Liberty patriot organizations, but various other clubs also had political goals, notably the Freemasons' lodge of St. Andrews. The North End caucus seems to have been launched in 1767, although the first records are from 1772. This caucus first met in the Salutation Tavern and later in the Green Dragon Tavern. Paul Revere was a member. It is at the Green Dragon Tavern that Adams and the Caucus were said to have conspired to hatch the Boston Tea Party plot of 1773.

He is the chief investment officer for The Gates Foundation and Bill Gates' fortune, through Cascade Investment. He assumed the role in 1994. Early life and education Larson was born in Sacramento, California in October, 1959. He was raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico and spent his summers in North Dakota. Larson attended Valley High School in Albuquerque. He graduated from high school in two years and was recruited to West Point, the Coast Guard Academy and the Merchant Marine Academy. He was also accepted at the University of Washington and Claremont McKenna College. Larson was only 16 when he graduated high school and could not attend the Coast Guard Academy until he was 18. He decided to attend Claremont McKenna and graduated in three years with a degree in economics. Larson subsequently earned an MBA from the University of Chicago (which Bill Gates' son currently attends) at the age of 21. Career After receiving his MBA from the University of Chicago, Larson went to work for ARCO doing mergers and acquisitions. After a few years, Larson moved to Boston to work for Putnam Investments managing bond funds. After two years, Larson left Putnam to run his own fund. =Cascade Investment= While trying to buy a Chicago-based money management firm, Larson received a call from a head hunter to work for Bill Gates. The head hunter had heard of Larson from a few investors in Tacoma, Washington. In 1994, Larson and his wife moved to Seattle. Larson called the investment shop Cascade Investment because the generic name would allow him to operate in the market without drawing attention. Larson has and continues to operate under the radar with the exception of a rare interview with Fortune in 1999. When Larson started at Cascade, informally known as BGI (Bill Gates Investments), he was the only employee. In 1996, he later hired Alan Heuberger, a fellow graduate of Claremont McKenna College. Larson originally managed $11.5 billion of the Gates fortune and foundation but that has swelled tremendously over the years as Gates sells his Microsoft stock. Although an actual statement isn't released, it's believed that Larson manages well over $80 billion year to date. This number includes the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gates's personal wealth. Cascade is a diversified investment shop, although there is an emphasis on real estate private equity managed by the subsidiary, Los Arboles Management. Larson was a student of Professor Jerry St. Dennis while at Claremont McKenna College. Larson convinced St. Dennis to come out of retirement in order to act as an advisor to Larson. Before teaching at Claremont McKenna College, St. Dennis was Assistant Secretary to the Treasury under Ronald Reagan and was Chairman and CEO of California Federal Bank. =Other ventures= Larson is a regular attendant of the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference. He is Chairman of the Board of Directors at Western Asset and has been a member of the Board of Directors at Teledesic, Pan American Silver, Ecolab, Hamilton Lane, FoodTrader.com, Republic Services and AutoNation.

It connects the Cologne–Frankfurt high-speed rail line with Wiesbaden Central Station. The double-track line was built from the late 1990s as a new line. It was completed in December 2002. With a scheduled train service of two long-distance pairs each day on the section between Kinzenberg and Breckenheim junctions, it is one of the least- congested sections of railway in Germany. This section is not used by either regional passenger or freight traffic. The total cost of construction of the line amounted to €279 million. It was originally estimated to cost €29 million less. The additional costs were assumed by Deutsche Bahn. Route Separation from the high-speed line at Breckenheim junction, south of Breckenheim Tunnel. While the new line runs towards Frankfurt (central tracks), the track from Wiesbaden joins on the left and the line to Wiesbaden sepaprates on the right. Nearby to the south are to the two portals of the Wandersmann North Tunnel. Line near the 7.0 km mark on the line The line branches off the Cologne–Frankfurt high-speed line at Breckenheim junction near the Wiesbaden Cross autobahn junction on the A 3 autobahn, which it passes under in Wandersmann North Tunnel. After running through a short section of trough (with concrete walls) near Wallau it runs through the Wandersmann South Tunnel, passing under the A 66 autobahn. It resurfaces west of the Wallau autobahn junction. The route runs parallel to the A 66 through Nordenstadt on the northern edge of Lucius D. Clay Kaserne (a U.S. base formerly called the Wiesbaden Army Airfield) to Erbenheim. At the 10 kilometre mark from Breckenheim junction, it connects with the Ländches Railway (Ländchesbahn), which it follows to Wiesbaden Central Station and reaches at the 13 kilometre mark. History The connection from Wiesbaden to the new line was planned under various options for the Cologne-Rhine/Main high-speed line under discussion during the 1980s. Only in the case of a purely left-bank route (to the west of the Rhine) was a link not provided to Wiesbaden. The Hessian state government considered that a remote link to the Wiesbaden would be inadequate. The forecasts in the 1990s were that more than 1,000 passengers a day would use high-speed services to Wiesbaden. The (ultimately realised) right bank route between Cologne and Frankfurt along the A 3 initially provided for a connection from Niedernhausen to Wiesbaden Central Station. This required the construction of an 11 kilometre long tunnel between the northern edge of the city and the station. This option was originally analysed with a maximum grade of 2.5 percent, which was subsequently increased to 4 percent. The city of Wiesbaden suggested that the continuation of the route to Frankfurt be abandoned and that all trains run via Wiesbaden Central Station and from there run on existing (partially upgraded) lines. Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) examined numerous route options between the Niedernhausen-Wiesbaden Central Station route and a corridor between Niedernhausen and Wiesbaden Cross (along the A 3). Primary emphasis was placed on a grade of up to 4.0 percent. A variant developed at this time envisaged, for example, the building of a station between Bierstadt and Erbenheim, east of the settlement of Hainerberg. South of Erbenheim station there would be a branch line. Geological studies showed significant geological problems with a route running under Bierstadt and the Salzbach valley. DB then distanced itself from such variations, looking for geologically favourable solutions, even if they required trains to reverse in the central station. From a variety of route options, three were examined closely: *A variant of an option that DB had examined before with the high- speed line running from the north along the A 3 with a branch line running from the vicinity of Wiesbaden Cross to Wiesbaden. It would reach Wiesbaden Central Station by running along the A 66 and the Ländches Railway between Wiesbaden and Niedernhausen. *The so-called \\"Best Wiesbaden Solution\\" (Beste Wiesbadener Lösung) was left as the most favourable of the options that would provide a new line through Wiesbaden Central Station. From Wiesbaden Central Station, the route would follow the A 66 to Wiesbaden's Cross and from there run to Frankfurt Airport. While parts of the railway would be in cuttings, it would run through the city of Wiesbaden in a continuous tunnel. *The so-called \\"Hainerberg variant\\" envisaged a route parallel with the B 455 with a new station near Hainerberg. South of this point the line would branch towards Wiesbaden and Frankfurt. This variant was assessed as having a large potential for urban development in eastern Wiesbaden, but would have reduced traffic to Wiesbaden Central Station. In a summit meeting between DB, the state of Hesse and the Wiesbaden city council, the Hainerberg variant was discarded, while DB agreed to develop the other two variants equally and bring them into the regional planning process. As part of the process the \\"Best Wiesbaden Solution\\" was ultimately rejected due to the unacceptable time and effort required for its planning and for architectural and geological reasons. There was a threat from ground water at the edge of the Taunus that had not previously been seen with this intensity on a high-speed line in Germany. An expert hired by the city confirmed the DB results. The city of Wiesbaden finally developed a so-called \\"optimised spatial route\\" (optimierte Raumordnungstrasse) with a triangle: in addition to the new line a branch would run to the southwest with provision for a connecting link to the southeast, which would be included in the regional planning and planning approval processes. While DB wanted to use this link to enhance regional passenger rail transport, the city of Wiesbaden wanted the link to be used by long-distance rail services. =Planning= In the planning approval process, the line was part of Section 33.2 (connection with the high-speed line) and 34.1/34.2 (Wiesbaden Central Station area). At the demand of the U.S. military, part of the route was shifted 15 metres to the north (away from the Wiesbaden Army Airfield). In addition, at the end of 1996, the U.S. military required that the control tower be able to stop the train traffic next to the airport. An agreement at the beginning of 1977 envisaged that the control tower would control a signal controlling the approach of trains. During the planning, the construction of a previously agreed by-pass road around Wallau was considered for inclusion in the project. DBBauProjekt, which had already been commissioned to design the new line, was also contracted to design the road and to implement the first stage of the bypass. Initially it was planned to build the line as a single-track and at a later stage to build the second track. In mid-1998, it was announced that the connecting curve would be constructed with two tracks and opened at the same time as the Cologne- Rhine/Main high-speed line. With the commissioning of the high-speed line there would initially be a regular interval Intercity-Express (ICE) service from Wiesbaden and later, if there was a sufficient volume of traffic, two services. The estimated additional cost of the second track amounted to 12 million Deutschmarks (about €6 million). In the 1990s, two pairs of trains per hour were planned for the connection to Wiesbaden. From mid-1998 only one hourly train pair was planned. In the course of the route planning, a connecting curve between Erbenheim and Wiesbaden East, which would have run along the route of the freight rail line abandoned in 1997 and would have allowed direct operations between the high-speed line and Mainz Central Station (bypassing Wiesbaden Central Station), was not realised. The reason was low estimated traffic demand. =Construction= The track was built as part of the section C contract, covering the central section of the new line. The part between Erbenheim and Wiesbaden was assigned to the southern section of the new line. =Operations= ICE 3 near Wiesbaden-Erbenheim, running towards Wiesbaden The number of trains running on the Breckenheim–Wiesbaden line has been reduced in several stages since the opening of the line. At the beginning of operations in December 2002, eight pairs of ICE services per day ran between Wiesbaden and Mainz, in the 2005 timetable it was reduced to five and from June 2006 to four. From December 2007, three pairs of trains running via Wiesbaden remained. DB runs said that the low passenger numbers was the reason for the cuts. In autumn 2008, the ICE services running between Cologne and Wiesbaden were, according to Deutsche Bahn, occupied by an average of 88 passengers. They were thus to be the least loaded ICE trains operated by DB. The trains carry more than 440 seats. Since the timetable change in December 2008, two pairs of service remain, running only from Monday to Friday. The loading of ICE services terminating in Wiesbaden ranges from 3 to 20 percent. =Future= Given the low utilisation of the line and the desirability of improving access from Wiesbaden to Frankfurt Airport, the city of Wiesbaden is seeking the construction of the proposed southern curve at Wallau. This two kilometre link would branch off near the Hofheim-Wallau autobahn junction to the southeast and connect to the high-speed line running south. The travel time between Wiesbaden and Frankfurt Airport would be reduced from 28–39 minutes today to about 15 minutes. The costs were calculated in the 1990s to be about 100 million marks and they were estimated in 2007 to cost €65 million. Engineering The tracks are partly on slab track (Rheda-Dywidag system). The two turnouts at Breckenheim junction are each 138 m long and weigh 500 tons, allowing branching speeds of up to 160 km/h (4,000 m radius). The switch blades are 54 metres long. It is the largest turnout on the whole Cologne-Rhine/Main high-speed line project. The speed limit on the line is 40 km/h at the exit from the Wiesbaden Central Station and shortly later (at the 13.1 km mark) climbs to 100 km/h. At Wiesbaden Kinzenberg junction (km 9.9) the speed over the junction is 155–160 km/h. The line is equipped from the 4.9 km mark with the Linienzugbeeinflussung train protection system.

Ram represented India at the 2012 Summer Olympics, London. He achieved the B qualification standard (2:18:00) by clocking a time of 2:16:59 at the 2012 Mumbai Marathon, which is also his best performance in this event. He is the second Indian athlete ever to be qualified for the marathon event of the Olympics. Before Yadav, Shivnath Singh was the Indian athlete who participated in the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. Ram is a havildar in the Indian Army. Personal life Ram is from Babiyan village, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. His father was a fruit-seller in Mumbai. Ram married Urmila Yadav in 2001 and they have three children, Amit, Ankit and Alok. He is a havildar in the Indian Army and currently posted in Hyderabad’s Artillery Centre. He trains at Pune-based Army Sports Institute. Olympic qualification Ram missed the B qualification standard of 2:18:00 in 2008 during the 2009 Mumbai Marathon for Beijing Olympics' marathon event by few seconds, and thus did not qualify. He completed his race in 2:18:23 and finished 10th in the final standings. But president of the Indian Olympic Association, Suresh Kalmadi, mistakenly announced that Ram had qualified for the Olympics, which was later corrected by the organisers. For the 2012 Summer Olympics, Ram underwent training for 45 days at a high-altitude training centre in Coonoor town of Nilgiris district, Tamil Nadu. 2012 Mumbai Marathon was the first event he took part in after his training, the same event where he failed to claim an Olympic berth four years ago. Ram took 2:16:59 to finish the race, well under the B qualification standard of 2:18:00. He finished 12th overall in the final standings. 2:16:59 is also the personal best of Ram. Ram is only the second Indian athlete ever to be qualified for the marathon event of the Olympics. Shivnath Singh of Bihar was the first Indian athlete to participate in the Olympics marathon. He participated twice in the Olympic Games—1976 and 1980. Olympic Games At the London 2012 Olympic Games, he completed the marathon with a time of 2:30:06 which placed him 78th in the final rankings.

He was arrested by the Vietnamese government on charges of tax evasion on 27 December 2012, convicted on 2 October 2013, and sentenced to 30 months in prison. The arrest was condemned by international human rights organizations and the US government. 2007-2011 activism and arrests On 8 March 2007, Lê Quốc Quân was detained after he returned to Vietnam from a fellowship with the U.S.-based National Endowment for Democracy. The detention led U.S. presidential candidate John McCain and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to write to Vietnam in protest and Amnesty International to name him a prisoner of conscience. During Quan's detention, U.S. Ambassador Michael Marine invited his wife to tea at the U.S. Embassy, but was unable to meet her when police blocked her from entering. Vietnamese authorities accused Quan of \\"activities to overthrow the people's government\\", but did not formally charge him. He was released three months later. Quan is a Roman Catholic and an advocate for religious freedom. He participated in a march of Catholics on 29 January 2008 at Saint Joseph Cathedral in Hanoi, protesting the government's occupation of land also claimed by the church. He later told reporters that he had been beaten by guards during the march. On 5 April 2011, he was re- arrested along with Pham Hong Son when attempting to observe the trial of democracy activist Cu Huy Ha Vu. The pair were held for \\"causing public disorder\\". Son's wife Vu Thu Ha stated that Son had been assaulted by police with batons prior to his arrest. After the U.S. government and human rights groups called for the men's release, both were released without charge on 13 April. Tax evasion conviction In July 2012, Independent Catholic News reported that he had been threatened by state media for his activism on behalf of his diocese. Police raided his office and attempted to take him to a police station, but were blocked by Quan's supporters. On 19 August 2012, Le Quoc Quan was attacked by police near his home in Hanoi. He was returning to his home when he was attacked, at around 8pm. He was injured in the head, back and knee and required hospitalization. The attack prompted US-based Human Rights Watch to call for a full investigation He had been harassed before and stated his belief that this attack was connected to the police. On 18 December 2012, Le Quoc Quan published a piece on his blog that was critical of the government's cling to power. The article entitled \\"Constitution or a contract for electricity and water service?\\" criticized the Vietnam National Assembly for an article that states that the Communist Party should have a de facto leading role in Vietnam. In the article, which was published by BBC, Quan writes, \\"I may be put in prison. Nevertheless, my belief in human beings, the importance of the issue and the consciousness of a citizen urged me to write.\\" Nine days after the publication, on December 27, 2012, when Quan was dropping off his daughter at school, he was arrested by the police. The police searched his office, confiscated documents and told his family that he will be charged under Article 161 of the Criminal Code relating to tax evasion. Quan was then detained incommunicado in Hoa Lo Prison with no access to his lawyer and family. Three days after his detention, he has started a hunger strike in prison, which lasted for at least four days. On 2 October 2013, Quan was sentenced to 30 months in prison for tax evasion and given a $59,000 fine. Supporters of Quan attempted to march on the courthouse but were stopped by police. Quan's lawyer stated that his client intends to appeal. BBC News reported that the US government had been negotiating on Quan's behalf, and that \\"authorities may have been seeking a compromise so that his sentence was not long enough to upset Washington but sufficient to keep him behind bars.\\" The US Embassy issued a statement following the sentence calling on the government to release Quan and other political prisoners. Amnesty International called the charges \\"trumped-up\\" and called for his immediate release. In 2013, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention condemned Le Quoc Quan’s detention as violating his right to freedom of expression and his right to a fair trial . It found that Le Quoc Quan had been targeted for his work as an activist and as a blogger and called for his immediate release or for his conviction to be reviewed by an independent court. It also recommended that Viet Nam pay damages to Le Quoc Quan for his arbitrary detention. On 18 February 2014, the Court of Appeal in Hanoi upheld Le Quoc Quan’s conviction. The decision of the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was not taken into account. On 5 September 2014, the Media Legal Defence Initiative filed another petition to the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, on behalf of a coalition of other NGOs, including Lawyers’ Rights Watch Canada, Lawyers for Lawyers, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Reporters Without Borders, English PEN, Avocats Sans Frontières Network, Article 19, National Endowment for Democracy and the World Movement for Democracy, and the Center for International Law Philippines. Le Quoc Quan was released on 27 June 2015. He has served the full sentence of 30 months, without any deduction. Prior to his release, a broad coalition of NGO's urged the Government of Viet Nam to respect his human rights, to reinstate his license to work as a lawyer, and to grant him reparation for the arbitrary detention he suffered. Upon his release, he was asked in an interview if he will continue his human rights works. He answered: ‘Of course! I will continue with doing what I believe is good for the Nation. I will be working for a better Viet Nam. Progress for our Nation is my goal. Yes, I am afraid that I will be arrested again. I try to overcome the fear. I will go ahead, because I believe it is good for the people of Viet Nam. I will not go abroad, I prefer to stay in Viet Nam. It is worth it, even if I devote my life'. International support Following the 2007 arrest, U.S. presidential candidate John McCain and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expressed their support in freeing Le Quoc Quan. Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience. Following the 2012 arrest, Human Rights Watch have called for these \\"politically motivated charges to be dropped\\". The organization also pointed out the similarity of using \\"tax evasion charges\\" to frame political dissidents such as in the case of Dieu Cay. The World Organization Against Torture likewise called for the charges to be dropped and for his immediate release. In 2013, Le Quoc Quan, together with Tran Huynh Duy Thuc and Nguyen Hoang Quoc Hung, was awarded Vietnam Human Rights Award from Vietnam Human Rights Network. The EU recognizes Le Quoc Quan as a Prisoner of Concern. On 18 February 2014, it formally expressed its concern over the judgment of the Appeal Court. A broad coalition of NGO's has repeatedly requested that Le Quoc Quan be released. On 16 September 2014, L4L delivered an oral statement at the UN Human Rights Council, to once again demand attention for the situation of Le Quoc Quan.

Career Robinson, an African American, started his college education at LeMoyne-Owen College and graduated from Memphis State University now the University of Memphis, in 1979 with summa cum laude honors and a B.S. degree in chemistry. He received a Ph.D. in nuclear chemistry from Washington University in St. Louis in 1984. In that same year, he joined the research staff of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), where he was a research scientist and served as a group leader, of the neutron activation analysis facility. He accepted a position as a visiting professor at FAMU in January 1995, and left ORNL two years later to accept a permanent faculty position at FAMU. At FAMU, Robinson became director of the university's Environmental Sciences Institute. In addition to conducting research on environmental chemistry of coastal ecosystems, he had a leadership role in establishing new B.S. and Ph.D. degree programs. In 2003, he became FAMU provost and vice president for academic affairs, serving until 2005. In 2007 he became the university's chief operating officer and vice president for research, and served for several weeks as the school's interim president. In May 2010, he left that position to become Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Management in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In November 2011 he returned to FAMU as a professor and special assistant, and in March 2012 he was named provost and vice president for academic affairs. In July 2012, the FAMU Board of Trustees appointed Robinson to serve as the university's interim president, replacing James H. Ammons. On September 15, 2016, he was named to a third stint as interim university president following the approval of a separation agreement with the 11th president, Elmira Mangum. On November 30, 2017, Robinson was named the 12th President of Florida A&M; University. Research One of Robinson's primary research interests is environmental chemistry, including the detection of trace elements in environmental matrices by nuclear methods. In 1991, while at ORNL, Robinson was a participant in a well-publicized investigation into the cause of the death of 19th-century U.S. President Zachary Taylor. When Taylor died rather suddenly in 1850, the cause of his death was listed as gastroenteritis, but some historians thought he might have been poisoned with arsenic. His descendants gave permission for his remains to be exhumed in order to allow analysis of tiny samples of his hair and fingernails. With ORNL's High Flux Isotope Reactor as a neutron source, Robinson and colleagues used neutron activation analysis to measure arsenic levels in the samples. The analysis led to a finding that Taylor did not die from arsenic poisoning, as arsenic was not detected in the samples, indicating that arsenic concentrations were many times lower than would be expected in arsenic poisoning.

Born in Tsang, he is best known as a biographer and compiler of the Life of Milarepa and The Collections of Songs of Milarepa, both classics of Tibetan literature. Life Tsangnyön Heruka was a nyönpa () or \\"religious madman\\", whose eccentric ways of life were considered signs of spiritual realization. He was ordained as a śrāmaṇera, but at the age of 21 renounced his vows and trained under various tantric yogis from different schools. His first teacher was Shara Rabjampa Sanggye Sengge (1427–1470) who conveyed to him the \\"Aural Transmissions\\" (snyan brgyud) of the Kagyu tradition.Biography of Tsangnyön Heruka Tsangnyön spent years in solitary retreat on Tsari in southern Tibet, which is the major sacred mountain retreat for the Kagyu school. He also studied the tantras in Pelkhor Chode Monastery in Gyantse for three years. After Heruka left the monastery, he became a wandering yogi for the rest of his life, never staying in one place permanently. He was known to keep his hair long, carry a khaṭvāṅga and drink from a kapala. When local villagers saw his body covered in human ashes and blood with his hair adorned by human fingers and toes, they gave him the name 'Nyönpa' (madman). He later used the name Trantung Gyelpo () \\"King of the Blood-drinkers\\", \\"blood drinker\\" being the Tibetan name for the deity Heruka. These eccentric ways were influenced by an Indian sect of yogis called Kapalikas or \\"skull-bearers\\", who practiced austerities as well as dressing in loincloths and human ashes and carrying symbols of the dakinis such as bone ornaments and skulls. Many monks questioned his behavior and way of dress but Tsangnyön was known to strongly defend his unconventional practice through rigorous argument and accurate quotations from scriptures. He became a famous teacher and gathered numerous followers, he was also a composer of religious songs. Tsangnyön was very influential with various Tibetan political leaders and he used his influence to mediate between warring factions. In 1488 while staying at the pilgrimage site Lapchi Snow Mountain, Tsangnyön completed the Life of Milarepa, a biography of the Tibetan poet. It was one of the first texts that was produced through woodblock printing in Tibet and it quickly became a widely circulated text. Tsangnyön's main goal seems to have been the promotion of the teachings of the early Kagyu masters. In 1504, Ratna Malla, the king of Kantipur, invited Tsangnyön Heruka to Nepal to restore the famous stupa known as Swayambhunath. Tsangnyön traveled to Nepal and completed the renovation within three months. In 1505, he compiled a biography and a song collection of Marpa Lotsawa. He also completed his major life work, which was the collection of the aural transmissions of the Kagyu tradition. He died at the age of fifty- five in 1507 at Rechung-Puk north of the Yarlung Valley. Legacy After his death three of his disciples wrote biographies of him: Gotsangrepa, Lhatsun Rinchen Namgyel and Ngodrub Pembar. Kuntu Zangmo, Tsangnyön’s female companion, oversaw the printing of his songs, writings and a biography of him.

They may extend beyond a country's territory to give the country more time to respond to possibly hostile aircraft. The concept of an ADIZ is not defined in any international treaty and is not regulated by any international body. The first ADIZ was established by the United States on December 27, 1950, shortly after President Truman had proclaimed a national emergency during the Korean War.R. P. Anand, Origin and Development of the Law of the Sea (Martinus Nijhoff, 1983) p171 About 20 countries and regions now have such zones including Canada, India, Japan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Norway and the United Kingdom, People's Republic of China, South Korea, Taiwan, United States, Sweden, Iceland and more. Russia and North Korea have unofficial ADIZs as well.Jane Perlez (27 November 2013), China Explains Handling of B-52 Flight as Tensions Escalate The New York Times Usually such zones only cover undisputed territory, do not apply to foreign aircraft not intending to enter territorial airspace, and do not overlap.Rick Gladstone and Matthew L. Wald (27 November 2013), China’s Move Puts Airspace in Spotlight The New York Times Air defense zones should not be confused with flight information regions (FIRs), which are used to manage air traffic. India India established ADIZs in the mid-twentieth century. Among other rules, notifications are required 10 minutes prior to entry. In case of delay, 45 or more minutes and a new Air Defence Clearance (ADC) numbers are required.https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/graduate_fellows_pb_no.1.pdf India has demarcated six ADIZ near its territory. These zones have been declared over the international border with Pakistan, the international border with Nepal, over the Line of Actual Control with China, along the eastern borders with Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar and two in the southern region of India.http://glcmumbai.com/lawreview/volume9/03JoshuaAbhayPatnigere.pdf Military enforcement of ADIZs is solely the responsibility of the IAF and the task is executed through a chain of radars as well as a C3I organisation. Aircraft and surface-to-air missiles of the IAF, with elements of the Army and the Navy participating in their specific areas, where required, carry out interceptions. Civil aviation authorities, in conjunction with the IAF, also assist in this process by ensuring regulatory and control measures, such as assignment of Air Defence Clearance (ADC) numbers to aircraft entering or operating in Indian air space and by confirming the ADC of the incoming traffic, where necessary. Bangladesh Bangladesh maintains an ADIZ that extends over the adjoining sea to the south as delineated by the following coordinates: (1) 210744.80N891356.50E (2) 181554.12N892147.56E (3) 164328.74N892554.37E (4) 201306.30N920007.60E (5) 200332.00N915031.80E (6) 175234.06N901504.66E All flights of aircraft, civil/military, Bangladeshi or foreign, originating within the ADIZ and those penetrating the Bangladesh ADIZ shall obtain prior permission and Air Defence Clearance (ADC). Among other procedures, aircraft flying without a valid ADC number or failing to comply with any restriction or deviating from flight plan will be liable to interception by Bangladesh Air Force.http://www.caab.gov.bd/aip/sup/aipsup01-18.pdf  United States and Canada  ADIZ boundaries for the United States and Canada as of 2010. The United States and Canada jointly operate an ADIZ that encompasses their sovereign airspace in North America. The United States maintains two zones in North America — the Contiguous U.S. ADIZ and Alaska ADIZ — and two more overseas — Hawaii ADIZ and Guam ADIZ. Canada operates two other sections of the North American ADIZ, one off the Pacific coast of British Columbia and another that encompasses the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and its Atlantic provinces. Under US law and policy, the zone applies only to commercial aircraft intending to enter US airspace. An air defense command and control structure was developed in 1950, creating five air defense identification zones around North America. If radio interrogation failed to identify an aircraft in the ADIZ, the Air Force launched interceptor aircraft to identify the intruder visually. The air defense system reached its peak in 1962. With the deployment of the SS-6 ICBM in the USSR, strategic threats shifted overwhelmingly to ICBM attacks, and bomber intrusions were considered to be less of a threat. It does apply to aircraft passing through the zone to other countries.  Japan  Air defense identification zones over Japan (blue), South Korea (green), and China (pink) Japan has an ADIZ that covers most of its exclusive economic zone. Japan's ADIZ was created by the United States Armed Forces (USAF) after World War II, with the western border at 123° degrees east. This resulted in only the eastern half of Yonaguni Island being part of Japan's ADIZ and the western half being part of Taiwan's ADIZ. On 25 June 2010, Japan extended its ADIZ around Yonaguni 22 km westwards to align with its territorial waters. This led to overlapping with sections of Taiwan's ADIZ. However, Taiwanese foreign affairs officials said that it does not make any difference, as an understanding has been reached between the two parties on how to handle it. According to China Network Television on 24 November 2013, China and Russia do not recognize Japan's ADIZ.  Taiwan  Taiwan has an ADIZ that covers most of Taiwan Strait, part of East China Sea and adjacent airspace, most ADIZ of Taiwan is built on its exclusive economic zone. Taiwan's ADIZ was designed and created by the United States Armed Forces (USAF) after World War II. South Korea South Korea operates a zone that covers most but not all of its claimed airspace. It does not cover some remote spots. The zone was established in 1951, during the Korean War, by the United States Air Force to block communist forces. In 2013, in response to the establishment of a Chinese zone that covers disputed territory, the South Korean government considered expanding their zone to include islands of Marado and Hongdo, and Ieodo, a submerged rock within the overlapping exclusive economic zones of South Korea and China. When part of or the whole flight route of an aircraft enter the KADIZ area, it is required to send a specific flight plan one hour prior to departure. Civilian aircraft with regular routes should submit a repetitive flight plan to the air traffic control. There is no need for legal action when an aircraft enters KADIZ as long as the aircraft follows its flight plan reported to the South Korean government. If there is a change in the flight passage or an approach without prior notification, the South Korean air force has the right to immediately identify or track down the aircraft and be prepared for interception. However, military force such as shooting down the plane cannot be exercised. On December 8, 2013, the Defense Ministry of Republic of Korea announced the expansion of the Korea Air Defense Identification Zone (KADIZ). After South Korea expanded KADIZ and China established their ADIZ in 2013, certain areas overlap with each other. The KADIZ boundary area at northwest Jeju Island (about 2,300 km2) overlaps with the East Chinese Sea. Also, South Korea's domestic aircraft cannot avoid entering China's ADIZ near Ieodo even if the flight's purpose is for rescue or searching distressed/missing aircraft. More tension is increasing as the area of South Korea, China and Japan's FIR reiterate with each other.\\"Air defense zones of China, S. Korea overlap\\", Yonhap news, November 24, 2013 These sensitive issues are expected to bring military or diplomatic conflict between the three countries. By 29 August, Chinese military jets had entered the KADIZ area without notice five times in 2018.  China  On November 23, 2013 the People's Republic of China (PRC) established a zone in the East China Sea. The announcement of the zone drew attention and international criticism, including from most of China's East and Southeast Asian neighbors such as Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, and as well as from the European Union and the United States. These responses focused on two related aspects: while hitherto zones had only covered territory that was undisputed at the time of their establishment, China's ADIZ in the East China Sea covers the Japanese- controlled Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands in the PRC) and also includes Socotra Rock, which is claimed by South Korea. Secondly, China's zone overlaps with other countries' ADIZ and imposes requirements on both civilian and military aircraft regardless of destination. It has been claimed that the Senkaku Islands dispute predates Japan's 1969 establishment of its ADIZ over the islands. Japan holds that there is no record of the People's Republic of China announcing a claim to the Senkaku islands in 1969 or before.Bill Gertz (15 September 2010), Inside the Ring Washington Times The PRC, on the other hand, holds that the Diaoyu Island has historically been part of China. The Chinese government has noted that any established international limits for defining and enforcing an ADIZ are not clearly defined. Chuck Hagel, the American Secretary of Defense, while acknowledging there is nothing new or unique in establishing an ADIZ, criticized the manner in which China had acted as \\"unilateral\\", \\"immediate\\" and \\"without consultation\\". American Vice- President Joe Biden made no public mention of the Chinese ADIZ following his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, although elsewhere expressed concern that the Chinese move had escalated tensions in the region. Tokyo brought the matter to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency to promote the safe and orderly development of international civil aviation throughout the world. Australia, Britain and the United States supported Japan's proposal, but China reacted sharply against the proposal. As of December 4, 2013 some 55 airlines in 19 countries and three regions have complied with China's ADIZ rules. After initial indication by South Korea's Ministry of Transport that South Korean airlines would not recognize the Chinese ADIZ, South Korea's Asiana Airline and Korean Air later chose to abide by the ADIZ. Japan said its airlines would not recognize the zone. In 2014, China's Foreign Ministry dismissed reports that they were considering a similar ADIZ over the South China Sea, as the countries in ASEAN were no threat.

(2004)Frank, L. D.; Andersen, M. A.; and Schmid, T.L. (2004). \\"Obesity relationships with community design, physical activity, and time spent in cars\\". American Journal of Preventive Medicine. 27, 2, 87–96. report that obesity around Atlanta, as measured by body mass index (BMI), is associated positively with time spent in cars and negatively with mixed land-use (such as incorporating Light Rail transit) and with walking. There is also research which suggests that utilizing Light Rail transit increases physical activity even compared to riding the bus. Users of public transit who do not use trains or light rail walk an additional six minutes compared with non-users, whereas those who use trains or light rail walk an additional 4.5 minutes, for a total of 10.5 extra minutes per day.Edwards, R. D. (2008). \\"Public transit, obesity, and medical costs: Assessing the magnitudes\\". Preventative Medicine, 46, 14–21. Additionally, MacDonald, et al. (2010)MacDonald, J. M., Stokes, R. J., Cohen, D. A., Kofner, A., and Ridgeway, G. K. (2010). \\"The effect of light rail transit on body mass index and physical activity\\". American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 39(2), 105–112. used data collected pre and post light rail development in Charlotte, North Carolina to determine that residents who commuted via light rail had 81% reduced odds of becoming obese. Moreover, bicycle access to light rail transit can increase physical activity, as people will generally bicycle three to five miles to transit, as opposed the one‐half mile distance the average person is willing to walk. Research also shows that less time spent driving results in a reduced stress level, resulting in a higher quality of life. Though there are significant potential public health benefits due to light rail, some studies have indicated the discrepancy between the enormous costs of building and operating light rail and its significant, but certainly smaller potential benefit to public health costs (estimated at $12.6 million savings over 9 years).Stokes, R. J.; MacDonald, J. and Ridgeway, G. (2008). \\"Estimating the effects of light rail transit on health care costs\\". Health & Place, 14(1), 45–58. As such costs and benefits are being weighed it is also essential to recognize the potentially negative health impacts, including injury hazards that accompany light rail. It is equally if not more important that such hazards be closely monitored and mitigated to ensure public health and safety. Air quality One electric light rail train produces nearly 99 percent less carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions per mile than one automobile does. A report from the American Public Transit Association (APTA) presents evidence that each person riding light rail transit versus driving an automobile for one year reduces hydrocarbon emission by nine pounds, nitrogen oxide emissions by five pounds and carbon monoxide emissions by 62.5 pounds.American Public Transit Association. (1993) Transit Fact Book, Washington, D.C. 104. Furthermore, bicycle access on light rail and bicycle lockers at park and rides remain a priority for RTD, which further contributes to cleaner air. A large proportion of air pollution is generated in the first few miles of an auto trip when the engine is cold. From an air quality standpoint, biking to stations at the start or end of a workday trip eliminates \\"cold‐start\\" vehicle emissions associated with driving to a park and ride. Negative consequences Some negative consequences are increases in noise level, loss of wetlands, adverse impacts to historic sites, gentrification, and risk of displacement.

Retrieved 06 30, 2012, from Environmental Review Toolkit: http://www.environment.fhwa.dot.gov/strmlng/casestudies/co.asp A 2011 study done by Human Impact Partners in Minnesota showed that light rail and RTD expansion in their communities had at least one if not all of these negative outcomes: higher rate of residential and business displacement, increase in housing values causing fewer vacancies and a decrease in affordable housing, and displacement of existing residents—especially low income residents.

Retrieved 06 30, 2012, from Policy Link: http://www.healthimpactproject.org/news/project/body/Healthy- Corridor-summary-FINAL.pdf The study showed that there was a disproportionate impact on people of color and people with lower socio-economic status compared to white people and people with high socio-economic status. Moreover, the risk of displacement can also lead to negative health outcomes such as infectious disease, chronic disease, stress, and impeded child development due to lack of sense of belonging and association to a particular community. Injury hazards Automobile injury hazards arise due to existing light rails. Coifman et al. (1997) Coifman, Benjamin; and Bertini, Robert L.(1997). \\"Median Light Rail Crossing: Accident Causation And Countermeasures\\". UC Berkeley: California Partners for Advanced Transit and Highways (PATH). Retrieved from: http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7438m8wc concluded that drivers engage in undesirable behaviors or actions, which are not considered hazardous, are rather legal to do. Driver's actions such as disobedience to traffic rules and signs, as well as failure to perceive due to poor stimulus observability are factors of hazard causation. Such factors include the misinterpretation of a light rail vehicle horn as another automobile's horn, and the driver's expectation of a normal intersection when in actuality the intersection includes a light rail crossing. Pedestrians are also at risk of being injured by light rail vehicles, either by crossing rail tracks or ignoring traffic signs, especially where there is limited walkability to safely access the rail stop area. Currently, there is minimal literature available for pedestrian and automobile safety measures and traffic safety concerns (Brown et al., 2011).Brown, B. B. and Werner, C. M. (2011). \\"The residents' benefits and concerns before and after a new rail stop: Do residents get what they expect?\\" Environment and Behavior 43(6), 789-808. Further investigation and data collection is needed to prevent these injury hazards. Access and mobility Chronic diseases are highly prevalent among individuals who do not have convenient food access. Many residents of food deserts rely on convenience stores, liquor stores, gas stations and drug stores to provide food items (Colorado Health Foundation, 2009). Colorado Health Foundation. (2009). Food Access in Colorado. 1-7. Retrieved from http://www.coloradohealth.org/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&ItemID;=4057 Light rail could contribute to lower rates of obesity and other nutrition- related chronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, by increasing the likelihood that residents in food deserts can easily travel to neighborhoods with cheaper and healthier food options. Research also indicates improved access contributes to improved health outcomes. Similarly, having convenient and affordable light rail access could enable residents with little access to healthcare facilities the opportunity to travel to other neighborhoods with more healthcare providers. According to the Centers for Disease Control, individuals from low socioeconomic status are more likely than average to use transit as their principle mode for commuting. However, they are often displaced disproportionately with light rail expansion. The most effective predictors of health, according to the National Institutes of Health, are income, poverty, population density, access to public transportation, access to affordable housing, environmental pollution (air and water). While public transportation is a necessary component of improving health of individuals of low socioeconomic status, policies must be changed to make the benefits equal with the challenges. Economic growth and development According to RTD (2012),Regional Transportation District of Denver. (2012). 2010 FasTracks Quality of Life Detailed Report. 1-86. when new development occurs near stations, it increases the likelihood that residents and workers will choose transit as their transportation mode. This reduces the growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and auto trips on a constrained roadway system while, at the same time, accommodating new growth. Furthermore, according to The Housing + Transportation Affordability Index (2012), The Housing + Transportation Affordability Index. True Affordability and Location Efficiency. Retrieved June 29th, 2012 from: http://htaindex.cnt.org/#2 housing near transit provides residents with an opportunity to decrease their combined household and transportation costs. Residents in locations with close proximity to transit, shorter distances to major employment, and lower vehicle ownership have lower monthly transportation costs. The effect of displacement on communities, especially low socioeconomic communities (SES), cannot be underestimated. Public transportation is an important resource for low SES communities. However, with light rail developments, there is national precedent for the displacement and tremendous negative impacts upon low SES communities. Both residential and business displacement can have significant negative impacts on health of already vulnerable communities. As housing values rise and fewer vacancies exist, the displacement of existing residents, especially low income residents, begins to happen. This places a disproportionate impact on people of color compared with white. This displacement can have multiple negative impacts, including negative health outcomes including infectious disease, chronic disease, stress and impeded child development. RTD would be wise to look to Minnesota to find how their Transit Oriented Development addressed the economic and public health needs of the communities affected by the placement of light rail. For example, using restorative investment to ensure that low SES communities are not unduly burdened and pushed aside as light rail tends to gentrify neighborhoods beyond the reach of the poor; opening access to opportunity by rethinking zoning policies, de-concentrating subsidized housing, re-thinking school boundaries; and growing a community together to ensure there are healthy environments for all –not just those who are passing through on light rail or moving to newly renovated areas.

This particular type of sari originated in Bengal and is known for depictions of mythological scenes on the pallu of the sari. It was mainly produced in Murshidabad but presently Bishnupur and its surrounding places of West Bengal is the only place where authentic Baluchuri saris are produced. It takes approximately one week to produce one such sari. The Baluchari Sari has been granted the status of geographical indication in India. History In the history of textiles in Bengal, Baluchari or Baluchuri came much after muslin. Two hundred years ago Baluchari was practiced in a small village called Baluchar in Murshidabad district, from where it got its name. In the eighteenth century, Murshidkuli Khan, Nawab of Bengal patronized its rich weaving tradition and brought the craft of making this sari from Dhaka to the Baluchar village in Murshidabad and encouraged the industry to flourish. After a flood of the Ganga river and the subsequent submerging of the village, the industry moved to Bishnupur village in Bankura district. Baluchari Sari made of tassar silk and a thousand years old when the Jagat Malla king rule in Mallabhum. This flourishing trend later declined, especially during British rule, due to political and financial reasons. It became a dying craft as most of the weavers were compelled to give up the profession. Baluchar Sari In the first half of twentieth century, Subho Thakur, a famous artist, felt the need to recultivate the rich tradition of Baluchari craft. Though Bishnupur was always famous for its silk, he invited Akshay Kumar Das, a master weaver of Bishnupur, to his center to learn the technique of jacquard weaving. Sri Das then went back to Bishnupur and worked hard to weave Baluchari on their looms with the financial and moral support of Sri Hanuman Das Sarda of Silk Khadi Seva Mandal. Once Bishnupur was the capital of Malla dynasty and different kinds of crafts flourished during their period under the patronage of Malla kings. Temples made of terracotta bricks were one achievement of these rulers. A major influence of these temples can be seen in Baluchari sarees. Mythological stories taken from the walls of temples and woven on Baluchari sarees is a common feature in Bishnupur. Production process The production process of Baluchari or Baluchuri can be divided into several parts: Cultivation of cocoons: Since the discovery so many years ago that the fibre or filament composing the cocoon of the silkworm can be constructed into a beautiful and durable fabric, silkworms have been bred for the sole purpose of producing raw silk. Processing of yarns: To make the yarn soft, it is boiled in a solution of soda and soap and then dyed in acid colour, according to the requirement of the sari. The yarn is stretched from both the sides in opposite directions putting some force with both palms. This process is needed to make the yarn crisper. Motif making: Making of the motifs for 'pallavs' and other part of Baluchari is in itself an intricate process. The design is drawn on a graph paper, it is coloured and punching is done using cards. After punching, these cards are sewed in order and fixed in the jacquard machine. Weaving: After the jacquard loom has been introduced, the weaving of a Baluchari sari takes five to six days. Two weavers work on a shifting basis. Baluchari thus prepared becomes a sign of aristocracy, the attire of status. Maintenance of quality of Baluchari sari is taken care of precisely. The quality is checked from the stage of dying of the yarn to the packaging of the sari. Motifs: themes and variety Baluchori saree - Mahabharat motif showing the Pandavas marrying Draupadi. Baluchari saris, or locally called Baluchuri saris, today often have depictions from scenes of Mahabharat and Ramayana. During the Mughal and British eras, they had a square design in the pallu with paisley motifs in them, and depicted scenes from the lives of the Nawab of Bengal featuring women smoking hookahs, nawabs driving horse carriages, and even European officers of the East India Company. It would take two craftsmen working for almost a week to produce one sari. The main material used is silk and the sari is polished after weaving. While there isn’t a lot of variation in the method of weaving used today, balucharis can be broadly categorized based on the threads used in weaving the patterns: * Baluchari (resham): The simplest balucharis have resham threads in a single colour to weave the entire pattern * Baluchari (meenakari): These balucharis have threads in two or more colours with attractive meenakari work that further brightens the patterns * Swarnachari (baluchari in gold), also called Swarnachuri: They are the most gorgeous balucharis, woven with gold (swarna) or silver coloured threads (often with meenakari work in another colour) that illuminate the patterns to a much larger extent. Use These saris were mostly worn by women from upper class and Zamindar households in Bengal during festive occasions and weddings. Organic Baluchari With the changing times, the Baluchari sari has had a makeover and a touch of eco-friendliness in terms of the used yarns and colours. Cotton Kapas is spun with fibres of banana plants and bamboo shoots and the dyes are extracts of fruits, flowers, leaves, and vegetables such as pomegranate, jamun, neem fruits and leaves, basil leaves, turmeric, marigold flowers, mangoes and others. The organic baluchari cotton sarees were displayed in the sari fair organised by Rang Mahal, a forum of weavers from Nadia district in West Bengal. However, with the GI certification of Baluchari or Baluchuri sarees with reference to Bankura district of West Bengal in India, it is now not permitted to use the term Baluchari or Baluchuri for any other similar product based on cotton or any other material. Display and felicitation The Baluchari sari was one of the award winners for the main weaving styles amongst 34 National Awards for the years 2009 and 2010 presented by the Hon. President Pranab Mukherjee. The Baluchari sari of Bankura was showcased at the India International Trade Fair organised at New Delhi.

He was educated at Prince Alfred College. As a young man, Lipman was active in Jewish artistic circles, performing in and directing plays. He left Adelaide in March or April 1903 for Western Australia, initially for a matter of months, then more permanently, to manage his father's business interests in Coolgardie. In that prosperous gold- mining town Lipman was active in theatre, partly in connection with the local branch of the Australian Natives' Association. :His father was the most prominent businessman in the town, and perhaps the wealthiest; Judah Lipman ( – 7 July 1911), owner of the Cremorne, the Grand Hotel, the Brewery and much else beside. Judah's youngest brother Abraham, also known as Alfred, managed the Halfway House, then the Grand Hotel for brother Judah, died of pneumonia at Coolgardie in 1897. Judah was a son of Jonas Lipman (c. 1835 – 21 January 1880) and Hannah Lipman of Port Adelaide. Lipman left Western Australia in July 1905, announcing his intention of joining a troupe touring India. By 1909, he had returned to Adelaide, where he was involved as actor and director with an amateur theatre group, The Actors' Club. A noted performance was One Summers Day (Henry V. Esmond) held at the Unley Town Hall in July 1910 in aid of the St Paul's choir fund. This was followed in September by The Dilemma at the same venue. Following these two successes, The Players staged Charley's Aunt over two nights at the Theatre Royal in December and revived in June 1911 at the Unley Town Hall. In each of these Lipman was both stage director and leading man to packed houses and critical acclaim. By 1914, he had moved to Victoria, working as stage manager and director for the Comedy Theatre at the refurbished Daylight Pictures Co. building on the Lower Esplanade, St Kilda, adjacent the Palais de Danse. The first productions, changed weekly, were: The New Baby (Arthur Bourchier); Our Girls (H. J. Byron) and The Three Hats (aka Three Hats Slightly Mixed and similar), an adaptation of a farce by Alfred Hennequin. The Comedy Theatre, a summer favorite, did not survive beyond March 1915. In 1916 and 1917 Lipman made several buying trips to the United States, and reported on the rise of Broadway. He wrote Just Peggy while in the USA. signed the lead actress, Sara Allgood, having seen her perform on stage in J. Hartley Manners' comedy Peg o' My Heart, and filmed it in Sydney. His best known film is probably Mystery Island (1937). Some of his stage and film work is credited to his pseudonym, Rigby C. Tearle. Lipman was head of several Australian motion picture distribution and exhibition companies, particularly of British films, from the late 1910s to the early 1930s. In 1918, as head of Quality Features he picked up a film Damaged Goods on the theme of venereal disease. In 1920, when it was playing at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne, he was fined for showing the movie, judged as obscene. The same year he helped established the company United Shows Inc. Three years later he helped set up the Australian Releasing Corporation. and Australasian Films Ltd. He also represented British International Pictures Ltd from around 1929. Lipman managed to achieve a great deal of success in his lifetime through his many business and personal affiliations- at one point he was reported to have purchased the rights to Charlie Chaplin for £1,000,000.

Permanent change of station travel expenses Traditionally, the cost of transportation for a Navy officer and his family was initially paid for by the officer receiving the permanent change of station orders, and he would be reimbursed upon arrival for all expenses and pay en route. Lieutenant commander (United States) Joseph P. Fyffe changed this custom in 1870 when he was assigned to travel from New England to San Francisco in order to take a new assignment. Since he had no funds for travel, he walked. He strapped his dress sword to a small suitcase and began walking from New England to San Francisco, sending a telegram each night showing his progress and nightly accommodations. After five days on the road, his shoes gave out, and he sent this telegram: \\"30 August 1870.

It was established in 2009 through an Act passed by the State Legislature of Assam (Assam Act XXV of 2009) as a public university dedicated to the field of legal education. The admissions for first batch were made in 2011 which passed out in 2016. The first Vice-Chancellor of the University was Professor (Dr.) Gurjeet Singh, currently the University is managed by the newly appointed Vice Chancellor Professor (Dr.) J.S. Patil who succeeded Professor (Dr.) Vijender Kumar in 2016. The University is running efficiently with an effective administration and harmonious student-faculty rapport.  History  The North-Eastern region of India has traditionally been one of the underdeveloped and marginalized areas of the Indian nation. In 2009, despite the presence of a High Court for the eight ‘Seven Sister’ states, viz., Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura in Guwahati; the scenario of legal education in the area remained far from the potential of possible proliferation of excellence in the realm of legal profession. Thus, to fulfill the aspirations of the people, the Government of Assam decided to initiate and facilitate the establishment of a Law University in Assam. This led to the establishment of The National Law University and Judicial Academy(NLUJAA), Assam by the Government of Assam by way of passing the National Law School and Judicial Academy, Assam Act, 2009(Act No.XXV of 2009). This Act was later amended as the National Law University and Judicial Academy, Assam (Amendment) Act, 2011 (Act II of 2012), wherein the word ‘School’ was replaced by the word ‘University’.

The origin of these structures is currently unknown. Chondrites is found in marine sediments from the Cambrian period of the Paleozoic onwards. It is especially common in sediments that were deposited in reduced-oxygen environments. Morphology There are four recognized Chondrites ichnospecies, however, aberrant forms of unknown taxonomic affinity have been discovered. The fossils are made of infilled dendritic rootlike burrows. The branching angles are 30° to 40°, while a shaft diameter varies between 0.1 mm and 10 mm, remaining constant within a single system. Chondrites is classified as a fodinichnion. Occurrence First appearing during the Cambrian, Chondrites is still produced today. It is one of the most common ichnotaxa throughout the fossil record and is widely distributed in all types of marine sedimentary rocks, including sandstone, shale, limestone and marl that formed in environments ranging from subtidal shelves to the abyssal zone. The tracemaker has been able to tolerate highly variable redox conditions. For example, Chondrites is abundant almost to the exclusion of other ichnogenera in Posidonia Shale, formed from laminated, black, carbonaceous clay, deposited in an anoxic, reducing environment. In the oxic, extensively bioturbated units of Austin Chalk, the fossil is very common as well. Interpretation Though the characteristic burrows are still produced today (in deep-sea deposits), no organism has ever been observed inside them. Several theories exist regarding the origin of these structures. While some authors hypothesize Chondrites to be the product of an infaunal abyssal nematode, others propose it to be formed by a chemosymbiotic organism, pumping methane and hydrogen sulfide from the sediments. Another study suggests it to be a fecal storage structure. The ichnogenus is found both in anaerobic, organic-rich sediments and in oxic layers, where it is almost invariably the last in the bioturbation sequence, i.e., it was placed deep within the sediments, away from oxidizing surficial and interstitial water. These suggest the tracemaker's ability to tolerate oxygen deprivation very well. Therefore, Chondrites can be used as an indicator of anoxia in sediments.

Enciklopedija Slovenije, vol. 3. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga. was a Carinthian Slovene Roman Catholic priest, political figure, and ethnologist. Early life and education Ehrlich was born in the hamlet of Camporosso in Valcanale () in the town of Tarvisio, then part of the Duchy of Carinthia (now in Italy). He attended secondary school in Klagenfurt and then studied theology in Innsbruck (1897–1902) and in Rome (1903). He was ordained a priest in 1903 and also received a doctorate in Innsbruck that year. Work Ehrlich first served as a curate in Villach, and then as a cathedral curate in Klagenfurt (1903–1907), an episcopal secretary (1907–1910), and a professor of theology in Klagenfurt (1910–1919). He was a leading figure in Catholic education in Carinthia. After World War One, southern Carinthia became a contested region between the Austrian Republic and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes; because of his familiarity with the situation in the region and his ethnographic knowledge, Ehrlich was appointed to the Yugoslav delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. He continued his studies in ethnology and comparative religion at the Sorbonne and in Oxford in 1920 and 1921. In 1922 he became a full professor of comparative religion at the Faculty of Theology of the University of Ljubljana, a position that he held until his death. He wrote numerous books and articles about the religious customs of the Australian Aborigines and about various ethnological and theological issues. Ehrlich worked in various church organizations. He was a church representative for the Slovenian High School Students’ Union (), the Academic Union (), the Straža Catholic students’ club, and the Marian Congregation of Academics. He became the ideologue of the Straža club and edited the club’s magazine Straža v viharju (Sentinel in the Storm).Luthar, Oto. The Land Between: A History of Slovenia. Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang, p. 405. The club and its Straža magazine achieved notoriety for its admiration of fascism, as well as antisemitism, equating Jews with both western capitalist excesses and the Bolshevik revolution Second World War After the invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, on 24 November that year Ehrlich proposed a political program known as the Slovenian Issue () for an independent Slovenian state to the non-communist political parties; however, it was not accepted.Ehrlich, Lambert, Marija Vrečar, & Metod Benedik. 2002. Pariška mirovna konferenca in Slovenci 1919/20 (= Acta ecclesiastica Sloveniae 24). Ljubljana: Inštitut za zgodovino Cerkve pri Teološki fakulteti Univerze v Ljubljani, p. 666. Ehrlich was a staunch anti-communist and anti-Semite. During the war he campaigned against \\"Jewish Satanism\\" which he maintained was trying to get its hands on other people's national treasuries. On 1 April 1942Blumenwitz, Dieter. 2005. Okkupation und Revolution in Slowenien(1941-1946): Eine völkerrechtliche Untersuchung. Vienna: Böhlau, p. 85. he sent the Italian occupation authorities a memorandum in which he analyzed the current position of the Partisans and offered proposals for how to destroy them. In it, he suggested that the Italians arm the Slovenian police and that the Slovenians establish a semi-autonomous security service under Italian military supervision. He also suggested that the Italian authorities release innocent people held in prisons and camps, assist in rebuilding destroyed villages, and allow greater freedom of the press to promote anti-communist propaganda.Tomasevich, Jozo. 2001. War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941-1945: Occupation and Collaboration. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, p. 101. Ehrlich was assassinated by the communist Security and Intelligence Service () on 26 May 1942.Meier, Viktor. 1999. Yugoslavia: A History of Its Demise. Trans. Sabrina Ramet. London: Routledge, p. 56. He was shot in front of the soup kitchen on Shooting Range Street () in Ljubljana by Franc Stadler (a.k.a. Pepe) (1915–2000), who also assassinated Marko Natlačen and was named a Yugoslav People’s Hero.Traven, Terezija. \\"Stadler Franc - Pepe\\".

It connects the Syrian M45 and the Turkish D827 highways, between the cities of İskenderun and Idlib, and is known for its long lines of trucks and buses. The closest town on the Turkish side of the border is Reyhanlı in Hatay Province, and the closest towns on the Syrian side are ad-Dana and Atarib. The crossing is the site of a 6th-century triumphal arch. Archaeology There is a monumental Roman archway in Bab al- Hawa that was part of a city wall. There is a further complex of Byzantine architecture near the archway that has been largely destroyed and re-used in border construction. It features a church and another large rectangular building. Syrian Civil War In the ongoing Syrian Civil War, it was a frequent place of crossing for Syrians trying to reach the refugee camp in nearby Reyhanlı. Drivers complained in December 2011 that they had been stalled at the crossing for days after customs officials stopped allowing vehicles with Turkish registrations to enter Syria. The crossing is a major route for smuggling, particularly oil and gas, and during the conflict has seen a dramatic rise in weapons smuggling. On 19 July 2012, Syrian rebels from the Free Syrian Army seized the border and defaced images of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. On 22 July 2012, Turkish armed forces further restricted border crossings of their own nationals. In September 2012 foreign jihadists raised the Jihadist flag of al-Qaeda at the border post, leading to a confrontation with the Free Syrian Army. On February 11, 2013, a car bomb in a Syrian-registered minivan was detonated on the Turkish side of the crossing meters from the Cilvegözü customs office. Thirteen people—including 3 Turkish civilians—were killed, while 28 others were wounded and 19 vehicles were damaged. The Turkish government labeled the bombing a terrorist act, and said that Turkey's interior, justice and customs ministers would visit the area to help the investigation. On 7 December 2013, the Islamic Front took the crossing from the Free Syrian Army, and as of July 2014, they were manning the Syrian side with members of the Salafist militia Ahrar ash-Sham. Ahrar a-Sham maintained control when the Islamic Front dissolved in 2015, but established a civilian administration for the border crossing in April 2015. On 23 July 2017, hundreds of Ahrar al-Sham fighters withdrew with their equipment from the crossing and retreated to Turkey after the al-Qaeda-affiliated Tahrir al- Sham defeated Ahrar al-Sham in Idlib. As a result, the crossing was largely closed by Turkey, with the exception of exports of humanitarian aid and food from Turkey. On 26 July 26, HTS and Ahrar al-Sham reached an agreement that they would hand over the crossing to a civilian administration so that the flow of humanitarian aid could resume. However, HTS retained control of the towns, villages and roads around it, leaving them in a decisive position. The crossing re-opened on 18 October. In November 2017, civil officials operating the crossing reported that all revenue generated (estimated at $25 million a year in late 2016) goes to the local civil administration. On the 3 March 2020, the US envoy to Syria James Jeffrey, visited the border crossing and supported the Turkish presence in the Idlib Governorate.

It focuses on the glee club New Directions, at the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio. The show was created by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan, and features many cover versions of songs sung on-screen by the characters. Murphy is responsible for selecting all of the songs used, and strives to maintain a balance between show tunes and chart hits, as he wants there to be \\"something for everybody in every episode.\\" Once Murphy selects a song, rights are cleared with its publishers by music supervisor P.J. Bloom, and music producer Adam Anders rearranges it for the Glee cast. Numbers are pre-recorded by the cast, while choreographer Zach Woodlee constructs the accompanying dance moves, which are then taught to the cast and filmed. Studio recordings of tracks are then made. The process begins six to eight weeks before each episode is filmed, and can end as late as the day before filming begins.

The 1931 census was postponed to 1936 because of the Great Depression. The early censuses were unreliable and took several years to tabulate; the results were outdated by the time they were calculated. =Post-independence= There have been five censuses after the independence of Botswana, each occurring every ten years in the year ending in 1 (i.e. 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2011). The 1971 census was the first census in Botswana to use de facto enumeration; this method counts people based on how many people spent census night at a specific location. Previously, the citizens were counted based on their usual place of residence. The 2001 census was the first census in Botswana to comply with the SADC 2000 Census Project, the guidelines of which unify the demographic statistics in southern Africa.

Desalpar is 25 km away from Bhuj. This site is of modest dimensions,( by ) situated on the northern banks of once depredatory (erosive) stream, Bamu-Chela, an affluent of the Dhrud river. History The line of the walls, 2250 yards round and something of an oblong square in shape, though much decayed may be clearly traced. Inside is nothing but a heap of ruins, the remains of houses and temples. In I828, the villagers constantly turned up pieces of old vessels, ass coins, and occasional boxes of money. An old Mahadev temple was believed to hold snake-guarded treasured. On the bank of a small lake to the west of the fort, seven grave stones, palias, with peculiar designs but no writings, are said to have been raised in honour of seven claimants for the hand of Guntri the adopted sister of the seven Sands, possibly Vaghela Rajputs, once the rulers of the fort. It was from these seven Sands, probably early in the fourteenth century, that the Sammas captured the fort and made themselves masters of western Kutch. The story is that Mod and Mandi, two Samma outlaws from Sindh, by treachery gained possession of Vagham - Chavdagadh ten miles north of Kora near Lakhpat. Vagham Chavda, whom the Sammas killed, was a vassal of the seven Sands. They at first threatened punishment, but were appeased by the offer of a larger tribute and of one of the Samma brothers as hostage. Part of the tribute was paid in grass, and one year the Sammas, in each cart of grass, hid some armed men. As the carts passed through the city gate, the blind gatekeeper smelling something more than grass, said, \\"There is either flesh or pulse in the cart?\\". A spear driven into one cart cut the thigh of a Jat soldier. But he, uttering no sound of pain, as the spear was pulled out rubbed off the blood, and, in spite of the blind man's warning, the carts passed in. At night the armed men left the carts, fell on the garrison, seized the fort, and drove the seven Sands into Kathiawar. Excavation Archaeological Survey of India undertook excavation at this site during 1963. Architecture Desalpar had a massive stone fortification with a base of about , and height measuring from to . Several houses were built adjacent to fort wall inside the town and central part of the settlement had a structural complex with foundation offsets, massive walls and spacious rooms. Findings Regular Harappan pottery, a thin grey ware carefully potted and painted with lines of bluish green pigment were found at lower excavation levels, similar to that found at Mohenjodaro, which is commonly described as 'glazed ware'. Alongside the Harappan pottery, three scripts bearing seals were found. On each script the seal was made of a different material, one of steatite, one of copper and one of terracotta.

In May 1971, Radio Mogadishu announced a plot to overthrow the Siad Barre regime and the subsequent arrest of Deputy Chairman of the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party General Mohamed Caynaanshe and Defence Minister Lieutenant Colonel Salaad Gebeyre Kediye. Dheel was later arrested and implicated in the coup attempt. He was executed on 3 July 1972 along with Lieutenant Colonel Salaad Gabeyre Kediye and General Mohamed Ainanshe Guleid. The execution was widely seen as a dark chapter in Somali history given the fact that Dheel was not politically active when the coup attempt took place nor was he affiliated with his erstwhile colleagues.

It was built in 1911 as the villa of a wealthy mining businessman. Since 1997 it has been owned by the Leonhardt brothers (Leonhardt Group).  History  The villa was built in the years 1911–1913 in the Poppenwald forest not far from Stein Castle and near the river Zwickauer Mulde as a property for the major industrialist and mining businessman, Dr. Karl Georg Wolf. The plans for this art nouveau structure were drawn up by Munich architect (Baumeister), Emanuel von Seidl. The interior decor, some of which is still in its original state, was carried out by well known Munich artists. The luxury villa with its L-shaped floor plan is surrounded by 6 hectares of parkland. Here there are several well kept lawns and a wolf statue in red sandstone by a well, an artistic symbol of the name of the property. The well in front of the house from which it derives its name In 1934 the owner died and the estate became a communal property. After that, during the Nazi era the site acted as a youth hostel, a Reichsführer Interior School (Reichsführerinnenschule), a military hospital for officers and quarters for staff of the Wehrmacht. Fünf DeHoGA stars; details of the facility as at 2001; accessed on 1 June 2012 After the Second World War, the house was initially used for evacuees, until it became a district youth school for the Free German Youth on the foundation of the German Democratic Republic. Later pioneer leaders were trained here, who qualified as junior teachers (Unterstufenlehrer) by taking additional instruction in education. After the Wende the house remained empty for several years. In 1997 the brothers Uwe, Helge and Karl-Ludwig Leonhardt bought the villa as Gebrüder Leonhardt GbR from the town of Hartenstein. With an investment of 10 million Mark they had it converted into a hotel and nature park; it has also been used since as an example park (Musterpark) by the Free State of Saxony. On 1 March 1999 it opened as the Schlosshotel Wolfsbrunn. Between 1997 and its reopening as a hotel, the refurbishment and renovation work carried out included the renovation of the facade paintwork.
