He founded Firma Albert Collett and became one of the largest landowners in the valley of Namdalen in Nord-Tr√∏ndelag, Norway. Collett was born at Buskerud Manor at √Ömot in Modum, Norway. He was the youngest son of landowner John Collett (1807‚Äì1891), grandson of judge Peter Collett and grandnephew of Christian Ancher Collett. He was also the father of chemist and industrialist Emil Collett and physician Arthur Collett. He was originally a clerk in Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse. He is most associated with his take over the Salsbruket Agricultural Stakeholder Society (Salsbrukets Interessentselskab) at N√¶r√∏y in Nord-Tr√∏ndelag. Collett took over the operation which had interests in forestry and lumber production. At the same time, he bought several other properties in the area, in the then-municipalities of Kolvereid and Foldereid. In 1871, he founded Firma Albert Collett and turned it into a real estate management company. He became one of the largest landowners in the valley of Namdalen. The acquisition of Salsbruket secured hydropower from the Opl√∏elva river at Salsbruket and a good port at Opl√∏fjorden. He soon had large modern sawmills in full operation. The sawmill operation lasted until 1898. After his death in 1896, management of the company was taken over by his widow Nanna H√∏egh Collett (1854‚Äì1921), then from 1912 their sons Johan (b. 1874), Oscar (b. 1876) and Axel (b. 1880).

Biography Ashwell was born at Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. In 1843 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, but migrated to Caius College in 1845, being elected a foundation scholar there the following year. In 1847 he graduated BA as fifteenth wrangler, and in 1848 he received holy orders, and became curate of Speldhurst, Kent. In the following year he returned to Cambridge as curate of St. Mary the Less, in order that he might study theology under the direction of Professor Blunt. In 1851 he was appointed vice-principal of St. Mark's College, Chelsea, and in 1853, partly through the instrumentality of Canon Butler of Wantage, he was appointed by Bishop Wilberforce principal of the newly founded Oxford Diocesan Training College at Culham. Here he remained for several years, and, besides his work in the college, assisted the bishop in organising a system of diocesan inspection. In 1862 his health compelled him to retire to lighter work, and for two years he was minister of Holy Trinity Church, Conduit Street, Hanover Square; but in 1865 he returned to his old occupation, accepting the principalship of the Training College, Durham. The fame of his success at Durham led Bishop Durnford, an entire stranger to him, to offer him in 1870 the principalship of the Theological College, Chichester, with a canonry attached, and he also held for a short time the rectory of St. Martin's (1871‚Äì75), and that of St. Andrew's (1872-5), in that city. Canon Ashwell was active in literature. In 1864 Ashwell became editor of the Literary Churchman, which office he held for twelve years, when he became (1876) editor of the Church Quarterly Review, and a little while before his death he also resumed the editorship of the Literary Churchman. To both these periodicals he was a regular contributor. He was also a contributor to the third series of Tracts for the Christian Seasons; and he wrote occasionally for the Quarterly Review and the Monthly Packet. Ashwell was also in great request as a preacher in his own cathedral and elsewhere. He was, moreover, a frequent reader and speaker at church congresses, and an effective conductor of mission services. It is no wonder that his constitution was impaired by this excessive work, and that he succumbed to an attack of congestion of the lungs, which prematurely cut short a most active and useful life on 23 October 1879. A window and a lectern in Chichester Cathedral perpetuate his memory in a spot of which he had been a distinguished ornament. Ashwell achieved reputation as a writer, a preacher, and a teacher. Some of his periodical essays excited much attention. His articles upon Dr. Farrar's Life of Christ in the second number of the Church Quarterly Review, and upon the State of the Church in the July number of the Quarterly Review, 1874, excited much interest. His article on Samuel Wilberforce in the April number, 1874, of the same Review was the main cause of his being asked to write the bishop's life; and several of his educational articles attracted unusual attention. His longest consecutive work was the first volume of the Life of Bishop Wilberforce (1880). As a preacher Ashwell was extremely acceptable, especially among the more thoughtful and educated congregations. His little volume of printed sermons, entitled God in Nature, is full of striking and original ideas, expressed tersely and incisively, and evidently with a view to arrest or even force attention. As a trainer, first of future schoolmasters, and then of future clergy, Ashwell made his influence deeply felt. His clear, epigrammatic style was the very style to command the attention of young men. He was a very strict disciplinarian, and the kindest of friends and counsellors to all pupils who sought his aid in confidence, as many of them have testified to the present writer. Canon Ashwell was a staunch and very definite English churchman. Besides the writings already mentioned, he published 'The Schoolmaster's Studies' (1860), 'The Argument against Evening Communions' (1875), 'Lectures on the Holy Catholic Church' (1876), and 'Septuagesima Lectures' (1877), all small works. Family In 1854 Ashwell married Elizabeth Fixsen, of Blackheath, who survived him.

He was considered by some a sacred figure on account of his violent end in battle. Assumption of the imamate Ahmad bin al-Husayn was a Yemeni Sayyid who belonged to the house of Rassids. His exact relationship to previous imams of Yemen is disputed, but according to one pedigree he was a descendant of al-Qasim ar-Rassi (d. 860) in the eleventh degree.The filiation was al-Qasim ar-Rassi - Abu Abdallah Muhammad - al-Qasim - Ahmad - Abu'l-Barakat - Ahmad - al-Qasim - Abdallah - al-Qasim - Ahmad - al-Husayn - al-Mahdi Ahmad. He was a trained jurist who was well acquainted with the doctrines of the Zaydiyyah. His religious credentials were acceptable, since he was consistent in prayers and fasting.H.C. Kay, Yaman; Its Early Medieval History. London 1892, p. 189 He was proclaimed in the mountain stronghold Thula in June 1248, becoming imam with the approval of the family of the former imam al-Mansur Abdallah. The new imam took the traditional capital of the Zaidi imams, Sa'dah, from the Sulaimanids, and extended his sway over 20 fortresses. The Zaidi positions were helped through the murder of the powerful Rasulid sultan Nur ad-Din Umar in 1250. In the same year, al-Mahdi Ahmad managed to seize San'a, where the Rasulid kinsman Asad ad-Din governed. Asad ad-Din withdrew to the nearby fortress Birash, from where he tried to disturb the imam's moves. Nevertheless, al-Mahdi Ahmad's sphere of power soon stretched as far south as Dhamar. He received a setback when he had to abandon San'a after less than a year. Instead, he bought the Birash stronghold from Asad ad-Din, whose loyalty to his kinsman the Rasulid sultan was doubtful.Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. V, Leiden 1986, p. 1241. Al- Mahdi Ahmad entered into negotiations with al-Muzaffar Yusuf, the new sultan of the Rasulid Dynasty which ruled much of Yemen from the lowland. However, the differences between the Sunni Rasulids and the Zaidi imam were too obvious, and a falling-out ensued. Al-Muzaffar Yusuf sent assassins to kill al-Mahdi Ahmad. The imam was injured by a dagger, but his life was saved by his attendants.H.C. Kay, 1892, p. 321. The battle of Shuwabah The family of al-Mansur Abdallah soon became dissatisfied with al-Mahdi Ahmad. The imam was accused of lacking the prescribed qualifications for the imamate as laid down by Zaydiyyah tradition. Al-Mahdi Ahmad's popularity also decreased due to some cases of extortion. Dissatisfied Zaidis rallied behind Shams ad-Din Ahmad, a son of al-Mansur Abdallah, whom they proclaimed imam in 1254. With the help of the ever-vacillating Asad ad-Din, Shams ad-Din marched into Sa'dah and al-Mahdi fled. In the same year, Shams ad-Din and his brother Sarim ad-Din Da'ud visited the Rasulid sultan in Zabid and were received as royals.Madeleine Schneider, 'Les inscriptions arabes de l'ensemble architectural de Zafar-Dhi Bin (Y√©men du Nord)', Journal asiatique 273 1985. p. 94-5. Another claimant to the imamate was the Sharif al-Hasan bin Wahhas. The people was enjoined to support his candidature in 1256, and certain ulemas accepted him. In 1257, a Zaidi convent declared al-Mahdi Ahmad deposed.Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol, V, Leiden 1986, p. 1241. Shams ad-Din took command over the insurgents and received support from the Rasulid sultan al-Muzaffar Yusuf. Al-Mahdi Ahmad tried to maintain his position with his remaining followers. The opposing forces eventually met in Shuwabah in 1258. The troops of al-Mahdi Ahmad were defeated and fled the field. The imam was left almost alone on the battlefield. He was surrounded by enemies and killed. His head was severed and carried to Shams ad-Din Ahmad.H.C. Kay, 1892, p. 321. Miraculous occurrences were reported at his grave in Shuwaba. The battle supposedly took place on the same day as al-Musta'sim, the last caliph of Baghdad, was killed by the Mongols.El-Khazreji, The Pearl-Strings; A History of the Resuli dynasty, Vol. I. Leiden 1906, p. 150. Alternatively, the date of the battle is given as 7 March 1258. The killing of the imam was followed by further internal strife among the Zaidis. Shams ad-Din Ahmad attempted to secure his claim and acknowledged the overlordship of the Rasulids. However, he was immediately challenged by Sharif al-Hasan bin Wahhas who was also proclaimed as the new imam.

Description Standing on a rocky outcrop to the north west of the town, the castle is in a ruined state. Only the supporting wall of the chapel, with heavy buttresses is visible. The remaining walls are of limestone hardcore. History The castle was created by the Duke of Lorraine who gave it as a fiefdom to the lords of Echery, after whom the castle gets its name. It was first documented in 1250. The castle suffered two sieges in the second half of the 13th century, after which, with the extinction of the Echery family, it was shared between the Ribeaupierres and Hattstatts. The two families frequently quarrelled, to the extent that a wall was built to separate the parts of the castle. In 1452, the Ribeaupierres entrusted the safety of their part of the castle to the knights of Andolsheim; the Hattstatts followed suit in 1463. With the death of the last Andolsheim knight in 1472, guardianship of the castle passed to Herrmann Waldner. The castle was notorious for acts of banditry perpetrated by its occupants.Ch√¢teau du Haut Eckerich on Ch√¢teaux Forts d'Alsace website A chapel was added in 1460, built outside the original enceinte, against a thick surrounding wall. The castle was abandoned during the Thirty Years' War and fell into ruins. After the French Revolution, it was bought by a private owner and sold to the government of Alsace-Lorraine in 1880. The castle was classified as a monument historique in 1898. However, owing to an advanced state of dilapidation, it was declassified in 1932. In 1993, it was sold by the state to an association (Association pour la conservation du ch√¢teau de Haut-Echery) which became responsible for its maintenance.

Chicago area author Edna Ferber used South Holland, Illinois, its pioneers and onion farms as background for her 1924 novel about an ambitious widow in a Midwestern Dutch American farming community. The resilience of Antje Wagemeester Paarlberg, a widowed immigrant and determined pioneer, was allegedly the inspiration for the main character Selina Peake DeJong. On 26 April 1835, Antje Waagmeester married Klaas Paarlberg in their birthplace of Warmenhuizen and settled as farmers in nearby Spanbroek where they would get eight children. In 1847 Klaas and Antje and their seven surviving children set off on a voyage from the Netherlands to America in search of better fortunes on the ship Doggersbank. They felt that the State Church was too liberal and the taxes unfair. The taxes in the Netherlands were high; there was blight in the potato crop, and disease among the cattle. The couple heard about wonderful opportunities in America. They left North Holland, a province of the Netherlands with their seven children, the oldest being seven years old and the youngest three months old. Klaas died of pleurisy during the voyage and was buried at sea. He was 43 years old at the time of his death. Antje Paarlberg continued to America with their children with this single thought in mind, De Heere zal wel zorgen or \\"the Lord will provide\\". The ship's captain offered to take Antje Paarlberg and her children back to the Netherlands but she refused to go. The determined 'Widow Paarlberg', as she is referred to in South Holland, persevered even after the youngest child also died. The baby was buried in a small cemetery near Lincoln Park. Antje and her remaining six children settled near other Dutch pioneers 20‚Äì30 miles south of Chicago, buying eighty acres of land at seven dollars an acre by Thorn Creek. There she built a log cabin plastered with clay near what would become the village of South Holland, Illinois. Eventually all of her children acquired land in the area and developed farms. Antje Paarlberg died of a stroke in October 1885 at the age of 77. Ferber highly fictionalized Antje's life and the Paarlberg family believes that she is somewhat misrepresented in \\"So Big\\". South Holland's Dutch descendants take exception to the literary license Ferber took with the character of the widow, creating a pushy flirtatious personality that South Hollanders say was nothing like the real Widow Paarlberg. Ferber gives a nod to the real Antje Paarlberg who appears in the novel as the \\"Widow Parlenberg\\". Ferber's So Big won the Pulitzer Prize and is considered among her most popular works. The book Lest We Forget by Henry Paarlberg, one of Klass's and Antje's grandchildren, tells the family's version of the Paarlberg family's difficult journey.  Paarlberg Historical Farm and Museum  Peter Paarlberg, Antje's oldest son, built the frame house on the Paarlberg farm that can be visited today in South Holland. The Paarlberg Historical Farm and Museum are nestled along Thorn Creek at the west end of a beautiful 16 acre park in the southwest corner of town on Paxton Avenue near 172nd Place. This park is host to the Annual Paarlberg Heritage Festival held on Labor Day. Tours of the original farm house, buggy barn, storage barn and the grounds are presented by the South Holland Historical Society members throughout the day. Peter married Cornelia Van Oostenbrugge on October 31, 1870. They had eleven children together. Peter died on August 10, 1921, and Cornelia died on December 29, 1927. Peter's descendants donated the original Paarlberg homestead to the South Holland Historical Society in 1970. A branch of the Peter Paarlberg family continues to farm in Kankakee County, 30 miles south of the original homestead which is today surrounded by suburbia. A second branch of the family farms in LaPorte County, Indiana.

Kosuga (January 17, 1915 ‚Äì January 19, 2001) was an American onion farmer and commodity trader best known for manipulating the onion futures market. Public outcry over his practices led to the passing of the Onion Futures Act, which banned the trading of futures contracts on onions. Personal life The son of a Russian Jew who converted to Catholicism, Kosuga was a devout Catholic. He donated a significant amount of his fortune to the church, and was rewarded with private audiences with three popes. Kosuga carried a .38 caliber pistol and a billy club with him at all times. He drove stock cars in his spare time and was a licensed pilot. He once survived a plane crash near Oswego, New York when the plane he was flying ran out of fuel mid-flight. He was left in a body cast after the crash, but made a quick recovery. Farming Born and raised in Pine Island, New York, Kosuga owned a black dirt farm where he grew onions, celery, and lettuce. His customers included the U.S. Army and Campbell's soup. He also began trading wheat futures. After an unsuccessful stint trading in which he was brought to the brink of bankruptcy, Kosuga withdrew from commodity trading and at his wife's insistence focused on farming full-time. Commodity trading Kosuga was unable to leave trading behind permanently, however, and returned to the commodity market where he began trading onion futures. At the time, onions futures contracts were the most traded product on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, accounting for 20% of its trades in 1955. He soon began splitting his time between New York and Chicago, where he traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange several days a week. In Chicago, he was a very successful trader. He lavished expensive gifts upon his brokers, buying them each a new Buick one year. One of his brokers eventually rose to the position of Chairman of the Mercantile Exchange. Kosuga sometimes used deceptive practices to manipulate the futures market. He once bribed a weather bureau to issue a frost warning in order to inflate the price of futures contracts that he owned. The weather bureau did issue the warning, though the temperature never fell below . =Cornering the market= With his partner Sam Seigel, a fellow onion trader and owner of a local produce company, Kosuga embarked upon a scheme to corner the onion futures market. In the fall of 1955, Seigel and Kosuga bought enough onions and onion futures so that they controlled 98 percent of the available onions in Chicago. Millions of pounds of onions were shipped to Chicago to cover their purchases. By late 1955, they had stored of onions in Chicago. They soon changed course and convinced onion growers to begin purchasing their inventory by threatening to flood the market with onions if they did not. Seigel and Kosuga told the growers that they would hold the rest of their inventory in order to support the price of onions. As the growers began buying onions, Seigel and Kosuga purchased short positions on a large amount of onion contracts. They also arranged to have their stores of onions reconditioned because they had begun to spoil. They shipped them outside of Chicago to have them cleaned and then repackaged and re-shipped back to Chicago. The new shipments of onions caused many futures traders to think that there was an excess of onions and further drove down onion prices in Chicago. By the end of the onion season in March 1956, Seigel and Kosuga had flooded the markets with their onions and driven the price of of onions down to 10 cents a bag. In August 1955, the same quantity of onions had been priced at $2.75 a bag. So many onions were shipped to Chicago in order to depress prices that there were onion shortages in other parts of the United States. Seigel and Kosuga made millions of dollars on the transaction due to their short position on onion futures. At one point, however, of onions were selling in Chicago for less than the bags that held them. This drove many onion farmers into bankruptcy. A public outcry ensued among onion farmers who were left with large amounts of worthless inventory. Many of the farmers had to pay to dispose of the large amounts of onions that they had purchased and grown. =Regulatory action= In the aftermath of the crash, many commentators characterized Kosuga's actions as unprincipled gambling. Kosuga was defiant, replying to his critics: \\"If it's against the law to make money... then I'm guilty\\". The abrupt change in prices gained the attention of the Commodity Exchange Authority. Soon they launched an investigation and the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture and House Committee on Agriculture held hearings on the matter. Kosuga testified before congress, and defended his practices under questioning from members of the committee. During the hearings, the Commodity Exchange Authority stated that it was the perishable nature of onion which made them vulnerable to price swings. Then-congressman Gerald Ford of Michigan sponsored a bill, known as the Onion Futures Act, which banned futures trading on onions. The bill was unpopular among traders, some of whom argued that onion shortages were not a crucial issue since they were used as a condiment rather than a staple food. The president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, E.B. Harris, lobbied hard against the bill. Harris described it as \\"Burning down the barn to find a suspected rat\\". The measure was passed, however, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the bill in August 1958. After the ban was passed, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that the ban unfairly restricted trade. After a federal judge ruled against them, they declined to appeal to the Supreme Court and the ban stood. Later life After the futures market was reformed, Kosuga returned to New York full-time and focused on his local business interests and philanthropy. Kosuga opened a restaurant next to his farm called The Jolly Onion Inn, where he served as a chef. The Jolly Onion Inn (later known as Ye Jolly Onion Inn) became one of the most popular restaurants in Orange County. He became well respected for his philanthropy, and in 1987 was named Pine Island Citizen of the Year by the Pine Island Chamber of Commerce. After Kosuga died, his widow, Polly Kosuga (1915-2009https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid;=43853173), continued his philanthropy.

It is strongly influenced by Croatian Chakavian, Hungarian, German substrates, mainly due to the closeness between two different cultures (the Romanic and the Slavic one) and Austro- Hungarian rule. Thus, because Rijeka was under the Habsburg Monarchy for over five centuries (1466‚Äì1918) and part of the Holy Roman Empire for nine centuries, many of the words are of German and Hungarian origin. Due to extensive emigration to the growing port city during the late 18th and 19th centuries, many words also came from other languages, such as Slovenian. Significant is the amount of literary production carried out in this small dialect, with some of the main local authors using it in their works being Mario Schittar, Gino Antoni, Oscarre Russi, Egidio Milinovich.  Origin and use  Experts say about this dialect: \\"(...) the Croatian language and a variant of the Venetian language certainly coexisted in the city as early as the fifteenth century (...), but taking into account all the historical facts, i.e. that in the ninth and tenth century Venetian merchants, sailors and statesmen on the eastern Adriatic coast already spoke Venetian, the latter was probably spoken even earlier.\\"Mirjana Crniƒá Novosel; Nina Spicijariƒá Pa≈°kvan, ‚ÄûFijumani i stavovi o fijumanskom idiomu u 21. stoljeƒáu‚Äú, Rijeƒçki filolo≈°ki dani 9: zbornik radova s Meƒëunarodnog znanstvenog skupa, editor Diana Stolac, Rijeka: Filozofski fakultet u Rijeci, 2014, pg. 410. \\"Whether the Fiuman dialect is fundamentally a continuation of the language of the autochthonous Romance population with a subsequent stratification of Venetisms or whether its basis is a specific mix of the various Italian dialects of the Italian settlers from the thirteenth century onwards with a later gradual Venetian stratification, it coexisted in Rijeka with the Croats' Chakavian dialect for centuries.\\"Iva Luke≈æiƒá, ‚ÄûO dvama rijeƒçkim puƒçkim jezicima‚Äú, Fluminensia, year V (1993), number 1-2, pg. 27. The Fiuman pedagogist Gemma Harasim wrote in 1909: \\"the Italian language (i.e. Fiuman) is equally understood by almost all of the inhabitants: especially by the Croats, many of whom, in fact, speak it at home and in social life, despite being politically opposed to Italians; Italian is also spoken, although somewhat less well and with a thick exotic accent, by almost all of the Hungarians who come to live here. Therefore the Italian language certainly remains the common language of all nationalities: in peaceful business relations, in conversations and in families, it is almost a general rule that when Hungarians, Croats and Italians meet, the language of exchange remains Italian.\\"Gemma Harasim, ‚ÄûRijeƒçka pisma‚Äú, Fluminensia, year V (1993), number 1-2, pg. 8-9.

Career In 1884, Amdrup, of the Royal Danish Navy, was sent to Amassalik. After wintering, he explored the coast to the north, including an examination of the Kangerlussuaq Fjord, known until then only from Inuit reports. He mapped a large length of coastline while collecting many geological and ethnological finds. By July 1885, he reached Aggas Island (67¬∞ 22' North), the furthest north of this survey. =Carlsbergfondet Expedition til Ost-Gronland= Lieutenant Amdrup was the leader of a major Danish expedition in 1898-1900, the Carlsberg Foundation Expedition to East Greenland (Carlsbergfondet Expedition til Ost-Gronland). With him were botanist Christian Krause, ornithologist Knud Poulsen, and the sailors, A. Jakobsen and Soren P. Nielsen. They left Copenhagen on August 16, 1898, sailing from Copenhagen in the vessel Godthaab, and reaching Amassalik (\\"Angmagssalik\\") on 31 August. The purpose of the expedition was to identify and examine the then completely unexplored stretch of coast between the 66th parallel north and Scoresbysund at about 70th parallel north. The following year, they traveled the coast north to 67¬∞ 22' North, establishing several depots to use for future travel north. During this expedition, Amdrup found the remains of a small, extinct Eskimo settlement. From this find, he brought to Denmark in 1899 a significant ethnographic collection. =The East- Greenland Coast Expedition, 1900= In 1899, Alfred Gabriel Nathorst sold the Antarctic to Amdrup. On June 15, 1900, Amdrup took an 11-man expedition to East Greenland. This expedition, which cartographer Johan Peter Koch joined, was also known as the 'Carlsberg Foundation Expedition'. The survey was to explore the coast between Cape Brewster and Aggas Island. They arrived at Little Pendulum Island, before continuing to Cape Dalton (69¬∞25 N) in mid July where they divided into two parties. While the expedition's second in command, Nikolaj Hartz, stayed with the Antarctic and examined the country up to Scoresbysund and fjords to the north, Amdrup endured great hardship and dangers further south in a small boat Aggas that navigated through the ice belt in the polar stream and mapped an uncharted route. During the part of the expedition in Aggas, a long, wide open boat that carried Amdrup, three others including Ejnar Mikkelsen, plus of supplies,Apollonio, p. 94 Amdrup found a dwelling containing the remains of 38 bodies, from which he inferred that Inuit had been trying to colonize the area. Amdrup and his men were even accused of killing the 38 people, but it was later ascertained that they had starved to death. Having established the fact that there were no other Eskimos on the eastern side of the island other than are known to the Danish missionaries, Amdrup's skeleton find was unusual. Amdrup and his men were picked up by the ship Antarctic at Amassalik in September and he returned to Denmark on October 4, with significant collections of botanical, geological, and zoological, specimens.Apollonio, p. 101 Part of the natural history collection that Amdrup brought back included a live musk ox and ten lemming. He published the expedition results in the \\"Notice of Gr√∏nland\\", XXVII-XXIX. Swedish and English expeditions that were ongoing at the time did not report the considerable progress that the Danish expedition under Amdrup was able to show. =Danmark Expedition to Greenland's Northeast Coast, 1906-1908= From 1905, Amdrup worked as an Adjutant to his friend, Prince Valdemar of Denmark.Mikkelsen (2005), p. 15 He was a member of the Committee for the Denmark expedition to Greenland's northeast coast 1906-1908, and, as the expedition historian,Apollonio, p. 103 Amdrup wrote the expedition history in the \\"Notice of Gr√∏nland\\", XLI. =Later years= In 1913, he was appointed to the Greenland Commission, (1931: Commission for scientific studies in Greenland) of which he was chairman from 1930 until 1931. In 1937, he took over the publication of Meddelelser om Gr√∏nland. He was a member of the editorial board of \\"Gr√∏nland in tohundred√•ret for Hans Egede's Land\\". Amdrup was promoted to the rank of commander in 1916. In 1925, he was promoted to rear admiral in 1925, and was the Commander of the Niels Iuel. From 1927, he was Vice Admiral Sir Georg Amdrup. Awards and honors At the winter 1900-01 meeting of the Royal Danish Geographical Society held in the Copenhagen Concert Hall, Amdrup was honored with a Medal of Merit in gold. He also received other medals from several foreign geographical societies, including the Royal Geographical Society in 1902, and the Royal Geographical Society's Back grant. In 1913, Mikkelsen dedicated his book, Being the story of the 'Alabama' expedition, 1909-1912 to Amdrup. Amdrup Land () in northeastern Greenland was named after him by the Denmark expedition. Another landform named in his honor is Amdrup Fjord . The Shipbuilding & Engineering Company's ship G.C. Amdrup is also named for him.Higgins, p. 26 Also named on his behalf is Leptognathia amdrupii, which was considered for transfer to the genus Chauliopleona by 2000 and transferred to Chauliopleona amdrupii by 2005.

United States, 532 U.S. 59 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case decided in 2001. The case concerned whether federal appellate courts should give deferential or de novo review of certain Sentencing Guideline determinations made by a trial judge. Background The United States Sentencing Guidelines are the series of rules which guide a federal trial judge in issuing a sentence to a convicted individual. In Buford, the trial judge had to determine whether certain prior convictions relating to drug- crime arrests should be considered 'related' or 'consolidated'. The judge ruled they should not (and thus count as five individual priors) and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. The appellate court did not re- review the facts (de novo review), instead only reviewing certain legal aspects of the determination. Buford appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on the grounds that the appellate court should have re-reviewed the determinations of the trial judge rather than defer to him. Opinion of the Court Justice Breyer delivered the unanimous Opinion of the Court. He began by stating that the question in the case is \\"a narrow one\\" that is simply based on the standard of review for appellate courts when reviewing this specific technical determination made by District Courts.532 U.S. 59 at 61 Although it was a simple issue, seven circuit courts of appeal had differed on the standard to take.532 U.S. 59 at 63 Breyer, turning to the actual question of the standard of review, argued for a deferential framing. \\"The district court\\", he wrote, \\"is in a better position than the appellate court to decide whether a particular set of individual circumstances demonstrates 'functional consolidation'\\". Because the Seventh Circuit had given deference instead of de novo (completely new) review of the lower court's determinations, the decision was affirmed. Buford's sentence remained the same.

Active flying at the airfield ended on 28 February 1945, and jurisdiction of the base was transferred from Third Air Force to Air Technical Service Command for disposition on 31 March 1945.AFHRA Document 00188116 It is also known that Aiken AAF held a branch prisoner of war camp holding about 300 POWs who worked in the local forests. The dates of the POW camp are uncertain. The airfield was turned over to local government authorities afterward and was converted into Aiken Municipal Airport. =Aiken Air Force Station= In 1955 the United States Air Force exercised a return right to Aiken Municipal Airport and established Aiken Air Force Station as an Air Defense Command (ADC) general surveillance radar station. This site was initially part of Phase II of the Mobile Radar program. Radars in this network were designated ‚ÄúSM.‚Äù Designated as SM-159 Aiken AFS was the first Phase II Mobile Radar system to achieve operational status. During December 1955 the 861st Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron began activating AN/FPS-3, AN/MPS-14, and AN/TPS-10D radars. Initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In 1958 an AN/FPS-20 and an AN/MPS-14 were operational. The site subsequently received an AN/FPS-7C search radar and an AN/FPS-26 heightfinder radar. During 1961 Aiken AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-09 at Gunter AFB, Alabama. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 861st Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 November 1961. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-159. In addition, Aiken AFS was incorporated into BUIC I, a manual back-up interceptor control system. BUIC I provided limited command and control capability in the event the SAGE system was disabled. Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The 861st was inactivated in June 1975. The FAA continued to operate the AN/FPS-7C search radar for a few years, while the cantonment area was converted into a minimum-security prison. Dissatisfied with the prison setting, the FAA relocated to Lincolnton, Georgia, where today they continue to operate an ARSR-3 search radar. The prison was shut down in the mid / late 1990s, and the entire site has since been dismantled. =Air Force units and assignments = =Units= Aiken Army Air Field * 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Group : Moved from Camp Campbell, Ky on 22 June 1943 departed for Lebanon, TN ca. 25 October 1943 :: 19th Liaison Squadron :: Moved from Camp Campbell, KY on 23 June 1943, departed for India on 26 February 1944 :: 97th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron :: Moved from Camp Campbell, KY on 23 Jun 1943, departed for Morris Field, NC on 29 August 1943 :: 118th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron :: Moved from Statesboro Army Air Field, GA on 29 August 1943, departed for Key Field, MS on 25 October 1943 * 25th Service Group : Moved from Greenville AAB, SC in September 1943, departed for India on 13 January 1944 :: 35th Service Squadron :: Moved from Greenville AAB, SC in September 1943, departed for India on 13 January 1944 :: 349th Service Squadron :: Moved from Greenville AAB, SC in September 1943, departed for India on 13 January 1944 * 1332d Guard Squadron : Activated on 25 June 1943, disbanded ca. 1 April 1944 * 127th Liaison Squadron (Commando)/2d Air Commando Group : Moved from Statesboro Army Air Field, GA on 18 May 1944, moved to Dunnellon Army Air Field, FL on 10 June 1944 * 155th Liaison Squadron (Commando)/2d Air Commando Group : Activated on 10 June 1944, moved to Dunnellon Army Air Field, FL on 12 June 1944 * 156th Liaison Squadron (Commando)/2d Air Commando Group : Moved from Statesboro Army Air Field, GA on 18 May 1944, moved to Dunnellon Army Air Field, FL on 12 June 1944 * 162d Liaison Squadron/III Tactical Air Division : Activated on 15 May 1944, moved to Lafayette Airport, LA on 13 July 1944 * 349th Army Air Forces Base Unit : Organized ca. 1 April 1944, discontinued ca. 28 February 1945 * 4184th Army Air Forces Base Unit : Organized ca. 28 February 1945, discontinued ca. 31 March 1945 Aiken Air Force Station * Constituted as the 861st Aircraft Warning and Control Squadron : Activated at Dobbins AFB (M-87), GA on 8 April 1955 (not manned or equipped) : Assigned to Aiken Air Force Station, SC, 1 December 1955 : Redesignated as 861st Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 November 1961 : Inactivated on 30 June 1975 =Assignments= * Third Air Force, 24 December 1942 * First Air Force, 1 May 1944 * Air Technical Service Command, 28 February 1945 - 31 March 1945 *35th Air Division, 1 December 1955 *32d Air Division, 15 November 1958 *Montgomery Air Defense Sector, 1 July 1961 * 32d Air Division, 1 April 1966 *33d Air Division, 14 November 1969 *20th Air Division, 19 November 1959 - 30 June 1975 See also *South Carolina World War II Army Airfields *List of USAF Aerospace Defense Command General Surveillance Radar Stations References * Cornett, Lloyd H. and Johnson, Mildred W., A Handbook of Aerospace Defense Organization 1946 - 1980, Office of History, Aerospace Defense Center, Peterson AFB, CO (1980). * Maurer, Maurer (ed.), \\"Air Force Combat Units of World War II\\", Office of Air Force History, Washington, DC, 1961 (reprint 1983) . * Maurer, Maurer.

The two most significant differences from the competing Linotype machine are: * It is divided into two machines, the Monotype keyboard and the Monotype caster, which communicate by perforated paper tape. It is not necessary to have the same number of each machine. * The Monotype caster casts individual letters, which are assembled into lines in a fashion similar to classical movable type. This requires a more complex high- speed water-cooled casting mold, but only requires one matrix per possible character. A Monotype operator enters text on a Monotype keyboard, on which characters are arranged in the QWERTY arrangement of a conventional typewriter, but with this arrangement repeated multiple times. Thus, the typesetter moves his hands from one group of keys to another to type uppercase or lowercase, small capitals, italic uppercase or italic lowercase, and so on. When the text nears the right margin, a drum on the keyboard indicates codes which are punched on the paper tape with special keys to indicate how the line is to be justified. The tape is then taken to a Monotype caster, which reads the tape and produces a column of justified type from which the text entered on the keyboard can be printed.  History  In 1885, the American inventor Tolbert Lanston applied for a patent on a typesetting system that included the basic Monotype keyboard, but which produced a printing surface through a cold- stamping method. In 1890, he filed a subsequent patent, which covered the Monotype caster. In 1897, the Lanston Monotype Corporation opened a branch in England, which later became an independent company.  Design  = Keyboard = A Monotype keyboard; the tape reel being produced is at the top A Monotype keyboard allows a keyboard operator to prepare a perforated paper tape, called ribbon, that will direct the casting of type separately from its actual casting. The keyboard on which the operator types is removable, as is a set of keybars under the keys; the keybars, corresponding to each key, determine which holes will be punched in the tape. During operation, two sets of keys and keybars are placed in two side-by-side trays on the keyboard. The keybars are adjustable, so that the coding of the keys can be changed. Keytops also are replaceable, so that the keyboard can be reconfigured. = Matrix-Case = A Monotype matrix case For the Monotype caster to produce types with the shape of the desired character on their face, a matrix with that character incised in it must be moved to the top of the mold in which the type slug will be cast. This is achieved by placing a rectangular array of bronze matrices, each of which is 0.2 inch square, in a holder, called the matrix-case. Originally, it contained 225 matrices, in 15 rows and 15 columns; later versions of the Monotype caster expanded that first to 15 rows and 17 columns (255 matrices), and then to 16 rows and 17 columns (272 matrices). The paper tape that controls casting contains 14 columns of holes that indicate the row of the matrix-case to be used, and 14 columns of holes that indicate the column of the matrix-case to be used. Originally, one row and one column of the matrix- case were indicated by the absence of a hole, and each of the others was indicated by a single hole. When the matrix-case was enlarged, some columns or rows of the matrix-case were indicated by combinations of two holes instead. The row of the matrix-case on which the matrix for a character is contained also indicated the width of that character. This was one major reason why reconfiguring the keyboard needed to be easy, since the arrangement of characters in the matrix case would varied with the typeface. A part called the wedge indicated the width corresponding to each row of the matrix-case. = Mould = The mould is one of the unique parts of the system, and together with the matrix-case, it's the centerpiece of the caster. Its job is to locate under the matrix for the casting, shaping the body of the sort, and then deliver it to the typecarrier, and eventually the galley. In the most simplistic way, the mould is a square pipe, with a conic funnel at its bottom. In detail, the mould does quite a lot more than just being a square pipe. There is a mechanism to control its width, both for casting characters and spaces. The width is set by special parts called \\" **wedges** \\". Those are readjusted for each cast, thus controlling the width of the mould, thus the width of the sort or space. This wedge position depends on the row of the currently cast character in the matrix case, so by setting the letter to be cast, the width of the mould is also set. Just for spaces, there is a second wedge with finer steps, used to set their precise width for each line, so it's \\"mathematically\\" justified. For the casting operation, the mould width is set, and it's placed above the conic metal injector, and below matrix. The injector is raised, and fits into the conic funnel at the base of the mould, ensuring precise positioning. At the same time, a pin is pressed to the round depression at the top of the matrix, ensuring its precise positioning, and tight contact with the mould. The metal is injected with some pressure, and almost immediately the injector and the pin retreat, releasing the mould to rush to the ejection site and back, to have its wedges adjust for the next cast, and releasing the matrix-case to position the next character to be cast. Another part of the mould is called the \\" **crossblock** \\". While the metal is injected into the mould, it seals the room where the character is formed. When the cast is done, the now solid metal needs to leave the mould. The crossblock will move to the side of the machine. When the crossblock travels: starting above the metal injector and below the matrix, it travels to the ejection site, shaving the foot of the sort as it moves. When the crossblock is at its maximum, the \\" **mould-blade\\"** will push the sort inside the \\" **typecarrier** \\". This piece moves in front the mould-opening and takes the sort in. A spring inside the typecarrier holds the sort such that it can not turn. The crossblock and the typecarrier move back, and the character is pushed inside \\" **character-channel** \\". At the same moment the next sort is cast. The typecarrier is firmly connected to the crossblock of the mould, and it controls the movement of the crossblock. Inside the character-channel the line is built, until it is finished, and a combined 0075-0005 code instructs the caster to move the finished line at the galley. This all takes less than half a second - the caster casts 140 sorts a minute or better in all but the earliest models, depending on the size of the font cast. The mould is water- cooled, through special passages, or cavities, which is what enables it to cast at that rate, without getting too hot to continue. Special mouldoil is used to lubricate the moving pieces inside mould, and prevent builtup of carbon-particles, because the very high temperatures inside the mould. = Justification = The width of a sort cast on the Monotype varied from 3 to 18 units. (A special attachment was required to reduce the minimum from 4 units to 3 units.) A width of 18 units corresponded to the set width of the typeface. Thus, if a typeface was described as ‚Äú12 set‚Äù, 18 units would correspond to one pica em. (A pica em is a horizontal distance equal to 12 points pica (0.1660 inch).) The width of the spaces in each line is further adjusted by a second wedge, detailed below, to adjust the line \\"mathematically\\". The setting for the spaces width is read from the cylinder and punched to the tape by the typesetter, once the line is done. Since the tape is played backwards for casting, the caster reads this setting before casting any of the actual sorts and spaces for this line. When printing tabular text, such as timetables, directories, catalogs, etc, the second wedge is not used, and the typesetter uses fixed-width spaces, called quads, such that each row begins at a fixed location. Using quads allows the typesetter to bring the line length to an integral multiple of the set width, and then count \\"em-quads\\" (full set-width quads) to the beginning of the next row. The 12-point size of a typeface could also be 12 set, the 11-point size could be 11 set, and so on. But this was not always true: some typefaces could be somewhat wider or narrower than the standard, and many typefaces were modified to be slightly wider in smaller sizes. The set size could be varied in units of point. Thus, while the Monotype unit system was normally described as one of 18 units to the em, it was 18 units to the em of the set size, not necessarily the em of the actual type size in use. When text was typed on the Monotype keyboard, the keyboard kept track of the number of units taken up by the characters in the line, and also the number of ‚Äújustifying spaces‚Äù in the line. When the right margin was approached, this information was indicated to the operator on a rotating drum on the keyboard. As part of finishing a line of text, this information was punched on the tape using two rows of special keys on the keyboard. In order that the Monotype caster would know ahead of time how wide to make the spaces in a given line of text, the tape is read by the caster in reverse: the last code punched is read first, and the first code punched is read by the caster last. The caster reads this width first, so it knows at what width to cast the \\"justifying spaces\\", until the \\"end-line\\" code (the very first thing punched) is read at last. Reading in reverse order also facilitates some sort of \\"error correction\\": when the typesetter makes an error, there is no \\"white-out\\" to correct it. Instead, the typesetter types a code that says \\"bad line\\", then re-types the full line. When the caster encounters this \\"bad line\\" code, the paper-tape reader stops passing the codes to the rest of the caster, until the next \\"end of line\\" code (punched by the typesetter prior to making the error) is encountered. =Justification wedges= Justification was obtained with a system of wedges. The caster has an accuracy of 2000 parts of an inch (in modern terms, 2000 dpi). There are 6 wedges, possible on the machine: * the normal wedge * two transfer wedges: the lower and the upper transfer wedge * two justification wedges, D11 & D12: * the unit-adding wedge (not present at all machines) * the normal wedge belonging to the layout of the diecase or matrix-case :: This wedge makes the same movement as the diecase in one direction, and the rows are polished according to the layout and the set of the used font. * the lower transfer- wedge :: This wedge is used in combination with the normal wedge. * the 0005-justification wedge :: This 0005-wedge can be laid in 15 different positions; the difference between two positions is 0.0005 inch. * the 0075-justification wedge :: This 0075-wedge can be laid in 15 different positions; the difference between two positions is 0.0075 inch. * the unit- adding wedge :: When taken into action, will change the position of the lower transfer wedge, and add 1, 2 or 3 units to the width of the character cast. The attachment used for this needed some extra coding. * the upper transfer- wedge :: This wedge was used when the 0075 & 0005 justification wedges are used, in combination with the normal wedge. The combined actions of all these wedges governed the opening of the mould-blade, and in this way the width of the character or space to be cast was adjusted. The position of the 0005- and 0075-wedges was put onto the right position during the codes that marked the start of casting the line. Two codes were used during a procedure that was called: Double justification * The first code, with three holes in the ribbon,(0075, b, 0005) caused the following actions: ** the pump is stopped ** both justification-wedges move to the same position b ** the previous line already cast was transferred to the galley * the second code has two holes in the ribbon: (0075, a) : ** the lead-pump is halted for this machine-cycle ** and the pump-mechanism is reactivated for the next next machine cycle ** the 0075-wedge is brought to position a. The 0005-wedge will remain at position b. The 3/8-position was called ‚Äúneutral‚Äù. In this position, the 0075-wedge is at row 3, and the 0005-wedge will be at row 8. In this position no width was added to the space or character to be cast. The minimum was 1/1. In this position the width of the cast was 2 √ó .0075‚Ä≥ + 7 √ó .0005‚Ä≥ = 0.0185‚Ä≥ less. The maximum 15/15 added a lot more to the cast: 12 √ó .0075‚Ä≥ + 7 √ó .0005‚Ä≥ = .00935‚Ä≥. The operator had to be aware that the opening of the mould should always be smaller than .2‚Ä≥ because otherwise the matrix could not seal the mould, and a splash of molten lead would occur. Single justification was used to change the position of the justification wedges whenever needed, without transferring the line to the galley. This procedure was also used to adjust the spaces in more than one segment within a line. In this way it was possible to cast complete time-tables. * The first code, with two holes in the ribbon, caused the following actions: ** the pump was stopped and halted ** the 0005-justification-wedge moved to its desired position * the second code, with two holes in the ribbon, was needed: ** to ensure no pump-action during this machine-cycle ** to activate the pump-mechanism for the next machine cycle ** to bring the 0075-wedge in the desired position. Besides this, there was also the possibility to cast high-spaces. Those high-spaces could support any overhanging character. When a character could not be cast at the desired width where it was put into the matrix-case, the character could be cast. A part of the sign would not be supported by the ingot. Directly after the character was cast, one or more high-spaces of 5 or 6 units were cast, to add to the desired width and to support the sign, in order to resist the pressure during the printing-process. Unit shift On top of this, there was the possibility of unit-shift. With this attachment it became possible to use a matrix-case with an extra row: 16 √ó 17 positions. The wedge still had exactly 15 positions. The matrix-case was, when needed, forced to go to the next row. The matrix was cast at the width of the wedge 1 position higher. This system made it possible to place more matrices in the matrix-case. Another advantage for Monotype was that it made it possible to change the layout of the matrix-case in such a way that any customer could get its own personalized layout. MNH & MNK There were even other 16√ó17 systems possible, in both the matrix-case and the wedge had 16 possible positions. These systems were rather expensive, because of all the extra wedges needed that could not be used on other machines. The 16th row was coded with a code of two or three letters. Of this system there have been two variants: the extra row was coded with either MNH or MNK.The Monotype Keyboard operator's manual, 1950, The National Committee of Monotype user's Association, London, UK  Calculating with the Monotype system  =Definitions= the set  The set of a character is defined as the width of the widest character in quarter-points pica. 8 1/4 set => W = 8,25 pica points wide = 8,25 / (6*12) = 8,25/72 = 0.11458333 inch unit  1 unit = 1/18 of the widest character: 1 unit of 8,25 set = 8,25 / (6*12*18) = 8,25 / 1296 = 0,0063657 inch =Calculating the adjustment correction at the end of the line= Example 1: line 24 pica long, 8,25 set: (24 * .1660 * 1296) / 8.25 = 626 units 8,25 set 620 units used, 8 variable spaces => 6 units left to split: 6 units 8,25 set = (6 * 8,25 / 1296) / 8 = 0,004774 inch The accuracy of the machine is in steps of .0005 inch: 0,004774 * 2000 = 9,548 rounded at 10.

Deloria, which explores the history of the conflicted relationship white America has with Native American peoples. It explores the common historical and contemporary societal pattern of non-Natives simultaneously mimicking stereotypical ideas and imagery of \\"Indians\\" and \\"Indianness\\" (the \\"Playing Indian\\" of the title), in a quest for National identity in particular, while also denigrating, dismissing, and making invisible real, contemporary Indian people. Overview The focus is on how and why white Americans mimic stereotypical ideas of Indian traditions, images, spiritual ceremonies, and clothing, citing examples such as the Boston Tea Party, the Improved Order of Red Men, Tammany Hall, Scouting societies like the Order of the Arrow, and in more recent decades, hippies and New Agers. Referring to D. H. Lawrence's Studies in Classic American Literature, Deloria argues that white Americans have used an idealized image of the anachronistic Indian of historical times, and the practice of \\"playing Indian\\" to create their own national identity; both identifying with Indians as liberated, patriotic New World inhabitants in touch with nature, while simultaneously denigrating real, contemporary Native American people as ignorant, savage others, incapable or unworthy of preserving their own cultures. \\"Disguise readily calls the notion of fixed identity into question,\\" writes Deloria. \\"At the same time, however, wearing a mask also makes one self-conscious of a real 'me' underneath.\\" The book is a reworking of Deloria's 1994 Yale doctoral dissertation. He explores the white American dual fascination with \\"the vanishing Indian\\" and the idea that the white man can then be the true inheritor and preserver of authentic \\"Indianness\\", with the only \\"authentic\\" Indians being dead and in the past. A recurring trope in this pattern is \\"the Indian 'Death Speech'\\", an example he cites is from James Fenimore Cooper's The Redskins, \\"You hear my voice for the last time. I shall soon cease to speak.\\" Deloria writes that, \\"not coincidentally\\" the first \\"lodges\\" of groups like Order of the Red Men were named after these literary figures, created by colonists to verbalize the wishes of the colonists, Deloria refers to David Roediger's The Wages of Whiteness, a similar book about the construction of the white race in opposition to black slaves; his book has itself been compared to scholarly work on blackface and to the work of Richard White.

The phrase came from baseball terminology, referring to a play in which the ball is thrown from the area covered by the left fielder to either home plate or first base, surprising the runner. Variations include \\"out in left field\\" and simply \\"left field\\". According to the Major League Baseball website the term means \\"crazy.\\" Cook County Hospital (by the West Side Grounds, the Chicago Cubs first location under what is now the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine) had a mental institution behind left field, and \\"patients could be heard yelling and screaming things at fans behind the left field wall.\\" This is disputed since there is no evidence of the phrase being used before the 1940s, and the Cubs moved from the ballpark in 1915. There is another usage that comes also from baseball. During a time period, the shape of the outfield in Yankee Stadium roughly approximated an oval, with the \\"long\\" portion pointing to left-center. A left-fielder would thus typically be stationed further back from the action than the center or right fielders, as he would have a greater amount of ground to cover. Hence, \\"out in left field\\" meant one was furthest from the action taking place at home-plate, and the most likely to draw erroneous, fanciful conclusions about that action; thus, in a general sense, someone out in the left field would be someone who was not taking part in the action of whatever endeavor we were talking about. Music industry Popular music historian Arnold Shaw wrote in 1949 for the Music Library Association that the term \\"out of left field\\" was first used in the idiomatic sense of \\"from out of nowhere\\" by the music industry to refer to a song that unexpectedly performed well in the market. Based on baseball lingo, a sentence such as \\"That was a hit out of left field\\" was used by song pluggers who promoted recordings and sheet music, to describe a song requiring no effort to sell. A \\"rocking chair hit\\" was the kind of song which came \\"out of left field\\" and sold itself, allowing the song plugger to relax. A 1943 article in Billboard magazine expands the use to describe people unexpectedly drawn to radio broadcasting: Further instances of the phrase were published in the 1940s, including more times in Billboard magazine and once in a humor book titled How to Be Poor. Later explanations In May 1981, columnist William Safire asked readers of The New York Times to send him any ideas they had regarding the origin of the phrase \\"out of left field\\"‚Äîhe did not know where it came from, and did not refer to Shaw's work. On June 28, 1981, he devoted most of his Sunday column to the phrase, offering up various responses he received. The earliest scholarly citation Safire could find was a 1961 article in the journal American Speech, which defined the variation \\"out in left field\\" as meaning \\"disoriented, out of contact with reality.\\" Linguist John Algeo told Safire that the phrase most likely came from baseball observers rather than from baseball fans or players. In Safire's Political Dictionary, Safire writes that the phrase \\"out of left field\\" means \\"out of the ordinary, out of touch, far out.\\" The variation \\"out in left field\\" means alternately \\"removed from the ordinary, unconventional\\" or \\"out of contact with reality, out of touch.\\" He compares the term to left-wing politics and the Left Coast‚Äîslang for the liberal-leaning coastal cities in California, Oregon and Washington. In 1998, American English professor Robert L. Chapman, in his book American Slang, wrote that the phrase \\"out of left field\\" was in use by 1953. He did not cite Shaw's work and he did not point to printed instances of the phrase in the 1940s. Marcus Callies, an associate professor of English and philology at the University of Mainz in Germany, wrote that \\"the precise origin is unclear and disputed\\", referring to Christine Ammer's conclusion in The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms. Callies suggested that the left fielder in baseball might throw the ball to home plate in an effort to get the runner out before he scores, and that the ball, coming from behind the runner out of left field, would surprise the runner. From the Way Out In Left Field Society: \\"The phrase \\"way out in left field\\" has evolved to mean an eccentric, odd, misguided or peculiar statement or act. The origin lies in the West Side Grounds that the Chicago Cubs called home from 1893 to 1915. As legend has it, a mental hospital was located directly behind the left field wall. The institute housed mental patients who could be heard making strange and bizarre comments within listening distance of players and fans. Thus, if someone said that you were \\"way out in left field,\\" the person was questioning your sanity and comparing you with a mental patient.

There is also a scene where Charlie crosses the Atlantic in the Hindenburg. This is the 14th film starring Warner Oland as Chan and produced by Fox.  Plot  When Chan's oldest son, Lee (Keye Luke), is chosen to compete in the Olympics, Chan is proud as can be. Meanwhile, over the skies of Chan's Honolulu, the \\"Hopkins plane\\" is demonstrating an improvement of remote radio control to the US military. However, the aircraft is hijacked by a concealed stowaway, the device stolen, and the test pilot murdered. When Chan, followed by his astute second son, Charlie Jr. (Layne Tom Jr.), tracks down the stowaway, he finds only the man's body. On the passenger list of the only aircraft to leave Honolulu for the mainland after the incident are Richard Masters (Allan Lane) and Yvonne Roland (Katherine DeMille). Masters was the intended test pilot, only he injured his shoulder and had to be replaced. It turns out, however, he left on the Pan Am Clipper to travel to the Olympics himself as a competitor. Perusing the list, Hopkins (Jonathan Hale) recognizes the name of arms dealer Arthur Hughes (C. Henry Gordon). Several of the suspects head for Germany by steamship. Chan, Hughes and the inventor Cartwright manage to arrive ahead of them by taking the Zeppelin Hindenburg. Aboard the ship Manhattan, Lee Chan suspects Roland of being an \\"adventuress\\". He spots her putting a piece of paper in her book, and Hughes taking it. He confides in fellow Olympian Betty Adams (Pauline Moore), Masters' girlfriend. When the ship docks, German Inspector Strasser, Chan and Hopkins go to question Roland, only to find her gone and her cabin rifled. Chan is reunited with his son Lee when the latter sneaks into the cabin through a porthole to play detective. On the train trip to Berlin, Chan learns that Lee saw Roland borrow a camera from Adams. Hughes overhears the pair speculate that the invention was smuggled off the ship in it. Hughes advises Chan to stop investigating, then spots a gun barrel in a passing car and pushes the pair to safety. A shot strikes their compartment window. Later, Hughes arranges for Adams' camera to be stolen, but finds nothing inside. A hotel maid tries to steal the invention, hidden in Adams' candy box, but is foiled by Chan and Strasser. When she runs to the window to warn her accomplices, Charlie substitutes a book for the device without being noticed. Hopkins insists on keeping the candy box in his hotel suite, where he is visited by Hughes. Chan and a policeman break in when they hear gunfire. They find Cartwright on the floor. He claims Hughes accused Hopkins of taking the device to double-cross the stockholders of his company, then after Hughes left, Hopkins took the invention at gunpoint and slugged him. Roland takes the candy box to her employer, diplomat the Honorable Charles Zaraka (Morgan Wallace). When they discover the substitution, Roland surmises that Chan has the device. Zaraka sends Chan a ticket to the opening ceremony. While Chan verbally spars with him and Roland, Lee is kidnapped. Chan allows himself to be taken to Zaraka to exchange the device for his son. Hopkins is brought in to verify it is the invention; he does (even though it is an imitation with a radio beacon inside). Satisfied, Zaraka orders his men to dispose of the Chans when Hughes and his men burst in. Hughes threatens to kill Lee if Chan does not produce the real equipment, but the police arrive just in time to rescue the detective. Hopkins is found unconscious from a gunshot in another room. Cartwright accuses Hughes of the shooting, but Chan proves that Cartwright was responsible for that and also the murder of his accomplice back in Honolulu. Afterward, Lee wins the 100 meter swim.

A few weeks ago a wound in his right leg healed and since that time he had been growing steadily worse. The funeral will take place tomorrow afternoon and services will be conducted by Rev. Charles T. House, pastor of the Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church. Burial will be made in the National Cemetery, adjoining Loudon Park.

A comrade in arms, who was with him, was killed outright, while Captain Taylor was shot in the right hand. In the battle of Petersburg, Va., on August 14, 1864, Captain Taylor carried the colors in the face of a terrific fire, and after several of the standard-bearers had been shot down. It was in this engagement that he received the wound in the leg from which he never fully recovered.

Taylor Penetrated the Confederate's Lines and Gained Valuable Information. Conspicuous for Bravery. Capt. William Taylor, of the First Maryland Regiment, G.A.R., aged 66 years, died at his home, 19 Fairview avenue, yesterday morning. His death was caused by wounds received during the Civil War. A few weeks ago, Captain Taylor complained of the wounds. On last Tuesday, he was taken seriously ill. He grew worse, and his doctor said that the wounds were the immediate cause of his death. He is survived by his wife, Ruth M., and two sons and one daughter. Captain Taylor was a member of Union Veteran Legion, No. 109, Wilson Post and the Medal of Honor Legion. Funeral services will be held from his home Wednesday afternoon with military orders. The remains will be interred at the National Cemetery. Rev. Mr. Charles House, pastor of the Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church, will officiate. Joseph Cook, undertaker, will have charge of the arrangements. Captain Taylor's military career is distinguished by two most daring deeds. The first was the burning of a bridge at Front Royal, Va., May 23, 1862, where a detachment of Stonewall Jackson's force fell upon and routed a body of General Banks, with a loss of 904 men. Captain Taylor, in company with another man, volunteered to rush forward, in the face of a deadly fire from the enemy, and destroy this bridge to prevent the Confederates from crossing. The rush was made in safety, although shot fell all around them until they neared the place where they were to fire the bridge. Here Captain Taylor's companion was killed, and he himself was severely wounded in the right hand. Nevertheless, he succeeded in firing the bridge, and so prevented an attack by the Confederates. His second notable adventure took place at the Weldon Railroad, Virginia, August 19, 1864, after he had been promoted to be a lieutenant. On the evening of August 19, during a heavy rain, the Confederates charged with a yell. The brigade was on the extreme left with the brigade of regulars on the Maryland's right, who broke and ran. Later the Southerners retreated, and the Marylanders held the ground until the regulars were brought back. That night a regiment of the Marylanders was sent out on picket line, which they left and came into camp. Captain Taylor was detailed, with Captain McClellan, of General Ayer's staff, with 16 men and a sergeant, to reconnoiter the enemy's position. Leaving the men inside the lines, Captain McClellan, Captain Taylor, and the sergeant got through the enemy's lines and arrived near a house where Heath, the Confederate general, had his headquarters. Captain McClellan and Taylor started to return to their men, leaving the sergeant behind, but were captured on the way, the sergeant being taken shortly after. The Maryland Brigade was sent to Petersburg the next day and from there to Richmond, and remained in Libby Prison about two months, until Fort Harrison, some four miles below, was taken. Later on Captain Taylor managed to escape in company with two other officers. Captain Taylor entered the service as a sergeant in Company H, First Maryland Regiment, May 27, 1861; promoted second lieutenant Company C, April 12, 1863; Captain Company E, June 7, 1865. He was mustered out of service, with his company, July 2, 1865. Captain Taylor received a medal of honor for his gallantry at Front Royal, Va., May 23, 1862. In the battle of Petersburg, August 14, 1864, which lasted three hours, and when several of the color bearers were shot down, Captain Taylor took the banner and carried it until relieved by a newly appointed bearer. Captain Taylor was severely wounded in the leg, from which he never recovered.

He worked in several advertising companies and ghostwrote the 1917 novel Mary Louise Solves a Mystery to satisfy his ill father's publishing obligations. Early life Four-month-old Harry Neal Baum in 1890 Raised in Chicago, Baum was born in Aberdeen, South Dakota, on December 18, 1889, to Maud Gage and L. Frank Baum. The third son of L. Frank Baum, the author of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, he was named \\"Harry Neal Baum\\" to honor Harry Baum and Hattie and William Neal, L. Frank Baum's brother, sister, and brother-in-law, respectively. His brothers were Frank Joslyn, Robert Stanton, and Kenneth Gage. Career Baum received a Ph.D. in medieval history and wrote three history books for children and articles about his father. He coauthored with Olive Beaupr√© Miller the Book of History, a 1929 four-volume work published by The Bookhouse for Children. He served as a vice president of Burson-Marsteller. He worked as an advertising manager at Fairbanks-Morse before being employed at Gebhardt & Brockson, a Chicago-based advertising company. The Wizard of Oz and personal life L. Frank Baum dedicated his 1902 novel The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus to Harry. Because of L. Frank Baum's deteriorating health in 1917, he was unable to fulfill his obligations to his publishers. Therefore, Harry ghostwrote the 1917 novel Mary Louise Solves a Mystery, which was part of The Bluebird Books series, mimicking his father's style. In 1944, Harry starred as President Woodrow Wilson in the play The Time to Come produced by the Little Theater of Western Springs. He stated that he considered acting to be only a hobby. He had seen the opening production of The Wizard of Oz, which had been written by his father. Baum also served as the host of a number of annual meetings held by The International Wizard of Oz Club. At the 1964 convention, he awarded a gold plaque, the annual club's annual Oz award, to its founder Justin Schiller who had established the club when he was thirteen years old. Baum married Mary Niles in 1910. In 1942, he married Brenda Holter, a pianist and composer who served as the president of Chicago's Musicians Club of Women. Baum retired to Bass Lake, Indiana, at which he managed the Wizard of Oz lodge. Upon his death, on June 7, 1967, he was survived by his wife, Brenda.

One source states it is the largest known natural spring in the Southern Hemisphere. although the Te Waikoropup≈´ Springs in Golden Bay, New Zealand has been reliably measured at an average flow some 60 times greater (). The spring forms a small lake in the middle of the town, directly on the N14 road and is located in a fenced park. It has a daily flow of about of crystal-clear, potable water. Water from the spring supplies the town of Kuruman. History The town of Kuruman is located on the border of South Africa‚Äôs Northern Cape and North West provinces. The year 1895 was the only time in recorded history where the stream was constant throughout and moved from the eye, down the stream Kuruman river, Molopo River, Orange River and finally into the Atlantic Ocean. Originally, Tswana herders used the large spring as a water hole. In 1885, the British classified the area as part of the Crown Colony of British Bechuanaland. This classification of land prohibited the Tswana people from using the stream for any purpose. The upper Kuruman valley became a crown reserve and the Eye of Kuruman became the town site. Access to the valley became segregated by race in the twentieth century under the Union government. A modern irrigation project was operated by the municipality of Kuruman after 1918 and, in 1919 black cultivators were evicted from using water from the eye. However, black people continued to use the stream and moved 5 miles down the stream to Seodin. The water at the Seodin area had a much weaker stream making irrigation difficult for the Tswana people. The governments Department of Native Affairs drilled bore holes to assist the black farmers in 1940 however, this was still insufficient to sustain cultivation. In 1962, Apartheid legislation led to the forced removal of black people from Seodin. The ‚Äòwhites-only‚Äô irrigation project never commercialized despite state aid. Cave The Eye of Kuruman cave forms part of the eight caves on the dolomitic Ghaap Plateau of the Northern Cape. The Eye of Kuruman cave from which the springs emerge has been documented form as early as the nineteenth century. The first sketch of the cave was made in 1907 measuring a total of 138 meters. Description of Cave The dolomite cave has a series of cracks where streams of water flow. The streams of water travel through various passages and emerge together at the base of a cliff described as Die Oog in Afrikaans which translates as 'The Eye'. Biodiversity Both the air and water temperature of the cave is about with a relative humidity of about 99% The common bent-wing bat (Miniopterus schreibersii) and Geoffroy‚Äôs horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus clivosus) were recorded in the Eye of Kuruman cave in 1985. Due to high levels of humidity as well as consistent human disturbance, very few bats are now found in the cave. Aquatic animals that are found in the cave include: *the airbreathing catfish Clarias gariepinus *Tilapia spp *Rhagovelia, a water skater *Detritivores include: **unidentified Isopoda, **Diplopoda of the Polydesmida, **Psocoptera (psocidae) and **Ectobiidae *spiders of the families: **Amaurobiidae **Pholcidae and **Sicariidae Cixiidae survive by sucking the sap of plant roots that penetrate into the cave. There are also unidentified small flies (Diptera) in the cave.

It sailed in March 1944, reaching the Soviet northern ports in early April. All ships arrived safely. JW 58 was attacked by German U-boat and aircraft but suffered no losses. Three U-boats were destroyed and six aircraft were shot down during these operations. Ships The convoy consisted of 47 merchant ships which departed from Loch Ewe on 27 March 1944. It also included the US cruiser , which was being transferred to the Soviet navy as part of an agreement over the disposal of the surrendered Italian fleet. The convoy was joined from Iceland by three more ships en route from North America. Close escort was provided by a force led by Lt.Cdr Lambton in the destroyer . The force comprised two other destroyers and three corvettes. The force was supported by two escort carriers, and , which travelled with the convoy, and an \\"Ocean escort\\" of 17 fleet destroyers led by R.Adm. Frederick Dalrymple-Hamilton in the cruiser . JW 58 was joined by the 2nd Support Group (2nd sg0 the navy's most successful anti-submarine warfare group, consisting of five sloops led by Capt. Frederick Walker, in . The convoy was accompanied initially by local escort groups from Britain and Iceland, joined later by a local escort group from Murmansk.

These were the battleships and , the carrier , cruiser and six destroyers under the command of Vice-Admiral Bruce Fraser. Ranged against this force were the U-boats of the German arctic flotilla, 16 boats forming the patrol lines Blitz, Hammer and Thor. German surface forces and air forces were much diminished at this stage of the conflict; Tirpitz was still not operational after Operation Source when British X-Craft damaged the ship and the Luftwaffe was reduced to scouting and shadowing operations. Action An Avenger machine gun attack on U-288 on 3 April JW 58 departed Loch Ewe on 27 March 1944, accompanied by its local escort, the minesweeper Rattlesnake and two others, with two corvettes; On 29 March it met the Iceland contingent with its escort, the frigate Fitzroy and two A/S minesweepers. These were relieved by the Close escort and Ocean escort forces, and returned to base. On 29 March, Starling encountered U-961 in the Norwegian Sea. The U-boat was not part of the Arctic flotilla patrol lines but on passage to North Atlantic; she was unfortunate enough to encounter the RN force, was depth-charged and destroyed by Starling and Magpie of the 2nd SG.Kemp pp. 179-180; other sources say Starling and Wild Goose On 31 March JW 58 met first patrol line and for 48 hours the U-boat force mounted 18 attacks on the convoy.

In agricultural census counts, plantings of Magliocco Dolce are often grouped with the related, but distinct, red grape variety Magliocco Canino. Throughout history, numerous red southern Italian wine grape varieties have been variously known under the synonyms of \\"Magliocco\\" or \\"Magliocchi\\", most notably Gaglioppo, but recent DNA analysis has shown those grapes to be unrelated to Magliocco Dolce or Magliocco Canino.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 564-565 Allen Lane 2012 History Lago Arvo on the La Sila plateau where Magliocco Dolce may have originated. The first mention of a \\"Magliocca\\" grape dates to the late 15th century when it was documented growing in the Calabria region. However, which \\"Magliocco\\" grape this was is not yet known. Ampelographers have speculated that since the name Magliocco means \\"tender knot\\" in Greek that potentially Magliocco Dolce (or Magliocco Canino) could have originated in Greece. Additionally, Magliocco Dolce has been known under the synonym of Greco nero around the village of Lamezia Terme. However, DNA evidence in the early 21st century has cast doubt on the validity of that theory with it being far more likely that both grapes originated in southern Italy. The early synonym Arvino suggest that potentially Magliocco Dolce originated near Lago Arvo on the La Sila plateau that straddles the borders of the provinces of Catanzaro, Cosenza and Crotone in Calabria. Viticulture and confusion with other grapes Gaglioppo, one of the grapes that Magliocco Dolce is often confused with. Magliocco Dolce is a late ripening grape variety that tends to produce wines with high tannin levels due to the thick skins of its berries. Like Sangiovese and Savagnin, the grape variety is very prone to mutation with several clonal varieties of the grape found throughout Calabria. Over the years, Magliocco Dolce has been confused with several other red Italian grape varieties including Gaglioppo, Magliocco Canino, Castiglione (particularly around Locride), Nerello Mascalese (in Sicily) and Nocera. In fact, the vineyard samples of Nocera planted at the University of California-Davis were identified in the early 21st century as actually being Magliocco Dolce. Wine regions Most plantings of Magliocco Dolce can be found in northern and western Calabria in the provinces of Catanzaro, Cosenza and Crotone. Today Magliocco Dolce is found almost exclusively in Calabria though the exact number of plantings of the grape variety is hard to determine because for many years the grape was often confused and inter-planted in field blends with other varieties. Even in the official 2000 census, plantings of Magliocco Canino and Magliocco Dolce were counted together though ampelographers believe that most of the Calabrian plantings in the provinces of Catanzaro, Cosenza and Crotone of the reported are Magliocco Dolce. Synonyms Over the years, Magliocco Dolce has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Arvino (in the provinces of Cosenza and Crotone), Catanzarese, Gaddrica (around the village of Longobardi), Greco nero (around the village of Lamezia Terme), Guarnaccia (around the village of Verbicaro), Lacrima Cristi (in the provinces of Cozenza and Reggio Calabria), Magliocco Tondo, Maglioccuni (around the village of Bivongi), Mangiaguerra (around the village of Ricadi near Capo Vaticano), Marcigliana, Marsigliana (around the village Lamezia Terme), Merigallo (around the village of Terravecchia), Nera di Scilla (around the village of Scalea) and Petroniere.

The opposition candidate, Alassane Ouattara, and a number of countries, organisations and leaders worldwide claimed Ouattara had won the election. After months of attempted negotiation and sporadic violence, the crisis entered a decisive stage as Ouattara's forces began a military offensive in which they quickly gained control of most of the country and besieged key targets in Abidjan, the country's largest city. International organizations have reported numerous human rights violations, and the UN undertook its own military action with the stated objective to protect itself and civilians. A significant step in bringing an end to the crisis occurred on 11 April 2011 upon the capture and arrest of Gbagbo in Abidjan by pro-Ouattara forces backed by French forces. Announcement of results and post-election conflict On 2 December 2010, Youssouf Bakayoko, head of the Ivorian Commission Electorale Ind√©pendante (CEI), announced provisional results showing that Alassane Ouattara had won the Ivorian election of 2010 in the second round with 54.1% of the vote, against 45.9% for Laurent Gbagbo; he reported that turnout was 81.09%. Results had been expected and then postponed for days, beyond the deadline, and Bakayoko's appearance to announce the results‚Äîat an Abidjan hotel heavily guarded by the UN‚Äîtook the press by surprise.David Lewis and Loucoumane Coulibaly, \\"Ivory Coast's Ouattara wins vote ‚Äì election chief\\" , Reuters, 2 December 2010. Bakayoko reportedly chose to announce the results at the hotel, which Ouattara had been using as \\"his base\\", because he wanted to have the security of UN protection when doing so.David Lewis and Tim Cocks, \\"Ivory Coast seals borders after opposition win\\" , Reuters, 2 December 2010. Paul Yao N'Dre, the President of the Constitutional Council (a body that was viewed by the opposition as favoring Gbagbo, because N'Dre was considered an ally of the President), then took to the airwaves to say that the CEI had no authority left to announce any results, because it had already missed its deadline to announce them, and consequently the results were invalid.Christophe Koffi, \\"Ouattara named winner of I. Coast election\\", AFP, 2 December 2010. According to N'Dre, the passing of the deadline meant that only the Constitutional Council was \\"authorised to announce decisions on the contested results.\\" It was widely presumed that the Court would issue a ruling favoring Gbagbo, although the CEI's results indicated that Gbagbo could only be credited with victory if hundreds of thousands of votes were invalidated. At the heart of the dispute lies article 94 of the Constitution of C√¥te d'Ivoire, which reads: > The Constitutional Council shall control the regularity of the operations of > the referendum and proclaims the results. The Council shall decide on: : ‚Äì > the eligibility of the candidates to the presidential and legislative > elections; : ‚Äì the disputes concerning the election of the President of the > Republic and of the Deputies. The Constitutional Council shall proclaim the > final results of the presidential elections. Shortly after the announcements, the military sealed the country's borders. =Double victory claims= On 3 December, the Constitutional Council declared Gbagbo winner. N'Dre announced that the results in seven northern regions were cancelled, and on that basis declaring the outcome narrowly in favor of Gbagbo, who was credited with 51.45% of the vote while Ouattara had 48.55%.\\"Constitutional body names Gbagbo I. Coast election winner\\" , AFP, 3 December 2010.

Gbagbo was sworn in for another five-year term on 4 December, defiantly declaring: \\"I will continue to work with all the countries of the world, but I will never give up our sovereignty.\\" Sporadic violence and gunfire were reported in various parts of the country, including Abidjan.

Ouattara himself was sworn in separately shortly after, saying that \\"Ivory Coast is now in good hands\\". Ouattara then re-appointed Soro as his prime minister. =Reactions= Domestic There had been rallies from pro-Gbagbo and pro-Ouattara sides. Simone Gbagbo, wife of Laurent Gbagbo, gave a speech in the pro-Gbagbo rally on 15 January 2011. Ivorian forces have fired live bullets to disperse protesters. In Abobo, an Abidjan suburb and a stronghold of Ouattara's supporters, there were many violent clashes between security forces and civilians. Aya Virginie Toure organized over 40,000 women in peaceful protests that were violently repressed. In an impassioned interview on BBC News, Toure compared the ongoing Second Ivorian Civil War to the 2011 Libyan civil war and asked for support from the international community. She called for military intervention to remove Laurent Gbagbo from power the same way Charles Taylor was removed in the Second Liberian Civil War. United Nations On 18 December, a United Nations spokesperson said in response to a Gbagbo demand that foreign armed troops leave the country that the UN did not consider Gbagbo to be the president, and that peacekeepers would continue to support and protect both Alassane Ouattara and Ivorian citizens. On 23 December 2010, the United Nations Human Rights Council passed a resolution that \\"strongly condemned human rights violations that had taken place in C√¥te d'Ivoire...that occurred in different parts of C√¥te d'Ivoire in relation to the conclusion of the 2010 presidential election.\\" The resolution was criticized by Amnesty International as having insufficiently addressed the situation. International Angola and Lebanon were the only countries to send their ambassadors to Gbagbo's swearing-in.Despite Growing Pressure, Ivory Coast Incumbent Gbagbo Still Has Outside Allies VOA The African Union‚Äîwhich, like the United Nations, formally recognised Ouattara as the duly elected President‚Äîwarned that the conflicting results and subsequent political crisis could result in \\"incalculable consequences\\", and sent former President of South Africa Thabo Mbeki to mediate the issue. The US, UN, EU, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and former colonial power France affirmed their support to Ouattara. On 5 December, former President Thabo Mbeki held separate talks with Gbagbo and Ouattara, acting as a mediator. The African Union had appointed Mbeki to lead an emergency mission to C√¥te d'Ivoire \\"to facilitate the rapid and peaceful conclusion of the electoral process and the efforts to find a way out of the crisis.\\"Olivier Monnier and Pauline Bax. \\"Mbeki in Ivory Coast to Mediate as Gbagbo, Ouattara Each Claim Presidency .\\" Bloomberg, 5 December 2010.

Gabonese opposition leader Andr√© Mba Obame cited the events in Ivory Coast and the international recognition of Ouattara as Ivorian President as inspiration for declaring himself winner of the controversial 2009 Gabonese presidential election, sparking an ongoing political crisis in Gabon. On 28 December, presidents Yayi Boni of Benin, Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone and Pedro Pires of Cape Verde arrived in the country on behalf of ECOWAS, to convince Gbagbo to resign and go into exile for the sake of his country, while declaring it was Gbagbo's last chance before the deployment of military force against him. On 20 December, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told a news briefing that it was \\"time for [Gbagbo] to go\\" and that \\"We stand ready to impose targeted sanctions, individually and in concert with our partners around the world, on President Gbagbo, on his immediate family, on those who are associated with him and those who continue to cling to power illegitimately.\\"\\"White House: It's time for Gbagbo to go ,\\" Reuters, 20 December 2010. On 21 December, the United States Department of State announced that it had imposed travel sanctions against Gbagbo and 30 allies. William Fitzgerald, the deputy assistant secretary for African affairs, said that trade sanctions may be imposed against individuals. On 22 December, State Department spokesman Philip J.

Threats, violence and human rights violations Between December 2010 and March 2011, there was a series of sporadic outbreaks of violence between Gbagbo's militias and security forces and Ouattara's supporters, primarily in the city of Abidjan where both sides had large numbers of supporters. On 16 December 2010, clashes between opposition supporters and security forces in Abidjan and Yamoussoukro left 44 people dead. It was alleged that mass grave of opposition supporters had been dug in a pro-Gbagbo neighborhood in Abidjan, but security forces prevented UN investigators from going to the site to check the allegations.UN Mass Grave Probe Obstructed In Ivory Coast: NPR Another mass grave was reported to exist in the village of N'Dotre, guarded by government militias. Clashes between rival tribes seen as being pro-Gbagbo and pro- Ouattara killed 33 people in the central Ivorian city of Du√©kou√© 3 and 6 January 2011. Between 11 and 12 January 11 more people were killed when fighting broke out in Abidjan between security forces and Ouattara supporters, some of whom were using automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades, after the police attempted to conduct a raid in a pro-Ouattara district of Abidjan. The same area was the scene of further clashes on 21‚Äì22 February when police again attempted to raid it. 12 opposition supporters were killed when security forces fired machine guns and launched rocket-propelled grenades in the neighbourhood; the next day, opposition fighters ambushed government gendarmes (paramilitary police) and killed 10‚Äì15 of them. Gbagbo's supporters carried out a number of attacks during March, attacking foreign businesses and UN offices in Abidjan on 1 March and killing at least six people attending a pro- Ouattara rally in the city. The northern suburb of Abobo was attacked by Gbagbo's forces on 13 March in a bid to drive out pro-Ouattara supporters, and mobs were also reported to be roaming the city looking for their opponents and attacking or killing them. The violence resulted in 10 confirmed deaths and scores more wounded. Abobo came under heavy attack on 17 March, killing 30 people, when shells were into a crowded market from a nearby military barracks. It was unclear whether Gbagbo or Outtara supporters were responsible, though Abobo is generally pro-Ouattara. On 18 March, the UN issued a statement saying that the shelling was \\"an act, perpetrated against civilians, [that] could constitute a crime against humanity.\\" Another 52 people were killed in continuing violence in Abidjan between 21‚Äì26 March. Opposition figure Guillaume Soro charged that Gbagbo's security forces and Liberian mercenaries had waged a campaign of terror, and that death squads had been responsible for 200 deaths, 1,000 people wounded from gunfire, 40 disappearances and 732 arrests. He told The Guardian that \\"women have been beaten, stripped, assaulted and raped. When will the international community realise that a murderous insanity has begun in Ivory Coast?\\" Amnesty International said it had received increasing reports of atrocities in the country. By March 2011, an estimated 450,000+ Ivorians had left the country, of which 370,000 were from the capital city of Abidjan. On 10 March 2011, it was announced that Gbagbo had banned all French and UN aircraft from Ivorian airspace, with exceptions only if the transport ministry approved. The ban was not challenged by the UN, which continued to fly helicopters despite the order; allies of Ouattara said Gbagbo had no legal authority with which to enforce the ban. Approximately 1,800 people, including children and civil servants, have taken refuge in Abidjan's Saint Paul's Cathedral since the beginning of the crisis. Both pro-Outtara and pro-Gbagbo forces were accused of having participated in the 28‚Äì29 March Du√©kou√© massacre, where hundreds of civilians were killed. When asked by U.N. secretary general Ban Ki-moon, Outtara denied the accusation against his force but agreed to conduct an investigation. Peaceful protests Numerous peaceful protests of nonviolent resistance have been organized in Ivory Coast and internationally in support of a peaceful resolution to the ongoing crisis. In December 2010, several street protests were held in Abidjan. Hundreds of women joined the protests and banged pots as a warning about the arrival of the militias. The protesters were met with heavily armed security forces firing into the crowd and killing civilians. In February 2011, hundreds of youth protested in Abobo, a neighborhood of Abidjan. One man and one woman were killed by security forces who opened fire and used tear gas to disperse the crowd. On 3 March 2011, 15,000 women held a peaceful protest in Abidjan. Some were dressed in black, some were wearing leaves, and some were naked, all signs of an African curse directed toward Laurent Gbagbo. In the neighborhood of Abobo, they were met by security forces with tanks that allegedly opened fire on the women. Seven women were killed and approximately 100 were wounded. Gbagbo's police officers always denied any involvement of their forces, and Gbagbo's supporters argue that this incident is an elaborate hoax, claiming that the available video footage can hardly match the story. On 8 March, International Women's Day, 45,000 women held peaceful protests across the country. The women were met with youth armed with machetes and automatic weapons firing into the air at Koumassi. One woman and three men were killed in Abidjan by the army. Outbreak of violent conflict Map of the March 2011 Republican Forces offensive As the violence continued in Abidjan, heavy fighting broke out in western C√¥te d'Ivoire at the end of February 2011 as the newly renamed Republican Forces of C√¥te d'Ivoire (RFCI) sought to close the border with Liberia, from where Gbagbo was reported to have recruited numerous fighters. A series of western towns fell to the RFCI between 25 February and 21 March as it advanced beyond the ceasefire line from the previous civil war. On 28 March the RFCI launched a country-wide military offensive as Ouattara declared that all peaceful solutions had been \\"exhausted\\". After heavy fighting in some central Ivorian towns, the RFCI advanced rapidly across the country to seize towns along the eastern border with Ghana, the political capital Yamoussoukro and the key port of San P√©dro. By 31 March the RFCI had reached Abidjan as fighting broke out in the city, with Gbagbo loyalists falling back to the area around the presidential palace. United Nations and French forces joined the fighting on 4 April with helicopter attacks on heavy weapons being used by Gbagbo's forces. Electricity and water to the northern half of the country were also cut 2 March, with no immediate explanation for either event. =Status of Gbagbo and Ouattara= On 18 December 2010, Gbagbo ordered peacekeeping forces from the United Nations and France to leave the country; the government issued a statement saying that it \\" demands the departure of the United Nations Operation in C√¥te d'Ivoire and Operation Unicorn forces in Ivory Coast and is opposed to any renewal of their mandate.\\" In January 2011, Gbagbo requested a recount of the votes, along with the creation of a committee composed of international members that would oversee the recount. He also engaged in a diplomatic campaign to gain support from countries like Zimbabwe, while at the same time expelling ambassadors from the United Kingdom and Canada, countries that did not recognize his leadership. After the election, Gbagbo initially retained control of the country's armed forces and the state media, but in part due to the international sanctions which limited Gbagbo's financing abilities, this control gradually crumbled and the offensive by Ouattara forces caused much of Gbagbo's armed forces to defect. Ouattara was at the first floor of the Golf Hotel in Abidjan while Gbagbo remained at the presidential palace. The hotel was guarded by about 800 UN peacekeepers, who had encircled the site with coiled razor wire and guarded the premises with white UN armored personnel carriers and security checks for visitors. According to local UN mission chief Choi Young-jin, troops loyal to Gbagbo (about 3,000 militiamen according to an Ouattara spokesman) occupied the neighborhood surrounding the Golf Hotel and set up a blockade that prevented UN trucks from bringing food, water and medicine to the hotel; UN trucks were sent each day but had been turned back every time. Ouattara had a pirate radio station inside the hotel that broadcast campaign songs, speeches from Ouattara, and statements by his spokesman. However, technicians working for Gbagbo had jammed the signal and so as to change frequencies several times a day. During early March 2011, Ouattara traveled to Ethiopia to meet with an African Union (AU) council tasked with finding a solution to the conflict. Gbagbo refused to attend the meeting, which resulted in the AU confirming Ouattara as the victor in the elections. It was the first time he had left the Golf Hotel since the election was held. Reactions =Media= Reporters Without Borders observed that public media had been neutral in its coverage of the candidates, but it also noted that Gbagbo's campaign had received a substantially larger amount of coverage.\\"I.Coast presidential challenger seeks to unify opposition\\", AFP, 10 November 2010. Reporters have been threatened by armed forces sympathetic to Gbagbo. International radio stations, including France 24, BBC and RFI, were stopped from broadcasting on 2 March. =Economy and financial markets= The West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) recognises Ouattara as the winner of the 2010 election. The bank of issue of UEMOA is the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO)). The governor of BCEAO, Philippe-Henry Dacoury-Tabley, seen as an ally of Gbagbo, was forced to resign by West African leaders on 21 January 2011. Ouattara said that the continuing crisis hurts the economy. As a declining economy threatens the status of C√¥te d'Ivoire, as the largest producer of cocoa in the world, a revival hinged on the outcome of the election. The internationally traded price for cocoa and white sugar fell in the week prior to the election on speculation that the election would spur production. On 24 January 2011, the cocoa price soared following Ouattara's announcement that coffee and cocoa exports would be banned for a month in hope to cut off the funding for Gbagbo. Ivory Coast was also forced to default on a $2.3 billion bond as a result of the crisis. On 9 February 2011 onwards the Abidjan stock exchange remained closed after Gbagbo's loyalist forces invaded its offices. The following day it reopened. The regional stock exchange Bourse Regionale des Valeurs Mobilieres moved \\"temporarily\\" to Bamako, Mali after Gbagbo's troops attacked its office in Abidjan. During the week from 14 to 18 February, four banks had suspended their operations, and Gbagbo in response nationalized them on 17 February. Most of the cash machines in Abidjan had been empty or out of service and people rushed to the banks to withdraw their cash. Reports suggested a cash crisis in the country due to a lack of capital inflows and runs on banks forcing national financial institutions to also deplete their reserves. Several banks ceased operations in the country. The move led to Gbagbo loyalist forces to have \\"nationalised\\" those banks and \\"requisitioned\\" cash from the Central Bank's Abidjan bureau. The opposition said these actions amounted to robbery. =International= On 23 March, at the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Summit in Nigeria, a \\"One Thousand Women March\\" was organised by peace activists in West Africa in support of the women in the Ivory Coast. They wore white T-shirts and represented countries across West Africa including C√¥te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo. On 6 April, in Canada outside the French consulate in Montreal, demonstrators protested against France's military intervention in Ivory Coast and asked for humanitarian corridors to be opened in Abidjan. On 8 April, in Ireland outside the French embassy in Dublin, demonstrators protested against the international community's \\"military invasion\\" of Ivory Coast. After the fall of Gbagbo =Human rights= Human rights remained as an issue. In May 2011, Amnesty International reported that both pro-Gbagbo and pro-Ouattara sides had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in the conflict. On 20 July 2011, Ouattara inaugurated a commission to investigate the violation of human rights during the conflict. Reporters Without Borders asked for the release of a detained pro-Gbagbo journalist. The personnel director of the company that published Le Temps, a newspaper close to FPI, was briefly arrested on 24 May 2011 and then released in the same day. The Republican Forces of C√¥te d'Ivoire occupied the seat of Notre Voie, a newspaper close to FPI, from April to the beginning of September. =Continuance of violence= According to Human Right Watch, the violence still persisted. Pro-Gbagbo militias had killed at least 220 people during the days immediately before or after the arrest of Gbagbo. In June 2011, it was reported that at least 149 actual or suspected pro-Gbagbo partisans had been killed by the force of Ouattara since April. In August, similar events committed by the force of Ouattara were reported again by the media. A summary of a press conference of UNOCI in August reported several confrontations between FRCI and youths in Ores-Krobou, Abadjin-Kout√©, Abadjin-Doum√©, Akoup√©- Zeudji, and Bi√©by. At the night between 24‚Äì25 April 2012, Sakr√©, a village in the Southwest near Liberia was attacked by an armed group equipped with heavy weapons including rockets, leaving 8 deaths. =Politics= On 1 June 2011, Guillaume Soro formed a new government. No one in the cabinet came from the pro-Gbagbo camp. Guillaume Soro is the prime minister and minister of defence. The mandate of Choi Young-ji ended on 31 August, and Albert Gerard Koenders became the new UN Special Representative for C√¥te d'Ivoire on 1 September. On 28 September, Commission dialogue, v√©rit√© et r√©conciliation (CDVR) (English: Dialogue, Truth, and Reconciliation Commission) was inaugurated in Yamoussoukro. It is an 11-member commission headed by former Prime Minister Charles Konan Banny. The commission includes religious leaders, regional representatives, and Chelsea footballer Didier Drogba to speak for Ivorians living abroad. It is modelled after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa. However, Konan Banny expressed that the commission would not have amnesty powers nor powers to absolve anyone. A legislative election was announced in September and held on 11 December. It was the first legislative election since 2000, due to the crisis in 2002. Ouattara hoped that new legislators could be elected before the major development projects announced in the presidential campaign start. The election was boycotted by FPI, Gbagbo's party, and was won by the parties of Ouattara and his allies. The atmosphere of the election was calm, but the turnout was low. =Economy= On 27 June 2011, UN lifted the last sanctions against Ivorian enterprises, including Radiodiffusion t√©l√©vision ivoirienne (RTI), Association des producteurs de caoutchouc naturel de C√¥te d'Ivoire (APROCANCI), and Soci√©t√© de gestion du patrimoine de l'√©lectricit√© (SOGEPE). On 8 July 2011, IMF resumed the aid to C√¥te d'Ivoire. On 25 October, the United States announced that C√¥te d'Ivoire, excluded since 2005, was again eligible for the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which gives trade preferences to eligible countries. On 3 August 2012, the first commercial court of C√¥te d'Ivoire was set up in Abidjan, with the aim of encouraging the investment and the economical development. =Military= On 3 August 2011, Ouattara promoted several important and controversial ex-chiefs in the New Forces who were said to have brought Ouattara to his position. Among those promoted was Martin Fofi√© Kouakou, appointed as the new commandant of Korhogo, who had been accused of being involved in extrajudicial executions by UN. =Gbagbo's capture= Gbagbo was arrested on 11 April. From April to August, he and his wife, Simone, were under house arrest in separate locations in northern parts of the country. Gbagbo was sent to Korhogo and Simone to Odienn√©. Gbagbo and his wife were charged with economic crimes in August. The charges included looting, armed robbery and embezzlement. The government, citing its incompetence, has requested the involvement of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the investigation of violence related crimes. On 3 October, the judges of ICC authorized its prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo to probe post-election war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by forces loyal to both Gbagbo and Ouattara.http://www.france24.com/en/20111129-i-coasts-gbagbo-faces-transfer- war-crimes-court With an arrest warrant issued on 23 November and made known to the public on 29 November, Gbagbo was sent from C√¥te d'Ivoire on 29 November and arrived in a prison in Scheveningen, a suburb of the Hague, on 30 November.

He previously played in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Spain. Pezzuti was member of the Argentine squad that won the 1995 FIFA World Youth Championship in Qatar. Club career Pezzuti began his career at Argentine giant Racing Club; he was promoted to the first team in 1997, two years after winning the 1995 FIFA World Youth Championship held in Qatar. He made his competitive debut in the 1‚Äì1 draw against Ferro Carril Oeste. In 2002, he was loaned to Lan√∫s, and then returned to Racing on June of the next year. In 2005, Pezzuti was signed to Chilean Primera Divisi√≥n side Deportes Concepci√≥n, this being his first transfer to a foreign club. He made his debut for the purples in a 2‚Äì0 away win over Coquimbo Unido in a league game. Pezzuti was the first-team goalkeeper of a good Concepci√≥n team that qualified to the quarter-finals of the championship. After his spell in Chile, he returned to his country to play in the recently promoted team in the Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n Instituto de C√≥rdoba and then he joined Spanish club Real Oviedo, remaining in Europe a short time.

One of the factors that helped in his transfer to the verdolaga club was the signing of his former coach of Lan√∫s, Ram√≥n Cabrero, who managed the player at that club in 2003 and requested Pezzuti as the club's first goalkeeper. He made his club debut on 10 July 2009 in a 1‚Äì1 draw with La Equidad. Because his good performances for the club, Pezzuti was promoted to captain of the club for the 2010 season, that was disappointing for Atl√©tico, failing to win the championship, one of the season's objectives. Pezzuti was supposed to leave the team, as his contract ended in 2011, but shortly after it was renewed for one more season. In 2011, Pezzuti was established as figure and idol of the team, after saving three penalties during the 2011 Apertura final's penalty kicks against La Equidad, winning the championship.

It is native to Baja California, Sinaloa and Sonora in Mexico.  Taxonomy  There are two subspecies recognised: *Trachemys nebulosa nebulosa ‚Äì from Baja California. *Trachemys nebulosa hiltoni Fuerte slider ‚Äì from Sinaloa and Sonoro.  Description  The Baja California slider is a medium-sized turtle and identified for their clawed digits, non-elephantine hind limbs and a wide- colored suborbital patch. They have smooth shells, rounded posteriorly and straight interiorly. These shells are longer than they are wide, have a low later profile and can reach up to 37 cm (14.5 inches) in length. On the ventral side of the shell is yellow with symmetrical black markings. Dorsally the shell is dark in color with the vertebral, costal and marginal scutes having dark black spots surrounded by lighter margins. The Baja California slider has a large, triangular shaped head which is covered by smooth skin. They have protruding non-hooked snouts where the nostrils are located decently high and large eyes. The top of the head is olive colored with indistinct pale lines while the chin and throat are lighter with central yellow markings; there is a pair of yellow stripes that extend anteriorly across the local jaw and onto the upper jaw. Their tails are moderately long while male's tails being longer than females. The bodies are covered with multiple yellow stripes including the forelimbs, not the hind limbs.  Distribution and habitat  The Baja California slider has an exceedingly limited geographic range, currently found from San Ignacio southward into Baja California Sur. They were endemic only to the R√≠o San Jos√© basin in the greater Cabo San Lucas area (where they are now exceedingly rare due to over fishing) but as early as the late 1700s they were transported northwards by natives to provide a continuing food source. They prefer larger bodies of water with muddy bottoms, often seen basking on emerged rocks or floating logs. Most activity takes place between mid-March and October as well as the winter months by burying themselves into the mud.

McArthur, 531 U.S. 326 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case decided in 2001. The case concerned the extent of the government‚Äôs power to limit an individual‚Äôs complete control of his or her home pending the arrival of a search warrant. A divided Court held that the search was not unconstitutional because there was a reasonable law-enforcement need to acquire a warrant, namely, to prevent the potential destruction of evidence within the home.. Background Tera McArthur asked two police officers to accompany her to a trailer home where she lived with her husband Charles, so that she could take her belongings out of the home. Just after she came out of the trailer, she told the police that Charles McArthur had drugs inside. The police knocked and asked Charles if they could search, which he refused. He then came out of the trailer; an officer prevented him from going back inside while the other policeman rushed to get a warrant.531 U.S. at 329-330. The Illinois Appellate Court held that this action violated the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures without a warrant.People v. McArthur, 304 Ill. App. 3d 395, 713 N.E.2d 93 (1999), leave to appeal denied, 185 Ill. 2d 651, 720 N.E.2d 1101 (1999). The Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the case in 2000.. Opinion of the Court The Court voted 8-1 to reverse the Illinois Appellate Court to hold the actions of the police officers at question constitutional. Justice Breyer wrote the majority opinion which upheld the search. Due to the specific circumstances of the case, the police needed to prevent the investigation scene from being contaminated. Breyer wrote that the Court found \\"no case in which [we have] held unlawful a temporary seizure that was supported by probable cause and was designed to prevent the loss of evidence while the police diligently obtained a warrant in a reasonable period of time.\\"531 U.S. at 334. Moreover, McArthur's argument that his decision to remain on his porch and not allow the police entry did not amount to \\"a constructive eviction\\". Instead, Breyer noted that the Court found in a prior case that the doorway of a house is in a 'public place' and thus not subject to warrant rules. He noted in conclusion that the hard-to- contest fact of probable cause made it difficult to accept McArthur's claims. =Souter's concurrence= Justice Souter joined Breyer's opinion in all respects but wrote separately to condition his support on the belief that the search was appropriate only because of the immediate danger that the evidence could have been destroyed. Only in this unique instance could the warrant requirement be waived.531 U.S. at 339 (Souter, J., concurring). =Stevens' dissent= Justice Stevens wrote a brief dissenting opinion arguing that the case should have been dismissed because the Illinois legislature has largely reduced penalties for marijuana possession, which made it ridiculous for the officers to rush to get a warrant. He said that even if he reached the merits of the question, he would affirm and hold the search unconstitutional because the majority misapplied a balancing of ‚Äúprivacy-related and law enforcement- related concerns\\".531 U.S. at 340 (Stevens, J., dissenting). He wanted to give broader protection to the idea of the home as a place for protection, even if the home in this case was a trailer.531 U.S. at 341. See also * Mapp v. Ohio (1961) * Terry v.

Moderation can take place at both ideological and behavioural levels that mutually reinforce each other. The origins of the theory go back to the work of Robert Michels who offers a classical study of the Social Democratic Party of Germany in his book Political Parties. The theory offers insights into the transformation of party politics in a great range of cultural and historical cases including socialist and Christian democratic parties in Western Europe and more recently Islamic political groups. In particular, the evolution of Islamic political parties in Turkey since the early 1970s that culminated in the rise of the Justice and Development Party in the 2002 parliamentary elections exemplifies the dynamics highlighted by moderation theory. The theory is composed of three causal mechanisms. First, once radical political groups are organized as vote-seeking parties, electoral considerations prevail and these groups abandon revolutionary agendas in favour of vote-maximizing strategies. This expectation is based on the median voter theorem. A second mechanism concerns the vulnerability of radical political groups participating in electoral contest to state repression. The logic of political survival necessitates that these groups avoid openly confronting state elites. The final mechanism involves the effects of organizational resources on group behaviour and suggests that the maintenance of electoral organization is prioritized over original political goals. Once radicals are organized as electoral parties, their original projects of revolutionizing the political system becomes unachievable simply because of the lack of organizational resources. While moderation of radicals is generally thought to be conducive to democratization, it can also hamper and even hinder democratic progress as radicals are co-opted into the ruling political system and lose their reformist characteristics. In contemporary times, moderation theory is further developed and critically refined to understand the evolution of Islamic political parties in Muslim majority countries as diverse as Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, and Turkey. The Center Party (Hizb al-Wasat) of Egypt is example of a moderate Islamic organization that was not given license by the ruling regime. Moreover, Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt has transformed into an organization that is responsive to the logic of political competition and survival in an authoritarian regime at the cost of its original ideological commitments. Similarly, the Islamic Action Front of Jordan shows that Islamists can be moderate as a result of participation in pluralistic political process as long as this participation can be justified in Islamic terms.

It is located north of Bedford, Virginia. It was closed in 1975. History Bedford AFS was established by Air Defense Command in 1954 as part of a planned deployment of forty-four Phase I Mobile Radar stations. It was one of twenty-nine stations which were sited around the perimeter of the country to support the permanent ADC network of seventy-five stations. The deployment had been projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment The 649th Airborne Control and Warning Squadron achieved beneficial occupancy by 1 December 1954. Operational status was achieved in 1956 with the activation of the AN/MPS-8 and AN/MPS-11 radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. By 1958 the AN/MPS-8 had been superseded by a pair of AN/FPS-6 height-finder radars. In 1959 an AN/FPS-20A search radar replaced the AN/MPS-11 set. During 1959 Bedford AFB joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-04 at Fort Lee AFS, Virginia. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 649th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 October 1959. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In 1960 this site also began performing air traffic control duties for the FAA. In 1963 the search radar was upgraded and redesignated as an AN/FPS-67. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-121. Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The 649th was inactivated and the Air Force closed the facility on 30 June 1975. Afterward the FAA took over the facility, and today it is an active Joint Surveillance System (JSS) site, now operating an ARSR-3 Long Range Air Route Surveillance Radar. Most of the buildings on the site have been torn down, the housing and GATR site have been obliterated as well.

It was the neighborhood cinema for the Druid Hills, Virginia Highland and Poncey-Highland neighborhoods of Atlanta. It is an anchor of the Briarcliff Plaza on Ponce de Leon Avenue, Atlanta's first shopping center with off-street parking. The first film screened was the Joan Crawford-Norma Shearer vehicle The Women.Access Points 22: Plaza Theatre in Poncey-Highland  Inside Access Several \\"big films\\" had second runs at the Plaza Theatre after having played their roadshow release downtown. Among them were Around the World in 80 Days (1956) and King of Kings (1961). In the 1970s, the Plaza became an X-rated adult cinema and live burlesque theatre, screening such risqu√© fare as Teeny Buns and Swinging Sorority, until the entire shopping center was renovated by current owner Robert Griffith. In 1983, movie theatre entrepreneur George LeFont bought the theatre and renovated the 1000-seat space by converting the balcony area into a second auditorium.Cinema Treasures  Plaza Theatre The LeFont era witnessed an influx of independent, foreign, and art-house movies that would become the norm from 1983 to the present. The 1990s and 2000s witnessed a financial struggle for the Plaza, and the theatre was put up for sale in 2006.'The Plaza' profiles - you guessed it - The Plaza Theatre  Atlanta Movies & TV Blog  Movie Reviews, TV Recaps  Screen Grab  Creative Loafing Atlanta =2006 - 2014= In late 2006, Atlanta natives Jonathan and Gayle Rej purchased the theatre, and in early 2010, the Plaza Theatre Foundation became a nonprofit organization. Retaining the original marquee and many of the original furnishings, the Plaza Theatre became the longest continuously operating theatre in Atlanta.[1] Since 2000, the fan group Lips Down on Dixie has hosted Atlanta's contribution to The Rocky Horror Picture Show cult following, screening the film at midnight every Friday, with pre-show activities and a \\"shadow cast\\" live performance and audience participation simultaneous with the movie.[8] In the 2000s, the Silver Scream Spookshow was hosted at The Plaza by Atlanta horror personality \\"Professor Morte\\". The show paired live comic and burlesque performances with screenings of classic science fiction movies, including Creature from the Black Lagoon, Frankenstein, and many films in the Godzilla franchise. Similarly, Splatter Cinema has brought re-creations of grisly movie scenes to the Plaza's lobby, paired with screenings of classic horror films such as Herschell Gordon Lewis's Blood Feast and Two Thousand Maniacs!, as well as movies in the Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street series.[9] Also during the 2000s, The Plaza screened many other classic films, including Easy Rider, Back to the Future, Five Easy Pieces, as well as showcases of local independent films. In 2010, the Plaza celebrated its 70th anniversary with screenings of 1939 films, including The Wizard of Oz and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington; Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies co-hosted the event.[10] The Plaza also hosted the Atlanta premiere for the film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World; Scott Pilgrim stars Michael Cera and Jason Schwartzman and director Edgar Wright were present at the premiere.[11] Similarly, the director of the emerging cult film The Room, Tommy Wiseau, made guest appearances at the theatre in 2010 and 2012. In early 2013, the Plaza Theatre was sold to theatre enthusiast Michael Furlinger, underwent extensive alterations to its original appearance, and began screening mainstream films such as the Angry Birds and The Smurfs movies. In late 2017, the theatre was sold to Christopher Escobar, also the Executive Director of the Atlanta Film Society, and has been returning to its former appearance, showcases, performances, and independent and international films.

He served as a top advisor to Chief Ndamble. During the Xhosa Wars, he instigated a failed attack against the town of Grahamstown, South Africa. Personal life Makhanda was born near the coast around 1780 in the Uitenhage area of the Eastern Cape. His father was a Xhosa named Gwala of the amaCwerha clan and his mother was a Khoikhoi of the Gqunukhwebe clan. After Makhanda's father died when he was a young boy, he was brought up by his mother strongly influenced by her people's Gqunukhwebe traditions. His mother was a spiritual diviner and medicine woman. Makhanda was later recognised as an ‚Äò'inyanga,'‚Äô which seemed rooted in the early guidance of his mother and her traditions. The Xhosa also particularly held the Khoikhoi and San spiritual guides in high esteem. His mother took him and his siblings to the Great Fish River Valley, where they lived with his foster father Balala. It is unclear when Makhanda encountered Christianity. Missionary Dr James van der Kemp had established a mission station in Bethelsdorp in 1799, and Makhanda may have met him. Makhanda advocated peace and denounced the use of magic after converting to Christianity. During his days as an itinerant preacher, he was attacked by a gang of detractors. He was rescued by Qalanga, a councillor of Chief Ndlambe. Qalanga introduced Makhanda to the royal chief of the Rharhab. Around 1812 Chief Ndlambe appointed Makhanda as an advisor and military doctor. As a royal appointee, Makhanda had discussions with the Rev. Vanderlingen, the chaplain at Grahamstown, and with missionary John Read, about theology and cosmology. During this period, Makhanda slowly increased his following and influence among the Rarhabe. Up to 1816, he viewed missionaries as coworkers in the same cause. Missionary Read described Makhanda as ‚Äúa stout and handsome man, who commands respect.‚Äù In 1816, Makhanda's attitude towards missionaries changed. Having grown up in areas with Afrikaner farmers, he had firsthand knowledge of their mistreatment of blacks. To Makhanda, Christianity represented European culture. Makhanda and all of the amaXhosa had an understanding that the British, as the Dutch before them, were seeking to take their land from them. From the late 1760s, when the Boer trek farmers started moving into their lands, until the brutal expulsion of the Gqunukwebe and other Xhosa from the Zuurveld in 1812, the Europeans had demonstrated a desire to expand into Xhosa territory. Makhanda viewed the emerging conflict between European and African world views as a contest between Thixo, the god of the whites, and Mdalidiphu (creator of the deep), the god of the blacks. He began to preach a fusion of these religions to reconcile them, leaning toward Xhosa beliefs.  Battle of Grahamstown  In 1818 at the Battle of Amalinde, Makana fought alongside a combined force of the Xhosa against Chief Ngqika, who was considered to be selling out his people in return for personal gain as an ally of the British Empire. When a British-led force commanded by Colonel Brereton seized 23,000 head of cattle from Ndlambe‚Äôs people in retaliation, Makhanda urged all the Xhosa to unite to try to drive British forces out of Xhosaland once and for all. Makhanda advised Ndlambe that the gods would be on their side if they chose to strike back at the British at Grahamstown, and promised that the British \\"bullets would turn to water\\".22 April 1819: The fifth Frontier War: Sangoma Makana attacks Grahamstown under the patronage of Xhosa Chief Ndlambe, and is defeated - South African History Online Ndlambe took Makana‚Äôs advice, and on 22 April 1819 Makana led an raid on Grahamstown in broad daylight with a force of about 6,000 men (some sources say 10,000 men), all under the overall command of Ndlambe's son Mdushane. They were accompanied by women and children, prepared to occupy the British land. The British garrison of approximately 350 troops was able to repulse the attack only after timely support was received from a Khoikhoi group led by Jan Boesak. Defeated by superior British firepower and poor tactics by the amaNdlambe leadership, Makana eventually had no choice but to surrender himself. The British imprisoned him on Robben Island, but treated him with great respect, giving him private accommodation, food and furniture. On 25 December 1820, Makana escaped along with 30 other prisoners, mostly Xhosa and Khoisan rebels from the Eastern frontier districts. Although several survived, Makana drowned. Since he had promised his people he would never abandon them, they continued to hope for his return for another 50 years before funeral rites were observed. Legacy Makhanda is regarded as one of the first Africans to attempt a cultural synthesis of African and European beliefs. He is also credited with attempting to unite the Xhosa in their struggle against the British Empire. Twentieth-century political prisoners on Robben island, including Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe, later called for renaming that island after Makana. *The Makana Local Municipality and the city of Makhanda, formerly known as Grahamstown, have been named after him. *Makana F.A., a sporting body formed by political prisoners on Robben Island during the apartheid years, was named for him.Origins of Tournament in an Infamous Prison ‚Äî New York Times, July 5 2010  South African Ship  * The SAS Makhanda was named after him.

Early life  Like Karl May, Heinz Werner H√∂ber was born in Saxony. He also had in common with Karl May that he had been born into a rather poor family. His father introduced him to the works of Karl May in order to give him an incentive to improve his reading skills. Consequently, the young Heinz Werner H√∂ber started writing early his own Wild West stories, dreaming about having a career like Karl May, who had finally escaped poverty for good once he had published his famous tales about the fictional Wild West pioneer Old Shatterhand and the Native American Winnetou. After the war Heinz Werner H√∂ber befriended a Russian officer and on his way to West Germany he had the opportunity to visit the Karl May museum in Radebeul. According to \\"Der Mann, der Jerry Cotton war\\" (\\"The man who had been Jerry Cotton\\") the museum had been closed down for an unknown period of time, but the administrator gave him a sightseeing tour anyway after his Russian friend had emphasised that he carried a gun. But before H√∂ber became a published writer he accomplished his school education.  Career  After some futile attempts to thrive as an actor, a comedian or a playwright he started writing pulp fiction. That was when many Germans read pulp fiction on a regular basis because there was only one TV programme. H√∂ber gained the attention of Gustav L√ºbbe (of Bastei L√ºbbe publishing) when he was looking for somebody who could deliver new adventures of Jerry Cotton. The first author of Jerry Cotton had grown tired of his creation and of writing pulp fiction in general. H√∂ber became his successor and led Jerry Cotton to new heights. He worked diligently on the new stories and, driven by his ambitions to walk in the footsteps of Karl May, he performed a lot of research on the FBI and on New York. He also invented an American Indian sidekick called Zeerokah for Jerry Cotton. But as opposite to Karl May he didn't reach any fame because allegedly the G-man Jerry Cotton wrote all his tales himself. H√∂ber received only an all-inclusive fee for each novel, not considering the amplitude of the publisher's profit. So Heinz Werner H√∂ber followed his cherished idol Karl May another time by meeting his own publisher in court. He demanded recognition as the main author of Jerry Cotton and a significant part of the profit. He was neither the actual creator of Jerry Cotton nor at any time the only author of the series. Although he was considered to probably be most productive and certainly most committed of the about 100 writers. He had also never been promised to be named or to receive royalties. Therefore, the trial did not make him rich but ruined him. Still he had eventually reached a high profile, could publish books under his real name and won the highly accredited Glauser Award.

Publicity Globe of Death sword swallow In 2014 Johnny Strange made headlines in several national and international newspapers after teaming up with stunt rider, Vesko Lesev, to perform a unique sword swallowing stunt in Brussels, Belgium, when he became the first person to swallow a sword inside the Globe of death. Strange swallowed a 17-inch long sword blade while standing in the centre of a 5-meter round steel mesh ball as a motorbike rode around him at speeds in excess of 40 mph (70 km/h). Strange has been quoted as saying that it took three years of practising to master the art of sword swallowing, and that he had to practice daily to achieve it. He went on to say; \\"I have been performing sword swallowing for a few years now, it is extremely dangerous. Lesev is a great rider, the skill he shows in the Globe of Death fascinates me but teaming up was still no easy decision to make. There is a lot of trust needed on both parties as one false move could have had devastating consequences for either of us. I have performed in Belgium before but have never performed in Brussels until now, there was an amazing atmosphere and the audiences throughout the weekend were fantastic.\\" Because of the inherent danger and dedication required to perform such a stunt there are very few sword swallowers in the world, with the Sword Swallowers Association International (SSAI) listing Johnny Strange as one of Europe's last actively performing professional sword swallowers.http://www.swordswallow.com/performers.php/: Actively Performing Professional Sword Swallowers.

Early life  George Weir was born in Upton upon Severn, Worcestershire, on 1 December 1876 to Dr Archibald Weir of Malvern. He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1917, he married Margaret Irene, daughter of Robert More of Bexhill; the couple had a son and a daughter.  Military career  Weir served in South Africa between 1899 and 1901 as a non-commissioned volunteer in the Worcestershire Yeomanry and was mentioned in despatches twice and awarded four clasps to his Queen's Medal. After about six months, he was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant and transferred into the Regular Army on 11 January 1902 as a Captain in the 3rd Dragoon Guards. By 1914, Weir had passed staff college and attained the rank of Major.

The film has been released in theatres of only 13 countries worldwide. The film was held back without a release date from 2011 until 2013. Plot Molly Morris, a private investigator based in Dallas, takes photos of cheating men. During one of her investigations, FBI Agent Armon Ranford offers her a job with the FBI, to watch over Alex Patrone, the daughter of a Senator, who was involved in an organized-crime case. Molly is reluctant at first, but ultimately decides to accept Ranford's offer. She goes undercover as a sorority student named Brooke Stonebridge, and receives help from her father. She meets Sasha Stolezinsky, the head of the sorority, and other members, including Becky, Cotton, Hunter, and Alex, whom she has been hired to protect. At first, she thinks that Sasha may be a suspect, but as it turns out, she only changed her identity from Suzy Walters so she could start a new life rather than continue to be an outcast. Molly also meets her love interest, Nicholas Dexter, another student at the college. Molly begins to suspect one of her professors, Professor Talloway, when she discovers that Alex secretly goes off to his home on a lake. She continuously reports back to Ranford, who at one point tells Molly that Nicholas Dexter, her love interest, is not his real name. She does not believe him, and soon figures out that Ranford is not who he says he is. One night, she follows Alex to Talloway's home, only to discover that her professor is actually a federal agent. She encounters a gunman, from whom she escapes. She figures out that Ranford is actually behind the mask, who drives off with a kidnapped Alex, and soon finds Talloway injured from a gunshot wound outside his home. When she returns to the sorority house, she encounters two federal agents working on the case. They are hesitant to believe her at first, but Morris convinces them to help solve the case with the help of her sorority sisters. They execute the plan, rescue Alex, and corner Ranford, who is arrested. Alex hands over an SD card, with the evidence in her father's case, to Molly, who hands it over to the FBI. The FBI is pleased with Molly's work, and she is offered to continue working for them. She declines, and instead wants to continue going to college. Two months pass, and she is taking photos of a guy Cotton is dating. Nicholas comes up to her, revealing they are dating and they kiss as the film ends.

The Festival is an annual intensive summer performance festival, which includes a concert series of international solo musicians and young performers, and an institute for students of solo, chamber music, and orchestral playing. The festival hosts three sessions in two locations: Acqui Terme, in the Province of Alessandria in Piedmont, Italy, and Sulzbach- Rosenberg, Germany in Bavaria. History The InterHarmony International Music Festival was conceived in 1997, when cellist Misha Quint, the Music Director and Founder, started his first International Music Festival in Blonay, Switzerland. This festival, the Intensive Cello Studies Abroad, was held at the Hindemith Foundation in Chalet de lacroix. Quint then opened the Soesterberg International Music Festival in Soesterberg, Netherlands in 1998. His festival in the Netherlands was a success and lasted for nine years. In the midst of the location in Soesterberg in 2000, the name, \\"InterHarmony\\", was born. InterHarmony International Music Festival in Sulzbach-Rosenberg, Germany 2012 The Festival in 2000 in Geneva, Switzerland was the first to bear this name. Other locations later took it up. Some locations, such as Soesterberg and Sulzbach-Rosenberg also retained the location name within the city as a subsidiary of InterHarmony. The Sulzbach-Rosenberg location of InterHarmony opened in 2005 and was an immediate success with local audiences. The Hinterzarten, Germany locale in the Black Forest lasted from 2008 ‚Äì 2011. There were two locations in the United States: The Berkshires, Massachusetts from 2007- 2008, and San Francisco, California, at San Francisco State University in 2009. InterHarmony remains one of the only festivals of its kind to move around the world. Many students and artists-in-residence end up traveling to all the locations, and in the case of 2012, spending nearly six weeks at the festivals. The Festival has gained renown in Germany and brings international culture and artistry to its locations. For example, The U.S. Consul General spoke at the final concert where Misha Quint performed in 2008, and a Young Artist Showcase was given in the offices of the German Consulate in New York City in 2012. In 2010, Caitlin Hulcup, a soloist from the Vienna Staatsoper, and Christa Mayer from the Bayreuther Festspiele, performed with the InterHarmony Festival Orchestra and the Forchheimer Kammerorchester, a Symphony Orchestra in Germany. InterHarmony Concert Series in New York City In 2015 InterHarmony International Music Festival opened the InterHarmony Concert Series with three concerts at the Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall in New York City each year. The series showcases artist performers and advanced young artists who have previously performed at InterHarmony International Music Festivals in Europe. InterHarmony Outstanding Guest Artist series In 2015 InterHarmony International Music Festival opened the InterHarmony Outstanding Guest Artist Series in its sessions in Italy and Germany. Famous musicians are invited to perform and give a master class to young artists. In 2015 the guest artists were violinist Vadim Repin and pianist Bruno Canino in Italy, and pianist Alfred Brendel gave a lecture in Sulzbach-Rosenberg, Germany. The 2017 guest artists were Nikolaj Znaider, Vadim Repin, Shlomo Mintz, Bruno Canino, Alfred Brendel, Christa Mayer, and Boris Kuschnir.

The species is endemic to Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Formerly it was considered a subspecies of Trachemys scripta, but was elevated to its own species level. Etymology The specific name, emolli, is in honor of American herpetologist Edward Moll (E. Moll).Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Trachemys emolli, p. 83). Geographic range The Nicaraguan slider is native to Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and is found in places such as Lake Nicaragua, Lake Managua, and the lakes and streams that connect them. Characteristics Plastron of Trachemys emolli The Nicaraguan slider has a carapace with many circular markings on it, and in the middle of each marking, there is a dark spot. The main color of the carapace and the turtle's skin is olive green to dark brown. It also has yellow markings on it as well. The supratemporal markings can be orange, pink, or yellow. Males averagely grow to straight carapace length, and females can averagely grow to or larger. Biology The Nicaraguan slider likes its water to be around mid-70s to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 27 degrees Celsius). As far as basking goes, it likes its basking area to be in the high 80s to mid-90s degrees Fahrenheit (30 to 35 degrees Celsius). Diet In the wild, the juvenile Nicaraguan slider eats the following: tadpoles, crustaceans, fish, insects and insect larvae. Breeding The nesting season of T. emolli ranges from about the month of December to May. Females can lay several clutches per season with up to thirty-five eggs per clutch. The hatchlings emerge about 69 to 123 days after the eggs have been deposited. Subspecies *No subspecies. References ;Bibliography * Further reading *Legler, John M.

Today he is mostly remembered for his work on the production of mustard gas during World War I. Life Georg Wilhelm Steinkopf was born on 28 June 1879 in Sta√üfurt, in the Prussian Province of Saxony in the German Empire, the son of Gustav Friedrich Steinkopf, a merchant, and his wife Elise Steinkopf (n√©e Heine). In 1898 he began studying chemistry and physics at the University of Heidelberg. In 1899 he moved to the Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe (today the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology), where he finished his studies with a degree as Diplomingenieur in 1905. In Karlsruhe, he also met his future colleagues Fritz Haber and Roland Scholl. After receiving his Doctor of Science and eventually his Habilitation in 1909, he worked as an associate professor at the TU Karlsruhe until 1914, when he volunteered for service in World War I. In 1916 Fritz Haber, who was now the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry (KWIPC, today the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society) in Berlin, invited Steinkopf to join his institute as the head of a team devoted to research on chemical weapons. Together with chemical engineer Wilhelm Lommel, Steinkopf developed a method for the large-scale production of bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, commonly known as mustard gas. Mustard gas was subsequently assigned the acronym LOST (LOmmel/STeinkopf) by the German military. Steinkopf's work on mustard gas and related substances had a negative impact on his health, which caused him to switch to another department of the KWIPC in 1917, supervising the production of gas ammunition. Although Fritz Haber wanted him to stay in Berlin, Steinkopf moved to Dresden after the end of World War I. Succeeding as the associate professor in organic chemistry at the Technische Universit√§t Dresden, he worked there from 1919 until his retirement. His research focussed on organic arsenic compounds, thiophene compounds, and the formation of petroleum. In 1924, Steinkopf became a member of the Beirat des Heereswaffenamts (Heereswaffenamt advisory council), an agency of the German military responsible for weapons research and development. He worked under strict secrecy and most of his friends and colleagues in Dresden did not know about this activity. After the Machtergreifung of the National Socialists in 1933, Reichswehrminister Werner von Blomberg demanded the Saxonian Volksbildungsministerium (Ministry of the People's Education) to show more recognition for Steinkopf's work during World War I. In 1935, Steinkopf was promoted to full professor, and continued to work at the TU Dresden until his retirement in 1940. His health being fragile due to his work with mustard gas and related substances, Steinkopf died on 12 March 1949 in Stuttgart. Aside from his scientific research, Steinkopf wrote several poems, novellas, and novels.

It probably represents the crusade of 1366, since the knight on the left is Amadeus VI. \\"The fresco is usually ascribed to the Sienese school and dated in the last half of the fourteenth century.\\"Cox, xv. The Savoyard crusade was a crusading expedition to the Balkans in 1366‚Äì67. It was born out of the same planning that led to the Alexandrian Crusade and was the brainchild of Pope Urban V. It was led by Count Amadeus VI of Savoy and directed against the growing Ottoman Empire in eastern Europe. Although intended as a collaboration with the Kingdom of Hungary and the Byzantine Empire, the crusade was diverted from its main purpose to attack the Second Bulgarian Empire. There the crusaders made small gains that they handed over to the Byzantines. It did take back some territory the Ottomans in the vicinity of Constantinople and on Gallipoli. Noting the greater attention paid to Bulgaria than to the Turks, historian Nicolae Iorga argued \\"it was not the same thing as a crusade, this expedition that better resembled an escapade.\\"Iorga, Philippe de M√©zi√®res et la croisade au XIVe si√®cle (Paris, 1896), 336‚Äì37: \\"Ce n'√©tait pas m√™me une croisade ... cette exp√©dition, qui ressembla beaucoup √† une √©quip√©e\\", quoted in Setton, 300. Still, the taking of Gallipoli, according to Oskar Halecki, was \\"the first success achieved by the Christians in their struggle for the defense of Europe, and at the same time the last great Christian victory [over the Turks] during all the fourteenth century.\\"Halecki, Un Empereur de Byzance √† Rome (Warsaw, 1930), quoted in Setton, 300. Preparations =Vows= On 31 March 1363, Good Friday, at Papal Avignon, the kings of France and Cyprus, John II and Peter I, took crusading vows to go to the Holy Land and received from Pope Urban V the sign of the cross (signum crucis) to sew on their garments as a sign of their vow. This was the beginning of the Savoyard crusade, although John II would never fulfill his vow personally and Peter I did not ultimately cooperate with the count of Savoy in the venture.Setton, 285. The latter did not make his crusading vow, also before Urban V, until probably 19 January 1364, when a council of regional magnates was held at Avignon to form a league (colligatio) against the marauding free companies. This was certainly the occasion when the pope bestowed on Amadeus the Golden Rose, and the count founded the chivalric Order of the Collar to replace his earlier, and probably defunct, Order of the Black Swan.Cox, 179‚Äì81. The original members of the Order of the Collar were devoted followers, and often relatives, of Amadeus and all were probably pledged to accompany him on crusade. In the event, all but two who could not go for reasons of health, travelled east.Cox, 184. The Order, like the crusade, was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The deadline established for the departure of the crusade was 1 March 1365, although the pope expected both Peter of Cyprus and Amadeus of Savoy to depart earlier.Setton, 286. The deadline was met by nobody, although on 27 June the king of Cyprus left Venice on the Alexandrian Crusade.Cox, 205. Map of the divisions of Bulgaria at the time of the crusade In May 1363, Urban had made an appeal to Louis I of Hungary for a crusade against the Turks, and the king spent the winter of 1364‚Äì65 preparing an army for a major offensive designed to push the Turks out of Europe. In January 1365, as reported at Venice, ten galleys were being gathered in Provence for Louis's use, and Louis had issued a call for support in Zadar (Zara) and Dalmatia. In the spring he invaded, not Turkish Europe (Rumelia), but rather the north of Bulgaria, then ruled by the tsar's second son, Sratsimir. He conquered and occupied Vidin, and took Sratsimir captive back to Hungary. His expedition was thus completed in time for him to cooperate with Amadeus in a joint attack on the Turks in the spring of 1366.Setton, 286‚Äì87. =Finances= On 1 April 1364 Urban V made a serious effort to fund Amadeus's expedition with a series of seven bulls granting him various new sources of income. All confiscated \\"ill-gotten gains\\" (male acquisita) from theft, rapine or usury which could not be restituted (to the victims) were to be used for the next six years for the crusade. Further, \\"all the hitherto unspent legacies, gifts, confiscations, fines, and penances which had been bequeathed, given, assigned, or levied pro dicto passagio et Terre Sancte subsidio [for the passage to the Holy Land and its welfare] in the county of Savoy and its dependencies for the preceding twelve years and for the next six\\" were assigned to the count for his expedition. Finally, the church was to pay a tithe (tenth) of its tithes to the count for the crusade, excepting those priests who had received permission to go on the journey themselves. =Army and fleet= In early 1366 Amadeus was in Savoy assembling his army. More than half of the army consisted of the hereditary vassals of the count of Savoy, and almost no family in his dominions was unrepresented. His half-brother Ogier and his nephew Humbert, son of his half-brother Humbert, both joined. Aymon, younger brother of James of Piedmont, and Amadeus's two illegitimate sons, both named Antoine, participated.Distinguished as Antonius, bastardus de Sabaudie, junior and senior. Among crusaders were the English knight Richard Musard, the count's cousin Guillaume de Grandson, Aymond, heir of Amadeus III of Geneva, who was too ill to fulfill his vow, and Louis de Beaujeu, sire d'Alloignet, who was taking the place of Antoine de Beaujeu.Cox, 207‚Äì08. By the time it had reached Venice, this army had been organised into three batailles under the oversight of the marshal Gaspard de Montmayeur: the first was led by Amadeus, Gaspard, Aymard de Clermont, and the brothers Guy and Jean de Vienne; the second by √âtienne de la Baume, the sire de Basset, and the sire de Saint-Amour; the third and largest, the grosse bataille, was commanded by Guillaume de Grandson, Antelme d'Urti√®res, and Florimont de Lesparre, and included the count's relatives. Seeing that the Alexandrian Crusade had harmed its commercial relations with the Islamic powers, the Republic of Venice was disinclined to participate in the projected crusade or to provide it transportation east. A letter from Pope Urban in March 1365 did not convince them otherwise, but an embassy from Amadeus procured a promise of two galleys in light of the count's request for five (and two fustes). Urban, the architect of the crusade, negotiated with Genoa and Marseille to procure ships, but the promise of transportation from the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV was never fulfilled. A large number of mercenaries from the free companies had joined the crusade and assembled at Tournus under Arnaud de Cervole, but when he was assassinated on 25 May 1366 near M√¢con, they abandoned the expedition. Passage to the East =Savoy to Venice= On 3 January 1366 at Le Bourget-du-Lac, Amadeus, in preparation for his departure, named his wife, Bonne de Bourbon, regent in his absence, to be assisted by a council of seven, at least two of whom had always to be witness to her orders to make them effective. Perhaps as a protest at the lateness of these efforts, or at the proposed destination, which was not the Holy Land, on 6 January Pope Urban revoked the bulls of 1 April 1364, thus cutting off a major source of funding. Although Amadeus went to Avignon to protest, and apparently received a Papal blessing for his adventure, the bulls remained revoked.Cox, 206‚Äì07. The count was forced to demand a general subsidy (tax) for the viagio ultramarino (voyage overseas), but this remained uncollected until 1368 and the cost of naval transportation had to be met by loans (10,000 florins) from some banks of Lyon and the pawning of the family silver. On 8 February Amadeus began the voyage over land to Venice.Cox, 209. Amadeus had reached Rivoli by 15 February, and Pavia, where his brother-in-law Galeazzo II Visconti ruled, by mid-March. He then turned around and visited Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne before returning to Pavia by late May, there to be godfather at the baptism of his nephew Giangaleazzo's infant son Giangaleazzo II. His sister, the elder Giangaleazzo's mother, Bianca, made a donation to his war chest at this time, and his brother-in-law made loans of both money and men: 25,000 florins and twenty-five men-at-arms, six hundred brigandi (mercenaries) and sixteen conestabiles under his bastard son Cesare, to be paid at Galeazzo's expense for the first six months. Half of the crusading host under √âtienne de la Baume went from there to Genoa to embark on the fleet awaiting it and take it to Venice. On 1 June the rest of the army under Amadeus left for Padua, where the ruling family, the Carraresi, offered him the use of their palace in Venice. On 8 June Amadeus and the main army arrived at Venice, where the Venetians, informed that the crusade was not directed at the Holy Land, offered more assistance, including ships and men if the crusaders would take Tenedos from the Genoese (which they would not). The departure of the fleet took place around 21 June.Cox, 208‚Äì13. =Venice to Gallipoli= The fleet sailed down the Dalmatian coast, stopping at Pula (Pola), Dubrovnik (Ragusa), Corfu and finally Koroni (Coron), which was under Venetian control. There Amadeus learned that Marie de Bourbon, daughter of Duke Louis II of Bourbon, whose sister Bonne was Amadeus's wife, was being besieged in her castle at Pylos (Navarino) by the Archbishop of Patras, Angelo Acciaioli, who had seized her lands on behalf of Philip of Taranto, her brother-in-law, who disputed the claim to the Principality of Achaea by Marie on behalf of her young son, Hugh, whose father was the late Robert of Taranto. Early in 1366 Marie and Hugh had raised an army of mercenaries from Cyprus and Provence, and had begun to reclaim the territory of the principality she claimed. During negotiations, Marie's castellan of Pylos, Guillaume de Talay, had arrested Simone del Poggio, the bailiff of Philip of Taranto, and imprisoned him in Pylos's dungeons. By the time of Amadeus's arrival, a counter-offensive led by the archbishop had cornered Marie and Hugh in Pylos. The count of Savoy was requested to arbitrate. He determined that Marie should renounce any claim over Patras, and that the archbishop should evacuate his troops from southern Achaea and leave Marie in peaceful possession of it. The \\"damsel in distress\\" rescued and \\"the rights of the church\\" defended, Amadeus returned to his ships.Cox, 213‚Äì15. This historical event is essentially garbled in the Gestez et Croniques de la Mayson de Savoye, which call Marie, the \\"desposte des Inus\\", a cousine rather than a niece of Bonne. Her castle is \\"Jungs\\" on the bay known as \\"Port de Junch\\" or \\"Junke\\", from the Venetian Zonklon. The count's expense records refer to it as the castrum de Jonc. The Chronique also renders the result as a victory for the archbishop, who \\"cherished [the count] and praised him greatly and gave him many fine relics.\\" According to Aziz Atiya, The Crusade in the Later Middle Ages (London, 1928), 387, the disputed possessions were at \\"Zuchio and the castle of Manolada.\\" At Koroni, the Venetian fleet, which was being led by Antelme d'Urti√®res, captain of the count's galley, rendezvoused with the Genoese to form a fleet of fifteen ships under the overall command of the admiral √âtienne de la Baume. The army was divided between the galleys on the basis of geography: there was one ship for the men of Bresse (Breysse), another for \\"the men of Faucigny\\" (des gens de Foucignie), another for those of Savoy proper (Savoye), etc. All the ships were to sail within sight of each other and none to sail ahead of the count's, fines being prescribed for violations of these commands. Flag signals by day and lanterns by night were used to communicated between ships; attack signals were given by trumpeters on the count's ship. The entire voyage was strictly controlled by the count of Savoy.Cox, 211. From Koroni the fleet proceeded to Agios Georgios (San Giorgio d'Albora) on Hydra, thence to Chalcis (Negroponte), and finally Evripos, the last stop before they entered Turkish territory.Cox, 215. There they bought clean water, and the count's physician, Gui Albin, purchased saculi pro stomaco, some kind of disinfectant for the stomach.Cox, 219. Campaigns =Gallipoli= Although the crusaders were hoping for assistance from John V Palaiologos, Byzantine Emperor, the pope had made it dependent on his bringing the Greek Orthodox Church back into communion with the Roman Catholic Church‚Äîand under papal supremacy‚Äîeven though it was the Byzantine empire that the crusade was seeking to relieve from Turkish pressure.Cox, 216‚Äì18. The crusaders also expected support from Louis of Hungary, although all that was ever received was two royal squire who served Amadeus \\"in the Bulgarian provinces\\" (in partibus Burgarie).Cox, 230. In the spring of 1366, John V travelled to the Hungarian court to accept military aid and swear an oath on behalf of himself and his sons to convert to Catholicism. On 1 July Pope Urban had extended to Louis the Crusade indulgence, but on 22 July a letter from the pope suspended the privileges granted earlier that month for one year, postponing assistance to the Greeks until after their return to the Catholic fold and convincing Louis not to assist the \\"schismatic\\", although the pope had not expressly forbid him to.Setton, 289. On his return through Bulgaria, so recently attacked by his would-be ally, John found himself trapped, either imprisoned or surrounded by Bulgarian forces, and unable to continue to his own domain, where his son, Andronicus IV, married to Keratsa, daughter of the Bulgarian tsar, had taken control of the government. Amadeus and John V were first cousins, John's mother, Anna, was the sister of Amadeus's father, Aymon. Apprised of the situation in Bulgaria and of the Turkish positions in Europe, Amadeus led his fleet into the Dardanelles, where it was joined by a flotilla under Francesco I Gattilusio, Prince of Lesbos, and son-in-law of the trapped emperor. The Savoyard chronicles record that they met a detachment of the Byzantine army under the Patriarch of Constantinople. On 22 August, the combined crusader fleet launched an attack on Gelibolu (Gallipoli), the second city of the European Turks. While the army assaulted the walls, the Turks abandoned the city during the night and in the morning the inhabitants opened the gates to the crusaders.Cox, 219‚Äì21. The sources shed limited light on this brief episode. According to the count's register, both town and citadel were in Savoyard hands by 26 August. Garrisons and commanders were appointed for each‚ÄîGiacomo di Luserna for the city and Aimone Michaele for the citadel, with responsibility for not just defending Gelibolu but also for guarding the entrance to the straits. On 27 August a messenger was sent westward with news of the count's \\"first and most famous victory against the heathen Turks\\". The chronicles explain the rapid success by the Turkish retreat, but it is also known that on 12 September, at Beyoƒülu (Pera) in Constantinople, the count was preparing the funerals of several of his men killed in the attack on Gelibolu, including Simon de Saint-Amour and Roland de Veissy, both knights of the Collar. The count's bursar, Antoine Barbier, purchased eighteen escutcheons bearing the \\"device of the Collar\\" (devisa collarium) for their funeral. Eighty-one wax torches and alms were paid for the burial of Girard Mareschal from Savoy and Jean d'Yverdon from the Vaudois.Cox, 223. A storm in the Sea of Marmora prevented the remainder of the crusade from leaving Gelibolu, but by 4 September they had arrived by sea at Constantinople. The fleet landed at Beyoƒülu (Pera), the Genoese quarter where most of his men stayed, although some took lodgings in Galata, the borgo de Veneciis (Venetian quarter). Amadeus himself purchased an unfurnished house in the city proper. Besides the cost of furniture and funerals, the count paid his interpreter Paulo three months' wages. Map of the Bulgarian expedition =Bulgaria= From Constantinople, Amadeus sent a Savoyard embassy to John V, who was apparently at Vidin. He seems to have asked for armed intervention to free him to return to his capital. His empress, Helena Kantakouzene, offered the count of Savoy money for a military expedition into Bulgaria. Although Amadeus had no warrant from the pope to attack the Bulgarians, fellow Christians albeit schimastics (non-Catholics). Leaving a contingent behind in Constantinople, the count led a fleet up the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria on 4 October. In two days they reached the port of \\"Lorfenal\\" (l'Orfenal) and then Sozopolis, which was long supposed to have been in Byzantine hands, but now appears to have belonged to the Bulgarians. No battle took place, and it is not clear if the city surrendered or was simply bypassed. The expense accounts of Amadeus VI show him to have been \\"at Sozopolis\\" (apud Tisopuli) for 17‚Äì19 October, but he may have only camped outside its walls. He may, however, have captured Burgas. On 20 October the city of Nesebar (Mesembria) and its citadel were captured. Having put up a stiff resistance that caused the death of many Christian knights and squires, the Mesembrians were put to the sword, women and children not spared, and the city was pillaged. Pomorie, which the Savoyards called Lassillo or l'Assillo (from Axillo, or Anchialus) was next captured, and perhaps also Macropolis (Manchopoly) and Scafida (Stafida), and the Savoyards controlled the Gulf of Burgas.Cox, 222‚Äì24. The coastal region of Bulgaria, modern Dobrudja, was at this time the semi-independent Principality of Karvuna, ruled by Dobrotitsa as a frontier march of the Bulgarian empire. Its chief city, formerly a metropolis, was Varna. On 25 October the crusaders arrived before Varna, and sent an embassy to the citizens asking them to surrender. They refused, but promised to send their own messengers to Tsar Ivan Shishman, whose capital was at Veliko Tarnovo (Tirnovo), requesting him to allow John V to pass, although Shishman did not control Vidin at the time, which was in the hands of his brother, Ivan Sratsimir. In the meantime, the Varnans supplied the crusading army and several embassies were exchanged between Tarnovo and the count of Savoy's camp. In order to strengthen his bargaining position, Amadeus attacked and captured Emona (Lemona, l'Emona), a fortress on Cape Emine, further south along the coast. After their capitulation the Emonans rose in rebellion and had to be crushed. Establishing a garrison there, Amadeus returned to Varna.Cox, 224‚Äì25. As the truce between Varna and the count of Savoy dragged on, a band of youthful crusaders ventured by sea to take the small castle of \\"Calocastre\\" by night. They were discovered by the guards as they tried to scale the walls and massacred. Although expressing disapproval of their independent action, Amadeus led a retaliatory expedition which resulted in the slaughter of the population of Calocastre. Negotiations with the Bulgarians continued into mid-November, and, possibly at the insistence of the tsar, Amadeus raised the siege of Varna and withdrew to Nesebar, leaving a garrison in Emona, before 18 November.Cox, 225‚Äì26. On 23 December Tsar Shishman sent word to Amadeus that the emperor was being permitted to go from Vidin to Kaliakra, in Dobrotitsa's domain. The count sent a welcoming party to await him there, and passed the winter at Nesebar, where he administered the city thoroughly, extracting taxes of all kinds. Early in January 1367 the count moved his court across the gulf to Sozopolis, where the emperor finally arrived on 28 January, without having stopped at Kaliakra.Cox, 228‚Äì29. =Vicinity of Constantinople= Late in January or early in February, the citizens of Emona rebelled. On 15 March, probably after the emperor had left for Constantinople, having promised to defray the cost of Amadeus's expedition to Bulgaria in return for receiving the cities he had conquered, the count went to Nesebar to oversee final preparations for his departure, including the ransom of all his men who by then were still held captive in Bulgarian prisons. By 9 April all had been accomplished and the crusaders were back in Constantinople, where, in the words of the Savoyard chroniclers, \\"the emperor, in order to receive his cousin the count more highly and honorably, made ready the priests, colleges, and all orders of religion, gentlemen, citizens, merchants, people, women, and children, and [they all] went to the seaside to meet the count, crying 'Long live the count of Savoy, who has delivered Greece from the Turks and the Emperor, our lord, from the hands of the Emperor of Bulgaria'.\\"Cox, 230‚Äì31. At Constantinople, John V finally agreed to pay 15,000 florins of the costs of the Bulgarian expedition, although ultimately only about 10,000 were ever received. Amadeus still intended to wage war against the Turk, but his means to do so had decreased since the capture of Gallipoli. Nevertheless, on 14 May he took the Turkish castle of Eneacossia on the northern shore of the Marmora, which the Greek historian John Kantakouzenos informs us was the \\"fortress near Rhegium\\", modern K√º√ß√ºk√ßekmece. One of the Savoyard soldiers was rewarded for planting the Savoyard banner atop the tower during the fray.Setton, 307. In that same month Amadeus had to rush north to defend Sozopolis from a Turkish assault.Cox, 232. On or near 24 May, his men set fire to the Turkish fortress called Caloneyro, probably represented by the Byzantine ruins at B√ºy√ºk√ßekmece. Throughout April‚ÄìMay the prime concern of the crusade was paying off the shipowners and raising funds for the return voyage. Statue of Amadeus slaying a Turk by Pelagio Palagi, which stands in Turin Florentine style by Andrea di Bonaiuto in the Spanish Chapel of the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella shows Amadeus VI (fourth from left in the back row) as a crusader Return trip During the remainder of Amadeus's time in Constantinople, he endeavoured without success to negotiate an end to the East‚ÄìWest Schism. Although he had established Paul, Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, at Gelibolu and not at Constantinople‚Äîin deference to the Greeks‚ÄîPaul returned to Italy with the crusade, leaving Constantinople on 9 June 1367. The count of Savoy travelled aboard a new galley that his man Giovanni di Conte purchased at Pera. On 13/14 June, the crusaders arrived at Gelibolu. Amadeus paid the garrison, and handed the city and citadel over to the Byzantines. By 16 June, the fleet reached Tenedos. Between 20 and 22 June it stayed at Chalcis, where Amadeus paid four gold perperi to two minstrels of Roger de Ll√∫ria, vicar-general of the Duchy of Athens, who had come bringing their master's greetings and stayed to entertain for the evening.Cox, 234‚Äì36. At Chalcis, many left the crusade to go to Cyprus and fight under King Peter I, promising more opportunities for fighting infidels (and less fighting schismatic brothers in the faith). The returning crusaders stopped at Methoni (Modon) and Glarentza (Clarencia), arriving at Corfu on 10 July. A week later, they stopped at Dubrovnik and on 29 July they landed in Venice. News of their victories preceded them. Amadeus remained at the palace of the Carraresi in Venice for five weeks: paying off debts, making gifts of thanksgiving to churches, taking out more loans (8,872 ducats from Bartholomeo Michaelis and 10,346 from Federigo Cornaro). He visited Treviso for some festivities, the meaning of which is unclear (23‚Äì26 August). To discharge his vows, Amadeus was required to take the ambassadors of John V to Rome. He went by land up to Pavia, where he arrived on 18 September to await his baggage coming up by the waters of the Po and his treasury coming down from Savoy to finance his final pilgrimage to Rome. On 25 September he set out for Pisa, and from there to Viterbo, where he met Pope Urban and presented the Byzantine embassy. He continued with the Papal entourage to Rome, where Pope Urban solemnly entered the city on 12 October, the first pope in Rome since 1305. Amadeus remained at Rome about two weeks before returning to Chamb√©ry by Christmas via Perugia and Florence (early November), through Pavia (mid-November), Parma, Borgo San Donnino and Castel San Giovanni. Throughout his journey from Venice to Rome to Savoy, the count was honoured as a triumphant crusader.Cox, 236‚Äì39. Loss of Emona and Gallipoli Amadeus left the city of Emona in the hands of his illegitimate son, the elder Antoine, with a small garrison. According to the chroniclers of Savoy, Jehan Servion and Jean d'Oronville Cabaret, the inhabitants deceived the Savoyards with acts of kindness before leading them into an ambush, where Antoine was captured. Antoine is supposed to have languished in a Bulgarian prison until his death. Although this account is not corroborated by earlier sources, it is certain that Emona was lost to the Bulgarians and that the elder Antoine does not appear in his father's treasury accounts any time after the crusade.Cox, 230 n. 78. Gallipoli was not lost to Christendom by any action of the Turks. After three years of civil war between John V and his son, Andronicus IV, it was handed over to them by the latter as payment for their support. Thus it was occupied after ten years of Christian occupation in the winter of 1376‚Äì77 by Sultan Murad I.Setton, 321. Notes Bibliography *Cox, Eugene L. (1967).

Clientelism involves an asymmetric relationship between groups of political actors described as patrons, brokers, and clients. Although many definitions for clientelism have been proposed, according to the political scientist Allen Hicken, it is generally thought that there are four key elements of clientelistic relationships: * Dyadic relationships: Simply, these are two-way relationships. * Contingency: Delivery of a service to a citizen by a politician or broker is contingent on the citizen's actions on behalf of the politician or party through which they are receiving services. * Hierarchy: The politician or party is in a higher position of power than the citizen. * Iteration: The relationship is not a one-off exchange, but rather, ongoing. Contingency and iteration are the two components shared across most definitions of clientelism. Origins The origin of the practice has been traced to ancient Rome. Here relationships between the patron (patronus) and client (cliens) were seen as crucial to understanding the political process. While the obligations between these were mutual, the key point is they were hierarchical. These relationships might be best viewed not as an entity but rather as a network (clientela), with the patronus himself perhaps being obligated to someone of greater power, and the cliens perhaps having more than one patron. These extensions increase the possibilities of conflicting interests arising. While the familia was the basic unit underlying Roman society, the interlocking networks (clientela) acted as restrictions on their autonomy but allowed a more complex society to develop. Historians of the late medieval period evolved the concept into bastard feudalism. There is, as is usual, ambiguity in the use of political terminology and the terms \\"clientelism\\", the \\"patron‚Äìclient relationship\\", \\"patronage\\" and the political machine are sometimes used to describe similar or related concepts.Tornquist, Olle (1999) Politics and Development: A Critical Introduction, SAGEClapham, Christopher (1985) Third World Politics, Croom HelmGruen, Erich S. (1986) \\"Patrocinium and clientela,\\" in The Hellenistic World and the Coming of Rome, University of California Press, Vol. 1, pp. 162‚Äì163. The reigns of Julius Caesar (49‚Äì44 BCE) and Tiberius (14‚Äì16 AD) have been characterized as examples of widespread clientelism. In the 1500s, French political theorist √âtienne de La Bo√©tie did not use the term clientelism, but described the practice of emperors who used gifts to the public to gain loyalty from those who were eager to accept what amounted to bribery: :Tyrants would distribute largesse, a bushel of wheat, a gallon of wine, and a sesterce [coin]: and then everybody would shamelessly cry, \\"Long live the King!\\" The fools did not realize that they were merely recovering a portion of their own property, and that their ruler could not have given them what they were receiving without having first taken it from them. A man might one day be presented with a sesterce and gorge himself at the public feast, lauding Tiberius and Nero for handsome liberality, who on the morrow, would be forced to abandon his property to their avarice, his children to their lust, his very blood to the cruelty of these magnificent emperors, without offering any more resistance than a stone or a tree stump. The mob has always behaved in this way‚Äîeagerly open to bribes.√âtienne de La Bo√©tie (1552‚Äì1553). The Politics of Obedience: The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude (Harry Kurz, transl.), New York: Free Life, p. 40 Mechanics Susan Stokes et al. distinguish clientelism as a form of non-programmatic policy within distributive politics. It meets the criteria through failing to meet the two requirements of programmatic distribution, that are (1) 'formalized and public' and (2) 'shape actual distribution of benefits or resources'. Within non-programmatic policy, clientelism is then distinguished from 'pork-barrel politics' in that voters are given a benefit or are able to avoid a cost conditional on their returning the favor with a vote. The patron/client system can be defined as a mutual arrangement between a person that has authority, social status, wealth, or some other personal resource (patron) and another who benefits from their support or influence (client).webref.org The patron provides selective access to goods and opportunities, and place themselves or their support in positions from which they can divert resources and services in their favor. Their partners-clients- are expected to buy support, and in some cases, votes. Patrons target low- income families to exchange their needed resources for their abundant resources: time, a vote, and insertion into networks of other potential supporters whom they can influence.Roniger, Luis. Political Clientelism, Democracy, and Market Economy. 3rd ed. Vol. 36. New York: : PhD. Program in Political Science of the City U of New York, 2004. 353-375. Print. However, patrons are unable to access the information needed to effectively form the exchange; thus they hire intermediaries, brokers, that more equipped to find out what the targeted voter needs, which voters will require less prodding, and if the voter followed through on their end of the bargain. As Stokes, Dunning, Nazareno, and Brusco emphasize, brokers in turn serve political leaders, and they may also not target resources exactly as leaders would wish; the resulting principal-agent problems can have important implications for understanding how clientelism works. Standard modeling of clientelism assumes that politicians are able to monitor votes, and in turn, reward or punish voters based on their choices. Quid pro quo would dissolve in the absence of such monitoring, rendering clientielism highly inefficient at best and completely ineffective at worst. However, evidence suggests that systematic monitoring of voter choice at the polls is surprisingly uncommon. Patronage, turnout buying, abstention buying, and vote buying are subcategories of clientelism. Patronage refers to an intra-party flow of benefits to members. Turnout buying, coined by Nichter, treats or bribes voters to the polls whereas abstention buying treats or bribes voters to keep them from going to the polls. Vote buying is a direct transfer of goods or services, in exchange for one's support and vote. The result for the good or service is a question of did you or will you vote for me?Goodin, Robert E. The Oxford Handbook of Political Science. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2009. Print. A key to understanding clientelism might come in stressing not only the mutually beneficial relationships of exchange but also asymmetries in power or standing. Implied is a certain selectivity in access to key resources and markets. Those with access, the patrons (and/or sometimes sub-patrons or brokers) rely on the subordination and dependence of the clients. In return for receiving some benefits the clients should provide political support. Forms of clientelism Politicians can engage in clientelism on either (or both) a group or individual level. One way individual level clientelism can manifest itself is in a vote buying relationship: a politician gives a citizen goods or services, and, in exchange, that individual citizen promises to vote for that politician in the next election. Individual level clientelism can also be carried out through coercion where citizens are threatened with lack of goods or services unless they vote for a certain politician or party. The relationship can also work in the opposite direction, where voters pressure politicians into clientelistic relationships in exchange for electoral support. Stokes' research on clientelism in Argentina assumed that the Peronist party was providing financial support to prospective voters to buy their votes. It was hypothesized that Peronists targeted moderately opposed voters because they were thought to be easily persuaded to change sides at the party's minimal expense. Stokes elaborated on the need of the Argentinian Peronist party to be able to track who their clientele in fact voted for amidst the secret ballot system. Stokes' argument is that the potential for vote buying depends on the accuracy with which the patron party, the Peronists in the case of Argentina, are able to monitor votes. She uses evidence to show that overall smaller communities offer less anonymity, making it easier for the patrons to find out who committed to supporting them. Thus, Stokes concludes that this is one of the reasons why vote buying is more frequent in relatively small communities. Another reason is that smaller communities are generally poorer. Furthermore, smaller communities, which are generally poorer and have a greater need for resources, are a more attractive target. Research by Nichter promoted a simpler hypothesis for the Argentinian election cycle: to prove Peronists were solely buying supporting voters' turnout, not all the people's votes. He dismissed Stokes' arguments on patrons spying on smaller and poorer communities, instead saying the Peronists initially targeted votes assumed to be their strong supporters. In this case the patrons would be reasonably sure they receive a vote from a person if this person receives a good from them. In many young low-income democracies, clientelism may assume the form of group-level targeting, where parties channel benefits to specific groups of voters, conditional on past or future electoral support. For group- based targeting to work, parties must find efficient ways to distribute benefits while also holding voters accountable‚Äîi.e., ensuring that they don't renege on their commitments. This leads parties to hire intermediaries, often referred to as 'brokers', who supply them with fine-grained information about who needs what and what sorts of voters will and will not vote for them, regardless of the benefit(s) provided. Party brokers are not the only type of intermediaries that mediate clientelist exchanges; there are organizational brokers who represent specific interest groups but mobilize voters for multiple parties, hybrid brokers who also represent specific interest groups but demonstrate strong party loyalties, and independent brokers who neither represent specific group interests nor exhibit stable partisan attachments. Scholarly consensus has thus far eluded the question of why parties channel clientelist benefits to certain groups more than others. Some of the earlier work on group-level targeting argues that politicians are more likely to direct party largesse to their co-ethnics because ethnicity helps parties solve the commitment problems that are so critical to making clientelism work. Some of the more contemporary work underscores the salience of partisan loyalties: politicians direct the bulk of their vote-buying efforts at persuadable swing voters‚Äîi.e., voters who are either indifferent to the party's professed programmatic goals, or moderately opposed to them.[6] Some studies have challenged these claims, suggesting instead that most instances of vote-buying in clientelist democracies might actually be instances of turnout-buying, whereby parties shower benefits on their most loyal supporters with the hope they will show up at the polling booth on election day. However, the lack of well-developed political machines does not preclude clientelist targeting. Recent studies have shown that in many emerging democracies where parties often lack the organizational capacity to monitor individual-level voting behavior, parties fine-tune their targeting strategies by updating their beliefs about what sorts of groups have been most responsive to their clientelist appeals in the past. Clientelism in context Clientelism may not look the same from context to context. Several individual and country- level factors may shape if and how clientelism takes hold in a country including the types of individual leaders, socioeconomic status of individuals, economic development, democratization, and institutional factors. In some contexts, clientelistic behavior is almost expected, as these types of interactions can become embedded in the formal political structures. Some types of leaders (such as hereditary traditional leaders who remain in power for extended periods of time) are more effective in carrying out clientelistic relationships than others (such as elected officials). Research has also shown that although politicians can benefit electorally from clientelistic relationships by gaining support from those who receive goods from them, there are also potential costs as clientelistic politicians may lose support from wealthier voters who do not engage in clientelistic relationships themselves view the practice negatively. Not all voters view clientelistic behavior as a positive trait in politicians, especially voters of higher socioeconomic statuses. In short, there is no one factor that causes clientelism to take hold. Consequences Clientelism has generally negative consequences on democracy and government while also having more uncertain consequences on the economy. The accountability relationship in a democracy, where voters hold elected officials accountable for their actions, is undermined by clientelism. This is because under clientelism, votes are contingent on gifts to clients rather than the performance of elected officials in office. Clientelism also degrades democratic institutions such as the secret ballot and administrative oversight. These factors both weaken democratic institutions and negatively impact the efficiency of government. Corruption and the perception of corruption have also been established as strongly correlated with clientelist systems. There are many reasons for this. For one, patrons often appear above the law in many clientelist systems. What is more, some acts in clientelist systems such as vote buying, could be inherently illegal. Finally, resources needed for patrons to maintain the clientelist system could necessitate illicit means of obtaining goods. Some scholars believe that because patrons focus on the control and procurement of private goods, they also neglect public goods such as roads and public schools which aid economic development. Scholars also note that rent seeking and corruption, prevalent in clientelist systems, could negatively impact the economy as well. Nevertheless, there is still great uncertainty in the economic effects of clientelism. Controversy It is common to link clientelism with corruption; both involve political actors using public and private resources for personal gain, but they are not synonymous. Corruption is commonly defined as \\"dishonest and fraudulent conduct by those in power, typically involving bribery\\",\\"Corruption\\" Def. 1. Oxford Dictionary Online, n.d., Mon. 1 November 2014. while political clientelism is seen as \\"the distribution of benefits targeted to individuals or groups in exchange for electoral support\\". It is common to associate the two together because they moderately overlap. , Diritto e giustizia,13 maggio 2000. There are different forms of corruptions that have nothing to do with clientelism, such as voter intimidation or ballot stuffing. \\"Clientelism is considered negative because its intention is to generate 'private' revenue for patrons and clients and, as a result obstruct 'public' revenue for members of the general community who are not a part of the patron-client arrangement.\\"Kawata, Jun ºichi. Comparing Political Corruption and Clientelism. Aldershot, Hampshire, England: Ashgate, 2006. Print. Clientelism as a strategy of political organisation is substantially different from other strategies which rely on appeals to wider programmatic objectives or simply emphasize higher degrees of competence. It is often assumed that clientelism is a vestige of political underdevelopment, a form of corruption, and that political modernization will reduce or end it. But alternative views stressing the persistence of clientelism ‚Äì and the patronage associated with it ‚Äì have been recognized.Graham, Richard (1997) Clientelismo na cultura pol√≠tica brasileira.

This forecast is an extrapolation in time of known weather parameters, including those obtained by means of remote sensing, using techniques that take into account a possible evolution of the air mass. This type of forecast therefore includes details that cannot be solved by numerical weather prediction (NWP) models running over longer forecast periods.  Principle  Nowcasting in meteorology uses surface weather station data, wind profiler data, and any other weather data available to initialize the current weather situation and forecast by extrapolation for a period of 0 to 6 hours. In this time range it is possible to forecast small features such as individual storms with reasonable accuracy. Weather radar echoes and satellite data, giving cloud coverage, are particularly important in nowcasting because they are very detailed and pick out the size, shape, intensity, speed and direction of movement of individual features of weather on a continuous basis and a vastly better resolution than surface weather stations. This used to be a simple extrapolation by a forecaster for the following few hours. But with the development of mesoscale numerical weather models, these information can be ingested into an expert system to produce a much better forecast combining numerical weather prediction and local effects not normally possible to be known beforehand. Different research groups, public and private, have developed such programs. For instance, the French weather service, M√©t√©o-France, is using a software, named ASPIC to extrapolate to a fine scale the areas of precipitation. Other examples are AutoNowcaster which has been developed by UCAR to predict short term motion and evolution of thunderstorms, and private firms like ClimaCell using its proprietary HyperCast software for nowcasting precipitation type and intensity at 300-500 m geospatial resolution  Usage  Data extrapolation, including development or dissipation, can be used to find the likely location of a moving weather system. The intensity of rainfall from a particular cloud or group of clouds can be estimated, giving a very good indication as to whether to expect flooding, the swelling of a river etc. Depending on the area of built-up space, drainage and land-use in general, a forecast warning may be issued. Nowcasting is thus used for public safety, weather sensitive operation like snow removal, for aviation weather forecasts in both the terminal and en-route environment, marine safety, water and power management, off-shore oil drilling, construction industry and leisure industry. The strength of nowcasting lies in the fact that it provides location-specific forecasts of storm initiation, growth, movement and dissipation, which allows for specific preparation for a certain weather event by people in a specific location.  Research  The short term forecast is as old as weather forecasting itself. During the nineteenth century, the first modern meteorologists were using extrapolation methods for predicting the movement of low pressure systems and anticyclones on surface maps. The researchers subsequently applied the laws of fluid dynamics to the atmosphere and developed the NWP as we know it today. However, the data resolution and parameterization of meteorological primitive equations still leave uncertainty about the small-scale projections, in time and space. The arrival of remote sensing means, such as radar and satellite, and more rapid development of the computer, greatly help to fill that gap. For instance, digital radar systems made it possible to track thunderstorms, providing users with the ability to acquire detailed information of each storm tracked, since the late 1980s. They are first identified by matching precipitation raw data to a set of preprogrammed characteristics into the system, including signs of organization in the horizontal and continuity in the vertical. Once the thunderstorm cell is identified, speed, distance covered, direction, and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) are all tracked and recorded to be utilized later. In 2017, the arrival of passive sensing means, such as wireless networks, helped progress nowcasting even further. It became possible to receive inputs every minute and achieve greater accuracy in short- term forecasting. Several countries have developed nowcasting programs as previously mentioned. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) supports these efforts and held test campaigns of such systems at various occasions.. For example, during the Olympic Games in Sydney and Beijing, several countries were invited to use their software to support the Games. Several scientific conferences addressing the topic. In 2009, WMO has even organized a symposium devoted to Nowcasting.

His daughter, Marie-F√©lix, married Prince Roland Bonaparte and had issue.  Early life  Fran√ßois was born on 12 December 1806 with his twin brother Louis. They grew up in a small town and were impressed every time circus came with a show - it seemed so interesting and simple so they followed the circus to learn all the tricks of the trade, boys were dreaming to become rich and successful and learnt so much and worked on different jobs. Career The brothers started to work in gambling business in Marseilles and earning some money brothers decided to develop their business and started to speculate on government pensions and got into real estate development. In that way they attracted attention to their business and were arrested, but not for a long time because law was not adopted yet for such cases. They were released and moved to Paris, but after King Louis Philippe passed new laws they had to move again - to Luxembourg. They ran profitable business there but it was just the first little step to their success in Hesse-Homburg near Frankfurt, where brothers signed a contract with a monarch because of debts of the city and in order to develop tourism industry. One innovation was the introduction of the single 0 style roulette wheel in 1843. This allowed Bad Homburg to compete against the casinos of Paris which offered the traditional wheel with both single and double zero house pockets. A legend says that Fran√ßois Blanc supposedly bargained with the devil to obtain the secrets of roulette. The legend is based on the fact that the sum of all the numbers on the roulette wheel (from 0 to 36) is 666, which is the \\"Number of the Beast\\".The last term in a sequence of partial sums composed of either sequence is 666, the \\"beast number\\". The venture was a great success, Homburg became popular in a moment with a lot of entertainment, gambling houses, hotels - all the richest and famous came there for new emotions and fun. In a while Fran√ßois Blanc was given the name \\"The Magician of Homburg\\".Mad for Monaco: The Magician of Monte Homburg could attract people only in summer months, during cold winter all the tourists preferred to rest in warmer places. Also In the 1860s, the government of Frankfurt decided to abolish gambling as they felt that their region no longer needed its help in attracting tourists. It gave an idea to Fran√ßois to move to South and open all-year business. It happened that the Prince of Monaco had recently legalized gambling, so \\"The Magician of Homburg\\" became that first person to establish a casino operation in Monaco. To establish Monaco as a gambling mecca for the elite of Europe, he invested his money in roads, railways to make people come to Monaco as a new place of rest and fortune. His new King gave Fran√ßois a freedom, so he turned from \\"The Magician of Homburg\\" to \\"The Magician of Monte Carlo\\" and he left his mark in a history of Monaco.

He graduated from the 36th class of the Army Staff College in November 1924, and was subsequently assigned to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office. From September 1926, Katagiri was assigned to the Chosen Army in Korea as head of a special military intelligence unit operating in Siberia and Manchuria. Afterwards, he returned to Tokyo as an instructor at the Army Academy and Staff College, as an aide-de-camp to Prince Mikasa, instructor at the Cavalry School, and commander of the IJA 27th Cavalry Regiment, During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Katagiri was promoted to colonel in the cavalry in August 1937, and in November of the same year became chief of staff of the IJA 1st Division which was stationed in Manchukuo under the aegis of the Kwantung Army. Katagiri was promoted to major general in August 1939 and assigned command of the IJA 1st Cavalry Brigade the following month, operating with the Mongolia Garrison Army to December 1940, when he returned to Japan. He subsequently became military advisor to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and vice-bureau head for the Inspectorate of Cavalry. In December 1942, Katagiri was promoted to lieutenant general. In July 1943, he was ordered to replace General Shigemasa Aoki, who had died of malaria while commanding the IJA 20th Division in New Guinea. His headquarters was near Gali, New Guinea, and marched with his troops to reinforce Finschhafen after the Australian landings.

Biography He was the son of Beis Yaakov. He died 4 Teves 5651 (December 15, 1890) and was buried in Radzyn. Scholarship He was the author of Orchos Chayim, Sod Y'sharim, Tiferes Hachanochi, and Dalsos Shaar Ha'ir, among many other seforim. He is referred to by Radzyner Chasidim as the Orchos Chayim, based on his phenomenal work on the Tzava'ah (will) of R' Eliezer HaGadol. He wrote this work in only 12 days, nearly without access to any books, during his trial on a libel fabricated against him by his adversaries. When the Rebbe published this work, he commented to his chasidim that he's happy that he got to print his Tzava'ah. At the age of sixteen, the Rebbe had already formulated a spectacular idea: he would compose a \\"gemara\\" of a sort on the mishnayos of Seder Taharos, as there is no Talmud Bavli on those tractates. In order to accomplish this, he gathered all the relevant material from the whole Talmud Bavli, Talmud Yerushalmi, and all other Braysos etc., and presented them in chronological order in a sefer he called Sidrei Taharos on Maseches Keilim. He later did the same with all the other tractates of Seder Taharos. However, only his works on Keilim and Oholot were published, as Sidrei Taharot. (The other tractates were lost during the Holocaust.) The task took him ten years to complete. =Tekhelet= The Rebbe was reputed to be brilliant in both the revealed and the hidden Torah. He was also extremely knowledgeable in several scientific fields, like chemistry, engineering and medicine. He spoke several languages fluently, and used them frequently while prescribing medicines in Latin to the countless people who turned to him for help. He worked tirelessly for the restoration of the techeiles of the tzitzis. He made use of his vast knowledge to research the topic, and traveled to Italy four times to conduct his study. While there he visited what was then the largest aquarium in the world (in Naples), and after studying the different sea creatures, concluded that the original blue color for the Techeiles was extracted from the secretion of the common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis; Hebrew: ◊ì÷∞÷º◊ô◊ï÷π◊†◊ï÷º◊ü). Legend has it that on one of his visits to Rome, he succeeded in persuading the Vatican to allow him a quick glimpse of the Holy Vessels of the Beis HaMikdosh, to match his findings with the techeiles on the priestly garments. He published several books on the topic, such as S'funei T'munei Chol, P'sil T'cheles, and Ein HaT'cheles, and succeeded in influencing many Gedolim with his work. At the same time, there were Gedolim who opposed to the Rebbe's opinion and did not agree with his findings. There was, however, a small number of Gedolei Yisrael who would practice the rediscovered mitzvah of techeiles, like Rabbi Sholom Mordechai Schwadron (known as the Maharsham of Berzan) who possessed a tallis with techeiles fringes. All the Rebbe's chassidim and followers wore them, as do many Breslov chassidim to this day. His identification of the cuttlefish as the source of techeiles was not widely accepted and was, in fact, the subject of great controversy. Years later, Rabbi Yitzchak Isaac Halevi Herzog challenged that identification and showed that the cuttlefish dye was actually the synthetic Prussian blue.

Active during the inter-war period, the League became closely linked to, and eventually absorbed by, the Nazi Party. Etymology The term Artamanen had been coined before the First World War by Dr. Willibald Hentschel, a believer in racial purity who had founded his own group, the Mittgart Society, in 1906. The term was a compound noun of art and manen, Middle High German words meaning 'agriculture man', and indicating Hentschell's desire to see Germans retreat from the decadence of the city in order to return to an idyllic rural past.Peter Padfield, Himmler: Reichs F√ºhrer-SS, Cassell & Co, 2001, p. 37 Origins The Artaman League had its roots in the overall Lebensreform movement in late 19th-century and early 20th-century Germany. This movement encompassed hundreds of groups throughout Germany that were involved in various experiments tied to ecology, health, fitness, vegetarianism, and naturism (Nacktkultur). These groups held positions across the political spectrum. The far-right groups ultimately gained a following among the Nazi Party members and their supporters. Publications by right wing Lebensreformists, which sold in the tens of thousands, argued that their practices were \\"the means by which the German race would regenerate itself and ultimately prevail over its neighbours and the diabolical Jews who were intent on injecting putrefying agents into the nation's blood and soil\\". Development Walther Darr√© speaking at a Reichsn√§hrstand assembly under the slogan 'Blut und Boden' (blood and soil) in Goslar, 1937 Although Hentschel had developed his ideas before World War I, the Artaman League first formed in 1923. The Artamans formed part of the German Youth Movement, representing its more right-wing back-to-the-land elements.Heinz H√∂hne, The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS, Penguin Books, 2000, pp. 46-47 Under the leadership of Georg Kenstler they advocated blood-and-soil policies with a strong undercurrent of anti- Slavism.H√∂hne, The Order of the Death's Head, p. 47 This v√∂lkisch movement believed that the decline of the Aryan race could only be halted by encouraging people to abandon city life in favour of settling in the rural areas in the east.Anthony Read, The Devil's Disciples, Pimlico, 2004, p. 159 Whilst members wished to perform agricultural labour as an alternative to military service, they also saw it as part of their duty to violently oppose Slavs and to drive them out of Germany.Louis Leo Snyder, Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, Wordsworth, 1998, p. 12 The concepts were combined in the figure of the Wehrbauer, or soldier-peasant.Heather Pringle, The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust, p39 Accordingly, the League sent German youth to work on the land in Saxony and in East Prussia in an attempt to prevent these areas being settled by Poles. To this end 2000 settlers were sent to Saxony in 1924 ‚Äì both to work on farms and to serve as an anti-Slav militia. They also gave classes on the importance of racial purity and the Nordic race, and on the corrupting influence of city living and of Jews.Heather Pringle, The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust, p. 39‚Äì40, Like many similar right-wing youth movements in Germany, the Artaman League lost impetus as the Nazi Party grew. By 1927, 80% of its membership had become Nazis.Heather Pringle, The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust, p. 40, The League had disappeared by the early 1930s, with most of its membership having switched to the Nazis. Nazi links Heinrich Himmler in 1945 As the situation deteriorated in the late 1920s, some of the Artamans were drawn deeper into politics, and engaged in a holy war against their enemies: liberals, democrats, Free-Masons and Jews. Eventually many members of the Artaman League turned to Nazism. Heinrich Himmler was an early member and held the position of Gauf√ºhrer in Bavaria. Whilst a member of the League, Himmler met Richard Walther Darr√© and the two struck up a close friendship, based largely on Darr√©'s highly developed ideological notions of blood and soil to which Himmler was attracted.

Evans, The Third Reich in Power, Penguin Books, 2006, p. 84 The small league was dismantled and incorporated into the Hitler Jugend in October 1934 as the Nazi youth movement gained strength.LePage, Jean-Denis, The Hitler Youth, 1922-45: An Illustrated History (London: MacFarland, 2009), p. 17 Legacy The development of a number of environmentalist groups and projects in Germany with extreme right wing politics has recently gained media attention. Since the 1990s, far-right environmentalists have taken advantage of cheap farmland made available by the post-Cold War reunification of East and West Germany, establishing themselves in Mecklenburg, \\"in an effort to reinvigorate the traditions of the Artaman League\\". The state government of Rhineland-Palatinate has published a booklet titled Nature Conservation vs Rightwing Extremism in an effort to assist organic farmers who may encounter rightwing extremists. Gudrun Heinrich of the University of Rostock has published a study, Brown Ecologists, in reference to both the current movement and the Nazi Brownshirts. The politically extreme rightwing environmental magazine Umwelt und Aktiv (Environment and Active), is believed to receive support from Germany's far-right National Democratic party (NPD).

Later life and death He married secondly Elizabeth Leyburn (1536‚Äì1567), the eldest daughter of Sir James Leyburne of Cunswick, Westmorland, by whom he had two sons: Francis, who died in infancy, and George (c. 1561 ‚Äì 17 May 1569); and three daughters: Anne (21 March 1557 ‚Äì 19 April 1630), Mary (4 July 1563 ‚Äì 7 April 1578), and Elizabeth (born 12 December 1564). Dacre succeeded his father as Baron Dacre on 18 November 1563, but survived him for less than three years and was never summoned to parliament.Nicholas Harris Nicolas, William Courthope, The Historic Peerage of England (Elibron facsimile edition), p. 139 Ferguson's A History of Cumberland notes the demise of the Dacre family which followed: After Dacre's death on 1 July 1566, his widow remarried Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, but she died in childbirth on 4 September 1567, so that Dacre's young orphaned children were left as members of the Duke's household. Dacre's only surviving son died in 1569, when the barony of Dacre, although claimed by Dacre's brother Leonard, was determined by Commissioners swayed by the Duke to have fallen into abeyance, leaving Dacre's three daughters as co- heiresses. By the age of fourteen, each of the three had been married to one of their step-brothers, the sons of the Duke., accessed 29 December 2010, accessed 29 December 2010, accessed 29 December 2010 In 1571, Anne married Philip Howard (1557‚Äì1595), later 20th Earl of Arundel; before 9 May 1577, Mary had married Thomas Howard (1561‚Äì1626), later 1st Earl of Suffolk; and on 28 October 1577 Elizabeth married Lord William Howard (1563‚Äì1640), of Naworth Castle, Cumberland, and of Henderskelfe Castle, Yorkshire, the Duke's third son. Dacre's daughter Mary Howard died on 7 April 1578 at the age of fourteen, but his eldest child, Anne Howard, survived until 1630. His middle daughter, Elizabeth, gained the nickname \\"Bess of the Broad Apron\\", thanks to the size of the estates which came to her.

Bozeman, 533 U.S. 146 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court decision involving the prosecution of someone who was already serving a criminal sentence for a different crime in a different state.  Background  In circumstances where a state wants to get a person for prosecution who is held in another state, they would file a detainer. That is a legal document telling the other state where the person is imprisoned and to produce him for trial later on in the prosecuting state.. An interstate compact, which was joined by the Federal Government among almost all other states, set forth procedures as to how this process was to be done. The case concerned a specific provision which says that once the prisoner arrives in the receiving state, he must be tried within 120 days. Otherwise, the case must be dismissed.Bozeman, 533 U.S. at 149. The federal government sent Michael Bozeman to Alabama to face charges there. After court preliminaries, the next day he was returned to federal prison and then brought back to Alabama for trial. The trial judge rejected a petition to dismiss the charges for a violation of the Interstate Compact and a divided Alabama Supreme Court reversed.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Breyer explained the question as a simple issue of the exact language in the statute. He noted that it says that in circumstances like the present case, the indictment shall not be of any further force and it should be dismissed. Against pleas by Alabama that the question was technical and the violation small, Breyer replied that \\"[E]ven were we to assume for argument's sake that the Agreement exempts violations that...are de minimis...we could not say that the violation at issue here qualifies as trivial.\\" The decision of the Alabama Supreme Court was affirmed, mandating a dismissal of the indictment against Bozeman in Alabama.

Homo heidelbergensis is shown as diverging into Neanderthals, Denisovans and H. sapiens. With the expansion of H. sapiens after 200 kya, Neanderthals, Denisovans and unspecified archaic African hominins are displayed as again subsumed into the H. sapiens lineage. Possible admixture events involving certain modern populations in Africa are also shown. There is evidence for interbreeding between archaic and modern humans during the Middle Paleolithic and early Upper Paleolithic. The interbreeding happened in several independent events that included Neanderthals and Denisovans, as well as several unidentified hominins. In Eurasia, interbreeding between Neanderthals and Denisovans with modern humans took place several times. The introgression events into modern humans are estimated to have happened about 47,000‚Äì65,000 years ago with Neanderthals and about 44,000‚Äì54,000 years ago with Denisovans. Neanderthal-derived DNA has been found in the genomes of most or possibly all contemporary populations, varying noticeably by region. It accounts for 1‚Äì4% of modern genomes for people outside Sub-Saharan Africa, although estimates vary, and either none or possibly up to 0.3% ‚Äî according to recent research ‚Äî for those in Africa. It is highest in East Asians, intermediate in Europeans, and lower in Southeast Asians. According to some evidence, it is also lower in Melanesians compared to both East Asians and Europeans. However, some research finds higher Neanderthal admixture in Oceanians, as well as in Native American groups, than in Europeans (though not higher than in East Asians). Denisovan-derived ancestry is largely absent from modern populations in Africa and Western Eurasia. The highest rates, by far, of Denisovan admixture have been found in Oceanian and some Southeast Asian populations, with an estimated 4‚Äì6% of the genome of modern Melanesians being derived from Denisovans. While some southeast Asian Negrito populations carry Denisovan admixture, others have none, such as the Andamanese. In addition, low traces of Denisovan-derived ancestry have been found in mainland Asia, with a relative elevated Denisovan ancestry in East Asian and South Asian populations. In Africa, archaic alleles consistent with several independent admixture events in the subcontinent have been found. It is currently unknown who these archaic African hominins were. Although the narratives of human evolution are often contentious, DNA evidence shows that human evolution should not be seen as a simple linear or branched progression, but a mix of related species. In fact, genomic research has shown that hybridization between substantially diverged lineages is the rule, not the exception, in human evolution. Furthermore, it is argued that hybridization was an essential driving force in the emergence of modern humans. Neanderthals =Genetics=  Proportion of admixture  Reconstruction of a Neanderthal woman. On 7 May 2010, following the genome sequencing of three Vindija Neanderthals, a draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome was published and revealed that Neanderthals shared more alleles with Eurasian populations (e.g. French, Han Chinese, and Papua New Guinean) than with sub-Saharan African populations (e.g. Yoruba and San). According to Green et al. (2010), the observed excess of genetic similarity is best explained by recent gene flow from Neanderthals to modern humans after the migration out of Africa. They estimated the proportion of Neanderthal-derived ancestry to be 1‚Äì4% of the Eurasian genome. Pr√ºfer et al. (2013) estimated the proportion to be 1.5‚Äì2.1% for non-Africans, Lohse and Frantz (2014) infer a higher rate of 3.4‚Äì7.3% in Eurasia. In 2017, Pr√ºfer et al. revised their estimate to 1.8‚Äì2.6% for non-Africans outside Oceania. According to a later study by Chen et al. (2020), Africans (specifically, the 1000 Genomes African populations) also have Neanderthal admixture, with this Neanderthal admixture in African individuals accounting for 17 megabases, which is 0.3% of their genome. According to the authors, Africans gained their Neanderthal admixture predominantly from a back-migration by peoples (modern humans carrying Neanderthal admixture) that had diverged from ancestral Europeans (postdating the split between East Asians and Europeans). This back-migration is proposed to have happened about 20,000 years ago. However, some scientists, such as geneticist David Reich, dispute the study's conclusions.  Introgressed genome  About 20% of the Neanderthal genome has been found introgressed or assimilated in the modern human population (by analyzing East Asians and Europeans), but the figure has also been estimated at about a third.  Subpopulation admixture rate  A higher Neanderthal admixture was found in East Asians than in Europeans, which is estimated to be about 20% more introgression into East Asians. This could possibly be explained by the occurrence of further admixture events in the early ancestors of East Asians after the separation of Europeans and East Asians, dilution of Neanderthal ancestry in Europeans by populations with low Neanderthal ancestry from later migrations, or natural selection that may have been relatively lower in East Asians than in Europeans. Studies simulating admixture models indicate that a reduced efficacy of purifying selection against Neanderthal alleles in East Asians could not account for the greater proportion of Neanderthal ancestry of East Asians, thus favoring more-complex models involving additional pulses of Neanderthal introgression into East Asians. Such models show a pulse to ancestral Eurasians, followed by separation and an additional pulse to ancestral East Asians. It is observed that there is a small but significant variation of Neanderthal admixture rates within European populations, but no significant variation within East Asian populations. Pr√ºfer et al. (2017) remarked that East Asians carry more Neanderthal DNA (2.3‚Äì2.6%) than Western Eurasians (1.8‚Äì2.4%). It was later determined by Chen et al. (2020) that East Asians have 8% more Neanderthal ancestry, revised from the previous reports of 20% more Neanderthal ancestry, compared to Europeans. This stems from the fact that Neanderthal ancestry shared with Africans had been masked, because Africans were thought to have no Neanderthal admixture and were therefore used as reference samples. Thus, any overlap in Neanderthal admixture with Africans resulted in an underestimation of Neanderthal admixture in non-Africans and especially in Europeans. The authors give a single pulse of Neanderthal admixture after the out-of-Africa dispersal as the most parsimonious explanation for the enrichment in East Asians, but they add that variation in Neanderthal ancestry may also be attributed to dilution to account for the now-more-modest differences found. As a proportion of the total amount of Neanderthal sequence for each population, 7.2% of the sequence in Europeans is shared exclusively with Africans, while 2% of the sequence in East Asians is shared exclusively with Africans. Genomic analysis suggests that there is a global division in Neanderthal introgression between sub-Saharan African populations and other modern human groups (including North Africans) rather than between African and non-African populations. North African groups share a similar excess of derived alleles with Neanderthals as do non-African populations, whereas sub-Saharan African groups are the only modern human populations that generally did not experience Neanderthal admixture. The Neanderthal genetic signal among North African populations was found to vary depending on the relative quantity of autochthonous North African, European, Near Eastern and sub-Saharan ancestry. Using f4 ancestry ratio statistical analysis, the Neanderthal inferred admixture was observed to be: highest among the North African populations with maximal autochthonous North African ancestry such as Tunisian Berbers, where it was at the same level or even higher than that of Eurasian populations (100‚Äì138%); high among North African populations carrying greater European or Near Eastern admixture, such as groups in North Morocco and Egypt (‚àº60‚Äì70%); and lowest among North African populations with greater Sub-Saharan admixture, such as in South Morocco (20%). Quinto et al. (2012) therefore postulate that the presence of this Neanderthal genetic signal in Africa is not due to recent gene flow from Near Eastern or European populations since it is higher among populations bearing indigenous pre-Neolithic North African ancestry. Low but significant rates of Neanderthal admixture has also been observed for the Maasai of East Africa. After identifying African and non-African ancestry among the Maasai, it can be concluded that recent non-African modern human (post-Neanderthal) gene flow was the source of the contribution since around an estimated 30% of the Maasai genome can be traced to non-African introgression from about 100 generations ago.  Distance to lineages  Le Moustier Neanderthal skull reconstitution, Neues Museum Berlin Presenting a high-quality genome sequence of a female Altai Neanderthal, it has been found that the Neanderthal component in non-African modern humans is more related to the Mezmaiskaya Neanderthal (Caucasus) than to the Altai Neanderthal (Siberia) or the Vindija Neanderthals (Croatia). By high-coverage sequencing the genome of a 50,000-year-old female Vindija Neanderthal fragment, it was later found that the Vindija and Mezmaiskaya Neanderthals did not seem to differ in the extent of their allele-sharing with modern humans. In this case, it was also found that the Neanderthal component in non-African modern humans is more closely related to the Vindija and Mezmaiskaya Neanderthals than to the Altai Neanderthal. These results suggest that a majority of the admixture into modern humans came from Neanderthal populations that had diverged (about 80‚Äì100kya) from the Vindija and Mezmaiskaya Neanderthal lineages before the latter two diverged from each other. Analyzing chromosome 21 of the Altai (Siberia), El Sidr√≥n (Spain), and Vindija (Croatia) Neanderthals, it is determined that‚Äîof these three lineages‚Äîonly the El Sidr√≥n and Vindija Neanderthals display significant rates of gene flow (0.3‚Äì2.6%) into modern humans, suggesting that the El Sidr√≥n and Vindija Neanderthals are more closely related than the Altai Neanderthal to the Neanderthals that interbred with modern humans about 47,000‚Äì65,000 years ago. Conversely, it is also determined that significant rates of modern human gene flow into Neanderthals occurred‚Äîof the three examined lineages‚Äîfor only the Altai Neanderthal (0.1‚Äì2.1%), suggesting that modern human gene flow into Neanderthals mainly took place after the separation of the Altai Neanderthals from the El Sidr√≥n and Vindija Neanderthals that occurred roughly 110,000 years ago. The findings show that the source of modern human gene flow into Neanderthals originated from a population of early modern humans from about 100,000 years ago, predating the out-of-Africa migration of the modern human ancestors of present-day non-Africans.  Mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome  No evidence of Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA has been found in modern humans. This suggests that successful Neanderthal admixture happened in pairings with Neanderthal males and modern human females. Possible hypotheses are that Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA had detrimental mutations that led to the extinction of carriers, that the hybrid offspring of Neanderthal mothers were raised in Neanderthal groups and became extinct with them, or that female Neanderthals and male Sapiens did not produce fertile offspring. As shown in an interbreeding model produced by Neves and Serva (2012), the Neanderthal admixture in modern humans may have been caused by a very low rate of interbreeding between modern humans and Neanderthals, with the exchange of one pair of individuals between the two populations in about every 77 generations. This low rate of interbreeding would account for the absence of Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA from the modern human gene pool as found in earlier studies, as the model estimates a probability of only 7% for a Neanderthal origin of both mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome in modern humans.  Reduced contribution  There is a presence of large genomic regions with strongly reduced Neanderthal contribution in modern humans due to negative selection, partly caused by hybrid male infertility. These large regions of low Neanderthal contribution were most-pronounced on the X chromosome‚Äîwith fivefold lower Neanderthal ancestry compared to autosomes. They also contained relatively high numbers of genes specific to testes. This means that modern humans have relatively few Neanderthal genes that are located on the X chromosome or expressed in the testes, suggesting male infertility as a probable cause. It may be partly affected by hemizygosity of X chromosome genes in males. Deserts of Neanderthal sequences may also be caused by genetic drift involving intense bottlenecks in the modern human population and background selection as a result of strong selection against deleterious Neanderthal alleles. The overlap of many deserts of Neanderthal and Denisovan sequences suggests that repeated loss of archaic DNA occur at specific loci. It has also been shown that Neanderthal ancestry has been selected against in conserved biological pathways, such as RNA processing. Consistent with the hypothesis that purifying selection has reduced Neanderthal contribution in present-day modern human genomes, Upper Paleolithic Eurasian modern humans (such as the Tianyuan modern human) carry more Neanderthal DNA (about 4‚Äì5%) than present-day Eurasian modern humans (about 1‚Äì2%). Rates of selection against Neanderthal sequences varied for European and Asian populations.  Changes in modern humans  In Eurasia, modern humans acquired adaptive introgression from archaic humans, which provided a source of advantageous genetic variants that are adapted to local environments and a reservoir for additional genetic variation. Adaptive introgression from Neanderthals has targeted genes involved with keratin filaments, sugar metabolism, muscle contraction, body fat distribution, enamel thickness, and oocyte meiosis, as well as brain size and functioning. There are signals of positive selection, as the result of adaptation to diverse habitats, in genes involved with variation in skin pigmentation and hair morphology. In the immune system, introgressed variants have heavily contributed to the diversity of immune genes, of which there's an enrichment of introgressed alleles that suggest a strong positive selection. Genes affecting keratin were found to have been introgressed from Neanderthals into modern humans (shown in East Asians and Europeans), suggesting that these genes gave a morphological adaptation in skin and hair to modern humans to cope with non-African environments. This is likewise for several genes involved in medical-relevant phenotypes, such as those affecting systemic lupus erythematosus, primary biliary cirrhosis, Crohn's disease, optic disk size, smoking behavior, interleukin 18 levels, and diabetes mellitus type 2. Researchers found Neanderthal introgression of 18 genes‚Äîseveral of which are related to UV-light adaptation‚Äîwithin the chromosome 3p21.31 region (HYAL region) of East Asians. The introgressive haplotypes were positively selected in only East Asian populations, rising steadily from 45,000 years BP until a sudden increase of growth rate around 5,000 to 3,500 years BP. They occur at very high frequencies among East Asian populations in contrast to other Eurasian populations (e.g. European and South Asian populations). The findings also suggests that this Neanderthal introgression occurred within the ancestral population shared by East Asians and Native Americans. Evans et al. (2006) had previously suggested that a group of alleles collectively known as haplogroup D of microcephalin, a critical regulatory gene for brain volume, originated from an archaic human population. The results show that haplogroup D introgressed 37,000 years ago (based on the coalescence age of derived D alleles) into modern humans from an archaic human population that separated 1.1 million years ago (based on the separation time between D and non-D alleles), consistent with the period when Neanderthals and modern humans co-existed and diverged respectively. The high frequency of the D haplogroup (70%) suggest that it was positively selected for in modern humans. The distribution of the D allele of microcephalin is high outside Africa but low in sub-Saharan Africa, which further suggest that the admixture event happened in archaic Eurasian populations. This distribution difference between Africa and Eurasia suggests that the D allele originated from Neanderthals according to Lari et al. (2010), but they found that a Neanderthal individual from the Mezzena Rockshelter (Monti Lessini, Italy) was homozygous for an ancestral allele of microcephalin, thus providing no support that Neanderthals contributed the D allele to modern humans and also not excluding the possibility of a Neanderthal origin of the D allele. Green et al. (2010), having analyzed the Vindija Neanderthals, also could not confirm a Neanderthal origin of haplogroup D of the microcephalin gene. It has been found that HLA-A*02, A*26/*66, B*07, B*51, C*07:02, and C*16:02 of the immune system were contributed from Neanderthals to modern humans. After migrating out of Africa, modern humans encountered and interbred with archaic humans, which was advantageous for modern humans in rapidly restoring HLA diversity and acquiring new HLA variants that are better adapted to local pathogens. It is found that introgressed Neanderthal genes exhibit cis- regulatory effects in modern humans, contributing to the genomic complexity and phenotype variation of modern humans. Looking at heterozygous individuals (carrying both Neanderthal and modern human versions of a gene), the allele- specific expression of introgressed Neanderthal alleles was found to be significantly lower in the brain and testes relative to other tissues. In the brain, this was most pronounced at the cerebellum and basal ganglia. This downregulation suggests that modern humans and Neanderthals possibly experienced a relative higher rate of divergence in these specific tissues. Furthermore, correlating the genotypes of introgressed Neanderthal alleles with the expression of nearby genes, it is found that archaic alleles contribute proportionally more to variation in expression than nonarchaic alleles. Neanderthal alleles affect expression of the immunologically genes OAS1/2/3 and TLR1/6/10, which can be specific to cell-type and is influenced by environmental stimuli. Studying the high-coverage female Vindija Neanderthal genome, Pr√ºfer et al. (2017) identified several Neanderthal- derived gene variants, including those that affect levels of LDL cholesterol and vitamin D, and has influence on eating disorders, visceral fat accumulation, rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia, as well as the response to antipsychotic drugs. Examining European modern humans in regards to the Altai Neanderthal genome in high-coverage, results show that Neanderthal admixture is associated with several changes in cranium and underlying brain morphology, suggesting changes in neurological function through Neanderthal-derived genetic variation. Neanderthal admixture is associated with an expansion of the posterolateral area of the modern human skull, extending from the occipital and inferior parietal bones to bilateral temporal locales. In regards to modern human brain morphology, Neanderthal admixture is positively correlated with an increase in sulcal depth for the right intraparietal sulcus and an increase in cortical complexity for the early visual cortex of the left hemisphere. Neanderthal admixture is also positively correlated with an increase in white and gray matter volume localized to the right parietal region adjacent to the right intraparietal sulcus. In the area overlapping the primary visual cortex gyrification in the left hemisphere, Neanderthal admixture is positively correlated with gray matter volume. The results also show evidence for a negative correlation between Neanderthal admixture and white matter volume in the orbitofrontal cortex. In Papuans, assimilated Neanderthal inheritance is found in highest frequency in genes expressed in the brain, whereas Denisovan DNA has the highest frequency in genes expressed in bones and other tissues.  Population substructure theory  Although less parsimonious than recent gene flow, the observation may have been due to ancient population sub-structure in Africa, causing incomplete genetic homogenization within modern humans when Neanderthals diverged while early ancestors of Eurasians were still more closely related to Neanderthals than those of Africans to Neanderthals. On the basis of allele frequency spectrum, it was shown that the recent admixture model had the best fit to the results while the ancient population sub-structure model had no fit‚Äìdemonstrating that the best model was a recent admixture event that was preceded by a bottleneck event among modern humans‚Äîthus confirming recent admixture as the most parsimonious and plausible explanation for the observed excess of genetic similarities between modern non-African humans and Neanderthals. On the basis of linkage disequilibrium patterns, a recent admixture event is likewise confirmed by the data. From the extent of linkage disequilibrium, it was estimated that the last Neanderthal gene flow into early ancestors of Europeans occurred 47,000‚Äì65,000 years BP. In conjunction with archaeological and fossil evidence, the gene flow is thought likely to have occurred somewhere in Western Eurasia, possibly the Middle East. Through another approach‚Äîusing one genome each of a Neanderthal, Eurasian, African, and chimpanzee (outgroup), and dividing it into non-recombining short sequence blocks‚Äîto estimate genome-wide maximum-likelihood under different models, an ancient population sub-structure in Africa was ruled out and a Neanderthal admixture event was confirmed. =Morphology= The early Upper Paleolithic burial remains of a modern human child from Abrigo do Lagar Velho (Portugal) features traits that indicate Neanderthal interbreeding with modern humans dispersing into Iberia. Considering the dating of the burial remains (24,500 years BP) and the persistence of Neanderthal traits long after the transitional period from a Neanderthal to a modern human population in Iberia (28,000‚Äì30,000 years BP), the child may have been a descendant of an already heavily admixed population. The remains of an early Upper Paleolithic modern human from Pe»ôtera Muierilor (Romania) of 35,000 years BP shows a morphological pattern of European early modern humans, but possesses archaic or Neanderthal features, suggesting European early modern humans interbreeding with Neanderthals. These features include a large interorbital breadth, a relatively flat superciliary arches, a prominent occipital bun, an asymmetrical and shallow mandibular notch shape, a high mandibular coronoid processus, the relative perpendicular mandibular condyle to notch crest position, and a narrow scapular glenoid fossa. The modern human Oase 2 skull (cast depicted), found in Pe≈ütera cu Oase, displays archaic traits due to possible hybridization with Neanderthals. The early modern human Oase 1 mandible from Pe»ôtera cu Oase (Romania) of 34,000‚Äì36,000 14C years BP presents a mosaic of modern, archaic, and possible Neanderthal features. It displays a lingual bridging of the mandibular foramen, not present in earlier humans except Neanderthals of the late Middle and Late Pleistocene, thus suggesting affinity with Neanderthals. Concluding from the Oase 1 mandible, there was apparently a significant craniofacial change of early modern humans from at least Europe, possibly due to some degree of admixture with Neanderthals. The earliest (before about 33 ka BP) European modern humans and the subsequent (Middle Upper Paleolithic) Gravettians, falling anatomically largely inline with the earliest (Middle Paleolithic) African modern humans, also show traits that are distinctively Neanderthal, suggesting that a solely Middle Paleolithic modern human ancestry was unlikely for European early modern humans. A late-Neanderthal jaw (more specifically, a corpus mandibulae remnant) from the Mezzena rockshelter (Monti Lessini, Italy) shows indications of a possible interbreeding in late Italian Neanderthals. The jaw falls within the morphological range of modern humans, but also displayed strong similarities with some of the other Neanderthal specimens, indicating a change in late Neanderthal morphology due to possible interbreeding with modern humans. However, a more recent aDNA analysis of this jaw has shown that it does not belong to a Neanderthal, but to a fully modern human of the Holocene. Previous reports of a Mezzena \\"Neanderthal hybrid\\" were based on a faulty DNA analysis. Manot 1, a partial calvarium of a modern human that was recently discovered at the Manot Cave (Western Galilee, Israel) and dated to 54.7¬±5.5 kyr BP, represents the first fossil evidence from the period when modern humans successfully migrated out of Africa and colonized Eurasia. It also provides the first fossil evidence that modern humans inhabited the southern Levant during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic interface, contemporaneously with the Neanderthals and close to the probable interbreeding event. The morphological features suggest that the Manot population may be closely related to or given rise to the first modern humans who later successfully colonized Europe to establish early Upper Palaeolithic populations. =History= The interbreeding has been discussed ever since the discovery of Neanderthal remains in the 19th century, though earlier writers believed that Neanderthals were a direct ancestor of modern humans. Thomas Huxley suggested that many Europeans bore traces of Neanderthal ancestry, but associated Neanderthal characteristics with primitivism, writing that since they \\"belong to a stage in the development of the human species, antecedent to the differentiation of any of the existing races, we may expect to find them in the lowest of these races, all over the world, and in the early stages of all races\\". Until the early 1950s, most scholars thought Neanderthals were not in the ancestry of living humans. Nevertheless, in 1904 Thomas H. Huxley saw among Frisians the presence of what he suspected to be Neanderthaloid skeletal and cranial characteristics as an evolutionary development from Neanderthal rather than as a result of interbreeding, saying that \\"the blond long-heads may exhibit one of the lines of evolution of the men of the Neanderthaloid type\\", yet he raised the possibility that the Frisians alternatively \\"may be the result of the admixture of the blond long-heads with Neanderthal men\\", thus separating \\"blond\\" from \\"Neanderthaloid.\\" Hans Peder Steensby proposed interbreeding in 1907 in the article Race studies in Denmark. He strongly emphasised that all living humans are of mixed origins. He held that this would best fit observations, and challenged the widespread idea that Neanderthals were ape-like or inferior. Basing his argument primarily on cranial data, he noted that the Danes, like the Frisians and the Dutch, exhibit some Neanderthaloid characteristics, and felt it was reasonable to \\"assume something was inherited\\" and that Neanderthals \\"are among our ancestors.\\" Carleton Stevens Coon in 1962 found it likely, based upon evidence from cranial data and material culture, that Neanderthal and Upper Paleolithic peoples either interbred or that the newcomers reworked Neanderthal implements \\"into their own kind of tools.\\" By the early 2000s, the majority of scholars supported the Out of Africa hypothesis,. \\"Currently available genetic and archaeological evidence is supportive of a recent single origin of modern humans in East Africa. However, this is where the consensus on human settlement history ends, and considerable uncertainty clouds any more detailed aspect of human colonization history.\\" according to which anatomically modern humans left Africa about 50,000 years ago and replaced Neanderthals with little or no interbreeding. Yet some scholars still argued for hybridisation with Neanderthals. The most vocal proponent of the hybridisation hypothesis was Erik Trinkaus of Washington University.Dan Jones: The Neanderthal within., New Scientist 193.2007, H. 2593 (3 March), 28‚Äì32. Modern Humans, Neanderthals May Have Interbred ; Humans and Neanderthals interbred Trinkaus claimed various fossils as products of hybridised populations, including the skeleton of a child found at Lagar Velho in Portugal and the Pe»ôtera Muierii skeletons from Romania. Denisovans =Genetics= The Denisovan genome was sequenced from the distal manual phalanx fragment (replica depicted) found in the Denisova cave. Proportion of admixture It has been shown that Melanesians (e.g. Papua New Guinean and Bougainville Islander) share relatively more alleles with Denisovans when compared to other Eurasians and Africans. It is estimated that 4% to 6% of the genome in Melanesians derives from Denisovans, while no other Eurasians or Africans displayed contributions of the Denisovan genes. It has been observed that Denisovans contributed genes to Melanesians but not to East Asians, indicating that there was interaction between the early ancestors of Melanesians with Denisovans but that this interaction did not take place in the regions near southern Siberia, where as- of-yet the only Denisovan remains have been found. In addition, Aboriginal Australians and Indians also show a relative increased allele sharing with Denisovans, compared to other Eurasians and African populations, consistent with the hypothesis of increased admixture between Denisovans and Melanesians. Reich et al. (2011) produced evidence that the highest presence of Denisovan admixture is in Oceanian populations, followed by many Southeast Asian populations, and none in East Asian populations. There is significant Denisovan genetic material in eastern Southeast Asian and Oceanian populations (e.g. Aboriginal Australians, Indians, Near Oceanians, Polynesians, Fijians, eastern Indonesians, Philippine Mamanwa and Manobo), but not in certain western and continental Southeast Asian populations (e.g. western Indonesians, Malaysian Jehai, Andaman Onge, and mainland Asians), indicating that the Denisovan admixture event happened in Southeast Asia itself rather than mainland Eurasia. The observation of high Denisovan admixture in Oceania and the lack thereof in mainland Asia suggests that early modern humans and Denisovans had interbred east of the Wallace Line that divides Southeast Asia according to Cooper and Stringer (2013). Skoglund and Jakobsson (2011) observed that particularly Oceanians, followed by Southeast Asians populations, have a high Denisovans admixture relative to other populations. Furthermore, they found possible low traces of Denisovan admixture in East Asians and no Denisovan admixture in Native Americans. In contrast, Pr√ºfer et al. (2013) found that mainland Asian and Native American populations may have a 0.2% Denisovan contribution, which is about twenty-five times lower than Oceanian populations. The manner of gene flow to these populations remains unknown. However, Wall et al. (2013) stated that they found no evidence for Denisovan admixture in East Asians. Findings indicate that the Denisovan gene flow event happened to the common ancestors of Aboriginal Filipinos, Aboriginal Australians, and New Guineans. New Guineans and Australians have similar rates of Denisovan admixture, indicating that interbreeding took place prior to their common ancestors' entry into Sahul (Pleistocene New Guinea and Australia), at least 44,000 years ago. It has also been observed that the fraction of Near Oceanian ancestry in Southeast Asians is proportional to the Denisovan admixture, except in the Philippines where there is a higher proportional Denisovan admixture to Near Oceanian ancestry. Reich et al. (2011) suggested a possible model of an early eastward migration wave of modern humans, some who were Philippine/New Guinean/Australian common ancestors that interbred with Denisovans, respectively followed by divergence of the Philippine early ancestors, interbreeding between the New Guinean and Australian early ancestors with a part of the same early-migration population that did not experience Denisovan gene flow, and interbreeding between the Philippine early ancestors with a part of the population from a much-later eastward migration wave (the other part of the migrating population would become East Asians). Finding components of Denisovan introgression with differing relatedness to the sequenced Denisovan, Browning et al. (2018) suggested that at least two separate episodes of Denisovan admixture has occurred. Specifically, introgression from two distinct Denisovan populations is observed in East Asians (e.g. Japanese and Han Chinese), whereas South Asians (e.g. Telugu and Punjabi) and Oceanians (e.g. Papuans) display introgression from one Denisovan population. Exploring derived alleles from Denisovans, Sankararaman et al. (2016) estimated that the date of Denisovan admixture was 44,000‚Äì54,000 years ago. They also determined that the Denisovan admixture was the greatest in Oceanian populations compared to other populations with observed Denisovan ancestry (i.e. America, Central Asia, East Asia, and South Asia). The researchers also made the surprising finding that South Asian populations display an elevated Denisovan admixture (when compared to other non-Oceanian populations with Denisovan ancestry), albeit the highest estimate (which are found in Sherpas) is still ten times lower than in Papuans. They suggest two possible explanations: There was a single Denisovan introgression event that was followed by dilution to different extents or at least three distinct pulses of Denisovan introgressions must have occurred. It has been shown that Eurasians have some but significantly lesser archaic- derived genetic material that overlaps with Denisovans, stemming from the fact that Denisovans are related to Neanderthals‚Äîwho contributed to the Eurasian gene pool‚Äîrather than from interbreeding of Denisovans with the early ancestors of those Eurasians. The skeletal remains of an early modern human from the Tianyuan cave (near Zhoukoudian, China) of 40,000 years BP showed a Neanderthal contribution within the range of today's Eurasian modern humans, but it had no discernible Denisovan contribution. It is a distant relative to the ancestors of many Asian and Native American populations, but post-dated the divergence between Asians and Europeans. The lack of a Denisovan component in the Tianyuan individual suggests that the genetic contribution had been always scarce in the mainland. Reduced contribution There are large genomic regions devoid of Denisovan-derived ancestry, partly explained by infertility of male hybrids, as suggested by the lower proportion of Denisovan-derived ancestry on X chromosomes and in genes that are expressed in the testes of modern humans. Changes in modern humans Exploring the immune system's HLA alleles, it has been suggested that HLA-B*73 introgressed from Denisovans into modern humans in western Asia due to the distribution pattern and divergence of HLA-B*73 from other HLA alleles. Even though HLA-B*73 is not present in the sequenced Denisovan genome, HLA-B*73 was shown to be closely associated to the Denisovan-derived HLA-C*15:05 from the linkage disequilibrium. From phylogenetic analysis, however, it has been concluded that it is highly likely that HLA-B*73 was ancestral. The Denisovan's two HLA-A (A*02 and A*11) and two HLA-C (C*15 and C*12:02) allotypes correspond to common alleles in modern humans, whereas one of the Denisovan's HLA-B allotype corresponds to a rare recombinant allele and the other is absent in modern humans. It is thought that these must have been contributed from Denisovans to modern humans, because it is unlikely to have been preserved independently in both for so long due to HLA alleles' high mutation rate. Tibetan people received an advantageous EGLN1 and EPAS1 gene variant, associated with hemoglobin concentration and response to hypoxia, for life at high altitudes from the Denisovans. The ancestral variant of EPAS1 upregulates hemoglobin levels to compensate for low oxygen levels‚Äîsuch as at high altitudes‚Äîbut this also has the maladaption of increasing blood viscosity. The Denisovan-derived variant on the other hand limits this increase of hemoglobin levels, thus resulting in a better altitude adaption. The Denisovan-derived EPAS1 gene variant is common in Tibetans and was positively selected in their ancestors after they colonized the Tibetan plateau.  Archaic African hominins  Rapid decay of fossils in Sub-Saharan African environments makes it currently unfeasible to compare modern human admixture with reference samples of archaic Sub-Saharan African hominins. From three candidate regions with introgression found by searching for unusual patterns of variations (showing deep haplotype divergence, unusual patterns of linkage disequilibrium, and small basal clade size) in 61 non-coding regions from two hunter-gatherer groups (Biaka Pygmies and San who have significant admixture) and one West African agricultural group (Mandinka, who don't have significant admixture), it is concluded that roughly 2% of the genetic material found in the Biaka Pygmies and San was inserted into the human genome approximately 35,000 years ago from archaic hominins that separated from the ancestors of the modern human lineage around 700,000 years ago. A survey for the introgressive haplotypes across many Sub- Saharan populations suggest that this admixture event happened with archaic hominins who once inhabited Central Africa. Researching high-coverage whole- genome sequences of fifteen Sub-Saharan hunter-gatherer males from three groups‚Äîfive Pygmies (three Baka, a Bedzan, and a Bakola) from Cameroon, five Hadza from Tanzania, and five Sandawe from Tanzania‚Äîthere are signs that the ancestors of the hunter-gatherers interbred with one or more archaic human populations, probably over 40,000 years ago. Analysis of putative introgressive haplotypes in the fifteen hunter-gatherer samples suggests that the archaic African population and modern humans diverged around 1.2 to 1.3 million years ago. Xu et al. (2017) analyzed the evolution of the Mucin 7 protein in the saliva of modern humans and found evidence that an unidentified ghost population of archaic African humans may have contributed DNA, with an estimated coalescence time to modern humans of about 4.5 million years BP, into the gene pool of modern Africans (e.g. African-American, African- Caribbean, Esan, Gambian, Luhya, Mende, and Yoruba people). According to a study published in 2020, there are indications that 2% to 19% (or about ‚âÉ6.6 and ‚âÉ7.0%) of the DNA of four West African populations may have come from an unknown archaic hominin which split from the ancestor of humans and Neanderthals between 360 kya to 1.02 mya. However, the study also suggests that at least part of this archaic admixture is also present in Eurasians/non- Africans, and that the admixture event or events range from 0 to 124 ka B.P, which includes the period before the Out-of-Africa migration and prior to the African/Eurasian split (thus affecting in part the common ancestors of both Africans and Eurasians/non-Africans). \\"Non-African populations (Han Chinese in Beijing and Utah residents with northern and western European ancestry) also show analogous patterns in the CSFS, suggesting that a component of archaic ancestry was shared before the split of African and non-African populations...One interpretation of the recent time of introgression that we document is that archaic forms persisted in Africa until fairly recently. Alternately, the archaic population could have introgressed earlier into a modern human population, which then subsequently interbred with the ancestors of the populations that we have analyzed here. The models that we have explored here are not mutually exclusive, and it is plausible that the history of African populations includes genetic contributions from multiple divergent populations, as evidenced by the large effective population size associated with the introgressing archaic population...Given the uncertainty in our estimates of the time of introgression, we wondered whether jointly analyzing the CSFS from both the CEU (Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry) and YRI genomes could provide additional resolution. Under model C, we simulated introgression before and after the split between African and non- African populations and observed qualitative differences between the two models in the high-frequency‚Äìderived allele bins of the CSFS in African and non-African populations (fig. S40). Using ABC to jointly fit the high- frequency‚Äìderived allele bins of the CSFS in CEU and YRI (defined as greater than 50% frequency), we find that the lower limit on the 95% credible interval of the introgression time is older than the simulated split between CEU and YRI (2800 versus 2155 generations B.P.), indicating that at least part of the archaic lineages seen in the YRI are also shared with the CEU...\\" Supplementary Materials for Recovering signals of ghost archaic introgression in African populations\\", section \\"S8.2\\" \\"We simulated data using the same priors in Section S5.2, but computed the spectrum for both YRI [West African Yoruba] and CEU [a population of European origin] . We found that the best fitting parameters were an archaic split time of 27,000 generations ago (95% HPD: 26,000-28,000), admixture fraction of 0.09 (95% HPD: 0.04-0.17), admixture time of 3,000 generations ago (95% HPD: 2,800-3,400), and an effective population size of 19,700 individuals (95% HPD: 19,300-20,200). We find that the lower bound of the admixture time is further back than the simulated split between CEU and YRI (2155 generations ago), providing some evidence in favor of a pre-Out-of-Africa event. This model suggests that many populations outside of Africa should also contain haplotypes from this introgression event, though detection is difficult because many methods use unadmixed outgroups to detect introgressed haplotypes [Browning et al., 2018, Skov et al., 2018, Durvasula and Sankararaman, 2019] (5, 53, 22). It is also possible that some of these haplotypes were lost during the Out-of-Africa bottleneck.\\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/suppl/2020/02/10/6.7.eaax5097.DC1/aax5097_SM.pdf Another recent study, which discovered substantial amounts of previously undescribed human genetic variation, also found ancestral genetic variation in Africans that predates modern humans and was lost in most non-Africans. \\"An analysis of archaic sequences in modern populations identifies ancestral genetic variation in African populations that likely predates modern humans and has been lost in most non-African populations...We found small amounts of Neanderthal ancestry in West African genomes, most likely reflecting Eurasian admixture. Despite their very low levels or absence of archaic ancestry, African populations share many Neanderthal and Denisovan variants that are absent from Eurasia, reflecting how a larger proportion of the ancestral human variation has been maintained in Africa.\\" Related studies In 2019, scientists discovered evidence, based on genetics studies using artificial intelligence (AI), that suggest the existence of an unknown human ancestor species, not Neanderthal or Denisovan, in the genome of modern humans.

Description and history The Benjamin Bushnell Farm is located in a rural setting of southern Essex, on between Ingham Hill Road and Connecticut Route 153. The property includes five buildings. The main house is a c. 1790 Federal style structure, five bays wide, with a central chimney. Its main entrance has a fine Federal surround, with delicate pilasters supporting a corniced entablature. The barn, with attached silo, is of 19th century origin, and the three remaining buildings are smaller, including a rare surviving cranberry house. The latter is evidence that the Bushnells and their successors actually cultivated cranberries, rather than just harvesting wild ones. and The property was owned from the late 17th century by the Bushnell family, settlers of Old Saybrook. The house was built by Benjamin Bushnell, and is a good example of a vernacular colonial style house, to which Federal details, likely inspired by the publications of Asher Benjamin, were applied. The property remained in the Bushnell family until 1879, when it was purchased by William Sisson. Sisson is credited with introducing the cultivation of cranberries to the area, using bogs on the property and damming two ponds to flood them on a seasonal basis.

It is centered around the town of Sarlat-la-Can√©da.  Etymology  The name P√©rigord noir ‚Äî black P√©rigord ‚Äî is derived from the dark colour of its evergreen oak forests (Quercus ilex) and also from the dark, fertile soil in the Sarladais ‚Äî and not, as often asserted, from the black truffle. Historically the P√©rigord noir is the oldest of the four subdivisions of the P√©rigord.  Geography  Geographically the P√©rigord noir takes up the Southeast of the Dordogne d√©partement. It is surrounded by the following natural regions: * P√©rigord central and Brive basin in the North * Causse de Martel and Causse de Gramat in the East * Bouriane in the South * Haut-Agenais and Bergeracois in the West. Further natural subdivisions within the P√©rigord noir are: * the woodlands of the Barade * the woodlands of the Bess√®de * Pays au Bois * Pays de F√©nelon * Pays de L√©mance The term P√©rigord noir has to be clearly distinguished from the similar term Pays du P√©rigord noir used mainly in tourism. The term Pays du P√©rigord noir is much broader than P√©rigord noir, as it includes the Pays d'Hautefort further North, which is normally attributed to the P√©rigord central. = Administration = In administrative terms the P√©rigord noir is covered today mainly by the Arrondissement of Sarlat-la-Can√©da. The following cantons constitute the P√©rigord noir: * Canton of Sarlat-la-Can√©da * Canton of Terrasson-Lavilledieu * Canton of Vall√©e Dordogne * Canton of Vall√©e de l'Homme The Canton of Haut-P√©rigord Noir is only partially represented.  Hydrography  Confluence of the Dordogne (right) and the V√©z√®re (left) near Limeuil The Dordogne traverses the P√©rigord noir about centrally from East to West. The V√©z√®re originates to the Northeast, traverses the northwestern part of the P√©rigord noir and joins the Dordogne near Limeuil as a right tributary. Both rivers meander, well known examples for the Dordogne are Cingle de Montfort and Cingle de Tr√©molat. The base level of both rivers is at an elevation between 70 and 40 meters, whereas the undulating surrounding sedimentary succession can reach elevations of 349 meters ‚Äî but is situated on average closer to 200 meters. Both streams have therefore incised the sediments by about 150 meters. Tributaries of the Dordogne are Borr√®ze, √ân√©a and Doux (from the right) as well as Marcillande (Germaine), C√©ou, Nauze and B√©lingou (from the left). The V√©z√®re is joined by the Laurence, Thonac, Moustier and Manaurie from the right, and by the Coly and Beune from the left.  Geology  Ch√¢teau de Beynac is built on Upper Coniacian limestone Geologically, the P√©rigord noir area is situated entirely in a sequence of gently southwest-dipping sediments that form part of the Aquitaine Basin. The series comprises Jurassic, Cretaceous, Eocene and Oligocene. The river valleys are infilled by alluvial sediments of Quaternary age. The Jurassic sediments belong to the inner platform facies and consist of limestones, dolomites and marls. The limestones feature micrites, sparites, oolites and also limestones rich in siliciclastics that were deposited near the shoreface. The marls were formed near the continent and are occasionally rather rich in lignite, once mined near Allas-les-Mines. The Jurassic rocks crop out along the northern edge of the P√©rigord noir near Terrasson- Lavilledieu, where they are separated from the Upper Cretaceous by the southeast-striking Cassagne Fault. They are also found within the Saint- Cyprien Anticline ‚Äî a southeast-striking tectonic upwarp near Le Bugue and Saint-Cyprien. Beyond the eastern perimeter of the P√©rigord noir they constitute the Causse de Martel. The Upper Cretaceous forms a slight discordance with the underlying Middle and Upper Jurassic sediments east of Sarlat. Due to the upwarp of the Saint-Cyprien Anticline the Upper Cretaceous sediments are folded into a very gentle syncline. They mainly consist of limestones and are often karstified. Stratigraphically they range from Cenomanian to Campanian and cover the biggest part of the P√©rigord noir. In places the Upper Cretaceous is overlain by continental molasse sediments of Eocene and Oligocene age, as can be seen for instance in the woodlands of the For√™t de la Bess√®de near Le Buisson-de-Cadouin. The molasse are stream and lake deposits. The northern limit of the P√©rigord noir is marked by the southsoutheast to southeast striking Condat Fault, which has raised a crystalline basement block of the Massif Central ‚Äî the horst of Ch√¢tres ‚Äî right through the Jurassic sediments.  History  The P√©rigord noir is well known for its abundance in prehistoric caves and abris like Lascaux, Rouffignac or Cro Magnon ‚Äî all situated relatively close to Les Eyzies-de- Tayac-Sireuil. Famous are troglodytic cliff dwellings like Roque Saint- Christophe near the archeological site of Le Moustier. Archeological studies have been conducted in the P√©rigord noir since the 19th century and underline the importance of the V√©z√®re valley for prehistory. Just in the vicinity of Les Eyzies 147 sites are clustered, with ages reaching 40.000 years and more. This is the reason, why the new Mus√©e national de Pr√©histoire was established there. Several prehistoric sites in the P√©rigord noir have rendered their names for archeological cultures like Mousterian, Micoquian, P√©rigordian and Magdalenian. Besides the medieval towns Sarlat and Domme many classified settlements are preserved. Examples are Belv√®s, Beynac, Castelnaud-la- Chapelle, Limeuil, La Roque-Gageac, Saint-Amand-de-Coly and Saint-L√©on-sur- V√©z√®re. The rich cultural heritage of the P√©rigord noir is also manifested in many castles, ch√¢teaus, churches and abbeys, like for instance Ch√¢teau de Beynac, Ch√¢teau de Castelnaud-la-Chapelle, Ch√¢teau des Milandes, the church Saint-Martin de Besse and Cadouin Abbey. During the Hundred Years War (1337 till 1453) the P√©rigord noir witnessed many battles between the English and French kings and the region was devastated several times. A good example is the Ch√¢teau de Carlux which was under attack several times and finally got burnt down by the English in 1406. The population was diminished severely during the war and despite attempts in the 15th and 16th century to revitalize the economy again the region never fully recovered and kept suffering from the sequels of the war. The French Wars of Religion (1562 till 1598) have also left their marks on the P√©rigord noir.

The company was founded based on software created in the lab of Torkel Klingberg, a neuroscientist at the Karolinska Institute, who was using it to present working memory challenges to people while he studied their brains using fMRI, to try to learn about neuroplasticity. When the studies appeared to show that the challenges improved working memory, Klingberg founded Cogmed in 2001, with financial backing from the Karolinska Institute and venture capitalists. Cogmed's initial marketing was focused on helping people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and expanded to other impairments of working memory, such as persons with learning disabilities, and people who had a stroke or other traumatic brain injury. In 2010, Cogmed was purchased by Pearson Education and became a part of the Pearson Clinical Assessment Group. Karolinksa received 22m SEK and double digit royalties as part of the transaction. A 2012 meta-analysis of 23 research studies on seven different commercial and non-commercial working memory training techniques (including Cogmed) found that \\"working memory training programs give only near-transfer effects, and there is no convincing evidence that even such near-transfer effects are durable.\\" Another 2012 review of Cogmed found that many of the problem-solving or training tasks presented in Cogmed are not related to working memory, that many of the attention tasks are unrelated to ADHD, and that there is limited transfer to real-life manifestations of attention deficits, concluding \\"The only unequivocal statement that can be made is that Cogmed will improve performance on tasks that resemble Cogmed training.\\" The company's marketing efforts have been described in popular media.

Sheen's radio and television broadcasts on behalf of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith for over half a century. The broadcasts, including the famous \\"Death of Stalin,\\" were some of the most important influences in reshaping mainstream twentieth-century American attitudes on Catholicism. Other notable clergy have included Bishop John J. O'Hara, Monsignor John P. Chidwick, Monsignor Eugene V. Clark, and Father George W. Rutler. As an important venue for media, and with its proximity to the center of New York City, the church often played host to rallies, such as the starting point for John Cardinal O'Connor's anti-abortion march from this church. Buildings The church was built 1873‚Äì1877 to the designs of Lawrence J. O'Connor. Builders were Moran and Armstrong and Michael J. Newman. The basement was completed and used as a chapel which was dedicated by John Cardinal McCloskey on January 11, 1874. A Celtic cross crowned the gable. The sanctuary contained a chancel window depicting St. Agnes. The completed church was dedicated by Cardinal McCloskey on May 6, 1877.

Meanwhile, Nikki and her group set up cameras all over the Everglades to monitor Terry's activities. They catch and record Terry and Angie feeding the steroid-laced chickens to the alligators. Several months later, Terry meets Dr. Diego Ortiz, who warns her that an all-out war between the giant pythons and the mutated alligators in the Everglades has begun. After seeing a python and an alligator battle each other, Diego urges Terry to cancel a fund-raising event that is to be held that night to help restore a nearby estuary, but his cries fall on deaf ears. As Nikki and her group walk around the forest to plant pheromones, they discover the skeleton of a dead giant python before they are attacked by a giant alligator, and Gia is eaten. In another part of the Everglades, Diego discovers that the alligators have laid hundreds of eggs ‚Äì all of which are 20-30 times their normal size. He calls Terry and asks her to give him access to explosives to get rid of the eggs, but his request is denied. Flying a helicopter over a swamp, Diego rescues Nikki, but Ben is devoured by an alligator. He offers to fly her to the nearest hospital, but she tells him to bring her to her office immediately. After dropping her off, he returns to the site of the alligator eggs and destroys them with a pack of dynamite. He then finds a cave filled with thousands more eggs and calls Terry, telling her that if she does not evacuate the party nearby, he will call the governor and have him send the National Guard to the quarry. At the fund-raising event, Nikki shows up at the VIP tent uninvited, threatening to blackmail Terry with a disc containing footage of her feeding the alligators. This leads to a fight between the two women that destroys the party. Meanwhile, as Nikki and Terry continue their fight in a swamp, the reptiles crash the event, devouring guest of honor Micky Dolenz and several other partygoers. However, Terry's friend Barbara Fine manages to survive and escape. Realizing that they will have to work together to stop this threat, Nikki and Terry, along with Angie and Diego, drive to Miami to get help and prevent the reptiles from invading the city, but are too late and Angie is devoured by a python as they flee from the city. Nikki comes up with a plan to save Florida; she plants explosives in the quarry while Terry and Diego fly over Miami in a crop duster and spray pheromones they acquired from Nikki's office, luring the reptiles to them. However, when their plane crashes on a highway after being hit by a python, Terry takes the remaining bottles of pheromones and drives an abandoned car to lure the reptiles away from the Turkey Point Nuclear Power Plant. Back in the cave, Nikki finds herself surrounded by an alligator and hundreds of hatchlings. Terry rescues her by driving her car with a lit container of gasoline toward the alligator. Surrounded by the remaining reptiles around the quarry, the two women lock themselves inside a supply shed, where Nikki admits to Terry that she released the snakes into the Everglades, to Terry's disgust. Diego arrives in a rescue helicopter and picks up Nikki, but is too late to save Terry, who is caught by an alligator and devoured, with Nikki and Diego helpless to save her. Nikki blows up the quarry, killing all of the reptiles in sight, but the explosion rocks the helicopter, throwing her off as she falls into a swamp. The helicopter circles back for Nikki while pieces of pythons and alligators rain around her, and she is eaten by a python head that is still alive (as snake heads can survive for up to an hour). One year after the incident, Diego cuts a ribbon to inaugurate the O‚ÄôHara-Riley Estuary, named in memory of Terry and Nikki.

Fitch of Mason County, Michigan in 1914.\\"Ludington Farmer is Inventor\\", The Grand Rapids Herald, 1 November 1915 Mr. Fitch had been a millwright in the lumber industry in West Michigan and then turned his attention to the manufacture of mechanical inventions and to fruit farming.

Upon leaving the church on Bleecker Street, the building became occupied by Our Lady of Pompeii Church. Father Augustus Tolton, the first openly-Black Catholic priest in the United States, celebrated his first Mass in America at this parish in 1889. A decade later, the first openly-Black Catholic seminarian, William Augustine Williams (who entered seminary in Rome in 1853 and departed in 1862) became the parish sacristan.

More change came by the end of the next two decades. In the 1920s, many of the parishioners moved with other African Americans to Harlem, which became a center of African-American life. Since 1953 the church in Hell's Kitchen was staffed by Spanish friars of the Third Order of Saint Francis (T.O.R.), and it was rededicated in 1954.

The French defeated their opponents, forcing the Prussians to retreat northeast toward Dessau after suffering heavy losses. The clash occurred in the War of the Fourth Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars. The city of Halle is located about 30 kilometers northwest of Leipzig on the Saale River. Emperor Napoleon I of France invaded the Electorate of Saxony and inflicted two disastrous defeats on the Prussian-Saxon armies on 14 October 1806. As the beaten armies fled, Marshal Bernadotte's corps marched north and found Duke Eugene's unblooded Reserve located at Halle. At the beginning of the encounter, two French divisions rushed the bridges over the Saale on the west side of the city. They overran a weak defending force and quickly occupied the city. Later in the day, Bernadotte's troops stormed out of Halle and attacked Eugene's Reserve which was drawn up to the southeast of the city. The Prussians were driven from their positions and chased to the northeast. While this engagement was going on, Bernadotte's third division surrounded and captured a Prussian regiment isolated on the west side of the city. One of the few intact Prussian forces west of the Elbe River was now crippled. Background =Political= Napoleon's decisive victory at the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December 1805 profoundly affected the balance of power in Europe. After this event, Emperor Francis I of Austria sued for peace and Tsar Alexander I of Russia withdrew his crippled army from Austrian territory, ending the War of the Third Coalition. Prussia was caught at a diplomatic disadvantage since her emissary Christian Graf von Haugwitz was on the point of delivering an ultimatum to Napoleon when the war ended, a fact which the French emperor was well aware.Chandler, David. The Campaigns of Napoleon. New York: Macmillan, 1966. 443 Queen Louise In February 1806, Napoleon pressured a cowed Prussia into handing over several territories to France and her allies in return for the state of Hanover, which was under French occupation. The agreement pushed Prussia into a break with Great Britain whose king was the Hanoverian elector.Chandler Campaigns, 447 Napoleon began to remake the face of Europe. He created the Confederation of the Rhine on 25 July. He named his elder brother Joseph Bonaparte king of the newly conquered Kingdom of Naples, brother Louis Napoleon ruler over the Kingdom of Holland, and stepson Eug√®ne de Beauharnais viceroy of the Kingdom of Italy. Then he offered Hanover to Britain in exchange for peace, which infuriated Prussia.Chandler Campaigns, 449-450 The peace-minded Haugwitz was dismissed and, goaded by his Queen, Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, on 7 August King Frederick William III of Prussia decided to go to war against the First French Empire. Prussia mobilized 171,000 troops, but its army had missed the changes that had overtaken warfare in the previous decade. =Military= Jena-Auerstedt Campaign, 8‚Äì14 October 1806. As the Prussians advanced into territory belonging to the Electorate of Saxony, they absorbed 20,000 Saxon soldiers into their army. The combined forces coalesced into three semi-independent armies under Feldmarschall Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick, General of the Infantry Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen, and General Ernst von R√ºchel.Chandler Campaigns, 456 Brunswick took station at Erfurt in the center while Hohenlohe deployed near Rudolstadt in the east. R√ºchel held Gotha and Eisenach at the western end of the line with General Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach's division probing south toward Meiningen and the French line of communications. Eugene of W√ºrttemberg's Reserve was well to the north at Magdeburg.Chandler Campaigns, 459 The Battle of Jena-Auerstedt shattered the Prussian armies, by Richard Kn√∂tel. On 8 October, Napoleon launched 180,000 troops across the Saxon frontier. His troops were massed in a batallion carr√© (battalion square) made up of three columns of two army corps each, plus the Imperial Guard, the Cavalry Reserve, and a Bavarian contingent.Chandler Campaigns, 467-468 On 9 October, the leading division of Marshal Bernadotte's I Corps and Marshal Joachim Murat's cavalry forced Bogislav Friedrich Emanuel von Tauentzien's division into a withdrawal in the Battle of Schleiz.Petre, F. Loraine. Napoleon's Conquest of Prussia 1806. London: Lionel Leventhal Ltd., 1993 (1907). . 84-85 The next day, Marshal Jean Lannes' V Corps attacked the 8,300-man division of Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia at the Battle of Saalfeld. The young prince was killed and his division took to its heels after the drubbing it received.Chandler Campaigns, 470-471 Napoleon at Jena by Vernet Napoleon became convinced that his enemies lay near Erfurt, so he ordered his batallion carr√© to make a left wheel on 12 October. The Prussian generals opted to fall back. Brunswick was to take the main army north from Weimar to Merseburg, while Hohenlohe protected the move by standing on the defensive near Jena.Chandler Campaigns, 472-473 R√ºchel's orders were to hold Weimar until Saxe-Weimar returned with his division.Petre, 139 On 14 October, the double Battle of Jena-Auerstedt occurred as Napoleon attacked Hohenlohe while Brunswick ran head-on into the III Corps of Marshal Louis Davout. Both Prussian armies as well as R√ºchel's corps were driven in rout from the two battlefields. Brunswick's army suffered 13,000 casualties and its commander was mortally wounded, while the combined forces of Hohenlohe and R√ºchel lost as many as 25,000.Chandler, David. Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars. New York: Macmillan, 1979. . 214-216 When Davout marched from Naumburg to glory at Auerstedt, Bernadotte refused to join his fellow marshal despite positive orders to do so. Instead, he executed an earlier set of orders to march to Dornburg and missed the fighting at both Jena and Auerstedt.Chandler Campaigns, 496 Bernadotte found himself in serious trouble with his emperor. In a conversation with General of Division Jean Rapp Napoleon guessed that Bernadotte's behavior was caused by professional jealousy.Petre, 174 The emperor remarked to General of Division Anne Jean Marie Ren√© Savary, \\"This business is so hateful that if I send him before a court-martial it will be the equivalent of ordering him to be shot; it is better for me not to speak to him about it, but I shall take care he shall know what I think of his behavior. I believe he has enough honor to recognize that he has performed a disgraceful action regarding which I shall not bandy words with him.\\"Bourienne, M. de. Memoires of Napoleon Bonaparte. Vol. II. London, 1836. 374 In the end, Bernadotte's career may have been saved because of Napoleon's fondness for his wife D√©sir√©e Clary, whom he almost married. Battle =Forces= Marshal Bernadotte's failure to support a fellow marshal infuriated Napoleon. At the beginning of the campaign, Bernadotte's I Corps consisted of 19,014 infantry, 1,580 cavalry, and 34 artillery pieces.Petre, 74 General of Division Pierre Dupont de l'Etang led the 7,000-man 1st Division, General of Division Olivier Macoux Rivaud de la Raffini√®re commanded the 5,600-strong 2nd Division, Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon headed the 5,800-man 3rd Division, General of Brigade Jacques Louis Fran√ßois Delaistre de Tilly commanded the corps cavalry brigade,Smith, 231. Smith gives the division numbers in his Battle of L√ºbeck article.Petre, 175-176. Petre gives the strengths of each division on 14 October. General of Division Jean Baptiste Ebl√© commanded the corps artillery reserve.Smith, 226-227 Eugene of W√ºrttemberg The 1st Division consisted of General of Brigade Marie Fran√ßois Rouyer's 9th Light Infantry Regiment, three battalions, General of Brigade Fran√ßois Marie Guillaume Legendre d'Harvesse's 32nd and 96th Line Infantry Regiments, two battalions each, and two foot artillery batteries of 12 total guns. The 2nd Division included General of Brigade Michel Marie Pacthod's 8th Light Infantry Regiment, two battalions, General of Brigade Nicolas Joseph Maison's 45th and 54th Line Infantry Regiments, two battalions each, and one horse and one foot artillery battery of 12 total guns.Smith, 230. This data is from the Criwitz article. The 3rd Division comprised General of Brigade Bernard-Georges-Fran√ßois Fr√®re's 27th Light Infantry Regiment, two battalions, General of Brigade Fran√ßois Werl√©'s 94th Line Infantry Regiment, two battalions, 95th Line Infantry Regiment, three battalions, and one horse and one foot artillery battery of 16 total guns. Tilly's cavalry brigade consisted of the 2nd and 4th Hussar Regiments and the 5th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiment, four squadrons each. In the artillery reserve there were one horse and one foot artillery battery of 12 total guns.Smith, 226-227. In Smith's order of battle, which does not include Rivaud's division, there are six batteries with 40 guns. But his summary lists eight batteries with 36 guns. If the 12 guns with Rivaud are included, then Bernadotte's corps must have had 52 guns, many more than the 34 listed by Petre. French grenadier (left) and voltigeur (right) in 1808 Before 1806, a French infantry battalion was made up of nine companies. In September 1806, Napoleon decreed that each infantry regiment must have three battalions of eight companies each, including one of grenadiers and one of voltigeurs or skirmishers.Rothenberg, Gunther E. The Art of Warfare in the Age of Napoleon. Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 1980. . 138 Each foot artillery battery normally numbered six cannons and two howitzers, while each horse artillery battery counted four cannons and two howitzers. The French utilized 4-pounder, 6-pounder, 8-pounder, and 12-pounder cannons, plus captured Austrian pieces. The 12-pounders were generally employed by the corps artillery reserve.Rothenberg, 143 Eugene of W√ºrttemberg's Reserve included two infantry divisions, an advance guard, and a cavalry reserve. General-Major Hans Christoph von Natzmer's 1st Division comprised the Natzmer Infantry Regiment Nr. 54, Kauffberg Infantry Regiment Nr. 51, and Treskow Infantry Regiment Nr. 17, two battalions each, the Schmeling and Crety Grenadier battalions, and one and a half foot artillery batteries of 12 guns. General-Major Balthasar Wilhelm Christoph von Jung- Larisch's 2nd Division consisted of the Jung-Larisch Infantry Regiment Nr. 53, Kalkreuth Infantry Regiment Nr. 4, and Manstein Infantry Regiment Nr. 55, two battalions each, the Vieregg Grenadier battalion, and one and a half foot artillery batteries of 12 guns. General-Major Johann von Hinrichs' Advance Guard included the Borell Fusilier battalion Nr. 9, Knorr Fusilier battalion Nr. 12, and Hinrichs Fusilier battalion Nr. 17, two squadrons of Usedom Hussar Regiment Nr. 10, one squadron of Hertzberg Dragoon Regiment Nr. 9, one squadron of Heyking Dragoon Regiment Nr. 10, and two horse artillery pieces. The reserve cavalry comprised eight squadrons of Usedom Hussar Regiment Nr. 10, four squadrons of Hertzberg Dragoon Regiment Nr. 9, four squadrons of Heyking Dragoon Regiment Nr. 10, and one horse artillery battery of six guns. In total there were 18 battalions, 20 squadrons, and 32 guns.Smith, 227. The battalion pieces are not counted among the 32 guns, so the Prussians had more cannons. In 1806, Prussian heavy cavalry regiments were made up of five squadrons, while light cavalry regiments usually consisted of 10 squadrons. Foot artillery batteries included six 12-pounder cannons and two 10-pounder howitzers, while horse artillery batteries had six 6-pounder cannons and two 7-pounder howitzers. An infantry regiment comprised three line battalions. Each line battalion had five 174-man companies, while each fusilier battalion had four 165-man companies. Each line battalion was assigned a 6-pounder cannon and four gunners to work the piece. The fusilier battalions did not go to war with their regimental cannons in 1806.Rothenberg, 189-190 =Action= Action of Halle map by Francis Loraine Petre, 1907 At the close of the Jena- Auerstedt battle, Bernadotte had the divisions of Drouet and Rivaud near Apolda while Dupont's and the corps artillery remained at Dornburg.Petre, 185 On the morning of 15 October, Napoleon instructed Bernadotte to march to Bad Bibra, Querfurt, and Halle.Petre, 193 By the morning of the 16th Bernadotte's advance guard was about five kilometers north of Bad Bibra. He heard that the Prussian Reserve lay at Halle and planned to attack it.Petre, 201 Prussian Dragoons, 1806 At the beginning of the campaign, Eugene of W√ºrttemberg mustered 16,000 troops in the Reserve. On 10 October, as he was marching to Magdeburg, he received orders to proceed to Halle. On the 13th, the Reserve was at Halle, with a battalion at Merseburg to the south and another detachment at Leipzig to the southeast. The Treskow Infantry Regiment was to the northwest at Aschersleben, en route from Magdeburg.Petre, 202 On the 14th, Eugene received an order to remain at Halle and that the main army was falling back in his direction. That day he heard the cannonade from the Jena-Auerstedt battles. It was not until the evening of the 15th that he heard about the military disaster. On the 16th, Eugene had received no further orders. He instructed the detachment at Merseburg, which had been reinforced to two and a half battalions, to pull back to Halle. The Leipzig force was also recalled, while he sent back a detachment to hold Dessau on the Elbe River. He deployed his main force on high ground on Halle's south side, with his battle line facing northwest toward the city and his left bent back. The two and a half battalions from Merseburg were left to defend the bridges on the east side of Halle, together with a dragoon regiment. The Usedom Hussars were nearby, at the junction of the Saale and the White Elster Rivers, just south of Halle. The Treskow Regiment was at Eisleben, to the west-northwest of Halle.Petre, 203-204 Pierre Dupont de l'Etang Before dawn on the 17th, Bernadotte's corps set out from Querfurt to the west-southwest of Halle. Before long, he received intelligence that a Prussian column was approaching from Eisleben. He left Drouet's division to observe the Eisleben column and hurried on toward Halle with Dupont and Rivaud's divisions. On the west side of Halle, the Saale divides into three branches. In 1806, the road from Querfurt and Eisleben crossed these branches via a series of covered bridges, called the Hohe Br√ºcke. On the west bank, to the north of the highway, stretched the Dolau wood. From Halle, which is entirely on the east bank, radiated roads to Magdeburg in the north, to Dessau and Wittenberg in the northeast, to Leipzig in the southeast, and to Merseburg in the south. The city gate to the northeast was named the Steinthor and the gate to the southeast was called the Galgenthor.Petre, 204-205 On 17 October, Eugene of W√ºrttemberg counted 11,350 infantry, 1,675 cavalry, and 58 guns at Halle, not including the Treskow Regiment. Not counting Drouet's division, Bernadotte's force that morning numbered 12,190 infantry, 1,000 cavalry, and 12 guns. Beginning at 8:00 AM, Bernadotte's advance guard pressed back the dragoon regiment from Passendorf on the west bank. In response, Eugene sent four infantry companies and two guns to support the dragoons. Five more companies with four cannons defended the first island in the Saale. About this time, Eugene belatedly started his wagon train back toward Dessau. Fearing that the French were at hand, the teamsters panicked and fled up the road, abandoning many wagons.Petre, 205 Prussian Horse Artillery, 1805 Bernadotte determined to attack at 10:00 AM. Holding back his cavalry and the 96th Line, he sent Dupont's 32nd Line charging for the bridges, with one battalion of the 9th Light and three guns in support. Racing along the embanked road in columns and flanked by skirmishers, the French punched through the defenders to seize the first bridge and the island. The Prussians foot soldiers on either side of the road were cut off from the bridge and became prisoners. Those dragoons who did not pull back in time were forced to swim across the river. In less than an hour, Dupont's troops captured all three bridges and General von Hinrichs. They burst into the town, overwhelmed a Prussian battalion in the marketplace, and chased a second battalion out the Steinthor. Rapidly, Halle was occupied along with both the Galgenthor and Steinthor. Here the French paused to wait for the rest of Bernadotte's corps to appear.Petre, 206 Deployed southeast of Halle, Eugene found himself in an awkward position with his line of retreat to the north stretching past the east side of Halle. He quickly shifted two battalions northward to face the Steinthor and prevent the French from cutting him off from Dessau. Reinforced by the remainder of Dupont's division, the French improvised defenses at the Steinthor and Galgenthor and in the gardens along the edge of Halle. When Rivaud's division began to arrive, led by the 8th Line, it was fed into the line near the Galgenthor. This allowed Dupont to mass his division, together with a hussar regiment, to the north near the Steinthor. The French skirmishers moved forward and subjected the Prussians to severe harassing fire.Petre, 207 Jean Drouet At length, the French surged forth from Halle and attacked the Prussian line. In between the town gates, the defenders swept the ground with intense artillery fire. But at the Steinthor and Galgenthor, the attackers rapidly gained the upper hand and pushed back the Prussians. The Prussian cavalry, which deployed east of the Funckengarten, near the Steinthor, was flanked and fell back toward M√∂tzlich to the northeast. Eugene's formation split in two, his right wing retreating toward Dessau and his left wing toward Bitterfeld. The right wing fell back in good order, pausing at M√∂tzlich and at Oppin where a cavalry charge discouraged further pursuit. The left wing had worse luck, being chased by Rivaud's division and most of Bernadotte's cavalry. The Prussian horsemen managed to repulse the French cavalry near Rabatz,Petre, 208 but were driven off by Drouet's newly arrived 94th Line.Petre, 209 The French chased the left wing as far as Bitterfeld where the Prussians managed to burn the bridge over the Mulde River.Petre, 208 General-Major Karl Peter von Treskow with his regiment, finding the highway blocked by Drouet's division at Nietleben, tried to reach Halle by moving to the north of the Dolau wood. As he approached the Halle bridges, Treskow's progress was checked by Maison and a few infantrymen of the 8th Line until Drouet arrived on the scene. The Prussians deployed with their left flank on the Saale and their right on a vineyard. Believing he had enough troops to deal with Treskow, Drouet sent the 94th Line and the 5th Chasseurs √† Cheval to help Dupont and Rivaud. He then attacked the Prussians with the 27th Light, 95th Line, and two cannons. Prevented from escaping through the Dolau wood by a blocking force left there by Drouet, Treskow retreated north along the west bank in two battalion squares. Near Kr√∂llwitz, the Prussian force fell into confusion as it crossed a marshy area and lost all of its cannons. Soon after, Drouet pounced on the hapless Treskow Regiment and forced its surrender after inflicting 200 killed and wounded on it.Petre, 210 Result The Prussians reported 13 officers killed, 26 wounded, and 74 captured. Altogether, about 5,000 Prussian soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured. Four colors of the Treskow Regiment and 11 guns were captured, along with \\"many\\" battalion pieces. Bernadotte admitted about 800 killed and wounded. Historian Digby Smith writes that Eugene of W√ºrttemberg \\"dallied far too long in Halle\\". Francis Loraine Petre faults Eugene's defense as \\"half- hearted and disjointed\\" and writes that his defensive position south of Halle was \\"badly chosen\\" with its line of retreat exposed. Petre suggests that too few troops defended the bridges, inviting defeat, and that the Prussians should have burned the bridges and held the east bank. Better yet, Eugene should have retreated to Magdeburg where his intact corps might have provided a rallying point for the shattered main armies.Petre, 211 Instead, the Reserve was half-ruined by the battle. On 18 October, Bernadotte rested his troops, who were worn out by a 28 kilometer march followed by a major battle. Eugene's survivors crossed the Elbe at Rosslau and limped into Magdeburg on the 19th. Notes References =Printed materials= * Bourienne, M. de. Memoires of Napoleon Bonaparte. Vol. II.

Encouraged by his father to pursue a career in engineering, Fisher attended Queens College, City University of New York, graduating in 1968 with a degree in physics. With the aid of a scholarship from the United States Atomic Energy Commission, he earned a degree in nuclear engineering from the University of Florida. Arriving at the conclusion that he was not set out for a career as an engineer, he enrolled at Brooklyn Law School, and recalled that \\"I knew I was home\\" from the moment that he attended his first class.

History and profile The first issue was published on May 27, 1933, under the name Showmen's Round Table. The magazine was first published in the depths of the Great Depression. It chronicled the industry's struggles to cope with censorship under the Motion Picture Code, known as the Hays Code, and by churches, it told the story of America's battles and victory during World War II, and the return of prosperity during the late 1940s and 1950s. It told the story of U.S. popular culture from the film Hold Your Man with Clark Gable and Jean Harlow, featured in the first issue, through Jailhouse Rock starring Elvis Presley, featured in the final issue. Lewis changed the name to Showmen's Trade Review starting with the December 29, 1934 issue, and the magazine was published continuously through October 19, 1957 when it was sold to the Motion Picture Exhibitor. The publisher's set of bound volumes is held in the collection of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Los Angeles, California. Showmen's Trade Review reflects the history of the United States through the motion picture industry and the films it produced in the period after silent films were replaced by black and white talkies, through the introduction of color, wide screens, drive-ins, CinemaScope and 3-D. Editorially, Showmen's Trade Review covered films in production and their box office performance after release. It covered studio, labor, and industry politics; industry relations with church and government; government policy; court cases affecting the film industry; hirings and firings; profiles of business executives; showmanship, sales and promotion; theatre furnishings and equipment purchase and maintenance; theatre safety, lobby display; admission prices; and concessions, and the important relationships of the motion picture industry with radio and television. Articles about showmanship advised theatre owners and managers how best to present movies to attract large and loyal audiences. Showmen's Trade Review was supported by advertisements from the movie studios for all their major motion pictures and many of the smaller films, as well as ads for theatre equipment such as film, sound and projection systems, seats, and ticket machines. Hotels, insurance companies, soft drink and liquor brands, and other publications also advertised. Showmen's Trade Review cover, January 29, 1938, featuring actress-singer Judy Garland, then starring in \\"Everybody Sing\\" The magazine grew out of Chick Lewis' involvement in the early days of motion pictures. Lewis was born February 6, 1896 in Brooklyn, New York. He began working in the movie industry in 1909 as a \\"studio boy\\" at the Independent Moving Pictures (IMP) company on 56th Street in New York City, according to his editorial in the September 28, 1935 issue of Showmen's Trade Review. Independent Moving Pictures was a movie studio and production company founded in 1909 by Carl Laemmle. On June 8, 1912, IMP and other independent companies were absorbed into the newly incorporated Universal Film Manufacturing Company with Laemmle as president. It became one of the original major Hollywood movie studios, now Universal Pictures, a subsidiary of NBC Universal. In 1928 he came up with the idea for a \\"Round Table,\\" a publication for showmen that he said would break down \\"the barrier of silence between publication and subscriber.\\" This was the genesis, but it took five years to grow into the magazine that became Showmen's Trade Review. The first issues were published under the name Showmen's Round Table. After years of producing and promoting films and live stage shows, in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Lewis served as general manager for a circuit of movie theatres in Connecticut and New York. He called himself one of the \\"talkie pioneers\\".His editorial, March 21, 1953, Showmen's Trade Review. In 1928, Lewis was on the staff of the trade journal \\"Motion Picture News\\".His STR editorial, November 27, 1948. From May 1933, the offices of Showmen's Round Table were located at 152 West 42nd St. By July 1933, the magazine also had an editorial office in Hollywood, California. In June 1935, an editorial office in London, England was added. By July 1946, the magazine added an office in Sydney, Australia. With the July 28, 1934 issue, the New York editorial and advertising offices were moved to 1560 Broadway, New York City. With the December 29, 1934 issue, the name was changed to Showmen's Trade Review. In early 1935, while the New York editorial and advertising offices remained at 1560 Broadway, a publication office at 305 Washington Street, Brooklyn was added. With the June 29, 1935 issue the publication office was moved to 34 N. Crystal St. East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. With the September 28, 1935 issue, Showmen's Trade Review moved its editorial and advertising offices to their permanent location at Suite No. 1313 in the Paramount Building, 1501 Broadway on Times Square, New York City. As editor and publisher, Lewis was determined to make his an independent publication. His first editorial in the May 27, 1933 edition stated, \\"We are under no obligation to anyone, except, you, the showman, the exhibitor and the manager. You represent THE most important phase of this business and you are entitled to a publication devoted to your interests, your problems and your affairs. ... We do not have to curry favor with any man or organization and before we do we'll call it a day and quit.\\" In November 1933, Lewis authored and published a guide to more efficient theatre operations. Entitled, \\"Systematizing Theatre Operation,\\" it detailed how to buy films, build patronage and reduce overhead. Priced at $1, it was offered free of charge to subscribers of the magazine, who, at that time, paid $4 a year. The early issues of Showmen's Trade Review featured an \\"Advance Dope\\" column with information about upcoming films such as The Masquerader with Ronald Colman, Dinner at Eight with Lionel Barrymore and Jean Harlow, Tugboat Annie with Marie Dressler and Wallace Beery, and Alice in Wonderland starring Charlotte Henry with Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, and W.C. Fields. The column \\"Box Office Slant,\\" which ran from the first issue through the last, was \\"a practical working analysis of current product as gauged by a showman's yardstick.\\" It gave the cast, the plot and an analysis of five or six films per issue. The struggle over censorship is clear in the \\"Box Office Slant\\" of August 25, 1934 which said of the film Iris March, \\"Sterling cast gives magnificent performance, but censorship kills famous plot.\\" In the same issue, \\"Box Office Slant\\" said of Belle of the Nineties, starring blond bombshell Mae West, \\"The picture has been doctored plenty to meet with blue-nose requirements‚Ä¶ But it's swell entertainment‚Ä¶ It will pack 'em in‚Ä¶ The censor boards have already sold the fans this one so it's a cinch to mop up.\\" Throughout the mid-1930s the motion picture industry was under attack from churches and the government. A Showmen's Trade Review article in the January 26, 1935 issue reported, \\"‚Ä¶ the National Lutheran Council, which claims spiritual control over 2,000,000 souls, called upon the faithful to 'withhold patronage from pictures offensive to morality.'\\" An article in the February 2, 1935 issue proclaimed, \\"Check up over the nation reveals that there are 50 bills aimed at the motion picture industry in Washington and in 15 state capitols.\\" Lewis displayed a sense of humor, featuring cartoons by Dick Kirschbaum from the first issue until the cartoonist died in November 1948. Kirschbaum was a theatre manager from New Jersey with a talent for cartooning. He went into newspaper work as the author of the first aviation column in a U.S. newspaper in \\"The Newark News.\\" In the 1940s he did a series for Showmen's Trade Review called \\"Showmen's Silhouettes\\" featuring motion picture exhibitors. Short subjects, ignored by other publications, had a column of their own in Showmen's Trade Review. Regional news was also a feature of the journal. Showmen's Trade Review publisher and editor-in-chief Chick Lewis and STR west coast representative Joe Blair at Warner Studio, Burbank, California, 1936 Using the magazine as a platform, Lewis supported many charitable campaigns - to combat cancer, relief and resettlement of Jews after World War II (in the April 26, 1947 editorial), Brotherhood Week campaign of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the United Cerebral Palsy Assn. He supported U.S. Treasury bond drives both during and after World War II. Lewis was especially supportive of the Variety Clubs, which he called \\"The Heart of Showbusiness.\\" From 1936, he used Showmen's Trade Review to advocate contributions to the Will Rogers Memorial Fund, which supported the Will Rogers Hospital at Saranac Lake, New York named after the popular comedian. The hospital helped show business people to regain their health, particularly from tuberculosis. From 1939, Lewis was a member of Variety Clubs and served as international press officer. In January 1937, Showmen's Trade Review began publishing an annual called \\"Leaders of the Motion Picture Industry,\\" that listed two groups of pictures: \\"top-flight box office pictures\\" and a \\"secondary group of money-makers.\\" The first special issue offered complete information on these pictures from November 1, 1936 through October 21, 1937 prepared \\"by theatremen for theatremen,\\" wrote Lewis, introducing the annual publication. \\"Leaders\\" recorded the results of an annual national poll of exhibitors, conducted and published by Showmen's Trade Review. In 1937, Lewis published a book, \\"The Encyclopedia of Exploitation\\" by Bill Hendricks and Howard Waugh, a reference guide to 10,001 ways that theatre managers could bring more business in the door. It is found in libraries under Dewey Decimal Class 659.1 and is in the Library of Congress with the number: HF6161.T5 H4. On February 4, 1950 Chick Lewis published another book by Hendricks, this time with Montgomery Orr, Showmanship in Advertising: The fundamentals of salesmanship in print. Lewis explained his mission was to serve the motion picture industry, as on January 1, 1938, he wrote that it was, \\"‚Ä¶ to give this industry a bigger, better, more useful and dependable trade paper without fear or favor and to continue our established policy as being the only trade paper dealing exclusively and realistically with the business of showmen and showmanship.\\" Intensely patriotic, Lewis was a liberal thinker, editorializing against church censorship of films, and in the December 17, 1938 issue lashing out at a Photoplay article critical of \\"movie stars who are not married but commit the horrible crime of living in homes close to or next to each other.\\" In December 1938, Photoplay published, \\"Hollywood's Unmarried Husbands and Wives.\\" In it, Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, along with Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck, among others, were called out for \\"behaving like they are married\\", even though they were not. Lewis wrote, \\"Fan magazines appear to be run by people who have a tough time trying to find nice things to write about so go out of their way seeking nasty, and in many instances, libelous things to print.\\" Showmen's Trade Review editor and publisher Charles E. \\"Chick\\" Lewis with actor Gary Cooper, Hollywood, California, August 30, 1944 A newsman as well as a showman, Lewis traveled often to Hollywood to meet with actors, producers and directors, theatre owners, as well as studio and industry executives. He attended industry conventions across the country. The movie ads are some of the most interesting pages in Showmen's Trade Review. The ads range from simple black and white to elaborate full color, featuring photographs of the stars in action, as well as original promotional drawings and cartons. Ads used textured, heavy-weight paper, cut-outs, even cellophane windows. In August 1939, STR carried a 10-page ad taken by exhibitors in honor of Universal Pictures in full color on heavy textured paper featuring such movies as \\"Destry Rides Again\\" with Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart. In March 1940, STR carried a two-page ad for the Alfred Hitchcock film \\"Rebecca\\" with Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine with a gold background on both pages. In April 1940, RKO ran a 10-page ad insert for seven movies, including \\"Abe Lincoln in Illinois\\" starring Raymond Massey. These multi-page ads from the major studios supported the magazine for decades. By the 7th anniversary issue published on June 8, 1940, Showmen's Trade Review was an indispensable fixture on the motion picture scene. The anniversary issue was supported by full-page ads taken by: Alfred Hitchcock, Gary Cooper, Gabby Hayes, Tex Ritter, John Wayne, and Bing Crosby as well as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Warner Bros., Technicolor, and Hal Roach Productions. The MGM lion holds a drawing honoring Showmen's Trade Review editor and publisher Charles E. \\"Chick\\" Lewis for his work with Variety Clubs, Hollywood, California, May 1946 For the record: on March 15, 1941, the masthead stated that the magazine was, \\"Published every Friday by Showmen's Trade Review, Inc., 1501 Broadway, New York City. Telephone Bryant 9-5606. Charles E. \\"Chick\\" Lewis, editor and publisher; Tom Kennedy, associate editor; Robert Wile, managing editor. Offices were maintained in Hollywood, California; London, England; and Sydney, Australia. Subscription rates were $2 per year in the USA and Canada, $5 per year elsewhere.\\" Lewis saw great potential for motion pictures in the development of television, writing in his editorial of December 16, 1944, \\"The heavy turnout for the Television Broadcasters Association conference in New York this week proves how great is the interest in this new marvel of the science of electronics. The picture industry is certain to play a very big part in television in the future, and film men are not sleeping on the job but are keeping an eye on developments, as evidenced by the large number of picture people seen at the conference.\\" In his May 7, 1949 editorial Lewis wrote, \\"Television is competition, just as is anything that bids for the time people have to devote to entertainment. But with video's competition comes a new medium possessing a great potential for advertising the attractions of a picture through trailers shown right in the home.\\" All during World War II, Showmen's Trade Review stimulated showmen to raise funds for the war effort, through Victory Bonds, Red Cross War Fund Weeks, War Loan Campaigns, and for polio victims through the March of Dimes campaigns. Showmen's Trade Review editor and publisher Chick Lewis at a testimonial dinner given in his honor at the Hotel Astor, NYC, January 11, 1952 In April 1949, Variety Clubs International assumed operation of the Will Rogers Memorial Hospital. In 1954, the year after his death, a new wing was opened at the Will Rogers' Memorial Hospital, dedicated to Chick Lewis, who served as executive vice-president of the institution. The dedication was made during the annual visit of the Variety Clubs Board of Directors to the sanitarium. Ever the showman, in his editorial of June 4, 1949, Lewis wrote, \\"SELL THE PICTURE: If the show is good enough to book, it's worth all the showmanship energy a theatreman can produce with every bit of know-how, inspiration and perspiration of which he's capable.\\" Lewis presented industry news with optimism, conviction, and respect for his readers. In his editorial of August 16, 1952, he wrote of, \\"STR's editorial policy of presenting facts without fury - the full facts with the pertinent details needed to interpret them so that the reader can form his own conclusions.\\" Lewis died of a sudden heart attack at his home in Scarsdale, New York on October 22, 1953. His widow, Margie Rita Lewis, took over as publisher and kept the magazine going until October 1957, when she sold it to the Motion Picture Exhibitor.

It was established in 1859 as the first parish in the United States formed specifically to serve the Italian immigrant community. History The parish was founded by a priest named Sanguinetti who had come from Italy with the approval of John Hughes, the Archbishop of New York, to help provide the services of the Catholic faith to his countrymen who had emigrated to the United States. With no clergy available to serve these immigrants in their native language, many had stopped practicing the faith or had begun to join other denominations. The congregation initially worshiped at the former site of the Church of St. Vincent de Paul built in 1841 on Canal Street, which Sanguinetti leased from that parish. He lasted in that ministry for only about a year, however, as he returned to his homeland, feeling overwhelmed and disheartened from the various obstacles which arose for the parish. The Italian community did not wish to lose the work Sanguinetti had begun. Hughes' successor, John McCloskey, appealed for help to Pamfilo of Magliano, the Minister Provincial of the Franciscan friars then based at St. Bonaventure College in Allegheny, New York. Father Pamfilo agreed to take responsibility for this ministry. He assigned Friar Leo Pacilio, a native of Naples, to this task. The parish was thus re-established in 1866 at what had been built in 1839 at 149 Sullivan Street as the Sullivan Street Methodist Episcopal Church, which had relocated to become the Washington Square United Methodist Church., p.192 The parish was served by the Franciscan friars, who continue to administer it.Remigius Lafort, S.T.D., Censor, The Catholic Church in the United States of America: Undertaken to Celebrate the Golden Jubilee of His Holiness, Pope Pius X.

(New York City: The Catholic Editing Company, 1914), p.314.Historical plaque on church The church was solemnly dedicated on April 10, 1866, by McCloskey, by then the first cardinal of New York. A view of the facade of the church Between 1886 and 1888, the parish funded the building of a new church on Sullivan Street, designed by Arthur Crooks in the Romanesque Revival style. The friars had originally taken up residence with the first church structure, but by this period a separate friary was built for them on Thompson Street directly behind the church. This came to also serve as provincial headquarters for their Minister Provincial. The Houston Street facade of the building was originally blocked by tenement buildings, which were demolished when Houston Street was widened in the early 1930s, exposing the plain facade. The church now uses this space as a garden. From 1902 to 2005 the parish operated a school (K-8) on Mac Dougal Street. =Father Fagan Park= On the night of November 4, 1938, the friary caught fire. A young friar, Richard Fagan, initially escaped the flames but then went back into the building twice to rescue two other friars, Fathers Louis Vitale and Bonaventure Pons. Returning a third time, he was trapped and badly burned. He escaped by breaking through a window and landed on the roof of a neighboring building. He was found and taken to Columbus Hospital, where he died of his injuries at the age of 27. A small park at the intersection of Sixth Avenue and Prince and Spring Streets was named in his honor by the City of New York in 1941. Pastors *Rev. Father Leo Pacilio (1866-?) *Rev.

About \\"This is a small area within modern Carmarthenshire consisting of regular rectangular fields and dispersed farms. It lies within the medieval Cantref Emlyn, in Emlyn Uwch-Cych commote. Cantref Emlyn had been partly brought under Anglo- Norman control in c.1100 when Emlyn Is-Cych commote to the west was reconstituted as the Lordship of Cilgerran. Numerous castles were established in Uwch-Cych comote - none of which has any recorded history - but the commote was back under Welsh control by the 1130s, where it remained throughout the 12th and early 13th centuries. A motte-and-bailey castle, ‚ÄòTomen Llawddog‚Äô, was established within this character area, immediately next to Penboyr parish church, St Llawddog‚Äôs; and therefore the may be contemporary. It is not known whether they belong to the brief period of Anglo-Norman control, or are Welsh foundations of the later 12th century. However, the church dedication to St Llawddog may be later medieval, when his cult was still active in the area. The church was first recorded in 1222 when it was ‚Äòrestored‚Äô to the Bishops of St Davids, to be counter-claimed by the crown. Its early parish status, along with its close relationship to the castle, suggests that the two represent a deliberate Anglo-Norman plantation. They may therefore represent the site of a failed vill. The castle, which has no recorded history, probably become disused at an early date.

His highest rank was komusubi. The last two characters of his ring name were taken from his mentor and coach at ≈ånomatsu, the former Masurao. He was only the second wrestler from his stable to reach the top division. He was runner-up in one tournament and earned one special prize, for Fighting Spirit. He is now a sumo coach. Early life and sumo background Two years after his birth in Funabashi, his father was killed in a car accident and he was subsequently raised alone by his mother. ≈ånomatsu stable being very near the home of one of his relatives, he began visiting it from a young age. This eventually led to him entering the stable in 1999. Career Fighting under his own surname of Yakigaya, he rose steadily through the ranks until reaching sandanme where he started to struggle. He managed to reach makushita in September 2002 but was demoted back to sandanme after one tournament. In 2003, he missed two tournaments, but upon returning earned two impressive records topped off with a perfect 7‚Äì0 record to win the sandanme championship in the last tournament of that year.He fought for four years in the makushita ranks with occasional temporary demotions to sandanme before finally achieving a record that enabled his promotion to the second division, j≈´ry≈ç, in January 2008. To mark his arrival in the elite sekitori ranks he changed his shikona to Wakak≈çy≈´. After a year and half in j≈´ry≈ç with two demotions to makushita he managed a 9‚Äì6 record at the j≈´ry≈ç 2 rank and was promoted to the bottom of the makuuchi division in July 2009. He only managed a 4‚Äì11 record and fell back to j≈´ry≈ç. After a one off 6‚Äì9 record this tournament, he took in a string of winning records over the next several tournaments to again reach the top division makuuchi in May 2010. This time he proved himself with a 10‚Äì5 record that would have allowed him to fight in the next tournament at a career high maegashira 8. However, at this time, he admitted to having been involved in baseball gambling along with a number of other higher ranked wrestlers and was forced to sit out the tournament and was demoted back to j≈´ry≈ç having never fought at his (then) highest achieved rank. He bounced back from this setback with two winning tournaments, the second being an impressive 10‚Äì5 at j≈´ry≈ç's highest rank. This awarded him another chance to prove himself in makuuchi in the January 2011 tournament. Wakak≈çy≈´ and Toyohibiki were the last two wrestlers to again reach the top division after being demoted from it in the gambling scandal. After an 8‚Äì7 score at maegashira 10 in the May Technical Examination Tournament, he reached the upper maegashira ranks for the first time at #3. He managed to defeat two ≈çzeki (Kotooshu and Kai≈ç) but finished with a losing score of 5‚Äì10. His best performance in the top division came in November 2011 when he finished runner- up to yokozuna Hakuh≈ç with a score of 12‚Äì3 and was awarded his first sansh≈ç or special prize, for Fighting Spirit. It also saw him promoted to the sanyaku ranks for the first time at komusubi for the following tournament in January 2012. However, a decline in his performances saw him demoted back to the j≈´ry≈ç division at the end of 2012 having scored only 4‚Äì11 at maegashira 13 in November. After a few years as a fixture in the second division he retired mid-tournament in September 2014 when his losing record had assured his demotion to the unsalaried ranks. Retirement from sumo Wakak≈çy≈´ has stayed in the sumo world as a coach at ≈ånomatu stable. He has secured one of the Sumo Association's 105 toshiyori-kabu or elder names, and is now known as Shiranui Oyakata. His danpatsu-shiki or official retirement ceremony was held at the Ryogoku Kokugikan on January 31, 2015. Fighting style Wakak≈çy≈´ was an oshi-sumo specialist, preferring pushing and thrusting techniques to fighting on the mawashi. His most common winning kimarite were oshi-dashi (push out), tsuki dashi (thrust out) and hiki-otoshi (pull down).

It was done to facilitate the Catholic Church's service to the rapidly expanding Italian population in that area of the city. The new parish was initially served by a small chapel dedicated to St. Ann located on East 112th Street. The first pastor, Father Cardi, a Pallotine, immediately determined to build a suitable church for the parish. For this, the architect Nicholas Serracino was contracted to design the new facility. This was completed and dedicated in 1913. Current status In 2015, the Parish of St. Ann was merged with the neighboring Parish of St. Lucy to form the new Parish of St. Ann and St. Lucy, for which this church serves as the parish church. The parish is currently staffed by the P.I.M.E. Missionaries (Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions). School The five-story brick parochial school with a slag and tile roof is located at 310-318 East 110th Street. It was built in 1924 to the designs by architect Edward F. Fanning of 134 East 44th Street, and opened in 1926 under the administration of the Filippini Sisters.

Although the term is not consistently defined, generally speaking the term encompasses all executive officials and their staffs, civil servants, police, judicial officials, and members of the armed forces. While the term is used in other Commonwealth countries such as Canada, it has the most predominant use and is the most well-defined with the United Kingdom. Crown servant vs civil servant The terms civil servant and Crown servant can coincide but are sometimes exclusive. It is suggested that the phrase \\"civil servant\\" may include every person who serves the Crown, with the exception of members of the armed forces of the United Kingdom, the Ministers of the Crown and the judiciaries of the United Kingdom. However, members of the armed forces are nonetheless Crown servants. Employment rights Crown servants serve \\"at the pleasure of the Crown\\", and do not therefore benefit from the protections normally available to employees by law. However, the majority of these protections are applied to them by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. For the purposes of the Act, \\"crown employment\\" means employment \\"under or for the purposes of a government department or any officer or body exercising on behalf of the Crown functions conferred by an enactment\\", though members of the armed forces are excluded from this provision, and the government has the ability to exclude other Crown servants \\"for the purpose of safeguarding national security\\".

It was established in 1944, during World War II, by Francis Cardinal Spellman, Archbishop of New York and Apostolic Vicar for the U.S. Armed Forces from December 11, 1939 to December 2, 1967, at a time when \\"victory in the war was in sight but not yet assured.\\", p.168 A quote from Cardinal Spellman greets worshipers at the front door: \\"This Holy Shrine is dedicated to Our Lady of Victory in Thanksgiving for Victory won by our valiant dead, our soldier‚Äôs blood, our country‚Äôs tears, shed to defend men‚Äôs rights and win back men‚Äôs hearts to God.\\" A Soldier's Shrine is in the lower chapel, and the Teresa Benedicta Auschwitz Memorial in the lobby commemorates a victim of the Holocaust. A 9-11 Remembrance Book is displayed. Today, the church primarily serves as a place for daytime worship, rather than as a neighborhood church. History Between 1944 and 1945, the church occupied a temporary premise at 23 William Street. The present brick Georgian Revival church was built in 1944-1946 to the designs by the prominent New York City architectural firm of Eggers & Higgins at a planned cost of $430,000. The land was donated by Major Edward Bowes. The style of the church has also been described as \\"basilican.\\" Construction was completed in 1946 and the church dedicated by Cardinal Spellman on June 23, 1947. Organ The church currently has an organ from c.2010 manufactured by the Allen Organ Company of Macungie, Pennsylvania. An earlier organ was produced for the church by George Kilgen & Son of St. Louis, Missouri in 1955. Dedication The church's \\"Victory\\" dedication is commemorates the then ongoing actions during the Second World War. There are at least three Our Lady of Victory Roman Catholic churches in New York City.

He sought to renew the Aryan race through a variety of schemes, including selective breeding and polygamy, all within a firmly rural setting.Richard S. Levy, Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, Volume 1, ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 296 Early political activity A student of biology at the University of Jena, Henstchel studied for his doctorate under celebrated Darwinist Ernst Haeckel.Levy, Antisemitism, p. 297 He used his knowledge to patent an indigo dye from which he earned a fortune that enabled him to concentrate his efforts on political ventures. Amongst his earliest activities was his place on the board of directors of the German Social Party, an anti-Semitic group led by Max Liebermann von Sonnenberg in the 1890s. His 1901 book Varuna, in which he explored the supposed origins of the Aryan race, helped to make him a popular figure on the far right. In this book he argued that history was driven by the process of racial purification and the energy and spirit that drove this desire.Wendy Lower, Nazi Empire- Building and the Holocaust in Ukraine, UNC Press Books, 2005, p. 21 Hentschel was close to Theodor Fritsch and with him founded the anti-Semitic journal Hammer in 1903. Fritsch announced that Varuna, which complained that Germans were becoming \\"Semitized\\" through such initiatives as democratisation and rural depopulation, was the ideological basis of the new journal. Mittgart In 1904 he published the book Mittgart in which he outlined a scheme to send 1000 ethnically pure women and 100 men picked for their military and athletic prowess to large country estates to procreate. Their children would then leave the estates at the age of 16 with the aim of travelling Germany and renewing racial stock. He further argued that in time the countryside would be the only place were pure Germans would be found, with the cities housing the biologically unfit who would die away quickly.Daniel Gasman, The Scientific Origins of National Socialism, Transaction Publishers, 2004, p. 152 Hentschel's scheme attracted criticism not only from religious leaders but also from fellow racial nationalists who were outraged by what they saw as an attack on the institution of the family. Hentschel for his part was an atheist and belonged to the tendency within German nationalism that was strongly opposed to Christianity.Michael Cherlin, Halina Filipowicz, Richard L. Rudolph, The great tradition and its legacy: the evolution of dramatic and musical theater in Austria and Central Europe, Berghahn Books, 2004, p. 68 Despite the criticism he founded his own Mittgart-Bund to publicise his idea and even attempted to start his colony in Lower Saxony although this scheme met with little success and had been abandoned before 1914.Everett Mendelsohn, Helga Nowotny, Nineteen Eighty-Four: Science Between Utopia and Dystopia, Springer, 1984, p. 179 Interbellum After World War I he moderated his ideas somewhat, calling instead for a migration of ethnic Germans into the east of the country in order to displace the Poles living there. Hentschel called for these Germans to be Artamanen, a portmanteau word he created from art and manen, Middle High German words meaning 'agriculture man' and indicating his desire for a retreat from urban life to an idyllic rural past.Peter Padfield, Himmler: Reichs F√ºhrer-SS, Cassell & Co, 2001, p. 37 His vision inspired the creation of the Artaman League youth movement in which the likes of Heinrich Himmler and Richard Walther Darr√© were active. Hentschel joined the Nazi Party (as member number 144,649) on 1 August 1929 although, whilst his ideas about eugenics were influential on Nazism as an ideology, he had no real influence in the party personally.Gregor Pelger: 'Willibald Hentschel', in Ingo Haar & Michael Fahlbusch (eds.), Handbuch der v√∂lkischen Wissenschaften.

He invented a number of different aircraft, focusing on tailless designs. Espenlaub co-founded the practice of aerotowing. Aeronautic career Gottlob Espenlaub Espenlaub was born in Balzholz, since 1938 part of Beuren. As a young man Espenlaub served as a joiner to aircraft builders. He helped Alexander Lippisch to build a style of glider in 1921 according to Lippisch's designs. The glider was subsequently dubbed the Lippisch-Espenlaub E-2 glider, due to Espenlaub's participation in its creation. Espenlaub began building his own rocket propelled gliders in 1928, conducting his first rocket test on October 22, 1929. His rocket glider for this test was dubbed the RAK-3 and it featured missiles attached to the wings. During the flight, these missiles caught the tail on fire, forcing an early landing. Due to this, many of Espenlaub's later designs would feature tailless gliders. (English) After conducting further tests, he improved his design and then did another test with his glider in D√ºsseldorf, Germany in 1930, achieving a speed of 90 kilometers per hour. He had already been known as a \\"renowned German sailplane pilot\\" before, because of his various designs and his piloting abilities. Therefore, he was asked to test fly numerous new kinds of aircraft, such as the A2 airplane in 1929 built by Alexander Soldenhoff. Espenlaub also served as a theorist and implementor in terms of aircraft design and the future abilities of aircraft. He and Gerhard Fieseler conducted a number of demonstrations in 1927 at Kassel on the idea of aerotowing and its feasibility in the air. It was the first time this idea was shown, and it became widely used after Espenlaub's and Fieseler's demonstrations. Automotive designs Both before and after the war, Espenlaub produced innovative streamliner automotive designs, but none were commercially successful.\\"ESPENLAUB EXPERIMENTAL AERIAL and MOTOR CRAFT\\", Rob Arndt References 1900 births 1972 deaths German people of World War II German aerospace engineers People from Beuren, Esslingen Engineers from Baden-W√ºrttemberg ","title":"Gottlob Espenlaub"},{"id":"30232221","text":"The Rotach is a tributary of Lake Constance, which drains to the Rhine, in the German state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg.

Parish history The parish was established in 1844 by the Reverend Father Zachary Kunz, O.S.F. (now O.F.M.), an immigrant from the Kingdom of Hungary, who had been the founder and first pastor of the nearby German speaking St. John the Baptist Church in 1840. The problems with St. John's Board of Trustees were so great that the parish had been placed under an interdict (which would last until 1845) by the Bishop of New York, the Right Rev. John McCloskey.Church and Friary of St. Francis of Assisi \\"History\\" Following this disharmony with the lay Board of Trustees there and the subsequent interdict, Kunz requested that McCloskey authorize a new parish. This request was granted and the friar soon acquired a plot of land near his first parish. He resigned from St. John's and, with a significant portion of its congregation, founded the Parish of St. Francis of Assisi. The cornerstone of the new church was laid on May 9 of that same year, in a ceremony presided over by Bishop McCloskey. During the 1860s, under the leadership of the Italian missionary and first Minister Provincial of the Order in the United States, Father Pamfilo of Magliano, O.S.F., a school was opened for the children of the parish. It was run by the Franciscan Sisters of Allegany, whom he had founded. The parish continued to expand and grow, until, by 1890, it was felt that a larger church was needed. Construction of the new church, designed by Henry Erhardt in the Gothic Revival style, was completed in 1892 and it continues as the church of the parish. At the beginning of the following century, however, the neighborhood of the parish experienced a major change, as the working class population moved out, replaced by the people of the growing theater industry. Accompanying them was a large number of nightclubs and brothels. The area, previously known as Bloomingdale, became known as the notorious Tenderloin District. The friars came to realize that they were now serving a largely transient congregation of shoppers, commuters and tourists, and they sought new ways to provide the services which would best answer the spiritual needs of this population. One innovative development was the practice they introduced of the \\"Nightworkers Mass\\", held at midnight. This was to allow workers in trades such as printing and the theater to fulfill their religious obligations. Special permission was later given for a midday service to accommodate daytime workers in the area, becoming the first church in the United States to offer this. In 1928, one of the largest mosaics in the United States, The Glorification of the Mother of Jesus by Rudolph Margreiter, was installed in the church. Then, when the Great Depression hit in 1929, the friars responded in September 1930 with a breadline to help feed the hungry of the city. The numbers they served daily reached into the thousands during this period. This service is still provided and is the oldest continuously operated breadline in the United States.\\"Dept. of Kindness: Breadline\\" by Ian Frazer, The New Yorker, January 20, 2014, cited at Be A Franciscan blog and is a noted feature of the parish. The church underwent significant renovations in the late 1950s, with a courtyard added in 1958 and new entrances being opened at the north and side ends of the church in 1961. With further changes in the demographics of the region and congregation, the friars began to offer new services for immigrants and those alienated from the Catholic Church. In 1980, the friars established St. Francis Friends of the Poor, intended to provide housing in the neighborhood for the chronically mentally ill. The apartment buildings which they renovated for this purpose are run as the Saint Francis Residences.St. Francis Friends of the Poor \\"The Story\\" The church's priest Father Mychal Judge was the chaplain to the New York City Fire Department, and on the morning of September 11, 2001, upon hearing of the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center Twin Towers, he rushed downtown to give solace and the last rites of the Catholic Church. While ministering to a victim he was struck by falling debris and was killed instantly. His funeral mass was held at St. Francis Church, led by Cardinal Edward Egan and attended by former President Bill Clinton and Senator Hillary Clinton.

Haran is almost universally identified with Harran, a city whose ruins lie within present-day Turkey. Haran first appears in the Book of Genesis as the home of Terah and his descendants, and as Abraham's temporary home. Later biblical passages list Haran among some cities and lands subjugated by Assyrian rulers and among Tyre's trading partners. Chronology Haran was a place where Terah settled with his son the Patriarch Abraham (who was known as Abram at that time), his nephew Lot, and Abram's wife Sarai, all of them descendants of Arpachshad son of Shem, during their planned journey from Ur Ka≈õdim (Ur of the Chaldees) to the Land of Canaan. The region of this Haran is referred to variously as Paddan Aram and Aram Naharaim. Abram lived there until he was 75 years old before continuing on to Canaan, in response to the command of God. Although Abram's nephew Lot accompanied him to Canaan, Terah and his other descendants remained in Paddan-Aram, where Abraham's grandson Jacob sought his parents' relatives, namely Laban, for whom he worked for twenty years in Haran. In 2 Kings (19:12) and Isaiah (37:12) Haran reappears in the late 8th to early 7th century BC context of the Neo-Assyrian Empire's conquests. It appears again in the Book of Ezekiel (27:23) (6th century BC) as a former trading partner of the Phoenician city Tyre. In the New Testament, Haran is mentioned in the Book of Acts (7:2‚Äì4), in a recounting of the story in Genesis wherein it first appears. In Genesis 28:10‚Äì19, Abraham's grandson Jacob left Beersheba and went toward Haran. Along the way he had his dream of Jacob's Ladder. Name Though the placename can be found in English as Haran, Charan, and Charran, it should not be confused with the personal name Haran, borne by Abram's brother, among others. The biblical placename is (with a ·∏•et) in Hebrew, pronounced and can mean \\"parched\\". The personal name Haran is spelled (with a hei) in Hebrew and means \\"mountaineer\\". Identification Haran is usually identified with Harran, now a village of ≈ûanlƒ±urfa, Turkey. Since the 1950s, archeological excavations of Harran have been conducted,Lloyd and Brice.

She is the younger sister of professional wrestler Alicia Fox. Crawford first gained fame as a contestant on Tough Enough, a televised competition that would award the winner a WWE contract, but was eliminated from the competition. As part of WWE's developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling, she was a one-time FCW Divas Champion. After leaving wrestling in 2012, she became a cheerleader for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League. Professional wrestling career In June 2010, Crawford signed a developmental contract with WWE and was later assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). She debuted on July 8, 2010, in a bikini contest. It was not until November 20 that she made her in-ring debut, under the new ring name Caylee Turner, in a six-diva tag team match with Rosa Mendes and Aksana but lost the match to AJ Lee, Kaitlyn, and Naomi Knight. In February 2011, Crawford was released from her WWE contract in order to participate in the filming of the rebooted Tough Enough series. In March 2011, Crawford was announced as one of the fourteen contestants for the revival of Tough Enough. She was cut from the competition on the May 23 episode, along with A.J. Kirsch. After being cut on Tough Enough, Crawford re-signed with WWE, and returned on June 22 in a tag team match. She spent the next few months mainly competing in tag team matches. Beginning in January 2012, Turner began challenging for the FCW Divas Championship, failing to win it from Audrey Marie. She began feuding with the Anti-Diva Army (Sofia Cortez, Paige, and Raquel Diaz) in March, forming an alliance with Audrey Marie and Kaitlyn to do so. Turner made her debut for NXT Wrestling on the June 20 episode of NXT, as a special guest ring announcer. On June 29, Turner defeated Diaz to win the FCW Divas Championship for the first time. On the August 1, 2012, episode of NXT, Turner appeared in an in-ring segment where NXT Commissioner Dusty Rhodes announced a \\"Gold Rush\\" tournament, featuring 4 developmental roster NXT Superstars and 4 main roster WWE Superstars competing to be crowned as the inaugural NXT Champion. On the August 5 episode of FCW TV, Turner successfully defended her Divas Championship against Sofia Cortez. This would turn out to be her last match in FCW, as she was released from her WWE contract on August 11, 2012. She was still champion upon her release, therefore the title was vacated. Turner made her in-ring debut as a heel on the August 8 episode of NXT, teaming with the villainous Kaitlyn in a losing effort to Tamina Snuka and Paige, which also served as her final televised match for the company before her release. The FCW Divas title was retired three days later on August 14 as a result of the rebranding of FCW to NXT Wrestling, making Turner the final champion. On August 11, 2012, Crawford was released from her WWE contract. On November 1, 2012, Crawford competed in a TNA tryout match in a losing effort against ODB.http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1351885351 She appeared for World Xtreme Wrestling in a wrestling role competing in a winning effort against Angel Love. Crawford made her debut for North East Wrestling (NEW) on December 8 at a North East Wrestling event, where she competed against Ivelisse Velez, in a losing effort. After the match, Crawford turned heel after attacking her and demanding a contract to the promotion. Two days later, Crawford wrestled Velez again at another North East Wrestling event on December 10, this time in a Winner Gets Contract, Loser Banned Forever match, but lost yet again to Velez, thus banning her from the promotion until further notice. Cheerleading career Crawford began working as a cheerleader for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League in 2013.

Paraguayan people comprise an important ethnic group in the country due to the sustained immigration that gained importance in the 1970s. The number of people born in Paraguay living in Argentina has been estimated in around 325,000. Therefore, it is the largest foreign community in the country outnumbering individuals from Italy and Spain (countries which have been historically regarded as the origin of the backbone of Argentine society). It is also one of the fastest growing foreign nationalities. Despite all this, its numbers have been undercounted so it is believed that the real amount is even much higher.  History  The North-Eastern provinces of Argentina were originally inhabited by Guarani tribes conforming with what is now Paraguay and several regions of Brazil the area of influence of Guarani culture. This influence can be seen nowadays in many common cultural features. However, the earliest presence of Paraguayans as an ethnic group can be traced back much later, to the second foundation (and the real permanent settlement) of the city of Buenos Aires by Juan de Garay who sailed down Parana River from Asuncion accompanied by local Mestizo and Guarani families. In addition, there have always been certain connections between the two countries during later periods of the Spanish rule, especially when the Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata was created in 1776 which included several Intendencias, among them the Intendencia of Paraguay and Intendencia of Buenos Aires. There has been Paraguayan presence in Argentine soil during and after the Paraguayan War and after the Revolution of 1947 in Paraguay but it did not acquired importance before 1970. For many economical reasons (Paraguay being an impoverished country) and political reasons (Stroessner dictatorship), Paraguayans started to settle in larger amounts throughout the wealthier neighbouring territory. Another fact was the porosity of Argentine borders and that the population density has always been disproportionally higher in the Eastern region (Argentine-Brazilian border) rather than the Western region or Chaco (Bolivian border). Very different from other immigrant communities in Argentina (European and Middle-Eastern), Paraguayan entrance has been large (with insignificant return rate) and constant even to these days which makes up to 40 years of sustained immigration that does not seem to stop or decline in the future.  Distribution  The distribution is not even, being Buenos Aires city and the homonymous province the top destinations for Paraguayans. 60% of the Paraguayan-born community is settled in these areas. In the North-Eastern Argentine provinces of Misiones, Corrientes, Formosa and Chaco, due to geographical links, lives more than one quarter of the community. The 10% left is spread throughout the rest of the provinces.

Warren was the founder of the Warren Training School and the first and only headmaster of the Chatham Training School. Biography Charles Warren, a graduate of the Trinity College in Durham, North Carolina, arrived in Chatham, Virginia in 1906. He had heard of the dire need for schools in the Chatham area, and decided to take on the challenge himself. Warren organised a day school at the end of Merchant Street, which came to be known as the Warren Training School. WTS averaged an enrollment of twenty boys. After its third session in May, 1909, a lack of funds forced Warren to close the school. Warren was hired as headmaster of the Chatham Training School for the 1909-1910 year. He and John K. Hutton constituted the entire CTS faculty, presiding over seventeen boarding and eighteen day students. At the close of the second session in 1911, Charles R. Warren submitted his resignation. After Warren's departure, the office of headmaster was abolished at the Chatham Training School and replaced with the office of president, with Reverend T. Ryland Sanford being the first to hold the new title. Legacy Charles R. Warren was the first to make a significant effort towards addressing the then- dire need for schools in and around Chatham, Virginia. Though this effort, the Warren Training School, was short-lived, it helped inspire the foundation of the Chatham Training School. Warren led this school during its very first years, helping it survive past the three years that WTS lasted. Warren's most lasting legacy is the ultimate survival of the Chatham Training School, now known as Hargrave Military Academy, to the present day.

In addition to members of the Naval Brigade which accompanied the expedition, awards were made to the crews of the ships on duty off the Ethiopian coast during the campaign. Description The medal is silver and in diameter. It was designed by Joseph and Alfred Wyon, and struck at the Royal Mint. The medal is unique in that the recipient's name and unit were embossed on the reverse. This feature required that the dies for the reverse had a removable centre, so each recipient's name and unit could be impressed, with each medal minted individually. However, most medals awarded to Indian troops had impressed naming. The obverse bears the left facing effigy of a diademed Queen Victoria. Around the edge is a stylised border with indentions, between the indentions are the letters ABYSSINIA. The bust is similar to that on the New Zealand Medal issued in the same year.

It is located about six miles south of Tiller and 21 miles north of Trail on Oregon Route 227, surrounded by the Umpqua National Forest. Drew was probably named after Robert Drew, a local resident. Drew post office was established in 1902 and discontinued in 1971. In 1915 the community had a public school, and the nearest railroad point was 32 miles away in Riddle. As of 1990 there were only a few houses. Drew has a general store and a museum in the former Tison School building, built of logs in 1906.

The area is called \\"South Works\\" because that was the name of the now-shuttered steel plant. The use of the word \\"works,\\" following a common name of the area in which the plant was located, was how US Steel named its plants back then. For example, nearby Gary, Indiana's big US Steel plant is known as \\"Gary Works.\\" History =Steel works= The facility that eventually became South Works began in 1857 under the name of the North Chicago Rolling Mill, which was located in the northern part of the city of Chicago. The plant later moved to South Chicago because raw materials could be shipped in via Lake Michigan, as well as an existing labor pool and available fresh water from the lake and the Calumet River. In 1889, the facility merged with three other steel mills to form a new company called Illinois Steel, which later became part of Federal Steel. By 1901, the company was under the control of US Steel. By 1951, the South Works boasted 11 blast furnaces, 8 electric furnaces, and 12 rolling mills, and employed some 15,000 employees. At its peak, the steel mill employed some 20,000 people, which spurred the development of a new community centered on the mill. The mill complex covered a total of , part of which had been reclaimed from Lake Michigan with molten slag. Beginning in the 1970s, the facility began downsizing due to a shifting market for steel, and by the end of the decade the number of workers at the plant had declined to 10,000. The mill continued its decline, and on 9 January 1992, it was announced that the facility was to close. On 10 April, the plant permanently shut down with fewer than 700 people employed at the time of its closing. =Post closure= Since the steel mill shut down, the area has stood mostly vacant, with only a single brick building and the remains of a ship dock standing. The Solo Cup Company purchased of the site, with the intent of constructing a factory, but later dropped the plans. In 2004, a new park was constructed on the lakefront, with topsoil composed of dried mud obtained from Peoria Lake. From July 8‚Äì10, 2011, the Dave Matthews Band hosted the Dave Matthews Band Caravan at part of the site, of which had been cleared of vegetation and scrap materials, resurfaced with wood chips and renamed Lakeside for the event. The three-day festival hosted numerous artists and bands, and was attended by about 100,000 people. =Current state and Chicago Lakeside Development= The U.S. Steel, the developer McCaffrey Interests, and the City of Chicago propose an ambitious plan for an entirely new housing and commercial complex on roughly of the site. Known as the Chicago Lakeside Development, the proposed plan \\"includes zoning approvals for approximately 13,575 single family dwellings and high-rise units, 17,500,000 SF of retail, the newly-extended South Lake Shore Drive, 125 acres of open space/parks with bike paths, a 1,500-slip boat marina and a new high school.\\" In February 2016, McCaffrey announced that U.S. Steel had declined to proceed and the project as cancelled, but they would proceed with the project if U.S. Steel was willing to sell the land. In late January 2017 it was announced that U.S. Steel had agreed upon the sale of South Works to a joint venture between Barcelona Housing Systems and Emerald Living/WELink. Their plan included a large residential development with up to 12,000 homes. The sale price has not been disclosed, but reports indicate U.S. Steel had sought $55 to $80 million for the property. In April 2018, it was reported that soil contamination on the site could create a barrier to the new development. However, developer Emerald Living remains \\"very committed to the New South Works project.\\" Currently, the site consists of two publicly accessible parks, Steelworkers Park and Park 566. Steelworker's Park includes a large prairie restoration and a monument to the U.S. Steel workers and their families. Park 566 is proposed for redevelopment as open park space with natural areas, fitness trails, and lakeside overlooks. The rest of the site is closed to the public.

Armenians have a history of being divided since the time of the Byzantine Empire and the Sassanid Empire, in the early 5th century. While the two sides of Armenia were sometimes reunited, this became a permanent aspect of the Armenian people. Following the Arab and Seljuk conquests of Armenia, the western portion, which was initially part of Byzantium, became eventually part of the Ottoman Empire, otherwise known as Ottoman Armenia, while the eastern portion became and was kept part of the Iranian Safavid Empire, Afsharid Empire and Qajar Empire, until it became part of the Russian Empire in the course of the 19th century, following the Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828. Safavid Empire Due to its strategic significance, Armenia was constantly fought over and passed back and forth between the dominion of Iran and the Ottomans. At the height of the Ottoman-Persian Wars, Yerevan changed hands fourteen times between 1513 and 1737. Map of the Erivan khanate In 1604, Shah Abbas I pursued a scorched earth campaign against the Ottomans in the Ararat valley. The old Armenian town of Julfa in the province of Nakhichevan was taken early in the invasion. From there, Abbas' army fanned out across the Araratian plain. The Shah pursued a careful strategy, advancing and retreating as the occasion demanded, determined not to risk his enterprise in a direct confrontation with stronger enemy forces. While laying siege to Kars, he learned of the approach of a large Ottoman army, commanded by Djghazad√© Sinan Pasha. The order to withdraw was given; but to deny the enemy the potential to resupply themselves from the land, he ordered the wholesale destruction of the Armenian towns and farms on the plain. As part of this, the whole population was ordered to accompany the Iranian army in its withdrawal. Some 300,000 people were duly herded to the banks of the Araxes River. Julfa was treated as a special case; he entrusted its evacuation to a renegade Georgian prince, Hanis Thahmaz-Ghuli Bek. He told Julfa's residents that they had three days to prepare for deportation to Iran; anyone still in town after those three days would be killed. Those who attempted to resist the mass deportation were killed outright. The Shah had previously ordered the destruction of the only bridge, and although Iranian soldiers helped the Julfaites to cross on horses and camels, the rest of the deportees had to cross on their own, so people were forced into the waters, where a great many drowned, carried away by the currents, before reaching the opposite bank. This was only the beginning of their ordeal. One eyewitness, Father de Guyan, describes the predicament of the refugees thus: ::It was not only the winter cold that was causing torture and death to the deportees. The greatest suffering came from hunger. The provisions which the deportees had brought with them were soon consumed... The children were crying for food or milk, none of which existed, because the women's breasts had dried up from hunger... Many women, hungry and exhausted, would leave their famished children on the roadside, and continue their tortuous journey. Some would go to nearby forests in search of something to eat. Usually they would not come back. Often those who died, served as food for the living. Unable to maintain his army on the desolate plain, Sinan Pasha was forced to winter in Van. Armies sent in pursuit of the Shah in 1605 were defeated, and by 1606 Abbas had regained all of the territory lost to the Turks earlier in his reign. The scorched-earth tactic had worked, though at a terrible cost to the Armenian people. Of the 300,000 deported, it is estimated that under half survived the march to Isfahan. In the conquered territories, Abbas established the Erivan khanate, a Muslim principality under the dominion of the Safavid Empire. As a result of the continuous wars in the region and Shah Abbas I's deportation of much of the Armenian population from the Ararat valley and the surrounding region, in 1605 Armenians formed less than 20% of its population.

He is chiefly remembered as a church architect, with his early work being in the Gothic revival and tractarian style, before developing his own distinct style. Life Henderson's first office at Blenheim Place, Edinburgh The Panmure Testimonial monument The India Buildings at the head of Victoria St, Edinburgh (completed by David Cousin) Lady Glenorchy's Church, Blenheim Place, Edinburgh Glenalmond College Holy Trinity Church, Dunoon He was born at the Den Nursery in Brechin to John Henderson and Agnes Thomson. Henderson's father was a gardener for William Maule, 1st Baron Panmure at Brechin Castle. He was initially apprenticed as a carpenter but after completing this he pursued studies in drawing and building construction. His first design was for the addition of a steeple at the parish church in Arbroath in 1831. After completing this project, he became an assistant to architect Thomas Hamilton; a post he remained in until establishing his own architecture firm in 1833. This was set up at 1 Blenheim Place (next to R & R Dickson's office) before moving to 6 Union Street. In 1836 he relocated into more prestigious accommodation at 16 London Street, then was variously at 8 Duke Street (now called Dublin Street), 73 Queen Street (at his peak) and finally at 7 Hill Street. He designed and oversaw the building of numerous churches in Scotland up until his death in 1862 at the age of 58. He also notably designed the original buildings for Glenalmond College. Several notable architects were trained by him, including Alexander Davidson, William Hay, John Milne, James Milne Monro, and his son George Henderson. On his death, his son who was only 16, completed his apprenticeship with David Cousin. Henderson died at home, 7 Greenhill Park (a villa of his own design) in south-west Edinburgh on 27 June 1862. He was buried in Grange Cemetery in south Edinburgh. The grave lies in the north-west section. Family He was married to Hannah Matilda Exley (1821‚Äì1897).

She was a strong advocate for the rights of people with disabilities and upon retiring from her long career in teaching, she worked with the American Foundation for the Blind. Background Sophia Kindrick Alcorn was born the youngest of seven children of James Walker and Sophie Ann (Kindrick) Alcorn in Stanford, Kentucky, on August 3, 1883.Kleber, pp. 10‚Äì11 Annie Alcorn was the eldest of her siblings, marrying in November 1899 James N. Saunders who practiced law in her father's office. Her only brother, Kindrick Sommers Alcorn (1880‚Äì1966) graduated from Stanford Male Academy and then nearby Centre College, getting his law degree from the University of Virginia. He practiced law with his father and became a popular circuit judge from the 1930s-50s. Alcorn attended Ward Seminary (now Belmont University) in Nashville, Tennessee and then went on to receive training in teaching the deaf at Clark School in Northampton, Massachusetts. She earned her M.A. degree from Wayne University in Detroit, Michigan. There she assisted in training teachers and served as a principal in the deaf school system. Career in education of the deaf Alcorn moved to Morganton, North Carolina to teach for one year at the North Carolina School for the Deaf (1908‚Äì09), then returned to Kentucky, teaching at the Kentucky School for the Deaf in Danville, Kentucky. The Kentucky School for the Deaf is the oldest state-supported school of its type in the U.S. and was the first school for the deaf west of the Alleghenies. Alcorn taught there from 1909 to 1920, and it was here that she first developed the Tadoma method. In November 1910 the eight-year-old Oma Simpson came to the school. Oma had been deaf since birth and meningitis at age two had left her totally blind. She was the school's first deafblind student and was assigned to the charge of \\"Miss Sophie.\\" Alcorn realized that the manual alphabet would not work and she started to teach her oral speech instead. Adopting the methods of the famous Anne Sullivan, teacher and lifelong companion to Helen Keller, Alcorn invented a system of touch on the cheek and neck to allow the child to imitate how to speak words. She taught Oma for ten years, working on U.S. history, geography and mathematics‚Äîas well as knitting, weaving and touch-typing. Oma was the first deafblind person in the world to be educated orally. When the Simpson family left Kentucky, Alcorn moved with them to answer the plea of the father of a deafblind boy, Winthrop (Tad) Chapman. She began teaching at the South Dakota School for the Deaf and worked with Tad for four years, perfecting her system of what she called the Tadoma Tactile-Sense Method. She pioneered a system of visual symbols, first using pipe cleaners to easily create the shapes. She named her method Tadoma after these two children: Tad and Oma. (See more on Tad Chapman at his niece's blog.) Alcorn had trained a colleague at the South Dakota school, Inis B. Hall, on the Tadoma method. Hall took over the education of Tad Chapman when Alcorn left for Detroit to research the use of vibration techniques in teaching language and speech to sighted deaf children. When Chapman was accepted in 1931 to attend the Perkins School for the Blind in Massachusetts, Hall accompanied him and introduced Alcorn's Tadoma system to the teachers there. Until the mid-1950s Tadoma was the preferred method of teaching oral speech to children who were deafblind. After Alcorn left the South Dakota School for the Deaf, she taught at the Day School in Des Moines, Iowa (1925‚Äì25). She also taught at the Oral School in Cincinnati from 1927 to 1929. In 1930, she taught at the New Jersey School for the Deaf, and then moved to Detroit to work at the School for the Deaf where she stayed until she retired in 1953. In Detroit she served as teacher and supervising principal. When she retired, Alcorn returned to Stanford where she became a member of the Stanford Woman's Club and served as the first woman elder in the Stanford Presbyterian Church. The critical need for trained teachers drew Alcorn to begin work with the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB). Founded in 1921, this foundation was greatly supported and publicized throughout the 1920s by Keller and Sullivan. The Tadoma method required extensive training and highly skilled educators. In order to accommodate a greater diversity of teachers, the schools began supplementing the Tadoma method with the manual alphabet and sign language. That year, in 1953, the American Foundation for the Blind and the Perkins School co-sponsored the first conference on education of the deafblind. Alcorn worked actively with the AFB until her death on November 28, 1967. She was buried at the Buffalo Spring Cemetery in Stanford. Alcorn died only one year before Helen Keller.

Retrieved 17 May 2019. History The parish was established in 1840 as the second parish to serve German Catholics in New York City, after St. Nicholas' Church, on East 2nd Street, which was established in 1833.Dunlap, David W., From Abyssinian to Zion: A Guide to Manhattan's Houses of Worship. (New York: Columbia University Press, 2004.) p. 215-216. An historian noted: \\"Both German parishes had lay trustees that were so overbearing that they drove out several pastors.\\" The first church erected was a small timber structure. It was dedicated 20 September 1840. The first pastor was the Rev. Zachary Kunze, O.F.M., who, following disharmony with the lay Board of Trustees, resigned in 1844. Kunze left with a portion of the congregation and founded the nearby Church of St. Francis of Assisi. The problems were so great with the Board of Trustees that, following the resignation of Kunze, the parish of St. John the Baptist was under interdict until 1845 when the Rev. J. A. Jakob became its second pastor. More disagreements ensued and the church was again closed in June 1846. It variously reopened with different pastors, but burned down on 10 January 1847. Archbishop John Hughes laid the cornerstone for a new brick church on the site on the 14 March 1847. Until 1851, pastorship of the parish was assumed by the Church of the Nativity until the Rev. Joseph Lutz was appointed pastor. Four months later, the parish was again under interdiction. Lutz explained: \\"On account of the obstinacy of the parishioners this church was closed and the administration of the Sacraments prohibited by order of His Grace, November 24, 1851.\\" The Rev. P. J. Matschejewski arrived as pastor on 7 March 1852 but remained only two weeks. Father Augustine Danter, O.M.Cap., was appointed as pastor in 1852 and remained until 1869, when he was obliged to retire, after which the church remained closed for some months. In response to the many disputes, Archbishop of New York Cardinal John McCloskey, suppressed St. John the Baptist in 1870 and requested that the newly founded American Province of the Capuchin Friars assume complete control of the resurrected parish. Under the Capuchins, especially its second Capuchin pastor, the Swiss-born Father Bonventura Frey, O.M.Cap., parish animosity dissipated. Under Frey, the German congregation began to erect the present substantial church. Frey left in 1879 to serve as the Minister Provincial of the Capuchins friars in the United States, and moved to their headquarters in Calvary, Wisconsin. He returned from 1888 to 1891 to prepare the parish for its Golden Jubilee. In 1914 the membership of the parish was 1,500. In the early 20th century one of the parish's priests was the (now) Blessed Solanus Casey. Buildings The present French Gothic-style stone church was built between 1871 and 1872 to the designs of the prolific ecclesiastical architect Napoleon LeBrun, architect of several New York Catholic churches as well as the cathedral in Philadelphia. The cornerstone was laid by Fr. Frey on Pentecost Sunday, June 4 or June 11 of 1871. The church is 165 feet long and 67 feet wide, originally accommodating 1,200 people, and costing $175,000 to construct View from the northeast, c. 1911, depicting the church (at left) in relation to the then new Penn Station The Capuchin Convent of St. John the Baptist on 31st Street, facing Madison Square Garden Fr. Frey returned to the parish in 1888 and built the central bell tower in preparation for the church's Golden Jubilee held on 18‚Äì19 January 1891 and marked by Archbishop Michael Corrigan, Bishop Wigger of Newark, Archbishop-elect Katzer of Milwaukee and Abbott H. Pfraengle of Newark. The tower has a carillon of five swinging bells cast by the J.G. Stuckstede & Brothers Foundry in St. Louis, Missouri. The peal still rings each day. The church was dedicated on June 23, 1872, by Archbishop John Cardinal McClosky, the first American cardinal. In preparation for the church's 125th anniversary, it underwent a complete renovation, which lasted several years. The church was re-dedicated on 24 June 1996, the feast day of its patron saint, by Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor, Archbishop of New York. The church's organ and choir gallery, as well as a number of statues and stained-glass windows, were destroyed in a fire on 10 January 1997. The damage was eventually repaired and the organ was replaced with an electronic one. According to bronze memorial plaques affixed to the wall of the narthex, for the 160th anniversary of the parish and the Great Jubilee Year of 2000, the bell tower was restored by funds provided by Antonio D'Urso and his wife Giovanna Parpo in 2000.

The AIA Guide to NYC (2010) described the church as \\"...a Roman Catholic Trinity. The interior of white, radiates light.

An additional floor was added to the rectory to accommodate the school and the Marist Brothers who were in charge of the boys. The Sisters of St. Dominic were in charge of the girls.

Seoul is classed as having a temperate climate with four distinct seasons, but temperature differences between the hottest part of summer and the depths of winter are extreme. In summer the influence of the North Pacific high-pressure system brings hot, humid weather with temperatures soaring as high as 35 ¬∞C (95 ¬∞F) on occasion. In winter the city is topographically influenced by expanding Siberian High- pressure zones and prevailing west winds, temperatures dropping almost as low as -20 ¬∞C (-4 ¬∞F) in severe cold waves. The bitterly cold days tend to come in three-day cycles regulated by rising and falling pressure systems, during winter snowfall can cause frosty weather in the city. The most pleasant seasons, for most people in the city are spring and autumn, when azure blue skies and comfortable temperatures are regular. Most of Seoul's precipitation falls in the summer monsoon period between June and September, as a part of East Asian monsoon season.Seoul Weather Forecast, Climate, When to Go: Weather in Seoul Area, South Korea Factors Seoul has a wet and very humid climate during the summer season, with cold and dry weather during the winter season. Spring (although windy) and autumn are mild but are short in duration. These seasons are considered the best time to visit Seoul.Korea: General Information about Seoul *Siberian winds bring frosty weather with sporadic snowfall in the city, which takes the average temperature down to 0 to -10 degrees Celsius.Fray Adventures: Siberian Winds Ahhh! *Asian Dust is a seasonal meteorological phenomenon which affects much of East Asia including South Korea sporadically during the springtime months. The dust storms also affect wildlife particularly hard, destroying crops, habitat, and toxic metals interfering with reproduction.DPRK Climate *The East Asian monsoon brings heavy precipitation during a short rainy season called jangma, from the end of June through the end of July. *Typhoon season occurs from July through September. About once each year, a typhoon passes very close to or moves over Korea, causing heavy showers. Seasonal climate As a temperate climate, Seoul has winter, spring, summer and autumn seasons. The monsoon season and typhoons also occurs in the summer season. =Winter= The winter in Seoul is controlled by the large Siberian high pressure system (the Asiatic high), which results in predominantly cold, dry north-westerly winds. The influence of the Siberian high leads to significantly colder winter temperatures than would be expected at this latitude. About every 4 to 6 days a low-pressure trough will move through South Korea, bringing with it cloudiness and light precipitation. The amount of precipitation locally depends mostly on the elevation of the station and the length of time that the air has been over the Yellow Sea. Maximum snowfall occurs over the northwest coast, which is the most exposed to the northwesterly flow, and in the mountain areas. Normally less than 10 percent of the annual precipitation falls (falls very much) during the winter. Frequently the weather is cloudless, clear, and dry, except for the southwestern region of the peninsula. The mean January temperature in Seoul is -2.4 ¬∞C (27 ¬∞F). January is the coldest month in Seoul, often with the lowest temperatures, almost always dropping below -10 ¬∞C (14 ¬∞F), and sometimes below -15 ¬∞C (5 ¬∞F). =Summer= During the summer, East Asian monsoon winds engulf the city and the warm, moisture laden air moving off the oceans clashes with the drier air to the north. These fronts oscillate back and forth across Korea during the summer months. The interior highlands disturb the winds, forcing them into a westerly/southwesterly direction. The majority of the annual precipitation falls between late June and the middle of September, with rains fully developing along the entire peninsula by mid-June. Seoul receives approximately 126 mm (5 in) of precipitation during the winter (December‚ÄìMarch), but in July alone receives approximately 383 mm (14.3 in). July is the wettest month in the metropolis. Thunderstorms usually occur about 2 to 5 days per month during this period. Summer precipitation in Seoul is as likely to occur at 0200 as at 1400. Humidity is very high and fog will develop whenever a cold air mass confronts this moisture laden air, often forming on cloudless days. The typhoon season occurs from July through September. About once each year, a typhoon will pass very close to or move over Korea, causing heavy showers. Strong winds are usually confined to islands and exposed coastal areas. Although winds might not pose a problem, the associated rainfall can cause significant flash flooding, a very real threat during the rainy season, especially in rough terrain. The mean temperature for Seoul in August is 25.7 ¬∞C (78 ¬∞F) =Autumn= October is the transition month between the summer rainy season and the cold, dry winter. The predominantly tropical cloudy weather of the summer is replaced by cooler, drier, and less cloudy conditions. The primary weather producers during October are cold frontal systems from the Asian mainland. On the average, one frontal passage per week can be expected during the month. A typical frontal passage is proceeded by increasing middle and high cloudiness with light rain. Following the frontal passage, mostly clear skies can be expected for 3 or 4 days. During this clear period it is very likely for fog to form. Fog is especially prevalent in river valleys and in low-lying areas.

Bland that connects jazz to African American history. It uses footage of Chicago's black neighborhoods and performances by Sun Ra, John Gilmore, and Julian Priester interspersed with scenes of musicians and intellectuals, both black and white, conversing at a jazz club. It has been credited as being an early example of the Black pride movement and with predicting the urban riots of the 1960s and 70s, and has also been called the first Hip-Hop film.Ed Bland, ‚Äò‚ÄòThe Cry of Jazz‚Äô‚ÄôMatt Rogers, \\"In Time\\", Waxpoetics issue 34 In 2010, this film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". The Library of Congress had this to say of the film and its significance: > Cry of Jazz...is now recognized as an early and influential example of > African-American independent filmmaking. Director Ed Bland, with the help of > more than 60 volunteer crew members, intercuts scenes of life in Chicago‚Äôs > black neighborhoods with interviews of interracial artists and > intellectuals. Cry of Jazz argues that black life in America shares a > structural identity with jazz music. With performance clips by the jazz > composer, bandleader and pianist Sun Ra and his Arkestra, the film > demonstrates the unifying tension between rehearsed and improvised jazz. Cry > of Jazz is a historic and fascinating film that comments on racism and the > appropriation of jazz by those who fail to understand its artistic and > cultural origins. Plot The Cry of Jazz is set in Chicago at the meeting of a jazz appreciation club of musicians and intellectuals, both Black and White. It is broken up into seven parts. Parts one, three, five, and seven center around conversations between the jazz club members. Parts two, four, and six are done in a documentary style and utilize footage of life in Chicago as well as of Sun Ra's band performing the music. Alex, the film's main character, serves as narrator during these sections. Although the film is nominally about jazz, jazz is utilized primarily as a metaphor through which to understand the African American experience.Damon Locks, \\"The Cry of Jazz: Q&A; with Director Edward Bland\\" =Part 1= As the majority of the attendees of the jazz club leave, the crowd that remains is composed of two White men, Bruce and John, two White women, Natalie and Faye, and three Black men, Alex, Louis, and Bob. Alex overhears Bruce telling Natalie that rock and roll is jazz, which prompts a discussion about what jazz is. When Bruce asserts, \\"jazz is merely the Negro's cry of joy and suffering,\\" the White characters protest, upset with Bruce's implication that only Black people could have created jazz. Alex elaborates on Bruce's point, explaining, \\"the Negro was the only one with the necessary musical and human history to create jazz.\\" =Part 2= Alex makes a direct comparison between the structure of jazz and the Black experience in the United States. Jazz plays over shots of Black neighborhoods of Chicago, an attempt to demonstrate the affinity between jazz and Black life. Alex continues to explain jazz as the \\"triumph of the Negro spirit\\" over the difficulties Black people face in a racist America. He links the restrictive form and changes of jazz to this limitation and suffering, and improvisation to an expression of joy and freedom within a restrictive society. Alex also argues that the sound of jazz reflects the \\"characteristic atmosphere, color, and sensuality\\" of Black life, just as the sound of jazz played by Whites reflects White life. =Part 3= Bruce and Natalie again express confusion with the claim that Blacks see America differently than Whites. Alex responds that Black people see America in a unique way because they have never been fully included in American society, yet have found ways to survive. Alex and Louis then assert that slavery and continued racism constitute an erasure of the past, present, and future of Black people in America, and that through music Black people have created a record of their history. =Part 4= Alex traces the history of jazz, from New Orleans jazz, to swing, to be-bop, to cool jazz. Footage of Sun Ra's band playing examples of each style accompanies the description of each type of jazz. =Part 5= A discussion arises concerning what it would take to achieve racial equality in America. From Alex and Louis's perspective, America must come to celebrate the story of joy and suffering told through jazz, as it is a story that transcends national and ethnic boundaries. When Natalie then asks about the future of jazz, Alex claims that jazz is dead, startling all the characters. =Part 6= In Alex's opinion, jazz is dead because the form and the changes of jazz cannot evolve, as any alteration to the form and changes of jazz would not result in jazz. Alex claims that therefore, because jazz cannot grow, it is dead. While Alex asserts that this \\"jazz body\\" is dead, he maintains that the \\"spirit of jazz\\" is alive. He goes on to express that the \\"jazz body\\", which contains the restraining elements of jazz, must die because the social restraints on Black people in America must end. =Part 7= The White characters continue to contest the death of jazz. Alex suggests that the \\"spirit of jazz\\" will give rise to a new form of music. When Bruce then asks how Whites fit into this story, Louis and Alex proclaim that what happens to Black people in America concerns Whites because it implicates their morality and humanity. The film ends with Alex's assertion that the world's perceptions of the United States will depend on American society's treatment of black people. Production In the early to mid 1950s the composer Edward Bland, novelist Mark Kennedy, city- planner Nelam Hill, and mathematician Eugene Titus conceived the idea for The Cry of Jazz. Together they formed KHTB Productions, which took its name from the first letter of each person's last name. It took several years for them to write the script, and several more to make the film itself. Bland assumed the role of director while maintaining his job as a postal worker, the income from which he devoted to the film. Along with Bland, Kennedy, Hill, and Titus contributed personal funds to the film, which amounted to a final budget of approximately $3,500. Given this minimal budget, Bland and his co-creators relied on an entirely volunteer cast and crew of 65 people to complete the production of The Cry of Jazz. Production of the film was completed in 1958, and it was released by KHTB in 1959. =Sun Ra's Involvement= As the production of The Cry of Jazz began, Bland, serving as the film's Musical Director, was responsible for scoring the film. Bland knew Sun Ra personally, as they were both living in Chicago at the time. Additionally, Bland was aware that Sun Ra owned the rights to his music released through El Saturn Records, his own record label. Ra and his business partner and co-owner of El Saturn, Alton Abraham, allowed Ra's music be used for The Cry of Jazz without charge in exchange for Bland's incorporation of live footage of Ra's band performing the music, as well as highlighting Ra's involvement in billing and publicity. While Bland found Sun Ra's music exciting and felt that it fit the aesthetic direction of the film, he was uninterested in Ra's eccentric personal philosophy and cosmology. Thus, this element of Sun Ra's career did not factor into his involvement with The Cry of Jazz. Bland and Sun Ra maintained a personal and professional relationship until 1967. According to Bland, by the mid 1960s, Sun Ra \\"was stressing his 'Sun God of Jazz' propaganda more than ever\\", and in addition began showing up late to recording sessions, prompting Bland to stop working with him.Ed Bland, \\"Personal Recollections of Sun Ra 1956-1967\\" =Sequel= Bland wrote the screenplay for a sequel to The Cry of Jazz titled The American Hero, but received 109 rejections from production companies, causing him to abandon the project. Bland gave this description of The American Hero in a 1960 article for the journal Film Culture: > \\"In our next film, which will be a 35mm feature length film amplifying and > carrying further various facets of this film, we expect an even greater > impact, primarily because the audience will not be able to use jazz as an > escape.\\"Ed Bland, \\"On \\"The Cry of Jazz\\"\\", Film Culture, 1960 Inspiration According to Bland, The Cry of Jazz was made in part as a reaction to the rising popularity of the cool jazz of the 1950s. In the early years of that decade, Bland, Hill, Kennedy, and Titus frequented a club in Chicago's Southside called Jimmy's, where they would converse with young musicians and jazz fans, both black and white. The most popular and well-known players of cool jazz were white, and in Bland's view, the general excitement with cool jazz neglected to recognize jazz as fundamentally black music. In an interview with Waxpoetics, Bland referred specifically to the young white jazz fans he termed \\"jazz critics-to-be\\" as the primary perpetrators of this crime. In Bland's words: \\"I felt there was a racial angle too; I felt they were trying to, shall we say, wipe the Blackness out of jazz. And they wouldn't listen to us, so we decided to put it in stone.\\" In an introduction to The Cry of Jazz delivered at the Maysles Documentary Center in Harlem, film critic Armond White hypothesized that Bland may also have been responding to Norman Mailer's essay The White Negro, which reflects positively on the appropriation of African American culture and language by young white hipsters.\\"Armond White introduces The Cry of Jazz on Vimeo Reception The reception of The Cry of Jazz when it was first released in 1959 was mixed at best, \\"hideous\\" at worst. In 1960 Bland claimed that \\"The reaction of a great majority of Negro audiences...has been favorable.\\" However, in a 2007 interview, Bland described the film's reception in the following manner: \\"It was considered the work of madmen. Black racists. At best it was considered a personal statement. Bad music, bad thinking, bad acting, bad writing and bad photography. Unfair to jazz, because we made jazz a political act.\\" However, The Cry of Jazz did receive some favorable coverage from white film critics. Kenneth Tynan, film critic for the London Observer, hailed it as ‚Äúthe first film in which the American Negro has issued a direct challenge to the white.\\"Paul Vitello, \\"Edward Bland Dies at 86; Made 'Cry of Jazz'\\", New York Times, 28 Mar. 2013 In their review for Film Quarterly, Ernest Callenbach and Dominic Salvatore called it \\"brave,\\" \\"immensely significant,\\" and \\"a film everybody should look at with attention.\\"Ernest Callenbach and Dominic Salvatore, \\"The Cry of Jazz\\", Film Quarterly, Winter 1959 Black intellectuals' reception of The Cry of Jazz was incredibly divided. The poet Amiri Baraka, one of the founding voices of the Black Arts Movement, reportedly found the film \\"profoundly insightful.\\" Novelist Ralph Ellison, by Bland's own account, hated it. In 1960 the filmmaker Jonas Mekas organized a viewing and discussion of The Cry of Jazz in New York City. Attendees included Bland, Ellison, Nat Hentoff, and Marshall Stantoff. Debate over the film became so heated that the police were called. Bland responded to criticism of The Cry of Jazz in a 1960 article for Film Culture. In this article, Bland identifies the most frequent critiques of The Cry of Jazz, beginning with the contestation that jazz is not dead. Bland dismisses this critique on the grounds that it is voiced only by the \\"musically illiterate.\\" Bland also acknowledges critiques of the quality of the film, to which he concedes, as well as assertions that The Cry of Jazz is racist and no different that the White Citizens Council, which Bland again dismisses. Jazz in 1959 In contrast to the claim made in The Cry of Jazz that \\"jazz is dead\\", 1959 is widely considered a landmark year of innovation in jazz due to the release of four significant albums: Kind of Blue by Miles Davis, Time Out by The Dave Brubeck Quartet, Mingus Ah Um by Charles Mingus, and The Shape of Jazz to Come by Ornette Coleman.BBC, \\"1959: The Year that Changed Jazz\\" Each of these albums made a unique contribution to jazz. With Kind of Blue, Miles Davis established a previously developing style of jazz, called modal jazz, which uses fewer chords and melodic improvisation based on scales. Today Kind of Blue is recognized as the best-selling jazz album of all time.Scott DeVeaux and Gary Giddins. Jazz. New York: W. W. Norton, 2009. pg. 377. In Time Out, Dave Brubeck and his quartet pushed the boundaries of jazz by experimenting with different time signatures, such as 9/8 in ‚ÄúBlue Rondo a la Turk‚Äù and 5/4 in \\"Take Five.\\" Up to this point, the vast majority of jazz was based on 4/4 time. Time Out also became extremely popular for a jazz album, and catapulted Brubeck to international fame.Scott DeVeaux and Gary Giddins. Jazz. New York: W. W. Norton, 2009. pg. 323. Charles Mingus's Mingus Ah Um is most notable for its variety. Mingus was adept at pulling inspiration from and composing in a multiplicity of jazz styles. Elements of swing, hard bop, soul jazz, and cool jazz, are all evident in Mingus Ah Um.Scott DeVeaux and Gary Giddins. Jazz. New York: W. W. Norton, 2009. pg. 353-55. With The Shape of Jazz to Come, Ornette Coleman took jazz in a radical new direction by debuting avant-garde jazz. This new style did away with many of the characteristic features of jazz, including easily discernable rhythms, regular form, and planned harmonic structure. For instance, the track ‚ÄúLonely Woman‚Äù is not based on an underlying chord progression. While The Shape of Jazz to Come was very controversial, it did expand the boundaries of jazz.Scott DeVeaux and Gary Giddins. Jazz. New York: W. W. Norton, 2009. pg. 410-413.

Parish The parish was established in 1830. Or according to other sources in 1841 \\"with a rather stormy history.\\" The church originally stood on the site of the present St. Patrick's Cathedral, Manhattan. The first Catholic presence of the site there dated from 1810 when the Society of Jesus moved their academy to a fine old house on 50th Street and Fifth Avenue where they created a chapel of St. Ignatius. The chapel was then occupied by Trappist monks from 1813 to 1815, and appears to have ceased function after that. Bishop of New York John Dubois reopened the chapel in 1840 for Catholics employed at the Deaf and Dumb Asylum and in the general neighborhood. A modest frame church was built and dedicated 9 May 1841 by the Rev. John Hughes, administrator of the diocese. Tickets were sold to the dedication to ease the parish's debt level, managed by a lay Board of Trustees, but to no avail and the property mortgage was finally foreclosed on and the church sold at auction. The stress is said to have contributed to the death that year of the church's pastor, the Rev. Felix Larkin. The experience was blamed on the management of the trustees and this incident is said to have played a significant role in the abolishment of the lay trusteeship, which occurred shortly thereafter. The young and energetic Rev. Michael A. Curran was appointed to raise funds for the devastated parish, and shortly fitted up an old college hall as a temporary church. Fr. Curran continued raising funds to buy back the church during the Great Famine in Ireland, eventually succeeding and taking the deed in his own name. \\"The site of St. Patrick's Cathedral, hence, came to the Church through the labors of this young priest and the self-denial of his countrymen and not by the fight of the city.\\" The debt was finally all paid for by 1853, by which time it had become clear that a larger church for the parish was needed elsewhere as its current site had been selected for the new cathedral. Rev. James McMahon (later of Catholic University) had a new church built one block east of Madison Avenue, freeing the previous site for St. Patrick's Cathedral. The new church measured 140 by 90 feet and contained an organ valued at $30,000, which was constructed under the direction of Fr. McMahon, who was a skilled musician. A fire on 10 January 1871 destroyed both church and organ, yet the church was rebuilt again within a year. With the opening of St. Patrick's in 1879, St. John's parish was removed eastward in 1879 to its current location. In 1914, the Catholic population of the parish was around 7,000 and the property valued at $425,000. Pastors *?-1841: Rev. Felix Larkin (d.1841) *1841-?: Rev. Michael A. Curran *Rev.

His claim to fame is the use of the Parker Brothers Monopoly character ‚ÄúMr.Monopoly‚Äù from the Hasbro brand board game. They fully support his use of their image. The artist has also worked in the urban environments of Miami, Los Angeles, Europe, Mexico and throughout Asia using varied materials (including stencils, spray paint, epoxies, varnishes and newspapers) to depict various iconic pop culture characters. He also is a brand ambassador with Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer and created a mural live, on red carpet for the 2013 film, Justin Bieber's Believe. Monopoly's work has been purchased by Philipp Plein, Miley Cyrus, Robin Thicke, Snoop Dogg, Seth Rogen, Adrien Brody and Iggy Azalea. Life and work Monopoly grew up in New York and moved to Los Angeles in 2006. He found working there was easier because of the many billboards in the city, and because of New York City's more discerning art world. Monopoly is best known for his tuxedoed and top-hatted graffiti character of Monopoly Man, an idea originally inspired by the stockbroker Bernie Madoff. According to John Wellington Ennis writing for the Huffington Post, \\"In an era of billion dollar bailouts for banks that already own the country and moguls decrying regulation as un-American, the re- contextualization of the childhood symbol of success and wealth almost needed no explanation.\\" Monopoly also pastes up images of Jack Nicholson.

The parish was established in 1887, and the church was built between 1890 and 1903. It is located within the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission's Greenwich Village Historic District Extension I, which was designated in 2006. History The parish was founded in 1887 to accommodate the increased number of Catholics in the area, which had caused the Church of St. Joseph in Greenwich Village to become overcrowded; it was one of 99 new parishes created by Archbishop Michael A. Corrigan between 1887 and 1902. The parish's first Mass was celebrated in a former stable on Washington Street, near Barrow Street The first pastor was the Rev. John Fitzharris, who had previously been the first assistant pastor at St. Joseph's. He was succeeded after his death in 1893 by the Rev. Daniel McCormick. The Rev. Joseph F. Flannelly succeeded McCormick after the latter's death in 1904. In 1914, the parish had a Catholic population of around 6,500. Buildings The site for the present church was purchased in 1888 for $69,500, but the cornerstone was not laid until March 1890. The basement was completed by that October and was used for services until the parish could raise sufficient funds to start up construction again in 1902; the church, which was designed by John J. Deery in Victorian Gothic Revival style, was completed in 1903. The Rev. Daniel McCormick, rector from 1893 to 1904, built a rectory from 1893‚Äì1894, and acquired the old St. Joseph's School at 112-116 Leroy Street in 1897. Upon the church's completion, the Rev. Joseph F. Flannelly built a new school at the southwest corner of Barrow and Washington Streets in 1905. The four-story over basement brick and stone parochial school was built to designs by William K. Benedict at a cost of $90,000 In 1914, the school was run by the Christian Brothers, the Sisters of Charity, and 21 lay teachers, and had 1,400 pupils. On Sunday, June 25, 2017 the historic St. Veronica‚Äôs Catholic church on Christopher Street hosted its last official services: Mass in English at 10 a.m. and then in Spanish at 11:15 a.m. Both were led by the church‚Äôs pastor, the Rev. Santiago Rubio. Parishioners were expected to attend Our Lady of Guadalupe at St. Bernard's on West 14th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. A group of St. Veronica's parishioners rallied to have the church reopened, taking the cause all the way to the Vatican. As of July 2nd, 2020, the Decree of Closure was rescinded by His Eminence Timothy Cardinal Dolan, after it became clear that the Vatican's verdict would support the parishioners case. Further information is pending.

L. Konigsburg. Set primarily in Milan, Italy, it features Leonardo da Vinci, his servant Salai, and duchess Beatrice d'Este. Through the experiences of Salai narrated in third person, it explores the background of da Vinci's Mona Lisa. The book was published by Atheneum in 1975, manufactured by Halliday Lithograph Corporation with ten black-and-white museum plates of da Vinci paintings and drawings, of which several figure in the story.Mrs. Giaconda, frontispiece, title leaf, appendix.The Second Mrs. Gioconda: Online page count and paginated contents for the 1998 edition imply identical layout: text and page numbers ending page 138, followed by plates. Summary A prologue opens by asking, \\"Why did Leonardo da Vinci choose to paint the portrait of the second wife of an unimportant Florentine merchant when dukes and duchesses ... were begging for a portrait by his hand?\\"Mrs. Giaconda, p. 3. It introduces Salai by five quotations from Leonardo's notebooks and his will. Early narrative chapters establish those two characters and their relationship. The son of a poor shoemaker, Salai is a cutpurse caught in the act by the master, whose grasp and visage he mistakes for the hand and face of God. Leonardo takes him as an apprentice, at no fee, and practically as a servant. Salai remains a scoundrel who moves from petty theft to selling his master's sketches, and later to selling his audiences. Princess Beatrice comes to Milan and marries Il Moro, the duke, who had hoped to marry her beautiful older sister Isabella d'Este. He continues to wait on his beautiful mistress Cecilia Gallerani, the subject of a Da Vinci portrait that is already famous. \\"She's small and dark and perfectly plain\\", Salai says when he first sees Beatrice; when they meet by accident, she is \\"trying to get the sun to make me blond and beautiful\\".The Second Mrs. Gioconda, pp. 38, 51. They discover a shared taste for mischief. To Leonardo she laments, \\"Could I but gain my husband's love, I know that I could disguise this plain brown wrapping.\\" He asks what she has \\"to give him that Cecilia has not\\" and she volunteers her \\"sense of fun\\".Mrs. Gioconda, pp. 60‚Äì61. Salai and even Leonardo often visit Beatrice and she becomes the toast of Milan ‚Äîassisted by the visits. They come to consider her \\"our duchess\\" but she does win her husband's love. Isabella visits and envies her sister for \\"the intellectuals, the gifted, the skilled craftsmen; the very elements who were drawn naturally to Beatrice.\\"Mrs. Gioconda, p.80 Beatrice grows into a political role and becomes a collector of clothing, jewels, etc., and no longer a companion to Salai. She does confide disappointment in the massive Leonardo's horse, conveys insight regarding the master's talent, and admonishes Salai to take some responsibility for that. To achieve great art, Leonardo needs \\"something wild, something irresponsible in his work\\", and Salai must help. The merchant Gioconda and his wife appear only in the last of nineteen chapters, visiting the studio during the master's absence. Beatrice has approved Leonardo's The Last Supper and died in childbirth. Milan has been conquered by the French and Leonardo has moved to Mantua. Duchess Isabella of Mantua (sister of Beatrice) has been frustrated for years seeking her portrait by Leonardo, which delights Salai. \\"Sooner or later she would come to realize that here was one prize that was just out of reach of her jeweled pink fingers.\\"Mrs. Gioconda, p. 133.Spurred by Beatrice and Isabella, the irresponsible Salai determines to persuade Leonardo to paint Lisa.Mrs. Gioconda, pp. 136‚Äì138. Origins Konigsburg once held a \\"grudge\\" against da Vinci. She came to admire him as both an artist and a person after reading Jacob Bronowski's essay on the painter in The Horizon Book of the Renaissance. She was intrigued by Bronowski's observation that Leonardo was insecure. Awards The American Library Association named The Second Mrs. Gioconda a Best Book of the Year for Young Adults for 1975.

It is a remake of Maskerade (1934). Plot Set somewhere in Vienna in the 1900s (decade), the film opens with a successful surgeon (Morgan), feeing for the affection of his wife (Bruce). As does his brother, a concert conductor (Owen), for his flirtatious gal (Christians). Both women have something in common: they are in love with a philandering painter (Powell). The surgeon's wife contacts the artist and allows herself to be painted while only dressed in furs, with her face covered by a mask. The painting headlines the newspapers, and the entire city wonders who the mysterious masked lady is. The surgeon recognizes his brother's fiancee's furs in the painting, and is troubled. He is unaware that his own wife has borrowed the fur, though, and feels terribly sorry for his brother. Together, the brothers decide to confront the artist, but he denies having met either of the men's wife. When the brothers challenge him to a duel if he does not tell them the name of the woman who posed for him, the artist randomly picks the name \\"Major\\". In the phone book, it turns out that one lady in Vienna is named Major: Leopoldine (Rainer). She is the companion of a socially prominent countess, and is startled by the claim that she was the model. The painter falls in love with her, but the prior affair with a married woman causes complications.

When she dropped out, Louis B. Mayer finally agreed to give Luise Rainer a chance. He had previously discovered her in Germany, though had not assigned her in her American debut yet. By the time she was cast, half of the film was already shot.\\"How Hollywood 'Discovered' Its Latest Foreign Star\\" by Dan Thomas, Laredo Morning Times, November 17, 1935 p. 13 During the film's first preview, Rainer ran out of the cinema and later said about the event: \\"On the screen, I looked so big and full of face, it was awful.\\"\\"Lady Puck Stirs a Tempest in Filmland\\" by Edith Dietz, The Oakland Tribune, August 25, 1935, p. 32 Reception Rainer received rave reviews for her performance. In The Family Circle magazine's August 1935 edition, the following was written of her: \\"There is no need to tell you about any of the players except Miss Rainer. You are already aware that there is no man on the screen who can top Mr. Powell when it comes to playing the role of a fascinating philanderer. Nor can a word from this observer add anything to the reputations of such artists as Mr. Morgan and Mr. Owen. If either of them ever gave a bad performance, I missed the film. But about Miss Rainer: [..] Her great charm is her simplicity and directness. Because of her wide-eyed facial expressions, the manner in which she pronounces some words, plus certain tricks of inflection in reading lines, Miss Rainer will be accused of imitating Elisabeth Bergner. [..] Miss Rainer can get her laughs, as she proves in that delightful bit in the cafe when she becomes a bit tight and tells Mr. Powell that she does not expect him to take her out again. Great stuff. And in a couple of weeping scenes she demonstrates that she is a first class chest-heaver and hysterics-thrower.\\"The Family Circle magazine - August 1935 Following the film's release, Rainer was hailed as 'Hollywood's next sensation' and had to do several interviews.\\"Luise Rainer, Quick On English, Doesn't Talk Hollywood Language\\", La Crosse Tribune, July 12, 1935, p. 2 By late 1935, with Escapade being her only credit, Rainer was the talk of the town and even got a spread in Photoplay magazine.\\"Know Luise Rainer\\" by Kirtley Baskette, Photoplay, October 1935 Box office According to MGM records the film earned $577,000 in the US and Canada and $398,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $143,000.

After digging up the concrete they found the murder weapons - the pitchfork, knives and axes which were used by the militants to kill the soldiers. After examining the weapons, an investigation led the Israeli security forces to the killers themselves. The killers, recruited by the Islamic Jihad militant organization, were convicted and sentenced to three consecutive terms of life imprisonment.

It can be found in the lower half of the South Island, from the Otago and Canterbury region. S. australis was described in 1897 by Frederick Hutton. Like all of New Zealand sub-alpine and alpine grasshoppers S. australis has a 2 or 3 years life cycle. The eggs must ‚Äòoverwinter‚Äô before they will hatch. Hoppers are found throughout the year, and adult grasshoppers can be found throughout the New Zealand summer between December and April. The adult S. australis do not overwinter. The genus Sigaus is endemic to New Zealand. Distribution and habitat A overview of the S. australis habitat. Mount Armstrong Sigaus australis can be found in the lower half of the South Island, from Otago and Canterbury regions. It can be found as far south as the Kawarau River () and as far north as the Torless Range (). Sigaus australis prefer tussock grasslands between in altitude, however, can be found as low as on the Alexandra Tailings, () and as high as on Smite Peak (). Species description The wings on S. australis are micropterous (small wings) between making this species flightless like most of New Zealand grasshoppers. Sigaus australis is highly cryptic, there is no polymorphism within this species. They will match the surrounding vegetation with colours of earth tones.

Early life, education, and career The son of a Chinese immigrant family, Mah was born in Bashaw, Alberta in 1926. English was his native language and he did not speak Mandarin, but he was able to write his Chinese name. He earned an arts degree from the University of Alberta in 1952, a physical education degree from McMaster University in 1960, a bachelor of education from the University of Toronto in 1962, and a masters degree in education from the University of Toronto around 1970. Mah taught in Ontario from 1955 to 1970. From 1970 to 1988, he also established and taught exercise and cardiac rehabilitation classes at the University of Toledo where he was a physical education instructor. Mah joined the Chinese Association of Greater Toledo in 1970 and later served as its program director. Running Mah, described as \\"an ordinary runner of ordinary speed\\", did not begin running marathons until he was 40. He reportedly took up the sport to prevent heart disease that ran in his family. In 1964, he formed the Metro Toronto Fitness Club with three others, and later started the North York Track Club where he coached Maureen Wilton. That club was considered one of the best in North America and Wilton was one of its star athletes. Mah and the 13-year-old Wilton both ran their debut marathons on May 6, 1967 at York University in Toronto, Ontario. Wilton ran the first three laps of the five lap course with Mah and she went on to finish in a time of 3:15:23, a performance recognized as a world best by the International Association of Athletics Federations. Invited by Mah, Kathrine Switzer also ran that day ‚Äì only sixteen days after her historic run at the Boston Marathon. Mah ran the Glass City Marathon in Toledo, Ohio numerous times, his first at the inaugural event in 1971. By 1977, he completed his 100th marathon there with a 3:18:18 performance. Three years at the same race, his tenth on the Glass City course, Mah posted his 173rd. In 1981, Mah ran his 198th marathon to break the record for most marathons set by Ted Corbitt. When possible, race directors would issue bib numbers to match his marathon total. He would later run his 300th in Detroit (1983), his 400th in Virginia (1986), and his 500th in Boston (1988). The 1984 New York City Marathon was Mah's 348th marathon and 35th of the year. At least one race director scheduled back-to-back marathons on Saturday and Sunday to help him add to his totals. Mah ran the Boston Marathon twenty times and was a regular participant in ultramarathons and triathlons as well as cross country skiing and canoe races. In recognition of his role in promoting the sport of distance running, he was invited to participate in the 152-mile Spartathlon in Greece. Although he did not finish the event, he was publicly honored by the Greeks for \\"his love of competition\\". Mah's personal best over the marathon distance was 3:13, however, he felt he could go faster if determined to do so. Hal Higdon commented that he believed Mah was capable of running a marathon under three hours if he trained for a specific race. Mah's last race was a 50 kilometer event Labour Day weekend, 1988, in St. Jacobs, Ontario; he dropped out of the Toronto Marathon three weeks later. Mah's record would last until 1994 when broken by Norm Frank of Rochester, New York. Death and legacy Following a lingering bout of hepatitis, Mah died of leukemia at the St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center in Toledo, Ohio in 1988. Following his death, he was a subject of a case report that appeared in the May 1991 issue of the medical journal Chest. According to that report, Mah received a cardiac stress test nine months prior to his death which found \\"ischemia with disseminated circadian variation suggesting possible [coronary vasospasm] without angina.\\" Autopsy revealed localized fibrosis of the left papillary muscles, but no evidence of coronary atherosclerosis. Mah has been described as \\"an early leader of the modern running boom\\". Joe Henderson wrote an editorial in tribute to Mah in 1989. According to Henderson, Mah stated: \\"I believe Americans have been brainwashed with the idea that they must do less because increased age will result in less energy and diminished capacity. I have found this is simply not true if a person does not allow his mind to accept the traditional view of aging.\\" Along with Dick Beardsley, Herb Lorenz, and Harold Tinsley, Mah was a 1989 inductee of the Road Runners Club of America's Hall of Fame. The Sy Mah Memorial Scholarship at the University of Toledo was established in 1990 by Mah's friend and family. In addition to meeting various academic standards, qualified recipients within the College of Health Science and Human Service are required to be \\"avid social runners\\". A portion of the proceeds from the annual Glass City Marathon go to fund this award. Participants in that race pass by a life-size statue of Mah that was dedicated September 13, 2002 in Olander Park in Sylvania, Ohio. The statue was created by Thomas Lingeman, a Professor of Art at the University of Toledo, who was commissioned by the Toledo Road Runners Club. At the annual Sri Chinmoy 24-Hour Race in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, the Sy Mah Award is given to the runner who completes at least 100 miles and runs the most even 50-mile splits. The wood-carved trophy is shaped to resemble an hourglass symbolizing Mah's \\"balance and steadiness\\". Mah's papers are held at the Ward M. Canaday Center at the University of Toledo.

French royal forces commanded by Capetian king Louis VIII laid siege to the strategic port of La Rochelle and its garrison of Poitevin and English soldiers commanded by Savari de Maul√©on. The port had long been a staging ground for Plantagenet efforts to regain their continental lands lost to the French crown since 1203. The siege lasted from July to August 1224, and resulted in La Rochelle's citizens surrendering the city to Louis after the failure of English relief to emerge. The siege of La Rochelle was the crowning event of the Capetian conquest of Poitou from the Plantagenets.The minority of Henry III David Carpenter pp.370-3 With Poitou in Capetian hands, only Gascony remained under Plantagenet rule on the continent. Background The city of La Rochelle came under Plantagenet rule with the rest of Aquitaine in 1152, when Eleanor of Aquitaine married Henry Plantagenet, the duke of Anjou and Normandy. Two years later, Henry had become king of England as Henry II; his lands, since labelled as the Angevin Empire and comprising much of western France, the kingdom of England and portions of Ireland, were passed on largely intact to his sons Richard I and John. In 1202, 1204 and 1207, John awarded tax privileges to La Rochelle, such as exempting the city from certain taxes, as well as from certain military obligations, and allowing it to tax anybody entering or leaving it. The Capetians had been in frequent conflict with the Plantagenets since 1203, when Philip II declared John's continental lands forfeit over his marriage to Isabella of Angoul√™me. The French crown's conquest of Normandy, Anjou and parts of Aquitaine was followed by Philip's decisive victory at Bouvines in 1214 and the young Prince Louis' invasion of England during the First Barons' War of 1216‚Äì1217. By 1224, John's son and successor to the English throne Henry III was embroiled in internal war, successfully leading the Siege of Bedford in 1224. Henry was, however, financially strained and had considerably less resources than his French counterpart to successfully resist an attack on his remaining northern Aquitanian strongholds. Campaign and siege Four days after the conclusion of the siege of Bedford, Louis VIII gathered his army at Tours, before moving to Montreuil-Bellay. Striking south, Louis quickly secured the smaller Poitevin towns, taking Niort on 5 July after a two-day confrontation with a garrison under the command of Savari de Maul√©on. Savari's garrison managed to retreat to La Rochelle. After receiving the surrender of Saint-Jean-d'Ang√©ly, Louis finally laid siege to La Rochelle on 15 July. Defence of the city was commanded by Savari, whose forces were bolstered by a contingent of English troops under Geoffrey de Neuville that had arrived in June. The siege as imagined by Emile Couneau, 1904 The exact nature of the end of the siege is ambiguous, though according to the chronicle of St. Martin of Tours, the city was surrendered on 3 August and French troops entered La Rochelle soon after. However, the burgesses of the city did not swear fealty to Louis until 13 August. Ralph of Coggeshall described the capitulation as a conditional surrender by the citizens, seemingly upon the realisation that only minimal support would be received from the English crown due to distractions from the aftermath of Bedford. The citizens had previously decided to surrender if English relief did not arrive by Christmas, but with French troops already in the city they accelerated their submission to Louis. Geoffrey's English force took no part in the surrender of the city; Louis allowed them to leave in peace with their arms. On the other hand, Savari's reputation amongst the English was tarnished by accusations of treachery; his efforts to try to explain the fall of La Rochelle to Henry having failed, Savari entered Louis' service by Christmas 1224. David Carpenter credits the fall of La Rochelle to the citizens, who \\"like those of the other towns, had simply lost the will to fight for the Angevin cause\\". Consequences Following the 1224 siege, Louis VIII committed to maintain all the privileges of the city.History of the rise of the Huguenots of France Henry Martyn Baird p.270 Trade was encouraged by giving a safe conduct for all goods from or to the city, although usual taxes were applied. In case of a declaration of war between France and the country of a trader, that trader's goods were protected from being seized for a period of 20 days, during which the trader could leave the city with his goods unharmed.Reformation in La Rochelle: tradition and change in early modern Europe by Judith Chandler Pugh Meyer p.24ff The absorption of La Rochelle into the French royal demesne compromised the close trading relations the city had enjoyed with England and Ireland, especially in the export of wine. La Rochelle wine had been recorded in England since the end of the 12th century, and numerous English and Irish traders had been present in the city. The city compensated this loss by increased trade with the northern countries of Flanders. Until Bordeaux became the prominent harbour for wine, La Rochelle was the leading wine exporter on the Atlantic coast during the 13th and the 14th century. In exchange for the wine, cereals and cloth were imported from the Flanders, while tin was imported from Cornwall, and lead from Ireland.

Michael Curran to take charge. Curran had been a missionary in the mountains of Pennsylvania and had come highly recommended by Father Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin. His knowledge of Gaelic served him well among his widely scattered parishioners. The cornerstone of St. Paul's church was set June 29, 1835.

Characters  = Main characters = ; / * : The team leader, an expert marksman and artist whose usually erratic personality is replaced with a brilliant deductive mindset by ceremonially donning goggles in a process called 'Concentrate'‚Äîthis allows him to make eerily accurate inferences by concentrating entirely on absolutely all the available evidence, to the extent of accurately recalling background noise. He enjoys the sense of adventure he receives from helping others for its own sake, but can become very emotionally involved with more serious cases to the extent of verbally abusing those he sees to be betraying their friends. Despite Bossun's deceptively sharp acumen, he is notably socially awkward around attractive women. He frequently breaks the Fourth Wall; he also vocally guards his position as the protagonist of the series when sidelined. However, when he won the Character Popularity contest (which had a whole chapter based around it), he was extremely humble about it. : On his fifteenth birthday, he discovered that he was not related to his mother, Akane, and his sister, Rumi. His actual parents were Akane's best friends, Ryousuke and Haru. When Bossun was about to be born, his parents died in two separate accidents. His father died while saving a child, and his mother died from giving birth. He ran away from home and wandered around aimlessly. After meeting Taisuke Mishima, the child who his father had saved, Bossun received the present that Ryousuke had meant to give to Haru after the birth. Bossun read the letters, saying about how he should help other people. However, in anger, he flung down the letters and claimed that he would only live for himself. After watching a student his age be bullied (it was actually Tsubaki, but he had longer hair and glasses then, so they didn't recognize each other after they met again), he discovered that he had truly inherited his parents' blood because he couldn't resist helping other people. He, later on, returned to Akane and Rumi, and continued to live with them. Bossun continued to believe that he was alone in the world, before the doctor who had helped deliver him came to him on his 17th birthday and told him that he had a younger twin brother. As a result, he realized that his brother was actually Tsubaki Sasuke from the Student Council. Bossun felt deep down that he had already known because everybody kept saying that they were similar. Despite knowing that they were brothers, both Tsubaki and Bossun continue to have an awkward rivalry with each other, often breaking into fights, but slowly getting closer, as brothers should. He also has inherited some behavior from Akane having shown that whenever she yells at Bossun at some point she would end up saying \\"dummy\\" repeatedly. He has shown a great assortment of talents, such as being able to draw as well as a manga artist, able to make origami be extremely lifelike, and being excellent at riddles, the second-best in the school. He is the older twin of Tsubaki, he is slightly lazier and childish than him, but he can be mature when in a serious case, also he is more creative than Tsubaki. In the last chapter of the manga, he graduated from Kaimei High School and Himeko revealed her true feelings for him. He is last seen living in the United States helping two children crying near a road. ; / / * : The \\"Amazon\\"- a dangerous close-range fighter who serves as the Sket Dan's muscle using her hockey stick. Already a formidable fighter without it, with this weapon she is capable of defeating multiple opponents instantaneously. In the past, Himeko, was just a tomboy from Osaka. When her family moved to Tokyo, she found it hard to find friends, even on the Hockey team. This changed when Arisa Kanou (referred to as Aa-chan), a member of the team started befriending her. One day, Himeko saw her friend Aa-chan threatened by the school's delinquents, the rest of her friends told her to ignore it, but Himeko refused and went to protect her. The delinquents got into a fight, in which Himeko was losing but did not give in stating she would protect her friend. But the delinquent simply mocked her, stating Aa-chan was not threatened at all and that in fact, she was the leader of the gang. This shocking fact along with Aa-chan cursing at her, made Himeko go wild and she grabbed a hockey stick and beat everyone. Aa-chan spread rumors that she was an ogress, and Himeko was slowly isolated from the school, while other delinquents came to fight her, all of whom she defeated. She gained the nickname \\"Legendary Yankee Onihime\\", which quickly became a symbol of \\"power and fear\\". Eventually tired of this life she transferred to another school at a distance from her house which was the one Bossun attended. She spent her days isolated, due to her experiences with Aa-chan, deciding to never have friends. But Bossun, and the class representative, Takahashi Chiaki attempted to correct this behavior by attempting to be her friend. When Chiaki gets into trouble, with some delinquents, she is reluctant to help Chiaki, due to her past experiences. Bossun scolds her at this, that despite her experiences she should not be so unwilling to trust people and that he would never betray a friend. Hearing this she quickly went to beat up the delinquents threatening Chiaki, but not before being saved by Bossun. She then, reveals her nickname, but to her surprise neither Bossun nor Chiaki are frightened. She states that she has hurt too many people, but Bossun states her strength is not something to be ashamed, but proud of, and asks her to be part of Sket-dan. Recently, memories of an unknown boy in a school uniform have prevented her from fully enacting these violent impulses Himeko feels that she is saved from Bossun and becomes loyal to him despite their constant bickering. Obsessed with bizarre flavors of lollipop such as 'Mackerel-Miso' which can almost kill anyone without a powerful \\"fighting spirit\\" who tries eating them, she almost constantly has one sticking out of her mouth, which is frequently mistaken for a habit of smoking from a distance. Despite her weird sense of taste, she is also very good at cooking. She holds great faith in Bossun, as she, like Switch is willing to do anything Bossun says, and has shown feelings for Bossun, as shown by her jealousy when he went on a group date and being embarrassed, when on a fake date with him, In 'Himekoi' chapter it is fully seen that she does have a crush on Bossun and nearly confessing it but fail (just like in the last chapter of 'Trouble travel'). She has a great love for cute things, as seen when she acted motherly for Bossun when he was a child due to Mr. Ch≈´ma's youth potion, even fainting from how cute Bossun was. She has shown great interest to have Bossun and Tsubaki improve their brotherly relationship, which she shares with Switch, and the Student Council, with the exception of Tsubaki. In the last chapter, she graduated and finally made her true feelings to Bossun known, but without receiving any clear reciprocation from him on her confession. She is last seen as an adult with slightly longer hair. ; / * : The 'brains' of the team (in contrast to Bossun's intuition and Himeko's brawn) in charge of intelligence-gathering and, in contrast to the more excitable other Sket Dan members, largely concerned with \\"honest, data- substantiated fact\\". He originally was very different from his current self, his huge change is due to the death of his little brother, which he blames himself for. Originally, he was far more normal, but had an inferiority complex about his little brother Switch, who had talents that far surpassed his, despite being very proud of him. This complex was further emphasized when their childhood friend Sawa acted like she was more interested in his little brother, when in reality they had mutual feelings. When Sawa was being stalked, he originally was going to protect her, but felt useless in front of his younger brother and let him take his place. He went for a walk and met a friend of Sawa and told her Sawa was going out with Switch. Then he spotted the stalker, but found out that he was only an admirer. Kazuyoshi realized that Sawa's friend was the true culprit who planned to hurt Sawa. By the time he arrived, his little brother had been murdered after protecting Sawa. After his brother's death, he takes on his appearance and name because he feels responsible for his death, and stops speaking shortly after until Bossun comes to his aid. Kazuyoshi never speaks aloud (his trauma causing a severe form of selective mutism) and instead uses his laptop to communicate using the \\"Speech Synthesis Software\\" his brother developed to communicate in between constant bouts of forum trolling and dating-simulation play throughs. Switch is the proprietor of a vast school-wide intelligence network consisting largely of perverts and outcasts, and thus in possession of almost unlimited information on everyone in the vicinity of the school; the ensuing potential for blackmail makes him a bad person to cross. Surprisingly popular with the ladies, he expresses interest in very little outside of his Sket Dan duties - except, curiously, for frequent 'Science vs. the Supernatural' debates with occult fanatic Yuuki Reiko which seem to be sparked by mutual attraction. Beyond computer skills, Switch has shown frequent and unexplained access to high-tech gear such as computerized training equipment and minute homing devices. He hates Otaku, despite being one. He is completely loyal to Bossun: as he states, they feel indebted to Bossun for his guidance, and wants to be useful to him. In the last chapter, he delivers the graduation speech on behalf of his graduating class ‚Äì coming to terms with his past by finally letting go off his laptop and speaking in public with his actual voice again. He is last seen as an adult, highly implied to be dating Momoka. = Student council members = The rivals of the Sket-dan, who uphold school rules and handle administrative duties, like the creation and funding of clubs. Within the Sket Dance world, there is a manga series about them, running in Sh≈çnen Jump, and a tie-in game on Vivage City, a cellular phone game company. ; * : President of the Student Council and a third-year student. He later steps down from president when he graduated and passes the torch to Tsubaki (as of chapter 147-148). A very cool, charismatic, laid-back individual, who seemingly does nothing as President. He entrusts most responsibilities to the Vice President, Sasuke Tsubaki. He is well-known for his intelligence. His IQ is around 160. Due to his high IQ, he is the best at riddles in school. His ability to read and understand people is used to manipulate them to do what he wants, such as motivating Bossun into competing with him seriously. This same ability is why he has the complete loyalty of Student Council members, Sasuke and Daisy. His performance in the Gachinko Vivage Battle's \\"Pixie Garden\\" match with Bossun shows that he is a good strategist, who learns quickly, and is adept at lying, being regarded as the antagonist comic of the manga / series Sket Dance. Despite his ruthlessness, and professions that he is very cunning, he's against cheating to win. He has a tendency to forget things he's said, such as the bet he pretended to make with Bossun to get him fired up. He is very lazy, known to sleep in the counsel's classroom. He is very protective of his sister and will become enraged if any guy gets close to her, which is shown in his misunderstanding of her relationship with Tsubaki. He has a unique laughter \\"kakaka\\". ; * (drama CD), Hiro Shimono (anime) : The Vice President of the Student Council, who takes his responsibilities very seriously, even overzealously, willing to punch a hole in a wall and injure himself to get his point across. Later becomes President after Agata graduated (chapter 147/148). He believes that the Sket-dan is useless and should be abolished, leading to conflicts with Bossun. The two consider each other rivals and his desire to defeat Bossun and the Sket-dan motivate him to do things he wouldn't otherwise do. He is a skilled fighter, and the boxing club at their school wanted him on their team. He often blushes when he feels shy. He also researches his opponents' weaknesses and uses them to his advantage. He is very similar to Bossun, as many other people had noted. He can be as excellent as Bossun when it comes to solving riddles as the two have obtained similar answer for the last question during the quiz battle between Student Council and Quiz Club. It was later revealed that Tsubaki and Bossun are twin brothers, separated from birth. After the discovery, Tsubaki and Bossun's relationship became even more awkward, but they slowly began to grow closer, with Bossun even inviting Tsubaki over for dinner to meet Akane and Rumi. Akane noted that while Bossun looked more like his father, Ryousuke, Tsubaki looked more like his mother, Haru. He is the younger twin of Bossun, also he is slightly diligent and maturer than him, but can be childish sometimes, often when both of them are fighting, but he lacks creativity, unlike Bossun who is more creative than him. In the last chapter, he graduated. He is last seen studying at a doctor college while wearing the Sket Dance logo T-Shirt. ; * (drama CD), Megumi Takamoto (anime) : The Treasurer of the Student Council. Later become Vice- President after Tsubaki became president. She's a very gentle girl and the wealthy granddaughter of the Unyuu Group's leader. She is competent enough to know how to allocate hidden funds for the Student Council, but this is countered by her desire to spend frivolously. She believes money is a means to all ends, from love confessions to winning competitions. Despite this, she considers herself an advocate of proper conduct, and even lectures Tsubaki for his uncivilized actions. Outside of her financial duties, she provides refreshments and first aid supplies to the other Student Council members. ; * (drama CD), Yu Kobayashi (anime) : The Secretary of the Student Council, nicknamed \\"Daisy-chan.\\" She is a Second-year student Sket Dance, who will do whatever S≈çjir≈ç tells her to do, from participating in the Gachinko Vivage Battle Tournament to going undercover on a Student Council Operation to catch a ring of blackmailers. She speaks harshly, and insults people on purpose, often saying things like \\"Drown in a gutter and die\\", or \\"Drown, die, revive, and die again.\\" She has good aim, and relentlessly attacks without hesitation. While she seems calm and composed on the outside, she is quick to judge others, and thus, underestimate them. She doesn't handle failure very well, and will console herself by cuddling stuffed animals. She especially dislikes bothering other people, so she rarely asks for help. ; * (drama CD), Kenji Nojima (anime) : A Student Council Member responsible for General Affairs, and a Third-year Student. Later graduates. He is a narcissist, who loves having his picture taken. He is popular with girls, and also has a very devoted fan club called the \\"Shinbals\\". He is an extremely good chef, considered \\"exceptional even among professionals.\\" Michiru often plays the straight man opposite the quirks of the other student council and is also one of the few people who understands that S≈çjir≈ç has a manipulative side. He has been together with Agata since middle school and knows him very well among others. ; * (anime) : The new General Affairs Manager after Shinba graduates. First appeared in chapter 152, he is said to be a decedent from ninjas. He has a strong sense of justice and makes excuses because he doesn't want people to know that he is a ninja. He purposely let himself get hit by a ball to hide his abilities. He later helped Sket-Dan catch Kagerou, a thief pretending to be a ninja. His goal is to make the school his. Originally not listening to Tsubaki, and even considering him unfit to be president, he did things his own way due to an incident back in middle school where he lost faith in relying on others. After Tsubaki stood up for him and promised not to abandon him, he has become fiercely protective of him and more willing to work with others. His and Tsubaki's relationship is often juxtaposed with that Himeko and Bossun's, being the loyalty they feel towards their respected leaders. ; * (anime) : The new Treasurer as of chapter 153. She does not like men since she grew up in an all-women environment all her life. An example of this would be that she wants to expel all the male students. She won't even talk to them and has a snobby princess attitude. When she is touched by men, she turns into her alter ego, Bunny. Bunny is the polar opposite of her counterpart, Hani. She hates women and has a lust for men, even becoming more erotic and seductive towards them. When she is touched by women, however, she turns back into Hani. = Teachers = ; * (drama CD), Jouji Nakata (anime) : The little-seen and inhumanly apathetic \\"Club Supervisor\\" of the Sket Dan spends most of his time in his lab instead of minding them, where his only gift seems to be for creating dangerous and unstable explosive devices. Despite this, he has created potions of science fiction effect, such as a youth potion and potions able to change a person's personality. As his token support is prerequisite to Sket Dan's existence, he holds the threat of its withdrawal over the members' heads when he wishes to coerce them into some unreasonable 'favour'. He is often referred to as \\"Chu-san\\". He has a daughter named Suzu. ; * : Remi is often referred to as \\"Onee-san\\". She took over as teacher's assistant after the previous one went on maternity leave. She is very scatter brained and clumsy but very happy and energetic as she was formerly a host of the educational children's show \\"Can Mommy Come Too?\\". She fell in love with Chu-san. ; * : An eccentric geography teacher who hires the Sket Dan to help him form a 'Genesis' club ('Genesis' being the name of a ball game taught to him by 'Master Won' similar to tennis, but involving a volleyball, and fishing nets), the idea was receded when Tsubaki explained that if the three were to start the 'Genesis' club, the Sket Dan would be disbanded. Later, Yamanobe taught them 'Hyperion', a part- chess part-DND board game which only male players seem to enjoy. He also introduced a crappy Super Mario game parody. = Other characters = ; * :Chiaki Takahashi first appeared in chapter 5 of the manga and episode 3 of the anime. She is usually addressed as \\"Captain\\" as she is the captain of Kaimei High School's softball team. She was Himeko's first friend - it was her that made Himeko accept friends again. She had done this by persuading Himeko, everyday, into being her friend. She also befriended Bossun in the process. She lost her mother at a young age. Thus, she grew up with much more responsibility than others, even to the point of wanting to take care of her younger brother while she's busy with school. She is well known for being responsible, proven with the fact that she, other than the softball club's captain, is also class representative. She is also kind and caring but can be a bit clumsy at times. She also has this certain charisma that affects a lot of people around her, making them become much more passionate in what they are currently doing. She has been considered cute and attractive quite a few times. Something else that is notable about her is her love for eating, which she has taken up to the extreme now that she \\"can eat faster than the speed of sound\\". ; * :Roman Saotome first appeared in chapter 7 of the manga and episode 4 of the anime. She is in the same grade as Bossun, Himeko, and Switch. She has a crush on Bossun and calls him \\"Prince\\", although it isn't much of a developed crush and more of a schoolgirl crush. She has a special ability, the Otome Filter, which makes everything look the way she wants it to. Ranging from seeing a guy more handsome (ex. the guy from the Gachinko Vivage Battle in episode 11) to seeing a purple towel turn into a puppy (ex. Bossun holding a Pellolipop towel in episode 4). Her Otome Filter can also manifest so others can see it as well, causing others to think they're dreaming. She loves Sh≈çjo manga and wants to be a manga artist when she grows up, but she doesn't seem to draw well. She often acts as if she's from a clich√©d shojo manga and often narrates her own life. ; * :Reiko first appears in chapter 3 of the manga and episode 5 of the anime. She has a ghost-like appearance making many people believe she actually is a ghost. She has bags under her eyes and a bent back and usually a dark black aura. She strongly believes in the occult and has a friendly rivalry with Switch who doesn't believe in the occult due to his strong belief in science. Although she is shown to have no interest in fashion, it is proven by Switch that with a makeover, Reiko can look pretty. (Episode 21) ; * :Shinzo first appears in chapter 4 of the manga and episode 2 of the anime. He is the captain of the kendo club at Kaimei. He relies on his mints to wake himself up and bring himself to full potential before a match and is trying hard not to do that. He claims to want to be a samurai but a running gag through the story is that Shinzo will do things that make him un-samurai-like (ex. playing on his cellphone). He is often shown wearing samurai clothing and having his hair tied up. Since his father is an actor, he is also caught speaking in play-like language. ; * :Yabasawa is a rather large girl but has great confidence in herself-especially in her looks. She has a \\"3\\" shaped mouth - and this mouth shape is the reason the sket team entered into a contest with the student council, for a \\"3\\" shaped mouth for her avatar on her phone. She is a member of the school's cheerleading squad and has been noted to have a good singing voice. The word \\"yabas\\" (the first part of her name) is used extensively throughout her conversations, she often finishes sentences with it, she uses it as a single word statement to express surprise and substitutes it for other words \\"that's so totally yabas\\" / compounds it with other words \\"yabastactic\\". She has a perverted pet monkey called Yeti who wears a yellow backpack. The monkey often causes mischief by doing odd stuff to girls. ; * :Saaya first appears in chapter 128 of the manga and in the end of episode 51 of the anime. She is the sister of Student Council former president Sojiro Agata. She is a twin tailed tsundere girl and seems quite snobbish towards males because of this character trait. Chiaki advises her to visit the Sket Dance club room where she ends up befriending all of the members and soon develops a crush on Bossun. She also forces Bossun, Himeko,and Switch to adopt the owl she finds in the Park which they name Hosuke. Initially they find it troublesome to take care of him but soon realise that it's actually very easy and that he is intelligent in his own way. Her brother is extremely protective of her, and gets angry if boys so much as touch her. He misconcludes that Saaya and Tsubaki have a crush on each other and the more Saaya and the others try to clear this, the more complicated the love diagram in his head becomes, which is a running gag after her appearance. In the end, she graduates and is last seen going to college with a little hairstyle change.

It is also notable that Hinduism largely followed an oral tradition to pass on knowledge, for which there is no record of historical dates; hence, the below dates are to be considered as to when written records of these texts were found, and not necessarily when they originated. ;Samhita, Brahmana layers of the Vedas *Rigveda, 1800 ‚Äì 1100 BCEOberlies, Thomas (Die Religion des Rgveda, Wien, 1998, p. 155) gives an estimate of 1100 BCE for the youngest hymns in book 10.

Characters =Seirin High= Seirin High's basketball team was founded only the year before the manga; despite this setbacks and only including freshmen, the team made it all the way to the final league in that year's Inter-High school tournament. This year, the team's notable newcomers include Tetsuya Kuroko, the main character of the manga, as well as Taiga Kagami. ; :, Ami Koshimizu (VOMIC) : He is the \\"phantom\\" sixth man of the (Teiko Middle School's basketball team). Kuroko is Seirin's secret weapon. Although he was an essential member of his middle school basketball team, unlike his former teammates, Kuroko is largely unknown. This is because he is so small, frail, unnoticeable, distressingly slow, and easy to miss. However, he is greatly respected by everyone. Kuroko capitalizes in the skill of misdirection, using himself as a relay to redirect his teammates' passes to another free player and make virtually unstoppable steals, getting the ball to and between his teammates faster than opponents can react, while at the same time remaining \\"invisible\\" to his opponents. His near-invisibility makes him highly susceptible to on-court injuries however, and is not effective indefinitely. If he is left in play too long, opponents grow used to his misdirection tactics; as such, he must be placed on the bench at varying points in any match to prevent this. He mostly plays the position of a small forward based on defensive matchups and substitution strategies, but in recent chapters of the manga his position is listed as a questionmark. This is because Kuroko is difficult to place in one of the five basketball positions, his role in the team applies to none of those, but mostly as a pass-first point guard based on size and passing abilities but his dribbling and playcalling ability is not as advanced or polished as an average point guard. As revealed by Aomine and later in the Teiko arc, Akashi was the one who taught Kuroko his playing style. Also, his misdirection is inspired from the book \\"Techniques in Guiding Lines of Sight\\" and developed it due to his sharp observation skills. Because he has learned new skills like the \\"Phantom Shot\\" and the \\"Vanishing Drive\\", his lack of presence wears out, because these skills require to hold the ball and the crowd turns their attention on the one who holds it. This the reason why Akashi didn't teach him how to develop his basketball skills. During the second season of the anime series and the eleventh volume of the manga, he developed a new technique, called the \\"Vanishing Drive\\". Midorima explains the mechanics of the skill during Seirin's second match against Touou; the move itself is basically a cross- diagonal move (a duck-in) to where the opponent's eye field can't see. Kuroko bends over in a specific angle at drives following a specific route, that the opponent's eyes can't follow. Kazuya Hara of Kirisaki Dai Ichi has speculated that Kuroko uses blinking to bypass the defense, but this has been proven wrong. The real Vanishing Drive is a collaboration with Kagami. Similar to Kuroko's misdirection, Kagami draws the attention of the opponent to him, just for a second, and that makes it possible for Kuroko to pass his opponent successfully. This technique is effective enough to pass through the defenses of Midorima and Takao (who possesses the Hawk Eye). The only one so far who has beaten it, is Aomine. Because of the two's mutual understanding about basketball, closing his eyes (making Kagami's misdirection ineffective) and by following Kuroko's breath, Aomine was able to crush down the Vanishing Drive. During the game against T≈ç≈ç Academy, Kuroko performed his Ignite Pass Kai, a new, upgraded version of his Ignite Pass, which is a very powerful pass that pushes the ball at a blinding speed that it even flies past Aomine's hand when he tried to block it. Midorima stated that the Ignite Pass Kai is much like a bullet being fired out of a gun. Kuroko's special ability is the Misdirection Overflow, where when Kuroko's misdirection runs out on him, his teammates have the ability to do the Vanishing Drive. This technique is specially created to decrease the accuracy of shots. However, when this happens Kuroko is just a regular member on the court without any special talents. He also is helped by Aomine on his shooting skills, creating a shooting style that uses misdirection- the Phantom Shot. The essence of this technique is to use the palm of his hand to thrust the ball forward, although this will mess up the shooting posture. Furthermore, because of the strange shooting position, the ball looks lower than a usual shot. Instead of shooting above one's head, the Phantom Shot releases from the chest. The opponent naturally looks lower because of the ball's position, so his view is limited. By following a fast release, Kuroko can shoot the ball through the opponent's field of vision, like a floater with less arc, with the ball seemingly disappearing in thin air. Apart from his lack of presence, Kuroko acquired his own version of the Emperor Eye- the Quasi-Emperor Eye- that is different than Akashi's in the sense that Kuroko's Emperor Eye cannot predict the movements of his opponents (which Akashi's Emperor Eye can), but rather the teammates whom he is familiar with. However, due to his long-term observation of his teammates and the trust he built up with them, his Quasi-Emperor Eye can predict movements one step ahead of Akashi's. He also uses this to change his passing routes and his teammates passes if he sees the ball will be stolen. When Kagami reaches the Zone's 2nd gate, the gatekeeper is revealed to be none other than Kuroko himself. Kuroko respects but doesn't like Midorima because of his way of thinking; Midorima also has similar feelings toward Kuroko. Kuroko considers himself a \\"Shadow\\", whose goal is to help his \\"Light\\" achieve greatness. Kuroko calls Kagami \\"his Light\\". He also has a tendency to speak and act completely deadpan, and a running gag involves his teammates, thinking they are alone, talking to themselves only for Kuroko to answer them, apparently having been in the area long before they arrived. However, despite his initially kind personality, he gets extremely furious at the sight of dirty play, when his teammates are already injured by foul methods in the Kirisaki Daiichi game. His aura changes so drastically, even Kagami got scared when he saw him get angry. When he gets angry, it gets very hard to beat him, as he is filled up with fighting spirit. Also, when the situation worsens, he seems to turn talkative. ; :, Katsuyuki Konishi (VOMIC) : A naturally gifted basketball player, Kagami easily makes his way into Seirin's starting line-up as a freshman power forward. He has been said to be equal to the Generation of Miracles, even some of the Miracles themselves. Kise and Aomine described Kagami as someone in the Generation of Miracles who took a completely different path. When he first returned to Japan, he was disappointed by its relatively low level of basketball skill compared to that in the United States. However, since starting high school, Kagami has been spurred on by his desire to compete with the \\"Generation of Miracles\\". While he is a powerful all-around player, Kagami's unique skill is his ability to jump at impressive heights, his jump is said to get higher and higher as a match progresses. This skill facilitates not only his most common move, the dunk, but also allows him to defend well against taller players. At, he has a poor shooting which forces him to rely on his jumping power to dunk. But as time progresses, he trained his left hand and significantly improved this, enabling him to pass the ball to Kiyoshi at the last second against Touou and win. When he makes a jumpshot, he also stays in the air longer than the blocker, making it almost unblockable. The drawback to this capability is that his body is still underdeveloped thus he often injures himself. Having trained extensively since the InterHigh school championships, he is capable of dunking from the free- throw line: a feat that put him on the same league as the Generation of Miracles. The result of his training is that he is able to jump high enough to touch the top of the backboard. He is also able to jump from far away in a difficult position and still be able to block a shot. Facing Touou a second time, Kagami displayed a never-before-seen skill: a high-level tactical battle. This is a very realistic simulation of a basketball one-on-one in one's minds by reading his opponents subtle feints or moves. Kagami used this to play a simulation of a one-on-one against Aomine and accurately determined that he would lose, forcing him to pass the ball to Izuki and withdraw from his one-on-one against Aomine. Like many of the other developed characters, Kagami hosts a signature move. It is called Meteor Jam and was taught by the basketball coach he shared with Himuro in America, Alex Garcia. The technique possesses enough power to even penetrate through Murasakibara's defense, however, the wrinkle to this technique is that it requires massive jumping power to throw the ball into the hoop and thus can only be executed in the Zone. As Kuroko has chosen Kagami as his new \\"Light\\", Kagami is also bolstered by Kuroko's techniques. Kuroko is the one normally to calm Kagami down, normally with hits or punches to get Kagami focused. Like Aomine, he also has the rare power to enter the \\"zone\\". In this state, his speed, strength and jumping power are greatly augmented that he can keep up with Aomine, overpower Murasakibara who is stronger than him (even blocking his full-powered Thor's Hammer) and leap even higher to block Himuro's Mirage Shot. His shooting accuracy also improves, as evidenced by his three-pointer in his match against Yosen. Kagami's seemingly wild reflexes is compared to a tiger by other players. Apart from basketball, he is a great cook, and taught Riko how to cook curry when she came for his help. Additionally, he can also walk on his hands. He is also a glutton and is able to eat at least five times a normal meal. It is worth noting that Kagami is the only Zone user to have entered it more than once in a match and the only player to have opened the Zone's second gate, known as the \\"Direct Drive Zone\\", the Zone's true form. Schoolwork greatly contrasts Kagami's amazing skills in basketball : it is seen that his grades in every subject are atrocious, including English, even though he has lived in America. However, this changes after he uses Midorima's lucky pencil (which Kuroko gave him), he scores well on his exams (90th out of 308 students). ; :, Shinji Kawada (VOMIC) : Captain of the Seirin team, Hyuuga is a clutch shooter, his capabilities escalating immensely when the team is in a pinch. Along with Hyuuga's change in skill comes a change in personality; normally Hyuuga is a collected and calm individual, but when he isn't, he becomes heated and rude. This is called \\"clutch time\\" and happens primarily when the match intensifies but he has been seen acting like this outside of games. He is the best shooter on the team, regularly making three-point shots throughout the course of a game. Prior to the addition of Kuroko and Kagami, he was one of the centerpieces of the Seirin team's 'run and gun' play style, catching balls scooped by Kiyoshi near the net to shoot as three-pointers. He is also seen being able to shoot a three-pointer two meters from the three- point line. His special move is called \\"Barrier Jumper\\", in which he takes a quick jab step away from the opponent and successfully make a jumpshot. The downside of this technique is that, when used repeatedly, the defender starts to adjust to its timing. Near the end of the 4th quarter of the Seirin vs Rakuzan match, he manages to perfectly copy Mibuchi's \\"Earth Shot\\". Notably, he is the only player in the series so far to receive a technical foul (for excessive complaining) and out of all the players in Seirin, he has the highest shooting success rate. Also, prior to the four fouls he received in the finals against Rakuzan, he is also the only player who has almost never been seen subbed out once. This is most probably due to him being the captain and the only shooting guard in the team. He is very big on respect for the seniors. ; :, Takashi ≈åhara (VOMIC) : Acting as the team's \\"control tower\\", Izuki is always calm and collected. While he has no special physical abilities, he has the \\"Eagle Eye\\", a mental skill that helps him visualize the court from any point of view and make accurate blind passes. Izuki's special move is called Eagle Spear, in which he steals the ball from an opponent using his arm to knock it away in their blind spot. His Eagle Eye helps him in doing so, associated with his ability to think ahead before the opponent. His Eagle Eye has developed to the point that he can pass through Yosen High's Eagle Wall and predict Hayama's Lightning Dribble. However, his Eagle Eye has a blind spot unlike the Hawk Eye, which Mayuzumi takes advantage of. He loves puns, a running gag being that he makes them quite frequently much to the chagrin of his teammates. ; : , Atsushi Abe (VOMIC) : Considered a jack of all trades, master of none, Koganei is a fairly skilled all-rounder, having started playing basketball during his first year in high school. This is driven home when his coach denotes his special skill as 'being able to shoot from any point on the court, with a so-so accuracy rate'; a decidedly normal ability. He serves as the sixth man of Seirin's team, often coming off the bench for the other players, and has the most energetic personality out of all the players on the team. He is, however, quite intelligent, ranking in the top 20% of his class, though he does not excel in any particular subject. Players compare Koganei's seemingly wild reflexes to that of a feral cat. He is the only non-prodigal player to possess this skill, having acquired it from his experience in playing tennis. ; : Voiced by: Fumihiro Okabayashi (VOMIC) : A stalwart player, Mitobe is very quiet and reserved. Although he is never shown speaking (except for in VOMIC), Koganei seems to understand his gestures and expressions perfectly. A hard worker with excellent defensive skills, he is also an accomplished hook shooter. He lives in a small house with a very large family, and is tasked with making and serving breakfast. He was the team's starting center while Kiyoshi was injured. ; : Voiced by: G≈ç Inoue : While a regular member of the team in his first year, Tsuchida now sees little game- time due to the addition of Kuroko and Kagami. Good with rebounds, he is apparently not quite as skilled as the other regulars, but remains a key component of the old team's playing style. ; : : The progenitor of Seirin's basketball team and its former ace, Kiyoshi is the last of the original Seirin team members to be introduced, due to a hospitalization for a knee injury he received during a game. Rumored to be very capable, his preferred position is point guard, but since their team lacked any other player with the body size to play center, he offered to fill that hole. On Koganei's suggestion, he tried to play both, despite the inherent impossibility. With big hands that allow him to palm the ball with ease, Kiyoshi possesses impressive ball- handling skills for a center (he has been seen successfully shooting a three- pointer during their match against Yosen), and an uncanny sense of timing that allows him to make a move, observe his opponents' reaction, and then counter it in the last second, all in the blink of an eye. This ability is referred to as the Right of Postponement. Because of his large hands, he uses these for something entirely different: rebounding. Instead of jumping towards the ball with both hands, he has gained the ability to grab the ball with only one hand. This gives him the advantage of recovering the ball in the air quicker and with a longer extension. This technique is dubbed \\"Vice Claw\\" and it allows him to compete and beat taller players during rebounds. He has obtained this skill after strengthening his hand muscles by catching a big rock. He is renowned and respected by many players in the realm of high-school basketball, and is one of the few players to have held his own against the Generation of Miracles during their peak. While he is currently able to play, the knee injury he sustained during his freshman year was quite severe: formally speaking it required surgery, but the process would make him unable to play basketball for the rest of his high school career. He instead opted to rehabilitate without invasive procedures, though he would only be able to do so for one year at the most. Despite this setback, he vows to make the most of the time he has. Although Hyuuga thinks he is weird, he respects Kiyoshi greatly. Kiyoshi is the most optimistic of his teammates, often offering encouragement with a big smile. :Among high school basketball players, he is one of the , a group of five prodigal players, though overshadowed by the Generation of Miracles, of similarly great prowess and skill. It was recently discovered that the only ones who can mirror the growth of the Uncrowned Kings are Hyuga and Izuki. Known for his stabilizing presence and extreme unpredictability due to the Right of Postponement, Kiyoshi is known as the . ; , , :, , : The rest of Seirin's team, Furihata, Fukuda and Kawahara see extremely limited playing time due to the skill of their starters (only the former has ever played in a game) and are mostly found on the bench. However, Furihata played an important role in the second match with Kaijo. They play point guard, center and small forward respectively. ; :, Ayumi Fujimura (VOMIC) : Riko, the team's coach, is a second-year student. One reason for her unique position as a student coach is her ability to immediately scan and evaluate the physical capabilities of players at a glance. She gained this ability from going to work with her father, who works as a sports trainer, and spending her time looking at the muscles of athletes and their related data. She is very devoted to her job as coach, so she diligently researches other teams to devise strategies against them. Riko even uses her father's sports facilities for the team's unique training, which eschews weights for activities like practicing in the pool and drilling basics. Nevertheless, while extremely intelligent, her emotions are often flighty, switching from intensely heated to happily nonchalant at the drop of a hat. Her punishments on her team are very harsh. She is a very bad cook, almost always adding supplements in the team's dishes. Profile: *Aliases: *Birthday date: May 2 *Zodiac Sign: Taurus *Blood type: A ; : : Kuroko's pet dog found in the streets. He was taken in by the team as a sort of mascot, picking up the name Tetsuya #2 for his eerily similar eyes to Kuroko. He is an Alaskan Malamute pup that now wears a Seirin jersey numbered #16. Though Kagami is the only one reluctant to accept their new teammate, he eventually does after the dog proves to be surprisingly helpful and saving Kagami from a possible injury from torn shoes. He now joins the team wherever they go, most often hiding in a bag carried by Kuroko. =Kaij≈ç High= Kaij≈ç is a National-level school that makes it to the Interhigh tournament each year. Although it is the first team Seirin plays, it is not in the Tokyo district like Seirin, Sh≈´toku, Seih≈ç, Senshinkan and T≈ç≈ç Academy. ; :, Takashi ≈åhara (VOMIC) : Now a freshman at Kaij≈ç High, Ry≈çta Kise was the rookie of the \\"Generation of Miracles\\" and plays small forward. Kise started playing basketball because he wanted to do something that was challenging because he easily mastered whatever sport he wanted to do. After seeing how Aomine played he decided to join. Akashi chose Kuroko to be Kise's mentor since Kise initially doubted Kuroko's capabilities as a basketball player and Akashi noticed this. After Kise saw Kuroko's capabilities in their match with the second string, he starts to respect him- almost to the point of obsession- calling him \\"Kurokochii\\" every time they meet. He always tries to point out how amazing Kuroko is and claims that they were the best of friends (and he was comically upset when Kuroko said the he treated Kise the same as everyone else). He even claimed to have cried every night after Kuroko rejected his offer to play for Kaijo and once referred to this event as \\"Kurokochii dumped me\\". Since he only started playing basketball in his second year of middle school, Kise was his team's least experienced member, and notes himself the weakest of the five. Kise wields the amazing ability to imitate moves of other players, only requiring him to only see a technique once, completely copy it and make it into his own. His copying ability doesn't stop there: as he copies the technique, but plays it with more power and speed than the original. This means that when his opponent makes a move, he can transcend them easily. Also, when he imitates a move, he \\"stores\\" them in his memory, enabling him to use nearly every basketball technique there exists. This makes him a very creative player, and above all, a player with bottomless talent in basketball. His ability of course knows some barriers, as Riko observed that he cannot copy NBA or stronger players than himself. Beyond being a strong player in his own right, Kise takes liberal advantage of his good looks and poses as a model after school. Both Kise and Aomine claim that they are the ones who know each other best, even if they aren't teammates anymore. This is due to Kise always playing one-on-one with Aomine back at Teikou. Later, after nearly defeated by Haizaki, with Kuroko encouraging him, Kise finally unlocked the Perfect Copy (an extension of his copying ability) in which Kise can copy every single he has ever seen, with the limitations of his original copying ability no longer applying. The difference to his physical abilities and the abilities of the original user of the copied skill is neglected and Kise is capable copying the Generation of Miracles moves. In order to perfectly reproduce the Generation of Miracles' skills, he has to fill the missing element the original user has with his own. Examples of these are Midorima's High Projectile Three by gathering strength in his shooting arm or jumping higher to mimic Murasakibara's absolute defense. Upon its activation, Kise's eyes glows. He first activated this against Aomine during the InterHigh championships whom he admired and overcame the obstacle of wanting to surpass him, thus activating it for the first time. He later used it again, this time against Haizaki, starting with Midorima's High Projectile Three by taking more time than usual to make the shot, similar to how Midorima makes his. He can replicate Aomine's agility by lowering his initial speed. By using his jumping power and prediction, Kise can recreate Murasakibara's impenetrable defense. He can even copy Akashi's Emperor Eye (though it been noted that it's not 100% perfect like Akashi's, but still capable of reading movements with astonishing accuracy). He can also creatively combine techniques he has copied; he blocked Kuroko's Phantom Shot by fusing Akashi's Emperor Eye with Murasakibara's block. He also merges the Emperor Eye again with Aomine's speed recreate the ankle-breaking move. Kise even copied Kuroko's Phantom Shot by using Midorima's High Projectile Three and also his Ignite Pass Kai. Despite being nearly unstoppable in this state, it is described to be a double-edged skill: it only lasts for no more than 5 minutes due to the Perfect Copy naturally causing great stress to the body, although the time limit has been extended by an extra 2 minutes by Kise (despite his injured foot from his last match with Haizaki). Kise's Perfect Copy is powerful enough that Riko stated Kagami's Zone is the only against it, and it t It is revealed in the movie Extra Game that like Kagami, Aomine, Murasakibara and Akashi, Kise has the ability to enter the \\"zone\\", and he uses the Zone in conjunction with the Perfect Copy, making him the strongest player in the court. After entering the Zone, he attains tremendous power that he was able to keep both Silver and the entire Jabberwock team at bay single-handedly (even reducing a 17-point difference into a 10-point gap, with only the Jabberwock scoring twice). Midorima stated while he is the strongest player in the court, he also mentioned that the combination of Perfect Copy and Zone won't last long due to the fact that both the Perfect Copy and the Zone drains so much stamina. It is because of his Perfect Copy that Kise can easily cover all 5 positions for Vorpal Swords. He is shown to be surprisingly perceptive, though it may be because his specialty is analyzing people's movements and copying them. For this reason, he was the first person to discover Kagami's hidden talent that can surpass the Generation of Miracles themselves: his innate jumping power. ; :, Tooru Sakurai (VOMIC) : The captain of Kaij≈ç's basketball team, Kasamatsu is a nationally credited point guard. Possessed of a short temper and often exceedingly serious demeanor, he can become quickly enraged over the antics of his teammates, Kise in particular, and often vents his feelings with sudden fits of violence. A slight running gag with Kise is that whenever Kasamatsu tries to talk about the Generation of Miracles, Kise always brings up Kuroko into the conversation and ends up getting hit. As he takes his responsibility as team captain very seriously, he is extremely devoted to his team and does his best to trust in their abilities and lead them to glory. Though crushed that he was unable to take his teammates to the Inter-High School Championship, he repressed his own furious sorrow in front of them in order to spur them forward to prepare for the Winter Cup, later anguishing alone rather than burden his team. ; : : A lively and excitable second-year, Hayakawa excels in offensive rebounds and is a ferocious power forward. Very energetic and modestly immature, he has a strange tendency in his speech to skip over certain letters, making it difficult even for his teammates to understand him. ; : : The flirtatious, third-year Shooting Guard of the Kaij≈ç team, Moriyama is a reliable player with a unique shooting form. He is quick to notice pretty women and often claims to fight for them on the court. ; : : A tall and muscular third-year Center, Kobori can hold his own defensively against most centers and can score in the low post. He is rather calm and prefers to stay out of the spotlight and out of trouble. He is focused and passionate. =Sh≈´toku High= Sh≈´toku High is one of the three \\"Kings\\" of Tokyo, along with Seih≈ç High and Senshinkan High- three teams that have made it to the final league, and thus represent Tokyo in the finals, in the InterHigh tournament every year for the past ten years. Beyond the Tokyo finals, in the Nationals they made it to the Final Eight. Last year, the newly established Seirin High was defeated by Sh≈´toku by three times the points. Now, with a member of the \\"Generation of Miracles\\" playing for the team, Sh≈´toku is more powerful than ever. ; ; : Once a member of the \\"Generation of Miracles\\", Midorima now serves as the shooting guard of Sh≈´toku High's basketball team. Known as the Generation of Miracles' #1 outside shooter, his deadliest weapon is the High Projectile Three, an extremely accurate three- point shot with exceptionally high arc (over 14ft above the ground). He can shoot the ball anywhere outside the three-point line, even shooting from the opposite side of the court, with perfect accuracy. It is an unbelievable feat because in reality, most full-court shooters does it in a girdiron-like throwing motion, while he does it with a normal jump shot, a great testament to his overall strength and endurance because he can execute it more than once. Because the shot is so high and it takes a long time for it to reach the basket, Midorima has plenty of time to return in defense, also covering fast breaks and counters from the opponents. In theory, the higher the launch angle (up to 75 degrees), the higher the arc, the more likely the ball to have a bigger target area, giving it more chance for rebounding off the rim or backboard and into the net. The downside of Midorima's impressive ability to shoot from far away is that if a turnover occurs on his side of the court, it gives the opponents great court position and a closer shot as shown by Kagami. He is also very proficient in defense, in his match against Kagami during the training camp, he suppressed him overwhelmingly. According to Hyuga, rather than the score the true horror of Midorima's shot is its deep psychological impact to opponents. This is especially true since most players would freeze on their spot watching the ball fly with abnormally long air time until it reaches the hoop. Midorima is so dedicated to basketball that he tapes his fingers when not playing, so that nothing can influence his left hand while shooting, and also files his nails for the same reason. So far, the only ones who have ever been able to stop Midorima's shots, are Kagami by jumping high enough to block it, Kuroko by blocking his dip off a pump fake and Akashi by stealing the ball before Midorima can bring it above his head. His unparalleled accuracy even extends to things other than a basketball; he once hit a thief riding on a motorcycle that knocked down Momoi with a box of dessert from an impressive distance. Midorima also believes in the absolute nature of fate, so he frequently checks the horoscope and follows its predictions and recommendations to the letter, as some sort of obsession. He occasionally ends his phrases with \\"nanodayo\\", a combination of Japanese sentence-ending particles which adds a tone of \\"an explanation about something that doesn't really need explaining\\" to his words. Kuroko once bluntly stated that Midorima is smart but is sometimes dumb when arguing over the best basketball move with Kise. In Kuroko's opinion his three-pointers are amazing but the worth of points only goes so far, and that dunks that brings up the team's morale can't be measured in comparison. He is the only Generation of Miracles member not to be seen dunking, nor entering the Zone (because he prefers to get more points by shooting threes, as he said so many times). In the entire series, Midorima has never missed an untouched shot, and he has been seen rarely smiling. He and Akashi share a rivalry of sorts in their middle school days; competing not only on academics, but also in shogi, in which Midorima hasn't been able to win once against him. : Due to his superstitious nature, he doesn't like to talk to Kuroko, as Kuroko has A' blood type and he has B' type (it's said that people of those two types don't get along with each other). Also, he doesn't like Kuroko because Kuroko chose Seirin. Midorima states that Kuroko is better than them. His motto is \\"Man proposes, God disposes\\", which means doing your best and fate will decide the rest. Takao often calls him a tsundere, because he tends to help people, but denies in doing so. He sometimes gives them advice under the guise of scorn and criticism. Midorima has good insight and is able to understand other people's abilities easily, like Kagami and Kuroko. He helped Kagami with his aerial understanding, and pushed Kuroko to play by himself, leading to the development of the Vanishing Drive. Furthermore, he shared his theory about Akashi's dual unique ability to Kagami. Midorima has so far shown good understanding of the theories behind Kuroko's skill, the opposite of Aomine whose understanding of Kuroko is by instinct and their former partnership. On Shutoku's team, the senior members of the team are often annoyed by Midorima's selfish demands, particularly Miyaji who responds with frightening threats. This has led the team to allow Midorima only 3 selfish acts a day. Takao mentions that although Midorima is irritating and finds his obsession at luck weird, but they cannot hate him. Midorima also believes in his teammates, believing that there isn't a single player on the team who is a hindrance. : Midorima's superstitions and the seemingly resultant success he experiences from carefully keeping with his beliefs extend even to his normal life. Beyond being lucky in games of chance, like the flipping of coins, Midorima owns a carved pencil, which he sometimes uses on tests. Rolled randomly to give an answer to a multiple choice question, the pencil is correct the vast majority of the time. Midorima's Zodiac sign is Cancer. His birthday and zodiac sign may hint at why he is very dependent on luck (July is the 7th month of the year, and he was born on the 7th day). Midorima has extreme bad luck if he doesn't have his lucky item; if he doesn't carry it with him, he is in constant life-threatening situations until he secures his lucky item. ; ; : A freshman at Sh≈´toku High, Takao is much like Kuroko in that he is a passing expert. However, unlike Kuroko, Takao has none of Kuroko's invisibility. Instead, Takao possesses the \\"Hawk Eye\\", a mental skill superior even to Seirin's Izuki's Eagle Eye. Like the Eagle Eye, it also enables him to make blind passes. The main difference between the Hawk Eye and the Eagle Eye is scope; the Hawk Eye has an even wider range of vision, allowing the player to see everything on the court without focusing on anything. Because of this, Takao is not fooled by Kuroko's misdirection, which utilizes both Kuroko's naturally invisible nature and techniques to divert the attention of those trying to focus on him in particular. Takao's Hawk Eye only weakness results from when Kuroko purposely draws attention to himself, which forces Takao to unconsciously focus on him. This allows Kuroko to use misdirection successfully and disappear from Takao's view. During their match against Rakuzan, he and Midorima showed their new technique called the Sky Direct 3P Shot that utilizes his own accurate passes and Midorima's shooting. They made this play to counter Akashi's Emperor Eye, since the height difference leads to Akashi simply not being able to steal the ball because it is out of his reach, even if he can foresee the move. This play is a huge gamble though, something Midorima had to overcome himself by trusting his teammates greatly. It consists of Midorima shooting without the ball and during the process of shooting he receives the ball in his hands, passed by Takao. If the pass goes through and the shot is unaltered, this play is almost impossible to stop, especially with Midorima's shooting and Takao's passing. However, as Midorima is left-handed, the pass course must always come from the left, making the passes somewhat predictable as showcased by Akashi. : Takao often hangs out with Midorima in his spare time, as he is constantly seen driving Midorima around in a rickshaw-like cart attached to his bicycle. Although they always play paper-rock-scissors to determine who will drive the other, Midorima wins every time. Takao possesses a funny and mischievous personality, contrasting Midorima's tsundere demeanor. ; : : Sh≈´toku's third-year Center and captain, he was largely responsible for the team's success the previous year. Possessed of a size and skill that surpasses most other Centers in high school basketball, he can devastate opposing defenses single-handedly and control the inside of the court with impunity. ; : : A third-year Sh≈´toku regular and the starting small forward. He dislikes Midorima's attitude and special status greatly; whenever Midorima makes an outlandish demand he frequently responds with a violent threat, often asking if anyone has a pineapple or durian, assumed to be for throwing at the object of his dislike. He is hardworking and skilled, and is known as the most intimidating of the upperclassmen by the first-years. ; : : A third-year Sh≈´toku regular and the starting power forward. He shares Miyaji's distaste for Midorima, and frequently offers support of the latter's violent proposals, often offering to help Miyaji acquire fruit to throw. He shares a similar history with Miyaji, being very hardworking and having entered the Shutoku first string his second year, having been placed in the second string during his first year. Despite his height and position as a power forward, he is apparently unable to dunk. =T≈ç≈ç Academy= ; : : Aomine Daiki was the former ace player of the renowned \\"Generation of Miracles\\". Embracing an aggressive and liquid style, made even more powerful by Kuroko's misdirection.. He was leagues ahead of anyone that came second to him, even among the talents of the Generation of Miracles. As explained by Midorima, Aomine learned to play basketball on the streets without any formal lessons, so while not possessing the basic movements of basketball's play, it is said that Aomine never has a non-changing movement, be it passing, shooting, or dribbling, with his play being described as limitless. It's extremely difficult to guard him as only a handful of players could keep up with him. Kise and Kuroko are shown to have the capability of stopping Aomine based on their past experiences as teammates. Despite his already supreme skill, he is capable of more, under the right circumstances; when faced against an appropriate opponent, he can enter the \\"zone, the pinnacle state of concentration where he is able to exert 100% of his capabilities. In this state, Aomine's speed doubles at the least, and his skill to shoot from anywhere escalates. Though players of a certain caliber can all do this, only he is said to be able to do so at least partially of his own will. It is noted that out of the Zone users, Aomine is the only one so far to have full control of Zone, being able to activate it much easier than the others. He is also very knowledgeable about it as well, as he was able to give Kagami some information about the Zone. However, despite being masterful enough to enter the Zone on his own, he couldn't open the second gate of the Zone, due to his lack of team play and promotion of individual play as an ace. He is described as solo player, only playing 1-on-1 against his opponents and not passing the ball to his teammates even when he is cornered. His skill is reflected in the fact that he has beaten Kise in a 1-on-1 before, though this was before Kise acquired the Perfect Copy. At one point it even took a triple team of Kagami, Kiyoshi and Kuroko to stop Aomine. Regarded as a \\"monster\\" in basketball, Aomine's strength lies in his unique ability to shoot from virtually any position and angle, even scoring from behind the backboard among other places; endowed with inhuman speed coupled with surgical acceleration/deceleration, as well as considerable agility (Midorima stated that Aomine transcends even the rest of the Generation of Miracles when it comes to agility alone). Only Ry≈çta Kise, a fellow member of the Generation of Miracles, along with Kagami when he entered the Zone, have been the only players so far able to successfully pass him. His signature move is the Formless Shot, in which he lowers his posture mid-air to bypass the defender, with his body nearly parallel to the ground; deeming it nearly impossible to stop, but Kise and later Kagami were able to block it. Aomine is shown to be very protective of his former teammates in Teiko, something that his current teammates refer as his \\"soft side\\". This was first shown when he threatened a Touou player with violence when he badmouthed Kuroko's playstyle. After Kise's match against Haizaki ended, Aomine confronted Haizaki to make sure he does not attack Kise or get in the way of Kuroko and Kise's match at the Winter Cup. He is also shown to be a big fan of Japanese idols and knows about many of them. He also said that he likes idols with big chests. As a middle schooler, he had a pure love of basketball; but during his second year his talent and skills suddenly blossomed, once single-handedly bringing his team to victory in point leads of up to 200. As his skill grew more renowned and feared, many players would simply give up in trying to stop him. Coming to the conclusion that he would never find an opponent capable of matching him in skill and that the only one who can beat him is himself, Aomine has grown very jaded and sardonic, skipping practice altogether and arriving late for important games. He has been barred from playing in the last games of the Inter High-School Championship due to injuries he sustained in a match against Ry≈çta Kise, who pushed Aomine far harder than he expected was possible. When Seirin defeated his team, Aomine started to regain his love for basketball. He is the one who taught Kuroko how to shoot and inspired Kise to play basketball. Notably, Aomine has been calling Kuroko \\"Tetsu\\" ever since they started training together back in Teiko. His seemingly wild instincts have been compared by players to that of a black panther. This enables him to play purely on feeling and greatly enhance his five senses, making his reflexes and speed top notch. Since Aomine stopped playing seriously, his instincts became dull. However, it slowly came back during his match against Kagami. Aomine and Kagami respect each other and think of each other as a worthy rival. It has been said many times that Kagami and Aomine share a lot of similarities, both in skill and personality. ; : : Formerly the manager of Teik≈ç's \\"Generation of Miracles\\", she is now the manager of T≈ç≈ç Academy's team. Proclaiming herself to be Kuroko's girlfriend, she harbors a vivid fascination for her former teammate, hugging him with extreme glee whenever they meet; Kuroko never fails to return her advances with kindness (though in rebuke). Shrewd, calculating and observant, Momoi is renowned for her exceptional ability to plan nearly flawless strategies. She is able analyze every ability of the player and predict their moves. So far, the only person she cannot predict is Kuroko, because of his lack of presence. Just like Riko, she is also a bad cook; she served uncut lemons to her team as well. : She is Aomine's childhood friend, calling him \\"Dai-chan\\" and one of the few people he makes any effort to behave jovially to. Though she expresses devotion to Kuroko, she cares deeply for Aomine's welfare and state of mind, and is heavily concerned about his opinion of her. Profile: *Aliases: *Birthday date: May 31 *Zodiac Sign: Gemini *Blood type: A ; : : T≈ç≈ç Academy's captain and Point Guard, he is a well-spoken and superficially kind on first glance, but hides a somewhat darker personality that more subtly reveals itself in conversation. Speaking in the typically polite Kansai dialect, Imayoshi laces what would be pleasant conversation with slight jabs at others' weaknesses and understated but absolute expressions of his own confidence. While he displays no unique skills, he is a highly effective captain, culling the collective efforts of the T≈ç≈ç team (widely known for being composed of individuals with very specialized styles and poor compatibility with other teammates). ; : : A first-year of the T≈ç≈ç team, Sakurai is the team's Shooting Guard and 'Preemptive Strike Leader', and is skilled at releasing the ball in the middle of a jump shot with great accuracy. He possesses a very weak and delicate personality, frequently feeling blame for things out of his control and apologizing for them frequently and comically. Facing Seirin a second time, it is revealed that like Hyuga, he has another personality that is the exact opposite of his true self. The same as Hyuga, his shots also gets better and more accurate. ; : : Second-year regular and center of the T≈ç≈ç team, Wakamatsu is easily agitated and extremely loud. Being a player of notable stature, he performs commendably on the defensive, and scoops up rebounds with relative ease. He despises Aomine and frequently expresses his distaste for the latter's lackluster attitude and special treatment within the team, both out of personal jealousy and concern for their team's longevity. He is on very bad terms with Aomine, as he cannot accept someone who skips practice and eats Sakurai's food. Nevertheless, he acknowledges Aomine as the best player on the team. =Y≈çsen High= ; : : Formerly playing center for the \\"Generation of Miracles\\", he does the same now for Y≈çsen High School. Beyond possessing shoulder-length, purple hair, Murasakibara is immediately recognizable for his enormous height. Though his ability as a basketball player has never been disputed, he claims he finds the sport uninteresting, simply playing the sport because he is excruciatingly good at it. Because he doesn't \\"like\\" basketball, he prefers staying on defense; but even then, he doesn't feel like blocking if he doesn't want to. He has always told others that he dislikes, is bored by, and even hates players who passionately play basketball, even when they are losing. He and Kuroko have a rather up-and-down relationship because of their large difference in outlook as athletes especially towards basketball, which caused them to argue more often. Mildly sadistic and bemusingly childish, he is easily riled though generally laid-back, and can often be found with some form of candy in his mouth. It is also mentioned that Murasakibara spends every single penny he has on all kinds of junk food. His abilities have yet to be seen in full, but no one debates dubbing him the greatest center among high school players in Japan. He likes to rub Kuroko's hair whenever he sees him, much to Kuroko's displeasure. He also has a tendency to be with people who can make decisions for him. In Teiko, he was always obedient to whatever orders Akashi gave him. In Yosen, he is seen listening a lot to Himuro's advice. He often tells players \\"I will crush you.\\" : In his match against Seirin, Murasakibara is forced to do his best and his skills are shown. Using his height of 208 cm (roughly 6 feet 10 inches- the average height of a center in the NBA), top-notch reflexes, and monstrous strength from his weight of 95 kilograms (roughly 210 pounds) to dominate the entire area around the basket, he is able to tower any opposing player and block any attempts of jump shots, layups, and dunks without even jumping. He has been seen blocking shots from Hyuga and Kagami when the ball is underway, so much higher than the take-off. Despite his colossal size and seemingly sluggish attitude, he is deceptively fast; he can easily sprint both short and long distances up and down the length of the entire court. He even outran Izuki and got back to defense easily. He is also shown capable of handling the ball on both ends by himself. His strength is seen when he forcibly boxes out 3 defenders and dunk over them with sufficient force to knock them off their feet. At the peak of his destructive power, he was even able to bring down the entire backboard. He has also been seen doing reversal dunks with ease: a feat that requires more power than a normal dunk; facing away the rim requires more strength to compensate for the lack of momentum gained from running towards the basket on a normal dunk. His special move is called Thor's Hammer, an incredibly powerful two- handed dunk combined with a mid-air spin easily capable of overwhelming 3 defenders simultaneously. He even copied Kiyoshi's Vice Claw after watching him demonstrate it. Although widely for being unrivaled in defense, offensive plays is his actual specialty, as stated by Kuroko. He even added that Murasakibara set a score of 100 points in a single game when he got serious. He is strong enough to the point that Aomine himself stated even he has difficulty bypassing him. Along with Kagami, Aomine, Kise and Akashi, Murasakibara also possesses the rare ability to enter the \\"zone\\". According to Aomine and Kise, he is talented enough to enter it, but unfortunately, he would never be able to because it was assumed that he lacks the most basic requirement for entering the Zone: the unwavering passion for the sport. However, such assumptions were proven wrong when Murasakibara surprisingly entered the Zone. However, not much of this was shown, since Murasakibara was the brink of exhaustion and Kagami's Meteor Jam ended the game before Murasakibara could. Additionally, the main condition for him to enter the Zone remains unknown. After Seirin defeated Yosen, he claimed to quit basketball, but broke down in tears not soon after. This makes it clear that he does have a burning passion in playing basketball, in contrary to what is previously believed, which enabled him to enter the Zone. In the movie Last Game, Kise mentioned that Murasakibara stated that if he ever goes all out and play seriously, he might hurt his opponents, or even worse, his own teammates. The reason behind this is because no one can match him in terms of physique and strength. With an opponent like Silver, who surpasses him in physique and strength, Murasakibara can play without holding back. He was shown to be playing with an expression that was recognized by Kuroko and compared it to Kagami when he faces a strong opponent. When he played seriously, he no longer uses any wasteful movements that hamper him from using his full power. This, combined with Okamura's training on how to guard the post against bigger and stronger opponents, he was able to overpower Silver, blocking and dunk on him twice, making Murasakibara the only player who can fight Silver on equal grounds under the basket. ; : : The other ace in Y≈çsen's basketball team and shooting guard, Himuro was Kagami's mentor and rival in the United States. Originally around the same level of skill as Kagami, he has since apparently evolved to equal the members of the Generation of Miracles. Though little of his playing has been seen, he possesses uncannily beautiful shooting form, and the ability to make pro-level fakes that are very realistic that Kagami and even Aomine fell for it, allowing him to easily slip through an opponent's defense. His signature move is the Mirage Shot, in which he shoots and the ball seems to pass through the defender easily, by combining his perfect fakes and throwing the ball in the air twice, fooling the defender that Himuro simply shot twice. It is stated even if the blocker figures out the trick behind the move, jumping later with the goal of blocking the real shot is useless, as Himuro can see that, adapt and shoot sooner, which the blocker will be too late for-which is advantageous to Himuro. Aside from basketball, he is also a skilled fighter, holding off Haizaki from Alex on his own. Usually collected and quietly friendly, he is said to be willing to do anything to fulfill his objectives. In America, they call each other brothers, Himuro being the older one. However, when Kagami starts to beat him in games, he doesn't want to be the big brother. After Kagami discovered the secret of the Mirage Shot, deeming it useless, Himuro had an emotional fest; believing he could never surpass his \\" younger brother\\". He admits that he is jealous of Kagami's abilities. He dislikes the fact that despite being the one who introduced Kagami to basketball, he himself is not naturally \\"gifted\\" like Kagami. Kise also said that he lacks enough talent to enter the \\"zone\\". However in the Winter Cup, Kagami and Himuro make up and happily accept one another as rivals and brothers. His voice actor is the lead vocalist of the band GRANRODEO, which performs 6 openings in the series. =Rakuzan High= ; : :He is the leader and the final member of the \\"Generation of Miracles\\". He stood at their head as captain, leading the team to uncontested victories during the three years he played for Teik≈ç Middle School. He is uninterested in winning, simply because victory in his eyes is an absolute given, requisite to his own life as much as breathing. But he has grown tired of victory in the absence of a chance of defeat; thus when it became clear that Aomine would not be able to participate in the final rounds of the Inter-High school championship, he also withheld himself from playing and demanded Murasakibara to do the same, wanting to make the games at least a little interesting. He upholds an extreme 'winner-takes-all' philosophy, believing that victors are granted absolution in all things, while losers are denied everything. He claims never to have lost at anything, and as such he believes himself right in all things; he is incredibly unstable and grows violent towards those who thus defy him, attempting to stab Kagami with a pair of scissors when the latter refused to leave even when told to do so. However, Kagami later revealed that Akashi already knew he could dodge it. The only person that the Generation of Miracles knuckles under, they assemble as he demands, and can't help but heed his words. In his match against Shutoku, Akashi's abilities are finally revealed: the foresight to see all the possible outcomes of a given situation, known as the Emperor Eye. With this, he can time his movements perfectly to nullify the movements of an opponent, sabotaging whatever tactics the opponent tries to execute, be it offense or defense. He can easily perform ankle breakers, using the Emperor Eye to see weak points in movements and body postures in order to make them fall to the ground, strengthening his image of an emperor. It also widens his field of vision, covering his blind spots and easily see openings in defenses, allowing him to avoid a screen from Kimura and pass through Takao's guard. He obtained this ability back in Teikou where he had a 1-on-1 against Murasakibara when the latter wanted to skip practice as long as they won, and when he was on the verge of losing, he awakened his second personality that possesses the Emperor Eye, allowing him to win. This second personality of Akashi would later sever teamwork and focus instead on individual plays, which later led Kuroko to quit the Teikou basketball team due to being unable to bear the changes in the team. The reason why his second personality manifested was due to the fear of the original Akashi fearing that he will be left behind by his Teiko teammates (who were acquiring their newfound abilities), and due to the amount of pressure his life had put on him to strive for absolute excellence. It is shown that Akashi's mother died when he was at the 5th year of elementary school, and she had inspired him to play basketball. His father became even more strict to the point that the more skills Akashi mastered, the more he will be given to master, making him very unhappy. In the game against Seirin, Akashi finally resurfaces from the depths of his consciousness after his second personality was soundly defeated by the teamwork of Kuroko and Kagami and decides to take over his rightful place. When he resurfaced, he awakened his second ability that is Perfectly-Rhythmed Plays. With the Emperor Eye and his perfect playmaking, Akashi can grasp the situation and send out accurate passes on a whim. Though it appears that is just a normal play, the real thing is that Akashi sets up his teammate for good looks and throws out a perfect pass, he creates a perfect rhythm in them. Midorima notes this is Akashi's true power: to bring his teammates' true potentials. Riko notes they are only at 90% of their full potential, a step before the Zone. Even Takao compliments him as the \\"ideal point guard\\", even if his shooting were not to be mentioned. Like Aomine, Kagami, and Kise and Murasakibara, he possesses the ability to enter the \\"zone\\" (after witnessing Aomine enter it willingly). Combining this with the Emperor Eye, he managed to easily overtake Kagami and Seirin's team quite easily, making him arguably the strongest player in the entire series, even surpassing Aomine and Nash Gold. However, he only uses this during situations where Rakuzan would surely lose. Like Kagami's Zone, his Zone possesses a defensive sphere like Kagami and Murasakibara. Even though Akashi is short for a basketball player (173 cm/5'8), he can still dunk, declaring that it is not a move used by only big players. Also, his mental prowess when judging a scenario and making split- second decisions is supremely fast. This allowed him to switch from a lay-up to a pass almost instantaneously against Midorima. Akashi's plays are extremely well-designed; as it was revealed in their match against Shutoku that everything that occurred was all a part of Akashi's plan. It would seem that his personalities have their own special abilities, making him the only Generation of Miracles member with two unique abilities, while the rest only have one. In the movie Last Game, it is revealed that in order to use the Emperor Eye to its full potential, Akashi must switch personalities. It was also shown that when Gold activates his Belial Eye, Akashi can dribble the ball at a very high level that is difficult for the defender's eyes to follow, making it nearly impossible to steal. This technique is very similar to the one Gold uses, as it also has the ball moving at such a high pace aided with the use of many feints, confusing the defender, with the ball seemingly disappearing into thin air. This enabled Akashi to pass the ball out of the range of Gold's Demon Eye, by passing the ball behind his back to Aomine. The audience lauded him as a natural-born streetballer when Akashi performed this. In the fourth quarter of Team Jabberwock vs Team Vorpal Swords, both of Akashi's personalities thought that the Emperor Eye was inferior to Gold's Demon Eye, but the other Akashi thought otherwise, stating that the Emperor Eye isn't inferior but rather incomplete, because the two are split apart (the reason why Akashi needs to switch places with the other Akashi to gain the Emperor Eye's full power is because the Emperor Eye is not his original ability, but the other Akashi's skill). The other Akashi stated if the Emperor Eye merges with the court vision Akashi uses to make perfect passes, he will gain a power greater than Gold, but the other Akashi decided to disappear in order to transfer his skill to the real Akashi which would allow him to use the full power of the Emperor Eye, eliminating the need to switch personalities. Now possessing the \\"complete\\" Emperor Eye, Akashi was able to predict the future even further than Gold's Demon Eye by perceiving the best possible pattern from Gold's entire movements which led Akashi successfully stealing the ball from him. As stated by Murasakibara, Akashi is capable of discovering people's hidden skills, being the first to recognize Kuroko's potential talent for misdirection and helped him polish his play style. ; : : Hayama is one of the Uncrowned Kings. He is very energetic and often fools around carelessly. His specialty is dribbling, with his ball control on such a high level, that he actually presses the ball downwards with enough force for it to explode perfectly into a quick cross-over. Because he slams the ball so fiercely onto the ground, it becomes too fast for the eyes to follow, making it very hard to steal. It is seen when he dribbles, he only uses his fingers, channeling the strength of his whole body to his fingers to dribble with more force. It is also shown that the noise his dribble made is loud enough to be heard by spectators that forced them to cover their ears. It is called the Lightning Dribble. He can also perform a near-perfect double clutch, dive under the defender and lay it in. His seemingly wild reflexes have been compared by players to that of a cheetah's. Being too conceited and underestimating his opponent, Hayama was beaten by Izuki Shuun and became bathed in rage, affecting his play negatively. Furthermore, he is the only one who laughed at Izuki's puns. He is nicknamed \\"Thunder Beast\\" due to his speed. ; : : Mibuchi is another one of the Uncrowned Kings of Rakuzan. Mibuchi is pretty uptight. He likes to keep things in line and gets annoyed easily when others fool around or act weird. He criticizes them and tries to correct them, but is not always successful. He is Rakuzan's best shooter, and one of the best in the series, only surpassed by Midorima. Hyuuga patterned his shooting style to him, to the point of being in awe of his shots. It seems that Mibuchi wants as many points as possible, as he commented that he is quite greedy and can make 3 or 4 points in one play. He has three types of shooting forms, which are named: \\"Earth\\", \\"Heaven\\", and \\"Void\\". The \\"Heaven\\" is a simple fade- away shot, while the \\"Earth\\" shooting form is a foul-drawing technique. The \\"Void\\" is a shooting form that disables the defender from doing anything, however, Mibuchi only uses this when he faces an opponent he acknowledges. Because of his acknowledgement to Hyuga, he used his \\"Void\\" to gain the upper hand. However, it doesn't end there, as Hyuga discovered the weaknesses of his shooting forms and managed to fight back. Mibuchi states that he has a crush on one of his own team members in an extra. His nickname is the \\"Demon Guardian\\". ; : : The final member of the Uncrowned Kings of Rakuzan. He is 190 cm tall and has a well-muscled body, as he believes that brute strength is enough to beat his opponents. Nebuya is a glutton who is shown to be able to eat comparable amounts to or even more than Kagami, and owes his spot to Akashi, who discovered and exploited his potential. He claims that he gets more power when he eats meat and even overeats before a game. Also, he believes that \\"muscles improve everything\\"- the main reason he decided to get buffer. He is often called \\"Muscle Gorilla\\" because he loves to add the word \\"muscle\\" while playing such as 'muscle screen-out', 'muscle rebound' and 'muscle dunk' though it appears that these are just normal plays but with raw power, which gives him great advantage in the post, allowing him to easily overpower centers like Kiyoshi or Otsubo. He also has a decent speed to back up his strong build. He's known as the \\"Herculean Strength\\". ; : : Mayuzumi was put on Rakuzan's strong team for a sole reason: he possesses the rare ability of misdirection. Akashi trained him to be like Kuroko, but with finer skills. The reason for this is that Mayuzumi has solid basketball fundamentals whereas Kuroko's general basketball skills are below average, this allows him to score normally, when Kuroko can't. However unlike Kuroko, Mayuzumi doesn't use flashy moves, enabling himself to draw less attention to himself. Mayuzumi claims to pass only for himself and is short-tempered. Without misdirection Mayuzumi is an average player and becomes his teammates' topic of insult, affecting his abilities negatively. =Kirisaki Daƒ´chi High= ; ; : Hanamiya is the coach and captain of the Kirisaki Daƒ´chi team and the final Uncrowned King. An intelligent and shrewd point guard, his dishonest and underhanded playing style has earned him the nickname . He was the cause of Kiyoshi's knee injury in the previous year. Hanamiya's skill is analyzing the possible passing and attack patterns of an opposing team he has observed, swooping down the passing line and stealing the ball. He can do this by narrowing down the pass courses with the help of his fellow teammate Kentaro Seto positioning himself in the main passing lanes in order to force the opposing point guard into a risky pass course Hanamiya can predict, allowing Hanamiya to steal every single ball. This is referred to as Hanamiya's Spider Web. According to Kiyoshi, Hanamiya's stealing accuracy is insanely high, even stealing Izuki's passes, a possessor of the \\"Eagle Eye\\". His foul methods and underhanded play have misled players to underestimate him in offense, but Hanamiya has proven this to be wrong, even pulling off a difficult teardrop shot.

John Parker at Lexington, Massachusetts, but the only one to find the approaching British troops and get back to warn the militia on the first day of the American Revolution (\\"the shot heard 'round the world\\"). Background  In early 1775, the British commander in America, Lieutenant-General Thomas Gage, knew first-hand the level of colonial dissatisfaction with British policies on the rights of the colonists. He feared this could lead to serious violence, and he was under pressure from England to do something to show the power of the Crown. He also knew, through informants, that the patriots had stored a large quantity of gunpowder, cannon and other military supplies in Concord. By sending an expeditionary force out from Boston to seize these supplies, he intended to show the might of the British Empire and hoped to prevent any future hostilities with the colonists.Fischer, David Hackett, Paul Revere's Ride, pp. 43, 75-86, Oxford University Press, New York, NY, 1994. Patriot leaders, such as John Hancock, Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, Dr. Joseph Warren, James Otis, Jr., Benjamin Edes and John Gill, were not only mobilizing public opinion against restrictive British policies, but also kept close tabs on the activities of the British troops in Boston. Edes and Gill were the publishers of the Boston Gazette, a newspaper which printed the multitude of articles written by Samuel Adams, laying out the patriot cause. Their print shop was a favorite meeting place for the leaders of the movement.Fischer, David Hackett, Paul Revere's Ride, p. 20, Oxford University Press, New York, NY, 1994. On the night of April 18, 1775, the expeditionary force of over 700 soldiers left Boston. Paul Revere rode to warn John Hancock and Samuel Adams, who were staying in Lexington (which is on the way to Concord), to leave so they would not be arrested by the British force. Revere had previously arranged the famous lantern signal from the Old North Church to patriots on the other side of the Charles River, so they could spread the word, in case Revere was prevented from leaving Boston.Coburn, Frank Warren, The Battle of April 19, 1775 in Lexington, Concord, Lincoln, Arlington, Cambridge, Somerville and Charlestown, Massachusetts, pp. 22-23, Lexington Historical Society, Lexington, MA, 1922. Revere made it to Lexington at midnight, where he alarmed the town, Adams and Hancock, as well as set in motion a network of alarm riders that fanned out across the colony. John Parker, the captain of the Lexington Militia, mustered his men on Lexington Green and held an impromptu town meeting in the open air. Samuel Adams, John Hancock and Jonas Clarke, the town minister, were there.Fischer, David Hackett, Paul Revere's Ride, p. 151, Oxford University Press, New York, NY, 1994. \\"The Shot Heard 'Round the World\\" and Bowman's Role As any good commander does, Parker wanted as much information as possible on the situation he was about to face. So, he sent out scouts, one of whom was Thaddeus Bowman. One scout made it as far as Cambridge and back, and reported seeing no sign of British Regulars. There had been false alarms before, and Parker also knew that the supplies at Concord had been dispersed to other towns and/or hidden. Previous British expeditions to other towns had resulted in no bloodshed and no discovery of any colonial arms - just a tiring exercise for the king's troops. If the troops were actually coming, it was likely that they would march through town, reach Concord, find nothing, and return to Boston empty-handed.Galvin, Gen. John R., US Army, The Minutemen - The First Fight: Myths and Realities of the American Revolution, 2nd edition, pp. 120-124, Pergamon-Brassey's International Defense Publishers, Inc., Washington, D.C., 1989. Parker dismissed his men, but instructed them to stay within the sound of a drum. At about 4:15 a.m., Thaddeus Bowman came riding up at a full gallop. He had found the Regulars, but had been trapped on the road behind them, and unable to get back to warn the town earlier.Sons of the American Revolution, The History of Lexington, (http://users.rcn.com/waynemccarthy/LMM2002/images/thaddeusbowman3.pdf). He reported to Capt. Parker that they were already past \\"the Rocks,\\" a landmark which meant that they were less than half an hour away.Tourtellot, Arthur Bernon, William Diamond's Drum: The Beginning of the War of the American Revolution, pp. 116-126, Doubleday & Co., Inc., Garden City, New York, 1959. Capt. Parker instantly mustered his company, ordering his drummer, William Diamond, to beat \\"To Arms,\\" a long roll. The town bell was sounded and alarm guns were fired.Wood, Sylvanus, Affidavit, (http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/lexington.htm). At Lexington Green, the road to Bedford meets the road from Boston to Concord. Parker formed up his men in the open Common between these two roads, in parade ground formation. They were not hiding behind stone walls. His purpose was to show colonial determination, but not to block either road, and not to provoke a fight. His orders to his men were, \\"Let the troops pass by. Don't molest them, without they being first.\\"Phinney, Elias, History of the Battle at Lexington on the Morning of the 19th April 1775, p. 19, Phelps & Farnham, Boston, MA, 1825.Fischer, David Hackett, Paul Revere's Ride, p. 188, Oxford University Press, New York, NY, 1994. Unfortunately, the lead companies of the British force went right at the fork in the road (toward Bedford instead of Concord), and the key officers in charge were further back in the column. Major John Pitcairn, seeing the mistake, rode quickly forward, but too late to alter the course of the rapidly unfolding events. The lead companies saw the militia and formed up into a line of battle. A shot was fired - no one knows by whom. Both sides denied shooting first, and that could well be true. There were many spectators milling around, some of whom had spent the evening in Buckman Tavern, which is across the street from the Green. The first shot could have come from one of them. Regardless, the Regulars reacted to it and started firing, then charged the militia and bayoneted anyone left on the field.Proceedings of Lexington Historical Society and Papers Relating to the History of the Town Read by Some of the Members, vol. 1, pp. 42-66, Lexington Historical Society, Lexington, MA, 1890. Seven Lexington men were killed, and nine wounded. That's 25% casualties in ten minutes. Hearing the skirmish, British Lt. Col. Francis Smith rode up and knew what to do. He found a drummer and ordered him to beat \\"Cease Fire.\\" He reformed his troops and marched them off to Concord.Galvin, Gen. John R., US Army, The Minutemen - The First Fight: Myths and Realities of the American Revolution, 2nd edition, p. 128, Pergamon- Brassey's International Defense Publishers, Inc., Washington, D.C., 1989. Capt. Parker got his revenge though. He performed what Gen. John Galvin has called a \\"miracle of leadership, regrouping and reanimating his company after the Regulars overran it in the dawn attack... Somehow he was able to transform the scattered and demoralized soldiers into a fighting unit again, determined to avenge the loss of their comrades by meeting the British on their return from Concord.\\"Galvin, Gen. John R., US Army, The Minutemen - The First Fight: Myths and Realities of the American Revolution, 2nd edition, p. 181, Pergamon- Brassey's International Defense Publishers, Inc., Washington, D.C., 1989. Meet them they did. The Lexington militia company set up an effective ambush from good cover at a bend in the road at the Lexington town line. They took a heavy toll on the Regulars, including hitting the commanding officer. Lt. Col. Smith took a musket ball in the thigh which also unhorsed him. By now, angry militia companies from all over Massachusetts, and even adjoining colonies, were converging on the area. The British column began taking fire from all sides. If Lt. Gen. Gage had not sent out another thousand troops as re-enforcements, along with two cannon, the initial 700 would have never made it back to Boston.MacKenzie, Lt. Frederick, Diary, published as A British Fusilier in Revolutionary Boston, pp. 20-26, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1926.

It received final design approval from Baltimore's Planning Commission on December 16, 2010,Walmart Baltimore - Walmart-anchored project gets city design approval - Baltimore Sun and was to commence construction in early 2011, with a 2012 opening. The development would have included of retail space, including a Walmart and Lowe's as anchor tenants, with an array of smaller retailers and 70 apartments. As of October 2011 construction of 25th Street Station has not begun yet and the Lowe's is no longer an anchor. On May 20, 2014, the project's primary developer, WV Urban Developments, withdrew from the project, citing numerous ongoing legal issues and challenges as the cause.Developer out of 25th Street Station project The WV Urban's project manager for the site upon the announcement of its withdrawal stated, \\"WV Urban Developments is no longer pursuing its 25th Street Station project. As you are well aware, the project has been the target of numerous appeals and filings by opponents, which have delayed the project for years.\\" The appeals were stated to \\"have contributed to an environment sufficiently uncertain that the relevant parties are unable to reach the agreements necessary for WV to continue.\\" WV Urban Developments had spent more than $5 million in planning costs and attorney's fees defending the project against lawsuits that had been dismissed but appealed. As of August 2015, the 25th Street Station project is essentially dead, as WV Urban Developments sold the land that was to be used for the 25th Street Station project to a new developer, Seawall Development Co. (who has a proven track record of locally-oriented development and community engagement within Baltimore City) in late-2014 who on March 17, 2015 agreed with the communities that surrounded this project that they would not develop the property in accordance to the 25th Street Station PUD and the November 21, 2013 decision by the Baltimore City Planning Commission (essentially killing the proposed Walmart that was highly controversial from the original proposal) and would not oppose to a potential action by the Baltimore City Council and the Planning Commission to cancel or repeal the 25th Street Station PUD in exchange for the dismissal of two appeals pending within the Maryland Court of Special Appeals that was filed in opposition of the 25th Street Station project. The proposed site is bounded by West 25th Street to the north, Maryland Avenue to the east, West 24th Street to the south, and the CSX Railroad line to the west.  Project History  Anderson Automotive, a car dealership that sells General Motors and Honda automobiles, currently occupies the 11-acre site where in the development was to be built. In mid-2009, GM informed Anderson that they planned to discontinue selling automobiles at that location, ending a 90-year relationship there. Anderson subsequently announced that it would also relocate its Honda dealership from Howard & 25th Streets to Hunt Valley, Maryland, north of Baltimore; it had been in operation for 15 years. During fall 2009, it was announced that Anderson intended to sell the property to a developer, who would construct a Lowe's home improvement store, a supermarket, other retail spaces and apartments. (However, Anderson still has a dealership cluster in Hunt Valley, selling both GM and Honda vehicles.) On February 26, 2010, the Baltimore Sun revealed that a Walmart store would join Lowe's as an anchor tenant. On October 17, 2011, the Baltimore Sun reported that Lowe's decided to drop out of the 25th Street Station project and that construction hasn't begun due to \\"court challenges,\\" however the loss of Lowe's was reported to not put the project in jeopardy. In the meantime, the original Anderson building that formerly functioned as a showroom for its GM cars has been re-purposed as a body shop and service center for all GM and Honda vehicles; the Honda building, which was fronted by a used-car lot after the dealership's relocation, is now vacant.  Opposition and Support  Opposition to the project centered on the inclusion of Walmart as an anchor tenant and the potential impacts of big box retail on smaller, mom-and-pop stores in historic business districts. Residents in the neighborhoods surrounding the development voiced concerns about the inevitable increase in traffic, noise, and light pollution the high-intensity uses would bring. Still others were concerned that the shopping center's actual design was too suburban in nature and not suitable for an dense, urban environment. Support for the project focused on the construction and permanent jobs that the development would create, and the convenience of being able to shop inside city limits, when many city residents are forced to drive to the surrounding suburbs to shop at comparable stores. However, there had been a Walmart in Port Covington, located off Hanover Street south of downtown Baltimore, which was one of 269 stores that were closed nationwide in early 2016; and currently, main rival Target has one city location, in Canton; a former Target location at Mondawmin Mall was closed in February 2018. Both companies also have numerous locations in neighboring Baltimore and Anne Arundel Counties. Heated debate about the merits and drawbacks of the developer's plans continued throughout most of 2010. The project was granted design approval by the Urban Design and Architectural Review Panel (UDARP) in October 2010. Public hearings and meetings concerning the project were held by the Planning Commission and City Council. The City Council approved the Planned Unit Development ordinance in November 2010. The final design and a minor amendment were approved by the Planning Commission on December 16, 2010.

He commanded troops from the Kingdom of Prussia in several battles during the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793 and 1794. Afterward he held various appointments as a diplomat and a military inspector. In 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars he held an important army command but has been criticized for his actions at Jena. Wounded, he managed to escape the French pursuit, but never commanded troops in combat again. Early career R√ºchel was born on 21 July 1754 in Ziezeneff in Prussian Pomerania (modern Cieszeniewo, Poland). With the rank of Oberst (colonel), R√ºchel fought against the First French Republic during the War of the First Coalition. During the Siege of Mainz from 10 April to 23 July 1793, he commanded a brigade consisting of the Thadden and Legat Fusilier Battalions and the Wolframsdorf Grenadier Battalion. After promotion to General-major, he led the Prussian contingent during the Second Battle of Wissembourg in December 1793. The units coming under his orders were eight battalions in the Infantry Regiments Kleist Nr. 12, Wolframsdorf Nr. 37, and Hertzberg Nr. 47, two foot j√§ger companies, three squadrons of the Wolfradt Hussar Regiment Nr. 6, one and one-half horse artillery batteries, and a half 6-pound foot battery.Smith (1998), p. 66 On 23 May 1794, R√ºchel led a column in a Prussian victory at the Battle of Kaiserslautern. On this occasion he led three battalions each of the Infantry Regiments R√ºchel Nr. 30 and Wolframsdorf, the Ernst Fusilier Battalion Nr. 19, three foot j√§ger companies, three squadrons each of the Eben Hussar Regiment Nr. 2 and Voss Dragoon Regiment Nr. 11, two foot artillery batteries, and one horse artillery battery.Smith (1998), p. 81 At the Peace of Basel in 1795, Prussian abandoned the First Coalition to concentrate her energies on the Third Partition of Poland. 1806 and later In 1806 R√ºchel was the commander-in-chief of the Infantry Regiment Nr. 2. During the War of the Fourth Coalition, R√ºchel was given command of the westernmost of the three Prussian armies. The other two armies were led by Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick and Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen. In early October, Hohenlohe's army assembled near Rudolstadt and Brunswick's at Erfurt. R√ºchel's army was split between Eisenach and Gotha with Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach's division farther south at Schmalkalden and Johann Friedrich von Winning's detachment at Vacha.Chandler (1966), p. 459 Prussian grenadiers 1807 Emperor Napoleon I of France thrust his 180,000-man army through the Frankenwald,Chandler (1966), pp. 467-468 winning the Battle of Schleiz on 9 October and the Battle of Saalfeld on 10 October. The Prussian high command concentrated their armies on the west bank of the Saale River. They planned for Brunswick to move north toward Halle, while Hohenlohe covered his eastern flank by defending at Jena.Chandler (2005), p. 23 On 14 October, Brunswick's army ran head on into Louis Davout's III Corps near Auerstedt and was badly defeated. Meanwhile, Napoleon fell on Hohenlohe at the Battle of Jena with the bulk of his army. R√ºchel had been told to stay at Weimar until Saxe-Weimar's division arrived. He made the soldierly decision to march at once with his 15,000 available troops to assist Hohenlohe. Unfortunately, by the time his corps arrived, the battle was lost.Petre (1993), p. 147 Historian David G. Chandler argued that R√ºchel was unfairly criticized for his belated appearance. He received news of the battle at 9:00 AM and left his camp at Weimar immediately. His troops marched five kilometers in one hour, then they deployed from march columns into platoon columns with flank guards out and the artillery at the ready. At 10:30 AM, he got a misleading note from Hohenlohe saying that the battle was going well. Around noon Hohenlohe sent him another message asking for immediate assistance. Just before his troops reached Kapellendorf around 1:00 PM, a courier brought news that the Prussian army was defeated. It took R√ºchel a total of four hours to move 12 kilometers, including the time it took to break camp; this was not a slow pace by Prussian standards.Chandler (2005), p. 64 He brought 15,000 troops and 40 field pieces to the battlefield. Altogether, there were 25 squadrons from five cavalry regiments, three foot j√§ger companies, 14 musketeer battalions from seven infantry regiments, four fusilier battalions, two grenadier battalions, three foot batteries, and two horse batteries.Chandler (2005), p. 42 Christian Karl August Ludwig von Massenbach, Hohenlohe's chief of staff, directed R√ºchel to move east from Kapellendorf. Dutifully, he advanced his corps across the Herressener Bach in echelon order, but with both flanks in the air. Chandler noted that the unwise decision to attack was Hohenlohe's. Soon after it was committed to battle, Hohenlohe rode up to take personal command of the corps. Though the French V Corps of Marshal Jean Lannes was stopped in its tracks, R√ºchel's left was soon turned by one of Marshal Nicolas Soult's IV Corps divisions. Instructing his cavalry to cover a retreat, R√ºchel ordered his infantry to fall back. His cavalry came under a terrific bombardment by French artillery and the regiments were thrown into confusion. At this moment, Marshal Joachim Murat directed the French Reserve Cavalry into the contest, with a division of cuirassiers in the lead. Without cavalry protection, R√ºchel's troops were ridden over and sent fleeing to the rear in irretrievable rout. Wounded, R√ºchel narrowly avoided capture during the next few weeks.Petre (1993), p. 197 During the maneuvers that ended in the Battle of Eylau on 7 and 8 February 1807, R√ºchel commanded the 4,000-strong Prussian garrison of K√∂nigsberg. At that time, Anton Wilhelm von L'Estocq led the 9,000-man Prussian field force. R√ºchel died on 14 January 1823 in Haseleu, Pomerania.

Dilution of sewage decreases the efficiency of treatment, and may cause sewage volumes to exceed design capacity. Although inflow is technically different from infiltration, it may be difficult to determine which is causing dilution problems in inaccessible sewers. The United States Environmental Protection Agency defines the term infiltration/inflow as combined contributions from both.40CFR35.905 Accessed 2010-12-29 Background Early combined sewers used surface runoff to dilute waste from toilets and carry it away from urban areas into natural waterways. Sewage treatment can remove some pollutants from toilet waste, but treatment of diluted flow from combined sewers produces larger volumes of treated sewage with similar pollutant concentrations. Modern sanitary sewers are designed to transport domestic and industrial wastewater directly to treatment facilities without dilution.Steel, E.W. and McGhee, Terence J. Water Supply and Sewerage (1979) McGraw-Hill p.318 Infiltration Groundwater entering sanitary sewers through defective pipe joints and broken pipes is called infiltration.King, James J. The Environmental Dictionary (1995) John Wiley & Sons p.335 Pipes may leak because of careless installation; they may also be damaged after installation by differential ground movement, heavy vehicle traffic on roadways above the sewer, careless construction practices in nearby trenches, or degradation of the sewer pipe materials. In general, volume of leakage will increase over time. Damaged and broken sewer cleanouts are a major cause of infiltration into municipal sewer systems.EPA Report June 2014 Infiltration will occur where local groundwater elevation is higher than the sewer pipe. Gravel bedding materials in sewer pipe trenches act as a French drain. Groundwater flows parallel to the sewer until it reaches the area of damaged pipe. In areas of low groundwater, sewage may exfiltrate into groundwater from a leaking sewer.Metcalf & Eddy Wastewater Engineering (1972) McGraw-Hill pp.39-44 Inflow Water entering sanitary sewers from inappropriate connections is called inflow. Typical sources include sump pumps, roof drains, cellar drains, and yard drains where urban features prevent surface runoff, and storm drains are not conveniently accessible or identifiable. Inflow tends to peak during precipitation events, and causes greater flow variation than infiltration. Peak flows caused by inflow may generate a foul flush of accumulated biofilm and sanitary solids scoured from the dry weather wetted perimeter of oversized sewers during peak flow turbulence. Sources of inflow can sometimes be identified by smoke testing. Smoke is blown into the sewer during dry weather while observers watch for smoke emerging from yards, cellars, or roof gutters.Hammer, Mark J. Water and Waste-Water Technology (1975) John Wiley & Sons pp.303-304&441-442 Significance Dilution of sewage directly increases costs of pumping and chlorination, ozonation, or ultraviolet disinfection. Physical treatment structures including screens and pumps must be enlarged to handle the peak flow. Primary clarifiers must also be enlarged to treat average flows, although primary treatment of peak flows may be accomplished in detention basins. Biological secondary treatment is effective only while the concentration of soluble and colloidal pollutants (typically measured as biochemical oxygen demand or BOD) remains high enough to sustain a population of microorganisms digesting those pollutants. Secondary treatment is expected to remove 85 percent of soluble and colloidal organic pollutants from sewage containing 200 mg/L BOD;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC. \\"Secondary Treatment Regulation.\\" Code of Federal Regulations, 40 CFR Part 133. but BOD removal by conventional biological secondary treatment becomes less effective with dilution and practically ceases as BOD concentrations entering the treatment facility are diluted below about 20 mg/L. Unremoved organics are potentially converted to disinfection by-products by chemical disinfection prior to discharge. High rates of infiltration/inflow may make the sanitary sewer incapable of carrying sewage from the design service area. Sewage may back up into the lowest homes during wet weather, or street manholes may overflow. Correction Smoke test results may not correlate well with flow volumes; although they can identify potential problem locations. Where sewage flow is expected to be relatively uniform, significance of infiltration and inflow may be estimated by comparison of sewage flow at the same point during wet and dry weather or at two sequential points within the sewer system. Small areas with large flow differences can be identified if the sewer system provides adequate measuring locations. It may be necessary to replace a section of sewer line if flow differences cannot be corrected by removing identified connections.

Union has pretty much the same boundaries as does Barangay Union, of the Municipality of Dapa, in the province of Surigao del Norte. See Dapa, Surigao del Norte. Union is bordered on the east by the Pacific Ocean and on the other three sides by jungle and tropical forest. It is located east of the village of Giwan (see Giwan, Surigao del Norte).Wikimapia website, http://www.wikimapia.org . Demographics Barangay Union, according to the Philippine National Statistical Board, had a population of 2,645 people on August 1, 2007. Virtually the entire population of Union is Filipino. Virtually the entire population speaks Tagalog, most speak English and many speak other languages native to the Philippines, such as Visayan. A few foreigners from Canada and Europe have built large homes in Union and reside there. Most of the houses are primitive wood houses with either wood or concrete floors or are built of cement block. Virtually all houses have electricity, but very few have any air conditioning. There is no television service to Union.Philippine National Statistical Coordination Board website, . Small parts of the village of Union are just outside the barangay, but 90% of it is inside the barangay boundaries. The village measures roughly six blocks long from southwest to northeast and four blocks wide from northwest to southeast. The highway runs the length of the village and is paved and well maintained in town. Most of the highway between Giwan and Union, while paved, looks as though it has not been maintained for many years. As the highway leaves the north side of Union, the maintenance of it stops. It then curves a short distance due east and stops at the ocean edge. There is a ford two blocks long that crosses a shallow area where a river meets the ocean. It can only be forded by foot at low tide. On the other side of the river the road becomes not much better than a footpath and cannot be traveled by any vehicles. It gets somewhat better after passing two surfer resorts.Wikimapia website; Jack L. Ferreras, map of Siargao Island, ca. 2010. Many streets inside Union are paved and even the dirt streets are reasonably well maintained. Religious Institutions Union is predominantly Roman Catholic. However, it has three churches, the Catholic Church, a United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP) and a Seventh-Day Adventist Church. The Adventist Church is actually a bit south of the village. Economy While just to the east the surfer resorts of General Luna begin, Union has no tourism. Tourists sometimes swim in the river east of the village at high tide. Union has a large beach area on the east side of town. There are swimming areas and shelter houses for swimmers and picnickers on the beach. At the end of a pier near the south end of the beach are three large shelter houses for persons to dive, sight see and eat.Wikimapia website; Gregg Bloom, Michael Grosberg, Virginia Jealous and Piers Kelly, Lonely Planet: Philippines (Footscray, Australia: Lonely Planet, May 2009), 10th ed., p. 378. Ocean fishing plays a part in Union's economy, as bangka fishing boats are based along the village beach area. A bangka is a fairly large outrigger canoe, which is usually motorized. Union has at least one regular retail shop and at least one bakery. It is dotted with many sari sari stores. A shelterhouse in the center of town is used for barangay meetings and other community functions. Union has a fairly large public health clinic. Transport Since Union is small, people usually get around town by walking. An area in the center of the village is used as a motorized tricycle stop (see motorized tricycle (Philippines)).

In fact, Lord Brahma had given a boon that no one will be able to defeat him during wars. Durgam became very powerful and started harassing kings and sanyasis.

He was first active in a trade union and the Norges Socialdemokratiske Ungdomsforbund before joining the Norwegian Labour Party in 1914. He was hired as subeditor of the party's newspaper S√∏rlandets Socialdemokrat in 1915, and was promoted to editor of Tidens Krav in 1918 and Tiden in 1921. In 1923 there was mounting differences between two wings in the Labour Party, and Jacobsen was deemed too Moscow-friendly by the party members who controlled Tiden. He was fired from the editor position in Tiden in anticipation of a party split, and that way it was prevented that Tiden fell into control of the Moscow-friendly wing. When the Moscow-friendly Communist Party was established later in 1923, Jacobsen joined them.

This school was relocated to Baguio on September 1, 1908, at Camp Henry Allen where it would stay for many years to come. On a Monday, October 23, 1916, immediately after assuming his position as senator representing Mindanao and Sulu, Senator Hadji Butu Abdul Baqui sponsored his first bill, Senate Bill No. 9 creating a law establishing a military academy and requiring military education in colleges and universities. On the same day, he also sponsored Senate Bill No. 10 creating a law to establish a naval academy. (From Senate Diaries of the 4th Philippine Legislature, Volume 1, page 32, October 1916, original copy (in Spanish) at Adams Building, U.S. Library of Congress, from research work of Dr. Abraham T. Rasul, Jr., Washington DC). On February 9, 1917, US President Woodrow Wilson, in an article written in the Buffalo Enquirer mentioned \\"military or naval training will be a good thing for the young men of the country\\" and congratulated Senator Hadji Butu \\"for being the first among those in the upper house to introduce the measures for their establishment\\". After the Philippine Legislature passed Act No. 3496 on September 8, 1926, the school was renamed the Philippine Constabulary Academy and courses were lengthened from nine months to three years. Just as the PC started with American and Filipino officers, the school had American and Filipino officer cadets in its student body. When the National Defense Act was approved on December 21, 1935, the Philippine Constabulary Academy was renamed Philippine Military Academy and was permitted to grant its graduates Bachelor of Science degrees after completion of their four-year curriculum. PMA was modeled after the United States Military Academy with officers from the Philippine Scouts and regular United States Army as instructors and members of the general staff. PMA Class of 1940, with 79 graduates, was the pioneer batch to complete four years of training. Quirico Evangelista and Reynaldo Mendoza of Class '40 composed the PMA alma mater song, \\"PMA, Oh Hail to Thee.\\" Facade of Melchor Hall, PMA With the outbreak of the Second World War, training was disrupted at the PMA with Classes 1942 and 1943 being graduated prematurely and assigned to combat units in Bataan and other parts of the country. Many of these young officers perished in the war. After the war, the Academy was reopened on May 5, 1947, at Camp Henry T. Allen in Baguio. But due to its increasing need for larger grounds, it was soon moved to its present location at Fort General Gregorio H. del Pilar, Loakan, some ten kilometers from downtown Baguio. The main building, Melchor Hall, was completed in 1949 under the supervision of military engineer Lt. Pacifico C. Cabrera, a decorated WWII hero, who later as a full colonel, became Chief of Engineers of the AFP. During the 1960s, as a need for more well-rounded individuals was found to be desirable, and socio- humanistic courses were added to the school's curriculum. 1993 proved a momentous year for the PMA as its first female cadets were admitted and specialization based on branch-of-service was introduced into the curriculum. The first female cadets graduated from the Academy in 1997. In 1998, a proclamation by the President of the Philippines, while acknowledging the academy's traditional roots lay with the 1905 founding of the Philippine Constabulary school, changed the official celebration day of the academy to October 25, in honour of the Academia Militar which was established on October 25, 1898 in Malolos, Bulacan. Other sources have since acknowledged this change. The Academia Militar was opened during the establishment of the insurgent First Philippine Republic. It was closed on January 20, 1899, before the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War and thus was the first ever all-Filipino military academy to be established. Curriculum =Academic Program= Headed by the Dean of Academics, the Academic Program has both military and civilian male and female instructors. It has the following seven departments: * Department of Managerial Sciences * Department of Mathematics * Department of Humanities * Department of Physical Sciences * Department of Engineering Sciences * Department of Social Sciences * Department of Information and Computing Scienceshttps://www.pma.ph/acadProgram.php On June 1 2019, the PMA upgraded its academic curriculum; every cadet now focuses on national security management in response to growing national security threat. Upon completing and graduating from 4 year program, cadets will earn the degree of BS National Security Management and will be commissioned as 2nd Lieutenant or Ensign in the tri-services of the AFP.https://businessmirror.com.ph/2019/05/27/pma- training-now-focuses-on-national-security-management/ =Military Program= This program is headed by the Commandant of Cadets and is responsible for the professional military training, character development, leadership, and physical training of the cadets. The mission of the Tactics Group is likewise carried out by the tactical officers who are responsible for the different companies of the Cadet Corps. This group is made up of the following departments: * Department of Leadership Development * Department of Physical Education * Department of Ground Warfare * Department of Air Warfare' * Department of Naval Warfare https://www.pma.ph/milProgram.php Cadet life =Four classes= Unlike other colleges and universities, cadets are not referred to as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, or seniors. They are classified as fourth class, third class, second class, and first class cadets. * Fourthclass Cadets are the first year students. In the Academy, they are traditionally called \\"plebes\\" and are the equivalent of the college freshmen in civilian universities. The first day of plebehood starts with the Reception Ceremonies on June 1 of each year. Then, they undergo an eight week summer training or \\"beast barracks\\" during which time they are indoctrinated with the military and cadet systems of training. During this period, the plebes form the New Cadet Battalion and their training is handled by the tactical officers and upper-class cadets forming the \\"Plebe Detail.\\" After the beast barracks, the plebes are formally accepted into the ranks of the Cadet Corps in another ceremony called Incorporation which is held during the last week of May. *Thirdclass Cadets are sophomores in civilian universities, and called the \\"yearlings\\" in the Academy, starts upon completion of fourthclass year. During this period, the yearling adjusts to life as an upperclass cadet. Although they are the least ranking of the upperclass cadets, they are now entitled to the privileges of being upperclass cadets. One of their responsibilities is being a \\"buddy\\" to a plebe. As buddies, they set the examples of how a cadet should behave and they are responsible for ensuring that the plebes conform with the standards of cadetship. *Secondclass Cadets are also called the \\"cows\\". The secondclass year marks the point at which the cadet starts to specialize according to the branch of service he or she has elected to join. Thus, the secondclass cadets no longer take the same subjects as each of his or her classmates but they now take different subjects depending on their branches of service and fields of specialization. Within the cadet chain of command, the secondclass cadets now act as squad leaders. Moreover, in the absence of the firstclass cadets, they take over the responsibility of running the Cadet Corps. *Firstclass Cadets, also known as \\"immaculates\\", are the ruling class and as such they occupy the major positions of responsibility in the cadet chain of command. They are designated the chairmen and cadet-in- charge of the various committees, clubs and corps squads. They also enjoy certain privileges peculiar only to the \\"immaculates\\". Their academics are also more specialized as they now embark on the final year of their training for future officership in the Armed Forces of the Philippines. =Organization= The Cadet Corps is organized into a brigade. The highest ranking cadet, the Brigade Commander, is traditionally known as the First Captain or \\"Baron\\". https://r3.rappler.com/nation/198290-7-things-about-pma- valedictorians-barons The brigade is organized into four battalions. Within each battalion there are two companies. Companies are lettered A through H (Alfa to Hawk). First class cadets hold key leadership positions within the brigade from the First Captain down to platoon leaders within the companies. First class cadets hold the rank of cadet captain and cadet lieutenant. Second class cadets hold the rank of cadet sergeant and serve as squadleaders, third class cadets hold the rank of cadet corporal, and fourth class cadets as cadet private. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0yAYUHD3uY =Honor Code and System= The Philippine Military Academy is governed by an honor code, and it binds the cadets to the following principle ‚Äî ‚ÄúWe, the cadets, do not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate among us those who do.‚Äù. Cheating, lying, and stealing are major honor code violations. Cadets who will be charged for violating the honor code are subjected to series of trials conducted by Cadets from Honor Committee. When a cadet is found guilty for violating the honor code, he/she will be banned from cadetship. One of the most sensationalized cases was during 2014; the lying case of ex-cadet Aldrin Jeff Cudia. https://www.rappler.com/nation/cadet-cudia-appeal Admission Requirements * Natural Born Filipino Citizen * Physically fit and of good moral character * Single and has never been married * Must pass the PMA Entrance Examination * No Administrative / Criminal Case * At least High School Graduate with 85% GPA or must graduate not later than June of the year following the date of examination taken for Grade 12 students (K-12) * Height Requirement for both Male and Female is 5 feet (not to exceed 6‚Äô4‚Ä≥ for both) * At least 17 years old but not a day older than a 22 years on 1 June of the year following the date of examination taken  Controversies  = Death of Darwin Dormitorio = A 20-year-old Cadet 4th class Darwin Dormitorio died as a result of hazing inside the campus at the hands of his fellow cadets. Following the incident, the police have named seven persons of interest for his death. = Hazing videos = On October 23, 2019, two videos, dated 2017 and 2018, of torture by the cadets were uploaded on social media. The 2018 video shows a cadet being punched and kicked by a fellow cadet. Another cadet wearing earphones is seen in the background of the video. In the video, two cadets were doing squats; when one of them collapses, he is kicked as punishment by an upperclassman. The attack stops when someone opens the door to inspect the room. The 2017 video shows four upperclassmen with two plebes. An upperclassman is seen using his helmet to repeatedly hit one of the plebe's hands and the other's back. While the upperclassman attacks the plebes, the other cadets in the background were seen watching and laughing, actively bystanding and allowing the torture to continue. Of the six upper-class cadets seen attacking the plebes in the video, five were transferred to the PMA holding center while the academy investigated the incident; on the other hand, the sixth cadet was discharged from the academy due to an \\"Honor Code\\" violation.

In 1907 Ivan Vasilyevich Tikhomirov. a merchant from Saratov, purchased the house and rebuilt it into a villa. The Yalta architect Lev Nikolayevich Shapovalov was givin the project. The villa construction was finished by the autumn of 1912. The issue of Russian Riviera dated by 16 September 1912, posted an announcement about opening of a comfortably furnished hotel \\"Villa Elena\\" on Yalta sea-front promenade. It was named after Tikhomirov's daughter Elena. More detailed information about the new hotel was published in the guidebooks of that time: > \\"A four- storeyed building constructed in 1912 in the style of modern after > the project by architect L.N.

It forms part of the greater Table Bay Nature Reserve, proclaimed in June 2012.  Location  The Milnerton Racecourse Nature Reserve, formerly also known as Royal Ascot Conservation Area, is situated in Royal Ascot, Milnerton, South Africa.Planning in Balance environmental management & consulting. 2007. Royal Ascot Environmental Management System, January 2007. It consists of the land inside the tracks of the former Milnerton Racecourse and is now managed by the City of Cape Town's Environmental Resource Management Department.  History  The land inside the track of the Milnerton Racecourse has remained relatively untouched by development as well as free of invasive alien plants due to the removal of tall alien trees that would obstruct views of the running horses.  Management  The Milnerton Racecourse Nature Reserve comprises two non- contiguous natural areas separated and surrounded by the up-market residential development of Royal Ascot. The management of these two areas resides with the City of Cape Town as the landowner. This is accomplished through the Environmental Management Committee which comprises several stakeholders including the Royal Ascot Master Property Owners Association and Gold Circle (owners of the Milnerton Racecourse). The Environmental Management Committee is responsible for the implementation of the Environmental Management System. = Environmental Management Committee = The Environmental Management Committee was established as a condition of the approval of the application for rezoning of the Milnerton Racecourse land (Erf 25939) from Private Open Space to Sub-divisional Area, by the local authority, City of Cape Town: Blaauwberg Administration in terms of the Land Use Planning Ordinance No 15 of 1985 and by the Department of Environmental and Cultural Affairs and Sport in terms of the Environmental Conservation Act No 73 of 1989. The subdivided erf 25939 is now known as the Royal Ascot Development.  Access  Because of the botanical importance of this conservation area, botanists recommended that the southern portion of the racetrack not be opened to the public. The northern portion is accessible to the public where there is a footpath. Access to take dogs on a leash through this area was allowed in the past, but now dogs are no longer allowed there.  Biodiversity  = Geology and vegetation = The Milnerton Racecourse Nature Reserve has an unusual geology consisting of neutral to slightly acidic sand on ferricrete. It is one of the last natural habitats situated on ferricretes, from where the name Ysterplaat is derived. The vegetation comprises Cape Flats Sand Fynbos, although some elements of Cape Flats Dune Strandveld also occur here. There are 232 recorded plant species of which 12 have ‚ÄúRed Data‚Äù status including Cliffortia ericifolia, Hermannia procumbens ssp. procumbens, Leucadendron levisanus, Acrolophia bolusii and Lampranthus stenus. = Water and fauna = There are two small wetlands in the area, but during winter several more small temporary wetlands develop, providing habitat for more than 70 bird species. At least 10 species of butterflies and moths have been recorded. There was a small population of steenbok, but they have disappeared from the area. There is however still a population of grysbok in both the northern and southern parts of the reserve. ; Updated from South African Biodiversity Database (http://www.biodiversity.co.za/) as species present on 2011/01/05 # Aonyx capensis (Cape clawless otter) # Atilax paludinosus (water mongoose) # Bathyergus suillus (Cape dune molerat) # Cryptochloris asiatica (Cape golden mole) # Galerella pulverulenta (small grey mongoose) # Genetta tigrina (large- spotted genet) # Georychus capensis (Cape mole-rat) # Hystrix africaeaustralis (porcupine) # Lepus capensis (Cape hare) # Raphicerus campestris (steenbok) # Raphicerus melanotis (Cape grysbok) # Rhabdomys pumilio (striped mouse, striped field mouse) # Tatera afra (Cape gerbil) ;

In the near future, a large spaceship arrives and hovers over Los Angeles. A human fighter squadron is scrambled, but their missiles act erratically due to countermeasures being broadcast from the ship. The entire squadron is quickly destroyed, except for a female pilot named Lt. Solano, who ejects from her plane before it is destroyed. Smaller alien craft suddenly attack a military base near Los Angeles. Marine Lt. Tyler Laughlin leads a group of survivors through the chaos following the attack, trying to find a safe haven. During their journey across the Los Angeles wasteland, Laughlin's group finds a surprisingly young World War II pilot named Captain Pete Rodgers. He claims his squadron was abducted by aliens back in 1942 while they were flying in the Bermuda Triangle. Rodgers joins Laughlin's group, as well as Lt. Solano. Soon, the group encounters a sword-wielding special agent named Karla Smaith who takes them to a top-secret underground bunker. She reveals that a secret branch of the government has held an alien captive for the past 60 years after his spaceship crashed. Just then, Rodgers reveals himself to be an android. He kills most of the base personnel and reveals the alien's plans for the colonization of Earth and the extermination of the human race. After destroying Rodgers, Laughlin, Smaith and Solano escape using the captured alien's spacecraft. They travel to the alien mothership over the city, where they plan to destroy it and stop the alien invasion. Once on board the mothership, they encounter a large mollusk-like alien guarding the engines. The alien grabs Solano and Smith and Laughlin try to save her, but she orders them not to and leave her, in order to concentrate on destroying the ship with planted explosives. They escape just as the ship explodes, crashing down on Los Angeles. Smaith and Laughlin watch the destruction, knowing the rest of Earth is safe. Cast *Nia Peeples as Capt.

Distribution Idotea balthica has a broad geographical distribution, having been recorded from the Belgian Exclusive Economic Zone, The British Isles, Cobscook Bay, Dutch Exclusive Economic Zone, European waters, Greek Exclusive Economic Zone, Gulf of Maine, Knokke, North West Atlantic, Red Sea, Voordelta, West Coast of Norway, Wimereux and the Black Sea. Characteristics The male is larger than female, and can reach long. The carapace is yellow, brown or green with small white spots; the female is usually darker. The species can be distinguished from other idoteids by the shape of the telson, which is dorsally keeled with straight sides in I. balthica, and has a distinct spine at the end. Foraging In the Baltic, I. balthica prefers Fucus vesiculosus, an algal seaweed, as host plant over other algae and vascular plants. The apical and basal parts of F. vesiculosus differ as food and as shelter, and males grow faster when fed with the apical parts, but females grow equally well with both.

Tracing its origins back to 1990, it was successively edited by various figures in contemporary Romanian literature, among them Ioan T. Morar, Ioan Buduca, Radu G. ≈¢eposu and Mircea Martin. Between 2008 and 2009, its editor in chief was literary critic Paul Cernat. History Cuv√¢ntul was created as an independent review, one of several to emerge after the December 1989 Revolution toppled the Romanian communist regime. It counts as its immediate forerunner the political newspaper Opinia Studen≈£eascƒÉ (\\"Student Opinion\\"), published in the last days of 1989, but rejects all association with Cuv√¢ntul, the far right newspaper of the interwar period. Despre noi , at the Cuv√¢ntul official site ; retrieved December 29, 2010 R«ézvan ≈¢upa, \\"OdƒÉ pentru securi≈ütii tri≈üti\\" , in »òapte Seri; retrieved January 6, 2011 The first issue of Cuv√¢ntul magazine, originally a weekly, saw print in January 1990, and its first editorial staff comprised Morar, Lorin Vasilovici and Florin Pa≈ünicu; since the twin issue 8-9/1990, they were replaced with ≈¢eposu (as director), Buduca (editor in chief) and Dumitru Stan (editorial director, later replaced by George ≈¢ara). In 1993, the staff was again restructured: ≈¢eposu kept his office as director, while Buduca became literary and artistic editor, and Mircea ≈¢icudean was made the editor in chief. Starting 1995, the magazine became a monthly. Its new series, carrying the subtitle RevistƒÉ de culturƒÉ (\\"Cultural Magazine\\"), had ≈¢eposu for its director, Buduca as editorial director and critic Tudorel Urian as editor in chief. Since ≈¢eposu's death in late 1999, Cuv√¢ntul pays him homage by mentioning him as \\"founding director\\" on the title page of each issue. Beginning with issues 3-4/2003, literary historian Mircea Martin was made senior editor, and gave the review its new editorial line, as explained during the first series of Cuv√¢ntul conferences; Buduca was at the time appointed editor in chief (replaced with Laura Albulescu in 2005, then RƒÉzvan »öupa in 2006). The subtitle was changed to RevistƒÉ de culturƒÉ ≈üi atitudine (\\"Cultural and Opinion Magazine\\"). In 2006, however, Martin announced that tensions between himself and the management of Cuv√¢ntuls publishing company (Editura Cuv√¢ntul) caused the magazine to go on hold, and its editorial staff to resign. \\"Revista revistelor\\" , in Apostrof, Nr. 10 (197)/2006 Martin and Laura Albulescu went on to establish a publishing venture, Editura Art. Ion Simu≈£, \\"Salut unei noi edituri\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 3/2008 Their departure was received with regret by fellow literary magazines: Apostrof called Martin's edition of the review \\"splendid\\" and its conferences \\"exceptional\\"; in a later article for Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ review, critic Ion Simu≈£ referred to the Cuv√¢ntul conference cycle as \\"famous\\". The last conference held under Martin's management was dedicated to the work and legacy of interwar literary theorist E. Lovinescu. In 2007, the magazine was published by the trio of RƒÉzvan ≈¢upa, Cosmin Per≈£a and Teodor DunƒÉ, during which time its format grew to 48 pages. Cronicar, \\"Actualitatea\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 29/2007 Beginning with issues 8-9/2008, Cuv√¢ntul inaugurated a third series, with Paul Cernat as editor in chief and the new subtitle RevistƒÉ de sintezƒÉ ≈üi orientare (\\"A Magazine of Synthesis and Orientation\\"). Echipa , at the Cuv√¢ntul official site ; retrieved December 29, 2010 The change also brought a new conference cycle, which focused on the historical development of Romanian culture within its Central and Eastern European context, with such themes as the cultural history of Greater Romania, the regional spread of modernism, the characteristics of popular history in European countries, or the interwar intellectuals' support for eugenics and racism. In this context, the magazine also launched the book collection ADDENDA Cuv√¢ntul. Cuv√¢ntuls new projects were touched by controversy in 2008, when researcher Sorin Antohi became involved in its \\"Greater Romania\\" conference. At the time, other press venues published revelations that Antohi had falsified some of his academic credentials, and that he had been, in his youth, an informer of the communist secret police (the Securitate). In his column for »òapte Seri magazine, RƒÉzvan ≈¢upa noted that, based on such revelations, Cuv√¢ntul would discontinue its relationship with Antohi, and suggested that the infiltration of \\"sad Securitate people\\" on the review's staff was equivalent to the interwar Cuv√¢ntul having become a mouthpiece for the fascist Iron Guard.

On 14 July 2010, it was announced that the exhibit would be called Penguin Encounter in addition to a number of facts about the exhibit. On 26 December 2010, Penguin Encounter officially opened to the public. Five months later in May 2011, Penguin Encounter received the Zoo and Aquarium Association award for best exhibit. In June 2011, Sea World began offering the Penguin Antarctic Adventure where guests can pay to interact with the penguins and see behind- the-scenes.

Penguins Penguin Encounter was originally home to 12 penguins all of which were moved from New Zealand (presumably from Kelly Tarlton's Underwater World) two weeks before opening. Half of the penguins are king penguins with the other half being gentoo penguins. A further 12 penguins (10 gentoo and 2 king) were introduced in March 2011. In December 2011, Sea World welcomed a gentoo penguin chick to the exhibit making the exhibit feature 17 gentoo and 8 king penguins.

On 22 June 1535, James V of Scotland confirmed Mariotta and George's ownership of lands forfeited by Alexander Home, 3rd Lord Home in return for their good service against the English enemy.Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, 1513-1546, HM General Register House, Edinburgh, (1883), nos. 772, 1480, 1552. At war Hume Castle where Mariotta faced the English army. As the war of the Rough Wooing escalated, Regent Arran sent soldiers and guns to help defend their Castle at Hume. The English defeated the Scottish army at Pinkie near Musselburgh on Saturday 10 September 1547. Alexander Home was taken prisoner, and George was injured, and while he lay sick in Edinburgh, the English army arrived at Hume on 20 September. Mariotta herself negotiated the surrender of Hume Castle with the Earl of Somerset. Her instructions were brought to the castle by Somerset Herald and her sons Andrew and John agreed to surrender. The 78 Scottish soldiers within were allowed to leave, and Andrew handed the keys to the new English captain, Sir Edward Dudley.Patten, William, The Expedition in Scotland 1547, London (1548), unfoliated. George and her eldest son, Alexander, were taken to England and the Tower of London. Mariotta continued to write to the Earl of Somerset seeking a better deal for her own family and the border people. She complained that people in Scotland said she had given up Hume Castle for money, and marvelled that they thought she could the keep the sober barmkin of Hume against the whole English army, while the whole Scottish nobility could not keep the field. Mariotta told the Earl that she dared not show her husband his letter and the pledges her people had made to England, and asked him to make new agreements that risked only their possessions, not their loyalty to Scotland.Bain, Joseph, ed., Calendar of State Papers relating to Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 36, no. 75. Eventually Alexander was allowed back to Scotland, and soon on Boxing Day 1548, Hume was taken from the English by a night raid. On 28 December Mariotta sent the news from Edinburgh to Mary of Guise, who had left Holyroodhouse for New Year at Stirling Castle.Cameron, Annie I., (1927), 280-281. By March 1549, Mariotta was back at Hume with a garrison of French and Spanish troops. Now she wrote to Mary of Guise that the troops were disturbing the villagers because they would not pay for their groceries; Mariotta insisted Guise pay the soldiers so they would not trouble the poor folk of Hume.Cameron, Annie I., (1927), 296-297. In another letter she advised Guise to maintain discipline amongst the soldiers at this crucial time for the Auld Alliance; > \\"Your grace maun be very scherp batht on the Franch men and on the Scottis > men, or it will nocht be weill; yet ader (either) to do as aferis to tham or > lat it be, they mecht never getin sa gud ane tym. Pardon me that writtis sa > hamly to your grace for in gud feth it cumis of gud hart as [any] that > loifis bath the honour of Scotland and Frans.\\"Cameron, Annie I., (1927), > 291-292, Hume, 8 March 1548/9. Mariotta's original letters to Somerset and Guise are kept in the National Library of Scotland and the Public Record Office at Kew. An English eyewitness, William Patten, described the bloodless siege after Pinkie and Mariotta's role. Patten cited a French proverb, that the siege was ended by a 'talking castle, and a woman who listens.'Patten, in Tudor Tracts (1903), p.143. Jean de Beaugu√©, who later joined the French army at the Siege of Haddington, also gave an account of the siege, which praises Lady Home's resolve and emphasises the role her fears for her eldest son may have played in the negotiation.Beaugu√©, Jean de, History of the Campaigns of 1548 and 1549, (1707), 77-82, see external links, French text (1830) available. Legacy Mariotta's grandson, Alexander Home, 1st Earl of Home married Mary (Dudley) Sutton a granddaughter of Edward Dudley the English captain of Hume. In 1617 this Anglo-Scottish marital union was celebrated by her kinsman and poet David Hume of Godscroft in the Muses Welcome to the High and Mighty Prince James. Godscroft pictured the marriage as an epitome of the union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland, writing that Mary Dudley's hand now restored the houses and castles formerly destroyed in border warfare.Muses Welcome, (Edinburgh 1617), p. 14: See Dana Sutton, ed., and trans., Lusus Poetici, (1639) References Further reading * Bain, Joseph, ed., Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (1898) * Beaugu√©, Jean de, History of the Campaigns of 1548 and 1549, (1707) 77-82.

Originally it served to train citizens to contribute to the defence of the city but by the 18th century its activities were of a purely ceremonial and social nature. Today it is based at the S√∏lyst estate north of the city. History =Early history= The first known reference to the Royal Copenhagen Shooting Society is from 1443. In the beginning it was involved with the training of citizens as part of the defence of the city but its activities had gradually become of a purely ceremonial and social nature. The society was based in the street Kompagnistr√¶de, which was named after it, where No. 16 lies today. =Outside the Western City Gate= The Society's mansion outside the Western City Gate Since the activities were hardly compatible with a location inside the fortified city, the society was granted royal permission to conduct the shooting training outside the city. This took place at various sites from 1619 and in the 1750s a permanent shooting range was established outside the Western City Gate. In 1782 the society acquired a 3.5 hectare tract of land, stretching from present day Vesterbrogade to the beach. The same year the foundation stone was laid for a mansion which was to serve as a venue for the society's social activities but due to shortage of funds construction came to a standstill several times and the building was not completed until 1787. The shooting range with the Shooting Range Wall in the 1890s When Vesterbro started to develop in the second half of the 19th century, after the city had been allowed to develop beyond its now decommissioned fortifications, the Royal Shooting Society once again found itself situated in urban surroundings. City authorities expropriated much of its grounds and in 1887, 100 years after the completion of its building, a tall wall was constructed to shield the newly established street Istedgade from stray bullets from the shooting range. The wall was built to the design of architect Ludvig Knudsen in a neo-gothic style. Ludvig Knudsen also modernized the interior of the Shooting Society's mansion in the 1890s and added a small new wing towards the gardens. =Post-World War II move to S√∏lyst= After World War II the Society moved to S√∏lyst Manor near Klampenborg north of Copenhagen, while Copenhagen Municipality acquired the old headquarters and ultimately turned the building into the Museum of Copenhagen. The society today S√∏lyst today As of 1997 the society had 138 members. Since the 16th century it has been a tradition that the Danish monarch is one of its members and this is also the case for Queen Margrethe II and Crown Prince Frederik.

He is timid, but greatly interested by what he finds in his travels with Toriko. As a result, he tries to overcome his fear and does his best to help. He is a highly skilled and competent chef and has a large knowledge of foods that he knows which foods would work well. He is the only chef in the world who knows the complete recipe of the Century Soup. He keeps a baby Wall Penguin as a pet, which is also a key element of the soup. Toriko decided on Komatsu as the chef in his bishoku-ya and chef combo, which Komatsu accepted, (though Zebra and Sani have also indicated a desire for Komatsu to form a combo with them). Despite Komatsu's small stature, he has shown remarkable courage in situations in which he might very well be killed. It is also revealed that despite his looks, he and Toriko are of the same age. He is also one of the few people who is able to get along amicably with all four Heavenly Kings. After gaining global recognition for finding a simple method to prepare Yuda's \\"Medical Cooking Mochi,\\" Komatsu was put into the list of top 100 chefs in the world, ranked at 88. *Century Soup: This legendary soup causes anyone who eats it to form a silly smile of utter satisfaction. Komatsu manages to recreate it after half of a year of experimentation. He decides not to apply to patent the recipe because the Wall Penguins would become over- hunted. *Derous Knife: A knife made by Melk II. Using a Derous Fang and Komatsu's broken knife, she made this knife that Komatsu uses to prepare countless dishes, as its sharpness has the potential to reach even legendary ingredients. Due to being created from Komatsu's broken knife, he is able to handle its unbelievable sharpness. *Food Luck: Apparently Komatsu has the ability to listen to the 'voice' of ingredients, thereby determining their whereabouts and how to prepare them. His Food Luck is so high that he is able to sense extremely hard to find, high-level ingredients instinctively.  Organizations and Groups  = Four Heavenly Kings = Coco * (TV series) \\"The Gentleman\\" of the \\"Four Heavenly Kings,\\" is good friends with Toriko. He earns most of his living by working as a fortune-teller, which also makes him extremely popular with women. While Toriko mostly relies on his brute strength, Coco prefers using stealth techniques and strategy to subdue aggressors. He has exceptional vision, where he can see in the dark and can read electromagnetic auras in order to predict a beast's next action. His specialty is poison: he has developed immunity to over 500 different kinds, and with newer poisons, generates antibodies to counter them.Toriko anime, episode 4, \\"The Deadly Cave Battle! Fire, Five-Fold Spiked Punch!\\" He attacks by converting his body fluids into poison and shooting them like projectiles with various dosages. Sunny ; * (TV series) : One of the \\"Four Heavenly Kings,\\" he is Rin's older brother. He is a calm and collected pretty boy who judges the beauty of people's actions and speaks in an elegant, almost flirting manner. He has a way of knocking without touching the target, mostly related to his \\"sensor\\" talent which allows him to know the physical state of those around him. His sensor is actually thousand upon thousands of super thin hairs with incredible strength and maneuverability. Although the individual hairs are very strong and no Human World creatures can cut them, if his hairs are cut, he feels a sense of pain equal to pulling a tooth for each hair. Sunny has developed techniques to manage the pain so it does not overwhelm him. Since mastering \\"Food Honor\\" at Shokurin Temple, the total number of \\"sensors\\" or \\"feelers\\" he can control is 1,000,000 and the range of his feelers is 300 meters. Sunny's body has a very high body temperature and powerful sense of touch, being touched by his hair or any part of his body can only be described as Sunny tasting whatever he is touching. He seeks \\"harmony\\" in his dishes, defined as the perfect use of ingredients, perfect handling of the food, and most importantly producing the perfect taste. He also expresses a great sense of disgust towards the Bishoku-kai, displaying anger after seeing the slaughtered creatures without a bite taken out of them that followed a GT Robo's path of destruction. Sunny has an animal partner, a juvenile Mother Snake named Quinn. He and the other Four Heavenly Kings were trained by Ichiry≈´, the president of the IGO. The Heavenly King who Sunny gets along with the least is Zebra as his appearance and brutal behavior disgusts him. Hunting Method: Sunny hunts by using his hair to capture his prey. He can also use it to stop and counter enemy attacks. *Intimidation: Like most of the other hunters, including the other kings, Sunny uses a form of intimidation to scare an enemy into surrender. However, because of his love of beauty Sunny only uses intimidation when his foe has truly disgusted him, such as when he encounters the GT Robo responsible for taking a single bite out of the creatures of an area and leaving them to rot. His intimidation is the creation of an evil spirit out of his hair, which also makes his intimidation the only one openly visible and not just sensed by killing intent. Zebra ; * (TV series) : Described by Toriko as the most powerful of the \\"Four Heavenly Kings\\" for his pure destructive capabilities, Zebra is a very large and well- built man with scars that cover most of his body, one of the more striking ones being the half Glasgow smile on the left side of his face. His personality is very angry and small-tempered, he enjoys fighting the most out of all the Heavenly Kings and has a self-professed hatred for anyone or anything acting \\"cocky\\". He is incredibly strong, and until recently, he was held in \\"Honey Prison\\" for eating 26 species of beasts to the point of extinction. He and the other Four Heavenly Kings were trained by Ichiry≈´, the president of the IGO. Zebra has the power to both hear and send out ultrasonic waves, as well as the ability to hear even the faintest sounds from tens of kilometers away. Originally, Zebra did not intend to have a Full Course Menu, preferring to just seek out delicious food around the world and eat it. However, as part of the conditions he made with Komatsu to give his help in obtaining the Mellow Cola, Zebra promised to make a better Full Course Menu than Toriko, and if he did so, Komatsu would have to form a combo with him instead of Toriko. Hunting Method: Zebra hunts by using his mammoth body and strength, as well as his ability to create massive bursts of \\"sound\\", capable of breaking steel and killing animals with one hit. His voice can travel up to 70 kilometers. = Gourmet Hunters = ; * (TV series) : A very arrogant and annoying Gourmet Hunter who wields a large axe to hunt. Zongeh has straight black hair and a beard, as well as a very ugly face with scars, and a slightly fat, muscled body with lots of body hair. He is very self-centered and boasts about his completed full course menu which is made of dishes that are mostly easy to obtain. Despite all his boasting he is a very big coward using others as shields and making excuses when confront by a beast he can't take down. A running gag is that people forget his name, thinking his name is a zombie or a zombie movie or something else entirely. He's not very knowledgeable in the world of Gourmet Hunters, such as not knowing about National Treasure Setsuno and thinking that the Growlus (Level 13) is the strongest animal in the world. He also seems to confuse real life with the RPGs that he often plays. For the most part, he serves as comedy relief for the series. Around the end of the series, it is revealed that Zongeh possesses one of the largest amounts of Gourmet Luck in the series according to Midora. ; * (TV series) : \\"Knocking Master\\" Jiro is a retired Gourmet Hunter whose Full Course Menu of Life has beasts of immeasurable levels. He initially appears as a small, drink-loving old man with a scraggly white beard on his chin and a ducktail hairstyle, however, he is able to transform into a giant. He carries an assortment of knocking tools in his vest, and is also able to revive and heal people with his tools.Toriko anime, episode 5, \\"The Knocking Master! Time to Taste the Puffer Whale!\\" Jiro is the grandfather of the Saiseya Teppei, who has also inherited his Knocking talent. He is one of the three disciples of the legendary Bishoku-ya, Acacia, along with Ichiry≈´, head of IGO, and the boss of the Bishoku-kai, of the three he is the only one that does not the head of an organization, as well as being the only one in retirement. When Jir≈ç was younger, he had a wild, dangerous personality and had part of his power sealed by Acacia so that he could be taught Knocking and other techniques. In addition to his various Knocking tools, Jir≈ç also has a handheld gauntlet with various spikes coming out of it that he only uses in incredibly serious battles, known as the \\"Fangs of the Wolf King\\". Hunting Method: Jir≈ç uses his mastery of Knocking to paralyze and defeat wild beasts, but can also use Knocking to revive and alter organic tissue. He also has a good amount of physical strength, having a hand chop that feels like an axe chop to Toriko, and is able to freely survive in the Gourmet World, although he has to stop drinking when he enters so he has more focus *Intimidation Knocking: Jir≈ç uses Knocking to enlarge his muscles and other tissue to appear like a giant, and then uses \\"Intimidation\\" to paralyze beasts and humans alike, like he would with a Knocking gun. *Knocking Rifle Hard Type: Using a long range, high- difficulty Knocking rifle, Jir≈ç fires at wild beasts and paralyzes them through Knocking. Despite his rifle being described as having a high difficulty, he is proficient enough to fire on hundreds of beasts and paralyze each in one shot. * Rising Wolf - Guinness Punch: Using his \\"Fangs of the Wolf King,\\" Jir≈ç punches upward and sends out a large attack in the shape of a wolf upward toward the opponent or target. Jir≈ç claims the attack can reach all the way up into space. * Grand Knocking: Jir≈ç delivers a strong punch the ground and halts the movement of not only all living things on the planet temporarily(but Joa was able resist it) and slows down very rotation of the planet itself. In the aftermath of this technique, the planet is rocked by massive natural disasters as a result of the Earth's rotation stopping. = IGO = ; * (TV series) : The President of IGO, he has the appearance of an old man with dark skin and blond hair, along with a long blond mustache. Despite his old age, he is not yet retired, although seems to vacation frequently, spending time on a private island resort. Ichiry≈´ used to be a very powerful Bishoku-ya and is one of the three disciples of the legendary Bishoku-ya, Acacia, along with Jir≈ç and Midora, the boss of the Bishoku-kai. Since then, he trained all of the Four Heavenly Kings personally and considers them his sons. Even in his old age, he is powerful and can defeat Toriko effortlessly in a fight and perform inhuman actions, such as running on water, and is purportedly strong enough to defeat all the members of the Bishoku-kai, with the exception of Midora, single-handedly. In addition to his incredible strength, Ichiryuu has several other abilities that put him far above a human level. He possesses a \\"gravity\\" of presence rather than mass, but it still allows him to gradually repel or attract those around him. Ichiryuu is also capable of using the \\"minority\\" atoms in his body - those that act in disregard of traditional physics - to do things such as fly or float in mid- air. This is based on a principle that the square root of any atoms in an object will act in this \\"exceptional\\" way. * Chopsticks: Like Toriko's \\"Fork and Knife\\" and Chin Chinchin's \\"Spoon,\\" Ichiryuu uses a utensil-like weapon in order to fight. Unlike those two, however, instead of forming his hand in the shape of \\"chopsticks,\\" he holds his hand as if he was holding chopsticks \\" and materialize \\"chopsticks\\" out of Appetite Energy. He can produce chopsticks of varying sizes, but they are strong enough to stop powerful Gourmet World beasts and even Midora, the head of the Bishoku-kai. :* Utshiri Bashi: Ichiryuu creates a large number of \\"chopsticks\\" in order to grab multiple targets. \\"Utshiri Bashi\\" is a Japanese phrase meaning to skip from plate to plate with chopsticks without pausing to eat rice. :*Sashi Bashi: Ichiryuu powerfully jabs with his \\"chopsticks\\" at a target. \\"Sashi Bashi\\" is a Japanese phrase for pointing at someone or something with one's chopsticks, which is considered impolite. :*Seseri Bashi: Ichiryuu makes several quick jabs with his \\"chopsticks,\\" which what appears to be a lower level of power than the \\"Sashi Bashi\\". \\"Seseri Bashi\\" is a Japanese phrase for playing with one's food with one's chopsticks. :*Nigiri Bashi: Instead of holding his \\"chopsticks\\" in the traditional way, Ichiryuu can hold them with his full hand like a spear. Using his \\"chopsticks\\" this way reduces their accuracy but greatly increases their power. \\"Nigiri Bashi\\" is a Japanese phrase for holding chopsticks the way Ichiryuu does with this move, which is considered impolite. :*Chopstick Cannon: After using \\"Nigiri Bashi,\\" Ichiryuu throws one of his \\"chopsticks\\" powerfully at the enemy. :*Disorder Chopsticks: Ichiryuu throws out a volley of \\"Chopstick Cannons\\". :*Ougi: Single Chopstick: Seemingly Ichiryuu's finishing move, he uses \\"Nigiri Bashi\\" and drops a single \\"chopstick\\" powerfully down on an opponent. :*All-Meal King Eating Chopsticks: Ichiryuu's true final move, he throws one massive chopstick directly at the opponent. Contained within that chopstick are actually numerous \\"Chopstick Cannons\\" that batter the opponent heavily. * Minority World: Taking Ichiryuu's control over his \\"minority atoms\\" to the extreme, he gives all of the stray \\"minority atoms\\" in the area around him power, fundamentally changing the physical properties around him. Solids turn soft, air becomes thick, and most importantly, the atoms inside his opponent's body can stop function as they should. This means that nerve signals are not sent effectively and eventually, organs begin to shut down. ; * (TV series) : The Vice-President of IGO, he is a very large, muscular man with a big, black beard and mustache and thick, black hair with a stripe of white hair down the middle. He keeps one eye closed at all times, as well as a nose plug over the bridge of his nose. When these are removed, which he does when preparing to fight Grinpatch, he becomes more beastly and his muscles bulge and his clothes begin to tear. When Grinpatch comes to the First Biotope, he is disappointed that Starjun or Tommyrod had not come, showing not only his delight in fighting, but also his knowledge of the Bishoku-kai. Shigematsu is also secretly a member of NEO against his will, an organization that opposes both the IGO and the Bishoku- kai and ordered the killing of the IGO bureau chiefs and personally attacked Mansam. He is eventually fatally wounded by Toriko with one blow and is freed from Joie's Taste Change and dies as the man he used to be. ; * (TV series) : IGO's Development Bureau Director and Gourmet Research Facility Chief, he holds IGO's third position, with authority below the CEO and President. Mansam is a large, muscular man whose bald head is covered in scars and what appears to be the heads of screws. He also has a thin mustache and very thick eyebrows. He is an old friend of Toriko's and has the same body type. He runs IGO's Garden One, a facility where 30% of the world's gourmet foods are made. It also clones long extinct animals and performs selective breeding. He has an incredibly high pain tolerance, able to live through being stabbed in the gut and a hole blown through his throat, and he heals himself by drinking alcohol. Instead of using Knocking to enhance his muscles, like Knocking Master Jiro does, Mansam appears to have sealed away his true strength and uses Knocking to return to his monstrous, muscular, and feral state. When someone says his name he thinks they are calling him handsome; this is a pun as his name sounds similar to the English word \\"handsome\\". He seems to be always drunk or just in a really happy state most of the time, only when someone mentions a job that needs doing or when he is gets angry does he change to a more serious manner. When he was younger, Mansam was a part of a large clan of bandits and was considerably more vicious, but after meeting with Ichiryuu, he appears to have reformed his ways. *Techniques: *Intimidation: The same as Toriko's and Coco's except Mansam projects the image of an Ashura, with eight arms instead of the six arms. *Fry Panch: It is a pun on the Japanese \\"pan\\" and \\"punch\\" being pronounced similarly. The technique is similar to Toriko's Fork and Knife except this is a punch, and the arm is shaped like a frying pan. *Fry Pan Sandwich: Fry Panch using both hands slams in from opposite sides, hence the \\"sandwich\\". *Wanted Punch: Used when Mansam is in his fully released \\"Knocked\\" form, this is a powerful downward punch that has the strength to burst apart even a large, reinforced GT Robo. ; * (TV series) : A tomboyish pheromone and other odor composition user who acts as a beast handler at the gourmet Coliseum, a fighting ring run by IGO that pits beast against each other to both validate the accuracy of CLVL rankings and as entertainment for world officials, her nickname is \\"the wild beast tamer\\". Rin has short black hair and a scar on her cheek, which she gave herself trying to replicate Toriko's three scars, but stopped at one when she saw she put them on the wrong side. As indicated by her desire to replicate his scars, she has a crush on Toriko, and blushes whenever he talks to her (even if he just says her name) or does something kind. After Toriko's return from the Gourmet World, Rin and Toriko become engaged after Toriko accepts her marriage proposal. She is the younger sister of one of the Four Heavenly Kings, Sunny. She has also been implanted with Gourmet Cells. : Pheromones are how she handles beasts. She uses two wrist-mounted gas sprayers to shoot pheromones as well as control their level of dilution. *Battle Fragrance: Derived from the Battle Flower on an island where battle never ends, the flower affects the animal's central nervous system making them violent while at the same time stimulating the body into its peak form, because of this it is also called the \\"doping flower\\". *Super Relaxing Fragrance: Created from the pheromones of the Nikoniko Manatee, it relaxes nervous female manatee during mating season. The pheromone has been adapted by humans and is used in animal therapy. *Endorphin Smoke: A smoke laced with a high endorphin, use is restricted by law. *Thunder Peppermint: Rin's strongest scented fragrance, it is concentrated menthol taken from dried peppermint leaves; the scent is compared to that of lightning. One sniff is enough to keep one awake for five days. *Devil Durian Fragrance: The fragrance exploits the extract of the \\"Devil Durian\\". Its stench is powerful enough to repel bugs to up to half a kilometer radius. Bureaus The IGO, being a massive global organization, is made of up several bureaus to manage all of its affairs. *IGO Defense Bureau : The director of this bureau is Ray, a young man with shoulder-length black hair, eye-shadow on his eyelids, and a long dark robe. Among his duties are taking care of \\"Nitro\\" that appear in the Human World. *IGO Business Bureau : The director of this bureau is Uumen Umeda, a middle aged man with sunglasses and a distinctive 5 'o' clock shadow. He is the one who commissioned Toriko to retrieve the Galala Crocodile in the beginning of the series. Uumen Umeda is also secretly a member of NEO, an organization that opposes both the IGO and the Bishoku-kai and personally killed the other bureau chiefs with his bare hands. *IGO Administration Bureau : The director of this bureau is Wain, a young man with flat brown hair and glasses. He reports on the damage done to the IGO Biotopes. *IGO Financial Affairs Bureau : The director of this bureau is Buru, an older man with many scars and a mustache. *IGO Public Relations Bureau : The director of this bureau is Naroid, a black man in a business suit. *IGO Judicial Affairs Bureau : The director of this bureau is Glass, a middle-aged man with a dark burn covering part of his face. He oversees the gourmet police, although when Ichiryuu and Yosaku went to Honey Prison, also overseen by the Judicial Affairs Bureau, he calls Glass useless for not being able to get Zebra released. ; Honey Prison Warden Love * (TV series) : The warden of the Gourmet Prison \\"Honey Prison\\", she is a very small old woman who wears a bee costume. She is feared by all the prisoners and guards in Honey Prison and she has trained and tamed several extremely powerful beasts. Love is able to freely control her pheromones, to do things like attract the opposite sex to taming the Execution Beasts found in the prison. However, the only person her pheromones appears to not affect is Zebra, whom she has fallen in love with. In order to allow Zebra to be discharged from prison, she stipulates that he must capture 500 high-level gourmet prisoners and discover 100 new ingredients. Love is also a member of the IGO's \\"0th Biotope,\\" located in the Gourmet World. *Assistant Warden Oban : The assistant warden at Honey Prison, an extremely large man with red skin, fangs, as well as stitches and bolts covering his face. He has the appearance of typical portrayals of the devil. *Guard Captain Pricom : The captain of the guard at Honey Prison, a gourmet prison under the management of the Judicial Affairs Bureau. He has an eye patch, several scars, and gold teeth as well as a unique hairstyle that is half afro, half straight, with the top of his head being bald. *Receptionist Chupali : The receptionist at Honey Prison, a large man with a large beard, black teeth, and a large hat that obscures his eyes. He has the appearance of typical portrayals of Enma.  0th Biotope  The 0th Biotope is one of the IGO's Biotopes for studying ingredients, but it is kept secret from the rest of the world and is located in the Gourmet World. The 0th Biotope is staffed by 17 private citizens from all around the world, all hand selected by the IGO's president, Ichiryuu. Among the tasks undertaken by the 0th Biotope is the collection of Acacia's \\"Full Course\\" ingredients, as well as monitoring the Nitro beasts and fighting the Bishoku-kai. All members of the 0th Biotope have their own individual jobs as well. The members of the 0th Biotope include: Yosaku, Ryuu, Chin Chinchin, and Love. They also include: ; Melk the First (TV series) :A master craftsman, responsible for the high-quality \\"Melk Knives\\". He is reportedly very strong, testing his knives on wild animals and living at the top of a large mountain, the steps to which he carved out himself. He was the one to discover the ultimate grindstone, the \\"Melk Stardust\\", which when used to sharpen knives, produces the Golden Powder, a seasoning of incredible savoriness that creates a new form of amino acid. He has been living on the lowest level of the \\"Heavy Hole\\" for the past six years working for the 0th Biotope. Around the world, Melk is rumored to be a seclusive and quiet person, but in fact, he is a cheerful, talkative person who just has an incredibly quiet voice. It was because of this that Toriko could not understand anything he was saying when they first met, only through the use of a special stone that he recently discovered that his voice is able to be heard. The near-muteness of his voice made Melk the Second wonder how he cared for her. One of his main jobs as a member of the 0th Biotope, and his last job as a professional sharpener, was to craft a knife capable of preparing Acacia's Salad course, \\"AIR,\\" which Melk has recently completed. ; Guemon : Guemon's job is to guard the Human World on the Three-Way Road on the Wak continent, one of the few \\"Land Routes\\" that link the Human World with the Gourmet World. Guemon is the only person who lives there, and he stops powerful beasts from the Gourmet World from making their way into the Human World. Guemon is a bishokuya and he is called the \\"Gourmet Gang Leader\\", in part because his clothes are like that of a stereotypical Japanese gangster \\"banchou\\", with a long, tattered black school jacket, with a white bandana, Duck's Tail haircut, and a haramaki. Instead of using his consciousness when fighting, Guemon uses \\"intuition\\" in order to fight, sensing when and where to attack, and with great power. However, this has left Guemon with a bad habit of spacing out when talking with people, although when he is not spaced out, he talks and laughs loudly. Guemon is also armed with a katana. Sani, as part of his training to enter the Gourmet World, went to visit Guemon, learning his skill of \\"intuition\\". ; Rapp : A very large man, around the same height as Zebra, Rapp is a bishokuya and is one of the younger members of the 0th Biotope, but still has enough power, according to Mansam, to defeat the Four Heavenly Kings. Rapp wears a large helmet on his head with goggles that cover most of his face, as well as a blue and yellow track suit and black gloves. Among Rapp's duties appears to be handling the bodies of \\"Nitro\\" creatures, and carries a large suitcase with tools that help him examine or remove \\"Nitro\\". ; Malisman : A dark skinned woman with long pink hair covering one eye, she is referred to as a \\"Gourmet Literary Master,\\" and is one of the four \\"Gourmet Living National Treasures\\". ; Malee : A man in a plain yukata with very short black hair and a carefully shaped beard, Malee is described as a \\"Knocking artisan\\". His knocking appears to be based on his mastery of \\"Seitei,\\" a form of Eastern physical therapy that includes osteopathy, massage, and chiropractic methods. ; Kuribou : A very large, overweight man with a short beard and top-knot style hair, Kuribou is a world-famous pot artisan. He wears large, pot-like armor and is somewhat lackadaisical in his attitude and behavior. Kuribou is also a double agent for the IGO within Neo, an organization that opposes both the IGO and the Bishoku-kai. He's also extremely loyal to the IGO, as Ichiryuu even trusted him to rat out another member of the 0th Biotope Ichiryuu suspected of being a spy. *Gimmick Frying Pan: Kuribou uses a substitution move to direct an opponent's attack to one of his pans, which is incredibly durable. ; Manan : A bishokuya, Manan wears a flashy, stage-magician type of suit, as well as blue hair that sticks up in a partial mohawk. He also has a long mustache and yellowish skin. Manan is known as the \\"Gourmet Magician,\\" and his skill as a magician is evidenced by him being able to pour liquid into a semi-solid column resting on top of a glass. ; Tack : A very large muscular man with dark skin, Tack is a bishokuya and a member of the \\"Goro tribe\\". He has dreadlocks as well as a feathered headrest, face tattoos, multiple large ear piercings, war paint, and a fur vest, creating the look associated with aboriginal American and Australian people. Tack also has two large scars on his chest and carries some kind of staff. He also laments having to fight the Bishoku-kai, considering fighting over food to be foolish. ; Goblin Ramon : A \\"Gourmet Mountain Bandit,\\" Ramon is a tall, lanky elderly man with pink-red skin and long red hair in a ponytail and a long mustache, as well as razor sharp teeth. When the 0th Biotope was told that they may have to go to war with the Bishoku-kai, he was excited at the prospect of being morally justified in killing. ; Sakura : Sakura is a young- looking man with a winged skull headrest and spiky black hair. He is a bishokuya, but is also described as a \\"martial artist\\". When Grinpatch told Toriko about the bishokuyas who were pursuing \\"God,\\" Sakura was one of the individuals shown. ; Megarodras : An assassin, Megarodras wears black and green-fringed armor, as well as a dark, spiked helmet that covers most of his face. ; Rala : Rala is a very large and muscular man with short black hair and a small mustache, as well as a monocle that he never takes off. As well as being a bishokuya, Rala is also a \\"Gourmet Astronomer,\\" who has been tracking the progress of the \\"Gourmet Eclipse,\\" which will herald the return of \\"God\\". By Rala's estimations, the \\"Gourmet Eclipse\\" is half a year away from the 0th Biotope summit that takes place during the series. Aside from tracking the \\"Gourmet Eclipse,\\" Rala makes many other calculations, including the actions of the Bishoku-kai and the awakening of dangerous \\"Human World\\" beasts. ; Kousairou : Kousairou is a very old man with very dark skin and a long face with a long, white beard and mustache. He wears a robe and has thin, white tassels around him at all times. He is described as a \\"Gourmet Hermit,\\" and his job as a member of the 0th Biotope is to locate Acacia's \\"Drink\\" course, \\"ATOM\\". Kousairou left the 0th Biotope to attend the \\"Cooking Fest\\" to prevent the Bishoku-kai from kidnapping chefs. However, Kousairou is secretly a member of NEO, an organization which opposed both the IGO and the Bishoku-kai, so while there, he has collaborated in secret with other NEO members to take advantage of the battle between the IGO and Bishoku-kai. *Food Technique - Calorie Consumption: By placing a talisman on someone, Kousairou saps them of their energy - up to 10 million kilocalories. ; Atashino : Atashino is the 0th Biotope's chef, whose job is to cook Acacia's \\"Full Course Menu\\". Atashino is also a \\"Gourmet Surgeon,\\" and she is always wearing pink medical equipment, including a stethoscope and a surgical mask.  Gourmet Seven  The seven \\"Taste Masters\\" chosen from the chief member nations of the IGO. They are an organization of members who hold a miraculous sense of taste, said to be able to recognize the taste of a single grain of sugar in a twenty-five meter pool. They take part in important decisions of the gourmet age, such as assigning the number of stars to hotels and restaurants, and the rank of cooks, these important people also serve as inspectors for the IGO. ; Mr. Patch * : The first G7 member revealed, he goes to Komatsu's hotel when he hears a rumor of the completed Century Soup. He is assertive but not forceful; he comes to taste the soup and is surprised that Komatsu declines to serve it. He asks if there were customers before him and sees the customers (consisting of Toriko and several other important people); he does not press the matter and says he will come back at a later time. He does show concern since Komatsu completing the Century Soup would spread his name world wide, and recommends that Komatsu have \\"Bodyguard\\" from now on, to protect him from being taken by the \\"Nitro\\", which kidnap and eat prominent Human World chefs. After recognizing the taste of the Century Soup later on, he raises Hotel Gourmet's star level from five to six. ; Mr. Appalon :The second G7 member revealed, he judges the Surprise Levels of Surprise Apples and has an odd habit of speaking, emphasizing the sound of the letter E. = Bishoku-kai = Bishoku-kai (literally: Beautiful Food Organization, Gourmet Corps. in the English Dub), a rival organization to the IGO, their headquarters are Castle Shokuyokub≈ç (Appetite's Desire) located in the Forest of Sorrow, \\"Thorn Wood\\". The dining kitchen for the Bishoku-kai is on top of a large stone arc, accessible only by flying beast, and the remains from ingredients used in cooking fall below into the ocean to such an extent that they've created a new island of rotting food known as the \\"Dust Zone\\". The Bishoku-kai also has a Gourmet World headquarters, which is on top of a tall stone spire and is surrounded by wild beasts. This headquarters is also equipped with a kitchen where enslaved chefs are brought to prepare food for Midora, who lives in the Gourmet World headquarters. After the Cooking Festival arc, Bishoku-kai has been essentially crippled, with most of its members either dead or having joined with NEO. ; Midora * (TV series) : The leader of the Bishoku-kai, Midora who has three scar-like birth marks over both of his eyes, wavy, dark hair the length of his body, and a beard that sticks out on his chin and on both sides of his jaw. He has an insatiable appetite, which comes from when he grew up in crippling poverty as a child and never had enough to eat. He is extremely powerful, as he resides in the Gourmet World, and after drinking the legendary Century Soup, Alfaro notices that the increase in his Gourmet Cells is comparably small to the rest of his body. He appears to have the ability to move imperceptibly fast, leaving only an after-image that slowly fades away. As further testament to his power, he is the only person who does not smile when drinking the Century Soup. His goal, and therefore the main goal of the Bishoku-kai, is to obtain the ingredient GOD and control all of the world's ingredients. He is one of the three disciples of the great Bishoku-ya Acacia, along with Jir≈ç and Ichiry≈´. However, unlike Jir≈ç and Ichiry≈´, he appears to have retained his youth as his appearance is considerably younger than the two. Ichiry≈´ himself even comments that he looks the same from when they were younger. * Hungry Tongue: Midora's primary battle technique, he is able to make his tongue grow and stretch to incredible sizes and lengths. This \\"Hungry Tongue\\" has incredible power, able to obliterate several powerful Gourmet World beasts instantly and tear through large, sturdy islands. :* Tongue of Thorns: Midora produces several of his \\"Hungry Tongues,\\" but these are also covered in spikes. :* Tongue Shield: Midora collects his various \\"tongues\\" together into a powerful shield that can also pull the attacker in and eat them. :* Mountain Tongue: Midora produces a particularly large tongue that can create a strong attack but also guard against lighter attacks due to its size. :*Machine Gun Tongue: Midora's \\"Hungry Tongue\\" branches off into dozens of \\"tongues\\" that strikes at the target quickly. * Hungry Space: After using his \\"Hungry Tongue,\\" Midora creates a vacuum in space created by the speed and power of his tongue. This space can be filled with invisible Appetite Energy and used to \\"eat\\" away at anything in its path, and Midora claims this vacuum \\"eats\\" everything in its trail down to the atomic level. * Mirror Neurons: Midora has particularly active cells in his brain that allow him to mimic skills. Using this, he can borrow moves and techniques from his opponents, like Ichiryuu's control over \\"minority atoms.\\" He can further use this ability to give his cells a \\"camouflage,\\" letting him become effectively invisible. * Meteor Spice: The personification of Midora's \\"Gourmet Cells,\\" his rage and hunger turns into massive bursts of destructive Appetite Energy that are fired out, perhaps without Midora's control or consent. ; Dores : The Executive Chef of the Bishoku-kai, Dores is an elderly man with dark skin and thick white hair that sticks up. He also has a large mustache and beard that sticks out, much like Midora's. Dores wears a ninja-like outfit with two long knives on the back that he uses to fight with. Dores is capable of living in the Gourmet World. He has also defected to NEO, an organization that opposes both the IGO and the Bishokukai. ; Niceny * (TV series) : The Aid to the Executive Chef, Niceny has slicked back brown hair and a small mustache, as well as pointed ears and black eyes with white pupils. Niceny wears a dark, tight-fitting suit with Chinese style dragons running down the arms. He appears to have the ability to stretch out his arms, as shown when he was preparing to fight with Ichiryuu. Niceny is capable of living in the Gourmet World and is called one of the \\"Gourmet World Elite\\" by other members of the Bishoku-kai. He has also defected to NEO, an organization that opposes both the IGO and the Bishokukai. ; * (TV series) : A Head Chef of the Bishoku-kai, he has black eyes with white pupils, a thin yet long mustache, and he wears a black chef's uniform with a very tall, black chef's hat. He is one of the few Bishoku-kai members capable of living in the Gourmet World. He has also defected to NEO, an organization that opposes both the IGO and the Bishokukai. ; Boneless : A Head Chef of the Bishoku-kai, Boneless is a very large, muscular man with thick arms almost as long as his entire body. Boneless has pupil-less eyes and prominent fangs, but his most distinguishing feature is a large centipede-like creature wrapped around his entire body, with the head resting on top of his scalp. He has also defected to NEO, an organization that opposes both the IGO and the Bishokukai. ; Kariu : A Head Chef of the Bishoku-kai, Kariu is a slim man with a black, beetle-like suit covering most of his body from the back, leaving his chest exposed. He has long, blond hair and long sunglasses attached to the suit. He has also defected to NEO, an organization that opposes both the IGO and the Bishokukai. * Fly Net: Kariu chews a wad of some unknown substance and spits it out. The material falls around the target as a large, sticky cage. When used in combination with Kaitora's \\"Tablecloth,\\" it is said to be impossible to escape from. However, Ichiryuu was easily able to tear it away. ; Alfaro * (TV series) : The waiter (Garcon) of the Bishoku-kai and Kuromado's personal aide. He has a very large nose and eight arms, giving him the appearance of a spider. He also has been seen to resist the intense cold of Ice Hell while wearing just a tuxedo and cape. Alfaro is a very intelligent fighter knowing that a fight with Setsuno would result in them losing the Century Soup; this is indicated by Setsuno's ability to shatter Alfaro's plates with a glance. His attacks are all based on the plates he keeps hidden in his tuxedo, he is able to throw them fast enough to cut both the Parasite Emperor and Hellsboros (each with capture levels of 81 and 72 respectively) literally to pieces. He is one of the few Bishoku-kai members capable of living in the Gourmet World, shown when he brought the Boss his soup inside the Gourmet World. * Plate Shuriken: Alfaro throws several plates at a target at high enough speed and with enough force to cut through multiple targets at once. ; Limon : The sommelier of the Bishoku-kai, Limon is a woman of average build, with long black hair and strange markings under her eyes. She is one of the few Bishoku- kai members that Alfaro says are capable of entering the Gourmet World. *Damage Tasting: Limon appears to have the ability to transfer damage done to her to the opponent or opponents who inflicted it. This includes mortal wounds, as Limon can be shot and live while the shooter will die. ; Kaitora : The Exclusive Saiseiya of the Bishoku-kai, Kaitora is a dark-skinned man with six arms, no mouth or pupils, and has a bit of a gut. He also doesn't wear a shirt and has long tattoos down his arms. Being a saiseiya, whose duties are to protect ingredients from being abused world-wide, it is unknown what his job within the Bishoku-kai is. Kaitora is capable of living in the Gourmet World. Kaitora, along with Yosaku, were mentored by the Living Gourmet National Treasure Mohyan Shaishai and both he and Shaishai have defected to NEO. * Root of Thorns: Kaitora uses a long whip with a series of white thorns that can rip off opponent's limbs. * Tablecloth: Kaitora produces a long, sheet-like substance from his hand that is very sticky. When used in combination with Kariu's \\"Fly Net,\\" it is said to be impossible to escape from. However, Ichiryuu was easily able to tear it away. ; * (TV series) : Sous Chef of the Bishoku-kai, Starjun has long black hair, usually seen wearing a metal helmet with spikes. When he is not wearing his helmet, he has a calm face with a small dot on his forehead and dark scars on the right side of his face, covering his ear and part of his neck. He is not one to mince words and will admit his mistakes, and e.g. he operates the GT Robo that Toriko defeats in the Regal Mammoth. He appears to be noble, or at least respectful to those he considers strong, since in his fight with Toriko he set the GT Robo's pain sensors to 100% to test and feel Toriko's maximum power. Later he claims that it would be difficult to not test Toriko. He has a habit of scratching his head with one finger. He is one of the few Bishoku-kai members capable of entering the Gourmet World. Since Starjun has the roles of a bishoku-ya as well as a chef, he is in a combo with Ootake, who trained with Komatsu when he was younger. When he ate the food \\"Another\\", the food unlocks all his memories revealing that his Toriko's biological brother. * Intimidation: Like Toriko's or Mansam's intimidations, except Starjun projects a one-eyed demon. * Barbecueing: Starjun appears to have the ability to create intense heat, able to do as little as barbecuing an animal by touching to being able to create a huge amount of fire to engulf himself and others. Toriko estimates the heat of his flames to be no less than 2800 degrees Fahrenheit. * Thermal Disinfection: Starjun wraps an infected or poisoned part of his body in intense heat, killing the biological components and neutralizing the disease or poison. This disinfection is even capable to get rid of Coco's lethal poison. * Camp Fire: Starjun creates an enormous fire that surrounds himself and others. It is strong enough to dissipate Sunny's \\"Hair Lock\\" and can spread quickly in a moderate distance. Zebra's \\"Sound Armor\\" seems to be able to defend against this outburst of fire, however. :*Camp Fire Medium Flame: A concentrated form of the \\"Camp Fire\\" that Starjun envelops around himself, making it burn and blow apart structures surrounding him. :*Camp Fire Strong Flame: The most powerful form of Starjun's \\"Camp Fire\\" technique. It is the same as his other \\"Camp Fire\\" attacks, but much stronger. * Fire Shield: Starjun surrounds his hand in large flames and can catch and block attacks this way, effectively \\"melting\\" the force of the attack. :*Fire Shield Bon Fire: Using both hands to create a larger Fire Shield that can directly burn his opponents after blocking their attack. * Fire Spear: Starjun surrounds his hand with a concentrated flame and powerfully jabs his hand in a stabbing motion. * Burner Punch: Starjun covers his fist in fire and delivers a strong punch that can burn through his opponent. * Burner Shot: Starjun quickly strikes with both hands covered in flames. It appears that these attacks can also be thrown, similar to Toriko's \\"Flying Fork\\" attack. * Burner Knife: A large sword-like kitchen knife that Starjun designed to cut and grill specially prepared ingredients simultaneously. It is incredibly powerful and Starjun is perhaps at his strongest when he is fighting with it, although he has never fought against a human being with his \\"Burner Knife\\". :*Flame Tornado: Using the \\"Burner Knife,\\" Starjun creates a gigantic tornado of flame, which can both defend against attacks as well as be used offensively. :*Burner Broil Stab: Using the \\"Burner Knife,\\" Starjun delivers a drilling stab that easily pierces through enemies, severely burning them in the process. :*Single Stroke Grill Cut: An iai technqiue, Starjun gives one quick, strong slash with his \\"Burner Knife\\". ; * (TV series) : Sous Chef of the Bishoku-kai, Grinpatch can suck up large amounts of food with his giant straw and has two extra pairs of arms, gaining a second pair of arms since meeting Toriko. He has the same eyes as Kuromado and Y≈´ except he has three pupils in each eye instead of just one. For transportation and food collection, he has a pet Jack Elephant (CLVL 85), which is large and strong enough to cut down an entire ear of BB Corn and carry it. Grinpatch also appears to have a high tolerance for poison, able to suck up and eat some of Coco's highly lethal and corrosive poison without any ill effect. He seems to be very lazy as he does not fulfill his mission of retrieving the GT Robos because he does not feel like fighting the Gourmet Association's second and third. Another example of his laziness is that he does not finish the full names of places and things, calling the Regal Plateau the \\"Regal-whatever\\" and the Devil's Athletics the \\"Athletics-looking place\\". He agrees with Starjun that it is hard to not test Toriko's strength. He is one of the few Bishoku-kai members that Alfaro says are capable of entering the Gourmet World. * Breath: Grinpatch's lung capacity is inhuman, as shown during his brief fight with Toriko, as he can use his breath like a gun or bazooka when combined with his straw. After their brief battle, Toriko realizes that he was just playing around the entire time. * Devil Mosquito Straw: A straw made from the mouth of a \\"Devil Mosquito\\"; it is very resistant that Toriko could not cut it with his normal Knife. Grinpatch uses it mainly for sucking food. With his lung capacity, he also uses it to fire air bullets that could easily damage Toriko. :* Breath Gun: A technique combining Grinpatch's impressive Breath with the use of his Straw, he shoots fast bullets of air that are strong enough to tear through Toriko's flesh. It is considered his low-power attack. :* Breath Bazooka: A technique combining Grinpatch's impressive Breath with the use of his Straw, he shoots a massive cyclone of air that can tear through rock. This technique, although much stronger than the Breath Gun, takes time for Grinpatch to take prepare and his vision is obscured while using it. It is considered his high-power attack. ; * (TV series) : Sous Chef of the Bishoku-kai, Tommy has a bug-like appearance complete with wings. Tommy raises \\"parasite bugs\\" inside his body and can spew them out at will. His lack of emotion allows him to fight at complete efficiency, focusing solely on the goal at hand. It is also revealed that his armbands allow him to limit his strength. He is the first Bishoku-kai to seriously fight Toriko head-to-head (without using a GT Robo) with the intent to kill him. Since fighting Toriko, he has increased his Gourmet Cells, and is now more muscular, with a new arm that is darker that the rest of his body and four dark scars across his chest. He is one of the few Bishoku-kai members that can live in the Gourmet World. In the attack on Cooking Fest, Tommyrod was killed by Sunny's \\"Satan Hair\\". * Intimidation: Like Toriko and Mansam, except Tommyrod's is a projection of a demonic octopus-like being with a vein- filled, pulsing head. * Insect Production: Tommy's main ability is to produce a number of parasitic bugs from his body. He has approximately 10,000 parasitic eggs in his body, though it requires him to expend 1,500 kilo calories to hatch one egg in his esophagus before sending them out, because of this he cannot produce more than 1,000 insects per sitting. The bugs' capture levels range from very weak to some in the 40s, with 44 being the highest seen, aside from the Parasite Emperor. :* Exploding Insects [Insect beast] Capture Level 10 and Detonator Insect Capture Level 25: Tommy produces several small cylinder-shaped insects to latch onto an opponent, then he produces a much larger insect which, when killed, will detonate all the smaller insects in a very large explosion. :* Jongal Stag Beetle [Insect beast] Capture Level 38: Stag beetles with the size of a human hand. They are strife and their jaws can easily bite through human bones and flesh. A large gathering gave Toriko‚Äôs group a lot of trouble with none of them managing to harm the insects due to their fast reactions and their tough shells. :* Parasite Emperor: A \\"devil that will eat anything without discrimination,\\" the Parasite Emperor is a hybrid insect beast with a capture level of 81; it is created through cross- breeding numerous ferocious insect species. To be born it requires in essence all of Tommyrod's bodily energy, a testament to its power. Tommyrod also comments that he uses most of his energy to restrain this creature from being born. The beast's breath is below freezing; it can also release high temperature gas for flame-based attacks as well as excrete scorpion poisons and a spider web. * Fangs: Tommyrod can grow fangs which are very sharp; normally he keeps them retracted to allow his insects to be born out of his mouth. * Super Heated Breath: It is revealed that Tommy can heat his breath to very high temperatures and fire them off like bullets which explode when they hit the enemy though he normally uses this power to cause the eggs in his throat to hatch. :*Bomb Egg Storm: Using shivering and his super heated breath, Tommy can heat up and fire numerous eggs out of his body. The heat causes the acids and other chemicals inside the eggs to boil, turning them into miniature bombs with considerable power. * Full Power Form: When removing the set of rings he keeps around his arms and waist Tommy's muscles and body grow to nearly double his own size. * Wings: Tommyrod's insect wings are capable of flight and are extremely durable. :*Wing Shield: Since leveling up his Gourmet Cells, Tommy can now harden and manipulate his wings to act as shields. ; : The First Branch Chief, Elg is also known as \\"Ageless Elg\\" and possess an immortal body. Ordinarily, Elg's torso, arms, and face are covered in bandages, showing only his short, black hair and the lower half of his body. This lower half is actually the legs of the Heraku horse, a type of mythical Gourmet World beast. The Heraku has regenerative properties, and by combining with it, Elg's cells are able to regenerate, making him immortal. Not only can Elg regenerate, but if his body is broken apart, he can regenerate into entirely new bodies, even if it is just the cells of his bodies that are separated. Although immortal, Tengu Buranchi overwhelms Elg's cells' ability to rejuvenate during the attack on Cooking Fest and kills Elg. *Heraku Kick: Using his horse legs, Elg kicks the opponent. In the real world, most horse kicks are typically near-fatal, and Elg's legs contain considerably more power. ; * (TV series) : The Second Branch Chief, he has the same kind of eyes as Kuromado, dresses in renaissance-like clothes, and is somewhat of a blond pretty boy. He appears to be the politest of the Chefs. He is the only member of the Bishoku-kai to be able to pilot the \\"Micro-Model\\" GT Robo, for unknown reasons. With this GT Robo, he attacks and incapacitates Komatsu and is able to take the last bits of Century Soup that he collected away. Yuu is later seen in the Gourmet World, meaning he is capable of living there and thus has a great deal of power. *Stimulation Seasoning: Yuu produces a mist of seasoning that burns and dissolves opponents like acid. ; * (TV series) : The Third Branch Chef, Jerry Boy is a tan, blond-haired man who greatly resembles Toriko in appearance and clothes, save for his fanged teeth and his veins that show from his nose to his forehead as well as extended earlobes with multiple piercings. Jerryboy is later seen in the Gourmet World, meaning he is capable of living there and thus has a great deal of power. *Splinter Particle Whip: Jerryboy has a large spiked whip that he uses to fight with, which gives off enormous power and has a very long range. ; * (TV series) : The Fourth Branch Chef, a stocky, bearded man with protruding tusks. He wears very little clothing, even in frigid conditions, and displays incredible resilience to these temperatures. The Fourth Branch is the cookware supply team for the Bishoku-kai, which explains Barry's unique armor that was made from the shell of the Crush Turtle, a level 60 beast. This shell is several times superior to steel, and is also used by master craftsmen to manufacture the best pans and utensils in the Gourmet World. He also produces naturally occurring antifreeze, allowing him to survive arctic conditions and use the same slick to deflect gunfire. It is shown he also has very effective healing abilities thanks to the Gori Leeks implanted in his body, because after being cut several times by Match his organs are able to paste themselves back together until he is fully healed. ; * (TV series) : The Fifth Branch Chef, he wears a jogging suit, sport shades, and some kind of shell with a mask made from the body of an IGO agent that he used his ability on. He has approximately 4,000 bones and 4,600 joints, which he can easily detach and manipulate to allow him complete mobility and flexibility. He uses this quirk for his Lodge, a technique which allows him to inhabit another creature, assuming its form. Even if his bones are broken and removed, he can manipulate the rest of his unnatural capacity to compensate, barring the sacrum. However, even if the sacrum would happen to be removed or dislocated, his body will adjust in time and repair the nervous system, this process takes time but will be fully healed afterwards. ; * (TV series) : The Sixth Branch Chef, the operator of the GT Robo that Sani defeats. He uses the skulls of animals as shoulder pads and has a rather morbid interest with eyeballs since he wears a necklace of them, which he collects from the animals he kills and throws them away when they rot and stop moving. ; * (TV series) : An old man in a black robe who works for the Bishoku-kai and monitors the GT Robos for them. He also appears to be the one who made Grinpatch's Straw. His mouth is covered in metallic stitching but he can still talk and open his mouth freely. He has also defected to NEO, an organization that opposes both the IGO and the Bishokukai. ; Chiyo : The former head chef of Disappearance Cuisine, Chiyo is a small, elderly woman, with a very tight face and two large hair buns on both sides of her head. Known as \\"Delicate Cooking Chiyo,\\" she was a world-renowned chef, one of the few \\"Supercooks\\" who won Cooking Fest at, and was on the same level as Setsuno. After her son died, she became frustrated with the philosophy of Food Honor and went missing for years, but returned as a part of the Bishoku- kai. She joined the Bishoku-kai because they made the promise that they could acquire Acacia's Full Course's Hors d'oeuvre, \\"Center,\\" which is said to revive the dead. When Chiyo was younger, she was the assistant master of Shokurin Temple and was in a combo with the Shokurin Temple master, Chin Chinchin, whom she had her son with. Chiyo's skill with a knife is so delicate that she can remove a person's entire mid-section without them feeling it, and she is the only one with the skill to properly prepare Shokurin Temple's \\"Bubble Fruit,\\" which requires a delicate knife to peel the bubble's skin. * One-Stroke Thunder Cut: Using a small knife, Chiyo fires out a fast, swirling blade of air that cuts and twists what it hits. * Manaita Shield: Using her \\"manaita,\\" a type of Japanese cooking board, Chiyo defends herself against attacks. Her manaita is very durable, but was broken by Toriko's \\"Leg Knife\\". ; Ootake * (TV series) : The former 99th ranked chef and former head chef of the 7-Star restaurant \\"Fairytale Castle,\\" Ootake is a young chef with short, spiky hair, and since joining the Bishoku-kai, has his face covered in dark veins. He trained to be a chef with Komatsu, but upon becoming a highly ranked chef, he became more focused on money and fame than on the art of cooking and forgot about most of his time with Komatsu. To get his restaurant's and his own ranking higher, he paid journalists and food critics to give him good reviews. He was kidnapped by the Bishoku-kai to work as an enslaved chef, but at some point he became more accepting and has formed a combo with Staajyun. He has been trained in the Gourmet World and was injected with Gourmet Cells, so he is now much taller and more muscular, as well as more talented than he was before. * Revitalizing Kitchen Knife: Using a knife made from animals with high rejuvenative properties, one can cut between the cells of a living creature and have the area that is cut recover at great speed. This method is banned by the IGO because it could be used to create an endless supply of food by regenerating living creatures, and because the necessary technique is so difficult to use. ; Zaragira : The Bishoku-kai's \\"Food Management Office Chief,\\" Zaragira is a large, muscular monstrous man, with random tentacles coming out of his body, large dark claws, and no apparent genitals. Zaragira is part of the Bishoku-kai's team to kidnap chefs to work as slaves for the organization and is strong enough to defeat powerful chefs like Reishun. Despite his strength, Zaragira was killed in one attack by Zebra. ; Gur : A Bishoku-kai \\"Talent Scout,\\" Gur is a large, muscular, bird-looking monster with puffy black shorts, a cape, and a chef's hat. Gur is part of the Bishoku- kai's team to kidnap chefs to work as slaves for the organization and is strong enough to defeat powerful chefs like Rikiya, whom he takes out with a single punch. Despite his strength, Gur was killed in one attack by Zebra. ; * (TV series) : \\"Omnivorous Bei,\\" the man responsible for the GT Robo attacks on the coliseum and a member of the Bishoku-kai, Starjun claims he has bad taste. He looks like a sort of goblin, and is a major glutton. Since his attack on the coliseum, Bei appears to have been given physical treatment through Gourmet Cells and is now much larger and more muscular and is strong enough to fight on his own without using a GT Robo. ; Bile : A member of the Bishoku- kai, Bile appears to be a large gorilla-like creature with white fur. He calls himself the \\"appetizer\\" of the Bishoku-kai, if Midora is the \\"main course\\". He is capable of living in the Gourmet World. = NEO = The \\"New Food Utopia,\\" NEO is a massive organization separate from both the IGO and the Bishoku-kai. The membership of NEO includes many of the major CEOs and other wealthy, powerful individuals. In addition, NEO members are also hidden in the IGO and the Bishoku-kai. The goal of NEO appears to be to control the food resources of the world, similar to what the Bishoku-kai wants, except NEO seems to only see the world's food in terms of money. However, NEO also has more information and resources than all other organizations, and with that information, can find rare ingredients that the Bishoku-kai cannot. Following the Cooking Fest, NEO has usurped Bishoku-kai as the primary antagonists of the series. ; Joa : The personal chef to the king of the Jidar Kingdom, and the leader of NEO, Joa wears a formal Jidar outfit with a jester's hat and a cloth over his face most of the time. Without this disguise, Joa has the appearance the \\"Chef God\\" Frohze, but with many scale-like line across his face. It is eventually revealed that Joa is actually an unknown spirit inhabiting Frohze's body, having entered it after Frohze refused to come back to life even after being fed Center to revive her (as her and Acacia's plan required that she be in the afterlife). His eyes are big and orange like a cat or serpent's eyes and he has short black hair with multi-colored balls tied to the end in clumps, these balls are later revealed to be Life, a dish that allows its possessor to survive fatal wounds by dying in their stead. His skill as a chef is incredible; in addition to being the only chef able to totally remove the neo- solanine poison from the \\"Poison Potato,\\" Joa was the original champion of the first \\"Cooking Fest,\\" but was expelled and Setsuno was named winner instead. Joa is also very strong physically, having enough power to defeat Teppei and is willingly coming to Cooking Fest, even when the IGO and the Bishoku-kai are battling there. Joa has been seen using the legendary kitchen knife \\"Cinderella,\\" which has a white, rocky handle and a long, elegant blade. This knife originally belonged to the real \\"Chef God,\\" Frohze, the chef partner in the legendary bishoku-ya Acacia's combo. Joa also has the ability to completely activate his \\"Gourmet Cells,\\" which turns his skin red and scaly, turns his teeth to fangs, and turns his hair bright white. Setsuno and Jirou attribute this ability to Joa eating all of Acacia's \\"Full Course Menu.\\" He is finally killed when Midora kills all of his Life balls and drains him of his Food Luck. He is then mercy killed by Acacia as his body calcifies. *Tasting Scope: Joa can change his vision to a radar-like viewing that show individuals and their relative power levels, or as Joa interprets it, their \\"flavors.\\" *Taste Change: Using the legendary kitchen knife \\"Cinderella,\\" Joa makes a cut on a target that leaves a scar on their body. Somehow, this brainwashes the target into siding with Joa and following her orders. * 10 Million Slice Fillet: With a swing of her kitchen knife, Joa sends out millions of powerful slices in one burst. Collectively, this attack can have the power to burst through the enormous walls of the Cooking Fest arena, all the way into the ocean, where even the sea is cut and separated. * God Cooking - Sky Cut: Joa makes one, huge horizontal cut that can dissipate tsunamis . * Satan Mince: Using his knife, Joa blocks and dismantles attacks against his, especially projectile attacks. This requires many quick and successive movements and creates a huge burst of energy as the attacks are destroyed. * Freshness UP Revitalizing Cut: A \\"dark technique\\" that only talented chefs can use with specialty knives cutting between the cells to stimulate regrowth. Joa's version can affect target without even cutting them directly and can revive them instantly, and on top of that, those he revives in this way come back many times stronger than before. ; Colonel Mokkoi : The president of the company Gouradake, a company with a 20 trillion yen annual profit, Mokkoi is one of the most visible members of NEO. He has a curiosity and hunger for rare ingredients, financing the trip to Ice Hell to retrieve the original Century Soup. He is a short, elderly man, with balding, white hair, a gnarled nose, and he is always seen with a big pipe. Mokkoi relies on a GT Robo that looks exactly like him to do business, especially if it seems risky. ; Mahmai Moi : The president of the company \\"Gourmet Tourist,\\" the only travel company in the world with the ability to take customers to space. The company has a market value of 812 trillion yen, the 3rd highest in the world. Moi himself is an elderly man with dark skin, many freckles and liver spots, and short white hair, as well as a white mustache and beard. As a part of NEO, he seems to be focused on creating a \\"food utopia,\\" asking for talented chefs to be spared and instead brought with them. Moi employs Nakaume, the next in line to inherit the \\"Nakaume Cooking Academy\\" and a close friend of Komatsu, as his personal chef. ; Darnil Kahn : The king of the Jidar Kingdom, Kahn is a short, elderly dark skinned man with white hair and a beard covered by a turban, and elongated earlobes. He treats his servants poorly, spitting food into their faces if they do not prepare it correctly. A member of NEO, Kahn has access to vast amounts of wealth and information, with an even greater intelligence network than the IGO and Bishoku-kai combined. Kahn has some interest in an unknown location, and having found it, has left the Jidar Kingdom. There is also some evidence that Kahn was never actually in the Jidar Kingdom, but was instead operating remotely from a GT Robo. ; Mohyan Shaishai : One of the four Living Gourmet National Treasures, Mohyan Shaishai is the top Saiseiya in the world. It is said that only he can revive beasts that have been successfully sealed away and \\"Knocked\\" by the Knocking Master Jirou, like the Four Beast and the Hammertusk. Shaishai mentored a number of prominent Saiseiyas, like Yosaku and Kaitora, as well as a young Saiseiya named Pukin. Shaishai is an elderly man with a wrinkled, frog-like face and long, white hair, styled in spike-like shapes. According to Kaitora, he has joined NEO and revived the Four Beast for them. ; Kuribou ; Kousairou ; Zaus ; Appolo ; Kaitora ; Nomarch : One of the IGO's G7 Taste Masters. He is an old man with lots of liver spots on his head and is always seen carrying a gnarled wooden cane. ; Toppo : One of the IGO's G7 Taste Masters. He is a tall, old man with a flat face and beak-like nose, as well as slicked-back white hair and tiny glasses. ; Ahmon : One of the IGO's G7 Taste Masters. He is a short, middle aged man with shoulder-length messy black hair, saggy, wrinkled skin, and long, cat-like whiskers. = Saiseiya = The Saiseiya are a gourmet police, given the power of judgment to arrest anyone dealing with illegal gourmet products, in both procurement and black market trading. Their powers also extend to those who break the law by over-fishing and poaching certain species. ; Yosaku * (TV series) : An expert Saiseiya and Teppei's master. He is nicknamed \\"Blood- stained Yosaku\\" due to his seemingly brutal methods of healing. He wears a blood-soaked doctor's coat (befitting to his nickname), a black bandanna worn over his hair and is always seen smoking a cigar branch. Yosaku is also one of the staff members of the 0th Biotope, an IGO Garden in the Gourmet World. He hates following rules of any kind, be it simple rules such as to not smoke in a restaurant or go against rules of life itself. He has been described as a very strong person able to take down one of the Four Heavenly Kings, with Teppei's assistance (though Teppei notes that Yosaku had fully restrained him), a testament to his power. Despite his rough appearance he is a master in healing, proven when he completely heals three of Match's subordinates (all of whom were in critical conditions) in a matter of minutes, he also has in his possession medicine that can cure any disease in the Human World. He has also stated that he could completely heal Toriko's missing arm, though the process would take twenty years to complete. His job as a member of the 0th Biotope is to revive Acacia's dessert course, \\"EARTH,\\" which is also the dessert course selected by Sani. He appears to be fighting and training Sani to see if he has the level of power needed to enter the Gourmet World. *Wood Punch: A basic, frontal punch. *Kidzuke Shock: Yosaku brutally presses at all the body's pressure points, waking the target. This can wake people from comatose states in an instant. *Paste Spittle: Yosaku's saliva works as a strong bonding agent and he uses it to seal wounds. He uses this on a Gourmet Yakuza whose arm is nearly ripped off and states that it will heal within ten minutes. ; * (TV series) : A top level Saiseiya, Teppei is a considered an expert Knocker, able to deal with numerous hybrid insects birthed by Tommyrod as well as the Bishoku-kai Vice Chef himself. Teppei has been under the tutelage of the \\"Knocking Master\\" Jir≈ç (his relative), the fruits of which are shown through his adept Knocking ability as well as his pompadour. Teppei also carries with him supplies such as Forest Seeds and liquids capable of instantly growing these sturdy plants. Teppei has control over his Gourmet Cells, shown by his lack of \\"white breath\\" in Ice Hell, and he has been able to match Zebra blow- for-blow in a fight. While Teppei is more than capable as a Knocking master, his primary way of fighting appears to be using the many different seeds and plants he carries with him and growing them quickly with special liquid he carries in his earrings. Since being attacked by Joa, Teppei appears to have been brainwashed by the dark chef and is currently working with him. * Impact Knocking: Teppei is able to perform very precise Knocking using his bare hands. His mastery of Knocking allows him to paralyze even rare insects. His Knocking as a form of combat appears to have various levels of intensity. In his fight against Tommyrod, he uses \\"Medium\\" Knocking, and as a finishing move, \\"Well Done\\" Knocking. The levels of Knocking appear to be named after ways of cooking meat. *Nail Injection: Dripping some of the herbs he carries with him, Teppei can grow one of his fingernails into an elongated hypodermic needle to inject medicine. One of Teppei's fingernails is also a short but incredibly sharp knife. *Protection Tree: One of Teppei's plants that he carries with him, he plants a fast-growing seed that wraps around a target with very sturdy, vine-like trunks, protecting it from harm or holding it together. *Binding Tree: One of Teppei's plants, he grows a series of roots at his hands that he can manipulate. The tree can then grow up through the ground somewhere else and bind an opponent. This tree is strong enough to even subdue powerful people like Zebra and Setsuno. *Umbrella Tree: One of Teppei's plants, this one grows high then flat, creating a guard from airborne attacks or intolerable substances from the sky. *Sound Insulation Tree: One of Teppei's plants, this tree grows at an ordinary height but its branches are flat and oddly textured. But, they can easily absorb sound and sound-based attacks, like Zebra's. *Earthquake Resistant Root: One of Teppei's plants, this one combines with the other plants Teppei uses in battle to support them against powerful attacks. =Shokurin Temple= Shokurin Temple is a world- famous temple where strict \\"Food Etiquette\\" or \\"Food Honor\\" is taught. Shokurin Temple has many smaller, pilot schools around the world, but the main temple is located in the Lost Forest, a mysterious forest the size of Africa. Some prisoners from Honey Prison are taken to Shokurin Temple to learn \\"Food Honor,\\" in the hopes that they will be rehabilitated. Because of the vastness of the Lost Forest, very few people ever find Shokurin Temple, so it is also known as Disappearance Temple. Shokurin Temple is made out of special materials that will make the temple turn invisible and even attack guests who do not show any \\"Food Honor.\\" Near Shokurin Temple is the 10-star restaurant Disappearance Cuisine, which is made out of similar material to Shokurin Temple and will be invisible to those who do not have \\"Food Honor,\\" and one must bow before it in order to see the restaurant. At Shokurin Temple, one can find the \\"Bubble Fruit,\\" which is a very high-class ingredient made out of a bubble, but it cannot even be approached, let alone eaten, unless someone has mastered \\"Food Honor.\\" ; Chin Chinchin * (TV series) : The master of Shokurin Temple and one of the four Gourmet Living National Treasures, Chin Chinchin is a short old man with orange hair in a friar-like round haircut, a small mustache, freckles, and small glasses, although when he gets serious in battle, he becomes much larger with bulging muscles. He also wears a long Chinese-style robe with \\"Food Honor\\" written on the front in Japanese. When he was younger, his combo partner was the ex-head chef of Disappearance Cuisine, Chiyo, whom he also had a son with. He has a habit of getting people's names wrong, which goes with a seeming lack of interest in other people. Later, he explained that he only remembers the names of people who are truly talented in \\"Food Honor,\\" and the only people whose names he remembers are Toriko, Komatsu, and Chiyo. Chin Chinchin is a member of the IGO's \\"0th Biotope\\" in the Gourmet World, and as a favor to Ichiryuu, he has been monitoring Toriko's training as he's collected the ingredients on the President's list, and he was the one who sent Toriko and Sani the giant mountain fragment at Death Falls. Chin Chinchin has totally mastered \\"Food Honor,\\" and can eat the difficult-to- eat food at Disappearance Cuisine with great ease and speed. * Spoon: Chin Chinchin cups his hand to create a \\"Spoon,\\" like how Toriko uses his \\"Knife\\" and \\"Fork.\\" He can use this to scoop out an entire mountain, or can throw it to shoot a burst of air, which can propel him through the air or scoop up intangible things, such as fire. :*Spoon Dome: Using both hands, Chin Chinchin uses both hands to create a sphere made from the air from his \\"Spoon\\" to act as both a shield and a prison for those inside it. When \\"locked,\\" only Chin Chinchin can open it. * Food Immersion: The secret technique of Shokurin Temple, Chin Chinchin can store several months worth of food within his organs and use the energy from it to stay replenished for a long period of time. This also causes him to be much heavier, at point having a body weight of one ton. This technique is passed onto those who complete the training of \\"Bubble Road,\\" which is also the training to obtain the temple's treasure, the \\"Bubble Fruit\\". ; Shuu : An assistant master of Shokurin Temple, Shuu is a slender young man with a long braided ponytail that starts black and turns blond. He wears a Chinese-style robe with \\"Food Honor\\" written on it like Chin Chinchin. Shuu trains Toriko and Komatsu in \\"Food Honor\\" so they can make their techniques more efficient, and he says that his training is much more reasonable and safe than Chin Chinchin's. * Petty Knife: Shuu uses his hand as a knife, like how Toriko uses his \\"Knife.\\" But, Shuu's \\"Petty Knife\\" has much less power, and can only cut clothing and hair, but it is incredibly fine and delicate, and can cut off the sleeves of clothes without touching a person's skin and shave off a person's faintest amounts of facial hair in the middle of a fight. * Shokugi - Instant Blood Removal: Using a small knife instead of his \\"Petty Knife,\\" Shuu makes a small but incredibly precise cut on an opponent's arteries to try to make them lose a lot of blood at once. ; Koppwo : An assistant master of Shokurin Temple, Koppwo is an elderly man with large glasses, a large beard, and braided hair. He appears to be old enough to remember when Chiyo was at Shokurin Temple. * Shokugi - Hundred Piece Filet: Using a small knife, Koppwo slices through the air very quickly, sending out a hundred flying air blades, much like Toriko's \\"Flying Knife\\" technique. ; Wagon : An assistant master of Shokurin Temple, Wagon is a large man with a square jaw and long, black hair. He fights using a large pair of nunchucks with knives on the ends called \\"Deba Nunchuck\\". While protecting Shokurin Temple, Wago was killed by former assistant master and former combo partner of Chin Chinchin, \\"Delicate Cooking\\" Chiyo. ; Chiru : The current head chef of Disappearance Cuisine, Chiru is ranked 15th among chefs world-wide. Chiru wears a ninja-like outfit that obscures her face, along with the Disappearance Cuisine logo on the forehead band. Without the mask, Chiru has short black hair and dark markings, possibly scars, across her nose and cheeks. As a child, Chiru trained at Shokurin Temple, so she has mastered \\"Food Honor\\" and is capable of cooking the ingredients at Disappearance Cuisine that demand high levels of \\"Food Honor\\" to prepare and eat. Like Komatsu, Chiru heard the \\"voice\\" of the ingredients from Ichiryuu's full course menu. *Revitalizing Kitchen Knife: Using a knife made from animals with high rejuvenative properties, one can cut between the cells of a living creature and have the area that is cut recover at great speed. This method is banned by the IGO because it could be used to create an endless supply of food by regenerating living creatures, and because the necessary technique is so difficult to use. *Raging Waves Cut: Chiru uses her speed and delicacy to avoid attacks while slashing quickly at opponents. ; Chirin : An employee at Disappearance Cuisine, Chirin is a short, chubby man with a ninja-like outfit, but his face is not covered. He is very rude and does not appear to be as well trained in \\"Food Honor.\\" = Gourmet Yakuza = An organization much hated by the constitutional countries, seemingly made up completely of orphans and slum dogs from the crime slum Nerg, a non-IGO affiliated city. 10% of the prisoners in Gourmet Prison come from this city, giving it the nickname \\"Criminal- Producing Factory.\\" The Yakuza, seemingly altruistic, are told by the Boss upon joining to repay their debt not to him, but to the \\"hungry children of the slums.\\" Since defeating the Underground Cooking World, Match has taken control of the Gourmet Yakuza and they are running the Jidar Kingdom together with the Underground Cooking World. ; Ryuu : The former boss of the Gourmet Yakuza, Ryuu is an old man with skin covered in bullet scars, as well as long, wild hair and mustache. By the request of the Saiseya Yosaku, Ryuu has recently become a member of the IGO's \\"0th Biotope\\" and has left with executive members of the Gourmet Yakuza for the Gourmet World, leaving Match as the new boss. ; * (TV series) : Former Vice Boss and current Boss of the Gourmet Yakuza, he is completely covered in scars received at the hands of Zebra of the Four Heavenly Kings. He wields a single sword and is adept in the art of Iai, unsheathing, striking and sheathing the sword in a single movement. His ability allows his strength to be proportionate to his exhaustion, so the more tired he is, the more powerful he becomes. The sword he uses is made from a fang of the king of aquatic dragons, the Leodragon. This beast hunts and is capable of crushing the shell of a Crush Turtle with its jaws. Match takes advantage of this fact to cut through Barry Gamon's armor made of the same shell. *Iai: Sanmai Oroshi: Match uses his quick Iai style to cut an opponent into three parts, separating the spine from the other two halves of an opponent's body. *Iai: Hirabiraki: In one quick slash, Match makes a fatal cut across an opponent's gut. *Meuchi Ichirinzashi: Match stabs an opponent quickly, which puts him into a position to slice his target in half as he withdraws his blade. *Kaiten Kabutowari: After stabbing an opponent with \\"Meuchi Ichirinzashi,\\" Match turns his katana back in a circular motion, which cleanly and quickly cuts the opponent in half. *Ittou Ryoudan Kaburigiri: With one quick slash, Match slices an opponent's in two. :*Iai: Ryuuou Ittou Ryoudan: Described by Match as the way to \\"fully utilize\\" his katana, Ryuuou, Match gathers his rage quietly for three minutes and then releases it all in one powerful iai. This creates a quick-draw that is more powerful than his other techniques. = Gourmet Knights = The Gourmet Knights follow \\"Gourmet Doctrine\\": to entrust one's life completely to nature. This means shunning man-made medicines, putting Takimaru at odds despite his affiliation. Other tenets of the \\"Gourmet Doctrine\\" include a month of fasting, as well as avoiding extravagant food. All of the Gourmet Knights shown so far ride horses and wear a plain jumpsuit, with different straight- line tattoos around the eyes. The Gourmet Knights are based from \\"Simple Diet Hill,\\" a small, hilled area free from human development, which is near the village \\"Eco Land,\\" where the citizens use only all-natural supplies. Members of the Gourmet Knights are broken up into different \\"groups,\\" with four groups being shown so far: The Four Seasons group, the Blue Sky group, the Hidden Leaf group, and the Milky Way group. Whether this is the extent of the Gourmet Knight \\"groups\\" or what the functions of the different groups are is unknown at this time. ; * (TV series) : Leader of the Gourmet Knights, he is capable of eating bacteria and viruses, which enables him to devour diseases. This allowed Aimaru to \\"eat\\" most of Takimaru's \\"Gourmet World\\" disease, which almost killed Aimaru as well. He is one of Toriko's old friends and they have a friendly rivalry to see who can obtain GOD first. Aimaru has also completed training at Shokurin Temple and has learned the temple's secret technique, \\"Food Immersion.\\" Aimaru's full fighting potential has not yet been observed, but he has the ability to turn bacteria in one's body into a virus and can even transform all of the trillions of bacteria that exist in the body simultaneously. *Preshot Routine - Senya no Oshie: Aimaru uses a visualization technique to prepare himself to attack with his preferred weapon, a longbow. *Supreme Routine: While Aimaru and the other Gourmet Knights use visualization to increase the accuracy and power of their attacks, Aimaru has gone further and created a method to focus and bring out more precision and power through imagination and self-confidence. This routine simply involves Aimaru believing that something will happen, allowing it to become reality. For example, if he believes his attack will be successful, his body will respond in kind, and if he believes that he will heal from an injury, he will recover faster. This is essentially an expanded placebo effect to all of Aimaru's actions and bodily functions. Aimaru passed this ability onto Toriko to prepare him for future fights. ; * (TV series) : A new member highly skilled in martial arts, he joins Toriko's party as they enter the Ice Hell in search of Century Soup, as he needs money to buy medicine for Aimaru. He faces off against Bogey Woods and manages to discover his weakness about his sacrum, proving his intelligence, as well as momentarily defeating him albeit becoming gravely injured. He once suffers a disease from the Gourmet World, which are referred to as curses because known science has no cure for them. Aimaru consumes the disease and leaves only one of his eyes infected, at great personal expense. He is later rescued by Teppei and healed completely by Yosaku. He also receives the medicine which can cure any disease in the human world from Yosaku. Techniques: *Pre-Shot Routines: His attacks are all based around a type of martial arts involving his Pre-Shot Routines, where he focuses his energy in a specific stance. This makes his attacks take longer to hit and leaves him vulnerable to attacks; however, once he completes the routine his attacks have perfect accuracy and high destructive power. *Sennuki Shot: An attack that requires intense concentration, hence the need for the Pre-Shot Routines, Takimaru grabs the opponent and twists deeply into their body to dislocate one of their bones, usually a spinal vertebrae, and usually causes paralysis or death. The attack means \\"Corkscrew Shot,\\" and because Takimaru twists his hands into his opponent and then \\"pops out\\" their vertebrae, it is similar to a corkscrew un-corking a bottle. :*Sennuki Shot: ≈ågi Cork Screw: A more intense version of the Sennuki Shot that requires Takimaru's best Pre- Shot Routine to prepare. This attack physically tears out the bone that Takimaru targets. \\"≈ågi\\" is Japanese for \\"Secret Technique.\\" *Sennuki Press: A move that does not require a Pre-Shot Routine, Takimaru raises and turns one of his legs sideways and then presses an opponent between his raised knee and his two elbows. ; Akimaru : A member of the Gourmet Knight's \\"Four Seasons group,\\" Akimaru is a young man with well-styled short black hair, with two line eye-tattoos above and below each eye.

Every four years, those 100 chefs compete in an international competition known as \\"Cooking Fest.\\" ; Zaus : The \\"King of Cooking\\", Zaus is the number one ranked chef in the world. Besides his impressive rank as a chef, Zaus has also won the international chef competition \\"Cooking Fest\\" 14 times, including the most recent \\"Cooking Fest.\\" However, Setsuno reminded him that the only Cooking Fests he has won are ones where Setsuno was not present to compete. Zaus wears a dark red jacket with a striped shirt, with a tall chef's hat of the same color. Zaus also has a long white beard with tightly braided hair wrapping over his shoulder, with scars on his right eye. Zaus has a serious, striking gaze. Melk the First said that the knife of Zaus is one of the few knives he got a shock from after seeing. Zaus is also secretly a member of NEO, an organization which opposes both the IGO and the Bishoku-kai, and his devotion to the organization is so great that he does not hesitate to suggest that his fellow members attack Setsuno, whom he appeared to be friends with. *One Blade Cycle of Reincarnation Grate: With his blade, Zaus makes one long, quick slash that cuts across the enemy. The cut is incredibly accurate and if someone is holding onto a target, he can cut it in half without cutting the hand at all. The cut engraves itself in the target's DNA, so the scars that it makes will exist in their family for generations. ; * (TV series) : A Gourmet Living National Treasure and #2 ranked chef in the world, Setsuno is Jir≈ç's long-time partner, and has the same Full-Course Meal as him. She has the skill and capability of easily doing the work of eight top-level chefs. Setsuno has the record for most victories in \\"Cooking Fest,\\" having won the competition 29 times in the past. Setsuno attempts to recreate the legendary Century Soup Jir≈ç gave to her at some point; however, it is incomplete and she requests Toriko and Komatsu to find the missing ingredient after being impressed by their relationship and strong knowledge and respect of the gourmet ingredients. Although an old woman, she still has incredible power, breaking all of Alfaro's Plate Shuriken from far away without seeming to move, and is one of the few people brave enough to call the Bishoku-kai boss an \\"idiot.\\" However, she has still lost some of her power since her early days, losing some of her ability to let her Gourmet Cells \\"adapt.\\" This is characterized by her having \\"White Breath\\" in Ice Hell, meaning her Cells did not adapt to the cold environment and warm her body accordingly. Melk the First said that the knife of Setsuno is one of the few knives he got a shock from after seeing. Setsuno has the ability to control the air pressure around her and can increase it to a high degree to crush the bodies of enemies. She seems to also be able to project this power to create a protective shield around her from attacks. Setsuno has one of the few knives that interests the world's greatest kitchen knife maker, Melk. It is a small, lightning-bolt shaped knife named Takitsuba, Japanese for waterfall saliva. She can also changed its form into a more traditional knife shape. *High Pressure Cooker: A widespread attack where Setsuno crushes all the enemies around her to death by constricting the air pressure. Setsuno can also create this attack as a \\"mental projection\\" to intimidate enemies and dissuade them from attacking her. *Wall of Pressure: Using her ability to manipulate air pressure, Setsuno creates a small shield of pressure that can even defend against Midora's \\"Meteor Spice.\\" * Secret Technique - Flavor Flow: Setsuno focuses on an incoming attack and is able to deflect most of it head-on, depending on the level of the attack, using her unique kitchen knife Takitsuba. * Cook Road: Using the \\"changed form\\" of Takitsuba, Setsuno creates a large, snaking cut that can pursue an enemy. ; Tengu Buranchi : The #3 ranked chef in the world and chef at the restaurant \\"Tengu Castle,\\" \\"Bizarre Cooking\\" Tengu Buranchi is a genius chef who is considered the \\"delinquent equivalent\\" to Zebra in the chef world. Matching his \\"Tengu\\" name, Buranchi has dark-red skin and a long, tengu-like nose. He also has slicked back blond hair, multiple piercings, including one in the center of his forehead, and sharp, jagged teeth. This, combined with the school-uniform type clothing Buranchi wears, gives him the appearance of a stereotypical Japanese high school delinquent, his tengu-like appearance aside. Buranchi has only ever appeared in one Cooking Fest, which he also handily won. The reason for his non-appearance in other fests seems to be due to his bad attitude. Buranchi possesses incredible speed and strength, as well as a delicacy and respect for food that even makes him like Komatsu, despite his haughty and violent attitude. Buranchi is incredibly strong and fast, winning the \\"Cooking Fest's\\" Triathlon, beating Setsuno, Zaus, and Yuda, despite starting far later than all other competitors. A greater testament to his power is that Buranchi is from the \\"Bewitching Food World\\" inside the \\"Gourmet World\\" and is even in close communication with the Dharma hermits. Buranchi's body contains electricity-producing organs like an electric eel, but each of his cells also act as amplifiers. With this, Buranchi can produce over 100,000 amperes of electricity. While Buranchi can amplify electricity naturally, he still needs it to be produced by an outside force. He usually uses batteries that he inserts into his neck for this electricity, but he can also use other forms of electricity, such as wind, solar, and even kinetic energy he builds up by being attacked. Buranchi's electric attacks work by producing a conductive path, then filling that path with his electricity for the attack. The second step produces an electrical attack at a speed of 10,000 kilometers per second. Buranchi can also reach this speed physically, but only for a very short period of time. *Parallel Electric Punch: Buranchi fires a large bolt of electricity from his fist that travels from target to target, incinerating the enemy at the cellular level. *Parallel Electric Chop: Buranchi sends one huge bolt of electricity down onto his opponent. This discharge is equivalent to that of a natural lightning strike. *Parallel Electric Cutter: Buranchi fires a series of lightning bolts down onto his opponent and modifies them to slice at the opponent's body rather than just shock them. *Fuurai Katamitachi: A much larger, faster version of the Parallel Electric Cutter, Buranchi blows past his opponents and tears them up with his speed and electric blades. *Electric Knife: A direct attack, Buranchi surrounds his hand with electricity and slices at the opponent directly. *Lightning Kitchen Knife: By producing a large, concentrated burst of electricity, Buranchi and create and hold a large blade made out of electricity. Creating this weapon takes a large amount of Buranchi's power and is enough to wipe out his batteries. :*Spiral Lightning Fine Cut: Using his Lightning Knife, Buranchi makes one large, spinning cut that fries and tears apart an opponent at the cellular level. :Series Great Electrification Attack: One of Buranchi's \\"secret techniques,\\" this is an enormous wave of electricity that can obliterate a large number of opponents. It also electrifies their cells, so the electric current persists in their body and does not go away after the attack has hit. ; Damala Sky the 13th : The current owner of \\"Damala's Curry,\\" and the #4 ranked chef in the world, Damala Sky is a tall, stern man with long black hair, a mustache, and a dark 5 'o' clock shadow.

Among his medical skills are preparing food that optimize \\"Food Immersion\\" and being the only chef who knows the recipe for mochi to cure the diseased \\"Green Rain\\" from the Gourmet World. Yuda himself is a very tall, slim man with a gaunt face and long, red-brown hair and mustache that hang down to his waist. His mustache is parted to hang over his shoulders. His clothes resemble dark green track clothes, with Japanese characters on the front. The cooking at \\"Tray King\\" resembles Chinese and Japanese cuisine, with a large number of traditional dishes such as dumplings and yakisoba, as well as large, round Chinese-style dinner tables for customers. According to Toriko, Yuda has enough physical power to fight off beasts with capture levels around 100. Yuda has also won the international chef competition \\"Cooking Fest\\" 2 times and carries around a long, ornate Western-style sword dubbed the \\"All-Purpose Medicine Blade.\\" *1 Millimeter Thousand Cuts: Using the \\"All-Purpose Medicine Blade,\\" Yuda makes one quick slash that dices enemies into incredibly small pieces. *Resurrection Cut: Using his Medicine Blade, Yuda cuts his body and revives himself.

The Bishoku-kai appears to have tamed a number of feral Nitro and have used them to fight and capture powerful World Ranking chefs. They were originally a powerful civilization that spanned all over the Gourmet World, but mysteriously vanished. It is also revealed that most sentient species in the Gourmet World lived as slaves to the Nitro, and that a class system existed where Blue Nitro ruled over Red Nitro and all other species by mutilating the slave races' bodies to ensure subservience. Following the collapse of their civilization, it seems Red Nitro, deprived of their vocal chords, regressed to feral, solitary hunter- gatherers. The remaining civilized Blue Nitro, the Gourmet Nobles, now serve the Demon King Neo and assist him in his plans to cook the Earth until they can seal him away. This plan ultimately fails and all but the Nitro named PAIR are killed and/or eaten.

Dictionary of National Biography. London: (Smith, Elder & Co. 1885‚Äì1900). Early life Ashurst belonged to the Lancashire family, the Ashhursts of Ashhurst or Ashurst. One of his ancestors was Henry Ashurst, the philanthropist, and another was lord mayor of London in 1693. Sir William Ashurst was born at Ashhurst, near Wigan, 26 January 1725, and was educated at Charterhouse. Career Ashurst was admitted of the Inner Temple on 19 Jan. 1750. He practised for some years as a special pleader; and Mr. Justice Buller was one of his pupils. He was called to the bar on 8 February 1754, and was made a serjeant in 1770. On 25 June of the same year, on the removal of Sir William Blackstone to the Common Pleas, he succeeded him as a judge of the King's Bench, in which court Lord Mansfield then held undisputed sway. Mr. Justice Ashurst's judgments, which are reported in Loffts and Douglas's 'Reports' and Chitty's 'Practice Cases,' are remarkable for their clearness and good sense. A contemporary writer thus describes his qualities as a judge: 'Sir William Ashurst is a man of liberal education and enlarged notions. His language has no peculiar neatness nor brilliancy, but it is perspicuous, pointed, and clear. He reasons logically, and knows well how to winnow the chaff and eloquence from argument and law.' Mr. Justice Ashurst is best remembered by his charge to the grand jury of Middlesex on 10 Nov. 1792. The charge was delivered shortly after the massacres of September in France, and at a time when the name of reform had become odious to a multitude of Englishmen. Mr. Justice Ashurst, giving expression to the fears of the hour respecting the French revolution, attacked as 'absurd, nonsensical, and pernicious' the doctrines of its English admirers. 'There is no nation in the world that can boast of a more perfect system of government than that under which we live. . . . I trust that your minds will be impressed with these ideas, and that you will be assiduous in supporting our present form of government.' This charge was printed by the Society for preserving Liberty and Property against Republicans and Levellers as an opportune warning to the nation. It called forth several replies, one of the best-known being a pamphlet 'Justice to a Judge.' It also elicited from Bentham one of his most incisive pamphlets, 'Truth versus Ashhurst,' which was written in 1792, but was not printed until August 1823. Bentham's strictures are somewhat too sweeping. Sir William Ashurst was an admirer of what Bentham terms in this pamphlet 'the rubbish' of the common law. But he co-operated in some degree with Mansfield in introducing a spirit of equity into its administration. His personal appearance is recorded in the lines attributed to Erskine ‚Äî :Judge Ashhurst with his lanthorn jaws :Throws light upon the English laws. Later life Being highly esteemed as a lawyer, Sir William Ashurst was twice one of the commissioners entrusted with the great seal, which he held from 9 April 1783 to 23 December of the same year and from 15 June 1792 to 28 Jan. 1793. In 1786, Ashurst sold his home at Mount Pleasant (later known as Belmont) to William Franks.Page, William. (Ed.) (1908) \\"Parishes: East Barnet\\" in A History of the County of Hertford: Volume 2. Originally published by Victoria County History, London. British History Online. Retrieved 12 January 2016.

However, during the Continuation War the Finns took 64,000 POWs, of whom almost 30 percent died. Winter War Finnish cavalrymen guarding two Red Army soldiers in Lementti in the Ladoga Karelia.

Major Martti Aho interrogates a camouflaged Soviet prisoner of war in the Pryazhinsky District. The number of Soviet prisoners of war during the Winter War (1939‚Äì1940) was 5,700, of whom 135 died.Westerlund (2008), p. 8 Most of them were captured in Finnish pockets (motti) north of Lake Ladoga.Juutilainen & Leskinen (ed.); Manninen, Ohto (1999), p. 812 The war lasted only 105 days and most of the deceased POWs were either seriously wounded or sick. Some of the POWs, at least 152 men, enlisted in the so-called Russian Liberation Army in Finland. They were not allowed to take part in combat. After the war, some members of the Liberation Army managed to escape to a third country.Juutilainen & Leskinen (ed.); Manninen, Ohto (1999), p. 814 Continuation War The number of Soviet prisoners of war during the Continuation War (1941‚Äì1944) was about 64,000. Most of them were captured in 1941 (56,000 persons).Juutilainen & Leskinen (ed.); Kujansuu, Juha (2005), p. 1036 The first Soviet POWs were taken in June 1941 and were transferred to reserve prisons in Karvia, K√∂yli√∂, Huittinen and Pelso (a village in modern- day municipality of Vaala). Soon Finnish administration realized that the number of POWs was much greater than initially estimated, and established 32 new prison camps in 1941‚Äì1944. However, all of them were not used at the same time as POWs were used as a labour force in different projects around the country.Juutilainen & Leskinen (ed.); Kujansuu, Juha (2005), p. 1033 The Finns did not pay much attention to the living conditions of the Soviet POWs at the beginning of the war, as the war was expected to be of short duration. The quantity and quality of camp personnel was very low, as the more qualified men were at the front. It was not until the middle of 1942 that the quantity and quality of camp personnel was improved.Juutilainen & Leskinen (ed.); Kujansuu, Juha (2005), p. 1037 There was a shortage of labour in Finland and authorities assigned POWs to forest and agricultural work, as well as the construction of fortification lines.Juutilainen & Leskinen (ed.); Kujansuu, Juha (2005), p. 1038 Some Soviet officers cooperated with the Finnish authorities and were released from prison by the end of the war. Finnic prisoners who were captured on the fronts or transferred by Germany were separated from other Soviet POWs. At the end of 1942 volunteers could join the Finnish battalion Heimopataljoona 3, which consisted of Baltic Finns such as Karelians, Ingrian Finns, Votes and Veps.Juutilainen & Leskinen (ed.); Kujansuu, Juha (2005), p. 1039 = Prisoner exchange with Germany = About 2,600‚Äì2,800 Soviet prisoners of war were handed over to the Germans in exchange for roughly 2,200 Finnic prisoners of war held by the Germans. In November 2003, the Simon Wiesenthal Center submitted an official request to Finnish President Tarja Halonen for a full- scale investigation by the Finnish authorities of the prisoner exchange.The Simon Wiesenthal Center, press information In the subsequent study by Professor Heikki Ylikangas it turned out that about 2,000 of the exchanged prisoners joined the Russian Liberation Army. The rest, mostly army and political officers, (among them a name-based estimate of 74 Jews), most likely perished in Nazi concentration camps.Ylikangas, Heikki, Heikki Ylikankaan selvitys Valtioneuvoston kanslialle , Government of Finland = Deaths = Most of the deaths among Soviet POWs, 16,136, occurred in the ten-month period from December 1941 to September 1942. Prisoners died due to bad camp conditions and the poor supply of food, shelter, clothing, and health care. About a thousand POWs, 5 percent of total fatalities, were shot, primarily in escape attempts.Westerlund (2008), p. 9 Food was especially scarce in 1942 in Finland due to a bad harvest. Punishment for escape attempts or serious violations of camp rules included solitary confinement and execution. Out of 64,188 Soviet POWs, from 18,318 to 19,085 died in Finnish prisoner of war camps. In 1942 the number of prisoner deaths had a negative effect on Finland's international reputation. The Finnish administration decided to improve living conditions and allowed prisoners to work outside their camps. Hostilities between Finland and the Soviet Union ceased in September 1944, and the first Soviet POWs were handed over to the Soviet Union on 15 October 1944. The transfer was complete by the next month.Juutilainen & Leskinen (ed.); Kujansuu, Juha (2005), p. 1040 Some of the POWs escaped during the transportation, and some of them were unwilling to return to the Soviet Union. Furthermore, Finland handed over 2,546 German POWs from the Lapland War to the Soviet Union.Juutilainen & Leskinen (ed.); Kujansuu, Juha (2005), p. 1041 = Trials in Finland = According to the Moscow Armistice, signed by Finland and the victorious Allies, mainly the Soviet Union, the Finns were to try those who were responsible for the war and those who had committed war crimes. The Soviet Union allowed Finland to try its own war criminals, unlike other losing countries of the Second World War. The Finnish parliament had to create ex post facto laws for the trials, though in the case of war crimes the country had already signed the Hague IV Convention.Kujala (2008), p. 24 In victorious Allied countries war-crime trials were exceptional, but Finland had to arrange full-scale investigations and trials, and report them for the Soviet Union.Kujala (2008), p. 11 Criminal charges were filed against 1,381 Finnish POW camp staff members, resulting in 723 convictions and 658 acquittals. They were accused of 42 murders and 342 other homicides. Nine persons were sentenced to life sentences, 17 to imprisonment for 10‚Äì15 years, 57 to imprisonment for five to ten years, and 447 to imprisonment varying from one month to five years. Fines or disciplinary corrections were levied out in 124 cases.Westerlund (2008), p. 16 Although the criminal charges were highly politicized, some war crime charges were filed already during the Continuation War. However, most of them were not processed during wartime.Kujala (2008), p. 25  Aftermath  = Winter War POWs Returned to the Soviet Union = After the Winter War, the Soviet POWs were returned to the USSR in accordance with the Moscow Peace Treaty. They were transported under heavy guard by the NKVD to special camps as suspected traitors. Prisoners were interrogated by 50 person research teams. After lengthy investigations 414 were found to be \\"active in traitorous activities while in captivity\\" out of which 334 criminal cases were transferred to Supreme Court of Soviet Union, which sentenced 232 people to death. 450 prisoners were released, but most of them, 4,354 men, were sentenced to three to ten years in labour camps (gulag). This would lead to the later death of some of the prisoners due to harsh camp conditions.Juutilainen & Leskinen (ed.); Manninen, Ohto (1999), p. 815 = Continuation War POWs Returned to the Soviet Union = After the Continuation War, Finland handed over all Soviet and German prisoners of war in accordance with the 10th article of the Moscow Armistice. Furthermore, the article also stipulated the return of all Soviet nationals who were deported to Finland during the Continuation War. This meant that Finland also had to hand over all those who moved to Finland voluntarily, as well as those who fought in the ranks of the Finnish army against the Soviet union, though some had Finnish citizenship. The return to the Soviet Union was in many cases fatal for these people, as some of them were executed as traitors at the Soviet train station at Vyborg and some died in harsh camp conditions in Siberia.Juutilainen & Leskinen (ed.); Kotro, Arto (2005), p. 314Juutilainen & Leskinen (ed.); Nevalainen, Pekka (2005), p. 117 After the collapse of the Soviet Union the survivors were allowed to return to Finland. Some of the Soviet prisoners of war co-operated with the Finns during the war. Before the end of the war all related Finnish archives, including interrogation documents relating to co- operating prisoners, were destroyed; and these POWs' destinations after the war are uncertain. Some of them were secretly transported by Finnish army personnel to Sweden and some continued on as far as the United States.Juutilainen & Leskinen (ed.); Kujansuu, Juha (2005), p. 1045 The highest ranking Soviet prisoner of war was Major General Vladimir Kirpichnikov, who returned to the Soviet Union. He was tried, convicted of high treason, and executed in 1950.Westerlund (2008), p. 555  Legal position of Soviet POWs  Finland had signed the 1907 Hague IV Convention in 1922 that covered the treatment of prisoners of war in detail. However, Finland announced that it could not completely obey the convention as the Soviet Union had not signed the same convention. The convention required ratification by both parties to the hostilities before going into effect.Kujala (2008), p. 151 Finland did not sign the updated 1929 Third Geneva Convention, because it conflicted with some clauses of Finnish criminal law. Although the Soviet Union had not signed the Hague IV Convention, the reality was unclear and ambiguous.Kujala (2008), p. 152 Soviet law specified that a Soviet soldier's surrender constituted treason which was punishable by death or imprisonment and seizure of the soldier's property.Kujala (2008), p. 154  See also  * Finnish prisoners of war in the Soviet Union * East Karelian concentration camps * War children ¬ß Soviet prisoners of war Notes References =Citations= =Bibliography=  Military history of the Soviet Union during World War II * Finland‚ÄìSoviet Union relations Winter War Continuation War ","title":"Soviet prisoners of war in Finland"},{"id":"30234240","text":"S√∏lyst may refer to: * S√∏lyst (Klampenborg), an estate north of Copenhagen, Denmark * S√∏lyst, Stavanger, an island in Stavanger, Norway ","title":"S√∏lyst"},{"id":"30234242","text":"Igor Luk≈°iƒç (born 3 December 1961) is a Slovenian political scientist, politician and was president of the Slovenian Social Democrats (June 2012‚ÄìMay 2014).

The film shows many details of daily life in a major early 20th century American city, including the transportation, fashions and architecture of the era. The film begins at 8th Street and continues eastward to the cable car turntable, at The Embarcadero, in front of the Ferry Building.A Trip Down Market Street Before the Fire (1906) imdb.com Last accessed December 29, 2010 Landmarks passed in the latter part of the first half include the Call Building (then San Francisco's tallest) and the Palace Hotel (both on the right; Lotta's Fountain is on the left between the two but is in the shade). The film was produced by the four Miles brothers: Harry, Herbert, Earle and Joe. It is notable for capturing San Francisco four days before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which started on the morning of Wednesday, April 18, 1906. The Miles brothers had been producing films in New York including films shot in San Francisco. In September 1905 they shot the fight between Oscar \\"Battling\\" Nelson and Jimmy Britt in Colma, California, just south of San Francisco city limits. The Miles brothers established a studio at 1139 Market Street in San Francisco in early 1906. They shot a railroad descent down Mount Tamalpais as well as the Market Street film. On April 17, Harry and Joe Miles boarded a train for New York, taking the two films with them, but they heard about the earthquake and sent the films to New York while they boarded another train headed back to San Francisco. The Turk Street house of Earle Miles survived the earthquake and subsequent catastrophic fire but the studio did not. The Miles brothers based their business out of Earle's home, and shot more film of post-earthquake scenes; some of this footage, including that of a second trip down a now devastated Market Street, reemerged in 2016. It is likely that the Market Street film survives today because it was sent away before the fire. Several 35mm prints exist with slight changes in footage. Copies are held at the Library of Congress and the Prelinger Archives. A digital version is viewable online at Internet Archive, YouTube and Wikimedia Commons. A Trip Down Market Street, Wikimedia Commons category In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.Fleming, Mike: National Film Registry's 25 Films For 2010 December 28, 2010. Last accessed December 29, 2010 Automobile traffic The film records a total of thirty cable cars, four horsecars, and four streetcars. At first there also appear to be many automobiles; however, a careful tracking shows that almost all of the autos circle the camera many times‚Äîone of them ten times. This traffic was apparently staged by the producer to give Market Street the appearance of a prosperous modern boulevard with many automobiles. In fact, in 1905 the automobile was still something of a novelty in San Francisco, with horse-drawn buggies, carts, vans, and wagons being the common private and business vehicles. The near total lack of traffic control along Market Street emphasizes the newness of the automobile.A trip down Market Street before the fire Library of Congress Dating the film Full film, 13 mins The film was originally thought to have been made in September or October 1905, based on the angles of shadows showing the sun's position. Film historian David Kiehn noticed that there were puddles of water seen in the street, and after he examined contemporary newspapers and weather reports, he realized that the early estimates were wrong: no rain had fallen in those months. Kiehn located the February 1906 registration record for a car license plate recorded in the film, and he found that the sun's angle would be the same in March as it had been in September. In 2009 Kiehn suggested that A Trip Down Market Street was filmed in late March or early April 1906, a period with many rainy days reported. He found an advertisement for the film published in the New York Clipper on April 28, 1906, which stated that the film had been shot \\"just one week before the complete destruction of every building shown in the picture,\\" though this was a somewhat hyperbolic claim given that a number of buildings seen in the film were heavily damaged and later repaired. If the \\"one week\\" statement was correct then the film would have been shot on April 11. Kiehn also found a San Francisco newspaper article published on March 29, 1906, describing the Miles Brothers' intent to film aboard a cable car. In October 2010, Kiehn was featured in a 60 Minutes segment discussing the historiography of the film, especially the problem of dating it. In 2011, Richard Greene, an engineer with Bio-Rad Laboratories, published research dating the film to March 24‚Äì30, 1906, based on the sun throwing well-defined shadows on the Ferry Building. Greene confirmed that the film was shot at about 3:17 in the afternoon, based on the Ferry Building clock. Greene notes that his calculated date range is consistent with Kiehn's findings, but not consistent with the date of April 14 which was published in 2011 by the Internet Movie Database without a supporting cite. He also notes that his date range is about three weeks prior to the earthquake, inconsistent with the \\"one week\\" claim in the New York Clipper advertisement.

Restoration The most complete and highest resolution version is a recent scan of 35mm film held by Prelinger Archives, San Francisco and thought to be an original 1906 print. It was scanned by Adrianne Finelli at Internet Archive on October 11, 2018 using IA's Lasergraphics ScanStation scanner set at 5120 x 3840 and scanned to 16fps. This full-width scan is 4096 x 3072 pixels wide and every second frame is doubled for a playback frame-rate of 24fps. Archives frequently make full-width scans to show information between the perforations that would normally be missing in a scan cropped to show only the picture area. Black printed-through perforations and other characteristics of the print may also be seen at certain points in the film. Additionally, this version has been upscaled and colorized by Youtube user Denis Shiryaev. This is the most complete version of the historic film, combining the best elements of prints from Prelinger Arichives and Library of Congress. This version of the film has been digitally stabilized to remove jitter. Post effects that have been applied: * FPS boosted to 60 frames per second (DAIN); * Image resolution boosted up to 4k (ESRGAN); * Improved video sharpness; * Noise removal; * Colorized Environment sounds in the video have been reconstructed. Automobile sounds are all either Stanley or White steamers, Ford Model T, or Model A, which came out later, but which have similarly designed engines, and sound quite close to the various cars shown in the film. Some of the automobiles are thought to be steamers, and are dubbed as such. The horns are slightly inaccurate as mostly bulb horns were used at the time, but were substituted by the far more recognizable electric \\"oogaa\\" horns, which came out a couple years later. The streetcar sounds are actual San Francisco streetcars. Doppler effect was used to align the sounds. In popular culture The video has been used in music videos by Quantic and Air (unofficial).

Deafened by scarlet fever at the age of eight, Veditz was one of the first to make motion-picture recordings of American Sign Language. Taking care to sign precisely and in large gestures for the cameras, Veditz chose fiery biblical passages to give his speech emotional impact. In some of his films, Veditz used finger spelling so his gestures could be translated directly into English in venues where interpreters were present. On behalf of the NAD, Veditz made this film specifically to record sign language for posterity at a time when oralists (those who promoted lip reading and speech in lieu of sign language) were gaining momentum in the education of the deaf. The film conveys one of the ways that deaf Americans debated the issues of their language and public understanding during the era of World War I.

History  The idea for a new church in the newly developed Quartiere della Vittoria (literally District of Victory, named for the victory in World War I) came from Ottavio Gasparri, member of the Sacred Heart of Jesus religious institute. At first the church was to be named Tempio della Pace, Roma - Guide Rosse d'Italia, Touring Editore, 1999, page 723 to remember and honour the fallen of World War I. Construction began in May 1920.1924, according to Roma - Guide Rosse d'Italia, Touring Editore, 1999, page 723 The original design proposed by Marcello Piacentini was inspired by the churches built in Rome in the 16th century. Construction halted with the death of Ottavio Gasparri, in 1929. In the next two years Piacentini changed radically the project, being inspired by the emerging Rationalist movement, and the Sacro Cuore di Ges√π marked the turning point of the sacred architecture in Rome. The construction started again in 1931 and the church was inaugurated in 1934. The church became a parish church under Pope Pius XI on 31 October 1926 with the apostolic constitution Regis pacifici. On 5 February 1965 was declared titular church by Pope Paul VI with the apostolic constitution Sacrum Cardinalium Collegium. Later that year, with the motu proprio Recentioris architecturae the church became a minor basilica.  Design  The church has a brick fa√ßade with alternate courses raised and recessed; the fa√ßade is capped with travertine and the doors and windows are framed with the same material. The floor plan, with a central nave of approximately 70 metres in length and flanked by two aisles, is a hybrid of a Latin cross and a Greek cross. The hemispherical dome is 36 metres high and 20 metres in diameter. Over the main portal there is a high relief by Arturo Martini depicting the sacred heart of Jesus. Around the interior are the Stations of the Cross in bronze by Alfredo Biagini.

Biography  Johann Heinrich Lienhard was born on 19 January 1822 in Switzerland at the hamlet Ussb√ºhl near Bilten, Canton Glarus. He spent his childhood and youth together with his three siblings on the farm of his parents. Knowing that several of his cousins had emigrated to America, his childhood dream of following their example came true when he left Switzerland in 1843 and traveled to New Switzerland, later Highland, in Illinois. He spent the next two and a half years mainly at that place, it being a time of adjusting to new conditions. At first Lienhard worked as a farm hand and later left the Swiss settlement on occasion to travel up the Mississippi, taking on several jobs along the way in the hope of finding better-paid work. In the spring of 1846, while working in a shop in St. Louis, he met some old friends from GalenaFor a short time Lienhard had worked in the lead mines of Galena, Illinois. with whom only a year before he had talked about emigrating to California. They were just then preparing for that venture, and little effort was needed on their part to persuade him to join them in their undertaking. The journey of the \\"Five German Boys,\\" as Heinrich Lienhard and his four companions were called by the other emigrants,Lienhard's companions were Heinrich Thomann and Jakob Rippstein from Switzerland, and the Germans Georg Zins and Valentin Diel. lasted six months and led them from Independence, Missouri, to New Helvetia, also called Sutter's Fort, in California. In 1846, there was no fully established trail yet to that Mexican domain for emigrants, let alone for their oxen-drawn wagons, so that especially the second half of the way required the utmost effort and skill of humans and animals alike. In his reminiscences Lienhard describes the exact route and various aspects of daily life on the trail such as the shifting relationships among the emigrants, the encounters with the Indians, the changing landscapes as well as the trials and dangers travelers faced on difficult passages such as the Great Salt Lake Desert and the Sierra Nevada. Even before arriving at Sutter's Fort, the emigrants were met by a recruiting agent of the United States Army. Urged on by a companion to whom he owed money, Lienhard too signed up for a three months' service in the American military then engaged in war against Mexico in order to annex all its claimed possessions north of the Rio Grande. On the trek to Monterey, however, Lienhard became severely ill and barely survived the ordeal. On his return from Monterey in February 1847, he entered the service of the Swiss John Augustus Sutter (1803‚Äì1880). For the next six months he tended Sutter's fruit and vegetable garden on the Yuba River, then served several months as his mayor-domo at the Fort, and briefly also as a supercargo on Sutter's wheat laden schooner traveling to San Francisco. In January 1848 gold was discovered at Coloma where Sutter's sawmill was being built. At that time Lienhard was planting and tending a new garden of fruit trees, vines, vegetables, and flowers near the Fort. He was to join the miners only in August and, like others, in partnership with Sutter. When Sutter's oldest son John Augustus Sutter, Jr. arrived from Switzerland in September, Sutter, Sr. asked Lienhard to lend him his half of the gold he had mined, so that Sutter could impress his son with a large amount of the precious metal. However, when Lienhard later went to the Fort, Sutter, Jr., having taken charge of his father's debt-ridden business, was unable to return his share of the gold to him. Lienhard finally accepted Sutter's flock of sheep instead and spent the following winter with Jacob D√ºrr, also a Swiss,He came from Pratteln, Canton Basel. at the sheep farm not far from the Fort. In April 1849 Lienhard and D√ºrr went as partners to the mines to trade the sheep. Several weeks later Lienhard sold out to D√ºrr and, back at the Fort, acquiesced in Sutter, Jr.'s request of going to Europe in order to bring the rest of his familyAnna Sutter-D√ºbeld and the children Anna Elise, Emil and Alphons. to California. Heinrich Lienhard left San Francisco in June 1849, traveling via the Isthmus of Panama to New York and from there via England and Germany to Switzerland. Taking the same route, he returned to San Francisco in January 1850. Only half a year later he decided to leave violence-ridden California for good. Although he loved its climate, prairies, valleys, and mountains, he could not tolerate the lawlessness as well as the exploitation and destruction of the indigenous peoples. On the last day of 1850 and after a journey of six months he was back at his parental home in Switzerland. In summer 1851 Heinrich Lienhard married Elsbeth Blumer of Bilten. They purchased a homestead in Kilchberg near Zurich, where in 1852 their first son Caspar Arnold and the following year John Henry were born. In September 1853, however, the Lienhards sold their farm and in April 1854 left Zurich, first settling for two years in Madison, Wisconsin, where in 1855 they had their third son, John Jacob. In 1856 they moved to Nauvoo, Illinois, on the Mississippi, where Heinrich Lienhard was to live for 47 years as a well-to-do farmer and respected citizen. In Nauvoo he and Elsbeth Lienhard had six more children, but they lost their oldest son in 1878 and their daughter Dora in 1884. In the same year Lienhard's wife died and in 1892 the youngest daughter Barbara Adela. Heinrich Lienhard died on 19 December 1903 after a brief illness and, like his wife and seven of their children, was buried in Nauvoo's Presbyterian cemetery.  Heinrich Lienhard's manuscript  In the mid-1870s Heinrich Lienhard began to chronicle the experiences of the first 29 years of his life from his childhood and youth in Switzerland up to his return home from California in 1850. In regular and fluent old German script he filled nearly one thousand pages, a task that was to engage him for several years, thus leaving behind a legacy of a very special kind. Wherever Lienhard happened to be during his years of traveling, his full attention was drawn to nature in all its variety, to landscapes, climatic conditions, soil quality, geological details, and plants and animals previously unknown to him, while many passages of his account deal with people, with lasting friendships as well as with brief, yet unforgettable encounters. With these portraits he created a monument to many of his friends and acquaintances who otherwise would long be forgotten, portraits, which always reflect his own personality, too. This shows itself impressively in his relationship with the founder of New Helvetia John A. Sutter, whom he got to know well. Lienhard's keen sense of observation was not limited to outward features, but involved his heart and mind as well. Although he respected the indigenous people from the start as the natives of the land, his early comments are not free from the typical ethnocentric views of the whites. Gradually his perspective changed, especially during his stay at Mimal on the Yuba River, where he lived for six months in isolation from white settlers and in close contact with the indigenous peoples of the surrounding villages. Some gathered regularly at his house, observed his activities with interest, traded, or occasionally helped with garden work. They taught him to become a first-rate archer, now and then took him along to their families, and nursed him back to health when he fell ill. Thus Lienhard began to observe their daily life and marveled at their skill in basketry, hunting and fishing. He often joined them in those pursuits and describes their methods of procuring and preparing food. His observations led him to understand that these people had organized their style of life in creative symbiosis with their surroundings, that their customs, though different, were ingenious, and that assessing them from a culturally biased vantage point did not do them justice. His growing understanding was extraordinary and increasingly run counter to the then dominant views. One night in the winter of 1848‚Äì49, he overheard his young Indian herdsmen talking of the times before the whites had invaded their valleys and of the ever worsening conditions. \\"The subdued talk of the Indians caused me to ponder,\\" he wrote. \\"In my thoughts I tried to put myself in the position of the Indians; and I wondered whether I would acquiesce if I were driven out of my and my ancestors' homeland as had been the fate of the poor Indians. I confess that I was overwhelmed by strong feelings of revenge, always coming to the conclusion that I would take revenge on the shameless, greedy invaders in every possible way.\\"Manuscript 146/4‚Äì147/1. He knew from first-hand experience, however, that cooperation, escape, or resistance could all mean death for indigenous people. Thus Lienhard's text may be read from various perspectives. It fascinates as a detailed and captivating account of landscapes, fauna, and flora as well as of peoples and events. Far more than a story of adventure, it is a complex report of a racial conquest. The white intruders' destruction of the environment, of animals, of indigenous peoples, and of their millennia-old communities as well as their infliction of forced servitude on the Indians, sexual exploitation of the indigenous women, of expulsion and death emerges with merciless clarity. Heinrich Lienhard's account is thus a factual part-description of the Anglo-American conquest of the northern Western Hemisphere with its Janus-face of environmental destruction, racial annihilation, and of a simultaneous build-up of a vibrant Anglo-American variation of Western culture.  Publications  In 1949, a granddaughter sold Heinrich Lienhard's manuscript to the Bancroft Library in Berkeley, California, where it is accessible in its original form as well as on microfilm. Yet it had already awakened the interest of people outside the family in Lienhard's own lifetime. The first to deal with the text was Kaspar Leemann, a friend from Lienhard's days in Kilchberg (1850‚Äì54), whose edition was published in 1898, a reprint in 1900.Joh. Kaspar Leemann, Californien unmittelbar vor und nach der Entdeckung des Goldes: Bilder aus dem Leben von Heinrich Lienhard von Bilten, Kanton Glarus, in Nauvoo, Nordamerika.

However, Leemann's version contains many errors of transcription, substantial omissions, changes and additions, so that the original is often barely recognizable. Lienhard, then approaching his eighties, was deeply disappointed as notes in the margins of his personal copy reveal. In the United States the first partial edition, prepared by Marguerite E. Wilbur, was published in 1941 as A Pioneer at Sutter's Fort, 1846‚Äì1850: The Adventures of Heinrich Lienhard.Marguerite E. Wilbur, ed. and transl. A Pioneer at Sutter's Fort, 1846‚Äì1850. The Adventures of Heinrich Lienhard, No. 3 of the Calaf√≠a Series. Los Angeles: The Calaf√≠a Society, 1941. Wilbur translated the sections relating to Lienhard's stay in California, excluding his trip to Switzerland in 1849. On the whole she follows the original, yet often omits episodes that, according to her judgment, \\"proved to be of slight historic value.\\"Wilbur, p. xv.

Apart from an accident when she fouled her anchor off Llandudno in July 1976 and consequently missed a sailing, Snaefell enjoyed an efficient and uneventful career. However, the predominance built up by the Steam Packet's car ferries in the 1970s, made it sensible to withdraw another traditionally designed ship.

The plastic deformation capacity of metallic materials, however, is limited to a certain extent, at which point, the material could experience tearing or fracture (breakage). Processes affected by the formability of a material include: rolling, extrusion, forging, rollforming, stamping, and hydroforming.  Fracture strain  A general parameter that indicates the formability and ductility of a material is the fracture strain which is determined by a uniaxial tensile test (see also fracture toughness). The strain identified by this test is defined by elongation with respect to a reference length. For example, a length of is used for the standardized uniaxial test of flat specimens, pursuant to EN 10002. It is important to note that deformation is homogeneous up to uniform elongation. Strain subsequently localizes until fracture occurs. Fracture strain is not an engineering strain since distribution of the deformation is inhomogeneous within the reference length. Fracture strain is nevertheless a rough indicator of the formability of a material. Typical values of the fracture strain are: 7% for ultra-high-strength material, and over 50% for mild-strength steel.  Forming limits for sheet forming  One main failure mode is caused by tearing of the material. This is typical for sheet-forming applications.Pearce, R.: ‚ÄúSheet Metal Forming‚Äù, Adam Hilger, 1991, .Koistinen, D. P.; Wang, N.-M. eds.: ‚ÄûMechanics of Sheet Metal Forming ‚Äì Material Behavior and Deformation analysis‚Äú, Plenum Press, 1978, .Marciniak, Z.; Duncan, J.: ‚ÄúThe Mechanics of Sheet Metal Forming‚Äù, Edward Arnold, 1992, . A neck may appear at a certain forming stage. This is an indication of localized plastic deformation. Whereas more or less homogeneous deformation takes place in and around the subsequent neck location in the early stable deformation stage, almost all deformation is concentrated in the neck zone during the quasi- stable and unstable deformation phase. This leads to material failure manifested by tearing. Forming-limit curves depict the extreme, but still possible, deformation which a sheet material may undergo during any stage of the stamping process. These limits depend on the deformation mode and the ratio of the surface strains. The major surface strain has a minimum value when plane strain deformation occurs, which means that the corresponding minor surface strain is zero. Forming limits are a specific material property. Typical plane strain values range from 10% for high-strength grades and 50% or above for mild-strength materials and those with very good formability. Forming limit diagrams are often used to graphically or mathematically represent formability. It is recognized by many authors that the nature of fracture and therefore the Forming limit diagrams are intrinsically non- deterministic since large variations might be observed even within a single experimental campaign.  Deep drawability  A classic form of sheetforming is deep drawing, which is done by drawing a sheet by means of a punch tool pressing on the inner region of the sheet, whereas the side material held by a blankholder can be drawn toward the center. It has been observed that materials with outstanding deep drawability behave anisotropically (see: anisotropy). Plastic deformation in the surface is much more pronounced than in the thickness. The lankford coefficient (r) is a specific material property indicating the ratio between width deformation and thickness deformation in the uniaxial tensile test. Materials with very good deep drawability have an r value of 2 or below. The positive aspect of formability with respect to the forming limit curve (forming limit diagram) is seen in the deformation paths of the material that are concentrated in the extreme left of the diagram, where the forming limits become very large.  Ductility  Another failure mode that may occur without any tearing is ductile fracture after plastic deformation (ductility). This may occur as a result of bending or shear deformation (inplane or through the thickness). The failure mechanism may be due to void nucleation and expansion on a microscopic level. Microcracks and subsequent macrocracks may appear when deformation of the material between the voids has exceeded the limit. Extensive research has focused in recent years on understanding and modeling ductile fracture. The approach has been to identify ductile forming limits using various small-scale tests that show different strain ratios or stress triaxialities.Hooputra, H.; Gese, H.; Dell, H.; Werner, H.: \\"A comprehensive failure model for crashworthiness simulation of aluminium extrusions\\", IJ Crash 2004 Vol 9, No. 5, pp. 449‚Äì463.Wierzbicki, T.; Bao, Y.; Lee, Y.-W.; Bai, Y.: ‚ÄúCalibration and Evaluation of Seven Fracture Models‚Äù, Int. J. Mech. Sci., Vol. 47, 719‚Äì743, 2005. An effective measure of this type of forming limit is the minimum radius in roll-forming applications (half the sheet thickness for materials with good and three times the sheet thickness for materials with low formability).  Use of formability parameters  Knowledge of the material formability is very important to the layout and design of any industrial forming process. Simulations using the finite-element method and use of formability criteria such as the forming limit curve (forming limit diagram) enhance and, in some cases, are indispensable to certain tool design processes (also see: Sheet metal forming simulation and Sheet metal forming analysis).  IDDRG  One major objective of the International Deep Drawing Research Group (IDDRG, from 1957) is the investigation, exchange and dissemination of knowledge and experience about the formability of sheet materials.

At the time the network's broadcast agreements with the United States Tennis Association (USTA) ended in 2014, CBS held the broadcast rights to the U.S. Open, the U.S. Open Series and the Sony Ericsson Open. From 1980 to 1982, CBS also televised the French Open (sandwiched in-between stints at NBC). CBS also during the 1970s and 1980s, broadcast the Grand Prix tennis circuit (including the Pepsi Grand Slam). CBS returned to show tennis coverage again after five years, with both World TeamTennis (2019‚Äìpresent) and USA matches at the Davis Cup (2020‚Äìpresent) U.S. Open coverage CBS Sports broadcast the first US Open Tennis Championships in 1968. Bud Collins called the action alongside Jack Kramer. James Wall (best known for playing Mr. Baxter on Captain Kangaroo) was also the stage manager for 41 consecutive years on the US Open Tennis Championships telecasts. On May 17, 2013, ESPN signed a contract (an 11-year deal at $770 million; about $250 million more than CBS was willing to pay) with the United States Tennis Association that would give it the rights to broadcast the U.S. Open starting in 2015, ending CBS's role in covering the tournament after 47 years. At the end of their 2014 coverage, CBS for their closing credits montage, highlighting the greatest moments during their 47-year run with the US Open, used Alicia Keys's \\"Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down\\". Without the US Open, CBS's SEC college football coverage was now allowed to start on Labor Day weekend and their National Football League coverage to have a doubleheader in Week 1 of regular season. =Scheduling anomalies= In 1982, CBS debuted \\"Super Saturday\\". The Men's Semifinals sandwiched the Women's Final, with the first semifinal match starting at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. For the past few decades, the National Football League had always let CBS be the \\"singleheader\\" network during the week it televised the Men's US Open Tennis final at 4:05 p.m. Eastern Time around the country (CBS has said that it could not justify putting the Men's US Open Final on Sunday night in terms of ratings; the women's final, broadcast on a Saturday night, often outrated the men's final by a considerable margin, except when at least one American plays in the men's final). All the courts used by the U.S. Open are lighted, meaning that television coverage of the tournament can extend into prime time to attract higher ratings. This has recently been used to the advantage of the USA Network cable channel and especially for CBS, which used its influence to move the women's singles final to Saturday night to draw higher viewership. Effects from the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon For several years, due to the overlapping scheduling of the U.S. Open and the Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon on Labor Day weekend, many CBS affiliates had to provide alternate scheduling to accommodate one of the events. This issue was resolved in 2011, when all CBS affiliates that had aired the MDA Telethon became able to air the U.S. Open on Labor Day, as the Muscular Dystrophy Association had decided to reduce the telethon (renamed that year as the MDA Show of Strength) was reduced from a 21¬Ω-hour broadcast (lasting from the Sunday night before the holiday to the late-afternoon of Labor Day itself) to a six-hour prime time broadcast (airing only on the night before the holiday). Some CBS stations arranged for co-owned/managed independent stations and affiliates of smaller networks (such as UPN/MyNetworkTV affiliate WHTV in Lansing, Michigan in lieu of WLNS-TV; Fox affiliate KASA-TV in Albuquerque, New Mexico in lieu of KRQE; and MyNetworkTV affiliate WNEM-DT2 in Flint, Michigan in lieu of its parent station's main channel) to carry the network's coverage of the U.S. Open on Labor Day in order to air the telethon. In other cases, the alternate U.S. Open broadcaster in a given market was unrelated to the local CBS station. In Albany, New York, WB affiliate WEWB-TV (now CW affiliate WCWN, then owned by Tribune Broadcasting) took on the responsibility of airing network coverage of the U.S. Open (as well as other local and network programming) in lieu of Schenectady-based WRGB (then owned by Freedom Communications; WCWN and WRGB are now jointly owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group) through 2004. Time Warner Cable's Capital District system (which carried it on channel 3) took over the local rights to the tournament in 2005, due to a crop of syndicated program premieres on Labor Day that prevented WCWN from airing the tournament. =Additional US Open coverage= Occasionally, The Late Late Show was split into 15- and 45-minute segments in order to allow CBS to air a daily late-night highlight show for the US Open tennis tournament (as well as the Masters and other PGA Tour events whose broadcast rights are held by CBS). The tournament highlights were broadcast in-between the monologue and the guest segments. However, in mid-2007, the highlights show began airing first, with the full hour of The Late Late Show airing on a delay. In August 2012, CBS Sports Network began to offer additional coverage of the US Open, including replays of classic matches, coverage of qualifying matches, a pre-match show, and coverage of third- and fourth-round matches not shown by CBS. Arthur Ashe Kids' Day Arthur Ashe Kids' Day is an annual children's event held by the United States Tennis Association that takes place the last Saturday in August at Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing Meadows, Queens, New York. The event, which features professional-amateur charity tennis competitions and features performances from popular music artists, was televised by CBS as a tape delayed broadcast the Sunday after the event; the rights to the Arthur Ashe Kids' Day event moved to ESPN as part of its U.S. Open contract. =Technology= CBS was the first network to use the MacCam (a system of slow-motion cameras developed by FastCAM Replay LLC and DEL Imaging Systems LLC used during tennis matches to replay close or controversial line calls) widely, as John McEnroe was one of their tennis analysts. The MacCam was first used at the 2004 US Open to demonstrate several poor calls by chair umpires. In Serena Williams' controversial quarterfinal loss to Jennifer Capriati, several poor calls were contested by Williams. Television replays demonstrated that there were actually several crucial calls that were obviously erroneous. In 2010, CBS broadcast the U.S. Open in 3D on DirecTV N3D. =Controversial moments= On September 11, 1987, Dan Rather walked off the set in anger just before a remote broadcast of the CBS Evening News when it appeared that CBS's coverage of a U.S. Open semifinal match between Steffi Graf and Lori McNeil was going to run into time allotted for the network news program. Rather was in Miami covering the visit to the city by Pope John Paul II, who began a rare U.S. tour. The tennis match ended at 6:32 p.m. Eastern Time, however Rather was nowhere to be found. Over 100 affiliates broadcast the six minutes of dead air that followed before he returned to the broadcast position. Rather later suggested that he intended to force the sports division to fill up the entire half-hour so that he would not have to truncate the elaborately-planned coverage of the papal visit. The next day, Rather, anchoring from New Orleans, apologized for leaving the anchor desk. While attending the U.S. Open tennis tournament in New York City in September 1995, Jane Bronstein, who is rather large and disfigured from childhood polio and a thyroid condition, was pictured in CBS file footage from the tournament. Although the footage was never intended to be shown to the public, a few seconds of it was shown during a segment on the Late Show with David Letterman. The footage showed Bronstein devouring a peach in a matter of seconds and then handing the peach pit to a man seated beside her with a horrified look on his face. Although the audience and Letterman's fans found the clip hilarious, Bronstein and her attorney Harvey Rothberg were not amused and sued for damages in February 1996. The case was settled in March 1997 for undisclosed terms. On September 14, 2009, Juan Mart√≠n del Potro upset Roger Federer to win the Men's U.S. Open Championship. Dick Enberg hosted the post- match ceremony during which a victorious Del Potro requested to address his fans in Spanish. Enberg declined the request saying that he was running out of time, but went on to list the corporate-sponsored prizes that Del Potro won. A couple of minutes later, Del Potro made the same request again and only then Enberg relented saying \\"Very quickly, in Spanish, he wants to say hello to his friends here and in Argentina\\". An emotional Del Potro finally spoke a few sentences in Spanish to a cheering crowd. Many viewers expressed disappointment with Enberg and CBS over the interview. A CBS executive later defended Enberg, noting that the contract with the United States Tennis Association required that certain sponsors receive time during the ceremony. In 2010, CBS forced the United States Tennis Association to move the final to Monday out of fear that a relatively short Sunday rain delay was going to knock the Sunday men's final into its prime time lineup (in particular, 60 Minutes). Ironically, the rain by early evening had let up and thus, tennis could have been played. While CBS did get its men's final at 4 p.m. as initially scheduled, another rain delay came about at a little after 6 p.m. By that point however, CBS abandoned its tennis coverage in favor of the CBS Evening News. In the meantime, CBS announced that they wouldn't finish broadcasting the match once the delay had ended. Therefore, viewers had to scramble to ESPN2 to watch the conclusion of that particular Novak Djokovic- Rafael Nadal final. And since ESPN2 themselves eventually had to redirect to the second half of its Monday Night Football doubleheader, it awkwardly had to cut off from Nadal's post-match ceremony.

It was the original center of Chappaqua, prior to the construction of the Harlem Valley Railroad and the erection of its station to the south in the mid-19th century. In 1974 it was recognized as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. What is today Chappaqua was first settled around 1740 by a group of Quakers from Long Island. They built the still-used meeting house, the oldest known building in the town, around which the district centered a decade later. The other contributing properties, all timber frame buildings up and down the road on either side near the meeting house, are the surviving buildings from some of the farms established then and later. They have been preserved intact from that time. Geography The district begins on the west side of the road, approximately 0.6 mi (1 km) north of downtown Chappaqua and the Saw Mill River Parkway interchange, at 332 Quaker Road, just opposite Commodore Road. It follows the south line of that lot, then a line consistent with the west line of that lot through Fair Ridge Cemetery up to 478 Quaker, then turns 100 ft (30 m) to follow the north line and cross the road to take in 485 Quaker. It turns south at the lot corner to create a corridor wide with the road at the center south back to 385 Quaker, just north of Chappaqua Mountain Road, where it returns west to the road and continues back to its southern boundary. The terrain is hilly, forcing the road through some gentle curves as it passes through the district. Despite the extensive residential development in the area, it is still heavily wooded, with many tall trees shading the houses and few clearings. Streams in the area drain into the Saw Mill River, which rises in the woods to the east. Quaker Road climbs approximate from south to north through the district. alt=A square gray rock with a plaque on it commemorating the addition of the historic district to the National Register of Historic Places Within this boundary, along a 0.6-mile (1 km) stretch of Quaker, are with 30 buildings, half of which are contributing properties. All of them, whether contributing or not, are wood frame houses of two to three stories with gabled roofs. Those of more modern construction are sympathetic to their historic neighbors. Except for the meeting house, all are still used as residences. In the middle of a small grassy island at the Chappaqua Mountain Road intersection is a rock with a commemorative plaque to the district attached. History Quakers, fleeing religious persecution in England as Dissenters, settled in British colonies during the 17th century. One group established a meeting on Long Island in 1645. By the early 18th century their offshoots had crossed Long Island Sound to Westchester County, where they established Mamaroneck and Purchase by 1727. In 1730, further offshoots of those groups moved further inland, to Wampus Pond (now Armonk) and \\"Shapequaw\\". Ten years later one of them, John Reynolds, established a farm that included the area of the future district, along Quaker Road from Kipp Street to Roaring Brook Road. By 1747 there were enough Quakers in Shapequaw that they began petitioning the Purchase meeting to establish their own. Permission was granted shortly thereafter, and Reynolds donated two of his acres () to the group so it could build a meeting house and burial ground. alt=A wooden blue house with a wing on the left and a verandah around the middle and right By 1753 the meeting house was finished. In 1776 it would serve as a hospital for Continental Army soldiers injured at the nearby Battle of White Plains. Two years later a wing was built on it. The original Reynolds farm was eventually subdivided. Other farmers, like Samuel Allen and Elnathan Thorn, built houses near the meeting house. By 1825 the area had become the community of what was now known as Chappaqua. The residents were largely self- sufficient farmers with side businesses as craftsmen. That ended with the construction of the Harlem Valley Railroad (still in use today as Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line) in 1846. It followed the river valley, and so the station was built a mile (1.6 km) south of the meeting house. Gradually that area became developed and grew into the downtown Chappaqua that exists today. Allen built a couple of small houses across the road from the meeting house, and cabinetmaker Henry Dodge built a large house at what is today 386 Quaker, moving the older Thorn house in the process. That was the last development in the district related to the original Quaker settlers and their families. As the railroad spurred the suburbanization of northern Westchester in the later 19th and early 20th centuries, the meeting house and associated farm buildings remained in use. However, the economy changed. With the railroad close by, the farmers switched to growing cash crops for the New York City market, and sold some of their larger landholdings. Some buildings, such as the outbuildings on the Thorn‚ÄìDodge property, were destroyed by the 1904 tornado. New construction in the district did not replace any of the historic structures. In 1961 another wing was added to the meeting house. There have been few other changes to the older buildings since then. Significant contributing properties Among the contributing properties, several are particularly important in the context of the district. None have yet been listed individually on the National Register, but they are all local landmarks, carrying markers indicating what they are and their year of construction. *Samuel Allen Farm, 400, 401‚Äì407 Quaker Road. Four buildings remain standing from this farm established sometime before 1820; all were built by 1852. The currying shop, 400, is on the west side, with the main house, tenant house and an old barn. All are similar buildings, four bays wide and from one-and-a-half to two stories high. alt=A white wooden house with a roofed front porch seen from slightly downhill, partially obscured by a tree branch *Thomas Dodge House, 428 Quaker Road. Cabinetmaker Thomas Dodge and his wife Hannah, later inhabitants of the early settlement, built this three-by-two-bay house. Since it is on sloping ground, it is two stories on the east but only one and a half on the west. *Meeting House, 420 Quaker Road. Located on a slight rise above the road, immediately to the west of the Allen properties, the meeting house is a two-story clapboard-sided gabled structure with a full verandah around the south and east. Inside, chamfered wooden posts support a gallery on three sides. It is the oldest known building in the town of New Castle, dating to 1753. *Reynolds‚ÄìCarpenter Farmhouse, 332 Quaker Road. The southern end of the district is anchored by this five-bay, two-story gabled house, one of two likely built for one of Reynolds' seven sons. Its rear wing was added in 1850 by Robert Carpenter. North of it is a barn from the same era, now used as a garage. *Stony Hollow Farmhouse, 478 Quaker Road. This house-and-barn combination is located at the north end of the district. The clapboard-sided house contrasts with the shingled barn, but both are believed to have been built around 1820, with the house expanded later in the 19th century. alt=A two-story, five-bay white wooden house with blue shutters and pent-roofed dormers piercing its gabled roof seen over a fence and through some tree branches. It has a more modern wing on the left *Sutton‚ÄìReynolds House, 354 Quaker Road. Situated to the north of the Reynolds‚ÄìCarpenter House, this similarly-sized house is also believed to have been built by Reynolds for another of his sons. It is distinguished by the two chimneys that rise from either end. *Thorn‚ÄìDodge House, 386 Quaker Road. The rear wing of this five- by-two-bay two-story clapboard-sided gabled house is the original structure built by Elnathan Thorn. Henry Dodge moved it here when he built the current house in 1852. Preservation While New Castle's zoning does not include any special measures for the district, the town has other measures to protect and preserve it. Most prominently, all of the historic properties within the historic district have been designated town landmarks. The town's historic preservation ordinances provide for the designation of local landmarks.New Castle Town Code, ¬ß 76-3, Designation of New Castle landmarks, adopted July 28, 2009; retrieved March 19, 2013.

Life and career  Jocelyn Burton was born in Wales in 1946 and was the daughter of RAF officer Roland (Monty) Burton. Although she intended to study modern languages at Cambridge, she developed an interest in art and applied to study silversmithing at Sir John Cass College in London in 1966, but was rejected for being female. Burton instead enrolled in a jewellery design program and studied silversmithing in evening courses. In 1971, after early successes and awards, Burton set up her own studio and workshop in London.A Sterling Renaissance: British Silver Design 1957-2018. October 2018 ‚Äì May 2019. SFO Museum, San Francisco. Jocelyn died after a long battle with cancer, in Boston Lincolnshire on 5 April 2020, aged 74.  Work  Burton's design process started with drawing, followed by painting, and finally to producing works with precious metals. Much of her early work features oceanic themes, such as seashells and seahorses. Jocelyn's work was varied, often of the Baroque style. Although known for jewellery, Jocelyn was an expert in the design of architectural lighting, table and flatware and many other objects created from precious metal. Burton's commissions include a silver table fountain for the Fishmongers' Company, an 18 carat gold and sapphire chain for the Butchers' Company, an offertory salver for Lichfield Cathedral and a centerpiece commissioned by Sir Roy Strong to launch the permanently exhibited modern plate collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Other works include a set of silver wall sconces for a London financial institution and the Pataudi Trophy, a prize commissioned by the MCC to commemorate the 75th anniversary of India's Test debut, presented when the Indian cricket team toured England in 2007. The MCC loaned the trophy to be exhibited in November and December 2012 at Burton's Bentley & Skinner Exhibition. Burton's work features in private and public collections including, 10 Downing Street, York Minster, Longleat, St Paul's Cathedral and the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. Beyond her major commissions, Burton has created a range of domestic silver as well as jewellery using gold, silver, precious and semi-precious stones. All this work is based on her own designs ‚Äì from preliminary sketches to finished color drawings.  Recognition and awards  In 1968, at the very beginning of her career, Burton won the De Beers International Award for the design of diamond jewellery. In 1995, Burton won the United Kingdom Jeweller Award for best design in silver. Burton had the first piece of platinum to be hallmarked at the London Assay Office in 1973 when hallmarking for platinum was introduced under the Hallmarking Act of 1973 and platinum became a recognized metal under the Vienna Convention on the Control of the Fineness and the Hallmarking of Precious Metal Objects. This piece is at Goldsmiths' Hall. She became a freeman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in 1974. In 2003, Burton was the first woman to receive the City and Guilds of London Institute top award, the Prince Philip Medal. Burton was a member of The People's Supermarket, opened in Lamb's Conduit Street by Arthur Potts Dawson in 2010. Burton regularly appeared in the Channel 4 documentary of the same name in 2011.

Fort Oranje is a 17th-century Dutch fort located at the center of Ternate City on the island of Ternate, one of the Moluccas in Indonesia. The fort is the largest in Ternate Island. Fort Oranje was once the capital of Dutch East India Company's trade empire in Asia until it was moved to Batavia. History 17th century map of Fort Oranje. Ternate is a small volcanic island located in Maluku Islands (The Moluccas). It was the center of the powerful former Sultanate of Ternate. The island was once the world's single major producer of cloves, a commodity which allowed the Sultanate of Ternate to become amongst the most powerful Sultanate in the Indonesian region. The sultans of Ternate was in a continuously conflict with the nearby Sultanate of Tidore. At the end of the 15th century, the Ternatese has adopted Islam as their official religion, which was mainly influenced from the Javanese. The first Europeans to arrive in Ternate were the expedition team led by Francisco Serr√£o. Serr√£o had been shipwrecked near Ceram and was rescued by local inhabitants. Informed by the local Ternatese, the Sultan brought the survivors to Ternate in 1512 and gave permission to the Portuguese to build a fort. Construction of the fort began in 1522, however relationship between the Portuguese and the Sultan was difficult at the beginning of the treaty and deteriorated over time. Following the murder of Sultan Hairun at the hands of the Portuguese, the Ternatese expelled the Portuguese in 1575 after a five-year siege. European power in the region was weak and Ternate became an expanding, fiercely Islamic and anti-Portuguese state under the rule of Sultan Baab Ullah (r. 1570‚Äì1583) and his son Sultan Said. In 1599 two Dutch ships led by Commander Wybrand van Warwijck arrived in Ternate. In 1605 the VOC succeeded in driving the Portuguese out of the Ternate Island but in 1606 the Spanish troops captured the former Portuguese fort and deported the Sultan and his entourage to Manila. In 1607, a VOC admiral Cornelis Matelief de Jonge helped the Sultan of Ternate to expel the Spanish from Ternate. de Jonge succeed in helping the Ternatese, so the Sultanate of Ternate gave permission for the VOC for the spice trade monopoly and allowed the VOC to establish a fort. This new fort, known as Fort Malay, was established on top of an undated Malay Sultan's fortress that has been damaged. In 1609, the first Dutch authority in Ternate Paul van Carden renamed the fort into Fort Oranje, after the House of Orange. Despite of this, the name Fort Malay remained in use after several years later. On February 17, 1613, the Board of Commissioners Heren XVII released the Decision Letter on February 17, 1613, setting the Maluku region as the center of VOC official position; Ternate and Ambon were chosen for the official residence of the Governor-General. This occurred when Pieter Both was appointed the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. At that time Ternate play a bigger role, and so Fort Orange became the official place for the Dutch East Indies Council to do their administrative work related with the Dutch Indies matters; such as holding meetings, making laws, etc. Oranje Fort remains the headquarter of the VOC until it was moved to Batavia in 1619. Around this period Ternate was divided between the Spanish and the Dutch. Under Sultan Hamzah (1627-1648), the territory of Ternate was expanded. A number of territories were given to the VOC in exchange of controlling riots. In 1663 the Spaniards left Ternate and Tidore. In the 18th century, a governor of the VOC was set in Fort Oranje to control the trade in the area of North Maluku. When the VOC went bankrupt, the possessions of VOC were transferred under the administration of the government of Maluku in 1800. Most of the possessions of the former VOC were subsequently occupied by Great Britain during the Napoleonic wars, Fort Oranje was captured in 1810. After the new United Kingdom of the Netherlands was created by the Congress of Vienna, Fort Oranje was restored to the Dutch in 1817. The fort Fort Oranje is the largest fort in Ternate Island. It is rectangular in form, consisting of four stone bulwarks, thick walls, a deep moat, and many cannons. Despite frequent earthquakes in Ternate, the walls of Fort Oranje are still in good condition. Some area of the fort, especially the eastern part, has been refurbished into a park. The interior of the fort is now used by the local army garrison and boarding house for the local police families, which means the interior was not very well-maintained and the ground is littered with rubbish. Other government offices also set inside the fort.

Situated approximately away from the sea, it is within the Jogyesan Provincial Park. While founded in 867, it fell into disuse but was re-established in 1190 by Seon master Jinul. Jinul's meditation teachings evolved from this monastery and contributed significantly to the Seon practice that prevails to this day in Korea. Songgwangsa is considered the \\"jewel\\" (Samgharatna) of the Korean monastic community. Though smaller in size, it is considered as the greatest among the trio of Three Jewels Temples representing ‚Äúthe Buddha, the dharma, and the sangha\\". The other two of the trio, Tongdosa and Haeinsa, are located in South Gyeongsang Province. This monastery, though under the jurisdiction of the Jogye Order in Seoul, functions as an autonomous body. It controls a network of 49 small branch temples whose abbots are chosen from among the monks of the main monastery and who also enjoy a fair degree of independence as long as they function as independent economic units without depending on the main monastery. It currently serves as the head temple for the 21st district of the Jogye Order among the 25 head monasteries of the order. Songgwangsa, one of the oldest Seon temples in Korea, is still very active today as a practice center. Over the centuries, it has been rebuilt many times and is now fully restored. As it has been the residence of many monks, the monastery has an assortment of stele and pagodas which contain the ashes of many monks. One of the oldest living quarters in Korea is located at Songgwangsa, as well as an International Seon Center that is popular with foreigners who seek the experience of living in a Seon temple. Koryo Sa, the first foreign branch of Songgwangsa, was established in Koreatown, Los Angeles, California, US in 1980 by Kusan Sunim. Geography Songgwangsa is located on the west side of Jogyesan in Songgwang-myeon, Suncheon, South Jeolla Province, South Korea. Seonamsa, a quieter hermitage dating to 529, lies on the eastern side of Janggunbong Mountain at , also within the Jogyesan Provincial Park. Songgwangsa, located between Chongju and Maisan, is accessible via Chonju city bus or taxi. The road that accesses Songgwangsa is flanked with giant pine trees and crosses a valley with a round pavilion bridge called Cheongnyanggak, designed as a place to rest.Buswell (1993), p. 49 A stream runs at the entrance to the temple and two bridges cross this stream. One of the bridges has a unique architectural arch. Also seen near the bridge are two independent small houses detached from the main the temple. There are differing versions as to why they were built. One version is that it was meant as a storehouse to keep the mortal remains for a specified period at the request of the dead. The other version is that it was used as a dressing room by the royal family after bathing to adorn their wedding dress prior to marriage. These versions and practices have been reported on in Robert Buswell's The Zen Monastic Experience (1992). Etymology Songgwang means \\"a temple in which 18 great monks will spread the teaching of Buddha\\", \\"Song\\" referring to the 18 great men and \\"Gwang\\" to the spreading of Buddhism. History Little is known about the early history of Gilsangsa, a temple built during Silla on the site that is now Songgwangsa. It was built by Seon master Hyerin who also built a hermitage and lived there. It was about one hundred kan () in size (about ), and included 30 to 40 monks. As there is no information about Hyerin, Buswell (1991) states that scholars may have devised Hyerin as a legendary figure who predated the arrival of Jinul. Gilsangsa was abandoned for over fifty years but was reconstructed over a nine-year period in the 1190s to become an important centre of Korean Buddhism and as a centre for scholarly learning of the Jeonghyegyeolsa movement. Historical records indicate that Zen Master Chinul (Son or Hwa'om Master) established Songgwangsa in 1190 on Jogyesan. There are several legends related to the origin of the temple. However, Chinul, the national master Bojo, is said to have flown a black kite made of wood in Mt. Mohu, and where it landed he named it Chirakdae, meaning \\"the place where a black kite landed\\". The mountain was later renamed as Mount Songgwang. The monastery has had a turbulent history, affected by the Second Japanese invasion (1597‚Äì1598) and the Korean War. One of the former abbots, Sokchin, wrote an anthology in 1932 based on extant references of the history of Songgwangsa. Master Kusan (1901‚Äì1983), an important disciple of Hyobong, was ordained and resided at the temple for some time in the 1940s. It has produced 16 national preceptors. Seokjo, during the reign of Injong of Goryeo, was said to have had grand plans to expand the temple but died before his plans could take effect. The temple was rebuilt in the 17th century when Buddhism was regaining popularity. Renovations carried out after 1988 were very elaborate and extensive with original foundations as the base structure. The refurbishing involved 14 buildings including the main hall. The uniqueness of the monastery built after 1988 is unlike that of other great monasteries. Architecture The layout plan of the monastery closely resembles the \\"ocean-seal chart also called the dharma-wheel chart\\", said to be a diagram indicative of the Korean doctrine of Hwa'om.Buswell (1993), p. 50 The elevation of the main temple building (Daeungbojeon), gives a double roofed appearance. The main temple or hall (Taeung-chon, \\"Basilica of the Great Hero\\"), is accessed via a single beam gate known as an ilichu-mun, and is built in the traditional style with wooden beams. It contains a shrine of Vairocana, the DharmakƒÅya Buddha, and relics related to the Hwaeom school of Buddhism, illustrating the importance of this philosophy in Korean Buddhism. The main hall houses the three main statues of the past Buddha, Dƒ´pankara Buddha, the \\"current\\" Buddha, Gautama Buddha, and the future Buddha, Maitreya. The main shrine of the central temple is about high on a wooden altar but has space surrounding it so that visiting pilgrims can circumambulate around it. The entry hall contains the statues of the four heavenly kings (sach'onwang) which act as Dharma protectors to ward off evil spirits. To the side of the main building is the Jijangjeon, which contains a Buddha statue and the Seungbojeo, which explains its affiliation and importance to the Seon. Just below the main temple complex, which is crafted in wood, is a group of stone stelae, all measuring roughly in height, that display the history of the monastery.Buswell (1993), p. 49-51 An ancient hitching post near this area would historically have served government officials and other eminent visitors. The nearby Drum and the Bell Tower (Chonggo-ru) houses many implements used domestically in the monastery's history. The Teaching Hall, the Masters' Portrait Hall and the residence of the Spiritual Leader are located at the highest elevation but not the main hall. Also near the Spiritual Leader‚Äôs residence is a small house with a conventional chimney that dates to the 15th century, said to belong to his deputy, and believed to be ‚Äúone of the oldest living quarters in Korea.\\" Features Several statues surround the main temple building and a giant, colourful taenghwa (scroll painting) hangs behind the main image, depicting a Buddhist pantheon. The main image deified on a wooden altar is very tall, covering the entire height from floor to the ceiling. There is also a portrait of the guardian general of Buddhism, Wita, on one of the side walls, which is akin to 16th century portraits found in China. The temple complex has three great treasures: the Bisari Gusi, Ssanghyangsu, and the Neunggyeonnansa. The Bisari Gusi is a massive rice container made from trees (two large Chinese juniper trees) which can contain enough rice to feed 4000 monks. Sanghyangsu takes the form of two very large Chinese juniper trees (Juniperus chinensis) and Neunggyeonnansa is an intricately designed plate. Religious festivals =Buddha‚Äôs birthday= Buddha‚Äôs Birthday (Bucheonim oshin nal) festival is a gala annual festival that is celebrated in all Buddhist monasteries in Korea on the eight-day of the fourth lunar month (corresponds Gregorian calendar month of early May) which corresponds to two weeks prior to the start of the summer retreat. On this occasion, paper lanterns or lamps with candles are lit which are strung around all the shrines within the monastery and in series of rows in the central courtyard. The most ornate type of lantern is the lotus flower type. These are usually professionally made by women monks of the subsidiary monasteries of Songgwangsa. The lanterns are also put up for sale at the main entrance of the monastery. According to a learned monk of the Songgwangsa monastery, the practice of lantern lighting is linked to the Jataka tales of Buddha's past lives. The largest lamps inside the main shrine hall have been dedicated in the past to President Park Chung-hee and his wife. Food offerings for lunch and dinner at an improvised altar and dharma lectures are a common feature on this occasion. The Songgwangsa is on this day open to the public. That is, only once a year when monks are seen holding guard at all the shrines and halls of the monastery, with the exception of the main meditation hall and the private rooms of the monks which are barred for public viewing. On this day offering of lamps is considered a meritorious deed as it is said, \\"If someone, wanting to make merit, respectfully offers a bright lamp or even a small candle before the images enshrined inside a stupa or shrine ‚Ä¶, that merit can not be comprehended by any of the ≈õrƒÅvakas or pratyekabuddhas; only the Buddhas, tathagatas can comprehend it.\\"Buswell (1993), pp. 43‚Äì44 In the evening, lighting ceremony is held when lay people who have bought lamps or lanterns light them by placing a candle inside the lantern, at about 7.30 PM. The lighted lamps are a delightful sight to behold, walking around the monastery or viewing from the top of a nearby hill. The lamps are later dimmed to mark the end of the ceremony. =New Year day= Another notable festival is the New Year (sollal) day that is observed with piety and gaiety, according to the Solar calendar in late January or early February, every year. The festival, which starts with New Year‚Äôs eve lasts for three days.Buswell (1993), p. 46 Painting of Meditation in the main hall =Meditations= Apart from the festivals, the monastery observes two meditation seasons, which are an integral feature of Korean Buddhism, in the tradition of the historical Buddha; both are two 3-month meditation seasons, one in winter and the other in summer, scheduled according to the lunar calendar. Normally, 120 monks attend these meditations, which are still practiced in Korean Buddhism. The number of resident monks attending the meditation practices fluctuates according to season, and generally there are about 120 monks during meditation seasons and 70 monks during the off seasons. During this period monks meditate for 12 hours, and even more severe order of continuous 24 hours period of meditation is observed with the objective of creating and also building impetus and energy for achieving progress on the path of enlightenment.

The floods forced the evacuation of thousands of people from towns and cities. At least 90 towns and over 200,000 people were affected. Damage initially was estimated at around A$1 billion before it was raised to $2.38 billion. The estimated reduction in Australia's GDP is about A$30 billion. As at March 2012, there were 33 deaths attributed to the 2010‚Äì11 Queensland floods with a further three people still missing. Three-quarters of the council areas within the state of Queensland were declared disaster zones. Communities along the Fitzroy and Burnett Rivers were particularly hard hit, while the Condamine, Ballone, and Mary Rivers recorded substantial flooding. An unexpected flash flood caused by a thunderstorm raced through Toowoomba's central business district. Rainfall from the same storm devastated communities in the Lockyer Valley. A few days later, thousands of houses in Ipswich and Brisbane were inundated as the Brisbane River rose and Wivenhoe Dam used a considerable proportion of its flood mitigation capacity. Volunteers were quick to offer assistance, and sympathy was expressed from afar. A large mobilisation of the Australian Defence Force was activated and a relief fund created. The head of the recovery taskforce was Major General Michael Slater. The Queensland Reconstruction Authority (CEO was Graeme Newton) was formed to coordinate the rebuilding program beyond the initial task force, and a Commission of Inquiry was established to investigate all matters related to the floods. The state's coal industry was particularly hard hit. The Queensland floods were followed by the 2011 Victorian floods which saw more than fifty communities in western and central Victoria also grapple with significant flooding. Background track of Cyclone Tasha Brisbane experienced major flooding in 1893 and 1974 as the Brisbane River broke its bank and inundated low-lying areas. Towns, including St. George and Theodore, had dealt with major flooding earlier in 1996. The floods were a result of heavy rainfall caused by Tropical Cyclone Tasha that combined with a trough during the peak of a La Ni√±a Modoki event. The 2010 La Ni√±a Modoki weather pattern, which brings wetter conditions to eastern Australia, was the strongest since 1973. This La Ni√±a event caused a prolonged event of heavy rainfall over Queensland river catchments. Record or near record sea surface temperatures were recorded off the Queensland coast in late 2010. December 2010 was Queensland's wettest on record, with record-high rainfall totals set in 107 locations for the month. The state's average rainfall level of exceeded the previous record of set in 1975.\\"Queensland in December 2010: The wettest December on record\\" Monthly Climate Summary for Queensland. 4 January 2011. Bureau of Meteorology. Product code IDCKGC24R0. Retrieved 12 January 2011 2010 was also recorded as the state's wettest spring since 1900,\\"Queensland in spring 2010: The wettest spring\\" Wednesday, 1 December 2010. Bureau of Meteorology. Product code IDCKGC14R0. Retrieved 12 January 2011 and the Australian continent's third-wettest year. Climate scientist Kevin Trenberth thought climate change was a contributing factor in the unusually high precipitation rates. He attributed a half-degree Celsius rise in ocean temperatures around Australia to global warming (which produces extra water vapour and intensifies the monsoon). Other scientists say that it is too early to draw such a conclusion. Assertions were also made by Professor Hubert Chanson, an expert in dam and reservoir engineering with extensive firsthand knowledge of the Wivenhoe system, that mismanagement of the Wivenhoe Dam might be a contributor to the some flooding in the lower Brisbane valley. While an expert engineer, Michael O'Brien‚Äîa senior manager of an ASX-listed resources company and an outside consultant evaluating cause‚Äîagrees that \\"massive releases of water from Wivenhoe Dam on Tuesday, January 11, did indeed produce most of the flooding in the Brisbane River the following afternoon, with a peak in the early hours of Thursday morning, January 13. The dam's releases into the Brisbane River also caused the Bremer River, which winds through the city of Ipswich, and the Lockyer Creek to back up and cause much of the flooding outside Brisbane.\\" This was corroborated by a panel of engineers hired by Insurance Council of Australia. O'Brien also found that the Wivenhoe Dam and Somerset Dam did not hold the maximum capacity they were capable of holding during the crisis period, which would have significantly alleviated flooding. Only one source, Neal Ashkanasy, who specialises in social and organisational psychology (and 35 years ago was involved in the design of Wivenhoe Dam), found fault with these results and instead finds that the dam was operated correctly throughout the time of the storm and the flood that followed, saying the \\"dam was run with outstanding precision.\\" Isolated flooding started across parts of the state in early December. On 23 December, a monsoonal trough crossed the coast from the Coral Sea, bringing torrential rain that fell in a broad swath from the Gulf of Carpentaria to the Gold Coast. The widest range of intense rainfall occurred on 27 December (with very high daily totals recorded on 25 December, near where Cyclone Tasha crossed the coast). By 30 December vast areas of Southern and Central Queensland were affected by the flood. The conditions led to a large influx of snakes in the Rockhampton area, as well as some crocodiles. Extent NASA image showing swollen rivers and cloud cover. Flooding was widespread across Queensland and New South Wales from the end of December 2010 to January 2011 with several separate rain events causing rivers to rise over a lengthy period. Many places, including Condamine and Chinchilla were inundated by flood waters on multiple occasions. About 300 roads were closed, including nine major highways. During the flooding it was reported that more than three-quarters of Queensland was affected by flooding.'La Ni√±a and monsoonal winds flood northern Australia', New Scientist, 8 January 2011, p. 6. =Fitzroy River basin= Rockhampton seen from the air on 31 December; the Fitzroy River can be seen to have burst its banks View of the swollen Fitzroy River, which surrounds the western half of Rockhampton The flooding initially forced the evacuation of 1,000 people from Theodore and other towns, described as unprecedented by the acting chief officer of the Emergency Management Queensland. The military transported residents by helicopter to an evacuation centre at Moura. The total evacuation of a Queensland town was a first for the state. Major flooding at Theodore persisted for more than two weeks. Emerald was cut off by road on 29 December as the Nogoa River rose. By the next day, the river surpassed the 2008 flood peak level of . At the peak of the flooding, 80% of the town was flooded, the worst the town ever experienced. Twelve hundred Emerald residents registered as evacuees. Rockhampton had nearly a week to prepare for an expected flood peak from the Fitzroy River, which courses through the centre of the city. The airport was closed on 1 January. A metal flood barrier was erected around the terminal to prevent flood-borne debris from causing damage to the structure. An evacuation centre was set up at the Central Queensland University. The Bruce Highway leading south out of Rockhampton was closed to traffic. The river peaked at , just short of the predicted maximum. The Port of Gladstone reduced its export capacity because the coal stockpiles at the port were saturated and further coal deliveries could not be made by rail. The Goonyella railway line which serves a number of coal mines in the Bowen Basin was closed for one week and shipments of grain were also delayed. =Burnett River basin= The swollen Burnett River at Gayndah, north west of Brisbane A flooded paddock in Warwick The central Burnett towns of Gayndah and Mundubbera saw major flooding on 28‚Äì29 December. The Burnett River peaked at at Mundubbera‚Äîthe highest river height since 1942‚Äîinundating more than 20 houses. Downstream at Gayndah, the river peaked at with floodwaters reaching two houses. Both towns were isolated for several days and there was major disruption to the potable water supply and local agricultural production. Bundaberg experienced severe flooding, the worst in 40 years, after the Burnett River flooded the city, although the Paradise Dam reservoir contributed to some flood mitigation. This resulted in the evacuation of 300 homes. The Bundaberg Port, a major sugar exporting facility, was closed late in December 2010 as flooding deposited silt in the port, forcing its closure. The port re-opened in early March 2011 after successful dredging operations allowed ships to berth. =Condamine/Balonne River basin= Chinchilla and Jericho were also inundated. At least 40 residents were evacuated from Chinchilla. Flooding in Dalby was the worst since 1981. The town's water purification system was flooded, resulting in water restrictions that hampered clean-up efforts. of water were transported to the town of 14,000 residents. Warwick was isolated when all roads into the town were cut off. The Condamine River reached on 30 December, its highest level ever recorded. Condamine was mandatorily evacuated on 30 December. A second rain event on 9‚Äì10 January saw floodwaters again threaten Chinchilla and Condamine with Chinchilla residents again asked to evacuate. The Macintyre River, which forms part of the border between the Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland, began to threaten the town of Goondiwindi on 13 January. While the town is protected by an levee, the local hospital and aged care home were evacuated as a precaution and an evacuation centre was established. =Mary River basin= Heavy rain in the Mary River catchment on 8‚Äì9 January 2011 led to flooding at Maryborough and Gympie. The Mary River at Maryborough was expected to initially peak at at midday 9 January with some houses and businesses inundated by flood waters. =Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley = Long and Mackenzie Streets in suburban Toowoomba flooded. The city of Toowoomba, in the Darling Downs, was hit by flash flooding after more than of rain fell in 36 hours to 10 January 2011; this event caused four deaths in a matter of hours. Cars were washed away (see video). Toowoomba sits on the watershed of the Great Dividing Range, some above sea level. A three-week period where it had rained on all but three days had left the soil around Toowoomba super saturated and when a line of storms hit the city on 10 January, the resulting torrential rain rapidly ran off down gullies and streets. The central business district of the city sits in a small valley where two small water courses‚ÄîEast Creek and West Creek‚Äîmeet to form Gowrie Creek. Unable to cope with the volume of water heading toward them, the creeks burst their banks, pushing a devastating wall of water through the city centre. This water then headed west‚Äînot towards the Lockyer Valley which was also experiencing extreme rainfall that fell on eastern facing slopes. The surge associated with rainfall which fell on the eastern side of the range passed through the Lockyer Valley town of Withcott, where the force of the water pushed cars into shops and forced the evacuation of hundreds of people. The scene was described by an onlooker as \\"like Cyclone Tracy has gone through it ... If you dropped an atom bomb on it, you couldn't tell the difference.\\" Nearby Helidon had several homes and farms flooded but did not break the main creek bank and enter the town. It was cut off from all sides by destroyed roads. Grantham was also devastated by the surge of water. Houses were left crumpled by what Premier of Queensland Anna Bligh described as an \\"inland tsunami\\". According to local media, the flood waters had reached a height of by the time it struck Grantham. The peak discharge rate around Withcott and Grantham where Lockyer Creek is joined by Gatton Creek, was estimated to be 3,500 m3 second. At least 100 people were evacuated to the Helidon Community Hall. Nine people were confirmed dead, and many more feared dead among 66 reported missing. The body of one victim washed away at Grantham was recovered downstream and Queensland Police Commissioner Bob Atkinson warned that some bodies may never be found. Nearby Gatton saw voluntary evacuations as the Lockyer Creek rose to a record height of , exceeding the previous record set in the 1893 Queensland floods. Three people from Grantham listed as missing were officially declared dead by the Coroner on 5 June 2012. =Brisbane River catchment= Wheel of Brisbane during the floods. This detailed astronaut photograph illustrates flooding in suburbs of the Brisbane metropolitan region. Flooding began to affect low-lying areas of Brisbane on the morning of 11 January 2011. By around 2:30 p.m. AEST, the Brisbane River broke its banks leading to evacuations in the Brisbane CBD and the suburbs of Fortitude Valley and West End. An evacuation centre was established for flood-affected residents at the RNA Showgrounds in Bowen Hills. Residents of 2,100 Brisbane streets were advised to evacuate prior to the arrival of floods, which struck the city on 12 January. Lord Mayor Campbell Newman stated than an estimated 20,000 homes would be affected when the river peaked on 14 January. He subsequently advised that the Brisbane River transport infrastructure had been \\"substantially destroyed\\". The Brisbane River peaked on 13 January at a lower level than predicted, but still 20,000 houses in Brisbane were inundated. Some of the Brisbane suburbs worst affected by the floods were St Lucia, West End, Rocklea and Graceville. The floods damaged some of Brisbane's icons. The Brisbane Riverwalk, a floating walkway over the Brisbane River linking the inner city neighbourhoods of Fortitude Valley and New Farm, broke up, with a section forming a \\"floating missile\\" that threatened the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges. The largest part of the floating boardwalk was safely guided under the bridge by a tugboat and past other infrastructure before being safely secured. Brisbane's major Rugby league and Soccer (Association Football) venue, Suncorp Stadium, filled with water up to deep, reaching the third or fourth row of seats. With the flood peaking at in Brisbane City, the flood level was about the tenth-highest in the city's history, several metres below the 1890 flood and the two major floods in 1893. Some unique field measurements about the peak of the floods showed very substantial sediment fluxes in the Brisbane River flood plains consistent with the murky appearance of floodwaters. The field deployment showed also some unusual features of flood flow in an urban environment linked with some local topographic effects. Parts of the western suburbs of Brisbane were cut off for three days. Resident of suburbs including Bellbowrie, Karana Downs, Moggill and Pullenvale were running low on food and other items when Moggill Road was cut, until the Australian Army was able to reach the area on 15 January with supplies. The Bremer River at Ipswich, west of Brisbane, reached a height of on 12 January, inundating the central business district and at least 3,000 houses. One third of the city was reported to be underwater and over 1,100 people took shelter at evacuation centres. At Minden, on the border of Ipswich City, a four-year- old boy was swept away by floodwaters when he fell from a rescue boat. A man in his fifties died when he accidentally drove into floodwaters in the Ipswich suburb of Wulkuraka. The worst affected areas of Ipswich were the suburbs of Goodna and Gailes. The flooding allowed bull sharks to reach the center of Goodna; one was spotted swimming in Williams Street, and a second in Queen Street. Further upstream, Hubners Bridge and Richards Bridge near Kilcoy were washed away. Both bridges have been rebuilt and reopened in 2012. =Elsewhere= In South East Queensland, the Wivenhoe Dam filled to a level equivalent to 191% of its supply capacity on 11 January 2011. Although the dam can hold the equivalent of 225% of its supply capacity, storage exceeding 100% is required to be progressively released through the floodgates to restore capacity to mitigate future flood events. Brisbane experienced its wettest December since 1859. Wyaralong Dam, near Beaudesert, had recently been completed and was praised for mitigating flooding in downstream Logan, having exceeded 80% of its capacity. In North Queensland, the town of Ingham became isolated as the Herbert River peaked. Homes at Babinda and Gordonvale were flooded. Deaths Flooding of a caravan park and motorway at Ipswich suburb of Gailes. As of March 2012, 33 deaths have been attributed to the floods with 3 people still missing. The first death occurred on 30 November 2010, when a woman drowned in her vehicle near Dysart. In the following weeks, five others died from similar circumstances. Nine people drowned after being caught directly by the flowing waters and thirteen people died in other circumstances. Thirteen-year-old Jordan Lucas Rice died 10 January 2011 after insisting that his 10-year-old brother, Blake, be saved from the flood waters before him. He drowned along with his mother, 43-year-old Donna Maree Rice, both being residents of Toowoomba. He has been called an Australian hero by the media and in 2015 was post-humously awarded the Australian Bravery Medal for his sacrifice. Response =Public response= More than 55,000 volunteers registered to help clean up the streets of Brisbane, with thousands more unregistered volunteers wandering the muddy streets with gumboots and mops. Prime Minister Julia Gillard said the volunteering effort showed tremendous 'Aussie spirit' and that, \\"... right across Queensland today people have got up, they've marched out of their homes and they've gone to find people to help. It's a tremendous spirit of volunteering right across Queensland ...\\".Transcript of press conference, Grafton 15 Jan 2011 ‚Äì Prime Minister of Australia Press Office ‚Äì retrieved 13 December 2011. =Reaction= Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard toured flood-affected areas on 31 December, the day before The Queen (Elizabeth II), sent her expressions of concern and sympathy for the victims of the floods to her representative in Queensland, Governor Penelope Wensley. The Queen later made a donation to her Queensland premier's flood relief appeal, as did her son, The Prince of Wales. In March 2011, The Prince's eldest son, Prince William, toured the affected areas in Queensland, as well as those damaged by the floods in Victoria. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated, \\"On behalf of President Obama and the people of the United States, I offer my condolences for the loss of life and damage in Queensland caused by the recent flooding.\\" US President Barack Obama said he was ready to help. John Key, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, held a telephone call with Gillard, during which she thanked New Zealand for its help. Len Brown, the Mayor of Auckland, a sister city of Brisbane, offered assistance to Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman. David Cameron, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom offered his sympathies. Downing Street stated: \\"The Prime Minister offered his deep sympathy on behalf of the British people for those who have died, those who have lost their homes and all those who have been affected by the floods in Queensland.\\" =Recovery= Major General Michael Slater was appointed head of a civilian recovery task force. Slater was at the time also the Commander of the 1st Division based at the Gallipoli Barracks in Enoggera, Brisbane. The taskforce was later replaced by the Queensland Reconstruction Authority, a new body created to co-ordinate the rebuilding program. The Australian Defence Force's contribution to flood relief efforts was designated Operation Queensland Flood Assist. The ADF established Joint Task Force 637, based at Enoggera Barracks in Brisbane, for operational command on 1 January 2011. According to the Australian Prime Minister, the deployment was the largest for a natural disaster since Cyclone Tracy. About 35 State Emergency Service personnel from New South Wales and 20 personnel from Victoria were deployed to provide relief to exhausted staff and volunteers. A national appeal was established on 29 December, with the state and federal governments giving A$1 million each. Small businesses and primary producers in 13 local government areas became eligible for grants of up to A$25,000 to pay for costs from damage incurred as a result of the floods. National Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements were made available to a total of 31 local government areas across Queensland. New Zealand announced that the country would send two fifteen-member civil defence teams to assist in flood rescue efforts. In addition to this, New Zealand sent a number of New Zealand Defence Force soldiers, mainly engineers, as well as New Zealand Police and New Zealand Fire Service firefighters. A New Zealand Red Cross team was also dispatched. =Aid efforts= On 9 January, the Flood Relief Appeal: Australia Unites telethon broadcast by the Nine Network from the Suncorp Piazza at South Bank Parklands, Brisbane raised more than A$10 million in pledged aid. The South Bank area, which includes the Wheel of Brisbane, was itself inundated by flood waters only two days later. At the first Twenty20 cricket match between Australia and England in Adelaide on 12 January, both teams donated part of their match fees to help the victims and A$28,450 was collected from people in attendance. On 16 January, the day before the 2011 Australian Tennis Open commenced, a number of players took part in the Rally for Relief which was held at Rod Laver Arena and attended by 15,000 people, which raised A$750,000. The Seven Network televised the event. Players who took part included Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Lleyton Hewitt, Novak Djokovic and Andy Roddick. On 27 January, the 2011 Legends of Origin charity match was contested between former New South Wales and Queensland Rugby League State of Origin players. Organised by Mark Geyer, the match raised $380,587 to go towards the recovery effort.Legends Of Origin Match Home  NRL  Triple M On 13 January, Queensland Writers Centre, in partnership with Brisbane author Rebecca Sparrow, launched Writers on Rafts to raise funds for flood-affected writing communities. Authors, bloggers, publishers, organisations, festivals, and industry professionals across Australia donated their books, professional skills, and expertise, to drive and promote a fundraiser, and local celebrities donated their time to attend the Ultimate Girly High Tea. Over the course of four months, they raised over $31,000. All funds raised went to the Queensland Premier's Disaster Relief Appeal. =Criticism= On 11 January 2011, former deputy director of the New South Wales State Emergency Service Chas Keys stated that he was \\"appalled by the situation in Queensland at the moment. The large number of new houses that have been flooded proves that land management by the Queensland government is extremely poor and building is still going on in inappropriate areas.\\" He contrasted the approach in Queensland with the practices developed in NSW after the 1955 Hunter Valley floods, that aimed to move homes out of dangerous areas and establish warning systems. Keys also stated the NSW practices were being undone by reduced funding and unsafe housing developments, giving the example of Maitland where \\"the council now wants to build hundreds of dwellings on the flood plain in and round the CBD\\". Keys also expressed concern over deforestation, stating that, \\"What we need is re-forestation.\\" =Inquiry= Ferries return to the Brisbane River on 14 February 2011. On 17 January 2011, Queensland premier Anna Bligh announced a Commission of Inquiry into the 2010‚Äì11 Queensland floods. The Commission's Terms of reference cover a wide array of related aspects and stipulate a final report would be due in one year. On 1 August 2011 the Commission handed an interim report to Ms Bligh, and the final report containing 177 recommendations on 16 February 2012. = Mandatory disaster insurance = In return for Senator Nick Xenophon's support of the Queensland Flood Levy, the Government will modify the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements and force the states to take up disaster insurance. = Legal action = On 8 July 2014 legal firm Maurice Blackburn lodged a class action with the NSW Supreme Court on behalf of 4,000 flood victims. The legal action alleges negligence and nuisance against the operators of the dams: Seqwater, SunWater and the State of Queensland. On 29 November 2019, the NSW Supreme Court ruled that the 6,800 class members who ultimately joined the action against the above defendants were victims of negligence. An order as to costs was expected to be made in February 2020. Impacts The severe rainfall across Queensland resulted in a drop in world sea level by as much as 7 mm. The drop lasted for around 18 months and has been attributed to Australia's arheic and endorheic basins which soaked up the water previously evaporated from the oceans. =Economic= Queensland's raw coal production declined by more one third in late 2010 and was slow to recover Queensland Treasurer Andrew Fraser said it was not possible to put a figure on the damage; \\"other than to say the damage bill is going to start with a b and not an m\\". The floods will cost the Australian economy at least A$10 billion. In figures released at the end of January 2011, the Insurance Council of Australia calculated that 38,460 individual claims were lodged with insurers which were worth A$1.51 billion. Nearly half of those claims were for damage to homes and more than half were made by those living in Brisbane. The price of food across Australia will go up. The floods will cost supermarket chains tens of millions of dollars. Some communities isolated by floodwaters experienced food shortages, and a rise in the cost of fruits and vegetables was reported shortly after. Food supplies to northern Queensland were disrupted requiring groceries to be transported to Townsville by ship. Coal railway lines were closed and numerous mine sites flooded. According to an analysist at Macquarie Group almost all the available stockpiles of coking coal in Queensland were exhausted in late January 2011 due to reduced rail capacity. About 15% of the state's annual output of coal production was lost and by late March 2011 recovery was progressing slowly. Four months after the floods the Dalrymple Bay coal terminal was operating at half its capacity as the open-cut mines in the region continued to deal with de-watering issues. Swimming pool salt was in short supply as salt mines near Rockhampton were flooded. Thousands of litres of milk had to be dumped because it could not be transported for processing. The persistent wet conditions also caused health problems for livestock. There was severe damage to roadways in forestry plantations across wide areas of the south of the state.

Among its many late 19th- and early 20th- century commercial buildings are many of the village's major landmarks‚Äîthree bank buildings, four churches, its village hall, former post office and high school. It was recognized as a historic district in 1989 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as one of the few downtowns in Westchester County with its social and historical development intact. One of its contributing properties, the First Baptist Church of Ossining, was previously listed on the Register in 1973. The Old Croton Aqueduct, a portion of which passes through the district, was listed on the Register the following year and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1992. Among the architects represented in the district are Robert W. Gibson, Isaac G. Perry and James Gamble Rogers. Ossining began developing at the crossroads in the late 18th century, and continued to prosper as industry, along with Sing Sing prison and the railroad, developed along the nearby shore of the Hudson River. It soon became Westchester's first incorporated village. The downtown area was fully developed by the mid-19th century, but two events later in the century reshaped it. The aqueduct was built through the area to carry water to New York City, requiring the demolition of some buildings. In the early 1870s several fires destroyed other buildings, thus most that remain date from that period to the early 1930s. Later in the 20th century the buildings on the south side of Main Street were demolished as part of urban renewal efforts. Some of the oldest buildings on the other side were also lost in another fire. Little has been built to replace them, and the village has only recently begun serious redevelopment efforts although the area has become home to restaurants and home-furnishings stores that cater to the area's Latin American and Portuguese immigrant populations. A comprehensive plan adopted in the early 21st century has led to new zoning for the area meant to encourage mixed-use development. An expansion of the district to include Highland Cottage and some other buildings, also called for in the plan, was granted in 2013. Geography The district is a area shaped roughly like an upside down \\"Y\\". Its boundaries mostly follow property lines and street curbs. It is built around South Highland Avenue (U.S. Route 9), the main north‚Äìsouth through road, and Main Street, which leads west to the river. At its northern end is 21‚Äì22 Croton Avenue, adjacent to the village municipal building along (New York State Route 133). It includes the bank building at the corner with South Highland and then crosses the street to follow the rear line of all the properties on Main Street, the area traditionally known as the Crescent due to the curve resulting from the area's topography. This takes it to the southwest, crossing the aqueduct trailway. At Brandreth Street it veers westward to take in the properties to 55 Central Avenue and, to their south, 107 Main Street. alt=A map of the streets in downtown Ossining, on a gray background with major roads in pink and orange and the locations of some landmarks indicated. The border of the irregularly-shaped historic district is in red. Four small green-bordered areas are adjacent to it. Then it returns eastward along Main, crossing the aqueduct again to the north side of Church Street. It turns south to follow the rear lines of the properties along South Highland, two commercial buildings and Trinity Episcopal Church, then returns to South Highland at Maple Place. It follows the east side of the road to Emwilton Place, where it turns east to include Ossining United Methodist Church. Past the church it turns north again to include all the buildings of Ossining High School while excluding its more modern athletic facilities. At the high school property's north boundary it turns west again to the rear lines of properties on South Highland, and follows them back to Village Hall. The 37 buildings and structures within these boundaries are overwhelmingly commercial structures, usually brick buildings of two or three stories. The rest are institutional, either religious or governmental in use. All but 14 are considered contributing properties. Within the district the land slopes slightly to the north and west, anticipating steeper drops of almost 100 feet (30 m) to the Sing Sing Kill gorge and Hudson. As a result of its proximity to these bluffs the district has a view across the Hudson. To the east and south are the residential neighborhoods of Ossining; in 2013 the district boundary was expanded to include Highland Cottage, also listed on the Register. The village's 2009 comprehensive plan called for expanding the historic district boundaries, at least for local purposes. Four small areas were proposed for inclusion: the additional properties on Central Avenue, a westward expansion along Main Street, Highland Cottage and the building to the east of the municipal building on Croton Avenue at the northeast corner of the district. These areas were added to the district by the U.S. National Park Service in 2013. History The development of downtown Ossining has several distinct stages. In the early preindustrial period, it was primarily a crossroads. Most of the district's buildings, including the four churches, were built and rebuilt along Main Street in the late 19th century. New construction shifted back to Highland Avenue in the early 20th century and gave the district its important public buildings. Since then the community's focus has been devoted to preserving and redeveloping those buildings. =1680s: Formation of the town= Frederick Philipse bought the area which presently constitutes the Town of Ossining from the Sint Sinck Native American tribe in 1685. His Manor extended from Spuyten Duyvil Creek on the border between present day Manhattan and the Bronx to the Croton River. The last Lord of the Manor, Frederick III, a Loyalist in the American Revolutionary War, fled to England afterwards, so the state of New York seized the manor in 1779. =1780s‚Äì1840s: Crossroads and port= When the vast Philipse family landholdings in today's Westchester and Putnam counties were confiscated by the state of New York they were divided among new owners. Elijah Hunter, an officer during the war, bought the tract just south of Sing Sing Kill. He also started holding prayer meetings at his and other settlers' houses; the group formally became the First Baptist Church in 1790. Looking North from Ossining, an 1867 alt=A painting in which wooded land at the right yields to a cleared drop in the center and left with a view of a wide river and hills beyond The river shoreline became the hub of early development. Produce from farms inland was brought there to be shipped to New York City via what is now Main Street, which connected to the Albany Post Road, now US 9. To open the port to even more farmers, the Croton Turnpike (now NY 133) was built early in the 19th century. Settlement and development began to concentrate around the crossroads. The Union Hotel, just north of the Croton Turnpike, became the travelers' stop identified with Ossining. The local Presbyterian congregation built its first meetinghouse at the present site of Trinity Episcopal Church in 1803. By 1813 it became Sing Sing, Westchester's first incorporated village. The First Baptist Church built its first building at its current site in 1815. In 1820, a relocation of the Post Road a thousand feet (305 m) to the east benefited the new village at the expense of Sparta, the unincorporated hamlet a mile (1.6 km) to the south, since Sparta was no longer on the road while Sing Sing and the Union Hotel still were. Five years later, the local economy was further bolstered when the state built Sing Sing, one of its first prisons, on the river just to the southwest of the village. Marble quarried by convicts was used to build not only the prison but several other buildings in the area, including Ossining's oldest church, St. Paul's, now Calvary Episcopal Church, downtown outside the historic district, and elsewhere, such as the steps of the state capitol and New York City Hall. The churches grew with the village. In 1834, the Baptist church was renovated, and the Presbyterians built a new Greek Revival church. Many of the commercial buildings in that style along Main Street west of the crossroads were demolished when the Croton Aqueduct, a masonry tunnel, was built in 1839 to connect Croton Dam with the reservoirs in Central Park. The buildings in that style at 151‚Äì155 Main Street, built afterwards further east, survived and were the oldest buildings in the district when it was established, but are no longer extant. Only the clapboard Italianate house at 23 South Highland, one of the few residences in the district and now its oldest building, survives from the pre-Civil War period. =1840s‚Äì1870: The railroad comes to Ossining= In the middle of the century, the Hudson River Railroad was built along the shoreline. With the village now within an hour's ride of New York City, its population grew over 50 percent between 1845 and 1855. The railroad's effects on the economy were both beneficial and detrimental. It enhanced the agricultural business through the crossroads, and spurred development of industry at the waterfront such as Benjamin Brandreth's pill factory. Industries that had been a source of Ossining's early growth, such as boat-building on the riverside and transportation-related businesses like hotels along Albany Post Road, suffered. In 1850, the First National Bank built its first building at the site occupied by its successor at South Highland and Croton. alt=A brick building with narrow windows and vents seen from its right, its upper sections partially obscured by telephone wires. Closest to the camera is a tower with a pyramidal gray top and clocks on both visible faces showing 11:05 Little new construction took place during the 1860s, due to the war and its aftermath. The Second Empire Olive Opera House at 63-67 Central Avenue, built around 1865, remains the district's oldest non- residential property. Croton Avenue saw some development at that time, particularly the rowhouses at 4 and the commercial building at 12. On Main Street the buildings between 157 and 161 also date from this time, but those that remain have been altered enough to no longer be contributing. The building at 121 Main Street, built around 1865, retains enough integrity to contribute. After the war, the village built a monument at South Highland and Croton to the 42 men who had been killed in action with the Union Army. =1870‚Äì1910: Industrial prosperity= The postwar years, the period later referred to as the Gilded Age, were prosperous for Ossining. While shipbuilding and river shipping finally faded as an industry when the railroad, now part of the New York Central, was fully established, quarrying continued. The village had become an industrial center, with over a hundred businesses located downtown or on the waterfront, from Brandreth's pill factory to pickle and sleigh manufacturers. Near the end of that decade the church congregations decided to expand. The Presbyterians needed a larger building. They sold the old one to the new Trinity Episcopal Church, who had split from nearby St. Paul's over differences of opinion about the war. The lot at the Maple Place intersection was ideal for their new building designed by Isaac Perry, later New York's state architect. The stone-trimmed brick structure has design features common to Perry's other churches, all designed during this period. It was the first of four churches built in downtown Ossining in the late 19th century. The other buildings in the district were primarily built in the wake of four fires. The first, in 1871, primarily affected the corner of the Post Road and Broadway (then called Mill Street) to the north of the district. Its primary casualty was 217 Main Street, rebuilt in brick instead of frame later that year; the village's records, all stored in the basement, were lost. In 1872, the next fire destroyed all the buildings on lower Main Street. In its wake, the Barlow family, who had operated a hardware and furniture business in the original building since 1844, built the block named for them at 129‚Äì139 Main Street, retaining the original's bracketed cornice and adding pediments. The Barlows intended for it to be the central commercial location in Ossining. alt= A brick church, seen from a corner and looking uphill, with a tall white steeple. One of its front windows has been boarded up. In 1874, another fire started in the Olive Opera House at Brandreth and Central, seriously damaging it and the neighboring buildings. In the subsequent rebuilding, 145 Main Street was redone in the Renaissance Revival style, with bracketed cornices and pediments and stone trim. On the other side, 61 Central retained its cast iron storefront with columns on high plinth blocks, the only example of that design element in the district. Further up the street, 187 Main was built in 1874 as well, featuring splayed brick lintels in addition to its bracketed cornice. Across the street, the Baptists replaced the twice-renovated Greek Revival frame church where they had worshipped since 1815. Brooklyn architect J. Walsh's brick Gothic Revival design is one of the highest applications of that style in Ossining. alt=Two attached brick buildings three stories height with colorful, ornate detailing and storefronts at street level. The one on the left has \\"Sneakers K & S\\" on its storefront and \\"Palmer Hall\\" at the top. The one on the right has \\"Picante\\" at the storefront and \\"A.H. Stayver 1876\\" at the top. The last fire, in 1876, burned that block across Main from the Baptist Church, an area the previous fires and the aqueduct construction had left untouched. Again, the rebuilding provided a chance to apply newer architectural styles. The buildings at 191 and 193 Main became Palmer Hall and the Stayver Building, brick structures with Neo-Grec detailing in their metal trim. Italianate detail was added to 199 Main Street, which became the Keenan Building when it was finished in 1878. In the 1880s, the space left vacant next to the aqueduct along the north side of Main was refilled by 165 and 173‚Äì75 Main. Both have since been modified but retain their original metal cornices and segmental- arched lintels. Further east, another Renaissance Revival building, 127 Main Street, was completed in 1885. Its elaborate detail includes two-story brick pilasters supporting a metal roof cornice, and an intermediate cornice supported by cast iron pillars. That same year the Methodists, who had previously held services in a building on Spring Street, outside the district, finished their new church. That building, at the corner of Highland and Emwilton, was designed by Ebenezer Roberts, architect of several Manhattan churches, and Lawrence P. Valk. The Ossining Methodist church is distinct from Roberts' earlier, more Gothic, churches (all subsequently demolished). Polychrome bands of stone on the exterior, and more elaborate detailing, put it within the High Victorian Gothic style. It features an engaged corner tower and transitional Queen Anne and Shingle Style elements. Louis Comfort Tiffany signed one of the Favrile glass windows he designed for the interior. alt=Two pointed gray stone buildings seen from across a street, with cars passing in front and a traffic light visible from the center to the upper left. The one on the left has a tall square stone tower with a smaller tower topped by a cross at the top. The one on the left has a large round window in the middle and a cross at the point on the front. Both have open red doors. The last of the downtown churches was Trinity. After almost two decades in the Presbyterians' former building, the breakaway Episcopalian congregation needed its own new building. It commissioned Robert W. Gibson, whose design was the fifth in a series of English Gothic churches he began in 1884 with Albany's All Saints Cathedral. Trinity has elements in common with the other churches in the series, such as its mix of materials and large rose window, but is unique among them for its U shape, the result of a later expansion. It was completed in 1891, the only Neo-Gothic Revival religious building in the district. At the beginning of the next decade, another longstanding building from the early years of Ossining, the Union Hotel at South Highland and Church Street, was demolished. A Romanesque Revival doctor's office building replaced it. In 1892 the corner section of the Barlow Block was separated internally from the rest of the building so it could serve as Ossining's post office, the first of two former locations for that facility within the district. The next year the village's electric trolley system was established, with its main line going down Croton Avenue from the then-undeveloped Ossining Heights area in the northeast corner of the village to Main Street, where a spur ran down to Sparta, and then continuing to the train station. Residents could more easily travel downtown, and Ossining Heights soon became the suburban residential area it is today. The new century brought some major changes to the village, starting with its name. In 1901, it formally changed its name from Sing Sing to Ossining to distance itself from the prison. Residents had come to resent the prison industries' competitive advantages and the prison itself was now associated with the electric chair. Sparta, long bypassed by the region's major transportation arteries, was finally annexed by the village in 1906. In architecture, the Renaissance Revival style was used for another commercial building, 181‚Äì183 Main Street, around 1900. In 1905, the parish hall and cloister were added to Trinity, giving its distinctive U-shaped layout. The next year the corner section of the Barlow Block was remodeled by W.H. Rahman for use by a bank in a higher version of the style. It was refaced in stone, with Doric and Ionic pilasters, terra cotta detailing and full entablature leading up to a tile roof, meant to emulate St. Mark's Library in Venice. alt=A small square stone building with ornate decorative work, including the words \\"Bank for Savings\\". In front of it is a small clock tower with \\"Time to enjoy Historic Ossining\\" on it. At lower left is a sign welcoming visitors to the Ossining Central Business District. It anticipated the first significant building of the new century, the Bank for Savings Building at 200 Main Street, built the next year on the north corner of the triangular lot occupied by the First Baptist Church for nearly a century. The stone building by Lansing C. Holden, a past president of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, is the only example in the village of the Beaux-Arts style. Its classical detailing makes it a focal point for traffic entering Ossining from the north, even as the intersection has become of one of Westchester's busiest. =1910‚Äì1933: Public buildings= Other new construction continued in previously established styles. In 1911 and 1913 respectively, new brick commercial buildings went up at 189 and 205 Main in the Renaissance Revival style. Their application differed from those that had gone before. On 189 was a belt course and stone quoins; on the other building all the decoration, including the flat-arched lintels and corbeled cornice, was brick. In 1914, the bank buildings were complemented by the village's own new municipal building. The stone edifice at 16‚Äì20 Croton Avenue, the northern end of the district, was in the Classical Revival mode common for most governmental buildings of the era. The upper floors were initially used as a school. It is the only Westchester building by Donn Barber, designer of the Connecticut State Library and the first American admitted to the French Society of Beaux- Arts architects. alt=A three-story flat-roofed rectangular stone building with an American flag out front and Christmas decorations on the facade Later that year another new architectural style was introduced to the district. The Spanish Colonial Revival commercial building at 201‚Äì203 Main Street used a tiled pent-roofed parapet and stucco face. Down the street at 125 Main, a 1920 building is the district's only example of a yellow brick building with limestone trim, in the form of a stone cornice topped with a parapet. The early 1920s brought changes to Ossinging as the village's population reached 12,000, many moving into former farms newly subdivided into suburban residential neighborhoods on the village's outskirts. In 1920, a new warden at the prison shut down several prison industries, including the quarry. Two years later, the Olive Opera House closed after almost 60 years. It was soon converted into a small factory. Two years after that, in 1924, the trolley system was shut down and dismantled, as more residents owned cars and more of the roads were paved. Bus service replaced it. The last significant buildings in the future historic district came to South Highland at the end of the decade. On the corner just south of the First Baptist Church, the Cynthard Building, a single-story commercial block faced in terra cotta topped by a polychrome parapet, was erected in 1930; the Romanesque Revival doctor's office that had replaced the Union Hotel in 1890, and a house to the south, were demolished. Also that year, the third and last bank building downtown was built at 13 Croton Avenue, the corner with North Highland. The First National Bank, which had occupied the spot since 1880, moved into the district's only Art Deco building. It has an unusual neoclassical door surround. alt=A complex two-story brick building with a tower, cupola and multicolored roof. In front are a pine tree and some bare ones, along with a white-on-maroon sign reading \\"Ossining High School\\". Ossining High School was that year's most distinguished addition. Washington School, the village's high school since 1907, was becoming inadequate for the growing student population. After several attempts, voters in 1929 approved a new building when a nearby private school made a donation that helped cover the $750,000 ($ in ) construction cost. The new high school was on the site of Careswell, formerly the estate of Henry Baker, the local financier who had helped fund the Methodist church. James Gamble Rogers was the architect. Known for his many buildings on college campuses, the village's high school was one of his few secondary school buildings, and the only public school. The Collegiate Gothic building, taking up the large area of South Highland's west side between the houses and the Methodist church, has some similarities to Harkness Tower at Yale University, also designed by Rogers and considered one of the best examples of that style. =1934‚Äìpresent: Preservation, urban renewal and redevelopment= As the Great Depression set in and construction slowed, one more public building completed the district. The post office had outgrown its space at the Barlow Block again, and needed to move. As part of the national relief programs, many new post offices were built. Arthur Ware contributed a restrained Classical Revival one-story brick building at 10 South Highland, between the Cynthard Building and the Presbyterian Church, on the site of what had been the last remaining house on the west side of Main in the district. It was completed in 1933, the newest contributing property in the district. The district had been built out, but change continued. Woolworth's moved into the space at 201‚Äì203 Main in 1934. The government of the Town of Ossining, which surrounds the village on land, moved into Village Hall the next year. Postwar population growth led to the expansion of two buildings in the late 1950s. The first was the Presbyterian Church, which received a new Sunday School wing in 1955. Two years later the high school across the street, serving more students than it was originally designed for since 1937, followed. Its new wing, completed in 1957, was first used for the junior high school students. It was built of brick and intended to be architecturally sympathetic. Most significantly, later in the decade the aqueduct began to carry less water. New York City had both eliminated one of the two reservoirs in Central Park that it fed, and developed or planned to develop new reservoirs in the Catskills and further up the Croton River watershed, so it needed less water from the Croton aqueduct. In the early 1950s the city finally stopped using it; some of the communities along the aqueduct kept drawing water from it until 1965. Automobiles had displaced the railroad as the most common means of transport. Parkways and other dedicated roads had been built from the city in all directions. One proposal, made in the late 1920s, called for a Hudson River Expressway to run along the river's eastern shore, paralleling the railroad, from The Bronx to Beacon, including through downtown Ossining. Governor Nelson Rockefeller, whose ancestral estate Kykuit would have been along the route, introduced a shortened version in 1958, a Tarrytown-Beacon Interstate 487. After intense local opposition, he canceled the plan in 1971. The urban renewal funds meant to offset the disruption it would have caused were still available to affected communities.Russell-Humes, Lutonya; Like many other established downtowns, Ossining had been adversely affected by the growth of the automobile in the later 20th century. Local shoppers began taking advantage of improved roads to patronize stores in both enclosed shopping malls and strip malls along major highways like Route 9, outside the village's traditional center. The village used its urban renewal grants to demolish the old buildings along the south side of Main Street that year in an attempt to revitalize downtown. Its comprehensive plan drafted but never adopted two years earlier called for mixed-use development projects to replace them. But they were never funded or undertaken, and the spaces were largely used as parking. It was the first of many plans that remained largely unrealized, as Ossining went through 15 different mayoral administrations in the remaining years of the 20th century. During the 1968‚Äì74 period, downtown was also the site of several race riots that began at the high school and spilled into the streets. The community responded by redistricting its schools to ensure racial integration in lower grades. The 1971 plan had recognized the importance of the buildings on the north side of Main, and historic preservation soon played a larger role in downtown planning. In 1973, the First Baptist Church became Ossining's first listing on the National Register of Historic Places, and the aqueduct followed the next year. In 1975, the village followed up with a study of the prospects for rehabilitating and preserving downtown that, for the first time in its planning history, drew on community input. It recommended residential development downtown to sustain the businesses that remained, but no new projects were undertaken. A second plan two years later also failed, but made specific recommendations for preserving historic buildings and called for new development to be on the same scale, rather than the larger structures proposed at the beginning of the decade. alt=An asphalt path with buildings and trees on both sides. As the village continued to change governments, the social and economic trends affecting downtown continued. All three bank buildings were left vacant. The preeminence of automobiles and roads took a direct toll on the district when a widening of Route 9 cost 217 Main Street several of its bays. It was rebuilt with its overall appearance retained, but the project cost it enough of its historic character that it could no longer be considered contributing when the district, originally called the Main Street Crescent Historic District, was created in 1989. Many businesses that closed or moved out were replaced by new ones, particularly restaurants, that catered to a growing Latin immigrant (at the time, largely Ecuadorean) population that had settled in the neighborhoods nearby. In the 1990s, the village, under its first stable administration in several decades, began the planning process again, focusing on both downtown and the waterfront. Its second attempt at a farmers' market downtown had begun in 1990 and continues. Extensive public involvement led to the implementation of ideas from earlier plans, such as design guidelines for the district and a Historic Review Commission to enforce them. The new plan recognized the importance of the growing restaurant cluster downtown. In 1992, the aqueduct gained National Historic Landmark status, and the following year the 1840s Greek Revival buildings at 147‚Äì55 Main Street burned, creating a new void for redevelopment; the village initially used the space as a parking lot. alt=A row of three- story brick commercial buildings in different colors, seen from across a street at an oblique angle. Near the rear one has scaffolding covered by black mesh. Change came to two of the newer buildings on South Highland as the 20th century became the 21st. The post office moved out of its building for a newer facility on the south side of Main Street, in the space cleared three decades earlier by urban renewal opposite the western extent of the district. Its former building was converted to retail use. Just to its north, the Cynthard Building was damaged by a fire in 2003, and was closed for three years while it was repaired and restored. In 2004, the village took possession of the Bank for Savings building, vacant since 1983. Two years later, a developer acquired the Ossining National Bank Building and began restoring it for use as affordable condominiums. Ossining's first full-time planner was hired in 2005. After extensive community input, a new draft comprehensive plan was completed in 2007, and adopted in 2009. It recommended the creation of a new zoning district, Village Center, for Main Street, which was quickly adopted. In 2011 the village implemented another recommendation, putting out formal requests for redevelopment proposals for both the Bank for Savings building and the 147‚Äì155 Main properties. In 2015, Hudson Crossing at Market Square, a complex with residential, restaurant and retail space, was opened in the latter buildings. Significant contributing properties alt=An ornate grayish-brown house with peaked and pointed towers with a bare tree at the left and a white car in a driveway on the right in front of it. Among the district's 23 buildings and structures are many that are architecturally distinctive or unique, or important to the village's history. Two of them have been listed individually on the Register; Note: The PDF-reading software numbers this as page 343. one of those, the Old Croton Aqueduct, is a National Historic Landmark. =National Register of Historic Places= *First Baptist Church of Ossining, 1 Church Street. Brooklyn architect J. Walsh designed this High Victorian Gothic structure, built on the site where the church had stood since 1815. The 1874 church features many triangles and quatrefoils in its decoration, representing the Trinity and four Gospels respectively. It is home to Ossining's oldest congregation, established in the 1780s by founding settler Elijah Hunter. Almost a century later, in 1973, it became Ossining's first property listed on the National Register. *Highland Cottage, 36 S. Highland Ave. This 1872 Gothic structure was the first concrete house in the county. Later it was used as a business school. *Old Croton Aqueduct, space between 165 and 173 Main Street. The masonry tunnel below ground is topped with a walkway (not considered a contributing structure itself since it is too new), paved with brick within the downtown area, that leads north to Croton Dam. An engineering accomplishment when it was built in the late 1830s, it was New York City's first clean municipal water supply and the first in its extensive network of reservoirs and aqueducts upstate. Other city aqueducts have since replaced it, but its northern end has been reopened to supply Ossining and other communities at its north end. It was listed on the Register in 1974 and upgraded to National Historic Landmark status in 1992. alt=A row of brick buildings with continuous decorative white trim at the roof seen from an oblique angle across the street.

Lansing Holden's design is the only example of the Beaux Arts style in the village. *Barlow Block, 129‚Äì139 Main Street, including Ossining National Bank Building. The Barlow Block is named for the local family who rebuilt the property where their hardware and furniture store had been located after most of the original structure burned down in an 1872 fire. The replacement buildings are ornate Italianate structures with pediments and bracketed cornices. The building at the north end, later modified to be the village's post office, was remodeled into the Renaissance Revival bank building in 1906. After a long period of vacancy in the late 20th century, it has been restored and repurposed as affordable housing. *Building at 61 Central Avenue. Built in 1875, this two-story, five-bay brick commercial building with a cast iron storefront is the only one in the district to have columns supported by high plinth blocks. *Building at 125 Main Street. The only building in the district to use yellow brick and limestone trim was constructed in 1920. *Building at 127 Main Street. This more elaborate Renaissance Revival building, with brick pilasters and a metal cornice with an intermediate cornice, dates to 1885. *Building at 141‚Äì145 Main Street. Another structure rebuilt following one of the fires of the early 1870s, it was the first in the district to use the Renaissance Revival style. *Building at 189 Main Street. The only Renaissance Revival building in the district with belt courses and stone quoins dates to 1911. *Building at 201‚Äì203 Main Street. The tiled shed roof and parapet on this 1914 building are traits of the Spanish Colonial Revival style. It is the only example in the district. *Building at 205 Main Street. All the decoration on this 1913 Renaissance Revival building is brick, unique in the district. *Cynthard Building, 26 South Highland Avenue. This one-story terra cotta-faced building with neoclassical detailing was built in 1929 on the site once occupied by the Union Hotel, an early overnight stop on the Albany Post Road. Renovated after a 2003 fire. *First National Bank, 13 Croton Avenue. Located at the intersection with North Highland Avenue, it is the only Art Deco building in the district, dating to 1930, and the only one of its three bank buildings still used for that purpose. *First Presbyterian Church, 34 South Highland Avenue. Isaac G. Perry designed this High Victorian Gothic brick church, brick with white wood trim like the nearby First Baptist Church, in 1870 when the Presbyterians turned their old church over to the breakaway Trinity Episcopalian congregation who had shared it. A Sunday School wing was added in 1955. *House at 23 South Highland Avenue. This 1840s Italian-villa style wood frame house is the oldest building in the district, and one of only two residences. *Keenan Building, 199 Main Street. After the original building on the site was damaged by one of the 1870s fires, this replaced it in high Renaissance Revival style. *Old U.S. Post Office, 30 South Highland Avenue. Arthur Ware designed this detailed Classical Revival building in 1933, part of a massive New Deal rebuilding program. It continued to serve as the post office until the new facility on the south side of Main was built at the end of the century, and is now a retail space. It is the most recent of all the district's contributing properties, and one of only three post offices in New York that contribute to historic districts despite being found ineligible to be listed on the Register individually. *Olive Opera House, 63‚Äì67 Central Avenue. Built in 1865, this three-story brick building with a hipped roof served its original purpose as a performing arts and meeting space until the early 1920s. Since then it has been a factory and, more recently, a commercial building. *Ossining High School, 29 South Highland Avenue. James Gamble Rogers contributed the original Collegiate Gothic building in 1930. Originally it served all the secondary- level students in the community. The community and district have grown enough that even after a 1958 expansion it now serves only the high school students from the village and town of Ossining, including those portions of nearby Briarcliff Manor within the town, and some portions of neighboring towns within the school district. *Ossining Municipal Building, 16 Croton Avenue. A stone Classical Revival structure built in 1914 by Donn Barber, it has housed the village government and, since 1934, town government as well. *Ossining United Methodist Church, South Highland Avenue and Emwilton Place. One of the few surviving churches by Ebenezer Roberts, who collaborated on this 1885 structure with Laurence Valk. Its polychrome stonework and detail put it more firmly in the High Victorian Gothic style than his other churches are known to have been. Louis Comfort Tiffany signed one of his Favrile glass windows inside. *Palmer Hall and Stayver Building, 191‚Äì93 Main Street. Two Renaissance Revival buildings that replaced structures lost to the 1876 fire, they are distinguished by Neo-Grec detail work. *Trinity Episcopal Church, 7 South Highland Avenue. The fifth of architect Robert W. Gibson's series of English Gothic churches in New York, Trinity was built in 1891 on the site of the former Presbyterian church. It was the last of the district's four churches to be built. The parish house wing, added in 1905, gives it a U-shaped layout unique among Gibson's work. Zoning and regulation The village's zoning code has since the adoption of the 2009 comprehensive plan assigned a unique district, called Village Center, to downtown. It is intended to preserve downtown \\"as the center of village life\\" by promoting business uses of greater intensity than elsewhere in the village and encouraging mixed-use development, with upper levels of buildings available for residential use. To that latter end, it requires that residents of a building have an entrance available that is separate from any used for commercial purposes, that no residential use is permitted on the ground floor and that units be at least for studio apartments, for one-bedrooms, for two-bedrooms with required for any additional bedroom. Along with Sparta and the waterfront, the district is covered by a historic overlay district defined elsewhere in the zoning code. They are overseen by the Historic Preservation Commission (HPC), a body of seven residents appointed by the village manager. At least one member has to have practical experience in architecture, urban planning, land development or real estate, or live in a historic district or designated local landmark, or have a practical interest in local history or preservation (a single member with all those qualifications can satisfy the statutory requirement). They serve for five-year staggered terms. The HPC considers applications for landmark status, and develops overall preservation strategies for the village, but does not consider applications for redeveloping individual properties. The village's zoning requires that all new construction, save additions to or expansions of detached single-family homes and residential duplexes, receive site plan approval from the village's Planning Board. This applies to almost all properties in the district. The seven members of the board are, like the HPC members, appointed to five-year terms by the village manager; two must have relevant expertise. The Planning Board also serves as the Board of Architectural Review (BAR), which has the power to reject proposed buildings for \\"[i]nappropriateness in relation to the established character of other structures in the immediate area or neighboring areas with respect to significant design features, such as material or quality of architectural design ...\\" An unsuccessful applicant, or one requiring a variance, can go before the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA). Its five members are, as with the Planning Board and HPC, appointed by the village manager for five-year terms; there are no qualifications on membership. Proposals in comprehensive plan The village's 2009 comprehensive plan identifies three objectives for downtown: to promote it as a business location, create a major downtown draw for visitors and residents, and improve and enhance its amenities. It recommends specific actions to accomplish all three. To the first end, it recommends making the village's government more user-friendly for existing and prospective businesses, addressing the 18 percent vacancy rate reported in 2007. The Village Board and Planning Board should both be able to provide more information and reach out to local and regional business organizations. The zoning process, the plan contends, could be improved, since many existing businesses downtown are on conditional uses, and site plan approvals should have a time limit, forcing owners to begin development. Creation of a business improvement district and appointment of a Main Street Manager would make the development of downtown businesses more effective and efficient. During the process of drafting the plan, many residents expressed a desire for a national chain retailer or restaurant to be enticed to locate near or in downtown as a draw. The plan considers this ill-advised and unlikely to happen for several reasons. Chains do not like to pioneer a new area, instead preferring to cluster with each other, and this leads to the development of large strip malls, impractical and undesirable in downtown Ossining, which still shows the scars of previous demolitions for urban renewal. Ossining as a whole is also geographically undesirable for chains, since not only is it neither affluent enough or accessible enough from major highways, the Hudson River cuts the potential trade area for such stores in half. alt=An ornate storefront with a semicircular green entablature over the entrance that says \\"Picante\\" in large letters and \\"Quimbaya's Coffee House\\" in smaller letters below it, surrounded by the names of some foods and drinks Instead, it recommends building on the existing clusters of restaurants and home-furnishings stores. Two businesses in each, Doca's Portuguese restaurant and Melita's respectively, draw customers from all over the county. Other regional chainlets could be drawn to Ossining. Restaurants in particular could see more ethnic diversity, widening the existing focus on Latin fare. The plan also recommends both improving cultural offerings downtown, and promoting more residential and office use to increase foot traffic at more times of the day. Residents also complained that the parking lots opposite the Crescent were unsightly, and that they found it difficult to find parking downtown. The plan recommends creating a village green on part of the lot at the southwest corner of Main and Spring streets, outside the district, as a focal point of downtown. It could retain parking along the sides or even in a garage underneath, a common practice in Europe. Further parking could be added in an aboveground garage on Brandreth Street, outside of downtown. The village should also act to create a consistent downtown environment by encouraging infill development, making signage and lighting consistent, and strengthening and consistently enforcing its historic preservation guidelines. The plan also recommended improving connections between downtown and the waterfront, where the Metro-North commuter rail station or the Haverstraw‚ÄìOssining Ferry could bring visitors into the village without adding to the parking problem. \\"A synergy between waterfront uses and downtown will enhance both areas, and provide reasons for visitors to stay in Ossining longer\\", it says. The plan further suggests studying the possibility of establishing a jitney or shuttle bus service that would not only allow visitors to bypass the steep climb up Main Street from the waterfront to downtown but continue westward to the residential areas of the village and town. Other measures to enhance the connection include signage, improved walkways and lighting, and dedicated space for river views. In 2019, the village began the process of updating the plan. In July, a steering committee, with mayor Victoria Gearity, village trustee Quantel Bazemore, planning board member Jeff Gasbarro and six citizens, was appointed. Several months later the village put out a request for proposal to identify a planning firm as its consultant, and seeking residents willing to serve on the committee. =Expansion of district and regulatory agencies' powers= The plan recommended that the village expand the historic district, at least as defined within its zoning code. A draft map at its website shows the southern boundary expanding one lot down the west side of South Highland, across Maple Street, to include Highland Cottage, an 1872 reinforced concrete house already listed on the Register. At the northern end, the property at 22‚Äì24 Croton Avenue next to the municipal building would be included, and the west end would extend to 55 and 57 Central Avenue and 107‚Äì113 Main Street. That boundary increase was approved by the National Park Service at the beginning of 2013. In addition, the plan recommended that the boundaries of the historic district be signed and maps posted. The powers of the village's regulatory bodies over it should be improved as well. It calls for the HPC's decisions to be made binding, and the draft design guidelines it and the BAR use should be improved and made a formal reference document, in order to ensure that infill development is consistent with the existing buildings in the district.

Kate Sugden Denis Rigg Denis Rigg, played by Richard Franklin, appeared between 1988 and 1989. He cheated Alan Turner into selling his share of Home Farm to him at a low price. Alan's business partner, Joe Sugden was angry at this and promptly sold his share too. Denis then went on to terrorise the villagers by threatening to evict them all from their homes if they refused to comply with his demands as he owned most of the houses and farms in the area. Denis looked to Emmerdale Farm to expand his business and this led to a confrontation between him and Joe. In the barn, a bull got aggravated by Denis's threatening and aggressive behaviour and crushed him against a wall, killing him. Rachel Hughes Mark Hughes Mark Hughes, played by Craig McKay, from 1988-1993 arrived in the village as a 15-year-old in 1988 with his mother Kate (Sally Knyvette) and sister Rachel (Glenda McKay). Mark had been a model son until the breakdown of his parents marriage. He then became a troublesome teenager which coincided with his mother's relationship and subsequent marriage to Joe Sugden. In January 1989, Mark ran away from home after Kate announced her intention to move in with Joe. Mark intended to go to Germany to be with his father but only made it as far as Hull. His father David alerted Kate who brought Mark home. Despite this Mark tried to get his parents back together on numerous occasions and he reacted badly to being clipped around the ear by Joe for messing around with a gun. In January 1990, Mark and some friends tried trapping some mink using dangerous and illegal snares but only managed to succeed in trapping a puppy called Lucy. Mark also got into trouble when he went to the pub with his sister and her older friends. He wanted to prove his manhood by drinking alcohol but was cautioned for underage drinking. Mark then began shoplifting. He stole things he didn't need but was caught by Rachel and Sarah Connolly (Madeleine Howard). He was arrested and given a warning at the police station but afterwards his mother collapsed and suffered a miscarriage. Mark blamed himself for this. After leaving school Mark initially intended to join the army and follow in his father's footsteps. However he then decided to stay at school and study A-Levels in Art, Technical Drawing and English. But he refused to turn up to his final exams and as a result his girlfriend Melanie Clifford split up with him and he lost his place at Glasgow University. Mark also got himself into debt by letting his friends use telephone chatlines and he had to get a job at the Woolpack to pay them off. Annie Sugden later paid the bill for him. In 1992, Mark started work as a handyman at the holiday village where he had a holiday romance with an older woman called Lisa. He also worked as an assistant gamekeeper to Seth Armstrong (Stan Richards). Mark did have a sense of fun and he organised the village's sheep race in 1992 and in 1993 he organised the fell race which was a challenge between the village's teenagers and his sister Rachel's student friends from Leeds. But it ended in disaster when Lorraine Nelson was bribed to move the signs and mountain rescue teams had to be called out to search for the lost runners. Mark died in the 1993 plane crash that devastated the village. Joe had wanted him to return a vacuum cleaner that evening which had been borrowed from Lynn Whiteley and this resulted in Mark being in the wrong place at the wrong time when a large section of the Eastern European airliner came down on Whiteley's farm. Mark was crushed by a falling wall and Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby) identified his body after recognising his watch amongst recovered items.

The museum, built on top of a large ruined Roman villa from Late Antiquity, exhibits mosaics from the Roman and early Byzantine city of Marcianopolis, as well as other archaeological artifacts. Villa and museum The museum was founded as a result of archaeological research beginning in 1976, which uncovered the House of Antiope, a Late Roman villa decorated with floor mosaics. The villa was constructed in the late 3rd or early 4th century AD, perhaps during the rule of Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306‚Äì337). Constructed on the site of earlier buildings destroyed during the Gothic raids in 250‚Äì251, it was abandoned in the 7th century due to Avar and Slavic invasions. The villa is nearly square in shape, measuring . It features 21 rooms situated around an inner courtyard (atrium) with a well; the rooms have a total area of . The museum lies in a small park, with a well-preserved Roman street crossing under the building. Around the museum are several ancient walls, which, along with the villa, constitute most of the preserved ruins of Marcianopolis. The museum building only covers the western part of the villa; its eastern wing and the atrium are not covered. Many of the villa's walls were decorated with frescoes and stucco, while the floors of the portico and five premises were covered by elaborate mosaics. In addition to mosaics, the museum displays items pertaining to the Roman villa itself and to the life of its inhabitants. The modern museum building was built to the design of architect Kamen Goranov. Museum curator Anastas Angelov has criticised the construction, claiming that 90% of the building's weight is carried by the Roman ruins. As of 2008, visible cracks were threatening the building, which was also sinking due to groundwater. In 2005, the museum was visited by a record 10,000 people; in 2006, the annual visitors were around 8,000. The Museum of Mosaics in Devnya is listed as #10 among the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria. Mosaics Atrium basin of House of Antiope, Marcianopolis Mosaic of the alt=An ancient mosaic depicting the gorgon Medusa in the centre of a round geometric shield inscribed into a square also decorated with geometric motifs Three of the mosaics are exhibited in situ and the remaining have been moved from their original locations in order to be conserved and restored. As a whole, the mosaics were laid out using the opus tessellatum (tiles aligned in horizontal or vertical lines) and opus vermiculatum (tiles aligned so as to draw an outline around the shapes) techniques. The tiles were made of marble, clay, limestone and coloured glass and include 16 colour varieties. Despite the rise of Christianity during the reign of Constantine, the mosaics in the House of Antiope are exclusively pagan in character. They feature depictions of characters from Greek and Roman mythology such as Zeus, Antiope, Ganymede and the gorgon Medusa, as well as floral and geometric motifs and images of exotic animals. The best-known of the mosaics in the museum is the depiction of the gorgon Medusa, which covers the floor of the tablinum, or office of the house's owner, which is in size. The image of Medusa is surrounded by a round geometric shield, the shield of Athena. Despite the gorgon's reputation as a horrible monster and the presence of snakes instead of hair, the image in the Museum of Mosaics is rather tame and not particularly frightening. Instead, the role of the mosaic was that of a talisman to protect the home from the forces of evil. Medusa is depicted with her face turned slightly to the right, though with her eyes staring left. Tiles of various shades have been employed in order to lend volume to the image. The mosaic of Zeus and Antiope lies on the floor of the cubiculum, or bedchamber of the villa, which measures . Angelov claims that the image in the House of Antiope is among the few contemporaneous depictions of that episode. As in mythology, Zeus is portrayed as a young satyr who kidnaps Antiope, attracted by her beauty. The mosaic is accompanied by two inscriptions in Ancient Greek, which explicitly label the characters as Œ£ŒëŒ§Œ•Œ°ŒüŒ£ (\\"satyr\\") and ŒëŒùŒ§ŒôŒüŒ†Œó (\\"Antiope\\"). Other mosaics in the villa include the story of Ganymede, who is transported to Mount Olympus by Zeus transformed into an eagle, which covers the oecus, the largest premise; the badly damaged Seasons mosaic in the women's apartments, which features images of animals, geometric motifs and personifications of the four seasons, of which Autumn has been preserved; and the geometric Pannonian Volutes mosaic, moved to the museum from another ruined ancient building of Marcianopolis.

Service life Ordered by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR), Duke of Clarence was built at Laird Brothers, Birkenhead, as the first of seven ships that they delivered between 1892 and 1909. It was originally intended to name her Birkenhead, but it was thought that passengers might be put off by thoughts of the sinking of . She was allocated the United Kingdom Official Number 89707 and the code letters MNSP. She was completed for the joint ownership of LYR and the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). She was acquired outright by the LYR in 1906 for service on the North Sea. She passed to the LNWR in 1922 and, following the grouping of Britain's railways under the Railways Act 1921, to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in the following year. Duke of Clarence was used on routes from Fleetwood to Belfast and Derry until 1906. Following this she served on the Hull to Zeebrugge route during the summer and west coast routes during the winter, including the Liverpool to Drogheda route. The Zeebrugge service was suspended during World War I and the Admiralty requisitioned her for use as an armed boarding steamer, stationed in the Channel approaches and later on the Northern Patrol. She returned to the Zeebrugge service in February 1920. Withdrawn and laid up at Fleetwood in September 1929, she was sold in May 1930 for scrapping to Thos W Ward and broken up at Barrow in Furness. then replaced Duke of Clarence. Incidents In the early hours of Tuesday 6 November 1894, whilst making passage from Belfast to Fleetwood, Duke of Clarence ran down and sank the steam trawler Albatross, whilst Albatross was engaged trawling on the Bahama Bank to the northeast of Ramsey, Isle of Man. The accident resulted in the loss of the lives of five members of the crew of Albatross.Mona's Herald. Wednesday, 7 November 1894 Manx Sun. Saturday, 10 November 1894 Albatross, under the command of Captain Edward Shimmin, was owned by Robert Knox of Douglas. Albatross was operating in coordination with Lady Loch, commanded by Captain William Shimmin, (Edward Shimmin's brother), with the two vessels separated by approximately half a mile, forming part of a fleet of 30 other trawlers fishing in the area of the Bahama Lightship. Albatross was reported to have been lit as per the regulations with two lights on her masthead indicating a steam trawler with her nets down - a red, green and white light combined and a white globe light. At approximately 01:10 hrs Duke of Clarence passed Lady Loch and shortly after collided with Albatross, ramming the Albatross amidships, resulting in Albatross sinking in a matter of minutes. Lady Loch hastened to the scene and upon arrival found Duke of Clarence stationary with two of her lifeboats engaged searching for survivors. Captain Edward Shimmin had managed to save himself by climbing aboard Duke of Clarence, two further sailors, Robert Kelly (second engineer) and deck hand Thomas Turner, had managed to take hold of two empty fish boxes and were subsequently picked up by the lifeboats. However five crew members who were below at the time of collision drowned. Two further vessels joined the search, Manx Queen, which was en route from Barrow-in-Furness to Belfast, was subsequently joined by Duke of Clarences sister, Duke of York, which was making passage from Fleetwood to Belfast. The search lasted for three hours, following which all vessels went on their respective ways. Captain Shimmin, Kelly, and Turner were landed at Fleetwood and subsequently made their way back to the Isle of Man via Liverpool. As a consequence of the collision Duke of Clarence sustained slight damage to both sides of her bows but was still able to resume her schedule the following night. Those drowned were listed as: Henry Hudson (49), Richard Gregg (52), William Daugherty (50), John Leadbeater (24) and Charles Shimmin (Captain Edward Shimmin's son) (18). A claim for damages in lieu of the loss of Albatross was heard at the Admiralty Court in February 1895, the case being heard by Mr Justice Bruce and two Elder Brethren of Trinity House.Manx Sun. Saturday 2 February 1895The Mona's Herald. Wednesday 6 February 1895 The findings were that the Master of Duke of Clarence was to blame, citing the inadequate posting of lookouts and a disregard for the numerous fishing vessels in the area of the fishing grounds. The damages was ascertained by the Registrar of Merchants with Knox receiving an undisclosed sum. Albatross was valued at ¬£2,000 but was insured for the sum of ¬£12,000.The Manx Sun, Saturday 14 June 1895. The following sums were awarded to the families of those crew members lost: The widows of William Daugherty, Henry Hudson, and Richard Gregg (the three married crew members) received ¬£300 each. The families of Hudson and Gregg also received ¬£150 each. The (seven) children of Daugherty received ¬£250. The father of John Leadbeater received ¬£250. With the payment received for the loss of the Albatross, Robert Knox purchased a replacement, Rose Ann.

The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, and contains seven historically and architecturally significant properties dating from the late 18th century to the early 20th century. Most of the properties are domestic, or used for education or religion. The most common architectural styles within the district are Mid-19th Century Revival and Late Victorian. Profile 1914 map of all district properties or their present locations except Sparta Cemetery The district contains 26 contributing buildings, two contributing sites, and one contributing structure. They are associated with three estates: Beechwood, Rosemont, and Woodlea (now Sleepy Hollow Country Club); The Clear View School, a school complex; two religious properties: Saint Mary's Episcopal Church and Scarborough Presbyterian Church; and Sparta Cemetery, which dates back to before the Revolutionary War. All properties stand in much the same condition as when first nominated, except Rosemont, which was demolished in the mid- to late-1980s. Several properties within the district exemplify Mid-19th Century Revival architectures, including Greek, Gothic, Renaissance, and Neoclassical styles; their formal landscaping exemplifies estate landscaping at the turn of the 19th century. Most of the properties were established by wealthy landowners, ranging from the late 18th century to the early 20th century. The district, which remains generally rural and sparsely developed, borders the Hudson River and lies within the towns of Ossining and Mount Pleasant, between the villages of Ossining and Sleepy Hollow. Most of the district's buildings are set on large parcels of land, and many are clearly visible from U.S. Route 9 (the former Albany Post Road), the district's major thoroughfare. Stone and brick walls line Route 9 within the boundaries of the district. The district achieved State Register status on August 6, 1984, National Register district status on September 7, 1984, and local landmark status on January 5, 1988. Beechwood Beechwood Beechwood is an estate built in 1780; it was most notably the home of National City Bank president Frank A. Vanderlip and his family. The mansion has gone through a number of expansions and renovations; the most recent involved dividing the mansion into three segments for use as condominiums. Beechwood was a filming location of the 1970 film House of Dark Shadows, and a filming location and the primary setting of Savages, a 1972 Merchant Ivory film. In the 1890s, Henry Walter Webb substantially added to the estate from numerous properties, including an earlier estate named Beechwood. Webb also renovated and expanded the mansion, hiring R. H. Robertson to double the size of the house. Robertson designed the expansion in the Colonial Revival style, to be compatible with the neoclassical Federal style of the original but more ornate. The Clear View School Vanderlip Hall of The Clear View School The Clear View School was built in 1917 by Frank Vanderlip on his Beechwood property as the Scarborough School, the first Montessori school in the United States. In 1978, the school closed; The Clear View School purchased the property in 1980 and opened in 1981. It runs a day treatment program for 83 students with mental disorders. Rosemont Rosemont Rosemont, also known by the names Scarborough House and Hillside, was a Greek Revival mansion built around 1840. The house was near the birthplace of Rear Admiral John Lorimer Worden (1818-1897). It became headquarters to Stein and Day in 1973, and was known at that time as Scarborough House. The house was demolished in February 1990. The area was developed in the late 1990s with five up-scale homes on a cul-de-sac called Admiral Wordens Lane The mansion was used by Frank Vanderlip as a dormitory for Scarborough School boarding students. Rosemont stood opposite Vanderlip's Beechwood, at the corner of Route 9 and Scarborough Road. Saint Mary's Episcopal Church Saint Mary's Episcopal Church Saint Mary's Episcopal Church, founded in 1839 by William Creighton and incorporated in 1883 as Saint Mary's Church, Beechwood, is Briarcliff Manor's oldest church; it was reincorporated in 1945 as Saint Mary's Church of Scarborough. Its first service was in 1839 in a small schoolhouse on an acre of Creighton's Beechwood property, at the corner of Albany Post and Sleepy Hollow Roads. The service was led by Creighton's son-in-law Reverend Edward Nathaniel Meade. The granite church was built in 1850 by local stonemasons and paid for primarily by Creighton and Meade, but also by Creighton's wealthy neighbors, including US Navy Commodore Matthew C. Perry, James Watson Webb, William Aspinwall, and Ambrose Kingsland. The first services there were held on September 21, 1851. The church is in near-original condition, with a design based on the 14th- century Gothic St. Mary's parish church in Scarborough, England and is the only church with a complete set of John Bolton (brother of William Jay Bolton) stained-glass windows. The church's rectory was built in 1931 as a memorial to its first two rectors Creighton and Meade. Notable parishioners included Commodore Matthew Perry, Viola Allen, and Washington Irving. Irving, the author of \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" and \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\", brought and planted the ivy surrounding the church. He had received it from Walter Scott, from Abbotsford. The ivy of the parish house was brought from the Argonne battlefield, after World War I, by Narcissa Vanderlip. The Sleepy Hollow Country Club surrounds the church grounds on three sides. During World War I, the New York Guard's First Provisional Regiment was stationed at the former Holbrook Military Academy, guarding the Croton Aqueduct. The regiment held a service at Saint Mary's in 1918, as described in a contemporary regimental history: On July 5, 2015, Saint Mary's Episcopal Church closed after 175 years in operation. William Rockefeller, who lived nearby at Rockwood Hall, was a regular attendee of the church in the last few years of his life. Scarborough Presbyterian Church Scarborough Presbyterian Church Scarborough Presbyterian Church is the third-oldest in Briarcliff Manor., and has a property. The church has its origins with Elliott Fitch Shepard and his wife Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt Shepard purchasing a roadhouse on the Albany Post Road. In 1892, after enlarging and remodeling the store, adding diamond- paned windows and replacing the floors and porches, the building was first used as a church. The church's organization meeting was held with nineteen charter members. After Elliott Fitch Shepard's death in March 1893, Margaret donated the present church building and manse. The Spanish Renaissance-style church was designed by Augustus Haydel (a nephew of Stanford White) and August D. Shepard (a nephew of Elliott Shepard and of William Rutherford Mead). The two nephews later designed the 1899 Fabbri Mansion in Manhattan. The church's cornerstone was laid on October 13, 1893. During construction of the building's foundation, workers found quicksand, though Shepard was intent on constructing the church there and had the construction workers dig 30 feet into the ground to find firm ground for the foundation. European workers were brought to the site to aide in the building's construction. The Italian Renaissance Revival building was of limestone delivered from Indiana by railroad, requiring a special track laid at Scarborough to accommodate the delivery. The completed church was dedicated on May 11, 1895 in memory of Elliott Fitch Shepard. It was briefly known as Shepard Memorial Church. The dedication was attended by Cornelius Vanderbilt II, Frederick W. Vanderbilt, Chauncey Depew, William Sloane of W. & J. Sloane, William Seward Webb, H. Walter Webb, and James A. Burden II. It was built of pink granite rubble with limestone trim, with a steeple supported by flying buttresses. The interior has mosaic tile floors, fluted pilasters with gilded capitals, a coffered ceiling made of redwood, and stained-glass windows. The church's 1,498-pipe organ was constructed around 1894; it was the first all-electric action organ in the world. The church property also contains the church's carriage house, used for offices, and the parish house, designed by Augustus D. Shepard and completed in 1908. From 1929 to 1974, the Scarborough Engine Company of the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department had its first firehouse in the church's garage building or barn, which is older than the church building itself. Since around 1995, the church has run the Scarborough Presbyterian Children's Center, a non-denominational preschool housed in a building next door to the church, with an outdoor playground nearby. The preschool serves families in Briarcliff Manor and Scarborough, Ossining, Tarrytown, Sleepy Hollow, Pocantico Hills, and Pleasantville. In 1995, some of the church was renovated; in 2002, the building was more fully renovated due to years of floodwater and runoff damage, including floods from Hurricane Floyd. Sleepy Hollow Country Club Woodlea, clubhouse of Sleepy Hollow Country Club Sleepy Hollow Country Club was founded in 1911. The main building of Sleepy Hollow Country Club was known as Woodlea, the 140-room $2 million ($ in ) mansion built in 1895 for Elliott Fitch Shepard and his family. The building, with Beaux-Arts and Georgian Revival features, was designed by McKim, Mead & White and built from 1892 to 1895. In 1910, Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt Shepard sold the estate to Frank A. Vanderlip and William Rockefeller, who converted it into a country club. Current members include Bill Murray, James Patterson, and several members of the Rockefeller family. Sparta Cemetery Sparta Cemetery, or the Presbyterian Burying Ground at Sparta, is a burying ground dating to 1764, making it the oldest cemetery in Westchester County. It is the only contributing property outside Briarcliff Manor; the Ossining Historical Society has maintained the cemetery since 1984. , the cemetery is still owned by the First Presbyterian Church of Ossining; its original church building was built c. 1768 and was moved towards the center of Ossining in 1800.

It was an illustrated bi-weekly whose lithographs are among the best that have been printed in the archipelago, thanks to the contributions of artists like Baltasar Giraudier, who was well known for his writings and lithographic work for other publications such as the Diario de Manila, and C.W. Andrews, an English painter based in Hong-Kong who produced illustrations for Ilustraci√≥n Filipina on a regular basis. History Ilustraci√≥n Filipina was one of the earliest illustrated publications in the Philippines, being published twice a month. Although its lithographs are among the earliest ever executed in the Philippines, their quality is remarkable. The quarterly was issued by subscription and produced in limited editions. During the 20 months during which it was published a total of forty-four numbers were ultimately issued. Ilustraci√≥n Filipina is not to be confused with La Ilustraci√≥n Filipina, founded by Spanish-Filipino Jose Zaragoza y Aranquizna and published during the last decade of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. Contents \\"Hillside in the Philippines\\", by C.W. Andrews The text of the publication mostly related to the arts, history, geography, ethnography, and other sciences, while the illustrations offered reproductions of landscapes, seascapes, village life, costumes, portraits, and many other aspects of the Philippines and the Filipino people. Ilustraci√≥n Filipina didn't delve much on political issues and focused instead on cultural and scientific subjects that were combined with its high-quality illustrations, that included many portraits and stunning views of emblematic places in the Philippines, such as the volcano at Albay or the Botocan waterfalls. Wenceslao Retana, in his \\"Aparato Bibliogr√°fico de la Historia General de Filipinas\\", defined the publication as rather \\"unusual\\" in 1877 and praised its high quality. Each issue included one tinted lithograph whose images were in many cases drawn by Andrews, who on occasions would use original sketches by Charles Wirgman to create engravings that were later lithographed by Giraudier. Notable contributors Simon Flores y de la Rosa, one of the most celebrated Filipino painters in the last quarter of the 19th century and uncle of Fabi√°n de la Rosa, contributed several of his graphic works to Ilustraci√≥n Filipina. Manuel Ravago, a linguistic academician, theater director and actor, was a regular contributor of the publication.

Underwood businessman Geoff Thow ran a self-service store and was concerned about local children who congregated outside his shop with little to do. He decided to place an advertisement in the local newspaper to seek support for the formation of a Junior Football Club. The response was sufficient to enable the creation of the club and Thow became its first president. The club initially fielded three underage sides and eventually attracted more juniors and was thus able to field more teams in all the underage competitions.Springwood Pumas at AFI website By 1979 the club had progressed and fielded a senior team. The club played in the SQAFA 3rd Division. On 13 October 1979 the clubhouse was officially opened. In 1981 with the addition of a reserve grade side the club was promoted into Division Two. A reshuffling of clubs in 1986 saw the Springwood Pumas in Division One. After two seasons the club was back in Division Two but not for long, promoted again in 1991. After the 2000 season an AFLQ reorganization saw Springwood placed in Division Two for 2001.

The Royal Administration of the Saarbr√ºcken Railway (K√∂nigliche Direction der Saarbr√ºcker Eisenbahn) was established on 22 May 1852 with the goal of managing and operating the soon to be opened state railway line from the (then) border with Bavaria near Bexbach via Neunkirchen and St. Johann- Saarbr√ºcken to the French border at Forbach. It replaced the Royal Commission for the construction of the Saarbr√ºcken Railway (K√∂niglichen Kommission f√ºr den Bau der Saarbr√ºcker Eisenbahn), which had been created at the end of 1847 by the Prussian government with responsibility for the planning and construction of this line. On 1 July 1859, it was renamed as the Royal Railway Administration at Saarbr√ºcken (K√∂nigliche Eisenbahn-Direction zu Saarbr√ºcken). At the same time it took over the management of the private Rhine-Nahe Railway Company (Rhein-Nahe Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). In the following years the rail network of the Saarbr√ºcken Railway grew to a total length of 365 km when it became part of the Railway Administration in Frankfurt am Main (Eisenbahn- Direction in Frankfurt am Main) on 1 July 1880. Shortly later, on 1 April 1881, these lines became part of the Royal Railway Administration (left Rhine) in Cologne (K√∂niglichen Eisenbahn-Direction (linksrheinisch) in K√∂ln). Development of the rail network  The Palatine Ludwig Railway Company (Pf√§lzische Ludwigsbahn-Gesellschaft) opened its main line from Homburg to the Prussian border on 25 August 1849. On 20 October 1850 the Saarbr√ºcken Railway extended the line to Neunkirchen. Two years later, on 16 November 1852, passenger trains ran on the line, known as the Forbach Railway, via Sulzbach, Dudweiler and St. Johann-Saarbr√ºcken to reach the French border at Forbach. Freight trains operated on this line from 1 December 1852. The next line built was the Saar line down the Saar valley from Saarbr√ºcken to Trier. It was opened on 16 December 1858 to Merzig and on 26 May 1860 to Trier West on the left bank of the Moselle. On 29 August 1861 the Trier western line was opened from a junction at Konz to the Luxembourg border at Wasserbillig. Upstream a line was opened on 1 June 1870 to Sarreguemines in Lorraine, which was occupied by German troops at the time during the Franco-Prussian War. In 1878/79 several line were opened just before the Saar lines' inclusion of the Railway Administration of Frankfurt: *on 15 May 1878, the Upper Mosel line from Ehrang via Trier to Perl, *on 15 May 1879, the Moselle line from Koblenz via Cochem to Trier *on 15 October 1879, the Fischbach Valley Railway from Saarbr√ºcken via Quierschied to Neunkirchen and a link via Scheidt to the former terminus of the Palatine Ludwig Railway at St. Ingbert.
