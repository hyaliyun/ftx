Properties  Mucus that serves a protective function against acidic environments generally has a high viscosity, though the thickness and viscosity of the mucus layer can vary due to several factors. For example, alkaline mucus in the stomach increases in thickness when the stomach is distended. The pH level of the mucus also plays a role in its viscosity, as higher pH levels tend to alter the thickness of the mucus, making it less viscous. Because of this, invading agents such as Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that causes stomach ulcers, can alter the pH of the mucus to make the mucus pliable enough to move through.http://web.mit.edu/nnf/publications/GHM133.pdf Celli, J.

From the First Folio of Shakespeare's plays, this table of contents divides the plays into groups of Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies. In Shakespeare studies, the problem plays are three plays that William Shakespeare wrote between the late 1590s and the first years of the seventeenth century: All's Well That Ends Well, Measure for Measure, and Troilus and Cressida. Shakespeare's problem plays are characterised by their complex and ambiguous tone, which shifts violently between dark, psychological drama and more straightforward comic material; compare tragicomedy. The term was coined by critic F. S. Boas in Shakespeare and his Predecessors (1896), derived from a type of drama that was popular at the time of Boas' writing. It was most associated with the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen.Shakespeare's Problem Plays In these problem plays, the situation faced by the protagonist is put forward by the author as a representative instance of a contemporary social problem. The term can refer to the subject matter of the play, or to a classification \\"problem\\" with the plays themselves. Some critics include other plays, most commonly The Winter's Tale, Timon of Athens, and The Merchant of Venice.Shakespeare‚Äôs Problem Plays The term has been variously applied to other odd plays from different points in Shakespeare's career, as the notion of a problem-play has always been somewhat vaguely defined and is not accepted by all critics. As conceived by Boas Boas himself lists the first three plays and adds that Hamlet links Shakespeare's problem-plays to his unambiguous tragedies.F. S. Boas, Shakespeare and his Predecessors, John Murray, Third Impression, 1910, pp. 344‚Äì408. For Boas, this modern form of drama provided a useful model with which to study works by Shakespeare that had previously seemed uneasily situated between the comic and the tragic; nominally two of the three plays identified by Boas are comedies, while the third, Troilus and Cressida, is found amongst the tragedies in the First Folio, although it is not listed in the Catalogue (table of contents) of the First Folio. According to Boas, Shakespeare's problem-plays set out to explore specific moral dilemmas and social problems through their central characters. Boas contends that the plays allow the reader to analyze complex and neglected topics. Rather than arousing simple joy or pain, the plays induce engrossment and bewilderment. All's Well that Ends Well and Measure for Measure have resolutions, but Troilus and Cressida and Hamlet do not. Instead Shakespeare requires that the reader decipher the plays. Per Boas, these plays, distinguished by their themes and treatment, require classification beyond comedy; adopting the popular classification of his time, he called them problem plays. Other conceptions Author Neil Rhodes argues that the defining characteristic of the Shakespearean problem-play is its controversial plot, and as such, the subgenre of problem-plays has become less distinct as scholars continue to debate the controversies in Shakespeare's straightforward tragedies and comedies. What differentiates plays like Measure for Measure from Shakespeare's explicitly comedic or tragic plays is that it presents both sides of a contentious issue without making a judgement for the audience. Rhodes goes on to claim that this offering of the merits of both sides of the social dispute is a rhetorical device employed by but not originated by Shakespeare. Rather, the rhetorical practice of submitting a thesis with a counter-contention that is just as persuasive began in Ancient Greece. Per Rhodes, Shakespeare's problem-plays must address a social issue that can reasonably be debated, ranging from gender roles to institutional power frameworks. Another scholarly analysis of Shakespeare's problem-plays by A.G. Harmon argues that what the problem-plays have in common is how each consciously debates the relationship between law and nature. Many of the problem-plays address a disorder in nature, and the characters attempt to mitigate the disorder in varying manners. In four of the plays that Harmon categorizes as problem-plays, The Merchant of Venice, All's Well That Ends Well, Measure for Measure, and Troilus and Cressida, the social order is restored when faulty contracts are properly amended. Harmon's conception of the problem-plays differs from others in that he argues that the problem-plays offer a resolution to their respective stories. Much like the characters in the plays must fulfill their contracts, he argues, Shakespeare fulfills his contract as a playwright by providing resolution. Though Harmon's conception of the problem-plays does not align with the common understanding of Shakespeare's problem-plays, he does provide examples of the social dilemmas that Shakespeare addresses through these plays. The common social problem, per Harmon, is the tension between laws establishing order and the natural tendencies of humans. The problem-plays follow a formula: the established laws of society are challenged, chaos reigns over society, chaos is vanquished by the institution of a new order. From the perspective of scholar Ernest Schanzer, a Shakespearean problem-play is first defined independently of the idea of a Shakespearean play and only by what the phrase problem play itself necessitates. Schanzer chooses to consider only ethical dilemmas in the definition of problem, excluding psychological, political, social, and metaphysical problems that may develop. He concludes that problem plays are classified by a pivotal ethical dilemma that instigates multiple opposing but equally plausible opinions from the audience. Using this theory, Schanzer distinguishes only Measure for Measure as a Shakespearean problem comedy, identifying both All's Well That Ends Well and Troilus and Cressida as lacking of a pivotal ethical dilemma that divides the audience. Schanzer offers Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra in the place of previously recognized problem plays. References  Literature  * E. M. W. Tillyard: Shakespeare's Problem Plays.

Until October 2009, it operated the Boeing Sentry AEW1 Airborne Warning And Control System (AWACS) aircraft from RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire. History =First World War= No. 23 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps was formed at Fort Grange, Gosport on 1 September 1915, commanded by Louis Strange and equipped with a mixture of types. A detachment of Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2C's were deployed to Sutton's Farm to act as night fighters to oppose raids by German Zeppelins, but no successful interceptions resulted.Halley 1971, pp. 29‚Äì30. The squadron moved to France on 16 March 1916 flying FE2b two-seat pusher fighters. The squadron used the FE2b on close-escort duties and to fly standing patrols to engage hostile aircraft wherever they could be found, helping to establish air superiority in the build-up to the Battle of the Somme.Halley 1971, pp. 30‚Äì31. By the end of the year the \\"Fee\\" was obsolete, and the Squadron started to receive Spad S.VII single-seat fighters in February 1917, with its last F.E.2s in April 1917.Halley 1971, pp. 31‚Äì32. 23 Squadron flew its SPADs both on offensive fighter patrols over the front and low-level strafing attacks against German troops.Halley 1971, p. 32. In December 1917 it replaced its SPAD S.VII with the more powerful and heavier armed Spad S.XIII. The squadron converted to Sopwith Dolphins in April 1918 until it disbanded just after the war on 31 December 1919.Lewis 1959, p.22.

The squadron re- equipped with more modern Gloster Gamecock fighters in May 1926, and moved to RAF Kenley in February 1927.Halley 1980, p. 52. In April 1931 the squadron partly re-equipped with Bristol Bulldogs, another single seat fighter, while continuing to operate the Gamecock. Both the Gamecock and Bulldog were outperformed by the Hawker Hart light bomber which had recently entered service with the RAF, and in June 1931, the squadron received a single Hart for evaluation as a two seat fighter. The evaluation was a success, and a flight of six fighter variants of the Hart, designated the Hart Fighter replaced the squadrons remaining Gamecocks from October that year.Halley 1973, pp. 32, 36, 41.Halley 1980, pp. 51‚Äì52.Mason 1992, p. 234. The squadron moved to RAF Biggin Hill in September 1932 and by April 1933, was fully equipped with Hart fighters, which by then were known as Hawker Demons.Halley 1973, p. 36. The Abyssinia Crisis in September 1935 led to the squadron being stripped of both aircraft and men in order to reinforce squadrons that were temporarily deployed overseas, with the squadron inventory dropping to a single aircraft in March 1936 before returning to full strength. It moved to RAF Northolt in December 1936, moving again in May 1938, this time to RAF Wittering. In December 1938 the squadron replaced its obsolete Demon biplanes with the Bristol Blenheim twin-engine monoplane, another bomber converted to a fighter.224x224px =Second World War= A 23 Squadron Havoc at RAF Ford in December 1941 On the outbreak of the Second World War the squadron, still equipped with Blenheims, became a night-fighter squadron. The squadron scored its first victory of the war on 18 June 1940, when a German Heinkel He 111 was shot down over Cley next the Sea, Norfolk, with another He 111 being shot down the same night, although two Blenheims were lost to return fire from German bombers. As the Blenheim was too slow and lightly armed to be an effective night fighter, the squadron began to operate in the night intruder role in December 1940, attacking German bombers as they returned to their airfields in France. From March 1941 the squadron replaced its Blenheims with the American Douglas Havoc, which were supplemented by the Boston III variant of the Havoc in February 1942. In July 1942 the squadron re-equipped with the more capable de Havilland Mosquito. In December 1942 the squadron transferred to the Mediterranean, flying from RAF Luqa on Malta. It attacked enemy airfields and railway targets in Sicily, Tunisia and Italy through 1943, moving to Sardinia in December 1943, which allowed targets in Southern France to be attacked.Halley 1973, pp. 38‚Äì39. In June 1944 the squadron returned to England, operating from RAF Little Snoring in Norfolk as part of 100 Group. The role of 100 Group was bomber support, i.e. to disrupt the Luftwaffe's attempts to stop the British bomber offensive, with 23 Squadron being tasked with low level night intruder operations against German night fighters. In addition to its normal night time operations, the squadron also carried out daylight bomber escort missions.Halley 1973, p. 39. 23 Sqn was disbanded, following the war's end, on 25 September 1945.Halley 1980, p. 51. =Postwar operations= The squadron was reformed on 1 September 1946 as a night fighter squadron operating the de Havilland Mosquito. It received jet aircraft in the form of de Havilland Vampire NF.10s in 1953, replacing them with de Havilland Venom NF.2s in June 1954. The squadron acquired Venom NF.3 in 1957. 23 Squadron English Electric Lightning F.6 at its RAF Leuchars base in 1970 23 Squadron Phantom FGR.2 wearing the unit's Eagle symbol in 1977 A No. 23 Squadron Phantom at RAF Stanley in 1984 In 1957 the squadron converted to the Gloster Javelin all-weather fighter, beginning a long period operating in the air defence role. The squadron has a strong heritage in the air defence role, operating Gloster Javelins, Lightnings, Phantoms and Tornado F3s. The squadron first acquired Phantoms on 1 November 1975 at RAF Coningsby before moving to RAF Wattisham for just under 10 years. Then in October 1983 the squadron deployed to Stanley airfield, Falkland Islands after their recapture from Argentina, arriving there on 1 November. They remained here until 31 October 1988 when its duty was assumed by 1435 Flight. The squadron then reformed on 1 November 1988 at RAF Leeming with the Panavia Tornado which it operated until 26 February 1994, when the unit was disbanded.Jefford 2001, p. 35. The squadron assumed the Airborne Early Warning role upon reformation in April 1996, sharing the RAF's Sentry AEW1 fleet with No. 8 Squadron. The squadron disbanded on 2 October 2009, when it amalgamated with No 8 Squadron. =Future= At the Air & Space Power Conference on 17 July 2019 it was announced that the squadron would reform as the RAF's first dedicated squadron to deal with space. Notable squadron members Among the 19 aces that served within its ranks in World War I were William Kennedy-Cochran-Patrick, Douglas U. McGregor, James William Pearson, Clive W. Warman, Frederick J. Gibbs, Conn Standish O'Grady, Herbert Drewitt, James Fitz-Morris, Harold Albert White, Alfred Edwin McKay, Harry Compton, and Arthur Bradfield Fairclough. Douglas Bader was a member of 23 Squadron when he crashed carrying out low level aerobatics, losing his legs in the process. He went on to become one of the highest scoring aces of the RAF in World War II. Air Officer Commanding Sir Peter Wykeham was credited with shooting down at least 15 hostile aircraft at various theatres of World War II. He was later promoted to Air Marshal. He served as Officer Commanding No. 38 Group from 1960, the Director of the Joint Warfare Staff from 1962, the Commander of the Far East Air Force from 1964 and the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff from 1967 before retiring in 1969. Andrew George Walton flew with the squadron in Tornados and Phantoms, and rose to the rank of Air Vice Marshal, receiving a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the process, before retiring in 2010. Wing Commander A J 'Red' Owen DFC and Bar, AFC, DFM, was 23 Squadron's commanding officer between May 1962 and October 1964. He was one of the RAFs most successful night fighter pilots during World War II, credited with destroying at least 15 enemy aircraft.

As an administrative region, Darfur is divided into five federal states: Central Darfur, East Darfur, North Darfur, South Darfur and West Darfur. Because of the War in Darfur between Sudanese government forces and the indigenous population, the region has been in a state of humanitarian emergency since 2003. The first historical mention of the word Fur occurs in 1664 in the account by J. M. Vansleb, a German traveler, of a visit to Egypt (Petermann (1862-3). Mittheilungen, Erganzungsband II). It is claimed that, like s≈´dƒÅn, f≈´r means \\"blacks\\", and was the name given by the early light-colored Berber sultans of Darfur to the original inhabitants of the country such as the Binga, Banda, etc. As the historic dynasty's physical appearance became more \\"Africanized\\" from intermarriage with black wives and concubines, the appearance of the sultans darkened correspondingly and they became known by the appellation of their subjects, F≈´r.Arkell, A.J.

Geography Deriba Crater is at the highest point of the Marrah Mountains Overland trucks en route near Jebel Marra, 2019 Darfur covers an area of , approximately the size of mainland Spain. It is largely a semi-arid plateau with the Marrah Mountains (Jebel Marra), a range of volcanic peaks rising up to of topographic prominence, in the center of the region. The region's main towns are Al Fashir, Geneina, and Nyala. There are four main features of its physical geography. The whole eastern half of Darfur is covered with plains and low hills of sandy soils, known as goz, and sandstone hills. In many places the goz is waterless and can only be inhabited where there are water reservoirs or deep boreholes. While dry, goz may also support rich pasture and arable land. To the north the goz is overtaken by the desert sands of the Sahara. A second feature are the wadis, which range from seasonal watercourses that flood only occasionally during the wet season to large wadis that flood for most of the rains and flow from western Darfur hundreds of kilometres west to Lake Chad. Many wadis have pans of alluvium with rich heavy soil that are also difficult to cultivate. Western Darfur is dominated by the third feature, basement rock, sometimes covered with a thin layer of sandy soil. Basement rock is too infertile to be farmed, but provides sporadic forest cover that can be grazed by animals. The fourth and final feature are the Marrah Mountains and Daju Hills, volcanic plugs created by a massif, that rise up to a peak at Deriba crater where there is a small area of temperate climate, high rainfall and permanent springs of water. Remote sensing has detected the imprint of a vast underground lake under Darfur. The potential water deposits are estimated at . The lake, during epochs when the region was more humid, would have contained about of water.\\"Underground lake may bring Darfur peace: scientist\\" by Tanzina Vega, Reuters, July 18, 2007 It may have dried up thousands of years ago.Ancient Darfur lake 'is dried up', BBC, July 20, 2007 History Flag of the rebel Darfur Liberation Front Most of the region consists of a semi-arid plain and thus appears unsuitable for developing a large and complex civilization. But the Marrah Mountains offer plentiful water, and by the 12th century the Daju people, succeeding the semi- legendary Tora culture, created the first historical attestable kingdom. They were centered in the Marrah Mountains and left records of valuable rock engravings, stone architecture and a (orally preserved) list of kings. The Tunjur replaced the Daju in the fourteenth century and the Daju established new headquarters in Abyei, Denga, Darsila and Mongo in the current Chad. The Tunjur sultans intermarried with the Fur and sultan Musa Sulayman (reigned c.1667 to c.1695) is considered the founder of the Keira dynasty. Darfur became a great power of the Sahel under the Keira dynasty, expanding its borders as far east as the Atbarah River and attracting immigrants from Bornu and Bagirmi. During the mid-18th century conflict between rival factions wracked the country, and external war pitted Darfur against Sennar and Wadai. In 1875, the weakened kingdom was destroyed by the Egyptian ruler set up in Khartoum, largely through the machinations of Sebehr Rahma, a slave-trader, who was competing with the dar over access to ivory in Bahr el Ghazal to the south of Darfur. The Darfuris were restive under Egyptian rule, but were no more predisposed to accept the rule of the self-proclaimed Mahdi, Muhammad Ahmad, when in 1882 his Emir of Darfur, who came from the Southern Darfur Arab Rizeigat tribe led by Sheikh Madibbo, defeated the Ottoman forces led by Slatin Pasha (that had just invaded Egypt earlier that year) in Darfur. When Ahmad's successor, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, himself an Arab of Southern Darfur from the Ta‚Äôisha tribe, demanded that the pastoralist tribes provide soldiers, several tribes rose up in revolt. Following the overthrow of Abdallahi at Omdurman in 1899 by the Anglo-Egyptian forces, the new Anglo-Egyptian government recognized Ali Dinar as the sultan of Darfur and largely left the Dar to its own affairs except for a nominal annual tribute. In 1916 the British, concerned that the sultanate might fall under the influence of the Ottoman Empire, invaded and incorporated Darfur into the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Colonial rule directed financial and administrative resources to the tribes of central Sudan near Khartoum - to the detriment of the outlying regions such as Darfur. = Under Sudanese rule= internally displaced by the ongoing War in Darfur.

A famine in the mid-1980s disrupted many societal structures and led to the first significant modern fighting amongst Darfuris. A low-level conflict continued for the next fifteen years, with the government co-opting and arming Arab Janjaweed militias against its enemies. The fighting reached a peak in 2003 with the beginning of the Darfur conflict, in which the resistance coalesced into a roughly cohesive rebel movement. Human-rights groups and the UN, March, 2004,Un.org came to regard the conflict as one of the worst humanitarian disasters in the world. Insurgency and counter-insurgency have led to 480,000 deaths (the Khartoum government disputes the numbers). Academics have debated whether to consider this crisis a genocide. \\"By 2010 about 300,000 had died, according to the UN best estimate and about 3,000,000 were forced into refugee camps\\"Richard Cockett Sudan: Darfur and the failure of an African state. 2010. p, 191.

Only one rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement, subscribed to the agreement; the Justice and Equality Movement rejected it, resulting in a continuation of the conflict. The agreement includes provisions for wealth sharing and power sharing, and established a Transitional Darfur Regional Authority to help administer Darfur until a referendum could take place on the future of the region. The leader of the Sudan Liberation Movement, Minni Minnawi, was appointed Senior Assistant to the President of Sudan and Chairman of the transitional authority in 2007. Doha peace forum In December 2010, representatives of the Liberation and Justice Movement, an umbrella organisation of ten rebel groups, formed in February of that year, started a fresh round of talks with the Sudanese Government in Doha, Qatar. A new rebel group, the Sudanese Alliance Resistance Forces in Darfur, was formed and the Justice and Equality Movement planned further talks. The talks ended on December 19 without a new peace agreement, but participants agreed on basic principles, including a regional authority and a referendum on autonomy for Darfur. The possibility of a Darfuri Vice-President was also discussed. In January 2011, the leader of the Liberation and Justice Movement, Dr. Tijani Sese, stated that the movement had accepted the core proposals of the Darfur peace document proposed by the joint-mediators in Doha; the proposals included a $300,000,000 compensation package for victims of atrocities in Darfur and special courts to conduct trials of persons accused of human-rights violations. Proposals for a new Darfur Regional Authority were also included; this authority would have an executive council of 18 ministers and would remain in place for five years. The current three Darfur states and state governments would also continue to exist during this period. In February 2011 the Sudanese Government rejected the idea of a single region headed by a vice- president from the region. On 29 January, the leaders of the Liberation and Justice Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to the Doha negotiations and agreement to attend the Doha forum on 5 February. The Sudanese government had not yet agreed to attend the forum on that date and instead favoured an internal peace process without the involvement of rebel groups. Later in February, the Sudanese Government agreed to return to the Doha peace forum with a view to complete a new peace agreement by the end of that month. On 25 February, both the Liberation and Justice Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement announced that they had rejected the peace document proposed by the mediators in Doha. The main sticking points were the issues of a Darfuri vice-president and compensation for victims. The Sudanese government had not commented on the peace document. At the Doha Peace Forum in June, the Joint Mediators proposed a new Darfur Peace Agreement, which would supersede the Abuja Agreement of 2005 and if signed, would halt preparations for a Darfur status referendum. The proposal included provisions for a Darfuri Vice-President and an administrative structure that includes both the three states and a strategic regional authority, the Darfur Regional Authority, to oversee Darfur as a whole.Sudantribune.com The new agreement was signed by the Government of Sudan and the Liberation and Justice Movement on 14 July. The Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement did not sign the new document at that time but had three months in which to do so if they wished. 2020 peace agreement A comprehensive peace agreement was signed on 31 August 2020 in Juba, South Sudan, between the Sudanese authorities and rebel factions to end armed hostilities. Languages Languages of Darfur include Arabic, Daju, Erenga, Fongoro, Fulbe, Fur (thus the name of the region), Masalit, Sinyar, Tama, Midob, and Zaghawa.

The Darfur Peace Agreement of 2006 established a Transitional Darfur Regional Authority as an interim authority for the region. The agreement stated that a referendum on the status of Darfur should be held no later than 2011. Minni Minnawi was the first chair of this authority, holding that office from April 2007 until December 2010, when he was succeeded by Shartai Jaafar Abdel Hakam. The peace agreement that was signed in July 2011 saw the Transitional Darfur Regional Authority reconstituted as the Darfur Regional Authority with executive and legislative functions. The chairperson of the Darfur Regional Authority, Tijani Sese, assumed the post on 20 September 2011. The regional authority was dissolved in July 2016 following a referendum, on the status of the Darfur region within Sudan. Demographics and economy In 2008, Darfur's population was 7.5 million. This in an increase by nearly six times from 1973 (1.3 million). 52% are aged 16 years or younger. Darfur's budget was US$286 million in 2008. Bibliography * Arkell, A. J., \\"A History of Darfur.

The presence of sarcomeres manifests as a series of bands visible along the muscle fibers, which is responsible for the striated appearance observed in microscopic images of this tissue. There are two types of striated muscles: *Cardiac muscle (heart muscle) * Skeletal muscle (muscle attached to the skeleton) Structure Striated muscle tissue contains T-tubules which enables the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. =Skeletal muscle= Skeletal muscle includes skeletal muscle fibers, blood vessels, nerve fibers, and connective tissue. Skeletal muscle is wrapped in epimysium, allowing structural integrity of the muscle despite contractions. The perimysium organizes the muscle fibers, which are encased in collagen and endomysium, into fascicles. Each muscle fiber contains sarcolemma, sarcoplasm, and sarcoplasmic reticulum. The functional unit of a muscle fiber is called a sarcomere. Each myofiber is composed of actin and myosin myofibrils repeated as a sarcomere. Based on their contractile and metabolic phenotypes, skeletal muscle can be classified as slow-oxidative (Type I) or fast-oxidative (Type II). =Cardiac muscle= Cardiac muscle lies in between the epicardium and the endocardium in the heart. Cardiac muscle fibers generally only contain one nucleus, located in the central region. They contain many mitochondria and myoglobin. Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cells are unicellular. These cells are connected to each other by intercalated disks, which contain gap junctions and desmosomes. Differences between striated and smooth muscle The main difference between striated muscle tissue and smooth muscle tissue is that striated muscle tissue features sarcomeres while smooth muscle tissue does not. All striated muscles are attached to some component of the skeleton, unlike smooth muscle, which composes hollow organs such as the intestines or blood vessels. The fibres of striated muscle have a cylindrical shape with blunt ends, whereas those in smooth muscle can be described as being spindle-like with tapered ends. Two other characteristics that differentiate striated muscle from smooth muscle are that the former has more mitochondria and contains cells that are multinucleated. Function The main function of striated muscle tissue is to create force and contract. These contractions will either pump blood throughout the body (cardiac muscle) or powers breathing, movement or posture (skeletal muscle). =Contractions= Contractions in cardiac muscle tissue are due to pacemaker cells. These cells respond to signals from the autonomic nervous system to either increase or decrease the heart rate. Pacemaker cells have autorhythmicity. The set intervals at which they depolarize to threshold and fire action potentials is what determines the heart rate. Because of the gap junctions, the pacemaker cells transfer the depolarization to other cardiac muscle fibers, in order to contract in unison. Signals from motor neurons cause myofibers to depolarize and therefore release calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The calcium drives the movement of myosin and actin filaments. The sarcomere then shortend which causes the muscle to contract. In the skeletal muscles connected to tendons that pull on bones, the mysia fuses to the periosteum that coats the bone. Contraction of the muscle will transfer to the mysia, then the tendon and the periosteum before causing the bone to move. The mysia also may bind to an aponeurosis or to fascia. Damage repair Adult humans cannot regenerate cardiac muscle tissue after an injury, which can lead to scarring and thus heart failure. Mammals have the ability to complete small amounts of cardiac regeneration during development. Other vertebrates can regenerate cardiac muscle tissue throughout their entire life span. Skeletal muscle is able to regenerate far better than cardiac muscle due to satellite cells, which are dormant in all healthy skeletal muscle tissue. There are three phases to the regeneration process. These phases include the inflammatory response, the activation, differentiation, and fusion of satellite cells, and the maturation and remodeling of newly formed myofibrils. This process begins with the necrosis of damaged muscle fibers, which in turn induces the inflammatory response. Macrophages induce phagocytosis of the cell debris. They will eventually secrete anti- inflammatory cytokines, which results in the termination of inflammation. These macrophages can also facilitate the proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells. The satellite cells re-enter the cell cycle to multiply. They then leave the cell cycle to self-renew or differentiate as myoblasts. Dysfunctions =Skeletal Muscle= *Sarcopenia (loss of skeletal muscle mass associated with aging) *Polymyositis (chronic inflammation) *Dermatomyositis (chronic inflammation with skin rash) *Inclusion body myositis (common age-related inflammatory disease) =Cardiac Muscle= *Coronary Artery Disease (narrowed coronary arteries) *Arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) *Cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle) See also *Smooth muscle tissue *Skeletal Muscle *Cardiac Muscle References Muscular system ","title":"Striated muscle tissue"},{"id":"605853","text":"No. 1435 Flight is a Typhoon FGR. 4 unit of the Royal Air Force, based at RAF Mount Pleasant, providing air defence for the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.

Mannyng provides a surprising amount of information about himself in his two known works, Handlyng Synne and Mannyng's Chronicle. In these two works, Mannyng tells of his residencies at the Gilbertine houses of Sempringham (near Bourne) and Sixhills, and also at the Gilbertine priory at Cambridge, St Edmund‚Äôs. Upbringing His name, Robert de Brunne, indicates that he came from the place then known as Brunne (Bourne, Lincolnshire), thirteen kilometres south of Sempringham Priory, the mother house of the Gilbertine Order. Both places lie on the western edge of the Lincolnshire fens. He entered the house in 1288, was trained there and moved to Cambridge, probably as part of his training. He was moved on to Sixhills1 priory at (TF1787) in the Lincolnshire Wolds near Market Rasen. He will have spent most of his life at Sempringham, despite the frequent modern assertion that he was a monk of Bourne Abbey. The latter was an Arrouasian house, later regarded as Augustinian. This interpretation is supported by Mannyng's introduction to Handlyng Synne, in which he says that he had been at the abbey fifteen years: ten in the time of John Camelton (Hamilton) (the prior at Sempringham from c1298 to 1312), and five winters with Hamilton's successor, John Clyntone. However, he clearly retained an interest in the people of Bourne, as he addressed Handlyng Synne \\"to all Christian men under the sun and to good men of Bourne and specially ... the fellowship of Sempringham\\". His works Handlyng Synne (1303) is a twelve thousand line devotional or penitential piece, written in Middle English rhymed couplets, deriving many of its exempla from the Anglo-Norman Manuel des Peches of William of Waddington. Mannyng's Chronicle, supposedly completed in 1338, translates Wace's Roman de Brut for British history from the Anglo-Norman, before translating Piers Langtoft's (Peter of Langtoft) Chronicle for English and post-Conquest history.2 His legacy Mannyng was primarily a historiographer, and his significance lies in his participation in the tri-lingual tradition of writing history. His work in Middle English is part of a larger movement at the beginning of the fourteenth century towards the replacement of Latin and Anglo-Norman by written works in Middle English, but is not groundbreaking. It is as a history writer, in particular, through his indebtedness to the great twelfth century histories of Henry of Huntingdon, William of Malmesbury, and Geoffrey of Monmouth, that Mannyng stands out. His verse is often seen as rather pedestrian; however, in the exempla in Handling Synne, in particular, there is a life and a colour which give vibrancy to the tales and which make the work very entertaining to read‚Äîunlike several other contemporary penitential works.

It was the only completely English religious order and came to an end in the 16th century at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Modest Gilbertine revivals have taken place in the late 20th and early 21st centuries on three continents. Founding Gilbert of Sempringham flanked by two nuns Gilbert initially established a community for enclosed contemplative nuns. He accepted seven women whom he had taught in the village school and in 1131 founded an order of nuns based on the Cistercian Rule.Butler, Richard Urban. \\"Order of Gilbertines.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 12 Oct. 2014 Gilbert set up buildings and a cloister for them against the north wall of the church, which stood on his land at Sempringham, and gave them a rule of life, enjoining upon them chastity, humility, obedience, and charity. Their daily necessaries were passed to them through a window by some girls chosen by Gilbert from among his people. As the serving maids requested that they too might have a dress and rule of life, on the advice of William, abbot of Rievaulx, he decided to add lay sisters to the community. Eventually Gilbert added lay brothers to work the fields. In 1139 the small order opened its first new foundation on the island of Haverholm, a gift from Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln. Each Gilbertine house now practically consisted of four communities, one of nuns, one of canons, one of lay sisters, and one of lay brothers. Over the years, more and more new foundations were established. In 1147 he left England for Continental Europe to seek assistance, and approached the Cistercian Order at its major house in C√Æteaux to take on the running of his foundations. The Cistercians declined, apparently because they felt unable to administer houses for both men and women, but Pope Eugene III, himself a Cistercian, intervened to ask the abbot, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, to assist Gilbert in drawing up Institutes for a new Order, which combined Benedictine and Cistercian influences. Pope Eugene then appointed Gilbert as the first Master of the Order of Sempringham or Gilbertines. Gilbert returned to England in 1148, and completed the order, by appointing canons, who lived according to variant of the Augustinian rule, to serve his community as priests, and to help him in the work of administration. Habits The Nuns wore a black tunic and a black scapular for work. They also wore a black lamb's wool head-dress with a coarse black cloth veil. The Sisters wore a dark tunic without the scapular. They also wore a sheepskin cloak and a long hood. The Canons Regular wore a black cassock with a white hooded cloakMonasticon Vol.2 p.791 (lined with lamb's wool)English Monastic Life, Gasquet, Francis Aidan, 1904, p.229 with shoes of red leather.S. Gilbert of Sempringham and the Gilbertines, Graham, Rose, 1901, p. 71 When labouring, they would use the scapular. In choir, they wore white copes. The Brothers wore a dark tunic with a dark cloak lined with rough skins. They wore a cloth cope to the heels to wear in the Church. Layout Each Gilbertine priory had one church, divided unequally by a wall. The nuns had the larger part, and the canons the smaller. The latter would join the nuns only to celebrate mass. From the church, the nunnery normally stood to the north and the canons' lodgings to the south. Scandals In the mid-twelfth century, a girl was brought to Watton Priory as a child, but had no real religious vocation. This Nun of Watton became pregnant by a lay brother, who fled, but he was brought back for punishment. Towards the end of Gilbert's life, when he was around 90 years old, some of the lay brothers at Sempringham rose up against him, complaining of too much work and too little food. The rebels, led by two skilled craftsmen, received money from both religious and secular supporters and took their case to Rome. Pope Alexander III ruled in Gilbert's favour, but the living conditions of the lay brothers were improved thereafter. The Middle Ages The Gilbertine order was always popular in England and Wales. Its houses were the final homes of the last of the Welsh royal family, young daughters, after the rest had been defeated and killed in the 1280s. Principal among these was Gwenllian who was sent to Sempringham Priory and a monument commemorating her was placed near the Priory site in the 1990s. Many English kings gave the order generous charters, and yet it always had financial problems. By the end of the 15th century, the Order was greatly impoverished, and King Henry VI exempted all of its houses from paying taxes and from any other sort of payment. He could not force his successors to do the same. Dissolution Malton Priory, West front By the time of the Dissolution, there were twenty-six houses of Gilbertines, but only four of these were ranked as \\"greater houses\\", having annual incomes above ¬£200. Following the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act of 1536, these houses gave in to King Henry VIII in 1538 without a fight, surrendering \\"of their own free will\\". Each nun and canon then received a pension for the rest of their lives. The last Master of the Order, Robert Holgate is credited with using his influence to save them for a few years. Malton Priory, one of the lesser Gilbertine houses, was the last to surrender in December 1539,Gilbertine houses: Priory of Malton. A History of the County of York: Volume 3 (1974), pp. 253-254 (Public domain text), accessed via British History Online. whereas Sempringham Priory, worth more than ¬£200 a year, surrendered in 1538.Page, William, 'Houses of the Gilbertine order: The priory of Sempringham', A History of the County of Lincoln: Volume 2 (1906), pp. 179‚Äì187, (Public domain text), accessed via British History online Holgate was already the Bishop of Llandaff but translated to become Archbishop of York in 1545. The Gilbertines were the only purely English order (except for one short-lived house in Scotland), therefore the Dissolution marked their permanent end. Legacy The Gilbertine legacy is fairly small; only fifteen extant manuscripts are associated with the Order, originating from only five of the Gilbertine houses. Four additional works ascribed to Gilbertines, but not surviving in Gilbertine copies, include the Vita of Gilbert of Sempringham, the Gilbertine Rule, the so-called 'Sempringham Continuation' to Le Livere de Reis Engleterre, and the works of Robert Mannyng. The remains of one Gilbertine monastery, Malton Priory, have been incorporated into the parish church at Malton in North Yorkshire. The original monastery was established around 1150, and, though it has suffered considerable abuse, the surviving fragment remains impressive. Although the Priory at Sempringham was destroyed, the adjacent and contemporary parish church of St Andrew remains and some evidence of mediaeval decoration is still to be found.

Spell-checking features are often embedded in software or services, such as a word processor, email client, electronic dictionary, or search engine. Google Chrome spell checker in action for the above poem, the word \\"chequer\\" marked as unrecognized word Design A basic spell checker carries out the following processes: * It scans the text and extracts the words contained in it. * It then compares each word with a known list of correctly spelled words (i.e. a dictionary). This might contain just a list of words, or it might also contain additional information, such as hyphenation points or lexical and grammatical attributes. * An additional step is a language-dependent algorithm for handling morphology. Even for a lightly inflected language like English, the spell-checker will need to consider different forms of the same word, such as plurals, verbal forms, contractions, and possessives. For many other languages, such as those featuring agglutination and more complex declension and conjugation, this part of the process is more complicated. It is unclear whether morphological analysis-- allowing for many different forms of a word depending on its grammatical role --provides a significant benefit for English, though its benefits for highly synthetic languages such as German, Hungarian or Turkish are clear. As an adjunct to these components, the program's user interface will allow users to approve or reject replacements and modify the program's operation. An alternative type of spell checker uses solely statistical information, such as n-grams, to recognize errors instead of correctly-spelled words. This approach usually requires a lot of effort to obtain sufficient statistical information. Key advantages include needing less runtime storage and the ability to correct errors in words that are not included in a dictionary.U.S. Patent 6618697, Method for rule-based correction of spelling and grammar errors In some cases spell checkers use a fixed list of misspellings and suggestions for those misspellings; this less flexible approach is often used in paper-based correction methods, such as the see also entries of encyclopedias.

History =Pre- PC= In 1961, Les Earnest, who headed the research on this budding technology, saw it necessary to include the first spell checker that accessed a list of 10,000 acceptable words. Ralph Gorin, a graduate student under Earnest at the time, created the first true spelling checker program written as an applications program (rather than research) for general English text: SPELL for the DEC PDP-10 at Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, in February 1971. Gorin wrote SPELL in assembly language, for faster action; he made the first spelling corrector by searching the word list for plausible correct spellings that differ by a single letter or adjacent letter transpositions and presenting them to the user. Gorin made SPELL publicly accessible, as was done with most SAIL (Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) programs, and it soon spread around the world via the new ARPAnet, about ten years before personal computers came into general use. SPELL, its algorithms and data structures inspired the Unix ispell program. The first spell checkers were widely available on mainframe computers in the late 1970s.

On the pre-Windows PCs, these spell checkers were standalone programs, many of which could be run in TSR mode from within word-processing packages on PCs with sufficient memory. However, the market for standalone packages was short-lived, as by the mid-1980s developers of popular word-processing packages like WordStar and WordPerfect had incorporated spell checkers in their packages, mostly licensed from the above companies, who quickly expanded support from just English to many European and eventually even Asian languages. However, this required increasing sophistication in the morphology routines of the software, particularly with regard to heavily-agglutinative languages like Hungarian and Finnish. Although the size of the word-processing market in a country like Iceland might not have justified the investment of implementing a spell checker, companies like WordPerfect nonetheless strove to localize their software for as many national markets as possible as part of their global marketing strategy. When Apple Macintosh developed \\"a system-wide spelling checker\\" so that \\"the operating system took over spelling fixes,\\" it was a first: one \\"didn't have to maintain a separate spelling checker for each\\" program. Mac OS X's spellcheck coverage includes virtually all bundled and third party applications. Visual Tools' VT Speller, introduced in 1994, was \\"designed for developers of applications that support Windows.\\" It came with a dictionary but had the ability to build and incorporate use of secondary dictionaries. =Browsers= Firefox 2.0, a web browser, has spell check support for user-written content, such as when editing Wikitext, writing on many webmail sites, blogs, and social networking websites. The web browsers Google Chrome, Konqueror, and Opera, the email client Kmail and the instant messaging client Pidgin also offer spell checking support, transparently using previously GNU Aspell and currently Hunspell as their engine. =Specialties= Some spell checkers have separate support for medical dictionaries to help prevent medical errors.  Functionality  The first spell checkers were \\"verifiers\\" instead of \\"correctors.\\" They offered no suggestions for incorrectly spelled words. This was helpful for typos but it was not so helpful for logical or phonetic errors. The challenge the developers faced was the difficulty in offering useful suggestions for misspelled words. This requires reducing words to a skeletal form and applying pattern-matching algorithms. It might seem logical that where spell-checking dictionaries are concerned, \\"the bigger, the better,\\" so that correct words are not marked as incorrect. In practice, however, an optimal size for English appears to be around 90,000 entries. If there are more than this, incorrectly spelled words may be skipped because they are mistaken for others. For example, a linguist might determine on the basis of corpus linguistics that the word baht is more frequently a misspelling of bath or bat than a reference to the Thai currency. Hence, it would typically be more useful if a few people who write about Thai currency were slightly inconvenienced than if the spelling errors of the many more people who discuss baths were overlooked. Enchant, the AbiWord spell checker. The first MS-DOS spell checkers were mostly used in proofing mode from within word processing packages. After preparing a document, a user scanned the text looking for misspellings. Later, however, batch processing was offered in such packages as Oracle's short-lived CoAuthor and allowed a user to view the results after a document was processed and correct only the words that were known to be wrong. When memory and processing power became abundant, spell checking was performed in the background in an interactive way, such as has been the case with the Sector Software produced Spellbound program released in 1987 and Microsoft Word since Word 95. In recent years, spell checkers have become increasingly sophisticated; some are now capable of recognizing simple grammatical errors. However, even at their best, they rarely catch all the errors in a text (such as homophone errors) and will flag neologisms and foreign words as misspellings. Nonetheless, spell checkers can be considered as a type of foreign language writing aid that non-native language learners can rely on to detect and correct their misspellings in the target language.Banks, T. (2008). Foreign Language Learning Difficulties and Teaching Strategies. (pp. 29). Master's Thesis, Dominican University of California. Retrieved 19 March 2012.  Spell-checking non-English languages  English is unusual in that most words used in formal writing have a single spelling that can be found in a typical dictionary, with the exception of some jargon and modified words. In many languages, words are often concatenated into new combinations of words. In German, compound nouns are frequently coined from other existing nouns. Some scripts do not clearly separate one word from another, requiring word- splitting algorithms. Each of these presents unique challenges to non-English language spell checkers. Context-sensitive spell checkers There has been research on developing algorithms that are capable of recognizing a misspelled word, even if the word itself is in the vocabulary, based on the context of the surrounding words. Not only does this allow words such as those in the poem above to be caught, but it mitigates the detrimental effect of enlarging dictionaries, allowing more words to be recognized. For example, baht in the same paragraph as Thai or Thailand would not be recognized as a misspelling of bath. The most common example of errors caught by such a system are homophone errors, such as the bold words in the following sentence: :Their coming too sea if its reel. The most successful algorithm to date is Andrew Golding and Dan Roth's \\"Winnow-based spelling correction algorithm\\", published in 1999, which is able to recognize about 96% of context-sensitive spelling errors, in addition to ordinary non-word spelling errors. A context-sensitive spell checker appears in Microsoft Office 2007, and also appeared in the now-defunct Google Wave. Grammar checkers attempt to fix problems with grammar beyond spelling errors, including incorrect choice of words.

It is biologically similar to grafting and such trees are referred to in forestry as gemels, from the Latin word meaning \\"a pair\\".Morton, Page 35 It is most common for branches of two trees of the same species to grow together, though inosculation may be noted across related species. The branches first grow separately in proximity to each other until they touch. At this point, the bark on the touching surfaces is gradually abraded away as the trees move in the wind. Once the cambium of two trees touches, they sometimes self-graft and grow together as they expand in diameter. Inosculation customarily results when tree limbs are braided or pleached. The term inosculation is also used in the context of plastic surgery, as one of the three mechanisms by which skin grafts take at the host site. Blood vessels from the recipient site are believed to connect with those of the graft in order to restore vascularity. Species Inosculation is most common among the following species of tree due to their thin bark: *Apple *Almond *Ash *Beech *Crepe myrtle *Chestnut *Dogwood *Elm *Ficus *Grape *Hazelnut *Hornbeam *Laburnum *Linden *Maple *Olive *Peach *Pear *Privet *River Red Gum *Sycamore *Willow *Wisteria Conjoined trees Two trees may grow to their mature size adjacent to each other and seemingly grow together or conjoin, demonstrating inosculation. These may be of the same species or even of different genera or families, depending on whether the two trees have become truly grafted together (once the cambium of two trees touches, they self-graft and grow together). Usually grafting is only between two trees of the same or closely related species or genera, but the appearance of grafting can be given by two trees that are physically touching, rubbing, intertwined, or entangled.Multitrunk and other tree forms Both conifers and deciduous trees can become conjoined. Beech trees in particular are frequent conjoiners, as is blackthorn (Prunus spinosa). Husband and Wife blackthorn. (Prunus spinosa) at Lynncraigs farm, Dalry, North Ayrshire, Scotland. Such trees are often colloquially referred to as \\"husband and wife\\" trees, or \\"marriage trees\\". The straightforward application of the term comes from the obvious unification of two separate individual trees, although a more humorous use of the term relates to the suggestive appearance of some natural examples. There may be a degree of religious intent, as some cults are organized around beliefs that trees contain a hidden or sacred power to cure or to enhance fertility, or that they contain the souls of ancestors or of the unborn.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Tree-marriage =Examples= At the ruined Lynncraigs Farm, Dalry, North Ayrshire in Scotland, a blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), standing in the old farm garden, shows signs of having been deliberately grafted. On his Tour of Scotland, published in 1800, T. Garnett notes a tree near Inveraray that the locals called the Marriage tree, formed from a lime tree with two trunks that have been joined by a branch in the manner of a person putting an arm around another (see illustration) as would a married couple.Garnett, Page 88 On the way to the Heavenly Lake near Urumqi in China are a pair of trees that local people have called the Husband and Wife trees because they are connected by a living branch.Married couple trees The Tatajia Husband and Wife trees are in TaiwanConjoined trees in Yushan National Park at Sun-Moon-Lake.

Down, slightly north of Wolfenden's Bridge, stand two beech trees (see 'Gallery') at the entrance to Chrome Hill, on the Lambeg to Ballyskeagh road. In the late 18th century, John Wesley was staying at Chrome Hill and decided to weave together two young beech trees to act as a symbol of unity between the Methodist Church and the Church of Ireland. At Doonholm near Ayr an ancient sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) was famous for the multiple fusion of its boughs that gave it a unique appearance and greatly strengthened it.MacArthur, Page 81 Gallery File:John Wesley's beech trees, Lambeg, Co.

It was named after the second Governor (British Vice-Regal representative) of the colony of South Australia, George Gawler.History of Gawler 'Shawfactors' It is about north of the centre of the state capital, Adelaide, and is close to the major wine producing district of the Barossa Valley. Topographically, Gawler lies at the confluence of two tributaries of the Gawler River, the North and South Para rivers, where they emerge from a range of low hills. Historically a semi-rural area, Gawler has been swept up in Adelaide's growth in recent years, and is now considered by some as an outer northern suburb of Adelaide. It is counted as a suburb in the Outer Metro region of the Greater Adelaide Planning Region.Welcome to The 30-Year Plan for Greater Adelaide SA Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure. Retrieved 5 May 2018. History Gawler in around 1869 A British colony, South Australia was established as a commercial venture by the South Australia Company through the sale of land to free settlers at ¬£1 per acre (¬£2/9/5d per hectare). Gawler was established through a \\"special survey\\" applied for by Henry Dundas Murray and John Reid and a syndicate of ten other colonists. The town plan was devised by the colonial surveyor William Light, and was the only town planned by him other than Adelaide. William Jacob used Light's plans and laid out the town. Adelaide became a model of foresight with wide streets and ample parklands. After Light's death, it also became a model for numerous other planned towns in South Australia (many of which were never built). As the only other town planned by Light, Gawler is dissimilar to Adelaide's one square mile (2.6 km¬≤) grid; the heart of Gawler is triangular rather than square, a form dictated by the topographical features. The parkland along the riverbanks and a Victorian preference for public squares are present, but Light was aware that he was planning a village, not a metropolis. Modern-day Murray Street in Gawler, 2018 Gawler prospered early with the discovery of copper nearby at Kapunda and Burra, which resulted in Gawler becoming a resting stop to and from Adelaide. Later, it developed industries including flour milling by Hilfers & Co, and the engineering works of James Martin & Co manufactured agricultural machinery, mining and ore- processing machinery and smelters for the mines of Broken Hill and the Western Australian goldfields, and steam locomotives and rolling stock. May Brothers & Co. also manufactured mining and agricultural machinery.Australasian Institute of Mining Engineers visit to Gawler South Australian Chronicle, 15 April 1893. Pp 7-8. Accessed 17 April 2015. With prosperity came a modest cultural flowering, (\\"The colonial Athens\\" was its nickname in the late 19th and early 20th centuriesNew Council Chambers, Gawler South Australian Register 18 April 1878 p.6 accessed 10 March 2011), the high point of which was the holding of a competition to compose an anthem for Australia in 1859, four decades before nationhood. The result was the Song Of Australia, written by Caroline Carleton to music by Carl Linger. This became, in the next century, a candidate in a national referendum to choose a new National Anthem for Australia to replace God Save the Queen. Gawler had a horse street tram service from 1879 to 1931.Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, August/September 1950 pp55-56/75-76 Culture Gawler is a commercial centre for the Mid-North districts of South Australia. Gawler regularly hosts stages of the annual cycling race, the Tour Down Under. The annual show was established in 1856 and is South Australia's largest country show. Show attendances regularly attract an estimated 30,000 people over the weekend.http://www.gawler.nowandthen.net.au/Gawler_Show_Society Transport Gawler is just over forty kilometres north of Adelaide city centre along Main North Road. Main North Road was the historic road to the Mid North region of South Australia. North of Gawler, the road is now known as the Horrocks Highway. The Sturt Highway runs northeast from the north side of Gawler, leading to Nuriootpa, the Riverland, Mildura and Sydney. The Barossa Valley Way runs east from the centre of Gawler into the Barossa Valley, and was the original route of the Sturt Highway. The Thiele Highway leads north between the Horrocks and Sturt Highways to Freeling, Kapunda and Morgan. The Northern Expressway is a new highway to the southwest providing a bypass of Gawler as part of the North‚ÄìSouth Corridor, Adelaide which will eventually provide a non-stop road from south of Adelaide to Nuriootpa. Gawler railway station was the terminus of the railway from Adelaide from 1857. The railway was extended to Kapunda in 1860. Gawler became a junction station when a branch was constructed into the Barossa Valley in 1911. This is the line that provides the Gawler Oval and Gawler Central (originally named North Gawler) railway stations in Gawler. Gawler Central is now the terminus of the metropolitan rail services from Adelaide. Horse Tram crossing the bridge in Gawler Gawler's horse-drawn tram service opened in 1879. It operated for both goods and passengers from the railway station along what is now Nineteenth Street (then known as part of Murray Street) and Murray Street (the town's main street) to a terminus near where the Gawler Central station is now. It passed the James Martin & Co engineering factory, providing a convenient way to deliver heavy equipment such as locomotives manufactured there. Broad gauge locomotives were taken directly on the tramway, narrow gauge were transported on specially- built flat-bed trucks. There were also sidings at May Brothers and Company, Roedigers, and Dowson's Mill. The tram closed in 1931 replaced by a bus, and the tracks lifted soon after.Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, August/September 1950 pp55-56/75-76 The tram route is now part of Adelaide Metro bus route number 491.

The centre is located adjacent to St Enoch Square. The Architects were the GMW Architects. The construction, undertaken by Sir Robert McAlpine,Sir Robert McAlpine Project Archive began in 1986, and the building was opened to the public on 25 May 1989.http://www.st-enoch.com/about/history/ It was officially opened by the then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in February of the following year.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATDWY3jTCz0 Located on the site of the former St Enoch Station, the building is just off Glasgow's famous shopping thoroughfare, Argyle Street and overlooks the historic St. Enoch Square and the original Subway station building. The present St Enoch subway station is accessible by escalators. Whilst the target of many architectural critics, the building is notable for its massive glass roof, which makes it the largest glass-covered enclosed area in Europe. Not only does this substantially reduce heating and lighting loads ‚Äì the mall area is lit entirely by natural daylight in summer, whilst the solar heat generated by the roof means that mechanical heating is only required for a week on average per year ‚Äì it also earned the building its affectionate nickname \\"The Glasgow Greenhouse\\". The roof's steel framework was fabricated by the shipbuilders Scott Lithgow. The glass roofed element surrounds a seven-storey car park, and when originally opened, an ice rink. This was closed in 1999 when a refurbishment programme (initiated to compete with the newer Buchanan Galleries complex), saw it being replaced by more shops and an enlarged restaurant area. Shopping Since its opening, St Enoch's anchor tenants were British Home Stores on the eastern end of the complex, and Boots on the western end adjacent to St Enoch square. Although not part of the mall, there is a link bridge over Osbourne Street to the Debenhams department store on the north side of the building ‚Äì this was originally the historic Lewis's store on Argyle Street which itself had undergone a major renovation prior to St Enoch's opening. Photographs Refurbishment The mall has undergone two major refurbishments. Between 2000 and 2001 the ice rink was closed, and converted into an extended food court, and the second floor above the food court area was converted into an entertainment stage. The Argyle Street exit was demolished and rebuilt with an extended mezzanine level housing a TK Maxx store (now closed), and additional shop units with new escalators to serve them. There were other minor updates - the balustrades and handrails were replaced, and the spiral staircase in the centre of the main mall was removed, whilst the hanging wall gardens on the car park exterior walls were replaced by projection screens. In 2008, a ¬£100 million refurbishment began that was expected to be complete by the end of 2009, but was eventually completed in mid-2010. This refurbishment expanded the floor area to and it added a new entrance at the corner of Argyle Street and Buchanan Street, whilst the Argyle Street entrance built in 2000 was demolished for a second time to make way for a new facade, resulting in the closure of the TK Maxx store. In line with the extensions, the original 1980s floor tiling was replaced and the escalators at both ends of the main mall were moved to different locations and renewed. Hamleys,http://www.hamleys.com/Contacting_Other_Stores_+_Hamleys_Toys/M178_CONTACT_OTHER_STORES,default,pg.html G-Star RAW, H&M;, Schuh Kids and Starbucks are some of the few new retail units as part of the refurbishment. Initially, the shopping centre is aiming to tender to a more upmarket niche to compete well with the high street and rival mall Buchanan Galleries. The Tesco Metro store formerly on Argyle Street relocated to the lower ground level of the extension, whilst the TK Maxx store that was displaced from the mall relocated to the vacant Tesco site. St Enoch's Square is also being redeveloped in order to encourage a better public communication. The units overlooking the square will be occupied by food outlets to encourage a new civic space for Glasgow on the square and encourage the public to be able to use the space easily. Debenham's department store have also recently announced that they will be undergoing a renovation as part of the centre's development, including a premier restaurant.Debenhams Glasgow is joining in on the action and undergoing an extensive make-over At the end of 2016 it was confirmed that the former BHS store site would be redeveloped to introduce a multiscreen cinema, alongside new restaurants and retail stores.\\"Glasgow leisure consent granted\\", Shopping Centre, 2016-12-21 Work on the redevelopment began in April 2019, and is due to be completed in summer 2020.

They reportedly taught themselves the craft using the Observer Book of Music. \\"Rubber Band\\" was a marching tune that employed tuba as the lead instrument. \\"Little Bombardier\\" and \\"Maid of Bond Street\\" were in waltz time, and also made extensive use of brass and strings. \\"Love You till Tuesday\\" and \\"Come and Buy My Toys\\" were among the few songs on the album with a lead (acoustic) guitar, the former heavily augmented by strings. \\"Join the Gang\\" was an excursion into contemporary youth culture, an acerbic observation of peer pressure and drug use, which included sitar in its instrumentation as well as a musical quotation of The Spencer Davis Group's recent hit \\"Gimme Some Lovin'.\\" The final track, \\"Please Mr. Gravedigger\\", was \\"a macabre duet for voice and sound effects\\", and has been described as \\"one of pop's genuinely crazy moments\\". Despite the album's incongruity in the Bowie catalogue, some commentators have discerned embryonic themes that inform the artist's more mature work. \\"We Are Hungry Men\\" is told by a self-styled \\"messiah\\" whose persona would reappear in different forms in the songs \\"Cygnet Committee\\" (from the album Space Oddity), \\"Saviour Machine\\" (from The Man Who Sold the World) and \\"Oh! You Pretty Things\\" (from Hunky Dory), as well as in the protagonist of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. The track also explicitly referenced subjects like abortion, infanticide and cannibalism. \\"There Is a Happy Land\\" was an early manifestation of Bowie's vision of children as a race apart from their elders, a theme revisited on The Man Who Sold the World, Hunky Dory and Ziggy Stardust. \\"She's Got Medals\\" was a gender-bending tale with gay and lesbian connotations that predated the 'dress cover' of The Man Who Sold the World and the bisexual/androgynous character of Ziggy Stardust.  Singles  There are three singles associated with David Bowie. Before releasing the album, Deram issued two singles with the same personnel. The first was \\"Rubber Band\\" b/w \\"London Boys\\" in December 1966. Both tracks were recorded in October 1966 and were used to secure Bowie's Deram contract. \\"Rubber Band\\" would be re-recorded for the album (and it is this version that was released as a single in the USA mid-1967 with \\"There Is A Happy Land\\", also from David Bowie, as the B-Side).Nicholas Pegg (2016). The Complete David Bowie: p.230 \\"London Boys\\" has been lauded as Bowie's first mini-masterpiece, a melancholy observation of the London Mod scene of the time.Kris Needs (1983). Bowie: A Celebration: p.15 \\"The Laughing Gnome\\" b/w \\"The Gospel According to Tony Day\\" was the second single released before David Bowie, in April 1967, although neither track features on the album. \\"The Laughing Gnome\\" was a novelty record featuring high-pitched vocals. The varispeed technique used to create this effect would serve Bowie in more serious fashion on many future songs including \\"After All\\", \\"The Bewlay Brothers\\", \\"Fame\\" and \\"Scream Like a Baby\\". Deram re-released the single in the wake of Bowie's commercial breakthrough with The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, and despite it being radically different from his material at the time, it made No. 6 in the UK charts. A month after the release of David Bowie, the third, and what would become the final single of the Deram period, was issued. \\"Love You till Tuesday\\" b/w \\"Did You Ever Have a Dream\\" came out in July 1967. This version of \\"Love You till Tuesday\\", just like the single version of \\"Rubber Band\\" before it, was not the one featured on the album. Rather, Bowie re-recorded the track in June 1967, along with the new song which featured on the B-Side, \\"Did You Ever Have a Dream\\". Just like the two Deram singles before it, \\"Love You till Tuesday\\" failed to chart.Nicholas Pegg (2016). The Complete David Bowie: p.175  Release and response  David Bowie was released in the UK on 1 June 1967. 'Thanks to Deram's progressive leanings,' writes Nicholas Pegg, 'David Bowie was one of the first albums to be released in both mono and stereo, the two variants featuring minor differences in instrumentation and mixing'.Nicholas Pegg (2016). The Complete David Bowie: p.330 Mono editions use slightly different mixes of 'Uncle Arthur' and 'Please Mr. Gravedigger'.Nicholas Pegg (2016). The Complete David Bowie: p.291Nicholas Pegg (2016). The Complete David Bowie: p.212 The album was issued in the USA - again in mono and stereo versions - in August 1967, minus \\"We Are Hungry Men\\" and \\"Maid of Bond Street\\". Pegg speculates 'possibly in line with the US practice of cutting down track numbers to reduce publishing royalties'.Nicholas Pegg (2016). The Complete David Bowie: p.330 The album was a commercial failure, as were its associated singles, \\"Rubber Band\\" and \\"The Laughing Gnome\\" released before it, and \\"Love You till Tuesday\\" released just after it. Bowie went on to record several tracks for Deram, all of which were refused release as singles. In September 1967 Bowie recorded \\"Let Me Sleep Beside You\\" and its B-Side ‚ÄúKarma Man‚Äù. Both tracks had a radically different sound to the material on David Bowie, harking back to his mod period (1964-1966). Despite this, Deram refused to release the single, Pegg seeing this as possibly due to the sexual nature of the title of the A-Side.Nicholas Pegg (2016). The Complete David Bowie: p.157 Bowie quickly proposed swapping the A-Side with a new version of the David Bowie album track, \\"When I Live My Dream\\", which had been re-recorded in the same session as Bowie's third post-album single. Once again Deram refused to release the track, possibly because they felt the sound of this material had failed so many times before.Nicholas Pegg (2016). The Complete David Bowie: p.306 Finally, in early 1968, Bowie recorded another two tracks for release as a single: \\"In the Heat of the Morning\\" and its B-Side \\"London Bye Ta‚ÄìTa\\". While once again going for the pop-mod sound of \\"Let Me Sleep Beside You\\", \\"In the Heat of the Morning\\" was also rejected by Deram. Several of the songs were also re-recorded for BBC Radio Sessions between 1967 and 1969. The failure of the album and its singles, as well as not being able to produce anything with his subsequent material felt worthy of release, cost Bowie his record contract with Deram Records. They dropped him in April 1968. Bowie immediately went on to form a folk rock trio with Hermione Farthingale and Tony Hill. Named Turquoise, the band quickly recorded a single - with all three taking vocal lead on different verses - called \\"Ching-a-Ling\\". Before they could look for a record company to release it, Hill left the band. Recruiting John Hutchinson soon after, the band changed their name to Feathers and had Hutchinson re-record Hill's vocal. Almost immediately Farthingale left Feathers, and soon after, so did Hutchinson. \\"Ching-a-Ling\\" thus became Bowie's fourth single in a row which he had failed to release.Nicholas Pegg (2016). The Complete David Bowie: p.62  Love You till Tuesday  At the same time as the Feathers side-project was on the go, in early 1969 Bowie threw himself into making a promotional film of music videos to sell himself to a new label. Called Love You till Tuesday, the film recycled songs from his debut album and subsequent recordings, as well as featuring reworkings and new material. \\"Rubber Band\\" (album version) and \\"Sell Me a Coat\\" were lifted from David Bowie, although the latter track was overdubbed with new instrumentation and Feathers backing vocals. \\"Love You till Tuesday\\" was the single version, albeit with an early fade removing its \\"Hearts and Flowers\\" coda. From Bowie's period of unreleased singles came \\"When I Live My Dream\\" (single version), \\"Let Me Sleep Beside You\\", and \\"Ching-a-Ling\\" (although with the first verse and Bowie's main vocal omitted from the Feathers track). The film also included a narrated mime, \\"The Mask\\", from another of Bowie's side projects; as well as the song \\"When I'm Five\\" recorded for a BBC Radio session on the program Top Gear in May 1968. Finally, Bowie also - at the last moment - managed to record a brand new song, \\"Space Oddity\\", to complete the film.Nicholas Pegg (2016). The Complete David Bowie: p.636-8 Love You till Tuesday was directed by Malcolm J Thomson, and each segment was filmed in a style appropriate to the song, essentially as a series of music videos. For instance, Bowie dressed as band leader for Rubber Band, performed his mime for The Mask, and appeared floating in darkness for \\"Space Oddity\\". Hutchinson and Farthingale also appeared in some of the sequences, such as \\"Ching-a-Ling\\" and \\"Sell Me a Coat\\". The film was never released at the time, nor indeed needed to secure Bowie a new recording contract. In June 1969 Bowie split with his manager, Kenneth Pitt, and negotiated a deal with Mercury Records and its UK subsidiary Philips based on an audition tape that included a demo of \\"Space Oddity\\" recorded by Bowie and Hutchinson in the spring 1969.Peter & Leni Gillman (1986). Alias David Bowie: a biography: p. 172 Bowie went on to re- record the song as a solo artist later that year, and secure his first hit single. Love You till Tuesday lay all but forgotten until it saw an official public release in 1984 at the height of Bowie's fame during the Let's Dance period.  Reissues and compilations  The songs from the debut album and its singles, plus later Deram works, have been recycled in a multitude of compilation albums, including The World of David Bowie (1970), Images 1966‚Äì1967 (1973), Another Face (1981), Rock Reflections (1990), and The Deram Anthology 1966‚Äì1968 (1997).Nicholas Pegg (2016). The Complete David Bowie: p.330Nicholas Pegg (2016). The Complete David Bowie: p.500-505 The album itself was first re-issued by Deram on CD in 1983 ‚Äì becoming Bowie's first ever album to appear on this format.Nicholas Pegg (2016). The Complete David Bowie: p.328 The album was re-issued on CD for a second time in 1988, with a booklet reprinting the original press release by Kenneth Pitt and a new essay by John Tracy (1988). The rear sleeve specifies the versions of some of the tracks on the album: \\"Rubber Band\\" (Version 2), \\"When I Live My Dream\\" (Version 1), and \\"Please Mr. Gravedigger\\" (Version 2). \\"Rubber Band\\" (Version 2) indicates it is the album version not the earlier single from the previous year. \\"When I Live My Dream\\" (Version 1) similarly indicates the original album version is being used, rather than the later re-recording for the unreleased single. Finally, \\"Please Mr. Gravedigger\\" (Version 2) indicates it is the album version rather than one of the three tracks recorded at \\"Rubber Band\\" single session in late 1966, which only exists on acetate.Nicholas Pegg (2016). The Complete David Bowie: p.211 That is, the 1988 CD version is the stereo version of the original UK issue of the album. This is further clarified as the running times included on the sleave of the CD are the same as the original album, and all three non-album variations of these tracks have significantly different running times.Nicholas Pegg (2016). The Complete David Bowie: p.146 Early in 1968, another two new recordings were similarly rejected: the pairing of \\"In the Heat of the Morning\\" and its B-Side \\"London Bye Ta‚ÄìTa\\". Note, the version of \\"London Bye Ta-Ta\\" here is an earlier mix of the song with an different vocal and without some final touches than what was to be released. The completed mix of the song exists only on a scratchy acetate while the mastertape of the earlier mix has survived, hence its inclusion hereNicholas Pegg (2016).

He played shortstop for the Cincinnati Reds of the Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1986 to 2004. Born and raised in Cincinnati, Larkin attended the University of Michigan, where he played college baseball. He briefly played in the minor leagues before making his MLB debut in 1986. He quickly won the starting shortstop role for the Reds and enjoyed a long run of strong seasons with the team. Larkin struggled with a string of injuries between 1997 and 2003, limiting his playing time in several seasons. Larkin retired after the 2004 season and worked in a front office position for the Washington Nationals for several years until he joined ESPN as a baseball analyst. He served as a coach for the American team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic and managed the Brazilian national team for the same event in 2013. Larkin is considered one of the top players of his era, winning nine Silver Slugger awards, three Gold Glove awards, and the 1995 National League Most Valuable Player Award. He was selected to the Major League All-Star Game twelve times, and was one of the pivotal players on the 1990 Reds' World Series championship team. Larkin was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in January 2012 and was inducted on July 22, 2012. Amateur career Larkin attended Archbishop Moeller High School in Cincinnati. Larkin accepted a football scholarship to the University of Michigan to play for coach Bo Schembechler, but during his freshman year, he decided to play baseball exclusively. He was a two-time All-American and led the Wolverines to berths in two College World Series, in 1983 and 1984 (the last time until 2019). Larkin was also named Big Ten Player of the Year in 1984 and 1985. Larkin's number 16 was retired by the school on May 1, 2010. Minor league career Barry Larkin played with the Vermont Reds on their team that won the 1985 Eastern League Championship and in 1986 was the Rookie of the Year and AAA Player of the Year with the Denver Zephyrs. In all, he played only 177 minor league games in his professional career. MLB career =Early career= Larkin playing in Riverfront Stadium in 1990 After arriving in the majors, Larkin battled fellow prospect Kurt Stillwell for the starting shortstop spot before establishing himself as the starter in 1987. In 1988, Larkin led all major leaguers by striking out only 24 times in 588 at bats. Larkin batted .353 in the 1990 World Series to help lead the Reds to a four-game sweep of the Oakland Athletics. On June 27‚Äì28, 1991, Larkin became the first shortstop ever to hit five home runs in the span of two consecutive games. He earned his fourth consecutive All-Star Game selection that season. After the 1991 season, Larkin questioned whether the Reds had a commitment to winning. He said he was likely to leave the team when his contract expired the next year, but he was encouraged when the Reds acquired pitchers Tim Belcher and Greg Swindell in the offseason. In January 1992, the Reds signed him to a five-year, $25.6 million contract. At that time, only four players had larger contracts and Larkin was the highest-paid shortstop. Larkin was not selected as an All-Star in 1992, but he won his fifth consecutive Silver Slugger Award. In 1993, he won the Roberto Clemente Award, which recognizes players who display sportsmanship, community service and on-field ability. In 1995, Larkin finished sixth in batting (.319) and second in stolen bases (51) to win the National League's MVP award, the first by a shortstop since Maury Wills in 1962. He led the Reds to a central division title and the 1995 National League Championship Series, where he batted .389 during the series loss to the eventual champion Atlanta Braves. In 1996, Larkin hit a career-high 33 home runs and stole 36 bases, becoming the first shortstop in Major League history to join the 30‚Äì30 club. He arguably had a better season in 1996 than he had in his MVP year of 1995, as his on-base percentage and slugging percentage were both improved. =Middle career= Larkin was named the Reds' captain before the 1997 season, making him the first player to hold the honor since Dave Concepci√≥n's retirement. Beginning that season, Larkin suffered a series of injuries throughout the last few years of his career. He missed 55 games that year due to injuries to his calf and his Achilles tendon. About three weeks before the opening of the 1998 season, Larkin decided to undergo neck surgery for a perforated disk. He was not in severe pain, but he was unable to lift his arm enough to play his defensive position. On September 27, 1998, Barry, his brother Stephen Larkin, second baseman Bret Boone, and third baseman Aaron Boone all played the infield at the same time for the last game of the 1998 season, making it the first time in MLB history that two sets of siblings were on the field at the same time. In 1999, Larkin was nearly traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers. He later said that he was approached by a Los Angeles clubhouse attendant, who gave him a Dodgers jersey with his name on it. The jersey had been prepared as trade negotiations advanced so that the teams could be prepared for a trade-related press conference. Also in 1999, Larkin served as a pre-game analyst for NBC's coverage of the World Series alongside host Hannah Storm. In July 2000, Larkin blocked a trade to the New York Mets to remain with the Reds. The trade would have sent three players ‚Äì top minor league outfielder Alex Escobar, pitcher Eric Cammack and pitcher Jason Saenz ‚Äì from the Mets to the Reds in exchange for Larkin. Larkin said that he would have gone to New York, as he enjoyed playing there, but the Mets did not want to sign him to a multi-year contract. The Reds signed him to a three-year contract extension worth $27 million. In the 2000 season, Larkin missed 59 games after he injured his finger twice and he suffered a knee sprain. He underwent finger surgery in April and knee surgery in September. =Later career= Larkin in 2004 Larkin struggled with a groin injury in 2001, prompting criticism of his play. Broadcaster Joe Nuxhall said on air that Larkin had \\"lost it\\". By August, the injury had limited Larkin to 45 games. He underwent season-ending surgery for a hernia that had been diagnosed during an evaluation of the groin injury. During the 2002 season, Larkin played in 145 games but hit for the lowest batting average (.245) since his first full year in the major leagues. Though he did not miss many games, Larkin dealt with injuries to his rib cage, hamstring, shoulder, neck and toe. In 2003, Larkin had spent two stints on the disabled list with calf injuries by late May. During strained contract negotiations with Reds COO John Allen in late 2003, Larkin almost left the team. Larkin and the Reds agreed to a one-year contract for 2004. Larkin called off a planned retirement ceremony scheduled for October 2, 2004, because he was not sure if he would retire. In that season, Larkin hit for a .289 batting average. He announced his retirement in February 2005. Commenting on Larkin's retirement after such a strong season, sports columnist Terence Moore drew a comparison to the retirement of Ted Williams. He wrote, \\"Barry Larkin wasn't quite Williams at the end, but he was in the vicinity when it comes to the big picture... After years of injuries, he showed what a healthy Larkin still could do, but he also showed that he preferred to leave the game more like Williams than just about anybody else you can name in baseball history.\\" In his 19-year career with Cincinnati, Larkin hit .295 with 2,340 hits, 198 home runs, 960 RBI, 1,329 runs scored and 379 stolen bases. Baseball historian and expert Bill James has called Larkin one of the greatest shortstops of all time, ranking him #6 all time in his New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract. Despite missing significant playing time in six seasons, Larkin won the Gold Glove Award three times (1994‚Äì1996) and was a 12-time All-Star (1988‚Äì1991, 1993‚Äì1997, 1999, 2000, and 2004). He became the first major league shortstop to join the 30‚Äì30 club when he had 33 home runs and 36 stolen bases in 1996. Post-retirement After his retirement, Larkin was hired as a special assistant to the general manager in the Washington Nationals organization. With the Nationals, he worked under former Reds general manager Jim Bowden. Larkin had hoped to work for the Reds, but USA Today reported that his 2003 contract disagreement with Allen eliminated that opportunity. In 2008, he signed with the MLB Network as a studio analyst. He was the bench coach for the United States at the 2009 World Baseball Classic and managed the United States' second-round game against Puerto Rico when U.S. manager Davey Johnson left to attend his stepson's wedding.Barry Larkin to Manange US Team SI.com, March 13, 2009 On July 20, 2008, the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and Museum inducted Larkin, C√©sar Ger√≥nimo, August \\"Garry\\" Herrmann, and Joey Jay. The induction was held at the Duke Energy Center in downtown Cincinnati. On Tuesday, March 24, 2009, the College Baseball Foundation announced the names of the ten players and coaches comprising the 2009 National College Baseball Hall of Fame Induction Class, which included Barry Larkin. Larkin at the 2013 Baseball Hall of Fame induction parade In 2011, Larkin left Washington for ESPN to serve as a Baseball Tonight analyst. Larkin received great applause from Reds fans when he helped host Baseball Tonight's on-the-road coverage of Sunday Night Baseball at GABP on July 24, 2011. Crowd chants of \\"Barry Larkin\\" and \\"Hall of Fame\\" often caused the anchors to have to talk very loud to be heard. Larkin was coincidentally in Cincinnati for Baseball Tonight on the day of the 2011 Hall of Fame induction ceremonies. In 2012, Larkin was voted into the Hall of Fame with 86.4% of the vote. He was the eighth Reds player and 24th shortstop inducted to the Hall of Fame. On August 25, 2012, his number 11 was retired in an official ceremony at Great American Ball Park.\\"Reds to honor Barry Larkin, retire No. 11 jersey\\", Associated Press. USA Today. August 7, 2012. Retrieved August 25, 2012. In 2010, his first year of eligibility for the Hall of Fame, Larkin had received 51.6% of the vote (75 percent is needed for election). In 2011, he received 62.1% of the vote, the highest of non-inducted players and third overall. He was invited by the Brazilian Baseball Federation to manage their national team in the qualifiers for the 2013 World Baseball Classic. Brazil beat host country Panama in Brazil's first time to qualify for the event. They were originally scheduled to play in Puerto Rico, but because of the huge Japanese baseball influence in Brazil, they played in Japan. The team played Cuba and China besides the home country. \\"Barry Larkin hired by Brazil for WBC\\". Associated Press. ESPN.com. September 19, 2012.\\"Larkin excited about managing Brazil in Classic\\", Barry M. Bloom. MLB.com. January 25, 2013. The team went winless in its WBC debut and was eliminated after the first round. Larkin built the Champions Sports Complex to use sports in the social, emotional, and educational development of youth. In 2008, Larkin released a charity wine called \\"Barry Larkin's Merlot\\", with 100% of its proceeds supporting Champions Sports Foundation. In November 2013, Detroit Tigers general manager Dave Dombrowski confirmed that the organization had intended to interview Larkin for its open managerial position. Larkin declined the interview due to the time commitment associated with the job. Brad Ausmus was named the new Tigers manager on November 3, 2013. In November 2014, the Tampa Bay Times reported that Larkin was among 10 candidates interviewed for the Tampa Bay Rays' managerial job. Larkin was not among the team's three finalists, and the job ultimately went to Kevin Cash. Larkin joined the Cincinnati Reds as a minor-league roving infield instructor in May 2015. He helped out the big-league club during spring training 2016. When asked whether he hoped to manage in the future, he said, \\"Never say never. The conditions have to be right and, you know, the manager's job, at least in my opinion, is not about just having the manager's position. It's about having the support system to support that manager's position.\\"  Sports diplomacy  Larkin has also been an active participant in the SportsUnited Sports Envoy program for the U.S. Department of State. In this function, he has traveled to Colombia, Ecuador, India, Lithuania, Taiwan, where he worked with to conduct baseball clinics and events that reached more than 2,200 youth from underserved areas. In so doing, Larkin helped contribute to SportsUnited's mission to reach out to youth populations in order to promote growth and a stable democratic government. Personal life Barry's son, Shane Larkin Larkin's brother, Stephen Larkin, was also a professional baseball player; he made it to the major leagues for one game with the Reds. Another brother, Byron Larkin, was a second-team All-American basketball player at Xavier University and is the color commentator on Xavier basketball radio broadcasts. Larkin's eldest brother, Mike, was a captain of the University of Notre Dame's football team in 1985. Larkin and his wife Lisa have two daughters, Brielle D'Shea and Cymber, and a son, Shane. The family lives in Orlando, Florida. Shane played two seasons at the University of Miami before declaring himself eligible for the 2013 NBA Draft. Shane was subsequently traded to the Dallas Mavericks and made his NBA debut in November 2013. Shane started as a guard for the Boston Celtics in 2017. Larkin's daughters play lacrosse. Brielle D'Shea is named in honor of Shea Stadium, as Larkin enjoyed playing there. In popular culture In 2012, Cincinnati-based delicatessen Izzy's created the \\"Barry Larkin Triple Play\\" sandwich in honor of Larkin.

He was the first prime minister of Norway after the introduction of parliamentarism. Sverdrup was prime minister from 1884 to 1889.  Early years  He was born at Sem in Vestfold, Norway. He was the son of Jacob Liv Borch Sverdrup (1775‚Äì1841) and Gundelle Birgitte Siang (1780‚Äì1820). His father was a pioneer in scientific agriculture in Norway. He finished his law studies in 1841. He worked as a lawyer in Larvik, a small town on the west coast of the Oslofjord. In 1851 he was for the first time elected to the Storting, and from then until his appointment as Prime Minister in 1884, he was one of the leaders of parliament. In Norway, political parties were considered inappropriate and unwanted. Sverdrup tried from his earliest days in the Storting to form a radical party consisting of the large group of peasants and the radical elements among the representatives from the cities. His first attempt was named the \\"lawyers' party\\" after the profession of the leaders of the group. It soon became evident that the times were not ripe for such a radical novelty, and for the next years Sverdrup knit a loose alliance with the peasant leader, Ole Gabriel Ueland (1799‚Äì1870). Sverdrup's ministry  Forming the alliance  In 1870 Ueland died, and the loose leadership of the alliance of peasants went over to S√∏ren Jaab√¶k (1814‚Äì1894), an economically extremely conservative politician, whose views hardly exceeded the most primitive cutting of every part of the budget, even if the money in question would be used to the furthering of democracy and education, two of his most important topics. Such negative policy-making (Jaab√¶k's name was changed by the ministerial adherents and press to Neib√¶k after the Norwegian word nei 'no' contrasting with ja 'yes') would never produce great results, which Sverdrup clearly foresaw. He did not hesitate to acknowledge Jaab√¶k as the formal leader and organizer of this budding party, based on the Bondevenforeninger (peasant friend associations) that Jaab√¶k managed to spread throughout most of the country. However, in parliament Jaab√¶k often bowed to Sverdrup's more advanced political strategies, when they were not too expensive. In 1869 a political reform of the greatest importance was introduced, yearly parliamentary sessions instead of the earlier triannual sessions. This definitely tipped the scale of political influence in favor of the Storting, and it is not easy to see the reasons for the King's acceptance of this reform. The major reason was probably the growing necessity to get updated budgets, which was naturally the Storting's task to provide. During the 1860s, the views towards the ministers' participation in the parliamentary sessions had changed totally. The ministerials, as they were called, were now unanimously against, because they had seen the formation of the peasants' friends as a threat to what they deemed to be the ideal, the totally independent representative. The peasants and the radicals on the other hand, had drawn the obviously correct conclusion that this reform would further the influence of the elected towards the appointed ministers. In 1870, the Storting passed a change in the constitution which granted the ministers admission to Parliament when asked, but the King refused to sanction the law, stating that it was premature so few years after the yearly sessions reform. In 1872 the new king, Oscar II, decided that Norway, in its precarious situation with the Council mostly convening in the capital, Christiania (now Oslo), while the king mostly lived in Sweden's capital Stockholm needed two Prime Ministers, one in each capital. Until then there had only been one in Stockholm, because the Council in Christiania was supposed to be led by an appointed governor, a position which had been vacant for 15 years because no Swedish king had dared or wished to appoint a new governor. This made an extremely minor change in the suggested change in the constitution, when it was passed in 1873, necessary, namely that there were now two Prime Ministers, while there was only one in the previous law text. The changed constitution was not sanctioned this time either. The same happened in 1876 and 1879, and now a major problem had occurred, which made Norwegian politics extremely difficult for several years. The Constitution explicitly stated that the king had a veto three times in law and budget matters, but there was no mention of any kind of veto concerning constitutional matters. This omission gave way to three possibilities: # The king had no veto at all # The king had an absolute veto # The king had the same veto rights as in all other matters The opposition which made up a vast majority, had practically rejected the first possibility and decided upon the third, whereas the Council and the minority of the Storting was certain of the king's absolute veto.  The strife hardens  The strife which had started as a practical political reform had now turned into a political debacle which would have to change the checks and balances between the legislative and the executive branch. This had definitely become Sverdrup's goal. \\"All power must be gathered in the halls of the Storting\\" became his political program. In 1879 his party in the making made a coup by promulgating the new change in the constitution. This took the Council by surprise that the grand old man of the Council, Prime Minister Frederik Stang, resigned. The new Prime Minister, Christian Selmer, was not such a leader and force in the Council, and Sverdrup was ready for the next move, which should constitutionally have been taken in 1881. But Sverdrup's majority was not great enough to be certain of a victory in the forthcoming impeachment of the Council. In the 1882 general elections Sverdrup's party won a convincing majority. They were able to fill the 25% of the Storting who were, together with the Supreme Court, the judges of the court, with only members of the leftist party in formation. Venstre (from the Norwegian word for left) was Sverdrup's and Jaab√¶k's liberal and radical party but definitely a party with no socialist affiliations. H√∏yre (from the Norwegian word for 'right') was the Council's and the minority party which was considered to be conservative. Engraving by H. P. Hansen Sverdrup's wife, Caroline In the fall 1883 the judges convened, and the trials took several months and resulted in loss of position without honor for most of the ministers and huge fines. The king appointed a new Council led by Christian Schweigaard, but was a rather lame move, since Sverdrup immediately threatened with a new impeachment trial. The new Council was named the April Ministry, which says something about how long the king's struggle to find a solution to the total crisis that had occurred, which he could deem acceptable. It turned out there was no other choice than to appoint Johan Sverdrup as Prime Minister. In Norwegian tradition the transition from Montesquieu's ideal of checks and balances to a parliamentary system took place when he became Prime Minister. There is evidence that Sverdrup himself never really understood the consequences of a parliamentary system. Hence his five years in power with a vast majority in support, was no triumph march, but a row of defeats in Parliament. It is not far from a personal tragedy, and his resignation in 1889 was the only possible finale to a rather unworthy drama that took place within the Venstre.  Sverdrup's government  It turned out from the first day that Sverdrup as a Prime Minister was not the competent strategist that most Norwegians had either learned to fear or admire. He expected his adherents to follow him as they had done for almost 30 years. It also turns out that Venstre was a more loosely knit coalition than Sverdrup and the other leaders had expected. The fight against the powerful executive branch had created alliances that broke very quickly afterwards. Sverdrup and all his ministers belonged to the conservative faction of the party. They had strong support what the leading Norwegian sociologist, Stein Rokkan, labeled the periphery, adherents of lay Christianity in opposition to the clergy, adherents of the so-called New Norwegian in opposition to the Norwegian spoken in the cities, adherents of totalitarianism. His great mistake was to refuse to include anyone from the radical faction and to further alienate them by not accepting their advice in any of the difficult political situations that arose in those years. In the 1885 general election the party's slogan was \\"Have confidence in Johan Sverdrup\\" which later has been deemed one of the most ridiculous slogans ever created. A party without ability to find anything to unite about will have no long life, and the breach in the party became evident throughout the three years before the next general elections. Sverdrup and his colleagues and diminishing group in the Storting were more or less expelled from the party and had to start their own Venstre. The original party, now led by Sverdrup's leading opponents, Ullmann and Steen, voted against him and mocked the elder statesman for clinging to the \\"Chair\\", but he was saved by H√∏yre which had no intentions to diminish the strife within the Venstre, and believed that their best hope was to leave the Sverdrup ministry in peace until the general elections in 1888. After those elections, which proved fully that H√∏yre strategy had been a sound one, Sverdrup's ministry was quickly ousted.  Father of Parliamentarism  The views towards this controversial political leader will differ greatly with the political and historical affiliation of those expressing a view. It can not be denied that Sverdrup was an extremely skilled and able opposition leader and strategist whose influence of domestic politics was enormous for about 30 years. What can be said against such a viewpoint, is that most of the results of his opposition was destructive because he sold his radical and social liberal political views in order to gain influence in Jaab√¶k's loosely knit alliance of peasants. On the other hand one tends to forget that there was a class struggle between the peasants and the public servant and tradesmen classes, which in Norway with no nobility, were the most influential, and that Sverdrup, a public servant, joined the vast and less influential group of peasants in order to transform the society. His weakness was his inability to bury hatchets and his apparent lack of flexibility in older age. His inability to understand the concept of parliamentarism, which seemed to be the ultimate goal of his policies. His clinging to the symbols of power can be ascribed to his age, but he was only about 70. Most historians would conclude that his fight against the king's appointed Council lasted too long. He was too old to harvest the fruits, but he paved the way for a new political situation in Norway.

History The Democracy Movement was founded in 1998 through a merger of the Referendum Movement, a cross-party successor group to Sir James Goldsmith's Referendum Party, and the Euro Information Campaign set up by Yorkshire businessman Paul Sykes. Sir James's widow, Lady Annabel Goldsmith became its president and Sykes became its chairman until he stepped down in 2000 on re-joining the Conservative Party. Lady Annabel's son, the businessman Robin Birley, took over as the organisation's chairman, serving until 2004. The Democracy Movement originated from the ideas and 1997 general election campaign of the Referendum Party. At its launch, describing the campaign as an effort \\"in memory of Jimmy\\", Lady Annabel said: > I'm not anti-European - my husband was half European and my children are a > quarter French. I just don't want to be governed by Brussels, and I don't > think people want to give up their sovereignty. Jimmy used to describe it as > sitting at the top of the mountain watching a train crash - that was like us > heading for the European superstate. The DM is funded by donations from grassroots supporters, although the Goldsmith family and Paul Sykes made large campaign donations during its early years. Policy positions The Democracy Movement campaigns on a number of eurosceptic issues such as opposing Britain entering Economic and Monetary Union or the Eurozone and has also campaigned against the EU Constitution and the Lisbon Treaty. Its opposition to the euro is on the grounds that the British government would lose economic control over interest rates, exchange rates and spending on public services and also that the public would lose democratic control if such economic decisions were passed to EU institutions. On the EU Constitution the Democracy Movement claimed that far from being a 'tidying up exercise' of existing treaties and powers as the government portrayed, the Constitution represented a fundamental change in the nature of the EU and a significant increase in the centralisation of decision-making power in Brussels. The Movement campaigned for a national referendum on the EU Constitution, which in April 2004 the then Prime Minister Tony Blair conceded. However, following the rejection of the Constitution by similar referendums in France in May 2005 and the Netherlands in June 2005, the UK vote was postponed indefinitely. In its subsequent Vision Europe campaign, the Democracy Movement called for the dismantling of the EU and its replacement with a new flexible and voluntary form of co-operation between European governments, called the 'Europe of Democracies'. The campaign proposed that powers should be decentralised from Brussels back to elected national parliaments whose laws would resume legal precedence. Trade would be facilitated between countries within Europe and across the world, and an internationalist outlook would be developed. It was also proposed that billions of pounds from the EU budget should be re-distributed to the peoples of Europe. When the EU Constitution was superseded by the Treaty of Lisbon and the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee declared the treaty to be \\"substantially equivalent\\" to the earlier EU Constitution, the Democracy Movement launched a campaign for the government's pledge of a referendum to be honoured. The Movement set up a ReferendumList website, listing MPs' views on a referendum and launched a leafleting campaign in more than 130 marginal constituencies of anti- referendum MPs. The leaflets were personalised to the sitting MP in each seat and accused them of taking the public for \\"fools\\" in claiming that the Lisbon Treaty was sufficiently different to the EU Constitution that the referendum was no longer justified. In March 2008, MPs voted against a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty by a narrow margin of 63 votes. Thirteen Liberal Democrat MPs rebelled against the party's orders to abstain on the referendum vote, with three party spokesmen resigning their posts, and 29 Labour MPs also rebelled against their government's opposition to a referendum. In October 2008 the Democracy Movement was invited to conduct the 'No' campaign in a mini- referendum on the Lisbon Treaty and on EU membership held in the town of Luton, organised and later televised by the ITV Tonight programme. During the campaign the Movement highlighted the net cost of EU membership, argued that the EU had a role in local post office closures and said that the Lisbon Treaty would centralise even more important decisions in unelected Brussels institutions. A leaflet entitled Break Free from the outdated EU was distributed, setting out what the DM called a \\"better way\\" of trade and co- operation between European countries being perfectly possible without having to pass ever more decisions to remote EU institutions. The Democracy Movement won the referendum, with 63 per cent of respondents voting against the Lisbon Treaty and 27 per cent for it, while 54 per cent voted against EU membership and 35 per cent in favour. In 2011 the Democracy Movement continued its drive for an EU referendum as a founding supporter of the cross-party People's Pledge campaign for an in-out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. A referendum took place on 23 June 2016, with almost 52% of the voters voting to leave the EU. Activism The Democracy Movement played the major grassroots role in the campaign to 'keep the pound', from launch quickly establishing a large crossparty network of supporters and branches ready to campaign against euro membership in the referendum that was then promised. Its then chairman Paul Sykes pledged to spend ¬£20 million on the campaign and the Movement claimed to be distributing \\"millions\\" of pro-pound leaflets through a series of 'Democracy Days' of national, concerted action by its branches. On 12 January 2001, the DM launched an advertising and leafleting campaign, worth around ¬£500,000, to expose the parliamentary votes of pro-Brussels candidates before the May general elections. The organisation published two million pamphlets that carried provocative headlines about the 'horrors of a European state' and published full page local newspaper advertisements in the constituencies of politicians in 120 \\"target\\" seats. Reflecting the dominant Labour government of the time, these included 70 Labour MPs, 35 Liberal Democrats, six Conservatives and three Scottish National Party candidates. The Movement's 2008 campaign for a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty asked supporters to write to their MPs and submit the responses they received to a \\"ReferendumList\\" website, highlighting MPs' views. Further aiming to 'name and shame' anti-referendum MPs, this was accompanied by a leafleting campaign involving the distribution of 10,000 leaflets in each of more than 130 marginal constituencies where the MP opposed an EU referendum. The DM has published a quarterly magazine, These Tides, in support of eurosceptic pressure groups across the continent. Its stated aim is to \\"keep the international family of activists working for the post-EU Europe\\". Contributors have included Norman Tebbit, Tony Benn, Gisela Stuart and John Redwood.

Founded in 1952, it supplies mostly handmade bicycles for the road, track, E-bikes(NYTRO), mountain bikes and cyclo-cross. The company also produces bicycles under the Opera brand name, and has an in-house component brand ‚Äì MOST. In December 2016, the company was acquired by L Catterton, a private equity group associated with Louis Vuitton Mo√´t Hennessy SE, better known as LVMH. History Giovanni Pinarello was born in Catena di Villorba, Italy in 1922. He was the eighth of 12 brothers. At the age of 15, Giovanni began making bicycles at the factory of Paglianti. After a successful amateur career he turned professional in 1947, aged 25. Pinarello died on 4 September 2014. Historical Models Pinarello Montello with Campagnolo 50th Groupset The Pinarello Montello SLX was a landmark model for Pinarello as this was the frame with which Pinarello achieved their first major pro victories. This model frame was one of the most responsive of the mid to late 1980s as shown by wins in events such as the 1984 Summer Olympics Road Race, Vuelta a Espa√±a, the Giro d'Italia and stages of the Tour de France. The Montello had a brake cable through the top tube, chrome sloping front fork and chrome on the drive side chain stay; later models had the full rear triangle chromed. The Montello SLX was in red, blue and Spumoni.GITA Sporting Goods, Pinarello Catalogue #65 Pinarellos from the mid-1980s often have the decals restored by owners as factory-applied decals where prone to flaking off. The Montello was fabricated from Columbus SLX butted tubing with rifling down the inside center. The bottom bracket was investment cast with the Pinarello logo and the dropouts were by Campagnolo. Braze-ons for down-tube shifters, front derailleur and two water bottles were provided. The GPT logo (for Giovanni Pinarello, Treviso) appeared in many locations. The Pinarello Treviso was the second-in-line model under the Montello SLX in the mid-to-late '80's. Built with Columbus SL tubing, it featured a painted fork and seat stays, with chromed chain stays. This model also featured the sloping fork crown. On the road it is easily distinguished from the Montello by the single chrome chain stay. However, some older models of the Treviso (1981) did not have the chrome chain stay. After the Montello SLX, Pinarello departed from his standard production design with parallel seat and head tube angles and created the Gavia. This provided more saddle setback than the Montello or other Pinarello designs. Greg LeMond, the winner of the Tour de France in 1986, 1989 and 1990, promoted designs that pushed the saddle further back.Lemond G, Gordis K. \\"Greg LeMond's Complete Book of Bicycling\\" New York, Perigee Books,1990 The Gavia was constructed of Columbus TSX tubing. This model was available in red, blue with pearl white panels and pearl white with fluorescent splatter. Jan Ullrich's 1997 Tour de France winning Paris FP The Pinarello Paris in the mid-1990s was a 7005 series aluminium bike with an aluminium fork later replaced by the aria carbon fork. It was upon this frame that Jan Ullrich and Bjarne Riis won the Tour de France. Winner of the 2007 Editor's Choice award for a road racing bicycle from Bicycling Magazine, the Pinarello Paris FP is the premier monocoque, high modulus, unidirectional carbon fiber frame. In 2009, the FP6 replaced the Paris FP and F4:13. The monocoque frame uses the same mold as the Paris FP, but with different carbon fiber (30HM3K). Pinarello has been slow to jump aboard the all-carbon juggernaut, preferring to concentrate on its highly regarded magnesium-frame technology as showcased in the Dogma series of bikes. But the attraction and momentum of carbon is unavoidable, and while the all- carbon F4:13 hasn't displaced the Dogma at the top of Pinarello's line-up, it is clearly a serious and purposeful attempt to use the material's properties to best advantage, starting with one-piece main frame construction to exploit carbon's stiffness and low weight. Contemporary road models The Pinarello FP Uno was the current base model bicycle built by Pinarello evolving from its predecessor, the FP1. The FP Uno features hydroformed asymmetric 6061 T6 triple butted aluminium tubing. The next superior model is the Pinarello FP Due. Like the FP Uno, this has evolved from its predecessor, the FP2. The frame is constructed from 24HM12K carbon fibre. The Pinarello FP Quattro is built from 30HM12K carbon fibre and features carbon asymmetric stays with Onda carbon forks. The Quattro also utilises the new iCR internal cable routing system, which has been developed in house, by Pinarello. The Pinarello Neor replaced the FP Uno as Pinarellos base road bike model, featuring the same hydroformed aluminum frame as the FP Uno, but now boasts a carbon fibre rear triangle as well as ONDA carbon front forks. The Pinarello FPTEAM Carbon is constructed from 24HM12K uni-directional carbon fibre and features both tapered 1 \\"1/8 1\\" 1/4 ONDA front forks and ONDA rear triangles. The Pinarello Rahza is a full 24HM12K carbon fibre frame, featuring an asymmetrical monocoque design which improved frame rigidity. The frame also features ONDA forks and rear stays as well as the BB30 bottom bracket. The Pinarello Marvel is an entirely new asymmetry frame originating from the Pinarello Paris (constructed from Torayca 50HM1.5 carbon fibre) made from 30HM12K carbon. Rigidity of the frame is further improved by the usage of a tapered headset (1\\" 1/8 - 1\\" 1/2) as well as featuring internal cable routing. Pinarello say that the Marvel is \\"top level bike and already UCI approved for use in official competitions.\\" The Marvel also makes full use of the Think2 system allowing the usage of both electronic and mechanical groupsets. Other new features include the new ONDA2V front fork and a new aerodynamic downtube. =GAN Series= For 2016 Pinarello updated their product line starting with new mid-level bikes up to models just below the Dogma Series. All GAN Series models take styling and design cues from the Dogma F8. The entry level GAN stems directly from the design efforts of the Dogma F8, whilst having a less 'extreme' style which aids riding comfort. The GAN Disk variant contains the same features as the GAN but also includes disk brakes, both models are manufactured from T600 carbon fibre. The GAN S features an all T700 carbon fibre frame, whilst still maintaining design features akin to the F8. The top of the class model is the GAN RS which features a higher strength T900 Toray carbon. =Dogma Series= Bradley Wiggins's Dogma2 he rode at the 2012 Volta ao Algarve The Pinarello Dogma was the first of the current top line of bicycle made by the company and was the first bicycle of a 'new generation' of frames, it is the successor to the Pinarello Prince range and was released for sale to the public in 2010. The frames focus around a completely asymmetric design made entirely of 60HM1K carbon fibre, with the right hand side of the Dogma frame is different in shape and section to that of the left side, thus providing increased rigidity against forces placed upon the frame by the action of pedalling. In 2011 the successor the Dogma, the Pinarello Dogma 2 was revealed at the 2011 Tour de France. The Dogma 2 featured aerodynamic improvements which increased the efficiency of the frame. Bradley Wiggins rode the Dogma 2 to victory in the 2012 Tour de France. In 2012, mountain bike trials rider, Martyn Ashton, created a video in which he performed several tricks and stunts on a Dogma 2. The video, entitled \\"Road Bike Party\\", went viral, gaining over half a million views in one day, and it currently has over eight million views on YouTube. The Pinarello Dogma K features Pinarellos 'Century Ride' geometry and uses frame design that provides increased comfort without compromising the overall performance. As with other modern Pinarellos, the frame incorporates an asymmetric design which offsets the asymmetric forces created during the pedalling. The Dogma K and the Dogma frame differ from each other in the angle of the seat tube, brought back to increase shock absorption, and reduced head tube angle as well as slightly longer chain stays to increase comfort. Furthermore, a longer wheelbase makes for a frame that is less rigid vertically, improving shock absorption. The Pinarello ROKH is a frame that was made in an effort to offer the excellent performance of the DOGMA K to a wider group of cyclists. The ROKH's geometry is similar in shape and construction but with an even longer wheel base to add even more vertical compliance than the Dogma K. The Dogma K Hydro mirrors the new model variation seen with the Dogma 65.1, whereby hydraulic disc brakes have now been added. The Hydro features new ONDA HD (Hydraulic Disc) forks, as well as new chainstays accommodating the RAD braking system seen on both the DOGMA XC and Dogma 65.1 Hydro. Nairo Quintana on his Dogma 65.1 Think2 at the 2013 Paris‚ÄìNice The 2013 generation of the Dogma bicycle is the Dogma 65.1 Think2. When compared to the Dogma2, the Think2 features stronger and more rigid carbon fibre, 65HM1K, yielding a more reactive frame. Moreover, the Think2 has been built with the new electronic shifting group sets in mind, and thus has internal cable routing for both Shimano and Campagnolo systems. The 2014 Dogma 65.1 Hydro variant of the Dogma is virtually the same as the 2013 Think2 model, made from Torayca 65Ton HM 1K carbon fibre with \\"Nanoalloy technology\\". The Hydro however, accommodates hydraulic disc brakes and features a new front fork developed from the previous ONDA2 fork, called the ONDA HD (Hydraulic Disk). The frame also features new chainstays which accommodate the new RAD braking system, derived from the development of the Dogma XC. Chris Froome rode the Dogma 65.1 Think2 to victory in the 2013 Tour de France. Dogma F8 with Shimano Dura Ace Di2 and Enve 6.7 Wheelset In May 2014 the Pinarello Dogma F8 was revealed as part of Pinarellos 2015 product launch, with the name deriving from this particular Dogma model being the 8th generation. The new bike was developed in conjunction with Team Sky sponsor and car manufacturer Jaguar and takes design cues (such as the front fork shape) from the Bolide time trial bike. Research advancements have led to claimed aerodynamic gains, with the F8 being 26.1% more aerodynamic than the Dogma 65.1, 6.4% more aerodynamic when including the bike rider and the frameset alone being 40% more aerodynamically efficient than the predecessor. The bike is expected to debut at the 2014 Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©. In April 2015, just days ahead of the Tour of Flanders Pinarello, along with Jaguar-Land Rover and , unveiled the Dogma K8-S ‚Äì a replacement for the cobble-focused Dogma K. The most striking aspect of the new bike is the rear suspension system, dubbed the Dogma Suspension System, which can provide up to 10mm of travel; this however, is not the first time road bikes have been fitted with suspension. The bike was designed in conjunction with Jaguar and features the aerodynamic fork from the Dogma F8, which in conjunction with the suspension system is claimed to reduce vibrations by 50%, with data from Jaguar-Land Rover showing an increase in speed of 8% and a reduction in energy usage of 10%. A version of the bike will also be made which does not have the suspension system built in - the Dogma K8. In May 2015, the company launched the Dogma F8 Disk in preparation for the UCI's review on the use of disk brakes in road competitions. The bike is essentially the same as the standard F8 in terms of performance and characteristics. In December 2015, the company launched a limited edition variant of the F8, the Dogma F8w, which uses the wireless SRAM RED eTap groupset. In 2016, just before the 2016 Tour de France the company launched the Dogma F8 Xlight.http://www.pinarello.com/en/bikes-2017/road/dogma-f8-xlight-tdf-2016 In January 2017, the company revealed its new flagship bike, the Dogma F10. Unlike in previous years where Pinarello have timed their new product reveals with the Giro d'Italia, the F10 was revealed before the start of the 2017 season. The team-bikes will be equipped with Shimanos newest 9150 Dura-Ace Di2 groupset, whilst Pinarello claim the F10 is 6.3% lighter and 7% stiffer than its predecessor (still composed of Torayca T1100 1K carbon), whilst a 53 cm unpainted frame has a claimed weight of only 820g. The F10 also has a 12.6% claimed aerodynamic advantage over the F8, coming in part from the 'concave' back shaped aerofoils (also found on the second version of the Bolide time trial bike). The F10 also has a number of aerodynamic devices which have been taken from other models, the aforementioned Bolide, as well as Bradley Wiggins' hour record bike. Only hours after its release, Taiwanese bike manufacturer - Velocite - claimed that new F10 and the second version of the Bolide infringe three of its patents. The F10 will also be available to the public immediately. During the 2017 Giro d'Italia a number of riders tested the Dogma F10 X-Light - a lightweight version of the F10 - in readiness for the 2017 Tour de France. Pinarello claim an unpainted X-Light weighs in at 760g for a 53 cm sized frame.http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/devilish- details-of-chris-froomes-different-tour-de-france-pinarellos/ In mid-July the company announced the Dogma F10 Disc would be produced for sale.http://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/product-news/pinarello-f10-disc-342696 A day later the company revealed the Dogma K10, taking aerodynamic and visual cues from the F10 forebearerhttp://www.cyclingnews.com/news/pinarello- announce-dogma-k10/ and the electronically-controlled suspension variant, the Dogma K10S Disk.http://www.bikeradar.com/road/news/article/pinarello- dogma-k10-and-dogma-k10-s-disk-50422/ In May 2019, the company revealed the successor to the Dogma F10, the Dogma F12 which is launched alongside Team Ineos. Time Trial & Triathlon models The Pinarello Montello FP8 was a time trial bicycle manufactured by Pinarello prior to the introduction of the Graal. It was made with aerospace grade carbon fibre composite. The 50HM3K carbon fibre creates an ultra stiff and light ride. The Pinarello Graal is a time trial frame manufactured by Pinarello. The Graal was designed using CFD techniques, maximizing the efficiency of the bicycle. The frame is available in both an electronic version and mechanical version, with the electronic version featuring an internally mounted battery. The Pinarello Bolide was released on 2 May 2013 with gains of a 15% reduction in aerodynamic drag and 5% reduction in weight over the Graal. Team Sky's 2012 Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins used the new bike at the 2013 Giro d'Italia. The Bolide has been in development for over year with both Pinarello lab technicians and Team Sky working on the bike. The Bolide uses aeroplane wing-shaped tubular sections in conjunction with a 'concave back' on the seat tube. This allows the rear wheel and frame to be closer together. In addition, the brakes are shielded behind leading small fairings and the frame utilizes integrated cabling to further minimize drag. On 21 June 2013 Pinarello released their second (in-house developed) high end time trial frame, called the Pinarello Sibilo. The Sibilo will debut at the 2013 Tour de France with Alejandro Valverde of Movistar Team. Early impressions are that the Sibilo shares some common features with the Bolide, such as; airfoil tubing, track style rear dropouts and a 'concave back'. Moreover, the Sibilo carries some aerodynamic refinements over the Bolide, for example, the front brake is further integrated into the forks and the rear brake has been moved towards the chainstays. These modifications remove the need for the brake fairings which are seen on the Bolide. The Sibilo is constructed from the same Torayca 65HM1K carbon as the Bolide, with internal cable routing for extra aerodynamic benefit. The Sibilo utilizes the stiff BB86 bottom bracket and can also accommodate both mechanical groupsets such as the Shimano Dura-Ace and Campagnolo Super Record sets, as well as their electronic variants (Dura-Ace Di2 and Campagnolo EPS). The Pinarello Xirion is designed specifically for triathletes by utilizing favorable frame geometry and is made from 24HM Unidirectional carbon fibre. The Xirion is sold as a complete bicycle fitted with Vision cycling components. Bradley Wiggins' modified Bolide HR he used for his successful Hour Record attempt In light of Bradley Wiggins' hour record attempt, Pinarello collaborated with Jaguar to produce the Bolide HR. The HR variant has aero-optimised front forks, seat stays and dropouts. The bike also features printed titanium bars. In 2015, the endurance part of the Italian national cycling team received Bolide HR bikes. At the 2016 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, Filippo Ganna rode his Bolide HR to victory in the Individual Pursuit. In May 2016, three years after its initial introduction, the Pinarello Bolide TThttp://www.pinarello.com/en/bikes-2017/crono/bolide-tt-1 was released exclusively to Team Sky. The first race-ready model of the bike will be given to Mikel Landa for use on the Stage 9 time trial at the 2016 Giro d'Italia. MTB & XC models (2012 ‚Äì ) Dogma XC with Shimano XTR The Pinarello Dogma XC 9.9 features the unique-to-Pinarello divided rear triangle and is made from 60HM1K Torayca carbon fibre \\"Nanoalloy\\" technology. Torayca Nanoalloy technology has nano-particles embedded within the carbon fibre weave that Pinarello say explode upon impact, preventing the fiber from breaking or de- laminating. Pinarello calls the unique seat stay design \\"ONDA XC Asymmetric Twin Arms\\" Traditional frames have rear stays directly connected to the toptube, meaning that vibrations originating from the rear triangle are directly transferred all the way up to the handlebars. Therefore, Pinarello developed a system which divided the two main rear triangles, moving one higher than the other. These stays attach to the seat tube above the top tube, at separate points from one another, and they also serve as the seatpost clamp. This system has reduced the amount of shock felt from the rear, thus improving bike handling and stability. In order to protect the down tube from the front fork, whilst still keeping a geometrically lower down tube, Pinarello developed \\"ForkStopper\\" technology. The frame features internal cable routing for both Shimano and SRAM. The XC 9.9 was revealed at Granfondo La Pina in Treviso, Italy on 15 July 2012. The Pinarello Dogma XC 7.7 features the same unique-to-Pinarello divided rear triangle and is made from 60HM1K Torayca carbon fibre. The Pinarello Dogma XM 9.9 represents Pinarellos first venture back into Mountain biking since the Pinarello FV1, they claim the XM 9.9, constructed from 65HM3K carbon fibre, is as stiff as a roadbike. This claim is made through the usage of the new \\"ONDA Curve Asymmetric\\" rear quadrilateral, which is firm on flat ground and only works on uneven ground. Pinarello say that their system has only 5 points of flex as well as a monocoque design allow for this set of unique properties. Frame materials Originally, all Pinarello frames were steel. Pinarello used Columbus tubing for most of the 1980s but with tubing by Oria in the lower models in 1989. The first non-Italian tube was Tange Prestige for the US-based Levis Cycling team headed by Michael Fatka and ridden by Andrew Hampsten, Steve Tilford, Roy Knickmann, Thurlow Rogers in the mid-1980s.GITA Sporting Goods, Pinarello Catalogue 1989 Throughout the 1990s until 2004, Pinarello produced frames from conventional steel tubing using lugs, oversize tubing, oversize aluminium with TIG welded joints, magnesium and frames of carbon fiber and other materials. In 2005, Pinarello produced its first all-carbon fibre frame, the F4:13.

The company is the largest Reverse Vending Machine (RVM) provider globally and a leading provider of sensor-based sorting for the food, recycling and mining industries. With over 82,000 reverse vending machines (RVMs) installed, 10,000 food sorters and 6,000 recycling systems worldwide, TOMRA is the market leader in its industries. TOMRA is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSEBX) under the ticker symbol TOM. The parent company, Tomra Systems ASA, is headquartered in Asker, Norway, with central departments located in M√ºlheim-K√§rlich, Germany and Shelton, Connecticut. History = 1970s = TOMRA was founded by the two brothers Tore and Petter Planke in 1972. It started out with the design, manufacturing and sale of reverse vending machines (RVMs) for automated collection of used beverage containers. During this time, a major breakthrough for Tomra was when in 1974, the Swedish entity Systembolaget ordered 100 RVMs. = 1980s‚Äì2000s = TOMRA was listed in Oslo B√∏rs on 18 January 1985 and tried to secure a position in the American market to no avail. It was then successfully attempted to enter the market in 1990s. By 1999, sales in the US accounted for more than half of total revenues. In 2006, TOMRA delivered more than 8000 new reverse vending systems to Germany. TOMRA's sensor-based sorting technology business was first established in 2004 with the acquisition of TiTech Visionsort AS, a provider of optical recognition and sorting technology (which was renamed to Tomra Sorting Solutions in 2012), from Ferd AS for 219 million NOK. With the acquisition of Orwak in 2005, TOMRA established itself as a producer of compaction and baling solutions with an installed base of more than 67,000 balers. In December 2014, TOMRA sold the Orwak operations in Norway, Sweden, Poland and Japan under the name TOMRA Compaction to San Sac Nordic AB of Sweden. As of August 31, 2005, TOMRA Latasa Reciclagem S.A., offering aluminium can collection and recycling assets services in Brazil, Chile, and Argentina, was acquired by Aleris International, Inc. On 1 July 2006, TOMRA's subsidiary Titech Visionsort AS acquired 100 percent of the shares of Germany-based CommoDaS GmbH, a provider of recognition and sorting technology for metals, plastics, glass, minerals and gems, for approximately 100 million NOK. On 1 Juli 2008 TOMRA announced it bought Australian peer Ultrasort Group, a provider of advanced recognition and sorting technology to the mining industry, for 160 million NOK ($31.48 million). = 2010‚Äì2019 = Via several acquisitions, TOMRA had grown into a global company since the 2000s and secured 75% global market share in RVMs and 60% Material Recovery from Collection Solutions and 40‚Äì65% in Sorting Solutions. On 12 December 2010, TOMRA's subsidiary TiTech acquired Dublin-based food technology company Odenberg, a designer of equipment used for producing 65 per cent of all French fries worldwide, for up to 57.5 million Euro from ACT Venture Capital in Dublin and members of the Van den Bergh family in Belgium; Odenberg's chilling/freezing unit was later considered a non-core business and sold in 2013 as to a newly formed company, Power Food Technology Ltd., of Ireland. On 31 December 2011, TOMRA sold the assets of Tomra Pacific, Inc., a recycler of used beverage containers in California, to rePlanet, LLC for approximately $25 million. In June 2012, TOMRA purchased 100% of Belgium-based food sorting specialist Best Kwadraat for 138 million Euro. In October 2016 TOMRA signed an agreement to acquire Compac Holding Ltd., a New Zealand-based provider of packing house automation systems that sort fresh produce based on weight, size, shape, color, surface blemishes, and internal quality, for $70 million plus up to $230 million in earn-outs available to Compac founders; the transaction was completed in March 2017. On 26 February 2018, TOMRA signed an agreement to acquire 100% of the shares in BBC Technologies. The deal resulted in BBC Technologies‚Äô precision grading systems and innovative punnet and clamshell filling solutions for blueberries and other small fruits join TOMRA Food's own fruit inspection and grading technology portfolio.  Competition law compliance  In 2001, the EU Commission performed an investigation of Tomra's competition law compliance. Based on this investigation, the Commission concluded in March 2006 that TOMRA in their opinion had foreclosed competition in the period 1998 to 2002 in the market for reverse vending machines in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden by implementing an exclusionary strategy. TOMRA appealed the decision to the European General Court in 2006. In September 2010, the Court issued their judgment where they dismissed Tomra's appeal both on the substance and on the amount of the fine. TOMRA consequently accrued 28.2 million Euro (NOK 226.1 million) for the fine and accumulated interest in the third quarter financial statement for 2010. TOMRA appealed this decision again but finally lost the case in April 2012.The images shows a TOMRA T-820 BC (Bottle and Crate) machine.

Portrayed by actor/head writer Michael J. Nelson, Mike is a likeable temp worker from Little Chute, Wisconsin who comes to work for the mad scientists (\\"Mads\\") Dr. Clayton Forrester and TV's Frank in Deep 13 while they prepare for an evil-scientist audit in episode 512, Mitchell. When Joel Robinson escapes from the Satellite of Love at the end of this episode, the \\"Mads\\" knock Mike unconscious and send him up to the satellite to replace Joel as their experimental guinea pig. The hapless Mike finds himself forced to watch bad movies with robot companions Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot while interjecting humorous quips and cultural riffs based on the action and dialog in the films. Nelson's first full appearance was episode 513, The Brain That Wouldn't Die. He typically wore either a dark green jumpsuit, a teal jumpsuit or a blue jumpsuit. Series creator Joel Hodgson chose Nelson personally as his replacement, on the grounds that Nelson was a natural leader, a gifted comic and that he simply looked good standing next to the show's puppets. Prior to his tenure as host, Nelson played various parody \\"guest star\\" characters such as Torgo from Manos: The Hands of Fate, Morrissey, body builder and Hercules star Steve Reeves among others. He continued to play the occasional side character even after he became host. He also occasionally appeared as \\"Jack Perkins,\\" and continued the persona as host of the syndicated Mystery Science Theater Hour. Overview During his tenure as the show's host, Nelson ended the invention exchanges (last exchange seen during episode 519, Outlaw) and letter readings (episode 705, Escape 2000) that were a staple of the show's first five years, thus ending two popular segments, but giving the show's writers much more freedom in creating the opening and closing sketches. As co- star and writer Kevin Murphy explained, Nelson is many things \\"but he's not a tinkerer\\"; the invention exchanges had in any case been vehicles for Joel to engage in the sort of prop-based comedy he had specialised in before MST3K, and Nelson's strengths lay more in mimicry and the portrayal of various comic characters. Unlike Joel, who was more or less resigned to his fate at being stranded in space, Mike is more desperate and proactive in trying to find a way off of the Satellite of Love, making wild escape attempts during his run of the show. At one point, after seeing a bad Joe Don Baker film, he assumed he would leave as Joel did and boxed himself in a case of Hamdingers (a sort of spam sandwich). However, what he thought was an escape pod was in fact the ship's water heater. Mike's relationship with the bots was noticeably different from the one they had with Joel. Though they occasionally riffed on Joel, the two bots generally respected him and his authority, often regarding him as a sort of father figure (unsurprising, since he literally created them) who would espouse life-defining lessons that could neither be questioned nor refuted. The bots never felt that way about Mike. Although they quickly came to accept him as their friend and companion, the bots were often annoyed, impatient and even hostile with him (particularly during the Sci-Fi Channel era) when he screwed up or failed to pick up on something that was blatantly obvious to them, or regarding his past, such as dropping out of college (Mike had attended the University of Wisconsin-Stout). If Joel was a father figure, Mike was more like an older brother: though the bots were happy to make fun of him and subject him to various pranks, they were usually willing to help Mike when in need of aid or advice. Mike was also quite different from Joel in personality and temperament. Joel tended to take his captivity in benign stride, often delivering his riffs in a deadpan manner, holding no apparent malice against his captors and affectionately calling them \\"the Mads\\". Mike tended to be more cynical regarding both his captivity and his riffing of the films, and was frequently scheming to escape from the satellite or at least make the Mads look stupid, though he and the bots did share some moments of friendly recognition with later villains Pearl Forrester, Professor Bobo, and Observer. According to The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Guide, Mike is \\"as intelligent as the average man\\", and often displays a comic unawareness of his limitations and foibles. In episode #602 Invasion U.S.A., he builds a robot whose only function appears to be to \\"destroy...destroy...destroy...\\". During the eighth season, he manages to contribute accidentally to the destruction of planets in three separate incidents. During Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie, one of Mike's mistakes was trying to show off by piloting the Satellite of Love, and ended up crashing into the Hubble Space Telescope before totally destroying it while attempting to separate it from the ship. In episode #911 Devil Fish, he believes his identity has been stolen by a secret government agency merely after misplacing his wallet. He has an older brother, Eddie (also played by Nelson), a chain-smoking, hard-drinking bum who replaces him temporarily in the Time Chasers episode due to Crow going back in time to prevent Mike from getting the temp job which eventually results in his confinement on the SOL. However, this also caused Mike to die a horrible death, which was rectified by Crow going back in time once again, to fix things. Mike is also tapped by Pearl Forrester to provide \\"a little distraction\\" while she, Bobo, and the Brain Guy evacuate. This leads to Mike building a bomb out of baking soda and vinegar, and while preparing the bomb, he reminisces about other incidents in which he built such bombs (as \\"harmless pranks\\") and ends up lost in traumatic memories, overloading the bomb with too much baking soda. The blast subsequently blows up the entire planet, causing Crow to ask, \\"Are you out of your stupid, rotted skull, you dumb man?!\\" In the final episode, Mike and the bots finally return to Earth, not by means of cunning escape but by the stupidity of their captors, who accidentally send the Satellite of Love tumbling back into Earth's atmosphere. The final scenes show Mike and his robot friends sometime later, now living together in a ground-level apartment in Wisconsin, where Mike enjoys a bowl of rice as he sits down to watch The Crawling Eye, which had been the featured film for the very first nationally syndicated episode of the series.

Originally titled World of Wonders, the game incorporated several role-playing video game elements that were dropped when simultaneous turns were implemented. The game was co- developed by Triumph Studios and Epic MegaGames, Dutch and American game developers respectively, and published by Gathering of Developers in 1999; it was re-released in 2010 on GOG.com and Steam. The game has four sequels, Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne, Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic, Age of Wonders III, and Age of Wonders: Planetfall. Gameplay The game has a single-player campaign, playable from two sides (more campaigns have been made by the community since release), and many maps, both included and user-created that can be played in Hotseat mode, over a LAN, on the Internet, or by email (PBEM). Up to 12 players can participate in a single game, depending on the map. Players have an isometric view of the map, which consists of hexagonal tiles, and can have up to three layers (surface, caverns, and depths). Units are arranged into groups (also known as parties or stacks) of up to eight units; a single such group occupies one tile. Cities occupy between one and four tiles, and other structures generally occupy a single tile. Each player leads a certain race. There are 12 races available in the game, though not all of them may be present on every map, and of those which are, not all may be playable. List of races includes traditional fantasy Elves, Lizardmen, Humans, Goblins, Dark Elves, Undead, Orcs, Dwarves and Halflings, as well as several unique ones such as Frostlings, Azracs, and Highmen. Races, as well as units not belonging to any specific race, such as dragons and giants, have a certain alignment, which can be good, neutral, or evil. According to their alignment and certain other factors, cities and independent units of one race can be friendly or hostile towards another race. This can manifest itself in different ways; for example, an orc city is not likely to surrender to the elves, and if conquered, may revolt unless there is a strong military presence in it to oppress the population. Units of hostile races forced to fight alongside each other in a single group will have lower morale, and are more likely to desert. Race relations can be improved by acts of goodwill towards other races, such as upgrading their cities, or hampered by razing, looting, or migrating cities belonging to that race. Diplomacy can also affect this and even an alliance with one race might affect the relation of another race. There are also several spells which have a global effect on race relations. There are two resources, gold and mana. Gold is used to build units, buy heroes, cities and spells (in Wizard Towers), upgrade cities. Mana is used to cast and research spells and use altars. =Turn system= Units within the game have a limited number of movement points, which are replenished at the beginning of each turn. Two turn systems are used - sequential (or \\"classic\\"), where players take their turns in order, or simultaneous, where all players can move units at once. In practice, actions in the latter system are added and executed via a queue. Simultaneous turns are only available in single player and live multiplayer games; PBEM and hotseat games, and all combat, use the sequential turn system. =Units= Units can be built in cities, which can be further upgraded to produce more advanced units. Also, wandering independent (not belonging to any player) groups of units can be hired, if they are well-disposed towards the player. Units may have different strength, reflected by their level, which can vary from 1 to 4. Units under player control require a certain amount of gold every turn as an upkeep, the size of which depends upon the level of the unit. Summoned units use mana for upkeep instead of gold. Units have several parameters, namely attack, defence, damage, resistance, movement points and hit points. They may also have special abilities such as Archery, Fearless or Swimming. Units earn experience for killing other units. The amount of experience earned depends on the number of enemy units killed as well as their level - the level of the enemy killed is the amount of experience gained. Upon earning a certain amount of experience, the unit gets a silver medal, and later on a gold one. Higher level units require more experience to earn medals. Units with medals also get slight increases to their basic parameters, or otherwise improve their combat performance. A special type of unit, a hero, can only be hired when they appear at random at one of the player's cities. Heroes earn experience points just like all other units do; however, instead of getting medals for it, they gain levels to a maximum of level 30. Upon reaching the next level, they get a number of skill points, which a player can then spend to improve their parameters and teach them special abilities. This point system is similar to that used in many role-playing video games. In addition to that, heroes are the only units in the game which can learn the Spell Casting special ability, allowing them to cast spells. The Spell-Casting special ability can be upgraded from level I to level V. Each level provides more mana income/research points and also improves the channeling points allowing the hero to cast more/better spells each turn. Some spells require many turns to cast even with level V Spell-Casting. Heroes can not work together to cast one spell - each must cast it individually. Unlike common units, heroes can be brought from dead by magical means, although such experience will greatly decrease their morale. =Magic= Spells are divided into three types - unit spells which enhance a single unit, combat spells which are used to directly damage or handicap the enemy during combat, and global spells which can affect terrain, structures and groups of units on the global map, or summon magical creatures to player's aid. All have different mana costs depending on how advanced they are, and some of the more powerful unit and global spells can take more than one turn to cast. Counterspells to block and dispel unit and global enchantments are also available. Each spell furthermore belongs to one of the eight spheres of magic: Life, Death, Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Cosmos and Secret/Chaos. All players can research spells from the Cosmos sphere, but they are usually the weakest. Secret/Chaos sphere spells cannot be researched at all, and can only be bought in wizard towers scattered around the maps. In addition to those two, each player has at least one, and, depending on the number of spheres allowed by the map, up to three spheres in which he chooses to specialise; he can only research spells from his spheres (though he can buy spells from other spheres in wizard towers). As many as 7 spheres can be taken, with a maximum of 4 in one type. Opposite spheres cannot be taken: for example, a player cannot master both Life and Death, or Fire and Water. Mana, the magical energy required to research and cast spells, is channeled from magic nodes. Some of those are generic, and provide equal (though small) amount to caster of any sphere. Others are linked to one of the elemental planes, and only channel a specific kind of energy; thus, a Fire node, for example, can only be used by a player who chose the Fire sphere. Heroes with Spell-Casting also generate mana, your King/Leader more so than others. =Combat= Combat is initiated by one player attempting to move a stack onto a hex occupied by another player. If the players are at war, the attacker has the option of selecting tactical combat, where the players move individual units on a small map representing the battlefield, or automatic (\\"fast\\") combat, where the computer determines how the battle would have taken place by weighing off each side's attack, defense and movement parameters. Tactical combat is only available on single player maps, against independent units in PBEM games, and (optionally) against human players in live multiplayer games. Both forms of combat use the sequential turn system. Spells may be cast during combat, though global spells are disabled. Combat spells may target a unit or a group of units of the enemy collectively, damaging or temporarily handicapping them. Handicaps are usually introduced alongside direct damage, and vary from short-term paralysis to poisoning or a curse. Most spells have a maximum range. All ranged attacks (including some types of spells), and some melee strikes can result in friendly fire. For example, an archer firing an arrow at a target can hit and injure a friendly unit if it is on the line of fire. Trees, buildings and other obstacles scattered around combat maps also hamper ranged attacks as well as movement to various degrees, and can be used to one's advantage to great effect. Unit parameters and special abilities play a heavy role in combat. Attack is matched against target's defence to determine whether a hit was scored, and then damage determined the number of hit points the target loses. Some offensive spells have to beat the target's resistance instead, or even both defence and resistance. Physical attacks (such as archery) target defence, while other attacks (such as venomous spit) target resistance. Equal values of the attacker and the defender parameters results in a 50% chance to hit, and for each point of difference this is changed by 10% (but to a minimum of 10%, or a maximum of 90%). While most commonly only physical damage is dealt, sometimes attacks are partially or fully magical in nature, and can result in additional negative effects on the target: a fire strike has a chance of setting the target aflame, a lightning strike can paralyse the target, and so on. At the same time, units often have protection and/or immunity against specific forms of attacks. Protection reduces the damage of that effect by 50% e.g. lightning bolts with marksmanship II (a skill to improve attack/damage of a ranged attack) has 7 attack 4 damage, but would do a maximum of 2 damage against a unit with lightning protection, and none against a unit with lightning immunity. =Cities= Cities are probably the most important landmarks of the game. As mentioned above almost all a player's units are built in the cities. Also, capturing cities helps boost your income, which, in turn, helps to support your army. Cities are normally easy to capture. If a city is unoccupied, then a player should have no trouble just riding in and claiming the city. However, if the city is occupied, the player should be prepared for some resistance. If there's a wall around the city, the player won't be able to enter unless they have siege weapons or a unit that can fly or scale walls. Initially most cities are under independent control, depending upon the race's relation to you they will either join you for a fee giving you control of the city and troops or force you to defeat their troops before they bow to you. Once inside, it may be a good idea to \\"migrate\\" the city. By doing this, the city changes to fit the needs of your race. This is important if the occupying race is not one of your allies. Otherwise, the city will most likely rebel. Also, it's recommended that the players fortify their cities. This will make them harder for enemy units to capture. =Altars= Scattered across the board are a series of structures known as altars. These altars harness different types of magic and can be used as large-scale weapons. To fire off an altar, a player must first take control of it, then target a spot on the board (within a certain range), then click to cast the spell over the targeted area. Altars require 500 mana to fire. Each turn, they accumulate 50 mana charge, requiring 10 turns to fully recharge. Players with enough mana crystals may fire an altar multiple times sequentially without recharging. =AI= Both computer- controlled players and independent units on the game board can have several different AIs modes. Independent units seeking refuge will join you for free, while independent units guarding an area or location will never join you, and sometimes attack. Computer-controlled players, likewise, have a number of different personalities to choose from. The \\"defender\\" will simply sit there doing nothing. \\"Expander\\" or \\"Aggressor\\" usually results in fairly aggressive plays, while \\"Scorcher\\" will raze everything they conquer. Increased AI difficulty is achieved by giving the player bonus gold, bonus mana and bonus exp to heroes each turn. There have been many criticisms of the AI, leading some players to adopt self-imposed restrictions to make the game enjoyable: In tactical combat, the AI can be \\"baited\\" into engaging unfavourably, or chasing one unit around while other units take pot shots at it. The AI will not specifically target enemy leaders, even though doing so could mean the elimination of an enemy player. The AI will not suspect diplomatic backstabbing (i.e., as an ally, you can move an army next to their leader, declare war, and essentially assassinate them. It's possible to cast global spells and fire alters at allies, and doing so will not arouse the AI's suspicion. The AI's poor understanding of combat (especially Fast Combat) mechanics leads to sub-optimal army-building. The AI will not explore ruins, equip items or learn spells from wizard towers. The AI does not heed diplomatic consequences, sometimes leading to mass-desertion and mass- rebellion from their armies and cities. Development =Map editor= The Age of Wonders came with a basic map editing utility \\"AoWEd\\", that allows players to create their own scenarios or to edit existing scenarios included in the game. AoWEd enables players to draw their own maps, place cities, assign units and unit behavior, and create custom items and heroes, as well as functional and/or aesthetic placement of land and water features. However, script editing was limited to only message pop-ups and a few time-out events. Despite the limits of AoWEd, creative scenario makers (also referred to as ‚Äòmapmakers‚Äô) were able to draw maps with rich stories from their own imaginations, or took inspiration from classic fantasy worlds such as that of Tolkien, Dungeons & Dragons, etc. Many of such carefully crafted scenarios have been touted as being of higher quality than that which came with the game. Reasonably manageable file sizes makes it easy for players to download and exchange maps. Most map sizes are less than 100kb; the largest of map files are about 300 kb. Having scenario makers actively utilising the AoWEd to make new scenarios meant that players were almost never in short supply of new maps to try out and enjoy. Custom made scenarios were also often used in multiplayer / PBEM tournaments. Thus, the AoWEd was largely responsible for keeping the fans of the game entertained until the release of the sequel, Age of Wonders 2. The AoWEd was also used to generate the maps for the free online multiplayer game Battlemaster. AoWEd has demonstrated the importance of how including such a scenario/map editor in a game can prolong its longevity and increase its replay value. =Modifications= The first mod released was known as Warlock's Ruleset, after the player who created it. The mod changed some in-game costs and added new units and structures. Since the accidental release of the developer's editor (known as DevEd), many more mods have been made by the fan community (notably at HeavenGames), including the very popular \\"Lighthawk's Rules\\". However, there are some aspects of the game that can only be changed by use of a hex editor. Soundtrack The music files within Age of Wonders are in Impulse Tracker (.IT) format and were composed by Michiel van den Bos, who has also composed for other notable titles such as Deus Ex and the Unreal series of games. There are 20 tunes in the main gameplay, and also 4 other tunes to accompany different situations within gameplay. The 21st tune called \\"In The Company of Elves\\" was included with the demo version of Age of Wonders, but not with the final release of the game. In the demo version all songs beside the title song were in the Scream Tracker (.s3m) format.  Reception  In the United States, Age of Wonders sold 20,975 copies during 1999, and totaled 71,000 sales by October 2001. Its global sales had reached roughly 200,000 units by March 2001. At the time, PC Player noted that Age of Wonders was \\"not necessarily one of the biggest sellers in gaming history\\", but that its commercial performance was adequate to justify a sequel. Greg Vederman reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \\"Age of Wonders stands tall as one of the best games of the year. So, unless you're big on self- deprivation, go out and purchase this right now!\\" IGN reviewer Jason Bates wrote, \\"if you are at all interested in turn-based strategy games with a fantasy theme, go get this game.\\" Bates praised many of the game's features including the graphics, gameplay mechanics, editor, and online connectivity, but said the music was uninspiring and called the sound effects \\"serviceable but bland\\". The editors of PC Gamer US and CNET Gamecenter nominated Age of Wonders for their 1999 \\"Best Turn-Based Strategy Game\\" awards, both of which ultimately went to Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. The former publication noted that Age of Wonders \\"took the tired fantasy-based theme we've seen time and again and breathed new life into it.\\" References External links *Official website via Internet Archive *Age of Wonders at Triumph Studios * 1999 video games 4X video games Epic Games games Fantasy video games Gathering of Developers games Multiplayer and single-player video games Play-by-email video games Turn-based strategy video games Video games developed in the Netherlands Video games with isometric graphics Windows games Windows-only games ","title":"Age of Wonders"},{"id":"605942","text":"The new towns in the United Kingdom were planned under the powers of the New Towns Act 1946 and later acts to relocate populations in poor or bombed-out housing following the Second World War. They were developed in three waves. Later developments included the expanded towns: existing towns which were substantially expanded to accommodate what was called the \\"overspill\\" population from densely populated areas of deprivation. Designated new towns were removed from local authority control and placed under the supervision of a development corporation. These corporations were later disbanded and their assets split between local authorities and, in England, the Commission for New Towns (later English Partnerships). Historical precedents Welwyn Garden City, one of the early new towns =Garden cities= * Letchworth, Hertfordshire (founded in 1903 through the Garden city movement). * Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire (founded in 1920 through the Garden city movement). =Overspill estates= * Out-county London County Council housing developments, of which Becontree, Dagenham, was the largest. It was built in the 1920s and 1930s. * Seacroft in Leeds was built from 1934 when Leeds City Council bought 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) for municipal housing, and after World War II the majority of houses and blocks of flats were built. The council had planned for Seacroft to be a \\"satellite town within the city boundary\\" * Wythenshawe was built on former rural land in the north of Cheshire between the 1920s and early 1970s to rehouse families from the inner city slums of Manchester as an overspill estate. Other Manchester overspill estates include Hattersley (mostly built during the 1960s), Gamesley, and Haughton Green. * Castlemilk, Drumchapel, Easterhouse and Pollok in Glasgow. * Castle Vale in Birmingham, which was built in the 1960s in the extreme north-east of the city. England = First wave = Animated film by the Central Office of Information about postwar new towns and their planning The first wave was intended to help alleviate the housing shortages following the Second World War, beyond the green belt around London. A couple of sites in County Durham were also designated. These designations were made under the New Towns Act 1946. * Stevenage, Hertfordshire (designated 11 November 1946) * Crawley, Sussex (designated 9 January 1947) * Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire (designated 4 February 1947) * Harlow, Essex (designated 25 March 1947) * Newton Aycliffe, County Durham (designated 19 April 1947 as Aycliffe New Town) * Peterlee, County Durham (designated 10 March 1948, as Easington New Town) * Welwyn Garden City and Hatfield, Hertfordshire (both designated 20 May 1948) * Basildon, Essex (designated 4 January 1949) * Bracknell, Berkshire (designated 17 June 1949) * Corby, Northamptonshire (designated 1 April 1950) =Second wave= The town of Telford (formerly Dawley New Town) was created from a number of towns which were joined together around a central service area. The second wave (1961‚Äì64) was likewise initiated to alleviate housing shortfalls. Two of the locations below (Redditch and Dawley New Town‚Äîlater renamed Telford) are situated near the West Midlands conurbation; another two (Runcorn and Skelmersdale) are near Merseyside and were intended as overspill for the city of Liverpool. * Skelmersdale, Lancashire (designated 9 October 1961) * Dawley New Town, Shropshire (designated 16 January 1963) * Redditch, Worcestershire (designated 10 April 1964) * Runcorn, Cheshire (designated 10 April 1964) * Washington, Tyne and Wear (designated 24 July 1964) =Third wave= New Town architecture in Peterborough The third and last wave of new towns (1967‚Äì70) allowed for additional growth chiefly further north from the previous London new towns, with a few developments between Liverpool and Manchester, namely \\"Central Lancashire\\" and Warrington. Dawley New Town was redesignated as Telford New Town, with a much larger area, as overspill for Birmingham and nearby towns including Wolverhampton. About halfway between Birmingham and London was the new town of Milton Keynes (which took its name from a village in the area, but also swallowed up the existing towns of Bletchley, Wolverton and Stony Stratford), while the existing town of Northampton was expanded. In East Anglia, the city of Peterborough was designated as a new town to accommodate overspill from London. * Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire (designated 23 January 1967) * Peterborough, Cambridgeshire (designated 21 July 1967) * Northampton, Northamptonshire (designated 14 February 1968) * Warrington, Cheshire (designated 26 April 1968) * Telford, Shropshire (designated 29 November 1968) * Central Lancashire, Lancashire (designated 26 March 1970) Other 'overspill' developments During the same period as the new town scheme, several other towns underwent local authority led expansion as 'overspills' to larger urban areas, but were not officially designated as new towns, among these were: *Cramlington, Northumberland *Daventry, Northamptonshire *Killingworth, Tyne and Wear *Tamworth, Staffordshire Subsequent town expansion schemes No new towns have been formally designated since 1970, but several new large scale developments have been founded: * Cambourne, Cambridgeshire * Bar Hill, Cambridgeshire * South Woodham Ferrers, Essex * Ebbsfleet, Kent * Wixams, Bedfordshire * Sherford, Devon * Northstowe, Cambridgeshire (planned) * Cranbrook, Devon Poundbury is an experimental new town or urban extension on the outskirts of Dorchester. The development is built on land owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. It is built according to the principles of Prince Charles, who is known for holding strong views challenging the post-war trends in town planning that were suburban in character. =Future developments= On 13 May 2007, chancellor Gordon Brown, who became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom the following month, announced he would designate 10 new \\"eco-towns\\" to ease demand for low-cost housing. The towns, around 20,000 population each‚Äîat least 5,000 homes‚Äîare planned to be \\"carbon-neutral\\" and will use locally generated sustainable-energy sources. Only one site was identified in the announcement: the former Oakington Barracks in Cambridgeshire‚Äîthe already planned Northstowe development. Local councils will be invited to provide sites for the remaining four towns. The Town and Country Planning Association is advising the government on the criteria and best practice in developing the eco-towns by producing a series of \\"worksheets\\" for developers. In September 2014 the CBI called for all political parties to commit to building 10 new towns and garden cities to get to grips with the country's housing shortage.CBI Calls For 10 New Towns and Garden Cities Wales * Cwmbran (designated 4 November 1949) * Newtown (designated 18 December 1967) =Modern developments outside the scheme= * Coed Darcy (in progress) * Tircoed Scotland Six new towns in Scotland were designated between 1947 and 1973, mostly for the overspill population of Glasgow. * East Kilbride (designated 6 May 1947) * Glenrothes (designated 30 June 1948) * Cumbernauld (designated 9 December 1955, extended 19 March 1973) * Livingston (designated 16 April 1962) * Irvine (designated 9 November 1966, and encompassing existing settlement of Kilwinning) * Stonehouse (designated 17 July 1973, never built) =Modern developments outside the scheme= * Ravenscraig (in progress) * Chapelton of Elsick (in progress) * Tweedbank, new village built in the 1970s on a greenfield site in the central Scottish Borders.

(population 16,601) * Dalgety Bay, small new town developed in the 1970s and 1980s in Fife. (population 10,777) =Future developments= * An Camas M√≤r: new settlement proposed in the Cairngorms National Park * Blindwells: new settlement proposed adjacent to Tranent in East Lothian * Calderwell: new settlement proposed adjacent to East Calder and Livingston in West Lothian * Durieshill: new settlement proposed in Stirling Council area adjacent to Plean * Forestmill: new settlement proposed in Clackmannanshire in close proximity to the Fife Council administrative boundary * Oudenarde: new settlement proposed adjacent to the Bridge of Earn in Perthshire * Owenstown: new settlement proposed in the South Lanarkshire area to the south of Lanark * Shawfair: new settlement proposed in SE Edinburgh spanning the City of Edinburgh Council and Midlothian Council administrative boundaries * Tornagrain: new settlement proposed to the south of Inverness Airport in the Highland Council area Northern Ireland The New Towns Act (Northern Ireland) 1965 gave the Minister of Development of the Government of Northern Ireland the power to designate an area as a new town, and to appoint a development commission. An order could be made to transfer municipal functions of all or part of any existing local authorities to the commission, which took the additional title of urban district council, although unelected. This was done in the case of Craigavon. The New Towns Amendment Act (Northern Ireland) 1968 was passed to enable the establishment of the Londonderry Development Commission to replace the County Borough and rural district of Londonderry, and implement the Londonderry Area Plan. On 3 April 1969, the development commission took over the municipal functions of the two councils, the area becoming Londonderry Urban District. * Craigavon (designated 26 July 1965) * Antrim (designated 1966) * Ballymena (designated 1967) * Derry (designated 5 February 1969) Legacy In July 2002 the Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions assessed the effectiveness of the new towns and concluded that: > While many New Towns have been economically successful, most now are > experiencing major problems. Their design is inappropriate to the 21st > Century. Their infrastructure is ageing at the same rate and many have > social and economic problems. Many are small local authorities which do not > have the capacity to resolve their problems. Their attempts to manage the > towns are complicated by the role played by English Partnerships which still > has major landholdings and other outstanding interests. The new towns are no longer new and many of the quickly built houses have reached the end of their design life. The masterplans dictated low density development with large amounts of open space, and housing segregated from jobs, shopping and business services. These created a car dependency and are now not considered sustainable. Low density developments are expensive to maintain. Roads and sewers are in need of expensive upgrades.

It has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2004. Taxonomy The red-eyed dove was formally described by the German naturalist Eduard R√ºppell in 1835 from birds seen in the Taranta Mountains of Eritrea. He coined the binomial name Columba semitorquata. The specific epithet is combines the Latin semi- meaning \\"half-\\" or \\"small\\" and torquatus meaning \\"collared\\". The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. Description The red-eyed dove is a largish, stocky pigeon, typically 30 cm (12 inches) in length. Its back, wings and tail are pale brown. When flying, it shows blackish flight feathers. The head and underparts are dark vinous-pink, shading to pale grey on the face. There is a black hind neck patch edged with white. The legs and a patch of bare skin around the eye are red. The call is a loud doo-doo-du-du. Sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller than adults, and have scalloping on the body feathers. Red-eyed doves eat grass seeds, grains and other vegetation. They often forage on the ground. Distribution and habitat It is distributed through most of Sub-Saharan Africa, except in desert zones. It is a common, if not abundant, species in most habitats other than deserts. Like several other species in this genus, they are not particularly gregarious and often feed alone or in pairs. They can be found in forests near rivers. Behaviour This species builds a stick nest in a tree and lays two white eggs. Its flight is quick, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings, which are characteristic of pigeons in general.  References  *\\"Red-eyed dove.\\" Britannica School.

Mr. Culbertson was responsible for the execution, business development and financial performance of the company's human spaceflight, science, commercial communications, and national security satellite activities, as well as technical services to various government customers. These include some of Northrop Grumman's largest and most important programs such as NASA's Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) initiatives to the International Space Station (ISS) as well as various national security-related programs. Biography Culbertson was born on May 15, 1949, in Charleston, South Carolina, but considers Holly Hill, South Carolina, to be his hometown. He has five children and nine grandchildren. Culbertson was a Boy Scout and earned the rank of Second Class.Frank L. Culbertson Jr. at scouting.org He graduated from Holly Hill High School in 1967, and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the United States Naval Academy in 1971. He was a member of varsity rowing and wrestling teams at U.S. Naval Academy. United States Navy service Upon graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1971, Culbertson served aboard the in the Gulf of Tonkin prior to reporting to flight training in Pensacola, Florida. After designation as a Naval Aviator at Beeville, Texas, in May 1973, he flew F-4 Phantom aircraft with VF-121 at NAS Miramar, California; with VF-151 aboard the aircraft carrier , permanently homeported in Yokosuka, Japan; and with the U.S. Air Force in the 426th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, where he served as Weapons and Tactics Instructor. Culbertson then served as the Catapult and Arresting Gear Officer for until May 1981 when he was selected to attend the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. Following graduation with distinction in June 1982, he was assigned to the Carrier Systems Branch of the Strike Aircraft Test Directorate where he served as Program Manager for all F-4 testing and as a test pilot for automatic carrier landing system tests and carrier suitability. He was engaged in fleet replacement training in the F-14 Tomcat at VF-101, NAS Oceana, Virginia, from January 1984 until his selection for the astronaut candidate program. He has logged over 8,900 hours flying time in 55 different types of aircraft, and has made 450 carrier landings, including over 350 arrested landings, and numerous tests of the Automated Carrier Landing System. NASA career Selected as a NASA astronaut candidate in May 1984, Culbertson completed basic astronaut training in June 1985. Technical assignments since then included: member of the team that redesigned and tested the Space Shuttle nosewheel steering, tires, and brakes; member of the launch support team at Kennedy Space Center for Shuttle flights STS-61-A, STS-61-B, STS-61-C, and STS-51-L; in 1986 he worked at the NASA Headquarters Action Center in Washington, D.C., assisting with the Challenger accident investigations conducted by NASA, the Presidential Commission, and U.S. Congress. He became lead astronaut at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); lead of the First Emergency Egress Team; and lead spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in the Mission Control Center for seven missions (STS-27, STS-29, STS-30, STS-28, STS-34, STS-33, and STS-32 [note that Shuttle missions are not ordered chronologically]). Following his first flight, he served as the Deputy Chief of the Flight Crew Operations Space Station Support Office, as well as the lead astronaut for Space Station Safety. He was also a member of the team evaluating the hardware and procedures for the proposed mission to dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. Following STS-51, Culbertson was Chief of the Astronaut Office Mission Support Branch; then Chief of the Johnson Space Center Russian Projects Office. In 1994, Culbertson was named Deputy Program Manager, Phase 1 Shuttle-Mir, and in 1995 became Manager of the Shuttle-Mir Program. He was responsible for a multi-national team which executed nine Shuttle docking missions to the Russian Space Station Mir, with seven astronauts spending 30 months cumulatively on board the Mir Station, plus all the associated science and docking hardware to ensure the success of the joint program, a precursor to the building of the joint International Space Station. Just prior to his current flight assignment, Culbertson spent one year as Deputy Program Manager for Operations of the International Space Station Program. =Spaceflight experience= ISS-03 Commander A veteran of three space flights, Culbertson has logged over 146 days in space . STS-38 Atlantis (November 15‚Äì20, 1990) was a five-day mission during which the crew conducted Department of Defense operations. The mission concluded after 80 orbits of the Earth in 117 hours, 54 minutes, 28 seconds, the first Shuttle to land in Florida since 1985. STS-51 Discovery (September 12‚Äì22, 1993) was a ten-day mission during which the crew deployed the U.S. Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS/TOS), and the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (ORFEUS/SPAS) carrying U.S. and German scientific experiments, including an ultraviolet spectrometer. A seven-hour EVA was also conducted to evaluate Hubble Space Telescope repair tools and methods. After the SPAS spacecraft had completed six days of free flight some 40 miles from Discovery, the crew completed a successful rendezvous and recovered the SPAS with the Shuttle's robot arm. The mission concluded with the first night landing of the Shuttle at the Kennedy Space Center. Mission duration was 158 Earth orbits in 236 hours and 11 minutes. Culbertson inside Soyuz TM-32 during its moving to another docking port The Expedition 3 crew launched on August 10, 2001 aboard STS-105 Discovery and docked with the International Space Station on August 12, 2001.

The two had been aeronautical engineering majors together, and had both gone on to become F-4 fighter pilots. Culbertson had his trumpet onboard ISS, and with their Academy class having their 30th reunion, he played taps, which he felt was especially fitting in that the two had also played in the Academy's Drum & Bugle Corps together.9/11 Perspective from Space, Astronaut Frank Culbertson shares his experience from 9/11 being onbooard ISS (Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, posted to YouTube on Sep 10, 2014) The Expedition 3 crew left the station on December 15 aboard STS-108 Endeavour, landing at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on December 17, 2001.

The group was established at the end of August 1919 following a three-way split of the Socialist Party of America. Although a legal political party at the time of its formation, with a form of organization closely resembling that of the Socialist Party whence it sprung, the group was quickly forced underground by the Palmer Raids of January 1920 and thereafter conducted its activities in secret. The group merged with a dissident faction of the Communist Party of America in May 1920 to form the United Communist Party of America.  Organizational history  = Background = United Mine Workers functionary Adolph Germer, Executive Secretary of the Socialist Party of America, was one of the leaders of the Regular faction that forced the Communist Labor Party of America to split With the end of World War I and the consolidation of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1918, long running tension in the Socialist Party of America (SPA) between the revolutionary socialist left-wing and the electorally-oriented center deepened.The best treatment of the left vs. right struggle in the early Socialist Party remains Ira Kipnis, The American Socialist Movement, 1897-1912. New York: Columbia University Press, 1952. Radicals were particularly disheartened by the tepid 1916 campaign of \\"colorless\\" Socialist presidential candidate Allan L. Benson‚Äîan effort which saw the first reduction in the party's tally in presidential voting in party history.Theodore Draper, The Roots of American Communism. New York: Viking Press, 1957; pg. 70. The adjective \\"colorless\\" is Draper's. From roots in the Boston-based Socialist Propaganda League of America and the Boston newspaper The Revolutionary Age, an organized faction calling itself the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party emerged at the end of 1918.The Socialist Propaganda League launched in October 1915 in Massachusetts, with strong backing of the strong Boston-area units of the Latvian Socialist Federation. The Revolutionary Age, edited by Louis C. Fraina, first saw print in November 1918. See Draper, The Roots of American Communism, pp. 69-72, 131. Radical editor Louis C. Fraina composed a Left Wing Manifesto, around which the Left Wing Section organized itself, holding raucous meetings of SPA locals and branches to force endorsement of the program and running a slate of candidates in the SPA's annual election in an attempt to \\"capture\\" and remold the party according to the Russian Bolshevik Party's model. Buoyed by the bloc voting of radical, Bolshevik-influenced branches of the Socialist Party's Foreign Language Federations, the Left Wing Section very apparently won a majority of the 15 seats on the party's governing National Executive CommitteeDraper, The Roots of American Communism, pg. 156. as well as balloting for International delegates and International Secretary in the 1919 election.Present Party Officialdom Overwhelmingly Repudiated by National Referendum. (A Tabulation of the 1919 Socialist Party Election).\\" The Ohio Socialist whole no. 73 (June 18, 1919), pg. 3. Facing ceding party control to an aggressive Bolshevik National Executive Committee, the outgoing National executive Committee, guided by James Oneal and Executive Secretary Adolph Germer, declared that voting irregularities had rendered the result invalid.Draper, The Roots of American Communism, pg. 157. Suspensions and expulsions of a major part of the SPA's membership immediately followed, beginning with the May 1919 suspensions of the Russian, Lithuanian, Polish, Latvian, South Slavic and Ukrainian Federations in addition to the entire state socialist parties of Michigan, Massachusetts and Ohio.Draper, The Roots of American Communism, pg. 158. In New York, the State Executive Committee suspended and \\"reorganized\\" Left Wing locals and branches representing nearly half the state's membership. By July 1919, the Socialist Party had purged itself through suspensions and expulsions of more than 60,000 of the nearly 110,000 members that it had touted in January of that year. With Oneal and Germer's Party Regulars clearly in control of the situation, the suspended Foreign Language Federations and idiosyncratic Socialist Party of Michigan determined to move immediately to the formation of a Communist Party of America and issued a call for a founding convention to be held in Chicago on September 1, 1919. Others determined to fight on against the odds to restore the results of the 1919 party election at the scheduled August 30 convention of the Socialist Party. It was this latter group that would go on to establish the Communist Labor Party of America. = Establishment = Executive Secretary Alfred Wagenknecht in 1918 Most of the English-speaking Left Wingers, headed by National Executive Committee members Alfred Wagenknecht and L. E. Katterfeld and including prominent New York journalist John Reed determined to fight on in an attempt to win control of the Socialist Party for the Left Wing. However, with many Left Wingers already abandoning this approach and the Regular faction firmly in control of a majority of the states electing delegates to the Emergency National Convention in Chicago scheduled for August 30, 1919, the fight was essentially over before it began. The Credentials Committee of this convention was easily won by adherents of the Oneal-Germer Regulars, who froze out Left Wing-oriented delegations from California, Oregon and Minnesota. Roughly two dozen delegates pledging allegiance to the Left Wing Section bolted the convention to meet downstairs in a previously rented room, along with about 50 other Left Wingers from around the country. These latter delegates constituted themselves as the Communist Labor Party of America on August 31, 1919. Executive Secretary of the Communist Labor Party of America was Alfred Wagenknecht of Ohio. The five member National Executive Committee consisted of Max Bedacht, Alexander Bilan, L. E. Katterfeld, Jack Carney and Edward Lindgren. Initial headquarters were maintained in Cleveland before being moved to New York City in December 1919. = Underground period = The party moved to the underground in response to mass arrests and deportations conducted by the Justice Department and its Bureau of Investigation, guided by Special Assistant to the Attorney General J. Edgar Hoover. These raids and the move to the underground virtually destroyed the organization, which only existed in skeletal form in the first half of 1920, although publication of its legal newspaper, The Toiler, was maintained. The party also published an \\"illegal\\" underground monthly paper called Communist Labor Party News and issued the final issue of Ludwig Lore's theoretical magazine The Class Struggle under its auspices. = Dissolution through merger = On April 18, 1920, Executive Secretary C. E. Ruthenberg exited the Communist Party of America and along with his factional supporters (such as Jay Lovestone and Isaac Edward Ferguson) constituted themselves as the \\"real\\" Communist Party of America with a view to merger with the Communist Labor Party of America. This organizational marriage took place at a secret Joint Unity Convention held at Bridgman, Michigan on May 26‚Äì31. The resulting organization, also organized along underground lines to avoid arrest, was known as the United Communist Party of America (UCPA). The Communist International to which the UCPA and the CPA both pledged their allegiance sought to end duplication, competition and hostility between the two communist parties and insisted on a merger into a single organization. That was eventually effected in May 1921 at a secret gathering held at the Overlook Mountain House hotel, near Woodstock, New York. The resulting unified group was also known as the Communist Party of America, which morphed into the Workers Party of America (December 1921) and changed its name in 1925 to Workers (Communist) Party and to Communist Party USA in 1929.

Biography Edmund Trebus was born in Ostrowo, near Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), Poland, on 11 November 1918, the day of the Armistice. When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939 Trebus was conscripted into the Wehrmacht. He was then captured and served with the Allied forces in Italy, in an anti-tank unit of the II Corps of the Polish armed forces, which was under British command. After moving to England just after the Second World War, Trebus married Jozefa Noga in 1949. They had five children. Trebus had been a collector all his life and he was often seen pushing a handcart filled with his latest acquisitions, which he carefully sorted into separate piles in his garden and home. One of Trebus's major loves was Elvis Presley, and he managed to collect and store away a copy of almost every single Elvis record. In his eighties, living alone in a run-down house in Crouch End in North London, Trebus was constantly in trouble with the environmental health department of the London Borough of Haringey because of complaints about the rubbish surrounding his home. He lived in a tiny area on the ground floor of his house, surrounded by piles of rubbish, because he never threw anything away. In the BBC documentary series A Life of Grime Trebus was repeatedly shown arguing with council workers who had been instructed to clear his house of the of rubbish it contained. He was eventually rehoused at the Trentfield Nursing Home in Southgate, where he died at the age of 83. Following his death the BBC broadcast an hour-long tribute, Mr Trebus: A Life of Grime.

It was written by Brian Alan Lane and directed by Rob Bowman. It was originally released on December 5, 1988, in broadcast syndication. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, a holographic adversary is created on the holodeck of the Enterprise (1701D) when Data and Geordi take some time off to play a Sherlock Holmes game. The plot line from this episode was continued in the sixth season episode \\"Ship in a Bottle\\". In 1989, \\"Elementary, Dear Data\\" was Nominated for two Emmy Awards: Outstanding Art Direction for a Series, Richard D. James, Art Director; Jim Mees, Set Decorator and Outstanding Costume Design for a Series, Durinda Wood, Costume Designer; William Ware Theiss, Starfleet Uniforms Creator. Plot As the Federation starship Enterprise, under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, waits to rendezvous with the USS Victory, Chief Engineer La Forge and Commander Data go to the Holodeck to recreate a Sherlock Holmes mystery. Data, playing Holmes, has memorized all of the Holmes stories, and recognizes and solves the mystery within minutes. Frustrated, Geordi leaves the holodeck, leaving Data confused. In Ten Forward, Geordi explains that the fun is in solving the unknown; Data does not understand. Overhearing their conversation, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Pulaski asserts that Data is incapable of solving a mystery to which he does not already know the outcome. Data accepts Dr. Pulaski's challenge and invites her to join them on the Holodeck. There, Geordi instructs the computer to create a unique Sherlock Holmes mystery with an adversary who is capable of defeating Data. In the new program, Dr. Pulaski is kidnapped, and Data investigates. They soon discover that Professor Moriarty is responsible, but when they find him with Pulaski in his hideout, they are shocked when they learn that Moriarty is aware of the Holodeck program being a simulation, and is able to access the Holodeck computer, showing them a sketch of the Enterprise he has drawn based on the computer's description. Data and Geordi leave the Holodeck to alert the Captain, and Geordi realizes that when he asked the computer to create the program he had asked for an adversary who could defeat Data, not Sherlock Holmes; as a result, the computer gave the Holodeck character Professor Moriarty the intelligence and cunning needed to challenge Data, plus the ability to access the ship's computer. When Moriarty gains access to ship stabilizer controls, Data returns to the Holodeck with Captain Picard. Picard meets Moriarty, who demonstrates that he has evolved beyond his original programming and asks to continue to exist in the real world. Picard tells Moriarty that this would not be possible; instead, he saves the program and tells Moriarty that if they ever discover a way to convert Holodeck matter into a permanent form they will bring him back. Picard discontinues the program and the USS Victory arrives, with La Forge preparing to present a model of the historic HMS Victory. LeVar Burton, Diana Muldaur, and Brent Spiner on set Production \\"Elementary, Dear Data\\" was written by Brian Alan Lane and directed by Rob Bowman. =Story and script= According to Co-executive producer Maurice Hurley, the idea for this episode was inspired by Data's experiences in \\"The Big Goodbye\\". Hurley stated, \\"It wasn't a writer saying, 'Let's do this.' It was one of the people living on the Enterprise.\\" This episode contains elements from and references to the Sherlock Holmes short stories A Scandal in Bohemia, The Red-Headed League, The Adventure of the Speckled Band, and The Adventure of the Bruce- Partington Plans, as well as the Holmes novel The Valley of Fear. Furthermore, Moriarty's creation being a result of Geordi La Forge requesting an opponent capable of defeating Data references Arthur Conan Doyle's creation of the same character for the short story The Final Problem ‚Äì specifically, as an opponent capable of defeating Sherlock Holmes who, at the time, Doyle wanted to kill off. Reportedly, the original ending had Jean-Luc Picard lying to Moriarty, that he could have existed outside the holodeck, the same way the piece of paper on which he drew the Enterprise also stayed intact outside the holodeck. Co-executive producer Maurice Hurley wanted to keep that ending, as it made Picard look clever, but Gene Roddenberry nixed it, saying it made Picard look cruel. Instead, the paper stays intact without any explanation. =Casting= The episode features Daniel Davis as James Moriarty. Daniel Davis used an English accent for this role in both episodes; however, he is from Arkansas and speaks with an American accent when not in character. Davis was auditioning for the role of Moriarty alongside another actor in the room Brian Bedford directly in front of director Rob Bowman. Davis said of being in the room with Brian Bedford, \\"So he‚Äôs the standout in my mind, and we were sort of taking bets with each other about which of us would get it. We hadn‚Äôt worked together or seen each other in a long time. So it was a very friendly rivalry. Then, when I got it, he was a very good sport and invited me to come to dinner to celebrate that I had gotten the part.\\" The episode also features Anne Elizabeth Ramsay, making her first Star Trek: The Next Generation appearance as Ensign Clancy. The actress reprised the role in ‚ÄúThe Emissary,‚Äù also in season two. Ramsay went on to a busy career as an actress. She co-starred as Lisa Stemple, the dysfunctional sister of Helen Hunt‚Äôs character, in 123 episodes of Mad About You, for which she shared a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. Ramsay also played a recurring role on Six Feet Under and Dexter. Reception In 1989, the episode was nominated for two Emmy awards. In 2016, The Hollywood Reporter rated \\"Elementary, Dear Data\\" the 10th best episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. They also ranked it as the 26th best of all Star Trek episodes up to 2016. A Den of Geek review gave it a 100% watch rating and remarked it was 'fantastic episode'. In particular they praised concepts explored about computers and artificial intelligence as well as the Data and Geordi character sequences. The episode's title \\"Elementary, Dear Data\\" was noted as a play on the Sherlock Holmes phrase \\"Elementary, my dear Watson\\".Sherlock Holmes and Philosophy: The Footprints of a Gigantic Mind Page 299 In 2011, this episode was noted by Forbes as one that explores the implications of advanced technology, in this case for exploring an apparently self-aware software program. TIME (magazine) rated the holographic Professor Moriarty as the 5th best villain of the Star Trek franchise in 2016. In 2020, Looper listed this as one of the best episodes for Data, remarking that it is \\"..The Next Generation having a whole lot of fun\\"; Geordi and Data tackle a holodeck gone wrong plot, with a Sherlock Holmes theme.

There have been three different BARVs in British service since their introduction during World War II. They have also been used by Dutch and Australian forces. Sherman BARV Sherman BARV tows a disabled truck and its load off the beach at Normandy, 14 June 1944 The original BARV was a Sherman M4A2 tank which had been waterproofed and had the turret replaced by a tall armoured superstructure. Around 60 were deployed on the invasion beaches during the Battle of Normandy. Able to operate in 9-foot (2.7 metre) deep water, the BARV was used to remove vehicles that had become broken-down or swamped in the surf and were blocking access to the beaches. They were also used to re-float small landing craft that had become stuck on the beach. Unusually for a tank, the crew included a diver whose job was to attach towing chains to stuck vehicles. The vehicles were developed and operated by the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. The Sherman M4A2 model was chosen as a basis for the BARV as it was thought that the Sherman's welded hull would be easier to waterproof than other tanks. Unlike other Sherman models, the M4A2 was powered by a diesel engine because it was believed the tank would be less affected by the sudden temperature changes caused by the regular plunges into cold water. A few Sherman BARV's continued to be used until 1963, when they were replaced by a vehicle based on the Centurion tank. M3 BARV M3 BARV, Royal Australian Armoured Corps Tank Museum A single M3A5 Grant tank was converted into a BARV in 1950 by the Australian Army. This remained in service until 1970 Centurion BARV Centurion BARV at the Yad la-Shiryon Museum, Latrun (November 2005)By the late 1950s, Sherman BARVs were becoming less useful as they were unable to recover the heavier armoured vehicles that were being introduced. The Centurion BARV FV 4018 was developed as a replacement. A mild-steel prototype was followed in 1960 by 12 production vehicles. These were based on the hulls of Mark 1, 2, and 3 Centurion tanks that by this time were redundant. Although initially assigned to the Army, they were passed to the Royal Marines when the Army's amphibious assault role was given to the Marines. The BARV was basically a Centurion body with built up sides to accommodate wading in water up to 11 feet. The design was functional yet crude with sloped armour built above the tank hull. The tracks for the BARV were reversed so they had better grip biting in reverse. The Centurion BARV retained the gun-tank's Rolls-Royce Meteor petrol engine. Centurion BARVs had a crew of four; two of the crew were members of the Royal Engineers, one of whom was a qualified diver. The Centurion BARV's were built to provide the essential role for the LPD's HMS Fearless & HMS Intrepid as part of the Beach Assault Squadrons. The Assault Squadrons were initially a mix of Royal Marines and Army serving aboard the ships. The transition to this being all Royal Marines was seen to be essential. The crew for the BARV's would be handed to the Royal Marines with a sergeant, two corporals and a marine, all qualified vehicle mechanics, responsible for driving and maintaining the tank, and also providing full mechanical breakdown services for all embarked vehicles. The training for the crew would take place at Bovington for driver training and at the home of the BARV, Instow in North Devon, the Royal Marines amphibious testing centre. There were many occasions when the BARV would break down or get stuck. In 1981 the BARV from Fearless was to be lost at sea off Browndown beach to end up fully submerged. The following year both BARVs would see service during the Falklands War, being the largest land vehicles ashore, with the BARV from Fearless breaking its drivetrain whilst working Blue Beach. All the Centurion-derived BARV's have now left service and have been sold to collectors and museums around the world. Hippo BRV HMS Bulwark (2012) The Netherlands Marine Corps BRV Samson (2007) In 2003, the Centurion BARV's replacement was introduced. This is the Hippo BRV, which had been in development under the project name of \\"Future Beach Recovery Vehicle\\" (FBRV). The name change reflects the fact that, unlike previous generations of vehicle used in this role, Hippos are not fully armored. The Hippo is a conversion by Alvis Moelv of a Leopard 1A5 tank. The incorporation of Alvis Vickers into BAE Systems meant that elements of the work moved to BAE Land Systems, Sweden, formerly known as \\"H√§gglunds\\", another ex-Alvis company. As with earlier generations of BARV, the main alteration has been the replacement of the turret with a raised superstructure which, in this case, resembles the bridge or wheelhouse of a small ship. The original diesel engine has been retained but the gearing of the transmission had been lowered; this has reduced the vehicle's road speed from , but its tractive force has been increased to . Other modifications include the addition of working platforms, a nosing block, raised air intakes and an auxiliary power unit; this has raised the weight of the vehicle from 42.5 tonnes to 50 tonnes. The Hippo has a fording depth of and can pull vehicles up to 50 tonnes weight or push off from the beach a 240 tonne displacement landing craft. Currently, four Hippos are in British service, one each on HMS Albion and Bulwark, with two used by 11 Amphibious Trials and Training Unit Royal Marines. The vehicle is reportedly well liked by its users, but its lack of commonality with the other armoured vehicles used by the UK has caused spares support problems, exacerbated by the poor nature of the Initial Spares Support package procured from Alvis Moelv by the UK's Defence Procurement Agency. This area is being tackled by the MoD's Defence Logistics Organisation. The Netherlands Marine Corps operates four similar Dutch Leopard 1V-based BRV vehicles known as Hercules, Samson, Goliath and Titan which operate out of the Royal Netherlands Navy assault ships of the Rotterdam class. The vehicles have a similar specification but a different cabin appearance. Survivors Sherman BARV, REME Museum of Technology, September 2010 In England, the REME Museum of Technology in Arborfield and the D-Day Story in Portsmouth both have Sherman BARVs on display. Another, in running condition, is held by the War and Peace Collection, a private military collection in the UK. The wrecked hulk of another is at The Tank Museum, after being used as a firing range target. Another Sherman BARV is a museum-piece in India, at the Cavalry Tank Museum, Ahmednagar. The Australian M3 BARV is preserved at the Royal Australian Armoured Corps Tank Museum at Puckapunyal, Australia. The museum also has a second BARV that was based on a bulldozer. Centurion BARVs are on display at The Tank Museum (UK), at Yad La-Shiryon in Latrun - the IDF tank museum - and at the Israel Defense Forces History Museum (Batey ha-Osef) in Tel-Aviv. A Centurion BARV, in private hands, is parked and able to be viewed at the entrance of a farm on Colne Road, Bures Hamlet, Essex, England. AeroVenture in Doncaster, UK has a Centurion BARV 02 ZR 77 on display as part of its Falklands War Collection. This was originally one of the first Centurions built as part of the first contract between 1944 and 1946 (the exact date of build is unknown). It was one of the two BARVs that took part in Operation Sutton, the British landings at San Carlos with one from HMS Fearless supporting the landings on Blue Beach and one from HMS Intrepid supporting the landings on Red Beach and remains the longest serving armoured vehicle in the British forces, leaving service in 2005 after taking part in both Gulf conflicts.

He was born in Neisse, Upper Silesia (now Nysa, Poland). On 25 April 1945, Mutke landed at D√ºbendorf, Switzerland, flying the Me 262A-1a jet fighter, 'White 3', from 9. Staffel, Jagdgeschwader 7. He claimed that he got lost during a combat mission and landed there by mistake, although there were suspicions that he'd defected. The Swiss authorities never attempted to fly the plane, keeping it in storage and returning it to Germany on 30 August 1957. He sued the post-war German government, unsuccessfully, for the return of the plane, claiming it was his own property. Mutke also made the controversial claim that he broke the sound barrier in 1945 in an Me 262, but mainstream opinion continues to regard Chuck Yeager as the first person to achieve this milestone in 1947 in a Bell X-1. The dive On 9 April 1945, F√§hnrich Mutke, part of the Erg√§nzungs-Jagdgeschwader 2 (EJG 2) conversion squadron, 3rd flight, took off from Lagerlechfeld in his Messerschmitt Me 262, marked Wei√üe 9, for a planned high-altitude flight. He was climbing through at an altitude of 12,000 m (36,000 ft) in near perfect weather with a visibility of over 100 km, listening to the radio conversations, when his chief instructor Oberstleutnant Heinz B√§r detected a P-51 Mustang approaching the plane of a comrade, Unteroffizier Achammer, from behind. Mutke went into a steep 40¬∞ dive with full engine power. While passing through the altitude of 12,000 m, his Me 262 started to vibrate and began swinging from side to side. The speedometer was stuck against its limit of 1,100 km/h (684 mph) (the maximum speed of the Me 262 is 870 km/h). The speed of sound is 1,062 km/h (660 mph) at an altitude of 12,000 m, depending on the environmental variables. The shaking intensified, and Mutke temporarily lost control of his plane. He reported that with the speedometer still off the scale he attempted to recover from the uncontrollable dive by adjusting the main tailplane incidence angle. Rather than just having a hinged elevator, the Me 262 could change the angle of incidence of the whole tailplane, a design feature that was later added to the Bell X1. Suddenly, the buffeting stopped, and control resumed for a few seconds. Mutke throttled back and his engines flamed out, and after the short period of smooth flight, the buffeting resumed and the aircraft began shaking violently again. He fought to regain control and re- light the engines eventually reducing the speed below 500 km/h. After a difficult landing, it was found that his plane was missing many rivets and also had distorted wings. Claims At the time, Mutke did not understand the reasons for this strange behavior. Only after learning about the supersonic flights of Chuck Yeager in 1947 did he attribute these phenomena to the effects of supersonic flight and claim to have broken the sound barrier‚Äîyears before Yeager did. This claim is disputed, and there are a number of other pilots and countries that claim the first supersonic flight. However, Mutke never claimed he was the first person to break the sound barrier, but instead argued that his flight was merely proof that the Me 262 was capable of reaching and exceeding Mach 1 and that therefore other German fighter pilots may have done so even before him. In a series of carefully controlled flight tests conducted in World War II by Messerschmitt, it was established that the Me 262 went out of control in a dive at Mach 0.86, and that higher Mach numbers would lead to a nose-down trim that could not be counter-acted by the pilot by use of the control column. The resulting steepening of the dive would lead to even higher speeds and self-destruction of the airframe due to excessive negative G loads. Postwar testing by the British government corroborated Messerschmitt's results, though neither actually exceeded Mach 0.86. Mutke claimed to have overcome the ever steepening dive by adjustment of the 262's tailplane incidence. This is the same technique employed by Chuck Yeager in the Bell X-1 to avoid what is known as Mach tuck. Furthermore, Mutke's observation that he briefly regained control of the aircraft, while still accelerating, corresponds with later accounts of supersonic flight. After the war, American test pilots filed reports about the Me 262, including the possibility of a speed of Mach 1. Compressibility in pitot tubes of the time often resulted in exaggerated speed readings near the speed of sound, particularly in German equipment, which was adversely affected by supply shortages as the war progressed. American Sabrejets and other high-speed aircraft (including the Bell X-1) also experienced anomalous airspeed readings in the high-subsonic flight regime (between 0.8 Mach and Mach 1). The Me 262's pre-area rule fuselage would have additionally resulted in very high transonic drag, and its engines were already underpowered and temperamental to begin with. However, aircraft such as the Bell X-1, F-86 Sabre and Convair F2Y Sea Dart similarly did not have area ruled fuselages, yet are acknowledged to have flown at supersonic speeds ‚Äî here the engine thrust, either alone or in combination with the pull of gravity during a dive, supplies enough force to accelerate the airplane to supersonic speed. Due to the nature of Mutke's combat flight, it is impossible to determine the exact speed of his plane, and it is also difficult to estimate the exact speed of sound at that temperature and altitude. Therefore, it is not possible to either prove or disprove his claims, and there is much discussion among experts as to whether the Me 262 was able to reach the speed of sound. It is believed that the damaging effects experienced by Mutke were a side effect of supersonic airstream and shock waves over different parts of the airframe, called buffeting. This effect occurs at speeds approaching Mach 1 but ceases above Mach 1. A number of other Me 262 experienced similar strange accidents, or breaking apart in the sky because of buffeting and the different aerodynamics at the sound barrier. Transonic buffeting effects had also been widely reported by pilots of propeller-driven Allied fighters including the Supermarine Spitfire, P-38 Lightning, P-47 Thunderbolt and P-51 Mustang, aircraft that were known to have top diving speeds of less than 0.85 Mach (although one Spitfire was measured at 0.92 Mach). Allied fighter pilots reported seeing supersonic shock waves and popped rivets during dives as the high-speed air rushing over the wing exceeded Mach 1 even though the forward airspeed of the overall aircraft was well below that speed. Many proponents of the claim also believe that after the end of the war the Allied powers had no interest in emphasizing any German achievements during the war. Mutke's claim, however, is without controlled, experimental confirmation. A computer-based performance analysis of the Me 262 carried out in 1999 at the Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen concluded that the Me 262 could indeed exceed Mach 1\\"Pilot claims he broke sound barrier first\\" USA Today, June 19, 2001. Retrieved: June 8, 2017. . After World War II After the war, Mutke moved to Argentina, where he flew Douglas DC-3s for several airlines. He later returned to Germany, where he completed medical training. He died in Munich in 2004, during a heart valve operation. He donated his bodily remains to the anatomist Gunther von Hagens.

The University offered undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral programmes with 20,178 degree students and 1,981 employees as of 2016. Founded in 1925 in Helsinki as the Civic College () and from 1930 onwards known as the School of Social Sciences (), the institution relocated to Tampere in 1960 and was renamed as the University of Tampere in 1966. In 2016, its budget was ‚Ç¨184.6 million of which 59% was government funding. History leftThe institution was established in 1925 as the Civic College in Helsinki teaching public administration, organisation management and journalism with an inaugural intake of 72 students. In 1930, a total of 195 students were enrolled at the College and its name was amended to the School of Social Sciences. Similarly, the institution's vocationally oriented bachelor's degrees were expanded into municipal administration, public law, child protection, and civic education as well as a master's degree in social sciences. The first faculty, the Faculty of Social Sciences, was established in 1949 and the number of students steadily increased from 227 in 1940 to 661 in 1950. The programmes offered by the school grew, such as degrees in social and youth work, librarianship and economics as well as a prison officer's diploma. The first doctoral degree was completed in 1955 and in 1956, the City of Tampere and the School of Social Sciences agreed on relocating the school to Tampere. By 1960, the number of students had increased to 933 and the School of Social Sciences moved to its new P√§√§talo main building, designed by Toivo Korhonen, at Kalevantie 4, Tampere. After the Faculty of Humanities and the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration were established in 1964 and 1965, respectively, the School of Social Sciences was renamed as the University of Tampere in 1966. A programme, called Tampere3, to merge the university with Tampere University of Technology and Tampere University of Applied Sciences was started in the spring of 2014. The merger was approved by Parliament in December 2017 and came into effect on 1 January 2019. The new foundation-based interdisciplinary higher education institution was named Tampere University after the proposed name of Tampere New University faced criticism.  Academics  A total of 14,712 degree students studied at the University of Tampere in 2016, including 11,810 students in bachelor's and master's degree programmes and 1,646 doctoral students. Likewise in 2016, the university received 17,482 applications of whom 1,418 were enrolled for an admission rate of 8.1%. It hosted four centres of excellence in research, such as on mitochondrial disease and in Russian studies, as of 2016. As of 2017, a tuition fee of approximately 10,000 euros was charged in general from non-European Union/European Economic Area citizens studying in the English-taught master's degree programmes with 50% or 100% cover scholarships available. Other students, such as exchange or doctoral students, were exempt from fees. The university was ranked 201‚Äì250 on the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2018. Likewise, it ranked 551-600 on the QS World University Rankings 2018 and 101-150 on its Communication and Media Studies category. Organisation Walpurgis Day festivities at the University's P√§√§talo building In 2016, the total budget of the University was 184.6 million euros, of which 108.8 million was core funding by the Government of Finland and 67.49 million was external endowments. In addition to its independent units, Finnish Social Science Data Archive (FSD), Laboratory Services, Language Centre and Library, the university was organized into six faculties as of a 1 January 2017 reorganization: * Faculty of Communication Sciences (COMS) * Faculty of Education (EDU) * Faculty of Management (JKK) * Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences (MED) * Faculty of Natural Sciences (LUO) * Faculty of Social Sciences (SOC)  Rectors  The following people served as rectors of the University of Tampere: * 1925‚Äì1932 Yrj√∂ Ruutu * 1932‚Äì1935 Eino Kuusi * 1935‚Äì1945 Yrj√∂ Ruutu * 1945‚Äì1948 Urpo Harva * 1948‚Äì1949 Antero Rinne * 1949‚Äì1953 Yrj√∂ Ruutu * 1953‚Äì1954 V.J.

The main campus hosted most of the faculties and comprised the P√§√§talo, Pinni, Linna and Virta buildings while the Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences and Laboratory Services are located at the Arvo building in the Kauppi campus. The P√§√§talo building was completed in 1960 and served as the University's first premises at Tampere. The Pinni complex was completed gradually during the 1990s and 2000s and the Linna and Virta buildings were ready for use in 2006 and 2009, respectively. The medicine-focused Arvo building was built in two separate phases reached in 2009 and 2016. The floor area of the university's facilities totaled 130,134 m2 as of 2016. Instead of dormitories at the campuses, the Tampere Student Housing Foundation rented apartments to students around Tampere.

The room contains numerous artifacts and documents, and is designed for opening in the year 8113 AD. During the 50th anniversary year of its sealing, the Guinness Book of World Records cited the crypt as the \\"first successful attempt to bury a record of this culture for any future inhabitants or visitors to the planet Earth.\\"Guinness Book of World Records (1990) Beginnings Thornwell Jacobs (1877-1956), referred to as \\"the father of the modern time capsule\\", claimed to be the first in modern times to conceive the idea of consciously preserving man-made objects for posterity by placing them in a sealed repository.Oglethorpe University president Thornwell Jacobs in an article of November 1936 Scientific American magazine.Jarvis, p. 350 Jacobs's inspiration for the project was sparked by the Egyptian pyramid and tomb openings in the 1920s. He was struck by the scarcity of historical information available from these ancient civilizations and imagined having a \\"running story\\" of the customs of human life from the beginning to the 1930s modern culture. Although the claim that 4241 BC (July 19) is the \\"earliest fixed date\\" has been discreditedGrimal, Nicolas. A History of Ancient Egypt. p.52. Librairie Arth√©me Fayard, 1988 since Jacobs, he noted that 6,177 years had passed between when the Egyptian calendar was established in 4241 BC and the present year (AD 1936). This figure served as the rationale for setting the opening of the crypt for 8113, as it was 6,177 years away. Jacobs‚Äôs Crypt of Civilization intrigued America and was duplicated by many others. In the mid-1930s, George Edward Pendray, a public relations executive for the Westinghouse Electric Company, was given an assignment to come up with a promotional event for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Pendray, also an amateur rocketeer, suggested burying a \\"time capsule\\", a sealed rocket-shaped vessel made of a metal alloy called \\"cupaloy\\". The Westinghouse time capsule is a rocket-shaped tube with a metal exterior that encapsulated articles in a Pyrex inner tube. Pendray‚Äôs project was originally named a \\"time bomb\\", but the name was later changed to time capsule. Pendray‚Äôs time capsule is scheduled to be opened in under 61 centuries.  Construction  The Crypt of Civilization chamber is positioned on Appalachian granite bedrock located in the foundation of Phoebe Hearst Memorial Hall, a granite Gothic-style academic building at Oglethorpe University. The room was converted from a swimming pool from 1937 to 1940, and the walls were lined with enamel plates embedded in pitch. The room is long, high and wide. The chamber is under a stone roof seven feet thick and lies over a two-foot stone floor. It is sealed with a stainless steel door welded in place. Thomas Kimmwood Peters (1884-1973) supervised construction and served as its archivist. Artifacts The National Bureau of Standards, Washington, D.C., gave professional and technical advice for the artifacts and construction of the crypt. The bureau also recommended how artifacts should be stored. Many artifacts are stored in stainless steel receptacles lined with glass and filled with an inert gas to prevent aging, a concept later carried over to the Westinghouse Time Capsules. The chamber resembles a cell of an Egyptian pyramid with artifacts positioned on shelves and the floor. The walls are lined with plaques containing illustrations by George L. Carlson in the form of pictographs that \\"tell the history of communications and explain how to access the treasures buried in the tomb.\\"Paul Tumey, \\"Figuring Out George Carlson\\". The Comics Journal, October 9, 2013. (Part 2 here. Many of the artifacts for the Crypt of Civilization were donated, including contributions from King Gustav V of Sweden and Eastman Kodak. Suggestions for items to include in the crypt included items varying from \\"a pair of garters\\" to \\"a can opener\\" to \\"a dry martini complete with olive\\".Literary Digest, October 31, 1936, pp. 19-20 Included in the crypt are airtight receptacles containing microfilm on cellulose acetate film containing more than 800 classic works of literature, including the Bible, the Quran, Homer's Iliad, and Dante's Inferno. There are approximately 640,000 pages included. A backup metal film system resides in the crypt as well. An original copy of the script for Gone With the Wind was donated by movie producer David O. Selznick to be included as well. The crypt also contains voice recordings of historical figures such as Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Benito Mussolini, and Franklin Roosevelt. Unusual sound clips were also included, such as the cartoon character Popeye the Sailor and a champion hog caller. Jacobs addressed those who will open the crypt in AD 8113 in a note hoping for future efforts for preservation, saying, \\"The world is engaged in burying our civilization forever, and here in this crypt we leave it to you.\\" Peters placed electric microfilm readers and projectors in the vault to enable viewing and listening to these recordings. He provided a generator operated by a windmill to drive the apparatus, as well as a seven-power magnifier to read the microfilm records by hand in the event that the current form of electricity is not in use in AD 8113. Peters even included some current-day scientific instruments. Unusual artifacts included are seed samples, dental floss, the contents of a woman's purse, some Artie Shaw records, an electric toaster, a pacifier, a specially sealed bottle of Budweiser beer, a typewriter, a radio, a cash register, an adding machine, a set of Lincoln Logs, and plastic toys of Donald Duck, the Lone Ranger, and a Black doll. Some of the last items placed in the Crypt of Civilization were steel plates of the Atlanta Journal newspaper reporting on World War II. Promotion Jacobs spoke on nationwide radio on NBC in New York City in 1937 to promote the crypt. A dedication ceremony on the Oglethorpe University campus, led by David Sarnoff of the Radio Corporation of America occurred in May, 1938. Peters included segments of Paramount newsreel films of this occasion in the crypt as well as film he had created about the crypt entitled The Stream of Knowledge (1938). On May 25, 1940, Jacobs and Peters sealed the crypt in a solemn ceremony that was broadcast by Atlanta's WSB radio. Notable figures present at the ceremony included Dr. Amos Ettinger, Dr. M. D. Collins, Mayor William B. Hartsfield, Ivan Allen, Jr., Clark Howell, Governor Eurith D. Rivers, and Postmaster General James A. Farley. The door was welded shut, and a plaque was fused to it with a Message to the Generations of 8113 from Jacobs. This Crypt contains memorials of the civilization which existed in the United States and the world at large during the first half of the twentieth century. In receptacles of stainless steel, in which the air has been replaced by inert gases, are encyclopedias, histories, scientific works, special editions of newspapers, travelogues, travel talks, cinema reels, models, phonograph records, and similar materials from which an idea of the state and nature of the civilization which existed from 1900 to 1950 can be ascertained. No jewels or precious metals are included. We depend upon the laws of the county of DeKalb, the State of Georgia, and the government of the United States and their heirs, assigns, and successors, and upon the sense of sportsmanship of posterity for the continued preservation of this vault until the year 8113, at which time we direct that it shall be opened by authorities representing the above governmental agencies and the administration of Oglethorpe University. Until that time we beg of all persons that this door and the contents of the crypt within may remain inviolate. Peters included a machine called a \\"Language Integrator\\" in front of the sealed chamber to teach the openers how to speak English, which was another concept carried on to the Westinghouse Time Capsules. An entry from Jacobs's diary in April, 1937, reads, \\"We have been in 'Time' . . . 'Reader's Digest', Walter Winchell's radio column ... and in newspapers from London to Australia.Jacobs autobiography 1945, p. 512 After sealing There have been numerous retrospectives on the Crypt of Civilization by the Associated Press, ABC, NBC, CNN, NPR, the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, The New York Times and others since the seal date. After the sealing of the crypt in 1940, media organizations continued to re-visit the crypt in news stories every decade. The International Time Capsule Society was formed at Oglethorpe University in 1990 on the fiftieth anniversary of the sealing of the Crypt of Civilization. This organization studies the variety of time capsules created worldwide. The Crypt of Civilization regained prominence in millennium observances from 1999 to 2001. It was featured on television and covered by numerous newspapers. The crypt was featured in an episode of Life After People: The Series on the History Channel.

The Enterprise-D also appears in the pilot episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (\\"Emissary\\"), the series finale of Star Trek: Enterprise (\\"These Are the Voyages...\\"), and the movie Star Trek Generations. The Enterprise-D is a Galaxy-class ship and the fifth Federation starship in the Star Trek universe to carry the name Enterprise. Enterprise-D is the flagship of Starfleet. The commanding officer is Captain Jean-Luc Picard for the majority of the ship's service. In Star Trek Generations, after combat with the Duras sisters' ship, the ship's stardrive section was destroyed and the saucer section crash-landed on the surface of the planet Veridian III and had to be abandoned, resulting in its \\"destroyed\\" status. Design Andrew Probert, who helped update the original Enterprise for Star Trek: The Motion Picture, designed the Enterprise-D. Originally assigned to design the bridge, Probert had a \\"what if\\" sketch hanging on his wall that he had drawn after working on The Motion Picture. Story editor David Gerrold saw the sketch and brought it to creator Gene Roddenberry's attention, who approved the sketch as a starting point for the Enterprise-D's design. Probert received a design patent on the Enterprise-D design in 1990. An Industrial Light & Magic team supervised by Ease Owyeung built two filming miniatures (a model and a model) for \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\", the Star Trek: The Next Generation pilot, and these models were used throughout the first two seasons. For the third season, model-maker Greg Jein built a miniature, which had an added layer of surface plating detail. The model was used whenever a saucer separation sequence needed to be filmed, and it was then updated by ILM for use in Star Trek Generations. Jonathan Frakes said, \\"When we negotiate our contracts, Paramount's company line is that the ship is in fact the star of the show!\\" In October 2006, the Enterprise shooting miniature was auctioned in New York City at Christie's auction house, along with other models, props, costumes, and set pieces from the Star Trek franchise. Its projected value was $20,000 to $30,000, but the final sale price was $576,000 ‚Äì the most expensive item in the auction. ILM's John Knoll also built a CGI Electric Image model of the Enterprise-D for the film Star Trek Generations (1994). That model was transferred to LightWave and used to create various Galaxy-class starships in episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and in the Star Trek: Voyager episode \\"Timeless\\". Eden FX's Gabriel K√∂erner built a new CGI LightWave model for the Enterprise-D's appearance in Star Trek: Enterprise's series finale, \\"These Are the Voyages...\\". The proportions of the Galaxy-class Enterprise-D were different from the original Enterprise while retaining its familiar dual warp nacelles and saucer section appearance. The nacelles were made proportionally smaller than the saucer section, based on the idea that warp engines would have become more efficient over time. Depiction The Enterprise-D is first seen in the episode \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" under the command of Captain Jean- Luc Picard. Several episodes, as well as the ship's dedication plaque, establish that the Enterprise was built at the Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards in orbit around Mars. The Enterprise-D is the third Galaxy-class starship, after the pathfinder ship USS Galaxy and the USS Yamato. The dedication plaque gives its commissioning date as 40759.5, which was intended to represent October 4, 2363, which would be the 406th anniversary of the launch of Sputnik, humanity's first spacecraft. During the Star Trek: The Next Generation series, the ship's crew makes first contact with many species, including the Borg in \\"Q Who\\" and the Q Continuum in \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\". The Enterprise-D is instrumental in the defeat of the Borg during their 2366 attempt to invade the Federation in \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part II\\". The Enterprise's saucer section crash landing In 2371, as depicted in Star Trek Generations, the Klingon Duras sisters obtain the phase modulation frequency of the Enterprise-D's shields, rendering them useless. Although the Enterprise-D destroys the sisters' ship, damage to the warp drive coolant system prompts an emergency saucer separation. The warp core breaches moments after the saucer begins to move away, destroying the ship's stardrive section. The resulting shock wave disables the saucer's propulsion and other primary systems, sending it into Veridian III's atmosphere. Caught in the planet's gravity, the saucer section crash lands on the surface, damaged beyond repair. It was replaced by the Enterprise-E, which was introduced in the film Star Trek: First Contact. According to commentary on the Star Trek Generations DVD, one of the real world reasons for the Enterprise-D's destruction stems from a concept drawing of a saucer section landing, produced for the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual. TNG writers Ronald D. Moore, Jeri Taylor and Brannon Braga saw the drawing and wanted to use a saucer crash as a sixth-season cliffhanger episode for the series, but were unable to do so because of a limited budget and resistance from producer Michael Piller. =Alternate future= In the alternate future depicted in the TNG series finale \\"All Good Things...\\", the Enterprise-D is intact in 2395. The personal flagship of Admiral William Riker, the ship has undergone major refits, including the addition of a third warp nacelle, new weapons, and a cloaking device. This future timeline arises from a temporal anomaly that Picard, with Q's help, manages to eliminate. Technical capabilities During the time of its service, the Enterprise-D was the flagship of the Federation Starfleet. A Galaxy-class starship, it was a large, long-range exploratory ship with 42 decks and a usual complement of 1,014 crew and civilians (e.g., their family members) but it was capable of carrying over 6,000 personnel. =Starship separation= The Galaxy-class Enterprise was capable of separating into two ships: the saucer section, with most of the ship's complement and accommodations, could separate from the stardrive (or engineering) section, featuring the warp reactor core and the bulk of the weaponry. The saucer section was sometimes used to evacuate its non-essential complement while the stardrive section went into combat, as seen in The Next Generation episodes \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" and \\"The Arsenal of Freedom.\\" This feature also conferred an advantage of having two vessels in combat instead of one as in \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part II,\\", or acting as a lifeboat as seen in the film Star Trek Generations.Star Trek Generations, (1994) The Enterprise-D was the only starship seen in any of the television series to separate until the USS Prometheus during the fourth season of Star Trek: Voyager. =Command= The main bridge replicated for exhibition The main bridge of the Galaxy-class Enterprise is on Deck 1. Three distinct Galaxy-class bridge variants have been seen with a fourth from the alternate future variant of the series finale: the Enterprise bridge in The Next Generation (which undergoes a redesign in the first two seasons), the Enterprise bridge in Star Trek Generations, and the USS Odyssey bridge in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"The Jem'Hadar\\". The Galaxy-class Enterprise also has a secondary battle bridge on Deck 8 of the secondary hull, for use when the saucer separates. It is first seen in the TNG episode \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" and again in \\"The Arsenal of Freedom\\", with an updated version appearing in \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\". =Science and research= The aft stations on the bridge, from left to right: Science I, Science II, Environment, Mission Ops, and Engineering The Galaxy-class Enterprise supports an array of scientific disciplines, with laboratories and departments devoted to stellar cartography, exobiology, cetology, astrophysics, cybernetics, archaeology, cultural anthropology, botany, hydroponics, and planetary geosciences. =Tactical= The Galaxy-class Enterprise is armed with twelve Type-X phaser arrays and three photon torpedo launchers, each capable of firing 10 torpedoes at a time. One phaser array is mounted on the \\"cobra head\\" of the secondary hull while a photon torpedo launcher is mounted on the ventral aft of the saucer; both are inoperative while the saucer and stardrive sections are docked. The ship also has a high-capacity shield grid and, according to dialogue in the Next Generation episode \\"Conundrum\\", at least 250 photon torpedoes. =Transportation= The Galaxy-class Enterprise has at least eight transporter rooms and 20 transporter systems. The ship has one large main shuttle bay in the saucer section, supported by two smaller bays in the stardrive section. The ship carries a variety of shuttlecraft and a captain's yacht (according to Patrick Stewart, the yacht is named Calypso, after Jacques Cousteau's research vessel; though visible on the underside of the Enterprise saucer, it did not make an appearance during the series). =Medical and life support systems= Biobeds in sickbay The Galaxy-class Enterprise includes a sickbay and a number of labs and other medical facilities. The shuttlebays, cargo bays, and other areas of the ship can be converted into triage wards; such conversion of a cargo bay appears in the TNG episode \\"Ethics\\". Other areas, such as Ten Forward, can serve as emergency shelters. Such use of Ten Forward occurs in the Next Generation episode \\"Disaster\\". =Crew support= Saucer section officer's quarters Various Next Generation episodes show that the Galaxy-class Enterprise has amenities such as holodecks, an arboretum, a school, a gymnasium, amphitheaters, and a bar called Ten Forward. According to \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\", several Enterprise crewmembers' civilian family members (including children) are aboard even though the Enterprise routinely faces situations that could easily end with the complete destruction of the ship with all hands. Some civilians work aboard the ship, such as the bartender Ben in \\"Lower Decks\\" and botanist Keiko O'Brien in \\"Rascals\\" and other episodes.  Reception  In 2018, Io9/Gizmodo ranked the fictional spacecraft design, the Enterprise-D, as the 5th best version of starship Enterprise of the Star Trek franchise. In 2019, SyFy ranked the fictional starship design, the NCC-1701-D Enterprise as the second best version of the starship in the Star Trek science fiction universe.

It made its debut in the final scene of the 1986 film Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. Origin and design Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston had hoped the Enterprise's destruction in The Search for Spock would open the door to designing a new model for future films. However, producers for Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986) decided to have the crew return to a duplicate of their previous ship. Although a new model was not created, it took Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) more than six weeks to restore and repaint the ship to appear as the new USS Enterprise, NCC-1701-A. Although the original bridge set had been refurbished and repainted to serve as the bridge for the Enterprise-A , it was scrapped in favor of a completely new bridge set for the fifth film. The sleek \\"Okudagrams\\" created for this Enterprise-A bridge, were later adopted in subsequent films and television spin-offs. When production began on Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987‚Äì1994), several interior Enterprise sets, such as the bridge, were redressed for use on the television show. Later, some Next Generation sets, such as the Enterprise-D's engine room and conference room, were modified to depict interiors of the Enterprise-A. Depiction The Constitution-class starship Enterprise-A was commissioned in 2286, at the end of the events depicted in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home and is the second Constitution-class Federation starship to carry the name Enterprise. While the ship's history before its recommissioning as Enterprise has never been officially stated, several non-canon sources (such as the AMT/Ertl Model kit documentation) have claimed it to formerly be USS Yorktown (NCC-1717); others cite it as the newly built (but not yet commissioned) former USS Ti-Ho (NCC-1798), or the also newly built USS Atlantis. The ship is placed under the command of newly demoted Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), who is \\"punished\\" for his and his crew's actions in the rescue of Spock (Leonard Nimoy) in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, but allowed to resume command due to their rescue of Earth in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. It replaces the original Enterprise (NCC-1701), destroyed in Star Trek III. Though outwardly identical to its refitted and updated predecessor, in its debut, the new ship is beset with teething problems and Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott and Commander Uhura are shown making numerous repairs and reconfigurations to the new ship before deployment. Replica of Enterprise-A in Vulcan, Alberta In Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, the ship is dispatched to rescue hostages on Nimbus III. The Vulcan renegade Sybok (Laurence Luckinbill) and his followers hijack the ship and take it to a planet at the center of the galaxy, where Kirk and his crew eventually regain control of the ship. Several novels and comics explore the six-year period between the fifth and sixth films. In Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Enterprise escorts Klingon chancellor Gorkon (David Warner) to a peace summit on Earth. The renegade Klingon general Chang (Christopher Plummer), assisted by traitors aboard Enterprise, makes it appear that Enterprise had fired on the chancellor's vessel. The Klingons take Kirk and Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) prisoner; Spock and Enterprise crew disregard Starfleet orders and instead rescue Kirk and McCoy. Enterprise encounters and, with aid from Captain Sulu and the USS Excelsior, destroys Chang's ship, and the crew protects the Federation President from an assassination attempt. There is no canon information about the ship's fate beyond Star Trek VI. In the epilogue of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Uhura had stated they received a communication from Starfleet Command that ordered Enterprise to report to space dock to be decommissioned. However, she may have been speaking only of the ship's original crew members as Captain James T. Kirk previously stated his crew was due to stand down in three months, while Spock noted this would be his last voyage on Enterprise as a member of her crew; and Captain Kirk states in his closing log entry the ship \\"will become the care of another crew,\\" but no further information is given. Documentation provided with the Bandai model states that the ship was displayed in the Starfleet Museum at Memory Alpha. According to the non-canon novel The Ashes of Eden, written by William Shatner, Starfleet Commander-in- Chief Androvar Drake orders Enterprise-A decommissioned and destroyed during war games and weapons testing, but the Chal government intervenes. Ultimately, Enterprise is destroyed to prevent Drake's completion of a disastrous personal agenda. =Kelvin timeline= Enterprise (NCC-1701-A) was already under construction at the time of its predecessor's arrival at Starbase Yorktown. Following the destruction of its predecessor, its crew was reassigned to the NCC-1701-A after its completion. A new design for Enterprise NCC-1701-A appears in Star Trek Beyond, designed by Sean Hargreaves. Hargreaves, who also designed the swarm ships and USS Franklin for the film, stated that he was given the brief to \\"beef up the neck and arms\\" on the Ryan Church design.

It is 18 km from Ennis and 20 km from Limerick. It was established in 1959, as the world's first \\"modern\\" Free Trade Zone. Businesses based on the site enjoyed special tax incentives on staff and profits until 2003, which attracted a large number of multinational companies to the area. History In the late 1950s, Shannon Airport was almost entirely dependent on transit passengers and refuelling for trans-Atlantic flights. With indicators that commercial aircraft would soon have the range to bypass the airport, the airport's then director, Brendan O'Regan, submitted a proposal for a special manufacturing and tax incentive zone to be created in the vicinity of the airport. This would create employment and promote Shannon Airport as a destination for air traffic in itself. The site adjacent to the airport was established in 1959, with a second zone, Smithstown, following a number of years later. The Shannon Free Zone was intended to attract investment in exchange for tax incentives and tariff reductions. While many of these incentives have since ceased, as of 2019, there were reportedly over 100 international firms employing over 8,000 people based at the Shannon Free Zone. Companies who have invested at Shannon have included Element Six (formerly DeBeers Industrial Diamonds), GECAS, GE Sensing, Intel, Lufthansa Technik, Zimmer and UCB. Until 2014, the Shannon Free Zone was managed by Shannon Development, an Irish government agency. As of 2020, it is managed by Shannon Commercial Properties, a commercial semi- state company and part of Shannon Group plc.

II, p. 239 Although in his time he was an often-performed American nationalist composer, his works are seldom played now. Today he is best known as the teacher of other important composers, including Aaron Copland and George Gershwin. Early life Rubin Goldmark was born in New York City in 1872, a nephew of composer Karl Goldmark, and of Jewish heritage. Goldmark completed his undergraduate studies at City College in New York. After completing his studies in the United States in 1889, Goldmark traveled to Austria, where he studied at the Vienna Conservatory until 1891. There he studied piano and composition, the former with Livonius, the latter with Johann Nepomuk Fuchs. Return to the United States After the conclusion of his studies in Vienna, Goldmark returned to United States. From 1891 to 1893 he taught piano and music theory at the National Conservatory in New York City. While in New York, Goldmark also studied composition with Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k and piano with Rafael Joseffy. Goldmark moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado, hoping to improve his poor health, and was the director of the Colorado Conservatory of Music from 1895 to 1901.Baker, Baker's Biographical Dictionary, eighth edition, p. 644 Upon Goldmark's return to New York in 1902, he focused much of his energy on teaching. Over the 30-year period that Goldmark remained in New York he gave over five hundred lectures on music, music theory, and composition. That is not to say he ceased composing all together ‚Äì while Goldmark's music lies out of the standard repertoire of the twentieth century, he was highly regarded by his contemporaries. He was also the founder and frequent speaker at The Bohemians, a New York musicians' club. Teaching career While Goldmark began his career as a composer and pianist, he is best known for his work as a teacher. When not lecturing, or composing, however, Goldmark taught several private students. Famously, Goldmark taught a fifteen-year-old Aaron Copland and the young George Gershwin. Though Copland was often critical of Goldmark because he found him \\"too pedantic and academic\\", Goldmark gave Copland a strong foundation which Copland would rely upon for the rest of his career (Howard, 252). The young George Gershwin also turned to Goldmark during the composition of his piano concerto. While his Rhapsody in Blue had been orchestrated by Ferde Grof√©, he wished to orchestrate his piano concerto himself, and sought Goldmark's advice (Howard, 249). Goldmark's influence as a teacher extended beyond just Gershwin and Copland. In 1924, Goldmark became the Head of Composition at the recently opened Juilliard School of Music in New York City. Other notable students include composers Fannie Charles Dillon, Sammy Timberg, Vittorio Giannini, Frederick Jacobi and Alexei Haieff. Musical works Though seldom performed today, Goldmark's music was performed regularly during his lifetime. In fact, his Negro Rhapsody was among the most performed pieces in the seven years following World War I. In 1910, he was also awarded the 1909 Paderewski Prize for Chamber Music. His other important works include Hiawatha, The Call of the Plains, and his Requiem. Goldmark's nationalism is clearly evident from many of the titles of his works ‚Äì even the ambiguously titled Requiem (perf. 1919) was inspired by Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Goldmark's other compositions include a string quartet, a piano trio, a violin sonata, several orchestral pieces, piano music, and songs.

History  The band came together after Squire met Page by chance at a party shortly before Christmas 1980. The group also featured former Greenslade keyboard player and vocalist Dave Lawson. Squire was the main writer for the group. Page believed the band needed a strong vocalist and sought out former Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant.

Life Cantalupo was born in Oak Park, Illinois, the eldest child in a family of Irish and Italian descent. His father was an optometrist and mother a homemaker. Cantalupo earned a degree in accounting from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity. He married, and had a daughter and son. Career He became a certified public accountant and worked for Arthur Young for eight years, where McDonald's was a client. He was offered the job of controller with a substantial salary increase with the then fast growing McDonald's before taking a month to decide, finally joining in 1974. In the same year he was promoted to vice president and senior vice president in 1981. He became president of McDonald's International in 1987 and its CEO in 1991.

It is located to the southeast of the Prophet's Mosque, which contains the graves of some of Muhammad's family and friends. It is also known as Baqƒ´ ø al-Gharqad (, meaning \\"Baqi ø of the Boxthorn\\"). The grounds hold much significance for Muslims, being the resting place of many of Muhammad's relatives and companions, thus making it as one of the two holiest cemeteries in Islamic tradition. Many narrations relate Muhammad issuing a prayer every time he passed it. History When Muhammad arrived at Medina from Mecca in September 622 CE, al-Baqi' was a land covered with Lycium shawii boxthorn trees. According to historical records, after the arrival of Muhammad, the houses of Medina developed near al-Baqi', which was therefore considered as the public tomb. The bramble-growth was cleared and the place consecrated to be the future cemetery of the Muslims who died at al-Madina. Also al-Baqi' was introduced as somewhere whose east side is Nakhl and west side contains houses. In fact, before demolition al-Baqi' was located behind the houses in the city. During the construction of the Prophet's Mosque, on the site he purchased from two orphan children when he arrived after his migration from Mecca to Medina, Es'ad bin Zurarah, one of Muhammad's companions died. Muhammad chose the spot to be a cemetery and Es'ad was the first individual to be buried in al-Baqi' among the Ansar. While Muhammad was outside Medina for the Battle of Badr, his daughter Ruqayyah fell sick and died in 624. She was buried in al-Baqi'. She was the first person from Ahl al-Bayt (Household of Muhammad) buried in this cemetery. Shortly after Muhammad arrived from Badr, Uthman bin Maz'oon died in 5/626-7 and was buried in al-Baqi'. He was considered the first companion of Muhammad from the Muhajirun to be buried in the cemetery. He was also called by the Prophet to be the first 'among us to go to the hereafter', and he also called the place where he is buried RawhƒÅ. When his son died, he commanded that he be buried there also; he watered the grave and called this place ZawrƒÅ. Initially, Caliph Uthman ibn AffanTextual Sources for the Study of Islam, by Knappert, Jan, and Andrew Rippin was buried in the huge neighbouring Jewish graveyard. The first enlargement of al-Baqi' in history was made by Muawiyah I, the first Umayyad Caliph. In order to honour Uthman ibn Affan, Muawiyah included the huge Jewish graveyard into al-Baqi' cemetery. The Umayyad Caliphate built the first dome in al-Baqi' over his grave. During different times of history, many domes and structures were built or rebuilt over many famous graves in al-Baqi'. =Demolition= First demolition The cemetery was demolished by forces loyal to the Wahhabi-Saudi alliance in 1806 and 1925 (or 1926). At the beginning of the Wahhabis of Najd's nineteenth century (1806) control over Mecca and Medina, they demolished many of the religious buildings including tombs and mosques, whether inside or outside the Baqi, in accordance with their doctrine. These were razed to the ground and plundered for their decorations and goods.  Second demolition The clan of Saud regained control of the Hijaz in 1924 or 1925. The following year King Ibn Saud granted permission to destroy the site with religious authorization provided by Qadi Abd Allah ibn Bulayhid, and the demolition began on 21 April 1926 (or 1925) by Ikhwan (\\"The Brothers\\"), a Wahabbi religious militia. The demolition included destroying \\"even the simplest of the gravestones\\". British convert Eldon Rutter compared the demolition to an earthquake: \\"All over the cemetery nothing was to be seen but little indefinite mounds of earth and stones, pieces of timber, iron bars, blocks of stone, and a broken rubble of cement and bricks, strewn about.\\" The second demolition was discussed in Majles-e Shora-ye Melli (The National Consultative Assembly of Iran) and a group of representatives was sent to Hijaz to investigate. In recent years, efforts were made by Iranian religious scholars and political figures to restore the cemetery and its shrines. Both Sunni and Shia protested against the destruction and rallies are held annually. The day is regarded as Yaum-e Gham (\\"Day of Sorrow\\"). Prominent Sunni theologians and intellectuals have condemned the \\"unfit\\" situation of the Baqi cemetery but the Saudi authorities have so far ignored all criticism and rejected any requests for restoration of the tombs and mausoleums. Though nowadays the situation of the Baqi is better than the time of demolition but there was acrimony in the memories of the Muslims who visited there in the past. =People of Prophet Muhammad that are buried there= * Halimah the milk-mother and nurse of Muhammad * All of the wives of Muhammad, except Khadijah bint Khuwaylid and Maymunah bint al-Harith who are buried in Jannatul Mualla in Mecca and at Sarif respectively. * Ibrahim, Muhammad's son by Maria al-Qibtiyya, died in infancy * Roqayyah, Umm Kulthum and Zainab daughters of Muhammad and Khadija * Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad is purportedly buried there, though the location of her grave is disputed.Lady Fatima , Islamic Insight, Accessed September 1, 2012. * Fatima bint al-Asad, aunt of Muhammad and mother of Caliph Ali. * ‚ÄòAbbas ibn ‚ÄòAbd al- Muttalib, uncle of Muhammad. * Umm ul-Banin, who married Caliph Ali after the death of Fatimah and Safiyyah, Atika aunts of Muhammad. * Hasan ibn Ali, grandson of Muhammad, son of Fatimah bint Muhammad and Imam Ali. * Zayn al- Abidin, the grandson of Fatima bint Muhammad who is the only adult male that survived the Battle of Karbala because he was sick and could not fight. * Muhammad al-Baqir, son of ‚ÄòAlƒ´ ibn ·∏§usayn. * Ja'far as-Sadiq, son of Muhammad al-Baqir. * Abdullah son of Jaffar at-Tayyar, who was husband of Zainab, daughter of Ali and nephew of Ali *(martyrs of Karbala). * Aqeel ibn Abi Talib, the elder brother of Ali. * Uthman ibn Affan, early companion, second cousin, twice son-in-law of Muhammad, brother-in-law of first Imam Ali and third Sunni Caliph.

Dickson has placed fifteen albums in the UK Albums Chart from 1977 to date, and had a number of hit singles, including four which reached the Top 20 in the UK Singles Chart. The Scotsman newspaper has described her as Scotland's best-selling female singer in terms of the numbers of hit chart singles and albums she has achieved in the UK since 1976. She is also a two- time Olivier Award-winning actress, with roles including Viv Nicholson in the musical Spend Spend Spend, and she was the original Mrs. Johnstone in Willy Russell's long-running musical Blood Brothers. On TV she starred as Anita Braithwaite in Band of Gold. Career = Early years = Dickson went to Woodmill High School and Dunfermline High School in Dunfermline. Previously she lived in \\"Dollytown\\", Rosyth, a prefab housing estate that was demolished in early 1970, and Dunfermline in the 1960s. Her father was a cook on a tugboat at Rosyth Dockyard and her mother was from Liverpool. She went to Camdean Primary School. and Pitcorthie Primary School when she moved to Dunfermline. Dickson's singing career started in folk clubs around her native Fife in 1964. Her first commercial recording was in 1968. Her early work included albums with Archie Fisher, the first of which, The Fate O' Charlie, a collection of songs from the Jacobite rebellions, was released in 1969. Her first solo album was Do Right Woman in 1970. = Mainstream success = She became a well-known face on the British folk circuit of the late 1960s and early 1970s, but changed her career course after meeting Willy Russell. He was at that time a young student running a folk club in Liverpool. He showed Dickson the first draft of what later became the award-winning musical John, Paul, George, Ringo ‚Ä¶ and Bert and asked her to perform the music. The combination of fine writing, a superb cast of young unknowns (including Antony Sher, Bernard Hill and Trevor Eve) and Dickson's idiosyncratic interpretation of Beatles songs made the show hugely successful. The show's co-producer, Robert Stigwood, signed Dickson to his record label, RSO Records, where she recorded the album Answer Me, arranged and produced by Junior Campbell, the title track becoming a Top 10 hit in 1976. John, Paul, George, Ringo ‚Ä¶ and Bert also led to her guest residency on The Two Ronnies, which brought Dickson's singing to the attention of more than ten million BBC Television viewers every week. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice also spotted Dickson in John, Paul, George, Ringo ‚Ä¶ and Bert, and invited her to record \\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\\" from their new musical Evita, which became her second hit in 1977. She contributed two tracks to Scouse the Mouse a children's album (1977) with Ringo Starr and others. Also during the late 1970s, Dickson also contributed backing vocals to two best-selling albums by the Scottish singer-songwriter, Gerry Rafferty: City to City (1978) and Night Owl (1979). Other solo hits including \\"Caravan Song\\" and \\"January February\\", followed for Dickson in 1980. An abridged version of the song \\"Best of Friends\\", sung by Dickson, was used as the closing theme for Andy Robson, an ITV children's television series broadcast during 1982 and 1983. It was never released commercially. In 1982, Willy Russell invited Dickson to star in his new musical Blood Brothers in the pivotal role of the mother, Mrs. Johnstone. Although at first reluctant to accept, having never acted before, she accepted and garnered critical acclaim as well as 'Actress of the Year in a Musical' from the Society of West End Theatres in 1984. She has reprised the role many times, the latest being 2004 at the Liverpool Empire Theatre. Later in 1984, Tim Rice approached Dickson to take part in the recording of the concept album for the musical Chess in the role of Svetlana. Dickson's songs on the album included \\"I Know Him So Well\\", a duet sung with Elaine Paige. The song was a worldwide hit, and remained at number one in the UK Singles Chart for four weeks. It is still cited in the Guinness World Records as the best-selling female duet of all-time. In 1984, Dickson starred in her own television special for BBC2, in which she travels around Scotland. = 1990s and beyond = During the 1990s, Dickson appeared in various television dramas including Taggart, Band of Gold and The Missing Postman. The writer and director Chris Bond created a stage show for Dickson in 1996 called The Seven Ages of Woman, which won her the Liverpool Echo 'Actress of the Year Award'. It premiered at the Liverpool Playhouse and toured extensively in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, Dickson starred in Spend Spend Spend, a new musical by Steve Brown and Justin Greene. The show, based on the rollercoaster life story of pools winner, Viv Nicholson, played in the West End to capacity audiences. For her portrayal of Nicholson, she was awarded 'Best Actress in a Musical' at the 2000 Laurence Olivier Awards. She went on to star in the UK tour of the show. Further theatre work followed in Friends Like This, the Heather Brothers musical A Slice of Saturday Night and Fame. During 2006, Dickson appeared as the Timekeeper in Alan Ayckbourn and Denis King's fantasy musical play Whenever for BBC Radio 4. She has returned to TV in the BBC daytime drama series Doctors and her episode, \\"Mama Sings The Blues\\", was broadcast in March 2008. In 2003, Dickson worked with Russell again, providing backing vocals for his album Hoovering the Moon. In 2004 The Platinum Collection, featuring some of her most successful recordings, reached number 35 in the UK Albums Chart. Her 2004 album, Full Circle, was produced and arranged by Troy Donockley, and saw Dickson returning to her folk roots. In 2006, she issued a collection of the songs of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, Nothing's Gonna Change My World. = Recent career = Dickson's twenty-fourth studio album, Time and Tide, was released in January 2008 featuring a mix of contemporary and folk songs, including \\"Palm Sunday\\", which marked Dickson's return to songwriting after a break of almost twenty years. A live DVD, Into the Light, was released to coincide with the release of Time and Tide and included, as well as some of her best-loved hits, several tracks from her new album. A double live CD, Barbara Dickson in Concert, was released in April 2009 and was followed later in the year by her autobiography, A Shirtbox Full of Songs. Between February and March 2011, Dickson undertook a tour of the UK and Ireland to promote her new studio album, Words Unspoken. Arranged and produced by Troy Donockley, the album included tracks such as \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\", \\"Jamie Raeburn\\" and \\"The Trees They Do Grow High\\". A tribute album to her friend Gerry Rafferty ‚Äì To Each And Everyone ‚Äì The Songs of Gerry Rafferty ‚Äì was released in September 2013 and her most recent album, 'Winter', a collection of seasonal favourites, was released in time for Christmas 2014.

It is currently in a private collection. It was displayed in the Salon of Paris in 1890, the year Bouguereau was President of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais.Wissman, \\"Bouguereau,\\" 82-91. The painting features Greek mythological figures Eros and Psych√©, sharing an embrace and kiss. Bouguereau was a Classical-style painter in the Neoclassical era of art. The painting is characterized by the frothy background the figures delicately stand on. It depicts the beginning of the forbidden romance of Cupid and Psyche, a popular subject at the time of execution.  Erroneous name  One of the first virtual galleries on the Internet was the Web Museum. It placed the painting mistakenly as The First Kiss with the date 1873 instead of L'Amour et Psyche, enfants with the date 1890. If you see the image of the painting lower right you can see the date 1890 near the name of the author. Detail of Bouguereau's signature with the date 1890 Subject Matter The resurgence of interest in Classical Greek and Roman mythology of the mid-eighteenth century gave way for the renderings to the story of Cupid and Psyche. The daughter of a King and Queen, Psyche was born with beauty that led to men worshipping her. This angered Venus, Cupid's mother and Goddess of Beauty. She sent Cupid to prick her with his arrow, forcing her to fall in love with a hideous creature as revenge. Instead, Cupid scratches himself with his own arrow and falls in love with Psyche. He marries her in secrecy on the condition that she may never see his face. He flees when her curiosity gets the better of her. Psyche roams the earth and underworld in search of her lover. They eventually reunite and she is granted the gift of immortality.Cavendish, \\"Man, Myth and Magic.\\" Their triumph over adversity from Venus and their differences in mortality makes this theme popular. William Bouguereau chooses to portray the characters of Cupid and Psyche as young children, almost babies. Cupid, the Roman interpretation of Eros, is often portrayed as a fantastic, mischievous winged baby with a bow and arrow. Eros, the Greek equivalent, is often depicted as a young man, which is when the love affair between him and Psyche plays out. Instead, we see Cupid as a baby, Psyche is also portrayed as a young child, though typically through art history she is seen as a young woman. Bouguereau chooses to paint her with butterfly wings, for psyche was the Greek word given to butterflies by Aristotle.Manos-Jones, The Spirit of Butterflies: Myth, Magic, and Art,\\" 47. Psyche is a symbol to the transformation of the human soul, as she transforms from human to immortal. The decision to paint the characters as children is a reference to their innocence, before the corruption of their affair by Venus. This depiction would have been widely accepted in the Salon it was shown at. Bouguereau applied this story in multiple paintings of his, depicting them as the young lovers we are more familiar with. Composition The characters of Cupid and Psyche are fixed onto a long, vertical canvas. They appear long and larger than life. Cupid places a leg on a cloud for balance, and similarly balances the frame. Limbs interconnect in soft embraces. Bouguereau catches Cupid and Psyche in an inhale of breath, placing a light peck on Psyche's cheek. Her hand almost pushes Cupid away, and she looks down and away from him. The blue cloth floats behind them and onto the surrounding clouds. The focus is on the subjects, who are above the earthly realm and gracefully play in the sky. The style in which Bouguereau chooses to paint the children is articulated and meaningful. Their white flesh is luminous and rosy- a symbol to their purity.Elliott, \\"Traditional Oil Painting: Advanced Techniques and Concepts from the Renaissance to the Present,\\" 67-72. Wings sprout delicately from their shoulders. Bouguereau invokes whimsical elements of childhood and young love through the use of pastels and soft, velvety brushstrokes. The painting is mostly blue, an uncommon color for the portrayal of a love story.Ibid. By not using pink and reds, the painter steers away from the theme of forbidden love and towards the idea of young love. The colors are cool and crisp. Bouguereau takes care to accurately portray the pudginess of Cupid and Psyche. The painting is full of texture from the light fabrics, wispy golden hair, and smoothness of their skin. The painting doesn't strike the viewer but is a rest for the eyes.

It was sold at auction in 1888, after which the painting was displayed in the bar of the Hoffman House Hotel, New York City until 1901, when it was bought and stored in a warehouse, the buyer hoping to keep its 'offensive' content from the public. Robert Sterling Clark discovered the piece in storage and acquired it in 1942. The piece is currently on display at the Clark Art Institute located in Williamstown, Massachusetts. According to the Clark Institute, in the painting \\"a group of nymphs have been surprised, while bathing in a secluded pond, by a lascivious satyr. Some of the nymphs have retreated into the shadows on the right; others, braver than their friends, are trying to dampen the satyr's ardor by pulling him into the cold water -- one of the satyr's hooves is already wet and he clearly wants to go no further. Bouguereau‚Äôs working methods were traditional; he made a number of sketches and drawings of carefully posed human figures in complicated interconnected poses, linking them together in this wonderfully rhythmical composition.\\" The painting, the largest and one of the most beloved of the Clark collection, was cleaned prior to March 10, 2012 with the help of a grant from the Parnassus Foundation, courtesy of Jane and Raphael Bernstein.

Hackenbush (Groucho Marx), who - and unknown to Mrs. Upjohn - is actually a horse doctor. Tony overhears Mrs. Upjohn's praise of Hackenbush and immediately tells her that Dr. Hackenbush has been hired to run the sanitarium. Mrs. Upjohn is elated and informs Judy with Dr. Hackenbush in charge she will consider helping her financially. Tony then wires Dr. Hackenbush in Florida to come and care for Mrs. Upjohn at the sanitarium. Soon, Dr. Hackenbush arrives and instantly begins insulting the sanitarium's crooked business manager Mr. Whitmore (Leonard Ceeley). Whitmore, who is Morgan's right-hand man, is immediately suspicious of Hackenbush's medical background. Meanwhile, Judy's fianc√©, Gil Stewart (Allan Jones), who works singing in Morgan's nightclub, has just spent his life's savings on a racehorse named Hi-Hat. His hope is that the horse, which he purchased from Morgan, will win a big race and the prize money will allow Judy to save the sanitarium. Hi-Hat is so afraid of Morgan, that the horse rears in terror whenever he sees Morgan or hears his voice. Unfortunately, Gil now has no money to pay for Hi-Hat's feed, and he, Tony and Stuffy (Harpo Marx), Hi-Hat's jockey, have to resort to trickery to fend off the Sheriff (Robert Middlemass) who has come to the racetrack to collect money for the feed bill. Tony raises some money by scamming Hackenbush in the \\"Tutsi Fruitsy Ice Cream\\" scene, in which Tony gives Hackenbush a tip on a horse, but all in code, so that Hackenbush has to buy book after book from Tony to decipher the code. At the sanitarium, the suspicious Whitmore attempts to telephone the Florida Medical Board for information on Hackenbush's background. Hackenbush intercepts the call and by assuming a phony southern accent, feigning a hurricane with an electric fan and repeatedly calling Whitmore to the dictagraph, Hackenbush manages to enrage him to the point that Whitmore slams down the phone in frustration and gives up. At a night gala at which Gil performs along Vivien Fay and her ballet (‚ÄúOn Blue Venetian Waters‚Äù), Hackenbush invites a blonde floozie named \\"Flo\\" (Esther Muir) and Mrs. Upjohn to his room at the sanitarium without the latter knowing of the other woman. Being persecuted, Tony and Stuffy blend with the musicians and perform their signature Chico/Harpo musical performances, including a scene in which Stuffy tears a piano apart in anger. Whitmore attempts to get Hackenbush fired by having Mrs. Upjohn catch him in a compromising situation with Flo. Hackenbush is rescued by Stuffy and Tony who overhear the plot, then pose as house detectives and then as paperhangers. They make a complete shambles of Hackenbush's suite with layers of wallpaper and buckets of paste; Mrs. Upjohn and Whitmore arrive, but the woman is nowhere to be seen, having been stuffed under the cushions of the sofa. The following day, just as Mrs. Upjohn is about to sign an agreement to help Judy, Whitmore brings in an eminent Viennese physician, Dr. Leopold X. Steinberg (Sig Ruman), whom he hopes will examine Mrs. Upjohn and discredit Hackenbush. After Mrs. Upjohn agrees to the examination, Hackenbush wants to flee for fear of being exposed as a fraud; Gil, Tony and Stuffy remind him that Judy still needs his help and persuade him to stay. After making a shambles of Mrs Upjohn's examination, Hackenbush, Tony, Stuffy and Gil hide out in Hi-Hat's stable, where Judy soon joins them. The Brothers and eventually Gil try to comfort Judy (‚ÄúTomorrow Is Another Day‚Äù), who is upset by the negative light of the situation at the sanitarium. Near the stable, Stuffy starts sympathizing with a community of poor folk who believe him to be archangel Gabriel (‚ÄúGabriel (Who Dat Man)‚Äù). As the musical number progresses (‚ÄúAll God's Chillun Got Rhythm‚Äù, ‚ÄúNobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen‚Äù), the police arrives and the Brothers intent to disguise themselves by painting their faces with grease in blackface. The attempt fails as everybody runs off and Whitmore finally exposes Hackenbush as a horse doctor with a letter he received from the Florida Medical Board. Morgan is about to have them arrested when Hi-Hat hears Morgan's voice and bolts, jumping several obstacles in the way. Whitmore finally exposes Hackenbush as a horse doctor with a letter he received from the Florida Medical Board and Morgan is about to have them arrested when Hi-Hat hears Morgan's voice and bolts, jumping several obstacles in the way. Gil realizes that Hi-Hat is a jumper, and the following day enters him in the steeplechase race. Morgan, who witnessed Hi-Hat's jumping ability, tries to prevent him from being entered in the race. After intentionally delaying the race several times and getting past Morgan and the Sheriff, the boys, Gil and Judy manage to get Hi-Hat onto the track and the race finally begins. Knowing that Hi-Hat is afraid of Morgan, everyone works to make Hi-Hat aware of his presence before reaching the fence. On the last lap, Hi-Hat and Morgan's horse wipe out; when they reach the finish line, it appears that Morgan's horse has won; Stuffy realizes that the mud-covered horses were switched after the accident, and Morgan's jockey was riding Hi-Hat in the finish, thus making Hi-Hat the winner. The black folk arrive at the race and start walking with Gil, Judy and the Brothers through the racetrack, singing the final number (\\"A Message from the Man in the Moon\\").

Production The Marx Brothers on the set with director Sam Wood The film went through numerous outlines, treatments, drafts, revisions and a total of eighteen different scripts before arriving at its final version. A major portion of the final screenplay was written by Al Boasberg, but due to a bitter disagreement with MGM, he chose not to be given any credit for his work. As they had with A Night At The Opera, the Brothers honed the comic material during a pre-production vaudeville tour. Groucho's character was originally named \\"Quackenbush\\" but was changed to \\"Hackenbush\\" over threats of lawsuits by several real doctors named Quackenbush. During production, Irving Thalberg, who had brought the Marx Brothers to MGM, died suddenly in September, 1936 of pneumonia at the age of 37. Thalberg's death left the Marxes without a champion at MGM, and the studio never gave the same level of care and attention to the team they had received under Thalberg. As a result, the Marx Brothers' three later MGM films are generally considered to be vastly inferior to their first two.Thames, Stephanie. \\"The Big Store\\" on TCM.com The original release of A Day at the Races presented the water carnival sequence in light brown sepia and the ballet scene with a blue tint. The film used Santa Anita Park as a filming location for some of the racetrack scenes. Music The songs in the film, by Bronislaw Kaper, Walter Jurmann, and Gus Kahn, are \\"On Blue Venetian Waters\\", \\"Tomorrow Is Another Day\\", and \\"All God's Chillun Got Rhythm\\" (featuring Ivie Anderson from Duke Ellington's orchestra). Two other songs were slated for the film, but ultimately cut . One, \\"Dr. Hackenbush\\", sung by Groucho about \\"what a great doctor he is\\" (\\"No matter what I treat them for they die from something else\\") was performed on the pre-filming tour, but was apparently never shot; the other, \\"A Message From The Man In The Moon\\", sung by Allan Jones, was shot, but was cut at the last minute because the film was too long. The melody is heard during the opening titles, some incidental music during the Water Carnival scene, and is \\"reprised\\" by Groucho during the final scene. The DVD release of the film includes a recently rediscovered audio recording of the song, performed by Allan Jones. The film also features a lindy hop dance sequence set to the tune of \\"All God's Chillun Got Rhythm\\", and featuring Whitey's Lindy Hoppers, including Willamae Ricker, Snookie Beasley, Ella Gibson, George Greenidge, Dot Miller, Johnny Innis, Norma Miller and Leon James.Manning, Frankie and Millman, Cynthia.

Contemporary reviews from critics continued to be positive for the Marx Brothers through their seventh film. John T. McManus of The New York Times called it \\"comparatively bad Marx,\\" although still deserving of \\"a much better than passing grade\\" because \\"any Marx brothers motion picture is an improvement upon almost any other sustained screen slapstick.\\" Variety declared, \\"Surefire film fun and up to the usual parity of the madcap Marxes.\\" Harrison's Reports wrote, \\"Very good! The Marx Brothers are at their best and funniest here.\\" John Mosher of The New Yorker was also positive, writing that \\"Groucho, Harpo, and Chico are in full blast again,\\" and the film \\"reaches a fever pitch even beyond earlier records.\\" The Chicago Tribune called it a \\"ridiculous farce, plummed with unique gags, laugh provoking situations, fast action ... The finale sends audiences away grinning and happy.\\" Writing for England's Night and Day, Graham Greene gave the film a generally good review, summarizing it as \\"easily the best film to be seen in London\\", but he criticized some elements of the film's portrayal. Greene noted that the film gave him \\"a nostalgia for the old cheap rickety sets\\" rather than the modern realistic sets, and although he praised Harpo's performance as \\"shin[ing] the brightest\\", he complained that the strong realism in O'Sullivan's acting set up a strong juxtaposition against the \\"silliness\\" of the Marx brothers' antics.

This typically refers to an astrophysical context where ultraviolet radiation from hot stars acts on clouds of material such as molecular clouds, protoplanetary disks, or planetary atmospheres. Molecular clouds Eagle nebula pillars being photoevaporated One of the most obvious manifestations of astrophysical photoevaporation is seen in the eroding structures of molecular clouds as luminous stars are born within.  Evaporating Gaseous Globules (EGGs)  Evaporating Gaseous Globules or EGGs were first discovered in the Eagle Nebula. These small cometary globules are being photoevaporated by the stars in the nearby cluster. EGGs are places of ongoing star-formation. Planets and atmospheres A planet can be stripped of its atmosphere (or parts of the atmosphere) due to high energy photons and other electromagnetic radiation. If a photon interacts with an atmospheric molecule, the molecule is accelerated and its temperature increased. If sufficient energy is provided, the molecule or atom may reach the escape velocity of the planet and \\"evaporate\\" into space. The lower the mass number of the gas, the higher the velocity obtained by interaction with a photon. Thus hydrogen is the gas which is most prone to photoevaporation. Examples of exoplanets with an evaporating atmosphere are HD 209458 b, HD 189733 b and Gliese 3470 b. Material from a possible evaporating planet around WD J0914+1914 might be responsible for the gaseous disk around this white dwarf. Protoplanetary disks Photoevaporation occurring to a protoplanetary disk due to the presence of a nearby O-type star Protoplanetary disks can be dispersed by stellar wind and heating due to incident electromagnetic radiation. The radiation interacts with matter and thus accelerates it outwards. This effect is only noticeable when there is sufficient radiation strength, such as coming from nearby O and B type stars or when the central protostar commences nuclear fusion. The disk is composed of gas and dust. The gas, consisting mostly of light elements such as hydrogen and helium, is mainly affected by the effect, causing the ratio between dust and gas to increase. Radiation from the central star excites particles in the accretion disk. The irradiation of the disk gives rise to a stability length scale known as the gravitational radius (r_g). Outside of the gravitational radius, particles can become sufficiently excited to escape the gravity of the disk, and evaporate. After 106 ‚Äì 107 years, the viscous accretion rates fall below the photoevaporation rates at r_g. A gap then opens around r_g, the inner disk drains onto the central star, or spreads to r_g and evaporates. An inner hole extending to r_g is produced. Once an inner hole forms, the outer disk is very rapidly cleared. The formula for the gravitational radius of the disk is : r_g = \\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\gamma - 1\\\\right)}{2\\\\gamma}\\\\frac{GM\\\\mu}{k_B T} \\\\approx 2.15 \\\\frac{\\\\left(M/M_\\\\odot\\\\right)}{\\\\left(T/10^4 \\\\ {\\\\rm K} \\\\right)} \\\\ {\\\\rm AU},\\\\\\\\! where \\\\gamma is the ratio of specific heats (= 5/3 for a monatomic gas), G the universal gravitational constant, M the mass of the central star, M_\\\\odot the mass of the Sun, \\\\mu the mean weight of the gas, k_B Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature of the gas and AU the Astronomical Unit. Because of this effect, the presence of massive stars in a star-forming region is thought to have a great effect on planet formation from the disk around a young stellar object, though it is not yet clear if this effect decelerates or accelerates it. = Regions containing protoplanetary disks with clear signs of external photoevaporation = The most famous region containing photoevaporated protoplanetary disks is the Orion Nebula. They were called bright proplyds and since then the term was used for other regions to describe photoevaporation of protoplanetary disks. They were discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope. There might even be a planetary-mass object in the Orion Nebula that is being photoevaporated by Œ∏ 1 Ori C. Since then HST did observe other young star clusters and found bright proplyds in the Lagoon Nebula, the Trifid Nebula, Pismis 24 and NGC 1977. After the launch of the Spitzer Space Telescope additional observations revealed dusty cometary tails around young cluster members in NGC 2244, IC 1396 and NGC 2264. These dusty tails are also explained by photoevaporation of the proto-planetary disk. Later similar cometary tails were found with Spitzer in W5. This study concluded that the tails have a likely lifetime of 5 Myrs or less. Additional tails were found with Spitzer in NGC 1977, NGC 6193 and Collinder 69. Other bright proplyd candidates were found in the Carina Nebula with the CTIO 4m and near Sagittarius A* with the VLA. Follow-up observations of a proplyd candidate in the Carina Nebula with Hubble revealed that it is likely an evaporating gaseous globule. Objects in NGC 3603 and later in Cygnus OB2 were proposed as intermediate massive versions of the bright proplyds found in the Orion Nebula.

Location At the foot of Karancs mountain, in the Cserh√°t hills, 250 meters above sea level, north-east from Budapest, west from Miskolc. Salg√≥tarj√°n is surrounded by beautiful forests and hills topped with castle ruins, which are accessible by bus that may be taken from the center of town. History The town already existed in the Middle Ages, but information on it is scarce possibly because it was a small settlement. The word salg√≥ means \\"shining\\" in Old Hungarian, while Tarj√°n was the name of one of the Hungarian tribes conquering the area. The castle of Salg√≥ was built in the 13th century on a mountain of volcanic origin. In the 13th century the town already had a church. After the 1682 siege of the nearby Castle of F√ºlek (today Fiƒæakovo, Slovakia) the town was deserted, and new settlers arrived only ten years later, but remained a small village. Development came in the mid-19th century, when a coal mine was opened nearby. The job opportunities provided by the mine and the developing industry began to attract people. The village grew quickly and was granted town status in 1922. Today visitors can see the remains of the mining industry by visiting the Mine Museum, which is located next to the main entrance of the mine. In 1950, Salg√≥tarj√°n became the capital of N√≥gr√°d county instead of the previous county seat Balassagyarmat, although the county offices did not move there until 1952. In the next twenty years several villages were annexed to the growing city. The coal mines closed years ago, leaving the city with high unemployment rates. In 1994, Salg√≥tarj√°n was granted the rank of city with county rights, in accord with a new law stating that all county seats are cities with county rights. (Previously only cities with a population over 50.000 were granted county rights, and Salg√≥tarj√°n was one of only two county seats that had smaller population than 50.000; the other was Szeksz√°rd). Places of interest The town is near two ruined castles and contains two museums, among other places of interest. * Pl√©b√°niatemplom (Cathedral), located opposite the County History Museum, is the main church in the town. * N√≥gr√°di T√∂rt√©neti M√∫zeum (county of N√≥gr√°d History Museum) is the town's principal museum with exhibits about the history of the county.

The third and final volume, Seaguy Eternal is yet to be published. The story revolves around Seaguy, an unpowered superhero in a scuba suit, and his best friend and sidekick Chubby Da Choona, a talking, cigar-smoking tuna. Publication history Morrison has expressed on various occasions that Seaguy represents a deliberate effort to move away from conventions of the current era of comics, \\"I had the idea to develop Seaguy into a weapon I could use to fight back against the trendy and unconvincing 'bad-ass' cynicism of current comics, most of which are produced by the most un-'bad-ass' men you can possibly imagine\\". Morrison believes that in this fashion the work represents a new vanguard in the development of comics. He expressed similar sentiments about Zenith, one of the earliest series he worked on, when he said that it \\"was a reaction against torment superheroes.\\"Bishop, David (2007) Thrill-Power Overload.

He constantly expresses his wish to go on adventures and impress a beautiful bearded warrior woman named She-Beard, but he never seems to get around to it because he's told the world doesn't need heroes anymore. However, when Seaguy and Chubby discover that a new food staple called Xoo is sentient, they decide to protect it from evil forces and bring it home. Seaguy exists in a seemingly perfect world in which all the super-heroes no longer save lives or do much of anything except ride the rides at the Mickey Eye amusement park. It is public knowledge that all the evil in the world was finally destroyed after a powerful entity called the Anti-Dad was destroyed by all the super-heroes, effectively leaving the heroes without jobs. The style of the book is equal parts dark tragedy and light-hearted whimsy as the main character travels from one adventure to the other, but with each adventure becoming more tragic than the one before it, until Seaguy discovers the secret history of the moon.

Of the four colored pictures at the top of the diagram, the first two represent the meso compound (the 2R,3S and 2S,3R isomers are equivalent), followed by the optically active pair of levotartaric acid (L-(R,R)-(+)-tartaric acid) and dextrotartaric acid (D-(S,S)-(-)-tartaric acid). The meso compound is bisected by an internal plane of symmetry that is not present for the non-meso isomers (indicated by an X). That is, on reflecting the meso compound through a mirror plane perpendicular to the screen, the same stereochemistry is obtained; this is not the case for the non-meso tartaric acid, which generates the other enantiomer. The meso compound must not be confused with a 50:50 racemic mixture of the two optically-active compounds, although neither will rotate light in a polarimeter. 600 px It is a requirement for two of the stereocenters in a meso compound to have at least two substituents in common (although having this characteristic does not necessarily mean that the compound is meso). For example, in 2,4-pentanediol, both the second and fourth carbon atoms, which are stereocenters, have all four substituents in common. Since a meso isomer has a superposable mirror image, a compound with a total of n chiral centers cannot attain the theoretical maximum of 2n stereoisomers if one of the stereoisomers is meso.Bruice, Paula. Organic Chemistry. 2007. Pearson Prentice Hall. Upper Saddle River NJ. Cyclic meso compounds 1,2-substituted cyclopropane has a meso cis-isomer (molecule has a mirror plane) and two trans-enantiomers: 600 px The two cis stereoisomers of 1,2-substituted cyclohexanes behave like meso compounds at room temperature in most cases. At room temperature, most 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexanes undergo rapid ring flipping (exceptions being rings with bulky substituents), and as a result, the two cis stereoisomers behave chemically identically with chiral reagents.Vollhardt, K. Peter C. Organic Chemistry: Structure and Function, Fourth Ed. 2003. W.H. Freeman and Co. New York. pp. 187. At low temperatures, however, this is not the case, as the activation energy for the ring-flip cannot be overcome, and they therefore behave like enantiomers. Also noteworthy is the fact that when a cyclohexane undergoes a ring flip, the absolute configurations of the stereocenters do not change. 600 px References Stereochemistry ","title":"Meso compound"},{"id":"606150","text":"Meso or mesos may refer to: * Apache Mesos, a computer clustering management platform * Meso compound, a stereochemical classification in chemistry * Meso, in-game currency for the massively multiplayer online role-playing game MapleStory * Mesopotamia, the first major river civilization, known today as Iraq * Mesoamerica, Americas, or Native Americans. * Mesothelioma, a form of cancer * Mesoscopic scale, an intermediate scale in physics between micro and nano * Multiple Equivalent Simultaneous Offers, a strategy used in negotiation ","title":"Meso"},{"id":"606154","text":"Juan Bautista (de) Pomar (c. 1535 - after 1601) was a mestizo descendant of the rulers of prehispanic Texcoco, a historian and writer on prehispanic Aztec history.

Distractibility occurs when attention is uncontrollably diverted to another activity or sensation. Most educators and psychologists agree that the ability to focus and sustain attention is crucial for a person to achieve their goals. Attention training is said to be part of education, particularly in the way students are trained to remain focused on a topic of observation or discussion for extended periods, developing listening and analytical skills in the process.  Human Attention Span Over Time  Estimates for the length of the human attention span are subject to high variability and depend on the precise definition of attention being used. * Transient attention is a short-term response to a stimulus that temporarily attracts/distracts attention. Researchers disagree on the exact amount of the human transient attention span. * Selective sustained attention, also known as focused attention, is the level of attention that produces consistent results on a task over time. Common estimates of the attention span of healthy teenagers and adults range from 10 to 20 minutes; however, there is no empirical evidence for this estimate. People can choose repeatedly to re-focus on the same thing. This ability to renew attention permits people to 'pay attention' to things that last for more than a few minutes, such as lengthy films. Older children are capable of longer periods of attention than younger children. An account, for instance, cited that the average attention span in children is: 7 minutes for 2-year-olds; 9 minutes for 3-year-olds; 12 minutes for 4-year-olds; and, 14 minutes for 5-year-olds. For time-on-task measurements, the type of activity used in the test affects the results, as people are generally capable of a longer attention span when they are doing something that they find enjoyable or intrinsically motivating. Attention is also increased if the person is able to perform the task fluently, compared to a person who has difficulty performing the task, or to the same person when he or she is just learning the task. Fatigue, hunger, noise, and emotional stress reduce the time focused on the task. Common estimates for sustained attention to a freely chosen task range from about 5 minutes for a two-year-old child, to a maximum of around 20 minutes in older children and adults. After losing attention from a topic, a person may restore it by resting, doing a different kind of activity, changing mental focus, or deliberately choosing to re-focus on the first topic. In a research study that consisted of 10,430 male and females ages 10 to 70, observed sustained attention time across a lifespan. The study required participants to use a cognitive testing website where data was gathered for seven months. The data collected from the study concluded that attention span is not a one singular linear equation, at age 15 it is recorded that attention span related abilities diverge. Over the course of the study, collected evidence additionally found that attention span peaks in humans early 40‚Äôs then gradually declines in old age. Measurement Many different tests on attention span have been used in different populations and in different times. Some tests measure short-term, focused attention abilities (which is typically below normal in people with ADHD), and others provide information about how easily distracted the test-taker is (typically a significant problem in people with ADHD). Tests like the DeGangi's Test of Attention in Infants (TAI) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV) are commonly used to test for attention-related issues in young children when interviews and observations are inadequate. Older tests, like the Continuous Performance Test and the Porteus Maze Test, have been rejected by some experts. These tests are typically criticized as not actually measuring attention, being inappropriate for some populations, or not providing clinically useful information. Variability in test scores can be produced by small changes in the testing environment. For example, test-takers will usually remain on task for longer periods of time if the examiner is visibly present in the room than if the examiner is absent. Research In an early study of the influence of temperament on attention span, the mothers of 232 pairs of twins were interviewed periodically about the similarities and differences in behavior displayed by their twins during infancy and early childhood. The results showed that each of the behavioral variables (temper frequency, temper intensity, irritability, crying, and demanding attention) had a significant inverse relationship with attention span. In other words, the twin with longer attention span was better able to remain absorbed in a particular activity without distraction, and was also the less temperamental twin. One study of 2600 children found that early exposure to television (around age two) is associated with later attention problems such as inattention, impulsiveness, disorganization, and distractibility at age seven. This correlational study does not specify whether viewing television increases attention problems in children, or if children who are naturally prone to inattention are disproportionately attracted to the stimulation of television at young ages, or if there is some other factor, such as parenting skills, associated with this finding. How well a parent can capture and keep a two- year-old's attention on a toy may be more important than just a pleasant way to pass the time. \\"By successfully focusing a young child's attention on objects during free play, parents may be giving their child practice in using attention as a way to shift into a positive emotional state,\\" said Raver. \\"We found that children whose parents actively directed and maintained their child's visual attention spent more time distracting themselves away from a source of distress.\\" In one study, Raver observed 47 urban low-income mothers and their two-year-olds for ten minutes of free play, analyzing how much the pair kept each other's attention. The mother then left the room for four minutes and trained observers noted how the child managed his/her emotions. After the mother returned, the experimenter placed a new toy out of reach of the child, stating that the child could have it in a few minutes after the experimenter returned to the room. \\"Both strategies were effective for delaying gratification, maintaining behavioral self-control and modulating feelings of distress,\\" said Raver. Modern society Some authors, such as Neil Postman in his book, Amusing Ourselves to Death, believe that the attention span of humans is decreasing as use of modern technology, especially television, increases. Internet browsing may have a similar effect because it enables users to move easily from one page to another. Most internet users spend less than one minute on the average website. Movie reviewer Roger Ebert, an active blogger and \\"Tweeter,\\" wrote of the effect of technology on his reading habits and his search for frisson on the web and in life. Ebert cited Nicholas Carr's June 2010 Wired magazine article. This article summarizes UCLA professor Gary Small's study, which used an MRI scan to measure the differences in the cerebral blood-flow of six participants, three \\"experienced Web surfers\\" and three \\"novices,\\" while they performed tasks with \\"goggles\\" and a \\"handheld keypad.\\" First, participants searched Google for \\"various preselected topics,\\" resulting increases in prefrontal cortex activity in \\"experienced Web surfers\\" to be higher than that of the \\"novices.\\" Second, participants read text with the goggles, resulting in no significant differences in brain activity between the two groups. Afterwards the \\"experienced Web veterans,\\" spent an hour a day online for five days, the study found no significant difference between the two groups.

United States, 354 U.S. 476 (1957), along with its companion case Alberts v. California, was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court which redefined the Constitutional test for determining what constitutes obscene material unprotected by the First Amendment.Roth v. United States, .  Prior history  Under the common law rule that prevailed before Roth, articulated most famously in the 1868 English case Regina v. Hicklin, any material that tended to \\"deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences\\" was deemed \\"obscene\\" and could be banned on that basis. Thus, works by Balzac, Flaubert, James Joyce and D. H. Lawrence were banned based on isolated passages and the effect they might have on children. Samuel Roth, who ran a literary business in New York City, was convicted under a federal statute criminalizing the sending of \\"obscene, lewd, lascivious or filthy\\" materials through the mail for advertising and selling a publication called American Aphrodite (\\"A Quarterly for the Fancy-Free\\") containing literary erotica and nude photography. David Alberts, who ran a mail-order business from Los Angeles, was convicted under a California statute for publishing pictures of \\"nude and scantily-clad women.\\" The Court granted certiorari and affirmed both convictions.  Ruling  Roth came down as a 6‚Äì3 decision, with the opinion of the Court authored by William J. Brennan, Jr.. The Court repudiated the Hicklin test and defined obscenity more strictly, as material whose \\"dominant theme taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest\\" of the \\"average person, applying contemporary community standards.\\" Only material meeting this test could be banned as \\"obscene.\\" However, Brennan reaffirmed that obscenity was not protected by the First Amendment and thus upheld the convictions of Roth and Alberts for publishing and sending obscene material through the mail. Congress could ban material, \\"utterly without redeeming social importance,\\" or in other words, \\"whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest.\\" Chief Justice Earl Warren worried that \\"broad language used here may eventually be applied to the arts and sciences and freedom of communication generally,\\" but, agreeing that obscenity is not constitutionally protected, concurred only in the judgment. Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas, First Amendment \\"literalists,\\" dissented in Roth, arguing vigorously that the First Amendment protected obscene material. Justice John Marshall Harlan II dissented in Roth, involving a federal statute, but concurred in Alberts, involving a state law, on the grounds that while states had broad power to prosecute obscenity, the federal government did not.  Legacy  In Memoirs v. Massachusetts (1966),Memoirs v. Massachusetts, . a plurality of the Court further redefined the Roth test by holding unprotected only that which is \\"patently offensive\\" and \\"utterly without redeeming social value,\\" but no opinion in that case could command a majority of the Court either, and the state of the law in the obscenity field remained confused. Pornography and sexually oriented publications proliferated as a result of the Warren Court's holdings, the \\"Sexual Revolution\\" of the 1960s flowered, and pressure increasingly came on the Court to allow leeway for state and local governments to crack down on obscenity. During his ill- fated bid to become Chief Justice, Justice Abe Fortas was attacked vigorously in Congress by conservatives such as Strom Thurmond for siding with the Warren Court majority in liberalizing protection for pornography. In his 1968 presidential campaign, Richard Nixon campaigned against the Warren Court, pledging to appoint \\"strict constructionists\\" to the Supreme Court. In Miller v. California (1973), a five-person majority agreed for the first time since Roth as to a test for determining constitutionally unprotected obscenity, thereby superseding the Roth test. By the time Miller was considered in 1973, Justice Brennan had abandoned the Roth test and argued that \\"no formulation of this Court, the Congress, or the States can adequately distinguish obscene material unprotected by the First Amendment from protected expression.\\"Miller v.

They are considered ancestors of modern Slovenes, particularly Carinthian Slovenes. In the high Middle Ages, the term Carantanians and Carinthians were used interchangibly and denoted both the inhabitants of the bilingual Slavic-German Duchy of Carinthia, as well as South Slavs living within the borders of the Holy Roman Empire (that is, the ancestors of present-day Slovenes and Istrian Croats).Milko Kos, Zgodovina Slovencev, Vol I (Ljubljana, 1933): 171-72.  Historical background  After the disintegration of Samo's realm, Alpine Slavs established the Principality of Carantania in the Eastern Alps, which was independent from around 660 to around 745, when it fell under the Bavarian zone of influence and was later incorporated in the Frankish Empire. Until around 820, it was ruled as a semi- independent tribal polity. After the anti-Frankish rebellion of Ljudevit Posavski, which was partially supported by Carantanians, the Carantanian principality was transformed into a Frankish march, and later emerged as the feudal Duchy of Carinthia. Carantanians were the first Slavic people to accept Christianity from the West. They were mostly Christianized by Irish missionaries sent by the Archdiocese of Salzburg, among them Modestus, known as the \\"Apostle of Carantanians\\". This process was later described in the memorandum known as the Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum, which is thought to have over-emphasized the role of the Church of Salzburg in the Christianization process over similar efforts of the Patriarchate of Aquileia. Several rebellions of the Carantanians against the Christianisations occurred in the late 8th century, which later served as the source of inspiration of the Slovenian Romantic poet France Pre≈°eren in his epic-lyric poem The Baptism on the Savica. At the beginning of the 9th century, many Carantanians were moved as settlers in the Lower Pannonian region, also known as the Balaton Principality, which was referred in Latin sources as Carantanorum regio or \\"The Land of the Carantanians\\". The name Carantanians (Quarantani) was in use until the 13th century.  Language  The Freising Manuscripts, dated from the 11th century, were most probably written in Carinthia and compiled in the local Alpine Slav dialect Little is known of the language of the Carantanians, but it can be supposed that it was still very close to Proto-Slavic. Slovenian linguists have sometimes provisionally called it \\"Alpine Slavic\\" (alpska slovan≈°ƒçina). The Pre-Slavic toponyms, adopted and Slavicized by the Carantanians, as well as Bavarian records of Alpine Slavic names both help to shed light on the characteristics of the Alpine Slavic language. They were more connected to the West Slavic tribes than the South Slavic tribes according to their preserved characteristics from Proto-Slavic. From 8th century onwards the Alpine Slavic language underwent a series of gradual changes and innovations characteristic of South Slavic languages. By roughly 13th century, the Slovene language emerged from these innovations.Tine Logar, \\"Pregled zgodovine slovenskega jezika\\" (An Outline of the History of Slovene Language). In: Slovenski jezik, literatura in kultura. Ed.: Matja≈æ Kmecl et al. Ljubljana: Seminar slovenskega jezika, literature in kulture pri Oddelku za slovanske jezike in knji≈æevnosti Filozofske fakultete Univerze, 1974, p. [103]-113. The Freising Manuscripts, dating from the 10th century, which most surely originate from the region inhabited by the Carantanians, are considered to be the oldest documents in any Slavic language written in Latin alphabet. While still retaining many Proto-Slavic features, the language of the Freising manuscripts already exhibits certain developments characteristic of early Slovene. These texts are considered to be written in a transitional language between Alpine Slavic and modern Slovene.  Traditions and social organization  Not much is known about the social and political organization of the Carantanians. Most probably, they were organized in communal entities known as ≈æupas. A distinct social stratus known as kosezes (Kasazes in Latin, in German Edlinger, noble people), which were present also in other parts of the Slovene Lands until the High Middle Ages, is thought of having derived from the private army of the Carantanian prince. Medieval documents mention that the people freely elected their leader, but it remains unclear what social category the Medieval Latin name populus exactly referred to. Several traditions, typical of the Carantanians, survived until the end of the Middle Ages, most notably the installation of the dukes of Carinthia, which was carried out until 1414.

Preceded by Project BLUEBIRD, ARTICHOKE officially arose on August 20, 1951 and was operated by the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence.http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchnsmskKbdhiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB54/ The primary goal of Project ARTICHOKE was to determine whether a person could be involuntarily made to perform an act of attempted assassination. The project also studied hypnosis, forced morphine addiction (and subsequent forced withdrawal) and the use of other chemicals including LSD, to produce amnesia and other vulnerable states in subjects. Project ARTICHOKE led to Project MKUltra, which began in 1953.  The Project  ARTICHOKE was a mind control program that gathered information together with the intelligence divisions of the Army, Navy, Air Force and FBI. In addition, the scope of the project was outlined in a memo dated January 1952 that asked, \\"Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, such as self-preservation?\\"Estabrooks, G.H. \\"Hypnosis comes of age\\".

Project ARTICHOKE was the Central Intelligence Agency's secret code name for carrying out in-house and overseas experiments using LSD, hypnosis and total isolation as forms of physiological harassment for special interrogations on human subjects.Goliszek, Andrew. In the Name of Science: A History of Secret Programs, Medical Research, and Human Experimentation. New York: St. Martins, 2003. Print. At first agents used cocaine, marijuana, heroin, peyote and mescaline, but they increasingly saw LSD as the most promising drug. The subjects who left this project were fogged with amnesia, resulting in faulty and vague memories of the experience. In 1952, LSD was increasingly given to unknowing CIA agents to determine the drug's effects on unsuspecting people. One record states that an agent was kept on LSD for 77 days. ARTICHOKE researched the potential of dengue fever and other diseases. A declassified ARTICHOKE memo read: \\"Not all viruses have to be lethal‚Ä¶ the objective includes those that act as short-term and long-term incapacitating agents.\\" The CIA disputed which department would take over the operation. Finally, it was decided that an agent from the CIA research staff, former U.S. Army brigadier general Paul F. Gaynor, would oversee it. The CIA sought to establish control over what it perceived as the \\"weaker\\" and \\"less intelligent\\" segments of society, or for potential agents, defectors, refugees, POWs and others. A CIA report states that if hypnosis succeeded, assassins could be created to assassinate \\"a prominent [redacted] politician or if necessary, [an] American official.\\" The overseas operations took place in locations throughout Europe, Japan, Southeast Asia and the Philippines. Teams were assembled to manage these operations and they were told to \\"conduct at the overseas bases operational experiments utilizing aliens as subjects.\\" See also * CIA activities in the United States * Unethical human experimentation in the United States * Frank Olson * Project BLUEBIRD * Project CHATTER * Project MKNAOMI * Project MKOFTEN * Project MKULTRA Footnotes References * Ronson, Jon.

He is best known for being the principal author of NSC 68 and the co-founder of Team B. He helped shape Cold War defense policy over the course of numerous presidential administrations. Early life, education and family Nitze was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, the son of Anina Sophia (Hilken), a homemaker, and William Albert Nitze, a professor of Romance linguistics who concluded his career at the University of Chicago. His parents were both of German descent. His ancestors came from the region of Magdeburg in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. In his memoir, From Hiroshima to Glasnost, Paul Nitze describes how as a young boy he witnessed the outbreak of World War I while he was traveling in Germany with his father, mother, and sister, arriving in Munich just in time to be struck by the city crowds' patriotic enthusiasm for the imminent conflict. Nitze attended The Hotchkiss School, where he was a member of the class of 1924 and the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. He graduated from Harvard University in 1928 and entered the field of investment banking. In 1928 and 1929, the Chicago brokerage firm of Bacon, Whipple and Company sent Nitze to Europe. Upon his return, he heard Clarence Dillon predict the Great Depression and the decline of the importance of finance. Having attained financial independence through the sale to Revlon of his interest in a French laboratory producing pharmaceutical products in the United States, Nitze took an intellectual sabbatical that included a year of graduate study at Harvard in sociology, philosophy, and constitutional and international law. In 1929 he joined investment bank Dillon, Read & Co. where he remained until founding his own firm, P. H. Nitze & Co, in 1938. He returned to Dillon, Read as Vice-President from 1939 through to 1941. In 1932, he married Phyllis Pratt, daughter of John Teele Pratt, a Standard Oil financier, and of Ruth Baker Pratt, Republican Congresswoman for New York. She died in 1987. They had four children: Heidi, Peter, William, and Phyllis Anina (Nina). The journalist Nicholas Thompson, who wrote a biography of Nitze and George F. Kennan, is his grandson.Interview with Thompson on \\"New Books in History\\" He was married to Elisabeth Scott Porter from 1993 until his death in 2004. Nitze's brother-in-law, Walter Paepcke, founded the Aspen Institute and Aspen Skiing Company. Nitze continued to ski in Aspen until well into his 80s. Political career Nitze entered government service during World War II after having been hired by his Wall Street colleague James Forrestal when Forrestal became an administrative assistant to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In 1942, he became finance director of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, working for Nelson Rockefeller. In 1943 he became chief of the Metals and Minerals Branch of the Board of Economic Warfare, until he was named director, Foreign Procurement and Development Branch of the Foreign Economic Administration later that year. From 1944 to 1946, Nitze served as director and then as Vice Chairman of the Strategic Bombing Survey for which President Harry S. Truman awarded him the Legion of Merit. One of his early government assignments was to visit Japan in the immediate aftermath of the nuclear attacks and assess the damage. This experience framed many of his later feelings about the power of nuclear weapons and the necessity of arms control. In the early postwar era, he served in the Truman Administration as Director of Policy Planning for the State Department (1950‚Äì1953). He was also the principal author in 1950 of the highly influential but secret National Security Council policy paper, NSC 68, which provided the strategic outline for increased US expenditures to counter the perceived threat of Soviet armament. From 1953 to 1961, Nitze served as president of the Foreign Service Educational Foundation while concurrently serving as associate of the Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research and the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of the Johns Hopkins University. In 1956 he attended the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference, where discussion ranged from oceanography to nuclear weapons. Nitze co-founded the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) with Christian Herter in 1943 and the world-renowned graduate school, based in Washington, D.C., is named in his honor. His publications during this period include U.S. Foreign Policy: 1945‚Äì1955. In 1961, President Kennedy appointed Nitze Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. In 1963, Nitze became the Secretary of the Navy, serving until 1967. According to the US Navy \\"as the Navy secretary, he raised the level of attention given to quality of Service issues. His many achievements included establishing the first Personnel Policy Board and retention task force (the Alford Board), and obtaining targeted personnel bonuses. He lengthened commanding officer tours and raised command responsibility pay.\\" Following his term as Secretary of the Navy, he served as Deputy Secretary of Defense (1967‚Äì1969), as a member of the US delegation to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) (1969‚Äì1973). Later, fearing Soviet rearmament, he opposed the ratification of SALT II (1979). Paul Nitze was a cofounder of Team B, a 1970s intelligence think tank that challenged the National Intelligence Estimates provided by the CIA. The Team B reports became the intellectual foundation for the idea of \\"the window of vulnerability\\" and of the massive arms buildup that began toward the end of the Carter administration and accelerated under President Ronald Reagan. Team B came to the conclusion that the Soviets had developed new weapons of mass destruction and had aggressive strategies with regard to a potential nuclear war. Team B's analysis of Soviet weapon systems was later believed to be largely exaggerated. According to Anne Cahn of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (1977‚Äì1980), \\"if you go through most of Team B's specific allegations about weapons systems, and you just examine them one by one, they were all wrong.\\" Nonetheless, some still claim that its conclusions about Soviet strategical aims were largely proven to be true, but this hardly squares with the elevation of Gorbachev in 1985. Nitze was President Ronald Reagan's chief negotiator of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (1981‚Äì1984). In 1984, Nitze was named Special Advisor to the President and Secretary of State on Arms Control. For more than forty years, Nitze was one of the chief architects of US policy toward the Soviet Union. Awards and honors Albert and Roberta Wohlstetter. The East Room of the White House, Washington, D.C., 7 November 1985. Photograph courtesy of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. In 1985 President Reagan awarded Nitze the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contributions to the freedom and security of the United States. In 1989, Nitze received the US Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards. In 1991, he was awarded the prestigious United States Military Academy's Sylvanus Thayer Award for his commitment to the Academy's ideals of \\"Duty, Honor, Country\\".[6] In 1997, Nitze was awarded the Naval Heritage Award by the US Navy Memorial Foundation for his support of the US Navy while he was Secretary of the Navy.

According to a 2018 study in the British Journal of Criminology, stop and search had a marginal impact on crime in the UK. 1824 legislation The power to act on suspicion was found in part of section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824, which provided that: \\"[S]hall be deemed a rogue and vagabond\\" and would be guilty of an offence, and be liable to be imprisoned for up to three months. This effectively permitted the police to stop and search, and even arrest, anyone found in a public place if they suspected that they intended to commit an offence. In order to bring a prosecution under the act, the police had to prove that the defendant had committed two acts: * the first, that established them as a \\"suspected person\\" (by acting suspiciously), and * the second, that provided intent to commit an arrestable offence. Two witnesses were required to substantiate the charge, which were usually two police officers patrolling together. =1970s and 1980s= The law caused much discontent among certain sections of the population, particularly black and ethnic minorities, against whom the law was particularly targeted by the police‚Äîsee racial profiling. The sus law had attracted considerable controversy prior to the early 1980s race riots (in St Pauls, Bristol, in 1980, and in Brixton, London; Toxteth, Liverpool; Handsworth, Birmingham; and Chapeltown, Leeds in 1981). This led to campaigns against the law including the \\"Scrap Sus\\" campaign led by Mavis BestMedia Diversified https://mediadiversified.org/mavisbest-2/ and Paul Boateng.BBC News http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/482565.stm When questioned on the topic in 1980, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir David McNee stated that the reason for its disproportionate use on black people was because they were \\"over- represented in offences of robbery and other violent theft\\".https://www.runnymedetrust.org/histories/race-equality/45/runnymede- reports-on-use-of-sus-law.html In 1980, the House of Commons' Sub-Committee on Race Relations and Immigration began hearings into the law. In the case of the race riots, the alleged abusive use of the sus law was believed to be a contributory factor to those events.

For 27 years from Head was technical director at Williams Grand Prix Engineering, and responsible for many innovations within Formula One. Head oversaw the design and construction of Williams cars until May 2004 when his role was handed over to Sam Michael. Early career Patrick Head was born into motor sport, his father Michael racing Jaguar sportscars in the 1950s, and was privately educated at Wellington College. After leaving school Head joined the Royal Navy, but soon realised that a career in the military was not how he wanted to spend his life and so left to attend University, first in Birmingham and later, after failing his first year exams, at UCL. Head graduated in 1970 with a Mechanical Engineering degree and immediately joined the chassis manufacturer Lola in Huntingdon. Here he formed a friendly relationship with John Barnard, whose Formula One designs for McLaren, Benetton and Ferrari would later go on to compete against Williams. Head was involved in a number of new projects all trying to become established as car builders or engineering companies and it was during this period that Head and Frank Williams met. Finally becoming disillusioned by his lack of success Head quit motor racing to work on building boats, but was lured back by Williams to join his team, which Head did during 1975. In 1976 thirty-four-year-old Frank Williams decided that the time was right to re-form his own team and promptly set about luring Head back into Formula One. After one abortive attempt, on 8 February 1977 Williams Grand Prix Engineering was founded with Williams and Head taking seventy and thirty percent of the company respectively. In the team raced a customer March chassis, but in , with backing from Saudi Airlines and having signed Australian driver Alan Jones, the Head-designed FW06 made its first appearance. Despite having no money, and with Williams himself frequently forced to conduct business from a telephone box, Head still managed to design a respectable car. The following season Williams scored 11 world championship points finishing 9th in the constructors championship and from here momentum began to build. As early as the fourth round of the season Jones made the team's first visit to the podium. The same year saw a Head-designed car take the first of over one-hundred race wins when Swiss driver Clay Regazzoni won the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Four more victories followed in 1979 and Head was now an established Grand Prix car designer. 1980s Head's car was the class of the field, taking Alan Jones and the team to both titles, and securing Williams as a front runner. More success followed in the 1980s and Head began to move away from designing the cars himself, effectively creating a role of Technical Director, a person who oversaw the processes of design, construction, racing and testing, bringing together all the different disciplines. Frank Dernie took over as chief designer. During the 1980s he is also credited with many revolutionary concepts including a six-wheeled car, which tested in 1982, and continuously variable transmission, which replaced the car's conventional gearbox and allowed the engine to remain at optimum RPM during the entire lap. Neither system made it into racing due to rule changes, which many attribute to pressure from other teams, who were worried about the time required to develop similar systems of their own. In 1986 Head, with other Williams management, was forced to assume control of the team when Frank Williams was seriously injured in a road accident. Despite this diversion, and under Head's temporary stewardship, the team still secured the constructors titles in and both the constructors' and drivers title (with Nelson Piquet) in . 1990s In 1990 Williams hired Adrian Newey, recently sacked as technical director of Leyton House Racing. The two engineers rapidly formed the outstanding design partnership of the 1990s with Head/Newey cars achieving a level of dominance never seen before, and not repeated until the Ferrari/Schumacher era a decade later. In a seven-year period between 1991 and 1997, Williams had fifty-nine race wins, won five constructors titles, and four different drivers won world championships. However, Newey also had ambitions to succeed to technical director, but this was blocked as Head was a founder and shareholder of the team. With Williams securing both the drivers and constructors titles in 1996, McLaren managed to lure Newey away though he was forced to take gardening leave for the 1997 season. 2000s Since the departure of Newey, Williams often appeared a spent force, able to win occasionally, but unable to mount a consistent challenge. During the dominant Ferrari/Schumacher period from 2000‚Äì04, Williams managed to finish runner-up in the constructors championship in 2002 and 2003, and 2003 was the closest that one of their drivers, Juan Pablo Montoya, got to the world title. In 2004, Head moved to the position of Director of Engineering, as Sam Michael became Technical Director. After Head's move, Williams's decline continued and following Montoya's win at the 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix, they entered a lengthy period without a Grand Prix victory ended by Pastor Maldonado winning the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix. 2010s In 2012, Head resigned from his position in the Williams team. He continued his involvement in Williams Hybrid Power Limited until it was sold to GKN in April 2014. In 2015, he received a Knighthood for his services to motorsport. In March 2019, Head returned to Williams Racing for the first time in eight years. He returned in a consultancy role. Ayrton Senna accident In April 2007 the Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport reported that a court in Bologna had concluded that a technical failure was responsible for Ayrton Senna's fatal accident at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994. Under Italian law the \\"responsibility\\" for such an accident has to be proved but no action was taken against Head or Williams' Chief Designer Adrian Newey, neither of whom attended the court hearing. The court's findings were made public 13 years after the accident and the case was closed.gazzetta.it The Italian Court of Appeal, on 13 April 2007, stated the following in the verdict numbered 15050: \\"It has been determined that the accident was caused by a steering column failure. This failure was caused by badly designed and badly executed modifications. The responsibility of this falls on Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control.\\" Even being found responsible for Senna's accident, Head was not arrested because in Italy, the statute of limitation for manslaughter is 7 years and 6 months, and the final verdict was pronounced 13 years after the accident.Hamilton, Maurice (ed.) (1985) Autocourse 1985 ‚Äì 1986 Hazleton publishing pp.427 Legacy Many of the top engineers in Formula One, such as Adrian Newey, Neil Oatley, Ross Brawn, Frank Dernie, Paddy Lowe, Eghbal Hamidy, Geoff Willis and Enrique Scalabroni have worked under Head's supervision early in their careers, and all have moved on to senior positions within other teams. Brawn in particular has had success as Head's opposite number at Benetton, Ferrari, Brawn GP and Mercedes. Adrian Newey has also had success at McLaren, and more recently Red Bull Racing, and he is considered one of the most successful engineers in Formula One.

It stretches along the southern coast of the Alaska Peninsula, between the Becharof National Wildlife Refuge on its east and the end of the peninsula at False Pass in the west. In between, however, it is broken into sections by lands of the Aniakchak National Monument and Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge is administered from offices in King Salmon, Alaska and was established to conserve Alaska Peninsula brown bears, caribou, moose, marine mammals, shorebirds, other migratory birds and fish, and to comply with treaty obligations. History View of the Mount Chiginagak The refuge was established on December 2, 1980, by the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act (ANILCA) following designation as a national wildlife monument in 1978 by the then President Jimmy Carter. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In 1983, the Fish and Wildlife Service undertook the responsibility to manage the Becharof Refuge, along with the Ugashik and Chignik units of the Becharof National Wildlife Refuge. In 1989 the park area was affected by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill which devastated the Alaska Peninsula. In an effort to determine species presence, distribution, habitat use, and migratory patterns, extensive studies have been conducted in the refuge. Biologists have studied extensively in the biologically rich Naknek River basin which provides an important habitat for thousands of ducks, geese and swans. From mid-March through mid-May, refuge biologists monitor waterfowl from established points from Naknek Lake to Kvichak Bay in Naknek. Biologists have been working in the area since 1992 to count waterfowl by species approximately four times a week. Species common to the refuge include common merganser, common goldeneye, tundra swan, greater white-fronted goose, mallard, northern pintail, American and Eurasian wigeon, American green-winged teal, Canada goose, greater scaup, northern shoveler, red-breasted merganser, black scoter, and long-tailed duck. Working with Boreal Partners in Flight, the Institute for Bird Populations (IBP), and Earthwatch, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service undertook comprehensive landbird studies at Mother Goose Lake from 1994 through to 2001. Between 1994 and 1999 over 110 Earthwatch volunteers used the scheme to educate themselves in bird biology. In conjunction with the National Audubon Society, the park has also hosted an annual Christmas Bird Count between December 14 and January 5 annually since 1986 to register birds in the corridor from the Kvichak Bay beach at Naknek to Lake Camp at the mouth of Naknek Lake. The refuge has sponsored a North American Migration Count on the second Saturday in May since 1998. Geography Mount Veniaminof. Port Wrangell Landscape The refuge covers an area of and lies in the Alaska Peninsula. It spans Aleutians East Borough, Kodiak Island and Lake and Peninsula Borough. The Alaska Peninsula Refuge contains a number of geologic and scenic features, with a mixture of volcanic activity juxtaposed alongside glacial valleys and coasts under erosion. The refuge contains the Chiginagak and Veniaminof volcanoes, the latter of which is one of Alaska‚Äôs active volcanoes, and last erupted in 1995. The crater which is approximately in diameter contains a ice field, making it the most extensive crater glacier in North America. In 1967, Mount Veniaminof was designated as a National Natural Landmark. The Upper Sandy River has its source at Mount Veniaminof and flows down to form a delta above Sandy Lake. In contrast to the volcanic landscape of the refuge, the Pacific coast of the protected area is characterised by rugged cliffs, bays, fjords, and streams. In particular the Castle Cape Fjords in the Chignik area is an extremely pronounced feature, with a strong erosion by the sea, with rocks shaded in contrasting dark and light tones. Notable streams drain into Agripina Bay and Port Wrangell from the glaciers and through the valleys of the refuge. Wildlife The park supports a diversity of fish and wildlife and are an important nesting site for seabirds such as puffins, cormorants, kittiwakes, and guillemots, emperor geese, harlequin ducks, Steller's eider, and notably the bald eagle. All five species of Pacific salmon spawn including the commercially productive sockeye salmon run into the Chignik system. Sea lions, gray whales, harbor seals and sea otters can all be found along the coast. Alaskan brown bears are a common sight in the coastal meadows in spring and summer when they come to feed on the spawning salmon. Often as many as 500 bears may inhabit the Black Lake-Chignik Lake Area during August, making it one of the most dense seasonal concentrations of grizzly bears in North America. Caribou and moose are also under protection in the park. The moose in particular inhabit the Mother Goose Lake and the lines of the King Salmon River, also supporting populations of wolf packs, beaver, wolverine, river otter, two species of fox, snowshoe hare and Canadian lynx.

Overview Digital philosophy is a modern re-interpretation of Gottfried Leibniz's monist metaphysics, one that replaces Leibniz's monads with aspects of the theory of cellular automata. Since, following Leibniz, the mind can be given a computational treatment, digital philosophy attempts to consider some main issues in the philosophy of mind. The digital approach attempts to deal with the non-deterministic quantum theory, where it assumes that all information must have finite and discrete means of its representation, and that the evolution of a physical state is governed by local and deterministic rules. In digital physics, existence and thought would consist of only computation. (However, not all computation would necessarily be thought.) Thus computation is the single substance of a monist metaphysics, while subjectivity arises from computational universality. There are many variants of digital philosophy; however, most of them are Digital data theories that view all of physical realities and cognitive science and so on, in framework of information theory. Digital philosophers *Edward Fredkin. In his paper \\"Finite Nature\\" (1992), computer pioneer Edward Fredkin stated two fundamental laws of physical information. As unsolved problems in physics these two fundamental laws have two fundamental consequences. # All information must have a digital means of its representation. # An informational process transforms the digital representation of the state of the system into its future state. # If Fredkin's first fundamental law of information is correct then Einstein's theory of general relativity theory is not entirely correct, because the theory does not rely upon digital information. # If Fredkin's second fundamental law is correct then the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is not entirely correct, because quantum randomness lacks a digitally deterministic explanation. *Stephen Wolfram. In Chapter 9 of A New Kind of Science,* Wolfram, Stephen, A New Kind of Science. Wolfram Media, Inc., May 14, 2002. Stephen Wolfram presents an outline of a multiverse automaton. # Below the Planck scale, there is an informational substrate that allows the build-up of time, space, and energy by means of an updating parameter. # The updating parameter for the multiverse is analogous to time via a mathematical isomorphism, but the updating parameter involves a decomposition across alternate universes. # The informational substrate consists of network nodes that can simulate random network models and Feynman path integrals. # In physical reality, both energy and spacetime are secondary features. The most fundamental feature of reality is signal propagation caused by an updating parameter acting upon network nodes. # The multiverse automaton has a model consisting of informational substrate, an updating parameter, a few simple rules, and a method for deriving all of quantum field theory and general relativity theory, # The totally finite nature of the model implies the existence of weird, alternate- universe forces that might, or might not, be too small for empirical detection. *Rudy Rucker. In his book Mind Tools (1987),Rucker, Rudy, Mind Tools ‚Äì the five levels of mathematical reality ‚Äì Houghton Mifflin (1987) mathematician/philosopher Rudy Rucker articulated this concept with the following conclusions about the relationship between Math and the universe. Rucker's second conclusion uses the jargon term 'fact-space'; this is Rucker's model of reality based on the notion that all that exists is the perceptions of various observers. An entity of any kind is a glob in fact-space. The world ‚Äì the collection of all thoughts and objects ‚Äì is a pattern spread out through fact-space. The following conclusions describe the digital philosophy that relates the world to fact-space. # The world can be resolved into digital bits, with each bit made of smaller bits. # These bits form a fractal pattern in fact-space. # The pattern behaves like a cellular automaton. # The pattern is inconceivably large in size and dimensions. # Although the world started simply, its computation is irreducibly complex. Fredkin's ideas on physics Fredkin takes a radical approach to explaining the EPR paradox and the double- slit experiment in quantum mechanics. While admitting that quantum mechanics yields accurate predictions, Fredkin sides with Albert Einstein in the Bohr- Einstein debates. In The Meaning of Relativity, Einstein writes, \\"One can give good reasons why reality cannot at all be represented by a continuous field. From the quantum phenomena it appears to follow with certainty that a finite system of finite energy can be completely described by a finite set of numbers (quantum numbers). This does not seem to be in accordance with a continuum theory, and must lead to attempts to find a purely algebraic theory for the description of reality. However, nobody knows how to find the basis for such a description.\\" Einstein's hope is a purely algebraic theory; however, Fredkin attempts to find a purely informational theory for the description of reality. At the same time, physicists find some vagueness, problems with Bell theorem compatibility, and lack of empirical falsifiability in Fredkin's expression of his ideas. In \\"Digital Philosophy (DP)\\", Chapter 11, Fredkin raises the question, \\"Could physics have a strong law of conservation of information?\\" Fredkin answers his own question, \\"If so, we have to rethink particle disintegrations, inelastic collisions and Quantum Mechanics to better understand what is happening to the information. The appearance of a single truly random event is absolutely incompatible with a strong law of conservation of information. A great deal of information is obviously associated with the trajectory of every particle and that information must be conserved. This is a very large issue in DP, yet such issues are seldom considered in conventional physics.\\" Fredkin's \\"five big questions with pretty simple answers\\" According to Fredkin, \\"Digital mechanics predicts that for every continuous symmetry of physics there will be some microscopic process that violates that symmetry.\\" Therefore, according to Fredkin, at the Planck scale, ordinary matter could have spin angular momentum that violates the equivalence principle. There might be weird Fredkin forces that cause a torsion in spacetime. The Einstein‚ÄìCartan theory extends general relativity theory to deal with spin-orbit coupling when matter with spin is present. According to conventional wisdom in physics, torsion is nonpropagating, which means that torsion will appear within a massive body and nowhere else. According to Fredkin, torsion could appear outside and around massive bodies, because alternate universes have anomalous inertial effects.

Special attractions include the Natural History Centre and a planetarium. Entry to the museum is free. The museum is part of National Museums Liverpool. History Entrance steps to World Museum with Liverpool Central Library on the right The museum was originally started as the Derby Museum as it comprised the 13th Earl of Derby's natural history collection. It opened in 1851, sharing two rooms on Duke Street with a library. However, the museum proved extremely popular and a new, purpose-built building was required. Land for the new building, on a street then known as Shaw's Brow (now William Brown Street), opposite St George's Hall, was donated by local MP and Merchant William Brown, as was much of the funding for the building which would be known as the William Brown Library and Museum. Around 400,000 people attended the opening of the new building in 1860. The museum itself was named the Liverpool Museum. In the late 19th century, the museum's collection was beginning to outgrow its building so a competition was launched to design a combined extension to the museum and college of technology. The competition was won by Edward William Mountford and the College of Technology and Museum Extension opened in 1901. Liverpool, being one of the UK's major ports, was heavily damaged by German bombing during the blitz. While much of the Museum's collection was moved to less vulnerable locations during the war, the museum building was struck by German firebombs and suffered heavy damage. Parts of the museum only began to reopen fifteen years later. One of the exhibits destroyed in 1914 was the little yawl City of Ragusa, which twice crossed the Atlantic in 1870 and 1871 with a crew of two men. The museum underwent an ¬£35 million refurbishment in 2005 in order to double the size of the display spaces and make more of the collections accessible for visitors. A central entrance hall and six-storey atrium were created as part of the work. Major new galleries included \\"World Cultures\\", the \\"Bug House\\" and the \\"Weston Discovery Centre\\". On reopening the museum's name was changed again to World Museum. Exhibits =Astronomy, Space and Time= Black Knight BK02 is located in the Space and Time wing of the museum The physical sciences collection of World Museum was built after the devastation caused by the incendiary fire of 1941. The collection has expanded, in part, due to transfers from the Decorative Arts Department, Regional History Department, Walker Art Gallery and the Prescot Museum. The collection also contains several significant collections from the Liverpool Royal Institution, Bidston Observatory, later the Proudman Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, and the Physics Department of the University of Liverpool. Collections such as these are often made up of items of a singular type designed for a particular experiment such as DELPHI or LEP at CERN - the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or the Equatorium, a post-Copernican planetary calculator made to special order in the early 17th century. As a consequence the collection is small but contains a number of significant items.  Planetarium  World Museum is home to a planetarium. The planetarium opened in 1970 and has 62 seats. It currently attracts about 90,000 people per year. Shows cover various aspects of space science, including the Solar System, space exploration and has special children's shows. = Human History = The Codex Fej√©rv√°ry-Mayer which is located in the museum is an Aztec Codex and one of the few manuscripts to have survived the Spanish conquest of Mexico Funerary statue of Ama'alay dhu-Dharah'il from Hayd ibn Aqil (ancient Saudi Arabia)  Archaeology and Egyptology  The archaeological collection includes many fine British objects, including the Anglo-Saxon Kingston brooch and Liudhard medalet, with other objects from the Canterbury-St Martin's hoard. The Egyptology collection contains approximately 15,000 objects from Egypt and Sudan and is the most important single component of the Antiquities department's collections. The chronological range of the collection spans from the Prehistoric to the Islamic Period with the largest archaeological site collections being Abydos, Amarna, Beni Hasan, Esna and Meroe. Over 5000 Egyptian antiquities were donated to the museum in 1867 by Joseph Mayer (1803‚Äì1886), a local goldsmith and antiquarian. Mayer purchased collections from Joseph Sams of Darlington (which contained material from the Henry Salt sale in 1835), Lord Valentia, Bram Hertz, the Reverend Henry Stobart, and the heirs of the Rev. Bryan Faussett. Mayer had displayed his collection in his own ‚ÄòEgyptian Museum‚Äô in Liverpool with a purpose of giving citizens who were unable to visit the British Museum in London some idea of the achievements of the Egyptian civilization. On the strength of this substantial donation other people began to donate Egyptian material to the museum, and by the later years of the 19th century the museum had a substantial collection that Amelia Edwards described as being the most important collection of Egyptian antiquities in England next to the contents of the British Museum. The quality of the Mayer donation is high and there are some outstanding items, but with a few exceptions the entire collection is unprovenanced. The collection was systematically enhanced through subscription to excavations in Egypt. Altogether the museum subscribed to 25 excavations carried out by the Egypt Exploration Fund (now Egypt Exploration Society), the British School of Archaeology in Egypt, and the Egyptian Research Account between 1884 and 1914. It was further developed through links with the Institute of Archaeology at Liverpool University and important collections came to the museum from the excavations of John Garstang who was honorary reader in Egyptian archaeology at Liverpool University 1902‚Äì07, and Professor of Methods and Practice of Archaeology 1907‚Äì41. The museum has always had a close relationship with the university; in the early 1920s Percy Newberry, Brunner Professor of Egyptology, and his successor T. Eric Peet, catalogued the collection, assisted with the rearrangement of the displays, and produced a handbook and guide to the Egyptian collection (1st ed., 1923). In May 1941, at the height of the Liverpool Blitz, a bomb fell on the museum, which was burnt to a shell. Large parts of the collection had been removed at the outbreak of the war, but much remained on display or in store and many artefacts were destroyed. What remained was quite inaccessible and it was not until 1976 that a permanent Egypt gallery was opened in the rebuilt museum. Following the war the museum actively augmented the collection through collecting of new material from excavations in Egypt and Sudan and the purchase of other museum collections. In 1947 and 1949 the material from Garstang‚Äôs excavations at Meroe came to the museum, and in 1955 Liverpool University placed substantial amounts from its own collections within the museum, including many items from Beni Hasan and Abydos. In 1956 the museum purchased almost the entire non-British collections of the Norwich Castle Museum. This included EES excavated material from Amarna and other sites, botanical remains from Kahun and the private collection of Sir Henry Rider Haggard. In 1973 the collection was increased further by the acquisition of part of the Sir Henry Wellcome Collection, and by the bequest of Colonel J. R. Danson in 1976, which included more material from Amarna and from Garstang‚Äôs excavations at Abydos. A handy lavishly illustrated guide to the collection is available: Gifts of the Nile (London: HMSO, 1995). Following a successful application to the Museums & Galleries Improvement Fund of the DCMS and the Wolfson Foundation the museum will be opening a new Egypt gallery in August 2008. The project with a total budget of ¬£600,000 aims to build on the success of the hugely popular World Museum by revitalising the Egyptian gallery, which is now 30 years old.  Ethnology  The ethnology collection at World Museum ranks among the top six collections in the country. The four main areas represented are: Africa, the Americas, Oceania and Asia. The exhibition includes interactive displays. = Natural History =  Biology and Zoology  In the Natural World area can be seen a range of exhibits, including live colonies of insects and historic zoological and botanical exhibits. The 13th Earl of Derby founded the original museum with a major donation of zoological specimens in 1851, including many rare and 'type' specimens, the ones that act as standards for the species. There also specimens of several extinct species housed in the museum, including the Liverpool pigeon, the great auk (and an egg), the Falkland Islands wolf, the South Island piopio, the Lord Howe swamphen, the dodo, the long-tailed hopping mouse, and the thylacine. Another attraction in the Natural world area is an art gallery with pictures of natural artist Edward Lear. The museum‚Äôs collections have grown considerably since then and now also include important botanical specimens dating back over 200 years, which represent most of Britain and Ireland‚Äôs native flora. Visitors can examine the collections up close in the award-winning Clore Natural History Centre, where there are interactive displays.  Geology  The geological collection at World Museum contains over 40,000 fossils as well as extensive rock and mineral collections. Each of these exhibits show information about the origins, structure and history of the planet earth. Founded in 1858, only seven years after the museum's establishment, much of the original collection was destroyed during the Second World War. The post-war collections have expanded considerably, thanks in part to the acquisition of several significant museum and university collections. The largest of these was the University of Liverpool's geological collection that includes some 6,600 fossil specimens. The collection covers the following areas: palaeontology, rocks and minerals.  Facial recognition system  Facial recognition technology, widespead in China, was used at Liverpool's World Museum, during the China's First Emperor and the Terracotta Warriors exhibition. The museum claimed the scanning equipment was used on the advice of local police (Merseyside Police), not the Chinese lenders. In a statement, the director of Big Brother Watch, Silkie Carlo, said that the, ‚ÄúAuthoritarian surveillance tool is rarely seen outside of China.‚Äù In 2019 Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, launched an investigation into the use of facial recognition software in the King's Cross area of London.

It opened in 1577, and continued staging plays until 1624. The Curtain was built some south of London's first playhouse, The Theatre, which had opened a year before, in 1576. It was called the \\"Curtain\\" because it was located near a plot of land called Curtain Close, which derived its name in turn from its proximity to the walls of Holywell Priory, a curtain wall being a section of wall between two bastions.Joseph Quincy Adams, Shakespearean Playhouses, Boston, 1917, p. 76. (The name bears no relationship to the front curtain associated with modern theatres.) The remains of the theatre were rediscovered in archaeological excavations in 2012‚Äì16. The most significant revelation was that the Curtain was rectangular, not round. The excavation revealed a stage, and evidence of a tunnel under the stage and galleries at the first floor level. Small finds included a ceramic bird whistle; ceramic money boxes for collecting entry fees; beads probably used for decorating stage costumes; and a small statue of Bacchus. History 1599 print showing what may be the Curtain Theatre, although this could be a depiction of the Theatre, the other Elizabethan theatre in Shoreditch at that time The Curtain Theatre was built in 1577 in Shoreditch, and was London's second playhouse. The name derives from the curtain wall of the adjacent St John the Baptist Holywell monastery. Little is known of the companies that performed there, or of the plays they performed. The first clear mention of the Curtain is in 1584, when the City of London petitioned the parish of Shoreditch to shut down their playhouses. The proprietor appears to have been Henry Lanman, described as a \\"gentleman\\": in 1585, Lanman made an agreement with the proprietor of the Theatre, James Burbage, to use the Curtain as a supplementary house, or \\"easer,\\" to the more prestigious older playhouse. From 1597 to 1599, it became the premier venue of Shakespeare's Company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, who had been forced to leave their former playing space at The Theatre after the latter closed in 1596. It was the venue of several of Shakespeare's plays, including Romeo and Juliet (which gained \\"Curtain plaudits\\") and Henry IV Part I and Part II. The Lord Chamberlain's Men also performed Ben Jonson's Every Man in His Humour here in 1598, with Shakespeare in the cast.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage volume III, Oxford, 1923, p. 359. Later that same year Jonson gained a certain notoriety by killing actor Gabriel Spencer in a duel in nearby Hoxton Fields. The Lord Chamberlain's Men departed the Curtain when the Globe Theatre, which they built to replace the Theatre, was ready for use in 1599. For seven years Henry Lanman (owner of the Curtain) had an agreement with James Burbage (owner of the Theatre) that all profit would be shared between them. This deal is how many believe Lanman was able to afford to open the Curtain, the rest is all very unclear. J. Leeds Barroll focuses in Shakespeare studies: An annual gathering of Research, Criticism and Reviews on the fact that Henry Lanman had offered the Curtain as an easer to James Burbage, proprietor of the Theatre. Thereby, he assumes that Lanman‚Äôs business, the Curtain, must have been doing as well as Burbage‚Äôs business, the Theatre, since both, Lanman and Burbage, had agreed on a pooling arrangement for seven years in 1585, to pool profits. As far as is known, Lanman ran the Curtain as a private concern for the first phase of its existence; He died in 1606William Ingram, The Business of Playing: The Beginnings of the Adult Professional Theater in Elizabethan London, Cornell University Press, 1992, p. 222. and it is assumed by Edmund Chambers that the theatre had been re-arranged into a shareholder‚Äôs enterprise before his death at some point. Thomas Pope, one of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, owned a share in the Curtain and left it to his heirs in his last will and testament in 1603. King's Men member John Underwood did the same in 1624.Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 403. The fact that both of these shareholders belonged to Shakespeare's company may indicate that the re-organization of the Curtain occurred when the Lord Chamberlain's Men were acting there. Otherwise, it would be very unwise of Burbage to pool profits if he did better in the first place. Thus, the suggestion is given that both proprietors were doing equal business. Burbage's father James had shares in the theatre at the time of his death. The Curtain Theatre during excavation in 2016 The Curtain Theatre during excavation in 2016 The London theatres, including the Curtain, were closed for much of the period from September 1592 to April 1594 due to the bubonic plague. In 1597, people wrote to the local magistrates' court demanding that no plays take place at the Curtain or the Theatre that year. The Curtain was named in John Stow's Survey of London in 1598, but was not listed in the 1603 edition. In 1600, the Privy Council tried unsuccessfully to shut down the Curtain theatre, and in 1603, the Curtain became the playhouse of Queen Anne's Men (formerly known as Worcester's Men, and formerly at the Rose Theatre, where they'd played Heywood's A Woman Kill'd With Kindness in February of that year). In 1607, The Travels of the Three English Brothers, by Rowley, Day, and Wilkins, was performed at the Curtain. The Curtain was in use from 1577 until at least 1624, after which its ultimate fate is obscure as there is no record of it after 1627. The reasons for its closure are not known. Site and rediscovery The Curtain was believed to have been built near The Theatre, but the exact location was for many years unknown. However, a commemorative plaque was erected at 18 Hewett Street. The Stage tower block under construction, May 2020 In 2012, archaeologists from MOLA (Museum of London Archaeology) announced that they had discovered the remains of the theatre during trial excavations. In 2013 plans were submitted to develop the site with a 40-storey tower of 400 apartments, plus a Shakespeare museum, 250-seat outdoor auditorium and park, with the archaeological remains visible in a glass enclosure. In May 2016, excavators announced that the theatre was purpose-built and, unusually, was a rectangle (measuring 22√ó25 metres) rather than being round or polygonal. Walls survived up to high in places; MOLA identified the courtyard, where theatregoers stood, and the inner walls, which held the galleries. The theatre had timber galleries with mid and upper areas for wealthier audience members, and a courtyard made from compacted gravel for those with less to spend. The galleries were straight. Also uncovered was a fragmentary ceramic bird whistle, dating from the late 16th century. This raised the question of whether the bird whistle was merely a Tudor toy or a prop for plays that needed sound effects. In November 2016, a tunnel structure ‚Äì accessed by doors on either end of the stage ‚Äì was unearthed, which would have allowed actors to exit from one side and come on again from the other without being seen by the audience. Fragments of ceramic money boxes were found, which would have been used to collect entry fees from theatregoers, before being taken to an office to be smashed and the money counted: this office was known as the \\"box office\\", which is the origin of the term we use today. Glass beads and pins were unearthed along with drinking vessels and clay pipes. The team also came across a mount and a token, as well as personal items, including a bone comb. In August 2019 the structural remains and below- ground deposits were designated a Scheduled Monument. The high-rise residential tower block on the site is to be named \\"The Stage\\"; and the two adjacent low-rise office blocks \\"The Bard\\" and \\"The Hewett\\".

Centred on a hilltop between Chester-le-Street and Consett, the town lies south west of Gateshead. Stanley was formerly divided into three distinct settlements ‚Äì the main town of West Stanley and the mining villages of East Stanley and South Stanley. Through a process of gradual expansion, these have become amalgamated into one town, with East and South Stanley no longer officially used as town names (although they are still recognised colloquially). The civil parish of Stanley was created in 2007 and takes in not only Stanley, but the villages of Annfield Plain, Tanfield, Craghead, Catchgate, Tantobie, Tanfield Lea, South Moor, White-le-Head, Bloemfontein, Clough Dene, Greencroft, Harelaw, Kip Hill, The Middles, New Kyo, No Place, Oxhill, Quaking Houses, Shield Row, and West Kyo. The current Parish covers the vast majority of the former Stanley Urban District Council area, with the exception of Dipton and Burnopfield. History Stanley was first mentioned in 1211; however, some neolithic and Roman remains have been found in the area. The town's name is derived from the Old English for 'Stoney Field'. In John Speed's map of Co. Durham Stanley appears called Standley. The West Stanley Pit Disaster, one of the worst coal mining disasters in British history took place in Stanley at West Stanley Colliery on 16 February 1909 when over 160 people were killed in the Burns Pit disaster.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/7892096.stm Over recent decades, Stanley has suffered hard times economically, with the closure of the coal pits followed by the loss of major employers at Ever Ready in nearby Tanfield, as well as the closure of both the British Steel plant and Shotley Bridge General Hospital in the neighbouring town of Consett. Local businesses in Stanley town centre were also significantly affected by the development of the giant MetroCentre shopping complex in nearby Gateshead, with local trade decreasing as a result. In 2000, Stanley briefly garnered attention in various national tabloid newspapers as well as BBC Radio 1's Chris Moyles Show when local curry house impresario Harresh Ramadan turned his Indian takeaway restaurant on Front Street into a fish-and-chip shop and renamed it Harry Ramadan's, a spoof on the more famous and well-known Harry Ramsden's chain, with signage in an identical font and colours. The Harry Ramsden's chain sued, citing breach of copyright, with Ramadan backing down shortly after the national publicity had subsided. Soon thereafter, the shop took on new ownership and adopted the new name Jump 4 Joy's before closing down entirely in 2001. In October 2003, plans by Archer and Rostron Ltd. to convert the derelict King's Head pub into a private sex club to be re-christened Daniel's Dudes caused controversy, with over 500 local residents registering formal objections to the plan.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/3209036.stm Faced with this opposition, the company dropped its proposals to open a swingers club on the site and instead converted the venue into a hotel and health spa called The Local Spa, which frequently hosts swingers parties, being considered one of the top swingers venues in the north of the UK.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/3210251.stm In 2005, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister granted permission to plans to form a Stanley Town Council. This followed a campaign by local people, including a petition of over 2000 names, representing 10% of the population that would be covered by the new Town Council. Campaigners promised that the new Town Council would increase the pace of regeneration within the town. In 2008, an arson attack left an historic building on Stanley Front Street in ruins along with a billiards club and several shops below. November 2008 saw the demolition of the burnt buildings. Governance Durham County Council was created in 1888 and covered the whole of County Durham. The Urban District Council area of Stanley was created in 1894. Prior to this, Stanley had been administered for the purposes of the Poor Law and sanitation by the Lanchester Union. The initial Stanley District comprised West Stanley, Shield Row and South Moor, whilst separate Urban District Councils were created in Annfield Plain and Tanfield. After a governance review in 1937, the three Councils were combined and Craghead was transferred from the Lanchester Rural District to form a larger Stanley Urban District. Under the local government re-organisation of 1974, Stanley Urban District was merged with the Consett Urban and Lanchester Rural Districts to create Derwentside District Council, which was the lower tier authority until a further re-organisation in 2009 abolished all the District Councils in County Durham and combined all local government functions into a unitary authority under Durham County Council. Politically the local authority is dominated by the Labour Party, with 7 of the town's 8 allotted seats on Durham County Council being held by the party. The town lies in the North Durham Parliamentary constituency, which it shares with Chester-le- Street, and is represented at Westminster by Labour MP Kevan Jones. Prior to 1983 the town formed part of the Consett constituency (now part of North West Durham). The electoral ward named Stanley had at the 2011 Census a population of 9,053. Geography The town now stretches into what were formerly neighbouring villages and towns such as Annfield Plain to the west and Beamish and Pelton to the east. This sometimes creates confusion over which local authority is responsible for certain areas, particularly around the Durham- Gateshead border to the northeast near the Causey Arch. Economy In recent decades, with the decline of traditional industries and the encroachment of large supermarkets and chain stores, 'Old Stanley' has declined, with many locally owned shops and pubs closing. The town's main shopping area, Front Street, is pedestrianised, housing independent shops alongside large chains such as Boots. A market is held on Front Street on Thursdays and Saturdays. There are also supermarkets such as Asda and Iceland located within the town. Tesco may construct a new supermarket on the Clifford Road Retail Complex site, which currently accommodates the Clearance Bargains store and a range of empty buildings that had previously housed Kwik Save, Presto, a furniture shop, and an indoor-market.http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east- news/evening-chronicle-news/2010/11/30/tesco-hopes-new-shop-will- make-400-jobs-72703-27740910/ Refurbishment of Stanley town centre in recent years has seen the opening of a new solar-powered bus interchange and an extension to the Louisa Centre leisure facility incorporating a new town swimming pool. Future redevelopment will see the opening of a new health centre and a Sure Start children's centre.BBC News: Revamp plan 'new dawn' for town, BBC News, 31 January 2005, last accessed 13 January 2008.  Education As well as a number of primary schools, Stanley contains two secondary schools. These are: * North Durham Academy (in South Stanley ‚Äì connected to South Stanley Infants and Juniors) * Tanfield School, Specialist College of Science and Engineering (in Tanfield next to Stanley) The town is also served by St Bede's Catholic School and Sixth Form College, based in the nearby village of Lanchester. Leisure Stanley from the nearby Consett to Sunderland branch of the Sea to Sea Cycle Route. The Sustrans C2C Cycle Route, a 140-mile (230 km) bicycle route connecting Whitehaven on the west coast of Cumbria to Sunderland on England's north east coast, passes along the southern boundary of Stanley. The Louisa Centre contains various sport and leisure facilities including a fitness suite, 25-metre swimming pool, a nursery and meeting rooms. The Lamplight Arts Centre, founded in 1960 and entirely refurbished in 2003, hosts concerts and recitals by local and national musical acts as well as small plays, exhibitions, classes and seminars. Stanley is renowned for its annual summer playscheme situated at Stanley Youth Centre. This has been running since 1972 and is organised and run by a group of local people, recruiting international volunteers through YAP (Youth Action for Peace). The scheme runs for the first two weeks of the summer holiday, with children participating in games, activities and trips to local cultural and leisure venues. Stanley Youth Centre offers activities to young people Monday to Friday during school term as well as a summer programme. Located at the top of Tyne Road, facilities include a sports hall, pool table, table tennis, meeting rooms and coffee bar. The range of activities available include DJing, volunteering, Duke of Edinburgh Award, babysitting, first aid and youth work courses. The centre closed in 2016 after many decades of work with young people From 1993 ‚Äì 2007, the first weekend in August saw a number of local, national and international Blues artists and renowned musical acts descend on the town for the Stanley Blues Festival.http://www.stanleyblues.co.uk In 2005, The Animals played a set which went down well with locals and visitors alike. However, as of early 2008, organisers announced that the Festival was to be discontinued due to insufficient funding.

He is best known as a drummer, having been a member of two seminal no wave groups in the late 1970s (Teenage Jesus & the Jerks and 8 Eyed Spy, both alongside Lydia Lunch). He is also noted for stints in Sonic Youth and the Cramps, and has been a member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds since 1994. Sclavunos has led his own group the Vanity Set since 2000. Biography Sclavunos, a half-Greek and half-Italian from Brooklyn, New York (known for his exceptional height at 6'7\\"), was memorably described in the pages of The Wire as an \\"infamous elegant degenerate\\". He has long been a prime mover in New York City's vibrant underground music scene, helping to kick-start the vital no wave movement in the late 1970s with Teenage Jesus & the Jerks and 8 Eyed Spy (both with Lydia Lunch), before playing with Sonic Youth and the Cramps. He has also recorded albums with Grinderman, Sonic Youth, Tav Falco's Panther Burns and Congo Norvell as well as recording sessions with many artists including Marianne Faithfull, Iggy Pop, Beth Orton, and Seasick Steve. He has also toured with Lunch, Alex Chilton and Wreckless Eric. A key member of the Bad Seeds since 1994 and a founding member of the Bad Seeds offshoot Grinderman, he also formed his own New York-based musical ensemble The Vanity Set in 2000, releasing two studio albums to date. Further to his work as a musician, Sclavunos has produced a wide range of bands including Gogol Bordello, the Horrors, the Jim Jones Revue, Black Moth and Teenage Mothers (Lead guitarist and co-vocalist Raph Brous has dedicated his upcoming novel, Empire of Ants, to him). He has done several remixes, both on his own and as one half of Silver Alert (along with Vanity Set bandmate Peter Mavrogeorgis). In 2012, Silver Alert performed \\"Faustian Pact\\" at the Perth International Arts Festival in Western Australia, a live adaptation of FW Murnau's film Faust, produced in collaboration with director/choreographer Micki Pellerano. In 2012, Sclavunos began an ongoing collaboration with Australian performance artist/musician Michaela Davies on a composition titled \\"FM-2030\\" (named for the transhumanist philosopher Fereidoun M. Esfandiary) utilizing programmed electro-muscular stimulation of classical string players to generate involuntary playing movements. The composition premiered at the 2013 Sonica Festival in Glasgow. =1976-77= While attending NYU School of Arts, Jim Sclavunos co-founded No Magazine, an underground fanzine devoted to coverage of NY punk rock and the burgeoning No Wave movement. He briefly fronted his own band Mimi And The Dreamboats, before joining No Wave bands Red Transistor, and The Gynecologists with avant-garde composer Rhys Chatham and Nina Canal to play drums. =1978-79= In 1977 Sclavunos joined Lydia Lunch‚Äôs band Teenage Jesus and the Jerks as bass guitarist, releasing both an EP Baby Doll (1979) and a compilation mini-album on pink vinyl on Lust/Unlust. A short-lived side-project with Lydia called Beirut Slump, features Sclavunos‚Äô first recorded work as drummer on the group's single \\"Try Me / Staircase\\" (1979) on Migraine. Following their European tour in June 1979, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks broke up, and Lydia and Jim joined 8 Eyed Spy. =1980-83= In 1981, following the death of bass player George Scott, 8 Eyed Spy released a self-titled album on Fetish (UK) and cassette compilation on cassette only label ROIR (US). Sclavunos designed the covers for both the ROIR 8 Eyed Spy release and for Suicide‚Äôs Half Alive album (1981). In 1980, Lydia and Jim formed a short-lived blues project, The Devil Dogs touring the Midwest. Jim also did a short East Coast tour with Alex Chilton, before moving to Memphis and joining Alex‚Äôs side-project Tav Falco's Panther Burns, ultimately releasing an EP Blow Your Top (1982). Playing saxophone on Lydia Lunch‚Äôs In Limbo album (1984), Sclavunos meets and plays with Thurston Moore. Invited to join Sonic Youth following year, he played drums on their first album Confusion Is Sex for Glenn Branca‚Äôs Neutral label. =1984-89= Co-founding Trigger & the Thrill Kings with Dutch singer Truus DeGroot, the duo toured extensively throughout The Netherlands and Germany with various line-ups including Jim Duckworth on guitar and Annene Kaye on keyboards.

In the Fall of 1991 Sclavunos left Los Angeles to be reunited with Lydia Lunch, touring Europe with her and Rowland S. Howard under the band name Shotgun Wedding; live recordings were later released under various titles, including Shotgun Wedding Live In Siberia. =1993-94= Sclavunos both lived in and toured Europe with Wreckless Eric and Tav Falco's Panther Burns in the period 1992 ‚Äì 1994. While living in Vienna, Austria, he played drums on, and arranged Panther Burns‚Äô Shadow Dancer album in 1992 (released on Intercord in 1995). He records Music to Remember Him By (Priority, 1994) with Congo Norvell, produced Mick Harvey of The Birthday Party and Bad Seeds. This collaboration led to a subsequent invitation to join Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds 1994 Let Love In European tour as organist/ percussionist. Sclavunos stayed on for their US Lollapalooza tour and became a permanent member that same year. Sclavunos generally plays a variety of auxiliary percussion with the Bad Seeds (e.g., vibraphone, maracas, cowbell, tubular bells), while Thomas Wydler plays a standard drum kit. But when Wylder was sidelined with health problems circa 2013 and unable to tour, Sclavunos took over the drums and has also doubled on keyboards during live performances. =1995-99= Playing percussion and drums, Sclavunos records the Murder Ballads album (1996, Reprise) with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, including the UK charting duet single with Kylie Minogue \\"Where the Wild Roses Grow\\".

According to the Journal Citation Reports, the Harvard Law Review's 2015 impact factor of 4.979 placed the journal first out of 143 journals in the category \\"Law\\". It is published monthly from November through June, with the November issue dedicated to covering the previous year's term of the Supreme Court of the United States. The journal also publishes the online-only Harvard Law Review Forum, a rolling journal of scholarly responses to the main journal's content. The Harvard Law Review Association, in conjunction with the Columbia Law Review, the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, and the Yale Law Journal, publishes the Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation, a widely followed authority for legal citation formats in the United States. History The Harvard Law Review published its first issue on April 15, 1887, making it one of the oldest operating student- edited law reviews in the United States. The establishment of the journal was largely due to the support of Louis Brandeis, then a recent Harvard Law School alumnus and Boston attorney who would later go on to become a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. From the 1880s to the 1970s, editors were selected on the basis of their grades; the president of the Review was the student with the highest academic rank. The first female editor of the journal was Priscilla Holmes (1953-1955, Volumes 67-68); the first woman to serve as the journal's president was Susan Estrich (1977), who later was active in Democratic Party politics and became the youngest woman to receive tenure at Harvard Law School; its first non-white ethnic minority president was Raj Marphatia (1988, Volume 101), who is now a partner at the Boston law firm of Ropes & Gray; its first African-American president was the 44th President of the United States Barack Obama (1991); its first openly gay president was Mitchell Reich (2011); its first Latino president was Andrew M. Crespo, who is now tenured as a professor at Harvard Law School. The first female African- American president, ImeIme Umana, was elected in 2017. Gannett House, a white building constructed in the Greek Revival style that was popular in New England during the mid-to-late 19th century, has been home to the Harvard Law Review since the 1920s. Before moving into Gannett House, the journal resided in the Law School's Austin Hall. Since the change of criteria in the 1970s, grades are no longer the primary basis of selection for editors. Membership in the Harvard Law Review is offered to select Harvard law students based on first-year grades and performance in a writing competition held at the end of the first year except for twelve slots that are offered on a discretionary basis. The writing competition includes two components: an edit of an unpublished article and an analysis of a recent United States Supreme Court or Court of Appeals case. The writing competition submissions are graded blindly to assure anonymity. Fourteen editors (two from each 1L section) are selected based on a combination of their first-year grades and their competition scores. Twenty editors are selected based solely on their competition scores. The remaining twelve editors are selected on a discretionary basis. According to the law review's webpage, \\"Some of these discretionary slots may be used to implement the Review's affirmative action policy.\\" The president of the Harvard Law Review is elected by the other editors. It has been a long tradition, apparently since the first issue, that the works of students published in the Harvard Law Review are called \\"notes,\\" and they are unsigned as part of a policy reflecting \\"the fact that many members of the Review besides the author make a contribution to each published piece.\\" In 2012, Harvard Law Review had 1,722 paid subscriptions.https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/06/the- nonsense-factory-the-making-and-breaking-of-the-american-legal-system.html Alumni Volume 1 of the Harvard Law Review (1887‚Äì1888).

It was called in 1937 and reported in 1940. The Commission was chaired first by Newton Wesley Rowell and then by Joseph Sirois. James McGregor Stewart acted as chief counsel. It was called as a result of the Great Depression. The attempts to manage the Depression by the government illustrated grave flaws with the Canadian constitution. While the federal government had most of the revenue gathering powers, the provinces had unexpectedly greater expenditure responsibilities. The founders had given the provinces responsibility for health care, education, and welfare when these were only minor concerns; by 1937, however, these had all become massive expenditure areas. The Commission recommended that the federal government take over control of unemployment insurance and pensions. It also recommended the creation of equalization payments and large transfers of money from the federal government to the province each year. Other recommendations were not adopted due to resistance from the provinces or the federal government.

(If the transaction was fraudulent, it probably does not have the legal status of a contract.) Intrinsic fraud is distinguished from extrinsic fraud (a/k/a collateral fraud) which is a deceptive means of keeping a person from discovering and/or enforcing legal rights. It is possible to have both intrinsic and extrinsic frauds. During a trial, perjury, forgery, and bribery of a witness constitute frauds that might have been relieved by the court. Such actions will usually lead to a mistrial being declared and after any penalties for the involved parties a new trial will take place on the same matter. Two types of intrinsic fraud in contract law are fraud in the inducement and fraud in the factum. Fraud in the factum is a legal defense, and occurs where A signs a contract, but either does not realize that it is a contract or does not understand the nature of the contract, because of some false information that B gave to A. For example, if John tells his mother that he is taking a college course on handwriting analysis, and for his homework, he needs her to read and sign a pretend deed. If Mom signs the deed believing what he told her, and John tries to enforce the deed, Mom can plead \\"fraud in the factum.\\" Fraud in the inducement is an equitable defense, and occurs when A signs a contract, knowing that it is a contract and (at least having a rough idea) what the contract is about, but the reason A signed the contract was because of some false information that B gave to A. For example, if John tells his mother to sign a deed giving him her property, Mom refuses at first, then John explains that the deed will be kept in a safe deposit box until she dies. If Mom signs the deed because of this statement from John, and John tries to enforce the deed prior to Mom's death, Mom can plead \\"fraud in the inducement.\\" See also *Extrinsic fraud *Fraud *Per minas *Scienter * Intrinsic Fraud reference  References  Contract law Fraud ","title":"Intrinsic fraud"},{"id":"606282","text":"Calavera oaxaque√±a, 1903, one of his many broadsheets. Jos√© Guadalupe Posada Aguilar (1852 ‚Äì 1913) was a Mexican political lithographer who used relief printing to produce popular illustrations. His work has influenced numerous Latin American artists and cartoonists because of its satirical acuteness and social engagement. He used skulls, calaveras, and bones to convey political and cultural critiques. Among his most enduring works is La Calavera Catrina. Early life and education Posada's La Calavera Catrina. Posada was born in Aguascalientes on February 2, 1852. His father was Germ√°n Posada Serna and his mother Petra Aguilar Portillo. Posada was one of eight children and received his early education from his older brother Cirilo, a country school teacher. Posada's brother taught him reading, writing and drawing. He then joined La Academia Municipal de Dibujo de Aguascalientes (the Municipal Drawing Academy of Aguascalientes). Later, in 1868, as a teenager he apprenticed in the workshop of Jose Trinidad Pedroza, who taught him lithography and engraving. Some of Posada's first political cartoons were published in El Jicote. In 1871, before he was out of his teens, his career began with a job as the political cartoonist for a local newspaper in Aguascalientes, El Jicote (\\"The Bumblebee\\"). The newspaper closed after 11 issues, reputedly because one of Posada's cartoons had offended a powerful local politician.History of Mexico - Mexico's Daumier: Josejhg Guadalupe Posada, Jim Tuck, Mexico Connect In 1872, Posada and Pedroza dedicated themselves to commercial lithography in Le√≥n, Guanajuato. While in Leon, Posada opened his own workshop and worked as a teacher of lithography at the local secondary school. He also continued his work with lithographs and wood engravings. In 1873, he returned to his home in Aguascalientes City where married Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Vela in 1875. The following year he purchased the printing press from Pedroza. From 1875 to 1888, Posada continued to collaborate with several newspapers in Le√≥n, including La Gacetilla, el Pueblo Ca√≥tico and La education. He survived the great flood of Le√≥n on June 18, 1888, of which he published several lithographs representing the tragedy in which more than two hundred and fifty corpses were found and more than 1,400 people were reported missing. At the end of 1888, he moved to Mexico City, where he learned the craft and technique of engraving in lead and zinc. He collaborated with the newspaper La Patria Ilustrada and the Revisita de Mexico until the early months of 1890. Career as artist Reproduction of the restored Gran calavera el√©ctrica (Grand electric skull), by Posada 1900-1913. The Calavera Maderista, in the Museo Nacional de Arte, Mexico City. The workshop of Posada, Mexico, ca 1900. He began to work with Antonio Vanegas Arroyo, until he was able to establish his own lithographic workshop. From then on Posada undertook work that earned him popular acceptance and admiration, for his sense of humor, and propensity concerning the quality of his work. In his broad and varied work, Posada portrayed beliefs, daily lifestyles of popular groups, the abuses of government and the exploitation of the common people. He illustrated the famous skulls, along with other illustrations that became popular as they were distributed to various newspapers and periodicals. In 1883, following his success, he was hired as a teacher of lithography at the local Preparatory School. The shop flourished until 1888 when a disastrous flood hit the city. He subsequently moved to Mexico City. His first regular employment in the capital was with La Patria Ilustrada, whose editor was Ireneo Paz, the grandfather of the later famed writer Octavio Paz. He later joined the staff of a publishing firm owned by Antonio Vanegas Arroyo and while at this firm he created a prolific number of book covers and illustrations. Much of his work was also published in sensationalistic broadsides depicting various current events. From the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910 until his death in 1913, Posada worked tirelessly in the press. The works he completed in his press during this time allowed him to develop his artistic prowess as a draftsman, engraver and lithographer. At the time he continued to make satirical illustrations and cartoons featured in the magazine, El Jicote. He played a crucial role for the government during the presidency of Francisco I Madero and during the campaign of Emiliano Zapata. Notable works Posada's best known works are his calaveras, which often assume various costumes, such as the La Calavera Catrina, she is offered as a satirical portrait of those Mexican natives who, Posada felt, were aspiring to adopt European aristocratic traditions in the pre-revolution era. Later life Largely forgotten by the end of his life, Jos√© Guadalupe Posada died in 1913. Three of his neighbors certified his death, only one of them knew his full name. Legacy Sunday Afternoon in Alameda Park\\" mural (1946-1947), showing Posada in a bourgeois costume parody. The Day of the Dead is usually celebrated in Central and Southern Mexico during the chilly days of November 1 & 2 Academics have estimated that during his long career, Posada produced 20,000 plus images for broadsheets, pamphlets and chapbooks. Posada was studied by key figures of Mexican muralism. Mural artists inspired by Posada, such as Diego Rivera and Jos√© Clemente Orozco catered to a Mexican elite that rejected foreign styles as part of their new-found bourgeois taste. In the 1920s the US and Mexico based publicist Jean Charlot popularized Posada's broadsides. In 1929 Anita Brenner published the book Idols Behind Altars, using Posada's illustrations. Brenner called Posada a prophet and linked him to the Mexica, peasants and workers. The US author Frances Toor promoted Posada as folklore with her 1930 book Posada: Grabador Mexicano. Rivera commented on 406 engravings by Posada in the foreword for the book. When Leopoldo M√©ndez returned from the Cultural Missions programs of the Mexican Secretariat of Public Education in Jalisco, M√©ndez got to know about Posada's prints and adopted him as artistic and cultural hero. One of M√©ndez's last projects was a study of Posada, were M√©ndez reproduced over 900 Posada illustrations.

It is part of National Museums Liverpool and an Anchor Point of ERIH, The European Route of Industrial Heritage. It opened for a trial season in 1980 before fully opening in 1984 and expanding in 1986. The museum occupies warehouse block D at the Albert Dock, along with the Piermaster's House, Canning Half Tide Dock and Canning Graving Docks. The city's seafaring heritage is brought to life within the historic Albert Dock. The museum's collections reflect the international importance of Liverpool as a gateway to the world, including its role in the transatlantic slave trade and emigration, the merchant navy and the RMS Titanic. The UK Border Agency National Museum, 'Seized! The Border and Customs uncovered' is located in the basement gallery of the building.  History  The embryonic Merseyside Maritime Museum collection began in 1862. Over the years, the collection developed slowly due to lack of funds to the extent that by 1924 the collection was little more than 'an old dug-out canoe and a few model ships'. Robert Gladstone (maritime historian and great-nephew of former Prime Minister William Gladstone) created the shipping gallery in 1931 which was partially destroyed in the May Blitz of 1941. In 1965, the History of the Ship gallery was opened followed by the Port of Liverpool gallery (1971) and the New Shipperies Exhibition (1974). In late 1970s work began on the creation of a dedicated maritime museum which opened for a trial season in 1980.

XSL-FO is part of XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language), a set of W3C technologies designed for the transformation and formatting of XML data. The other parts of XSL are XSLT and XPath. Version 1.1 of XSL-FO was published in 2006. XSL-FO is considered feature complete by W3C: the last update for the Working Draft was in January 2012, and its Working Group closed in November 2013. Basics Unlike the combination of HTML and CSS, XSL-FO is a unified presentational language. It has no semantic markup as this term is used in HTML. And, unlike CSS which modifies the default presentation of an external XML or HTML document, it stores all of the document's data within itself. The general idea behind XSL- FO's use is that the user writes a document, not in FO, but in an XML language. XHTML, DocBook, and TEI are all possible examples. Then, the user obtains an XSLT transform, either by writing one themselves or by finding one for the document type in question. This XSLT transform converts the XML into XSL-FO. Once the XSL-FO document is generated, it is then passed to an application called an FO processor. FO processors convert the XSL-FO document into something that is readable, printable or both. The most common output of XSL-FO is a PDF file or as PostScript, but some FO processors can output to other formats like RTF files or even just a window in the user's GUI displaying the sequence of pages and their contents. The XSLT language itself was originally conceived only for this purpose; it is now in widespread use for more general XML transformations. This transformation step is taken so much for granted in XSL-FO that it is not uncommon for people to call the XSLT that turns XML into XSL-FO the actual XSL-FO document itself. Even tutorials on XSL-FO tend to be written with XSLT commands around the FO processing instructions. The XSLT transformation step is exceptionally powerful. It allows for the automatic generation of a table of contents, linked references, an index, and various other possibilities. An XSL-FO document is not like a PDF or a PostScript document. It does not definitively describe the layout of the text on various pages. Instead, it describes what the pages look like and where the various contents go. From there, an FO processor determines how to position the text within the boundaries described by the FO document. The XSL- FO specification even allows different FO processors to have varying responses with regard to the resultant generated pages. For example, some FO processors can hyphenate words to minimize space when breaking a line, while others choose not to. Different processors may even use different hyphenation algorithms, ranging from very simple to more complex hyphenation algorithms that take into account whether the previous or next line also is hyphenated. These will change, in some borderline cases quite substantially, the layout of the various pages. There are other cases where the XSL-FO specification explicitly allows FO processors some degree of choice with regard to layout. This differentiation between FO processors, creating inconsistent results between processors is often not a concern. This is because the general purpose behind XSL-FO is to generate paged, printed media. XSL-FO documents themselves are usually used as intermediaries, mostly to generate either PDF files or a printed document as the final form to be distributed. This is as opposed to how HTML is generated and distributed as a final form directly to the user. Distributing the final PDF rather than the formatting language input (whether HTML/CSS or XSL-FO) means on the one hand that recipients aren't affected by the unpredictability resulting from differences among formatting language interpreters, while on the other hand means that the document cannot easily adapt to different recipient needs, such as different page size or preferred font size, or tailoring for on-screen versus on-paper versus audio presentation. Language concepts The XSL-FO language was designed for paged media; as such, the concept of pages is an integral part of XSL-FO's structure. FO works best for what could be called \\"content-driven\\" design. This is the standard method of layout for books, articles, legal documents, and so forth. It involves a single flowing span of fairly contiguous text, with various repeating information built into the margins of a page. This is as opposed to \\"layout-driven\\" design, which is used in newspapers or magazines. If content in those documents does not fit in the required space, some of it is trimmed away until it does fit. XSL-FO does not easily handle the tight restrictions of magazine layout; indeed, in many cases, it lacks the ability to express some forms of said layout. Despite the basic nature of the language's design, it is capable of a great deal of expressiveness. Tables, lists, side floats, and a variety of other features are available. These features are comparable to CSS's layout features, though some of those features are expected to be built by the XSLT. Document structure XSL-FO documents are XML documents, but they do not have to conform to any DTD or schema. Instead, they conform to a syntax defined in the XSL-FO specification. XSL-FO documents contain two required sections. The first section details a list of named page layouts. The second section is a list of document data, with markup, that uses the various page layouts to determine how the content fills the various pages. Page layouts define the properties of the page. They can define the directions for the flow of text, so as to match the conventions for the language in question. They define the size of a page as well as the margins of that page. More importantly, they can define sequences of pages that allow for effects where the odd and even pages look different. For example, one can define a page layout sequence that gives extra space to the inner margins for printing purposes; this allows more space to be given to the margin where the book will be bound. The document data portion is broken up into a sequence of flows, where each flow is attached to a page layout. The flows contain a list of blocks which, in turn, each contain a list of text data, inline markup elements, or a combination of the two. Content may also be added to the margins of the document, for page numbers, chapter headings and the like. Blocks and inline elements function in much the same way as for CSS, though some of the rules for padding and margins differ between FO and CSS. The direction, relative to the page orientation, for the progression of blocks and inlines can be fully specified, thus allowing FO documents to function under languages that are read different from English. The language of the FO specification, unlike that of CSS 2.1, uses direction-neutral terms like start and end rather than left and right when describing these directions. XSL-FO's basic content markup is derived from CSS and its cascading rules. As such, many attributes in XSL-FO propagate into the child elements unless explicitly overridden. Capabilities of XSL-FO v1.0 XSL-FO is capable of a great deal of textual layout functionality. In addition to the information as specified above, XSL-FO's language allows for the specification of the following. =Multiple columns= A page can be defined to have multiple columns. When this is the case, blocks flow from one column into the next by default. Individual blocks can be set to span all columns, creating a textual break in the page. The columns above this break will flow into each other, as will the columns below the break. But no text is allowed to flow from the above section to the below section. Because of the nature of XSL-FO's page specification, multiple pages may actually have different numbers and widths of columns. As such, text can flow from a 3 column page to a 5 column page to a 1 column page quite easily. All FO features work within the restrictions of a multi-column page. We can span multiple columns by specifying two attributes i.e.,. span, padding-after . =Lists= An XSL-FO list is, essentially, two sets of blocks stacked side by side. An entry consists of a block on the \\"left\\", or start inline direction, and a block sequence on the \\"right\\", or end inline direction. The block on the left is conceptually what would be the number or bullet in a list. However, it could just as easily be a string of text, as one might see in a glossary entry. The block on the right works as expected. Both of these blocks can be block containers, or have multiple blocks in a single list entry. Numbering of XSL-FO lists, when they are numbered, is expected to be done by the XSLT, or whatever other process, that generated the XSL-FO document. As such, number lists are to be explicitly numbered in XSL-FO. =Pagination controls= The user can specify Widow and Orphan for blocks or for the flow itself, and allow the attributes to cascade into child blocks. Additionally, blocks can be specified to be kept together on a single page. For example, an image block and the description of that image can be set to never be separated. The FO processor will do its best to adhere to these commands, even if it requires creating a great deal of empty space on a page. =Footnotes= The user can create footnotes that appear at the bottom of a page. The footnote is written, in the FO document, in the regular flow of text at the point where it is referenced. The reference is represented as an inline definition, though it is not required. The body is one or more blocks that are placed by the FO processor to the bottom of the page. The FO processor guarantees that wherever the reference is, the footnote cited by that reference will begin on the same page. This will be so even if it means creating extra empty space on a page. =Tables= An FO table functions much like an HTML/CSS table. The user specifies rows of data for each individual cell. The user can, also, specify some styling information for each column, such as background color. Additionally, the user can specify the first row as a table header row, with its own separate styling information. The FO processor can be told exactly how much space to give each column, or it can be told to auto-fit the text in the table. =Text orientation controls= FO has extensive controls for orienting blocks of text. One can, in the middle of a page, designate a block of text to be oriented in a different orientation. These oriented blocks can be used for languages in a different orientation from the rest of the document, or simply if one needs to orient the text for layout purposes. These blocks can contain virtually any kind of content, from tables to lists or even other blocks of reoriented text. =Miscellaneous= * Page number citations. A page that contains a special tag can be cited in text, and the FO processor will fill in the actual page number where this tag appears. * Block borders, in a number of styles. * Background colors and images. * Font controls and weighting, as in CSS. * Side floats. * Miscellaneous Inline Elements. Capabilities of XSL-FO v1.1 Version 1.1 of XSL-FO adds a number of new features to version 1.0. =Multiple flows and flow mapping= XSL-FO 1.0 was fairly restrictive about what text was allowed to go in what areas of a page. Version 1.1 loosens these restrictions significantly, allowing flowing text to be mapped into multiple explicit regions on a page. This allows for more newspaper-like typesetting. =Bookmarks= Many output formats for XSL-FO processors, specifically PDF, have bookmarking features. These allow the format to specify a string of text in a separate window that can be selected by the user. When selected, the document window scrolls immediately to a specific region of the document. XSL- FO v1.1 now provides the ability to create named bookmarks in XSL-FO, thus allowing the processor to pass this on to an output format that supports it. =Indexing= XSL-FO 1.1 has features that support the generation of an index that might be found at the back of a book. This is done through referencing of properly marked-up elements in the FO document. =Last page citation= The last page can be generated without providing an explicit in-document reference to a specific anchor in the FO document. The definition of \\"last page\\" can be restricted to within a specific set of pages or to cover the entire document. This allows the user to specify something like, \\"Page 2 out of 15\\", where page 15 is the page number of a last page definition. =Table markers= Table markers allow the user to create dynamic content within table headers and footers, such as running totals at the bottom of each page of a table or \\"table continued\\" indicators. =Inside/outside floats= XSL-FO 1.1 adds the keywords \\"inside\\" and \\"outside\\" for side floats, which makes it possible to achieve page layouts with marginalia positioned on the outside or inside edges of pages. Inside refers to the side of the page towards the book binding, and outside refers to the side of a page away from the book binding. =Refined graphic sizing= XSL-FO 1.1 refines the functionality for sizing of graphics to fit, with the ability to shrink to fit (but not grow to fit), as well as the ability to define specific scaling steps. In addition, the resulting scaling factor can be referenced for display (for example, to say in a figure caption, \\"image shown is 50% actual size\\"). Advantages * XML language ‚Äì Because it is an XML language, only an XSLT transform (and an XSLT processor) is required to generate XSL-FO code from any XML language. One can easily write a document in TEI or DocBook, and transform it into HTML for web viewing or PDF (through an FO processor) for printing. In fact, there are many pre- existing TEI and DocBook XSLTs for both of these purposes. * Ease of use ‚Äì Another advantage of XSL-FO is the relative ease of use. Much of the functionality of the language is based on work from CSS, so a CSS user will be familiar with the basics of the markup attributes. Understanding what a specific section of an FO document will look like is usually quite easy. * Low cost ‚Äì Compared with commercial typesetting and page layout products, XSL-FO can offer a much lower cost solution when it otherwise meets the typographic and layout requirements (see below). The initial cost of ownership is low (zero if the free implementations, such as Apache FOP and xmlroff, meet your requirements), especially compared to the cost of commercial composition tools. The skills required (primarily XSLT programming) are widely available. There are a number of good books on XSL-FO as well as online resources and an active user community. * Multi-lingual ‚Äì XSL-FO has been designed to work for all written human languages and the implementations have largely achieved that goal. This makes XSL-FO particularly well suited for composing documents localized into a large number of national languages where the requirement is to have a single tool set that can compose all the language versions of documents. This is especially valuable for technical documentation for things like consumer electronics, where Asian and Middle Eastern languages are important because those parts of world represent huge markets for things like mobile phones and computer peripherals. * Mature standard ‚Äì With the publication of XSL-FO 1.1, XSL-FO is proving to be a mature standard with a number of solid commercial and non-commercial implementations. There is no other comparable standard for page composition. Drawbacks * Limited capabilities ‚Äì XSL-FO was specifically designed to meet the requirements of \\"lightly designed\\" documents typified by technical manuals, business documents, invoices, and so on. While it can be and is used for more sophisticated designs, it is inherently limited in what it can do from a layout and typographic perspective. In particular, XSL-FO does not provide a direct way to get formatting effects that depend on knowing the page position relationship of two formatting objects. For example, there is no direct way to say \\"if this thing is on the same page as that thing, then do X, otherwise do Y\\". This is an explicit design decision reflecting the two-stage, transform- based abstract processing model used by XSL-FO. This limitation can be addressed by implementing a multi-pass process. Unfortunately, there is currently no standard for how the result of the first pass would be communicated back to the second pass. Most, if not all, implementations provide some form of processable intermediate result format that can be used for this, but any such process implemented today would, by necessity, be implementation specific. * By the same token, there are important layout features that are simply not in XSL-FO, either because they were not of high enough priority or because designing them was too difficult to allow inclusion in version 1.1, or because there were insufficient implementations to allow their inclusion in the final specification per W3C rules. * In addition to these architectural limitations, the current XSL-FO implementations, both commercial and open source, do not provide the same level of typographic sophistication provided by high-end layout tools like QuarkXPress or InDesign, or by programmable typesetting systems like LaTeX. For example, no current implementation provides features for ensuring that text lines on facing pages are lined up vertically. There is nothing in the XSL-FO specification that prevents it but nothing that requires it either. For most documents for which a completely automated composition solution is sufficient, that level of typographic sophistication is not needed. However, for high-end publications and mass-market books, it usually is; in some cases this can be met by using XSLT to generate a LaTeX document instead. * Extension dependency ‚Äì When considering the applicability of XSL-FO to a particular document or document design, one must consider proprietary extensions provided by the different XSL-FO implementations. These extensions add features that are not part of the core specification. For example, one product adds support for Japanese typographic conventions that the XSL-FO specification does not address. However, use of these features makes such an XSL-FO system a little more bound to a specific implementation (but not completely bound as it would be when using a totally proprietary composition system.) * Impractical manual editing ‚Äì It is generally impractical to edit XSL-FO instances by hand (XSL-FO was designed for clarity and completeness, not ease of editing.). Visual editing tools such as XFDesigner can alleviate the task, although not all XSL-FO tags are accessible (most notably markers and footnotes). XF Designer is no longer a supported product from Ecrion Software. When trying to decide whether or not XSL-FO will work for a given document, the following typographic and layout requirements usually indicate that XSL-FO will not work (although some of these may be satisfied by proprietary extensions): *Need to restart footnote numbers or symbol sequence on each new page (however, some implementations provide extensions to support automatic footnote numbering.) *Need to run text around both sides of a floated object (XSL-FO can run text around one side and the top and/or bottom, but not both sides; however, some implementations provide support for such complex layouts via proprietary extensions.) *Need to have variable numbers of columns on a single page (however, at least two commercial implementations provide extensions for creating multi-column blocks within a page.) *Need to have column-wide footnotes (several implementations provide column footnote extensions.) *Need to have marginalia that are dynamically placed relative to other marginalia (for example, marginal notes that are evenly spaced vertically on the page). XSL-FO only provides features for placing marginalia so that it is vertically aligned with its anchor. *Need to create content that spreads across two pages as a float or \\"out of line\\" object in an otherwise homogeneous sequence of repeating page masters (this can be done in XSL-FO 1.1 using multiple body regions and flow maps, but it requires being able to control the page masters used for those pages.) *Need both bottom-floated content and footnotes on the same page. *Need to be able to run text against an arbitrary curve (though some implementation support SVG, which can be used to get around this limitation). *Need to be able to constrain lines to specific baseline grids (for example, to achieve exact registration of lines on facing pages.) *Anything that requires page-aware layout, such as ensuring that a figure always occurs on the page facing its anchor point.  Replacement  XML and HTML standards, with the CSS standard, since CSS2 (paged media module) starts to supply basic features to printed media. With the CSS Paged Media Module Level 3, W3C is completing the formulation of an integrated standard for document formatting and to generate PDFs. So, since 2013, CSS3-paged is a W3C proposal for an XSL-FO replacement. Software products like Prince and Antenna House Formatter have demonstrated comparable quality of XSL-FO (but using CSS) in the PDF production. Design notes for a Version 2.0 of XSL Formatting Objects were first published in 2009 and last updated in 2012.

Early life  Kim Jong-pil was born in Buyeo County, Chungcheongnam-do. He was educated as Hwangukshinmin seosa (Ìô©Íµ≠Ïã†ÎØºÏÑúÏÇ¨) education victim of Japanese imperial rule from the age of 8 until he was 19, when Japanese rule was suppressed. He graduated from the Korea Military Academy in 1949 (KMA class No. 8). He studied in the USA in 1951 and participated in the Korean War as an intelligence officer of the Republic of Korea Army.  Political career  After 4.19 citizen & students uprising against President Rhee dictatorship and illegal poll in 1960, he participated in the May 16 coup led by Major General Park Chung-hee in 1961 and served in several high-profile offices, including Chairman of the ruling Democratic Republican Party during Park's presidency eighteen years until assassination in 1979. In 1962, he concluded the diplomatic relationship with Japan (ÌïúÏùºÏàòÍµê) after Imperial Japanese rule of Korea (1910‚Äì1945). Japanese rule of Daeil Cheongoogwon (ÎåÄÏùºÏ≤≠Íµ¨Í∂å) was used as seed money for economic development of Pohang steel and Gyeonbu expressway to achieve Han river economic miracle. The poverty of 60 dollars income to 30,000 dollars strong economy of South Korea. Income went from 60 South Korean won to 30,000 South Korean won, representing a strong economy. In 1963, he founded the Democratic Republican Party (South Korea) (ÎØºÏ£ºÍ≥µÌôîÎãπ). From 1971 to 1975, he served as Prime Minister of South Korea. He assumed the same position from 1998 to 2000. The outline of Kim Jong-pil's positions hardly describes the skill of the politician in navigating the complexities of the South Korean politics. Scholars note that he mastered the art of political coalitions. This is demonstrated in the way he was able to reemerge politically stronger after suffering various political setbacks. For instance, by October 1997, Kim Jong-pil's popularity had fluctuated hovering between 2.9 percent and 4.6 percent and this was attributed to his reputation as a previous coup instigator. This was further aggravated by the conservative party's image problem, which was identified with old politicians who have ethical flaws. Through clever political maneuvering, however, Kim Jong-pil struck a power-sharing deal with Kim Dae- jung's NCNP party, which allowed him to choose half of the prime ministers (Íµ≠Î¨¥Ï¥ùÎ¶¨) 2nd top cabinet members of the Kim Dae-Jung administration as DJP Yenjeong (DJPÏó∞Ï†ï). The deal also included his nomination as acting prime minister in March 1998, then prime minister months later during Kim Daejung president period of 1998‚Äì2002. In 2004, he announced his retirement from politics after his bid for a tenth term in the National Assembly failed and his party, the United Liberal Democrats, was unable to gain a sizable number of seats in the 2004 parliamentary election. The party later merged into Grand National Party.  Scouting  He served as Korea Scout Association President until June 6, 1969. In 1967 he received the highest distinction of the Scout Association of Japan, the Golden Pheasant Award.reinanzaka- sc.o.oo7.jp/kiroku/documents/20140523-3-kiji-list.pdf  Ancestry  In a 2001 sentimental letter written to Bhimlendra Mohan Pratap Mishra, a king of erstwhile Ayodhya state with a history of 200 years old, Kim talked about his March 2001 visit to India.

The Great Cipher was so named because of its excellence and because it was reputed to be unbreakable. Modified forms were in use by the French Peninsular army until the summer of 1811,Urban 2004, p. 104 and after it fell out of current use many documents in the French archives were unreadable.  Historical background  Antoine Rossignol's cryptographic skills became known when in 1626 an encrypted letter was taken from a messenger leaving the city of R√©almont, controlled by the Huguenots and surrounded by the French army. The letter told that the Huguenots would not be able to hold on to the city for much longer, and by the end of the day Rossignol had successfully deciphered it. The French returned the letter with the deciphered message, forcing the Huguenots to surrender. He and his son, Bonaventure Rossignol, were soon appointed to prominent roles in the court. Together, the two devised a cipher so strong it baffled cryptanalysts for centuries. Commandant √âtienne Bazeries managed to break the cipher around 1893 over a period of three years, realizing that each number stood for a French syllable rather than single letters as traditional ciphers did. He guessed that a particular sequence of repeated numbers, 124-22-125-46-345, stood for les ennemis (\\"the enemies\\") and from that information was able to unravel the entire cipher. = The Man in the Iron Mask = In one of the encrypted letters between Louis XIV and his marshal Nicolas de Catinat appeared a possible solution to the mystery of the Man in the Iron Mask.Kahn, 2005, p. 45 The letter concerned a general named Vivien de Bulonde who was to attack the Italian town of Cuneo but instead fled, fearing the arrival of the Austrians, and consequently put in serious danger the success of the entire French campaign in Piedmont. The letter said: :His Majesty knows better than any other person the consequences of this act, and he is also aware of how deeply our failure to take the place will prejudice our cause, a failure which must be repaired during the winter. His Majesty desires that you immediately arrest General Bulonde and cause him to be conducted to the fortress of Pignerole, where he will be locked in a cell under guard at night, and permitted to walk the battlement during the day with a 330 309. The \\"330\\" and \\"309\\" codegroups appeared only once in the correspondence, so it is impossible to confirm what they stand for. Bazeries verified General Bulonde was disgraced and removed from command, so he reasoned 330 and 309 stood for masque and a full stop.Kahn 2005, p. 45 However, none of the cipher variants used in the Iron Mask period included masque, an unlikely word to include in the cipher's small repertory.Kahn 2005, p. 46  Technical nature of the Cipher  One of many nomenclators used to encode the Great Cipher. The basis of the code cracked by Bazeries was a set of 587 numbers that stood for syllables.Singh There were other variations, and Louis XIV's overseas ministers were sent different code sheets that encrypted not only syllables but also letters and words.Urban 2004, p. 104 To counter frequency analysis, some number sets were \\"nulls\\" meant to be ignored by the intended recipient. Others were traps, including a codegroup that meant to ignore the previous codegroup. As a nomenclator cipher, the Great Cipher replaced the names of key generals such as Auguste de Marmont, references to les ennemis, and other sensitive terms with homophonic substitutions.Kahn 2005, p. 47 Code sheets included alternative digits to modify the gender or letter case,Urban 2003, p. 111 so the rules of French composition held true to encryptions as well. Since e is the most commonly used letter in French, the Cipher typically allocated the most code numbers to writing this vowel: in one nomenclature, 131 out of 711 code numbers stood for e.Urban 2004, p. 117  References   Sources  * Kahn, David. \\"The Man in Iron Mask -- Encore et Efin, Cryptologically.\\" Cryptologia, January 2005, Volume XXIX, Number 1. * Singh, Simon.

He initially appears as a villainous diplomat opposite Londo Mollari, being constantly engaged in insidious, if petty and often comical schemes, usually driven by his hostility to his people's historical enemies, the Centauri, whom Londo represents. However, in the course of the series, he is transformed into a Messianic figure and the foremost spiritual leader of his people.  Character history  = Early life = G'Kar was a pouchling during the first Centauri occupation of his homeworld. His family served as servants in a Centauri household. This was during the time when the Narn resistance movement was gaining in strength and their increased aggression was slowly driving the Centauri out of Narn. After G'Kar's mother became very ill, only he and his father remained fit enough to serve in their Centauri master's household. One day his father accidentally spilled a bowl of hot jala upon the mistress of the house. As punishment, his father was beaten to a pulp and was hung up on their family prayer tree. He lasted for three days before he finally died. G'Kar was with him, and his father told him just before he died that he was proud of him, and to do all the things that he could not ‚Äì Fight the Centauri. In rage, G'Kar ran away and killed his first Centauri that very day. He later on joined the resistance movement. After the Centauri were driven off, he worked in the military, participating in at least one invasion during the expansion of the Narn Regime (the Tuchanq). By his own admission later on, during this invasion he participated in atrocities. In addition, G'Kar dealt with the Earth Alliance during the Earth-Minbari War to secretly sell desperately needed weapons that could be effective against the seemingly invincible Minbari. To G'Kar, the fact that this profitable exchange could also falsely implicate the Centauri Republic (since the Narn were selling Centauri weapons that were left behind as the result of the Centauri withdrawal from Narn space) was worth the risk of incurring the wrath of the Minbari themselves. Regardless, G'Kar also assisted in efforts to explore an opportunity for a peace settlement for the war offered by the Head of the Rangers while he himself offered to grant asylum to John Sheridan and a few compatriots. = Career = G'Kar was Narn ambassador to Babylon 5, and member of the third circle of the Kha'Ri, the heart and the ruling body of Narn Regime. During his time as ambassador, he was notorious for his hatred of Londo Mollari, and of the Centauri Republic Mollari represented. His hatred led G'Kar in 2258 to be a party to various underhanded schemes intended to further the goals of his government whether they be sheltering the notorious Dilgar war criminal, Deathwalker, to attempting to incite riots on the station. In mid-2259, the dying Centauri Emperor Turhan visited Babylon 5 so as he could \\"stand with a Narn in neutral territory and apologize\\" for all the evil and suffering the Centauri have inflicted upon the Narn. G'kar was prepared to assassinate the Emperor before he learned of this. After the Emperor's intentions were relayed to him, he sought Mollari and offered him a drink in celebration of a new understanding between their two peoples. By a sad irony, at that point Mollari had already arranged for the Shadows to attack the Narn base on Quadrant 14 to ensure that Refa and his allies could consolidate their power at the eve of the Centauri Emperor's death. After learning of the attack on Quadrant 14 ‚Äúby the Centauri‚Äù, G'Kar attempted to attack Mollari but was stopped by Sheridan. Sheridan gave G'Kar a choice ‚Äì if he attacked Mollari, he might very well end up dead and would be of no use to his people. But if he restrained himself, he would stay alive and be able to help his people greatly (this proved true, as G'Kar became instrumental in the war against the Shadows and the later liberation of Narn). In a feat of tremendous self-restraint, G'Kar stayed his hand. Instead he sat on the ground, weeping. = The Narn-Centauri war = After the second Narn-Centauri war, and the subsequent surrender of the Narn Regime, G'Kar was the only member of the Kha'Ri not captured. Mollari returned to Babylon 5 (after having watched the bombardment of Narn by the Centauri using mass-drivers) to announce to the Babylon 5 Council the defeat of Narn and its being turned into a ‚ÄúProtectorate‚Äù of the Centauri. Mollari proceeded to deliver the terms of the Narn surrender, including the arrest of all members of the Kha'Ri. However, because he had asked for sanctuary, G'Kar had already been placed under the protection both of Babylon 5 and of the Minbari Federation (who co- sponsored the construction of the station) for as long as G'Kar remained ON the station. Nevertheless, Londo had G'Kar removed from the Council as he was no longer the official representative of Narn. Instead of leaping across the room to snap Mollari's neck, G'Kar calmly rose and addressed the council in one of his most memorable lines in the history of the series. = ‚ÄúEnlightenment‚Äù = During the six months or so after the Narn-Centauri war, G'Kar had offered much assistance to the underground resistance back on Narn. In exchange for G'Kar's cooperation for toning down these activities, Sheridan was able to pressure the Centauri into releasing the Narn colonists on Quadrant 14. He maintained control of the Narn aboard Babylon 5 to ensure that the others would be more sympathetic to their plight. He also helped expose a plot to use Babylon 5 as a Centauri munitions drop point. Also, with help from Michael Garibaldi, he was able to establish a safe location for smuggling weapons into Narn and its colonies. G'kar spent the later part of the year 2259 as well as early 2260 being obsessed with avenging his people against the Centauri in general, and Mollari in particular. He maintained the steady flow of smuggled weapons onto Narn. As the last of the Kha'Ri still free, G'Kar inspired those on his homeworld to rise up and resist their would-be invaders. His authority was challenged, at one point, by a fellow Narn, Na'Far, who was appointed by the Centauri as the new official ambassador of the Regime to Babylon 5. However, Na'Far did not only fail, but his personal bodyguard, Ta'Lon (whom Sheridan had saved on a Streib ship), became G'Kar's most avid follower and confidant. A few months later, G'Kar obtained a highly illegal Earth drug known as ‚ÄúDust‚Äù, which gives the user temporary but incredibly powerful telepathic abilities. G'Kar intended to use this weapon to fight the Centauri, but the effects on Narn physiology were unknown; the Narns had no surviving heritage of telepaths. He opted to use himself as a test subject, with great success ‚Äì he was able to abduct and telepathically mutilate Mollari (severely beating both him and his assistant, Vir Cotto, in an amazing display of superior Narn strength), and learn many of his secrets, including his role in instigating the second Narn-Centauri war, as well as the ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù circumstances that led to his assignment on Babylon 5. However, as the drug wore off, he experienced what he believed to be a religious revelation from his ‚Äúfather figures‚Äù, namely the Narn holy figure G'Quan, his own biological father, and the angelic being called G'Lan (all of which were actually Vorlon Ambassador Kosh Naranek, who also used a ‚Äúfather figure‚Äù when he appeared to Sheridan months later). In his vision, G'Kar was told to let go of his hatred and serve a higher cause ‚Äì the survival of his race and of everyone. To achieve this, he, and the Narns, had to become willing to sacrifice themselves. As the G'Quan apparition puts it: G'Kar was arrested for this attack and pleaded guilty. He allowed himself to be placed in Babylon 5's brig, where he dedicated himself to meditating on his revelation, eventually writing down his thoughts and observations. He was released early, due to the fighting between Earth forces and Babylon 5. He promised to assist the humans ‚Äì and delivered, providing Babylon 5 with a Narn security force to replace those soldiers who remained loyal to Earth. = Liberation of Narn = When Michael Garibaldi was kidnapped, G'Kar went searching for him, only to be captured by Centauri forces and taken to Centauri Prime. There he was presented as a gift to Londo Mollari by Emperor Cartagia. However, Cartagia first decided to torture G'Kar. He endured much and was even tortured by Cartagia himself, but G'Kar refused to give him the satisfaction of hearing him cry out in pain. He revealed this to Londo and Vir; Mollari then explained if he would not scream soon G'Kar would most definitely die. This refusal to scream under torture has been shown previously during Season 1 when G'kar was being tortured with paingivers by a Narn assassin. This shows G'Kar's refusal to give his torturers the satisfaction of hearing him scream because that is a sign of both weakness and submission and exemplifies G'Kar's great pride. After hearing this Londo and Vir decided to act fast as they knew they would need G'Kar's help to kill Cartagia. Mollari approached G'Kar in secret and explained that Cartagia was sadistic and insane, and that the fate of both the Narn and Centauri people depended on his removal from the throne. Mollari offered a deal ‚Äì if G'Kar would assist by providing a distraction at the proper moment, Mollari himself would assassinate the mad emperor, and then use his influence to free him. Assuming G'Kar would agree, Mollari turned to leave. G'Kar replied by saying that Mollari didn't ask the price, and that he would only agree to it if Mollari would use his influence to free Narn. Mollari pointed out that G'Kar was in no position to make demands. G'Kar's response was, ‚ÄúNeither are you.‚Äù Soon after this conversation Cartagia held one last torture session with G'Kar that Londo and Vir witnessed. He ordered a soldier to whip him with an energy whip that would kill any Narn with forty strokes and stated that the whipping would not stop until he heard the scream he so much wanted. G'Kar held until the last whip stroke, and only screamed as it was necessary to save his people. Soon after this Londo convinced Cartagia to travel to the Narn homeworld to judge G'Kar there. But before they left Cartagia ordered a guard to gouge one of G'Kar's eyes out, as he didn't like how he looked at him. (Rather significantly, the number of whiplashes G'Kar received was 39 ‚Äì the same number that Pilate ordered Jesus to be given.) When they arrived at Narn they made preparations for the assassination and it succeeded, albeit with Mollari's aide Vir Cotto somewhat inadvertently killing Cartagia. Mollari kept his word and freed both G'Kar and the Narn people. The Narn then offered G'Kar the chance to rule the planet, which he flatly refused in favor of a new Kha'Ri that he insisted must be formed, and citing the fact that he did not endure so much pain and personal suffering to remove one tyrant from his planet, only to become one himself. Shortly after returning to Babylon 5, he is visited by Garibaldi, who was genuinely apologetic for G'Kar having to endure so much torture, simply for wanting to look for him. G'Kar explained that Garibaldi was one of the few non-Narn friends he had, and far from being angry, he was actually quite grateful. In doing so, G'Kar said he was put in precisely the right place at precisely the right time to free his people, something which would never have happened, had Garibaldi not been kidnapped in the first place. = Declaration of Principles = Upon his return to Babylon 5, he resumed his role as Narn Ambassador, and was instrumental in the founding of the Interstellar Alliance. G'Kar was a member of that organization's advisory council, and wrote the Declaration of Principles. A later draft of these principles read as follows: Immediately after this draft was approved by all members of the ISA, G'Kar insisted that it be recalled, as he had written a better version. While ISA President John Sheridan did agree that this version was better, the text of that version is unknown, and no record exists whether this improved version was also approved. = Londo‚Äôs bodyguard and rise to ‚Äúholiness‚Äù = Later, when Mollari returned to Centauri Prime to investigate potential corruption in the Centauri Court, Minbari Ambassador Delenn requested that G'Kar return with Mollari as his bodyguard. G'Kar accepted, if only to see the looks on the faces of the Centauri court. Upon his return to Babylon 5, he discovered that the book of religious observations he had been writing had been ‚Äúliberated‚Äù by a friend (his former bodyguard, Ta'Lon), who believed him dead, and published as \\"Book of G'Kar\\". It was received well, and its popularity was approaching that of the Book of G'Quan. G'Kar had ‚Äì quite unwittingly and unwillingly ‚Äì become a holy figure. G'Kar found his new holy status very frustrating; While many Narn were coming to him for guidance, they were more interested in applying their own interpretation of his words, or focusing on some things he had said while ignoring others ‚Äì even when he himself was insisting otherwise. His sermons, however, were often quite inspired. For example, when asked ‚ÄúWhat is truth, and what is God?‚Äù he explained: His popularity was creating political pressure on the restored Kha'Ri as well, who finally insisted that he either come home to rule or publicly give them his blessing. The last straw was when he was forced to bluntly rebuke a particularly obnoxious would-be worshipper, and the offended admirer attempted to assassinate him in retaliation, but ended up severely wounding Garibaldi's fianc√©e instead. G'Kar decided to leave Babylon 5 and explore the galaxy with Lyta Alexander, knowing that he could do no more for his people there and that to stay would only cause more unrest. He appointed Ta'Lon as his successor. Ta'Lon was quite surprised by the selection, but in a recorded message, G'Kar explained he had become a distraction for his people, and that a position such as G'Kar's required one to be equal parts warrior and priest. G'Kar felt he had become more priest than warrior, and to create a balance, someone who was more warrior than priest was required to succeed him: someone like Ta'Lon. As in depicted in the TV movie, Legend of the Rangers, G'Kar plays a role in reforming the Rangers when he defended Ranger David Martel from dismissal for withdrawing from battle when his ship is severely damaged to the point where it lost all practical fighting ability. Ambassador G'Kar convinces the Rangers' ruling council that they were being unreasonable for seeking to punish a ranger for merely exercising appropriate prudence for the sake of his crew. When Martel and his crew became the heroes of the hour by saving an ambassadorial party, which included G'Kar himself, from The Hand, the Narn's argument was vindicated. G'Kar would later return to Babylon 5 at least once more for a diplomatic conference. = Death = G'Kar died in 2278 while locked in combat with the Drakh Keeper controlling Londo Mollari's body. (Londo was tired of living and requested that G'Kar kill both him and Drakh). The sacrifice of G'Kar and Londo allowed Sheridan, Delenn, and their son David to escape from Centauri Prime. = Aftermath = After the death of G'Kar on Centauri Prime, Emperor Vir Cotto honored G'Kar and Londo's sacrifice by building a gigantic statue of them at the main gates to the Centauri capital city. These statues were built so that the two men were standing guard over the city, and watching each other's backs. The Book of G'Kar continued to gain popularity following his death, and along with G'Quan he became one of the most widely read authors amongst the Narn. Shortly before he died in 2281, John Sheridan had one last meal with his friends. During the toast for all those who had died, Michael Garibaldi eulogized G'Kar.  Actor history  Andreas Katsulas died on February 13, 2006 due to lung cancer. As a result, except for archival footage, the character of G'Kar will not make any future appearances in Babylon 5 related television or movie productions. In the Babylon 5: The Lost Tales anthology, it is explained that both G'Kar and Stephen Franklin, who was played by Richard Biggs, had left to explore space beyond the galactic rim.  Reception and literary analysis  G'Kar has been subject to literary analysis, for example as a leader.

Fielder was a power hitter in the 1980s and 1990s. He attended college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). He played in MLB for the Toronto Blue Jays (1985‚Äì88), in Japan's Central League for the Hanshin Tigers (1989), and then in MLB for the Detroit Tigers (1990‚Äì96), New York Yankees (1996‚Äì97), Anaheim Angels in 1998, and Cleveland Indians in 1998. With the Yankees, he won the 1996 World Series over the Atlanta Braves. In 1990, he became the first player to reach the 50‚Äìhome run mark since George Foster hit 52 for the Cincinnati Reds in 1977 and the first American League player to do so since Roger Maris famously hit 61 in 1961. He is the father of Prince Fielder, who similarly established himself as a premier power hitter during his career. The Fielders are the only father and son to both have 50-home run seasons in MLB. Early career Fielder attended Nogales High School in La Puente, California. He was named an All-American while playing for the school's baseball team in 1981. He enrolled at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), where he played college baseball for the UNLV Rebels baseball team. Fielder was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 31st round of the 1981 amateur draft, but did not sign. He was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the fourth round of the 1982 amateur draft, and this time did sign. In 1983, he was traded by the Royals to the Toronto Blue Jays for Leon Roberts. The Blue Jays promoted Fielder to the major leagues on July 18, 1985. Fielder became a part-time first and third baseman for the Blue Jays, sharing playing time with Willie Upshaw and Fred McGriff. Fielder had hit 31 home runs with 84 runs batted in during four seasons. With Toronto, he earned $125,000 per season. Hanshin Tigers The Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball's Central League signed Fielder after the 1988 season, paying him $1,050,000 ($1,968,644 today), including a chauffeur and a full- time interpreter. More than the money, he said, he went to Japan for the opportunity to play every day. In the beginning of spring training, Fielder had a difficult time adjusting to Japan's baseball culture. However, with the help of Tiger manager Minoru Murayama and Junichi Kashiwabara, he became adjusted to the new environment. The Tigers offered Fielder the position of cleanup hitter, and he became a hero to the local baseball fans, who nicknamed him \\"Wild Bear\\" (wild, in Japan, is the image of power; bear, for his hulking presence). Fielder batted .302 and hit 38 home runs for Hanshin in 1989. Detroit Tigers After the 1989 season, Fielder signed a two-year, $3 million contract with the Detroit Tigers. Fielder hit 51 home runs with 132 RBIs in 1990. On the last day of the Tigers' season at Yankee Stadium, Fielder hit his 50th and 51st home runs to become the 11th player in MLB history ‚Äì and only the second in the previous 25 years ‚Äì to reach the 50-HR plateau. No Detroit Tigers player had turned the mark since Hank Greenberg slugged 58 in 1938, and no Tiger player has reached 50 HR since. Fielder, whose previous high mark was 14 with Toronto in 1987, provided a sudden and unexpected emergence as a legitimate slugger. In addition to his 51 homers, Fielder also led the American League in RBI and total bases (339) that season. In 1990, Fielder also became the fourth American League player to ever have two three- home run games in a season. With his 44 home runs in 1991, Cecil joined Hank Greenberg (1937‚Äì38) as the only Tiger players at that time to hit 40 or more homers in consecutive seasons.Cabrera belts 40th, Scherzer wins No. 18 as Tigers roll cbssports.com wire reports, August 18, 2013. (Miguel Cabrera joined Fielder and Greenberg in 2012‚Äì13.) Fielder repeated as AL RBI champion with 133 driven in that season. In 1992, Fielder avoided salary arbitration by agreeing to a one-year, $4.5million contract, which at the time set a record for highest salary by an arbitration-eligible player. Fielder responded by leading the league in RBI (124) for the third consecutive season, becoming the first American Leaguer since Babe Ruth to do so. During the 1990s, Fielder built a reputation for clutch hitting and power, though the Tigers continued to be no better than mediocre. His team's fates possibly hurt him with MVP voters. Rickey Henderson and Cal Ripken, Jr. narrowly edged him for the AL's MVP Award in 1990 and 1991, respectively. His new fans in Detroit nicknamed him \\"Big Daddy\\" for his big smile, peaceful temperament, and prodigious home runs (as well as his massive physical stature). In his six-year tenure with Detroit, Fielder had four consecutive 30-homer and 100-RBI seasons. During the strike-shortened 1994 season, he had 28 home runs and 90 RBIs in 109 games. He also became the first Tiger to hit at least 25 home runs in six consecutive seasons. No player in Detroit history hit as many over a six-year period (219) until Miguel Cabrera hit 227 in 2008‚Äì13, and no major league player had more home runs between 1990 and 1995. Fielder was a member of the All-Star Team in 1990, 1991, and 1993. Fielder was named \\"Tiger of the Year\\" by the Detroit chapter of the BBWAA in 1990, 1991, and 1992. He is the only player to receive the award three consecutive years. In 1993, Fielder signed a five-year, $36million contract with the Tigers; which made him the highest paid player in baseball for two seasons (1995 and 1996). Fielder had a reputation as something of a slow baserunner. In 1996 he set a major league record by taking 1,096 games to record his first career stolen base, which occurred on a botched hit and run. He stole another base that season as well, and finished his career with two stolen bases over 13 seasons and 1,470 games. Fielder also had a reputation as a below average fielder, mostly caused by his poor speed and range. He was, however, considered a competent defensive first baseman when it came to putouts and digging infield assists out of the dirt. Fielder's massive power was exemplified by two long home runs: *He was one of only four players, and the only Tiger, to homer over the left-field roof at Tiger Stadium (the other three are Harmon Killebrew, Frank Howard and Mark McGwire). He hit the homer off Oakland Athletic Dave Stewart on August 25, 1990. *He also hit the only home run to ever travel completely out of Milwaukee County Stadium‚Äîduring either the Braves' Milwaukee history (1953‚Äì1965) or Brewers' park history (1970‚Äì2000). It was hit off the Brewers' Dan Plesac on September 14, 1991. Later career Fielder was traded to the New York Yankees on July 31, 1996, for Rub√©n Sierra and Matt Drews. Fielder's acquisition was integral in the Yankees' World Series championship that year, as he won the Babe Ruth Award for most outstanding performance in the 1996 postseason. Fielder stayed with the Yankees in 1997, and he played for the Anaheim Angels and Cleveland Indians in 1998. Fielder was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays before the start of the 1999 season. Despite batting .264 in 17 spring training games, going 14-for-53 with two doubles, a team-high three homers and 11 RBI; Toronto traded for Dave Hollins and Cecil was released once spring training wrapped. He subsequently retired. In his career, Cecil Fielder batted .255, with 744 runs, 200 doubles, 319 HRs, 1008 RBI, and a .482 slugging average, drawing 693 walks for a .345 on-base percentage with two career stolen bases. As neither of his stolen bases came in the 1990 season, he held the single season record for most home runs (51) without a single stolen base (later passed by Mark McGwire's 52 HR and 65 HR seasons). He was inducted in the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994. Personal life In October 2004, The Detroit News reported that Fielder was suffering from domestic and gambling problems. They relied on court documents from Fielder's divorce and a lawsuit brought against him by Trump Plaza Hotel and Casinos in New Jersey describing debts to various casinos, credit card companies and banks. Fielder later filed a libel suit against Gannett, the parent company of The Detroit News, and the lead reporter, Fred Girard, accusing them of slander and defamation of character. The suit sought US$25million in damages and fees. The trial court dismissed the suit and the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the decision.Legal Watch: Dismissal of former athlete's libel suit against Detroit News upheld (August 11, 2006) Fielder's son Prince was a first baseman, formerly with the Milwaukee Brewers, then with the Detroit Tigers, and the Texas Rangers. Fielder was originally involved in his son's professional career, even negotiating his first contract. After a dispute as to whether Cecil should receive a typical agent's fee for negotiating the contract, Prince and his family were no longer on speaking terms with Cecil. In a 2012 interview, Cecil Fielder said that he and Prince had recently begun speaking again, and that their relationship was improving. On September 25, 2007, Prince hit his 50th home run of the season, making Cecil and Prince the only father/son duo in Major League history to each reach the milestone. The two each have 319 career home runs, and are tied for 120th on the career MLB home run list. After managing the South Coast League's Charlotte County Redfish in 2007, Fielder became the manager of the Atlantic City Surf of the Canadian- American Association of Professional Baseball in 2008. On March 25, 2011, Fielder was named to the Torrington Titans advisory board.

Construction and commissioning  Greenwich Bay was laid down on 18 July 1944 at Lake Washington Shipyard, Houghton, Washington. She was launched on 17 March 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Francis B. Johnson, wife of the Commander of Fleet Air Wing 6 (FAW-6), and commissioned on 20 May 1945 with Commander Peter F. Boyle in command.  Post-World War II occupation duty 1945‚Äì1946  Greenwich Bay had not yet left the United States West Coast when World War II ended with the cessation of hostilities with Japan on 15 August 1945. Departing San Diego, California, on 26 August 1945, she called at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, Midway Atoll, and Okinawa before arriving at Taku, China, on 5 October 1945. Greenwich Bay spent the rest of 1945 along the China coast, touching at Tsingtao and Shanghai as well as Taku, tending seaplanes of the United States Seventh Fleet. She operated in Japanese waters during January 1946, and after a short stint in the Philippine Islands, departed for the United States on 1 May 1946. Calling at Hong Kong; Singapore; Naples, Italy; Casablanca, French Morocco; and Gibraltar during the voyage, she arrived at Norfolk, Virginia on 1 July 1946. She then moved to New York City for overhaul.  Escort duty for the Presidential Yacht 1947‚Äì1948  Greenwich Bay reported to the Potomac River Naval Command on 19 February 1947 to serve as escort to USS Williamsburg (AGC-369), ex-PG-56, the Presidential yacht. This assignment ended on 21 June 1948.  Around-the-world cruise 1948  Greenwich Bay departed Norfolk on 21 June 1948 for an around-the-world cruise. During The four-month voyage, she made good-will visits to Gibraltar; Port Said, Egypt; Muscat; Bahrain, Kuwait, Trincomalee, Ceylon; Fremantle, Australia; Pago Pago, American Samoa; Papeete, Tahiti; and Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, before returning to Norfolk on 14 October 1948.  Middle East service 1949‚Äì1966  Greenwich Bay departed Norfolk on 30 April 1949 to assume duties as flagship for the Commander of the U.S. Navy Middle East Force. Every year thereafter she repeated this duty, sailing through the Mediterranean to operate as flagship in the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and Indian Ocean for 4 to 6 months. In total Greenwich Bay made fifteen Mediterranean deployments. During most of this period, she performed these duties in rotation with two other Barnegat-class ships, USS and USS . These three ships were dubbed the \\"little white fleet\\", in reference to the white paint jobs they shared to counter the region's extreme heat. USS Greenwich Bay (AVP-41) visits Barcelona, Spain, in May or early June 1961 on her way to that year's deployment as flagship in the Middle East.Ports which Greenwich Bay visited as part of her official duties as flagship included Recife, Brazil; Lisbon, Portugal; and virtually every major Mediterranean, Persian Gulf, Indian Ocean, and Red Sea city as well as several African ones. Among them were Malta; Bombay and Madras, India; Istanbul, Turkey; Athens, Greece; Beirut, Lebanon; Mombassa, Kenya; Cannes, France; and Karachi, Pakistan. In addition to operating with foreign naval units in the Mediterranean, Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and Indian Ocean, Greenwich Bay performed extensive work in the People-to-People program, particularly in carrying drugs and other medical supplies to Arab and African nations, and operated as an important tool of diplomacy in the region. In her Middle East duties, which were punctuated by local operations and exercises out of Norfolk, Greenwich Bay was visited by many dignitaries, including King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, the Shah of Iran, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, and the Shaikh of Kuwait. In 1950 Greenwich Bays crew distinguished itself in Bahrain, as Air France planes crashed there on 13 June 1950 and 15 June 1950 while attempting to make early-morning landings on a fog-shrouded airfield. Greenwich Bay sent out a total of six search-and-rescue missions on those two days. On 15 June 1950 one of her launches, containing both her captain and medical officer, succeeded in rescuing nine survivors of the crash. For her heroic actions, Greenwich Bay received the special commendation and thanks of both the Arabian and French governments. When the Suez Crisis flared up in 1956, Greenwich Bay extended her normal cruise in the Persian Gulf to be able to evacuate American dependents and civilians if necessary. As a result of the blocking of the Suez Canal, she had to return to the United States around the Cape of Good Hope.  Decommissioning and disposal  After completing her fifteenth Middle East deployment, Greenwich Bay was decommissioned in June 1966 and stricken from the Navy List on 1 July 1966. She was sold for scrapping on 21 June 1967 to Boston Metals Company of Baltimore, Maryland.

The officeholder is not required to be a member of the National Assembly. The prime minister serves in a role similar to that of a vice president. Since 2020, Chung Sye- kyun is the current prime minister.  Nomenclature  The Sino-Korean word gungmu (/) means \\"state affairs\\" and chongni (/) means \\"prime minister\\", \\"premier\\" or \\"chancellor\\", so the full title in Korean means literally \\"Prime Minister for State Affairs\\", but it is not used as official English title. The short title in Korean is just Chongni.  History  The position was created on 31 July 1948, two weeks before the government of South Korea was founded, and was held by Lee Beom-seok until 1950. The title was Chief Cabinet Minister from 1961 until 1963. On 27 April 2014, Prime Minister Chung Hong-won announced his desire to resign.\\"S.

A prime minister that has been appointed by the president but not yet confirmed by the National Assembly is informally called as the acting prime minister. The term may also be applied to a prime minister that has resigned but in the interim remains in office in a caretaker role. The prime minister is supported by two deputy prime ministers.

Clause 2 states the impeachment bill must be proposed by one third, and approved by the majority of members of the National Assembly for passage. In the case of the president, the motion must be proposed by a majority and approved by two thirds or more of the total members of the National Assembly, meaning that 200 of 300 members of the parliament must approve the bill.

A total of 147 were built and were used by the Royal Air Force in Malaya during the Malayan Emergency and Kenya until replaced by the de Havilland Hornet in Malaya and the English Electric Canberra jet bomber elsewhere. Design and development The Bristol Type 164 was the outcome of the 1942 Air Ministry specification H.7/42 calling for a faster development of the Beaufighter for long-range torpedo work and anti-shipping strikes.Mondey 1994, p. 69. The Bristol design team under Leslie Frise, used the wings, tail and undercarriage of the Buckingham with a new fuselage of oval cross-section. The pilot, navigator/bomb aimer and radio-operator/gunner were grouped in the forward cockpit. In spite of the official change in its role to a bomber, the first eleven Brigands off the production line were completed as torpedo bombers.Taylor 1969, p. 335. These early aircraft served with RAF Coastal Command from 1946‚Äì1947 before being converted to bombers. Operational history In 1946 the first 11 production torpedo-fighter (TF.1) aircraft were delivered to 36 Squadron and 42 Squadron, RAF Coastal Command, which had no need for coastal strike aircraft at the time so the torpedo-fighters were returned to Filton and converted to light bombers (B.1). The first B.1s were delivered in 1949 to 84 Squadron at RAF Habbaniya to convert from the Beaufighter and 5 Squadron in Aden, a Hawker Tempest unit. The first unit to convert from Beaufighters to the Brigand was 45 Squadron, based at RAF Station Tengah on the Island of Singapore, operating in support of British forces against the Communist Guerrillas, engaged in an insurgency in Malaya. The first Brigand was flown to Tengah from RAF St Athan in November 1949, a 16-day trip. After test flights, the first combat operation was conducted by the Brigand, piloted by Flight Lieutenant Dalton Golding and crewed by radio/radar operator Peter Weston, together with four Beaufighters of No. 45 Squadron against CT targets in the jungle west of Kluang, Malaya on 19 December 1949. The Brigand carried three rockets, one 500 lb (230 kg) and two 1,000 lb (450 kg) bombs. The operation was successful and No. 45 Squadron soon completed its conversion to the Brigand. Brigands of 45 Squadron and soon 84 Squadron were routinely engaged in strikes against Communist Insurgent targets throughout Malaya, direct and in close support of ground forces, as well as providing air cover as needed to convoys on the ground, against possible ambushes. Problems with the Brigand became apparent during operations in Malaya, with undercarriages failing to lower. This was traced to rubber seals in the hydraulic jacks deteriorating in the hot, humid climate.Blythe 1977, p. 228. Just as this problem was being resolved another problem arose, more serious because it led to fatalities; a propensity for aircraft damage and loss during strafing runs employing the four 20 mm cannon. An accumulation of gases in the long cannon blast tubes, which ran under the cockpit, were igniting through use of high-explosive shells. This in turn severed hydraulic lines, which would burn. This was cured by drastically reducing ammunition loads and using only ball rounds.Blythe 1977, pp. 233, 235. The Brigand also had a tendency to shed a propeller blade, leading to complete propeller failure; this in turn would lead to the engine being wrenched off the wing and an inevitable crash. This was found to be caused by corrosion in the propeller locking rings. More frequent maintenance helped alleviate this problem.Blythe 1977, p. 236. When everything was working properly the Brigand was considered by its pilots to be a good aircraft: As the Brigand became subject to more restrictions both unit commanders had serious doubts about the continued use of the aircraft. It was decided to continue operating them, since as long as thorough maintenance was carried out it was felt that nothing else could go wrong. Another design flaw arose in the leather bellows used to deploy the air brakes during dives. In the tropical climate, the leather would rot, causing the brakes to fail. This led to Brigands losing wings in dives due to excessive airspeed or rotation as only one brake deployed. When this problem was discovered the air brakes of all Brigands were wired shut, decreasing the aircraft's dive bombing capabilities. No. 45 Squadron converted to de Havilland Hornets in January 1952 while 84 Squadron was disbanded in February 1953. Soon after this, the Brigands were grounded and withdrawn from service. Brigands were also used operationally over Aden by 8 Squadron from 1950 to 1952, when it was found that the Brigand mainspars were suspect; the Brigands were replaced by de Havilland Vampires.Mulvagh 1995, pp. 16‚Äì19. In 1950 nine Brigand T.4 radar trainers were delivered to 228 OCU at RAF Leeming to train radar navigators on the use of Airborne Interception radar. A further variant with a different radar installation was Brigand T.5 which were converted from B.1s and later all the T.4s were also modified to T.5 standard. The last operator was 238 OCU at RAF North Luffenham which disbanded in March 1958. Variants The first to be built was the Brigand I or Brigand TF 1 and these entered service with RAF Coastal Command No. 36 Squadron and No. 42 Squadron. They were subsequently rebuilt to become the Brigand B 1, notable as both the first purpose-built multi-role bomber for the RAF and its last piston-engined bomber. It could carry either a 22 in (560 mm) torpedo under the fuselage with two 500 lb (230 kg) bombs beneath the wings, one 2,000 lb (910 kg) or two 1,000 lb (450 kg) bombs beneath the fuselage and had underwing racks for 16 RP-3 60 lb (30 kg) rocket projectiles. ;Type 164 Brigand :Four prototypes originally with Centarus VII engines. ;Brigand TF.1 :Production torpedo-bomber variant, 11 built later converted to B.I. ;Brigand B.1 :Bomber variant, rear gun removed and external bomb racks and rails for rockets added, 106 built and 11 conversions from TF.1 Brigand MET.3 of 1301 Flight RAF at RAF Luqa, Malta, in June 1949 ;Type 165 Brigand II :Proposed training variant with dual controls, not built, as the Buckmaster, a dual-control conversion of the Bristol Buckingham was used for Brigand training instead. ;Brigand MET.3 :Unarmed meteorological reconnaissance variant, 16 built. ;Brigand T.4 :Trainer variant, used to train airborne interception (AI) radar operators, nine built, survivors to T.5 standard. ;Brigand T.5 :Improved training version, which like the T.4 before it, was used to train airborne interception (AI) radar operators, conversions from B.1 and T.4.

History = Origins and first phase (1989‚Äì1995) = Echolyn was formed in 1989 when guitarist Brett Kull and drummer Paul Ramsey, members of a recently split cover band called Narcissus, joined with keyboardist Chris Buzby to form a new band to focus on original songs. They were soon joined by fellow Narcissus veteran Ray Weston on vocals and bassist Jesse Reyes, and quickly began playing live and recording their eponymous debut album, which was released in 1991. During the recording of that album, Reyes was replaced on bass by Tom Hyatt. With this lineup, Echolyn recorded a second album, Suffocating the Bloom, and a four-song EP, ...and every blossom, and with these releases attracted the attention of Sony Music. In 1994, Echolyn was signed to a multi-album deal on Sony's Epic Records label with their major- label debut, As the World, released in March 1995. However, the label did not provide support for the band to tour in promotion of the album, therefore the band was forced to promote As the World on their own. Later in 1995, Sony dropped Echolyn from the label due to poor sales of As the World. Disillusioned, the band split up, releasing a posthumous album of demos and live tracks in 1996 called When the Sweet Turns Sour (featuring a cover of the early Genesis track \\"Where the Sour Turns To Sweet\\", which Sony refused to allow to be included on a Magna Carta Genesis tribute CD entitled \\"Supper's Ready\\"). =Interim (1996‚Äì2000)= Ray Weston, Brett Kull and Paul Ramsey formed a new, semi-progressive rock band called Still and released a disc called \\"Always Almost\\" in early 1996, on Geoff Logsdon's Pleasant Green label. Later that year the band changed its name to Always Almost, releasing a much more progressive-oriented album entitled God Pounds His Nails, also on Pleasant Green. Ray Weston joined progressive rock band The Dark Aether Project in 1998. Over the next two years he toured with the group and appeared on the 1999 album ‚ÄúFeed the Silence.‚Äù Chris Buzby formed a jazz-influenced progressive rock band called Finneus Gauge with guitarist Scott McGill, bass player Chris Eike, vocalist Laura Martin and drummer Jonn Buzby. They released two albums, More Once More (1996) and One Inch of the Fall (1998). It was during this time that Echolyn were asked by Magna Carta Records to contribute to a Jethro Tull tribute album. Weston, Kull, and Ramsey (who owned the Echolyn trademark name) chose \\"One Brown Mouse,\\" recorded the song, and the CD To Cry You a Song: A Collection of Tull Tales was released July 2, 1996. The CD contained Tull covers by prog giants Keith Emerson (with Mick Abrahams, Clive Bunker, and Glenn Cornick), Magellan, and John Wetton, among others. =Second phase (2000‚Äì2017)= Echolyn formally reformed ‚Äì without Tom Hyatt ‚Äì in the spring of 2000. Ray Weston took over bass duties and new member Jordan Perlson (a Berklee College of Music graduate and former student of Buzby) supplemented Ramsey on drums and percussion. This lineup produced the 2000 album Cowboy Poems Free, a loose concept album centering on Americana, and the 2002 album mei, which contains only a single, 50-minute-long track. After playing as a guest with the band in 2002 and early 2003, Tom Hyatt officially rejoined Echolyn later that year in time for their first appearance at the North East Art Rock Festival. The first album from the fully reformed lineup was The End Is Beautiful, released in September 2005. Subsequently, the band embarked on their first European tour. They also contributed a new track called \\"15 Days\\" to the benefit album \\"After the Storm\\" (NEARfest Records), in support of the survivors of the Hurricane Katrina disaster. The band was later featured at the inaugural Festival des Musiques Progressives de Montr√©al in Quebec, Canada in September 2006. 2008 saw the release of a newly remastered Cowboy Poems Free as well as solo work from Brett Kull and a second performance at NEARfest (see photo gallery). Echolyn continued to tour sporadically through 2009. On June 19, 2012, echolyn released a new album. It was untitled but referred to informally by the band as '2012' or 'Window' and sold as both a double CD and as a limited edition two-disc vinyl release (500 copies). Subsequently, the band released seven additional tracks through Bandcamp, including a live track, a remix of \\"15 Days\\", outtakes from the album such as \\"Accumulated Blur\\", \\"Moments with No Sound\\", and other songs written in the same period as the album but not completed in time, including \\"Crows Fly By\\" and \\"Another Stone\\". On July 1, 2015, echolyn opened up a two- week pre-sales window for their eighth studio album, to be entitled \\"I Heard You Listening.\\" The album will be available on both CD and 180-gram vinyl with a public release date of July 31, 2015. Initial reviews of the album have been extremely positive. The album was given its debut on the ProgScape Radio Internet radio program on Wednesday, July 15. =Third phase (2018‚Äìpresent)= In early 2018, Chris Buzby, Brett Kull and Ray Weston began writing sessions for a new echolyn album. These sessions continued over the next two years with updates posted to the band's official Facebook page from time to time. The short videos feature the band playing parts of some of the new songs they are working on. The band have several songs written and a handful of others in progress. As of early 2020, tracking had begun on many of the new songs. Musical style The members of Echolyn have cited Genesis, Wilco, Gentle Giant, Yes, Steely Dan, Jethro Tull, Igor Stravinsky, Electric Light Orchestra, and The Beatles as influences. While the band's style has varied over the years, those influences have been consistently reflected in their music. Intricate guitar leads, unorthodox harmonic structures influenced by modern classical music, and complex contrapuntal vocal passages have remained significant aspects of the musical sound of Echolyn. The albums they recorded before their 1996 breakup sounded more like \\"classic\\" progressive rock, with layered keyboards and extended arrangements. Following their reformation, they have streamlined their style significantly, emphasizing strong, tightly constructed songwriting and more prominent rhythmic grooves, while maintaining much of the subtle sophistication that has caused their music to be labeled \\"progressive.\\" Their self-titled 2012 double album features extended arrangements, rhythmic complexity and integration of the symphonic, \\"retro\\" progressive rock sound heard in their earlier works, while also referencing American styles such as country and blues.

He was the General Secretary (Vice Commander) of the Shinsengumi, a special police force in Kyoto during the late Edo period. Background Though the details of his origin are unclear, he was thought to be the son of a kenjutsu instructor originated from the Sendai domain. Yamanami was trained under Chiba Shusaku Narimasa, the founder of the Hokushin Itto-ryu, and attained Menkyo Kaiden (license of total transmission) sometime before 1860. In 1860 after Yamanami was defeated by Kond≈ç Isami in a match, he was enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ry≈´'s Shieikan dojo in Edo (which was run by Kond≈ç from 1861.) Yamanami was particularly educated in literary and military arts, with a gentle personality and a kind heart. He was very much admired by the Head Instructor (Jukutou) at the Shieikan, Okita S≈çjir≈ç (the later Okita S≈çji), who called him a big brother. In 1863, Yamanami Kondo and other members of the Shieikan joined the R≈çshigumi, the military unit being sent to Kyoto by the Tokugawa Shogunate. Shinsengumi Period In Kyoto, Kond≈ç and his \\"faction\\" remained in Kyoto while the rest of the R≈çshigumi returned to Edo. Soon, the Mibu R≈çshigumi (which would eventually become known as the Shinsengumi) was formed. Yamanami served as a vice-commander, alongside Hijikata Toshiz≈ç after Niimi Nishiki was demoted for instigating a vicious street brawl with sumo wrestlers in Kyoto. Yamanami was said to be one of the Shieikan members involved in the Serizawa Kamo assassination in 1863. After the purge of the Serizawa faction, Yamanami became one of two vice-commanders (the other being Hijikata). Yamanami did not took part in the famed Ikedaya incident in 1864, instead he guarded the group's headquarters. Death Some time after the Zenzaiya incident he tried to escape the Shinsengumi, despite the regulation against deserters. As a result, he committed seppuku with Okita as his Kaishakunin on March 20 (lunar calendar February 23), 1865. There are several speculations on Yamanami's reason to escape, including a theory that Yamanami committed suicide without ever leaving the Shinsengumi. Another theory is Yamanami lost hope about Shogunate's future and was delusional about Tokugawa Yoshinobu political decisions, but when forced to choose between his friends and Justice, he decided to commit an honorable suicide and escape scandal. In Shinsengumi : the Shogun's Last Samurai Corps by Romulus Hillsborough there is something mentioned about Yamanami's escape. The following is quoted from this book: The trouble with Yamanami seems to have originated over a disagreement in philosophy, though Shimosawa also cites a bitter rivalry with the other vice commander, Hijikata Toshizo. Yamanami was apparently vexed over the lately inflated self-importance of Kondo and Hijikata. He felt that they had forgotten the original purpose for which the members of the Shieikan had enlisted in the \\"loyal and patriotic\\" corps. The unyielding will to power that had lately consumed his erstwhile friends had diminished their former patriotic ideals. According to most sources, Yamanami's vexation was exacerbated sometime early in 1865, when Kondo and Hijikata, unhappy with their cramped headquarters at Mibu, decided to move to a more spacious location at Nishihonganji Temple in the southwest of the city. The temple priests were perplexed over the decision. Their attempts to rebuff the Shinsengumi were ignored by Kondo and Hijikata. Yamanami objected to what he considered coercion of Buddhist priests. \\"Certainly there are many other suitable places, \\" he admonished Kondo, and suggested that his commander reconsider. But his commander would not reconsider, and Yamanami resolved to pay the ultimate price. He composed a farewell letter explaining the reasons he could no longer, in good conscience, risk his life under Kondo's command. Then he defected. In short, this is the most accepted theory in regard of Yamanami's reason to leave the Shinsengumi, even though officially it is still a mystery. In addition, Hillsborough's source in regard of the rivalry between Yamanami and Hijikata, Shimosawa Kan's Shinsengumi Shimatsuki, is in fact categorized as historical fiction. Yamanami fled to Otsu while Kondo sent Okita to retrieve him. After Yamanami returned to Mibu, he was ordered to commit seppuku. He asked Okita to serve as his Kaishakunin. There is also a theory that Kondo asked Okita to serve as Yamanami's Kaishakunin out of respect for Yamanami. (The Kaishakunin was usually a closest friend or family member whenever possible.) Yamanami saw Okita as family and the two shared a strong bond till the very end of Yamanami's life. Yamanami was buried at the in Kyoto. Before his death, Yamanami was the second-in-command of the Shinsengumi. (It is a misconception that Hijikata had always been the second- in-command. In fact, Hijikata became the second-in-command after Yamanami's death.) References *Shinsengumi Master's Bible. Shin Jinbutsu Oraisha, 2003. *Shinsengumi Encyclopedia.

Overtaken by events, it was built in small numbers, and was used primarily for transport and liaison duties. Design and development In early 1939 Bristol suggested a bomber variant of the Beaufighter with their Hercules engines. British policy at the time was an expectation for medium bombers to be provided from the US allowing British industry to concentrate on heavy bomber designs but a design was requested preferably based on an existing design which meant working with the Beaufighter or Beaufort. Bristol worked on their design first as the Bristol Type 161 then the Type 162 Beaumont.Buttler 2004, p. 88. Air Ministry specification B.7/40 called for a medium bomber to replace the Blenheim. The specification stipulated a speed of at least 300 mph at 5,000 ft, a normal load of 1,000 lb of bombs and a centre turret armed with at least two 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) machine guns. Only one manufacturer (Armstrong Whitworth) tendered a full design but it did not meet with approval.Buttler 2004, p. 87. So when Bristol brought their Type 162 (\\"tentatively named Beaumont\\"), which was well matched to B.7/40, to the Air Staff, this led to a request to complete a mockup in 1940 and then a confirmed contract for three prototypes in February 1941. The Beaumont was based on the rear fuselage and tail of a Beaufighter, with a new centre and front fuselage. The armament was a mid-upper turret with four machine guns, four more machine guns firing forward and two firing to the rear. Construction began in late 1940, with a new Air Ministry Specification B.2/41 to be written around it. Changes in the requirements, removing dive bombing and \\"direct army support\\" which incoming US bombers were expected to be capable of and increasing the performance to allow for the future, meant the Beaumont would no longer suffice. The changes in performance (requiring a bomb load of 4,000 lb, a speed of 360 mph and a range of 1,600 miles) meant a redesign by Bristol to use the Bristol Centaurus engine. The Bristol redesign with a larger wing and the more powerful engines was the Type 163 Buckingham. It had gun installations in the nose, dorsal and ventral turrets. Generally conventional in appearance, one unusual feature was that the bomb- aimer/navigator was housed in a mid-fuselage ventral gondola, resembling those on the earlier German Heinkel He 111H and American Boeing B-17C and -D in appearance.Winchester 2005, p. 95. This was part of an attempt to give all the crew positions unobstructed views and access to each other's positions. The bomb bay could hold a 4,000 lb, two 2,000 lb, four 1,000 lb or six 500-lb bombs.Flight 13 December 1945, p. 625. The rear of the gondola had a hydraulically powered turret with two 0.303 Browning machine guns. The Bristol-designed dorsal turret carried four Brownings. A further four fixed, forward-firing Brownings were controlled by the pilot. Following more changes, specification B.2/41 was replaced by B.P/41. An order for 400, at an initial rate of 25 per month, was made with deliveries expected in March 1943 but Bristol were still concerned that this not a reasonable scale and would prove expensive, and as such complained to MAP about poor planning. The first flight took place on 4 February 1943.Mondey 1994, p. 68. During testing, the Buckingham exhibited poor stability which led to the enlargement of the twin fins, along with other modifications. Operational history A Buckingham B1 in 1945 By the time the design entered production, requirements had changed, with attacks against German industry being covered by the US by day and by RAF Bomber Command de Havilland Mosquitos by night. The Buckingham was not considered suitable for unescorted daytime use over Europe and in January 1944, it was decided that all Buckinghams would be sent overseas to replace Vickers Wellingtons.Buttler Air International March 1997, p. 185. Once the Buckingham's handling problems were revealed, it was realised that the type was of little use. As a result, it was cancelled in August 1944.Buttler Air International March 1997, pp. 185‚Äì186. To keep the Bristol workforce together, for later production of the Brigand and the Hawker Tempest, a batch of 119 were built. Uses for the aircraft were sought and a conversion to a communications aircraft was devised. After the first 54 had been built as bombers, the remainder were converted for high-speed courier duties with RAF Transport Command. The gun installations were removed and four seats and windows fitted in the fuselage. The aircraft was named Buckingham C.1. Despite its 300 mph (480 km/h) speed and superior range to the Mosquito transports, with room for only four passengers, the Buckingham was rarely put to use. A total of 65 Buckingham bombers were unfinished on the production line and ended up being rebuilt as the Buckmaster, a trainer for the similar Brigand.Winchester 2005, p. 94.Mondey 1994, p. 70. Considered the \\"highest performance trainer in the RAF,\\" the Buckmaster continued to serve as a trainer until its eventual retirement in the mid-1950s.

The lathing may be partial; the amount of rotation is not necessarily a full 360 degrees. The point set providing the initial source data can be thought of as a cross section through the object along a plane containing its axis of radial symmetry. The lathe is so named because it produces the same type of object that a real lathe would produce: an object that is symmetrical about an axis of rotation. However, unlike objects produced by a real lathe, the object can have an axis of rotation through a hole (e.g. a torus). Lathes are very similar to surfaces of revolution. However, lathes are constructed by rotating a curve defined by a set of points instead of a function. Note that this means that lathes can be constructed by rotating closed curves or curves that double back on themselves (such as the aforementioned torus), whereas a surface of revolution could not because such curves cannot be described by functions.

The Underwater Demolition Teams (UDT) were a special-purpose force established by the United States Navy during World War II. They came to be considered more elite and tactical during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. Their primary WWII function began with the reconnaissance and removal of natural or man-made obstacles on beaches prior to amphibious landings. They later were assigned to assist in the recovery of space capsules and astronauts after splash down in the Mercury and Apollo space flight programs. The United States Navy's Underwater Demolition Teams were pioneers in underwater demolition, closed-circuit diving, combat swimming, and midget submarine (dry and wet submersible) operations. Commando training was added making them the forerunner to the United States Navy SEAL program that exists today. In 1983, after additional SEAL training, the UDTs were re-designated as SEAL Teams or Swimmer Delivery Vehicle Teams (SDVTs). SDVTs have since been re-designated SEAL Delivery Vehicle Teams.  Early history  The United States Navy studied the problems encountered by the disastrous Allied amphibious landings during the Gallipoli Campaign of World War I. This contributed to the development and experimentation of new landing techniques in the mid-1930s. In August 1941, landing trials were performed and one hazardous operation led to Army Second Lieutenant Lloyd E. Peddicord being assigned the task of analyzing the need for a human intelligence (HUMINT) capability. When the U.S. entered World War II, the Navy realized that in order to strike at the Axis powers the U.S. forces would need to perform a large number of amphibious attacks. The Navy decided that men would have to go in to reconnoiter the landing beaches, locate obstacles and defenses, as well as guide the landing forces ashore. In August 1942, Peddicord set up a recon school for his new unit, Navy Scouts and Raiders, at the amphibious training base at Little Creek, Virginia. In 1942, the Army and Navy jointly established the Amphibious Scout and Raider School at Fort Pierce, Florida. Here Lieutenant Commander Phil H. Bucklew, the \\"Father of Naval Special Warfare\\", helped organize and train what became the Navy's 'first group' to specialize in amphibious raids and tactics. Pressure to further implement human intelligence gathering prior to landings heightened after Naval amphibious landing craft were damaged by coral reefs during the Battle of Tarawa in November 1943. Aerial reconnaissance incorrectly showed the reefs were submerged deep enough to allow the landing craft to float over. Sailors and Marines were forced to abandon their craft in chest deep water a thousand yards from shore, helping Japanese gunners inflict heavy U.S. casualties. After that experience, Rear admiral Kelley Turner, Commander of the V Amphibious Corps (VAC), directed that 30 officers and 150 enlisted men be moved to Waimanalo ATB (on the island of Oahu) to form the nucleus of a reconnaissance and demolition training program. It is here that the UDTs of the Pacific were born. Later in war, the Army Engineers passed down demolition jobs to the U.S. Navy. It then became the Navy's responsibility to clear any obstacles and defenses in the near shore area. A memorial to the founding of the UDT has been built at Bellows Air Force Station near the original Amphibious Training Base (ATB) Waimanalo. Naval Combat Demolition Units U.S. Naval Combat Demolition insignia. ‚Äì U.S. Navy Seal Museum In early 1942 it became apparent that the Navy needed that capability to destroy submerged obstacles, natural or man-made, for amphibious landings. In late 1942, a group of Navy salvage personnel received a one-week concentrated course on demolitions, explosive cable cutting and commando raiding techniques. The Navy Scouts and Raiders unit was first employed in Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa in November 1942. During Torch, this unit cut the cable and net barrier across a river in North Africa, allowing Rangers to land upstream and capture an airfield. In early May 1943, a two-phase \\"Naval Demolition Project\\" was ordered by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) \\"to meet a present and urgent requirement\\". The first phase began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) Solomons, Maryland with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six Officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from NTC Camp Peary dynamiting and demolition school for a four-week course. Those Seabees were immediately sent to participate in the invasion of Sicily where they were divided in three groups that landed on the beaches near Licata, Gela and Scoglitti.pp. 30-31 Dockery & Brutsman Later in 1943 the Navy decided to create a component dedicated to the removal of amphibious obstructions. It was to be known as a Naval Combat Demolition Unit (NCDU) consisting of one junior Civil Engineer Corps (CEC) officer and five enlisted. A NCDU was to clear beach obstacles for an invasion force with the team coming ashore in an LCRS inflatable boat.p.34 Dockery, Kevin & Brutsman, Bud Navy SEALs A History of the Early Years Berkley Publishing 2001 On 7 May, Admiral Ernest J. King, the CNO, picked Lieutenant Commander Draper L. Kauffman USNR to lead the training. The first six classes graduated from \\"Area E\\" at NTC Camp Peary between May and mid-July. From Camp Peary the NCDU training was moved to Fort Pierce with the first class beginning there mid-July. Despite the move, Camp Peary was Kauffman's primary source of manpower. \\"He would go up to Camp Peary's Dynamite School and assemble the Seabees in the auditorium saying: \\"I need volunteers for hazardous, prolonged and distant duty.\\" Kauffman's other volunteers came from the U.S. Marines, and U.S. Army combat engineers. Training commenced with one grueling week designed to \\"separate the men from the boys\\". Some said that \\"the men had sense enough to quit, leaving Kauffman with the boys.\\" It was and is still considered the first \\"Hell Week.\\" = Normandy = At the beginning of November 1943, six men from Kauffman's Naval Combat Demolition Unit Eleven (NCDU-11) were sent to England to start preparations for Operation Overlord. All told, the NCDUs had 34 teams in England for the invasion of Normandy. While waiting for D-day the NCDUs trained with the 146th, 277th and 299th Combat Engineer Battalions. Each NCDU had 5 men from a Combat Engineer Battalion attached to the team. In the beginning the first 10 NCDUs were split into 3 groups. Initially it was somewhat ad hoc as they had no Commanding Officer, but the Senior officer was the leader of group III, Lieutenant Smith (CEC). He served in that capacity unofficially for the entire group. His group III performed numerous experimental demolitions work and developed the Hagensen Pack.(an innovation that used of tetryl placed into rubber tubes that could be twisted around obstacles) As more teams arrived a NCDU Command was created for the invasion. The NCDUs at Normandy were numbers: 11, 22‚Äì30, 41‚Äì46, 127‚Äì8, 130-42REPORT ON NAVAL COMBAT DEMOLITION UNITS in OPERATION \\"NEPTUNE\\" as part of TASK FORCE 122, Submitted by: Lt.(jg) H. L. Blackwell, Jr. D-V(G) , USNR, 5 July, 1944 \\"NCDU 45\\"; Ensign Karnowski, Chief Carpenters Mate Conrad C. Millis, MM2 Equipment Operator Lester Meyers and three sailors. The unit received a Presidential Unit Citation with Ens. Karnowski earning the Navy Cross & French Croix de Guerre with Palm, while MM2 Meyers received a Silver Star. The Germans had constructed intricate defenses on the French line. These included steel posts driven into the sand and topped with explosives. Large 3-ton steel barricades called Belgian Gates were placed well into the surf zone. Reinforced mortar and machine gun nests were dotted along the beaches. The Scouts and Raiders spent weeks gathering information during nightly surveillance missions up and down the French coast. Replicas of the Belgian Gates were constructed on the south coast of England for the NCDUs to practice demolitions on. It was possible to blow a gate to pieces, but that only created a mass of tangled debris spread along the beaches, thereby creating more of an obstacle. The NCDU found that the best method was to sever the key corner joints in a gate, so that it fell down flat. According to the Allied attack plans, infantry supported by naval gunfire would make the initial landings, followed by tanks and troop carriers to clear any remaining German bunkers and snipers. The NCDU teams (designated Demolitions Gap-Assault teams) would come in with the second wave and work at low tide to clear the obstacles. Their mission was to open sixteen wide corridors for the landing at each of the U.S. landing zones (Omaha Beach and Utah Beach). Unfortunately, the plans could not be executed as laid out. The preparatory air and naval bombardment was ineffective, leaving many German guns in position to fire on the attackers. Also, tidal conditions caused many of the NCDU teams to land prematurely ‚Äì in some cases ahead of the first wave. Despite heavy German fire and resulting casualties, the NCDU men planted charges and demolished many obstacles. As the infantry came ashore, some soldiers took cover on the seaward sides of obstacles that had demolition charges on them. They quickly moved onto the beach. The greatest difficulty was on Omaha Beach. By nightfall only thirteen of the planned sixteen gaps were open, and of the 175 NCDU men who went ashore there, 31 were killed and 60 were wounded. The attack on Utah Beach was much more successful. There, only four were killed and eleven wounded, when an artillery shell hit a team working to clear the beach. Overall, NCDUs had 53 percent casualties. NCDUs also participated in Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France. With Europe invaded Admiral Turner requisitioned all available NCDUs from Fort Pierce for integration into the UDTs for the Pacific. However, the first NCDUs, 1-10, had been staged at Turner City, Florida Island in the Solomon Islands during January 1944. A few were temporarily attached to UDTs. Later NCDUs 1-10 were combined to form Underwater Demolition Team Able. This team was disbanded with NCDUs 2 and 3, plus three others assigned to MacArthur's 7th Amphibious force, and were the only NCDUs remaining at war's end. The other men from Team Able were assigned to numbered UDTs.  Underwater Demolition Teams  The first units that were designated as Underwater Demolition Teams were formed in the Pacific Theater. Rear Admiral Turner, the Navy's top amphibious expert, ordered the formation of nine Underwater Demolition Teams. The personnel for these teams were mostly Seabees that had started out in the UCDUs. UDT training was at WaimƒÅnalo, Hawaii, under V Amphibious Corps operational and administrative control. Most of the instructors and trainees were graduates of the Fort Pierce NCDU or Scouts and Raiders schools, Seabees, Marines, and Army soldiers. Under the direction of Marine Corps Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion, UDTs 1 and 2 were hastily trained for their Kwajalein mission in January 1944. The training made use of inflatable boats and included some swimming. The teams were expected to paddle in, and work in shallow water, leaving the deep-water demolitions to the Army. Marine Reconnaissance units would conduct the hydrography from shallow water to inland while the accompanying UDT would conduct the demolition and hydrography from near-deep water to the shallows. At that time the men in the teams wore fatigues, boots and helmets. They were lifelined to their boats and stayed out of the water as much as possible. The UDTs were organized with approximately sixteen officers and eighty men each. One Marine and one Army officer were liaisons within each team.Commander, V Amphibious Corps to CinCPac, report, Underwater Demolition Teams, Recommendations Concerning-Based on Experience in Flintlock (Kwajalein), 2 June 1944, declassified from secret. They were deployed in every major amphibious landing after Tarawa with 34 teams eventually being commissioned. The last teams created for the invasion of Japan were spared deployment by the atomic bombing of Japan. When it was over, teams 1-21 were the teams that had deployed operationally, meaning that slightly over half of the operational UDTs came from the Seabees. Prior to Operation Galvanic and Tarawa, V Amphibious Corps had identified coral as an issue for future amphibious operations. Rear Admiral Turner, Commander, V Amphibious Corps, had ordered a review to address the problem. VAC found that the only people having any applicable experience with the material were men in the Naval Construction Battalions. The Admiral tasked Lt. Thomas C. Crist (CEC) to develop a method for blasting coral under combat conditions and putting together a team for that purpose.The Water Is Never Cold, James Douglas O'Dell, 2000, p. 132, Brassey's, 22841 Quicksilver Drive, Dulles, Va. 20166, LT Crist started by contacting others he had blasted coral with in CB 5 and by the end November 1943 he had assembled close to 30 officers and 150 enlisted men, at Waipio Amphibious Operating Base on Maui. =Tarawa= The invasion of Tarawa in November 1943 nearly met disaster due to unseen obstructions in the water. Tarawa lies in eastern Micronesia and had an unusual neap tide leaving insufficient clearance for the Higgins boats (LCVPs) to get over the reef. The Amtracs carrying the first wave crossed the reef successfully. But the LCVPs carrying the second wave ran aground on the reef. The Marines had to wade several hundred yards to shore while wearing full packs, under heavy fire across treacherously uneven coral. Many drowned or were killed before making the beach. The first wave, fighting without reinforcements from the second wave, took heavy losses on the beach. =Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, Saipan, Tinian, Guam= Seabees in both UDT 3 & UDT 4 made these welcome signs for the U.S. Marine Corps on Guam. The next operation was to be Kwajalein and the plan calling for night reconnaissance. However, Rear Admiral Turner did not want a repeat of Tarawa. He wanted to know about coral and any obstacles the Japanese may have emplaced. To find this out the men that Lt Crist had staged were used to form UDT 1 and UDT 2. The team commanders were Cmdr. E.D. Brewster (CEC) UDT 1 and Lt. Crist UDT 2 (Lt. Crist was replaced and made Ops officer because Admiral Conolly wanted a commander with combat experience). UDT 1 was ordered to perform two daylight recons. The missions were to follow the standard Fort Pierce procedure with each two-man team getting close to the beach in a rubber boat, wearing combat fatigues, boots, helmets, and life jackets, and make their observations. Team 1 found that the reef kept them from acertaining conditions both in the water and on the beach. In keeping with the Seabee traditions of: (1) doing whatever it takes to accomplish the job and (2) not always following military rules to get it done, UDT 1 did both. Ensign Lewis F. Luehrs and Seabee Chief Bill Acheson had anticipated that they would not be able to carry out the assignment following Fort Pierce protocol and had worn swim trunks beneath their fatigues. Stripping down, they swam 45 minutes undetected across the reef returning with sketches of gun emplacements and other intelligence. Still in their trunks, they were taken directly to Rear Admiral Turner's flagship to report. Afterwards, Rear Admiral Turner concluded that the only way to get this kind of information was to do what these men had done as individual swimmers, which is what he relayed to Admiral Nimitz. The planning and decisions of Rear Admiral Turner, Ensign Luehrs and Chief Acheson made Kwajalein a developmental day in UDT history, changing both the mission model and training regimen. Seabees made up the majority of the men in teams 1‚Äì9, 13 and 15. The Officers of those teams were primarily CEC (Seabees). UDT 2 was sent to Roi-Namur where Lt. Crist would earn a Silver Star. UDTs 1 and 2 were decommissioned upon return to Hawaii with the men transferred to UDTs 3, 4, 5, and 6. Admiral Turner ordered the formation of nine teams, three for III Amphibious Corps and six for V Amphibious Corps(in all teams 3-11). As more NCDUs arrived in the Pacific they were used to form even more teams. UDT 15 was an all NCDU team. It became obvious more men were needed than the NCDUs would supply and Cmdr. Kauffman was no longer recruiting Seabees, so Admiral Nimitz put out a call to the Pacific Fleet for volunteers. They would form three teams, UDT 14 would be the first of them. Recruiting was such an issue that three Lt Cmdrs where transferred from USN Beach Battalions to command UDTs 11, 12, 13 that had no background in demolition. After Kwajalein, the UDTs created the Naval Combat Demolition Training and Experimental Base at Kihei, expanding upon what had been learned from UDT 1. Operations began in February 1944 with Lt Crist the head of training. Most of the procedures from Fort Pierce were changed replaced with an emphasis on developing swimmers, daylight reconnaissance, and no lifelines. The uniform of the day changed to diving masks, swim trunks, and a Ka-bar, creating the UDT image as \\"Naked Warriors\\"(swim-fins were added after UDT 10 introduced them). Lt. Crist was head of training a very short time before he was made commander of UDT 3. In April, Lt. Cmdr. Kauffman was transferred from Fort Pierce to command UDT 5 and serve as senior staff officer, Underwater Demolition Teams, Amphibious Forces, as well as be the Underwater Demolition Training Officer, Amphibious Training Command. At Saipan and Tinian UDTs 5, 6, & 7 were given the call. The missions were daylight for Saipan and night for Tinian. At Saipan UDT 7 developed a method to recover swimmers on the move without making the recovery vessel a stationary target. For Guam UDTs 3, 4, & 6 were assigned the mission. When it was over the Seabee dominated teams had made naval history. For the Marianas operations Admiral Turner recommended over sixty Silver Stars and over three hundred Bronze Stars with Vs for UDTs 3-7\\"America's First Frogman\\", Elizabeth K. Bush, Naval Institute Press, 291 Wood Road, Annapolis, Maryland, 2012, Chapt. 7, That was unprecedented in U.S. Naval/Marine Corps history. For UDTs 5 and 7 every officer received a silver star and all the enlisted received bronze stars with Vs for Operation Forager (Tinian).Naked Warriors, Cdt. Francis Douglas Fane USNR (Ret.), St. Martin's Press, 175 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10010, 1996, pp. 122, 131, For UDTs 3 and 4 every officer received a silver star and all the enlisted received bronze stars with Vs for Operation Forager (Guam). Admiral Richard Lansing Conolly felt the commanders of teams 3 and 4 (Lt. Crist and Lt. W.G. Carberry) should have received Navy Crosses. While the officers and enlisted were individually treated equally in those awards UDTs 4 & 7 also received Naval Unit Commendations while UDTs 3 & 5 received no unit recognition. =Peleliu, Philippines, and Iwo Jima= UDTs 6, 7, and 10 drew the PeleliuAmphibious Assault: Key to the World War II Battle for Peleliu, Toni L.

Chote Jr., who became UDT 10's commanding officer.The men were multi-service: Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps and Navy.OSS in Action The Pacific and the Far East, Series: OSS Training in the National Parks and Service Abroad in World War II, Catoctin Mountain Park, Prince William Forest Park webpage, 8 August 2017, National Park Service, 1100 Ohio Drive, SW, Washington, DC 20242 OPERATIONAL SWIMMER GROUP NAMES IS FROM A LIST WITH THE OSS HONOR ARTICLE PAGE, Military Memories webpage but, the OSS was not allowed to operate in the Pacific Theater. Admiral Nimitz needed swimmers and did approve their transfer from the OSS to his operational and administrative control. Most of their OSS gear was stored as it was not applicable to UDT work however, their swimfins came with them. The other UDTs quickly adopted them. UDT 14 was the first all-Navy team (one of three from the Pacific fleet) even though its CO and XO were CEC and some of Team Able was incorporated. In the Philippines Leyte Gulf UDTs 10 & 15 reconnoitered beaches at Luzon, teams 3, 4, 5, & 8 were sent to Dulag and teams 6, 9, & 10 went to Tacloban. When UDT 3 returned to Maui the team was made the instructors of the school. Lt Crist was again made Training Officer. Under his direction training was broken into four 2-week blocks with an emphasis on swimming and reconnaissance. There were classes in night operations, unit control, coral and lava blasting in addition to bivouacking, small unit tactics and small arms. Lt Crist would be promoted to Lt Cmdr and the team would remain in Hawaii until April 1945. At that time the Seabees of UDT 3 were transferred to Fort Pierce to be the instructors there. In all they would train teams 12 to 22. Lt. Cmdr. Crist would be sent back to Hawaii. D-minus 2 at Iwo Jima UDTs 12, 13, 14, and 15 reconnoitered the beaches from twelve LCI(G) with just one man wounded. They did come under intense heavy fire that sank three of their LCI(G) with the others seriously damaged of disabled. The LCI(G) crews suffered more than the UDTs with the skipper of one boat earning a Medal of Honor. The next day a Japanese bomb hit UDT 15's APD, killing fifteen and wounding 23. It was the largest loss suffered by the UDTs during the war. On D-plus 2 the beachmaster requested help. There were so many broached or damaged landing craft and the beach was so clogged with war debris that there was no place for landing craft to get ashore. Lt Cmdr. E. Hochuli of UDT 12 volunteered his team to go deal with the problem and teams 13 and 14 were ordered to go with.UDT 13, The Men From Fort Pierce(excerpts), Marvin Cooper, U. S. Naval Special Warfare Archives web-site Lt Cmdr. Vincent Moranz of UDT 13 was \\"reluctant, and radioed that his men ... were not salvage-men. It is reported that Capt. (Bull) Hanlon, Underwater Demolition Operations Commanding Officer radioed back that he didn't want anything salvaged, he wanted that beach cleared.\\" The difference in attitude between Hochuli and Moranz would be remembered in the unit awards. The three teams worked for five days clearing the waters edge. While the teams all did the same job under the same conditions the Navy gave them different unit awards: UDT 12 a PUC, UDT 14 a NUC and UDT 13 nothing. The USMC ground commanders felt that every man that set foot on the island during the assault had an award coming. The Navy did not share this point of view, besides UDT 13 not a single USN beach party received a unit award either. On D-plus 2, when the UDTs set foot on beaches that were under a USMC assault, any unit award they received should have come under the USMC award protocol. The USMC Iwo Jima PUC/NUC was a mass award with the PUC going to assault units and the NUC going to support units. UDTs also served at Eniwetok, Ulithi, Leyte, Lingayen Gulf, Zambales, Labuan, and Brunei Bay. At Lingayen UDT 9 was aboard the USS Belknap when she was hit by a Kamikaze. It cost the team one officer, 7 enlisted, 3 MIA and 13 wounded. =Okinawa to the end of the war= Beach reconnaissance map of Okinawa by Team 7 The largest UDT operation of WWII was the invasion of Okinawa, involving teams 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17,(actor Aldo Ray was a member of UDT-17) and 18 (nearly 1,000 men). All prior missions had been in warm tropic waters but, the waters around Okinawa were cool enough that long immersion could cause hypothermia and severe cramps. Since thermal protection for swimmers was not available, UDTs were at risk to these hazards working around Okinawa. Operations included both real reconnaissance and demolition at the landing beaches, and feints to create the illusion of landings in other locations. Pointed poles set into the coral reef protected the beaches on Okinawa. Teams 11 and 16 were sent in to blast the poles. The charges took out all of UDT 11's targets and half of UDT 16's. UDT 16 aborted the operation due to the death of one of their men; hence, their mission was considered a failure. UDT 11 went back the next day and took out the remaining poles after- which the team remained to guide landing-craft to the beach. By wars end 34 teams had been formed with teams 1‚Äì21 having actually been deployed. The Seabees provided half of the men in the teams that saw service. The U.S. Navy did not publicize the existence of the UDTs until post war and when they did they gave credit to Lt. Commander Kauffman and the Seabees.UNDERWATER DEMOLITION, \\"ALL HANDS\\", The Bureau of Naval Personal Information Bulletin, October 1945, NAVPERS-0 NUMBER 343 pp. 12‚Äì15 During WWII the Navy did not have a rating for the UDTs nor did they have an insignia. Those men with the CB rating on their uniforms considered themselves Seabees that were doing underwater demolition. They did not call themselves \\"UDTs\\" or \\"Frogmen\\" but rather \\"Demolitioneers\\" which had carried over from the NCDUsNCDU 216 Photo, National Navy UDT‚ÄìSEAL Museum, North Hutchinson Island, Fort Pierce, FL and LtCdr Kauffmans recruiting them from the Seabee dynamiting and demolition school. UDTs had to meet the military's standard age guidelines, Seabees older could not volunteer. In preparation for the invasion of Japan the UDTs created a cold water training center and mid-1945 UDTs had to meet a new physical standard. UDT 9 lost 70% of the team to this change. The last UDT demolition operation of the war was on 4 July 1945 at Balikpapan, Borneo. The UDTs continued to prepare for the invasion of Japan until VJ Day when their role in the Pacific came to an end. With the draw-down from the war two half-strength UDTs were retained, one on each coast: UDT Baker and UDT Easy. After World War II =Japan occupation= LCDR Edward P. Clayton, (back to camera) Commanding Officer UDT 21, receiving the first sword surrendered to an American force in the Japanese Home islands, from a Japanese Army Coastal Artillery Major (opposite Clayton), at Futtsu-misaki Point, across Tokyo Bay from Yokosuka Naval Base, 28 August 1945. When word of this circulated LCDR Clayton was ordered to give up the sword. Protocol dictated that General MacArthur should receive the first surrendered sword. On 20 August 1945 embarked UDT 21 at Guam as a component of the U.S. occupation force heading for Japan. Nine days later UDT 21 became the first U.S military unit to set foot on Japanese home soil when it reconned the beaches at Futtsu-misaki Point in Tokyo Bay. The assessment was that the area was well suited for landing U.S. amphibious forces. The next day Begor took UDT 21 to Yokosuka Naval Base. There the team cleared the docks for the first U.S. warship to dock in Japan, . The team remained in Tokyo Bay until 8 Sept when it was tasked with locating remaining Kamikaze and two-man submarines at Katsura Wan, Uchiura Wan at Suruga Bay, Sendai, Onohama Shipyards and Choshi.USS BEGOR (APD-127) veterans webpage Orders arrived for Begor to return the team to San Diego on 27 September. From 21‚Äì26 September UDT 11 was at Nagasaki and reported men getting sick from the stench.UDT 11, U. S. Naval Special Warfare Archives web site, \\"The Men From Fort Pierce\\" by Marvin Cooper = China = With the war over thousands of Japanese troops remained in China. The issue was given to the Marine's III Marine Amphibious Corps. UDT 9 was assigned to Operation Beleaguer to recon the landings of the 1st Marine Division at Taku and Tsingtao the first two weeks of October 1945.UNDERWATER DEMOLITION TEAM HISTORIES, WWII UDT TEAM NINE, compiled by Robert Allan King for the UDT-SEAL Museum from public records at the Operational Archives of the Naval Historical Center, U. S. Naval Special Warfare Archives web-site On their way to China the Navy had UDT 8 carry out a mission at Jinaen, Korea 8‚Äì27 September 1945. When UDT 9 arrived back in the States it was made one of the two post-War teams and redesignated UDT Baker. UDT 8 was also sent to China and was at Taku, Chefoo, and Tsingtao.UNDERWATER DEMOLITION TEAM HISTORIES, WWII UDT TEAM EIGHT, compiled by Robert Allan King for the UDT-SEAL Museum from public records at the Operational Archives of the Naval Historical Center, U.

On 27 April, 7 officers and 51 enlisted men embarked the USS Begor at the Seabee base Port Hueneme, CA, for transit to Bikini. At Bikini the drones were controlled from the Begor . Once a water sample was taken the drone would return to the Begor to be hosed down for decontamination. After a Radiation Safety Officer had taken a Geiger counter reading and the OK given, the UDTs would board with a radiation chemist to retrieve the sample.USS BEGOR (APD-127) Veterans webpage Begor came to have the reputation as the most contaminated boat in the fleet. A major issue afterwards was the treatment of the dislocated natives. In November 1948, the Bikinians were relocated to the uninhabited Island of Kili, however that island was located inside a coral reef that had no channel for access to the sea. In the spring of 1949, the Governor of the Trust Territories, Marshall Group requested the U.S. Navy blast a channel to change this. That task was given to the Seabees on Kwajalin whose CO quickly determined this was actually a UDT project. He sent a request to CINCPACFLT who forwarded it to COMPHIBPAC. This ultimately resulted in the sending of UDT 3 on a Civic action program that turned out better than politicians could have hoped. The King of the Bikinians held a send off feast for the UDTs the night before they departed.U.S. Naval Special Warfare Archives, After Operation Crossroads ‚Äì Kili Island, Mack M. Boynton, December 21, 2013 =Submersible Operations= Even though no combat operations seemed likely, the UDTs continued to research new techniques for underwater and shallow-water operations. One area was the use of SCUBA equipment. Dr. Chris Lambertsen had developed the Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit (LARU), an oxygen rebreather, which was used by the Maritime Unit of the OSS. In October 1943, he demonstrated it to LCDR Kauffman, but was told there was no place in current UDT operations for this radically new device. Dr. Lambertsen and the OSS continued to work on closed-circuit oxygen diving and combat swimming. When the OSS was dissolved in 1945, Lambertsen retained the LARU inventory. He later demonstrated the LARU to Army Engineers, the Coast Guard, and the UDTs. In 1947, he demonstrated the LARU to LCDR Francis \\"Doug\\" Fane, then a senior UDT commander. LCDR Fane was enthusiastic for new diving techniques. He pushed for the adoption of rebreathers and SCUBA gear for future operations, but the Navy Experimental Diving Unit and the Navy Dive School, which used the old \\"hard-hat\\" diving apparatus, declared the new equipment be too dangerous. Nonetheless, LCDR Fane invited Dr. Lambertsen to NAB Little Creek, Virginia in January 1948 to demonstrate and train UDT personnel in SCUBA operations. This was the first-ever SCUBA training for Navy divers. Following this training, LCDR Fane and Dr. Lambertsen demonstrated new UDT capabilities with a successful lock-out and re-entry from , an underway submarine, to show the Navy's need for this capability. LCDR Fane then started the classified \\"Submersible Operations\\" or SUBOPS platoon with men drawn from UDT 2 and 4 under the direction of Lieutenant (junior grade) Bruce Dunning. LCDR Fane also brought the conventional \\"Aqua-lung\\" open-circuit SCUBA system into use by the UDTs. Open-circuit SCUBA is less useful to combat divers, as the exhausted air produces a tell-tale trail of bubbles. However, in the early 1950s, the UDTs decided they preferred open-circuit SCUBA, and converted entirely to it. The remaining stock of LARUs was supposedly destroyed in a beach-party bonfire. Later on, the UDT reverted to closed-circuit SCUBA, using improved rebreathers developed by Dr. Lambertsen. It was at this time that the UDT, led by LCDR Fane, established training facilities at Saint Thomas in the Virgin Islands. The UDT also began developing weapons skills and procedures for commando operations on land in coastal regions. The UDT started experiments with insertion/extraction by helicopter, jumping from a moving helicopter into the water or rappelling like mountain climbers to the ground. Experimentation developed a system for emergency extraction by plane called \\"Skyhook\\". Skyhook utilized a large helium balloon and cable rig with harness. A special grabbing device on the nose of a C-130 enabled a pilot to snatch the cable tethered to the balloon and lift a person off the ground. Once airborne, the crew would winch the cable in and retrieve the personnel though the back of the aircraft. This technique was discontinued for training purposes after the death of a SEAL at NAB Coronado on a training lift. The teams still utilize the Skyhook for equipment extraction and retain the capability for war if an extreme situation requires it.  Korean War  During the Korean War, the UDTs operated on the coasts of North Korea, with their efforts initially focused on demolitions and mine disposal. Additionally, the UDT accompanied South Korean commandos on raids in the North to demolish railroad tunnels and bridges. The higher-ranking officers of the UDT frowned upon this activity because it was a non-traditional use of the Naval forces, which took them too far from the water line. Due to the nature of the war, the UDT maintained a low operational profile. Some of the better-known missions include the transport of spies into North Korea, and the destruction of North Korean fishing nets. A more traditional role for the UDT was in support of Operation CHROMITE, the amphibious landing at Inchon. UDT 1 and UDT 3 divers went in ahead of the landing craft, scouting mud flats, marking low points in the channel, clearing fouled propellers, and searching for mines. Four UDT personnel acted as wave- guides for the Marine landing. The UDT assisted in clearing mines in Wonsan harbor, under fire from enemy shore batteries. Two minesweepers were sunk in these operations. A UDT diver dove on the wreck of , the first U.S. combat operation using SCUBA gear. The Korean War was a period of transition for the men of the UDT. They tested their previous limits and defined new parameters for their special style of warfare. These new techniques and expanded horizons positioned the UDT well to assume an even broader role as war began brewing to the south in Vietnam.  Vietnam War  The Navy entered the Vietnam War in 1958, when the UDTs delivered a small watercraft far up the Mekong River into Laos. In 1961, naval advisers started training South Vietnamese personnel in South Vietnam. The men were called the Li√™n ƒêo√†n Ng∆∞·ªùi Nh√°i (LDNN) or Vietnamese Frogment, which translates as \\"Frogmen Team.\\" UDT 11 awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for service in Vietnam from 28 January 1964 to 5 September 1966. UDT teams carried out hydrographic surveys in South Vietnam's coastal waters and reconnaissance missions of harbors, beaches and rivers often under hazardous conditions and enemy fire. Later, the UDTs supported the Amphibious Ready Groups operating on South Vietnam's rivers. UDTs manned riverine patrol craft and went ashore to demolish obstacles and enemy bunkers. They operated throughout South Vietnam, from the Mekong Delta (Sea Float), The Parrot Beak and French canal AO's through I Corps and the Song Cui Dai Estuary south of Danang.  Birth of Navy SEALs  In the mid-1950s, the Navy saw how the UDT's mission had expanded to a broad range of \\"unconventional warfare\\", but also that this clashed with the UDT's traditional focus on swimming and diving operations. It was therefore decided to create a new type of unit that would build on the UDT's elite qualities and water-borne expertise, but would add land combat skills, including parachute training and guerrilla/counterinsurgency operations. These new teams would come to be known as the US Navy SEALs, an acronym for Sea, Air, and Land. Initially there was a lag in the unit's creation until President John F. Kennedy took office. Kennedy recognized the need for unconventional warfare, and supported the use of special operations forces against guerrilla activity. The Navy moved forward to establish its new special operations force and in January 1962 commissioned SEAL Team ONE in NAB Coronado and SEAL Team TWO at NAB Little Creek. UDT-11 & 12 were still active on the west coast and UDT-21 & 22 on the east coast. The SEALs quickly earned a reputation for valor and stealth in Vietnam, where they conducted clandestine raids in perilous territory. In May 1983, the remaining UDT teams were reorganized as SEAL teams. UDT 11 became SEAL Team Five and UDT 12 became Seal Delivery Vehicle Team One. UDT 21 became SEAL Team Four and UDT 22 became Seal Delivery Vehicle Team Two. A new team, SEAL Team Three was established in October 1983. Since then, teams of SEALs have taken on clandestine missions in war-torn regions around the world, tracking high-profile targets such as Panama's Manuel Noriega and Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar, and playing integral roles in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Badge For those who served in an Underwater Demolition Team, the U.S. Navy authorized the Underwater Demolition operator badge in 1970. However, the UDT badge was phased out in 1971, a few months after it appeared, as was the silver badge for enlisted UDT/SEAL frogmen. After that, SEAL and UDT operators, both officer and enlisted, all wore the same gold Trident, as well as gold Navy jump wings.  Unit awards  The UDTs have received several unit citations and commendations. Members who participated in actions that merited the award are authorized to wear the medal or ribbon associated with the award on their uniform. Awards and decorations of the United States Armed Forces have different categories, (i.e. Service, Campaign, Unit, and Personal). Unit Citations are distinct from the other decorations.List of Award Abbreviations, Chief of Naval Operations, 2000 Navy Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20350 Naval Combat Demolition Force O (Omaha beach) Normandy *60 px Presidential Unit Citation Normandy Naval Combat Demolition Force U (Utah beach) : Normandy *60 px Navy Unit Commendation : Normandy UDT 1 *60 px Navy Unit Commendation : KoreaNaval History and Heritage Command website, Part 2 - Unit Awards, Published:Mon Aug 31 14:01:11 EDT 2015, p. 22 UDT 4 *60 px Navy Unit Commendation : Guam *60 px Navy Unit Commendation : Leyte *60 px Navy Unit Commendation : Okinawa UDT 7 *60 px Navy Unit Commendation : Marianas *60 px Navy Unit Commendation : Western Carolinas UDT 11 *60 px Presidential Unit Citation : Okinawa.US Navy Awards, Chief of Naval Operations, 2000 Navy Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20350 *60 px Presidential Unit Citation : Bruni Bay, Borneo, *60 px Presidential Unit Citation : Balikpapan, Burneo, *60 px Navy Unit Commendation 1966 *60 px Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation 1968 *60 px Navy Unit Commendation 1969 *60 px Presidential Unit Citation : 1969 *60 px Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation 1969 *60 px Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation 1969 *60 px Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation 1970 *60 px Republic of Vietnam Civil Actions Medal Unit Citation *60 px Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm Unit Award *60px Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation UDT 12 *60 px Presidential UnitCitation : Iwo Jima, *60 px Presidential Unit Citation : Okimawa *60 px Navy Unit Commendation 1966 *60 px Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation Vietnam 1967 *60 px Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation Vietnam 1967 *60 px Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation Vietnam 1968 *60 px Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation Vietnam 1968 *60 px Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation Vietnam 1969 *60 px Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm Unit Award *60px Operation Eagle Pull *60px Operation Frequent Wind *60 px Humanitarian Service Medal 1979 Boat People UDT 13 *60 px Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation VietnamUS Navy Awards, Chief of Naval Operations, 2000 Navy Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20350 1969 *60 px Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm Unit Award 1970 UDT 14 *60 px Navy Unit Commendation : Luzon *60 px Navy Unit Commendation : Iwo Jima *60 px Navy Unit Commendation : Okinawa UDT 21 *60px Navy Expeditionary Medal *60 px Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation VietnamUS Navy Awards, Chief of Naval Operations, 2000 Navy Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20350 *60 px Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation Vietnam *60 px Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation Vietnam *60 px Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation Vietnam UDT 22 *60 px Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation VietnamUS Navy Awards, Chief of Naval Operations, 2000 Navy Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20350 1969 *OPNAV NOTICE 1650, MASTER LIST OF UNIT AWARDS AND CAMPAIGN MEDALSOPNAV NOTICE 1650, MASTER LIST OF UNIT AWARDS AND CAMPAIGN MEDALS,DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS, 2000 NAVY PENTAGON, WASHINGTON, DC 20350-2000, 18 September 2002 Fiction * The Frogmen (1951), starring Dana Andrews and Richard Widmark.

In his autobiography The Way of an Investigator, Cannon counts himself among the descendants of Jacques de Noyon, a French Canadian explorer and coureur des bois. His Calvinist family was intellectually active, including readings from James Martineau, John Fiske (philosopher), and James Freeman Clarke. Cannon's curiosity also led him to Thomas Henry Huxley, John Tyndall, George Henry Lewes, and William Kingdon Clifford.Way of an Investigator, pp. 16‚Äì7 A high school teacher, Mary Jeannette Newson, became his mentor. \\"Miss May\\" Newson motivated him and helped him take his academic skills into Harvard University in 1892.Saul Benison, A. Clifford Barger, Elin L. Wolfe (1987) Walter B. Cannon: the Life and Times of a Young Scientist. pp.16‚Äì32, Belknap Press. Upon finishing his undergraduate studies in 1896, he entered Harvard Medical School. He started using x-rays to study the physiology of digestion while working with Henry P. Bowditch. In 1900 he received his medical degree. After graduation, Cannon was hired by William Townsend Porter at Harvard as an instructor in the Department of Physiology while continuing his study of digestion. Cannon was promoted to an assistant professor of physiology in 1902. He was a close friend of the physicist, G. W. Pierce, and together they founded the Wicht Club with other young instructors for social and professional purposes. In 1906, Cannon had succeeded Bowditch as the Higginson Professor and chairman of the Department of Physiology at Harvard Medical School until 1942. From 1914 to 1916, Cannon was also President of the American Physiological Society. He was married to Cornelia James Cannon, a best-selling author and feminist reformer. On July 19,1901, during their honeymoon in Montana, they were the first people to reach the summit of the unclimbed southwest peak (2657 m or 8716 ft) of Goat Mountain, between Lake McDonald and Logan Pass. That area is now Glacier National Park. The peak was subsequently named, Mount Cannon, by the United States Geological Survey The couple had five children; A son, Dr. Bradford Cannon, a military plastic surgeon and radiation researcher. The daughters were Wilma Cannon Fairbank (Mrs. John K. Fairbank), Linda Cannon Burgess, Helen Cannon Bond and Marian Cannon Schlesinger, a painter and author living in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His philosophy of life may be inferred by his actions and his statements. Born into a Calvinistic family, he broke away from religious authoritarianism and achieved an independence from his prior dogma. Later in life he states that naturally occurring events are what makes for a useful end. He took on the role of a naturalist where believed that the body and mind are inseparable as an organismic unit. The explanations of his work should enable man to live more wisely, happily, and intelligently without the interjection of supernatural interference. Walter Cannon died on October 1, 1945 in Franklin, New Hampshire.  Work  Walter Bradford Cannon Walter Cannon began his career in science as a Harvard undergraduate in the year 1892. Henry Pickering Bowditch, who had worked with Claude Bernard, directed the laboratory in physiology at Harvard. Here Cannon began his research: he used the newly discovered x-rays to study the mechanism of swallowing and the motility of the stomach. Within his first experiments he was able to watch the course of a button down a dog's esophagus. He says in his autobiography, The Way of an Investigator, ‚ÄúThe whole purpose of my effort was to see the peristaltic waves to learn their effects. Only after some time did I note that the absence of activity was accompanied by signs of perturbation, and when serenity was restored the waves promptly reappeared.‚Äù He demonstrated deglutition in a goose at the APS meeting in December 1896 and published his first paper on this research in the first issue of the American Journal of Physiology in January 1898. In 1945 Cannon summarized his career in physiology by describing his focus at different ages:On page 218 of his book The Way of an Investigator, * Age 26 ‚Äì 40: digestion and the bismuth meal * Age 40 ‚Äì 46: bodily effects of emotional excitement * Age 46 ‚Äì 51: wound shock investigations * Age 51 ‚Äì 59: stable states of the organism * Age 59 ‚Äì 68: chemical mediation of nerve impulses (collaboration with Arturo Rosenblueth) * Age 68 + : chemical sensitivity of nerve-isolated organs = Scientific contributions = ;Use of salts of heavy metals in X-Rays :He was one of the first researchers to mix salts of heavy metals (including bismuth subnitrate, bismuth oxychloride, and barium sulfate) into foodstuffs in order to improve the contrast of x-ray images of the digestive tract. The barium meal is a modern derivative of this research. ;Fight or flight :In 1915, he coined the term fight or flight to describe an animal's response to threats in Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear and Rage: An Account of Recent Researches into the Function of Emotional Excitement. He asserted that not only physical emergencies, such as blood loss from trauma, but also psychological emergencies, such as antagonistic encounters between members of the same species, evoke release of adrenaline into the bloodstream. As per Cannon, adrenaline exerts several important effects in different body organs, all of which maintain homeostasis in fight-or-flight situations. For example, in the skeletal muscle of the limbs, adrenaline relaxes blood vessels which increases local blood flow. Adrenaline constricts blood vessels in the skin and minimizes blood loss from physical trauma. Adrenaline also releases the key metabolic fuel, glucose, from the liver into the bloodstream. However, the fact that aggressive attack and fearful escape both involve adrenaline release into the bloodstream does not imply an equivalence of ‚Äúfight‚Äù with ‚Äúflight‚Äù from a physiological or biochemical point of view. ;Wound shock :As a military physician in World War I he discovered that the blood of shocked men was acidic. As a member of the British Medical Research Council's Special Committee on Shock and Allied Conditions, he advocated treating shocked wounded by infusing sodium bicarbonate to neutralize the acid. He and William Bayliss infused acid into an anesthetized cat, which died. However, a second trial done with Bayliss and Henry Dale failed to produce shock. Shock was successfully treated by infusing saline containing some larger molecules. ;Homeostasis :He developed the concept of homeostasis from the earlier idea of Claude Bernard of milieu interieur, and popularized it in his book The Wisdom of the Body,1932. Cannon presented four tentative propositions to describe the general features of homeostasis: :#Constancy in an open system that requires mechanisms that act to maintain this system, just like our bodies. Cannon based this proposition on insights of steady states such as glucose concentrations, body temperature and acid-base balance. :#Steady-state conditions require that any tendency toward change automatically meets with factors that resist change. An increase in blood sugar results in thirst as the body attempts to dilute the concentration of sugar in the extracellular fluid. :#The regulating system that determines the homeostatic state consists of many cooperating mechanisms acting simultaneously or successively. Blood sugar is regulated by insulin, glucagons, and other hormones that control its release from the liver or its uptake by the tissues. :#Homeostasis does not occur by chance, but is the result of organized self-government. ;The Sympathoadrenal System Cannon proposed the existence and functional unity of the sympathoadrenal (or ‚Äúsympathoadrenomedullary‚Äù or ‚Äúsympathico-adrenal‚Äù) system. He theorized that the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal gland work together as a unit to maintain homeostasis in emergencies. To identify and quantify adrenaline release during stress, beginning in about 1919 Cannon exploited an ingenious experimental setup. He would surgically excise the nerves by supplying the heart of a laboratory animal such as a dog or cat. Then he would subject the animal to a stressor and record the heart rate response. With the nerves to the heart removed, he could deduce that if the heart rate increased in response to the perturbation, then the increase in heart rate must have resulted from the actions of a hormone. Finally, he would compare the results of an animal with intact adrenal glands with those in an animal from which he had removed the adrenal glands. From the difference in the heart rate between the two animals, he could further infer that the hormone responsible for the increase in heart rate came from the adrenal glands. Moreover, the amount of increase in the heart rate provided a measure of the amount of hormone released. Cannon became so convinced that the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal gland functioned as a unit that in the 1930s that he formally proposed that the sympathetic nervous system uses the same chemical messenger‚Äîadrenaline‚Äîas does the adrenal gland. Cannon‚Äôs notion of a unitary sympathoadrenal system persists to this day. Researchers in the area have come to question the validity of the notion of a unitary sympathoadrenal system, although clinicians often continue to lump together the two components. ;Cannon-Bard theory :Cannon developed the Cannon-Bard theory with physiologist Philip Bard to try to explain why people feel emotions first and then act upon them. ;Dry mouth :He put forward the Dry Mouth Hypothesis, stating that people get thirsty because their mouths get dry. He did an experiment on two dogs. He made incisions in their throats and inserted small tubes. Any water swallowed would go through their mouths and out by the tubes, never reaching their stomachs. He found out that these dogs would lap up the same amount of water as control dogs.

In second place is UK's Farnborough, followed by Dubai Air Show or Singapore Airshow. The latest was the 53rd Air Show which was held from 17 to 23 June 2019 with 2,453 exhibitors from 49 countries over 125,000 m2 It claims to be the world's calendar-oldest air show. Established in 1909, it has been held every odd year since 1949 at Paris‚ÄìLe Bourget Airport in north Paris, France. It is a large trade fair, demonstrating military and civilian aircraft, and is attended by many military forces and the major aircraft manufacturers, often announcing major aircraft sales. It starts with four professional days and is then opened to the general public followed from Friday to Sunday. The format is similar to Farnborough and the ILA, both staged in even years. It is organised by the French aerospace industry's primary representative body, the Groupement des industries fran√ßaises a√©ronautiques et spatiales (GIFAS).  History  The first Salon de la locomotion a√©rienne, 1909, Grand Palais, Paris. The Paris Air Show traces its history back to the first decade of the 20th century. In 1908 a section of the Paris Motor Show was dedicated to aircraft.\\"The First Paris Aeronautical Salon\\" Flight January 2, 1909. The following year, a dedicated air show was held at the Grand Palais\\"Paris Flight Show -First Impressions of an Artistic and Fascinating Display\\" Flight October 2, 1909 from 25 September to 17 October, during which 100,000 visitors turned out to see products and innovations from 380 exhibitors. There were four further shows before the First World War. SNCASE SE.212 Durandal experimental jet/rocket fighter aircraft at the 1957 Air Salon The air show continued to be held at the Grand Palais, and from 1949 flying demonstrations were staged at Paris Orly Airport. In 1953, the show was relocated from the Grand Palais to Le Bourget. The show was drawing international notice in the 1960s. Since the 1970s, the show has emerged as the main international reference of the aeronautical sector. =1967= The 1967 air show was opened by French President Charles de Gaulle, who toured the exhibits and shook hands with two Soviet cosmonauts and two American astronauts. Prominently displayed by the Soviet Union was a three- stage Vostok rocket, such as the one that had carried Yuri Gagarin into space on April 12, 1961. The \\"extraordinarily powerful\\" Vostok was downplayed by American missile experts as \\"rather old and unsophisticated.\\"Mooney, Richard E. \\"Soviet Competes with U.S. in Paris.\\" New York Times. May 26. 1967. 92. The American exhibit, the largest at the fair, featured the F-111 swing-wing fighter bomber, a replica of Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis. and the Ling-Temco-Vought XC-142A, a cargo plane capable of a vertical takeoff and landing. A full-size model of the supersonic Concorde was displayed by the French and British, auguring its successful first flight on March 2, 1969.Witkin, Richard. \\"Supersonic Concorde Airliner Successful in 28-Minute Maiden Flight.\\" New York Times. March 3, 1969. 1. =1969= \\"The largest plane in the world,\\" the Boeing 747 jet airliner, arrived on June 3, after flying non-stop from Seattle, Washington, and the Apollo 8 command module, charred by its re-entry, was there flanked by the Apollo 9 astronauts, but the most-viewed exhibit was the supersonic Concorde, which made its first flight over Paris as the show opened. =1971= The Soviet TU-144 supersonic airliner was flown to Le Bourget for the 1971 show, drawing comparisons with the French Concorde. Landing with the Concorde was the world's largest aircraft, the American Lockheed C-5A Galaxy. =1973= The crash of the Soviet Tu-144, see below, overshadowed the 1973 show, otherwise characterized by \\"There was nothing new\\", although the flying was memorable, and there were a great many exhibits. =1975= One hundred and eighty-two aircraft were scheduled for appearance. Despite restrictions that followed the TU-144 crash in 1973, a day of flying pleased viewers. In particular, the American YF-16 and the French Mirage F-1E competed in turn before a critical audience. Days later, Belgium became the fourth European nation to choose the YF-16 over the F-1E. =1977= Celebration of Charles Lindbergh's trans-Atlantic flight to Le Bourget fifty years ago recalled that historic event. Anne Morrow Lindbergh, Lindbergh's widow, attended the ceremony along with early trans- Atlantic pilots, Maurice Bellonte and Armand Lotti. Recent extension of coastal limits to 200 nautical miles has produced new maritime-reconnaissance (MR) aircraft. The crash of a Fairchild A-10 tank-destroyer led to tightened rules on air show demonstrations. =1979= Two airliners, the Airbus A310 and the Boeing 767, are competing for the international market, but neither will carry passengers before 1982. The Westland WG30 transport helicopter shows promise. \\"The Mirage 4000 remains a question mark\\" despite being \\"surely the main highlight this year at Le Bourget.\\" =1981= Exhibiting at the show, Airbus, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas/Fokker vie for the 150-seat airline market, while Rolls Royce/Japan, General Electric/Snecma (CFM), and Pratt & Whitney contest for their engines. The Northrop F-5G Tigershark mockup was on display and expected to fly in 1982 with delivery the following year. A novelty was Air Transat, a light aircraft trans-Atlantic race from Le Bourget to Sikorsky Memorial Airport, Bridgeport, Connecticut and back, won by a twin engine Piper Navaho and a Beechcraft Bonanza. =1983= The American Space Shuttle Enterprise was flown around Paris and towered over other exhibits, but \\"much more intriguing\\" were replicas of two twin-engined fighters, the British Aerospace ACA and French Dassault Breguet ACX. Sales of Boeing 757 and Airbus A310 airliners to Singapore Airlines were welcome news during an ongoing recession. =1985= The Soviet Antonov An-124 Ruslan military heavy lifter was the largest exhibit in 1985. Propfan engines stirred interest. Reflecting the upturn in the economy, Boeing and Airbus announced new contracts totaling as much as $1,700 million. The Hubble Space Telescope should be deployed in 1986. =1987= Newly introduced, in the rain, were the Soviet Mil Mi-34 Helicopter, the Israeli Super Phantom, and the Harrier GR.5. Airbus announced firm orders for both the A330 and A340 airliners. Exhibiting at the show for the first time, the Chinese displayed, among others, the A-5C Attacker (Fantan) and FT-7. Richard Rutan and Jeana Yeager, who flew a Voyager non-stop around the world without refueling, were present, but their aircraft was not. = 1989 = Antonov An-225 Mriya with Buran at Le Bourget, 1989 The \\"38th Paris International Air and Space Show\\" or \\"1989 Paris Air Show\\", featured a variety of aerospace technology from NATO and Warsaw Pact nations.dodmedia id:DF-ST-90-07206 A Mikoyan MiG-29 crashed during a demonstration flight with no loss of life. The then-Soviet space shuttle Buran and its carrier, Antonov An-225 Mriya, was displayed at this show. A Sukhoi Su-27 made debut to western world, as well first publicly seen \\"Cobra\\" maneuver. https://money.cnn.com/gallery/news/2017/06/16/paris-air-show-history-military- planes/2.html =1991= Despite a Department of Defense display of the Stealth bomber and other Gulf War armaments, most American contractors stayed home, so Soviet aircraft drew attention, among them the Beriev Be-42 Mermaid (A-40 Albatros) amphibian, the MiG-31 Foxhound interceptor, and the Yak-141 short take-off/vertical landing (ASTOVL) supersonic fighter. When it receives its first customer order, Dassault plans to begin production of the Mirage 2000-5, which is a \\"new machine compared to the basic Mirage 2000.\\" = 1993 = The show attracted 1,611 exhibitors from 39 countries and nearly 300,000 visitors attended the show. Dassault featured the debut of the Falcon 2000, and Airbus will manufacture the 130-seat A319. = 1995 = A stealth B-2 Spirit in 1995 The 41st Paris Air Show main attraction was the stealth B-2 Spirit bomber, along with the Tupolev Tu-160 and Sukhoi Su-32 bombers. The flying display included the Bell-Boeing V-22 tilt-rotor, the Airbus Beluga Super Transporter, the Eurofighter 2000, the Rockwell-MBB X-31 high- manoeuvrability fighter demonstrator, the McDonnell Douglas C-17 military transport, the Eurocopter EC135 civil helicopter, the Sukhoi Su-35 fighter, and the Daimler-Benz Aerospace Dornier 328-100, and for the first time on static the Boeing 777, Saab Gripen, Atlas Cheetah Mirage and Cessna Citation X. =1997= America Eagle announced purchase of forty-two EMB-145 regional jets from Embraer and twenty-five Bombardier CRJ700 airliners from Bombardier. Spectators saw two Eurofighter Typhoon EF2000s flying together. A full-scale mock-up of the Bell Boeing 609 civil tilt-rotor aircraft attracted attention. IAR Brasov featured a prototype Anti-Tank Optronic Search and Combat System (SOCAT) helicopter, an upgrade of the IAR-330 Puma. =1999= The 1999 show continued a trend away from displays of new aircraft toward announcements of new contracts. Although new entries such as the Fairchild 30-seat 328JET and the Boeing 100-seat 717-200 attracted interest, airlines ordered as many as 103 Embraer ERJ-135s and 145s in addition to a 4.9 billion-dollar order for ERJ-170s and ERJ-190-200s. In February, the Russian Il-103 received US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval, a breakthrough in certifying Russian aircraft for the American market. Subsequent certification for the Ilyushin Il-96T wide-bodied jet was displayed at the show. =2001= Boeing introduced scale models of their Sonic Cruiser which would reach speeds approaching Mach 0.98, together with a walk-through hologram. The Airbus A380, seating 555, offered size rather than speed, and was there on the tarmac. Crowds toured the restored Antonov An-225 Dream, the world's largest aircraft. Dassault featured a model of the new Falcon FNX business jet that is projected to fly 10,500 kilometers at Mach 0.88. The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), which is undergoing STOVL testing, is a likely replacement for older American F-15E Strike Eagles and F-117 Nighthawks. =2003= The Concorde F-BTSD made its farewell landing at Le Bourget on June 14, the opening day, and the Dassault's Mirage 2000 and Rafale put on a show overhead. Pilotless planes, such as the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk and General Atomics Predator drew attention. Boeing publicized the 7E7 Dreamliner. =2005= FlightGlobal cited the Airbus A380 and \\"nineteen remarkable first appearances,\\" including Dassault's Falcon 7X and Gulfstream's G550 business jets, Embraer's EMB-195 regional jet, and the second prototype of Alenia Aermacchi's M-346 advanced jet trainer. CompositesWorld added the Boeing 777-200LR and the Dassault UCAV Neuron. =2007= The Boeing 787 Dreamliner sold briskly, as did the Airbus A380 and A350 XWB. A mockup of the Lockheed Martin Joint Strike Fighter was on display. The IAI Heron TP UAV is ready to enter production. The Spanish steer-by- leaning AN-1 AeroQuad flying platform from Aeris Naviter weighed only 100 kilograms. = 2009 = The 48th International Paris Air Show took place in 2009 and marked a hundred years of technological innovation in aeronautics and space conquest. The event was held from 15 to 21 June, at Le Bourget. A memorial service was held for the victims of Air France Flight 447. =2011= Solar Impulse at Le Bourget 2011 The 2011 show was the 49th presentation, and hosted over international exhibitors in 28 international pavilions. A total of 150 aircraft were on display, including the solar-electric aircraft Solar Impulse. A demo A380 was damaged the day before the exhibition opened and needed a replacement;Un A380 heurte un b√¢timent au Bourget (\\"A380 clips a building\\") , TF1 News, 19 juin 2011.L'A380 volera tout de m√™me au salon du Bourget (\\"A380 will still fly at Paris Air Show\\"), La Tribune, 20 juin 2011. while the new Airbus A400M Atlas military transport aircraft had an engine failure, but could still perform some demonstration flights. =2015= The 2015 show, held from June 15 to June 21, 2015, saw the new Dassault Falcon 8X, Airbus A350 XWB and Bombardier CS300 and received 351,584 visitors, 2,303 exhibitors over 122,500 square metres of exhibition space, 4,359 journalists from 72 countries and 130 billion euros in purchases and \\"cemented its position as the world's largest event dedicated to the aerospace industry\\". During the show, Airbus Helicopters announced a successor to the Super Puma, called the Airbus Helicopters X6.Airbus Reveals Super Puma Successor =2017= Airbus Helicopters X3-derived RACER model, 2017 The 52nd Air Show was held from 19 to 25 June 2017, with 2,381 exhibitors from 48 countries, showing 140 aircraft including for the first time the Airbus A321neo, Airbus A350-1000, Boeing 787-10, Boeing 737 MAX 9, Kawasaki P-1, Mitsubishi MRJ90 and Lockheed Martin F-35. Inaugurated by French President Emmanuel Macron, it was visited by 290 official delegations from 98 countries and 7 international organizations, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, 3,450 journalists, 142,000 trade visitors and 180,000 general public visitors. Announcements for 934 commercial aircraft orders and purchasing commitments were worth a catalogue value of US$115 billion. There were 1,226 order and commitments : 352 firm orders, 699 letters of intent or memorandums of understanding, 40 options and 135 options letters of intent; plus 229 conversions of existing orders, mainly for the Boeing 737-10 MAX variant launched at the show. There were mainly narrowbodies with 1,021 orders or commitments against 76 widebodies, 48 regional jets and 81 turboprop airliners. With 766, mainly preliminary deals, Boeing led Airbus with 331, while Bombardier Aerospace had 64, Embraer 48 and ATR Aircraft 17. Nearly half of those order and commitments was from aircraft lessors with 513, and where the operator was known, 43% came from Asia-Pacific, 27% from the middle east, 10% from Europe as from South America, 7% from Africa and 3% from North America. =2019= Paris air show 2019 The 53rd Air Show was held from 17 to 23 June 2019 with 2,453 exhibitors from 49 countries over of exhibition space for 140 aircraft shown including the recently certified Airbus A330neo and Boeing KC-46, Bombardier Global 7500, Embraer Praetor 600 and soon to be certified Cessna Citation Latitude; it saw 316,470 unique visitors (for more than 500,000 entries): 139,840 professional from 185 countries and 176,630 from the general Public plus 2,700 journalists from 87 countries and announcements for $140 billion worth of orders. The air show ended with 866 aircraft commitments totalling $60.9 billion (130 firm orders, 562 LoI/MoU, 119 options and 55 options on LoIs): 388 for Airbus including 243 newly launched A321XLRs and 85 A220s, 232 for Boeing including 200 737 MAXes for IAG, 145 for ATR and 78 for Embraer; 558 narrowbodies, 62 widebodies, 93 regional jets and 153 turboprops.  Accidents  = 1961 = A Convair B-58 Hustler crashed while doing low-altitude aerobatics. The aircraft reportedly flew into a cloud bank, where visual reference was lost, and crashed. = 1965 = Another Convair B-58 crashed while on final approach during an overweight landing. The aircraft touched down short of the runway, killing United States Air Force Lt. Colonel Charles D. Tubbs. Two other crewmen were injured. = 1969 = A Fairchild-Hiller FH-1100 helicopter crashed killing the pilot. Witnesses of the crash cite seeing \\"something wrong with the main rotor\\". = 1973 = At the Paris Air Show on June 3, 1973, the second Tupolev Tu-144 production aircraft (registration SSSR-77102) crashed during its display. It stalled while attempting a rapid climb. Trying to pull out of the subsequent dive, the aircraft broke up and crashed, destroying 15 houses and killing all six on board and eight on the ground; a further sixty people received serious injuries. The cause of this accident remains controversial. Theories include: the Tu-144 climbed to avoid a French Mirage chase plane whose pilot was attempting to photograph it; that changes had been made by the ground engineering team to the auto-stabilisation circuits to allow the Tu-144 to outperform the Concorde in the display circuit; and that the crew were attempting a manoeuvre and to outshine the Concorde. = 1977 = An A-10 Thunderbolt crashed killing the pilot. = 1989 = A Mikoyan MiG-29 crashed during a demonstration flight with no loss of life. = 1999 = A Sukhoi Su-30MKI crashed during a demonstration flight with no loss of life.

It lies on the A30 road near the Devon and Dorset borders, south west of Yeovil. The parish has a population of approximately 13,000 and, at an elevation of , Chard is the southernmost and one of the highest towns in Somerset. Administratively Chard forms part of the district of South Somerset. The name of the town was Cerden in 1065 and Cerdre in the Domesday Book of 1086. After the Norman Conquest, Chard was held by the Bishop of Wells. The town's first charter was from King John in 1234. Most of the town was destroyed by fire in 1577, and it was further damaged during the English Civil War. A 1663 will by Richard Harvey of Exeter established Almshouses known as Harvey's Hospital. In 1685 during the Monmouth Rebellion, the pretender James Scott was proclaimed King in the Town prior to his defeat on Sedgemoor. Chard subsequently witnessed the execution and traitor's death of 12 condemned rebels, who were tried at Taunton Castle by the infamous Judge Jeffries, and hanged near the Tesco roundabout. The Chard Canal was a tub boat canal built between 1835 and 1842. Chard Branch Line was created in 1860 to connect the two London and South Western Railway and Bristol and Exeter Railway main lines and ran through Chard until 1965. The town has a very unusual feature, a stream running along either side of Fore Street. One stream eventually flows into the Bristol Channel and the other reaches the English Channel. Chard Reservoir, approximately a mile north east of the town, is a Local Nature Reserve, and Snowdon Hill Quarry a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Major employers in the town include Numatic International Limited and the Oscar Mayer food processing plant. There are a range of sporting and cultural facilities, with secondary education being provided at Holyrood Academy; religious sites including the Church of St Mary the Virgin, which dates from the late 11th century. History The earliest evidence of settlement near Chard is the Iron Age fort of Cotley Castle overlooking the Town near Bound's Lane. There was a small Saxon settlement centred round the Church and the area still known as 'Old Town'. Chard's name was Cerden in 1065 and Cerdre in the Domesday Book of 1086 and it means \\"house on the chart or rough ground\\" (Old English: ƒáeart + renn). Before the Norman Conquest Chard was held by the Bishop of Wells. The town's first charter was from King John and another from the bishop in 1234, which delimited the town and laid out burgage holdings in lots at a rent of twelve pence per year. The parish of Chard was part of the Kingsbury Hundred, Most of the town was destroyed by fire in 1577. After this time the town was largely rebuilt including Waterloo House and Manor Court House in Fore Street which were built as a house and courtroom, and have now been converted into shops and offices. Further damage to the town took place during the English Civil War with both sides plundering its resources, particularly in 1644 when Charles I spent a week in the town. A 1663 will by Richard Harvey of Exeter established Almshouses which became Harvey's Hospital. These were rebuilt in 1870 largely of stone from previous building. In 1685 during the Monmouth Rebellion, the pretender James Scott was proclaimed King in the Town and several locals joined his forces. Commander of the pursuing Royalist army, John Churchill, made a severe cautionary speech to the Townsfolk in St Mary's. After the rebellion collapsed, Chard witnessed the execution and traitor's death of 12 of the Duke of Monmouth's rebels, who were summarily tried and condemned at Taunton Castle by the infamous Judge Jeffries. They were hung, drawn and quartered near the Tesco roundabout by the 'Handcross tree'. The tree was removed by the railway in 1864 amid loud local protests. There was a fulling mill in the town by 1394 for the textile industry. After 1820 this expanded with the town becoming a centre for lace manufacture led by manufacturers who fled from the Luddite resistance they had faced in the English Midlands. Bowden's Old Lace Factory and the Gifford Fox factory are examples of the sites constructed. The Guildhall was built as a Corn Exchange and Guildhall in 1834 and is now the Town Hall. On Snowdon Hill is a small cottage which was originally a toll house built by the Chard Turnpike trust in the 1830s, to collect fees from those using a road up the hill which avoided the steep gradient. Fore Street Chard claims to be the birthplace of powered flight, as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian aeronautical pioneer John Stringfellow (1799‚Äì1883) first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. James Gillingham (1839‚Äì1924) from Chard pioneered the development of articulated artificial limbs when he produced a prosthesis for a man who lost his arm in a cannon accident in 1863. Chard Museum has a display of Gillingham's work. Chard was a key point on the Taunton Stop Line, a World War II defensive line consisting of pillboxes and anti-tank obstacles, which runs from Axminster north to the Somerset coast near Highbridge. In 1938 a bomb proof bunker was built behind the branch of the Westminster Bank. During the war it was used to hold duplicate copies of the bank records in case its headquarters in London was destroyed. It was also used to store the emergency bank note supply of the Bank of England. There has also been speculation that the Crown Jewels were also stored there, however this has never been confirmed. Action Aid, the International Development Charity, had their headquarters in Chard when they started life in 1972 as Action in Distress. The Supporters Services department of the charity is still based in Chard. Every year, the annual Chard Eating Competition is held with many residents turning out to see who can eat the most. In 2016, local resident Harley Richards, was the winner managing a consecutive 37 hot dogs and nettles. Governance The Guildhall Chard was one of the boroughs reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, and remained a municipal borough known as Chard Municipal Borough. until the Local Government Act 1972, when it became a successor parish in the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset. The town council (a parish council with the status of a town) has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic; their role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The town council has a reception and offices in the guildhall. The building was built in 1834 as a corn exchange, replacing an earlier 16th-century building that used to be situated perpendicular to where the current road is in the high street outside the Phoenix Hotel, a dig of the high street back in the late 1980s revealed the original footprint of the old guildhall. The new re-modeled Guildhall is a Grade II* listed building. In 2006 Chard Town Council came to the attention of the National Press when Mayor Tony Prior was found guilty of sexual discrimination and victimisation of the Town Clerk. He was ordered to pay ¬£33,000 in compensation. Prior was banned from holding public office for nine months but was returned to council (as an independent Councillor) in a 2010 by-election. The South Somerset district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, the library, roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. The civil parish of Chard Town (its formal name) contains exactly five electoral wards ‚Äì Avishayes, Coome, Crimchard, Holyrood, and Jocelyn. Chard is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects six MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. =Twinnings= Chard is twinned with Helmstedt in Germany (since 12 April 1980), Morangis in France (since 29 May 1994) and also ≈ûeica Mare in Transylvania, Romania. Geography Chard reservoir At an altitude of , Chard is one of the highest towns in Somerset, and is also the southernmost. The suburbs include: Crimchard, Furnham, Glynswood, Henson Park and Old Town. Local folklore claims that the town has a very unusual and unique feature, a stream running along either side of Fore Street. One stream eventually flows into the Bristol Channel and the other reaches the English Channel. This situation changed when the tributary of the Axe was diverted into the Isle; the gutter in Holyrood Street, though, still flows into the River Axe and therefore it is still true it lies on the watershed and that two gutters within the town eventually drain into the Bristol Channel and the English Channel. The Chard Reservoir, around a mile northeast of the town, is a Local Nature Reserve. It is used for dog walking, fishing and birdwatching, with a bird hide having been installed. Species which are seen regularly include grey herons, kingfishers, great cormorants, little grebes, ducks and also a wide range of woodland songbirds. Others include the great white egret, cattle egret, and spotted redshank. Snowdon Hill Quarry is a 0.6 hectare (1.3 acre) geological Site of Special Scientific Interest on the western outskirts. The site shows rock exposures through the Upper Greensand and Chalk, containing fossil crustaceans which are both unique and exceptionally well-preserved making it a key locality for the study of palaeontology in Britain. The unit has been dated to the subdivision of the Chalk known as the Turrilites acutus Zone, named after one of the characteristic fossils, which was laid down in the Middle Cenomanian era between 99.6 ¬± 0.9 MA and 93.5 ¬± 0.8 MA (million years ago). There are also caves in Chard, first recorded in a charter of 1235 as being used by stonemasons, which provided local building stone. The cave is smaller than when it was used as a quarry as part of the roof has fallen in but a cave below ground still exists with the remains of the supporting pillars left when it was being worked. =Climate= Along with the rest of South West England, Chard has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8‚Äì15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west. Economy Textile manufacture was important to the town during the Middle Ages. Chard is the birthplace of powered flight as in 1848 John Stringfellow first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible. Percy and Ernist Petter, who formed Westland Aircraft Works, witnessed some of Stringfellow's demonstrations in Chard and often asked for help in the formation of Westland's first aircraft development factory on the outskirts of Yeovil. AgustaWestland now holds the Henson and Stringfellow lecture yearly for the Royal Aeronautical Society. James Gillingham developed articulated artificial limbs. Chard is a key point on the Taunton Stop Line, a World War II defensive line. Numatic's Henry vacuum cleaner Chard is the home of Numatic International Limited, notable for its 'Henry' vacuum cleaners with the characteristic large smiling face. The company employs over 700 people. In contrast to competitors such as Hoover and Dyson the firm continues to manufacture in Britain. The site occupies an area of more than 10 hectares and operates continuously, producing over 4,000 products per day. One of the other large employers in Chard is Oscar Mayer, which is not to be confused with the American company of the same name owned by Kraft Foods. In 2007, it was announced that the factory would be bought by Icelandic company, the Alfesca Group which owns Lyons seafoods. However this deal fell through and the company announced 250 job losses. Oscar Mayer has historically employed many Portuguese and, more recently, Polish workers. Chard is also home to Brecknell Willis, one of the world's oldest and leading specialists in the design, construction, and installation of railway electrification systems, most notably metro and light rail systems. Its largest customer, London Underground, purchases both train born equipment and infrastructure. Brecknell Willis occupies a site at the bottom of the hill, next to the site of the old LSWR station, which is now a Tesco store. At the time of writing (August 2014) the company was preparing to move into a new purpose-built building from which all of its operations will be based. In early July 2014 the company was bought by WABTEC, bringing it into the Wabtec Rail Group as well as the Falstand Electric Group. Transport Central Station From 1842 Chard was the terminus of the Chard Canal, a tub boat canal that joined the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal at Creech St. Michael. It had four aqueducts, three tunnels and four inclined planes along its length. It took seven years to construct and cost about ¬£140,000 (¬£ in ).Lost canals of England and Wales Ronald Russell page 68 Somerset County Council archives: Canals and Canal Projects . Retrieved 20 June 2007. In the 1860s the town became the terminus of two railway lines. The first was opened in 1863 by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) as a short branch line from their main line. This approached the town from the south. The second and longer line was opened by the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&ER;) in 1866 and ran northwards, close to the route of the canal, to join their main line near . From 1917 they were both operated by one company, but services were mostly advertised as though it was still two separate lines. It was closed to passengers in 1962 and freight traffic was withdrawn a few years later. The LSWR's station (later known as Chard Town) opened in 1860 with a single platform, and the B&ER;'s (variously known as Chard Joint or ) in 1866. For five years LSWR trains continued to call at Chard Town and then reversed to the connecting line and then resumed their forward journey to the Joint station. In 1871 a new platform was opened on the connecting line; this closed to passengers on 1 January 1917 but the town station was the main goods depot for the town until it finally closed on 18 April 1966. Passenger trains ceased to operate to Chard Central on 11 September 1962, and private goods traffic on 3 October 1966. The station building and train shed still stand and are in use by engineering companies. The town's public transport links to Taunton are now provided by First Group's Buses of Somerset. Two routes go between the towns. Route 30 and route 99, which both run hourly during weekdays. There is also a service to Yeovil via Crewkerne provided by South West Coaches Sport Chard has a number of local sport clubs. Chard Town F.C. play football in the Somerset County League, whilst a number of Chard football clubs play in the Perry Street and District League. The Rugby union club, Chard RFC, was formed in 1876. The Club runs 3 Senior sides, with the 1stXV playing currently in South West One (west) achieving promotion to National League 3 South West on 26 April 2014 beating Old Towcestrians in the playoff final. Chard Hockey Club was established in 1907 and it now runs three male and three female sides. There are also facilities for cricket, tennis, bowls, and golf. The Wessex Pool League is also played in a number of Pubs in Chard. Resident Sports Photographer, Peter O'Shea QIS LRPS TMIET, often captures the many sports leagues in and around the Chard area, and has had work published in the Chard and Ilminster News (Newsquest), Sunday Independent Newspaper (Tindle Newspaper Group) and Photographic Magazines. Education The old grammar school The original school building in Fore Street was built in 1583 a private residence for William Symes of Poundisford. In 1671 his youngest son, John, conveyed the property to 12 trustees so that it should be converted into a grammar school ‚Äì according to his father's wish. Avishayes Community Primary School, Manor Court Community Primary School, Tatworth Primary School and The Redstart Primary School all offer primary education, while Holyrood Academy offers secondary education. The school, as of 2019, has 1,276 pupils between the ages of 11 and 18. Religious sites Baptist church The Anglican Church of St Mary the Virgin dates from the late 11th century and was rebuilt in the 15th century. The tower contains eight bells, of which two were made in the 1790s by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family in Cullompton. The three-stage tower has moulded string courses and an angle stair turret in the north-west corner. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. There is a church room, built in 1827. The Baptist Church in Holyrood Street was built in 1842.

It was released in March 1995 as a CD single, limited edition 7‚Äù, and standard 7‚Äù vinyl. The song was written by Tim Wheeler and produced by Owen Morris. Writing and recording The song was written by Tim Wheeler in five minutes on Boxing Day 1994 at Belfast International Airport, and recorded in one take on the following day. The song was recorded on The Verve's equipment, who were nearby recording their A Northern Soul album at the same time. The song lyrics reference martial arts movie star Jackie Chan and the song was used in the advertising and during the bloopers at the end of the American release of Chan's film, Rumble in the Bronx. Additionally, the song's intro is a sample from kung-fu flick Close Encounters of the Spooky Kind, starring Sammo Hung, which was being shown as part of a Channel 4 Kung-Fu film season shown over Christmas of that year. It is Hung's voice that can be heard in the sample. When performed live, \\"Kung Fu\\" traditionally closed the band's sets in a two- minute rendition, but was later moved to an earlier slot in the setlist. On the Nu-Clear Sounds tour, it ran to around 5 minutes, with a DJ filling the song with martial arts and computer game noises. Live versions of the song appear on the Barbie 7‚Äù EP and the Ash album Live at the Wireless. The song appears on 1977, Intergalactic Sonic 7‚Ä≥s, Ash's first greatest hits collection, and the Tokyo Blitz DVD. The song appeared with Ash's earlier single \\"Jack Names the Planets\\" on the film soundtrack of Angus. B-sides The single was backed with two B-sides. The first B-side, \\"Day of the Triffids\\", tells an apocalyptic story of an invasion by aliens, and appears on the Cosmic Debris B-sides collection. It also appears on the US version of Trailer. The second B-side, \\"Luther Ingo's Star Cruiser\\" was written by Wheeler and Mark Hamilton and is infamous for having uncommonly explicit lyrics. This was the B-side of the standard 7\\" vinyl (INFECT 21S) but since it was unsuitable for use in jukeboxes, another version (INFECT 21J) was pressed with \\"Day of the Triffids\\" as the B-side. This version was also released as a numbered limited edition.

In music, Gugwangdae describes a long story that takes about three hours for short and six hours for a long time. It is one of the traditional Korean music that mixes body movements and sings to the accompaniment of buk by gosu. Originally a form of folk entertainment for the lower classes, pansori was embraced by the Korean elite during the 19th century. While public interest in the genre declined in the mid-20th century, today, the South Korean government considers many pansori singers to be \\"living national treasures.\\" In 2003, UNESCO recognized pansori as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. In the late 20th century, the sorrowful \\"Western style\\" of pansori overtook the vigorous \\"Eastern style\\" of pansori, and pansori began being called the \\"sound of han\\". All surviving pansori epics end happily, but contemporary pansori focuses on the trials and tribulations of the characters, commonly without reaching the happy ending because of the contemporary popularity of excerpt performances. The history of pansori in the late 20th century, including the recent canonization of han, has led to great concern in the pansori community.  Etymology  The term pansori is derived from the Korean words pan (Hangul: Ìåê) and sori (Hangul: ÏÜåÎ¶¨), the latter of which means \\"sound.\\" However, pan has multiple meanings, and scholars disagree on which was the intended meaning when the term was coined. One meaning is \\"a situation where many people are gathered.\\" Another meaning is \\"a song composed of varying tones.\\"  History  = Origins: 17th century = Pansori is thought to have originated in the late 17th century during the Joseon Dynasty. The earliest performers of pansori were most likely shamans and street performers, and their audiences were lower-class people. It is unclear where on the Korean peninsula pansori originated, but the Honam region eventually became the site of its development. = Expansion: 18th century = It is believed that pansori was embraced by the upper classes around the mid-18th century. One piece of evidence that supports this belief is that Yu Jin-han, a member of the yangban upper class, recorded the text of Chunhyangga, a famous pansori he saw performed in Honam in 1754, indicating that the elite attended pansori performances by this time. = Golden age: 19th century = The golden age of pansori is considered to be the 19th century, when the genre's popularity increased and its musical techniques became more advanced. During the first half of the 19th century, pansori singers incorporated folk songs into the genre, while using vocal techniques and melodies intended to appeal to the upper class. Purely humorous pansori also became less popular than pansori that combined humorous and tragic elements. Major developments in this period were made by pansori researcher and patron Shin Jae-hyo. He reinterpreted and compiled songs to fit the tastes of the upper class and also trained the first notable female singers, including Jin Chae-seon, who is considered to be the first female master of pansori. = Decline: early 20th century = In the early 20th century, pansori experienced several notable changes. It was more frequently performed indoors and staged similarly to Western operas. It was recorded and sold on vinyl records for the first time. The number of female singers grew rapidly, supported by organizations of kisaeng. And the tragic tone of pansori was intensified, due to the influence of the Japanese occupation of Korea on the Korean public and performers. In attempt to suppress Korean culture, the Japanese government often censored pansori that referred to the monarchy or to Korean nationalism. = Preservation: late 20th century = In addition to Japanese censorship, the rise of cinema and changgeuk, and the turmoil of the Korean War all contributed to pansori's decreasing popularity by the mid-20th century. To help preserve the tradition of pansori, the South Korean government declared it an Intangible Cultural Property in 1964. Additionally, performers of pansori began to be officially recognized as \\"living national treasures.\\" This contributed to a resurgence of interest in the genre beginning in the late 1960s. = Resurgence: 21st century = UNESCO proclaimed the pansori tradition a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on November 7, 2003. The numbers of pansori performers has increased substantially in the 21st century, though the genre has struggled to find wide public appeal, and pansori audiences are composed mostly of older people, scholars or students of traditional music, and the elite. However, pansori fusion music, a trend that began in the 1990s, has continued in the 21st century, with musicians creating combinations including pansori-reggae, pansori-classical music, and pansori-rap.  Pansori repertoire  During the 18th century, 12 song cycles, or madang (Hangul: ÎßàÎãπ), were established as the repertoire of pansori stories. Those stories were compiled in Song Man-jae's Gwanuhi (Hangul: Í¥ÄÏö∞Ìù¨) and Jeong No-sik's Joseon Changgeuksa (Hangul: Ï°∞ÏÑ†Ï∞ΩÍ∑πÏÇ¨). Of the 12 original madang, only five are currently performed. They are as follows. * Chunhyangga * Simcheongga * Heungbuga * Sugungga * Jeokbyeokga Contemporary performances of the madang differ greatly from the originals. Rather than performing an entire madang, which can take up to 10 hours, musicians may only perform certain sections, highlighting the most popular parts of a madang.  Musical style  There are five elements for the musical style of pansori: jo (Ï°∞; Ë™ø); jangdan (Ïû•Îã®; Èï∑Áü≠); buchimsae (Î∂ôÏûÑÏÉà); je (Ï†ú; Âà∂); and vocal production. = Jo = Jo (Ï°∞; Ë™ø; also spelled cho) refers mostly to the melodic framework of a performance. In terms of music in Western culture, it comparable to the mode and key, though jo also includes the vocal timbre and emotions expressed through singing. Types of jos include: chucheonmok (Ï∂îÏ≤úÎ™©; Èû¶ÈüÜ-); Gyemyeonjo (Í≥ÑÎ©¥Ï°∞; ÁïåÈù¢Ë™ø; also called seoreumjo ÏÑúÎ¶ÑÏ°∞, aewonseong Ïï†ÏõêÏÑ±); seokhwaje (ÏÑùÌôîÏ†ú); and seolleongje (ÏÑ§Î†ÅÏ†ú). = Jangdan = Jangdan (Ïû•Îã®; Èï∑Áü≠) is the rhythmic structure used. Jangdan is used to show emotional states corresponding to the narration of the singer. Jangdan is also used with the appearances of certain characters. Some types include: jinyang (ÏßÑÏñë); jungjungmori (Ï§ëÏ§ëÎ™®Î¶¨); jajinmori (ÏûêÏßÑÎ™®Î¶¨); and hwimori (ÌúòÎ™®Î¶¨) = Buchimsae = Buchimse (Î∂ôÏûÑÏÉà) refers to the method in which words in pansori are combined with the melodies. The meaning refers more specifically to combinations of words with irregular rhythms. The word is a combination of two Korean words, buchida (Î∂ôÏù¥Îã§ \\"to combine\\") and sae (ÏÉà \\"appearance, form\\"). The two types of buchimsae are: daemadi daejangdan (ÎåÄÎßàÎîî ÎåÄÏû•Îã®) and eotbuchim (ÏóáÎ∂ôÏûÑ). = Je = Je (Ï†ú; Âà∂) refers to a school of pansori.

He is considered the father of zoology in South Africa having described many species across a wide range of groups in his major work, Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa. Smith was born in Hawick, Roxburghshire. He qualified in medicine at the University of Edinburgh obtaining an M.D. degree in 1819, having joined the Army Medical Services in 1816. South Africa 1820‚Äì1837 left In 1820 he was ordered to the Cape Colony and was sent to Grahamstown to supervise the medical care of European soldiers and soldiers of the Cape Corps. He was appointed the Albany district surgeon in 1822 and started the first free dispensary for indigent patients in South Africa. He led a scientific expedition into the interior and was able to indulge in his interests of natural history and anthropology. On several occasions, he was sent by governors on confidential missions to visit Bantu tribes beyond the frontier, such as his trip to Kaffraria in 1824 when he made copious notes on the customs of the Xhosa tribes. In 1825 the Governor of the Cape Colony, Lord Charles Somerset, nominated Smith as the first Superintendent of the South African Museum of natural history in Cape Town. In 1828 Smith was sent to Namaqualand by Lieutenant-Governor of the Eastern District of the Cape of Good Hope Richard Bourke to report on the Bushmen there. As a result, Smith wrote On the origin and history of the Bushmen in 1831. In the same year of 1831, there were rumours of serious unrest in the east, causing Governor Sir Lowry Cole to send Smith to Natal in January 1832. Here he interviewed Dingaan and reported back to Cole, arousing a great deal of interest in the business world of the Cape. It was mainly his report that caused Britain to annex Port Natal in 1844 and turn it into a Crown colony. Similarly in 1833 the reports of traders from North of the Orange River led to an 18-month-long expedition by Andrew to Basutoland, Kuruman, the headquarters of Mzilikazi and as far north as the Magaliesberg, Charles Davidson Bell going along as expedition artist. Smith returned with two of Mzilikazi's izinDuna who forged an alliance with the Cape Colony on behalf of their chief. Smith's Report of the expedition for exploring Central Africa was published in 1836. Except for two short reports that appeared after his return to Cape Town from the interior in 1836, no detailed account of his travels was ever published. Smith's diary, however, was later edited by Percival R. Kirby and published by the Van Riebeeck Society in 1939‚Äì40 as Nos. 20 and 21 of their first series, under the title The Diary of Dr. Andrew Smith, Director of the 'Expedition for Exploring Central Africa', 1834‚Äì36. (.) Smith met the young geologist Charles Darwin when the second voyage of the Beagle touched at the Cape in May 1836, and showed him slate rock formations. He also gave Darwin some rock samples he had collected the year before. These are now held by the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. Darwin and Smith corresponded about how the large animals in South Africa lived on sparse vegetation, showing that a lack of luxuriant vegetation did not explain the extinction of the giant creatures whose fossils Darwin had found in South America. Darwin frequently mentioned Smith in his writings, and sponsored him to gain membership of the Royal Society in 1857. Britain 1837‚Äì1872 Southern African rock python by Sir Andrew Smith Smith returned to the United Kingdom in January 1837 and shortly afterward started publishing the five volumes making up Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa (1838‚Äì50).

In 1845 he became assistant to Sir James McGrigor, the director-general of the army medical department, becoming Director-General of the Army Medical Services in 1853 when Sir James retired. He was responsible for the organizing of medical services during the Crimean War, amidst serious charges of inefficiency and incompetence from The Times and Florence Nightingale. A commission of inquiry exonerated him and he received honours from universities and learned societies. Ill-health forced his resignation in 1858 when he was created Knight Commander of the Bath.

A midden (also kitchen midden or shell heap) is an old dump for domestic waste which may consist of animal bone, human excrement, botanical material, mollusc shells, sherds, lithics (especially debitage), and other artifacts and ecofacts associated with past human occupation. These features, therefore, provide a useful resource for archaeologists who wish to study the diets and habits of past societies. Middens with damp, anaerobic conditions can even preserve organic remains in deposits as the debris of daily life are tossed on the pile. Each individual toss will contribute a different mix of materials depending upon the activity associated with that particular toss. During the course of deposition sedimentary material is deposited as well. Different mechanisms, from wind and water to animal digs, create a matrix which can also be analysed to provide seasonal and climatic information. In some middens individual dumps of material can be discerned and analysed. Shell middens The Whaleback Shell Midden in Maine resulted from oyster harvesting from 200 BC to 1000 AD. A shell midden or shell mound is an archaeological feature consisting mainly of mollusk shells. The Danish term k√∏kkenm√∏ddinger (plural) was first used by Japetus Steenstrup to describe shell heaps and continues to be used by some researchers. A midden, by definition, contains the debris of human activity, and should not be confused with wind- or tide-created beach mounds. Some shell middens are processing remains: areas where aquatic resources were processed directly after harvest and prior to use or storage in a distant location. Some shell middens are directly associated with villages, as a designated village dump site. In other middens, the material is directly associated with a house in the village. Each household would dump its garbage directly outside the house. In all cases, shell middens are extremely complex and very difficult to excavate fully and exactly. The fact that they contain a detailed record of what food was eaten or processed and many fragments of stone tools and household goods makes them invaluable objects of archaeological study. Shells have a high calcium carbonate content, which tends to make the middens alkaline. This slows the normal rate of decay caused by soil acidity, leaving a relatively high proportion of organic material (food remnants, organic tools, clothing, human remains) available for archaeologists to find. Edward Sylvester Morse conducted one of the first archaeological excavations of shellmounds in Omori, Japan in 1877, which led to the discovery of a style of pottery described as \\"cord-marked\\", translated as \\"J≈çmon\\", which came to be used to refer to the early period of Japanese history when this style of pottery was produced. Shell middens were studied in Denmark in the latter half of the 19th century. The Danish word k√∏kkenm√∏dding (kitchen mound) is now used internationally. The English word \\"midden\\" (waste mound) derives from the same Old Norse word that produced the modern Danish one. =Examples= The Turtle Mound shell midden, in Florida, is the largest on the US East Coast. Shell middens are found in coastal or lakeshore zones all over the world. Consisting mostly of mollusc shells, they are interpreted as being the waste products of meals eaten by nomadic groups or hunting parties. Some are small examples relating to meals had by a handful of individuals, others are many metres in length and width and represent centuries of shell deposition. In Brazil, they are known as sambaquis, having been created over a long period between the 6th millennium BCE and the beginning of European colonisation. European shell middens are primarily found along the Atlantic seaboard and in Denmark and primarily date to the 5th millennium BCE (Erteb√∏lle and Early Funnel Beaker cultures), containing the remains of the earliest Neolithisation process (pottery, cereals and domestic animals). Younger shell middens are found in Latvia (associated with Comb Ware ceramics), Sweden (associated with Pitted Ware ceramics), the Netherlands (associated with Corded Ware ceramics) and Schleswig-Holstein (Late Neolithic and Iron Age). All these are examples where communities practised a mixed farming and hunting/gathering economy. On Canada's west coast, there are shell middens that run for more than along the coast and are several meters deep. The midden in Namu, British Columbia is over deep and spans over 10,000 years of continuous occupation. Shell middens created in coastal regions of Australia by Indigenous Australians exist in Australia today. Middens provide evidence of prior occupation and are generally protected from mining and other developments. One must exercise caution in deciding whether one is examining a midden or a beach mound. There are good examples on the Freycinet Peninsula in Tasmania where wave action currently is combining charcoal from forest fire debris with a mix of shells into masses that storms deposit above high-water mark. Shell mounds near Weipa in far north Queensland that are mostly less than high (although ranging up to high) and a few tens of metres long are claimed to be middens,Bailey, G; Chappell, J.B; Cribb, R (1994) \\"The origin of Anadara shell mounds at Weipa, North Queensland, Australia\\" Archaeology in Oceania. Volume 29 Number 2. pp. 69‚Äì80 but are in fact shell cheniers (beach ridges) re-worked by nest mound- building birds. Some shell middens are regarded as sacred sites, linked to the Dreamtime, such as those of the Anbarra group of the Burarra people of Arnhem Land. Shell mounds are also credited with the creation of tropical hardwood hammocks, one example being the Otter Mound Preserve in Florida, where shell deposits from Calusa natives provided flood free high areas in otherwise large watered areas. There are instances in which shell middens may have doubled as areas of ceremonial construction or ritual significance. The Woodland period Crystal River site provides an example of this phenomenon. Some shell mounds, known as shell rings, are circular or open arcs with a clear central area. Many are known from Japan and the southeastern United States, and at least one from South America. Etymology and usage  The word is of Scandinavian via Middle English derivation (from early Scandinavian; Danish: m√∏dding, Swedish regional: m√∂dding).. =Meaning = It is mainly today used by archaeologists worldwide to describe any kind of feature containing waste products relating to day-to-day human life. They may be convenient, single-use pits created by nomadic groups or long-term, designated dumps used by sedentary communities that accumulate over several generations. =Other uses= The word \\"midden\\" is still in everyday use in Scotland and has come by extension to refer to anything that is a mess, a muddle, or chaos. This use was also taken to Northern Ireland by Scottish plantation settlers. Privy middens, outdoor toilets, used to be common in industrial cities such as Manchester. The word is used by farmers in Britain to describe the place where farm yard manure from cows or other animals is collected. Grants are sometimes available to protect these from rain to avoid runoff and pollution. Squirrel midden, Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska In the animal kingdom, some species establish ground burrows, also known as middens, that are used mostly for food storage. For example, the North American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) usually has one large active midden in each territory with perhaps an inactive or auxiliary midden. A midden may be a regularly used animal toilet area or dunghill, created by many mammals, such as the hyrax, and also serving as a territorial marker. Some animals, including some species of fishes, collect foodstuffs with heavy shells that are hard to remove. They may establish sites where rocks or similar items are available as natural anvils on which the animals habitually break open the shells. These discarded shells may accumulate around the anvils in sizeable middens, sometimes for generations. Commonly such middens are sited where there is a convenient rock that is an unusual resource in the region. Octopus middens are piles of debris that the octopus piles up to conceal the entrance of its den. Octopus middens are commonly made of rocks, shells, and the bones of prey, although they may contain anything the octopus finds that it can move.

This species is relatively small compared with most of the other abalone species from the eastern Pacific, and it has a relatively smooth dark shell. This used to be the most abundant large marine mollusk on the west coast of North America, but now, because of overfishing and the Withering Syndrome, it has much declined in population and the IUCN Red List has classed the black abalone as Critically Endangered.  Taxonomy  Haliotis cracherodii comprises two subspecies: *Haliotis cracherodii californiensis Swainson, 1822 (synonyms: Haliotis bonita Orcutt, 1900; Haliotis californiensis Swainson, 1822) *Haliotis cracherodii cracherodii Leach, 1814 (synonyms: Haliotis expansa Talmadge, 1957; Haliotis holzneri Hemphil, 1907; Haliotis imperforata Dall, 1919; Haliotis lusus Finlay, 1927; Haliotis rosea Orcutt, 1900; Haliotis splendidula Williamson, 1893)  Description  shell of Haliotis cracherodii The coloration is dark brown, dark green, dark blue or almost black.Multi-Agency Rocky Intertidal Network. (February, 2005) ‚Äì via ARKive The silvery interior of the shell shows a pale pinkish and greenish iridescence. The exterior of the shell is smoother than most abalones, or may have low obsolete coarse spiral lirae and lines of growth. The shell is oval, evenly convex, the two sides equally curved. The back of the shell is regularly convex, with little algal growth. The shell is not carinated at the row of holes. The spire is near the margin. The cavity of the spire is minute, concealed or nearly so. The muscle scar is generally not distinct. There are usually five to seven small, open respiratory holes, or pores, along the left side of the shell and the rims of the holes are flush with the rest of the shell. These holes collectively make up what is known as the selenizone which form as the shell grows. The columellar plate is not truncate below, sloping inward, its face concave. The rear of the shell is spiralled, and the mantle, foot and tentacles are black.George Washington Tryon, Manual of Conchology vol. XII, p. 76 and 79; 1890 The interior of the shell is pearly with pink and green iridescence. The black abalone's shell length can reach a maximum of , being typically long. Anatomy of Haliotis cracherodii In the living animal, the tentacles on the epipodium, the mantle, and the foot are black.  Distribution  Black abalones can be found along the Pacific coast of the United States from Mendocino County, California to Cabo San Lucas, Baja California, Mexico.Oliver, A.P.H. (2004). Guide to Seashells of the World. Buffalo: Firefly Books. 23. Prehistoric distribution has been confirmed along much of this range from archaeological recovery at a variety of Pacific coastal Native American sites. For example, Chumash peoples in central California were known to have been harvesting black abalone approximately a millennium earlier in the Morro Bay area. The subspecies Haliotis cracherodii californiensis is found around Guadalupe Island, off Baja California (Mexico).  Ecology  = Habitat = Two black abalone shells in a tide pool at low tide Black abalones cling to rocky surfaces in the low intertidal zone, up to 6 m deep. They can typically be found wedged into crevices, cracks, and holes during low tide. They generally occur in areas of moderate to high surf. Juveniles tend to reside in crevices to reduce their risk of predation, but the larger adults will move out onto rock surfaces. = Life cycle = Life cycle of Haliotis cracherodii Black abalone reach sexual maturity at 3 years and can live 30 years or more. Spawning occurs in spring and early summer; occasionally, a second spawn occurs in the fall. Black abalone are broadcast spawners, and successful spawning requires that individuals be grouped closely together. Larvae are free-swimming for between 5 and 14 days before they settle onto hard substrate, usually near larger individuals, where they then metamorphose into their adult form, develop a shell and settle onto a rock. Juveniles do not tend to disperse great distances, and current populations of black abalone are generally composed of individuals that were spawned locally. Juveniles settle in crevices and remain hidden until they reach approximately 4 inches in length. At that point, adults congregate in more exposed areas such as rocks and in tide pools. They are thought to be able to live for between 25 and 75 years, and will begin to reproduce between three and seven years. = Feeding habits = Black abalones are herbivorous gastropods, and feed mostly on drift algae and kelp. Their primary food species depend on the habitat. In southern California habitats, black abalones are thought to feed on the giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and feather boa kelp (Egregia menziesii), while in central and northern California habitats they feed on the bull kelp (Nereocystis leutkeana). = Interspecific relationships = Predators of this species other than mankind are sea otters (such as the southern sea otter, Enhydra lutris), fish (such as the California sheephead, Semicossyphus pulcher) and invertebrates, including crustaceans such as the striped shore crab, Pachygrapsus crassipes, and spiny lobsters. Competition for space with other species (such as the sea urchins Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) is also frequent.  Human uses  Humans have harvested black abalones along the California Coast for at least 10,000 years. On San Miguel Island, archaeological evidence shows that the Island Chumash people and their ancestors ate black abalone for millennia and also used the shells to make fishhooks, beads, and ornaments. After the Chumash and other California Indians were devastated by European diseases, and sea otters were nearly eradicated from California waters by the historic fur trade, black abalone populations rebounded and attracted an intensive intertidal fishery conducted primarily by Chinese immigrants from the 1850s to about 1900.  Conservation status  Black abalone are listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List as Critically Endangered (CR A4e). On June 23, 1999, the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) designated the black abalone as a candidate for protection under the Endangered Species Act (64 FR 33466).Endangered Species Act (ESA). nmfs.noaa.gov On December 21, 2006, the Center for Biological Diversity submitted a petition to NMFS to list the black abalone.PETITION TO LIST THE BLACK ABALONE (HALIOTIS CHRACHERODII) AS THREATENED OR ENDANGERED UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. Center for Biological Diversity. December 21, 2006 On January 11, 2008, NMFS completed their status review of the species and proposed that it be listed as endangered.VanBlaricom, Glenn et al. (January, 2009) Status Review Report for Black Abalone (Haliotis cracherodii Leach, 1814). National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service Black abalone were listed as endangered on January 14, 2009. The NMFS designated critical habitat for the endangered black abalone on October 27, 2011.NMFS. Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants: Final Rulemaking To Designate Critical Habitat for Black Abalone.Federal Register;; v76, (October 27, 2011), 66805-66844. The state of California has introduced an Abalone Recovery Management Plan to guide conservation efforts.Abalone Recovery Management Plan. dfg.ca.gov Black abalone have dramatically declined in numbers throughout their historical range, and are locally extirpated in certain areas. This decline was initiated by overfishing. Following World War II, the California abalone fishery was not managed for individual species. Therefore, it resulted in a systematic depletion of various abalone species as the fishery over-harvested one species and then moved on to the next in an attempt to meet demand. Black abalone were the last to be targeted, with the peak harvest occurring in the 1970s. Additionally, improved harvesting technologies that expanded the harvesting areas and supported larger harvests per unit effort were not initiated. Now, all abalone fisheries in California are managed by the California Department of Fish and Game, which restricts the size of abalones caught, and the season in which harvesting can take place. In Mexico, there is a total allowable catch limit for black abalones. Even though harvesting black abalone is regulated in California, poaching still occurs. Other threats include coastal development for residential areas, harbours and waste discharges, compounded by commercial and recreational fishing of the black abalone. The depleted stocks of black abalone were further reduced by withering syndrome, first discovered in 1985, when commercial fishermen reported large numbers of empty shells and dying abalones on the shores of several of the Californian Channel Islands (including the islands of Santa Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Rosa, Santa Barbara, San Miguel, and San Clemente). This disease impairs the production of digestive enzymes, effectively starving the abalone to death. Following onset of symptoms, the animal usually quickly dies. In many locations, percentages greater than 90% of individuals have been lost, and in some places, a total loss of the black abalone population occurred. The disease spread from the Channel Islands to the mainland coast in 1992, where it devastated most populations in warmer waters south of Point Conception or in locally warmer waters further north.Bower, S.M.

The film follows the romance between Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack), an average student, and Diane Court (Ione Skye), the class valedictorian, immediately after their graduation from high school. In 2002, Entertainment Weekly ranked Say Anything... as the greatest modern movie romance, and it was ranked number 11 on Entertainment Weekly list of the 50 best high-school movies. Plot Near the end of their senior year of high school, noble underachiever Lloyd Dobler falls for valedictorian Diane Court and plans to ask her out, though they belong to different social groups. Lloyd lives with his sister Constance, a single mother, and has no plans for his future. Diane comes from a sheltered academic upbringing and lives with her doting divorced father Jim, who owns the retirement home where she works. She is due to take up a fellowship in England at the end of the summer. Diane accompanies Lloyd to a party, surprising their classmates. During a dinner at the Court household, where Lloyd fails to impress Diane's family, Jim is informed that he is under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service. Diane takes Lloyd to meet the residents of the retirement home and he teaches her to drive the manual-transmission Ford Tempo her father gave her as a graduation present. Their relationship grows intimate and they have sex, to her father's concern. Lloyd's musician friend Corey, who has never gotten over her cheating ex-boyfriend, Joe, warns him to take care of Diane. Jim urges Diane to break up with Lloyd, feeling he is not an appropriate match, and suggests she give Lloyd a pen as a parting gift. Diane tells Lloyd she wants to stop seeing him and concentrate on her studies, and tells him to take her pen. Devastated, Lloyd seeks advice from Corey, who tells him to \\"be a man\\". Jim's credit cards are declined when he tries to buy Diane a luggage set. At dawn, Lloyd plays \\"In Your Eyes\\" by Peter Gabriel, the song that was playing the first time they slept together, on a boombox under her open bedroom window. The next day, Diane meets with the IRS investigator, who explains that they have evidence suggesting Jim has been embezzling funds from his retirement-home residents. He advises her to accept the fellowship as matters with her father will worsen. After Diane discovers cash concealed at home, Jim tells her he stole the money to give her financial independence, justifying it by saying he provided better care to the victims of his embezzlement than their families did. Distraught, she reconciles with Lloyd at the gym where he trains. Some time later, Jim is incarcerated. Lloyd visits him in a federal penitentiary and tells him that he will go with Diane to England; Jim reacts with anger. Lloyd gives him a letter from Diane saying she cannot forgive him, but she arrives to say goodbye and they embrace. She gives him a pen, asking him to write to her in England. Lloyd escorts Diane, who is afraid of flying, on her flight.

Variety called it a \\"half-baked love story, full of good intentions but uneven in the telling.\\" But, the review also said the film's \\"[a]ppealing tale of an undirected army brat proving himself worthy of the most exceptional girl in high school elicits a few laughs, plenty of smiles and some genuine feeling.\\" In a mixed review, Caryn James of The New York Times wrote: > [The film] resembles a first-rate production of a children's story.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 8.04/10. The website's consensus reads, \\"One of the definitive Generation X movies, Say Anything is equally funny and heartfelt‚Äîand it established John Cusack as an icon for left-of-center types everywhere.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 85% based on reviews from 18 critics, indicating \\"Universal acclaim\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F. Cultural influence The film features one of the most culturally recognizable scenes in American movie history, in which John Cusack holds a boombox above his head outside Diane's bedroom window to let her know that he has not given up on her. Crowe and producer James L. Brooks believed the scene could become a hallmark of the movie, though Crowe found it difficult to film because Cusack felt it was \\"too passive\\". The scene was first scored with Fishbone's \\"Question of Life\\", but after viewing the scene, Crowe opted to replace it with Peter Gabriel's \\"In Your Eyes\\" to better fit the mood that he wished to convey. Gabriel initially turned down Crowe because he confused the film with another film in production at the time, a John Belushi biography called Wired. \\"That scene is like Romeo under the trellis,\\" said Crowe reminiscing about the iconic scene. \\"But I have this feeling when I watch it that it‚Äôs filled with double emotion ‚Äì both with the story and the actors, whose own trepidation bleeds in.\\" TV series A television series based on the movie was planned by NBC and 20th Century Fox, but producers Aaron Kaplan and Justin Adler did not know that Crowe had not approved of the project. When they found out his views, the show was dropped.

A significant number of important Boston educational and cultural institutions were originally located adjacent to (or very near) Copley Square, reflecting 19th-century Boston's aspirations for the location as a center of culture and progress.Douglass Shand-Tucci, The Gods of Copley Square, lecture series, 2009, sponsored by Back Bay Historical/Boston-centric Global Studies and the New England Historical Genealogical Society These included the Museum of Fine Arts, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard Medical School, the New England Museum of Natural History (today's Museum of Science), Trinity Church, the New Old South Church, the Boston Public Library, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Massachusetts Normal Art School (today's Massachusetts College of Art and Design), the Horace Mann School for the Deaf, Boston University, Emerson College, and Northeastern University. Known as Art Square until 1883, Copley Square was originally cut diagonally by Huntington Avenue; it took its present form in 1961 when Huntington Avenue was truncated at the corner of Dartmouth Street, the Square partially paved, and a pyramidal fountain sculpture added. In 1991, after further changes including a new fountain, the new Copley Square Park was dedicated. The nonprofit Friends of Copley Square raises funds for care of the square's plantings, fountain, and monuments. The Boston Marathon foot race has finished at Copley Square since 1986.

This may make it easier to view and interpret as it developed over time. Stylised section drawing Sections Half-sectioning is the usual method whereby one half of a feature is excavated and the remainder left in situ. Large linear features may be sectioned at intervals along their lengths. Sectioning has fallen out of favour in some schools of practice because detail is often missed in section that is important to the phasing of the site. Examples of detail that is revealed poorly \\"in section\\" include gravel or thin cobbled surfaces. The main problem with sections is the arbitrary location of their placement may \\"clip\\" or \\"just miss\\" contexts that reveal a different story form the one interpreted by the archaeologist. For instance thin liner features such as wheel ruts may be sectioned at an oblique angle giving the impression of a wider feature as the eye and brain tends to assume that features revealed in section have been cut at right angles to the orientation the feature was made. Numerous other false readings of sections are possible to the unwary, this is why excavation \\"in plan\\" is now preferred. Sections are used in conjunction with two- dimensional excavation by plan to determine the origin of archaeological remains. For recording purposes sections are normally drawn at a scale of 1:10 or 1:20 with their height related to the site benchmark which in turn is related back to a level fixed at some agreed standard of sea level. Orientation should also be recorded. If the section is instructive a photographic record may also be made. Stratigraphic control Sections may also be employed in excavation in temporary fashion as a form of stratigraphic control so as to ascertain the relationship between two or more contexts which may be better examined by the use of a section. Then once a relationship is established contexts can be removed from site in the reverse order they arrived in accordance with the stratigraphic excavation and the creation of a Harris matrix for the sequence being investigated. It is up to the archaeologist on site to determine the best local on site strategy for excavating deposits, be it \\"in section\\" or \\"in plan\\". In this regard the modern archaeologist uses sectioning as a tool for understanding the site stratigraphically during excavation rather than as an end goal in recording it. These caveats aside sections remain a powerful tool for archaeological investigation. A revival of digging in section with machines has occurred in recent years by a proliferation of limited time constrained development led excavations. Quarter sectioning Representation of a barrow excavated by quadrant Sometimes called digging by quadrant this special case is a procedure for excavating circular features, usually mounds and, barrows, Deposits are excavated from four quarters of the feature, starting with two diagonally opposite quadrants and perhaps ending with the other two. The quadrants are slightly offset, so that the outer balk of one is continuous (in reverse) with the outer face of its opposite, going through the center of the feature. After the recording of the sections, the balks may be removed and the rest of the feature excavated. The advantage of quarter sectioning is it allows a look at two complete cross-sections while still allowing excavation in plan thus allowing a better interpretation of the stratigraphy of the site. The merits of this sectioning and balk creation are disputed.

Mayer Amschel Rothschild (23 February 1744 ‚Äì 19 September 1812; also spelled Anschel), was a German Jewish banker and the founder of the Rothschild banking dynasty. Referred to as a \\"founding father of international finance,\\" Rothschild was ranked seventh on the Forbes magazine list of \\"The Twenty Most Influential Businessmen of All Time\\" in 2005. Early life MayerElon, p.108. The Germanic form \\"Mayer\\" was used from 1802 instead of the original \\"Meyer\\". Amschel Rothschild was born in 1744 in the Judengasse, the Jewish ghetto of Frankfurt am Main, Holy Roman Empire, one of eight children of Amschel Moses Rothschild (d. 1755) and his wife Sch√∂nche Rothschild (n√©e Lechnich, d. 1756).Elon, p.47,55. The ancestry of the Rothschilds can be traced back to 1577 to Izaak Elchanan Rothschild (Isaac (Isaak) Elchanan Bacharach, zum Hahn), whose name is derived from the German zum rothen Schild (with the old spelling \\"th\\"), meaning \\"with the red shield\\", in reference to the house where the family lived for many generations. (At the time, houses were designated by signs with different symbols or colors, not numbers.) The name Rothschild in Yiddish language means Red Coat as in heraldic coat of arms. His grandchildren and descendants took this name as the family name and kept it when they relocated in 1664 to another house in the Judengasse‚Äî' (\\"[house in] the back of the saucepan\\")Elon, pp.41,43‚Äîwhich became the family's home and business location through to the early 19th century. Amschel's father had a business in goods-trading and currency exchange. He was a personal supplier of coins to the Prince of Hesse. The family home above the shop had a front wall wide, where more than 30 people lived at that time. Business career With the help of relatives, Rothschild secured an apprenticeship under Jacob Wolf Oppenheimer, at the banking firm of Simon Wolf Oppenheimer in Hanover, in 1757. The grandson of Samuel Oppenheimer taught Rothschild useful knowledge in foreign trade and currency exchange, before he returned to his brothers' business in Frankfurt in 1763.Elon, p.59. He became a dealer in rare coins and won the patronage of Crown Prince Wilhelm of Hesse (who had also earlier patronised his father), gaining the title of \\"Court Factor\\" in 1769.Elon, p.65. Rothschild's coin business grew to include a number of princely patrons, and then expanded through the provision of banking services to Crown Prince Wilhelm, who became Wilhelm IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel in 1785. Business expanded rapidly following the French Revolution when Rothschild handled payments from Britain for the hire of Hessian mercenaries. By the early years of the 19th century, Rothschild had consolidated his position as principal international banker to Wilhelm IX and began to issue his own international loans, borrowing capital from the Landgrave. In 1806, Napoleon invaded Hesse in response to Wilhelm's support for Prussia. The Landgrave went into exile in the Duchy of Holstein, but Rothschild was able to continue as his banker, investing funds in London. He also profited from importing goods in circumvention of Napoleon's continental blockade.Elon, p.153. Rothschild dynasty In 1798, third-born son Nathan Mayer Rothschild was sent to England to further the family interests in textile importing with ¬£20,000 capital (equivalent of ¬£ million in )‚Äîthe first foreign branch. Nathan became a naturalized citizen in 1804 and established a bank in the City of London. In 1810, Mayer entered into a formal partnership agreement with his three eldest sons. The youngest son Jacob was sent to Paris in 1811, enhancing the family's ability to operate across Europe. This enabled them to profit from the opportunity of financing Wellington's armies in Portugal, requiring the sourcing of large quantities of gold on behalf of the British government. Rothschild died on 19 September 1812 in Frankfurt am Main. He was buried at the old Jewish cemetery in Frankfurt, located next to the Judengasse. His grave still exists. A park was named after him, and also a street (Rothschildallee). In 1817 he was posthumously ennobled by the emperor Francis I of Austria. His descendants furthered the family fortune across Europe‚Äîthe \\"five arrows\\" of banking. Eldest son Amschel Mayer took over the Frankfurt bank and Salomon moved to Vienna. Nathan turned the London branch into one of Europe's most powerful banking institutions (N. M. Rothschild & Sons), Calmann (gentrified to \\"Carl\\") set up a branch in Naples and Jacob (\\"James\\") opened de Rothschild Fr√®res, becoming a giant of finance in Paris.

New institutionalism originated in work by sociologist John Meyer published in 1977. History The study of institutions and their interactions has been a focus of academic research for many years. In the late 19th and early 20th century, social theorists began to systematize this body of literature. One of the most prominent examples of this was the work of German economist and social theorist Max Weber; Weber focused on the organizational structure (i.e. bureaucracy) within society, and the institutionalization created by means of the iron cage which organizational bureaucracies create. In Britain and the United States, the study of political institutions dominated political science until the 1950s. This approach, sometimes called 'old' institutionalism, focused on analyzing the formal institutions of government and the state in comparative perspective. It was followed by a behavioral revolution which brought new perspectives to analyzing politics, such as positivism, rational choice theory, and behavioralism, and the narrow focus on institutions was discarded as the focus moved to analyzing individuals rather than the institutions which surrounded them. New Institutionalism was a reaction to the behavioral revolution. Institutionalism experienced a significant revival in 1977 with an influential paper published by John W. Meyer of Stanford University and his Ph.D. student at the time, Brian Rowan. The revised formulation of institutionalism proposed in this paper prompted a significant shift in the way institutional analysis was conducted. Research that followed became known as \\"new\\" institutionalism, a concept that is generally referred to as \\"neo-institutionalism\\" in academic literature. Another significant reformulation occurred in the early 1980s when Paul DiMaggio and Walter W. Powell consciously revisited Weber's iron cage. The following decade saw an explosion of literature on the topic across many disciplines, including those outside of the social sciences. Examples of the body of work in the decade which followed can be found in DiMaggio and Powell's 1991 anthology in the field of sociology; in economics, the Nobel Prize-winning work of Douglass North is a noted example. Kathleen Thelen and Sven Steinmo contrast New Institutionalism with \\"Old Institutionalism\\", which was overwhelmingly focused on detailed narratives of institutions, with little focus on comparative analyses. Thus, the Old Institutionalism was unhelpful for comparative research and explanatory theory. This \\"Old Institutionalism\\" began to be undermined when scholars increasingly highlighted how the formal rules and administrative structures of institutions were not accurately describing the behavior of actors and policy outcomes. More-recent work has begun to emphasize multiple competing logics, focusing on the more-heterogeneous sources of diversity within fields and the institutional embeddedness of technical considerations. The concept of logic generally refers to broader cultural beliefs and rules that structure cognition and guide decision-making in a field. At the organization level, logic can focus the attention of key decision-makers on a delimited set of issues and solutions, leading to logic- consistent decisions that reinforce extant organizational identities and strategies. In line with the new institutionalism, social rule system theory stresses that particular institutions and their organizational instantiations are deeply embedded in cultural, social, and political environments and that particular structures and practices are often reflections of as well as responses to rules, laws, conventions, paradigms built into the wider environment. Diversity of scholarship Numerous scholarly approaches have been described as being part of New institutionalism. =Normative institutionalism= Much of the introduction of this article relates to a normative view, sometimes seen as the \\"original\\" new institutionalism. Normative institutionalism is a sociological interpretation of institutions and holds that a \\"logic of appropriateness\\" guides the behavior of actors within an institution. It predicts that the norms and formal rules of institutions will shape the actions of those acting within them. According to James March,. the logic of appropriateness means that actions are \\"matched to situations by means of rules organized into identities.\\" Thus normative institutionalism views that much of the behavior of institutional actors is based on the recognized situation that the actors encounter, the identity of the actors in the situation, and the analysis by the actor of the rules that generally govern behavior for that actor in that particular situation. =Rational choice institutionalism= This approach contrasts with normative institutionalism: rather than a series of calculated actions designed to maximize perceived benefit, any given actor within an institution will feel constrained and obligated by the norms and rules of the institution. Rational choice institutionalism draws heavily from rational choice theory but is not identical to it. Proponents argue that political actors' rational choices are constrained (called \\"bounded rationality\\"). These bounds are accepted as individuals realize their goals can be best achieved through institutions. In other words, institutions are systems of rules and inducements to behavior in which individuals attempt to maximize their own benefit. =Historical institutionalism= This version of institutionalism states that \\"history matters\\".. Paths chosen or designed early in the existence of an institution tend to be followed throughout the institution's development. Institutions will have an inherent agenda based on the pattern of development, both informal (the way things are generally done) and formal (laws, rule sets and institutional interaction). A key concept is path dependency: the historical track of a given institution or political entity will result in almost inevitable occurrences. In some institutions, this may be a self-perpetuating cycle: actions of one type beget further actions of this type. This theory does not hold that institutional paths will forever be inevitable. Critical junctures may allow rapid change at a time of great crisis. =Sociological institutionalism= Sociological institutionalism is a form of new institutionalism that concerns \\"the way in which institutions create meaning for individuals, providing important theoretical building blocks for normative institutionalism within political science\\". Some sociological institutionalists argue that institutions have developed to become similar (showing an isomorphism) across organizations even though they evolved in different ways. According to prominent organisational sociologist Richard Scott, \\"Compliance occurs in many circumstances because other types of behavior are inconceivable; routines are followed because they are taken for granted as 'the way we do these things (p. 57) ‚Äîalso called social institutionalism.. Individuals make certain choices or perform certain actions not because they fear punishment or attempt to conform; neither do they do so because an action is appropriate or the individual feels some sort of social obligation. Instead, the cognitive element of new institutionalism suggests that individuals make certain choices because they can conceive of no alternative. =New Institutional Economics= It is an economic perspective that attempts to extend economics by focusing on the institutions (that is to say the social and legal norms and rules) that underlie economic activity and with analysis beyond earlier institutional economics and neoclassical economics. It can be seen as a broadening step to include aspects excluded in neoclassical economics. It rediscovers aspects of classical political economy.

A convergence of such researchers resulted in founding the Society for Institutional & Organizational Economics (formerly the International Society for New Institutional Economics) in 1997. =Discursive institutionalism= Proponents of discursive institutionalism, such as Vivien Schmidt, emphasize how ideas and discourses affect institutional stability and change. =Constructivist institutionalism= Constructivist institutionalists assert that political, social, or policy discourses can perform communicative functions: actors publicly expressing ideas can lead to social change, or coordinating functions. Thus ideas and meaning provide a mechanism for multiple actors to achieve consensus on norms and values and thus create social change.. This is increasingly moving beyond political science and into international relations theory and foreign policy analysis... =Feminist institutionalism= Feminist institutionalism is a new institutionalist approach which looks at \\"how gender norms operate within institutions and how institutional processes construct and maintain gender power dynamics\\".

The zoo first opened in 1898 and by 2011 housed 1258 animals of 164 species and an extensive botanical collection. It is a full institutional member of the Zoo and Aquarium Association (ZAA) and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). History The Perth Zoological Gardens were opened on 17 October 1898 by the Governor of Western Australia, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Gerard Smith. Planning for the zoo had started in 1896 when the Acclimatisation Society first met, the original purpose of which was to introduce European animals to Australia and establish a zoo for conservation purposes. In 1897 this group invited the director of the Melbourne Zoo, Albert Le Souef, to choose a site. His son Ernest was chosen as the first director of the Perth Zoo, and work began in 1897. The first exhibits built included two bear caves, a monkey house, a mammal house and a model castle for guinea pigs. The first animals on display included an orangutan, two monkeys, four ostriches, a pair of lions, and a tiger. At first there were only six staff members. The zoo had 53,000 visitors in its first nine months, and had not been closed for a single day since it was opened, until it was temporarily closed from 24 March 2020 during the coronavirus outbreak. From the start Ernest Le Souef worked to create a botanical collection as well as an animal collection to preserve for the future. Work on the gardens started as soon as the site was chosen and finalised. Since the site was mostly sand and lacked nutrients and water, loads of manure needed to be brought in, and a well was bored in 1898 to allow irrigation. The zoo included rose gardens, lupin fields, tropical plants, and palms. The original palm collection still stands and boasts over 61 species including Canary Island date palms that are now over 110 years old. The zoo also grew crops for animals including lettuce, alfalfa, carrots, lucerne and onions. This tradition is still alive, with the zoo producing fodder including hibiscus, bamboo, Fijian fire plant and mirror plant. In 2010/11, the zoo had a paid staff of about 248 (167 full-time equivalents), plus about 300 volunteer docents. =Governance= *E.A. Le Souef - as director 1897 - 1935 *L.E.

All exhibits are designed to mimic the animals' natural habitats and utilise passive barriers where possible, to improve the wellbeing of the animals. ;Australian Walkabout The Australian Walkabout includes the Australian Wetlands and Penguin Plunge, Reptile Encounter, Australian Bushwalk, aviaries and the Nocturnal House. The Australian Wetlands includes black swan, black-necked stork, brolga, little pied cormorant, blue-billed duck, freckled duck, Australian shelduck, radjah shelduck, Eurasian coot, yellow-billed spoonbill, black-winged stilt, little egret, pied heron, plumed whistling duck, estuarine crocodile, freshwater crocodile, motorbike frog, splendid tree frog, western swamp tortoise. The Penguin Plunge is home to little penguins and bridled terns. The exhibit includes a pool of filtered salt water with underwater viewing, a beach, a reef, and a rookery. The Australia Bushwalk takes visitors on a journey through the Australian landscape where they can see dingoes, emus, koalas, red-legged pademelons, numbats, quokkas, red kangaroos, short-beaked echidnas, southern hairy-nosed wombats, tammar wallabys, Tasmanian devils, and western grey kangaroos. A detour takes visitors to the Western Australian Black Cockatoo exhibit, planted with cockatoo food trees and home to Baudin's cockatoo, Carnaby's cockatoo, Major Mitchell's cockatoo, Muir's corella, red-tailed black cockatoo, and red-capped parrot. Another detour takes visitors to the Numbats Under Threat exhibit, which showcases the endangered Australian numbat along with rufous whistlers. The Nocturnal House is designed in a circular viewing layout that lets visitors circumnavigate the Australian mainland while viewing nocturnal animals under simulated moonlight. Vertebrates in this building include bilby, cane toad, chuditch, dibbler, ghost bat, green tree frog, spinifex hopping mouse, squirrel glider, water rat, southern brown bandicoot, ringtail possum, feathertail glider and brush-tailed bettong. In addition, this exhibit includes some invertebrates, such as Australian tarantulas and scorpion. The Reptile Encounter was opened on World Environment Day in 1997. It contains 17 exhibits designed to match the animal's natural habitat. The building is climate controlled, and displays reptile species from around the world including examples of the black-headed python, dugite, frilled dragon, turtle, olive python, perentie, pygmy python, reticulated python, south-west carpet python, tiger snake, Merten's water monitor, blue-tongued skink, spiny- tailed lizard, and woma. ;African Savannah The African Savannah replaced a variety of barred cages, and was the largest construction project undertaken at the zoo when it was created. The exhibit recreates the African savannah, and includes African painted dogs, African lions, cheetahs, Grant's zebras, hamadryas baboons, meerkats, radiated tortoises, Rothschild's giraffes, spotted hyaenas and southern white rhinoceroses. Visitors view the animals from a path that simulates a dry riverbed running through the savannah. ;Asian Rainforest The Asian Rainforest is home to a number of threatened Asian species. These include Asian elephants, Asian small-clawed otters, red pandas, Javan gibbons, Sumatran orangutans, Sumatran tigers, sun bears, and white- cheeked gibbons. Perth Zoo contributes to the conservation of many of these species in the wild. The zoo's Sumatran orangutan breeding program is the most successful in the world, having bred 27 orangutans since 1970. In 2006 and 2011, zoo-born orangutans were released into the wild in Bukit Tigapuluh National Park in Sumatra as part of an international program to re-establish a wild population of the critically endangered ape. ;Lesser Primates The Lesser Primates exhibit is home to lemurs and monkeys including black-and-white ruffed lemurs, black-capped capuchins, Bolivian squirrel monkeys, common marmosets, cotton-top tamarins, emperor tamarins, pygmy marmosets and ring- tailed lemurs. Staff at Perth Zoo tending to the animals ;Galapagos Tortoises Next to the African Savannah and opposite the Lesser Primates is an exhibit that is home to two Galapagos tortoises. ;Main Lake Near the entrance to the zoo is the Main Lake which has two islands. One is home to a group of black- and-white ruffed lemurs and the other to a family of Javan gibbons. Next to the Main Lake and opposite the cafe are exhibits which are home to the southern cassowary and the Goodfellow's tree kangaroo. It also includes Australian pelicans that move around in the waters. ;Talking Zoo The zoo provides a free online service called Talking Zoo which lets visitors download hours of animal information onto their iPod, MP3 player, mobile phone or PDA. ;Heritage Trail The Heritage Trail (a map of which can be downloaded from the website or collected from the Information Centre) is a self-guided walk that takes visitors around the zoo and shows off its historical buildings. Buildings included in this walk are the bird feed shed, kite cage, bear caves, hay shed, mineral baths from 1898, replicas of tennis shelters from 1903, the Scout Hall built in 1931, the 1947 carousel that is still in use, and the Gate Zoo Residence that was built in the 1960s. ;African Savannah * African painted dog * African lion * Grant's zebra * Hamadryas baboon * Radiated tortoise * Rothschild giraffe * Slender-tailed meerkat * Spotted hyaena * Southern white rhinoceros ;Asian Rainforest * Asian elephant * Nepalese red panda * Asian small-clawed otter * Sumatran orangutan * Sumatran tiger * Sun bear * Northern white-cheeked gibbon ;Australian Bushwalk * Dingo * Emu * Koala * Numbat * Quokka * Red kangaroo * Rufous whistler * Short-beaked echidna * Southern hairy-nosed wombat * Tammar wallaby * Tasmanian devil * Western grey kangaroo ;Cockatoos and Parrots * Baudin's cockatoo * Carnaby's cockatoo * Major Mitchell's cockatoo * Muir's corella * Red-tailed black cockatoo * Red-capped parrot ;Australian Wetlands * Black swan * Black-necked stork * Brolga * Little pied cormorant * Blue-billed duck * Freckled duck * Australian shelduck * Radjah shelduck * Eurasian coot * Yellow-billed spoonbill * Black-winged stilt * Little egret * Pied heron * Plumed whistling duck * Nankeen night heron * Estuarine crocodile * Freshwater crocodile * Motorbike frog * Splendid tree frog * Western swamp tortoise ;Penguin Plunge * Bridled tern * Little penguin ;Main Lake * Black-and-white ruffed lemur * Goodfellow's tree-kangaroo * Southern cassowary * Javan gibbon ;Nocturnal House * Bilby * Cane toad * Chuditch * Dibbler * Ghost bat * Green tree frog * Spinifex hopping mouse * Squirrel glider * Water rat * Western ringtail possum * Southern brown bandicoot * Ringtail possum * Feathertail glider * Brush-tailed bettong ;Reptile Encounter * Black-headed python * Dugite * Frilled dragon * Olive python * Perentie * Pink-eared turtle * Pygmy python * Reticulated python * South-west carpet python * Tiger snake * Merten's water monitor * Western blue-tongued skink * Northern blue-tongued skink * Spiny-tailed lizard * Woma ;Lesser Primates * Black-capped capuchin * Bolivian squirrel monkey * Common marmoset * Cotton-top tamarin * Emperor tamarin * Pygmy marmoset * Ring-tailed lemur * Black-and-white ruffed lemur ;Galapagos Tortoises * Galapagos tortoise ;South American Birds * Amazon parrot * Blue-and-gold macaw * Green-cheeked conure * Nanday conure * Sun conure ;Walk-In Aviary * Blue-winged kookaburra * Channel-billed cuckoo * Eclectus parrot * Emerald dove * Green pygmy goose * Pheasant coucal * Pied imperial pigeon ;Invertebrates in Nocturnal House * Australian tarantula * Scorpion Conservation Asali a Rothschild giraffe leaving Perth Zoo for Monarto Safari Park after being part of the breeding program The zoo participates in a number of breeding programs for endangered species, both indigenous Australian and non-native species. Programs include those of the Rothschild's giraffe and white rhinoceros as well as Sumatran tigers and orangutans resulting in several births. Some Australian species are bred for release into managed habitat in Western Australia, whereas the international species are for increasing genetic diversification in zoo populations. ;Exotic species Since 2006, Perth Zoo has made a significant contribution to conservation projects in the Bukit Tigapuluh National Park and the surrounding forested areas which support a rich diversity of life including a new colony of orangutans. These orangutans are part of an international program to reintroduce rescued ex-pet and orphaned Sumatran orangutans into the wild to establish a new population of this critically endangered species. More than 139 orangutans have been released into the area and some have bred. In November 2006, Perth Zoo released 14-year-old, Perth Zoo-born Sumatran orangutan Temara into Bukit Tigapuluh as part of the reintroduction program. Temara was the first zoo-born orangutan in the world to be released into the wild. This was followed in 2011 with the release of the first male zoo-born orangutan, Semeru, into the wild. Perth Zoo works with the Frankfurt Zoological Society, Indonesian Government and the Australian Orangutan Project on this program and other conservation activities in Bukit Tigapuluh. Perth Zoo contributes to the conservation of threatened species in the wild through its fundraising program, Wildlife Conservation Action. Started in 2007, funds raised have been used for the conservation of Sumatran orangutan, Sumatran tiger, Sumatran elephant, African painted dog, sun bears, tree kangaroos, Javan gibbons and Australian native species. More than $881,000 has been raised since the program began. ;Native species Working with the Department of Environment and Conservation, Perth Zoo breeds threatened Western Australian animal species for release into managed areas of habitat in the wild as part of its Native Species Breeding Program. As of 2011, Perth Zoo breeds numbats, western swamp tortoises, dibblers, woylies and threatened Western Australian frog species. A numbat, one of the many species to benefit from Perth Zoo's involvement. The numbat (Myrmecobius fasciatus) Western Australia's mammal emblem and one of only two diurnal marsupials, the numbat is the only Australian mammal to feed exclusively on termites. Despite the establishment of several populations by the Department of Environment and Conservation, it is still classified as endangered by the IUCN. Perth Zoo has been breeding numbats for release into the wild since 1986. The first successful birth was in 1993. By early 2011, 165 numbats had been provided by the zoo for release into protected habitat. The western swamp tortoise (Pseudemydura umbrina) is a short-necked freshwater turtle and Australia's most critically endangered reptile. The western swamp tortoise has only been recorded at scattered localities in a narrow, three-to-five kilometre strip of the Swan Coastal Plain. Since 1988, Perth Zoo has bred more than 500 western swamp tortoises. The main barrier to the further recovery of the species is the lack of suitable habitat. The dibbler (Paranthechinus apicalis) is a small carnivorous marsupial found on two islands off the coast of Jurien Bay (island dibblers) and on the south coast of Western Australia within the Fitzgerald River National Park (mainland dibblers). It once had a much wider distribution, but is now classified as endangered by the IUCN. Perth-Zoo-bred dibblers were used to establish a new population on Escape Island in Jurien Bay. The focus has now changed to breeding dibblers from Fitzgerald River National Park for release on the mainland. By early 2011, over 500 dibblers had been provided by the zoo for release into protected habitat. The frog breeding program is seeking to increase populations of threatened species, including those listed as vulnerable, Spicospina flammocaerulea, Sunset Frog, and Geocrinia vitellina, Orange-bellied Frog, and the critically endangered Geocrinia alba, the white-bellied frog. Previous breeding programs include: The chuditch (Dasyurus geoffroi) or western quoll, is one of four quoll species in Australia and is the largest marsupial predator in Western Australia. At the time of European settlement, chuditch occurred in approximately 70% of the continent. By the late 1980s, they had become endangered, with less than 6,000 remaining in the south-west of Western Australia. Perth Zoo has bred more than 300 chuditch for release in the last decade. Since the breeding program began, the status of chuditch has been modified from endangered to vulnerable. This breeding program is now complete. Shark Bay mouse (Pseudomys fieldi) also known as djoongari, prior to 1993 the only known population of djoongari was on Bernier Island in the north-west of Western Australia, adjacent to the Shark Bay region and was considered to be one of Australia's most geographically restricted animals. Over 300 Perth-Zoo- bred djoongari have been released to sites on the mainland and on islands in the north-west of Western Australia. This breeding program is now complete. The central rock-rat (Zyzomys pedunculatus) is a critically endangered rodent that was presumed extinct until it was rediscovered in the MacDonnell Ranges Northern Territory in 1996. The last of the zoo's central rock rats were sent to Alice Springs Desert Park in 2007 and the breeding program closed.

He was a critic of traditional views of the interpretation of the Bible, and argued that biblical criticism could be helpful for a theological interpretation of Sacred Scripture. His theological positions brought him into conflict with the church's authorities, including Pope Leo XIII and Pope Pius X. In 1893, he was dismissed as a professor from the Institut Catholique de Paris. His books were condemned by the Roman Curia,Pope, Hugh. \\"The Condemnation of Four Works by Abb√© Loisy,\\" The American Catholic Quarterly Review, Vol. XXIX, 1904. and in 1908 he was excommunicated.Reid, George. \\"Higher Biblical Criticism,\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. 4 (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908). Loisy's most famous observation was that \\"Jesus came proclaiming the Kingdom, and what arrived was the Church\\" (\\"J√©sus annon√ßait le Royaume et c'est l'√âglise qui est venue.\\" L‚ÄôEvangile et l'Eglise).  Education  Born on 28 February 1857 at Ambri√®res, Loisy was put into the ecclesiastical school of Saint-Dizier at four years old. He decided for the priesthood and was educated from 1874 to 1879 at the Grand s√©minaire de Ch√¢lons-en-Champagne; he entered the Institut Catholique de Paris in 1878/1879. Prior to his ordination to the subdiaconate, he had experienced doubts regarding the soundness of the Catholic faith.Boynton, Richard Wilson. \\"The Catholic Career of Alfred Loisy\\", The Harvard Theological Review, Vol. 11, No. 1 (1918), pp. 36-73, Cambridge University Press After an illness he returned to the Institut and was ordained a priest on 29 June 1879. Initially assigned parish work, in 1881 he requested to be reassigned to the Institut to complete his baccalaur√©at in theology. That autumn he became instructor in Hebrew. He took additional courses in Hebrew with Ernest Renan at the Coll√®ge de France. He was also influenced, as to biblical languages and textual criticism, by the Abb√© Paulin Martin, and as to a consciousness of the biblical problems and a sense of form by the historical intuition and irony of Abb√© Louis Duchesne. He took his theological degree in March 1890, by the oral defense of forty Latin scholastic theses and by a French dissertation, Histoire du canon de l'ancien testament, published as his first book in that year. By the time he took a course at Saint-Sulpice in scriptural interpretation, he was already disillusioned with the church's belief in the virgin birth and resurrection.  Early Biblical criticism  Some of his work appeared in the bi-monthly L'Enseignement biblique, a periodical written throughout and published by himself. In November 1893, Loisy published the last lecture of his course, in which he summed up his position on Biblical criticism in five propositions: the Pentateuch was not the work of Moses, the first five chapters of Genesis were not literal history, the New Testament and the Old Testament did not possess equal historical value, there was a development in scriptural doctrine, and Biblical writings were subject to the same limitations as those by other authors of the ancient world. This resulted in Loisy's dismissal from his teaching position. A few days later Pope Leo XIII published the encyclical Providentissimus Deus, which indirectly condemned Abb√© Loisy's and Mgr d'Hulst's position, and rendered the continued publication of consistently critical work so difficult that Loisy himself suppressed his Enseignement at the end of 1893. He was subsequently appointed chaplain to a convent in Neuilly, a post from which he resigned in 1899, to be appointed lecturer at the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes, a secular academic institution. Historical apologetics for the development of the Catholic Church In 1902, he started to pay attention to Adolf von Harnack's Das Wesen des Christentum. Harnack believed that the essence of Christianity was the relationship between individual and God, making an organized church a largely unnecessary creation. Loisy disagreed with the idea that the organized church was unnecessary, but the nature of his disagreement brought him controversy. From 1901 to 1903 he published several works that would be condemned by the church. These include La Religion d'Isra√´l, √âtudes √©vang√©liques, L'√âvangile et L'√âglise, Autour d'un petit livre, and Le quatri√®me √âvangile. His 1908 Les √âvangiles Synoptiques would cause his excommunication. In his works he argued against Harnack, trying to show that it was necessary and inevitable for the Catholic Church to form as it did. In doing so, Loisy implicitly accepted the consistent eschatology of Johannes Weiss: Jesus thought the coming of the Kingdom was imminent, so there was no point in founding a Church. Only after his death and resurrection his original proclamation of the Kingdom was transformed in this sense by his disciples, and legitimately so, as Loisy pointed out against Harnack's conception of Christianity: The second part of the quotation echoes Cardinal Newman's theory on the development of Christian doctrine which Loisy had studied in his time at Neuilly. Although L'√âvangile et L'√âglise in particular was condemned by Cardinal Richard, Pope Leo consistently refused to interfere directly. It was his successor, Pope Pius X who would later condemn these works. Another controversial thesis of Loisy, developed in La Religion d'Isra√´l, is the distinction between a pre-Moses period, when the Hebrews worshipped the god El, also known by the plural of this name, Elohim, and a later stage, when Yahweh gradually became the only deity of the Jews.Loisy, Alfred and Galton, Arthur (2009). The Religion of Israel. BiblioBazaar, pp. 6-7. His assertions on Jesus went further than Newman's and caused more controversy. He argued that Harnack had been partly correct that an organized church was created in a way unrelated to any plans by Jesus. Loisy argued that Jesus lacked a conscious understanding that he was consubstantial with God the Father and therefore Jesus did not know how the Catholic Church would \\"transform\\". Loisy also argued that, since the articulation of ideas on consubstantiality came from the period surrounding the Council of Nicaea, such notions would have been unknown to and unthinkable by Jesus and his first followers, who saw him largely in Jewish messianic terms. Regardless of who Jesus actually was, he could not have claimed to be what the church taught him to be. Pope Pius X Cardinal Sarto became Pope Pius X on 4 August 1903. On 1 October, Loisy published three new books, Autour d'un petit livre, Le Quatri√®me √âvangile and Le Discours sur la Montagne (a fragment of a proposed enlarged commentary on the Synoptic Gospels). Autour consists of seven letters on different topics addressed to church leaders and friends. Reacting on pressure from the Parisian Archbishop Cardinal Richard, Pius X transferred the censuring of Loisy's books, which had already been started under Leo XIII in 1901, from the Congregation of the Index to the Supreme Congregation of the Holy Office. Already on 23 December 1903, Loisy's main exegetical works (Religion d'Isra√´l, L'√âvangile et l'√âglise, √âtudes √©vang√©liques, Autour d'un petit livre and Le Quatri√®me √âvangile) were censured. On 12 January 1904 Loisy wrote to the Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Merry del Val, that he received the condemnation with respect, and condemned whatever might be reprehensible in his books, whilst reserving the rights of his conscience and his opinions as an historian. Since the Holy See was not satisfied, Loisy sent three further declarations to Rome; the last, dispatched on 17 March, was addressed to the pope himself, and remained unanswered. At the end of March Loisy gave up his lectureship, as he declared, on his own initiative. In April 1907 he returned to his native Lorraine, to Ceffonds (near Montier-en-Der), and to his relatives there. Condemnation and excommunication Already in 1904 the Holy Office began to prepare a syllabus of errors contained in the works of Loisy.Claus Arnold, Pius X, Merry del Val and the cases of Alfred Loisy and George Tyrrell. Institutional Aspects of Antimodernism Due to ongoing internal resistance, especially from the Master of the Sacred Palace, the papal theologian Alberto Lepidi OP, this Syllabus was published only in July 1907 as the decree Lamentabili sane exituLamentabili sane exitu (or \\"A Lamentable Departure Indeed\\"), which condemned sixty-five propositions from the field of biblical interpretation and the history of dogma. They concerned the nature of the church, revelation, biblical exegesis, the sacraments, and the divinity of Christ. This was followed by the encyclical Pascendi dominici gregis (or \\"Feeding the Lord's Flock\\"), which characterized modernism as the \\"synthesis of all heresies\\". The documents made Loisy realise that there was no hope for reconciliation of his views with the official doctrine of the church. He made a comparative study of the papal documents to show the condemned propositions in his own writings. He also asserted as true various of his earlier New Testament interpretations, which previously he had formulated in conditional form. In his journal he wrote: His Catholic critics commented that his religious system had as its residue a great society, which he believed to be the continuation of the church of which the past had been so glorious. For many, the attitude of Loisy and his followers was incomprehensible. What troubled modernists was, How can the Church survive?, while for Pius X the question was, How can these men be priests? This did not deter Loisy from publishing three further books. Les √âvangiles synoptiques, two large volumes of 1,009 and 798 pages, appeared in January 1908. This contains a detailed commentary on the Synoptic Gospels, combining the ecclesiastical tradition, modern criticism, the Gospel narrative, and the tradition of the text and the previous commentaries. The commentary gives also a careful translation of the texts. Loisy recognizes two eye-witness documents, as utilized by all three Gospels. He traces a strong Pauline influence, especially in the Gospel of Mark. Yet the great bulk of the sayings remain substantially authentic; if the historicity of certain words and acts is here refused with unusual assurance, that of other sayings and deeds is established with stronger proofs; and the redemptive conception of the Passion and the sacramental interpretation of the Last Supper are found to spring up promptly and legitimately from Christ's work and words. The third book, Simples R√©flexions sur le d√©cret Lamentabili et sur l'encyclique Pascendi, 277 pages, was published from Ceffonds a few days after the commentary. Each proposition of the decree is carefully tracked to its probable source, and is often found to modify the latter's meaning. The study of the encyclical concludes: \\"Time is the great teacher ... we would do wrong to despair either of our civilization or of the Church.\\" The ecclesiastical authorities were not slow to act. On 14 February 1908 Mgr Amette, archbishop of Paris, prohibited his diocesans to read or defend the two books, which \\"attack and deny several fundamental dogmas of Christianity,\\" under pain of excommunication. Loisy was excommunicated vitandus on 7 March 1908.Encyclopedia Americana (Volume 17: 1969), pgs 707-708. Article by Francis J. Hemelt of The Catholic University of America After his excommunication he became a secular intellectual. He was appointed Chair of History of Religions in the Coll√®ge de France in 1909 and served there until retiring in 1931. In that post, he continued to develop his philosophy, describing the Christian religion as a humanist system of ethics rather than divine. He also developed his studies of early religions and their influence on Christianity. He never recanted, and died in 1940 in Ceffonds.

He subsequently entered Buddhist, Chinese, Tibetan, Korean, and Japanese mythology as the king of hell. Maya death god \\"A\\" way as a hunter, Classic period Deities associated with death take many different forms, depending on the specific culture and religion being referenced. Psychopomps, deities of the underworld, and resurrection deities are commonly called death deities in religious texts. The term colloquially refers to deities that either collect or rule over the dead, rather than those deities who determine the time of death. However, all these types are included in this article. Many have incorporated a god of death into their mythology or religion. As death, along with birth, is among the major parts of human life, these deities may often be one of the most important deities of a religion. In some religions in which a single powerful deity is the object of worship, the death deity is an antagonist against whom the primary deity struggles. The related term death worship has most often been used as a derogatory term to accuse certain groups of morally abhorrent practices which set no value on human life. In monotheistic religions, death is commonly personified by an angel or demon instead of a deity. Occurrence In polytheistic religions which have a complex system of deities governing various natural phenomena and aspects of human life, it is common to have a deity who is assigned the function of presiding over death. This deity may actually take the life of humans or, more commonly, simply rule over the afterlife in that particular belief system (a single religion may have separate deities performing both tasks). The deity in question may be good, evil, or neutral and simply doing their job, in sharp contrast to a lot of modern portrayals of death deities as all being inherently evil just because death is feared. Hades from Greek mythology is an especially common target. The inclusion of such a \\"departmental\\" deity of death in a religion's pantheon is not necessarily the same thing as the glorification of death which is commonly condemned by the use of the term \\"death-worship\\" in modern political rhetoric. A death deity has a good chance of being either male or female, unlike some functions that seem to steer towards one gender in particular, such as fertility and earth deities being female and storm deities being male. A single religion/mythology may have death gods of both genders existing at the same time and they may be envisioned as a married couple ruling over the afterlife together, as with the Aztecs, Greeks, and Romans. In monotheistic religions, the one god governs both life and death (as well as everything else). However, in practice this manifests in different rituals and traditions and varies according to a number of factors including geography, politics, traditions, and the influence of other religions.

In the novel The Book Thief, Death is the narrator of the story.The Book Thief#Death Death is the name of one of \\"The Endless\\" in the DC Universe. Death is a recurring character in the Discworld series written by Terry Pratchett. Books featuring Death include Mort, Reaper Man, Soul Music, Hogfather and Thief of Time. He also makes a cameo appearance in Interesting Times. In A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin, the guild of assassins known as the Faceless Men believe that all death deities are simply different incarnations of the same god, known to them as the Many-Faced God or Him of Many Faces, while the Faith of the Seven worships The Stranger as one of Seven Aspects of God representing Death and the Unknown. In the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, especially The Silmarillion, N√†mo AKA Lord Mandos is the Doomsman of the Valar, Judge of the Dead and Lord of the Halls of Mandos (where Elves await reincarnation and humans retreat before making the Journey into the Beyond). In the CW TV show Supernatural, Death makes a crucial appearance. He is portrayed as existing alongside God since the beginning of time and being so ancient he cannot remember when he came into existence; he may even be older than God. In the show he is the oldest and most powerful of the Four Horsemen (Death, Famine, War and Pestilence). He is not portrayed as a villain. In the Sailor Moon franchise, the last Sailor Guardian (of the Sol System) introduced is Sailor Saturn. Her powers revolve around destruction, ruin, and death and she can be thought of as a \\"god\\" of sorts (all Sailor Guardians can). Her weapon is the Silence Glaive that is capable of utterly obliterating and destroying entire worlds/planets if used to its maximum potential. In the Marvel Comics Universe, the personification of death is Mistress Death. The Transformers mythos features the character of Mortilus, a Cybertronian deity who represents death and who later betrayed his brethren and was destroyed, leading to the longevity of the Transformer race. A similar character is The Fallen, a member of the Thirteen Primes who is identified as the guardian of entropy. In the manga and anime, Death Note, gods of death (shinigami) exist in their own realm and are owners of Death Notes, which are used to kill humans. When a note falls into the human world, the person who touches it first becomes the new owner of the note, can recognize the god of death to whom it belongs, and the god follows them for the rest of their life. However, shinigami are more like Grim Reapers with freakish appearances than deities who are worshiped. This is because shinigami are a fairly recent concept in Japanese folklore directly inspired by the European figure of the Grim Reaper, and thus, aren't \\"true\\" death gods. Despite their Western origin, many people will refer to both the Death Note characters and the folklorical shinigami using the Japanese name instead of the English translation or even \\"Grim Reaper\\". For similar cases of shinigami being more akin to Grim Reapers in anime, see Bleach (anime) and Soul Eater (anime). In the first campaign of the roleplaying adventure podcast The Adventure Zone, the character Kravitz is a bounty hunter who apprehends people disrupting the natural order of life and death. He even remarks on being called the Grim Reaper by some societies. While Kravitz starts out as a minor antagonist in the story, he returns as an ally to the heroes. Kravitz is gay and the romantic love interest of Taako, one of the main protagonists.

Niulakita has a population of 34 (2017 Census). The residents of Niulakita have moved to the island from Niutao. Niulakita is represented in the Parliament of Tuvalu by the members of the constituency of Niutao. Geographical features Niulakita is a reef island. There are four ponds or lakes and the village has a maneapa (a community hall) in Tuvalu, which provides meeting and recreational functions as well. The isle has an oval outline, with the longer axis running east‚Äìwest (about 1 km long). This island features highest point of Tuvalu ( above sea level). A fringing reef surrounds the whole island, which makes local fishing and transport into and out of the island difficult. Historical background The discovery of Niulakita is claimed by travellers from Nui, led by Kaunatu who was taking people home to Vaitupu, however their canoe drifted off course to the south and they arrived at Niulakita. There was only saltbrush (Atriplex) and pukavai trees (Pisonia grandis) on the islands. Kaeula, one of the passengers, died and was buried with the last of their coconuts planted at the head of his grave. The island was named by Kaunatu after a place of that name on Nui. The first sighting recorded by Europeans of Niulakita was on 29 August 1595 by the Spanish navigator Alvaro de Menda√±a during his second expedition encountered Niulakita. The island was charted as La Solitaria (Lonesome in Spanish).Maude, Islands and Men: Studies in Pacific History, Melbourne: Oxford University Press (1986) p.307Keith S.

In 1821 Captain George Barrett, of the Nantucket whaler Independence II, visited Niulakita, which he named Rocky (Group). This name was never much used, but Independence Island, after Barrett's ship, was one of the several names which came into general use for Niulakita during the 19th century. Niulakita was also known as Sophia. In about 1879 the elders of Vaitupu were interested in Niulakita and send a working party to plant coconuts on the island. However, in 1880 they were informed that J. C. Godeffroy und Sohn of Hamburg (operating out of Samoa) claimed ownership of the island. Notwithstanding this claim in 1884 the Vaitupu elders transferred their claim to Niulakita to H. M. Ruge and Company, a German trading firm that operated from Apia, for $400 in part payment of a debt of $13,000 to Ruge & Co. Ruge & Co became insolvent in about 1888. On 15 April 1889 Niulakita was sold for $1,000 to Mr H. J. Moors, an American citizen living in Apia, Samoa. On 16 September 1896 Captain Gibson R.N., of HMS Curacoa, recorded in his journal that six men and six women, natives of various islands, were living on Niulakita working for Moors. Captain Gibson determined that the island was not under American protection so he hoisted the Union Jack and delivered the flag, with a copy of the Declaration of British Protectorate, to the headman of the working party. In August 1896, the sailing ship Seladon of Stavanger was wrecked on the coral reef of Starbuck Island. The crew of 16 men were in the lifeboats with little food and water for 30 days, until they arrived at Niulakita. The crew were stranded for ten months until rescued by a passing steam ship. It was bought by the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony administration in 1944. The administration gave people from Vaitupu permission to settle Niulakita. However, in 1949 a later administration decided to have Niulakita settled by the community from Niutao, which was considered to be overpopulated. The removal of the Vaitupuans was controversial. The United States asserted a claim to Niulakita under the Guano Islands Act of 1856; this claim was renounced under the 1983 treaty of friendship between Tuvalu and the United States. Education Niulakita's junior school is Lotoalofa Primary School.

The latter has been a kingdom on two occasions. The first time was after it declared independence in 1912. History  The Albanian Congress of Trieste of 1913 discussed the question of the future prince and several candidates came through: Baron Franz Nopcsa von Fels≈ë-Szilv√°s, Marchese D'Auletta (claiming descendance from Skanderbeg) with the support of the Arbereshe delegates and Italy, Prince Albert Ghica from Romania supported by the Albanian colony there, and Aladro Kastriota. Under the independence settlement imposed by the Great Powers, the country was styled a principality, and its ruler, William of Wied (), was titled prince. However, these styles were only used outside the country. In Albanian, William was referred to as , meaning king. This was because many local nobles already had the title of prince (, , or in various Albanian dialects), and because domestically the Albanian sovereign could not be seen as holding a title inferior to that of the king of Montenegro. Prince William's full style was: \\"By the grace of the powers and the will of the people the prince of Albania\\". William was forced into exile by internal disorder just after the outbreak of World War I, and Albania was to be occupied by various foreign powers for most of the war. In the confusing aftermath of the war, some of the several regimes competing for power officially styled themselves as regencies for William. Albania's first monarchy ended definitively when the restored central government declared the country a republic in 1924. Four years later, on September 1, 1928, President Ahmed Bey Zogu proclaimed himself \\"king of the Albanians\\" ( in Albanian). Zog sought to establish a constitutional monarchy. Under the royal constitution, the Albanian king, like the king of the Belgians, had to swear an oath before parliament before entering into his royal powers. The text of the oath was as follows: Zog's kingdom came to be tied more and more closely to Victor Emmanuel III's Italy, until the latter occupied it on April 7, 1939. Zog fled the country, and five days later, the Albanian Parliament proclaimed Victor Emmanuel as the new king. He took Zog's title king and formally retained until he abdicated as Albanian monarch in 1943. Zog I was then reinstated as king (though he never returned to Albania), serving until the socialist People's Republic of Albania was established in 1946. During and after World War II, some Albanians worked for the return of King Zog; however, they were not successful. Neither Zog nor Victor Emmanuel had his Albanian royal title widely acknowledged by the international community. The constitution of the Albanian Kingdom specified that, were the king to flee during war, he would abdicate any claims to the throne, including those of his descendants. Zog's son, the late Crown Prince Leka (1939‚Äì2011), was the main pretender to the Albanian Crown.

There are two major publicly traded transcontinental freight railway systems, Canadian National and Canadian Pacific. Nationwide passenger services are provided by the federal crown corporation Via Rail. Three Canadian cities have commuter train services: in the Montreal area by R√©seau de transport m√©tropolitain, in the Toronto area by GO Transit, and in the Vancouver area by West Coast Express. These cities and several others are also served by light rail or metro systems. Only one (Toronto) has an extensive streetcar (tram) system. Smaller railways such as Ontario Northland Railway and Algoma Central Railway also run passenger trains to remote rural areas. The Rocky Mountaineer and Royal Canadian Pacific provide luxury rail tours for viewing scenery in the Canadian Rockies as well as other mountainous areas of British Columbia and Alberta. Canada has total trackage, of which only is electrified (almost exclusively part of urban rail transit networks). Canada uses (standard gauge) track for the majority of its railway system. The exceptions to this are small lines isolated from the main North American rail network used in resource industries such as mining or forestry, some of which are narrow gauge, and the streetcar and heavy-rail subway lines of the Toronto Transit Commission which use a broad gauge of . History A Canadian Pacific Railway freight eastbound over the Stoney Creek Bridge in Rogers Pass. The first Canadian railway, the Champlain and Saint Lawrence Railroad, was opened in 1836 outside of Montreal.Cinq-Mars, Francois. \\"L'avenement du premier chemin de fer au Canada.\\" (1986, Editions Mille Roche). () Heavy expansion of the rail system did not get under way until the Guarantee Act of 1849 that guaranteed bond returns on all railways over . This led to rapid expansion of railways in the Canadas, sometimes excessive growth as uneconomic lines were built since the government guaranteed profits. This proved disastrous for government finances, however, and the Canadas were all but bankrupted by the subsidies. The largest rail project of this period was also a disaster. The Grand Trunk Railway linking Montreal to Sarnia was finished in 1860, but was vastly mired in debt. In exchange for bailing out the company the government escaped its guarantee on the railway bonds. Canadian confederation was made possible in part by the railways. The separate colonial governments had all but emptied their treasuries building railways, and a new and more stable method of financing them was required. It was also believed that union would allow for the needed construction of railways linking British North America. The Maritimes joined only because of promises to build the Intercolonial Railway, and British Columbia only because of a promise to build a transcontinental railway. The government had learned its lesson, and these railways were not funded by guarantees. Rather, the construction of the Intercolonial was fully controlled by the government under the skilled direction of Sir Sanford Fleming. The railway to the Pacific, the Canadian Pacific, was financed by private funds and through massive land grants in the Canadian prairies (much of it of little value until the railway arrived), $25 million in cash and a guaranteed monopoly. The railway, an engineering marvel that was then the longest in the world, was completed in 1885 to great fanfare. The booming Canadian economy after 1900 led to plans to build two new transcontinental railways. The Canadian Northern, a successful system covering the northern part of the prairies, and the Grand Trunk (through its Grand Trunk Pacific subsidiary) both launched ambitious plans to expand. The government at first encouraged the two to come to some arrangement and build only one new network, but in the end no agreement was made and the government supported the expansion of both systems. The federal government itself built the National Transcontinental, a line from Moncton, New Brunswick, through Quebec City to Winnipeg, passing through the vast and uninhabited hinterland of the Canadian Shield. This aggressive expansion proved disastrous when immigration and supplies of capital all but disappeared with the outbreak of the First World War. The Canadian Northern, Grand Trunk Pacific, and Grand Trunk were nationalized by the federal government, which absorbed the debt of over two billion dollars. All three railways, along with the Canadian Government Railways (formed by the Intercolonial, National Transcontinental, and several smaller lines) were then merged into the Canadian National Railways between 1918 and 1923. The years after the First World War saw only moderate expansion of the rail network and the age of the great railways were over in Canada. The automobile provided strong competition by the 1920s, and after the Second World War most passengers were lost to automobiles and airlines. During the post-war period several large resource lines were opened in Quebec, Labrador, and British Columbia ‚Äì several of which are not directly connected to the main North American network. In 1978 the government created Via Rail which took over all national passenger service in the country. In 1987 the National Transportation Act partially deregulated the railway industry in Canada and removed much of the red tape that railways experienced when attempting to abandon unprofitable lines; however, the NTA is now viewed as more of a failure in that railways used the legislation merely as a first-resort after \\"demarketing\\" a line, rather than a last-resort after trying to find a short line buyer. In November 1995 the federal government privatized CN, and in 1996, the government corrected the NTA 1987 shortfalls with the Canadian Transportation Act which more fully deregulates the railway industry. Legislation to which railways are subject in Canada While the federal government legislates, and regulates through such bodies as Transport Canada, the railways, various provinces have their own legislation, and indeed if the railway is contained exclusively within the province, are governed by it unless the federal government declares it of importance to the entire country. The Railway Association of Canada, a lobby group, provides helpful lists of legislation,laws affecting railcan.ca members regulation,regulations affecting railcan.ca members orders,orders affecting railcan.ca members and circularscirculars affecting railcan.ca members on its website.

It was established in 1888 at Stafford House on East Street in Tonbridge, where it remained for eight years before moving to its present location on Brook Street, in the south of the town. Founded by the Skinners Company, it was named after 16th century merchant Sir Andrew Judde, whose endowment helped fund the school. The Skinners' Company maintains close links with the school and makes up the majority of the governing body. There are 1019 students in the school aged 11 to 18; the lower school is all boys, but of 350 students aged 16‚Äì18 in the sixth form, up to 60 are girls. The first headmaster was William Bryant, who oversaw the transition to the present site before his retirement in 1908. The current headmaster as of 2017 is Jon Wood, who replaced the previous headmaster, Robert Masters, at the start of the September 2017 year. Judd pupils generally take ten General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) tests in Year Eleven (aged 15‚Äì16), and they have a choice of four or five A-levels in the sixth form. An Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted) inspection in 2007 graded The Judd School as \\"outstanding\\", and league tables published by the Daily Telegraph based on 2013 A-level results rank Judd as the second best (or best, if independent schools are excluded) school in Kent. In 2013, The Sunday Times newspaper ranked The Judd School as the 12th best state secondary school (for pupils aged 11‚Äì16, with an optional two further years of education in sixth form) in the country. The majority of students go on to higher education following the completion of their A-levels at the end of Year Thirteen (aged 17‚Äì18), and in 2017, over one in five (38) Year 13 students gained an Oxbridge offer. In September 2004, the school was designated a music and mathematics specialist school, which means it receives additional funding for those subjects. In 2007, the school was invited to become a High Performing Specialist School, and in April 2008 was successful in attaining science specialism status. As mathematics is automatically included under a science specialism, the school selected English to be included under the first specialism. The Judd School is now a music with English, science and mathematics specialist school. History =Early years: 1888‚Äì1918= alt=A red bricked building with a spired roof, windows and a black gate The Judd School was established in 1888, but the need for a secondary school to supplement Sir Andrew Judd's Grammar School, a private school (now called Tonbridge School) was acknowledged as early as 1870. It was revealed that only one in 200 of its students was the son of a Tonbridge tradesman, as was required in its endowment.Taylor (1988), p. 3 Tonbridge School was founded in 1553 by Sir Andrew Judd, who made a fortune in the Muscovy fur trade during the 16th century.Veale (1988), pp. 188‚Äì189 His endowment was left in the hands of the Skinners Company, who agreed to fund the establishment of a commercial school in Tonbridge in 1875.Taylor (1988), p. 4Somervell (1847), p. 14 However, the Charity Commissioners ‚Äì empowered by the 1869 Endowed Schools Act to govern the establishment of charitably funded schools ‚Äì directed that the ¬£20,000 provided by The Skinners' Company for this cause be taken to neighbouring Tunbridge Wells, where it was used to establish The Skinners' School in September 1887.Rivington, p. 224Neve (1933), p. 309 Demand persisted for a similar school in Tonbridge; in July 1888, William J. D. Bryant, previously an assistant master at Tonbridge School,Wadmore (1902), p. 245 was named headmaster of Sir Andrew Judd's Commercial School,Taylor (1988), p. 10 which opened on 17 September at Stafford House in East Street, Tonbridge. The funds were provided by a loan of ¬£13,000 repaid over the next 20 years with income from the Judd Foundation (of which The Skinners' Company were trustees), which rapidly increased when the leases on the Sandhills Estate in London were renewed in 1906.Taylor (1988), p. 19 The school also benefited from at least ¬£500 per year from the Judd Foundation, after funding for Tonbridge School was reduced.Rivington, p. 225 Although established on a tentative basis, the school's early success led to its move to a larger, purpose-built site in south Tonbridge in 1896. William Bryant retired as headmaster in 1908 and was replaced by John Evans, appointed in preference to the 217 other applicants for the post.Taylor (1988), p. 41 Previously headmaster of Ashford Grammar School, Evans took up his new position at the conclusion of the autumn term. He oversaw a period of change and modernisation, including the transition from gas to electric lighting, and the introduction of a house system in 1909.Taylor (1988), p. 56Taylor (1988), p. 58 Soon after the outbreak of the First World War the school was requisitioned by the War Office to house two brigades, from Folkestone and Aldershot.Taylor (1988), pp. 76‚Äì77 In 1917, the school Cadet Corps was established, which within one month consisted of 120 students.Taylor (1988), p. 80 The following year, and according to Taylor (1988) \\"much to the Headmaster's distaste\\",Taylor (1988), p. 82 the first female teachers were appointed after the deaths of several male members of staff. =Inter-war years: 1919‚Äì1939= In June 1919, soon after the passage of Education Act 1918, the school successfully applied for grant-earning status and became partly state-funded. As a consequence, it became necessary to introduce a composite governing board (including public representatives) and to offer free places, equal to 25 percent of the normal number of admissions.Taylor (1988), pp. 56‚Äì57 In 1925, the school saw its first students enter the Oxbridge universities and changed its name to simply The Judd School.Taylor (1988), p. 43 Evans retired in 1928 and was replaced by Welshman Cecil Lloyd Morgan who beat 164 other applicants to a job which carried an annual salary of ¬£650.Taylor (1988), p. 61Chapman (1977), p. 111 He oversaw a change in the curriculum such that each form was divided into two streams, of which one took Latin, the other more vocational subjects.Taylor (1988), p. 68 Morgan continued as many of the Judd customs as long as he could, including the tradition of donating ¬£20 per year to send a Barnardo boy to Australia or Canada.Taylor (1988), p. 71 =Second World War: 1939‚Äì1945= The outbreak of the Second World War on 1939 delayed the commencement of the Autumn Term until trenches could be dug at the school. To avoid the bombing raids, 369 students of the Westminster City School in London were evacuated to The Judd School in the relative safety of Tonbridge.Taylor (1988), p. 85Taylor (1988), p. 83 Initially, each school used the facilities three days per week, but Taylor (1988) notes that \\"imaginative timetables\\" enabled all Judd pupils to attend five days a week by the end of 1941.Taylor (1988), pp. 83‚Äì85 The Westminster boys were instructed to further evacuate to Exmouth, Devon in July 1944, but ended up fleeing back to London.Taylor (1988), p. 86 In a bombing raid that same year a rocket shell exploded in a neighbouring field, destroying more than 200 panes of glass and numerous doors and windows.Taylor (1988), p. 88 By the end of the war, 60 former pupils had lost their lives, and 48 were decorated.Taylor (1988), p. 89 On 1944, The Judd School became the first in the country to be awarded the status of a voluntarily aided grammar school in new legislation brought in by the Butler Education Act, which meant it received state funding, but could continue to select pupils by ability.Taylor (1988), p. 93Taylor (1988), p. 97 =Post-war years: 1945‚Äì1986= alt=A detached red bricked building, with two chimneys, behind a green hedge and a tree to the left. Francis Hillier Taylor, previously senior history master at The Skinners' School, was appointed as Morgan's successor at the end of the spring term in 1946, a position that attracted 321 applications. During his tenure, Taylor significantly expanded the school facilities: in 1948, the headmaster's living quarters were converted to include a secretaries office, waiting room and medical inspection room (the headmaster moved to neighbouring Brook House, which was purchased by The Skinners' Company). In 1955, new geography rooms were constructed, followed three years later by a new gymnasium. Although not first used until two years later, a swimming pool was constructed in 1964 at the cost of ¬£9,000.Taylor (1988), pp. 111‚Äì113 Taylor also introduced some major curriculum changes, including the introduction of new subjects such as rural biology and zoology.Taylor (1988), p. 99 Denis Rendall took over in 1970,Taylor (1988), p. 118 at a time when the future of the school was under threat from the Circular 10/65, which proposed the abolition of grammar schools, which select pupils according to their academic ability, in favour of the comprehensive schools, which are non-selective state funded schools.Taylor (1988), p. 123 He oversaw the building of the new art and crafts department building, currently the R.E. block, which opened in May 1974, and the purchase of a neighbouring detached house, 10 Brook Street, by the Kent Education Committee. Known as \\"Lawton's\\", this building is now used by music department, and contains a suite of computers, and also houses a changing room for female pupils.Taylor (1988), p. 124 Rendall experienced a high turnover of staff: 31 teachers were at the school in the year of his arrival, and 43 joined and left the school between 1970 and 1986. He increased the number of female staff from zero to seven during his tenure,Taylor (1988), p. 125 and the student body grew from 463 to 746 during these years. =Recent years: 1986‚Äìpresent= Rendall was succeeded in 1986 by Keith Starling, who further developed and expanded the school to celebrate its centenary;Taylor (1988), p. 135 the ¬£2 million Cohen Building was constructed in 1991, followed by a ¬£1.4 million music centre in 1995. Other developments include the Library Building, built in 2002, and a new sports hall in 2003; much of the construction funds was raised by parents. More recent developments include the Atwell building - which houses Maths and Geography - and the Ashton building - which houses the school's new canteen as well as four Biology laboratories. After Starling's retirement in 2004, Robert Masters was appointed as his replacement and oversaw the school's transition to music and maths specialist status in 2004. Following an \\"outstanding\\" result in a 2007 Ofsted inspection, the school was invited to become a High Performing Specialist School and in April 2008 was successful in attaining science specialism status. As mathematics is automatically included under a science specialism, the school selected English to join music under the first specialism. Mr Masters also organised the building of the school's all-weather pitch, which was completed in 2006. Governance alt=A four-storey, white bricked building, with two black doors. A flag pole is protruding from the centre of the building. The Judd School foundation document, which was approved by Queen Victoria on 1889,Wadmore (1902), p.244 stipulated that the Board of Governors had right of appointment and dismissal of the headmaster, who has the same powers over the rest of the staff.Taylor (1988), pp. 141‚Äì142 Major decisions were made by The Skinners' Company, but its powers were restricted by the Charity Commissioners, who were granted considerable powers under the Endowed Schools Act. Soon after the First World War, in the wake of the Education Act 1918, the Burnham Scale of teachers salaries came into force and the school was forced to enter into negotiations with the Kent Education Committee to meet the increased expenditure; the Court of The Skinners' Company approved the school becoming grant earning in June 1919. It became necessary to appoint a composite governing body, a third of them public representatives nominated by the Kent Education Committee, who also had some control over school affairs. Subsequently, a fee of one guinea was paid to those who attended meetings of the governing body, the first of which was held on 4 February 1920, at Skinners' Hall in London.Neve (1933), p. 311 After applying for voluntary aided status, the school was required to adopt new Articles of Government on , 1944. It became the first school in the country to be awarded the dual control of state funding and limited independence. The Kent Education Committee funded free dinners for some pupils, travel and maintenance grants and created a common entrance exam. The current governing body consists of a chair and vice chair, ten foundation governors (elected by the Worshipful Company of Skinners), three parent governors, two Local Education Authority (LEA) governors, three staff governors, an education officer and clerk, education assistant, assistant clerk and the headmaster. School structure alt=An L-shaped, red bricked building with a white bell tower. A tree is to the left of the photo. The majority of the school's first pupils joined from Gordon House, which was a successful private school on Hadlow Road run by ; after it was decided that the two schools should not compete, Grice was appointed deputy headmaster of The Judd School.Neve (1933), pp. 309‚Äì310 On the opening day, 40 boys were in attendance, rising to 50 by the end of the first term and to 115 in 1902.Taylor (1988), p. 7Neve (1933), p. 310 In 1917, the school had 244 pupils, which increased to 308 over the next 11 years, and reached 376 in 1935.Taylor (1988), p. 39 In 1952, 380 boys were on the roll, which included 42 sixth form students. Under Denis Rendall, the school experienced a strong growth in numbers; in 1970, there were 463 pupils, increasing to 689 in 1978, and to 742 in 1986. At the last Ofsted inspection in 2007, The Judd School had 933 students. According to the school, as of 2010 the student body is made up of 935 students: 625 in the lower school and 310 in the sixth form, including about 60 girls. Many students come from affluent backgrounds and very few require free school meals; the number of students with disabilities, learning difficulties and special educational needs is well below the national average. The majority of students go on to higher education at the end of Year Thirteen. The house system was first established in 1909, when there were three houses: Alpha, Beta and Gamma, each of which had a house master and captain. Boys remained in the same house for their entire school career, and would be joined by any siblings. Every year, the houses competed for the House Shield; points were awarded for all forms of competitions, from sword dancing to vaulting. In 1914, house colours were introduced; purple for Alpha, green for Beta, and scarlet for Gamma. As the student body increased, a fourth houseDeltawas formed in 1917, for which the colour was yellow. The house system was abolished in the 1980s, but re- introduced in September 2008, with houses named after notable alumni. The four houses were: Duke (after Neville Duke), Hodge (after Donald Hodge), Lewin (after Terence Lewin) and Powell (after Cecil Frank Powell). The house system was changed in 2017, due to a large increase in pupil numbers. There are currently six houses, named after previous headmasters (excluding Robert Masters, the seventh headmaster); Morgan, Starling, Rendall, Byrant, Taylor, Evans. =Lower school= In its early years, boys entered the school mainly from local elementary (now known as primary) schools from ages eight onwards;Taylor (1988), p. 31 at that time, the maximum age of a pupil was 16, although any boy who reached this age during the course of a term was permitted to remain until the end of that term.Taylor (1988), p. 142 In 1908, a government inspection noted that the average pupil remained at the school for three and a half years and left the school between the ages of 14 and 15, and that 20 percent of the intake held scholarships.Taylor (1988), p. 35 The lower school as it is today was first established by the \\"Five Year Plan\\" following a government inspection in 1933. In 1944, following the Butler Education Act, entrance to the school was gained through a common entrance exam, aged 11 or 12; five boys offered themselves for each place, and most came from local primary schools. Prior to the establishment of the sixth form, The Judd School passed several boys to Tonbridge School, or other grammar schools, to complete their education to the age of 18 or 19; ¬£20 was paid as a leaving scholarship. As of 2010, the lower school has an annual intake of around 125 boys at the beginning of Year Seven (aged 11). The lower school (Years 7‚Äì11) is 625 students (all boys) strong, for whom the school uniform consists of a navy blazer accompanied with the school badge on the breast pocket, with grey trousers and a grey or white shirt. Socks must be dark, and shoes must be black. Shirts must be worn with a tie, which varies according to the house in which the student is placed; green for Powell, blue for Lewin, purple for Hodge and red for Duke. =Sixth form= The Judd School sixth can be said to have been established as early as 1903in the wake of the Education Act of 1902when the Pupil Teachers Scheme was born and The Judd School was used a training centre for young teachers.Taylor (1988), p. 33 However, normal pupils above the age of 16 were not permitted until 1919; previously special permission from the governors was required to stay on beyond this age.Taylor (1988), p. 57 A 1952 government inspection stated that 42 students were in the sixth form.Taylor (1988), p. 100 Judd's sixth form has significantly grown over the last decade, consisting of 308 students at the last Ofsted inspection in 2007. A minimum of 40 offers per year will be made to external applicants; girls are admitted in Year Twelve (aged 16) and make up about 16 percent of the sixth form. The sixth form has its own Common Room in the main school building, including a dedicated cafeteria and study area. Boys may wear a dark grey or black suit, plain black, grey or navy V-neck sweater and a scarf of a plain colour. Girls may wear plain tailored suits (skirt or trousers) in black, navy or dark grey. Shirts may be plain grey, blue or white. There is a sixth form house tie available, although girls may choose to wear a pin badge instead. =Staff= In July 1904, The Judd School participated in the Pupil Teachers Scheme on an experimental basis.Taylor (1988), p. 147 Established in the 1902 Education Act, students would receive a normal secondary education, before receiving two years training, splitting their time between a Pupil Teachers Centre and practical experience at elementary and secondary schools. The experiment was dropped soon after the First World War. When the school became grant earning in 1919, the additional funds meant teachers received pensions under the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act 1918. In 1970, 31 staff taught 463 boys; 45 taught 745 in 1988. According to the 2009 school prospectus, there are 71 teaching staff, 20 visiting music staff and 36 additional support, administration and maintenance staff. Admission alt=A gated entrance lined with trees leads to a red bricked building with white windows and a dark roof. The Judd School opened as a day school for local pupils living with their parents, between the ages of 8 and 16. According to the foundation document, the conditions of entry were possession of a \\"good character\\" and \\"sufficient health\\"; sons of freemen of The Skinners' Company were given preference when the number of applicants exceeded the places available.Stammers (1988), p. 32 During his tenure, William Bryant attempted to extend admission to boarders and estimated the costs to be ¬£50 per term (including fees), but the Board of Governors rejected the idea.Taylor (1988), p. 27 However, when a lack of public transport made day-to-day travel to the school impractical, boys were permitted to lodge from neighbouring villages and would stay at masters' homes or at hostels approved by the governors. Entry to the school was conditional upon a pupil passing an entrance exam, which would vary according to the age of the boy. However, the foundation document stipulated that every boy had to be able read, write from dictation and perform sums in the \\"first four simple rules of Arithmetic, with the multiplication table\\".Taylor (1988), p. 143 In 1944, The Butler Education Act confirmed The Judd School as a grammar school, at which time it applied for voluntarily aided status, which required it to abolish fees under the principle of universal free education. The school was required to offer entrance via an entrance examination, now known as the 11-plus, which pupils take aged 10 or 11, depending on their date of birth. Provision was made for pupils to enter aged 13 or 14, for those that had failed the test two years earlier. While defining the school-leaving age as 15, the act granted the government the power to raise the age to 16 \\"as soon as the Minister is satisfied that it has become practicable\\", which happened in 1973.Education Act 1944, Section 35 Admission continues to be via the Eleven Plus examination; The Judd School complies with the Co-ordinated Admission Scheme which is administered by the Kent Local Authority. All pupils must have gained a selective place through the Eleven Plus and placed The Judd School as a preference on their application form. Because the school is usually over- subscribed, priority is given to students in Local Authority Care in the first instance. Students are then ranked according to their aggregate scores in the Eleven Plus, and the distance from a students home to the school (as the crow flies) is used as a tiebreaker. Pupils are also admitted to the sixth form aged 16 or 17, for which similar criteria is applied. External students must have at least five predicted A* GCSEs and will be given conditional offers based on how high their predicted grades are. In the event of over- subscription, priority will be given to internal applicants, followed by external applicants in Local Authority Care. Students are then ranked according to their predicted or actual GCSE results, and the distance to school is again used as a tiebreaker. Should entrance be refused for any reason, parents have a statutory right of appeal, which is heard by the governors of the school. In 2007, the school was ordered to pay compensation to two pupils after it was deemed that they did not receive fair appeals because of what the Local Government Ombudsman deemed \\"inappropriate links\\" between the appeals panel and the governors. =Fees= The foundation document stipulated that fees were to be fixed by the governors and could range from ¬£4‚Äì8 per year; in 1888, the fees charged were ¬£7/10s per year. Provision was made for the allocation of scholarships to the value of the tuition fees for one in every ten boys in the school; one-half of the scholarships were arranged by the governors and awarded only to boys who had spent three years education in a public elementary school.Wadmore (1902), p. 246 Around the turn of the 20th century, an attempt was made to attract younger boys into the school by reducing fees for those under the age of 12 from ¬£2/20s to ¬£2 per term.Taylor (1988), p. 28 In July 1919, the school applied for grant-earning status, and as a result 25 percent of the places became free. As part of this change, the fee structure was changed to ¬£3/10s per term, or ten guineas per annum. In 1944, in accordance with the Butler Education Act, fees were abolished under the principle of universal free education. Parents are encouraged to contribute to The Judd School Development Fund, which raises money for future construction projects. The school continues to be state-funded and thus charges no fees. Curriculum The first prospectus promised \\"religious instruction in accordance with the principles of the Christian Faith\\" and the following subjects: reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, history, English (grammar, composition, and literature), Latin, at least one other foreign European language, mathematics, book-keeping, natural science, drawing, drill, and vocal music. It also said that instruction may also be given \\"in the use of tools for working in wood\\", for which a carpentry shed was placed in the yard of Stafford House.Taylor (1988), p. 16 At the turn of the 20th century, 15 subjects were taught and lessons lasted one hour; school began at nine, and the day included 15 minutes of hymns, prayers and roll calls.Taylor (1988), p. 25 German was first introduced into the curriculum in 1931, the same time at which the school began to offer voluntary after-school art classes.Taylor (1988), p. 67 F. H. Taylor attempted to achieve equilibrium in the curriculum between arts and science subjects; he made woodwork and art continuous for an entire term and introduced a geography course for the Higher School Certificate. In 1948 rural biology was added to the curriculum for the first time, for which the headmaster provided a plot of land to be used as a vegetable plot. At the end of that year, an after-school study period was introduced; following the seven normal periods (five in the morning, two in the afternoon), students were to either begin their homework, or attend a school society. However, the 1950s saw a definite swing towards maths and science, and a subsequent increase in staffing in those departments. In 1957, zoology and botany was taught at A-level for the first time, and physics and chemistry replaced rural biology at O-level (now replaced by the GCSE).Taylor (1988), p. 101 As of 2010, the school follows the National Curriculum in Years 7‚Äì11 and offers a broad range of GCSEs (national exams taken by students aged 14‚Äì16) and A-levels (national exams taken by pupils aged 16‚Äì18). The school has no affiliation with a particular religious denomination, but religious education is given throughout the school, and boys may opt to take the subject as part of their GCSE course. Although morning assemblies take place and are Christian in nature, they are non-denominational. Students participate in a number of educational visits and excursions throughout their school career and Year Eleven students participate in a nine-day work experience programme. The curriculum comprises English and Drama, Mathematics, French, Latin, History, Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Art, Music, Design Technology, Religious Education, Physical Education (P.E.) and Games and Personal, Social and Health Education (P.S.H.E.). In the second year German is added and in Mathematics, students are divided based on their ability. The use of Information Technology is central to all teaching and is taught as a discrete subject in Years 7 and 8. Boys usually take ten subjects for GCSE, English (Language and Literature), Mathematics, a foreign language, all three separate sciences or Dual Certificate Science, supplemented by three other subjects from those listed above. In the sixth form, pupils study five AS-level (the equivalent of half an A-level qualification) subjects for one year, which may include General Studies and usually continue with three or four subjects to A-level. A wide choice of subjects is offered at A-level: English, French, German, Latin, Classical Civilisation, Art, Design and Technology, Music, Geography, History, Economics, Government and Politics, Business Studies, Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Religious Studies and P.E. Most combinations of subjects can be accommodated. All students participate in a games activity on a Wednesday afternoon. The school year runs from September to July, split across three terms: the autumn term (September to December), spring term (January to April) and the summer term (April to July). Students receive two weeks off for Christmas and Easter, a six-week summer break, and three \\"half term\\" breaks. =Examination= Until the establishment of the General Certificate of Education, exams were set once a year by an external examiner(s) appointed by the governors, who reported in writing on the general proficiency of pupils, as well as the condition of the school. A 1902 report by examiner Dr. Wormell found that the curriculum was \\"sufficient to help those few capable of rising to something higher by providing a bridge between elementary school and grammar school\\". He criticised the absence of German tuition and the fact that more than half the students came \\"feebly taught from country districts\\". The headmaster would also submit a written report to the governors. In 1951, the school adopted the General Certificate of Education, but students were barred from taking any exams before the age of 16, which meant that many students left school without any qualifications because of the sheer necessity of leaving school to contribute to household income. The system became more rational in time, but often pupils were taking O-levels and A-levels simultaneously. As of 2010, the school offers GCSEs to students in the lower school, and AS/A-levels to students in the sixth form. Under Rendall, exam pass rates at A-level increased from 67.5 percent in 1970, peaking at 95 percent in 1984 before decreasing slightly to 92 percent in 1987. O-level/GCSE results have similarly improved, reaching a peak of 88 percent pass rate in 1978.Taylor (1988), p. 126 League tables published by the BBC based on 2008 A-level results rank Judd as the fourth best school in Kent. According to the BBC, in 2009 A-level students achieved an average of 999.2 QCDA points, against a national average of 739.1 and 100 percent of students achieved five or more grade C results (or equivalent) at GCSE, including Maths and English. In its 2010 league table of the 500 best state secondary schools in the United Kingdom, The Sunday Times ranked The Judd School 27th. Extra- curricular activities School clubs and societies include various language clubs, sport clubs, musical activities, politics and debating societies, a Voluntary Service Unit, Young Enterprise and many others. Some clubs include classics club, Greek club, chess club, cipher club, geography club, scrabble club, Chinese culture club, puzzle club, philosophy club, board games club, French film club, squash club and homework club. Students may also participate in the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme. Now defunct school societies have included a Young Farmers Club, Jazz Society, Science Society, Stamp Club, Literary and Debating Society, and the League of Nations Union.Taylor (1988), pp. 103‚Äì104Taylor (1988), p. 73 Extra-curricular musical opportunities include: Choir, Junior Singers, Chamber Choir, Judd Brass, Big Bands, String Orchestra, Concert Band, Symphony Orchestra and Junior Orchestra; students give up to 40 concerts per year. Instrumental lessons are available through the school, for which a charge is made. Organised drama at the school began at the latest in 1929, with performances including Richard II and Julius Caesar.Taylor (1988), p. 70 Despite the minimum of theatrical equipment, Taylor (1988) notes that \\"much has been achieved\\" and at times the headmaster himself took a leading role.Taylor (1988), p. 132Taylor (1988), p. 105 The school cadet corps, a national program now known as the Combined Cadet Force, was formed towards the end of 1917 and 120 cadets were recruited within a month. The governors provided ¬£25 towards their initial expenses, and volunteers contributed haversacks, water bottles, dummy rifles and trips to summer camp. Training initially took place on the Tonbridge School rifle range. By 1952, the number of volunteer cadets had fallen to 90. During the 1970s, numbers averaged about 150 cadets.Taylor (1988), p. 133 The school's Combined Cadet Force currently comprises both an Army and a Royal Air Force Section with a total establishment strength of 120 cadets, who meet on Friday afternoons following a full school day. Membership remains voluntary, and boys can join from Year Nine (aged 13‚Äì14). =Sport= alt=A grass playing field with buildings and tennis courts in the background At lower school level, there are regular games for \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" teams in most sports, so that many of the students have the chance to represent the school; in Year Seven there are occasionally \\"C\\", \\"D\\", \\"E\\" and \\"F\\" rugby matches. A programme of inter-house competitions, caters for those who are not school team players. The main games are rugby football, cross-country, and basketball during the winter months; and cricket, tennis and athletics during the summer term. The school features on a national scale in its 4 main sports (rugby, cross country, cricket and athletics)The Judd School Sport and in 2017 was ranked the 2nd best state schools for sport by the Schools Sports Magazine.Top state sports schools 2017' The school adopted the rugby code of football in 1923, at which time it was played on soccer pitches; the first games against other schools were played during the 1925‚Äì26 season, and rugby was played by all students by 1927.Taylor (1988), p. 51 The school reached the quarterfinals of the premier national schools rugby competition, the NatWest Schools Cup, in 2017 and 2018. As of 2010, \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" rugby teams play against local grammar schools. The most important fixture in the Judd sporting calendar is the annual match against The Skinners' School. Boys are often rewarded for their efforts with international tours and rugby sevens is also played at the school. In the 2008‚Äì09 season the under-15 rugby team advanced to the final of the national schools Daily Mail Cup at Twickenham on 2009 but lost 11‚Äì34 to Millfield. Football had been played at the school since its foundation and in 1908, despite the inadequacy of the school's pitches, was the primary winter game. However, by 1925 rugby was the predominant winter sport, and three years later soccer balls were banned from the school. Burgess (2000) notes that The Judd School has a \\"fine reputation for its cricket teams\\",Burgess (2000), p. 42 and as the primary summer game, the sport remains popular today. The Judd School offers cricket academies from Year Eight (aged 12‚Äì13) onwards, with training available all year round. In recent years Judd has found success in County Cup competitions at all age groups. In both cross country and athletics Judd competes nationally and internationally, winning competitions such as the National Schools' Cup in both sports at junior and intermediate level. The school has won 6 of 10, and the King Henry VIII relays in Coventry.Judd School Cross Country In 2004, the school's cross country team became the first school in a decade to end the dominance of public schools Winchester College and St Albans School at the Knole run in Sevenoaks. The school cross country squad has an annual training camp in Lanzarote in December, which acts as both a reward for effort and a valuable warm-weather training camp in preparation for January's Knole Run. The school holds weekly matches against local schools. School teams compete in other sports such as basketball, tennis and hockey. Property =Stafford House= Upon its foundation, whenaccording to Green (1990)it was said to be a \\"temporary expedient\\", the school was based at Stafford House, in East Street in the centre of Tonbridge.Green (1990), p. 22 Previously used by private tutor Isaac Fleming in 1878, it was a building whose central urban position was, Taylor (1988) said, a \\"major asset, and possibly the only one\\"; Headmaster Bryant \\"bore its numerous shortcomings, its bricked ambience and grasslessness\\". Positioned in a narrow street and originally designed for 20 boarders, traffic noise, awkward arrangement and low pitch of the classrooms and the distance of the school from its playing fields made the building far from ideal. It underwent repairs and alterations to the value of ¬£300, carried out by a local builder; several partition walls were knocked down to form larger rooms, although this still restricted the bench length in even the widest of the rooms to , and 18 pupils.Taylor (1988), p. 15 The floor of the main schoolroom was restored and lavatory closets and urinals were installed. Later, a carpentry shed was placed in the yard, and a \\"Mr Russell\\" was appointed as its first occupant in October 1889. \\"Mr Beeching's field\\" was usedat what Taylor (1988) considered \\"an extortionate sum\\"for games, but it was unavailable for four months of the year when it was used to grow hay. Beeching ended this arrangement in April 1889, at which time the school used the YMCA field, for ¬£20 per year. In June of that year, a shed to house cricket equipment was constructed at the cost of ¬£13/10s. It was soon decided that there was a need for more \\"wholesome\\" surroundings, and it was generally accepted that south Tonbridge would be more suitable for the development of a new school. =Brook Street site= After Bloodshotts field (the current location of Tonbridge Grammar School) was rejected as an inferior site, \\"Mr Deacon's Field\\" in Haysden Lane (now Brook Street) was acquired from Sir Edmund Hardinge's trustees for ¬£240 per acre, a total of ¬£2,059.Taylor (1988), p. 23 At one point owned by Sir Andrew Judd, the site consisted of of land, which according to Taylor (1988) sloped \\"gently from the road to the rear of the site\\".Taylor (1988), p. 20Boorman & Maskell (1969), p. 82 Plans, by Campbell Jones, were submitted to the headmaster in July 1883; they included a covered playground, red-bricked buildings incorporating local sandstone, Broseley roof tiles and a small basement housing a boiler. The construction was carried out by Messrs Turners of Watford, and total construction costs were ¬£8,637.Burgess (2000), p. 36 Nearly two years later, on 27 April 1895, the Foundation Stone was laid, at which time Lewis Boyd Sebastian, Master of The Skinners' Company performed a small ceremony. Opened in March 1896, the building featured an oak Neo-Georgian fleche surmounting an Oregon pine hammer-beamed roof. The principal entrance was carved by Messrs Lornie of London and featured shields bearing the coat of arms of Sir Andrew Judd and the company, the only architectural flourish allowed by the low budget. In addition to the \\"schoolroom\\", which was larger than the Town Public Hall, the building consisted of a dining hall (cum gymnasium), the masters common room to the east and a block of six classrooms to the west. The headmaster's house was completed at the same time as the main school building, and had five bedrooms wired with electric bells, and a bathroom plumbed with hot and cold water. In November 1920, an organ was built at a cost of over ¬£1,000, and placed in the schoolroom as a memorial to the old boys and masters who died in the First World War. A new gymnasium was constructed after a 1956 survey deemed its predecessor economically irreparable. Accompanied by the construction of three hard tennis courts, it was opened by Sir Benjamin Brodie in 1958, but lacked adjoining changing rooms, washing facilities and office facilities for members of the physical education staff.Taylor (1988), pp. 112‚Äì113 alt=Through a wired fence, there is a grass playing field and a cricket pavilion to the right. Now known as \\"Lawton's\\", 10 Brook Street was purchased during the early 1970s using funds provided by the Kent Education Committee, after whose chairman the building is now named. A ¬£2 million classroom and technology building (the \\"Cohen Building\\"), together with two new science laboratories, was opened in 1991. A new music centre, financed by voluntary donations, was opened in 1995 and a schoolroom annexe followed in 1997. The most recent developments are a library/classroom building in 2002, a new sports hall in 2003 and an all-weather pitch in 2006. The Atwell Building, formerly known as the \\"Maths-Geography Block\\", opened in 2009 after suffering delays after the original building contractor went out of business. There has been a new school building constructed, providing four new Biology labs and a new canteen to expand on the outdated old canteen in the main school building. After delays, it was completed in Easter 2017, entitled the \\"Ashton Building\\", and is currently in use. There are new pitches at Vizards that were officially completed in January 2017. There are several grass pitches as well as one of the largest 3G pitches in the UK. The school grounds have sufficient space for two rugby pitches and training grids in the winter months, or a running track, and a cricket ground (with nets) for summer. There are also two asphalt tennis courts, an all weather pitch and an air rifle range used by the school's Combined Cadet Force. =Yeoman's fields= The \\"Yeoman's fields\\" site was purchased after a government inspection in 1933 recommended the school seek more land. The site consists of of level, dry land that requires little conditioning, making it ideal for the full-sized rugby pitches, which came into regular use in 1935. Previously part of meadlow land termed the \\"Townlands\\", it was purchased by the Kent Education Committee from the Town Wardens and soon equipped with hedges, lavatories and a pavilion. In 1939, trenches were dug in the field in preparation for the Second World War. On 26 April 2016, it was revealed that the \\"Yeoman's fields\\" site had been sold to help fund a new set of playing fields, which are situated near Lower Haysden Lane at the \\"Vizards\\" site. The new playing fields will tackle the issue of increasing student numbers and provide four rugby pitches, a cricket square and artificial strip and car parking in the 26 acres of land. This has caused some controversy in the Tonbridge community as the proposed development will be situated in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.  Notable former pupils  Former pupils notable for their military careers are: Neville Duke, a World War Two fighter pilot; Donald Hodge, one of the last surviving veterans of the First World War; and Terence Lewin, former Chief of the Defence Staff and Admiral of the Fleet. Sportsmen alumni include: professional rugby player Martin Purdy; former captain of the Kent County Cricket Club David Fulton; athlete Steven Fennell; and swimmer Xander Alari-Williams. Other notable former students are: Cecil Frank Powell, winner of a Nobel Prize in physics;Taylor (1988), p. 115 Humphrey Burton, former head of BBC Music; composer David Moule-Evans;Who Was Who (OUP), online entry (2007) Royal portrait painter Bernard Hailstone;Taylor (1988), p. 91 Ronald Ralph Williams, former Bishop of Leicester; and Guy Hands, chief executive officer of Terra Firma Capital Partners. Tom Greatrex MP and Shadow Scotland Office Minister, who represented the constituency of Rutherglen & Hamilton West, attended Judd between 1986 and 1993.

A group undertaking such an effort is labeled as purging itself. Purges can be either nonviolent or violent; with the former often resolved by the simple removal of those who have been purged from office, and the latter often resolved by the imprisonment, exile, or murder of those who have been purged. Characteristics The Shanghai massacre of 1927 and the Night of the Long Knives of 1934, in which the leader of a political party turned against and killed a particular section or group within the party, are commonly called \\"purges\\" while mass expulsions on grounds of racism and xenophobia, such as that of the Crimean Tatars and the Japanese-American internment are not. Though sudden and violent purges are notable, most purges do not involve immediate execution or imprisonment, for example the periodic massive purges of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia on grounds of apathy or dereliction, or the purge of Jews and political dissenters from the German Civil Service in 1933‚Äì1934. Chairman Mao Zedong and his associates purged much of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership, including the head of state, President Liu Shaoqi and the then-Secretary-General, Deng Xiaoping, beginning in 1966 as part of the Cultural Revolution. In Maoist states, sentences usually involved hard labor in laogai camps and executions. Deng Xiaoping acquired a reputation for returning to power after having been purged several times. Historical use of the term =English Civil War purge, 1648‚Äì1650= The earliest use of the term dates back to the English Civil War's Pride's Purge. In 1648‚Äì1650, the moderate members of the English Long Parliament were purged by the army. Parliament would suffer subsequent purges under the Commonwealth including the purge of the entire House of Lords. Counter-revolutionaries such as royalists were purged as well as more radical revolutionaries such as the Levellers. After the Restoration, obstinate republicans were purged while some fled to New England. =Stalinist Soviet Union= The term \\"purge\\" is often associated with Stalinism. While leading the USSR, Joseph Stalin imprisoned in Gulag- labor camps and executed, i.e. purged, kulaks, many military officers, ethnic minorities, and \\"wreckers\\", or citizens accused of plotting against Communism. Stalin together with Nikolai Yezhov initiated the most notorious of the CPSU purges, the Great Purge, during the 1930s. =France after WWII= After France's liberation by the Allies in 1944, the Free French and particularly the French Resistance carried out purges of former collaborationists, the so- called \\"vichystes\\". The process became known in legal terms as √©puration l√©gale (\\"legal purging\\"). Similar processes in other countries and on other occasions included denazification and decommunization. =Communist Cuba= After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Fidel Castro of Cuba often purged those who had previously been involved with the Batista regime. Purges often involved the execution of the condemned. Castro periodically carried out party purges thereafter. One prominent purge was carried out in 1989, when a high- ranking general named Arnaldo Ochoa was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on charges of drug trafficking. Purges became less common in Cuba during the 1990s and 2000s. In the 21st century = China = Some observers consider the anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping to be a purge. A far-reaching campaign against corruption began in China following the conclusion of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012. The campaign, carried out under the aegis of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, was the largest organized anti- graft effort in the history of Communist rule in China. =North Korea= North Korean leaders Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Jong-un have each periodically purged their political rivals or perceived threats, beginning in the 1950s. The most senior Kim purged those who opposed his son's succession to the supreme leadership of North Korea. Kim Il-sung's most prominent purge occurred during the \\"August Incident\\" in 1956, when the pro-Soviet and pro- Chinese Yanan factions of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) attempted to depose Kim. Most of those involved in the plot were executed while some others fled to the USSR and China. While some purges were carried out under Kim Jong- il, they were not as common as they were under his father/son. Kim Jong-un purged a number of high-ranking officials and generals installed by his father Kim Jong-il in the former's first years in power, including, most prominently, his uncle Jang Sung-taek. =Turkey= After the failed 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt, the government of Turkey began a purge against members of its own civil service and the Turkish Armed Forces. The purge ostensibly focused mainly on public servants and soldiers alleged to be part of the G√ºlen movement, the group the government blamed for the coup. As part of the purge, about 50,000 officials, including thousands of judges, were dismissed and detained.

Lenzing's economy is partly based on tourism, but the town is much more known as an industrial site; it is the world headquarters of Lenzing AG, which is the world leader in the production of cellulose-based fiber such as viscose and Lyocell. , it manufactures one-fifth of the world's cellulose fiber.  Lenzing Concentration Camp  In November 1944, the first transport of 500 women from Auschwitz came to Lenzing to work in the newly opened local subcamp of Mauthausen concentration camp which was located in the Lenzinger suburb of Pettighofen. Eventually 600 female prisoners, mainly Jewish women came to Lenzing from Auschwitz, and a few others came from Ravensbr√ºck and the main camp at Mauthausen. The SS staff in the small subcamp included mainly SS men as well as a small contingent of SS women. Frau Schmidt served in her capacities as Lagerf√ºhrerin, or female commandant. Her main boss was Mauthausen commandant Franz Ziereis who commanded all of the subcamps in Austria. Later Margarete Freinberger became an Oberaufseherin in the camp under Schmidt. Only one other female overseer is known today, Maria Kunik. Attitudes by the former guards was reported as arrogant and brutal, but not as horrible as in Mauthausen proper. The prisoners in the Lenzing camp worked for the Lenzing AG company making artificial wool. Many women in fact died from the work, and others perished in the Mauthausen gas chambers when they could no longer work. In the winter of January 1945, a group of prisoners were severely injured when a train carrying supplies to the camp derailed. The SS sent them, along with any other prisoners who could no longer work to Mauthausen where they were gassed. The women \\"cried and wailed all the way to the main camp.\\" In May 1945 the American Army neared the Lenzing camp. The SS staff fled after Lagerf√ºhrerin Schmidt gave a speech to the surviving women as to not \\"dishonor them\\". On 5 May 1945 the US Army liberated 565 women from the Lenzing subcamp.

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill, is a 2004 book by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Suskind. The book was the first to provide critical insight into the events that led up to the Iraq War. The Price of Loyalty was met with both commercial and critical success, and was the first book by Suskind to be a #1 New York Times best- seller. Overview  Published in early 2004, The Price of Loyalty chronicled the tenure of Paul O'Neill as Treasury Secretary during the Bush Administration. Like all treasury secretaries, O'Neill was the top domestic advisor to the president, as well as a member of the pivotal National Security Council. The book featured over 19,000 documents provided by O'Neill from his first two years with the Bush Administration. Among the most damaging accusations in the book was that invasion of Iraq was on the agenda as early as February 2001, nearly 7 months before the September 11 attacks. Reception The book was met with both commercial and critical success. It debuted as a #1 Bestseller on the New York Times Nonfiction list on February 1, 2004. O'Neill harshly criticizes the President, blasting his economic policies and alleged \\"detachment\\" from the cabinet process. He described Bush's behavior at cabinet meetings as being like \\"a blind man in a roomful of deaf people. There is no discernible connection.\\" O'Neill was frustrated about what he perceived to be a lack of vigorous debate between administration officials and the formation of sound, coherent policy on the important issues. He longed for the return of the \\"Brandeis briefs\\" that were used in the Nixon and Ford administrations in which he had previously worked. The book also claims that the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq was not a reaction to the attacks of September 11, but was instead a campaign in the planning stages ever since Bush took office, with potential oil spoils charted in early documents. Rather than denying his allegations, Bush officials attacked O'Neill's credibility, while answering that regime change in Iraq had been official U.S. policy since 1998, three years before Bush took office. However, O'Neill's claims called into question the relationship of the Iraq occupation to the post-9/11 War on Terrorism. After documents containing classified information were shown during a 60 Minutes interview in which O'Neill promoted the book, a Department of Treasury investigation concluded in 2004 that no laws were violated, but that inadequate document handling policies at Treasury had allowed 140 documents, which should have been marked classified, to be entered into a computer system for unclassified documents. The documents were amongst those subsequently released to O'Neill in response to a legal document request.http://www.post- gazette.com/pg/04083/289971.stm Keith Hennessey, then a Deputy of NEC Director Larry Lindsey, stated that Suskind made up a paragraph long direct quote from him during a White House meeting that he never actually said.http://keithhennessey.com/2011/09/23/a-past-suskind-error/ Experiment in Transparency To confirm the validity of his sources, the following was posted on Ron Suskind's official website.

Paolini, born in 1983, wrote the novel while still in his teens. After writing the first draft for a year, Paolini spent a second year rewriting and fleshing out the story and characters. His parents saw the final manuscript and in 2001 decided to self-publish Eragon; Paolini spent a year traveling around the United States promoting the novel. The book was discovered by novelist Carl Hiaasen, who got it re-published by Alfred A. Knopf. The re-published version was released on August 26, 2003. The book tells the story of a farm boy named Eragon, who finds a mysterious stone in the mountains. Not knowing the stone's origin or worth, he attempts to use it as payment to a butcher. A dragon he later names Saphira hatches from the stone, which was really an egg. When the evil King Galbatorix finds out the general location of the egg he sends the Ra'zac to acquire it. By that time Saphira had been growing for a while and takes Eragon to the Spine after Ra'zac appear in their village, Carvahall. Eragon and Saphira are forced to flee from their hometown with a storyteller named Brom, who Eragon learns to be an old member of an extinct group called the Riders. Brom was supposed to teach Eragon 'The Ways of the Rider.' Eragon was the third-best-selling children's hardback book of 2003, and the second-best-selling paperback of 2005. It placed on the New York Times Children's Books Best Seller list for 121 weeks and was adapted as a feature film of the same name that was released on December 15, 2006. Background = Origins and publication = Christopher Paolini started reading fantasy books when he was 10 years old. At the age of 14, as a hobby, he started writing the first novel in a series of four books, but he could not get beyond a few pages because he had \\"no idea\\" where he was going. He began reading everything he could about the \\"art of writing\\", and then plotted the whole Inheritance Cycle book series. After a month of planning out the series, he started writing the draft of Eragon by hand. It was finished a year later, and Paolini began writing the \\"real\\" version of the book. After another year of editing, Paolini's parents saw the final manuscript. They immediately saw its potential and decided to publish the book through their small, home-based publishing company, Paolini International. Paolini created the cover art for this edition of Eragon, which featured Saphira's eye on the cover. He also drew the maps inside the book. Paolini and his family toured across the United States promoting the book. He gave over 135 talks at bookshops, libraries, and schools, many with Paolini dressed up in a medieval costume; but the book did not receive much attention. Paolini said he \\"would stand behind a table in my costume talking all day without a break ‚Äì and would sell maybe forty books in eight hours if I did really well. [...] It was a very stressful experience. I couldn't have gone on for very much longer.\\" In the summer of 2002, American novelist Carl Hiaasen was on vacation in one of the cities that Paolini gave a talk in. While there, Hiaasen's stepson bought a copy of Eragon that he \\"immediately loved\\". He showed it to Hiaasen, who brought the book to the attention of the publishing house Alfred A. Knopf. Michelle Frey, executive editor at Knopf, contacted Paolini and his family to ask if they were interested in having Knopf publish Eragon. The answer was yes, and after another round of editing, Knopf published Eragon in August 2003, with a new cover, drawn by John Jude Palencar. = Inspiration and influences = Beowulf fighting the dragon (1908). Paolini received much inspiration from old epic poems. Paolini cites old myths, folk tales, medieval stories, the epic poem Beowulf, and authors J. R. R. Tolkien and Eric R√ºcker Eddison as his biggest influences in writing. Other literary influences include David Eddings, Andre Norton, Brian Jacques, Anne McCaffrey, Raymond E. Feist, Mervyn Peake, Ursula K. Le Guin, Frank Herbert, Philip Pullman, and Garth Nix. The ancient language used by the elves in Eragon is based \\"almost entirely\\" on Old Norse, German, Anglo Saxon, and Russian myth.Jana Schulman, \\"Retelling Old Tales: Germanic Myth and Language in Christopher Paolini's Eragon,\\" The Year's Work in Medieval-ism 25 (2010), 33-41. Paolini commented: \\"[I] did a god-awful amount of research into the subject when I was composing it. I found that it gave the world a much richer feel, a much older feel, using these words that had been around for centuries and centuries. I had a lot of fun with that.\\" Picking the right names for the characters and places was a process that could take \\"days, weeks, or even years\\". Paolini said: \\"if I have difficulty choosing the correct moniker, I use a placeholder name until a replacement suggests itself.\\" He added that he was \\"really lucky\\" with the name Eragon, \\"because it's just dragon with one letter changed.\\" Also, Paolini commented that he thought of both parts of the name \\"Eragon\\" - \\"era\\" and \\"gone\\" - as if the name itself changes the era in which the character lives. He thought the name fit the book perfectly, but some of the other names caused him \\"real headaches\\". Paolini received inspiration from Paradise Valley, Montana (Emigrant Peak pictured, as viewed from west bank of Yellowstone River)The landscape in Eragon is based on the \\"wild territory\\" of Paolini's home state, Montana. He said in an interview: \\"I go hiking a lot, and oftentimes when I'm in the forest or in the mountains, sitting down and seeing some of those little details makes the difference between having an okay description and having a unique description.\\" Paolini also said that Paradise Valley, Montana is \\"one of the main sources\\" of his inspiration for the landscape in the book (Eragon takes place in the fictional continent Alaga√´sia). Paolini \\"roughed out\\" the main history of the land before he wrote the book, but he did not draw a map of it until it became important to see where Eragon was traveling. He then started to get history and plot ideas from seeing the landscape depicted. Paolini chose to have Eragon mature throughout the book because, \\"for one thing, it's one of the archetypal fantasy elements\\". He thought Eragon's growth and maturation throughout the book \\"sort of mirrored my own growing abilities as a writer and as a person, too. So it was a very personal choice for that book.\\" Eragon's dragon, Saphira, was imagined as \\"the perfect friend\\" by Paolini. He decided to go in a more \\"human direction\\" with her because she is raised away from her own species, in \\"close mental contact\\" with a human. \\"I considered making the dragon more dragon-like, if you will, in its own society, but I haven't had a chance to explore that. I went with a more human element with Saphira while still trying to get a bit of the magic, the alien, of her race.\\" Paolini made Saphira the \\"best friend anyone could have: loyal, funny, brave, intelligent, and noble. She transcended that, however, and became her own person, fiercely independent and proud.\\" Saphira's blue tinted vision was in turn inspired by Paolini's own color-blindness. Paolini deliberately included archetypal elements of a fantasy novel like a quest, a journey of experience, revenge, romance, betrayal, and a \\"unique\\" sword. The book is described as a fantasy, and Booklist observed: \\"Paolini knows the genre well‚Äîhis lush tale is full of recognizable fantasy elements and conventions\\". Kirkus Reviews called the book a \\"high fantasy\\"; other reviewers have compared it to other books of the fantasy genre, such as Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, and in some instances stated Eragons plot is too similar to those other fantasy novels.  Plot summary  A shade named Durza, along with a group of urgals, ambushes a party of three elves. He and the urgals kill two of them, and Durza attempts to steal an egg carried by the remaining female elf, but she uses magic to teleport it elsewhere. Infuriated, he abducts her. Eragon is a fifteen-year- old boy who has lived with his uncle Garrow and cousin Roran on a farm near the village of Carvahall, left there by his mother Selena after his birth. While hunting, the dragon egg appears in front of him. The night after, a baby dragon hatches from the egg, and bonds with Eragon. Eragon names the dragon Saphira, after a name the old village storyteller Brom mentions. He raises the dragon in secret until two of King Galbatorix's servants, the Ra'zac, come to Carvahall. Eragon and Saphira escape and hide in the Spine, but Garrow is fatally wounded and the farm is burned down by the Ra'zac. Once Garrow dies, Eragon and Saphira decide to hunt the Ra'zac, in vengeance. Brom insists on accompanying him and Saphira, and gives Eragon the sword Zar'roc. Eragon becomes a Dragon Rider, through his bond with Saphira. He is the only known Rider in Alaga√´sia other than King Galbatorix, who, with the help of the now- dead Forsworn, a group of rogue dragon Riders, killed every other Rider a century ago. As they travel, Brom teaches Eragon sword fighting, magic, the ancient elvish language, and the ways of the Dragon Riders. They travel to the city of Teirm, where they meet with Brom's friend Jeod. Eragon's fortune is told by the witch Angela, and her companion, the werecat Solembum, gives Eragon mysterious advice. With Jeod's help, they track the Ra'zac to the city of Dras-Leona. They manage to infiltrate the city, but are forced to flee after a chance run-in with the Ra'zac. That night, they are ambushed by the Ra'zac. A stranger named Murtagh rescues them, but Brom is mortally wounded. Brom gives Eragon his blessing, reveals that he was once a Dragon Rider, with a dragon named Saphira, and dies. Eragon creates a sandstone tomb for Brom, which Saphira uses magic to transform into a diamond tomb. Murtagh becomes Eragon's new companion and they travel to the city of Gil'ead, seeking information on how to find the Varden, a group of rebels who seek the downfall of Galbatorix. Near Gil'ead, Eragon is captured and imprisoned, in a jail that holds a female elf he had had recurring dreams about. Murtagh and Saphira stage a rescue, and Eragon takes the unconscious elf with him. After fighting Durza, Murtagh seemingly kills him with an arrow shot through his head, and they escape. Eragon telepathically communicates with the elf, named Arya, who reveals she had sent the egg to him accidentally. From her, he learns the location of the Varden. Murtagh is reluctant to journey to the Varden, revealing that he is the son of Morzan, former leader of the Forsworn. An army of Kull, elite Urgals, chases Eragon to the Varden's headquarters, but is driven off by the Varden, who escort Eragon, Saphira, Murtagh, and Arya to Farthen D√ªr, their mountain hideout. Eragon meets the leader of the Varden, Ajihad. Ajihad imprisons Murtagh after he refuses to allow his mind to be read, to determine his allegiance. Eragon is told by Ajihad that Murtagh failed to kill Durza, as the only way to kill a Shade is with a stab through the heart. Orik, nephew of the dwarf King Hrothgar, is appointed as Eragon and Saphira's guide. Eragon also meets Ajihad's daughter, Nasuada, and Ajihad's right-hand man, J√∂rmundur. He also runs into Angela and Solembum again, and visits Murtagh in prison. He is tested by two magicians, The Twins, as well as Arya. Eragon and the Varden are then attacked by an immense Urgal army. Eragon personally battles Durza again, and, after a mental battle, is overwhelmed by Durza, who slashes him across the back. Arya and Saphira save Eragon, by shattering Isidar Mithrim, a large sapphire that formed the roof of the chamber, to distract Durza, allowing Eragon to stab him through the heart with his sword. He falls into a coma, and is visited telepathically by a stranger, who tells Eragon to visit him in the Elven capital, Ellesm√©ra. He wakes up with a scar across his back, and resolves to journey to Ellesm√©ra.  Reception  Eragon received generally mixed reviews and was criticized for its derivative nature. Liz Rosenberg of The New York Times Book Review criticized Eragon for having \\"clich√©d descriptions\\", \\"B-movie dialogue\\", \\"awkward and gangly prose\\". However, she concluded the review by noting that \\"for all its flaws, it is an authentic work of great talent.\\" School Library Journal wrote that in Eragon \\"sometimes the magic solutions are just too convenient for getting out of difficult situations.\\" Common Sense Media called Eragon's dialogue \\"long-winded\\" and \\"clich√©d\\", with a plot \\"straight out of Star Wars by way of The Lord of the Rings, with bits of other great fantasies thrown in here and ther..\\" The website did concede that the book is a notable achievement for such a young author, and that it would be \\"appreciated\\" by younger fans. Favorable reviews of Eragon often focused on the book's characters and plot. IGN's Matt Casamassina called the book \\"entertaining\\", and added that \\"Paolini demonstrates that he understands how to hold the reader's eyes and this is what ultimately separates Eragon from countless other me-too fantasy novels.\\" Chris Lawrence of About.com thought the book had all the \\"traditional ingredients\\" that make a fantasy novel \\"enjoyable\\". The book was a \\"fun read\\" for him because it is \\"quick and exciting\\" and \\"packed\\" with action and magic. Lawrence concluded his review by giving the book a rating of 3.8/5, commenting that \\"the characters are interesting, the plot is engrossing, and you know the good guy will win in the end.\\" Eragon was the third best-selling children's hardback book of 2003, and the second best- selling children's paperback of 2005. It placed on the New York Times Children's Books Best Seller list for 121 weeks. In 2006, the novel was awarded with a Nene Award by the children of Hawaii. It won the Rebecca Caudill Young Reader's Book Award and the Young Reader's Choice Award the same year.  Adaptations  = Film = Aerial photography of the S√°g Mountain, which served as the backdrop for Farthen D√ªr in the film adaptation of the book. A film adaptation of Eragon was released in the United States on December 15, 2006. Plans to create the film were first announced in February 2004, when 20th Century Fox purchased the rights to Eragon. The film was directed by first-timer Stefen Fangmeier, and written by Peter Buchman. Edward Speleers was selected for the role of Eragon. Over the following months, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Chris Egan and Djimon Hounsou were all confirmed as joining the cast. Principal photography for the film took place in Hungary and Slovakia. The film received mostly negative reviews, garnering a 16% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes; the tenth worst of 2006. The Seattle Times described it as \\"technically accomplished, but fairly lifeless and at times a bit silly\\". The Hollywood Reporter said the world of Eragon was \\"without much texture or depth\\". The story was labelled \\"derivative\\" by The Washington Post, and \\"generic\\" by the Las Vegas Weekly. Newsday stressed this point further, asserting that only \\"nine-year-olds with no knowledge whatsoever of any of the six Star Wars movies\\" would find the film original. The acting was called \\"lame\\" by the Washington Post, as well as \\"stilted\\" and \\"lifeless\\" by the Orlando Weekly. The dialogue was also criticized: MSNBC labelled it \\"silly\\"; the Las Vegas Weekly called it \\"wooden\\". Positive reviews described the film as \\"fun\\" and \\"the stuff boys' fantasies are made of\\". The CGI work was called \\"imaginative\\" and Saphira was called a \\"magnificent creation\\". Paolini stated he enjoyed the film, particularly praising the performances of Jeremy Irons and Ed Speleers. Eragon grossed approximately $75 million in the United States and $173.9 million elsewhere, totaling $249 million worldwide. It is the fifth highest-grossing film with a dragon at its focal point, and the sixth highest- grossing film of the sword and sorcery subgenre. Eragon was in release for seventeen weeks in the United States, opening on December 15, 2006 and closing on April 9, 2007. It opened in 3,020 theaters, earning $8.7 million on opening day and $23.2 million across opening weekend, ranking second behind The Pursuit of Happyness. Eragon's $75 million total United States gross was the thirty-first highest for 2006. The film earned $150 million in its opening weekend across 76 overseas markets, making it the #1 film worldwide. The film's $249 million total worldwide gross was the sixteenth highest for 2006.  Video game  A video game adaptation of Eragon based primarily on the film, released in North America on November 14, 2006. The game is a third- person video game released for PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows, developed by Stormfront Studios. Also released are unique versions of Eragon for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, and mobile phone handheld gaming systems, primarily developed by Amaze Entertainment. The console and PC versions of the game are very similar, focusing on the same style of gameplay. However, the Xbox 360 edition features two exclusive levels. One is on foot as Eragon, and Saphira is controlled in the second mission. The game has received generally negative reviews usually receiving press averages around the 4-6 out of 10 region (or the equivalent), (45-55 out of 100) according to review aggregator sites Metacritic and GameRankings. The combined sales in North America were over 400,000 copies. The majority of the game is taken up by third-person combat, usually on foot. Some missions permit the player to use the dragon Saphira in combat. The gameplay mechanics within these levels are largely similar to those in ground-based levels, with the exception of some different attack moves (such as tail attacks). Protagonist Eragon sits on Saphira's back during these sections, and can be made to fire magic arrows. The player has no choice as to whether or not they use Saphira. Similarly, the player cannot use Saphira in ground-based levels: they can call for her and she will swoop past, but it is not possible to use this feature to ride Saphira. There is a multiplayer co-op mode which allows two people to play through the main storyline. It is possible to switch from playing a one- player game to a two-player game at any time.

It stars musician Phil Collins, Julie Walters, Larry Lamb and Sheila Hancock. The soundtrack featured two singles from Collins which topped the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Plot Buster Edwards (Phil Collins) is a petty criminal from the East End of 1963 London. His long- suffering wife June (Julie Walters) thinks of him as a lovable rogue. The film opens with Buster walking along his local high street. He breaks into a shop to steal a suit, into which he then changes to attend a funeral. Buster brings Harry (Michael Attwell), who has been used on other 'jobs' and has recently served 18 months in prison for his part in previous robberies, to discuss the next 'job' with the ring-leader Bruce Reynolds (Larry Lamb). Harry wants 'in' and becomes part of the firm who are planning to rob a Royal Mail train allegedly carrying up to ¬£1 million in cash. After a complex and successful heist, the gang return to their farmhouse hideout to stay out of sight and split the spoils. They find they have stolen over ¬£3 million ‚àí much more than they have anticipated or reported by the media. Members of the gang are shown drinking from beer bottles and glasses without wearing gloves, thereby leaving fingerprints which would be evidence of their involvement in the robbery. While lying low at the farmhouse they hear on the radio that the police are searching farmhouses and outhouses within a radius of the robbery site. The gang become nervous and some members want to immediately return to London for fear of discovery; others think they should keep to the original plan and stay put. The gang decide to return to London, where they meet their 'contact', a solicitor's clerk who, as in the original plan, arranges for the farmhouse to be 'cleared and cleaned', thereby destroying any physical evidence linking the gang to the robbery. The contact states he will bring the plans forward from a few weeks to the next two to three days. Bruce, Buster and Harry are not happy with any delay at all because they fear imminent discovery, so they set off back to the farmhouse in their own car, to do the job themselves. During the journey they hear on the car radio that the farmhouse hideout has been discovered, so they abandon their plans and return to London, hoping they will have time to escape with their families. Buster returns home. He is devastated to find that June has had a miscarriage while he was committing the robbery. She cannot believe it when she learns of his involvement in what has been quickly dubbed \\"The Great Train Robbery\\". For several months after the robbery, Buster and June remain in hiding with their young daughter Nicky (Ellie Beaven) until they are turned in to the police by a suspicious neighbour. Buster flees to Acapulco where he is met by fellow Great Train Robber, Bruce Reynolds, and his girlfriend Franny (Stephanie Lawrence), who are also on the run and living it up in the sun on the profits of the crime. June and Nicky arrive, despite the disapproval of her mother (Sheila Hancock), and although Nicky seems to love her new life in the sun, June is immediately unimpressed with their new way of life and resolves to return to England, despite knowing that if Buster is to return with them he will be imprisoned (The real Buster Edwards plays a small cameo during the arrival in Acapulco. He is seen walking out of the airport with his girlfriend, played by Phil Collins‚Äô wife, just before Buster, June, and Nicky). Buster remains in Acapulco for some time after June leaves, until realising (while celebrating England's 1966 World Cup triumph) that having money and the sun means nothing if he doesn't have his family, so he returns to England to accept his punishment. The film closes 12 years after Buster's release from jail, showing him seemingly content and running a flower stall near London's Waterloo Bridge.

Two of them were released as singles, namely \\"A Groovy Kind of Love\\" and \\"Two Hearts\\", which reached #1 and #6 on the UK Singles Chart, respectively. Both songs were number one singles in the US. Phil Collins also co-wrote \\"Loco in Acapulco\\", performed by the Four Tops for the soundtrack. \\"Two Hearts\\" received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song, a Grammy Award for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, tying with \\"Let the River Run\\" from Working Girl by Carly Simon, while the soundtrack album received a Brit Award for Soundtrack/Cast Recording. Filming locations The opening sequence was filmed in Broadway Market, Hackney. The robbery scenes were filmed on the Great Central Railway, using British Rail Class 40, D306, as a stand-in for D326, the engine actually involved. Some scenes were filmed in Page Street, Westminster, London. Royal controversy Prince Charles and Princess Diana cancelled their attendance of the film's premiere on 15 September 1988, on the advice of Phil Collins, after the film was accused of glorifying crime. Collins said he wanted to avoid causing them \\"embarrassment\\".(9 September 1988). \\"Prince Charles cancels royal film date\\". Manila Standard (Manila). One of the film's critics was Conservative MP Ivor Stanbrook, who said the royal couple should not be associated with a film that \\"commemorates a particularly sordid and vicious crime.\\" Critical reception Reviews for the film were mixed, with praise for the lead performances but criticism of the film's tone. Film critic Barry Norman, host of BBC Television's Film 88, praised the performances of Collins and Walters, but criticised the film's script for its tone of romanticising criminality, as well as the failure to address the brutal assault on the train driver, describing the film as \\"amoral and even deplorable in its neglect of the act of violence\\". Radio Times gives the film three stars out of five, stating: \\"Too squeaky clean to be believable, this is an entertaining but fairy-tale view of law-breaking.\\" Halliwell's Film Guide also described the film as an \\"uneasy combination of romantic comedy and chase thriller\\". Leonard Maltin gave the film two-and-a-half stars, writing: \\"Singer Collins' starring film debut is a diverting (if forgettable) yarn, with Walters a good match as his loving, long-suffering spouse.\\" Maltin also claimed the film had a \\"great soundtrack\\". Stage version A stage production of Buster was staged between 2000 and 2004 at various locations across the UK starring (amongst others) Ray Quinn in the main cast. The production was an adaptation by Kieran Woodbury of the original Colin Shindler screenplay.

Despite missing issues due to industrial action during its run, the comic published 1,902 issues in total. The comic carried a mixture of humour and adventure strips, featuring the title character Buster and a host of other characters. Description The title character, whose strip usually appeared on the front cover, was Buster himself. He was originally billed as Buster: Son of Andy Capp; Andy Capp is the lead character of the eponymous Daily Mirror newspaper strip, and Buster wore a similar flat cap to reinforce the connection. In early issues Buster often referred to his father, and Andy was seen in the comic (attempting to find a gas leak in three frames of the 18 June 1960 issue; shown in two drawn photographs in the 2 July issue that same year, the first of which was displayed by Buster's mum with the pronouncement, \\"It's a photo of Buster taken with Andy! You can see he's got his dad's fine straight nose\\"). Buster's mum was often referred to by name, and was consistently drawn to resemble Andy's wife Flo. The connection with Andy Capp was gradually forgotten over time, and Andy no longer appeared in the strip by the mid-1960s. From 1965 the strip instead featured Buster in two long-running series: as lead character in the extremely durable \\"Buster's Diary\\" (1960‚Äì68 and 1974‚Äì85) and in \\"Buster's Dream World\\" (1968‚Äì74). A Swedish edition of Buster began in 1967. At first, most of the material was taken from the UK edition; but as time went on the magazine produced more and more original material. See Buster (sport comic) for more information. In its final years, the comic mostly consisted of reprints from either Buster itself or from the twelve comics which had merged with it over its 40-year run. The final strip was written by the last cartoonist for Buster, J. Edward Oliver. The last page of that final issue also revealed how every story in the comic ended,Back Page Of The Very Last Issue Of Buster - 4 January 2000 Comics UK typically in a humorous reversal of the obvious, or expected, manner. Special In March 2009, Egmont UK announced they were intending to publish four one-off specials, celebrating the comics Roy of the Rovers, Battle, Buster and Misty. To mark this event, the website BusterComic.co.uk held a poll in which users could vote for their favourite Buster strip. The results were released in May 2009, with \\"X Ray Specs\\" topping the poll. This was passed onto Egmont, and the special was due for release on 16 September 2009. Misty and Buster then had their release dates swapped, and the Buster special was finally released on 9 December 2009. On 19 March 2012, the Royal Mail launched a special stamp collection to celebrate Britain's rich comic book history. The collection featured The Beano, The Dandy, Eagle, The Topper, Roy of the Rovers, Bunty, Buster, Valiant, Twinkle and 2000 AD.

Absorbed titles As occurred with other British comics such as The Dandy, many other comics merged with Buster over the years, in consequence of which Buster inherited some of their characters: *Radio Fun (25 February 1961) - which itself had merged with The Wonder. *Film Fun (15 September 1962) - which itself had merged with Picture Fun, Kinema Comic, Film Picture Stories, Illustrated Chips and Top Spot. *The Big One (27 February 1965) *Giggle (20 January 1968) *Jet (2 October 1971) *Cor!! (22 June 1974) *Monster Fun (6 November 1976) *Jackpot (30 January 1982) *School Fun (2 June 1984) *Nipper (1 September 1987) *Oink!

(which itself had merged with Wow!, Cheeky and Shiver and Shake), Krazy, Scouse Mouse and Knockout = Closed story-lines = Here is a list of how the strips came to an end in the final issue: *Benny Bones of Lazy Bones tells the doctor that he is suffering from insomnia. *Joker reveals that his real name is Jeremy Beadle. *Chalky is arrested for vandalism. *Captain Crucial has a bad hair day. *Odd Ball bursts because he hides inside a thorn bush. *Sweet Tooth suffers from tooth decay because of all the sweets he's eaten. *Tom Thug is horrified to discover that he has passed his exams with flying colours, meaning he is no longer a brainless bully. *Bernie Banks of Memory Banks dies because he forgets to keep breathing. *Junior Rotter becomes the Prime Minister. *Tony Broke is happy because his parents have won 90 squillion pounds on the National Lottery, making Tony and his family mega-rich. Ivor Lott has broken down in tears because his father has lost all of his money investing in the Buster comic, making Ivor and his family very poor. Thus, Ivor Lott and Tony Broke have swapped places, with Tony being rich and Ivor being poor. *Melvyn of Melvyn's Mirror breaks the mirror, resulting in seven years' bad luck, but in Mirrorland, it's the opposite (seven years' good luck), but unfortunately, it also means that Melvyn will never see his family again and will be stuck in Mirrorland forever. *Bobby of Bobby's Ghoul has grown old, so his ghoul-friend (who never ages because she is a ghost) breaks up with him. *Watford Gapp can't think of a word rhyming with \\"oblige\\", so he cannot finish his poem. * Fuss Pot is too fussy to appear in the comic. *Ray of X-Ray Specs has his specs taken back by I.Squint, the optician because he says that he only lent Ray the specs in 1975, and that he couldn't keep them. *Jon and Suzy of Double Trouble have started to like each other. Also Sweeny Toddler says that he is going to like everyone from now on. *Buster takes off his cap to reveal a Dennis the Menace-style haircut. *The Millennium Bug affects Vid Kid's remote, resulting in the entire universe being turned off.

Some typical activity on the MUD, featuring a map, soul commands, talker channels and spell casting. History The MUD was founded in 1991 and opened to the public in 1992 (receiving continuous updates since then, now thirty years later). Originally containing a small section of the then rather loosely defined Ankh-Morpork, over time more locations have been added as the world has been further described in the book series, and laid out in the map supplements (such as The Streets of Ankh-Morpork and The Discworld Mapp). It now consists of areas that attempt to simulate several big cities (Ankh- Morpork, Bes Pelargic, Genua and Djelibeybi) on two continents, a larger number of smaller towns, and more than a million rooms which form the land between the cities and towns, with markers designating canon cities yet to be built. The MUD was founded in Perth, Western Australia, by David \\"Pinkfish\\" Bennett, Craig \\"Furball\\" Richmond, Sean A. \\"Lynscar\\" Reith and Evan Scott. It was an outgrowth of another MUD called Discworld II. The MUD ran for a while on a machine in Melbourne before moving to run in the UK on a machine at Compulink where Gordon \\"DrGoon\\" was added to the administration team. The MUD was later hosted for a time at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut by one of its undergraduates: Michael \\"Bastian\\" Hammill. \\"Bastian\\" served as chief administrator of the game and \\"god\\" of Discworld (a character role), while \\"Pinkfish\\" continued in his capacity as head game developer. Unfortunately, the school's IT administrator eventually ruled the project a hacking attempt due to multiple UNIX rlogin attempts from across the globe. This was actually just the game developers, or \\"creators\\", working as part of an international programming effort. The mistake cost the MUD another one of its homes. Also of note, at the time \\"Bastian\\" was issued a cease and desist order by Terry Pratchett's attorney. The author's legal adviser thought the game was a for- profit effort and therefore a violation of Pratchett's copyright. \\"Bastian\\" assured both Pratchett and his attorney it was a fan-based effort and invited the author to visit \\"Pinkfish's\\" creation. Pratchett was assuaged. The Discworld project was allowed to continue. After a while the game was moved to Seattle, running on a machine at one of the admin's workplace, Derek \\"Ceres\\" Harding, before again moving back to the UK to run at Jake \\"Sojan\\" Greenland's house. Discworld has publicly released the code base under which it runs on a couple of occasions, allowing other MUDs to use the same base for writing their worlds. Software The MUD's software is divided into two sections -- the mudlib and the driver. The MUD is based on a from-scratch mudlib and runs on FluffOS, a fork of the MudOS driver, placing it in the LPMud family. The driver is largely open-source, with new releases usually made available quickly, while cut-down versions of the mudlib including most of the underlying features are occasionally released (most recently in 2003), allowing the use of most of the basic object classes and tools of the MUD. It is expected that players who wish to help with coding the game will apply to join the game's development team, rather than working independently and submitting patches. Developers are not automatically taken from players at a certain skill level, instead being recruited into a hierarchy from the player base with an application and interview system. The underlying code is largely obscured from other players, with developers holding a policy of secrecy with actual game code and algorithms. Several useful algorithms such as that for determining experience costs have been either reverse-engineered or extracted from the released code by players, however, and can be generally found on various informational websites. Before code is released live for general play, it is tested for bugs, typos, playability and ensuring the integrity of the theme by a group of beta tester players, aka Playtesters. Often new items, areas, quests, and new spells or abilities are generated from ideas from this group of players. =Interface= The Discworld command system is a customized text parser allowing for flexible interactions with objects and a way to specify how the command is structured. In addition to adjectives and properties attached to game objects, allows advanced semantic recognition to specify in-game objects (including 'living' things): You are unburdened by: Holding: a set of pearl prayer beads (left hand). Wearing: a black backpack, a neat off-white linen robe and two silver rings. (under) : a utility belt. Carrying: a prayer book. > locate leather things The utility belt (worn) is in your inventory. The black backpack (worn) is in your inventory. > locate leather things except black things The utility belt (worn) is in your inventory. > glance at second worn thing The neat off-white linen robe. Other interface features include a basic in-game text editor, for editing in- game mail and other chunks of text, context-sensitive help, and optional sections of topological map (known as \\"lookmaps\\") to aid navigation. One of the strongest development priorities in recent years has been on textual depth, providing rich descriptions and additional details, rather than on expanding the world or on providing higher-level content. Many interesting or useful details in descriptive text can be elaborated upon by applying more specific criteria to the \\"look\\" command.  Player Interaction  =Chat= For purely message-based interaction, the MUD provides a talker system with a number of fixed channels, including general chat channels, channels for development organisation, and channels reserved for members of many in-game organisations. In addition to these, clubs can be formed which gain their own channels and optional electoral system. Some examples include Taxi (providing magical transportation around the game world), OOC (for roleplayers to chat and organise events out of character), and Begorrah (for Irish players to chat and organise meeting up in real life). Important to note that World Cabbage Day sees several meet-ups in real life over the past decade on several continents, notably in the UK, US and Australia. =RP & PvP= Roleplaying is optional, and players can be observed playing in many different roles both in and out of character, from organisational, to social, to 'numberchasing' (grinding, especially for skills). Player versus player interaction is on an opt-in basis, with characters over two days of play old being allowed to remove their protected status. There are some notable exceptions to this -- for example, the player councils can hire in-game, NPC (non-player character) assassins to kill a player who hasn't opted for PvP status. = Player councils = The game world includes several political regions. The cities of Ankh-Morpork and Djelibeybi are run by councils of elected player magistrates. These magistrates have the ability to develop player law, which they can also carry out. In areas with no player council, no written player laws apply, and only the game's acceptable use policy, invariably referred to as \\"the rules\\", applies. Ankh-Morpork has seven magistrates, while the Djelibeybi council has five. Elections are held every six months. The council system is based on the game Nomic. =Atmosphere= Taking the humorous aspect of Pratchett's work and running with it, the atmosphere on Discworld MUD is frequently whimsical, with a general fondness displayed for silliness and nonsense. Frogs and wombles are rhetorical touchstones bearing considerable weight.  Mechanics  The fundamental game mechanics of the MUD are based on a 'stat/skill' division, with a player's stats (statistics) relating to intrinsic properties, being semi-permanent, and skills (relating to aptitudes) increased by spending experience points to self-teach, or to learn from other player/non-player characters. Skill abilities are based on a diminishing returns system, in which a character's 'bonus', or ability to perform a certain task, is calculated on a logarithmic basis from the character's skill level and a geometric mean of related stats. Levels are uncapped, but also rise in experience point cost per level. Experience points can be gained in a number of ways -- in successful combat with NPCs, in the use of guild points (categorised action points), for exploration of areas, in the completion of quests, the accomplishment of in-game achievements, and simply by waiting -- a very slow rate of 'idle XP' is given to players merely for being online. The skill system contains a number of quirks and odd features; for example, some skills are used in unexpected ways, such as the skill \\"adventuring.movement.climbing.rock\\", which, while it is used for climbing rocks, is typically used to climb virtually any surface which isn't a tree or rope, such as a metal drainpipe. Because of the wide range of uses that skills are put to, individual skills are not documented, so working out what skill you need to perform a given task can sometimes be challenging -- for example, the skill \\"adventuring.direction\\", typically used to avoid getting lost in extreme circumstances, is also the skill used in both reading and crafting maps. Characters begin with seven lives, which can be replaced in-game. A player who dies with no lives can only be revived by a magical rite that consumes expensive components and requires the cooperation of eight high level wizards. Most PvP deaths do not reduce your life total, but otherwise have the same effects. Before 2012, a player that ran out of lives could not be revived at all. The majority of the game world is not persistent, resetting areas and objects invisibly, but players' inventories, the contents of rentable houses, and safe deposit box-like vaults are saved. = Guilds = A large part of the original intent for Discworld MUD was to move away from a restrictive class system, and to allow a player to do (almost) anything with enough effort and advancement. Each character can join one of a selection of guilds, a combination of class and in-game organisation, and each guild has several unique abilities not shared with any other. Many mundane attributes such as hit points, perceptiveness, and swimming skill are not affected by choice of guild. While players can advance and benefit from any skill, players get extra bonuses and abilities within the skill set of their guild. Broadly speaking, there are six classes: warrior, wizard, priest, witch, thief, and assassin. Over several years these broad classes have split into more specialized guilds with regional and cultural flavour, and somewhat more specialized skills. As of April 1st, 2019, the Fools' Guild and associated fool class were added to the game.http://discworld.starturtle.net/lpc/playing/guild_ob.c?guild=fool This was done to coincide with April Fools', but has remained and grown as an actual guild. Canon and divergence Content has been worked upon continuously as the Discworld series of books has been growing, therefore there are smatterings of continuity taken from different books introduced in different regions. Additionally, some changes to the world have been made to allow a limited degree of player-control (such as player-elected administration for some of the in-world organisations) rather than using NPCs created from book characters. The largest divergence from canon, however, is the addition of a range of divine magic not unlike that described in the Warhammer Fantasy or Dungeons and Dragons systems, mostly restricted to a small number of player-worshippable gods. Reception In April 1999, Discworld was selected as The Mud Connector's Mud of the Month. In Total PC Gaming, UK edition, Discworld was 2nd of the Top Three MUDs in the MMO Supplement in issue 7, and received a special mention in the MMO Supplement in issue 15, in the \\"We Love\\" section.

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Though unusually slight in stature for a power hitter, at , , Ott led the National League in home runs a then record six times. He was an All-Star for 11 consecutive seasons, and was the first National League player to surpass 500 career home runs. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1951. Early life Ott was born in Gretna, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans. Despite his average height stature, he quickly established himself as a gifted athlete, especially in baseball. During high school, he played on a semi-pro team three or four days a week. He already showed considerable power at a young age, and was getting paid for it. His team had a tradition of passing the hat whenever a player hit a home run that figured in a victory, meaning Ott was taking home money for playing baseball as early as 14. Playing career Despite his power, Ott's hometown minor league team, the New Orleans Pelicans, refused to sign him because of concerns about his size. He then found a job at a lumber company in Patterson, near Morgan City, where he became a sensation on the company baseball team. Company owner Henry Williams was particularly impressed with Ott. While visiting New York, he suggested that Giants manager John McGraw give him a tryout. Ott was skeptical at first, so Williams bought Ott a train ticket to New York . Ott arrived in New York in early September. He quickly impressed observers with his hitting, especially McGraw, who predicted that he would be \\"one of the greatest lefthand hitters the National League has ever seen.\\" He formally signed Ott to a contract in January 1926. =Regular season= Ott had originally been a catcher, but McGraw concluded that Ott was too small to be a major league catcher and converted him into an outfielder. After two years as a part-time player, he became the regular right fielder in 1929 at the age of 19. He didn't disappoint; powering 41 home runs and collecting 151 RBIs‚Äîboth records for players who were 20 years old or younger at the start of the season. Ott was a six-time NL home run leader, in 1932, 1934, 1936‚Äì1938, and 1942. From 1928‚Äì1945, he led the New York Giants in home runs. This 18-season consecutive dominance is a record; no other player has ever led his team in more consecutive years in a single Triple Crown category. He was both the youngest player to hit 100 home runs and the first National Leaguer to hit 500 home runs. He passed Rogers Hornsby to become the all-time NL home run leader in and held that title until Willie Mays passed him in . Ott's 1940 Play Ball baseball card Because of his power hitting, he was noted for reaching base via the base on balls (BB), or walk. He drew five walks in a game three times. He set the National League record for most walks in a doubleheader, with six, on October 5, 1929, and did it again on April 30, 1944. He tied an MLB record by drawing a walk in seven consecutive plate appearances (June 16‚Äì18, 1943). He also led the NL in walks six times: in 1929, 1931‚Äì1933, 1937, and 1942. He twice scored six runs in a game, on August 4, 1934, and on April 30, 1944. He is the youngest major leaguer to ever hit for the cycle. Ott was the first NL player to post eight consecutive 100-RBI seasons, and only Willie Mays, Sammy Sosa, Chipper Jones, and Albert Pujols have since joined him. He used a batting style that was then considered unorthodox, lifting his forward (right) foot prior to impact. When McGraw first saw Ott's style, he called it \\"the most natural swing I've seen in years. This style helped him hit for power. More recent players who used a similar style include Harold Baines and Kirby Puckett, as well as the Japanese home run king, Sadaharu Oh. In 1943, all of his 18 home runs came at home; only two others ever had a greater number of all-homefield home runs. Of Ott's 511 career home runs, 323 of them, or 63%, came at home.Home Run Handbook, John Tattersall, 1975 Because of this, his home run record historically has been downplayed, suggesting that a foul line at the Polo Grounds resulted in higher numbers at home. Sportswriters often jokingly referred to him as the master of the \\"Chinese home run\\" as such short homers were called at the time; Ott would often respond by noting that if it was so easy to inflate his homer totals by hitting over that fence, all other hitters in the league would be doing it. As a balance, the Polo Grounds had the deepest power alleys in baseball. Also, he hit more career home runs in foreign stadiums than any other National League hitter at the time of his retirement. In some of his better seasons, he hit more homers on the road than in the Polo Grounds. There may be reason to believe that he was a better hitter than his record suggests because of differences in National League and American League ball specifications. Those differences are considered the most outstanding in the history of the game and made it considerably harder for National League hitters to achieve home runs. Ott was also a skilled fielder. He was a master at playing balls that bounced off the fences at the Polo Grounds, allowing him to garner 26 assists in 1929, his first full season as a full-time player. He would never even approach that figure again, as baserunners quickly realized it was far too risky to run on balls hit in Ott's direction. During the prime of Ott's career, 11 seasons from 1931‚Äì1941, American League batters averaged 21% more home runs‚Äîpeaking at 41% more home runs‚Äîthan their National League counterparts. Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx, contemporaries, and both American League players, were the only batters to surpass Ott's record during this time. =Post-season= Ott played in the World Series in 1933, 1936, and 1937, winning in 1933. He hit two home runs during the 1933 series. In Game 1, he had four hits, including a two-run home run in the first inning. In Game 5, he drove in the series-winning run with two outs in the top of the 10th, driving a pitch into the center-field bleachers. In the 1936 World Series, Ott had seven hits and one home run. In 1937, he had 4 hits and 1 home run. Playing in 16 World Series games, Ott batted .295 (18-for-61) with eight runs, four home runs and ten RBI. =Career statistics= In his 22-season career, Ott batted .304 with 511 home runs, 1,860 RBIs, 1,859 runs, 2,876 hits, 488 doubles, 72 triples, 89 stolen bases, 1,708 BB, .414 on-base percentage and a .533 slugging average. Defensively, he recorded a .974 fielding percentage. He hit better than .300 10 times in his major league career. At the time of his retirement, he had hit 200 more home runs than the next-highest National Leaguer. Managerial career After longtime teammate Bill Terry retired as manager in 1941, he named Ott as player-manager. Ott continued as a regular player for another five years, and remained productive at the plate for much of that time. In 1942, he led the league in home runs, runs scored, and walks. He finished second in home runs and third in slugging percentage in 1944. In 1945, he hit .308 and finished tied for fourth in home runs. On the second day of the 1946 season, a day after hitting what would be his final career home run, he injured his knee while diving for a fly ball. The injury effectively ended his career; he only appeared in 29 more games for the rest of 1946, and retired after making only four cameo appearances in 1947. He stayed on as manager until Leo Durocher replaced him midway through the 1948 season. The Giants' best finish during Ott's tenure was third place in 1942, one of only three times he finished with a winning record. However, his 1943 and 1944 teams were decimated by World War II, which saw a number of established players drafted into the military. It was in reference to Ott's supposedly easy-going managing style that then-Dodgers manager Durocher made the oft- quoted and somewhat out-of-context comment, \\"Nice guys finish last!\\" Ott was the first manager to be ejected from both games of a doubleheader, when the Giants lost both games to the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 9, 1946. Ott spent the remaining two-and-a-half years of his contract helping his former teammate Carl Hubbell run the Giants' farm system. In 1951, Ott succeeded Chuck Dressen as manager of the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League, leading the club to an 80‚Äì88 finish (seventh place). In 1952, the Oaks finished 104-76 under Ott, good for second place in the PCL. MLB honors Ott was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1951 with 87.2% of the vote. His number \\"4\\" was also retired by the Giants in , and it is posted on the facade of the upper deck in the left field corner of Oracle Park. He was a National League All-Star for 11 consecutive seasons, from 1934 through 1944 (All-Star selections only began in 1933; Ott had at least three All-Star caliber seasons prior to that, as well as in 1945, when MLB cancelled the 1945 contest and selections). He is one of only six National League players to spend a 20+ year career with one team (Cap Anson, Stan Musial, Willie Stargell, Tony Gwynn, and Craig Biggio being the others). He was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Broadcasting career Ott (left) in the broadcast booth with Van Patrick, 1957 Ott spent the 1953 and 1954 seasons out of baseball for the first time since coming to New York in 1925. In 1955, he joined the Mutual radio network to recreate baseball games. From 1956 to 1958, Ott teamed with Van Patrick to broadcast the games of the Detroit Tigers on radio and television. Death Ott was injured in an auto accident in Bay Saint Louis, Mississippi, in November of 1958. He was transferred to a hospital in New Orleans, where he died a week later at the age of 49. He was interred in Metairie Cemetery. Ott died in a similar manner to two other New York Giants Hall of Famers: Frankie Frisch in 1973 and Carl Hubbell in 1988. Legacy Ott is remembered in his hometown of Gretna, where a park is named in his honor. Since 1959, the National League has honored the league's annual home run champion with the Mel Ott Award. In the 1989 film Field of Dreams, Ott was one of several deceased players portrayed in farmer Ray Kinsella's Iowa cornfield. In 2006, Ott was featured on a United States postage stamp, as one of a block of four honoring \\"Baseball Sluggers\\" -- the others being Mickey Mantle, Hank Greenberg, and Roy Campanella. In announcing the stamps, the U.S. Postal Service stated, \\"Remembered as powerful hitters who wowed fans with awesome and often record- breaking home runs, these four men were also versatile players who helped to lead their teams to victory and set impressive standards for subsequent generations.\\" Ott is also remembered in the name of the Little League of Amherst, New York. The Mel Ott Little League began in 1959, named for Ott soon after his death. Ott's name frequently appears in crossword puzzles, on account of its letter combination and brevity. Ott is mentioned in the poem \\"Line-Up for Yesterday\\" by Ogden Nash, first published in Sport magazine in January 1949: Baseball records and accomplishments =Home runs= * Six- time NL home run leader (1932, 1934, 1936‚Äì1938, 1942). * Was the youngest player to hit 100 and 200 home runs, and the first NL player to reach 500 home runs. * Passed Rogers Hornsby (301) to become the all-time NL home run leader in and held that title (at 511) until Willie Mays passed him in . * Holds major league record by leading his team 18 consecutive years in home runs (1928‚Äì1945). =Walks= * Drew five walks in a game three times, and six walks in a doubleheader twice. * Shares MLB record by drawing a walk in seven consecutive plate appearances (June 16 through 18, 1943). * Led NL in walks six times (1929, 1931‚Äì1933, 1937, 1942). =Other offense= * Twice scored six runs in a game (August 4, 1934 and April 30, 1944). * Hit for the cycle (May 16, 1929). * First NL player to post eight consecutive 100-RBI seasons (only Willie Mays, Sammy Sosa, Chipper Jones, and Albert Pujols have joined him). =Defense= * Twice led NL outfielders in double plays (1929 and 1935). =Overall= * 11-time All-Star (1934‚Äì1944) and four time The Sporting News All-Star (1934‚Äì1936, 1938). * In 1999, he ranked number 42 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and was a nominee for the MLB All-Century Team. * One of six NL players to play more than 20 years with one team (Cap Anson, Stan Musial, Willie Stargell, Craig Biggio, and Tony Gwynn are the others). * He managed the New York Giants in seven seasons (1942‚Äì1948).

The gray ratsnake is one of about ten species within the American ratsnake genus Pantherophis. Description A medium to large serpent, the gray ratsnake typically reaches an adult size of total length (including tail); however, the record is for a captive specimen at the Ridley 4-H Center in Tennessee. Unlike other Pantherophis, whose conspicuous juvenile pattern fades into adulthood, the gray ratsnake in the southern part of its range does not undergo drastic ontogenetic changes in color or markings. Instead, it retains the juvenile pattern of dark elongate dorsal blotches separated by four, or more, pale gray body scales, a light gray crown with dark striping that forms an anteriorly facing spearpoint, and a solid band which covers the eyes and extends rearward to the posterior upper labial scales. However, in the northern part of its range it is black in adulthood, like P. alleghaniensis and P. obsoletus. The venter is usually off-white or pale gray with darker irregular blotches, and a double row of black spots behind the divided anal plate of the vent. The dorsal scale rows around midbody are usually weakly keeled. Because the gray ratsnake shares its range with other members of its genus, hybrids of midlands x eastern ratsnakes are not uncommon. Distribution and habitat Native to North America, Pantherophis spiloides is commonly found in the forests of the eastern and central United States. It occurs relatively continuously throughout the major part of the eastern half of the United States, along the western edge of the Appalachian Mountains, from southwestern New England to the Gulf of Mexico, westward to the Mississippi River, and northward from northern Louisiana to southwestern Wisconsin. In Canada, this species is known to occur in two disjunct regions of southern Ontario: the Carolinian forest region along the north shore of Lake Erie in the southwest, and the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence region in the southeast.Species at Risk Public Registry ‚Äì Species Profile (Gray Ratsnake). Sararegistry.gc.ca. Retrieved on 2013-08-24.Gray Ratsnake, Ontario Nature Habitat An agile climber, the gray ratsnake is at home from the ground to the tree tops in many types of hardwood forest and cypress stands, along tree-lined streams and fields, and even around barns and sheds in close proximity to people. Within its range, almost any environment rich in rodents, and vertical escape options, proves a suitable habitat for the gray ratsnake. Diet A scent-hunter and a powerful constrictor, P. spiloides feeds primarily on small mammals, birds, and bird eggs. Neonates and juveniles prefer a diet of frogs and lizards. Behavior When startled, the gray ratsnake, like other ratsnakes, stops and remains motionless with its body held in a series of wave-like kinks. The snake will also rattle its tail against whatever it is lying on, making an audible buzzing sound. The gray ratsnake will defend itself by raising its head and bluffing a strike. If handled, it will musk a victim by releasing the foul-smelling contents of its cloaca, and will bite if necessary. However, the gray ratsnake is less likely to bite than other members of its genus, and wounds from a bite rarely require more than a small bandage. Reproduction Breeding in P. spiloides takes place from April to July. Females reach sexual maturity at 7‚Äì9 years of age. They deposit 5 to 27 eggs around mid-summer, and the hatchlings usually emerge in September. Conservation status The gray ratsnake is considered common across much of its range, but is listed as \\"of special concern\\" in Michigan Gray ratsnake, Michigan Department of Natural Resources and is also listed as rare in Wisconsin.Gray ratsnake, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources The gray ratsnake is listed federally in Canada as \\"endangered\\" (Carolinean population) and \\"threatened\\" (Great Lakes/St Lawrence population).Canada Species At Risk Act In the state of Georgia, all indigenous, nonvenomous snakes are illegal to kill or capture, and are considered to be in the custody of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.Georgia Wildlife.org Keeping Georgia Wildlife as Pets. georgiawildlife.org Habitat destruction and road mortality are leading causes of decline.

Typically associated with a rash called necrolytic migratory erythema, weight loss, and mild diabetes mellitus, most people with glucagonoma contract it spontaneously. However, about 10% of cases are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) syndrome.  Causes  Although the cause of glucagonoma is unknown, some genetic factors may lead to the condition. A family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a risk factor. Additionally, those with Mahvash disease have an increased risk for glucagonoma, as glucagon receptor gene (GCGR) is mutated. Mechanism Glucagonoma results from the overproduction of glucagon, a peptide hormone located in the pancreatic alpha cells. Classic symptoms include, but are not limited to, necrolytic migratory erythema (NME), diabetes mellitus, and weight loss. NME presents in about 70% of cases of glucagonoma, and is characterized by erythematous lesions over the distal extremities and the groin area. NME has occasionally been observed in people who do not have glucagonoma. People who develop glucagonoma from Mahvash disease also do not develop NME, implying that working glucagon receptors are needed in order for NME to be present in a person. Weight loss, the most commonly associated effect with glucagonoma, results from the glucagon hormone, which prevents the uptake of glucose by somatic cells. Diabetes is not present in all cases of glucagonoma, but does frequently result from the insulin and glucagon imbalance.  Diagnosis  The presence of glucagonoma syndrome, the symptoms that accompany the pancreatic tumor, as well as elevated levels of glucagon in the blood, are what is used to diagnose glucagonoma. When a person presents with a blood glucagon concentration greater than 500 mg/mL along with the glucagonoma syndrome, a diagnosis can be established. It is important to note that not all cases of hyperglucagonemia will lead to a diagnosis of glucagonoma. Elevated blood levels of glucagon are associated with other disorders like pancreatitis and kidney failure. About 60% of people diagnosed with glucagonoma are women. Most of those that are diagnosed are between 45‚Äì60 years of age.  Treatment  People who are diagnosed with sporadic glucagonoma often have an increased mortality rate compared to those with MEN1, as the latter group will go to the doctor for periodic visits. People whose tumor have metastasized cannot easily be treated as the tumor is resistant to chemotherapy. The only curative therapy for glucagonoma is surgery, and even this is not always successful. Heightened glucagon secretion can be treated with the administration of octreotide, a somatostatin analog, which inhibits the release of glucagon. Doxorubicin and streptozotocin have also been used successfully to selectively damage alpha cells of the pancreatic islets. These do not destroy the tumor, but help to minimize progression of symptoms.  History  Fewer than 251 cases of glucagonoma have been described in the literature since their first description by Becker in 1942. Because of its rarity (fewer than one in 20 million worldwide), long-term survival rates remain unknown. Glucagonoma accounts for approximately 1% of neuroendocrine tumors, although this may be an underestimate given that glucagonoma is associated with non-specific symptoms.

MuV contains a single- stranded, negative-sense genome made of ribonucleic acid (RNA). Its genome is about 15,000 nucleotides in length and contains seven genes that encode nine proteins. The genome is encased by a capsid that is in turn surrounded by a viral envelope. MuV particles, called virions, are pleomorphic in shape and vary in size from 100 to 600 nanometers in diameter. One serotype and twelve genotypes that vary in their geographic distribution are recognized. Humans are the only natural host of the mumps virus. MuV replicates first by binding to the surface of cells, whereby its envelope merges with the host cell membrane to release the capsid inside of the cell. Once inside, the viral RNA- dependent RNA polymerase transcribes messenger RNA (mRNA) from the genome and later replicates the genome. After translation of viral proteins, virions are formed adjacent to the cell membrane, where they then leave the cell by budding from its surface, using the cell membrane as the envelope. The mumps virus was first identified as the cause of mumps in 1934 and was first isolated in 1945. Within a few years after isolation, vaccines protecting against MuV infection had been developed. MuV was first recognized as a species in 1971, and it has been given the scientific name Mumps orthorubulavirus. It is the type species of the genus Orthorubulavirus in the subfamily Rubulavirinae, family Paramyxoviridae. Characteristics =Genome= The mumps virus contains a nonsegmented, single-stranded, linear genome that is 15,384 nucleotides in length and made of ribonucleic acid (RNA). The genome has negative sense, so mRNA can be transcribed directly from the genome. Mumps virus encodes seven genes in the following order: * nucleocapsid (N) protein, * V/P/I (V/phospho-(P)/I) proteins, * matrix (M) protein, the most abundant protein in virions, * fusion (F) protein, * small hydrophobic (SH) transmembrane protein, * hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), and * the large (L) protein. The L and P proteins combine to form the RNA- dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). RdRp acts as both a replicase to replicate the genome and as a transcriptase to transcribe mRNA from the genome. Unlike the other proteins, the I protein's function is unknown. =Structure= The genome of the mumps virus is encased by N proteins to form a flexible, loosely coiled helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex consisting of the genome surrounded by a nucleocapsid that RdRp is bound to. RNPs are surrounded by an envelope, a lipid membrane, which contains two types of spikes on its surface that correspond to the HN and F glycoproteins. M proteins are found on the inner side of the envelope, connecting the envelope to the RNP. Virions vary in size from 100 to 600 nanometers (nm) in diameter and are pleomorphic in shape. =Life cycle= MuV first interacts with a host cell by binding to its surface via the HN protein's receptor, sialic acid, which binds to sialic acid receptors on the surface of host cells. Following attachment, the F protein is triggered and begins fusing the viral envelope with the host cell's membrane. The F protein does so by changing from a metastable state to refolding to a more stable hairpin structure, which allows the contents of the virion, including the RNP, to be released into the host cell's cytoplasm. Upon entering the host cell, the RdRp begins transcring mRNA from the genome inside the RNP. Transcription starts at or near the 3'-end (usually pronounced \\"three prime end\\") at a promoter region and moves sequentially toward the 5'-end. One mRNA strand is transcribed for each gene, and it is necessary for all genes sequentially before a gene to be transcribed for that gene to be transcribed. Genes closer to the 3'-end are transcribed at the highest frequency, decreasing in frequency as RdRp approaches the 5'-end. RdRp synthesizes a cap on the 5'-end of the mRNA and a polyadenylated tail on the 3'-end consisting of hundreds of consecutive adenines. Once a gene has been transcribed, RdRp releases it into the cytoplasm for subsequent translation of viral proteins by host ribosomes. The V and P proteins are encoded by the same gene, so while transcribing mRNA, RdRp edits the mRNA by inserting two non-templated guanines into the mRNA to transcribes mRNA for the P protein. Later in the replication cycle, once a sufficient number of nucleoproteins are present after translation, RdRp switches functions to replicate the genome. This occurs in a two-step process: first, a positive-sense antigenome is synthesized by RdRp from the negative-sense genome, and second, negative-sense genomic RNA strands are in turn synthesized by RdRp from the antigenome. During this process, the antigenome and newly replicated genomes are encapsidated by the nucleoprotein at the same time as replication. Progeny genomes can be used for additional transcription or replication or may simply be packaged into progeny virions. HN and F proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and travel through the Golgi complex to the cell membrane, whether they bind to the cell membrane and protrude from the surface of the cell. M proteins bind to the sites of the cell membrane where HN and F proteins are, doing so at the positions where their \\"tails\\" protrude into the inside of the cell membrane in the cytoplasm. M proteins then act as a signals to newly synthesized RNPs as to where virions are to be formed. The interaction of RNP and M proteins is then thought to trigger budding from the host cell. Budding from the host cell begins once M proteins recruit host class E proteins that form endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) structures at the site of budding. There, ESCRT proteins form into concentric spirals and push the contents of the virion outward from the cell in the form of a vesicle that protrudes from the cell. The ESCRT proteins then constrict the opening of the vesicle and terminate budding by cutting off the vesicle from the rest of the membrane, forming a complete virion that is released from the host cell. During this process, the neuraminidase of HN proteins aids in separation from the host membrane and prevents virion aggregation. =Diversity= The mumps virus has one serotype and twelve genotypes. The genotypes can be distinguished based on the F, SH, are HN genes. The SH gene has a degree of variation between genotypes ranging from 5% to 21%, the highest among MuV's genes. The genotypes are named genotypes A to N, excluding E and M, i.e. genotypes A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and N. Genotypes E and M were previously recognized but were abolished due to phylogenetic analysis that MuVs assigned to them instead belonged genotypes C and K, respectively. The different genotypes vary in frequency from region to region. For example, genotypes C, D, H, and J are more common in the western hemisphere, whereas genotypes F, G, and I are more common in Asia, although genotype G is considered to be a global genotype. Genotypes A and B have not been observed in the wild since the 1990s. This diversity of MuV is not reflected in the antibody response since because there is only one serotype, antibodies to one genotype are also functional against all others. =Evolution= The F, SH, HN genes, used to distinguish genotypes, are estimated to experience genetic mutations at a rate of substitutions per site per year, which is considered to be a very low mutation rate for an RNA virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the entire SH gene indicates that genotypes A and J are related in one branch and split apart from the other genotypes. In that second branch, genotype I is a sister clade of the other genotypes, which cluster into five sequential sister clades: G and H; D and K; C; L; and B, F, and N. Disease Humans are the only natural host of the mumps virus, which causes mumps. The disease is transmitted via contact with respiratory secretions such as aerosolized droplets and saliva. Infection leads to fever, muscle pain, and painful swelling of the parotid glands, two salivary glands situated on the sides of the mouth in front of the ears. Infection may also involve many other tissues and organs, resulting in a variety of inflammatory reactions such as encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, orchitis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, nephritis, oophoritis, and mastitis. Mumps is usually not life-threatening and typically resolves within a few weeks after the onset of symptoms, but long- term complications such as paralysis, seizures, hydrocephalus, and deafness can occur. Treatment is supportive in nature, and infection is preventable via vaccination. Immune system interactions The SH protein is thought to be involved in blocking NF(Œ±)-mediated apoptosis of the host cell, which is done as an antiviral response to suppress the spread of viruses, though SH is not necessary for replication since MuVs engineered without SH are still able to replicate. The V protein is also involved in evading host antiviral responses, by which it inhibits production and signalling of interferons. While MuV has just one serotype and the immune system produces a single type of antibody that binds to all genotypes, significant variation in the quantity of sera needed to neutralize different genotypes in vitro has been observed. Furthermore, the immune system's reaction to MuV seems inherently weak for several reasons: for the vaccinated, memory T lymphocytes generated via vaccination may be necessary but inadequate for protection; antibody concentrations in in vitro studies appear to be low and mostly misdirected to the non-neutralizing nucleoprotein instead of the NH receptors; and MuV- specific memory B lymphocytes have been reported to be low in frequency. Classification Mumps virus, scientific name Mumps orthorubulavirus, is the type species of the genus Orthorubulavirus, in the subfamily Rubulavirinae, family Paramyxoviridae. Strains of MuV are named and classified using the following system: * MuVs (RNA sequence derived from clinical material) or MuVi (RNA sequence derived from cell culture) * City.Country ISO3 code * Week number.year, the date of onset of when the disease occurred, or the date of specimen collection if the disease onset date is unknown, or the date the sample was received in the laboratory if the two prior dates are unknown * replicate in week * [genotype], which indicates which genotype the strain belongs to * (VAC), which is used to indicate strains derived from cases with a history of vaccination and with vaccine virus detected This system is used in sequential order. For example, MuVs/NewYork.USA/17.11[B] (VAC) is a vaccine-associated genotype B MuV derived from clinical material in New York City, and MuVi/London.GBR/3.12/2[G] is a genotype G MuV derived from cell culture in London. History The earliest known written account of mumps was in the 5th century B.C. by Greek physician Hippocrates. He described an outbreak of mumps on the island of Thasos in approximately 410 B.C. and provided a fuller description of the disease in Corpus Hippocraticum in Epidemics. In 1934, the etiology of the disease, the mumps virus, was discovered by Claude D. Johnson and Ernest William Goodpasture. They found that rhesus macaques exposed to saliva taken from humans in the early stages of the disease developed mumps. Furthermore, they showed that mumps could then be transferred to children via filtered and sterilized, bacteria-less preparations of macerated monkey parotid tissue, showing that it was a viral disease. The mumps virus was isolated for the first time in 1945 and by 1948 the first mumps vaccine had been developed. This vaccine contained inactivated virus particles and provided short-term protection against mumps. In the 1960s, Maurice Hilleman developed a more effective mumps vaccine using live virus particles that were taken from his then five-year-old infected daughter, Jeryl Lynn. This vaccine was approved for use in 1967 and recommended in 1977, replacing prior vaccines that were less effective. Hilleman would also work to develop the MMR vaccine in 1971, effective against measles, mumps, and rubella. The \\"Jeryl Lynn\\" strain of the mumps virus, which belongs to genotype A, continues to be used in vaccines against mumps. Mumps virus was recognized as a species in 1971 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), which oversees virus taxonomy, when it was assigned to the genus Paramyxovirus. Since then, it has undergone numerous taxonomic changes and changes to its scientific name: * In 1995, Mumps virus was established as the type species of the newly established genus Rubulavirus. * In 2016, Mumps virus was renamed to Mumps rubulavirus. * In 2018, Mumps rubulavirus was renamed to Mumps orthorubulavirus to accompany Rubulavirus being abolished and replaced with the subfamily Rubulavirinae bearing the same name and the newly established genus Orthorubulavirus. =Etymology= The word \\"mumps\\" is first attested circa 1600 and is the plural form of \\"mump\\", meaning \\"grimace\\", originally a verb meaning \\"to whine or mutter like a beggar\\". The disease was likely called mumps in reference to the swelling caused by mumps parotitis, reflecting its impact on facial expressions as well as its causing of painful, difficult swallowing. \\"Mumps\\" was also used starting from the 17th century to mean \\"a fit of melancholy, sullenness, silent displeasure\\".

In a long and colorful career extending over many more nations and decades than was usual at the time, Vogler established himself as a foremost experimenter in baroque and early classic music. His greatest successes came as performer and designer for the organ at various courts and cities around Europe, as well as a teacher, attracting highly successful and devoted pupils such as Carl Maria von Weber. His career as a music theorist and composer however was mixed, with contemporaries such as Mozart believing Vogler to have been a charlatan. Despite his mixed reception in his own life, his highly original contributions in many areas of music (particularly musicology and organ theory) and influence on his pupils endured, and combined with his eccentric and adventurous career, prompted one historian to summarize Vogler as \\"one of the most bizarre characters in the history of music\\". Biography Vogler was born at Pleichach in W√ºrzburg. His father Jared Vogler was a violin maker and instrument-maker for the Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg. The young Vogler studied law and theology in W√ºrzburg and Bamberg, however he had possessed a prodigious talent and interest in music from childhood and continued to pursue that interest as a university student. In the late 1760s he was introduced to the Elector Palatine Karl Theodor, receiving appointment as the latter's almoner at the court in Mannheim in 1770. Vogler became active in composing and performance there, and in 1771 his first major theatrical piece Singspiel ‚Äì Der Kaufmann von Smyrna was performed for the court. In 1773 he was sponsored by the court to study under the Padre Martini in Bologna. Dissatisfied with the method of that learned theorist, he studied for five months under Francesco Antonio Vallotti at Padua, and met Johann Adolph Hasse in Venice. He afterwards proceeded to Rome, where, having been ordained priest, he was admitted to the famous Academy of Arcadia, made a knight of the Golden Spur, and appointed protonotary and chamberlain to the pope. On his return to Mannheim in 1775, Vogler was appointed court chaplain and second maestro di cappella. From this position he was able to found a school to educate both amateur and aspiring musicians. His pupils were devoted to him, but he made innumerable enemies, for the principles upon which he taught were opposed to those of all other teachers. Two major musicological contributions followed: Tonwissenschaft und Tonsetzkunst on the theory of harmony, and Stimmbildungskunst on voice training. He also invented a new system of fingering for the harpsichord, a new form of construction for the organ, and from 1778 to 1781 edited the Betrachtungen der Mannheimer Tonschule ‚Äì a periodical providing analysis of new compositions and essays on music. Mozart condemned the fingering as \\"miserable\\", the young composer finding little musical success in Mannheim now musically dominated by Vogler. The proposed change in the construction of the organ consisted of simplifying the mechanism, introducing free-reeds in place of ordinary reed-stops, and substituting unisonous stops for the great \\"mixtures\\" then in vogue. Vogler's writings on musical theory, though professedly based upon Vallotti's principles, were to a great extent empirical. Nevertheless, in virtue of a certain substratum of truth which seems to have underlain his new theories, Vogler undoubtedly exercised a powerful influence over the progress of musical science, and numbered among his disciples some of the greatest geniuses of the period. orchestrion built by M. Welte (1895) In 1778 Karl Theodor moved his court to Munich. Vogler temporarily remained in Mannheim before following him there in 1780, but, dissatisfied with the reception accorded to his dramatic compositions, soon quit his post. He went to Paris, where after much hostility his new system was recognized as a continuation of that started by Jean- Philippe Rameau. His organ concerts in the church of St. Sulpice attracted considerable attention. At the request of the royal court, he composed the opera Le Patriotism, which was performed at Versailles. Other works, including Eglƒó and La Karmesse, ou La Foire flamande, did not attract widespread critical acclaim however. Rather more successful were his tone paintings, performed in his capacity as an organ virtuoso, and Vogler played to packed houses around Europe in 1780s, although critical opinions remained mixed. In 1786 he was appointed Kapellmeister by Gustav III of Sweden and founded his second music school in Stockholm. His major composition of this period was Gustav Adolf och Ebba Brahe, as well as the Pieces de Clavecin and a series of organ studies and didactic works on musical theory. He attained extraordinary celebrity by his performances on an instrument called the \\"orchestrion\\", a species of organ invented by himself. As a member of the Swedish court he visited Saint Petersburg in 1788 where he met the Copenhagen organ builder Kirsnick (one of the first known to use free reeds in organ pipes). Starting in 1790 Vogler changed all the organs he performed on by adding new registers with free reeds. The first organ that was changed was in Rotterdam, and as many as 30 known rebuilds of organs followed. In 1790 he brought this instrument to London, and performed upon it with great effect at the Pantheon, for the concert-room where he also constructed an organ upon his own principles. The abb√©'s pedal-playing excited great attention. His most popular pieces were a fugue on themes from the Hallelujah Chorus, composed after a visit to the Handel festival at Westminster Abbey, and A Musical Picture for the Organ, by Knecht, containing the imitation of a storm. Georg Joseph Vogler In 1792 his royal patron was assassinated, and he embarked upon a series of ambitious travels extended over Spain, Greece, Armenia, remote districts of Asia and Africa, and even Greenland, in search of uncorrupted forms of national melody and the existing traces of ancient musical practices on which Western music was founded. These travels also supplied new exotic themes and folk music traditions that found their way into his later compositions. He returned to Stockholm and remained in residence there until 1799, before once more establishing himself in Germany, where his compositions, both sacred and dramatic, received at last full credit. He also wrote Choral-System in 1800 as a result of his new theory on choral accompaniment. He spent time in Vienna from 1802 to 1804, making the acquaintances of Haydn and Beethoven. His operas Castore e Polluce and Samori received popular acclaim there and he was to gain two ardent disciples ‚Äì Carl Maria von Weber and Johann Baptist G√§nsbacher. Under his tutelage, both would become well known composers in their own right. After Vienna, Vogler continued to travel around Germany. While at Frankfurt in 1807 he received an invitation from Ludwig I, grand duke of Hesse-Darmstadt, offering him the appointment of Kapellmeister, with the order of merit, the title of privy councillor, a salary of 3000 florins, a house, a table supplied from the duke's own kitchen, and other privileges, which determined him to bring his wanderings at last to a close. At Darmstadt he opened his third and most famous music school, the chief ornaments of which were G√§nsbacher, Weber, and Giacomo Meyerbeer. One of Vogler's last journeys was to Frankfurt in 1810, to witness the production of Weber's Sylvana. He continued to work hard in old age, and died suddenly of apoplexy at Darmstadt.

It is a fundamental concept in the existential philosophy of Martin Heidegger. Heidegger uses the expression Dasein to refer to the experience of being that is peculiar to human beings. Thus it is a form of being that is aware of and must confront such issues as personhood, mortality and the dilemma or paradox of living in relationship with other humans while being ultimately alone with oneself. Heidegger's reinterpretation In German, da sein is the vernacular term for \\"existence\\", as in \\"I am pleased with my existence\\" (Ich bin mit meinem Dasein zufrieden). The term has been used by several philosophers before Heidegger, most notably Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, with the meaning of \\"determined being\\" (bestimmtes Sein), The union of Being and Nothing (Quality).Hegel, G.W.F. 'Enzyklop√§die der philosophischen Wissenschaften I, Frankfurt am Main 2003, ¬ß 89 note, p.194: \\"Die Einheit des Seins und des Nichts, in der die Unmittelbarkeit dieser Bestimmungen und damit in ihrer Beziehung ihr Widerspruch verschwunden ist, - eine Einheit, in der sie nur Momente Sind\\" (The union of Being and Nothing, in which the immediateness of these determinations and so in their relation their contradiction is disappeared, - a union in which they are just aspects). It is derived from da-sein, which literally means \\"being-there\\"/\\"there-being\\"J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (1995) p. 70‚Äîthough Heidegger was adamant that this was an inappropriate translation of Dasein.Dreyfus, H. L., Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1990). Dasein for Heidegger can be a way of being involved with and caring for the immediate world in which one lives, while always remaining aware of the contingent element of that involvement, of the priority of the world to the self, and of the evolving nature of the self itself. The opposite of this authentic self is everyday and inauthentic Dasein, the forfeiture of one's individual meaning, destiny and lifespan, in favour of an (escapist) immersion in the public everyday world‚Äîthe anonymous, identical world of the They and the Them.J. Collins/H. Selina, Heidegger for Beginners (1998) p. 64-81 In harmony with Nietzsche's critique of the subject, as something definable in terms of consciousness, Heidegger distinguished Dasein from everyday consciousness in order to emphasize the critical importance \\"Being\\" has for our understanding and interpretation of the world, and so on. > \\"This entity which each of us is himself‚Ä¶we shall denote by the term > \\"Dasein\\"\\" (Heidegger, trans. 1927/1962, p.27).Heidegger, M. (1962). Being > and Time, Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson. London: S.C.M. > Press. \\"[Dasein is] that entity which in its Being has this very Being as an > issue‚Ä¶\\" (Heidegger, trans. 1927/1962, p.68). Heidegger sought to use the concept of Dasein to uncover the primal nature of \\"Being\\" (Sein), agreeing with Nietzsche and DiltheyJ. Collins/H. Selina, Heidegger for Beginners (1998) p. 48 that Dasein is always a being engaged in the world: neither a subject, nor the objective world alone, but the coherence of Being-in-the-world. This ontological basis of Heidegger's work thus opposes the Cartesian \\"abstract agent\\" in favour of practical engagement with one's environment.J. Collins/H. Selina, Heidegger for Beginners (1998) p. 61 Dasein is revealed by projection into, and engagement with, a personal worldH. Phillipse, Heidegger's Philosophy of Being (1999) p. 220.‚Äîa never-ending process of involvement with the world as mediated through the projects of the self. Heidegger considered that language, everyday curiosity, logical systems, and common beliefs obscure Dasein's nature from itself.J. Collins/H. Selina, Heidegger for Beginners (1998) p. 69-70 Authentic choice means turning away from the collective world of Them, to face Dasein, one's individuality, one's own limited life-span, one's own being.J. Collins/H. Selina, Heidegger for Beginners (1998) p. 81-9 Heidegger thus intended the concept of Dasein to provide a stepping stone in the questioning of what it means to be‚Äîto have one's own being, one's own death, one's own truth.E. Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan (2005) p. 96 Heidegger also saw the question of Dasein as extending beyond the realms disclosed by positive science or in the history of metaphysics. ‚ÄúScientific research is not the only manner of Being which this entity can have, nor is it the one which lies closest. Moreover, Dasein itself has a special distinctiveness as compared with other entities; [...] it is ontically distinguished by the fact that, in its very Being, that Being is an issue for it.‚ÄùHeidegger, Martin. \\"The Ontological Priority of the Question of Being.\\" Being and Time / Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson. London: S.C.M., 1962. 32 Being and Time stressed the ontological difference between entities and the being of entities: ‚ÄúBeing is always the Being of an entity.‚ÄùHeidegger, Martin. \\"The Ontological Priority of the Question of Being.\\" Being and Time / Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson. London: S.C.M., 1962. 29. Establishing this difference is the general motif running through Being and Time. Some scholars disagree with this interpretation, however, arguing that for Heidegger Dasein denoted a structured awareness or an institutional \\"way of life\\".See John Haugeland's article \\"Reading Brandom Reading Heidegger\\" Others suggest that Heidegger's early insistence on the ontological priority of Dasein was muted in his post- war writings.H. Phillipse, Heidegger's Philosophy of Being (1999) p. 44.  Origin and inspiration  Some have argued for an origin of Dasein in Chinese philosophy and Japanese philosophy: according to Tomonobu Imamichi, Heidegger's concept of Dasein was inspired‚Äîalthough Heidegger remained silent on this‚Äîby Okakura Kakuzo's concept of das-in-der-Welt-sein (being-in-the- worldness, worldliness) expressed in The Book of Tea to describe Zhuangzi's Taoist philosophy, which Imamichi's teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having followed lessons with him the year before.Tomonubu Imamichi, In Search of Wisdom.

Berrett-Koehler Publishers. \\"The third miracle is that living things exist that know they exist. As human beings conscious of ourselves, we represent the third miracle.\\" (p. 35).  Karl Jaspers' Dasein and Existenz  For Karl Jaspers, the term Dasein meant existence in its most minimal sense, the realm of objectivity and science, in opposition to what Jaspers called \\"Existenz\\", the realm of authentic being.Dimech, P., The Authority of the Saints: Drawing on the Theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar (Eugene, OR: Pickwick Publications, 2017), p. 47. Due to the drastically different use of the term Dasein between the two philosophers, there is often some confusion in students who begin with either Heidegger or Jaspers and subsequently study the other. In Philosophy (3 vols, 1932), Jaspers gave his view of the history of philosophy and introduced his major themes. Beginning with modern science and empiricism, Jaspers points out that as we question reality, we confront borders that an empirical (or scientific) method can simply not transcend. At this point, the individual faces a choice: sink into despair and resignation, or take a leap of faith toward what Jaspers calls \\"Transcendence\\". In making this leap, individuals confront their own limitless freedom, which Jaspers calls Existenz, and can finally experience authentic existence.  Other applications  Eero Tarasti considered Dasein very important in Existential Semiotics. Jacques Lacan turned in the 1950s to Heidegger's Dasein for his characterisation of the psychoanalyst as being-for-death: (√™tre-pour-la-mort).Roudinesco, √â., Jacques Lacan (1999) p. 249-50 Similarly, he saw the analysand as searching for authentic speech, as opposed to ‚Äúthe subject who loses his meaning in the objectifications of discourse...[which] will give him the wherewithal to forget his own existence and his own death‚Äù.Jacques Lacan, Ecrits (1997) p. 70Pettigrew, D., & Raffoul, F., eds., Disseminating Lacan (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1996), p. 60. Alfred Sch√ºtz distinguished between direct and indirect social experience, emphasising that in the latter, ‚ÄúMy orientation is not toward the existence (Dasein) of a concrete individual Thou. It is not toward any subjective experiences now being constituted in all their uniqueness in another's mind‚Äù.Sch√ºtz, A., The Phenomenology of the Social World (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1967), p. 183. Nader El-Bizri uses the existential analytic of Dasein in an interpretation of the conception of the 'soul' (nafs) in Avicenna's psychology that moves away from subjectivity towards what El-Bizri refers to as 'field-of-being' and 'soul- field'; see: N. El-Bizri, The Phenomenological Quest Between Avicenna and Heidegger (Albany: SUNY Press, 2014), 2nd print of the 2000 edition by Global Publications of the State University of New York, Binghamton, cf. p. 149. Criticism Theodor W. Adorno criticised Heidegger's concept of Dasein as an idealistic retreat from historical reality. Richard Rorty considered that with Dasein, Heidegger was creating a conservative myth of being, complicit with the Romantic elements of Nazism.

Early life Alfieri was born at Asti, Kingdom of Sardinia, now in Piedmont. His father died when he was very young, and he was brought up by his mother, who married a second time, until, at the age of ten, he was placed in the academy of Turin. After a year at the academy, he went on a short visit to a relative at Coni (mod. Cuneo). During his stay there he composed a sonnet chiefly borrowed from lines in Ariosto and Metastasio, the only poets he had at that time read. At thirteen, Alfieri began the study of civil and canon law, but this only made him more interested in literature, particularly French romances. The death of his uncle, who had taken charge of his education and conduct, left him free, at the age of fourteen, to enjoy his paternal inheritance, augmented by the addition of his uncle's fortune. He began to attend a riding-school, where he acquired an enthusiasm for horses and equestrian exercise that continued for the rest of his life. Having obtained permission from the king to travel abroad, he departed in 1766, under the care of an English tutor. Seeking novelty in foreign cultures, and being anxious to become acquainted with the French theatre, he proceeded to Paris, but he appears to have been completely dissatisfied with everything he witnessed in France and did not like the French people. In the Netherlands he fell in love with a married woman, but she went with her husband to Switzerland. Alfieri, depressed by the incident, returned home and again began studying literature. Plutarch's Lives inspired him with a passion for freedom and independence. He recommenced his travels; and his only gratification, in the absence of freedom among the continental states, came from contemplating the wild and sterile regions of the north of Sweden, where gloomy forests, lakes and precipices encouraged his sublime and melancholy ideas. In search of an ideal world, Alfieri passed quickly through various countries. During a journey to London he engaged in an intrigue with Lady Penelope Ligonier, a married woman of high rank. The affair became a widely publicised scandal and ended in a divorce that ruined Lady Ligonier and forced Alfieri to leave the country. He then visited Spain and Portugal, where he became acquainted with the Abbe Caluso, who remained through life the most attached and estimable friend he ever possessed. In 1772, Alfieri returned to Turin. This time he fell for the Marchesa Turinetti di Prie, but it was another doomed affair. When she fell ill, he spent his time dancing attendance on her, and one day wrote a dialogue or scene of a drama, which he left at her house. When the couple quarreled, the piece was returned to him, and being retouched and extended to five acts, it was performed at Turin in 1775, under the title of Cleopatra. Literary career Frontispiece for Works by Alfieri, 1809 edition The tomb of Vittorio Alfieri, Santa Croce, Florence From this moment Alfieri was seized with an insatiable thirst for theatrical fame, to which he devoted the remainder of his life. His first two tragedies, Filippo and Polinice, were originally written in French prose. When he came to versify them in Italian, he found that, because of many dealings with foreigners, he was poor at expressing himself. With the view of improving his Italian, he went to Tuscany and, during an alternate residence at Florence and Siena, he completed Filippo and Polinice, and had ideas for other dramas. While thus employed, he became acquainted with Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern, also known as the Countess of Albany, who was living with her husband, Charles Edward Stuart (\\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\"), at Florence. For her he formed a serious attachment. With this motive, to remain at Florence, he did not wish to be bound to Piedmont. He therefore ceded his whole property to his sister, the countess Cumiana, keeping for himself an annuity that was about half his original income. Louise, motivated by the ill-treatment she received from her husband, sought refuge in Rome, where she at length received permission from the Pope to live apart from him. Alfieri followed her to Rome, where he completed fourteen tragedies, four of which were published at Siena. For the sake of Louise's reputation, he left Rome, and, in 1783, travelled through different states of Italy, publishing six additional tragedies. The interests of his love and literary glory had not diminished his love of horses. He went to England solely for the purpose of purchasing a number of these animals, which he took back to Italy. On his return he learned that Louise had gone to Colmar in Alsace, where he joined her, and they lived together for the rest of his life. They chiefly passed their time between Alsace and Paris, but at length took up their abode entirely in that metropolis. While here, Alfieri made arrangements with Didot for an edition of his tragedies, but was soon after forced to quit Paris by the storms of the French Revolution. He recrossed the Alps with the countess, and finally settled at Florence. The last ten years of his life, which he spent in that city, seem to have been the happiest of his existence. During that long period, his tranquility was only interrupted by the entrance of the Revolutionary armies into Florence in 1799. Alfieri's political writings were among those which had contributed to the revolutionary atmosphere. His essay, Della Tirannide, denounced absolutism and was dedicated to liberty as a universal right. In Del Principe e delle Lettere, he declared poets to be the heralds of freedom and human dignity and the natural enemies of tyrants. He supported the American Revolution and wrote a collection of odes published as L‚ÄôAmerica libera and dedicated a play about the ancient Romans to George Washington. When the French Revolution broke out, he supported its initial liberal phase, but the violence of the Reign of Terror turned him strongly against the radical Jacobins. Despite Alfieri's increasingly anti-French sentiments, he was honored when the French army arrived in Italy and Napoleon himself attended a performance of Alfieri's Virginia, a play set in ancient Rome in which the people demand liberty and rise to overthrow a tyrant. Alfieri's ideas continued to influence Italian liberals and republicans such as Piero Gobetti throughout the Risorgimento and well into the twentieth century. He spent the concluding years of his life studying Greek literature and perfecting a series of comedies. His labor on this subject exhausted his strength and made him ill. He eschewed his physicians prescriptions in favor of his own remedies, which made the condition worse. He died in Florence in 1803. His last words were \\"Clasp my hand, dear friend, I am dying.\\" He is buried in the Church of Santa Croce, Florence next to Machiavelli. Character Alfieri's character may be best appreciated from the portrait he drew of himself in his own Memoirs of his Life. He was evidently of an irritable, impetuous, and almost ungovernable temper. Pride, which seems to have been a ruling sentiment, may account for many apparent inconsistencies of his character. But his less amiable qualities were greatly softened by the cultivation of literature. His application to study gradually tranquillized his temper and softened his manners, leaving him at the same time in perfect possession of those good qualities he inherited from nature: a warm and disinterested attachment to his family and friends, united to a generosity, vigour and elevation of character, which rendered him not unworthy to embody in his dramas the actions and sentiments of Grecian heroes. Contribution to Italian literature It is to his dramas that Alfieri is chiefly indebted for the high reputation he has attained. Before his time the Italian language, so harmonious in the Sonnets of Petrarch and so energetic in the Commedia of Dante, had been invariably languid and prosaic in dramatic dialogue. The pedantic and inanimate tragedies of the 16th century were followed, during the Iron Age of Italian literature, by dramas of which extravagance in the sentiments and improbability in the action were the chief characteristics. The prodigious success of the Merope of Maffei, which appeared in the commencement of the 18th century, may be attributed more to a comparison with such productions than to intrinsic merit. In this degradation of tragic taste the appearance of the tragedies of Alfieri was perhaps the most important literary event that had occurred in Italy during the 18th century. On these tragedies, it is difficult to pronounce a judgment, as the taste and system of the author underwent considerable change and modification in the intervals between the three periods of their publication. An excessive harshness of style, an asperity of sentiment and total want of poetical ornament are the characteristics of his first four tragedies, Filippo, Polinice, Antigone, and Virginia. These faults were in some measure corrected in the six tragedies he wrote some years after, and in those he published along with Saul, the drama that enjoyed the greatest success of all his productions. This popularity is partly attributable to Alfieri's severe and unadorned style, which fit the patriarchal simplicity of the age. Though there is a considerable difference in his dramas, there are certain qualities common to them all. None of the plots are of his own invention, but are founded either on mythological fable or history. Most of them had been previously treated by the Greek dramatists or by Seneca. Rosmunda, the only one that could be of his own contrivance, and which is certainly the least happy effusion of his genius, is partly founded on the eighteenth novel of the third part of Bandello and partly on Prevost's Memoires d'un homme de qualite. Another characteristic common to every Alfieri's tragedy is that the main character is always a tragic \\"hero of freedom\\", whose ambition and need of revolution push him to fight tyranny and oppression wherever they exist. Usually, this is accomplished in the most radical manner, up to killing the tyrant and face the death himself afterwards. This desire of freedom always bring the hero in a dimension of solitude, pessimism and internal torment, but he keeps going despite knowing that the majority of the people around him can't understand or share his views and struggles, or that his goals are almost impossible to reach. This concept is called titanism. But whatever subject he chooses, his dramas are always formed on the Grecian model, and breathe a freedom and independence worthy of an Athenian poet. Indeed, his Agide and Bruto may rather be considered oratorical declamations and dialogues on liberty than tragedies. The unities of time and place are not so scrupulously observed in his as in the ancient dramas, but he has rigidly adhered to a unity of action and interest. He occupies his scene with one great action and one ruling passion, and removes from it every accessory ‚Äî event or feeling. In this excessive zeal for the observance of unity he seems to have forgotten that its charm consists in producing a common relation between multiplied feelings, and not in the bare exhibition of one, divested of those various accompaniments that give harmony to the whole. Consistently with the austere and simple manner he thought the chief excellence of dramatic composition, he excluded from his scene all coups de theatre, all philosophical reflexions, and that highly ornamented versification so assiduously cultivated by his predecessors. In his anxiety, however, to avoid all superfluous ornament, he has stripped his dramas of the embellishments of imagination; and for the harmony and flow of poetical language he has substituted, even in his best performances, a style that, though correct and pure, is generally harsh, elaborate and abrupt; often strained into unnatural energy or condensed into factitious conciseness. The chief excellence of Alfieri consists in powerful delineation of dramatic character. In his Filippo he has represented, almost with the masterly touches of Tacitus, the sombre character, the dark mysterious counsels, the suspensa semper et obscura verba, of the modern Tiberius. In Polinice, the characters of the rival brothers are beautifully contrasted; in Maria Stuarda, that unfortunate queen is represented unsuspicious, impatient of contradiction and violent in her attachments. In Mirra, the character of Ciniro is perfect as a father and king, and Cecri is a model of a wife and mother. In the representation of that species of mental alienation where the judgment has perished but traces of character still remain, he is peculiarly happy. The insanity of Saul is skilfully managed; and the horrid joy of Orestes in killing Aegisthus rises finely and naturally to madness in finding that, at the same time, he had inadvertently slain his mother. Whatever may be the merits or defects of Alfieri, he may be considered as the founder of a new school in the Italian drama. His country hailed him as her sole tragic poet; and his successors in the same path of literature have regarded his bold, austere and rapid manner as the genuine model of tragic composition. Besides his tragedies, Alfieri published during his life many sonnets, five odes on American independence, one tramelogedia (Abele) and the poem of Etruria, founded on the assassination of Alexander, duke of Florence. Of his prose works the most distinguished for animation and eloquence is the Panegyric on Trajan, composed in a transport of indignation at the supposed feebleness of Pliny's eulogium. The two books entitled La Tirannide and the Essays on Literature and Government are remarkable for elegance and vigour of style, but are too evidently imitations of the manner of Machiavelli. His Antigallican, which was written at the same time with his Defence of Louis XVI, comprehends an historical and satirical view of the French Revolution. The posthumous works of Alfieri consist of satires, six political comedies and the Memoirs of his Life, work that will always be read with interest, in spite of the cold and languid gravity he applies to the most interesting adventures and strongest passions of his agitated life. Death Alfieri caught a \\"chill on his stomach\\" while out driving on 3 October 1803. His health deteriorated and he died in his chair on 8 October. He was buried in the church of Santa Croce, Florence. Louise arranged for Antonio Canova to erect a monument in his memory. This took 6 years to be executed, being finally installed in Santa Croce in the autumn of 1810.Vaughan, pp 246-252 Freemasonry The name of Vittorio Alfieri was never registered in the official publications of the Piedmont Freemasonry. It is proved Alfieri was initiated in the regular Masonic Lodge \\"Vittoria\\" of Naples which was an obedience of the Gran Loggia Nazionale \\"Lo Zelo\\", founded in 1874-185 by aristocrat Freemasons closely linked to the queen Maria Carolina of Austria.^Vittorio Gnocchini, L'Italia dei Liberi Muratori.

Many of Alfieri's friends were Freemasons, as it is attested by the documents conserved in the center of studies located in the town of Asti. The first edition of the Alfieri's tragedy was published in 1763 and sent to the following notable Freemasons: the von Kaunitz brothers of Turin, Giovanni Pindemonte e Gerolamo Zulian in Venice, Annibale Beccaria (brother of Cesare), Luigi Visconte Arese e Gioacchino Pallavicini in Milan, Carlo Gastone Rezzonico in Parma, Saveur Grimaldi in Genoa, Ludovico Savioli in Bologna, Kiliano Caraccioli which was Venerable Master in Naples, Giuseppe Guasco in Rome.R. Marchetti, Vittorio Alfieri, fratel massone, in Il Platano, anno VII, Asti, 1982. On August 27, 1782, the name of Alfieri is cited in the Tableau des Membres de la Respectable Loge de la Victoire √† l'Orient de Naples (\\"List of the members of the Venerable Lodge \\"Victoire\\" in the Orient of napes\\") as Comte Alfieri, Gentilhomme de Turin (count Alfieri, gentleman of Turin). Some months later, the Savoia dynasty banned any Masonic activity from the Piedmont and the Great Master count Asinari of Bernezzo was obliged to transfer his title to the prince Diego Naselli of Naples. Napes become the official seat of the Italian Scottish Rite Freemasonry.. Alfieri, Vita, Epoca I, Primi sintomi di carattere appassionato. His poetry Vita, published in 1775, says: The chapter continues mentioning the Scottish Rite degrees of Venerabile, primo Vigilante, Oratore and Segretario.

The vita was expanded by Philippe, abbot of Aum√¥ne. According to this biography, Amand was born in Lower Poitou. He was of noble birth but at the age of twenty, he became a monk on the √éle d'Yeu, against the wishes of his family. His father threatened to disinherit him if he did not return home.Kreiner, Jamie. The Social Life of Hagiography in the Merovingian Kingdom, Cambridge University Press, 2014, p. 207 From there Amandus went to Bourges and became a pupil of bishop Austregisilus. There he lived in solitude in a cell for fifteen years, living on no more than bread and water.Campbell, Thomas (1907). \\"St. Amandus\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1.

However, upon the death of his parents, he returned to his estates in M√©zi√®res sur Oise to settle some inheritance issues and found fine food, servants, and various conveniences sufficiently distracting that he gave up any thought of the monastic life, until one day Amandus took him on a pilgrimage to Rome.\\"Saint Humbert\\", Nominis Humbert became his disciple and companion.St. Humbert - Saints & Angels - Catholic Online Monks of Ramsgate. ‚ÄúHumbert of Marolles‚Äù.

After the pilgrimage to Rome, Amandus was made a missionary bishop in France in 628, without a fixed diocese.\\"Saint Amandus Recues a Man From Judicial Vengeance\\", Vengeance in Medieval Europe: A Reader, (Daniel Lord Smail, Kelly Gibson, eds.), University of Toronto Press, 2009, p. 115 At the request of Clotaire II, he evangelized the pagan inhabitants of Ghent, later extending his field of operations to all of Flanders. Initially, he had little success, suffering persecution and undergoing great hardships. However, after allegedly performing a miracle (bringing back to life a hanged criminal) the attitude of the people changed and he made many converts. He founded a monastery at Elnon where he served as abbot for four years. Amandus was made a bishop in 628.\\"Saint Amandus\\", Treasures of Heaven, Columbia University St. Amandus and the serpent, from a 14th-century manuscript He returned to France in 630. Amandus was a close friend of Adalbard of Ostrevent, whom he advised on the founding Marchiennes Abbey. Amandus angered Dagobert I by attempting to have the king amend his life. In spite of the intervention of Saint Acarius, Amand was expelled from the kingdom and went to Gascony.Fell, Charles and Challoner, Richard. \\"St. Amandus, Bishop\\", The Lives of Saints: Collected from Authentick Records of Church History, T. Osborne, 1750, p. 143 Later Dagobert asked him to return and tutor the heir to the throne. Amand however declined. In 633, Amandus founded two monasteries in Ghent; one at Blandinberg, and the other named for St. Bavo, who gave his estate for its foundation.Butler, Alban. \\"St. Amandus, Bishop and Confessor\\", The Lives of the Saints, Vol. III, 1866 His next missionary task was among the Slavic people of the Danube valley in present-day Slovakia but this was unsuccessful. Amand went to Rome and reported to the Pope. While returning to France, Amandus is said to have calmed a storm at sea. In 639, he built an abbey near Tournay. From 647 till 650, Amand briefly served as Bishop of Maastricht. The pope gave him some advice on how to deal with disobedient clerics and warned him about the Monothelite heresy, at that time prevalent in the East. Amand was commissioned by the pope to organize church councils in Neustria and Austrasia in order to pass on the various decrees from Rome. The bishops asked Amand to transmit the proceedings of the church councils to the pope. He resigned the see to St. Remaclus, to resume his missionary work. Around this time, Amand established contact with the family of Pepin of Landen and helped Gertrude of Nivelles and her mother Itta establishing the famous monastery of Nivelles. At the same time, he was now 70 years old, the inhabitants of the Basque country asked him to return to their country to evangelize, although 30 years earlier he had preached there in vain. Returning home, he founded several more monasteries in present-day Belgium with the help of king Dagobert. Amand died in Elnone Abbey (later Saint-Amand Abbey, in Saint-Amand-les-Eaux, near Tournai) at the age of ninety. The Vita of St. Aldegonde recounts that on the day of his death, Aldegonde was shown a vision of the missionary ascending to heaven. This account did much to further the cult of Amandus.Moreira, Isabel and Moreira, Isabelle. Dreams, Visions, and Spiritual Authority in Merovingian Gaul, Cornell University Press, 2000, p. 220 Veneration Known for his hospitality, Saint Amand is the patron saint of all who produce beer: brewers, innkeepers and bartenders.\\"Beer Saints\\", Brookston Beer Bulletin He is also the patron of vine growers, vintners and merchants, and of Boy Scouts. His feast day is 6 February. Although mostly revered in Flanders and Picardy, he is also venerated in England, where at least one private chapel (at East Hendred in Oxfordshire) is dedicated to him.

A 2006 report of an investigation by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight into Fannie Mae's accounting practices and corporate governance revealed that from 1998 to 2002 Gorelick received a total of $26.5 million in income from Fannie Mae. 9/11 Commission According to Gorelick's op-ed letter in the Washington Post she states that: \\"At last week's hearing, Attorney General John Ashcroft, facing criticism, asserted that 'the single greatest structural cause for September 11 was the wall that segregated criminal investigators and intelligence agents' and that I built that wall through a March 1995 memo.\\" However, the report from the 9/11 Commission, co-authored by Gorelick, asserts that the 'wall' limiting the ability of federal agencies to cooperate had existed since the 1980s and is in fact not one singular wall but a series of restrictions created over the course of over twenty years. =Conflict of Interest= A 1995 Department of Justice memorandum states that the procedures her memorandum put in place for the investigation of the 1993 WTC bombing \\"go beyond what is legally required...[to] prevent any risk of creating an unwarranted appearance that FISA is being used to avoid procedural safeguards which would apply in a criminal investigation.\\" The wall intentionally exceeded the requirements of FISA (the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978) for the purposes of criminal investigations, as well as the then- existing federal case law. These rules were, shortly after their creation, expanded to regulate such communications in future counter-terrorism investigations. Gorelick eventually recused herself from reviewing her own role in the regulation of information about terrorist activities. Attorney General Ashcroft was incensed before the 9/11 commission to learn that the commission had not investigated or been told of Gorelick's memo or her role regarding the \\"wall\\". This assertion was disputed by former senator Slade Gorton (R-WA), a member of the 9/11 Commission, who said, \\"nothing Jamie Gorelick wrote had the slightest impact on the Department of Defense or its willingness or ability to share intelligence information with other intelligence agencies.\\" Gorton also asserted that \\"the wall\\" was a long- standing policy that had resulted from the Church committee in the 1970s, and that the policy only prohibits transfer of certain information from prosecutors to the intelligence services and never prohibited information flowing in the opposite direction. Testifying before the commission, Attorney General John Ashcroft said, \\"Although you understand the debilitating impact of the wall, I cannot imagine that the commission knew about this memorandum, so I have declassified it for you and the public to review,\\" he said. \\"Full disclosure compels me to inform you that its author is a member of this commission.\\"August 18, 2005, letter to the editor in The Washington Times. Retrieved July 3, 2007 from Yahoo Cache.  Lawyer for Duke University  Gorelick was added in February 2006 to Duke University's defense team after the 2006 Duke University lacrosse case scandal. The University faced claims by unaccused members of the team that they \\"railroaded 47 Duke University students as either principals or accomplices.\\"Duke Adds to Legal Team in Lacrosse Lawsuit Fight:: WRAL.com Gorelick and her law firm left the defense team in July 2011 after Judge Beatty denied Duke's motions to dismiss and let the lawsuits proceed in April.  Lawyer for Jared Kushner  Gorelick represented Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of Donald Trump, as he considered a possible role in the White House. She had advised Kushner, who has sprawling financial interests in a multibillion-dollar global real estate empire, on how he might comply with federal ethics and anti-nepotism laws. She has argued that although officials leading federal agencies are barred from hiring relatives, the White House is not an agency and thus exempt. Gorelick argued that if Kushner forgoes a White House salary, he would not be bound by federal nepotism rules. Though Kushner has no experience in government or public policy, Trump directed that during his Presidential transition all foreign- policy matters be relayed through Kushner. Kushner participated in meetings between Trump and foreign heads of state while continuing to run the Kushner Companies. On July 14, 2017 Gorelick stepped away from the lead role in the Russian investigation and turned over all responsibilities to Abbe Lowell. Gorelick will still work on other matters for Kushner that she was originally retained for. In September 2017 she briefly fell for fake emails originating from \\"email prankster\\" James Linton purporting to be from Kushner but didn't reveal anything confidential.

Koolhoven was an aircraft manufacturer based in Rotterdam, Netherlands. From its conception in 1926 to its destruction in the Blitzkrieg in May 1940, the company remained the Dutch second major aircraft manufacturer (after Fokker). Although many of its aircraft were as unsuccessful economically as they were brilliant from a design standpoint, the company managed to score several 'hits', amongst them the FK-58 single-seat monoplane fighter, the FK-50 twin-engine passenger transport and the FK-41, built in England under licence by Desoutter. History In 1920, aircraft designer Frederick 'Frits' Koolhoven returned from England to his native Netherlands. The postwar years had not been good to him: The British Aerial Transport Company for which he was chief designer went bankrupt and all other manufacturers were struggling for survival too hard to think of hiring. The Netherlands, Koolhoven hoped, would be better. But there he found that while the Netherlands new airline KLM was a willing taker for all the aircraft it could get, the market was almost completely dominated by Fokker. Out of other options Koolhoven returned to his old job and worked as an automobile engineer for the Spyker automobile factory. In 1921, his luck began to change when a group of businessmen founded the N.V. Nationale Vliegtuig Industrie (\\"National Aircraft Industry, Incorporated\\"), and hired him as their chief designer. The time was still not yet ripe for a second Dutch aircraft manufacturer and, as with BAT, N.V.I. produced technically advanced designs that attracted attention from all over the world, but received virtually no orders. The company lasted only four years. At the demise of N.V.I. Koolhoven had become sufficiently business-aware to convince several of the N.V.I. shareholders that the company would still be viable, if only he would have complete control of the operations. Enough of the shareholders agreed and even while N.V.I. was being dissolved, its assets were almost immediately taken over by a new company: N.V. Koolhoven vliegtuigen (Koolhoven aircraft, Inc.). For its first five years, 1925 to 1930, the company managed to stay afloat by making one-off purpose-built airplanes to order, slowly branching out into the private aircraft sector and trying to break into the military market. In 1930, the company finally struck gold with the FK-41 high-wing tourist monoplane. Although N.V. Koolhoven itself only built 7 Fk-41's the airplane was built under licence in England as the Desoutter Mk.I and later improved as the Mk.II. By 1933 the military market had picked up and Koolhoven increasingly built trainers and observation aircraft for the Dutch air force as well as several other countries. By 1938, with war looming, the company's order books continued to fill as air forces from all over Europe were virtually fighting over each plane that rolled off the production line. Even France found itself buying Koolhoven FK-58 fighters as its own aircraft industry was unable to keep up with the demand from the Arm√©e de l'Air. In 1938, the Koolhoven factory at Waalhaven covered 8,000 square meters and had 1,200 employees. While still no match for Fokker, Koolhoven had established itself firmly as the number two manufacturer in the Netherlands. Koolhoven's concept 100 ton flying boat c.1938, cancelled as a result of technical difficulties. The end came on 10 May 1940. As a prelude to the German invasion of the Netherlands, the Luftwaffe set out to destroy as much as possible of the Dutch Air Force on the ground. On the morning of that day, a massive armada of German bombers appeared over Waalhaven and almost completely destroyed the airfield and its surrounding facilities. This included the Koolhoven factory and within a few hours, the company had been reduced to a pile of rubble and all drawings, models, and documentation of Koolhoven's projects were destroyed. Today, the only photographs remaining of Koolhoven's planes are newspaper clippings and private snapshots. Frederick Koolhoven died of a stroke on 1 July 1946. His company, although without means of production, continued to exist as a holding. Over the next ten years various attempts were made to start up new projects, but apart from the construction of two prototype sailplanes nothing happened and in 1956 N.V. Koolhoven Aeroplanes closed and was liquidated. Aircraft Apart from the Heidevogel of 1911, Koolhoven designed 59 aircraft, which he consecutively numbered FK-1 to FK-59. About half of these were design studies that were never built. Koolhoven designed projects FK-1 to FK-28 in England for Armstrong Whitworth and BAT, projects FK-29 to FK-34 for N.V.I. and projects FK-35 to FK-59 for his own company. The first 'true' Koolhoven airplane therefore would have been the FK-35. However, on formation of the N.V. Koolhoven, Frits Koolhoven took with him the design of the FK-30 \\"Toerist\\" light sportsplane original designed for NVI, but not built. Several \\"Toerists\\" built by the new FK Koolhoven therefore constitute the earliest airplanes of that company, if not by production date, then at least by numbering. The website of the Koolhoven foundation lists 26 Koolhoven designs, starting with the F.K.30 and then going from F.K.35 to F.K.59. It however also notes that the designs F.K.37, 38, 39 and 59 were never built, while only giving pictures of wooden models for the designs F.K.35 and F.K.36. Jane's Encyclopedia of Aviation only lists the Koolhoven designs F.K.40, 41, 42, 43, 46, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53 and 58 but mentions a F.K.50-b bomber project, which the Koolhoven foundation site doesn't. The best-known of those designs are the F.K.41 high- wing monoplane, which was built under licence as the Desoutter Mk.II and the F.K.50 twin engine transport monoplane, two of which were used by the Swiss aircraft company . Amongst the military designs, the most successful were the Koolhoven F.K.51 biplane reconnaissance aircraft, which saw service in extensive numbers in the Dutch air force from the mid-1930s until the Second World War, the Koolhoven F.K.52 biplane which was used by the Finnish Air Force and the Koolhoven F.K.58 single-seat monoplane fighter.

Landmarks and notable buildings Horham Hall Thaxted Parish Church is a fine example of English Perpendicular church architecture built between 1340 and 1510 and a testament to the prosperity of the town in the Middle Ages. It is one of the largest churches in Essex, 183 feet long and 87 feet wide with a spire reaching 181 feet up and is dedicated to St John the Baptist with Our Lady and St Laurence. Thaxted Guildhall is a timber-framed medieval moot hall that commands the main high street. It was built in the late 15th century, supposedly with funding from the vibrant cutlery industry, hence the assumption that it served the cutlers' guild. John Webb's Windmill is a restored brick tower mill, built in 1810, standing to the south of the church. The view of the windmill from the Bullring, framed by the almshouses, is a classic Essex postcard view. The Almshouses consist of the thatched Chantry House and the tiled Almshouse building of 1714, the latter still in use providing accommodation for elderly people. Horham Hall is a Grade I listed mansion at the southeast of Thaxted parish. It was rebuilt in brick by Sir John Cutte between 1510 and 1515, having previously been a timber-framed late‚Äì moated manor house. Clarence House is a Grade 1 listed Georgian townhouse in Watling Street, opposite the church. It was built in 1715 and retains many original features. Dick Turpin's Cottage is one of a group of timber-framed terrace houses in picturesque Stoney Lane, although its association with Dick Turpin is dubious.  Thaxted and Music  Gustav Holst lived in Thaxted from 1917 to 1925 In the twentieth century, Thaxted developed a musical tradition that can be traced back to the influence of the composer, Gustav Holst, and Conrad Noel, the vicar of Thaxted. In 1913, while on a walking holiday, Holst discovered the town and remained associated with it for the rest of his life. Encouraged by the vicar, Conrad Noel, a medievalist and folk-dancing and church music enthusiast, Holst had the idea of organizing a Whitsun festival there, bringing singers and players from St Paul‚Äôs Girls‚Äô School and Morley College in London to join with local people in a weekend of musical festivities. In 1916, once he had finished The Planets, he devoted time to writing and arranging music especially for Thaxted. The carols Bring us in good ale (dedicated to Conrad Noel), Lullay my liking, Of one that is so fair and bright and Terly, terlow were specifically written for Thaxted. His most outstanding achievement was This have I done for my true love (also dedicated to Noel), \\"an evocation of the medieval notion of dancing and religious worship being closely intertwined\\". Holst's daughter, Imogen Holst, a composer in her own right, also maintained links with the town. Although the Whitsun Festival was discontinued in 1918, the idea was revived in 1980 and flourishes as the Thaxted Festival. Thaxted is the name given to a hymn tune, a setting for \\"I Vow to Thee, My Country\\", which Holst composed, derived from his orchestral Planets suite.  Thaxted and Morris Dancing  The Thaxted Morris Men were formed in 1911 as part of the Morris dancing revival underway in the first half of the twentieth century. The Thaxted Morris is now the oldest revival side in the country. During the Great War, many active morris men were killed, and the Morris was predominantly women. By the 1930s, men predominated again. In 1934, the year that Holst died, the Cambridge Morris Men invited five other teams (Letchworth, Thaxted, East Surrey, Greensleeves and Oxford) to join them in the formation of a national organisation. Five of the six teams met at Thaxted on 11 May 1934 to inaugurate The Morris Ring. The Ring, which has grown to around 180 sides, organises regular meetings. The annual Thaxted Morris Weekend, which takes place on the Spring Bank Holiday weekend, welcomes sides from all over the United Kingdom and the world. The weekend consists of a series of dancing tours, in which teams dance in the villages surrounding Thaxted, before reconvening in the town. The final dance of the evening is always the evocative Abbots Bromley Horn Dance, performed by the host side from Thaxted, winding their way from the churchyard, down Stoney Lane and past the Guildhall, accompanied by a solitary fiddler. The Morris Weekend is a major tourist attraction pulling visitors to the town each year. Thaxted in Film The town and surrounding countryside feature in the documentary film Ripe Earth, directed and produced by the Boulting Brothers in 1938. The ten-minute film depicts the gathering of the harvest and the harvest festival celebration in the church, including Conrad Noel at the altar. The town was used as the location for the 1952 British comedy film Time Gentlemen, Please! The film was directed by Lewis Gilbert and starred Eddie Byrne, and also featured Dora Bryan and Sid James. Part of Passolini's The Canterbury Tales (I racconti di Canterbury) was filmed in Thaxted: the unrestored Windmill, with the church spire in the distance, formed the backdrop to the scene depicting the Summoner, the Devil and the Old Woman in The Friar's Tale, somewhat anachronistically since the tower mill is a nineteenth century structure of the Industrial Revolution that would have been unknown in Chaucerian times. Notable people A brass in Thaxted Church is reputed to be Robert Wydow. *Robert Wydow or Wedow (c. 1446 ‚Äì 1505), an English poet, church musician, and religious figure, was born in Thaxted and was vicar of the town from 1481 to 1489. He attended Eton College and King's College Cambridge, and is the first known recipient of a Bachelor of Music degree in England, awarded by Oxford University in 1478 or 1479. Wydow's contemporaries held him in high esteem as a poet and musician, describing him as \\"an excellent poet\\", and \\"easily the finest\\" of Latin authors of the time. However, only a few lines of his poetry survive and none of his music. The surviving brass in the Parish Church is reputed to be his likeness. Wedow Road, in the town, commemorates him. *Sir John Cutte (d. 1520), Under- Treasurer to Henry VII and Henry VIII, built Horham Hall on the site of an earlier house. His grandson, Sir John Cutte (1545-1615), hosted Queen Elizabeth I in 1571 (nine days) and 1578 (six days). *Samuel Purchas (1577‚Äì1626), English cleric and author, was born in the town. His works are an important source of information about the age of exploration. He was the son of an English yeoman. He graduated from St John's College, Cambridge, in 1600. *Dick Turpin (1705-39), the famous highwayman, was born in nearby Hempstead and was reputed to have run a butcher's shop in Thaxted. There is no evidence to support a connection with the house in Stoney Lane which carries his name. *John Fell (1733-97), Classical scholar and author, lived in Thaxted from 1770 as minister of the Congregationalist chapel. He was friends with Rayner Hickford, a Saxon scholar, who also lived in the town during this period. *Alfred Paget Humphry (1850-1916), barrister, is buried in Thaxted. He bought Horham Hall in 1905 and lived there until his death. He was a renowned champion rifle shooter and wrote First Hints at Rifle Shooting (1876). *Conrad Noel (1869‚Äì1942), Christian socialist, was known as the town's 'Red Vicar', serving in the post from 1910 until his death. He played a key role in the morris dancing revival in the town. He enjoyed the patronage of Daisy, Countess of Warwick, of Easton Lodge. *Launcelot Alfred Cramner-Byng (1872-1945), sinologist and author, lived at Folly Mill, near Monk Street. He translated many works of Chinese literature. *Gustav Holst (1874-1934), the British composer of The Planets, lived in The Manse (then called The Steps) in the High Street. His residency is marked by a blue plaque. His daughter, Imogen Holst, also lived in the town in her youth. *Alec Butler Hunter (1899-1958), textile designer, lived at Market Cross, a fine medieval house next to the Guildhall, from 1944 until his death. He worked for Warner & Sons, the textile manufacturer in nearby Braintree, and was a President of the Society of Industrial Artists. He was an active supporter of Morris dancing revival and the first Squire of the Morris Ring. The Alec Hunter Academy in Braintree is named after him. *Sir George Binney DSO (1900‚Äì 72), Arctic explorer, lived at Horham Hall from 1946 to 1969. *W. E. Shewell-Cooper (1900-82), gardener and pioneer of organic gardening, lived and worked at Prior's Hall, outside the town, from 1948 to 1960, where he ran a training college promoting organic horticulture. *Donald Hall (1928-2018), American poet and writer, spent a year in Thaxted between 1959 and 1960, during which time he wrote his collection of poems, A Roof of Tiger Lilies, and his short story collection, A String Too Short To Be Saved. His poem, An American in an Essex Village, describes a walk around the town at that time, including the church and the then derelict windmill whose \\"ruin appals only an eye which invents a landscape which needs it.\\" *Evelyn Anthony (Evelyn Bridgett Patricia Ward-Thomas) (1926-2018), novelist, lived at Horham Hall from 1968 to 1976 and again from 1982 to her death. Her most successful novel was The Tamarind Seed, which was made into a feature film. *Diana Wynne Jones, author of Howl's Moving Castle and other novels, was raised in the town. *Genista McIntosh, Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall, the Labour life peer, lived in Thaxted from 2002 to 2015.. She spoke in praise of Thaxted Parish Church in a debate in the House of Lords in 2014.  Industry and commerce  The prosperity of Thaxted was once built on the cutlery and wool trades but by the seventeenth century these had wained. By the nineteenth century, Thaxted was a depressed agricultural backwater. In 1870, George Lee opened a sweet factory in the town, which rapidly became the major employer. It saved Thaxted, became a major employer and led to the advent the light railway, with the support of the gin magnate, Sir Walter Gilbey, who imagined the line eventually extending from Elsenham, via Thaxted and Great Bardfield to connect with the Stour Valley Railway. Because the railway was promoted by a gin distiller and a confectioner, it was known by the locals as ‚ÄúThe Gin and Toffee Line‚Äù. The sweet factory closed in 1969 and its site, at the eastern entrance to the town, was used from 1976 to 2013 by a pharmaceutical company. It has since been redeveloped for residential use. Cedric Arnold, a pipe organ maker, had a workshop at Mill End for many years. He built one of the organs in the parish church.

John Harrison, see Viriconium. Viroconium or Uriconium, formally Viroconium Cornoviorum, was a Roman town, one corner of which is now occupied by Wroxeter, a small village in Shropshire, England, about east-south-east of Shrewsbury. At its peak, Viroconium is estimated to have been the 4th-largest Roman settlement in Britain, a civitas with a population of more than 15,000.Frere, Britannia, p.253 The settlement probably lasted until the end of the 7th century or the beginning of the 8th. Extensive remains can still be seen. Toponym Viroconium is a Latinised form of a toponym that was reconstructed as Common Brittonic *Uiroconion \\"[city] of *Uirok≈´\\". *Uirok≈´ ( \\"man-wolf\\") is believed to have been a masculine given name meaning \\"werewolf\\". The original capital of the local British tribe of the Cornovii was the impressive hillfort on the Wrekin known as *Uiroconion. When the Cornovii were eventually subdued by the Romans, their capital was moved to Wroxeter and given its Roman name. Hence the term \\"Cornoviorum\\" distinguishes the site as the Viroconium \\"of the Cornovii\\", the Celtic tribe whose settlement became civitas. History =Roman= Francis Bedford and digitally restored Wroxeter was first established in the early years of the Roman conquest of Britain as a frontier post for a cohort of Thracian Auxilia who were taking part in the campaigns of the governor, Publius Ostorius Scapula. The site is strategically located near the end of Watling Street, the primary Roman trunk road that ran across Britannia from Dubris (Dover). The post was a key frontier position because it defended the River Severn valley as it come out of Cambria (Wales) as well as protecting the route to the south that lead to the Wye valley. In the mid 1st century Legio XIV Gemina took over the site from the Thracian Auxilia in preparation for the invasion of Wales and replaced the fort with a legionary fortress. In 78 governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola led campaigns to suppress the tribes in North Wales and the druids on Ynys M√¥n. In 80 Agricola took Legio XIV Gemina north on his punitive expeditions against the Picts in Scotland. With the departure of Legio XIV Gemina, Legio XX Valeria Victrix took over the fortress. By the late 80s the fort had ceased to be used by the Roman army. In this period the canabae, or civilian settlement, that had grown up around the legionary fort began turning it into a town. Archaeological research has found that an unfinished legionary bath house in the centre of the town eventually became the town's forum. A decade later a civic street grid was subsuming the plan of the old legionary fort. The colonnaded forum was started in the 120s covering the unfinished bath house, and with the impressive dedicatory inscription to Hadrian found in excavations dating the completion to 130. By then the town had expanded especially under Emperor Hadrian to cover an area of more than . It then had many public buildings, including thermae. Simpler temples and shops have also been excavated. At its peak, Viroconium is estimated to have been the one of the richest and the fourth largest Roman settlement in Britain with a population of more than 15,000. Its wealth is surprising for what remained a frontier town and is perhaps explained by its access to Wales and to other trade routes. Between 165-185 the forum burned down, including neighbouring shops and houses, and many shop contents were subsequently found in excavations. The forum was rebuilt with several modifications. Following the end of Roman rule in Britain around 410, the Cornovii tribe divided into Pengwern (Shropshire) and Powys. This socio- political division started Viroconium's decline as an important settlement. =Early medieval period= Although Viroconium served as the early sub-Roman capital of Powys, variously identified with the ancient Welsh cities of Cair Urnarc or Cair Guricon which appeared in the Historia Brittonums list the 28 civitates of Britain.Nennius (). Theodor Mommsen (). Historia Brittonum, VI. Composed after 830\\\\. Hosted at Latin Wikisource. Viroconium became the site of the court of a sub-Roman kingdom known as the Wrocensaete, which was the successor territorial unit to Cornovia. Wrocensaete means the ‚Äòinhabitants of Wroxeter‚Äô. The Wroxeter Stone or Cunorix Stone, was found in 1967, with an inscription in an Insular Celtic language, identified by the Celtic Inscribed Stones Project (CISP) at UCL as \\"partly-Latinized Primitive Irish\\".CISP database, 'http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp/database/stone/wrxtr_1.html', recovered 14 Sep 2014 The inscription, probably on a re-used gravestone, is dated to 460-475 AD, when Irish raiders had begun to make permanent settlements in South Wales and south-western Britain.\\"Cunorix Stone\\", A History of Ireland in 100 Objects Town life in Viroconium continued in the fifth century, but many of the buildings fell into disrepair. Between 530 and 570, when most Roman urban sites and villas in Britain were being abandoned, there was a substantial rebuilding programme. The old basilica was carefully demolished and replaced with new timber-framed buildings on rubble platforms. These probably included a very large two-storey building and a number of storage buildings and houses. In all, 33 new buildings were \\"carefully planned and executed\\" and \\"skillfully constructed to Roman measurements using a trained labour force\\". Who instigated this rebuilding programme is not known, but it may have been a bishop. Some of the buildings were renewed three times, and the community probably lasted about 75 years until, for some reason, many of the buildings were dismantled. The site was probably abandoned peacefully in the second half of the seventh century or the beginning of the eighth.Archaeological assessment of Wroxeter, Shropshire The later minor Wreocens√¶te sub-kingdom of the Angles emerged in the area when Oswiu conquered Pengwern in 656. Eventually the court of the Kingdom of Powys moved to Mathrafal sometime before 717 following famine and plague in its original location. Preservation The recreation of a Roman town house at Viroconium Although archaeologist Philip A. Barker believed stonework from Viroconium Cornoviorum, was used to build the nearby parish churches of Atcham, Wroxeter, and Upton Magna some substantial remains are still standing. These include \\"the Old Work\\" (an archway, part of the baths' frigidarium and the largest free-standing Roman ruin in England) and the remains of a baths complex. These are on display to the public and, along with a small museum, are looked after by English Heritage under the name \\"Wroxeter Roman City\\". Some of the more important finds are housed in the Music Hall Museum in Shrewsbury. Most of the town still remains buried, but it has largely been mapped through geophysical survey and aerial archaeology. Archaeological research of the site is ongoing with further buildings being excavated. =Reconstructed villa= In February 2011 a reconstructed Roman villa was opened to the public to give visitors an insight into Roman building techniques and how the Romans lived. A Channel 4 television series entitled Rome Wasn't Built in a Day showed how it was built using authentic ancient techniques. The builders were assisted by a team of local volunteers and supervised by archaeologist Dai Morgan Evans, who designed the villa. Notes Bibliography * *Anderson, J. Corbet.

It is situated between the eastern edge of the New Forest and the River Test, close to the city of Southampton but outside the city boundary; the town is within the New Forest non-metropolitan district. Surrounding towns and villages include Ashurst, Marchwood, Cadnam and Ower. Description Totton claimed to be the largest village in England until it was made a town in 1974. The town is often considered to be made up of several smaller villages, such as Testwood, Calmore and Hammonds Green (as well as the original village of Totton) which have been connected by new clusters of housing to form the town as it is today. This is backed up by the presence of several areas of local shops, which served their respective villages in the past, and to an extent still do today. Until the 1967 forest perambulation fencing, New Forest ponies were free to roam its streets. The town's built up area has swollen significantly since the later half of the 20th century and now forms a near continuous web of development with surrounding villages, with Ower, Netley Marsh and Ashurst in particular having little or no discernible distinction in built up area. Totton's town centre has changed little since the 1970s. Commercial Road and the A35 causeway are the main exit routes from the town. The areas behind Calmore Industrial Estate by the River Test have been regenerated with lakes for boating, but their main use is for fishing and as a water supply resource. There is also the Testwood Lakes Centre, with walks along the Test Way running from Totton to Inkpen Beacon in Berkshire, via Romsey in Hampshire. Eling can be accessed by crossing the railway line which divides the original old village of Totton and the areas of Eling, and Hounsdown. This goes to Brokenford which has some pathways from Totton to the A35 Bypass road at Eling recreation ground, by Bartley Water. The village's name is pronounced the same as that of the London town and borough of Ealing. History =Early history= The Iron Age Hillfort at Tatchbury Mount is evidence of early settlement in the Totton area and Netley Marsh on the edge of Totton was the site of an early battle between Anglo Saxon invaders under Cerdic and Romano-Celtic peoples under Natanleod. The construction of Testwood Lakes revealed a treasure-trove of ancient artefacts including one of the oldest known bridges in England, believed to date to around c.1,500BC. The area's history is inevitably closely connected with ship and boat building but more with its timber trade. It was the site of much illegal dealing in the timber unlawfully obtained from the New Forest.TNA ADM 106/904/199, 238 Mr. Winnington.

St Mary's is a Norman church built on Saxon foundations with registers dating back to 1537. The Eling Tide Mill Experience is Eling Tide Mill, its visitor centre, and the outdoor walks around the mill pond at Bartley Water and the Solent Water shoreline at Goatee Beach. Eling Tide Mill is one of the very few working tide mills in the UK but cannot be equated with the mill listed in the Domesday Book.\\" Hampshire's only surviving medieval toll bridge is here, across Bartley Water by the side of the Tide Mill. This has been in use since at least 1418 and still charges users today. The Eling Tide Mill Experience was closed for refurbishment from 2015 and reopened 9 April 2018. =Recent history= The original village of Totton can be described as the areas of Totton, Testwood and the Salmon Leap, dissected by the A36 and the A336 and bordered by the River Test. From this, many new developments were made to expand the town. The Calmore estate was built in the early 1970s to the north of the town, and subsequent housing has merged the estate to the town as a whole. Extended housing to the Hounsdown region also occurred during the 1970s, with the construction of the school and the increased housing found there. In the late 1980s and 1990s, more housing was built to the west of the town towards Netley Marsh and along Ringwood Road. These developments, collectively referred to as West Totton, consisted of a new communal area and church and hall as well as huge amounts of new homes. New Developments on the former BAT sports ground and Little Testwood Farm by Linden Homes is set to take the population of the town to a new high of over 29,000 people. Despite this no new facilities are to be provided, and the current ones will, as a result, be put under greater pressure. Since the end of World War II, the town has emphasised its connections and proximity to Southampton, due to the prosperity to be found there, but more recently ‚Äì particularly since the building of West Totton transformed the area beyond all recognition ‚Äì the Totton and Eling community has attempted to return to its roots as a smaller independent New Forest settlement. Transport Totton and Eling is served by the railway at Totton railway station, on the South Western Main Line to Southampton, London Waterloo, Bournemouth and Poole, and is run by South Western Railway. Bus services in the town are run by two main companies. Bluestar operate services to Southampton, Cadnam, Hythe, Dibden and around the town. Wilts & Dorset also operate cross county routes to Salisbury The town has easy access to the nearby M27 motorway, to Salisbury via the A36 Salisbury Road, to Lyndhurst and Southampton via the A35 and to the Waterside region by the A326. The town also has numerous cycle routes, which started with the suburban cycleway through West Totton, constructed when the estate was built and running from Hounsdown to Calmore Road. This has further been extended to two on-road routes to the centre of Totton from Calmore schools down Water Lane, and down Salisbury Road. In addition, there are several links to the New Forest cycle network at Ashurst and Foxhills. Sport One of the most successful sporting enterprises of the area has been Totton and Eling Cricket Club. Under its former guise of B.A.T. Sports, it won the Southern Premier League, the highest level of club cricket in the Hampshire area, four times in six seasons between 2001 and 2006. In September 2007 Totton and Eling C.C. became North Gear National 2020 Champions beating Ockbrook & Borrowash in the live televised final on Sky Sports. Totton also has two local football teams, A.F.C. Totton who play at Testwood Stadium and Totton & Eling F.C. who play at Little Testwood Farm. In 2007, AFC Totton made it to the final of the FA Vase and so had the chance to play in the second competitive match at Wembley Stadium. The club were previously based at a ground in the centre of the town, however moved in 2011 to a new stadium with stand and several training pitches near the outskirts of the town in Calmore. The ground reportedly cost ¬£2.5 million. There is also a rugby club, Tottonians, operating from grounds at Totton College. Schools There are two secondary schools and a sixthform college within the parish. Testwood School is in the north of the town was built in the 1940s, and gained Sports College status in 2004. This resulted in improvement of facilities including building of a synthetic turf pitch and an extension to the sports hall. The Testwood school logo includes the river, the wood and salmon, indicating the nearby River Test and the salmon leap. Testwood hires out its sporting facilities after hours, namely the synthetic turf pitch, which is used frequently by the community. Testwood's pupils mainly come from the central Totton and Calmore areas. Hounsdown School, a Specialist Science College, built in 1963,opened in 1969 is located in the Hounsdown area of the town, south of the A35. It too has experienced expansion in recent years, including the construction of a new sports hall. The Hounsdown logo is of a stylised, curved triangle. Hounsdown also hires out its sporting facilities after school, namely the swimming pool, which is used frequently by the local community and groups. Hounsdown's catchment area covers Hounsdown village, Eling, West Totton and Ashurst. The sixth form college, Totton College, opened in 1955 as Totton Grammar School to provide selective education, when grammar schools were phased out it changed status to a 16- 19 yr old FE college. Religion The town has a number of churches in the area, the biggest and oldest being St. Mary the Virgin church in Eling. Other Anglican churches in the town include the church of St. Anne in Calmore, the church of St. Matthew in Netley Marsh and the church of St. Winfrid in Testwood. These churches form the Team parish of Totton and are part of the Diocese of Winchester. In addition to these, there is also Testwood Baptist Church and Trinity Church in West Totton (Methodist/URC). =St. Mary the Virgin Church= View across Eling Creek to the church of St Mary the Virgin St Mary the Virgin is the oldest of the churches in the Totton area. Several years ago during the reordering of the church, part of a Celtic cross dating back to the 9th (possibly the 6th) century was found. The site of St Mary's has been a place of Christian worship since that date. The church building has Saxon origins. Today the church stands on the hill looking out over the bay to the container port on the Southampton side of Millbrook. The church has a modern interior with a light, open effect and the traditional stone, including a Saxon arch. St Mary the Virgin Church is a part of the Anglican team ministry that covers the town of Totton and Eling with 38,000 people within its area. Historically the mother church to the area, St Mary's is now one of four churches in the team ministry along with Calmore, Netley Marsh and Testwood. In 2003 two self-styled 'vampires' were imprisoned for harassment of the vicar of St Mary's and his family. References External links *Official Totton & Eling Town Council Website.

It is actually north of Grandview, still within the city limits of Kansas City. After several years of reconstruction, the interchange itself is largely congestion free during non-peak hours despite the high traffic on the highways approaching the interchange. During rush-hour moderate to major delays and numerous accidents are reported. The name \\"Three Trails Crossing\\" refers to the Santa Fe, Oregon, and California Trails that cross there. It is a major interchange of five major highways in the Kansas City area: I-49, I-435, I-470, US 50, US 71, and Missouri State Highway W. I-49/US 71 brings in traffic from the southeastern suburbs of the Kansas City area in Jackson and Cass counties. I-49 currently ends at the triangle, but the road continues northwest into Kansas City as US 71\\\\. The I-49 designation went into effect in December 2012. I-435 is a beltway around the Kansas City metropolitan area. I-470 is a major traffic corridor that connects southern Kansas City to the suburbs of eastern Jackson County, mainly Lee's Summit. US 50 travels concurrently with I-435 entering the Triangle, and then travels concurrently with I-470 at Exit 71A. State Highway W, also known as Bannister Road, which forms the northern leg of the triangle, is a major east-west arterial thoroughfare through southern Kansas City, and also serves as a detour for traffic seeking an alternate route when I-435 is congested. The 3-Trails Crossing currently handles approximately 250,000 vehicles per day. Now that the reconstruction is completed, the interchange should be able to accommodate more than 400,000 vehicles per day.

He is best known for his work under the stage name Har Mar Superstar. Life and career Sean Tillmann is known in the United States' independent music community as a singer-songwriter (other projects include Calvin Krime and Sean Na Na), but is best known by his alter ego Har Mar Superstar. Har Mar Superstar is a character who often performs his shows shirtless. His primary musical genres are contemporary R&B; and pop music. He originally claimed to be Sean Tillmann's twin brother, Harold Martin Tillmann, from which he claimed his name originated. The name actually comes from a shopping center in Roseville, Minnesota, called the Har Mar Mall. Tillmann was born in Marshall, Minnesota, on February 6, 1978 at Weiner Memorial Hospital. In 1987, his family moved to Owatonna, Minnesota. He graduated from the Perpich Center for Arts Education in Golden Valley, Minnesota. His family is still based in Owatonna, where his mother and father work as educators. After playing in a number of garage bands throughout high school, Tillmann moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota, and joined three-piece noise band Calvin Krime as bassist and lead vocalist. Over the span of three-and-a-half years, they recorded two albums and an EP and regularly toured the country. When Calvin Krime disbanded in 1998, Tillmann explored his softer pop side in Sean Na Na, but, while the music was often pretty and upbeat, the lyrics were often unexpectedly dark. Tellingly, Sean Na Na performances often ended with dead-on renditions of popular R&B; artist R. Kelly's \\"When a Woman's Fed Up.\\" Reflecting on what led to the creation of the Har Mar Superstar character, Tillmann said, \\"I kinda always thought that (I was going to do R&B;), I just had to figure out how to do it ... I just had to figure out how to make beats and write songs in that style.\\" In 2000, Tillmann enlisted the help of several Saint Paul musician friends and the result was the pseudonymously self-titled album \\"Har Mar Superstar\\" that appeared on Kill Rock Stars in 2001. Soon, Tillmann was touring all over the United States as Har Mar Superstar. Initially, he appeared onstage in a choir robe and was accompanied solely by pre-recorded beats emanating from his MiniDisc player. After his follow-up album, You Can Feel Me, elevated Har Mar's popularity in the United States and put him on the map in the United Kingdom, his stage outfits became more theatrical and several live shows featured female dancers. By the time the third album, The Handler, was released in 2004, Har Mar Superstar regularly toured with a drummer and a bassist to fortify the prerecorded material. Shows have ranged from club dates to festival engagements (Reading and Leeds Festivals). In addition to his own headlining tours, Har Mar has opened for Ben Lee, The Strokes, Incubus, Tenacious D and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. In 2007, Har Mar Superstar supported the Red Hot Chili Peppers on their tour of Australia and New Zealand. Fabrizio Moretti (The Strokes) and Tony Bevilacqua (ex- Distillers) have served as Har Mar's rhythm section, playing drums and bass guitar respectively. Har Mar supported Sia Furler on her 2008 tour with Denver Dalley on bass and Nick Slack on drums. Other bassists have included Jenni Tarma, Jeff Quinn, and John Fields, while Bert Thomas, Jeff Brown and Michael Bland have manned the drum stool. As well as being a solo artist, Har Mar Superstar is a songwriter. He has written songs for artists including The Cheetah Girls, Jennifer Lopez, Kelly Osbourne, and Ben Adams. While \\"Tall Boy\\" was rejected by Britney Spears's management, Har Mar decided to record the song for his own album, Dark Touches. In 2008, Har Mar Superstar was part of the live touring set-up of Neon Neon: the band created by Super Furry Animals' Gruff Rhys and producer/solo artist Boom Bip. Har Mar sings plus plays percussion during live shows and is featured on the recorded version and video of \\"Trick for Treat\\": a song on the band's debut album, Stainless Style, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2008. Har Mar also performed backing vocals and appeared in the video for \\"Catch My Disease\\" by Ben Lee. Har Mar's fourth studio album, Dark Touches, was released on October 12, 2009, in the UK and on October 13, 2009, in the U.S. Playing cities throughout the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom in 2009 and 2010, Har Mar's \\"Dark Touches\\" touring band features Denver Dalley on guitar, Jeff Quinn on bass and Will Rockwell-Scott on drums. In February 2011, Har Mar started recording and performing with the soft rock-inspired band Gayngs and experimental rock group Marijuana Deathsquads. Har Mar and Marijuana Deathsquads teamed up for month- long residencies in Los Angeles at Spaceland (February 2011), in New York City at Bowery Electric (October 2011) and in Austin, Texas (February 2012). Har Mar and Father John Misty joined forces for a tour in May 2012. While Sean Tillmann and J. Tillman are not related, the tour was informally referred to as the \\"Two Tillman(n)s Tour.\\" Har Mar performed material from his upcoming soul album \\"Bye Bye 17,\\" and his band consisted of Macey Taylor on bass, Jeff Quinn on guitar, and J. Tillman on drums. Har Mar's fifth album, Bye Bye 17, was released April 23, 2013 on Julian Casablancas' Cult Records. Tillmann toured the new material throughout the United States in March, April and May 2013 with Denver Dalley on bass, Jeff Quinn on guitar and Ryan McMahon on drums. In August and September 2013, Har Mar Superstar supported his friends the Yeah Yeah Yeahs on various tour dates. Har Mar and Lizzo toured the U.S. in September and October. A 14-date tour of the United Kingdom followed in November. At the end of 2014, Har Mar started writing songs for a new album and toured the U.S. with The Pizza Underground. Collaborating once again with Julian Casablancas, Tillmann released his sixth Har Mar album ‚Äì Best Summer Ever‚Äîon April 15, 2016. Best Summer Ever, since its inception, has been imagined as a \\"Greatest Hits of Har Mar Superstar from 1950‚Äì1985,\\" even though Tillmann was born in 1978. Touring the United States & Europe in support of the new album, Har Mar has enlisted six other musicians to bring the songs to life. Television, film and commercials Over the years, Sean Tillmann has performed on several television shows, including The Sharon Osbourne Show, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, and Jimmy Kimmel Live! in the United States. In the United Kingdom, he has appeared on Channel 4 music programme Born Sloppy, Bo' Selecta!, and Friday Night with Jonathan Ross. In 2003 and again in 2014, he was a guest on Never Mind the Buzzcocks. Har Mar has been spokesman for Vladivar Vodka, who produced a series of television commercials that gained an underground cult appreciation for their blatantly sexual content. Har Mar has also been a spokesman for Lynx brand deodorant in the UK. He made a cameo in the 2004 movie Starsky and Hutch as 'Dancing Rick', a disco dance champion who faces off in a contest with Ben Stiller's character. Har Mar played a Roller Derby coach in Whip It, a film by Drew Barrymore. On October 26, 2009, Har Mar Superstar was the musical guest on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and earned rave reviews for his performance of \\"Tall Boy,\\" immediately increasing his popularity within North America as noted in an article by MTV. In 2012, Har Mar appeared in the film Pitch Perfect as Clef No. 2 (a member of an older a cappella quartet), alongside Joe Lo Truglio, Jason Jones, and Donald Faison. In October 2014, Har Mar returned to Never Mind the Buzzcocks alongside Nicole Scherzinger, Kerry Godliman & James Acaster. In the Season 3 premiere of Broad City, Har Mar played hipster gallery patron \\"Oy Bomb,\\" a reference to the similarly named Soy Bomb who crashed Bob Dylan's 1998 Grammy performance. Har Mar performs the theme song, and is the lead character of the \\"Skeleton Crew\\" band, for the 2017 Netflix revival of Mystery Science Theater 3000.

It is located to the north of the Bridgewater Canal and to the south of the Manchester Ship Canal, which divides Stockton Heath from Latchford and north Warrington. It has a total resident population of 6,396. Victoria Square is at the centre of Stockton Heath and is on the crossroads of the A49 and A56. Until the 1970s, the Victoria Hotel stood on this square but its location has been redeveloped. North of the square is the main shopping area which includes the Forge Shopping Centre, developed on the site of the old forge (Caldwell's). Stockton Heath is home to a number of modern bars and restaurants, as well as traditional public houses. The Red Lion Inn dates back to the early 19th century and the Mulberry Tree on Victoria Square, opened in its present building (replacing earlier premises dating from 1725) in March 1907 . Since 1988, much of the centre of Stockton Heath has been designated a conservation area to preserve its character but, at the same time, there has been redevelopment work with several new bars and restaurants moving into the centre of Stockton Heath. Victoria Square, London Road History A Roman road ran through Stockton Heath, along the route now known (appropriately) as Roman Road. There have been some excavations; more information is available at Warrington Museum.

Although the name Stockton Heath appears to have been conferred on the village at a later date (indeed the area itself has been described rather as \\"a hamlet of little consequence and no development until the 19th century\\"), many secondary references state that a family bearing the name Stockton lived in the area from the end of the 13th century until at least the end of the 15th.http://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/archive/2006/06/12/History+%28History%29/791605.What_s_in_a_name_/ In 1643, parliamentarian forces under the command of Sir William Brereton advanced from Northwich to launch an attack on Warrington, the Lancashire headquarters of the royalist leader James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby. Sir William's troops were routed at the \\"Battle of Stockton Heath\\".An account of the Warrington Siege, by James Kendrick M.D., A new edition by H. Wells, published 1996 with an appendix containing Beamont's account of the Battle of Stockton Heath, updating James Kendrick's original paper (first published 1852) Unverified local legend has it that many of the parliamentarian soldiers were buried at Hill Cliffe and Budworth. The battle is referred to in the 1859 novel Hollywood Hall by James Grant: \\"A priory, situated in a wooded hollow, ruined and battered as the Royalists had left it in 1643, next caught my eye, when, riding rapidly on, I approached a wide waste common called Stockton Heath, past which the Mersey rolled amid swamps and morasses filled with rushes and willows.from: Hollywood Hall by James Grant, Published 1859, Routledge, Warnes & Routledge, Farringdon Street, London\\" The same novel frequently refers to Stockton Heath as a \\"waste\\" and makes numerous references to swamps nearby. This description contrasts sharply with the variants of \\"fashionable shopping village\\" frequently encountered in the literature of estate agents today. Early maps refer to a hamlet by the name of StokenTHE COUNTY PALATINE OF CHESTER By H. Moll, 1724. (or StockenA Map of Cheshire, Thomas Badeslade & W.H. Toms, 1742) where the present village of Stockton Heath now stands. However, more detailed old maps of the area of Acton Grange show a sparsely populated hamlet and refers only to the old buildings and bridges recognisable today in street names in the area, such as Whitefield Cottage.

In 1974, Stockton Heath, historically part of Cheshire, became incorporated into the borough of Warrington under the Local Government Act 1972. Warrington, historically part of Lancashire, became a Cheshire borough under the act. 2008 saw the first ever Stockton Heath Festival, which is now going into its twelfth year. It is situated on Mill Lane Field in Stockton Heath, although it takes place over many venues throughout Grappenhall, Appleton and Stockton Heath. In 2011, the Stockton Heath Festival attracted 12,000 visitors. Schools The original LEA primary school of 1910 was demolished in October 2008, despite a strong campaign to retain it, after a new school had been built adjacent. There is also St Thomas C of E Primary School now located next to Alexandra Park. This was opened in 1974 and moved from its original site opposite St Thomas' Church. The original St Thomas' school was opened in 1833 and the building was eventually demolished (along with a late Victorian extension) in the late 1970s. On its site now stands a modern health centre. Geography and administration On the south side of the Manchester Ship Canal, Stockton Heath adjoins Appleton, Grappenhall and Walton. It typically takes between seven and ten minutes on the bus and about twenty-five to thirty-five minutes on foot to reach Warrington town centre. =Political representation= Stockton Heath forms part of the Warrington South parliamentary constituency which is represented in the House of Commons by Andy Carter (Con). Stockton Heath is a multi-member ward within Warrington borough. It is served by two councillors, currently Celia Jordan (Liberal Democrat Party) and Laurence Murphy (Labour Party).

It is the smallest community by population in Britain with a town council. Its population increased by 30 between 2001 and 2011. Although many miles inland, it was the main port for Canterbury, which traded directly with London and Channel ports and indirectly with the near Continent, before the Wantsum Channel silted up making the Isle of Thanet part of mainland England. History Fordwich is listed in the 1086 Domesday Book as a small village.Open Domesday Online: Fordwich, accessed January 2019. The town grew in the Middle Ages as a port for boats on their way upriver to Canterbury. All of the Caen stone used by the Normans to rebuild Canterbury Cathedral in the 12th and 13th centuries was landed at Fordwich. It later became a limb of the Cinque Ports. It lost its status as a town in 1880 when it no longer had a Mayor and Corporation. However, in a reorganisation in 1972, Fordwich was again made a town as much as anything because of its prior importance in what is now a rather sleepy corner of Kent. Fordwich Town Hall, supposedly the smallest in England, dates from the earlier period, having been rebuilt in 1555. The ancient Church of St Mary the Virgin, now redundant but open to the public, and in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust, contains part of a carved sarcophagus reputed to have contained the remains of St Augustine of Canterbury. The 16th-century building next the Town Hall, now known as Watergate House, was the family home of John and Gregory Blaxland, early 19th-century pioneers of Australia. Culture and community Bridge over the Stour There are two pubs in the town, the George & Dragon and Fordwich Arms. Fordwich gained angling and fishing repute (from Izaak Walton) for its 'Fordwich trout', one of the largest types found. Fordwich has been the subject for a series of children's books by author F.J. Beerling. Inspired by the beautiful Kentish countryside and against the backdrop of the river Stour, Beerling fell in love with the old-world charm that Fordwich has, along with the even older charm of the Fordwich Town Hall building.

He was portrayed by series creator Joel Hodgson. Overview The show's theme song explains Joel's backstory: Formerly a janitor and inventor for Gizmonic Institute, Joel was launched into space by his boss Dr. Clayton Forrester and co-worker Dr. Laurence Erhardt ‚Äì later replaced by TV's Frank ‚Äì as part of an experiment to see which bad movies were capable of destroying the human mind. Joel built the 'Bots Tom Servo, Crow, Gypsy, and Cambot to keep him company, but in doing so used parts that apparently caused him to lose the ability to control when the films would stop and start. Though bombarded with many horrible films, he tends to take his captivity in benign stride, delivering most of his riffs in deadpan, holding no ill will against his captors and even affectionately calling them \\"the Mads\\" (among other amusing nicknames such as \\"the Overlords\\") while riffing on popular culture (\\"Auntie Em and Toto\\") or things found in Minnesota (\\"Milavetz and Associates\\", a prominent Twin Cities- area law firm). As the opening theme song said, Joel generally wore a red jumpsuit during most of his time as host, but on occasion would wear other colors, such as tan (during the show's first improvisation season on KTMA) or green or bright aqua colored (often worn during Season 2). From season 2 episode 212 through his departure in episode 512, Joel wore a darker, maroon- colored jumpsuit, though the original red jumpsuit (and second season green one) remained in the show's intro and opening theme. Joel was the host from 1988‚Äì93. Episode #512, Mitchell, was his final episode as host; beginning with the following episode (#513 The Brain That Wouldn't Die) he was replaced by Mike Nelson, played by series head writer Michael J. Nelson. During Mitchell, Gypsy overheard The Mads talking about eliminating Mike, the temp worker who was assisting them with an \\"evil-scientist audit\\". Hearing them refer to Mike as a \\"be-jumpsuited fool\\" and thinking they were actually talking about Joel, she struggled to think of some way to help Joel escape his alleged fate. Joel escaped the Satellite of Love (SOL) in a previously undiscovered escape pod (named the Deus Ex Machina) mislabeled as a crate of \\"Hamdingers\\" that Mike told Gypsy about. Mike managed to override The Mads' control over the SOL so that Gypsy could get Joel into the escape pod and launch it. After Joel's departure from the SOL, the Mads tried to \\"rescue\\" him, but gave up seconds later when they discovered that he had already safely landed in the Australian Outback. Instead of killing Mike, as they initially planned, they sent him up to take Joel's place. After Joel's departure he returned just once, in the show's final season (episode 1001: Soultaker), having turned the escape pod into a makeshift spaceship. He returned to the SOL to make repairs to parts that were programmed to self-destruct a decade after the ship's launch into orbit and give Mike a pep talk, after which he left the satellite through the corridor to the theater, where he had entered it earlier in that episode. Joel reported that, since leaving the ship, he had traveled around the Australian outback, doing pyrotechnics for the band \\"Man or Astro-man?\\", and that he was currently working as a manager at a Hot Fish Shop in Osseo, Minnesota. (In reality, the most famous Hot Fish Shop in Minnesota had closed the weekend that episode 1001 aired, although the shop was located in Winona, Minnesota, rather than Osseo.) After his departure, Joel was never directly mentioned until his appearance in Soultaker. However, he was indirectly referred to in the episode Santa Claus when Gypsy gives Mike a sweater as a gift, with the word \\"Joike\\" written on it, explaining that she had started knitting it when \\"the other guy\\" was present, but finished it after Mike's arrival. He was again indirectly referenced in Time Chasers by Mike's brother Eddie (who, due to a time travel mistake caused by Crow, was now in Mike's place on the SOL), who called him the \\"sleepy-eyed guy\\". After his visit in Soultaker, he was mentioned again in episode 1004 (Future War) during the film's credits. Mike attempts to do something Joel-esque, worrying the Bots, and Crow eventually asks if this has anything to do with Joel stopping by recently. Joel was referenced again in episode 1008 (Final Justice), when Mike believed he could escape after \\"suffering though a horrible Joe Don Baker movie\\" like Joel had previously (the Bots revealed that Mike's escape pod was actually the ship's water heater). Joel's tenure as host was marked by \\"invention exchanges\\", during which Joel and his mad scientist tormentors would come up with wacky inventions in a contest with each other. These sketches were a good match for Hodgson, who began his career as a prop comic; indeed, many of the inventions were items originally found in his standup act. The gag remained during the early episodes with Mike as host, but was done away with (since the writers wanted to focus on Mike's strengths in portraying various comic characters), as were any references to the Gizmonic Institute, to which Hodgson owned the rights. The in-show reasoning behind the disposal of invention exchanges was that they were part of Gizmonic corporate culture, about which Mike (having never worked at the Institute) knew nothing. Another change was the relationship between host and bots; whereas Joel was more of a parental authority figure to Crow and Servo (in keeping with his status as their creator), the pair treated Mike more as a peer, occasionally subjecting him to pranks which they never would have considered playing on Joel. Joel's \\"sleepy eyed\\" persona was reportedly the result of Hodgson staying up all night working non-stop on the pilot, which was kept after the pilot was shot because the crew and other performers thought it was funny. Off-camera, Hodgson wears eyeglasses, which were occasionally seen when he turns his head in profile during scenes in the theater, but was very frequently seen in the Kickstarter videos and other promotional appearances.  Name  In the pilot episode of MST3K, Hodgson simply used his real name. During its run on KTMA and the first season on the nationally broadcast Comedy Channel, Joel's last name was never mentioned on air. During the second nationally broadcast season, his character began using the surname Robinson, after the protagonist of Lost in Space.Jack Hagerty and Jon Rogers, The Saucer Fleet (Ontario: Apogee Books, 2008), 116, 278. (When Hodgson was later interviewed on Space Ghost Coast to Coast, Space Ghost referred to him as \\"Mr. Lost in Space himself, Joel Robinson\\".)

It was released in 1982 and was used by standing on top of it and leaning in a certain direction. Skier Suzy Chaffee appeared on television and at toy fairs demonstrating its use.Pointing Devices for Personal Computers: Mice Lead the Way, By Paul Freiberger, InfoWorld, 8 Aug 1983, ...The Amiga joyboard encourages users to play with their feet!... Design The Joyboard worked by installing the four directional latches of a joystick on the bottom of the board. Leaning in a certain direction engaged these latches, controlling the game. A joystick could also be connected to the Joyboard if necessary.Amiga Joyboard Amiga history guide This is done via a standard Atari joystick port placed next to where the cable goes into the board. It can be used in a \\"plugthrough\\" manner which saves disconnecting the board when not in use. Due to similarities in design and function, the Wii Balance Board, a peripheral for Nintendo's Wii video game console, has been compared to the Joyboard. The Wii Balance Board also allows users to control games with their feet, but uses more advanced technology in the form of pressure sensors under each foot. Software Mogul Maniac was the only game released for the Joyboard. A slalom skiing game, it was developed by Amiga Corporation and sold alongside the Joyboard upon release.HIGH TECH, Skiing, Dec 1983, Page 96, ...No spectator sport this, but Mogul Maniac($50); a home video slalom-course game plays out on TV screen, while racer stands on joyboard in front of set and swivels turns through gates and trees... Off Your Rocker, another game developed by Amiga, could also use the Joyboard, in place of a normal joystick. The object of the game was to repeat the color and sound patterns made by \\"Rockin' Rollie\\", the on-screen character. Although the game was completed, it was never officially sold by Amiga, and instead the cartridges were sent to a company called Pleasant Valley Video who then sold them to the public. Surf's Up, a surfing game, also seems to have been developed for use with the Joyboard, but was not released either. Guru Meditation Early in the development of the Amiga computer operating system, the company's developers became so frustrated with the system's frequent crashes that, as a relaxation technique, they attempted to sit perfectly still on the Joyboard so not to engage any of the latches on the bottom of it. This is where the infamous Guru Meditation error originates from in earlier versions of the AmigaOS operating system. In homage to this, Ian Bogost, founder of video game developer Persuasive Games, has developed the video game Guru Meditation in an attempt \\"to create a legitimate zen meditation game\\". Although the game may be played using a joystick, if a player uses the Joyboard, they must sit perfectly still on it with their legs crossed. If a player is successful, the on-screen yogi will rise, and once enough time has passed the yogi will begin to float and the timer starts. The time of day changes roughly each hour, and clouds pass in the background. Ian Bogost worked in conjunction with Atari fansite AtariAge to manufacture ten copies of the game in cartridge form.

The name translates to \\"Bettie Serves\\", or \\"Service to Bettie\\", which is the title of a book written by Dutch tennis player Betty St√∂ve, who made it to the Wimbledon Ladies Singles final in 1977. Formation The band is composed of Carol Van Dijk (or \\"van Dyk\\", born 22 April 1962, in Vancouver, British Columbia) (vocals and guitar), Peter Visser (guitar), Herman Bunskoeke (born c. 1961 in Amsterdam) (bass) and Berend Dubbe (born c. 1961 in Amsterdam) (drums). The band originally formed in 1986, but its members split up for four years, following their first gig. They reformed in 1990, and released their debut album, Palomine, in 1992. Subsequent releases In 1995, the group released their second album, Lamprey, which was well received by critics. They subsequently obtained tour slots alongside bands including Belly, Dinosaur Jr, Buffalo Tom, Superchunk, Come, and Jeff Buckley. After releasing the full-length album Dust Bunnies in 1997, Bettie Serveert released a cover album featuring songs from the band Velvet Underground. Dubbe left the band due to artistic differences and started his own band, Bauer. In July 2001, Van Dijk and Pascal Deweze of Sukilove released their self-titled album as Chitlin' Fooks. They followed it with Did it Again in January 2003. A number of drummers, such as Reinier Veldman, (who played the drums in the Bettie Serveert proto-band De Artsen), stood in for Dubbe on their next album, Private Suit. Stoffel Verlackt, Jeroen Blankert, and Gino Geudens played the drums on Log 22 and Attagirl. Bettie Serveert continues to tour extensively through Western Europe, Canada, and the United States. Their cover of the Bright Eyes track \\"Lover I Don't Have to Love\\" was featured in episode 18 of season 3 of the FOX show The OC. Palomine's title track can be heard playing in the background during episode 4 of My So-Called Life. The band also covered Bob Dylan's \\"I'll Keep It with Mine\\" for the soundtrack of the 1996 indie film I Shot Andy Warhol. Bettie Serveert released a digital only EP, Deny All, on Second Motion Records, on 26 January 2010 in the United States. Their ninth full-length album, Pharmacy of Love, was also given a US release by Second Motion on 23 March of that year. 2017 saw the release of Damaged Good, again to positive reception. A pink vinyl version with a gatefold cover, limited to 1,000 copies, was released as part of Record Store Day that year. Carol van Dijk Carol van Dijk was born in Canada to Dutch parents. Her native language is English. Her family moved to Holland in 1969, and van Dijk struggled with the subsequent language barrier, in particular the Amsterdam variation of the Dutch language. Her voice has been praised for its beauty and clarity, as well as its unusual pronunciations.

Symptoms may include bleeding from the anus or a lump near the anus. Other symptoms may include pain, itchiness, or discharge from the anus. A change in bowel movements may also occur. Risk factors include human papillomavirus (HPV), HIV/AIDS, receptive anal sex, smoking, and many sexual partners. Anal cancer is typically a squamous cell carcinoma. Other types include adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Diagnosis is suspected based on physical examination and confirmed by tissue biopsy. Prevention includes avoiding risk factors and HPV vaccination. Standard treatment may include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery. About 8,300 people are diagnosed a year in the United States, representing about 0.5% of new cancers. Onset is typically after the age of 45. Women are affected more often than men. The number of cases has increased since the 1990s. The five year survival rate in the United States is 68%. Signs and symptoms A squamous cell carcinoma of the anus visible Symptoms of anal cancer can include pain or pressure in the anus or rectum, a change in bowel habits, a lump near the anus, rectal bleeding, itching or discharge. Bleeding may be severe.National Cancer Institute. Anal Cancer Treatment (PDQ) Patient Version. 13 June 2008. Accessed 26 June 2009. Risk factors *Human papillomavirus: Examination of squamous cell carcinoma tumor tissues from patients in Denmark and Sweden showed a high proportion of anal cancers to be positive for the types of HPV that are also associated with high risk of cervical cancer. In another study done, high-risk types of HPV, notably HPV-16, were detected in 84 percent of anal cancer specimens examined. Based on the study in Denmark and Sweden, Parkin estimated that 90% of anal cancers are attributable to HPV. *Sexual activity: Due to increased risk of exposure to HPV, having multiple sex partners and receptive anal intercourse greatly increases the likelihood of developing anal cancer, for men and women. *Smoking: Current smokers are several times more likely to develop anal cancer compared with nonsmokers. Epidemiologist Janet Daling, Ph.D., a member of Fred Hutchinson's Public Health Sciences Division, and her team found that smoking appears to play a significant role in anal-cancer development that is independent of other behavioral risk factors, such as sexual activity. More than half of the anal-cancer patients studied were current smokers at the time of diagnosis, as compared to a smoking rate of about 23 percent among the controls. \\"Current smoking is a very important promoter of the disease,\\" said Daling. \\"There's a fourfold increase in risk if you're a current smoker, regardless of whether you're male or female.\\" They explained that the mechanism behind smoking and anal-cancer development is unknown, but researchers speculate that smoking interferes with a process called apoptosis, or programmed cell death, which helps rid the body of abnormal cells that could turn cancerous. Another possibility is that smoking suppresses the immune system, which can decrease the body's ability to clear persistent infection or abnormal cells. *Immunosuppression, which is often associated with HIV infection. * Benign anal lesions. * A history of cervical, vaginal or vulval cancers *Cloacogenic. Cloacogenic carcinoma is a rare tumor of the anorectal region originating from a persistent remnant of the cloacal membrane of the embryo. The tumor accounts for 2-3% of anorectal carcinomas and occurs more than twice as often in women. Pathology Most anal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas (epidermoid carcinomas), that arises near the squamocolumnar junction. It may be keratinizing (basaloid) or non-keratinizing (cloacogenic). Other types of anal cancer are adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, sarcoma or melanoma.

In 2010, Gardasil was approved in the US to prevent anal cancer and pre-cancerous lesions in males and females aged 9 to 26 years. The vaccine has been used before to help prevent cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancer, and associated lesions caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in women.US approves anal cancer vaccine http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/health/view/1100843/1/.html Screening Anal Pap smears similar to those used in cervical cancer screening have been studied for early detection of anal cancer in high-risk individuals. In 2011, an HIV clinic implemented a program to enhance access to anal cancer screening for HIV-positive men. Nurse practitioners perform anal Papanicolaou screening, and men with abnormal results receive further evaluation with high-resolution anoscopy. The program has helped identify many precancerous growths, allowing them to be safely removed. Treatment = Localised disease = Localised disease (carcinoma-in-situ) and the precursor condition, anal intraepithelial neoplasia (anal dysplasia or AIN) can be ablated with minimally invasive methods such as Infrared Photocoagulation. Previously, anal cancer was treated with surgery, and in early-stage disease (i.e., localised cancer of the anus without metastasis to the inguinal lymph nodes), surgery is often curative. The difficulty with surgery has been the necessity of removing the internal and external anal sphincter, with concomitant fecal incontinence. For this reason, many patients with anal cancer have required permanent colostomies. Current gold-standard therapy is chemotherapy and radiation treatment to reduce the necessity of debilitating surgery. This \\"combined modality\\" approach has led to the increased preservation of an intact anal sphincter, and therefore improved quality of life after definitive treatment. Survival and cure rates are excellent, and many patients are left with a functional sphincter. Some patients have fecal incontinence after combined chemotherapy and radiation. Biopsies to document disease regression after chemotherapy and radiation were commonly advised, but are not as frequent any longer. Current chemotherapy consists of continuous infusion 5-FU over four days with bolus mitomycin given concurrently with radiation. 5-FU and cisplatin are recommended for metastatic anal cancer. =Metastatic or recurrent disease= 10 to 20% of patients treated for anal cancer will develop distant metastatic disease following treatment. Metastatic or recurrent anal cancer is difficult to treat, and usually requires chemotherapy. Radiation is also employed to palliate specific locations of disease that may be causing symptoms. Chemotherapy commonly used is similar to other squamous cell epithelial neoplasms, such as platinum analogues, anthracyclines such as doxorubicin, and antimetabolites such as 5-FU and capecitabine. JD Hainsworth developed a protocol that includes Taxol and Carboplatinum along with 5-FU.  Prognosis  Median survival rates for people with distant metastases ranges from 8 to 34 months. Surgical resection with a permanent colostomies was the standard treatment until the 1970s, yielding 5-year overall survival of approximately 50%. The best overall survival rates are seen after combined radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy (5-FU + Mitomycin) in people with T2N0 and T3N0 categories of disease (5-y overall survival: 82%). The 5-year overall survival rates of patients with T4 with no involved lymph nodes, T3 with involved lymph nodes, and T4 with involved lymph nodes disease after the combined treatment is 57%, 57%, and 42%, respectively.Gunderson et al., Anal Carcinoma: Impact of TN Category of Disease on Survival, Disease Relapse, and Colostomy Failure in US Gastrointestinal Intergroup RTOG 98-11 Phase 3 Trial.

Six years after its foundation, with the permission () of the Ottoman Sultan, the first campus (the current-day South Campus) was built in Bebek at the ridge of the Rumelian Castle, very close to a Bektashi tekke, whose leaders maintained an excellent relationship with the Congregational and Presbyterian founders of Robert College, according to Dr. Friedrich Schrader, a German lecturer at Robert College during the 1890s.Friedrich Schrader in: Robert College, Nord und S√ºd, November 1919, S. 165‚Äì169 (Article in German language) The first building of the school was named \\"Hamlin Hall\\" in memory of Cyrus Hamlin. In 1878, Christopher Robert died. According to the article A Millionaire's Will, published in The New York Times (November 27, 1878), Robert left a great portion of his wealth to the college. A College Catalog was compiled in 1878‚Äì1879, giving general information and an outline of the courses of study. Defining the aims of the college the catalog stated: \\"The object of the College is to give to its students, without distinction of race or religion, a thorough educational equal in all respects to that obtained at a first-class American college and based upon the same general principles.\\" After Hamlin, Robert College was administrated by George Washburn (1877‚Äì1903) Gale Biography In Context. and Caleb Gates (1903‚Äì1932). Though founded at the time of the Ottoman Empire as an institution of higher learning serving the Christian minorities of the Empire as well as foreigners living in Constantinople, the school adopted a strictly secular educational model in accordance with the republican principles of Turkey in 1923. Robert College, in the past had junior high school, high school, and university sections under the names Robert Academy, Robert Y√ºksek and American College for Girls. Since 1971, the current-day Robert College has functioned only as a \\"high school\\" (more comparable to the French lyc√©e in academic rigor) on its Arnavutk√∂y campus (formerly the campus of American College for Girls), yet it retains the title of 'College'. The Bebek campus and academic staff were turned over to the Republic of Turkey for use as a public university named Boƒüazi√ßi University, the renamed continuation of Robert College's university section. Robert College 1880  Campus  The Faculty of Arts and Sciences Aptullah Kuran Library which locates in the North Campus Boƒüazi√ßi University operates on six campuses in Istanbul. Four of these campuses (South Campus, North Campus, Hisar Campus, and U√ßaksavar Campus) are close to each other and located on a hill in the affluent district of Bebek on the European side of Istanbul, overlooking the Bosphorus (hence the name). The Kennedy Lodge, named after John F. Kennedy, is located at the South Campus and operates as a welcoming facility for visiting professors and staff. The Kandilli Campus is right across from the shore, located on the Asian side of Istanbul (in √áengelk√∂y) and hosts the Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute (KOERI). The newest campus is in Kilyos on the Black Sea coast and is home to a private beach. The South Campus is the most popular campus among students and visitors alike. Main campus Boƒüazi√ßi University  Dormitories  Washburn Hall at Boƒüazi√ßi University Main The University has ten dormitories on its different campuses. 1. Men's and 1. Women's Dorms are located on the South Campus and they are among the oldest buildings of the school. One other name of the 1. Men's Dorm building is Hamlin Hall and 1. Women's Dorm is also known by the name of Zeynep-Ay≈üe Birkan Women's Domitory. By accommodating at these two historical buildings, students get the chance of participating in the active social and historical life of Boƒüazi√ßi University. There are 4 dormitories on the North Campus. 1st and 2nd North Dormitories were opened to service after the year of 1985. While the former serves as a female dorm, the latter is for males. They have similar architectural designs. 3rd North Dorm was opened in the year of 2010 and currently it has been serving for female students. The last dorm of the North Campus is 4th North Dorm, which has been in service since 2011. Some of the electricity energy consumed in the dorm is being met thanks to its solar panels located on the roof of the building. On its Kilyos Campus, which is approximately one-hour away from the center, 1st and 3rd Kilyos Dormitories are located. 1st Kilyos Dorm serves to female students while the male students accommodate at the 3rd Kilyos Dorm. Opened to service in 2014, 3rd Kilyos Dorm building has a work and fitness room, laundry facilities, a computer lab, and a prayer room. Apart from those mentioned above, Superdorm and Kandilli Dorm also provide accommodation to Boƒüazi√ßi University students. Put into service in the 1998‚Äì99 academic year, Superdorm enables the students to socialize and experience the dorm life with higher service quality. As to the Kandilli Dorm, it was opened to service in the year of 2017 on the Kandilli Campus right across the Bosphorus. Only female students accommodate at the Kandilli Campus. The waste water collected from the bathroom is reused in the toilet reservoirs after the treatment process.

It can also be used to measure airflow between building zones, to test ductwork airtightness and to help physically locate air leakage sites in the building envelope. There are three primary components to a blower door: (1) a calibrated, variable-speed fan, capable of inducing a range of airflows sufficient to pressurize and depressurize a variety of building sizes, (2) a pressure measurement instrument, called a manometer, to simultaneously measure the pressure differential induced across the face of the fan and across the building envelope, as a result of fan airflow, and (3) a mounting system, used to mount the fan in a building opening, such as a door or a window. Air tightness testing is usually thought of in residential settings. It is becoming more common in commercial settings. The General Services Administration (GSA) requires testing of new US federal government buildings.(cite weburs= title=Unmasking Commercial Building Energy Loss  RSES Journal March 2014) A variety of blower door airtightness metrics can be produced using the combination of building-to-outside pressure and fan airflow measurements. These metrics differ in their measurement methods, calculation and uses. Blower door tests are used by building researchers, weatherization crews, home performance contractors, home energy auditors, and others in efforts to assess the construction quality of the building envelope, locate air leakage pathways, assess how much ventilation is supplied by the air leakage, assess the energy losses resulting from that air leakage, determine if the building is too tight or too loose, determine if the building needs mechanical ventilation and to assess compliance with building performance standards. History Simplified schematic diagram of blower door pressure testing Blower door technology was first used to measure building airtightness in Sweden around 1977. This earliest implementation used a fan mounted in a window, rather than a door. Similar window-mounted measurement techniques were being pursued by Caffey in Texas, and door-mounted test fans were being developed by Harrje, Blomsterberg and Persily at Princeton University to help them find and fix air leaks in homes in a Twin Rivers, New Jersey housing development. Harold Orr has also been identified as a member of a group in Saskatchewan, Canada who was pursuing similar testing methods. These early research efforts demonstrated the potential power of blower door testing in revealing otherwise unaccounted for energy losses in homes. Previously, air leakage around doors, windows and electrical outlets was considered to be the primary leakage pathway in homes, but Harrje, Dutt and Beya used blower doors to identify ‚Äúthermal bypasses‚Äù. These bypasses were air leakage sites, such as attic utility chases, that accounted for the vast percentage of air leakage energy losses in most homes. Use of blower doors in home energy retrofitting and weatherization efforts became known as ‚Äúhouse doctoring‚Äù by researchers on the East and West coasts. The blower door first became commercially available in the United States in 1980 under the name Gadsco. Harmax started to sell units in 1981, followed closely by The Energy Conservatory in 1982. While these blower door-testing efforts were useful in identifying leakage pathways and in accounting for otherwise inexplicable energy losses, the results could not be used to determine real-time air exchange in buildings under natural conditions, or even to determine average annual air exchange levels. Sherman attributes the first attempt at doing this to Persily and Kronvall, who estimated annual average air exchange by: ACH_{natural} = {ACH_{at 50 pascal}\\\\over20}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! : ACH_{natural}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Natural Air Changes per Hour [1/h] : ACH_{at 50 pascal}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Air Changes per Hour at 50 pascal [1/h] Further physical modeling efforts allowed for the development and validation of an infiltration model by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). This model combined data derived from blower door tests with annual weather data to generate time-resolved ventilation rates for a given home in a specific location. This model has been incorporated into the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals (1989), and it has been used in the development of ASHRAE Standards 119 and 136. Other infiltration models have been developed elsewhere, including one by Deru and Burns at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), for use in whole-building performance simulation. How blower door tests work Blower door setup in doorway with a digital pressure and flow gauge A basic blower door system includes three components: a calibrated fan, a door panel system, and a pressure measurement device (manometer). =Test setup= The blower door fan is temporarily sealed into an exterior doorway using the door panel system. All interior doors are opened, and all exterior doors and windows are closed. HVAC balancing dampers and registers are not to be adjusted, and fireplaces and other operable dampers should be closed. All mechanical exhaust devices in the home, such as bathroom exhaust, kitchen range hood or dryer, should be turned off. Pressure tubing is used to measure the fan pressure, and it is also run to the exterior of the building, so that the indoor/outdoor pressure differential can be measured. The exterior pressure sensor should be shielded from wind and direct sunlight. The test begins by sealing the face of the fan and measuring the baseline indoor/outdoor pressure differential. The average value is to be subtracted from all indoor/outdoor pressure differential measurements during the test. =Test procedure= The blower door fan is used to blow air into or out of the building, creating either a positive or negative pressure differential between inside and outside. This pressure difference forces air through all holes and penetrations in the building enclosure. The tighter the building (e.g. fewer holes), the less air is needed from the blower door fan to create a change in building pressure. Typically, only depressurization testing is performed, but both depressurization and pressurization are preferable. Different values for blower door metrics are to be expected for pressurizing and depressurizing, due to the building envelope's response to directional airflow. The smallest fan ring that allows the fan to reach the maximum target indoor/outdoor pressure differential should be used. A multi- point test can be performed either manually or using data acquisition and fan control software products. The manual test consists of adjusting the fan to maintain a series of indoor/outdoor pressure differentials and recording the resulting average fan and indoor/outdoor pressures. Alternatively, a single- point test can be performed, where the blower door fan is ramped up to a reference indoor/outdoor pressure differential and the fan pressure is recorded. Often the blower door hardware converts fan pressure measurements directly to fan airflow values. Power law model of airflow A typical graph of air leakage vs. pressure (in French) Building leakage is described by a power law equation of flow through an orifice. The orifice flow equation is typically expressed as Q = C{\\\\Delta}P^n\\\\,\\\\\\\\! : Q\\\\,\\\\\\\\! =Airflow (m3/s) : C\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Air Leakage Coefficient : {\\\\Delta}P\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Pressure Differential (Pa) : n\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Pressure Exponent The C parameter reflects the size of the orifice, the ‚àÜP is the pressure differential across the orifice, and the n parameter represents the characteristic shape of the orifice, with values ranging from 0.5 to 1, representing a perfect orifice and a very long, thin crack, respectively. There are two airflows to be determined in blower door testing, airflow through the fan (QFan) and airflow through the building envelope (QBuilding). Q_{Fan} = C_{Fan}{{\\\\Delta}P_{Fan}}^{n_{Fan}}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! Q_{Building} = C_{Building}{{\\\\Delta}P_{Building}}^{n_{Building}}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! It is assumed in blower door analysis that mass is conserved, resulting in: Q_{Fan} = Q_{Building}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! Which results in: C_{Fan}{{\\\\Delta}P_{Fan}}^{n_{Fan}} = C_{Building}{{\\\\Delta}P_{Building}}^{n_{Building}}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! Fan airflow is determined using CFan and nFan values that are provided by the blower door manufacturer, and they are used to calculate QFan. The multi-point blower door test procedure results in a series of known values of Qn, Fan and ‚àÜPn, Building. Typical ‚àÜPn, Building values are ¬±5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 pascal. Ordinary least squares regression analysis is then used to calculate the leakage characteristics of the building envelope: CBuilding and nBuilding. These leakage characteristics of the building envelope can then be used to calculate how much airflow will be induced through the building envelope for a given pressure difference caused by wind, temperature difference or mechanical forces. 50 Pa can be plugged into the orifice-flow equation, along with the derived building C and n values to calculate airflow at 50 pascal. This same method can be used to calculate airflow at a variety of pressures, for use in creation of other blower door metrics. An alternative approach to the multi- point procedure is to only measure fan airflow and building pressure differential at a single test point, such as 50 Pa, and then use an assumed pressure exponent, nBuilding in the analysis and generation of blower door metrics. This method is preferred by some for two main reasons: (1) measuring and recording one data point is easier than recording multiple test points, and (2) the measurements are least reliable at very low building pressure differentials, due both to fan calibration and to wind effects. Air density corrections In order to increase the accuracy of blower door test results, air density corrections should be applied to all airflow data. This must be done prior to the derivation of building air leakage coefficients (C_{Building}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!) and pressure exponents (n_{Building}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!). The following methods are used to correct blower door data to standard conditions. For depressurization testing, the following equation should be used: Q_{Corrected} = Q_{Measured}*{\\\\rho_{In} \\\\over \\\\rho_{Out}}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! :Q_{Corrected}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Airflow corrected to actual air density :Q_{Measured}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Airflow derived using C_{Fan}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and n_{Fan}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! :\\\\rho_{In}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Air density inside the building, during testing :\\\\rho_{Out}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Air density outside the building, during testing For pressurization testing, the following equation should be used: Q_{Corrected} = Q_{Measured}*{\\\\rho_{Out} \\\\over \\\\rho_{In}}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! The values {\\\\rho_{Out} \\\\over \\\\rho_{In}}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and {\\\\rho_{In} \\\\over \\\\rho_{Out}}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! are referred to as air density correction factors in product literature. They are often tabulated in easy to use tables in product literature, where a factor can be determined from outside and inside temperatures. If such tables are not used, the following equations will be required to calculate air densities. \\\\rho_{In}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! can be calculated in IP units using the following equation: \\\\rho_{In} = 0.07517*(1-{0.0035666*E \\\\over 528})^{5.2553}*({528 \\\\over T_{In}+460})\\\\,\\\\\\\\! :\\\\rho_{In}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Air density inside the building, during testing :E\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Elevation above sea level (ft) :T_{In}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Indoor Temperature (F) \\\\rho_{Out}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! can be calculated in IP units using the following equation: \\\\rho_{Out} = 0.07517*(1-{0.0035666*E \\\\over 528})^{5.2553}*({528 \\\\over T_{Out}+460})\\\\,\\\\\\\\! :\\\\rho_{Out}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Air density outside the building, during testing :E\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Elevation above sea level (ft) :T_{Out}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Outdoor Temperature (F) In order to translate the airflow values derived using C_{Fan}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and n_{Fan}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! from the blower door manufacturer to the actual volumetric airflow through the fan, use the following: Q_{Actual} = Q_{Fan}*\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho_{Ref} \\\\over \\\\rho_{Actual}}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! :Q_{Actual}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Actual volumetric airflow through the fan :Q_{Fan}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Volumetric airflow calculated using manufacturer's coefficients or software :\\\\rho_{Ref}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Reference air density (typically 1.204 for kg/m3 or 0.075 for lb/ft3) :\\\\rho_{Actual}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Actual density of air going through the fan \\\\rho_{In}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! for depressurization and \\\\rho_{Out}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! for pressurization Blower door metrics Blower door installation (France) Depending on how a blower door test is performed, a wide variety of airtightness and building airflow metrics can be derived from the gathered data. Some of the most common metrics and their variations are discussed below. The examples below use the SI pressure measurement unit Pascal (pa). Imperial measurement units are commonly water column inches (WC Inch or IWC). The conversion rate is 1 WC inch = 249 Pa. Examples below use the commonly accepted pressure of 50pa which is 20% of 1 IWC. =Airflow at a specified building pressure= This is the first metric that results from a Blower Door Test. The airflow, (Imperial in Cubic Feet / minute; SI in liters / second) at a given building-to-outside pressure differential, 50 pascal (Q50). This standardized single-point test allows for comparison between homes measured at the same reference pressure. This is a raw number reflecting only the flow of air through the fan. Homes of different sizes and similar envelope quality will have different results in this test. =Airflow per unit surface area or floor area= Often, an effort is made to control for building size and layout by normalizing the airflow at a specified building pressure to either the building‚Äôs floor area or to its total surface area. These values are generated by taking the airflow rate through the fan and dividing by the area. These metrics are most used to assess construction and building envelope quality, because they normalize the total building leakage area to the total amount of area through which that leakage could occur. In other words, how much leakage occurs per unit area of wall, floor, ceiling, etc. =Air changes per hour at a specified building pressure= Another common metric is the air changes per hour at a specified building pressure, again, typically at 50 Pa (ACH50). ACH_{50} = {Q_{50}*60\\\\over V_{Building}}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! : ACH_{50}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Air changes per hour at 50 pascal (h‚àí1) : Q_{50}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Airflow at 50 pascal (ft3/minute or m3/minute) : V_{Building}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Building volume (ft3 or m3) This normalizes the airflow at a specified building pressure by the building‚Äôs volume, which allows for more direct comparison of homes of different sizes and layouts. This metric indicates the rate at which the air in a building is replaced with outside air, and as a result, is an important metric in determinations of indoor air quality. =Effective leakage area= In order to take values generated by fan pressurization and to use them in determining natural air exchange, the effective leakage area of a building must be calculated. Each gap and crack in the building envelope contributes a certain amount of area to the total leakage area of the building. The Effective Leakage Area assumes that all of the individual leakage areas in the building are combined into a single idealized orifice or hole. This value is typically described to building owners as the area of a window that is open 24/7, 365 in their building. The ELA will change depending on the reference pressure used to calculate it. 4 Pa is typically used in the US, whereas a reference pressure of 10 Pa is used in Canada. It is calculated as follows: ELA = C_{Building}*\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho \\\\over 2}*{\\\\Delta}P_{Ref}^{n_{Building}-0.5}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! : ELA\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Effective Leakage Area (m2 or in2) :C_{Building}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Building air leakage coefficient :\\\\rho\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Air density (kg/m3 or lb/in3), typically a standard density is used :{\\\\Delta}P_{Ref}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Reference Pressure (Pa or lbForce/in2), typically 4 Pa in US and 10 Pa in Canada :n_{Building}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Building pressure exponent It is essential that units are carefully conserved in these calculations. CBuilding and nBuilding should be calculated using SI units, and œÅ and ‚àÜPReference should be kg/m3 and pascal, respectively. Alternatively, CBuilding and nBuilding can be calculated using Imperial units, with œÅ and ‚àÜPReference being lb/ft3 and lbForce/in2, respectively. The ELA can be used, along with the Specific Infiltration Rate (s) derived using the LBNL infiltration model, to determine airflow rate through the building envelope throughout the year. =Leakage area per unit floor or surface area= Leakage area estimates can also be normalized for the size of the enclosure being tested, For example, the LEED Green Building Rating System has set an airtightness standard for multifamily dwelling units of of leakage area per of enclosure area, to control tobacco smoke between units. This is equal to 0.868 cm¬≤/m¬≤. =Normalized leakage= Normalized leakage is a measure of the tightness of a building envelope relative to the building size and number of stories. Normalized Leakage is defined in ASHRAE Standard 119 as: NL = 1000*({ELA \\\\over A_{Floor}})*({H \\\\over H_{Ref}})^{0.3}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! : NL\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Normalized leakage :ELA\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Effective Leakage Area (m2 or in2) :A_{Floor}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Building floor area (m2 or in2) :H\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Building Height (m or in) :H_{Ref}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! = Reference height () Applications Infrared view of leaky window pressurized by blower door testing Visible light view of window under test Blower doors can be used in a variety of types of testing. These include (but are not limited to): * Testing residential and commercial buildings for air tightness * Testing buildings at mid-construction to identify and correct any failures in the enclosure * Testing buildings for compliance with standards for energy efficiency, such as the IECC and ASHRAE. * Testing building envelopes and window frames for water tightness and rain penetration * NFPA Clean Agent Retention testing (this type of testing is usually described as a door fan test rather than a blower door test) * Duct leakage testing of forced air heating/cooling systems - both supply (vents) ducts and return ducts can be tested to determine if and how much they leak air. A duct test can be combined with a blower door test to measure the total leakage to outside, measuring effective leakage to the outside of the house only. * Finding air leaks in a building using an infrared camera while the house is depressurized. A blower door is not mandatory for an infrared reading, but the drawing in of outside air temperatures exaggerates temperature changes and facilitates the spotting of envelope leaks. NFPA enclosure integrity testing NFPA enclosure integrity testing is a specialized type of enclosure testing that typically measures the airtightness of rooms within buildings that are protected by clean agent fire suppression systems. This test is normally done during the installation and commissioning of the system and is mandatory under NFPA, ISO, EN and FIA Standards that also require the test is repeated annually if any doubt exists about the airtightness from the previous test. These types of enclosures are typically server rooms containing large amounts of computer and electronic hardware that would be damaged by the more typical water based sprinkler system. The word \\"clean\\" refers to the fact that after the suppression system discharges, there is nothing to be cleaned up. The agent merely disperses into the atmosphere. NFPA-2001 (2015 Edition) is used throughout North America, many Asian countries and the Middle East. A hold Time analysis has been required since 1985. ISO-14520-2015 version or EN-15004 Standards are used throughout Europe while FIA Standards are used in the UK. Results from all these standards are very similar. NFPA standards for equipment calibration are about the same as they are for other types of testing, so any modern blower door equipment is sufficiently accurate to perform NFPA enclosure integrity testing. Specialized software or a tedious calculation must be provided to arrive at the hold time which is generally ten minutes. The NFPA standard requires that the blower door operator be trained, but does not specify the nature or source of this training. There is no official NFPA training available for enclosure integrity testing methodology at this time. An NFPA enclosure integrity test result is typically reported in the form of an agent hold time which represents the duration for which the room will retain at least 85% of the design concentration in order to suppress a fire and to ensure it does not reignite. This retention time inversely proportion to the leakage area of the room which is the major factor. Location of leaks, height being protected, the presence of continual mixing and clean agent being used will affect the hold time also. The 2008 Edition of NFPA-2001 required a peak pressure evaluation in addition but the industry in the USA in particular has been slow to institute this important requirement since excessive pressure during discharge has damaged many enclosures. This requirement was designed to prevent that.

Both Cactus and G√∂ring sing and play multiple instruments. When they appear on stage as a duo, Cactus frequently plays drums while G√∂ring plays guitar and synth; at other times the touring band has included additional musicians such as Angie Reed. Their early career was nurtured within Berlin's easy listening scene, and they frequently supported the DJ team Le Hammond Inferno, who went on to form Bungalow Records and sign Stereo Total to their label. Stereo Total became the most successful act on Bungalow, finding an audience not just beyond Berlin but also across Europe and eventually in Japan and the US. Musical style Their music is a playful, wildly eclectic mash-up of synthpop, new wave, electronica, and pop music. The most consistent element in their cut and paste compositions is a retro-hip European 1960s style, with references to psych and garage-rock as well as to 1960s French-pop in the vein of Fran√ßoise Hardy, Jacques Dutronc, France Gall, and Brigitte Bardot. Some of their most recognized tracks are kitschy lo-fi covers of pop, rock and soul songs, such as their self-consciously trashy version of Salt-N-Pepa's electro rap hit \\"Push It.\\" Their songs are primarily sung in German, French and English, but some of their output also features a number of other languages, such as Japanese, Spanish and Turkish. The band has covered songs by: Sylvie Vartan, Fran√ßoise Hardy, Brigitte Bardot, Brigitte Fontaine, Serge Gainsbourg, Johnny Hallyday, Velvet Underground, Nico, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Harpo, Pizzicato Five, Hot Chocolate, Die T√∂dliche Doris, Nina Hagen, KC and the Sunshine Band and Marjo (Corbeau). Songs used in advertisements \\"I Love You, Ono\\"‚Äîa re-titled cover version of \\"I Love You, Oh No!\\" by Japanese new wave band, Plastics‚Äîfrom their album My Melody, was used by Sony in a European commercial for the Handycam in June 2005, and was also featured in Robot Food's snowboarding hit \\"Afterbang\\". In 2009, the song was used in a Dell commercial for the Studio 15. In 2012 \\"I Love You, Ono\\" was used on the Dior Addict advert in the UK and Spain. In 2013 it was used as the theme music for Channel 4's Anna and Katy ‚Äì the choice of the show's co-writers and performers, Anna Crilly and Katy Wix. The title of the Stereo Total version is a play on both the original Plastics title and Yoko Ono, and is a likely homage to the original's Japanese origin. Another one of their songs, \\"L'Amour √† trois\\" (the French version of the song \\"Liebe zu Dritt\\"), was used in a commercial for 3G-phones in Sweden in the fall of 2005 by the company 3, as well as by the Spanish TV Channel Cuatro in an advert for the company and in the disco scene in the independent Argentinian film \\"Glue\\".

Nineteenth-century archaeologists such as Heinrich Schliemann were drawn to study the societies they had read about in Latin and Greek texts. Many universities and foreign nations maintain excavation programs and schools in the area-such is the enduring appeal of the region's archaeology. Cultures discussed Classical archaeology in its strictest, most traditional sense applies only to the study of Classical Athenian culture and the culture of the Roman Republic and Empire. However, over the course of the last century, the field has expanded to include discussions of the elaborate mosaic of cultures that produced the civilizations of Ancient Greece and Rome. Classical archaeologists interested in Greece frequently discuss Crete and the Minoan civilization present on that island during the Bronze Age. They also discuss the Helladic and Geometric periods, as well as occasionally discussing the Neolithic period as it pertains to Greece. Even during the Classical period, it is completely untrue to say that Greece had one true culture - a great deal of regional variation was present, and much of the study of Greek archaeology lies in examination of these regional differences. Greek archaeology covers the Hellenistic period as well, frequently compelling the classical archaeologist to examine the Greek influences present in all the areas that were part of Alexander the Great's empire, including much of the Middle East and Egypt. Classical archaeologists interested in Roman civilization discuss the influence of the Etruscans and other early cultures present on the Italic Peninsula. They also discuss the subcultures present within the Roman Republic and Empire based on regional differences, and any discussion of the later empire requires at least a partial segue into the Byzantine Empire. Excavations While inspired by ancient texts and sometimes using them to interpret artifacts, classical archaeology would not exist without ancient artifacts. Though much of classical archaeology (like any kind of archaeology) is performed by scholars in their studies, the most vibrant and crucial parts of classical archaeology are the archaeological excavations, more commonly known as \\"digs\\". Excavation techniques at first were modelled after excavations in Egypt and the Near East and searched for large artifacts and walls without much care for the delicate remains that might have existed in the ground around these artifacts. Many of the earliest sites still cannot be dated in a satisfying manner because the stratigraphy, soil layers with embedded artifacts used to determine the age of a site, was completely stripped away. Early excavations also often failed to record the items they found in sufficient detail, making it difficult to date artifacts, determine precisely where they were found, or establish a connection between objects that may have been found together. Over time, excavation techniques have greatly improved and the amount of information gleaned from each excavation is exponentially greater than that recorded in early excavations. While excavation reports now take many years to compile due to the level of detail included and analyzed.

There are no copyright restrictions on the Federal Register; as a work of the U.S. government, it is in the public domain.; \\"Any person may reproduce or republish, without restriction, any material appearing in any regular or special edition of the Federal Register.\\" Contents The Federal Register provides a means for the government to announce to the public changes to government requirements, policies, and guidance. * Proposed new rules and regulations * Final rules * Changes to existing rules * Notices of meetings and adjudicatory proceedings * Presidential documents including Executive orders, proclamations and administrative orders. Both proposed and final government rules are published in the Federal Register. A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (or \\"NPRM\\") typically requests public comment on a proposed rule and provides notice of any public meetings where a proposed rule will be discussed. The public comments are considered by the issuing government agency, and the text of a final rule along with a discussion of the comments is published in the Federal Register. Any agency proposing a rule in the Federal Register must provide contact information for people and organizations interested in making comments to the agencies and the agencies are required to address these concerns when it publishes its final rule on the subject. The notice and comment process, as outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act, gives the people a chance to participate in agency rulemaking. Publication of documents in the Federal Register also constitutes constructive notice, and its contents are judicially noticed. The United States Government Manual is published as a special edition of the Federal Register. Its focus is on programs and activities.  Format  Each daily issue of the printed Federal Register is organized into four categories: * Presidential Documents (executive orders and proclamations) * Rules and Regulations (including policy statements and interpretations of rules by federal agencies) * Proposed Rules (including petitions to agencies from the public) * Notices (such as scheduled hearings and meetings open to the public and grant applications) Citations from the Federal Register are [volume] FR [page number] ([date]), e.g., 71 FR 24924 (Apr. 7, 2006). The final rules promulgated by a federal agency and published in the Federal Register are ultimately reorganized by topic or subject matter and re- published (or \\"codified\\") in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which is updated annually.  Availability  Copies of the Federal Register may be obtained from the U.S. Government Publishing Office. Most law libraries associated with an American Bar Association‚Äìaccredited law school will also have a set, as will federal depository libraries. = Free sources = The Federal Register has been available online since 1994. Federal depository libraries within the U.S. also receive copies of the text, either in paper or microfiche format. Outside the U.S., some major libraries may also carry the Federal Register. As part of the Federal E-Government eRulemaking Initiative, the web site Regulations.gov was established in 2003 to enable easy public access to agency dockets on rulemaking projects including the published Federal Register document. The public can use Regulations.gov to access entire rulemaking dockets from participating Federal agencies to include providing on-line comments directly to those responsible for drafting the rulemakings. To help federal agencies manage their dockets, the Federal Docket Management System (FDMS) was launched in 2005 and is the agency side of regulations.gov. In April 2009, Citation Technologies created a free, searchable website for Federal Register articles dating from 1996 to the present. GovPulse.us,govpulse.us a finalist in the Sunlight Foundation's Apps for America 2, provides a web 2.0 interface to the Federal Register, including sparklines of agency activity and maps of current rules. On July 25, 2010, the Federal Register 2.0federalregister.gov website went live. The new website is a collaboration between the developers who created GovPulse.us, the Government Publishing Office and the National Archives and Records Administration. On August 1, 2011, the Federal Register announced a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate programmatic access to the Federal Register content. The API is fully RESTful, utilizing the HATEOAS architecture with results delivered in the JSON format. Details are available at the developers page and Ruby and Python client libraries are available. = Paid sources = In addition to purchasing printed copies or subscriptions, the contents of the Federal Register can be acquired via several commercial databases: * Citation Technologies offers the complete Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs) through subscription-based web portals such as CyberRegs. * HeinOnline (1936‚Äì): Full coverage available dating back to 1936 in an image- based searchable PDF format. * LexisNexis (July 1, 1980‚Äì): Searchable text format since . * Westlaw (January 1, 1981‚Äì): Searchable text format since .

History  The Federal Register system of publication was created on July 26, 1935, under the Federal Register Act.. . The first issue of the Federal Register was published on March 16, 1936. In 1946 the Administrative Procedure Act required agencies to publish more information related to their rulemaking documents in the Federal Register. On March 11, 2014, Rep. Darrell Issa introduced the Federal Register Modernization Act (H.R. 4195), a bill that would require the Federal Register to be published (e.g., by electronic means), rather than printed, and that documents in the Federal Register be made available for sale or distribution to the public in published form. The American Association of Law Libraries (AALL) strongly opposed the bill, arguing that the bill undermines citizens' right to be informed by making it more difficult for citizens to find their government's regulations. According to AALL, a survey they conducted \\"revealed that members of the public, librarians, researchers, students, attorneys, and small business owners continue to rely on the print\\" version of the Federal Register. AALL also argued that the lack of print versions of the Federal Register and CFR would mean the 15 percent of Americans who don't use the Internet would lose their access to that material. The House voted on July 14, 2014, to pass the bill 386‚Äì0.

The Bardo Thodol (, \\"Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State\\"), commonly known in the West as The Tibetan Book of the Dead, is a text from a larger corpus of teachings, the Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation through the Intention of the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones, revealed by Karma Lingpa (1326‚Äì1386). It is the best-known work of Nyingma literature. The Tibetan text describes, and is intended to guide one through, the experiences that the consciousness has after death, in the bardo, the interval between death and the next rebirth. The text also includes chapters on the signs of death and rituals to undertake when death is closing in or has taken place. Etymology Bar do thos grol () translates as: * bar do: \\"intermediate state\\", \\"transitional state\\", \\"in-between state\\", \\"liminal state\\" (which is synonymous with the Sanskrit antarabhƒÅva). Valdez: \\"Used loosely, the term 'bardo' refers to the state of existence intermediate between two lives on earth.\\" Valdez: \\"[The] concept arose soon after the Buddha's passing, with a number of earlier Buddhist groups accepting the existence of such an intermediate state, while other schools rejected it.\\" * thos grol: thos means hearing as well as philosophical studies. Grol means \\"liberation\\", which is synonymous with the Sanskrit word bodhi, \\"awakening\\", \\"understanding\\", \\"enlightenment\\", and synonymous with the term nirvana, \\"blowing out\\", \\"extinction\\", \\"the extinction of illusion\\". Original text =Origins and dating= Zhi-Khro mandala, a part of the Bardo Thodol's collection, a text known in the West as The Tibetan Book of the Dead, which comprises part of a group of bardo teachings held in the Nyingma (Tibetan tradition) originated with guru Padmasambhava in the 8th century. According to Tibetan tradition, the Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State was composed in the 8th century by Padmasambhava, written down by his primary student, Yeshe Tsogyal, buried in the Gampo hills in central Tibet and subsequently discovered by a Tibetan terton, Karma Lingpa, in the 14th century. =bar do thos grol= The Tibetan title is bar do thos grol, Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State. It consists of two comparatively long texts: * \\"Great Liberation through Hearing: The Supplication of the Bardo of Dharmata\\" (chos nyid bar do'i gsol 'debs thos grol chen mo), the bardo of dharmata (including the bardo of dying); * \\"Great Liberation through Hearing: The Supplication Pointing Out the Bardo of Existence\\" (strid pa'i bar do ngo sprod gsol 'debs thos grol chen mo), the bardo of existence. Within the texts themselves, the two combined are referred to as Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo, Great Liberation through Hearing, or just Liberation through Hearing. =kar-gling zhi-khro= It is part of a larger terma cycle, Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation through the Intention of the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones (zab-chos zhi khro dgongs pa rang grol, also known as kar-gling zhi-khro), popularly known as \\"Karma Lingpa's Peaceful and Wrathful Ones.\\" The Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation is known in several versions, containing varying numbers of sections and subsections, and arranged in different orders, ranging from around ten to thirty-eight titles. The individual texts cover a wide range of subjects, including meditation instructions, visualizations of deities, liturgies and prayers, lists of mantras, descriptions of the signs of death, indications of future rebirth, and texts such as the bar do thos grol that are concerned with the bardo-state. =Three bardos= The Bardo Thodol differentiates the intermediate state between lives into three bardos: # The chikhai bardo or \\"bardo of the moment of death\\", which features the experience of the \\"clear light of reality\\", or at least the nearest approximation of which one is spiritually capable; # The chonyid bardo or \\"bardo of the experiencing of reality\\", which features the experience of visions of various Buddha forms, or the nearest approximations of which one is capable; # The sidpa bardo or \\"bardo of rebirth\\", which features karmically impelled hallucinations which eventually result in rebirth, typically yab-yum imagery of men and women passionately entwined. The Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State also mentions three other bardos: # \\"Life\\", or ordinary waking consciousness; # \\"Dhyana\\" (meditation); # \\"Dream\\", the dream state during normal sleep. Together these \\"six bardos\\" form a classification of states of consciousness into six broad types. Any state of consciousness can form a type of \\"intermediate state\\", intermediate between other states of consciousness. Indeed, one can consider any momentary state of consciousness a bardo, since it lies between our past and future existences; it provides us with the opportunity to experience reality, which is always present but obscured by the projections and confusions that are due to our previous unskillful actions. English translations =Evans-Wentz's The Tibetan Book of the Dead= Tibetan Thanka of Bardo. Vision of Serene Deities, 19th century, Giumet Museum The bar do thos grol is known in the west as The Tibetan Book of the Dead, a title popularized by Walter Evans-Wentz's edition, but as such virtually unknown in Tibet. The Tibetan Book of the Dead was first published in 1927 by Oxford University Press. Dr. Walter Y. Evans-Wentz chose this title because of the parallels he found with the Egyptian Book of the Dead. According to John Myrdhin Reynolds, Evans-Wentz's edition of the Tibetan Book of the Dead introduced a number of misunderstandings about Dzogchen. In fact, Evans-Wentz collected seven texts about visualization of the after-death experiences and he introduced this work collection as \\"The Tibetan Book of Death.\\" Evans-Wentz was well acquainted with Theosophy and used this framework to interpret the translation of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, which was largely provided by two Tibetan lamas who spoke English, Lama Sumdhon Paul and Lama Lobzang Mingnur Dorje. Evans-Wentz was not familiar with Tibetan Buddhism, and his view of Tibetan Buddhism was \\"fundamentally neither Tibetan nor Buddhist, but Theosophical and Vedantist.\\" He introduced a terminology into the translation which was largely derived from Hinduism, as well as from his Theosophical beliefs. Contrary to the general belief spread in the West by Evans-Wentz, in Tibetan Buddhist practice the Tibetan Book of Dead is not read to the people who are passing away, but it is rather used during life by those who want to learn to visualize what will come after death.Paul van der Velde C. G. Jung‚Äôs psychological commentary first appeared in an English translation by R. F. C. Hull in the third revised and expanded Evans-Wentz edition of The Tibetan Book of the Dead. The commentary also appears in the Collected Works. Jung applied his extensive knowledge of eastern religion to craft a commentary specifically aimed at a western audience unfamiliar with eastern religious tradition in general and Tibetan Buddhism specifically. He does not attempt to directly correlate the content of the Bardo Thodol with rituals or dogma found in occidental religion, but rather highlights karmic phenomena described on the Bardo plane and shows how they parallel unconscious contents (both personal and collective) encountered in the west, particularly in the context of analytical psychology. Jung‚Äôs comments should be taken strictly within the realm of psychology, and not that of theology or metaphysics. Indeed, he warns repeatedly of the dangers for western man in the wholesale adoption of eastern religious traditions such as yoga. =Other translations and summaries= * Conze, Edward (1959) Buddhist Scriptures Harmondsworth: Penguin (includes a pr√©cis) * Fremantle, Francesca & Ch√∂gyam Trungpa (1975) The Tibetan Book of the Dead: The Great Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo by Guru Rinpoche according to Karma Lingpa.

The field covers Sumer, the early Sumero-Akkadian city-states, the Akkadian Empire, Ebla, the Akkadian and Imperial Aramaic speaking states of Assyria, Babylonia and the Sealand Dynasty, the migrant foreign dynasties of southern Mesopotamia, including the Gutians, Amorites, Kassites, Arameans, Suteans and Chaldeans, and to some degree post-imperial Achaemenid Assyria, Athura, Eber-Nari, Assyria (Roman province), and Assuristan, together with later Neo-Assyrian states such as Adiabene, Osroene, Hatra, Beth Nuhadra and Beth Garmai, until the Arab invasion and Islamic conquest of the mid-7th century AD. Some Assyriologists also write on the further Assyrian continuity of the Assyrian people as well as the Mandaeans to the present. The large number of cuneiform clay tablets preserved by these Sumero-Akkadian and Assyro-Babylonian cultures provide an extremely large resource for the study of the period. The region's (and indeed the world's) first cities and city-states like Ur are archaeologically invaluable for studying the growth of urbanization. Scholars of Assyriology develop proficiency in the two main languages of Mesopotamia: Akkadian (including its major dialects) and Sumerian. Further, familiarity with such neighbouring languages as Biblical Hebrew, Hittite, Elamite, Hurrian, Indo- Anatolian, Imperial Aramaic, Eastern Aramaic dialects, Old Persian, and Canaanite are useful for comparative purposes, and the knowledge of writing systems that use several hundred core signs. There now exist many important grammatical studies and lexical aids. Although scholars can draw from a large corpus of literature, some tablets are broken, or in the case of literary texts where there may be many copies the language and grammar are often arcane. Moreover, scholars must be able to read and understand modern English, French, and German, as important references, dictionaries, and journals are published in those languages. History =From classical antiquity to modern excavation= For many centuries, European knowledge of Mesopotamia was largely confined to often dubious classical sources, as well as biblical writings. From the Middle Ages onward, there were scattered reports of ancient Mesopotamian ruins. As early as the 12th century, the ruins of Nineveh were correctly identified by Benjamin of Tudela (also known as Benjamin Son of Jonah), a rabbi from Navarre, who visited the Jews of Mosul and the ruins of Assyria during his travels throughout the Middle East.The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character, by Samule Noah Kramer, University of Chicago Press, 1963, p 7 The identification of the city of Babylon was made in 1616 by Pietro Della Valle. Not only did Pietro give \\"remarkable descriptions\\" of the site, but he also brought back to Europe inscribed bricks that he had found at Nineveh and Ur.The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character, by Samuel Noah Kramer, University of Chicago Press, 1963 p. 7 =18th century and birth= Between 1761 and 1767, Carsten Niebuhr, a Danish mathematician, made copies of cuneiform inscriptions at Persepolis in Persia as well as sketches and drawing of Nineveh, and was shortly followed by Andr√© Michaux, a French botanist and explorer, who sold the French Biblioth√®que Nationale de Paris an inscribed boundary stone found near Baghdad.The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character, by Samuel Noah Kramer, University of Chicago Press, 1963, p. 7 The first known archeological excavation in Mesopotamia was led by Abb√© Beauchamp, papal vicar general at Baghdad, excavating the sculpture now generally known as the \\"Lion of Babylon.\\"The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character, by Samuel Noah Kramer, University of Chicago Press, 1963. p 8 Abb√© Beauchamp's memoirs of his travels, published in 1790, sparked a sensation in the scholarly world, generating a number of archeological and academic expeditions to the Middle East. In 1811, Claudius James Rich, an Englishman and a resident for the East India Company in Baghdad, began examining and mapping the ruins of Babylon and Nineveh, and collecting numerous inscribed bricks, tablets, boundary stones, and cylinders, including the famous Nebuchadnezzar Cylinder and Sennacherib Cylinder, a collection which formed the nucleus of the Mesopotamian antiquities collection at the British Museum.The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character, by Samuel Noah Kramer, University of Chicago Press, 1963 p. 8 Before his untimely death at the age of 34, he wrote two memoirs on the ruins of Babylon and the inscriptions found therein, two works which may be said to \\"mark the birth of Assyriology and the related cuneiform studies.\\"The Sumerians: Their History, Culture and Character, by Samuel Noah Kramer, University of Chicago Press, 1963, p.8 =Decipherment of cuneiform= One of the largest obstacles scholars had to overcome during the early days of Assyriology was the decipherment of curious triangular markings on many of the artifacts and ruins found at Mesopotamian sites. These markings, which were termed \\"cuneiform\\" by Thomas Hyde in 1700, were long considered to be merely decorations and ornaments. It was not until late in the 18th century that they came to be considered some sort of writing. In 1778 Carsten Niebuhr, the Danish mathematician, published accurate copies of three trilingual inscriptions from the ruins at Persepolis.The Sumerians: Their History, Culture and Character, by Samuel Noah Kramer, University of Chicago Press, 1963, p. 11 Niebuhr showed that the inscriptions were written from left to right, and that each of the three inscriptions contained three different types of cuneiform writing, which he labeled Class I, Class II, and Class III. Class I was determined to be alphabetic and consisting of 44 characters, and was written in Old Persian. It was first deciphered by Georg Friedrich Grotefend and Henry Creswicke Rawlinson between 1802 and 1848.The Sumerians: Their History, Culture and Character, by Samuel Noah Kramer, University of Chicago Press, 1963, p. 13‚Äì15 The second inscription, Class II, proved more difficult to translate. In 1850, Edward Hincks published a paper showing that the Class II was not alphabetical, but was in fact both syllabic and ideographic, which led to its translation between 1850 and 1859. The language was at first called Babylonian and/or Assyrian, but has now come to be known as Akkadian. From 1850 onwards, there was a growing suspicion that the Semite inhabitants of Babylon and Assyria were not the inventors of cuneiform system of writing, and that they had instead borrowed it from some other language and culture. In 1850, Edward Hincks published a paper suggesting that cuneiform was instead invented by some non-Semitic people who had preceded the Semites in Babylon. In 1853, Rawlinson came to similar conclusions, and the Class III inscriptions were recognized as being written in this more Ancient language, a language which was then called \\"Akkadian\\" or \\"Scythian\\" but which is now known to be Sumerian. This was the first indication to modern scholarship that this older culture and people, the Sumerians, existed at all. =Systematic excavation= Systematic excavation of Mesopotamian antiquities was begun in earnest in 1842, with Paul-√âmile Botta, the French consul at Mosul. The excavations of P.E. Botta at Khorsabad and Austen H. Layard (from 1845) at Nimrud and Nineveh, as well as the successful decipherment of the cuneiform system of writing opened up a new world. Layard's discovery of the library of Assur- bani-pal put the materials for reconstructing the ancient life and history of Assyria and Babylonia into the hands of scholars. He also was the first to excavate in Babylonia, where C.J. Rich had already done useful topographical work. Layard's excavations in this latter country were continued by W.K. Loftus, who also opened trenches at Susa, as well as by Julius Oppert on behalf of the French government. But it was only in the last quarter of the 19th century that anything like systematic exploration was attempted. After the death of George Smith at Aleppo in 1876, an expedition was sent by the British Museum (1877‚Äì1879), under the conduct of Hormuzd Rassam, to continue his work at Nineveh and its neighbourhood. Excavations in the mounds of Balaw~t, called Imgur-Bel by the Assyrians, 15 miles east of Mosul, resulted in the discovery of a small temple dedicated to the god of dreams by Ashurnasirpal II (883 BC), containing a stone coffer or ark in which were two inscribed tables of alabaster of rectangular shape, as well as of a palace which had been destroyed by the Babylonians but restored by Shalmaneser III (858 BC). From the latter came the bronze gates with hammered reliefs, which are now in the British Museum. The remains of a palace of Ashurbanipal at Nimrud (Calah) were also excavated, and hundreds of enamelled tiles were disinterred. Two years later (1880‚Äì1881) Rassam was sent to Babylonia, where he discovered the site of the temple of the sun-god of Sippara at Abu-Habba, and so fixed the position of the two Sipparas or Sepharvaim. Abu-Habba lies south-west of Baghdad, midway between the Euphrates and Tigris, on the south side of a canal, which may once have represented the main stream of the Euphrates, Sippara of the goddess Anunit, now Dir, being on its opposite bank. Meanwhile (1877‚Äì1881) the French consul Ernest de Sarzec had been excavating at Telloh, ancient Girsu, and bringing to light monuments of the pre-Semitic age; these included the diorite statues of Gudea now in the Louvre, the stone of which (according to the inscriptions upon them) had been brought from Magan in the Sinai peninsula. The subsequent excavations of de Sarzec in Telloh and its neighbourhood carried the history of the city back to at least 4000 BC, and a collection. of more than 30,000 tablets has been found, which were arranged on shelves in the time of Gudea (c. 2100 BC). In 1886‚Äì1887 a German expedition under Dr Robert Koldewey explored the cemetery of El Hiba (immediately to the south of Telloh), and for the first time made us acquainted with the burial customs of ancient Babylonia. Another German expedition, on a large scale, was despatched by the Orientgesellschaft in 1899 with the object of exploring the ruins of Babylon; the palace of Nebuchadrezzar and the great processional road were laid bare, and Dr W. Andrae subsequently conducted excavations at Qal'at Sherqat, the site of Assur. Even the Turkish government has not held aloof from the work of exploration, and the Museum at ƒ∞stanbul is filled with the tablets discovered by V. Scheil in 1897 on the site of Sippara. Jacques de Morgan's exceptionally important work at Susa lies outside the limits of Babylonia; not so, however, the American excavations (1903‚Äì1904) under EJ Banks at Bismaya (Ijdab), and those of the University of Pennsylvania at Nippur between 1889 and 1900, where Mr JH Haynes has systematically and patiently uncovered the remains of the great temple of El-lil, removing layer after layer of debris and cutting sections in the ruins down to the virgin soil. Midway in the mound is a platform of large bricks stamped with the names of Sargon of Akkad and his son, Naram-Sin (2300 BC); as the debris above them is 34 feet thick, the topmost stratum being not later than the Parthian era (HV Hilprecht, The Babylonian Expedition, p. 23), it is calculated that the debris underneath the pavement, 30 feet thick, must represent a period of about 3000 years, more especially as older constructions had to be leveled before the pavement was laid. In the deepest part of the excavations, however, inscribed clay tablets and fragments of stone vases are still found, though the cuneiform characters upon them are of a very archaic type, and sometimes even retain their primitive pictorial forms.

It is about south of Carlin, and about southwest of Elko. Although now a virtual ghost town, it had a rich history following construction of the Transcontinental Railroad. The town takes its name from Palisade Canyon (also called \\"12-Mile\\" and \\"10-Mile Canyon\\"), an important obstacle to the construction and operation of the railroad, which lies to the west. History The Palisade community was founded in 1868 as a station on the Central Pacific Railroad. It soon became the transportation hub for Mineral Hill, Hamilton Eureka and other eastern Nevada mining camps. A post office was established at Palisade in May 1870. After the Eureka and Palisade Railroad was established here in 1874, Palisade's population dramatically expanded. Houses and commercial stores were built and by the end of the 1870s, the town had multiple hotels, saloons, other businesses and residences. A school was built and the town had two churches. The local population reached 600. Palisade was the site of an elaborate hoax during the early 1870s, probably to boost tourism. Whenever a train arrived, the residents were said to stage rampant gunfights and bank robberies. Nobody was privy to knowledge of the hoax except the residents, and the showmanship died off after several years. In reality, crime in Palisade was low and the town did not have a sheriff.Lindskoog, Kathryn. Fakes, Frauds & Other Malarkey. Pasadena: Hope, 1993, 44. By 1882, the town had a new train station and telegraph office. The new station was used by both railroads. After 1885, the Eureka mines declined, as well as commercial train activity. With the decline of the railroad, and the subsequent loss of jobs, people in town started to move away. In 1908, a third railroad began running thru town when the Western Pacific built its line to transport people and goods to northern Nevada. In 1910, flooding destroyed most of the town and damaged all three railroad lines. The town never regained its success after the flooding of 1910. In 1932, according to legend, Palisade may have been the site of a possible assassination attempt on the life of President Herbert Hoover. Shortly before Hoover's train was to pass through the town, one railroad inspector said he encountered a vagrant by a trestle with 22 sticks of dynamite. Two men skirmished with the inspector and then fled, but another inspector disputed the story and said the vagrant did not have dynamite. The Palisade post office was discontinued in 1961. Since the 1920s, the town was owned by relatives of Atlanta businessman John Sexton, who sold the entire town at auction on April 26, 2005, in San Francisco. The town was sold to an unidentified bidder for $150,000. Sexton, who had not visited Palisade for some 35 years, said he sold the town to raise college tuition money for his daughter.

He had been a junior military officer but in 1992, he became the world's youngest Head of State when he seized power three days after his 25th birthday. He was the leading member in a group of six young Sierra Leonean soldiers who overthrew president Joseph Saidu Momoh on 29 April 1992 military coup. They established a military junta called the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC). In January 1996, after nearly four years in power, Strasser was ousted in a second military coup, but this time it was his own NPRC soldiers who were not satisfied with his handling of the peace process. The coup was led by his deputy, Brigadier General Julius Maada Bio. Strasser is the first, and one of two Sierra Leonean Heads of State (the other is Julius Maada Bio) born after Sierra Leone had become an Independent nation. He is also the second Sierra Leonean Head of State from the Krio ethnic group. Strasser was born and raised in the neighbourhood of Allen Town in the east end of Sierra Leone's capital Freetown to Creole parents. Strasser enlisted in the Republic of Sierra Leone Military Forces (RSLMF) at age eighteen, immediately after graduating from secondary school. Early life Valentine Esegragbo Melvin Strasser was born on 26 April 1967 in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, to parents from the Creole ethnic group. Strasser grew up in the neighbourhood of Allen Town, in the extreme East End of Freetown. Strasser completed his secondary education at the Sierra Leone Grammar School in Freetown and graduated in 1985 at age eighteen. While in secondary school, Strasser was a gifted student in math and chemistry. Military career On graduation from secondary school in 1985, he enlisted in the Republic of Sierra Leone Military Forces (RSLMF) at the age of eighteen and was deployed for military training as a cadet officer at the Benguema Military Training Academy in Benguema, a town located just outside Freetown. After his training, he was commissioned into the Sierra Leone army at the young age of nineteen. He was posted to a barracks in Daru, Kailahun District in Eastern Sierra Leone. The Revolutionary United Front (RUF) led by Foday Sankoh began their first attack on 25 March 1991 in Buedu villages in Kailahun District. Strasser and other soldiers who were already in a military barracks in Kailahun, were sent to command and rout the rebellion against the RUF. Presidency During Strasser's time at the war front in Kailahun District against the RUF, the Government of Sierra Leone led by president Joseph Saidu Momoh hardly supplied enough boots to the soldiers and the necessary military equipment to help fortify Strasser and his fellow soldiers in the war against the RUF. The soldiers never received their salaries on time and their welfare was hardly at the top of the government's list of priorities. After many appeals, warnings or threats, the young soldiers decided to march down in their combat from Kailahun to the State House in Freetown on 29 April 1992, to protest about their setbacks in pursuing the war, demanding their outstanding salaries. The group of soldiers was led by Strasser himself and his best friend Solomon Musa. The appearance of the soldiers in the capital city forced president Momoh to flee the country and he went into exile in Conakry, Guinea. This power vacuum motivated Strasser and his men to seize power, forming the NPRC, with Strasser as its leader and the Head of State of the country. Strasser became the youngest Head of State in the world at just twenty five years old. 1996 Coup In January 1996, after nearly four years in power, Strasser was ousted in another military coup, but this time it was his own NPRC members who were not satisfied with his handling of the peace process. The coup was led by his deputy, Brigadier General Julius Maada Bio, Colonel Tom Nyuma and Captain Komba Mondeh. Bio quickly rose as the leader of the coup, with the support of Nyuma and Mondeh and took over as Head of State of Sierra Leone. Post-Presidency Following his overthrow, Strasser was given a fellowship by the UN to study law at the University of Warwick in Coventry, England, but stopped his studies after 18 months. In 2000, Strasser's application for asylum in England was rejected; he then left for the Gambia, only to be denied entry. He eventually returned to Sierra Leone, where he lived in poverty on a small pension in Grafton, east of Freetown, and worked at the ICT Institute providing computer skills for youths. In January 2019, he fell gravely ill and was flown to Ghana for treatment. He has not returned to Sierra Leone since then.

Joseph N. Gallo was not related to Joe Gallo of the Colombo crime family. Biography Joseph N. Gallo was born on January 8, 1912, in Calabria,1920 census but grew up in the Little Italy section of Manhattan. Gallo was married and was the father of Gambino associate Joseph C. Gallo. Joseph N. Gallo and his family lived in Mill Basin, Brooklyn and Long Island City, Queens. In the 1930s, Gallo was convicted in New York of illegal gambling. Over the years, Gallo built his power base in the New York garment industry. He owned a dress manufacturing company in Brooklyn and eventually controlled the Greater Blouse, Shirt, and Undergarment Association, a trade group. Gallo also had strong ties with the Trafficante crime family of Tampa, Florida, and the New Orleans crime family under boss Carlos Marcello. Gallo frequently represented their leaders at Cosa Nostra meetings in New York. In the early 1970s, Gallo replaced Joseph Riccobono as consigliere under boss Carlo Gambino. Gallo was considered as a possible candidate to succeed the ailing Gambino. However, on February 21, 1974, Gallo suffered a severe heart attack. Gallo recovered from this illness, but decided that he did not have the will or stamina to be Gambino's successor. After Gambino's death in 1976, Gallo continued as consigliere for boss Paul Castellano. In 1986, after Castellano's assassination, new boss John Gotti also kept Gallo as consigliere. On December 22, 1987, Gallo was convicted of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act charges that included two counts of bribery and one count of illegal interstate travel to commit bribery. In February 1988, Gallo was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison and ordered to pay fines totaling $380,000. Before his sentence, he was released on parole to spend a last Christmas with his family, since at his age any sentence imposed on him would have assured he would die in prison. He became the oldest inmate in federal custody. In 1987, after Gallo's conviction, Gotti replaced him with capo Sammy Gravano at consigliere. In 1995, Gallo was released from prison. On September 1, 1995, Gallo died of natural causes in Astoria, Queens. He is buried in St. Michaels Cemetery in East Elmhurst, Queens. References Further reading *Capeci, Jerry.

As the world's oldest and largest continuously functioning international institution,Mark A. Noll. The New Shape of World Christianity (Downers Grove, IL: IVP Academic, 2009), 191. it has played a prominent role in the history and development of Western civilization.O'Collins, p. v (preface). The church consists of almost 3,500 dioceses (also called \\"local churches\\") around the world on every continent, each shepherded by its bishop. The pope, who is the Bishop of Rome (and whose titles also include Vicar of Jesus Christ and Successor of St. Peter), is the chief pastor of the whole church, entrusted with the universal Petrine ministry of unity and correction. The church's international administration is the Holy See, located in the tiny, independent European nation of Vatican City in Rome, Italy, of which the pope is also head of state. The Christian beliefs of Catholicism are found in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church teaches that it is the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission, that its bishops are the successors of Christ's apostles, and that the pope is the successor to Saint Peter, upon whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ.Holy Bible: Matthew It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith, reserving infallibility, passed down by sacred tradition. The Latin Church, the twenty-three Eastern Catholic Churches, and institutes such as mendicant orders, enclosed monastic orders and third orders reflect a variety of theological and spiritual emphases in the church.Colin Gunton. \\"Christianity among the Religions in the Encyclopedia of Religion\\", Religious Studies, Vol. 24, number 1, page 14. In a review of an article from the Encyclopedia of Religion, Gunton writes: \\"[T]he article [on Catholicism in the encyclopedia] rightly suggests caution, suggesting at the outset that Roman Catholicism is marked by several different doctrinal, theological and liturgical emphases.\\" Of its seven sacraments, the Eucharist is the principal one, celebrated liturgically in the Mass.CCC, 1322‚Äì1327, Vatican.va: \\"the Eucharist is the sum and summary of our faith\\" The church teaches that through consecration by a priest, the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ. The Virgin Mary is venerated in the Catholic Church as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven, honoured in dogmas and devotions. Its teaching includes Divine Mercy, sanctification through faith and evangelization of the Gospel as well as Catholic social teaching, which emphasises voluntary support for the sick, the poor, and the afflicted through the corporal and spiritual works of mercy. The Catholic Church is the largest non-government provider of education and health care in the world. The Catholic Church has influenced Western philosophy, culture, art, and science. Catholics live all over the world through missions, diaspora, and conversions. Since the 20th century the majority reside in the southern hemisphere, due to secularization in Europe, and increased persecution in the Middle East. The Catholic Church shared communion with the Eastern Orthodox Church until the East‚ÄìWest Schism in 1054, disputing particularly the authority of the pope. Before the Council of Ephesus in AD 431, the Church of the East also shared in this communion, as did the Oriental Orthodox churches before the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451; all separated primarily over differences in Christology. In the 16th century, the Reformation led to Protestantism also breaking away. From the late 20th century, the Catholic Church has been criticized for its teachings on sexuality, its inability to ordain women, and its handling of sexual abuse cases involving clergy. The church operates thousands of schools, hospitals, and orphanages around the world, and is the largest non- governmental provider of education and health care in the world. Among its other social services are numerous charitable and humanitarian organizations. Having founded most of the world's first universities, the church today is also the largest provider of higher education. Name The first use of the term \\"Catholic Church\\" (literally meaning \\"universal church\\") was by the church father Saint Ignatius of Antioch in his Letter to the Smyrnaeans (circa 110 AD).John Meyendorff, Catholicity and the Church, St Vladimirs Seminary Press, 1997, , p. 7 Ignatius of Antioch is also attributed the earliest recorded use of the term \\"Christianity\\" () 100 A.D.

The first known use of the phrase \\"the catholic church\\" ( he katholike ekklesia) occurred in the letter written about 110 AD from Saint Ignatius of Antioch to the Smyrnaeans. In the Catechetical Lectures () of Saint Cyril of Jerusalem, the name \\"Catholic Church\\" was used to distinguish it from other groups that also called themselves \\"the church\\". The \\"Catholic\\" notion was further stressed in the edict De fide Catolica issued 380 by Theodosius I, the last emperor to rule over both the eastern and the western halves of the Roman Empire, when establishing the state church of the Roman Empire.Edictum de fide catholica Since the East‚ÄìWest Schism of 1054, the Eastern Church has taken the adjective \\"Orthodox\\" as its distinctive epithet (however, its official name continues to be the \\"Orthodox Catholic Church\\"\\"Eastern Orthodoxy\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica online.) and the Western Church in communion with the Holy See has similarly taken \\"Catholic\\", keeping that description also after the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, when those who ceased to be in communion became known as \\"Protestants\\".\\"catholic, adj. and n.\\" Oxford English Dictionary Online.

At the Reformation, the term 'Catholic' was claimed as its exclusive right by the body remaining under the Roman obedience, in opposition to the 'Protestant' or 'Reformed' National Churches. These, however, also retained the term, giving it, for the most part, a wider and more ideal or absolute sense, as the attribute of no single community, but only of the whole communion of the saved and saintly in all churches and ages. In England, it was claimed that the Church, even as Reformed, was the national branch of the 'Catholic Church' in its proper historical sense.\\" Note: The full text of the OED definition of \\"catholic\\" can be consulted here.McBrien, Richard (2008).

Organization \\"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" Jesus to Peter in the Gospel of Matthew, The crossed gold and silver keys of the Holy See symbolize the keys of Simon Peter, representing the power of the papal office to loose and bind.

The gold cross on a monde (globe) surmounting the tiara symbolizes the sovereignty of Jesus. The Catholic Church follows an episcopal polity, led by bishops who have received the sacrament of Holy Orders who are given formal jurisdictions of governance within the church. \\"It is usual to distinguish a twofold hierarchy in the Church, that of order and that of jurisdiction, corresponding to the twofold means of sanctification, grace, which comes to us principally through the sacraments, and good works, which are the fruit of grace.\\" There are three levels of clergy, the episcopate, composed of bishops who hold jurisdiction over a geographic area called a diocese or eparchy; the presbyterate, composed of priests ordained by bishops and who work in local diocese or religious orders; and the diaconate, composed of deacons who assist bishops and priests in a variety of ministerial roles. Ultimately leading the entire Catholic Church is the Bishop of Rome, commonly called the pope, whose jurisdiction is called the Holy See. In parallel to the diocesan structure are a variety of religious institutes that function autonomously, often subject only to the authority of the pope, though sometimes subject to the local bishop. Most religious institutes only have male or female members but some have both. Additionally, lay members aid many liturgical functions during worship services. =Holy See, papacy, Roman Curia, and College of Cardinals= Francis is the 266th and current pope of the Catholic Church, a title he holds ex officio as Bishop of Rome, and sovereign of Vatican City.

The position of cardinal is a rank of honour bestowed by popes on certain clerics, such as leaders within the Roman Curia, bishops serving in major cities and distinguished theologians. For advice and assistance in governing, the pope may turn to the College of Cardinals.McDonough (1995), p. 227 Following the death or resignation of a pope, members of the College of Cardinals who are under age 80 act as an electoral college, meeting in a papal conclave to elect a successor.Duffy (1997), p. 416 Although the conclave may elect any male Catholic as pope since 1389 only cardinals have been elected.Duffy (1997), pp. 417‚Äì418 =Canon law= Canon law ()Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Edition, pg. 771: \\"Jus canonicum\\" is the system of laws and legal principles made and enforced by the hierarchical authorities of the Catholic Church to regulate its external organization and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics toward the mission of the church.Della Rocca, Manual of Canon Law, p. 3.

Similarly, civil law may give force in its field to canon law, but only by specific enactment, as with regard to canonical marriages. Currently, the 1983 Code of Canon Law is in effect for the Latin Church. The distinct 1990 Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches (CCEO, after the Latin initials) applies to the autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches. =Latin and Eastern churches= In the first thousand years of Catholic history, different varieties of Christianity developed in the Western and Eastern Christian areas of Europe. Though most Eastern-tradition churches are no longer in communion with the Catholic Church after the Great Schism of 1054, autonomous particular churches of both traditions currently participate, also known as \\"churches sui iuris\\" (\\"). The largest and most well known is the Latin Church, the only Western-tradition church, with more than 1 billion members worldwide. Relatively small in terms of adherents compared to the Latin Church, are the 23 self-governing Eastern Catholic Churches with a combined membership of 17.3 million .Colin Gunton. \\"Christianity among the Religions in the Encyclopedia of Religion\\", Religious Studies, Vol. 24, number 1, p. 14. In a review of an article from the Encyclopedia of Religion, Gunton writes \\"... [T] he article [on Catholicism in the encyclopedia] rightly suggests caution, suggesting at the outset that Roman Catholicism is marked by several different doctrinal and theological emphases.\\" The Latin Church is governed by the pope and diocesan bishops directly appointed by him. The pope exercises a direct patriarchal role over the Latin Church, which is considered to form the original and still major part of Western Christianity, a heritage of certain beliefs and customs originating in Europe and northwestern Africa, some of which are inherited by many Christian denominations that trace their origins to the Protestant Reformation.\\"General Essay on Western Christianity\\", \\"Western Church/Roman Catholicism\\" Overview of World Religions. Division of Religion and Philosophy, University of Cumbria. 1998/9 ELMAR Project. Accessed 26 March 2015. The Eastern Catholic Churches follow the traditions and spirituality of Eastern Christianity and are churches which have always remained in full communion with the Catholic Church or who have chosen to re-enter full communion in the centuries following the East‚ÄìWest Schism and earlier divisions. These churches are communities of Catholic Christians whose forms of worship reflect distinct historical and cultural influences rather than differences in doctrine. A church sui iuris is defined in the Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches as a \\"group of Christian faithful united by a hierarchy\\" that is recognised by the pope in his capacity as the supreme authority on matters of doctrine within the church. The term is an innovation of the CCEO to denote the relative autonomy of the Eastern Catholic Churches, who remain in full communion with the pope, but have governance structures and liturgical traditions separate from that of the Latin Church. While the Latin Church's canons do not explicitly use the term, it is tacitly recognised as equivalent. Some Eastern Catholic churches are governed by a patriarch who is elected by the synod of the bishops of that church,\\"CCEO, Canons 55‚Äì150\\".

In the Latin Church, Catholic men may serve as deacons or priests by receiving sacramental ordination. Men and women may serve as extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion, as readers (lectors), or as altar servers. Historically, boys and men have only been permitted to serve as altar servers; however, since the 1990s, girls and women have also been permitted.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 86 (1994) pp. 541‚Äì542 (Official Latin ; English translation) Ordained Catholics, as well as members of the laity, may enter into consecrated life either on an individual basis, as a hermit or consecrated virgin, or by joining an institute of consecrated life (a religious institute or a secular institute) in which to take vows confirming their desire to follow the three evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty and obedience. Examples of institutes of consecrated life are the Benedictines, the Carmelites, the Dominicans, the Franciscans, the Missionaries of Charity, the Legionaries of Christ and the Sisters of Mercy. \\"Religious institutes\\" is a modern term encompassing both \\"religious orders\\" and \\"religious congregations,\\" which were once distinguished in canon law.

Church membership, defined as baptised Catholics, was 1.329 billion at the end of 2018, which is 18% of the world population. Catholics represent about half of all Christians. Geographic distribution of Catholics worldwide continues to shift, with 17.8% in Africa, 48.3% in the Americas, 11.1% Asia, 21.5% in Europe, and 0.9% in Oceania. Catholic ministers include ordained clergy, lay ecclesial ministers, missionaries, and catechists. Also as of the end of 2014, there were 465,595 ordained clergy, including 5,237 bishops, 415,792 priests (diocesan and religious), and 44,566 deacons (permanent). Non-ordained ministers included 3,157,568 catechists, 367,679 lay missionaries, and 39,951 lay ecclesial ministers. Catholics who have committed to religious or consecrated life instead of marriage or single celibacy, as a state of life or relational vocation, include 54,559 male religious, 705,529 women religious. These are not ordained, nor generally considered ministers unless also engaged in one of the lay minister categories above. Doctrine Catholic doctrine has developed over the centuries, reflecting direct teachings of early Christians, formal definitions of heretical and orthodox beliefs by ecumenical councils and in papal bulls, and theological debate by scholars. The church believes that it is continually guided by the Holy Spirit as it discerns new theological issues and is protected infallibly from falling into doctrinal error when a firm decision on an issue is reached. It teaches that revelation has one common source, God, and two distinct modes of transmission: Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition, and that these are authentically interpreted by the Magisterium. Sacred Scripture consists of the 73 books of the Catholic Bible, consisting of 46 Old Testament and 27 New Testament writings. Sacred Tradition consists of those teachings believed by the church to have been handed down since the time of the Apostles.Schreck, pp. 15‚Äì19 Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition are collectively known as the \\"deposit of faith\\" (depositum fidei in Latin). These are in turn interpreted by the Magisterium (from magister, Latin for \\"teacher\\"), the church's teaching authority, which is exercised by the pope and the College of Bishops in union with the pope, the Bishop of Rome.Schreck, p. 30 Catholic doctrine is authoritatively summarized in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, published by the Holy See.Marthaler, preface =Nature of God= C. 1210 manuscript version of the traditional Shield of the Trinity theological diagramThe Catholic Church holds that there is one eternal God, who exists as a perichoresis (\\"mutual indwelling\\") of three hypostases, or \\"persons\\": God the Father; God the Son; and God the Holy Spirit, which together are called the \\"Holy Trinity\\". Catholics believe that Jesus Christ is the \\"Second Person\\" of the Trinity, God the Son. In an event known as the Incarnation, through the power of the Holy Spirit, God became united with human nature through the conception of Christ in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Christ, therefore, is understood as being both fully divine and fully human, including possessing a human soul. It is taught that Christ's mission on earth included giving people his teachings and providing his example for them to follow as recorded in the four Gospels.McGrath, pp. 4‚Äì6. Jesus is believed to have remained sinless while on earth, and to have allowed himself to be unjustly executed by crucifixion, as a sacrifice of himself to reconcile humanity to God; this reconciliation is known as the Paschal Mystery. The Greek term \\"Christ\\" and the Hebrew \\"Messiah\\" both mean \\"anointed one\\", referring to the Christian belief that Jesus' death and resurrection are the fulfilment of the Old Testament's messianic prophecies.Kreeft, pp. 71‚Äì72 The Catholic Church teaches dogmatically that \\"the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son, not as from two principles but as from one single principle\\". It holds that the Father, as the \\"principle without principle\\", is the first origin of the Spirit, but also that he, as Father of the only Son, is with the Son the single principle from which the Spirit proceeds. This belief is expressed in the Filioque clause which was added to the Latin version of the Nicene Creed of 381 but not included in the Greek versions of the creed used in Eastern Christianity. =Nature of the church= The Catholic Church teaches that it is the \\"one true church\\", \\"the universal sacrament of salvation for the human race\\", and \\"the one true religion\\".Paragraph 2, second sentence: According to the Catechism, the Catholic Church is further described in the Nicene Creed as the \\"one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church\\". These are collectively known as the Four Marks of the Church. The church teaches that its founder is Jesus Christ.Kreeft, p. 98, quote \\"The fundamental reason for being a Catholic is the historical fact that the Catholic Church was founded by Christ, was God's invention, not man's;... As the Father gave authority to Christ (Jn 5:22; Mt 28:18‚Äì20), Christ passed it on to his apostles (Lk 10:16), and they passed it on to the successors they appointed as bishops.\\" (see also Kreeft, p. 980)Bokenkotter, p. 30. The New Testament records several events considered integral to the establishment of the Catholic Church, including Jesus' activities and teaching and his appointment of the apostles as witnesses to his ministry, suffering, and resurrection. The Great Commission, after his resurrection, instructed the apostles to continue his work. The coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles, in an event known as Pentecost, is seen as the beginning of the public ministry of the Catholic Church.Barry, p. 46. The church teaches that all duly consecrated bishops have a lineal succession from the apostles of Christ, known as apostolic succession.Barry, p. 46 In particular, the Bishop of Rome (the pope) is considered the successor to the apostle Simon Peter, a position from which he derives his supremacy over the church.CCC, 880 . vatican.va. Retrieved 20 August 2011 Catholic belief holds that the church \\"is the continuing presence of Jesus on earth\\"Schreck, p. 131 and that it alone possesses the full means of salvation. Through the passion (suffering) of Christ leading to his crucifixion as described in the Gospels, it is said Christ made himself an oblation to God the Father in order to reconcile humanity to God; the Resurrection of Jesus makes him the firstborn from the dead, the first among many brethren.Colossians 1.18 By reconciling with God and following Christ's words and deeds, an individual can enter the Kingdom of God.Barry, p. 26 The church sees its liturgy and sacraments as perpetuating the graces achieved through Christ's sacrifice to strengthen a person's relationship with Christ and aid in overcoming sin. =Final judgement= The Catholic Church teaches that, immediately after death, the soul of each person will receive a particular judgement from God, based on their sins and their relationship to Christ.Schreck, p. 397 This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in universal judgement of all mankind. This final judgement, according to the church's teaching, will bring an end to human history and mark the beginning of both a new and better heaven and earth ruled by God in righteousness. Depending on the judgement rendered following death, it is believed that a soul may enter one of three states of the afterlife: * Heaven is a state of unending union with the divine nature of God, not ontologically, but by grace. It is an eternal life, in which the soul contemplates God in ceaseless beatitude. * Purgatory is a temporary condition for the purification of souls who, although destined for Heaven, are not fully detached from sin and thus cannot enter Heaven immediately. In Purgatory, the soul suffers, and is purged and perfected. Souls in purgatory may be aided in reaching heaven by the prayers of the faithful on earth and by the intercession of saints. * Final Damnation: Finally, those who persist in living in a state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject themselves to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God. No one is predestined to hell and no one can determine with absolute certainty who has been condemned to hell. Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death, be illuminated with the truth of the Catholic faith, and thus obtain salvation.Christian Bible, Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants and non- Christians without mortal sin but who die in original sin are assigned to limbo, although this is not an official dogma of the church. While the Catholic Church teaches that it alone possesses the full means of salvation, it also acknowledges that the Holy Spirit can make use of Christian communities separated from itself to \\"impel towards Catholic unity\\"\\"Christ's Church Subsists in the Catholic Church\\". ewtn.com. Retrieved on 27 August 2015. and \\"tend and lead toward the Catholic Church\\", and thus bring people to salvation, because these separated communities contain some elements of proper doctrine, albeit admixed with errors. It teaches that anyone who is saved is saved through the Catholic Church but that people can be saved outside of the ordinary means known as baptism of desire, and by pre-baptismal martyrdom, known as baptism of blood, as well as when conditions of invincible ignorance are present, although invincible ignorance in itself is not a means of salvation. (See: \\"Necessity of baptism\\" and \\"Substitutes for the sacrament\\") =Saints and devotions= A saint (also historically known as a hallow) is a person who is recognised as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness or closeness to God, while canonization is the act by which a Christian church declares that a person who has died was a saint, upon which declaration the person is included in the \\"canon\\", or list, of recognised saints. The first persons honoured as saints were the martyrs. Pious legends of their deaths were considered affirmations of the truth of their faith in Christ. By the fourth century, however, \\"confessors\\"‚Äîpeople who had confessed their faith not by dying but by word and life‚Äîbegan to be venerated publicly. In the Catholic Church, both in Latin and Eastern Catholic churches, the act of canonization is reserved to the Apostolic See and occurs at the conclusion of a long process requiring extensive proof that the candidate for canonization lived and died in such an exemplary and holy way that he is worthy to be recognised as a saint. The church's official recognition of sanctity implies that the person is now in Heaven and that he may be publicly invoked and mentioned officially in the liturgy of the church, including in the Litany of the Saints. Canonization allows universal veneration of the saint in the liturgy of the Roman Rite; for permission to venerate merely locally, only beatification is needed.\\"Beatification, in the present discipline, differs from canonization in this: that the former implies (1) a locally restricted, not a universal, permission to venerate, which is (2) a mere permission, and no precept; while canonization implies a universal precept\\" (Beccari, Camillo. \\"Beatification and Canonization\\". The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York, New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. Accessed 27 May 2009.). Devotions are \\"external practices of piety\\" which are not part of the official liturgy of the Catholic Church but are part of the popular spiritual practices of Catholics. These include various practices regarding the veneration of the saints, especially veneration of the Virgin Mary. Other devotional practices include the Stations of the Cross, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Holy Face of Jesus, the various scapulars, novenas to various saints, pilgrimages and devotions to the Blessed Sacrament, and the veneration of saintly images such as the santos. The bishops at the Second Vatican Council reminded Catholics that \\"devotions should be so drawn up that they harmonise with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy, are in some fashion derived from it, and lead the people to it, since, in fact, the liturgy by its very nature far surpasses any of them.\\"Sacrosanctum Concilium, 13 =Virgin Mary= Blessed Virgin Mary is highly regarded in the Catholic Church, proclaiming her as Mother of God, free from original sin and an intercessor. Catholic Mariology deals with the doctrines and teachings concerning the life of the Mary, mother of Jesus, as well as the veneration of Mary by the faithful. Mary is held in special regard, declared the Mother of God (), and believed as dogma to have remained a virgin throughout her life. Further teachings include the doctrines of the Immaculate Conception (her own conception without the stain of original sin) and the Assumption of Mary (that her body was assumed directly into heaven at the end of her life). Both of these doctrines were defined as infallible dogma, by Pope Pius IX in 1854 and Pope Pius XII in 1950 respectively,Barry, p. 106 but only after consulting with the Catholic bishops throughout the world to ascertain that this is a Catholic belief.Schaff, Philip (2009). The Creeds of Christendom. , p. 211. Devotions to Mary are part of Catholic piety but are distinct from the worship of God.Schreck, pp. 199‚Äì200 Practices include prayers and Marian art, music, and architecture. Several liturgical Marian feasts are celebrated throughout the Church Year and she is honoured with many titles such as Queen of Heaven. Pope Paul VI called her Mother of the Church because, by giving birth to Christ, she is considered to be the spiritual mother to each member of the Body of Christ. Because of her influential role in the life of Jesus, prayers and devotions such as the Hail Mary, the Rosary, the Salve Regina and the Memorare are common Catholic practices.Barry, pp. 122‚Äì123 Pilgrimage to the sites of several Marian apparitions affirmed by the church, such as Lourdes, F√°tima, and Guadalupe,Schreck, p. 368 are also popular Catholic devotions. Sacraments Mass at the Grotto at Lourdes, France. The chalice is displayed to the people immediately after the consecration of the wine. The Catholic Church teaches that it was entrusted with seven sacraments that were instituted by Christ. The number and nature of the sacraments were defined by several ecumenical councils, most recently the Council of Trent. These are Baptism, Confirmation, the Eucharist, Penance, Anointing of the Sick (formerly called Extreme Unction, one of the \\"Last Rites\\"), Holy Orders and Holy Matrimony. Sacraments are visible rituals that Catholics see as signs of God's presence and effective channels of God's grace to all those who receive them with the proper disposition (ex opere operato).Kreeft, pp. 298‚Äì299 The Catechism of the Catholic Church categorizes the sacraments into three groups, the \\"sacraments of Christian initiation\\", \\"sacraments of healing\\" and \\"sacraments at the service of communion and the mission of the faithful\\". These groups broadly reflect the stages of people's natural and spiritual lives which each sacrament is intended to serve. The liturgies of the sacraments are central to the church's mission. According to the Catechism: According to church doctrine, the sacraments of the church require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly celebrated. In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments. Notably, because the church teaches that Christ is present in the Eucharist,Kreeft, p. 326 those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation (Penance). Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating for at least an hour before receiving the sacrament.Kreeft, p. 331 Non-Catholics are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well. Catholics, even if they were in danger of death and unable to approach a Catholic minister, may not ask for the sacraments of the Eucharist, penance or anointing of the sick from someone, such as a Protestant minister, who is not known to be validly ordained in line with Catholic teaching on ordination. Likewise, even in grave and pressing need, Catholic ministers may not administer these sacraments to those who do not manifest Catholic faith in the sacrament. In relation to the churches of Eastern Christianity not in communion with the Holy See, the Catholic Church is less restrictive, declaring that \\"a certain communion in sacris, and so in the Eucharist, given suitable circumstances and the approval of Church authority, is not merely possible but is encouraged.\\" =Sacraments of initiation= Baptism Baptism of Augustine of Hippo as represented in a sculptural group in Troyes Cathedral (1549), France As viewed by the Catholic Church, Baptism is the first of three sacraments of initiation as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a person a member of the church. As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit on the part of the person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone‚Äîbe it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent‚Äîmay baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise (\\"to do what the Church does when she baptises\\") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula. Confirmation The Catholic Church sees the sacrament of confirmation as required to complete the grace given in baptism. When adults are baptised, confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards, a practice followed even with newly baptised infants in the Eastern Catholic Churches. In the West confirmation of children is delayed until they are old enough to understand or at the bishop's discretion. In Western Christianity, particularly Catholicism, the sacrament is called confirmation, because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism; in the Eastern Churches, it is called chrismation, because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with chrism, a mixture of olive oil and some perfumed substance, usually balsam, blessed by a bishop. Those who receive confirmation must be in a state of grace, which for those who have reached the age of reason means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by the sacrament of Penance; they should also have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to show in their lives that they are Christians. Eucharist Pope Benedict XVI celebrates the Eucharist at the canonization of Frei Galv√£o in S√£o Paulo, Brazil on 11 May 2007 For Catholics, the Eucharist is the sacrament which completes Christian initiation. It is described as \\"the source and summit of the Christian life\\". The ceremony in which a Catholic first receives the Eucharist is known as First Communion. The Eucharistic celebration, also called the Mass or Divine liturgy, includes prayers and scriptural readings, as well as an offering of bread and wine, which are brought to the altar and consecrated by the priest to become the body and the blood of Jesus Christ, a change called transubstantiation.For an outline of the Eucharistic liturgy in the Roman Rite, see the side bar in the \\"Worship and liturgy\\". The words of consecration reflect the words spoken by Jesus during the Last Supper, where Christ offered his body and blood to his Apostles the night before his crucifixion. The sacrament re-presents (makes present) the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, and perpetuates it. Christ's death and resurrection gives grace through the sacrament that unites the faithful with Christ and one another, remits venial sin, and aids against committing moral sin (though mortal sin itself is forgiven through the sacrament of penance). A Catholic believer prays in a church in Mexico =Sacraments of healing= The two sacraments of healing are the Sacrament of Penance and Anointing of the Sick. Penance The Sacrament of Penance (also called Reconciliation, Forgiveness, Confession, and Conversion) exists for the conversion of those who, after baptism, separate themselves from Christ by sin. Essential to this sacrament are acts both by the sinner (examination of conscience, contrition with a determination not to sin again, confession to a priest, and performance of some act to repair the damage caused by sin) and by the priest (determination of the act of reparation to be performed and absolution). Serious sins (mortal sins) should be confessed at least once a year and always before receiving Holy Communion, while confession of venial sins also is recommended. The priest is bound under the severest penalties to maintain the \\"seal of confession\\", absolute secrecy about any sins revealed to him in confession. Anointing of the sick The Seven Sacraments Altarpiece triptych painting of Extreme Unction (Anointing of the Sick) with oil being administered by a priest during last rites. Rogier van der Weyden, c. 1445\\\\. While chrism is used only for the three sacraments that cannot be repeated, a different oil is used by a priest or bishop to bless a Catholic who, because of illness or old age, has begun to be in danger of death. This sacrament, known as Anointing of the Sick, is believed to give comfort, peace, courage and, if the sick person is unable to make a confession, even forgiveness of sins. The sacrament is also referred to as Unction, and in the past as Extreme Unction, and it is one of the three sacraments that constitute the last rites, together with Penance and Viaticum (Eucharist). =Sacraments at the service of communion= According to the Catechism, there are two sacraments of communion directed towards the salvation of others: priesthood and marriage. Within the general vocation to be a Christian, these two sacraments \\"consecrate to specific mission or vocation among the people of God. Men receive the holy orders to feed the Church by the word and grace. Spouses marry so that their love may be fortified to fulfil duties of their state\\". Holy Orders Priests lay their hands on the ordinands during the rite of ordination. The sacrament of Holy Orders consecrates and deputes some Christians to serve the whole body as members of three degrees or orders: episcopate (bishops), presbyterate (priests) and diaconate (deacons). (As modified by the 2009 motu proprio Omnium in mentem) The church has defined rules on who may be ordained into the clergy. In the Latin Church, the priesthood is generally restricted to celibate men, and the episcopate is always restricted to celibate men.Karl Keating, \\"What Catholics Really Believe: Setting the Record Straight: Chapter 46: Priestly Celibacy\\". ewtn.com.

Matrimony Wedding mass in the Philippines The Catholic Church teaches that marriage is a social and spiritual bond between a man and a woman, ordered towards the good of the spouses and procreation of children; according to Catholic teachings on sexual morality, it is the only appropriate context for sexual activity. A Catholic marriage, or any marriage between baptised individuals of any Christian denomination, is viewed as a sacrament. A sacramental marriage, once consummated, cannot be dissolved except by death. The church recognises certain conditions, such as freedom of consent, as required for any marriage to be valid; In addition, the church sets specific rules and norms, known as canonical form, that Catholics must follow. The church does not recognise divorce as ending a valid marriage and allows state- recognised divorce only as a means of protecting the property and well being of the spouses and any children. However, consideration of particular cases by the competent ecclesiastical tribunal can lead to declaration of the invalidity of a marriage, a declaration usually referred to as an annulment. Remarriage following a divorce is not permitted unless the prior marriage was declared invalid. Liturgy Holy Bible, crucifix and rosary Among the 24 autonomous (sui iuris) churches, numerous liturgical and other traditions exist, called rites, which reflect historical and cultural diversity rather than differences in belief. In the definition of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, \\"a rite is the liturgical, theological, spiritual, and disciplinary patrimony, culture and circumstances of history of a distinct people, by which its own manner of living the faith is manifested in each Church sui iuris\\".\\"CCEO, Canon 28 ¬ß 1\\". Vatican.va (official text ). Intratext.com (English translation). 1990. Excerpt: \\"Ritus est patrimonium liturgicum, theologicum, spirituale et disciplinare cultura ac rerum adiunctis historiae populorum distinctum, quod modo fidei vivendae uniuscuiusque Ecclesiae sui iuris proprio exprimitur.\\" (A rite is the liturgical, theological, spiritual and disciplinary heritage, differentiated by peoples' culture and historical circumstances, that finds expression in each sui iuris Church's own way of living the faith). The liturgy of the sacrament of the Eucharist, called the Mass in the West and Divine Liturgy or other names in the East, is the principal liturgy of the Catholic Church. This is because it is considered the propitiatory sacrifice of Christ himself. Its most widely used form is that of the Roman Rite as promulgated by Paul VI in 1969 and revised by Pope John Paul II in 2002. In certain circumstances, the 1962 form of the Roman Rite remains authorized in the Latin Church. Eastern Catholic Churches have their own rites. The liturgies of the Eucharist and the other sacraments vary from rite to rite, reflecting different theological emphases. =Western rites= The Roman Rite is the most common rite of worship used by the Catholic Church. Its use is found worldwide, originating in Rome and spreading throughout Europe, influencing and eventually supplanting local rites. The present ordinary form of Mass in the Roman Rite, found in the post-1969 editions of the Roman Missal, is usually celebrated in the local vernacular language, using an officially approved translation from the original text in Latin. An outline of its major liturgical elements can be found in the sidebar. Elevation of the chalice before an altar after the consecration during a Solemn Mass of Tridentine Mass In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI affirmed the licitness of continued use of the 1962 Roman Missal as an \\"extraordinary form\\" (forma extraordinaria) of the Roman Rite, speaking of it also as an usus antiquior (\\"older use\\"), and issuing new more permissive norms for its employment.Letter of Pope Benedict XVI to bishops on 7 July 2007 \\"The last version of the Missale Romanum prior to the Council, which was published with the authority of Pope John XXIII in 1962 and used during the Council, will now be able to be used as a Forma extraordinaria of the liturgical celebration. [...] As for the use of the 1962 Missal as a forma extraordinaria of the liturgy of the Mass, I would like to draw attention to the fact that this Missal was never juridically abrogated and, consequently, in principle, was always permitted.\\" ‚Äî Pope Benedict XVI An instruction issued four years later spoke of the two forms or usages of the Roman Rite approved by the pope as the ordinary form and the extraordinary form (\\"the forma ordinaria\\" and \\"the forma extraordinaria\\"). The 1962 edition of the Roman Missal, published a few months before the Second Vatican Council opened, was the last that presented the Mass as standardized in 1570 by Pope Pius V at the request of the Council of Trent and that is therefore known as the Tridentine Mass. Pope Pius V's Roman Missal was subjected to minor revisions by Pope Clement VIII in 1604, Pope Urban VIII in 1634, Pope Pius X in 1911, Pope Pius XII in 1955, and Pope John XXIII in 1962. Each successive edition was the ordinary form of the Roman Rite Mass until superseded by a later edition. When the 1962 edition was superseded by that of Paul VI, promulgated in 1969, its continued use at first required permission from bishops; but Pope Benedict XVI's 2007 motu proprio Summorum Pontificum allowed free use of it for Mass celebrated without a congregation and authorized parish priests to permit, under certain conditions, its use even at public Masses. Except for the scriptural readings, which Pope Benedict allowed to be proclaimed in the vernacular language, it is celebrated exclusively in liturgical Latin.Summorum Pontificum (English translation ). 7 July 2007. Accessed=27 March 2015 Since 2014, clergy in the small personal ordinariates set up for groups of former Anglicans under the terms of the 2009 document Anglicanorum CoetibusApostolic Constitution of Pope Benedict XVI: \\"Anglicanorum Coetibus: Providing for Personal Ordinariates for Anglicans Entering into Full Communion with the Catholic Church\\" . 4 November 2009. Retrieved 31 July 2011. are permitted to use a variation of the Roman Rite called \\"Divine Worship\\" or, less formally, \\"Ordinariate Use\\", which incorporates elements of the Anglican liturgy and traditions,The Divine Worship variant of the Roman Rite differs from the \\"Anglican Use\\" variant, which was introduced in 1980 for the few United States parishes established in accordance with a pastoral provision for former members of the Episcopal Church (the American branch of the Anglican Communion). Both uses adapted Anglican liturgical traditions for use within the Catholic Church. an accommodation protested by Anglican leaders. In the Archdiocese of Milan, with around five million Catholics the largest in Europe, Mass is celebrated according to the Ambrosian Rite. Other Latin Church rites include the Mozarabic and those of some religious institutes. These liturgical rites have an antiquity of at least 200 years before 1570, the date of Pope Pius V's Quo primum, and were thus allowed to continue. =Eastern rites= East Syrian Rite wedding crowning celebrated by a bishop of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church in India, one of the 23 Eastern Catholic Churches in full communion with the pope and the Catholic Church. The Eastern Catholic Churches share common patrimony and liturgical rites as their counterparts, including Eastern Orthodox and other Eastern Christian churches who are no longer in communion with the Holy See. These include churches that historically developed in Russia, Caucasus, the Balkans, North Eastern Africa, India and the Middle East. The Eastern Catholic Churches are groups of faithful who have either never been out of communion with the Holy See or who have restored communion with it at the cost of breaking communion with their associates of the same tradition. See \\"Eastern Catholic Churches\\"; In part: \\"The definition of an Eastern-Rite Catholic is: A Christian of any Eastern Catholic churches in union with the pope: i.e. a Catholic who belongs not to the Roman, but to an Eastern rite. They differ from other Eastern Christians in that they are in communion with Rome, and from Latins in that they have other rites\\" The rites used by the Eastern Catholic Churches include the Byzantine Rite, in its Antiochian, Greek and Slavonic varieties; the Alexandrian Rite; the Syriac Rite; the Armenian Rite; the Maronite Rite and the Chaldean Rite. Eastern Catholic Churches have the autonomy to set the particulars of their liturgical forms and worship, within certain limits to protect the \\"accurate observance\\" of their liturgical tradition. In the past some of the rites used by the Eastern Catholic Churches were subject to a degree of liturgical Latinization. However, in recent years Eastern Catholic Churches have returned to traditional Eastern practices in accord with the Vatican II decree Orientalium Ecclesiarum. Each church has its own liturgical calendar. Social and cultural issues =Catholic social teaching= Catholic social teaching, reflecting the concern Jesus showed for the impoverished, places a heavy emphasis on the corporal works of mercy and the spiritual works of mercy, namely the support and concern for the sick, the poor and the afflicted. Church teaching calls for a preferential option for the poor while canon law prescribes that \\"The Christian faithful are also obliged to promote social justice and, mindful of the precept of the Lord, to assist the poor.\\" Its foundations are widely considered to have been laid by Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical letter Rerum novarum which upholds the rights and dignity of labour and the right of workers to form unions. Catholic teaching regarding sexuality calls for a practice of chastity, with a focus on maintaining the spiritual and bodily integrity of the human person. Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity. Church teachings about sexuality have become an issue of increasing controversy, especially after the close of the Second Vatican Council, due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world described as the sexual revolution. The church has also addressed stewardship of the natural environment, and its relationship to other social and theological teachings. In the document Laudato si', dated 24 May 2015, Pope Francis critiques consumerism and irresponsible development, and laments environmental degradation and global warming. The pope expressed concern that the warming of the planet is a symptom of a greater problem: the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet as humans pursue short- term economic gains. =Social services= Teresa of Calcutta advocated for the sick, the poor and the needy by practicing the acts of corporal works of mercy. The Catholic Church is the largest non-government provider of education and medical services in the world. In 2010, the Catholic Church's Pontifical Council for Pastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers said that the church manages 26% of health care facilities in the world, including hospitals, clinics, orphanages, pharmacies and centres for those with leprosy. The church has always been involved in education, since the founding of the first universities of Europe. It runs and sponsors thousands of primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities throughout the world and operates the world's largest non-governmental school system. Religious institutes for women have played a particularly prominent role in the provision of health and education services, as with orders such as the Sisters of Mercy, Little Sisters of the Poor, the Missionaries of Charity, the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart, the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament and the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul. The Catholic nun Mother Teresa of Calcutta, India, founder of the Missionaries of Charity, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her humanitarian work among India's poor. Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo won the same award in 1996 for \\"work towards a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor\\". The church is also actively engaged in international aid and development through organizations such as Catholic Relief Services, Caritas International, Aid to the Church in Need, refugee advocacy groups such as the Jesuit Refugee Service and community aid groups such as the Saint Vincent de Paul Society. =Sexual morality= Allegory of chastity by Hans Memling The Catholic Church calls all members to practise chastity according to their state in life. Chastity includes temperance, self-mastery, personal and cultural growth, and divine grace. It requires refraining from lust, masturbation, fornication, pornography, prostitution and, especially, rape. Chastity for those who are not married requires living in continence, abstaining from sexual activity; those who are married are called to conjugal chastity. In the church's teaching, sexual activity is reserved to married couples, whether in a sacramental marriage among Christians or in a natural marriage where one or both spouses are unbaptised. Even in romantic relationships, particularly engagement to marriage, partners are called to practise continence, in order to test mutual respect and fidelity. Chastity in marriage requires in particular conjugal fidelity and protecting the fecundity of marriage. The couple must foster trust and honesty as well as spiritual and physical intimacy. Sexual activity must always be open to the possibility of life; the church calls this the procreative significance. It must likewise always bring a couple together in love; the church calls this the unitive significance. Contraception and certain other sexual practices are not permitted, although natural family planning methods are permitted to provide healthy spacing between births, or to postpone children for a just reason. Pope Francis said in 2015 that he is worried that the church has grown \\"obsessed\\" with issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage and contraception and has criticized the Catholic Church for placing dogma before love, and for prioritizing moral doctrines over helping the poor and marginalized.New York Times, Pope Says Church Is 'Obsessed' With Gays, Abortion and Birth ControlCNN, Pope hands GOP climate change dilemma Divorce and declarations of nullity Canon law makes no provision for divorce between baptised individuals, as a valid, consummated sacramental marriage is considered to be a lifelong bond. However, a declaration of nullity may be granted when the proof is produced that essential conditions for contracting a valid marriage were absent from the beginning‚Äîin other words, that the marriage was not valid due to some impediment. A declaration of nullity, commonly called an annulment, is a judgement on the part of an ecclesiastical tribunal determining that a marriage was invalidly attempted. In addition, marriages among unbaptised individuals may be dissolved with papal permission under certain situations, such as a desire to marry a Catholic, under Pauline or Petrine privilege.Rev. Mark J. Gantley. \\"Petrine or Pauline Privilege\\". EWTN Global Catholic Network. 3 September 2004. Accessed 15 November 2014.\\"Canon 1141‚Äì1143\\". 1983 Code of Canon Law. Catholicdoors.com. An attempt at remarriage following divorce without a declaration of nullity places \\"the remarried spouse ... in a situation of public and permanent adultery\\". An innocent spouse who lives in continence following divorce, or couples who live in continence following a civil divorce for a grave cause, do not sin. Worldwide, diocesan tribunals completed over 49000 cases for nullity of marriage in 2006. Over the past 30 years about 55 to 70% of annulments have occurred in the United States. The growth in annulments has been substantial; in the United States, 27,000 marriages were annulled in 2006, compared to 338 in 1968. However, approximately 200,000 married Catholics in the United States divorce each year; 10 million total . Divorce is increasing in some predominantly Catholic countries in Europe. In some predominantly Catholic countries, it is only in recent years that divorce was introduced (e.g. Italy (1970), Portugal (1975), Brazil (1977), Spain (1981), Ireland (1996), Chile (2004) and Malta (2011), while the Philippines and the Vatican City have no procedure for divorce. (The Philippines does, however, allow divorce for Muslims.) Contraception Pope Paul VI issued Humanae vitae on 25 July 1968. The church teaches that sexual intercourse should only take place between a man and woman who are married to each other, and should be without the use of birth control or contraception. In his encyclical Humanae vitae (1968), Pope Paul VI firmly rejected all contraception, thus contradicting dissenters in the church that saw the birth control pill as an ethically justifiable method of contraception, though he permitted the regulation of births by means of natural family planning. This teaching was continued especially by John Paul II in his encyclical Evangelium Vitae, where he clarified the church's position on contraception, abortion and euthanasia by condemning them as part of a \\"culture of death\\" and calling instead for a \\"culture of life\\".Bokenkotter, pp. 27, 154, 493‚Äì494 Many Western Catholics have voiced significant disagreement with the church's teaching on contraception.A summary and restatement of the debate is available in Roderick Hindery. \\"The Evolution of Freedom as Catholicity in Catholic Ethics.\\" Anxiety, Guilt, and Freedom. Eds. Benjamin Hubbard and Brad Starr, UPA, 1990. Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives at some point in their lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one could be a good Catholic without obeying the church's teaching on birth control. Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use of condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use. Similarly, the Catholic Church opposes in vitro fertilization (IVF), saying that the artificial process replaces the love between a husband and wife. In addition, it opposes IVF because it might cause disposal of embryos; Catholics believe an embryo is an individual with a soul who must be treated as such.Allen, John L., The Future Church: How Ten Trends are Revolutionizing the Catholic Church, p. 223. For this reason, the church also opposes abortion. Homosexuality The Catholic Church also teaches that \\"homosexual acts\\" are \\"contrary to the natural law\\", \\"acts of grave depravity\\" and \\"under no circumstances can they be approved\\", but that persons experiencing homosexual tendencies must be accorded respect and dignity. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, This part of the Catechism was quoted by Pope Francis in a 2013 press interview in which he remarked, when asked about an individual: This remark and others made in the same interview were seen as a change in the tone, but not in the substance of the teaching of the church, which includes opposition to same-sex marriage. Certain dissenting Catholic groups oppose the position of the Catholic Church and seek to change it.Sources regarding opposition to the church's position on homosexuality:  =Holy orders and women= Women and men religious engage in a variety of occupations, from contemplative prayer, to teaching, to providing health care, to working as missionaries. While Holy Orders are reserved for men, Catholic women have played diverse roles in the life of the church, with religious institutes providing a formal space for their participation and convents providing spaces for their self-government, prayer and influence through many centuries. Religious sisters and nuns have been extensively involved in developing and running the church's worldwide health and education service networks. Efforts in support of the ordination of women to the priesthood led to several rulings by the Roman Curia or popes against the proposal, as in Declaration on the Question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood (1976), Mulieris Dignitatem (1988) and Ordinatio sacerdotalis (1994). According to the latest ruling, found in Ordinatio sacerdotalis, Pope John Paul II affirmed that the Catholic Church \\"does not consider herself authorized to admit women to priestly ordination\\".Apostolic Letter Ordinatio Sacerdotalis of John Paul II to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on Reserving Priestly Ordination to Men Alone Copyright 1994 Libreria Editrice Vaticana. Retrieved 25 March 2015 In defiance of these rulings, opposition groups such as Roman Catholic Womenpriests have performed ceremonies they affirm as sacramental ordinations (with, reputedly, an ordaining male Catholic bishop in the first few instances) which, according to canon law, are both illicit and invalid and considered mere simulations of the sacrament of ordination.\\"Ordinations: Response Regarding Excommunication Decree\\". 2011 Roman Catholic Womenpriests-USA, Inc.

Retrieved 6 June 2011. =Sexual abuse cases= From the 1990s, the issue of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy and other church members has become the subject of civil litigation, criminal prosecution, media coverage and public debate in countries around the world. The Catholic Church has been criticized for its handling of abuse complaints when it became known that some bishops had shielded accused priests, transferring them to other pastoral assignments where some continued to commit sexual offences. In response to the scandal, formal procedures have been established to help prevent abuse, encourage the reporting of any abuse that occurs and to handle such reports promptly, although groups representing victims have disputed their effectiveness. In 2014, Pope Francis instituted the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors for the safeguarding of minors. History This fresco (1481‚Äì82) by Pietro Perugino in the Sistine Chapel shows Jesus giving the keys of heaven to Saint Peter. The Last Supper, a late 1490s mural painting by Leonardo da Vinci, depicting the last supper of Jesus and his twelve apostles on the eve of his crucifixion. Most apostles are buried in Rome, including Saint Peter. The Christian religion is based on the teachings of Jesus Christ, who lived and preached in the 1st century AD in the province of Judea of the Roman Empire. Catholic doctrine teaches that the contemporary Catholic Church is the continuation of this early Christian community established by Jesus. Christianity spread throughout the early Roman Empire, despite persecutions due to conflicts with the pagan state religion. Emperor Constantine legalized the practice of Christianity in 313, and it became the state religion in 380. Germanic invaders of Roman territory in the 5th and 6th centuries, many of whom had previously adopted Arian Christianity, eventually adopted Catholicism to ally themselves with the papacy and the monasteries. In the 7th and 8th centuries, expanding Muslim conquests following the advent of Islam led to an Arab domination of the Mediterranean that severed political connections between that area and northern Europe, and weakened cultural connections between Rome and the Byzantine Empire. Conflicts involving authority in the church, particularly the authority of the Bishop of Rome finally culminated in the East‚ÄìWest Schism in the 11th century, splitting the church into the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. Earlier splits within the church occurred after the Council of Ephesus (431) and the Council of Chalcedon (451). However, a few Eastern Churches remained in communion with Rome, and portions of some others established communion in the 15th century and later, forming what are called the Eastern Catholic Churches. Early monasteries throughout Europe helped preserve Greek and Roman classical civilization. The church eventually became the dominant influence in Western civilization into the modern age. Many Renaissance figures were sponsored by the church. The 16th century, however, began to see challenges to the church, in particular to its religious authority, by figures in the Protestant Reformation, as well as in the 17th century by secular intellectuals in the Enlightenment. Concurrently, Spanish and Portuguese explorers and missionaries spread the church's influence through Africa, Asia, and the New World. In 1870, the First Vatican Council declared the dogma of papal infallibility and the Kingdom of Italy annexed the city of Rome, the last portion of the Papal States to be incorporated into the new nation. In the 20th century, anti- clerical governments around the world, including Mexico and Spain, persecuted or executed thousands of clerics and laypersons. In the Second World War, the church condemned Nazism, and protected hundreds of thousands of Jews from the Holocaust; its efforts, however, have been criticized as inadequate. After the war, freedom of religion was severely restricted in the Communist countries newly aligned with the Soviet Union, several of which had large Catholic populations. In the 1960s, the Second Vatican Council led to reforms of the church's liturgy and practices, described as \\"opening the windows\\" by defenders, but criticized by traditionalist Catholics. In the face of increased criticism from both within and without, the church has upheld or reaffirmed at various times controversial doctrinal positions regarding sexuality and gender, including limiting clergy to males, and moral exhortations against abortion, contraception, sexual activity outside of marriage, remarriage following divorce without annulment, and against same-sex marriage. =Apostolic era and papacy= Jesus' commission to Saint Peter The New Testament, in particular the Gospels, records Jesus' activities and teaching, his appointment of the twelve Apostles and his Great Commission of the Apostles, instructing them to continue his work.Kreeft, p. 980. The book Acts of Apostles, tells of the founding of the Christian church and the spread of its message to the Roman empire.Burkett, p. 263 The Catholic Church teaches that its public ministry began on Pentecost, occurring fifty days following the date Christ is believed to have resurrected. At Pentecost, the Apostles are believed to have received the Holy Spirit, preparing them for their mission in leading the church. \\"He [the Holy Spirit] is essentially the Spirit of truth (John 14:16‚Äì17; 15:26), Whose office it is to ...to teach the Apostles the full meaning of it [of the truth] (John 14:26; 16:13). With these Apostles, He will abide forever (John 14:16). Having descended on them at Pentecost, He will guide them in their work (Acts 8:29)... The Catholic Church teaches that the college of bishops, led by the Bishop of Rome are the successors to the Apostles. In the account of the Confession of Peter found in the Gospel of Matthew, Christ designates Peter as the \\"rock\\" upon which Christ's church will be built.Christian Bible, The Catholic Church considers the Bishop of Rome, the pope, to be the successor to Saint Peter. Some scholars state Peter was the first Bishop of Rome. Others say that the institution of the papacy is not dependent on the idea that Peter was Bishop of Rome or even on his ever having been in Rome. Many scholars hold that a church structure of plural presbyters/bishops persisted in Rome until the mid-2nd century, when the structure of a single bishop and plural presbyters was adopted, and that later writers retrospectively applied the term \\"bishop of Rome\\" to the most prominent members of the clergy in the earlier period and also to Peter himself. On this basis, Oscar Cullmann,Oscar Cullmann (1962), Peter: Disciple, Apostle, Martyr (2 ed.), Westminster Press p. 234 Henry Chadwick,Henry Chadwick (1993), The Early Church, Penguin Books p. 18 and Bart D. Ehrman question whether there was a formal link between Peter and the modern papacy. Raymond E. Brown also says that it is anachronistic to speak of Peter in terms of local bishop of Rome, but that Christians of that period would have looked on Peter as having \\"roles that would contribute in an essential way to the development of the role of the papacy in the subsequent church\\". These roles, Brown says, \\"contributed enormously to seeing the bishop of Rome, the bishop of the city where Peter died, and where Paul witnessed to the truth of Christ, as the successor of Peter in care for the church universal\\".Raymond E. Brown, 101 Questions and Answers on the Bible (Paulist Press 2003 ), pp. 132‚Äì134 =Antiquity and Roman Empire= Conditions in the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of new ideas. The empire's network of roads and waterways facilitated travel, and the Pax Romana made travelling safe. The empire encouraged the spread of a common culture with Greek roots, which allowed ideas to be more easily expressed and understood.Bokenkotter, p. 24. Unlike most religions in the Roman Empire, however, Christianity required its adherents to renounce all other gods, a practice adopted from Judaism (see Idolatry). The Christians' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant they were unable to participate in much of public life, which caused non- Christians‚Äîincluding government authorities‚Äîto fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire. The resulting persecutions were a defining feature of Christian self- understanding until Christianity was legalized in the 4th century.MacCulloch, Christianity, pp. 155‚Äì159, 164. 19th-century drawing of Old Saint Peter's Basilica, originally built in 318 by Emperor Constantine In 313, Emperor Constantine I's Edict of Milan legalized Christianity, and in 330 Constantine moved the imperial capital to Constantinople, modern Istanbul, Turkey. In 380 the Edict of Thessalonica made Nicene Christianity the state church of the Roman Empire, a position that within the diminishing territory of the Byzantine Empire would persist until the empire itself ended in the fall of Constantinople in 1453, while elsewhere the church was independent of the empire, as became particularly clear with the East‚ÄìWest Schism. During the period of the Seven Ecumenical Councils, five primary sees emerged, an arrangement formalized in the mid-6th century by Emperor Justinian I as the pentarchy of Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria.Paul Valliere, Conciliarism (Cambridge University Press 2012 ), p. 92Patriarch Bartholomew, Encountering the Mystery (Random House 2008 ), p. 3 In 451 the Council of Chalcedon, in a canon of disputed validity,George C.

From c. 350 to c. 500, the bishops, or popes, of Rome, steadily increased in authority through their consistent intervening in support of orthodox leaders in theological disputes, which encouraged appeals to them.\\"Rome (early Christian)\\".

Saints & Sinners: A History of the Popes. Yale University Press. pp. 66‚Äì67 Most of the Germanic tribes who in the following centuries invaded the Roman Empire had adopted Christianity in its Arian form, which the Catholic Church declared heretical.Le Goff, p. 14: \\"The face of the barbarian invaders had been transformed by another crucial fact. Although some of them had remained pagan, another part of them, not the least, had become Christian. But, by a curious chance, which was to leave serious consequences, these converted barbarians‚Äîthe Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Burgundians, Vandals, and later the Lombards‚Äîhad been converted to Arianism, which had become a heresy after the council of Nicaea. They had in fact been converted by followers of the 'apostle of the Goths', Wulfilas.\\" The resulting religious discord between Germanic rulers and Catholic subjectsLe Goff, p. 14: \\"Thus what should have been a religious bond was, on the contrary, a subject of discord and sparked off bitter conflicts between Arian barbarians and Catholic Romans.\\" was avoided when, in 497, Clovis I, the Frankish ruler, converted to orthodox Catholicism, allying himself with the papacy and the monasteries.Le Goff, p. 21: \\"Clovis' master-stroke was to convert himself and his people not to Arianism, like the other barbarian kings, but to Catholicism.\\" The Visigoths in Spain followed his lead in 589,Le Goff, p. 21 and the Lombards in Italy in the course of the 7th century. Western Christianity, particularly through its monasteries, was a major factor in preserving classical civilization, with its art (see Illuminated manuscript) and literacy.How The Irish Saved Civilization: The Untold Story of Ireland's Heroic Role from the Fall of Rome to the Rise of Medieval Europe by Thomas Cahill, 1995.Cahill, Thomas. How the Irish Saved Civilization. Hodder and Stoughton, 1995. Through his Rule, Benedict of Nursia (c. 480‚Äì543), one of the founders of Western monasticism, exerted an enormous influence on European culture through the appropriation of the monastic spiritual heritage of the early Catholic Church and, with the spread of the Benedictine tradition, through the preservation and transmission of ancient culture. During this period, monastic Ireland became a centre of learning and early Irish missionaries such as Columbanus and Columba spread Christianity and established monasteries across continental Europe. =Middle Ages and Renaissance= Chartres Cathedral, 1220 The Catholic Church was the dominant influence on Western civilization from Late Antiquity to the dawn of the modern age. It was the primary sponsor of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Mannerist and Baroque styles in art, architecture and music.Woods, pp. 115‚Äì27 Renaissance figures such as Raphael, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, Fra Angelico, Tintoretto, Titian, Bernini and Caravaggio are examples of the numerous visual artists sponsored by the church.Duffy, p. 133. Historian Paul Legutko of Stanford University said the Catholic Church is \\"at the center of the development of the values, ideas, science, laws, and institutions which constitute what we call Western civilization\\". The massive Islamic invasions of the mid-7th century began a long struggle between Christianity and Islam throughout the Mediterranean Basin. The Byzantine Empire soon lost the lands of the eastern patriarchates of Jerusalem, Alexandria and Antioch and was reduced to that of Constantinople, the empire's capital. As a result of Islamic domination of the Mediterranean, the Frankish state, centred away from that sea, was able to evolve as the dominant power that shaped the Western Europe of the Middle Ages. The battles of Toulouse and Poitiers halted the Islamic advance in the West and the failed Siege of Constantinople halted it in the East. Two or three decades later, in 751, the Byzantine Empire lost to the Lombards the city of Ravenna from which it governed the small fragments of Italy, including Rome, that acknowledged its sovereignty. The fall of Ravenna meant that confirmation by a no longer existent exarch was not asked for during the election in 752 of Pope Stephen II and that the papacy was forced to look elsewhere for a civil power to protect it. In 754, at the urgent request of Pope Stephen, the Frankish king Pepin the Short conquered the Lombards. He then gifted the lands of the former exarchate to the pope, thus initiating the Papal States. Rome and the Byzantine East would delve into further conflict during the Photian schism of the 860s, when Photius criticized the Latin west of adding of the filioque clause after being excommunicated by Nicholas I. Though the schism was reconciled, unresolved issues would lead to further division. In the 11th century, the efforts of Hildebrand of Sovana led to the creation of the College of Cardinals to elect new popes, starting with Pope Alexander II in the papal election of 1061. When Alexander II died, Hildebrand was elected to succeed him, as Pope Gregory VII. The basic election system of the College of Cardinals which Gregory VII helped establish has continued to function into the 21st century. Pope Gregory VII further initiated the Gregorian Reforms regarding the independence of the clergy from secular authority. This led to the Investiture Controversy between the church and the Holy Roman Emperors, over which had the authority to appoint bishops and popes.Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages (2005), pp. 107‚Äì11Duffy, Saints and Sinners (1997), p. 78, quote: \\"By contrast, Paschal's successor Eugenius II (824‚Äì7), elected with imperial influence, gave away most of these papal gains. He acknowledged the Emperor's sovereignty in the papal state, and he accepted a constitution imposed by Lothair which established imperial supervision of the administration of Rome, imposed an oath to the Emperor on all citizens, and required the pope‚Äìelect to swear fealty before he could be consecrated. Under Sergius II (844‚Äì7) it was even agreed that the pope could not be consecrated without an imperial mandate and that the ceremony must be in the presence of his representative, a revival of some of the more galling restrictions of Byzantine rule.\\" In 1095, Byzantine emperor Alexius I appealed to Pope Urban II for help against renewed Muslim invasions in the Byzantine‚ÄìSeljuk Wars,Riley-Smith, p. 8 which caused Urban to launch the First Crusade aimed at aiding the Byzantine Empire and returning the Holy Land to Christian control.Bokenkotter, pp. 140‚Äì141 In the 11th century, strained relations between the primarily Greek church and the Latin Church separated them in the East‚ÄìWest Schism, partially due to conflicts over papal authority. The Fourth Crusade and the sacking of Constantinople by renegade crusaders proved the final breach. In this age great gothic cathedrals in France were an expression of popular pride in the Christian faith. In the early 13th century mendicant orders were founded by Francis of Assisi and Dominic de Guzm√°n. The studia conventualia and studia generalia of the mendicant orders played a large role in the transformation of Church-sponsored cathedral schools and palace schools, such as that of Charlemagne at Aachen, into the prominent universities of Europe.Woods, pp. 44‚Äì48 Scholastic theologians and philosophers such as the Dominican priest Thomas Aquinas studied and taught at these studia. Aquinas' Summa Theologica was an intellectual milestone in its synthesis of the legacy of ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle with the content of Christian revelation.Bokenkotter, pp. 158‚Äì159 A growing sense of church-state conflicts marked the 14th century. To escape instability in Rome, Clement V in 1309 became the first of seven popes to reside in the fortified city of Avignon in southern FranceDuffy, Saints and Sinners (1997), p. 122 during a period known as the Avignon Papacy. The Avignon Papacy ended in 1376 when the pope returned to Rome,Morris, p. 232 but was followed in 1378 by the 38-year-long Western schism, with claimants to the papacy in Rome, Avignon and (after 1409) Pisa. The matter was largely resolved in 1415‚Äì17 at the Council of Constance, with the claimants in Rome and Pisa agreeing to resign and the third claimant excommunicated by the cardinals, who held a new election naming Martin V pope.McManners, p. 240 The Renaissance period was a golden age for Catholic art. Pictured: the Sistine Chapel ceiling painted by Michelangelo. In 1438, the Council of Florence convened, which featured a strong dialogue focussed on understanding the theological differences between the East and West, with the hope of reuniting the Catholic and Orthodox churches. Several eastern churches reunited, forming the majority of the Eastern Catholic Churches. =Age of Discovery= The Age of Discovery beginning in the 15th century saw the expansion of Western Europe's political and cultural influence worldwide. Because of the prominent role the strongly Catholic nations of Spain and Portugal played in Western Colonialism, Catholicism was spread to the Americas, Asia and Oceania by explorers, conquistadors, and missionaries, as well as by the transformation of societies through the socio-political mechanisms of colonial rule. Pope Alexander VI had awarded colonial rights over most of the newly discovered lands to Spain and PortugalKoschorke, pp. 13, 283 and the ensuing patronato system allowed state authorities, not the Vatican, to control all clerical appointments in the new colonies.Hastings (1994), p. 72 In 1521 the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan made the first Catholic converts in the Philippines.Koschorke, p. 21 Elsewhere, Portuguese missionaries under the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelized in India, China, and Japan.Koschorke, pp. 3, 17 The French colonization of the Americas beginning in the 16th century established a Roman Catholic francophone population and forbade non-Catholics to settle in Quebec.Lyons (2013), p. 17 =Protestant Reformation and Counter- Reformation= In 1415, Jan Hus was burned at the stake for heresy, but his reform efforts encouraged Martin Luther, an Augustinian monk in Germany, who sent his Ninety-five Theses to several bishops in 1517.Bokenkotter, p. 215 His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences, and along with the Leipzig Debate this led to his excommunication in 1521.Vidmar, p. 184. In Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin and other Protestant Reformers further criticized Catholic teachings. These challenges developed into the Reformation, which gave birth to the great majority of Protestant denominationsBokenkotter, pp. 223‚Äì224 and also crypto- Protestantism within the Catholic Church. Meanwhile, Henry VIII petitioned the pope for a declaration of nullity concerning his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. When this was denied, he had the Acts of Supremacy passed to make him head of the Church of England, spurring the English Reformation and the eventual development of Anglicanism.Bokenkotter, pp. 235‚Äì237 The Reformation contributed to clashes between the Protestant Schmalkaldic League and the Catholic Emperor Charles V and his allies. The first nine-year war ended in 1555 with the Peace of Augsburg but continued tensions produced a far graver conflict‚Äîthe Thirty Years' War‚Äîwhich broke out in 1618. In France, a series of conflicts termed the French Wars of Religion was fought from 1562 to 1598 between the Huguenots (French Calvinists) and the forces of the French Catholic League, which were backed and funded by a series of popes.Duffy, Saints and Sinners (1997), pp. 177‚Äì178 This ended under Pope Clement VIII, who hesitantly accepted King Henry IV's 1598 Edict of Nantes granting civil and religious toleration to French Protestants.Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages (2005), p. 233 The Council of Trent (1545‚Äì1563) became the driving force behind the Counter-Reformation in response to the Protestant movement. Doctrinally, it reaffirmed central Catholic teachings such as transubstantiation and the requirement for love and hope as well as faith to attain salvation.Bokenkotter, pp. 242‚Äì244 In subsequent centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world, in part through missionaries and imperialism, although its hold on European populations declined due to the growth of religious scepticism during and after the Enlightenment.Maxwell, Melvin. Bible Truth or Church Tradition, p. 70 =Enlightenment and modern period= Ruins of the Jesuit Reduction at S√£o Miguel das Miss√µes in Brazil From the 17th century onward, the Enlightenment questioned the power and influence of the Catholic Church over Western society.Pollard, pp. 7‚Äì8 In the 18th century, writers such as Voltaire and the Encyclop√©distes wrote biting critiques of both religion and the Catholic Church. One target of their criticism was the 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes by King Louis XIV of France, which ended a century-long policy of religious toleration of Protestant Huguenots. As the papacy resisted pushes for Gallicanism, the French Revolution of 1789 shifted power to the state, caused the destruction of churches, the establishment of a Cult of Reason,Bokenkotter, pp. 283‚Äì285 and the martyrdom of nuns during the Reign of Terror. In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte's General Louis-Alexandre Berthier invaded the Italian Peninsula, imprisoning Pope Pius VI, who died in captivity. Napoleon later re-established the Catholic Church in France through the Concordat of 1801.Collins, p. 176 The end of the Napoleonic Wars brought Catholic revival and the return of the Papal States.Duffy, pp. 214‚Äì216 In 1854, Pope Pius IX, with the support of the overwhelming majority of Catholic bishops, whom he had consulted from 1851 to 1853, proclaimed the Immaculate Conception as a Dogma in the Catholic Church. In 1870, the First Vatican Council affirmed the doctrine of papal infallibility when exercised in specifically defined pronouncements,Leith, Creeds of the Churches (1963), p. 143Duffy, Saints and Sinners (1997), p. 232 striking a blow to the rival position of conciliarism. Controversy over this and other issues resulted in a breakaway movement called the Old Catholic Church,Fahlbusch, The Encyclopedia of Christianity (2001), p. 729 The Italian unification of the 1860s incorporated the Papal States, including Rome itself from 1870, into the Kingdom of Italy, thus ending the papacy's temporal power. In response, Pope Pius IX excommunicated King Victor Emmanuel II, refused payment for the land, and rejected the Italian Law of Guarantees, which granted him special privileges. To avoid placing himself in visible subjection to the Italian authorities, he remained a \\"prisoner in the Vatican\\". This stand-off, which was spoken of as the Roman Question, was resolved by the 1929 Lateran Treaties, whereby the Holy See acknowledged Italian sovereignty over the former Papal States in return for payment and Italy's recognition of papal sovereignty over Vatican City as a new sovereign and independent state. =20th century= Royal 22e Regiment in audience with Pope Pius XII, following the Liberation of Rome in 1944 during World War II A number of anti-clerical governments emerged in the 20th century. The 1926 Calles Law separating church and state in Mexico led to the Cristero WarChadwick, Owen, pp. 264‚Äì265 in which more than 3,000 priests were exiled or assassinated,Scheina, p. 33. churches desecrated, services mocked, nuns raped, and captured priests shot. Following the 1917 October Revolution, persecution of the church and Catholics in the Soviet Union continued into the 1930s, with the execution and exiling of clerics, monks and laymen, the confiscation of religious implements, and closure of churches.Riasanovsky 617Riasanovsky 634 In the 1936‚Äì39 Spanish Civil War, the Catholic hierarchy allied with Franco's Nationalists against the Popular Front government,Payne, p. 13 citing as justification Republican violence against the church.Alonso, pp. 395‚Äì396Blood of Spain, Ronald Fraser p. 415, collective letter of bishops of Spain, addressed to the bishops of the world. Pope Pius XI referred to these three countries as a \\"terrible triangle\\".Fontenelle, Mrg R (1939), Seine Heiligkeit Pius XI, p. 164. Alsactia, FranceEncyclical Divini Redemptoris, ¬ß 18 (AAS 29 [1937], 74). 1937. Libreria Editrice Vaticana (English translation ) After violations of the 1933 Reichskonkordat between the church and Nazi Germany, Pope Pius XI issued the 1937 encyclical Mit brennender Sorge, which publicly condemned the Nazis' persecution of the church and their ideology of neo- paganism and racial superiority.Rhodes, pp. 182‚Äì183Rhodes, p. 197Rhodes, pp. 204‚Äì205 The church condemned the 1939 Invasion of Poland that started World War II and other subsequent wartime Nazi invasions.Cook, p. 983 Thousands of Catholic priests, nuns and brothers were imprisoned and murdered throughout the countries occupied by the Nazis, including Saints Maximilian Kolbe and Edith Stein. While Pope Pius XII has been credited with helping to save hundreds of thousands of Jews during the Holocaust,Bokenkotter p. 192De√°k, p. 182 the church has also been accused of having encouraged centuries of antisemitism by its teachings and not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities.Phayer, pp. 50‚Äì57 During the post-war period, Communist governments in Eastern Europe severely restricted religious freedoms. Although some priests and religious people collaborated with Communist regimes, many others were imprisoned, deported, or executed. The church was an important player in the fall of Communism in Europe, particularly in the Polish People's Republic. In 1949, the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War led to the expulsion of all foreign missionaries.Bokenkotter, pp. 356‚Äì358 The new government also created the Patriotic Church and appointed its bishops. These appointments were initially rejected by Rome before many of them were accepted. In the 1960s during the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Communists closed all religious establishments. When Chinese churches eventually reopened, they remained under the control of the Patriotic Church. Many Catholic pastors and priests continued to be sent to prison for refusing to renounce allegiance to Rome.Chadwick, p. 259 Second Vatican Council Bishops listen during the Second Vatican Council The Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965) introduced the most significant changes to Catholic practices since the Council of Trent, four centuries before.The Second Vatican Council Celebrating Its Achievements and the Future p. 86 Initiated by Pope John XXIII, this ecumenical council modernised the practices of the Catholic Church, allowing the Mass to be said in the vernacular (local language) and encouraging \\"fully conscious, and active participation in liturgical celebrations\\". It intended to engage the church more closely with the present world (aggiornamento), which was described by its advocates as an \\"opening of the windows\\".Duffy, pp. 270‚Äì276 In addition to changes in the liturgy, it led to changes to the church's approach to ecumenism,Duffy, Saints and Sinners (1997), pp. 272, 274 and a call to improved relations with non-Christian religions, especially Judaism, in its document Nostra aetate.Pope Paul VI. Nostra aetate: Declaration on the Relation of the Church to Non-Christian Religions . 28 October 1965. Retrieved 16 June 2011. According to Section 4: \\"True, the Jewish authorities and those who followed their lead pressed for the death of Christ; still, what happened in His passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today. Although the Church is the new people of God, the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures.\\" The council, however, generated significant controversy in implementing its reforms: proponents of the \\"Spirit of Vatican II\\" such as Swiss theologian Hans K√ºng said that Vatican II had \\"not gone far enough\\" to change church policies.Bauckham, p. 373 Traditionalist Catholics, such as Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, however, strongly criticized the council, arguing that its liturgical reforms led \\"to the destruction of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the sacraments\\", among other issues.O'Neel, Brian. \\"Holier Than Thou: How Rejection of Vatican II Led Lefebvre into Schism\\", This Rock, Volume 14, Number 4. San Diego: Catholic Answers, April 2003. Several teachings of the Catholic Church came under increased scrutiny both concurrent with and following the council; among those teachings was the church's teaching regarding the immorality of contraception. The recent introduction of hormonal contraception (including \\"the pill\\"), which were believed by some to be morally different from previous methods, prompted John XXIII to form a committee to advise him of the moral and theological issues with the new method. Pope Paul VI later expanded the committee's scope to freely examine all methods, and the committee's unreleased final report was rumoured to suggest permitting at least some methods of contraception. Paul did not agree with the arguments presented, and eventually issued Humanae vitae, saying that it upheld the constant teaching of the church against contraception. It expressly included hormonal methods as prohibited.While ruling contraception to be prohibited, Pope Paul VI did, however, consider natural family planning methods to be morally permissible if used with just cause. This document generated a largely negative response from many Catholics. John Paul II Pope John Paul II was credited as a major influence to the end of the Cold War and the fall of communism. Here with U.S. President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, in 1982. In 1978, Pope John Paul II, formerly Archbishop of Krak√≥w in the Polish People's Republic, became the first non-Italian pope in 455 years. His 26 1/2-year pontificate was one of the longest in history. Mikhail Gorbachev, the president of the Soviet Union, credited the Polish pope with hastening the fall of Communism in Europe. John Paul II sought to evangelize an increasingly secular world. He instituted World Youth Day as a \\"worldwide encounter with the pope\\" for young people; it is now held every two to three years. He travelled more than any other pope, visiting 129 countries,Maxwell-Stuart, P.G. (2006). Chronicle of the Popes: Trying to Come Full Circle. London: Thames & Hudson. p. 234. . and used television and radio as means of spreading the church's teachings. He also emphasised the dignity of work and natural rights of labourers to have fair wages and safe conditions in Laborem exercens. He emphasised several church teachings, including moral exhortations against abortion, euthanasia, and against widespread use of the death penalty, in Evangelium Vitae. From the late 20th century, the Catholic Church has been criticized for its doctrines on sexuality, its inability to ordain women, and its handling of sexual abuse cases. =21st century= In 2005, following the death of John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under John Paul, was elected. He was known for upholding traditional Christian values against secularization, WebCitation archive and for increasing use of the Tridentine Mass as found in the Roman Missal of 1962.Gledhill, Ruth \\"Pope set to bring back Latin Mass that divided the Church\\" The Times 11 October 2006.

Pope Francis Pope Francis, the current pope of the Catholic Church, succeeded Pope Benedict XVI in 2013 as the first pope from the Americas, the first from the Southern Hemisphere, and the first Pope from outside Europe since the Syrian Gregory III, who reigned in the 8th century. Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, concern for the poor and the environment, as well as his commitment to interfaith dialogue. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors.

This was reported as the first such high-level meeting between the two churches since the Great Schism of 1054. In 2014, the Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops addressed the church's ministry towards families and marriages and to Catholics in \\"irregular\\" relationships, such as those who divorced and remarried outside of the church without a declaration of nullity.

In the northern region of the country, on the right (west) bank Mekong River, it was formerly a district of Nakhon Phanom Province. The population of the municipal area was 180,600 in 2010. Mukdahan is 645 km northeast of Bangkok. Etymology The city was established at the mouth of Muk Creek () and named Mukdahan from Kaeo Mukdahan, derived from the following: *Kaeo ‡πÅ‡∏Å‡πâ‡∏ß noun or adjective: glass other than sheet glass; a glass, a tumbler; gem-like, precious, exquisite. *Muk ‡∏°‡∏∏‡∏Å noun: mother-of pearl; nacre. *Da ‡∏î‡∏≤ verb intransitive: to advance along a wide front *Han ‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£ verb intransitive or transitive: to divide; to be divided. History Prehistoric paintings and other archaeological discoveries show that the area of Mukdahan was the site of ancient communities. The modern history of the city begins late in the Ayutthaya Era (1350-1767). In the years 1767‚Äì1770, Prince Kinnari, son of Prince Suriwong, ruler in Ban Luang Phonsim of Savannakh√©t, established a settlement at the mouth of Muk Creek, across the Mekong from Savannakh√©t. In the reign of King Taksin, 1768‚Äì1782, Prince Kinnari received appointment as Phraya Chandara Sri Surat with a rank equivalent to viceroy. In 1893, Savannakh√©t District of Mukdahan was ceded to France.Ho Kaeo Mukdahan Museum Brochure Climate Mukdahan has a tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Aw).

It is an agency of the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society (MDES). One of its tasks is a nationwide census conducted every 10 years, the latest in 2010. Organization TNSO has two main administrative branches, central and local, and several other administrative units apart from those two branches. The central administration oversees 11 smaller administrative units: Local administration is composed of 76 Provincial Statistical Offices. The NSO has two other administrative bodies: an Administrative Development Group (‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏∏‡πà‡∏°‡∏á‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏û‡∏±‡∏í‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ö‡∏ö‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£) and an Internal Audit Group (‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏∏‡πà‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏ß‡∏à‡∏™‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏¢‡πÉ‡∏ô).

The first Statistical Yearbook was published for the year 1916. The Ministry of Commerce was established in August 1920, and regulation over commerce was reassigned to it, with the newly renamed Department of Public Statistical Forecasting (‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏°‡∏™‡∏ñ‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏û‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏ì‡πå‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏ò‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ì‡∏∞) under the new ministry. However, the statistics department was moved back under the Ministry of Finance in July 1921. In May 1933, the Department of Public Statistical Forecasting was once again reorganized under the Department of Commerce, Ministry of Finance, this time as a division (‡∏Å‡∏≠‡∏á), a lower administrative unit than a department, with its name changed to the Division of Statistical Forecasting Compilation (‡∏Å‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏°‡∏ß‡∏•‡∏™‡∏ñ‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏û‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏ì‡πå).

In May 1942, the division was reassigned to Department of Information under the Ministry of Commerce, but was moved back under the Secretariat of the Cabinet again in May 1943. With increases in the need for and use of official statistics, in February 1950 the Division of Statistical Forecasting Compilation was reassigned to the National Economic Council (‡∏™‡∏†‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏®‡∏£‡∏©‡∏ê‡∏Å‡∏¥‡∏à‡πÅ‡∏´‡πà‡∏á‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏¥), which at that time had the status of a subministry (‡∏ó‡∏ö‡∏ß‡∏á), not under any ministry, in order to allow for equal access to statistics-gathering services by all offices of the government.

It is the eighth member of the today 18 United World Colleges, others having been established in Wales, Canada, Norway, Italy, India, Singapore, Eswatini, United States, Costa Rica, the Netherlands, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Germany, Armenia, China, Thailand, Japan and Tanzania. Patrons of the college and the movement include Nelson Mandela, Her Majesty Queen Noor of Jordan and Charles, Prince of Wales. The first college, UWC Atlantic College, was established by the German educationalist Kurt Hahn to promote international understanding and peace. Students are selected by UWC National Committees or selection contacts in over 150 countries on merit and many receive full scholarships. UWC students are eligible to participate in the Shelby Davis Scholarship program, the largest international scholarship program for undergraduates in the world, which funds undergraduate studies for UWC students at leading US universities. Li Po Chun United World College of Hong Kong is a subvented school receiving 22 per cent of its funding from the Hong Kong Government's Direct Subsidy Scheme but commands the highest school fees of all such organisations. Admissions Aerial view of Li Po Chun UWC Campus Located in Hong Kong, Li Po Chun UWC states one of its goals as building understanding between students from Chinese cultural backgrounds and those from the rest of the world. Students have the opportunity to learn about Hong Kong and Chinese culture first hand. The school admits students from over 110 countries and from many local Hong Kong schools. The student body is made up of roughly 42% local and 58% overseas students. In the year 2008‚Äì2009, students coming from all 6 inhabited continents represented 83 countries in the world. While students from overseas are selected by the national selection committees of their home countries, local Hong Kong students are chosen by a selection committee appointed by the Home Affairs Bureau. The Hong Kong selection process has 3 rounds. The first short-listing is based on the applicant's academic performance in the past two years, their recommendation form, and a written application composed of both short and long answer questions about the applicant's extra curricular and community service experience, and their interest in UWC. At this stage, students are given the opportunity to rank their choice of college out of the 18 colleges, although final say is up to the Hong Kong Selection Committee. The short listed group of students is then invited to participate in the school's Challenge Day, a day camp consisting of group activities led by teachers and students. This is usually held in January. The final stage of the process is an individual interview with the Principal and a committee formed by government officials. There will also be an aptitude test on Math and English. Out of the 500 or so Hong Kong students that apply every year, 50 are accepted to Li Po Chun, plus an extra 12 to 14 who are sent to other overseas United World Colleges. Academics Students at the College undertake a 2-year International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. Li Po Chun United World College takes advantage of its location as a meeting place of east and west. The College offers Chinese at all levels, from beginners to advanced literature. Li Po Chun's average IB grade has hovered around 38 points in recent years, one of the highest averages worldwide. In 2007, 5 students gained perfect scores of 45, which together with the other United World Colleges, represented over 15% of all perfect scorers achieved in the world. Due to these academic achievements LPCUWC is considered one of the top high schools in the World. In late 2007, the Wall Street Journal identified the College as one of the world's top 50 schools for its success in preparing students to enter Ivy League universities, one of only two schools located outside the US, and the only UWC outside the US to make it into the list. Quan Cai The CAS (Creativity, Activity, Service) program is a part of the requirements for an International Baccalaureate diploma. It requires a set number of hours in each of the 3 areas. Li Po Chun's adaptation of this system is called the \\"Quan Cai\\" program (\\"ÂÖ®Êâç\\" in Chinese, meaning \\"all-round development\\" ).[5] The program has 5 components, namely community service, creativity, action, campus support and global concerns. The services are unique in that students sign up for a service that spans entire year, while the other 4 activities are generally only 1 term (half a year) activities. A student is required to officially participate in 4 terms of service, 3 of campus support, 3 of global concerns, 2 of action and 1 term of creativity in their 2 years at LPC. There is a great emphasis on community service at the College. They include a variety of projects ranging from helping asylum seekers, to visiting nursing homes and aiding the elderly, helping underprivileged children with schooling and the lending of facilities to services outside of Hong Kong, such as Initiative for Peace. The school also competes in most of the sports available as Quan Cais. This includes football, basketball, athletics, volleyball and badminton. The flexibility of the Quan Cai program allows students to start new activities (called an \\"initiative\\") at any time, and if successful the school adopts the activity, making it official. Caf√© The Caf√© team organizes performance evenings that consist of the College community sharing dances, songs and poems with each other. It is an event that works to boost morale on campus and bring together the College for one night. The Caf√© team also cooks a wide variety of baked goods that are sold throughout the show with the proceeds going to a different charity each Caf√©. Caf√© is considered one of the most popular activities on campus. Global Issues Forum Within the academic timetable, which works on an 8-day cycle, the last block of day 8 is reserved for Global Issues Forum. The entire student body and members of the staff gather to listen to a presentation, given by fellow students, on a global issue, and then topic is opened for discussion. Past topics have included democracy in Hong Kong and globally, unsustainable fishing, censorship in China and around the world, the future of the EU, the impacts of migration and cultural immersion, sexism, the value of education etc. Not only is it a chance for community members (students and staff) to learn about events and issues worldwide from invaluable sources, but it is also a venue for the sharing of diverse political perspectives. Cultural Evenings The Chinese Cultural Evening takes place every year, while the other evenings, namely the North American Cultural Evening (NACE), Caribbean and Latin American Cultural Evening (CLACE), Middle East, South and Central Asia Cultural Evening (MESCA), Asia- Pacific Evening of Culture (APEC), African Cultural Evening (ACE) and European Cultural Evening (ECE) take place once every two years, with 3 other regions every year. China Week Unlike other United World Colleges, first year students travel to China, do community service, and experience everyday Chinese life. Annual China week projects include: Teaching English to children of the Yao Tribe in China, visiting an elderly home and helping mentally and physically handicapped children in Guangdong province, working with lepers in Yunnan province and working with the Amity Foundation, China, and Habitat for Humanity. A popular trip involves hiking, cycling, kayaking and rock climbing in the Yangshuo area.[6] Project Week Annual project weeks last nine days in March and are for students to lead and work on projects in East, South, and Southeast Asia. Some recent projects have included: Helping rehabilitate a tsunami-struck school in Sri Lanka, performing plays for children in Bangkok, working with children at the Christina Noble Children's Foundation in Ho Chi Minh City and travelling to North Korea to learn about life and affairs in a country that much of the world knows little about, and working in several children's orphanages run by the Happy Tree Organisation in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Some students also take on other challenging projects during this time such as travelling to Vietnam overland from Hong Kong and human rights evaluations in Philippines. Some students also stay in Hong Kong, where there are opportunities to do service locally. Graduates Students can choose from several options for post-Li Po Chun experiences. Some graduates receive offers from top universities around the world, with most students earning or qualifying for significant scholarships. Others choose to pursue \\"3rd year options\\" which can range from service to traveling, most of which have some sort of cultural immersion. Others go straight into the work force or return to their home countries for a gap year.

Nonfirstorderizable sentences are sometimes presented as evidence that first- order logic is not adequate to capture the nuances of meaning in natural language. The term was coined by George Boolos in his well-known paper \\"To Be is to Be a Value of a Variable (or to Be Some Values of Some Variables).\\" Boolos argued that such sentences call for second-order symbolization, which can be interpreted as plural quantification over the same domain as first- order quantifiers use, without postulation of distinct \\"second-order objects\\" (properties, sets, etc.).  Examples  * The concept of identity cannot be defined in first-order languages, merely indiscernibility. * The compactness theorem implies that graph connectivity cannot be expressed in first-order logic. * The Archimedean property that may be used to identify the real numbers among the real closed fields. * A standard example is the Geach‚ÄìKaplan sentence: \\"Some critics admire only one another.\\" : If Axy is understood to mean \\"x admires y,\\" and the universe of discourse is the set of all critics, then a reasonable translation of the sentence into second order logic is: : \\\\exists X ( \\\\exists x,y (Xx \\\\land Xy \\\\land Axy) \\\\land \\\\exists x eg Xx \\\\land \\\\forall x\\\\, \\\\forall y (Xx \\\\land Axy \\\\rightarrow Xy)) : That this formula has no first-order equivalent can be seen as follows. Substitute the formula (y = x + 1 v x = y + 1) for Axy. The result, : \\\\exists X ( \\\\exists x,y (Xx \\\\land Xy \\\\land (y = x + 1 \\\\lor x = y + 1)) \\\\land \\\\exists x eg Xx \\\\land \\\\forall x\\\\, \\\\forall y (Xx \\\\land (y = x + 1 \\\\lor x = y + 1) \\\\rightarrow Xy)) : states that there is a nonempty set which is closed under the predecessor and successor operations and yet does not contain all numbers. Thus, it is true in all nonstandard models of arithmetic but false in the standard model. Since no first-order sentence has this property, the result follows.

Much of this law has been established by a few important cases, and some of the more significant of these are addressed in this article. Peerage disputes The Crown, as fount of honour, may determine all petitions claiming peerages. The Sovereign upon the Attorney-General's advice can grant the claim or, in contentious matters, send it to the House of Lords, who in turn send it to the Select Committee for Privileges. (The House of Lords appoints 16 peers - including the Chairman of Committees - to the Committee.) Next, the sovereign makes a final decision based upon the Committee for Privileges' recommendation. The Committee for Privileges also has a role in terminating abeyant peerages. A co-heir may petition the sovereign for a termination of the abeyance in his or her favour; the sovereign can choose to grant the petition, but if there is any doubt as to the petitioner's pedigree, the claim is usually referred to the Committee for Privileges. If the claim is unopposed, the Committee will generally award the claim to the petitioner. Under a decision of 1927, however, the Committee can deny a claim if the peerage has been in abeyance for more than 100 years, or if the petitioner holds less than 1/3 of the claim (an eldest son would inherit all of his parent's claim, while daughters divide their parent's claim amongst them in the absence of sons). Incidentally, the House of Lords made a standing order in 1954 directing that the Committee may deny a claim if the co-heirs have entered into an \\"improper arrangement.\\" This rule prevents co- heirs of multiple baronies by writ from agreeing not to contest each other's claims, thereby dividing the baronies by writ amongst themselves. In claims regarding the Peerage of Scotland, the Court of the Lord Lyon King of Arms in Scotland has a major role in identifying the rightful heir or heiress to an aristocratic title. These titles (as in England) are composed of Dukedoms, Marquessates, Earldoms, and Viscounties, plus Lordships (which are the equivalent of Baronies in the Peerage of England). Only the Lords have jurisdiction over succession to peerages, but the Lyon Court does have jurisdiction over succession to coats-of-arms. Under Scottish law, an individual's heir succeeds to his arms undifferenced, while other descendants may succeed to arms differenced by special marks, called cadency marks. The case before the Lyon Court involves a dispute as to who may lawfully succeed to a deceased peer's (i.e., aristocrat's) arms \\"undifferenced\\" -- the lawful successor to the arms will normally also be the successor to the peerage. For further information about the Committee for Privileges, see: https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldprivi.htm Significant cases =The Earl of Bristol's Case (1626)= The reign of Charles I was marked by the growing absolutism of the monarchy (which eventually contributed to the English Civil War and Charles' execution). In 1626, the King decided not to issue a writ of summons to John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol, who was charged with, but not convicted of, high treason. Since he could not be admitted to the House without a writ, Lord Bristol made a petition to the House of Lords. The Committee for Privileges reported, \\"after diligent search, no precedent being found that any writ of summons hath been detained from any peer that is capable of sitting in the House of Parliament; and considering withal how far it may trench into the right of every member of this House, whether sitting by ancient right of inheritance or by patent, to have their writs detained; the Lords Committees are all of opinion, That it will be necessary for this House humbly to beseech His Majesty, that a writ of summons may be sent to this petitioner, and to such other Lords to whom no writ of summons hath been directed for this Parliament, excepting such as are made incapable to sit in Parliament by judgment of Parliament or any other legal judgment.\\" There was some delay, but Lord Bristol eventually received the King's writ of summons. The writ was accompanied by a letter from the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, Thomas Coventry; it read, \\"I ... signify His Majesty's pleasure herein further; That, howsoever he gives way to the awarding of the writ, yet his meaning thereby is not to discharge any former direction for restraint of your Lordship's coming hither; but that you continue under the same restriction as you did before, so as your Lordship's personal attendance is to be forborne.\\" Lord Bristol nevertheless attended Parliament, arguing that a writ personally issued by the Sovereign was of more weight than the letter of a Lord Keeper. The practice of denying writs of summons to eligible peers has since been abandoned. =Rex v Purbeck (1678)= For the early part of English history, peers sometimes surrendered their peerages to the Crown. Most surrenders occurred during the early years of the nation, but surrender occurred as late as 1640, when Roger Stafford, 6th Baron Stafford was ordered to surrender his dignity to the Crown in return for eight hundred pounds sterling. Later that year, however, the House of Lords, in order to guard the position of its members, which had been threatened by the power to order surrenders of peerages, resolved, \\"(i) That no person that hath any Honour of him and a Peer of this Realm, may alien or transfer the Honour to any other Person, (ii) That no Peer of this Realm can drown or extinguish his Honour, but that it descends to his descendants, neither by Surrender, Grant, Fine, nor any other conveyance to the King.\\" Nevertheless, the Crown accepted the surrender of the Viscountcy of Purbeck, which had been created for John Villiers in 1619. In 1624, Frances, Viscountess Purbeck, who had been separated from her husband and engaged in a relationship with another man, gave birth to a presumably illegitimate son, Robert. In 1657, when the first Viscount died, Robert surrendered his peerage under the presumption that he was illegitimate (which could not be proven beyond doubt). He was then elected to the House of Commons. In 1660, he was charged before the House of Lords for \\"treasonable and blasphemous speech.\\" He asserted that, since he was a member of the House of Commons, the Lords had no right to punish him. The House of Lords responded by declaring that he was not a commoner, but a peer, and was therefore subject to the authority of the Lords. Immediately, he \\"levied a fine\\" to the King, surrendering his peerages to the Crown. In 1676, his son applied for a writ of summons to Parliament, claiming the viscountcy. The matter was referred to the House of Lords, which unanimously ruled in Rex v Purbeck that no \\"fine\\" could allow a peer to dispose of his peerage. Peerages in the Peerage of Scotland were not subject to these rules prior to the Acts of Union 1707. In Scots law prior to that date, it was possible to surrender a peerage and receive a regrant, the procedure being known as a novodamus. One instance was the novodamus of the Dukedom of Queensberry, the new dukedom having a remainder preventing the title from passing to the second Duke's eldest son, who was insane. Additionally, it is now possible (under the Peerage Act 1963) to \\"disclaim\\" a peerage--doing so deprives the holder of the peerage for life, but does not destroy it, as it descends upon the death of the peer making the disclaimer. =Mar Peerage Case (1875)= The Earldom of Mar is the oldest extant title in Great Britain, and probably in Europe. The origins of the title are unclear, but is known that in 1404, a man named Alexander Stewart forced the suo jure Countess, Isabel Douglas, to sign a charter conveying the peerage to him and his heirs. Later, the Countess married Stewart and revoked the old charter. She then agreed to convey the earldom to him for his life, following which it would pass to her own heirs. In 1426, Lord Mar resigned his title and the King of Scots regranted it, thereby legitimising his wife's actions. The King specified that the earldom and lands of Mar would revert to the Crown upon the death of the Earl, which occurred in 1435. Robert, Lord Erskine, the heir to the deceased Earl, claimed the earldom under the Countess' charter, but the King claimed it under his own patent. In 1457, James II obtained a court order favouring his position; the lands, therefore, were transferred to the Crown. Later Kings granted the earldom and associated lands to members of the Royal Family. In each case, however, the earldom returned to the Crown either because of the treason of the holder or a failure to produce heirs. Mary, Queen of Scots, finally did justice in 1565 by restoring the earldom to John Erskine, the heir of the dispossessed Robert Erskine. Upon the death of the ninth Earl of Mar in 1866, the earldom was disputed between two of his kinsmen. The heir-general to the earldom was John Goodeve-Erskine, son of the sister of the ninth Earl. Walter Erskine, 12th Earl of Kellie, claimed the title as heir-male (i.e. senior living descendant through sons only) of the seventh Earl of Mar. Goodeve-Erskine's claim was originally unopposed; he even participated in elections for representative peers. Later, the Earl of Kellie petitioned to be recognised as a peer. He died before it could be considered; the claim was carried on by his son, also named Walter, the 13th Earl of Kellie. The petition made several claims: *The original Earldom of Mar was a territorial title rather than a title of peerage and was therefore \\"indivisible.\\" (In other words, the territory could not be separated from the title.) *Alexander Stewart obtained a new Royal charter for the earldom, rather than receiving it in right of his wife Isabel. *After the death of Alexander Stewart, his lands were passed to the Sovereign in accordance with the patent, and thereafter were disposed of by the Crown. *As the territorial earldom was \\"indivisible,\\" upon the termination of the territory, the earldom must have ended also. *Therefore, since the territorial earldom had already become non-existent, Mary's 1565 grant was not a revival of that title. Rather, it was a totally new creation, this time in the form of a peerage title. *Since the instrument of Queen Mary's 1565 grant cannot be found, the presumption ought to be that the earldom passes to heirs-male, and not to heirs-general. Thus, the Earl of Kellie is entitled to the Earldom of Mar as he is the late Earl of Mar's heir male, while John Goodeve-Erskine was an heir-general. Goodeve-Erskine had different ideas, however. He portrayed the Crown's takeover of the territorial earldom not as pursuant to a lawful patent, but rather as an act of tyranny. He argued: *James I, in a tyrannical act, seized the lands of Alexander Stewart, when these should have passed to Robert, Lord Erskine. *The \\"true\\" Earls never agreed to terminate their claim to the earldom. *Queen Mary's 1565 grant was a restitution of the old territorial earldom rather than a new creation. *Because the title is a restoration of a territorial earldom, and because the territorial earldom could pass to heirs-general, John Goodeve-Erskine was the rightful heir, being the late Earl of Mar's heir-general. The House of Lords Committee on Privileges, which did not include any Scottish members, ruled in 1875 that the Earldom of Mar was newly created in 1565, passed only to heirs-male, and therefore belonged to the Earl of Kellie, and not to Goodeve-Erskine. The Lord Chancellor, Roundell Palmer, 1st Baron Selborne, declared it to be \\"final, right or wrong, and not to be questioned\\". Many Scottish peers were outraged; the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres even wrote a two-volume history of the earldom refuting the ruling of the Committee. It was argued that the 1565 earldom was merely a product of the imagination of the House of Lords, and that Goodeve-Erskine was the true heir to the ancient earldom. Many in Parliament agreed, but the decision of the Lords could not be overturned. Instead, the Earldom of Mar Restitution Act was passed (without dissent); it declared that because of the doubts relating to the 1565 creation, it would be assumed that there are two Earldoms of Mar. The earldom created in 1565 would be held by the Earl of Kellie. The ancient earldom, however, was declared to be still in existence, and was given to John Goodeve-Erskine. =Wensleydale Peerage Case (1856)= The appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords grew from the ancient authority of the Curia Regis, or King's Court, to hear appeals from the lower courts. Following the development of Parliament, members of the House of Lords sat along with the Great Officers of State and various senior judges. By the 14th century, the House of Lords gained the sole power to decide such appeals. The power fell into disuse in the 16th century, but was revived in the 17th century. Many cases were heard by Lords with no legal education or experience, and this led to public discontent. It was suggested that more judges be appointed to the House of Lords, but it was not desired that their descendants continue to sit by virtue of the peerages they would have inherited had the judges been created hereditary peers. It was therefore suggested that the group of judges admitted to Parliament for the duration of their respective lives be added to the class of hereditary peers of the realm. Life peerages themselves were not unprecedented, though it was unclear whether or not life peers were by virtue of their titles entitled to sit in the House of Lords. In most cases, the peerages were granted to women, but they were not eligible for a seat in the House of Lords; there was no example of a male sitting in the House by virtue of a life peerage for over four centuries. Another precedent cited were the examples of peerages with remainders other than to the heirs-male of the body of the grantee: the Dukedom of Dover (1707; to the younger son of the grantee, and his heirs-male, though the eldest son was still living), the Earldom of Northumberland (to the son-in-law of the grantee, and his heirs-male), the Earldom of de Grey (1816; heirs-male of the grantee's sister), and several others. The first holder, in effect, was made a peer for life, while the second holder received a hereditary peerage subject to the ordinary rules of inheritance. Several authorities declared that the Crown had the power to add life peers to the House of Lords. Therefore, on the advice of her ministers, Queen Victoria created the Barony of Wensleydale, a life peerage, for Sir James Parke, a Baron of the Court of the Exchequer (baron in this case being a judicial rather than a noble title), in 1856. When Parliament met, Lord Wensleydale, being ill with gout, failed to present himself and take his seat. Thereafter, John Singleton Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst moved that the entire matter be referred to the Committee for Privileges. During the debates, it was pointed out that no case of a life peer sitting in the House of Lords had occurred for over four centuries -- the question, then, was, whether or not the power of the Crown was lost with time. The ministers of the Crown pointed out the doctrine that the Royal prerogative was not fettered by the passage of time. On the other hand, it was pointed out that formerly, the Sovereign's power over the composition of Parliament was without limit: peers entitled to seats in Parliament were denied writs of summons; constituencies were enfranchised or disenfranchised in the House of Commons through the exercise of the Royal prerogative. That power, however, had been vitiated by the time of the Wensleydale case. Thus, it was submitted that the Crown could not change the constitutional character of Parliament alone; rather, an Act of Parliament, with the authority of the Sovereign and both Houses, was necessitated. Ministers argued that, without a reference from the Crown, the House of Lords was powerless to consider the matter. Nevertheless, the House of Lords voted to send the matter to the Committee for Privileges, one hundred and thirty- eight voting in favour, one hundred and five voting against. The Committee reported to the House that \\"neither the letters patent, nor the letters patent with the usual writ of summons issued in pursuance thereof, can entitle the grantee to sit and vote in Parliament.\\" The Queen submitted to the decision of the House of Lords; Lord Wensleydale eventually took his seat as a hereditary peer. =Buckhurst Peerage Case (1876)= The Buckhurst Peerage Case established the principle that once a peer inherits the peerage, he is forever \\"ennobled in blood\\" and cannot be deprived of it (except by Act of Parliament). The barony was created for Elizabeth Sackville-West, the wife of George John Sackville-West, 5th Earl De La Warr, with a provision designed to keep the earldom and barony separate. The letters patent directed that, if the holder of the barony ever succeeded to the earldom, then he would be automatically deprived of the barony as if he died naturally without issue, the barony being diverted to another line. The fifth Earl died in 1869 and was succeeded by his son Charles as sixth Earl. In 1870, the Baroness Buckhurst died, being succeeded not by the sixth Earl De La Warr, but by her younger son Reginald, who later succeeded to the earldom in 1873, as 7th Earl. The letters patent said that, by succeeding to the earldom, he would be deprived of the Barony of Buckhurst, which was then claimed by a third brother, Mortimer. The House of Lords, however, refused to recognise the \\"shifting remainder\\" in the peerage. They ruled that once a peer succeeds to a title, he cannot be deprived of it except by an Act of Parliament, whatever the terms of the creation. Note, however, that it is possible to prevent a person from succeeding to a peerage in the first place, but not possible to deprive a person of a peerage after having succeeded to it. Thus, Charles Sackville- West, who already held the earldom at the time of his mother's death, was never allowed to succeed to his mother's peerage. On the other hand, Reginald Sackville-West succeeded to the barony but was later stripped of it--an impermissible action. Lawyers for Mortimer Sackville-West argued that the reasoning that peers could not be deprived of peerages was flawed. They pointed out that, if a peer succeeds to the monarchy, then that person is immediately deprived of the peerage, which \\"merges in the Crown\\". Hugh McCalmont Cairns, 1st Baron Cairns explained the seeming contradiction by suggesting, \\"The fountain and source of all dignities [i.e., the Sovereign] cannot hold a dignity from himself. The dignity ... terminates, not by virtue of any provisions in its creation but from the absolute incapacity of the sovereign to hold a dignity.\\" Mortimer Sackville-West therefore was not allowed to succeed to the Barony of Buckhurst, which remained vested in his eldest surviving brother, Reginald. He was consoled, however, by being independently created Baron Sackville. =The Viscountess Rhondda's Claim (1922)= Women were formerly excluded from the House of Lords, as well as from other public positions. The Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act of 1919 provided that \\"A person shall not be disqualified by sex or marriage from the exercise of any public function.\\" In 1922, the Viscountess Rhondda, a peeress suo jure, claimed a seat in the House on the grounds that sitting in Parliament constituted the exercise of a public function. At first, the matter was referred to the Law Lords, who were unanimously of the opinion that women were qualified to sit in the House by virtue of the act. The House, however, recommitted the question to the full Privileges Committee. The opposition to the Viscountess Rhondda was led by the Lord Chancellor, Frederick Edwin Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead. The Lord Chancellor argued that, to change the composition of the House of Lords, Parliament would have to use clear words; vague words like \\"public function\\" would not suffice. The Committee for Privileges agreed by a vote of twenty-two to four. Women remained excluded from the House of Lords until 1958, when life peeresses were admitted to the House. Hereditary peeresses were admitted in 1963, though there have always been very few of them, since most hereditary peerages can only be inherited by males. =Petition of the Earl of Antrim (1967)= Ireland had, from 1801, the right to send twenty-eight representative peers to the House of Lords. In 1922, with the foundation of the Irish Free State, such elections ceased, but any individuals already elected were allowed to stay in the House of Lords. The last surviving Irish representative peer, Francis Needham, 4th Earl of Kilmorey, died in 1961. In 1965, Randal McDonnell, 8th Earl of Antrim, along with some other Irish peers, petitioned the House of Lords to recognise their right to elect representatives, the matter being sent to the Committee for Privileges. The Committee ruled against the Irish peers. The Lord Reid, a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, delivered the opinion with which most members of the Committee agreed, determining against the petitioners' argument that representative peers represented Irish peers, not Ireland by pointing out that the Act of Union gave them seats \\"on the part of Ireland.\\" Since the island had been divided into the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland, there was no such political entity called \\"Ireland\\" which the representative peers could represent. Lord Reid wrote, \\"A statutory provision is impliedly repealed if a later enactment brings to an end a state of things the continuance of which is essential for its operation.\\" The Lord Wilberforce, also a Lord of Appeal, disagreed that a major enactment such as the Act of Union could be repealed by implication. He argued instead that the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1921 --which was silent on the election of representative peers--abolished the posts of Lord Chancellor of Ireland and Clerk of the Crown in Ireland. The Lord Chancellor of Ireland was responsible for calling elections of representative peers, and the Clerk of the Crown in Ireland was responsible for sending peers their ballots. Since these offices had been abolished, Lord Wilberforce argued, there was no mechanism by which Irish peers could be elected. The petitioners did not bring up the point that Northern Ireland remained a part of the United Kingdom. Lord Reid's objections would then be rebutted, as representative peers would sit on the part of Northern Ireland. Similarly, Lord Wilberforce's arguments relating to the removal of the mechanism for the election could be answered, as the Lord Chancellor of Ireland and the Clerk of the Crown in Ireland did have replacements in Northern Ireland. Burke's Peerage & Baronetage suggests that the reason for which the arguments relating to Northern Ireland \\"was that leading counsel for the petitioning Irish peers was convinced that the members of the Committee for Privileges were with him on what he considered was his best argument and did not want to alienate them by introducing another point.\\" The House of Lords later agreed to the Committee's decision. In order to prevent further appeals on the matter, the Parliament passed in 1971, as a part of the annual Statute Law Repeals Bill, a clause revoking the sections of the Act of Union relating to the election of Irish representative peers. However, the matter did not end there. In 1991, a solicitor named Andrew Turek published an article in the Cambridge Law Journal, in which he suggested that, if Lord Reid was indeed accurate in suggesting that Irish peers had no further right to elect peers because the political entity being represented (Ireland) no longer existed, then the right of representative peers ought to have ended in 1922, when the Irish Free State was formed. He suggested that there was no basis for calling representative peers who had already been elected to Parliament. Then, Turek pointed out the principle of the creation of a peerage by writ. He argued that if an individual was not entitled to attend the House of Lords, but nonetheless received a writ of summons (as the remaining Irish representative peers did following the formation of the Irish Free State), then such individuals were automatically granted a new peerage. In 1995, Barry Maxwell, 12th Baron Farnham applied for a writ of summons because his grandfather, the 11th Baron and a representative peer, had been summoned by writ when there was no basis for doing so, and that therefore a new barony was created for him. The Lords, however, held that there was, in the first place, no error in issuing writs to the Irish representative peers after the formation of the Irish Free State. The Privileges Committee agreed with the Attorney-General that the Irish peers had been elected for life, and that the formation of the Irish Free State only implicitly repealed the right of the Irish peers to hold further elections. =Reference on the House of Lords Bill (1999)= In 1999, when the House of Lords Bill sought to deprive hereditary peers of the automatic right to sit in the House of Lords, the question arose as to whether or not such a bill would violate the Treaty of Union uniting England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain. The House of Lords referred the entire question to the Committee for Privileges. The Government asserted that it was inappropriate for the Committee to give an opinion on the hypothetical effect of a bill that was yet to be enacted, instead of fulfilling its usual role of applying already existing law. The Committee still reported to the House of Lords, however, since the whole House had made an order referring the matter to it. The first issue referred to the committee related to the effect of writs of summons. Writs of summons are issued to peers upon the summoning of each new Parliament. The central question was whether writs of summons have a continuing effect throughout Parliament, or whether their effect was \\"spent\\" once a peer entered Parliament and handed it in to the Clerk. The portions of the Bill relevant to the issue were: \\"No-one shall be a member of the House of Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage ... Accordingly, any writ of summons issued for the present Parliament in right of a hereditary peerage shall not have effect after [the present] Session.\\" The complaint raised by the Lord Mayhew of Twysden was that the bill would not exclude hereditary peers for the remainder of that Parliament (but not future Parliaments), even though the bill provided that writs of summons already issued would be of no effect. He suggested that such writs were already of no effect, because once a peer attends the House of Lords and presents his writ, the effect of the writ is spent, and the peer immediately becomes a member of the House until Parliament is dissolved. (Once a new Parliament is called, new writs of summons must be issued.) The Lord Mayhew's counsel argued, \\"The purpose of a writ of summons is to bring a peer to parliament for the first time. It tells him to come and join the parliament. He then hands in the writ. It has had its effect. He is there; it is no longer needed; it does not keep him: otherwise he would have to return it daily. Once he has handed the writ in, it is his status as lord of that parliament ('a member of the House of Lords') which confers rights and duties.\\" Counsel suggested further that there were separate punishments for failure to obey the writ by attending and for leaving before Parliament concluded without a leave of absence. The Government, meanwhile, argued otherwise. They noted that \\"The command is not spent once the peer turns up at Parliament--the monarch desires the counsel of the peer throughout the Parliament, and the command expressed in the writ ... continue to have effect throughout that Parliament. Plainly, the monarch's command would not be fully obeyed by a peer who answered the summons, arrived at Parliament and then immediately departed again.\\" Thus, they suggested, it was (and is) necessary for peers to obtain leaves of absence if they intended not to attend the House of Lords. The Committee agreed with the Government, ruling that writs of summons have effect throughout Parliament. The other issue referred to the Committee involved the Articles of Union of 1707, uniting England and Scotland. The Articles guaranteed Scotland sixteen representatives in the House of Lords, but that the House of Lords Bill would rescind such a guarantee. In suggesting that the Bill did indeed violate the Articles of Union, it was submitted that, prior to Union, the Parliament of Scotland was entitled to impose conditions, and that one fundamental condition was a guarantee of representation of Scotland in both Houses of Parliament. It was implied, further, that the Peerage Act did not violate the requirement of Scottish representation, set out in Article XXII, by allowing all Scottish peers to sit in the House of Lords: as long as a minimum of sixteen seats were reserved for Scotland, the principles of the Article would be upheld. It was further argued that the only way to rescind the requirement of Article XXII would be to dissolve the Union between England and Scotland, which, of course, the House of Lords Bill did not seek to do. Counsel for the Government, however, put forward a different view. Firstly, it was noted that the Peerage Act explicitly repealed the portions of the Articles of Union relating to elections of representative peers, and that no parliamentary commentators had raised doubts as to the validity of those repeals. As Article XXII had been repealed, there was nothing specific in the Treaty that the bill transgressed. To address the argument that the principle (rather than the details) of representation contained in the Article had not been, nor could have been, repealed by the Peerage Act or any other Act of Parliament, the Government submitted that the election of Scottish representative peers had not been \\"entrenched.\\" Other provisions had been entrenched by the Treaty of Union: for example, England and Scotland were united \\"forever,\\" the Court of Session was to \\"remain in all time coming within Scotland as it is now constituted,\\" and the establishment of the Church of Scotland was \\"effectually and unalterably secured.\\" Article XXII, however, did not include words of entrenchment, and, it was argued, was open to amendment. It was further pointed out by the Government that, even if the election of Scottish peers were entrenched, Parliament could amend the provision under the doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty. Though the position of the Church of Scotland was \\"unalterably\\" secured, the Universities (Scotland) Act 1853 repealed the requirement that professors declare their faith before assuming a position. In Ireland, meanwhile, the Church of Ireland was entirely disestablished in 1869, though the Articles of Union with Ireland had clearly entrenched the Church's establishment. In 1922, the union with Ireland was dissolved, though the Kingdoms were united by the Articles \\"forever.\\" It was therefore suggested that Parliament could, if it pleased, repeal the Articles of Union as well as any underlying principles. The Committee unanimously found that the Articles of Union would not be breached by the House of Lords Bill if it were enacted. The bill did receive Royal Assent, and from 2000, hereditary peers have not had the automatic right to sit in Parliament. Scotland, however, does not remain entirely unrepresented, as a significant number of life peers are domiciled in Scotland. =Black v Chr√©tien (2001)= In 1999, the U.K. Prime Minister, Tony Blair, recommended a Canadian newspaper magnate, Conrad Black, to be raised to the peerage. Representatives of the Canadian Government indicated their approval, but immediately before Queen Elizabeth II could grant the peerage, the Prime Minister of Canada, Jean Chr√©tien, advised her not to elevate Black. Chr√©tien cited the Nickle Resolution, which ordered that an address be presented to the British Sovereign requesting that he not award \\"any title of honour or titular distinction.\\" The resolution was passed by the Canadian House of Commons, but no address was ever presented. The Queen nevertheless chose to comply with Chr√©tien's advice. Black then sued Prime Minister Chr√©tien for abuse of power, misfeasance in public office and negligence, and the Canadian Government for negligent misrepresentation. He requested the Ontario Court of Appeals to make three declarations, namely: that the Canadian Government had no right to advise the Queen on the conferral of a peerage on a dual citizen (which Black became), that the Prime Minister abused his power by requesting the Queen not to grant the peerage, and that the Government of Canada negligently misrepresented to him that, if he became a dual citizen and refrained from using his title in Canada, he could receive the peerage. At the heart of the issue was the \\"honours prerogative,\\" that is, the right of the Crown to grant dignities to its subjects. Theoretically, the honours prerogative may be exercised only by the Sovereign or a representative thereof (in this case, the Governor-General of Canada), though in practice it is seldom utilised but on the advice of Ministers of the Crown. While many royal prerogatives may be questioned in court, the honours prerogative is non- justiciable. Therefore, if the Prime Minister was advising on the usage of the honours prerogative, his actions may not be reviewed in Court. As John Laskin, a Justice of the Court of Appeals of Ontario, indicated, \\"The refusal to grant an honour is far removed from the refusal to grant a passport or a pardon, where important individual interests are at stake. Unlike the refusal of a peerage, the refusal of a passport or a pardon has real adverse consequences for the person affected.\\" The Court then refused to make the declarations sought by Black. While the non-justiciability of the honours prerogative was affirmed, the decision did not address the issue as to what would occur in the event of conflict between ministers of the Crown. Though a single individual is Queen of both the United Kingdom and Canada, the Crowns of the nations are separate. As Noel Cox suggests, \\"The Queen should act solely upon the advice of British ministers when awarding a British peerage. If her Canadian Prime Minister offers her advice, it is to her as Queen of Canada. As Queen of Canada she is powerless to prevent the conferring of a British title, though she could consult with herself, wearing her other hat, as it were.\\" Should Blair have chosen to insist upon the matter, the Queen would have elevated Black to a British peerage, the protestations of the Canadian Government notwithstanding. Indeed, in 2001, two Canadians--the Vice-Chancellor of Queen's University Belfast, George Bain, and a billionaire, Terence Matthews-- were awarded knighthoods without consultation with Canadian authorities. Black himself was made Baron Black of Crossharbour after he renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2001.

He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman from 1959 to 1980, most notably as a member of the San Francisco Giants for whom he played with for 19 seasons. Known as \\"Stretch\\" during his playing days, and later also nicknamed \\"Mac\\" and \\"Willie Mac,\\". McCovey also played for the San Diego Padres and Oakland Athletics in the latter part of his MLB career. A fearsome left-handed power hitter, at the time of his retirement in 1980, McCovey ranked second only to Babe Ruth in career home runs among left-handed batters, and seventh overall. As of 2020, he ranks 20th overall on baseball's all-time home run list. He was a six-time All-Star, three-time home run champion, MVP, and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986 in his first year of eligibility, only the 16th man so honored, at the time. McCovey was known as a dead-pull line drive hitter, causing some teams to employ a shift against him. McCovey was called \\"the scariest hitter in baseball\\" by pitcher Bob Gibson, seconded by similarly feared slugger Reggie Jackson.Reggie Jackson, Bob Gibson, Lonnie Wheeler. Sixty Feet, Six Inches: A Hall of Fame Pitcher & a Hall of Fame Hitter Talk about How the Game is Played, Random House, Inc., 2009 McCovey hit 521 home runs, 231 of them in Candlestick Park, the most in that park by any player. A home run he hit on September 16, 1966, was described as the longest ever hit in that stadium. Early life McCovey was born in Mobile, Alabama, the seventh child of ten born to Frank McCovey, a railroad worker, and Esther. He began working part time at the age of 12 and dropped out of high school in order to work full time. Professional career =Minor Leagues= Despite being passed on by scout Ed Scott, who signed Hank Aaron for the Negro American League Indianapolis Clowns, McCovey was invited to a New York Giants tryout camp in Melbourne, Florida while he was living and working in Los Angeles. The invitation came from Giants scout and former Negro League owner Alex Pompez. In 1955 McCovey made his professional debut. The Sandersville Giants of the Georgia State League in Sandersville, Georgia had McCovey on their roster, with McCovey having signed a contract for $175.00 per month. McCovey was 17 years old, 6'2\\", 165 pounds, and proceeded to hit .305 with 19 home runs, scoring 113 runs in 107 games.https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/2a692514 On his way to the Major Leagues, McCovey played for a San Francisco Giants' farm club in Dallas, Texas that was part of the Class AA Texas League. He did not participate when his team played in Shreveport, Louisiana due to segregation in that city. He later played for the Pacific Coast League Phoenix Giants just prior to being called up by the San Francisco Giants. =Major Leagues= San Francisco Giants (1959‚Äì1973) In his Major League debut on July 30, 1959, McCovey went four-for-four against Hall-of-Famer Robin Roberts of the Philadelphia Phillies with two singles and two triples. In 52 major league games, he had a .354 batting average and 13 home runs. He was named the National League's (NL) Rookie of the Year. He won the NL Player of the Month Award in August, his first full month in the majors (.373, 8 HR, 22 RBI). He had a 22-game hitting streak, setting the mark for San Francisco Giants rookies, four short of the all-time team record. Three years later, McCovey helped the Giants to the 1962 World Series against the New York Yankees, the only World Series appearance of his career. In the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7, with two outs and the Giants trailing 1‚Äì0, Willie Mays was on second base and Matty Alou was on third base. Any base hit would likely have won the championship for the Giants. McCovey hit a hard line drive that was snared by the Yankees' second baseman Bobby Richardson, ending the series with a Yankees' win. The moment was immortalized in two Peanuts comic strips by Charles M. Schulz. The first ran on December 22, 1962, with Charlie Brown sitting silently alongside Linus for three panels before suddenly lamenting, \\"Why couldn't McCovey have hit the ball just three feet higher?\\" The second, from January 28, 1963, featured Charlie Brown breaking an identical extended silence by crying, \\"Or why couldn't McCovey have hit the ball even two feet higher?\\" 26 years later, on the occasion of his Hall of Fame election, McCovey was asked how he would like his career to be remembered. ‚ÄúAs the guy who hit the ball over Bobby Richardson‚Äôs head in the seventh game,‚Äù replied McCovey.https://www.sfchronicle.com/giants/annkillion/article/There-was-no- finer-Giant-than-Willie-McCovey-13360905.php McCovey spent many years at the heart of the Giants' batting order, along with fellow Hall-of-Fame member Willie Mays. His best year statistically was 1969, when he hit 45 home runs, had 126 RBI and batted .320 to become the National League MVP. He was also named the Most Valuable Player of the 1969 All-Star Game after hitting two home runs to lead the National League team to a 9-3 victory over the American League. He won NL Player of the Month awards in July 1963 (.310, 13 HR, 27 RBI) and August 1969 (.315, 8 HR, 22 RBI). In 1963 he and Hank Aaron tied for the NL lead with 44 home runs. In the early years of Candlestick Park, the Giants home stadium, the area behind right field was open except for three small bleacher sections. When McCovey came to bat, typically those bleachers would empty as the fans positioned themselves on the flat ground, hoping to catch a McCovey home run ball. San Diego Padres and Oakland Athletics (1974‚Äì1976) Willie McCovey attempts to tag Cincinnati Reds' shortstop Dave Concepci√≥n out at first base in McCovey's last game at Candlestick Park On October 23, 1973, the Giants traded McCovey and Bernie Williams to the San Diego Padres for Mike Caldwell. The Giants had been trading their higher- priced players and gave McCovey input into his destination. McCovey played in 128 games in 1974 and 122 games in 1975. He hit 22 home runs in 1974 and 23 in 1975. In 1976, McCovey struggled, and lost the starting first base job to Mike Ivie. He batted .203 with seven home runs in 71 games. Near the end of the season, the Oakland Athletics purchased his contract from the Padres. He played in eleven games for them. San Francisco (1977‚Äì1980) McCovey returned to the Giants in 1977 without a guaranteed contract, but he earned a position on the team. With Hank Aaron and Frank Robinson having retired at the end of the 1976 season with 755 and 586 home runs respectively, McCovey began 1977 as the active home run leader with 465. That year, during a June 27 game against the Cincinnati Reds, he became the first player to hit two home runs in one inning twice in his career (the first was on April 12, 1973), a feat since accomplished by Andre Dawson, Dale Murphy, Jeff King, Alex Rodriguez, and Edwin Encarnacion. One was a grand slam and he became the first National Leaguer to hit seventeen. At age 39, he had 28 home runs and 86 RBIs and was named the Comeback Player of the Year. On June 30, 1978, at Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, McCovey hit his 500th home run, and two years later, on May 3, 1980, at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, McCovey hit his 521st and last home run, off Scott Sanderson of the Montreal Expos. This home run gave McCovey the distinction, along with Ted Williams (with whom he was tied in home runs), Rickey Henderson, and Omar Vizquel of homering in four different decades: the 1950s, '60s, '70s, and '80s. McCovey is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League baseball games in four decades. In his 22-year career, McCovey batted .270, with 521 home runs and 1,555 RBIs, 1,229 runs scored, 2,211 hits, 353 doubles, 46 triples, 1,345 bases on balls, a .374 on-base percentage and a .515 slugging percentage. He also hit 18 grand slam home runs in his career, a National League record, and was a six-time All-Star. =Post-playing career= McCovey was a senior advisor with the Giants for 18 years. In this role, he visited the team during spring training and during the season, providing advice and other services. In September 2003, McCovey and a business partner opened McCovey's Restaurant, a baseball-themed sports bar and restaurant located in Walnut Creek, California. The restaurant closed in February 2015. =Legacy= McCovey Cove and the arcade at Oracle Park McCovey was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986 in his first year of eligibility ‚Äî making him the 16th player so honored. He appeared on 346 of 425 ballots cast (81.4 percent). McCovey is best remembered for the ferocity of his line drive batting style. In his book Ball Four, pitcher Jim Bouton wrote about watching the slugger blast the ball in batting practice, while making \\"little whimpering animal sounds\\" in response to each of McCovey's raw power drives. Reds manager Sparky Anderson also had a healthy respect for the damage McCovey could do, saying \\"I walked Willie McCovey so many times, he could have walked to the moon on all those walks.\\" McCovey's bat was so lethal in his prime he was intentionally walked an all-time record 45 times in 1969, shattering the previous record by a dozen. This remained the major league mark for 33 years until broken by fellow Giant Barry Bonds. The following year McCovey was intentionally walked 40 times. Once, speaking to the pitcher before a McCovey at-bat, Mets inimitable manager Casey Stengel joked, \\"Where do you want to pitch him, upper deck or lower deck?\\" In 1999, McCovey was ranked 56th on the Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Two years later, the sport's most prominent sabermetric analyst, Bill James, ranked him 69th, and the 9th-best first baseman.James, Bill, The New Bill James Historical Abstract, Simon & Schuster Free Press, 2001, pgs. 365, 435 Since 1980, the Giants have awarded the Willie Mac Award to honor his spirit and leadership. The inlet of San Francisco Bay beyond the right field fence of Oracle Park, historically known as China Basin, has been re-dubbed McCovey Cove in his honor. A statue of McCovey was erected across McCovey Cove from the park, and the land on which it stands named McCovey Point. On September 21, 1980, the Giants retired his uniform number 44, which he wore in honor of Hank Aaron, a fellow Mobile, Alabama native. McCovey was inducted to the Multi-Ethnic Sports Hall of Fame (formerly the Afro Sports Hall of Fame) in Oakland, California on February 7, 2009. The Willie McCovey field at Woodside Elementary School in Woodside, California was rededicated to him in 2013. Personal life McCovey's first marriage was to Karen McCovey, which produced a daughter. On August 1, 2018, he married longtime girlfriend Estela Bejar at AT&T; Park. In 1996, McCovey and fellow baseball Hall of Famer Duke Snider pled guilty to federal tax fraud charges that they had failed to report about $10,000 in income from sports card shows and memorabilia sales from 1988 to 1990. McCovey was given two years of probation and fined $5,000. He received a pardon from President Barack Obama on January 17, 2017. In his later years, McCovey dealt with several health issues, including atrial fibrillation and an infection in 2015 that nearly killed him. After his career ended he endured several knee surgeries, which left him in a wheelchair, and he was hospitalized several times. McCovey died at the age of 80 at Stanford University Medical Center on October 31, 2018 after battling \\"ongoing health issues\\". He had been hospitalized for an infection late the previous week. His longtime friend and fellow Hall-of-Famer Joe Morgan was at his bedside. A public memorial service for McCovey was held at AT&T; Park on November 8, 2018.

Formed in December 1914, it saw service throughout the First World War, including at the Somme and Passchendaele. During the Second World War, No. IX (B) Squadron was one of two Avro Lancaster units specialising in heavy precision bombing (the other was No. 617 Squadron) and sank the battleship Tirpitz on 12 November 1944 in Operation Catechism. Between 1962 and April 1982, the Squadron flew the Avro Vulcan B.2 as part of the V-Force. In June 1982, it became the first front-line squadron in the world to operate the Panavia Tornado GR.1. In May 1998, No. IX (B) Squadron received the RAF's first Tornado GR.4, which it operated until reequipping with the Eurofighter Typhoon FGR.4 at its present home base of RAF Lossiemouth on 1 April 2019. History =First World War= A Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8, similar to what No. 9 Squadron operated between 1917 and 1918. No. 9 Squadron was formed on 8 December 1914 at Saint-Omer in France, the first outside of the UK, from a detachment of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) HQ Wireless Flight. Known as No. 9 (Wireless) Squadron, it was tasked with developing the use of radio for reconnaissance missions through artillery spotting. This lasted until 22 March 1915 when the squadron was disbanded and had its equipment dispersed amongst Nos. II, V, 6 and 16 Squadron.. The Squadron reformed at Brooklands on 1 April 1915 under the command of Major Hugh Dowding (later commander of RAF Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain) as a radio-training squadron, flying the Farman MF.7, Bl√©riot XI and Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s. The Bats moved to Dover on 23 July, re-equipping with the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.8a, Avro 504 and a single Martinsyde S.1, before returning to Saint-Omer on 12 December as an army co-operation squadron. Moving to Bertangles on 24 December, No. 9 Squadron commenced bombing missions on 17 January 1916 with the B.E.2c. It flew reconnaissance and artillery spotting missions during the Battle of the Somme in 1916, assisting XIII Corps on the first day. It later operated during the Second Battle of Arras in 1917. It re-equipped with Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8s in May 1917, using them for artillery spotting and contact patrols during the Battle of Passchendaele, during which it suffered 57 casualties, and carrying out short range tactical bombing operations in response to the German Spring Offensive in March 1918. While it started to receive Bristol Fighters in July 1918, it did not completely discard its R.E.8s until after the end of the war. No. 9 Squadron returned to the UK in August 1919, arriving at Castle Bromwich where it remained until disbanding on 31 December 1919. =Between the wars= The Squadron's life as a bomber unit began on 1 April 1924, reforming at RAF Upavon, quickly moving to RAF Manston, with the Vickers Vimy. Less than a year later, the Squadron re-equipped with the Vickers Virginia heavy bomber, occasionally supplemented by Vickers Victoria transports, which it retained until this was replaced by the Handley Page Heyford in 1936. The squadron badge was approved by King Edward VIII in 1936, one of the few to be introduced during his short reign. The badge reflects the Squadron's development as a specialized night-operations unit, and is a gentle leg-pull in the direction of Air Marshal Hugh \\"Boom\\" Trenchard, widely credited as the founder of the RAF as an independent military force, who once famously remarked \\"Only bats and bloody fools fly at night!\\" The squadron emblem is accordingly a bat, with the motto \\"We Fly by Night\\". On 31 January 1939, No. IX Squadron became the third RAF squadron to receive the modern Vickers Wellington monoplane, when their first Wellington arrived at RAF Stradishall ‚Äì reaching full strength by April. =Second World War= 1939‚Äì1943 Vickers Wellington Mk.Is of No. 9 Squadron, on a mission in WW2, flying in formation. The Second World War began with the unit one of the few equipped with modern aircraft, the Vickers Wellington bomber, flying out of RAF Honington; the Wellington later gave way to the Avro Lancaster in September 1942 upon the Squadron's move to RAF Waddington, with which the unit would complete its most famous sorties. On 4 September 1939, the Squadron‚Äôs Wellington aircraft and crews were the first to hit the enemy, the first to get into a dogfight, possibly the first to shoot down an enemy aircraft, the first to be shot down by one and, towards the end of the war, the first to hit the German battleship Tirpitz with the Tallboy 12,000-pound bomb, an achievement by the crew of an Avro Lancaster on her 102nd operation with the Squadron. Avro Lancaster B.3, ED831 'WS-H', of No. 9 Squadron taking off from RAF Bardney, Lincolnshire, for a raid on the Zeppelin works at Friedrichshafen in Germany. No. IX Squadron fought with RAF Bomber Command in Europe all the way through the Second World War, took part in all the major raids and big battles, pioneered and proved new tactics and equipment, produced several of the leading figures in The Great Escape, such as Les 'Cookie' Long, as well as Colditz inmates ‚Äì including the legendary 'Medium Sized Man' Flight Lieutenant Dominic Bruce OBE MC AFM originator of the famous 'tea chest' escape. They became one of the two specialised squadrons attacking precision targets with the Tallboy bomb, and led the final main force raid, on Berchtesgaden, 25 April 1945. The sinking of Tirpitz (1944) leftThe battleship had been moved into a fjord in Northern Norway where she threatened the Arctic convoys and was too far north to be attacked by air from the UK. She had already been damaged by a Royal Navy midget submarine attack and a second attack from carrier born aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm. But both attacks had failed to sink her. The task was given to No. 9 and No. 617 Squadrons who, operating from a base in Russia, attacked Tirpitz with Tallboy bombs which damaged her so extensively that she was sent to Troms√∏ to be used as a floating battery. This fjord was in range of bombers operating from Scotland. There in October from a base in Scotland she was attacked again. Finally on 12 November 1944, the two squadrons attacked Tirpitz. The first bombs missed their target, but following aircraft scored three direct hits in quick succession causing the ship to capsize. All three RAF attacks on Tirpitz were led by Wing Commander J. B. \\"Willy\\" Tait, who had succeeded Cheshire as CO of No. 617 Squadron in July 1944. Both squadrons claim that it was their bombs that actually sank Tirpitz, however it was the Tallboy bomb dropped from a No. 9 Sqn Lancaster WS-Y (LM220) piloted by Flying Officer Dougie Tweddle to which the sinking of the warship is attributed. F/O Tweddle was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for his part in the operations against Tirpitz. F/O Tweddle's DFC citation reads as follows, \\"This officer has taken part in all three attacks on the battleship 'Tirpitz'. He has shown great determination and the keenest enthusiasm to operate and bomb his target in spite of all the hazards of enemy opposition and bad weather. In the first attack he made the long and arduous journey to the Russian base, and in the actual attack made every effort to bomb the target, despite cloud and smoke-screen. In the second attack he made the same endeavours to bomb the ship, and on the third occasion, unhampered by weather, launched his attack successfully. F/O Tweddle has always displayed courage and cheerful enthusiasm which has been of utmost value to his crew, whilst his captaincy and airmanship have consistently been of the highest order. In addition, F/O Tweddle undertook the extra hazard of wind finding for the Squadron, a task he accomplished most successfully, thereby contributing to the success of the operations even further.\\" Tirpitz Bulkhead Due to the sinking of Tirpitz having been attributed to No. IX (B) Squadron, an intense rivalry developed between No. 617 (a.k.a. the Junior Squadron) and No. IX (B) Squadron after the sinking of the warship. The Tirpitz Bulkhead that was presented to Bomber Command by the Royal Norwegian Air Force, in commemoration of friendship and co-operation during World War II was of particular interest with both squadrons \\"owning\\" the bulkhead at various times until 2002 when the bulkhead was presented to the Bomber Command Museum. 1945 On 25 April 1945, No. IX Squadron flew their last operational mission of the war when they, along with No. 617 Squadron, attacked Obersalzberg ‚Äì targeting the Berghof, Eagle's Nest (residences of Adolf Hitler) and the local SS barracks. 17 Lancasters of No. IX Squadron participated, with 11 bombing the primary target and one bombing a local bridge. With the end of the war in Europe, No. IX Squadron was assigned to the 'Tiger Force', which was composed of multiple Bomber Command squadrons, with the intention of striking the Japanese Empire. However, due to the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 the war was brought to an end before this could be carried out, although No. IX Squadron was deployed to India to carry out aerial survey work until April 1946. =Post‚ÄìWar= Avro Vulcan B.2 XJ784 at Offutt AFB, 1976. After the War, the Lancasters were replaced by Avro Lincolns until 1952, when the Squadron re-equipped with English Electric Canberra B.2 jet-bombers. These aircraft were used during three months of operations in Malaya in 1956 and during the Suez Crisis. No. IX (Bomber) Squadron was disbanded on 13 July 1961. Reforming on 1 March 1962 at RAF Coningsby, No. IX (B) Squadron converted to the Avro Vulcan B.2 and became part of the V-Force of RAF Bomber Command. Their Vulcans were equipped in late 1966 with WE.177 laydown nuclear bombs at RAF Cottesmore in the low- level penetration role and assigned to SACEUR, before spending six years in the same role 1969-74 at RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, as part of the Near East Air Force Wing (NEAF) where the squadron formed part of the United Kingdom's commitment to CENTO. The years 1975-82 were spent based at RAF Waddington, again assigned to SACEUR, and still equipped with WE.177 nuclear laydown bombs in the low-level penetration role before disbanding in April 1982. =Tornado GR (1982‚Äì2019)= 1982‚Äì1990 (Honington to Br√ºggen) No. IX (B) Squadron began to form at RAF Honington in Suffolk in early 1982 under Wing Commander P. J. Gooding, with the Squadron receiving its first Panavia Tornado GR.1 ZA586 on 6 January. The first IX (B) Squadron Tornado GR.1 sortie was made from RAF Honington on 6 April. The Squadron was officially reformed on 1 June thus becoming the world's first operational Tornado squadron. No. 9 Squadron was again equipped with WE.177 nuclear laydown bombs, handed down from the Vulcan force. The Squadron was officially declared combat ready to SACUER in January 1983. No. IX (B) Squadron suffered the RAF's first Tornado loss on 27 September 1983, when Tornado GR.1 ZA586 suffered complete electrical failure causing the pilot Sqn. Ldr. M. Stephens to order ejection. The navigator, Flt. Lt. N. Nickles, safely ejected from the aircraft however Sqn. Ldr. M. Stephens failed to eject and was lost in the crash. During their time at RAF Honington, the Squadron featured in the 1985 RAF recruitment film Tornado, produced by the Central Office of Information. The film features a training exercise in which Tornado crews prepare and execute a strike on a coastal surface-to-air missile site. On 1 October 1986, No. IX (B) Squadron moved to RAF Br√ºggen as part of RAF Germany, becoming the fourth Tornado squadron to be based there. 1991‚Äì1998 (Op GRANBY, 1991) No. IX (B) Squadron Panavia Tornado GR.1 ZD810 in Gulf War markings at RAF Alconbury, 1991. In the build up to the First Gulf War in 1990, personnel of No. IX (B) Squadron were deployed to Tabuk Air Base and Dhahran Airfield in Saudi Arabia as well as Muharraq Airfield in Bahrain. As part of Operation Granby, crews from these bases flew their first sorties on 17 January 1991 to gain air superiority over Iraqi airspace. Initial bombing raids were focused on Iraqi air bases with Tornado GR.1s delivering unguided 1000lb bombs and JP233 to knock-out runways. On 20 January, the Squadron lost Tornado GR.1 ZD893 near Tabuk when its control column failed to respond properly shortly after take off. After jettisoning their external stores, the crew attempted two landings to no avail forcing the crew to eject. Over the course of the campaign, No. IX (B) Squadron flew 200 sorties dropping 300 1000lb bombs. The Squadron suffered no loses in combat throughout the conflict, only losing ZD893 outside of combat. In the aftermath of Op GRANBY, no-fly zones were set up over Iraq: Op WARDEN beginning in 1991 in the North and Op JURAL in the South in 1992. No. IX (B) Squadron along with other RAF Br√ºggen-based squadrons, Nos. 14, 17 and 31, each conducted four month long tours of duty as part of Operation Jural. Returning home to RAF Br√ºggen after Operation Granby, No. IX (B) Squadron continued to maintain their nuclear delivery role until 1994. On 11 May 1998, the first Tornado GR.4 was delivered to No. IX (B) Squadron at RAF Br√ºggen. The 1998 Strategic Defence Review decided that in 2001 No. 9 Squadron, along with No. 31 Squadron, would relocate from RAF Br√ºggen to RAF Marham, Norfolk. Panavia Tornado GR.4 ZD748 in 1998. 1999‚Äì2002 (Op ENGADINE, 1999) No. IX (B) Squadron participated in the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia to liberate Kosovo as part of Operation Engadine (called Operation Allied Force by NATO). Initial sorties were flown from RAF Br√ºggen but the Squadron later deployed to Solenzara Air Base, Corsica, along with No. 31 Squadron. In 1999, No. IX (B) Squadron became the first operational Tornado GR.4 squadron. 2003‚Äì2009 (Op TELIC, 2003) Under the command of Wing Commander Derek Watson, the Squadron formed a part of the RAF's contribution to the Second Gulf War (Operation Telic) after being deployed in February 2003. Nos. II (AC), IX (B), XIII, 31 and 617 Squadrons contributed to Tornado GR.4 Wing 1 based at Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait. No. IX (B) Squadron suffered its only loss of the war on 22 March 2003 when one of their aircraft was engaged by a Patriot battery in Kuwait while returning from a mission. The pilot, Flt. Lt. Kevin Barry Main, and navigator, Flt. Lt. David Rhys Williams, were both killed. Immediately after the incident it was claimed that the RAF crew had failed to switch on their IFF beacon. However a US journalist embedded with the U.S. Army unit operating the Patriot battery said the \\"army Patriots were mistakenly identifying friendly aircraft as enemy tactical ballistic missiles.\\" While all Tornado GR.4s were capable of carrying the ALARM anti- radiation missile, Nos. IX (B) and 31 Squadrons specialised in the role, in which they were known as \\"Pathfinder\\" squadrons. From 2004 to 2010, No. 9 Squadron annually deployed in support of Op TELIC. No. IX (B) Squadron Panavia Tornado GR.4 ZA469 at RIAT in 2007. (This aircraft is today preserved at IWM Duxford). 2010 (Op HERRICK, 2010) No. IX (B) Squadron saw its first tour of duty on Operation Herrick at Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan in early January 2010, taking over from No. 31 Squadron. The Squadron's Tornado GR.4s flew both close air support (CAS) missions for ground forces as well as flying multiple reconnaissance missions using the RAPTOR (Reconnaissance Airborne Pod for Tornado) and LITENING III pod. No. IX (B) Squadron handed over their duties to No. II (AC) Squadron on 13 April after a three month deployment. In that time the Squadron launched 450 times, amassed nearly 1,600 flying hours and undertook almost 40 CAS missions. The penultimate leg of the Squadron's journey home was completed aboard HMS Albion from Santander due to air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallaj√∂kull eruption. 2011 (Op ELLAMY, 2011) In March 2011, No. IX(B) Squadron was the first RAF Tornado squadron to participate in Operation Ellamy. The Squadron performed the second-longest ranged attack sorties in the history of the RAF and the first to be launched from the UK mainland since the Second World War, launching Storm Shadow strikes from the Squadron's home base at RAF Marham and hitting targets deep inside Libya. The Squadron then deployed forward to continue operations from Gioia del Colle in Southern Italy. After a brief respite from the action, during which it was relieved by No. II (AC) Squadron, No. IX (B) Squadron was selected to return to Gioia del Colle. Aircrew of No. IX (B) Squadron were inside Libyan airspace on 20 October 2011 when the conflict came to an end with the capture of Colonel Gaddafi by NTC fighters. The Squadron returned home on 1 November 2011 after participating in one of the most successful NATO operations ever conducted (Operation Unified Protector). Nos. IX (B), II (AC) and 47 Squadrons were the only RAF squadrons awarded the right to emblazon the battle honour Libya 2011 on their squadron standards. No. IX (B) Squadron Panavia Tornado GR.4 ZA456 in a special scheme celebrating 100 years of No. 9 Squadron, 2015. 2012‚Äì2014 (Op HERRICK, 2012‚Äì14) No. IX (B) Squadron returned to Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan as part of Operation HERRICK in December 2012, taking over from No. II (AC) Squadron. No. IX (B) Squadron were deployed for four months before returning to RAF Marham on 18 March 2013. The squadron participated in Exercise Red Flag 14-1 at Nellis Air Force Base, U.S.A., between 27 January to 14 February 2014, operating alongside and against the United States Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and the Royal Australian Air Force. No. IX (B) Squadron's last deployment to Afghanistan was in June 2014 when they again took over from No. II (AC) Squadron before being replaced by No. 31 Squadron in September ‚Äì the last RAF Tornados to be deployed. To celebrate 100 years of No. IX (B) Squadron, Tornado GR.4 ZA356 was painted in a special commemorative scheme to mark the occasion. 2014‚Äì2019 (Op SHADER, 2014‚Äì19) No. IX (B) Squadron Tornado GR.4 ZG775 in a special scheme to mark the retirement of the Tornado, 2019. After an emergency meeting at the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms on 11 August 2014, it was decided to deploy RAF Tornado GR.4s from RAF Marham to RAF Akrotiri to help support aid efforts to refugees in the Iraqi Sinjar Mountains who were under attack by Daesh. On 26 September, Parliament voted in favour of airstrikes against IS, with the first strikes occurring on the 30 September. No. IX(B) Squadron contributed to the 1,300 missions conducted by RAF Tornado GR.4s and General Atomics MQ-9 Reapers during the first year of action against Daesh. On 8 December 2014, squadron members both past and present held a service at Saint-Omer to mark 100 years since No. 9 Squadron was first formed. After Parliament approved strikes in Syria on 2 December 2015, No. IX (B) Squadron Tornado GR.4s carried attacks the same day on Daesh owned oil fields in al-Omar, Syria. On 14 April 2018, No. IX (B) Squadron aircrew participated in the missile strikes against Syria in response to the Syrian government's suspected chemical attack in Douma. On 10 July 2018, nine Tornado GR.4s of No. IX (B) Squadron and No. 31 Squadron participated in a flypast over London to celebrate the Royal Air Force's 100th anniversary. On 6 November 2018, the RAF unveiled Tornado GR.4 ZG775 in a special commemorative No. IX (B) Squadron scheme to celebrate the Squadron's 37 years of Tornado operations, the first of three Tornado retirement schemes to be made public. On 4 and 5 February 2019, the eight Tornado GR.4s of No. IX (B) Squadron and No. 31 Squadron that had been deployed to RAF Akrotiri returned home to RAF Marham ahead of the Tornado's retirement on 31 March 2019. Nos. IX (B) and 31 Squadrons held a joint parade at RAF Marham on 14 March 2019 to mark the impending disbandment of the Tornado GR Force. Although the parade flypast was Tornado's last planned sortie in RAF service, both squadrons maintained readiness for operations until the type's out-of-service date of 31 March 2019. The two squadron commanders simultaneously lowered their pennants at 0931hrs GMT on the following day, making No. IX(B) the world's first and the RAF's joint-last operational Tornado squadron. =Eurofighter Typhoon (2019 onwards)= No. IX (B) Squadron Eurofighter Typhoon FGR.4 ZJ913 at RIAT, 2019. Four Typhoon FGR4s (ZJ913, ZJ921, ZJ924 and ZJ935) were assigned to No. IX (B) Squadron (Designate) at RAF Lossiemouth in February 2019, the first appearing in squadron markings on 13 February. No. IX (B) Squadron re-equipped as an aggressor and air defence squadron operating Eurofighter Typhoon Tranche 1 at 0931hrs GMT on 1 April 2019, thereby continuing in unbroken service upon Tornado's retirement. The squadron marked its change of aircraft, role and location with a further parade on 2 May 2019 where it formally stood-up, having been operational since 1 April. On 24 March 2020, No. IX (B) Squadron were awarded the battle honour 'Afghanistan 2001‚Äì2014' (without the right to emblazon) by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II due to their participation in Operation Herrick.

The species is native to the eastern and southeastern regions of Asia. It is a long, thin, semi-arboreal species of snake with several recognized subspecies. This constrictor feeds on rodents, and though it is favored in some locations as a natural pest control or pet, it is also considered an invasive species in other locations. Description Living about 15‚Äì25 years, the average length of the beauty rat snake (including the tail) is about , with an unofficial record of a little less than 9.2 feet (2.8 meters) property of Simona and Janey, 2 girls from Den Haag (Netherland). The snake is called Obi One Kenobi. =Coloration= Generally speaking, the ground color is yellowish-brown to olive which becomes darker at the end of the tail. The skin on the back of the neck and head are uniform in color and the back is marked typically with two pairs of round black spots that meld together. Starting at the back corner of eacheye, a black stripe reaches back to each corner of the mouth which is pale cream around the upper labial area. Subspecies and distribution =Subspecies= Subspecies of this species include: *Chinese beauty snake (Elaphe taeniura taeniura) - Native to China. This subspecies has 11 different morphs. *Ridley's beauty snake, cave dwelling ratsnake, cave racer (Elaphe taeniura ridleyi) - Native to Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia. Bred in captivity in Cameron Highlands. Is listed as Vulnerable on the China Species Red List. (As the name implies, often lives deep within caves where its diet consists mainly of bats. They have a yellow to beige background color that darkens to a grey-black towards the tail. A white to cream mid-dorsal stripe starts about half of the way down the body and continues to the tip of tail. Both sides of the head are marked just behind the eye with a black stripe surrounded by blue.) *Mocquard's beauty rat snake (Elaphe taeniura mocquardi) - Native to southeastern China and northern Vietnam, as well as the island of Hainan. *Taiwan/Taiwanese beauty snake, stripe tail ratsnake (Elaphe taeniura friesei, previously Elaphe taeniura friesi) \\\\- Native to Taiwan. *Vietnamese blue beauty/blue beauty snake (Elaphe taeniura callicyanous) - Native to Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand. *Helfenberger's beauty snake (Elaphe taeniura helfenbergeri) - Native to Myanmar and Thailand. *Elaphe taeniura grabowskyi - Native to Sumatra and the provinces of East Malaysia and Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. *Elaphe taeniura schmackeri - Native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. *Elaphe taeniura yunnanensis - Native to China, India, Laos, Myanmar, eastern Thailand and Vietnam. *Elaphe taeniura ssp. - Native to Burma, Thailand and Vietnam. =Geographic range and habitat= The range of the species covers much of southern and southeastern Asia, excluding western and northeastern China. Within these countries, these snakes can be typically found in the rain forests as well as within caves. Currently, there is no specific information on the beauty rat snake's preferred caves, rain forests and climate available. Ecology =Behavior= Due to their preference for caves, these snakes have become able climbers and are known to move along cave walls. This ability becomes a strong asset for them when it comes to hunting. In addition, likely due to its cave-dwelling habits, beauty rat snakes are cathemeral, meaning that they are active at random times during the 24-hour day regardless of whether it is day or night outside. This species is inherently fast-paced and easily stressed, so all pets should be given ample hiding space and proper temperature to improve adaptation to its new environment and possibly promote temperament. Beauty snakes of all varieties are known to be territorial, so a snake hook or an obstacle between the snakes face and your hand is optimal for removal from their enclosure for handling etc. Feeding Relatively small, the beauty rat snake typically feeds on ground rodents such as mice and, due to the snake's climbing abilities, even bats that are roosting within the caves they share. In addition to small mammals, beauty rat snakes have also been known to eat birds and bird eggs occasionally. Domestic specimens have been observed to relish baby chicks as an alternative to a rodent-based diet. Further information on hunting habits of the beauty rat snake is not currently available. Breeding The beauty rat snake species is oviparous and mating usually results about a month after hibernation period which is during times where the temperature is around . After laying 4-12 eggs, the female will incubate and defend them for about 70 days, only taking occasional breaks to hunt. Recently hatched young range about in length. About 2 weeks later they will begin to shed their first skin. Within the next 14 months, hatchlings grow to be about long and are able to breed another 4 months later. Threats and Predators Though beauty rat snakes are typically in less accessible caves, the top predators of these serpents are birds and mammals. Currently, there is no specific information of the predators of beauty rat snakes available. =Ecosystem services= Due to their diets, the beauty rat snakes (as well as other rodent-eating serpents) provide a form of natural pest control that can be a benefit to people and other species that are affected by rodents. Interaction with humans The beauty rat snake is largely traded in the Chinese snake skin and live snake trade. Overall, the Chinese beauty snake, Taiwan beauty snake and Vietnamese blue beauty snake are the most popular of the subspecies to be kept as pets. Pop culture has also been influenced by the beauty rat snake by having Mozler, the main monster from the 1988 Hong Kong film Thunder of Gigantic Serpent, be of the same species. Though Mozler displays a calm temperament, this is seen mainly in captive bred snakes. Wild caught snakes can have difficult dispositions despite being kept as pets for several years. =As an invasive species= Though the overall species is native to Asia, certain subspecies have become invasive in regions of Asia to which they are not local. The cause of their invasion varies but one of the leading causes is individuals that have been transported by the pet trade and escaping or being released by owners. Another reason has been military movement of resources which has created routes along which serpents can move. On the island of Okinawa one subspecies of beauty rat snake, suspected to be the Taiwanese beauty snake, has been established as an invasive species since the late 1970s. The Taiwanese beauty snake was originally brought onto the islands to be displayed at zoos as well as for medicinal purposes but now has spread through forests and urban locations. According to the article Invasive Species of Japan, the \\"spread of [the Taiwanese Beauty Snake] to northern part of Okinawa Island could threaten endemic and endangered birds and mammals, such as Gallirallus okinawae, Erithacus komadori namiyei, Diplothrix legata, Tokudaia muenninki, etc.\\" As of yet, there is no further published information on the exact impact of the Taiwanese beauty snake's invasion into Okinawa. =Control strategies =  Policies and laws  Currently, according to the Invasive Alien Species (IAS) Act, it is illegal in Japan to own, transport or bring any Taiwanese beauty snake into the country. The IAS Act also maintains a list differentiating between Invasive Alien Species (IAS) Uncategorized Alien Species (UAS) and Living Organisms Required to have a Certificate Attached (LORCA) while they are brought into the country. The Taiwanese beauty snake is the only subspecies of beauty rat snake labeled as an IAS. The subspecies Orthiophis taeniurus schmackeri is the only one listed as an exemption of the UAS category but all subspecies (exempting the prohibited Taiwanese beauty snake) classify as LORCAs.

Rakovsky's political career took him throughout the Balkans and into France and Imperial Russia; for part of his life, he was also a Romanian citizen. A lifelong collaborator of Leon Trotsky, he was a prominent activist of the Second International, involved in politics with the Bulgarian Workers' Social Democratic Party, Romanian Social Democratic Party, and the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. Rakovsky was expelled at different times from various countries as a result of his activities, and, during World War I, became a founding member of the Revolutionary Balkan Social Democratic Labor Federation while helping to organize the Zimmerwald Conference. Imprisoned by Romanian authorities, he made his way to Russia, where he joined the Bolshevik Party after the October Revolution, and, as head of the Rumcherod, unsuccessfully attempted to generate a communist revolution in the Kingdom of Romania. Subsequently, he was a founding member of the Comintern, served as head of government in the Ukrainian SSR, and took part in negotiations at the Genoa Conference. He came to oppose Joseph Stalin and rallied with the Left Opposition, being marginalized inside the government and sent as Soviet ambassador to London and Paris, where he was involved in renegotiating financial settlements. He was ultimately recalled from France in autumn 1927, after signing his name to a controversial Trotskyist platform which endorsed world revolution. Credited with having developed the Trotskyist critique of Stalinism as \\"bureaucratic centrism\\", Rakovsky was subject to internal exile. Submitting to Stalin's leadership in 1934 and being briefly reinstated, he was nonetheless implicated in the Trial of the Twenty One (part of the Moscow Trials), imprisoned, and executed by the NKVD during World War II. He was rehabilitated in 1988, during the Soviet Glasnost period. Names Rakovsky's original Bulgarian name was Krastyo Georgiev Stanchev (–ö—Ä—ä—Å—Ç—å–æ –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–µ–≤ –°—Ç–∞–Ω—á–µ–≤), which he himself changed to Krastyo Rakovski (–ö—Ä—ä—Å—Ç—å–æ –†–∞–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏), being a descendant of the Bulgarian national hero Georgi Rakovski. The usual form his first name took in Romanian was Cristian (occasionally rendered as Christian), while his last name was spelled Racovski, Racovschi, or Rakovski. His given name was occasionally rendered as Ristache, an antiquated hypocoristic‚Äîhe was known as such to his acquaintance, the writer Ion Luca Caragiale.Cioculescu, p.28, 46, 246‚Äì248 In Russian, his full name, including patronymic, was Khristian Georgievich Rakovsky (–•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∞–Ω –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–µ–≤–∏—á –†–∞–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π). Christian (as well as Cristian and Kristian) is an approximate rendition of Krastyo (the Bulgarian for \\"cross\\"), as used by Rakovsky himself.Fagan, Socialist leader in the Balkans In Ukrainian, Rakovsky's name is rendered as –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏—è–Ω –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥—ñ–π–æ–≤–∏—á –†–∞–∫–æ–≤—Å—å–∫–∏–π, and usually transliterated as Khrystyian Heorhiiovych Rakovskyi. During his lifetime, he was also known under the pseudonyms H. Insarov and Grigoriev, which he used in signing several articles for the Russian-language press.Fagan, Socialist leader in the Balkans; Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\"; Trotsky, Christian Rakovsky et Basile Kolarov Biography =Revolutionary beginnings= Christian Rakovsky was born to a wealthy Bulgarian family in Gradets‚Äînear Kotel‚Äîat the time still part of Ottoman-ruled Rumelia.Fagan, Socialist leader in the Balkans; Rakovsky (\\"An Autobiography\\") stated that his birthplace was Kotel He was, on his mother's side, the nephew of Georgi Sava Rakovski, a revolutionary hero of the Bulgarian National Revival;Fagan, Socialist leader in the Balkans; Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\"; Upson Clark that side of his family also included Georgi Mamarchev, who had fought against the Ottomans in the Imperial Russian Army.Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\" Rakovsky's father was a merchant who belonged to the Democratic Party. He later stated that, as early as his childhood years, he had felt a special admiration towards Russia, and that he had been impressed by witnessing, at age 5, the Russo-Turkish War and Russian presence (he claimed to have met General Eduard Totleben during the conflict). Although his parents moved to the Kingdom of Romania in 1880, settling in Gherengic (Northern Dobruja), he completed his education in newly emancipated Bulgaria.Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\"; Upson Clark Rakovsky was expelled from the gymnasium in Gabrovo for his political activities (in 1887 and then again, after organizing a riot, in 1890). It was around that time that he became a Marxist, and began collaborating with the socialist journalist Evtim Dabev, whom he aided in printing works by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels (at the time, Rakovsky and Sava Balabanov also published their own newspaper, the clandestine Zerkalo).Fagan, Socialist leader in the Balkans; Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\" Since, after having ultimately been banned from attending any public school in the country, he could not complete his education in Bulgaria,Fagan, Socialist leader in the Balkans; Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\"; TƒÉnase, \\"Cristian Racovski\\" in September 1890 Rakovsky went to Geneva to begin his studies and become a physician. While in Switzerland, he joined the Socialist Student Circle at the University of Geneva, which was largely composed of non-Swiss youth. A polyglot,Anghel & Iosif, p.257; Fagan, Socialist leader in the Balkans Rakovsky became close to Georgy Plekhanov, the founder of Russian Marxism, and his circle, eventually writing a number of articles and a book in Russian. He also briefly worked with Rosa Luxemburg, Pavel Axelrod and Vera Zasulich. Unable to attend the First International Congress of Socialist Students in Brussels (1892), he became involved in organizing the Second Congress, held in Geneva during the fall of 1893. He was a founding editor of the Geneva-based Bulgarian-language magazine Sotsial-Demokrat and later a major contributor to the Bulgarian Marxist publications Den', Rabotnik, and Drugar. At the time, Rakovsky and Balabanov, with Plekhanov's encouragement, stressed the importance for moderation in socialist policies‚ÄîSotsial-Demokrat rallied with the Bulgarian Social Democratic Union and rejected the more radical Bulgarian Socialdemocratic Party. He soon became involved in distributing socialist propaganda inside Bulgaria, at a time when Stefan Stambolov organized a crackdown on political opposition. Later in 1893, Rakovsky enrolled in a medical school in Berlin, contributing articles for Vorw√§rts and becoming close to Wilhelm Liebknecht (the two corresponded regularly for the rest of Liebknecht's life). As a Bulgarian delegate to the Second International Congress in Z√ºrich, he also met with Engels and Jules Guesde. Six months later, he was arrested and expelled from the German Empire for maintaining close contacts with the Russian revolutionaries there. He finished his education in 1894‚Äì1896 in Z√ºrich, Nancy and Montpellier, where he wrote for La Jeunesse Socialiste and La Petite R√©publique, maintaining a friendship with Guesde and becoming an opponent of Jean Jaur√®s' reformist views.Fagan, Socialist leader in the Balkans; Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\"; Les socialistes et la guerre According to his own testimony, he became active in supporting the Anti-Ottoman upsurge in Crete and Macedonia, as well as Dashnak revolutionary activities. In 1896, he was the Bulgarian representative to the Second International's London Congress (part of his speech was published in Karl Kautsky's Die Neue Zeit). =Military service and first stay in Russia= Although actively involved in many European countries' socialist movements, prior to 1917 Rakovsky's focus remained on the Balkans and especially on his native country and Romania; his activities in support of the international socialist movement led to his expulsion, at different times, from Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, France and Russia. In 1897 he published Russiya na Istok (Russia in the East), a book sharply critical of the Russian Empire's foreign policy, which, according to Rakovsky, followed one of Georgy Plekhanov's guidelines (\\"Tsarist Russia must be isolated in its foreign relations\\"). On several occasions, he publicly criticized Russia's policies towards Romania and in BessarabiaFagan, Socialist leader in the Balkans; FrunzƒÉ, p.92; Upson Clark (describing Russia's rule over the latter as \\"absolutist conquest\\", \\"mischievous action\\", and \\"abduction\\").Rakovsky, in FrunzƒÉ, p.92 According to Rakovsky, \\"Russophile papers\\" in Bulgaria had begun to target him as a consequence.

P. Ryabova, was summoned to Romania in order to be drafted in the Romanian Army, and served as a medic in the 9th Cavalry Regiment stationed in Constan≈£a, Dobruja (1899‚Äì1900). He rose to the rank of lieutenant.Upson Clark Rakovsky subsequently rejoined his wife in Saint Petersburg, where he hoped to settle down and engage in revolutionary activities (he was probably expelled after an initial attempt to enter the country, but was allowed to return). An adversary of Peter Berngardovich Struve after the latter moved towards market liberalism, he became acquainted with, among others, Nikolay Mikhaylovsky and Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky, while authoring articles for Nashe Slovo and helping distribute Iskra. His close relationship with Plekhanov led Rakovsky to a position between the Menshevik and Bolshevik factions of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, one he kept from 1903 to 1917; the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin was initially hostile to Rakovsky, and at one point wrote to Karl Radek that \\"we [the Bolsheviks] do not have the same road as his kind of people\\".Lenin, in TƒÉnase, \\"Cristian Racovski\\" Initially, Rakovsky was expelled from Russia and had to move back to Paris. Returning to the Russian capital in 1900, he remained there until 1902, when his wife's death and the crackdown on socialist groups ordered by Emperor Nicholas II forced him to return to France. Working for a while as a physician in the village of Beaulieu, Haute-Loire, he asked French officials to review his case for naturalization, but was refused. In 1903, following the death of his father, Rakovsky again lived in Paris, where he followed developments of the Russo-Japanese War and spoke out against Russia, attracting, according to Rakovsky himself, the criticism of both Plekhanov and Jules Guesde. He voiced his opposition to the concession made by Karl Kautsky to Jean Jaur√®s, one which had allowed socialists to join \\"bourgeois\\" governments in times of crisis.Rakovsky, Les socialistes et la guerre =Rom√¢nia Muncitoare= Front page of Jos Despotizmul!..

He was usually present in Bucharest on a weekly basis, and started an intense activity as a journalist, doctor and lawyer. The Balkans correspondent for L'Humanit√©, he was also personally responsible for reviving Rom√¢nia Muncitoare, the defunct journal of the Romanian socialist group, provoking successful strike actions which brought him to the attention of officials.110 ani de social-democra≈£ie, p.13; Fagan, Socialist leader in the Balkans; Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\"; Upson Clark Christian Rakovsky also traveled to Bulgaria, where he eventually sided with the Tesnyatsi in their conflict with other socialist groups.Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\"; Trotsky, Christian Rakovsky et Basile Kolarov In 1904, he was present at the Second International's Congress in Amsterdam, where he gave a speech celebrating the assassination of Russian police chief Vyacheslav von Plehve by Socialist-Revolutionary Party members. Rakovsky became noted locally especially after 1905, when he organized rallies in support of the Battleship Potemkin revolt (the events worsened relations between Russia and the Romanian Kingdom),Anghel & Iosif, p.257; TismƒÉneanu, p.42 carried out a relief operation for the Potemkin crew as their ship sought refuge in Constan≈£a, and attempted to determine them to set sail for Batumi and aid striking workers there. According to his own account, a parallel scandal occurred when an armed Bolshevik ship was captured in Romanian territorial waters; Rakovsky, who indicated that the weapons on board were to be used in Batumi, faced allegations in the Romanian press that he was preparing a Dobrujan insurrection. His head was injured during street clashes with police forces over the Potemkin issue;Anghel & Iosif, p.257 while recovering, Rakovsky befriended the Romanian poets ≈ûtefan Octavian Iosif and Dimitrie Anghel, who were publishing works under a common signature‚Äîone of the two authored a sympathetic portrait of the socialist leader, based on his recollections from the early 1900s.Anghel & Iosif, passim Throughout these years, Rakovsky, was, according to Iosif and Anghel, \\"continuously bustling; disappearing and appearing in workers' centers, be it in BrƒÉila, be it in Gala≈£i, be it in Ia≈üi, be it anywhere, always preaching with the same undaunted fervor and fanatical conviction his social credo\\".Anghel & Iosif, p.258 Rakovsky was drawn into a polemic with the Romanian authorities, facing public accusations that, as a Bulgarian, he lacked patriotism; in return, he commented that, if patriotism meant \\"race prejudice, international and civil war, political tyranny and plutocratic domination\\", he refused to be identified with it.Rakovsky, in Fagan, Socialist leader in the Balkans; in Upson Clark Upon the outbreak of Romanian Peasants' Revolt of 1907, Rakovsky was especially vocal: he launched accusations at the National Liberal government, arguing that, having profited from the early antisemitic message of the revolt, it had violently repressed it from the moment peasants began to attack landowners. Supportive of the thesis according to which the peasantry had revolutionary importance inside Romanian society and Eastern Europe at large, Rakovsky publicized his perspective in the socialist press (writing articles on the subject for Rom√¢nia Muncitoare, L'Humanit√©, Avanti!, Vorw√§rts and others). Rakovsky was also one of the journalists suspected of having greatly exaggerated the overall death toll in their accounts: his estimates speak of over 10,000 peasants killed, whereas the government data counted only 421. Ion Bulei, \\"421, nu 11.000\\", in Ziarul Financiar, February 2, 2007 He became close to the influential dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale, who was living in Berlin at the time. Caragiale authored his own virulent critique of the Romanian state and its handling of the revolt, an essay titled 1907, din primƒÉvarƒÉ p√¢nƒÉ √Æn toamnƒÉ (\\"1907, From Spring to Autumn\\"), which, in its final version, adopted some of Rakovsky's suggestions.Cioculescu, p.28, 46 =1907 expulsion= After repeatedly condemning repression of the revolt, Rakovsky was, together with other socialists, officially accused of having agitated rebellious sentiment, and consequently expelled from Romanian soil (late 1907).110 ani de social- democra≈£ie, p.14; Anghel & Iosif, p.256; Cioculescu, p.146-247; Fagan, Socialist leader in the Balkans; Ornea, p.514; Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\"; TƒÉnase, \\"Cristian Racovski\\"; Upson Clark He received news of this action while already abroad, in Stuttgart (at the Seventh Congress of the Second International).Fagan, Socialist leader in the Balkans; Ornea, p.514 He decided not to recognize it, and contended that his father had settled in Northern Dobruja before the Treaty of Berlin that had awarded the region to Romania; the plea was rejected by the Court of Appeal, based on evidence that Rakovsky's father was not in Dobruja before 1880, and that Rakovsky himself used a Bulgarian passport when moving across borders. During the 1920s, Rakovsky was still viewing the incident as a \\"blatantly illegal act\\". The action itself caused protests from leftist politicians and sympathizers,Anghel & Iosif, p.256; Cioculescu, p.247 including, among others, the influential Marxist thinker Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea (whose appeal in favor of Rakovsky was described by Iosif and Anghel as evidence of \\"an almost parental love\\").Anghel & Iosif, p.256 The local socialists organized several rallies in his support, and the return of his citizenship was also backed by Take Ionescu's opposition group, the Conservative-Democratic Party.Ornea, p.514 In exile, Rakovsky authored the pamphlet Les pers√©cutions politiques en Roumanie (\\"Political Persecutions in Romania\\") and two books (La Roumanie des boyars ‚Äì \\"Boyar Romania\\", and the since-lost From the Kingdom of Arbitrariness and Cowardice). Eventually, he traveled back into Romania in October 1909, only to be arrested upon his transit through BrƒÉila County.Editor's note in Anghel & Iosif, p.256; Cioculescu, p.247; Ornea, p.514; Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\" According to his recollections, he was for long left stranded on the border with Austria-Hungary, as officials in the latter country refused to let him pass; the situation had to be settled by negotiations between the two countries. Also according to Rakovsky, the arrest was hidden by the Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu cabinet until it leaked to the press‚Äîthis, coupled with rumors that he was about to be killed, and BrƒÉtianu's statement that he would \\"rather destroy [Rakovsky] than let [him] back into Rumania\\",BrƒÉtianu, in Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\" caused a series of important street clashes between his supporters and government forces. On December 9, 1909, a Romanian Railways employee named Stoenescu attempted to assassinate BrƒÉtianu.Ornea, p.521-522; Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\" The event, which was attributed by Rakovsky to support for his return and by other sources to government manipulation,Ornea, p.521-522 caused a clampdown on Rom√¢nia Muncitoare (among those socialists arrested and interrogated were Gheorghe Cristescu, I. C. Frimu, and Dumitru Marinescu). Rakovsky secretly returned to Romania in 1911, giving himself up in Bucharest. According to Rakovsky, he was again expelled, holding a Romanian passport, to Istanbul, where he was swiftly arrested by the Young Turks government but released soon after. He subsequently left for Sofia, where he established the Bulgarian socialist journal Napred. Ultimately, the new Petre P. Carp Conservative cabinet agreed to allow his return to Romania, following pressures from the French Premier Georges Clemenceau (who answered an appeal by Jean Jaur√®s). According to Rakovsky, this was also determined by the Conservative change in policies towards the peasantry. He unsuccessfully ran for Parliament during the elections of that year (and several others in succession), being fully reinstated as a citizen in April 1912. Romanian journalist Stelian TƒÉnase contends that the expulsion had instilled resentment in Rakovsky;TƒÉnase, \\"Cristian Racovski\\" earlier, the leading National Liberal politician Ion G. Duca himself had argued that Rakovsky was developing a \\"hatred for Romania\\".Duca, rendered in TƒÉnase, \\"Cristian Racovski\\" =PSDR and Zimmerwald Movement= left Alongside Mihai Gheorghiu Bujor and Frimu, Rakovsky was one of the founders of the Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSDR), serving as its president.110 ani de social-democra≈£ie, p.3 In May 1912, he helped organize a mourning session for the centennial of Russian rule in Bessarabia, and authored numerous new articles on the matter. He was afterwards involved in calling for peace during the Balkan Wars; notably, Rakovsky expressed criticism of Romania's invasion of Bulgaria during the Second Balkan War, and called on Romanian authorities not to annex Southern Dobruja. Alongside Frimu, Bujor, Ecaterina Arbore and others, he lectured at the PSDR's propaganda school during the short period the latter was in existence (in 1910 and again in 1912‚Äì1913).110 ani de social-democra≈£ie, p.14 In 1913, Rakovsky was married a second time, to Alexandrina Alexandrescu (also known as Ileana Pralea), a socialist militant and intellectual, who taught mathematics in Ploie≈üti.BrƒÉtescu, p.425 Alexandrescu was herself a friend of Dobrogeanu-Gherea and an acquaintance of Caragiale.Valeria Stan, Florian TƒÉnƒÉsescu, Marian ≈ûtefan, \\"1871‚Äì1971.

Rallying with the left wing of international social democracy during the early stages of World War I, Rakovsky later indicated that he had been purposely informed of the controversial pro-war stance taken by the Social Democratic Party of Germany by the pro-Entente Romanian Foreign Minister Emanoil Porumbaru.Fagan, Regroupment of the socialist movement With staff of the Menshevik paper Nashe Slovo (edited by Leon Trotsky), he was among the most prominent socialist pacifists of the period.Fagan, Regroupment of the socialist movement; Trotsky, Christian Rakovsky et Basile Kolarov Reflecting his ideological priorities, Rom√¢nia Muncitoare's title was changed into Jos RƒÉsboiul! (\\"Down with war!\\")‚Äîit was later to be known as Lupta ZilnicƒÉ (the \\"Daily combat\\"). Heavily critical of the French Socialist Party's decision to join the Ren√© Viviani cabinet (deeming it \\"an abdication\\"), he stressed the responsibility of all European countries in provoking the war, and adhered to Trotsky's vision of a \\"Peace without indemnities or annexations\\" as an alternative to \\"imperialist war\\". According to Rakovsky, tensions between the French SFIO and the German Social Democrats were reflecting not just context, but major ideological differences.Rakovsky, Les socialistes et la guerre; Trotsky, Christian Rakovsky et Basile Kolarov Present in Italy in March 1915, he attended the Milan Congress of the Italian Socialist Party, during which he attempted to persuade it to condemn irredentist goals.Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\"; TƒÉnase, \\"Cristian Racovski\\" In July, after convening the Bucharest Conference, he and Vasil Kolarov established the Revolutionary Balkan Social Democratic Labor Federation (comprising the left-leaning socialist parties of Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece), and Rakovsky was elected first secretary of its Central Bureau.Fagan, Socialist leader in the Balkans; Regroupment of the socialist movement; Trotsky, Christian Rakovsky et Basile Kolarov; Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\" Subsequently, together with the Italian Socialist delegates (Oddino Morgari, Giacinto Menotti Serrati, and Angelica Balabanoff among them), Rakovsky was instrumental in convening the anti-war international socialist Zimmerwald Conference in September 1915.Fagan, Regroupment of the socialist movement; TƒÉnase, \\"Cristian Racovski\\"; Trotsky, Christian Rakovsky et Basile Kolarov During the congress, he came into open conflict with Lenin, after the latter voiced the Zimmerwald Left's opposition to the resolution (at one point, Rakovsky reportedly lost his temper and grabbed Lenin, causing him to temporarily leave the hall in protest). Later, he continued to mediate between Lenin and the Second International, a situation from which emerged a circular letter that complemented the Zimmerwald Manifesto while being more radical in tone. In October 1915, he reportedly did not protest Bulgaria's entry into the war‚Äîthis information was contradicted by Trotsky, who also indicated that the Tesniatsy had been the target of a government crackdown at that exact moment.Trotsky, Christian Rakovsky et Basile Kolarov 256x256px Rakovsky ran for Parliament for a final time during 1916, and again lost when contesting a seat in Covurlui County.Fagan, Regroupment of the socialist movement; Upson Clark Again arrested in 1916, after being accused of planning rebellion during a violent incident in Gala≈£i, he was, according to his own account, freed by a general strike which constituted \\"an outburst of indignation among the workers\\". Evaluating the situation in Romania, he identified the two main pro-Entente political forces of the moment, the groups led by Take Ionescu and Nicolae Filipescu, with, respectively, \\"corruption\\" and \\"reaction\\". Suspicions also rose that he had been contacted by German intelligence, that his 1915 trip to Italy had served German interests, and that he was being subsidized with German money.Torrey, p.23, 25 Rakovsky also drew attention to himself after welcoming to Bucharest the pro-German maverick socialist Alexander Parvus. His independence was consequently challenged by the interventionist paper AdevƒÉrul, a former socialist venue, who called Rakovsky \\"an adventurer without scruples\\", and viewed him as employed by Parvus and other German socialists.Torrey, p.25 Rakovsky himself alleged that, \\"under the mask of independence\\", AdevƒÉrul and its editor Constantin Mille were in the pay of Take Ionescu.

Held until after the February Revolution, he was freed by the Russian Army on May 1, 1917, and immediately left for Odessa.110 ani de social-democra≈£ie, p.15; Fagan, Regroupment of the socialist movement; Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\"; TƒÉnase, \\"Cristian Racovski\\"; Upson Clark =October Revolution= Rakovsky moved to Petrograd (the new name of Saint Petersburg) in the spring of 1917. His anti-war activism almost got him arrested; Rakovsky managed to flee in August, and was present in Stockholm for the Third Zimmerwald Conference; he remained there and, with Karl Radek, issued propaganda material in support of the Russian revolutionaries. Present in the internationalist faction of the Mensheviks, he joined the Bolsheviks in December 1917 or early 1918, after the October Revolution (although he was occasionally listed among the Old Bolsheviks).George Orwell, \\"Arthur Koestler. Essay\\". Retrieved July 19, 2007. Rakovsky later stated that he had friendly relations with the Bolsheviks from early autumn 1917, when, during the attempted putsch of Lavr Kornilov, he was hidden by these in Sestroretsk. His rise in influence and his approval of world revolution led him to seek Lenin's support for a Bolshevik government over Romania, at a time when a similar attempt was being made by the Odessa-based Romanian Social Democratic Action Committee, under the guidance of Mihai Gheorghiu Bujor; Stelian TƒÉnase claims that during the period, a group of one hundred Russian Bolsheviks had infiltrated Ia≈üi with the goal of assassinating King Ferdinand I and organizing a coup. Eventually, Lenin decided in favor of a unified project, and called on Bujor and Rakovsky to form a single leadership (which also included the Romanian expatriates Alecu Constantinescu and Ion Dic Dicescu).Fagan, Regroupment of the socialist movement; TƒÉnase, \\"Cristian Racovski\\" As the coup was under preparation in December 1917, Rakovsky was present on the border and waiting a signal to enter the country. When Bolsheviks were arrested and the move was overturned, he was probably responsible for ordering the arrest of Romania's representative to Petrograd, Constantin I. Diamandy, and his entire staff (all of whom were used as hostages, pending the release of prisoners taken in Ia≈üi). Trotsky, who was by then Russia's People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs (Foreign Minister), called on the Romanian government of Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu to hand in persons captured, indicating that he would otherwise encourage the communist activities of Romanian refugees on Russian soil, and receiving a reply according to which no such arrests had occurred. At the same time, Rakovsky regained Odessa, where he became a leader of the Bolshevik administrative body (Rumcherod), and, according to the claims of Stelian TƒÉnase, ordered violent reprisals to be aimed at Romanian nationals present in the city, and issued agitprop literature in Romanian.TƒÉnase, \\"Cristian Racovski\\"; Upson Clark As Russia negotiated the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany, he ordered Rumcherod troops to march towards Romania, which was by then giving in to the German advances and preparing to sign its own peace. Initially stalled by a much-criticized temporary armistice with Romanian Army leader Alexandru Averescu, Rakovsky ordered a fresh offensive in Moldavia, but had to retreat when the Central Powers, confronted with Trotsky's refusal to accept their version of a Russo-German peace, began their own military operation and occupied Odessa (setting free Romanians who had been imprisoned there). On March 9, 1918, Rakovsky signed a treaty with Romania regarding the evacuation of troops from Bessarabia, which Stelian TƒÉnase claims allowed for the Moldavian Democratic Republic to join Romania. In May, Romania conceded to the demands of the Central Powers (see Treaty of Bucharest, 1918).225x225pxIn April‚ÄìMay 1918, he negotiated with the Tsentral'na Rada of the Ukrainian People's Republic, then with the Hetmanate of Pavlo Skoropadsky, as well as with German forces (see Ukraine after the Russian Revolution).Fagan, Soviet Diplomat (1923‚Äì7); Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\" Soon after, Rakovsky left for Austria (where the First Republic had been proclaimed), being received by Foreign Minister Victor Adler (a member of Karl Renner's Social Democratic Party of Austria cabinet). Rakovsky's real goal was to reach Germany and negotiate the situation in Ukraine, but he was expelled upon arrival to that country. Escorted, together with Adolph Joffe and Nikolai Bukharin, to the German-aligned Belarusian Democratic Republic, he caught news of the collapse of the German Empire and was selected as a delegate to the German workers' councils. He and all other envoys were arrested by German soldiers in Kaunas, and sent to Minsk, then to Homyel, before making their way to Moscow. =Second Ukrainian government= After the subsequent Soviet offensive in Ukraine, Lenin appointed Rakovsky as the Chairman of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Workers and Peasants of Ukraine, replacing Georgy Pyatakov on January 16, 1919 due to the latter's argument with Fyodor Sergeyev for excessive interference in Ukrainian affairs. On March 29, 1919 the government was reorganized as the Soviet of the People's Commissars.Fagan, Rakovsky and the Ukraine (1919‚Äì23); Rakovsky, \\"An Autobiography\\" According to the British author Arthur Ransome, present in Moscow during early that year, \\"It had been found that the views of the Pyatakov government were further left than those of its supporters, and so Pyatakov had given way to Rakovsky who was better able to conduct a more moderate policy\\".Arthur Ransome, Russia in 1919. Retrieved July 19, 2007. While in office, Rakovsky totally ignored Ukrainian issues, considering Ukraine and its language merely \\"an invention\\" of intellectuals.Fagan, Rakovsky and the Ukraine (1919‚Äì23) At the time, Rakovsky assessed the situation created by the Treaty of Versailles, and advised his superiors to build warm relations with both Mustafa Kemal's Turkey and the Weimar Republic, as a camp of countries dissatisfied with policies of the Allied Powers.Fagan, Soviet Diplomat (1923‚Äì7) Rakovsky subscribed to the Bolshevik condemnation of Greater Romania, stance that journalist Victor FrunzƒÉ considered a revision of his previous views on Bessarabia.FrunzƒÉ, p.93; Livezeanu, p.250; TismƒÉneanu, p.44-45; Upson Clark During the Paris Peace Conference, the Romanian delegation attributed the shortage in supply in Bessarabia and Transylvania a Bolshevik conspiracy centered on Rakovsky;Livezeanu, p.250 various French reports of the time gave contradictory assessments (while some credited Rakovsky with direct influence on Soviet foreign policy, others dismissed the notion that Russia had any such projects). 241x241px Rakovsky simultaneously served as Soviet Ukraine's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and a member of the South West Front's Revolutionary Military Council, contributing to the defeat of the White Army and Ukrainian nationalists during the Russian Civil War, while theorizing that \\"Ukraine was a laboratory of internationalism\\" and \\"a decisive factor in world revolution\\".Rakovsky, in Fagan, Rakovsky and the Ukraine (1919‚Äì23) Rakovsky's presence was also decisive in rallying the dissident Borotbists to the Bolshevik faction's central bodies‚Äîhe was subsequently confronted with a degree of Borotbist opposition inside his government. According to American politologist Jerry F. Hough, his appointment and policies were evidence of Russification, a program requested by Lenin himself; Rakovsky's view contrasted with that supported by Stalin, who, at the time, was calling for increased Ukrainianization.Jerry F. Hough, Democratization and Revolution in the USSR, 1985‚Äì1991, Brookings Institution Press, Washington, D.C., 1997, p.223-224. On 13 February 1919 at the session of Kyiv city council Rakovsky as a head of Ukrainian government stated following: \\"Decreeing the Ukrainian language as a state language is reactionary and unnecessary\\".Mirchuk, P. Outline of the history of OUN. Vol.1. Munich-London-New-York: \\"Ukrayinske vydavnytstvo\\", 1968. In March 1919, Christian Rakovsky was one of the founding members of the Comintern, where he represented the Balkan Communist Federation. During those months, when control over the entire Ukraine was made possible by the offensive against Directorate forces, he expressed his support for the Yekaterinoslav wing of the Ukrainian Communist Party‚Äîfollowing its wishes, he subordinated the Ukrainian Communists to the Russian Communist Party and argued that a separate Central Committee was \\"luxury\\" for such a small grouping. In summer, as Rakovsky's government briefly lost control of Ukraine, his policies became hotly contested by partisans of Ukrainian autonomy inside the Party, who held a conference in Homyel (one which Rakovsky did not attend). At the Fourth Congress of the Ukrainian Party (March 1920), the leadership of Rakovsky, Stanislav Kosior, and Dmitry Manuilsky was not reelected. Attacks on them caused problems with the Russian Party; as Lenin himself sided with Rakovsky, a delegation comprising Trotsky, Lev Kamenev and Adolph Joffe left for Kyiv to discuss the matter with local leaders. In order to curb the crisis, the Ukrainian Party was subjected to a major purge, during which pro-autonomy opposition was removed from its ranks and the former leaders were reinstated. At the time, Rakovsky and Georgy Chicherin received harsh criticism from the Hungarian communist leaders B√©la Kun, for allegedly refusing aid to the Hungarian Soviet Republic and thus contributing to its fall.Richard Kent Debo, Survival and Consolidation: the Foreign Policy of Soviet Russia, 1918‚Äì1921, McGill-Queen's University Press, Montreal, 1992, p.117. This appears not to have been true, as Rakovsky reportedly urged Lenin to finance the Kun even as the latter faced the intervention of troops from both Romania and Czechoslovakia. Lenin wrote back to Kun informing him that the Central Committee was satisfied with the way in which Rakovsky and Chicherin had carried out their mission.1920 theater of war: farthest advances of Polish and Ukrainian People's Republic Directorate forces during the Kyiv Offensive =Reinstating of Soviet dominance and international conferences= After dealing with the common offensive of the Directorate and Polish forces‚Äîthe Kyiv Offensive (see Polish-Soviet War in 1920)‚Äî, Rakovsky's government took measures regarding collectivization; according to his biographer Gus Fagan, he became himself a proponent of greater Ukrainian autonomy, and advocated both Ukrainization through the complete integration of Borotbists into Party structures and a slower pace in communization. He notably came into conflict with the Russian Party after his second executive had its independent Commissariat of Foreign Trade replaced with an office under the control of central authorities. He continued to pressure for a measure of independence in Ukrainian economy, and, during the early 1920s, the republic sealed its own trade agreements with other European countries. Rakovsky remained a Romanian citizen for the entire period. In 1921, he was officially summoned to be tried by a court-martial for \\"crime against the security of the Romanian state\\".FrunzƒÉ, p.93 He was sentenced to death in absentia (1924). Journalist Victor FrunzƒÉ claims this move had been prompted by a supposed similar verdict given by a Soviet Court to Ion Incule≈£ (who had led the Moldavian Democratic Republic's Legislative Assembly that voted union with Romania).FrunzƒÉ, p.95 As the Socialist Party of Romania delegation (Gheorghe Cristescu, Eugen Rozvan, David Fabian, Constantin Popovici, Ioan Fluera≈ü, and Alexandru Dobrogeanu-Gherea) voted to adhere to the Comintern, Rakovsky and Grigory Zinoviev pressured the group to expel those of its members who supported Greater Romania (including Fluera≈ü and Popovici, as well as Iosif Jumanca and Leon Ghelerter).TismƒÉneanu, p.45-47 248x248px In February 1922, he was sent to Berlin in order to negotiate with German officials, and, in March, was part of the official delegation to the Genoa Conference‚Äîunder the leadership of Georgy Chicherin. Rakovsky himself was virulently opposed to any stalemate with the Allies, and urged his delegation not to abandon policies over promises of deescalation and trade. A leader of the delegation's commissions on economic aid, loans and government debt, he was also charged with renewing contacts with Germany‚Äîtogether with Adolph Joffe, he discussed the matter with the pro-Soviet Ago von Maltzan, and, as Russia failed to reach an agreement with the Allies, managed to obtain from Germany promises of cooperation (see Treaty of Rapallo, 1922). Two years later, when captured by the Bolsheviks, Eser conspirator Boris Savinkov allegedly confessed that he intended to have both Rakovsky and Chicherin killed in Berlin, as they returned from Genoa.\\"Battle for Life\\", in Time, September 8, 1924 In November 1922, Rakovsky attended the Conference of Lausanne, where he was confronted with the assassination of his fellow diplomat Vaslav Vorovsky by the √©migr√© Maurice Conradi. As the Soviet Union was being created, Rakovsky became opposed to the new central leadership over the issue of self-determination for the Soviet republics and autonomous republics. This followed the dispute between, on one side, Joseph Stalin, Zinoviev, Totsky and Kamenev, and, on the other, the leadership of the Georgian SSR (see Georgian Affair). At the time, he evidenced a \\"permanent struggle which the so-called independent and autonomous republics had to carry out to safeguard not only their prerogatives but their very own existence\\". Arguing in favor of extending the revolution from Ukraine to the Balkans, and indicating his belief that the peasantry was being alienated by internationalist messages, Rakovsky cited concerns that centralism was placing Soviet influence in peril, and called for \\"carrying out a correct theoretical and practical solution to the national question within the boundaries of the Soviet Union\\". In November 1922, he successfully proposed the formation of a Soviet of Nationalities to double the Soviet of the Union inside the supreme legislative body; his arguments in favor of reducing the number of representatives of Russian SFSR and barring the total number of envoys from any republic at one fifth of the total were dismissed after being criticized by Stalin. =Trotskyist opposition and ambassadorship= After Lenin's illness and incapacitation, Rakovsky joined Leon Trotsky's Left Opposition and came into conflict with Stalin. Although declining, his influence in Ukraine was, according to political scientist John P. Willerton, one of Trotsky's main bases of support, alongside sections of the Red Army, a group of Komsomol leaders, and various officials involved in economic planning.John P. Willerton, Patronage and Politics in the USSR, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1992, p.28. In early July 1923, after being isolated inside the Ukrainian leadership, he was removed from his Ukrainian post, replaced with Vlas Chubar, and sent to London to negotiate a formal recognition of the Soviet regime by the British and French governments. Chubar, an ethnic Ukrainian, came to represent Stalin's view on nationality issues in the region, officially defined as \\"nativization\\". In London, Rakovsky and his wife were joined by Elena Codreanu, whom they had adopted. In 1924, as the Labour Party minority cabinet came to power, Ramsay MacDonald and Rakovsky negotiated de jure recognition and agreed on possible future Anglo- Soviet treaty and a British loan for the Soviet Union. Negotiations were tested by the so-called Bankers' Memorandum, published by The Times, which demanded that the Soviet Union abandon nationalizations and return to private property. Eventually, two treaties were signed, allowing for commerce to be normalized between the two countries, and reflecting Rakovsky's views that private complaints of creditors against the Soviet state were to be settled outside the conference. The scandal which erupted when the Zinoviev Letter was publicized, rekindling suspicions against the Soviet government and provoking the fall of MacDonald's cabinet, brought an end to all further talks; during and after the incident, Rakovsky repeatedly cited evidence that the Letter was a forgery.

Mar 1924212x212px In parallel, he had begun negotiations with France's Raymond Poincar√©, who aimed for a \\"solidarity of foreign creditors\\" in respect to the Soviet state,Poincar√©, in Fagan, Soviet Diplomat (1923‚Äì7) and who agreed to recognize the latter on October 28, 1924. One of his last tasks involved placing Soviet orders for machinery, textiles, and other commodities with British manufacturers: worth 75 million US$ on paper, these failed to attract attention after he announced that the Soviet government did not intend to pay in cash.\\"Notes\\", in Time, July 27, 1925 According to the American magazine Time, Rakovsky also played a hand in motivating Stalin's decision to marginalize Comintern leader Zinoviev, by complaining that the latter's foreign policy was needlessly radical.\\"The Little Corporal\\", in Time, May 18, 1925 Rakovsky served as the Soviet ambassador to France between October 1925 and October 1927, replacing Leonid Krasin. He did not take hold of his office until 50 days after his official appointment, refusing to be received at the √âlys√©e Palace by French President Gaston Doumergue for as long as the state authorities would not allow The Internationale (a revolutionary song which was at the time the Soviet national anthem) to be played on the occasion.\\"Bugle Blast\\", in Time, December 21, 1925 Doumergeue resisted, and, in the end, Rakovsky was received to the sound of an improvised arrangement of bugles, the more discreet part of which may have been based on The Internationale. Time described it as a \\"deafening blast\\". His first task involved renewed negotiations with the cabinet of Aristide Briand (February 1926), during which he was confronted with the vocal campaign of creditors. Early results achieved in discussions with Anatole de Monzie were dismissed by the opposition rallied around Poincar√©, and, after being revived by the short-lived cabinet of √âdouard Herriot, talks ended without any result.\\"Faux Pas\\", in Time, March 22, 1926; Fagan, Soviet Diplomat (1923‚Äì7) Poincar√© returned to power, and France remained committed to the Locarno Treaties (which had isolated the Soviet state on the international stage). Over the following year, Christian Rakovsky continued to attempt a d√©tente with France, advertising Soviet concessions and speaking directly to the public. During the same period, as tensions grew between Mexico and the Soviet government over the latter's support for a Mexican railway workers' strike, American agents reported that Rakovsky was instructed to threaten with publicizing correspondence between former President √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n and Soviet authorities (which had occurred before diplomatic links were established).Daniela Spenser, Impossible Triangle: Mexico, Soviet Russia, and the United States in the 1920s, Duke University Press, Durham, 1999, p.105-106. Since this could endanger Mexico's relations with the United States, President Plutarco El√≠as Calles chose to deescalate the conflict. Rakovsky with Leonid Krasin and Charles Rappoport, Paris, 1924 Together with his second wife, Rakovsky gave full approval to Max Eastman's volume Since Lenin Died, which centered on heavy criticism of Soviet realities, and which they reviewed before it was published.Theodore Draper, American Communism and Soviet Russia, Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, 2003, p. 360. He became acquainted with the former French Communist Party member and anti-Stalinist journalist Boris Souvarine, as well as with the Romanian writer Panait Istrati, who had observed Rakovsky's career ever since his presence in Romania.TƒÉnase, \\"The Renegade Istrati\\" He also maintained friendly contacts with Marcel Pauker, a prominent but independent-minded member of the Romanian Communist Party, whose activities were denounced by the Comintern in 1930.Robert Levy, Ana Pauker: The Rise and Fall of a Jewish Communist, University of California Press, Berkeley, 2001, p.64-66. Rakovsky was eventually declared a persona non grata in France and recalled after signing the Declaration of the Opposition, a Trotskyist platform deemed unfriendly by the French government (it stressed support for revolutions and mutinies in all capitalist countries).\\"Rakovsky's Recall\\", in Time, October 17, 1927; Fagan, Soviet Diplomat (1923‚Äì7); TƒÉnase, \\"The Renegade Istrati\\" According to Time, France's decision was tacitly welcomed by Foreign Affairs Commissar Georgy Chicherin, due to Rakovsky's political opinions.\\"Sneaked Away\\", in Time, October 31, 1927 Rakovsky left without presenting his letter of recall to President Doumergue, although he was scheduled for a meeting at the √âlys√©e. He was initially scheduled to serve as Ambassador to Japan. On his trip back to the Soviet state, he was joined by Istrati, who, partly owing to his witnessing of the Rakovsky's downfall, soon became a noted opponent of Stalinism. =Persecution and internal exile= In December, Rakovsky and Lev Kamenev held brief speeches in front of the Soviet Communist Party's Fifteenth Congress.Lewis H. Siegelbaum, Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918‚Äì1929, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1992, p.189-190. The former was interrupted fifty-seven times by his opponents‚ÄîNikolai Bukharin, Martemyan Ryutin, and Lazar Kaganovich. Although, unlike Rakovsky, Kamenev used the occasion to appeal for reconciliation, he was himself interrupted twenty-four times by the same group.

Stalin expelled me from the [Foreign Affairs Commissariat] for having signed the same declaration. But in both cases they let me keep the jacket\\".Rakovsky, in Fagan, Opposition and Exile While in Astrakhan, Rakovsky was employed by the Regional Planning Committee (Gubplan). He was also active as a writer, starting work on a volume detailing the sources of Utopian socialism and the thought of Saint-Simon.Rakovsky, in Fagan, Opposition and Exile; TƒÉnase, \\"The Renegade Istrati\\" Rakovsky remained involved in Trotskyist politics, was contacted by Panait Istrati and the Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis, and corresponded with Trotsky (who had himself been exiled to Almaty). Most of his writings were confiscated by the State Political Directorate, but the letter on Soviet \\"bureaucratism\\" he addressed to Nikolai Valentinov survived, and became notorious as a critique of Stalinism (under the title \\"Professional Dangers\\" of Power).Rakovsky, in Fagan, Opposition and Exile; TismƒÉneanu, p.61-62 Mistrusting Stalin's new leftist policies, he foresaw the renewed moves against the Left Opposition (inaugurated by Trotsky's 1929 expulsion). As his health deteriorated, he was allowed to move to Saratov upon requests addressed by Krestinsky to Kaganovich, the Secretary of the Central Committee. He was visited by Louis Fischer, who recorded Rakovsky's determination not to submit to Stalin (contrasting his option with those of Radek, Yevgeni Preobrazhensky, Alexander Beloborodov and Ivar Smilga). Instead, Rakovsky incited further resistance to Stalinism, and issued a declaration of the united opposition; following this, he was sent to Barnaul, which he called a \\"hole in the barren cold ground\\". In another critical letter to the Party leadership (April 1930), he called for, among other things, the restoration of civil liberties, a reduction in the party apparatus, the return of Trotsky, and an end to forced collectivization. Little is known of Rakovsky's life between that moment and July 1932, the moment when he was allowed a medical leave. Towards the end of the same year, Trotsky was informed that he had attempted to flee the Soviet Union, and, in March 1933, it was announced that he had been deported to Yakutia. Answering Trotsky's request, the French mathematician and Trotskyist Jean Van Heijenoort, together with his fellow activist Pierre Frank, unsuccessfully called on the influential Soviet author Maxim Gorky to intervene in favor of Christian Rakovsky, and boarded the ship he was traveling on near Istanbul.Tova Yedlin, Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography, Praeger/Greenwood, Westport, 1992, p.201-202. According to Heijenoort, they only managed to meet Gorky's son, Maxim Peshkov, who reportedly told them that his father was indisposed, but promised to pass on their request. Researcher Tova Yedlin proposed that the problem was caused by Gorky's distress over having recently separated from his mistress Moura Budberg, as well as to the writer's close surveillance by OGPU agents. =Submission to Stalin and the Show Trial= Rakovsky was one of the last leading Trotskyists to break with Trotsky and surrender to Stalin. Alarmed by Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany and under intense pressure from Stalin, he announced his submission to the Party through a telegram he sent Izvestia (February 23, 1934). While Rakovsky was allowed to return to Moscow, Trotsky declared the dissociation statement to be \\"purely formal\\".Trotsky, in Fagan, Opposition and Exile Rakovsky formally \\"admitted his mistakes\\" in April 1934 (his letter to the Pravda, titled There Should Be No Mercy, depicted Trotsky and his supporters as \\"agents of the German Gestapo\\").Medvedev, p.169 He was appointed to high office in the Commissariat for Health and allowed to return to Moscow, also serving as Soviet ambassador to Japan in 1935.Feofanov & Barry, p.22 Cited in allegations involving the killing of Sergey Kirov, Rakovsky was arrested in autumn 1937, during the Great Purge; according to Trotsky, he was forced to wait without food or rest for 18 hours, during which time his house was being searched. Shortly thereafter, in March 1938, he was put on trial along with Nikolai Bukharin, Alexei Rykov, Genrikh Yagoda, Nikolai Krestinsky and other Old Bolsheviks, on charges of conspiring with Trotsky to overthrow Stalin, the third Moscow Show Trial‚Äîknown as the Trial of the Twenty One.Fagan, Opposition and Exile; Medvedev, p.169, 175‚Äì176, 186; TismƒÉneanu, p.50, 74 In his forced confession to Andrey Vyshinsky, he admitted to all the charges‚Äîincluding having been a spy (for Japan) and a landowner. He made attempts to point out that his revenue had been used to support socialism, and that he had a grasp of \\"revolutionary practices\\", but was attacked by Vyshinsky, who persistently referred to Rakovsky as \\"a counterrevolutionary\\". In his final statement, Rakovsky argued: \\"from my young days I honestly, truthfully and devotedly performed my duty as a soldier of the cause of the emancipation of labor. After this bright period a dark period set in, the period of my criminal deeds\\". Unlike most of his co-defendants, who were immediately executed, he was sentenced to twenty years of hard labor.Fagan, Opposition and Exile; Medvedev, p.178 In 1941 he was in Oryol Prison. After the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa), Rakovsky was shot on Stalin's orders outside Oryol‚Äîalong with Olga Kameneva, Maria Spiridonova and over 150 other political prisoners in the Medvedev Forest massacre. This execution was one of the many massacres of prisoners committed by the NKVD in 1941. Legacy and rehabilitation Rakovsky's second wife, Alexandrina Alexandrescu, was herself arrested, and is known to have been held in Butyrka prison, where she suffered a series of heart attacks. His adoptive daughter, Elena Codreanu-Racovski, was expelled from her job as secretary of the Mossoviet Theater, and deported to Siberia.BrƒÉtescu, p.425-426 She returned to Moscow in the 1950s, after Stalin's death, and settled in Communist Romania after 1975, rejoining her brother, the biologist and academic Radu Codreanu.BrƒÉtescu, p.426 She later authored a memoir which included recollections of her father (it was published in Romanian as De-a lungul ≈üi de-a latul secolului, \\"The Length and Breadth of the Century\\").BrƒÉtescu, p.426-427 It was compiled from personal notes and dialogs with physician and former communist militant G. BrƒÉtescu, who noted that, probably owing to suspicions she had in respect to the Romanian communist regime, Elena Codreanu refused to talk about Rakovsky's trial and her own persecution. Rakovsky's nephew Boris Stefanov, whom he encouraged to join the Romanian socialist movement before World War I, later became a general secretary of the Romanian Communist Party, before being himself purged in 1940.Ilarion ≈¢iu, \\"Aliatul lui Stalin\\" (\\"Stalin's Ally\\"), in Jurnalul Na≈£ional, June 7, 2005 By 1932, Rakovsky's name was frequently invoked in the heated debate involving Panait Istrati and his political adversaries. Istrati, having returned to Romania in disillusion over Soviet realities, was initially attacked in the local right-wing newspapers Curentul and Universul; writing for the former, Pamfil ≈ûeicaru defined Istrati as \\"the servant of Racovski\\".≈ûeicaru, in TƒÉnase, \\"The Renegade Istrati\\" Having published To the Other Flame, in which he exposed Stalinism, he consequently became the target of intense criticism and allegations from various pro-Soviet writers, led by the Frenchman Henri Barbusse. During this period, the Romanian communist writer Alexandru Sahia speculated, among other things, that Istrati had been in the pay of Rakovsky and Trotsky for a sizable part of his life. Based on his independent opinions and, in part, on his friendship with Rakovsky, Marcel Pauker was disavowed by the Romanian and Soviet communist parties, and was himself a victim of the Great Purge in 1938. At various intervals between 1930 and 1952, his wife, the Romanian communist leader Ana Pauker, faced pressures to denounce her husband. She allegedly refused to criticize him for anything other than his association with Rakovsky, and to admit that Marcel Pauker had been guilty of all the charges brought against him. The Hungarian-born author Arthur Koestler, himself a former communist, based Rubashov, the main character in his 1940 novel Darkness at Noon, on victims of the Moscow Trials; according to George Orwell, Rakovsky's fate was a possible direct influence: \\"Rubashov might be called Trotsky, Bukharin, Rakovsky or some other relatively civilised figure among the Old Bolsheviks. If one writes about the Moscow trials one must answer the question, ¬´Why did the accused confess?¬ª and which answer one makes is a political decision. Koestler answers, in effect, ¬´Because these people had been rotted by the Revolution which they served¬ª, and in doing so he comes near to claiming that revolutions are of their nature bad\\". In 1988, during Glasnost, the Soviet government cleared Rakovsky and his co-defendants of all charges.Feofanov & Barry, p.34; Shapiro His rehabilitation came in February, coinciding with that of Bukharin, as well as with those of Ukrainian official and former People's Commissar for Agriculture Mikhail Alexandrovich Chernov, former People's Commissar for Foreign Trade Arkady Rosengolts, and other five officials.Philip Taubman, \\"50 Years After His Execution, Soviet Panel Clears Bukharin\\", in The New York Times, February 6, 1988 Bukharin, Rakovsky, Rozengolts, and Chernov were posthumously reinstated to the Communist Party on June 21, 1988.Philip Taubman, \\"Bukharin Status in Party Restored\\", in The New York Times, July 10, 1988 His works were given imprimatur, while a favorable biography was published by the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (late 1988).Shapiro Cigarettes –†–∞–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π–ü–æ—Ç–∞–ø–µ–Ω–∫–æ1927.jpgRakovsky on the cigarettes pack, 1927, Kharkiv, U.S.S.R.

During a 22-year baseball career (1972‚Äì1994), he pitched for nine different teams, spending his best years with the New York Yankees and San Diego Padres. The nickname \\"Goose\\" came about when a friend did not like his previous nickname \\"Goss\\", and noted he looked like a goose when he extended his neck to read the signs given by the catcher when he was pitching. Although Gossage is otherwise generally referred to as \\"Rich\\" in popular media, a baseball field named after him bears the name \\"Rick\\".http://i527.photobucket.com/albums/cc353/TameraGoldsmith/CS%20Daily%20Photo%202009/07082009.jpg In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was one of the earliest manifestations of the dominating modern closer, with wild facial hair and a gruff demeanor to go along with his blistering fastball. He led the American League in saves three times and was runner-up twice; by the end of the 1987 season he ranked second in major-league career saves, trailing only Rollie Fingers, although by the end of his career his total of 310 had slipped to fourth all-time. When he retired he also ranked third in major-league career games pitched (1,002), and he remains third in wins in relief (115) and innings pitched in relief (1,556); his 1,502 strikeouts place him behind only Hoyt Wilhelm among pitchers who pitched primarily in relief. He also is the career leader in blown saves (112). From 1977 through 1983 he never recorded an earned run average over 2.62, including a mark of 0.77 in , and in he finished third in AL voting for both the MVP Award and Cy Young Award as the Yankees won a division title. Respected for his impact in crucial games, Gossage recorded the final out to clinch a division, league, or World Series title seven times. His eight All-Star selections as a reliever were a record until Mariano Rivera passed him in 2008; he was also selected once as a starting pitcher. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008. He now works in broadcasting. Career Gossage grew up near N. Cascade Avenue in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He graduated (1970) from Wasson High School where he played on the baseball and basketball teams and was included in the school's athletic \\"Wall of Fame.\\" His wife Corna Gossage also graduated from Wasson High. The Chicago White Sox selected him in the ninth round of the 1970 Major League Baseball draft. Gossage led the American League (AL) in saves in 1975 (26). After the 1976 season, the White Sox traded Gossage and Terry Forster to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Silvio Martinez and Richie Zisk. He became a free agent after the 1977 season, and signed with the New York Yankees. Gossage again led the AL in saves in 1978 (27) and 1980 (33). On October 2, , he earned the save in the Yankees' one-game playoff against the Boston Red Sox for the AL East title, entering with one out in the seventh inning and a 4‚Äì2 lead following Bucky Dent's home run; although he allowed two runs in the eighth inning, he held on to preserve the 5‚Äì4 victory, getting Carl Yastrzemski to pop up to third baseman Graig Nettles with two out and two men on base in the ninth inning to clinch the division championship. He was also on the mound five days later when the Yankees clinched the pennant in the ALCS against the Kansas City Royals, entering Game 4 in the ninth inning with a 2‚Äì1 lead and a runner on second base; he earned the save by striking out Clint Hurdle and retiring Darrell Porter and Pete LaCock on fly balls. He was on the mound ten days later when they captured the World Series title against the Los Angeles Dodgers for their second consecutive championship, coming on with no one out in the eighth inning of Game 6; he retired Ron Cey on a popup to catcher Thurman Munson to clinch the win. One of his most impressive performances was on September 3, 1978, in a game vs. the Seattle Mariners. Replacing Sparky Lyle in the top of the 9th with runners on second and third and no outs, he preserved a 4‚Äì3 lead by striking out the next three batters in 11 pitches.September 3, 1978 Yankees box score: https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA197809030.shtmlSept 4, 1978 newspaper article https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8IEyAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=rOYFAAAAIBAJ&dq;=gossage&pg;=5397%2C402722 He missed some of the 1979 season with the Yankees with a thumb injury sustained in a locker-room fight with teammate Cliff Johnson. Ron Guidry, the reigning Cy Young Award winner, volunteered to go to the bullpen to replace him. In the first game of a doubleheader on October 4, , Gossage pitched the last two innings of a 5‚Äì2 win over the Detroit Tigers, earning his career-high 33rd save as New York clinched another division title. On October 10, George Brett of the Royals hit a tide-turning three-run homer off Gossage into Yankee Stadium's right-field upper deck to lead the Royals to a three-game sweep in the AL Championship Series, after the Yankees had defeated the Royals in three consecutive ALCS from 1976 to 1978. Almost three years later during the regular season, Brett got to the Goose again in the Bronx, blasting a go-ahead two-run home run in the top of the ninth in a game memorialized as the \\"Pine Tar Game\\". Gossage as a member of the Yankees in 1981 Gossage recorded saves in all three Yankee victories in the 1981 AL Division Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, not allowing a run in 6‚Öî innings, and he was again the final pitcher when they clinched the 1981 pennant against the Oakland Athletics. In , his last season with the Yankees, Gossage broke Sparky Lyle's club record of 141 career saves; Dave Righetti passed his final total of 150 in . Gossage holds the Yankees' career record for ERA (2.14) and hits per nine innings (6.59) among pitchers with at least 500 innings for the team. In eight of his first ten seasons as a closer, Gossage's ERA was less than 2.27. Over his career, right-handed hitters hit .211 against him. Gossage during 1983 spring training Gossage became upset with Yankees' owner George Steinbrenner for meddling with the team. In 1982, he called Steinbrenner \\"the fat man upstairs\\", and disapproved of the way Yankees' manager Billy Martin used him. Gossage became a free agent after the 1983 season, and insisted that he would not resign with New York. He signed with the San Diego Padres. In 1984, Gossage clinched another title, earning the save in Game 5 of the NL Championship Series and sending the Padres to their first World Series; after San Diego had scored four runs in the seventh inning to take a 6‚Äì3 lead against the Chicago Cubs, Gossage pitched the final two innings, getting Jody Davis to hit into a force play for the final out. During game 5 of the 1984 World Series versus the Detroit Tigers, Gossage, after receiving signs from the coaches on the Padres bench and a visit to the mound by Padres manager Dick Williams, refused to intentionally walk right fielder Kirk Gibson. On the second pitch Gossage and the Padres would regret that decision as Gibson homered to deep right field leading to a World Series win for the Detroit Tigers. On August 17, , Gossage struck out Pete Rose in Rose's final major- league at bat.Baseball's Top 100: The Game's Greatest Records, p. 11, Kerry Banks, 2010, Greystone Books, Vancouver, BC, Before the 1988 season, the Padres traded Gossage and Ray Hayward to the Cubs for Keith Moreland and Mike Brumley. On August 6, , while with the Cubs, Gossage became the second pitcher to record 300 career saves in a 7‚Äì4 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, coming into the game with two out in the ninth and two men on base and retiring Phil Bradley on a popup to second baseman Ryne Sandberg. Released by the Cubs in March 1989, he signed with the San Francisco Giants in April. The Yankees selected Gossage off of waivers in August. He pitched for the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks of Nippon Professional Baseball in 1990. Gossage signed with the Texas Rangers for the 1991 season. On July 23, , a statistical coincidence was noted when he recorded his 308th career save to preserve Nolan Ryan's 308th win. Gossage signed one-year contracts to pitch for the Oakland Athletics in 1992 and 1993. A ticket from the game where Gossage earned his 300th save. Gossage signed with the Seattle Mariners for the 1994 season. On August 4, , Gossage became the third pitcher in major league history to appear in 1,000 games. Gossage entered a game against the California Angels with two out in the seventh inning and runners on second and third base, trailing 2‚Äì1; he picked up the win when the Mariners scored three times in the eighth for a 4‚Äì2 victory. In his final major league appearance on August 8, he earned a save of three innings‚Äîhis first in over 15 months‚Äîin the Mariners' 14‚Äì4 win over the Rangers, retiring all nine batters he faced; Jos√© Canseco flied out to left field to end the game. Gossage had a record 112 career blown saves. ESPN.com noted that blown saves are \\"non-qualitative\\", pointing out that the two career leaders‚ÄîGossage and Rollie Fingers (109)‚Äîwere both inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Fran Zimniuch in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball wrote, \\"But you have to be a great relief pitcher to blow that many saves. Clearly, [Gossage] saved many, many more than he did not save.\\" More than half of Gossage's blown saves came in tough situations, with the tying run on base when the pitcher entered. In nearly half of those blown tough saves, he entered the game in the sixth or seventh inning. Multiple-inning outings provide more chances for a reliever to blow a save, as he needs not only to get out of the initial situation but also to pitch additional innings in which to possibly lose the lead. Pioneer of the closer role The New York Yankees of the late 1970s and early 1980s arguably pioneered the set- up/closer configuration, which was a standard baseball practice until the 2010s. The most effective pairing was Ron Davis and Gossage, with Davis typically entering the game in the 7th or 8th innings and Gossage finishing up. During one stretch with that pairing, the Yankees won 77 of 79 games in which they led after six innings. Gossage and top relievers of his era were known as firemen, relievers who entered the game when a lead was in jeopardy‚Äîusually with men on base‚Äîand regardless of the inning and often pitching two or three innings while finishing the game.Zimniuch 2010, pp.xx,81 Gossage had 17 games where he recorded at least 10 outs in his first season as a closer, including three games where he went seven innings. He pitched over 130 innings as a reliever in three different seasons. He had more saves of at least two innings than saves where he pitched one inning or less. The ace reliever's role evolved to where he was reserved for games where the team had a lead of three runs or less in the ninth inning. Mariano Rivera, considered the greatest closer of all time, earned only one save of seven-plus outs in his career, while Gossage logged 53. \\"Don't tell me [Rivera's] the best relief pitcher of all-time until he can do the same job I did. He may be the best modern closer, but you have to compare apples to apples. Do what we did,\\" said Gossage.Zimniuch 2010, p. 97 During his career, Gossage pitched in 1,002 games and finished 681 of them, earning 310 saves. Per nine innings pitched, he averaged 7.45 hits allowed and 7.47 strikeouts. He also made nine All-Star appearances and pitched in three World Series. Pitching style Gossage was one of the few pitchers who employed basically just one pitch, a fastball. However, his fastball was one of the best of all time, routinely throwing in the 98-to-102-mph range in his prime, with pinpoint accuracy. Occasionally he would throw a slurve or a changeup. Despite his reputation as a pitcher who intentionally threw at hitters, Gossage stated that he threw at only three hitters in his career: Ron Gant, Andr√©s Galarraga, and Al Bumbry. Even into his 40s, in the early 1990s, he still threw regularly in the mid-90s, though he did not close games as often as he did in his youth, serving as a capable and intimidating setup man. Gossage had a reputation as a no-nonsense no- frills pitcher who wasted no time on the mound. Throwing only one kind of pitch left little need for communicating with the catcher. He would stand on the mound and pitch from the stretch position as soon as the batter was in the batter's box. Retirement All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball Game during the 2008 All-Star break. Gossage lives in his home town, Colorado Springs, Colorado, and is active in the community promoting and sponsoring youth sports. In 1995, the city of Colorado Springs dedicated the Rick \\"Goose\\" Gossage Youth Sports Complex, which features five fields for youth baseball and softball competition. He also owned hamburger restaurants in Greeley and Parker, Colorado, called Burgers N Sports. He has written an autobiography, released in 2000, entitled The Goose is Loose (Ballantine: New York). His son, Todd, is a professional baseball player who has played for the Sussex Skyhawks, Newark Bears, and Rockland Boulders of the Can-Am League. Gossage coached the American League team in the Taco Bell All-Star Legends & Celebrity Softball Game in Anaheim, California on July 12, 2010. At the Hall of Fame induction in 2008, Gossage expressed gratitude to a number of baseball people who had helped him through his career, and several times described his Hall of Fame week experience as \\"amazing\\". The inductions included Dick Williams, his manager at San Diego. After the ceremonies, the two of them sat together for an ESPN interview on the podium, taking audience questions and gently ribbing each other, especially about the upper-deck home run Kirk Gibson hit off Gossage in Game 5 of the 1984 World Series. The Yankees honored Gossage with a plaque in Monument Park on June 22, 2014.

Instead of relying on television programming for entertainment, participants read, daydream, explore, enjoy nature, and spend time with family and friends. Over 300 million people have taken part in the turnoff, with millions participating each year. In 2010, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) became the home of Screen-Free Week at the request of the Board of the Center for SCREEN-TIME Awareness (CSTA), which ran the initiative since 1994 (first as TV-Free America). CCFC launched a new website and developed a new Organizer's Kit, fact sheets, and other materials for Screen-Free Week 2011 and beyond. The Screen-Free Week Organizer's Kit is available as a free download. History In 1994, the week was first championed by TV-Free America, and promoted by Adbusters magazine and other organizations. TV-Free America then became Center for SCREEN-TIME Awareness. CSTA was an organization that encouraged all people to use electronic screen media responsibly and then have more time for a healthy life and more community participation. It was a grassroots alliance of many different organizations, with participation in over 70 nations around the world. Screen Free week happens in Canada. CCFC changed the name of TV-Turnoff to Screen-Free Week in 2010, since entertainment media (and advertising) are increasingly delivered through a variety of screens (computers, hand-held devices, etc.), and not just traditional television commercials. In 2008, Adbusters changed the name of TV Turnoff Week to Digital Detox Week to reflect the growing predominance of computers and other digital devices. The 2019 event took place from 29 April to 5 May. Members and supporters Important members of the network include Adbusters in Canada and White Dot in the UK (named after the small white dot that would briefly appear when turning off older TV sets, especially black-and-white ones). A related organization, , works in many countries with large Spanish-speaking populations.

Biography Born in Manchester, Reid drew from an early age. At the age of nine he was diagnosed with a tubercular hip and was confined to bed for six months, during which time he drew constantly.Peter Hansen, He left school at thirteen and won a free scholarship to Salford Art School,Ken Reid interviewed by David Britton, Savoy Books, 1979 but was expelled shortly before graduation after being caught in a local caf√© when he should have been in class. He set himself up in a studio as a commercial artist, with little success until his father offered to act as his agent, and bluffed his way into an interview with the art editor of the Manchester Evening News. Reid was invited to submit ideas for a new children's section for the paper, and proposed The Adventures of Fudge the Elf, which first appeared in 1938 and ran until 1963,, Manchester Evening News, 7 February 1987 with a break from 1941 to 1946 when Reid was on National Service. After a brief period contributing to Comic Cuts in the late 1940s, Reid proposed a full colour strip called \\"Zooville\\" to the Eagle. At the same time, Dundee- based publishers D. C. Thomson & Co., to whom he had been introduced by his brother-in-law, fellow cartoonist Bill Holroyd, invited him to contribute to The Beano. Their managing editor, R. D. Low, travelled to Manchester to discuss a proposed new strip, \\"Roger the Dodger\\", with him. Reid accepted their offer, and \\"Roger\\" first appeared in The Beano on 18 April 1953. Over the next decade he drew a number of successful strips for The Beano and its sister comic The Dandy, including \\"Jonah\\", a strip about a jinxed sailor who brings bad luck to every ship he sails on, written by Walter Fearne. Reid later recalled how much Fearne's scripts made him laugh, but he made many visual alterations to them, cramming as many as thirty panels to a page. In 1964 Reid and fellow artist Leo Baxendale left D. C. Thomson to work for Odhams Press' new titles Wham! and Smash, which allowed Reid to write as well as draw his strips. He began to explore his interests in \\"comic horror\\" and gruesome imagery, which would characterise the latter part of his career, with \\"Frankie Stein\\" and \\"The Nervs\\", the latter of which he took over from Baxendale.Lew Stringer, Ken Reid and the Nervs, 3 April 2007 For Pow! in 1967 he created \\"Dare-a-Day Davy\\", a character who could not resist dares set for him by readers. One episode, in which Davy was dared to resurrect Frankenstein, was too gruesome for the editors and eventually saw print in the underground comic Weird Fantasy in 1969. In 1971 he created \\"Faceache\\", a boy who could \\"scrunge\\" his face into any shape, for Jet, which later moved to Buster where it continued until Reid's death. Through the 1970s and 1980s he created horror-themed strips for a variety of comics, including \\"Creepy Creations\\" for Shiver and Shake, \\"Martha's Monster Makeup\\" for Monster Fun and \\"Tom Horror's World\\" for Whoopee!. He was named Best Writer and Best Artist by the Society of Strip Illustrators in 1978. On 2 February 1987, while drawing a page of \\"Faceache\\" at his home in Pendlebury, Greater Manchester, Reid suffered a stroke and died in hospital.

New feature: * Post-macOS Mojave media compatibility checker See also a release history in context with the rest of Final Cut Studio. Market position Motion is a motion graphics and compositing application similar in some ways to After Effects and Nuke. With version 3, Apple added 3D compositing, vector paint, and motion tracking to Motion's toolbox. This added power, plus the GPU accelerated nature of Motion, allows it to be seen as an alternative to those packages for titling and simple animation projects. Features Features of Motion include the ability to create custom particle effects (as well as using pre-built ones) and to add filters, effects and animations in real time. Motion has the ability to address up to 32 GB of RAM and GPU acceleration at 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit float color depths. Motion 2 can also integrate with a MIDI keyboard, so that parameters can be controlled by keys or faders; this opens up the possibility of real time parameter input into Motion. In addition Motion 3 now allows for complete 2D and 3D compositing in a multiplane environment. =Behaviors= As well as supporting traditional keyframe animation, Motion introduced a system of pre-set 'behaviors' which can be combined to create realistic animations. For instance, the 'throw' behaviour will move an object across the screen. Combined with the 'gravity' behavior, it will simulate a realistic arc of motion. The effects can be tweaked utilizing various parameters, varying the strength of the bounces, the amount of gravity to apply and so on. This is very different from traditional animation software, which requires the use of keyframes to determine the position of an object at any given time. Such software then automatically creates motion to fill the spaces between the keyframes. This makes it easy to know exactly where objects are on the screen at any given time, but it is considerably more difficult to create realistic animations that build up on different, conflicting forces. =The Replicator and Particle Emitters= In Version 2 a new 'replicator' function was introduced, which allows an object to be replicated to create a repeating pattern of a specified size and shape. With this tool, it is possible to create animations in which the elements of a replicated pattern move in sequence. 'Particle emitters' allow the user to set a pre-drawn shape to rapidly generate copies of itself and emit them across the screen. The direction and intensity can be adjusted, and combined with behaviors to create very complex animations quickly and easily. For example, a particle emitter used in conjunction with a star shape and the 'vortex' behaviour would animate a circle of swirling stars. =The H.U.D.= Motion features a floating semi- transparent window (\\"heads-up display\\", or HUD) which displays the most commonly altered parameters of the object or effect currently selected. This allows the user to make quick adjustments without having to search through palettes and menus. However, exact numerical values cannot be entered in this window. For more precise editing, consult the Inspector window. =Tools= Motion has the following tools available for the creation or manipulation of graphics on the canvas: * Anchor point - each object has an 'anchor point' that acts as the centre of rotation or enlargement. * Shear mapping * Drop shadow * Four Corner, which changes the perspective of objects. * Crop * B√©zier curve adjustment * Rectangle, ellipse, B√©zier curve and B-spline creation tools. * The text tool. * Rectangle, ellipse, B√©zier and B-spline masking tools (which define the part of an object that is visible). These tools can be accessed from the toolbar at the top of the screen or with keyboard commands. =Recording= Recording is used for adjusting an object over a specific amount of time by placing and manipulating keyframes. The recording button is a red dot button adjacent to the play/pause features. When the button is selected, it lights up red and the dot turns white. Any adjustments made when the button is selected are saved as keyframes. Keyframes act as placeholders that solidify an object's characteristics at a single frame (anything from position and rotation to cropping and size). Using multiple recordings, an object shall reorient itself between the two keyframes to match each set characteristics. Recording can act as an alternative to movement behaviors that allow more in-depth adjustments. How Motion works Motion uses pixel shaders which move the processing of video effects to the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) of a modern graphics card. Motion is also compatible with Apple's Core Image technology, allowing one to use the Image Units that come standard with Mac OS X Tiger. Like pixel shaders, Core Image 'stacks' various effects, allowing a number of effects to be combined together without slow-down. A faster graphics card improves performance. Motion is also the first Pro App to introduce FxPlug Apple's plug-in architecture that allows for GPU acceleration. In Motion, users import their own graphics files and use pre-prepared graphics such as text and shapes. Objects can be grouped into layers, but they always retain their own distinct identity. These various parts are then grouped into a single layer. Selecting that layer permits moving all of the objects as a single body...

Philip the Good (; ; 31 July 1396 ‚Äì 15 June 1467) was Duke of Burgundy from 1419 until his death. He was a member of a cadet line of the Valois dynasty, to which all the 15th-century kings of France belonged. During his reign, the Burgundian State reached the apex of its prosperity and prestige and became a leading center of the arts. Philip is known in history for his administrative reforms, his patronage of Flemish artists such as Jan van Eyck and Franco-Flemish composers such as Gilles Binchois, and the capture of Joan of Arc. In political affairs, he alternated between alliances with the English and the French in an attempt to improve his dynasty's position. As ruler of Flanders, Brabant, Limburg, Artois, Hainaut, Holland, Luxembourg, Zeeland, Friesland and Namur, he played an important role in the history of the Low Countries. Family and early life Coat of arms of Philip the Good (after 1430) Born in 1396 in Dijon, Philip was the son of John the Fearless and Margaret of Bavaria. His father succeeded Philip's grandfather Philip the Bold as Duke of Burgundy in 1404. On 28 January 1405, Philip was named Count of Charolais in appanage of the duke and probably became engaged on the same day, at the age of 8, to Michelle of Valois, a daughter of King Charles VI of France and Isabeau of Bavaria. They were married in June 1409. After Michelle's death in 1422, Philip married Bonne of Artois, a daughter of Philip of Artois, Count of Eu, and also the widow of his uncle, Philip II, Count of Nevers, in Moulins-les-Engelbert on 30 November 1424. Bonne of Artois is sometimes confused with Philip's biological aunt, also named Bonne (a sister of John the Fearless who lived from 1379 to 1399), in part due to the papal dispensation required for the marriage, which made no distinction between a marital aunt and a biological aunt. Bonne of Artois lived only a year after Philip married her. Philip was married for a third time to Isabella of Portugal, a daughter of John I of Portugal and Philippa of Lancaster, in Bruges on 7 January 1430, after a proxy marriage the year before. This marriage produced three sons: *Anthony (30 September 1430, Brussels ‚Äì 5 February 1432, Brussels), Count of Charolais; *Josse (24 April 1432 ‚Äì aft. 6 May 1432), Count of Charolais; *Charles (10 November 1433 ‚Äì 5 January 1477), Count of Charolais and Philip's successor as Duke of Burgundy, known as \\"Charles the Bold\\" or \\"Charles the Rash\\" Philip also had at least eighteen illegitimate children by various of his 24 documented mistresses, of whom these are the best known: *Corneille of Burgundy (c. 1420 ‚Äì 1452), captain-general/governor of Luxembourg, killed in the Battle of Bazel (1452); *Anthony, bastard of Burgundy (1421‚Äì1504), lord of La Roche, Sainte-Menehould, Gu√Ænes, Lord of Cr√®vecoeur and Beveren; *David of Burgundy (c. 1427 ‚Äì 1496), bishop of Therouanne and bishop of Utrecht, a fine amateur artist, and the subject of a biography in 1529; *Anne of Burgundy (c. 1435 ‚Äì 1508), governess of Mary of Burgundy, married Adrian of Borssele and later Adolph of Cleves, Lord of Ravenstein; *Rapha√´l of Burgundy, also called Rapha√´l de Marcatellis (c. 1437 ‚Äì 1508), abbot of the Saint-Bavo Abbey in Ghent and the Saint-Peter Abbey in Oudenburg; *Baldwin of Burgundy (c. 1446 ‚Äì 1508), Lord of Fallais, Peer, Boudour, Sint-Annaland, Lovendegem, Zomergem en Fromont; *Philip of Burgundy (1464‚Äì1524), Bishop of Utrecht. Corneille and Anthony were his favorite bastard sons and successively bore the title Grand b√¢tard de Bourgogne (first Corneille and after his death, Anthony).

Philip accused Charles, the Dauphin of France and Philip's brother-in-law, of planning the murder, which took place during a meeting between John and Charles at Montereau. Because of this, he continued to prosecute the Armagnac‚ÄìBurgundian Civil War, which in turn became entangled in the larger Hundred Years' War. In 1420, Philip allied himself with Henry V of England under the Treaty of Troyes. In 1423, the marriage of Philip's sister Anne to John, Duke of Bedford, regent for Henry VI of England (and also his uncle), strengthened the English alliance. On 23 May 1430, Philip's troops under the Count of Ligny captured Joan of Arc at Compi√®gne and later sold her to the English, who orchestrated a heresy trial against her conducted by pro- Burgundian clerics. Despite this action against Joan of Arc, Philip's alliance with England was broken in 1435 when he signed the Treaty of Arras, which completely revoked the Treaty of Troyes and recognised Charles VII as king of France. Philip signed the treaty for a variety of reasons, one of which may have been a desire to be recognised as the preeminent duke in France. This action would prove a poor decision in the long term; Charles VII and his successors saw the Burgundian State as a serious impediment to the expansion of royal authority in France, and for this reason they would permanently try to undermine Burgundy, subordinating it to French sovereignty. Philip's defection to the French would prove not only catastrophic to the dual monarchy of England and France, but to his own domains as well, subordinating them to a powerful centralised Valois monarchy. He then attacked Calais, a possession of the English, but the alliance with Charles was broken in 1439. Philip supported the revolt of the French nobles the following year (an event known as the Praguerie) and offered shelter to the Dauphin Louis, who had rebelled against his father Charles VII. Geographic expansion Philip was generally preoccupied with matters in his own territories and was seldom involved directly in the Hundred Years' War between England and France, although he did play a role during a number of periods, such as the campaign against Compi√®gne during which his troops captured Joan of Arc. He incorporated Namur into Burgundian territory in 1429 (by purchase from John III, Marquis of Namur) and Hainault and Holland, Friesland and Zeeland in 1432 with the defeat of Jacqueline, Countess of Hainault, in the last episode of the Hook and Cod wars. He inherited the Duchies of Brabant and Limburg and the Margraviate of Antwerp in 1430 on the death of his cousin Philip of Saint-Pol and purchased Luxembourg in 1443 from Elisabeth of Bohemia, Duchess of Luxembourg. In 1456, Philip also managed to ensure his illegitimate son David was elected Bishop of Utrecht and his nephew Louis of Bourbon elected Prince-Bishop of Li√®ge. It is not surprising that in 1435 Philip began to style himself the \\"Grand Duke of the West\\". In 1463, Philip gave up some of his territory to King Louis XI of France. That year he also created an Estates-General for the Netherlands based on the French model. The first meeting of the Estates-General was to obtain a loan for a war against France and to ensure support for the succession of his son Charles I to his dominions. In 1465 and 1467, Philip crushed two rebellions in Li√®ge. Philip died in Bruges in 1467. Court life and patron of the arts Rogier van der Weyden miniature 1447-8. Philip dresses his best, in an extravagant chaperon, to be presented with a History of Hainault by the author, Jean Wauquelin, flanked by his son Charles and his chancellor Nicolas Rolin. Philip's court can only be described as extravagant. Despite the flourishing bourgeois culture of Burgundy, with which the court kept in close touch, he and the aristocrats who formed most of his inner circle retained a world-view dominated by knightly chivalry. He declined membership in the English Order of the Garter in 1422, which could have been considered an act of treason against the king of France, his feudal overlord. Instead, he created his own Order of the Golden Fleece, based on the Knights of the Round Table and the myth of Jason, in 1430. Philip had no fixed capital and moved the court between various palaces, the main urban ones being Brussels, Bruges, and Lille. He held grand feasts and other festivities, and the knights of his Order frequently travelled throughout his territory to participate in tournaments. In 1454, Philip planned a crusade against the Ottoman Empire, launching it at the Feast of the Pheasant, but this plan never materialized. In a period from 1444 to 1446, he is estimated to have spent a sum equivalent to 2% of Burgundy's main tax income in the recette g√©nerale, with a single Italian supplier of silk and cloth of gold, Giovanni di Arrigo Arnolfini. Portrait of Isabella of Portugal from the workshop of Rogier van der Weyden, c. 1445‚Äì50 Philip's court was regarded as the most splendid in Europe, and it became the accepted leader of taste and fashion, which probably helped the Burgundian economy considerably, as Burgundian (usually Flemish) luxury products became sought by the elites of other parts of Europe. During his reign, for example, the richest English commissioners of illuminated manuscripts moved away from English and Parisian products to those of the Netherlands, as did other foreign buyers. Philip himself is estimated to have added six hundred manuscripts to the ducal collection, making him by a considerable margin the most important patron of the period. Jean Mi√©lot was one of his secretaries, translating into French such works as Giovanni Bocaccio's Genealogia Deorum Gentilium. Philip was also a considerable patron of other arts. He commissioned many tapestries (which he tended to prefer over paintings), pieces from goldsmiths, jewellery, and other works of art. It was during his reign that the Burgundian chapel became the musical center of Europe, with the activity of the Burgundian School of composers and singers. Gilles Binchois, Robert Morton, and later Guillaume Dufay, one of the most prominent composers of the 15th century, were all part of Philip's court chapel. In 1428, Jan van Eyck traveled to Portugal to paint a portrait of the daughter of King John I, the Infanta Isabella, for Philip in advance of their marriage. With help from more experienced Portuguese shipbuilders, Philip established a shipyard in Bruges. Rogier van der Weyden painted his portrait twice on panel, of which only copies survive, wearing the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece. The only original van der Weyden of Philip to survive is a superb miniature from a manuscript (above left). The painter Hugo van der Goes of the Early Netherlandish school is credited with creating paintings for the church where Philip's funeral was held.

In September 1976, after Chairman Mao Zedong's death, the People's Republic of China was left with no central authority figure, either symbolically or administratively. The Gang of Four was dismantled, but new Chairman Hua Guofeng continued to persist on Mao-era policies. After a bloodless power struggle, Deng Xiaoping came to the helm to reform the Chinese economy and government institutions in their entirety. Deng, however, was conservative with regard to wide-ranging political reform, and along with the combination of unforeseen problems that resulted from the economic reform policies, the country underwent another political crisis with the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.  Power struggles after Mao's death  =Hua Guofeng and the return of Deng Xiaoping (1976‚Äì1978)= Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Communist Party of China, died on September 9, 1976. At the time of his death, China was in a political and economic quagmire. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and subsequent factional fighting had left the country much poorer, weaker, and isolated than it had been in 1965. Scores of capable party officials, bureaucrats, intellectuals, and professionals were languishing in prison or laboring in factories, mines, and fields. Schools for special education started to open Chinese people mourned him, but not in the more emotional way they had mourned the late Premier Zhou Enlai. Meanwhile, Mao's designated successor Hua Guofeng had assumed the post of party chairman. Hua was unaware that the Gang of Four were plotting his downfall until Defense Minister Ye Jianying and several generals warned him about this, saying that he'd better do something before it was too late. Hua was a bit surprised, but he agreed, and in October the Gang were arrested. None of them put up any resistance, although one of Jiang Qing's housekeepers reportedly spat at her as she was being taken away. The demise and arrest of the Gang of Four prompted nationwide celebrations, including parades in the streets of Beijing and other major cities. The Gang of Four symbolized everything that went wrong during the ten years of chaos of the Cultural Revolution, and their demise, the general populace had expected, would mark the beginning of a new era. In late 1976 and early 1977, the state propaganda machine was working overtime to promote Hua Guofeng. He was billed as being Mao's personally appointed successor and as having saved China from the Gang of Four. Hua tried to fill his mentor's shoes by, among other things, sporting an identical haircut. He stated that \\"in order to honor Chairman Mao, we should govern in accordance with his wishes.\\" and proclaimed the \\"Two Whatevers\\", meaning that \\"Whatever Chairman Mao said, we will say, and whatever Chairman Mao did, we will do.\\" Throughout 1977‚Äì78, policy efforts centered around economic recovery. Schools began to reopen, and the more extreme aspects of Mao's personality cult were toned down. It was now being said that he was a great leader and thinker, but not an infallible god and that the revolution had been the work of many people and not just him. The Cultural Revolution was said to have been a well-meaning idea that got out of control, and Hua declared that a second CR might be necessary in a few years. Beginning in April 1978, newspapers stopped printing Mao's quotations in bold text. Nuclear weapons testing, missile, and space launches continued apace. Hua's reliance on Maoist orthodoxy led him to continue a cult of personality surrounding his own image alongside Mao's, equating his presence to that of Mao, but pinpointing the focus at a nominally separate era. To provide for distinct identity, Hua attempted his own change of the Chinese written language by further simplifying characters. A small number of these Hua-era simplifications continue to be in use informally, as there was no formal sanction of their legitimacy after Hua left office. In early 1977, the National Anthem was changed to reflect pure communist ideology rather than revolutionary drive, inserting lyrics exclusively dealing with Mao Zedong Thought and building an ideal socialist nation, as opposed to the wartime patriotism reflected by the original lyrics. Hua's unimaginative policies received relatively little support, and he was regarded as an unremarkable leader, lacking political support within the Politburo. At the time Deng Xiaoping was still living in seclusion because of \\"political mistakes,\\" and the issue of his return to politics was yet again put on the table. Deng had insisted on supporting all of Hua's policies in one of the letters the two men exchanged, to which Hua responded that Deng had \\"made mistakes, and rightfully must continue to receive criticism.\\" The arrest of the Gang of Four, Hua said, did not justify that Deng's \\"revisionist\\" ideas should resurface. During a Politburo meeting in March 1977, many members voiced support for Deng's return, to no avail. In a letter to Hua dated April 10, Deng Xiaoping wrote, \\"I am fully behind Chairman Hua's policies and agenda for the country.\\" This letter would be openly discussed in the Politburo, and in July 1977, Deng Xiaoping was restored in his former posts. In August, the 11th Party Congress was held, which again rehabilitated Deng and confirmed his election as the new Committee Vice-Chairman, and the Central Military Commission's Vice-Chairman, Deng guaranteed the elevation of his supporters, Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang and Wan Li. In February 1978, a new constitution was adopted. This was the third one used by the PRC, after the original 1954 document (which was not followed to any meaningful extent after 1957) and the short-lived 1975 \\"Gang of Four\\" constitution. The new one was patterned after the 1954 constitution and attempted to restore some rule of law and mechanisms for economic planning. In regards to the latter, Hua Guofeng wanted a return to the Soviet-style economics of the mid-1950s. He drew up a ten-year plan which emphasized heavy industry, energy, and capital construction. In regards to foreign policy, Hua made his first trip abroad in May 1978. This was a visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, where he was given a warm reception and joined North Korean leader Kim Il-sung in calling for the United States to withdraw its troops from the Republic of Korea. In September, Deng Xiaoping also visited the North Korean capital Pyongyang. He was unimpressed with Kim Il-sung's extensive personality cult, having seen enough of this sort of thing in China with Mao and also took umbrage at being expected to lay a wreath in front of the giant gold-plated statue of Kim in Pyongyang. Deng reportedly expressed his displeasure at how the aid money given to North Korea by China over the years was being spent on statues and monuments honoring Kim. He suggested that they might be better served using that aid to improve their people's living standards. The North Koreans appeared to have gotten the message, for the gold plating was quietly scraped off the Kim statue in Pyongyang afterwards. Trying to crawl out of its international isolation, China mended fences with Yugoslavian leader Josip Tito, who visited Beijing in May 1977 after having been long denounced as a revisionist traitor. In October 1978, Deng Xiaoping visited Japan and concluded a peace treaty with that country's prime minister Takeo Fukuda, officially ending the state of war that had existed between the two countries since the 1930s. While Japan and China had in fact opened diplomatic relations in 1972, the peace treaty took nearly six years to negotiate, one major sticking point being Chinese insistence on Tokyo including a clause that denounced Soviet \\"hegemony\\" in Asia. There was little sign of improved relations with the Soviet Union, and Deng Xiaoping declared the 1950 Sino-Soviet friendship treaty to be null and void. Relations with Vietnam suddenly turned hostile in 1979. These two countries had once been allies, but in 1972 Mao Zedong told Vietnamese premier Pham Van Dong that they should stop expecting Chinese aid and that the old historical feud between the two countries would erupt again. China also gave its support to the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime that took power in Cambodia during 1975, provoking the hostility of the Soviet-backed Vietnamese government. In January 1979, Vietnam invaded Cambodia and drove the Khmer Rouge from power. During his U.S. visit, Deng Xiaoping remarked that Vietnam would have to \\"be taught a lesson\\". In February, a full-scale Chinese attack was launched on the Vietnamese border. Although China withdrew after three weeks and declared its objectives met, the war had not gone well and demonstrated the country's weakness. The PLA lost over 20,000 men due to weapons and equipment that were outdated, poorly made, and in short supply (a side effect of the disruption caused by the Cultural Revolution), maps that were decades old, the continued use of human-wave tactics from the Korean War, and the fact that the army had no system of ranks. Even worse was the fact that the Chinese had not even engaged Vietnam's regular army (which was in Cambodia), but instead fought militia and home guard units. On the other hand, it was a political victory since the Soviet Union had failed to come to its ally's aid and contented itself with verbal protests. In reference to Moscow's inaction, Deng Xiaoping reiterated Mao Zedong's saying that \\"You can't know how the tiger will react until you poke its backside.\\" China finally fully established diplomatic relations with the United States at the beginning of 1979. This had been planned since President Nixon's visit in February 1972, but was delayed by the Watergate scandal and the US withdrawal from Vietnam. The US agreed to recognize the PRC as China's sole government. Diplomatic relations with Taiwan were terminated, but unofficial and commercial ties remained. Deng Xiaoping visited the U.S. in February and met with President Carter. Meanwhile, Hua Guofeng headed to Europe in May. He first stopped in France, reportedly because it was the first western nation to recognize the PRC, and made a fierce attack on Soviet expansionism and hegemony. Later in Germany, he displayed more restraint and decided against making what would have been a highly provocative visit to the Berlin Wall. China's establishment of diplomatic ties with the United States brought about a mixed reaction from the communist world similar to Richard Nixon's 1972 visit. While the Soviets could not condemn this, they were deeply worried about Sino-US collusion against them. Romanian leader Nicolae Ceau»ôescu hailed it as \\"an outstanding event for world peace and detente\\". North Korea also congratulated \\"our brotherly neighbor for ending long-hostile relations and establishing diplomatic ties with the US\\" while Cuba and Albania openly denounced Beijing as traitors to the cause of world socialism (Albanian relations with China had been deteriorating since 1972 and the announcement of economic reforms by the new leadership caused the tiny country to sever all contact completely). =Deng becomes Paramount Leader= Although Hua continued in his leadership role, his power began waning the moment Deng Xiaoping returned to Beijing. The two continued to co-rule for a time, but the latter was rapidly gaining power. With Mao and Zhou Enlai gone, there was no one else in China with his experience and leadership abilities and his ideas seemed fresh and appealing as opposed to Hua's stale promotion of Mao Zedong Thought. Hua was quickly seen as being nothing more than a vacuous party hack with no ideas of his own. This was reflected in the 1978 constitution, which still contained references to proletarian internationalism and continuous revolution. As Vice-Premier in charge of Technology and Education, Deng restored the University Entrance Examinations in 1977, opening the doors of post-secondary education to nearly a generation of youth who lacked this opportunity because of the Cultural Revolution. He elevated the social status of intellectuals from the lows of the Cultural Revolution to becoming an \\"integral part of socialist construction.\\" Deng chaired the (11th) National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China's de jure legislative body, and stressed the importance of the Four Modernizations, a series of advances in various fields aimed at strengthening the country by adapting to modern standards. By then Deng was poised to make a final political move to grab power. On May 11, 1978, the Guangming Daily newspaper published an article, inspected by Deng's supporter Hu Yaobang, titled \\"Practice sets the only Standard to Examine Truth\\".„ÄäÂÖâÊòéÊó•Êä•„ÄãËØÑËÆ∫ÔºöÂÆûË∑µÊòØÊ£ÄÈ™åÁúüÁêÜÁöÑÂîØ‰∏ÄÊ†áÂáÜ, retrieved from Sina.com. Dated May 11, 1978 The article stressed the importance of uniting theory and practice, denounced the dogmatic euphoria of the Mao era, and was, in fact, an outright criticism on Hua's Two Whatevers policy. This article was reprinted in many newspapers across the country, and echoed widespread support amongst party organs and the general populace. Discussions sprung up nationwide in government and military organizations, and Deng's novel and pragmatic stance gained increasing popularity. Despite the freshness of Deng's ideas, in truth his ideas were not really new, but merely an effort to restore China to the situation of the mid-1960s, right before the Cultural Revolution and in any case, the Politburo continued to be a gerontocracy dominated by men born in the opening years of the 20th century, all of whom had participated in the Long March and Chinese civil war. The 81 year old Ye Jianying was forced to step down as defense minister in 1978 for health reasons and even with the death of several party elders during the 1970s, the average age of the Central Committee was still around 70. In April, Deng began the political rehabilitation of those who were formerly labeled \\"rightists\\" and counter-revolutionaries, a campaign led by Hu Yaobang that pardoned the wrongly accused, restoring the reputation of many party elders and intellectuals who were purged during the Cultural Revolution and other campaigns going all the way back to the Anti-Rightist Movement in 1957. Prominent politically disgraced people including Peng Dehuai, Zhang Wentian, He Long and Tao Zhu were given belated rank-appropriate funerals at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery. Liu Shaoqi was given a large state funeral in May 1980, when the country was asked to mourn the former president eleven years after his death. During this time, the CCP also established rules for an orderly succession of state and government leaders. Deng Xiaoping proposed mandatory retirement ages despite some protests from party elders and also guidelines were put in place that CCP members who lost their posts or were removed from office could not be jailed or subjected to physical harm. In this regard, Deng borrowed much from Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev when the latter had ended Stalin's terror state and established the practice of using more peaceful methods to dispose of his political rivals. To that end, CCP figures such as Hua Guofeng were merely demoted to unimportant posts, but otherwise retained their party membership and state pension. In 1979, the CCP made a pledge to the nation that it would never again embark on mass campaigns like the Cultural Revolution. Meanwhile, the Gang of Four went on trial in 1980 on charges of counterrevolution, attempting to overthrow the state, and plotting to assassinate Mao. Only Jiang Qing tried to defend herself, repeatedly interrupting the proceedings with hysterical outbursts and sobbing. She argued that she had never done anything more than follow Mao's orders, saying \\"I was his dog. Whoever he told me to bite, I bit.\\" and daring the authorities to cut off her head. The others were given life in prison, but Jiang was sentenced to death. However, Mao's memory still lingered strong, and her sentence was later commuted to life. She hanged herself in a Beijing hospital in 1991 while undergoing treatment for throat cancer. The power transition from Hua to Deng was confirmed in December 1978, at the Third Plenum of the Central Committee of the Eleventh National Party Congress, a turning point in China's history. The course was laid for the party to move the world's most populous nation toward the ambitious targets of the Four Modernizations. After a decade of turmoil brought about by the Cultural Revolution, the new direction set at this meeting was toward economic development and away from class struggle. The plenum endorsed major changes in the political, economic, and social system. Hua renounced his \\"Two Whatevers\\" and offered a full self-criticism. Replacing the old focus of class struggles was the new policy focused on economic construction. It also instituted sweeping personnel changes, culminating in the elevation of two key supporters of Deng Xiaoping and the reform program, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. In contrast to previous leadership changes, Hua would resign his posts one by one, although he remained on the Politburo until 1982. Hua was replaced by Zhao Ziyang as Premier of the State Council in September 1980, and by Hu Yaobang as Party General Secretary of the party in September 1982. The post of chairman was abolished to ensure that no one person could ever dominate the party as Mao Zedong had done. Until the mid-1990s, Deng Xiaoping was China's de facto Paramount leader, retaining only the official title of Chairman of the Central Military Commission, but not the chief offices of the State, government, or the Party. Meanwhile, Li Xiannian was appointed to the post of Chinese President, vacant since 1968. Li was a believer in central planning, and his appointment to this largely ceremonial position was a compromise move to appease conservative elements in the party. With changes to the Chinese Constitution in 1982, the President was conceived of as a \\"figurehead\\" head of state, with actual power resting in the hands of the Premier of the People's Republic of China and the General Secretary of the Party, who were meant to be two separate people. In the original plan, the Party would develop policy, and the state would execute it. Deng's intentions were to have power divided, thus preventing a cult of personality from forming as it did in the case of Mao. The new emphasis on procedure, however, seemed largely undermined by Deng himself, who assumed none of the official titles on the grounds that they should go to younger men. After 1979, the Chinese leadership moved toward more pragmatic policies in almost all fields. The party encouraged artists, writers and journalists to adopt more critical approaches, although open attacks on party authority were not permitted. The Chinese government repudiated the Cultural Revolution. A major document presented at the September 1979 Fourth Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee, gave a \\"preliminary assessment\\" of the entire 30-year period of Communist rule. At the plenum, party Vice Chairman Ye Jianying declared the Cultural Revolution \\"an appalling catastrophe\\" and \\"the most severe setback to [the] socialist cause since [1949].\\" The Chinese government's condemnation of the Cultural Revolution culminated in the Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China, adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This stated that \\"Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist and theorist. It is true that he made gross mistakes during the \\"cultural revolution\\", but, if we judge his activities as a whole, his contributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his mistakes. His merits are primary and his errors secondary.\\" As political ideology was downgraded, numerous statues of Mao were removed around the country and portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin were taken down from Tiananmen Square. In late 1978, many emboldened people began staging rallies and protests in Beijing. They erected a large number of wall posters (the so-called \\"Democracy Wall\\") criticizing the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong, the Gang of Four, and Hua Guofeng. All these were tolerated because of being more-or-less in line with official positions, but some began calling for democracy and open elections. This was more than the authorities were willing to tolerate and they quickly stressed that the party would continue to hold power and guide the nation towards socialism. While greater freedom of thought would be allowed, loyalty to the party and socialist thought would still be required. Nonetheless, writers began criticizing corruption, privileges enjoyed by party officials, and unemployment, all things that supposedly could not exist under socialism. It was now officially admitted that 20 million Chinese were unemployed and 100 million did not have enough food to eat. Boluan Fanzheng and economic reform =A new page in diplomacy= Deng Xiaoping with US President Jimmy Carter, January 1979 Relations with the West improved markedly during Deng's term, although the People's Republic of China had gained a certain degree of recognition from the West in the late Mao era. In 1968, the government of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau initiated negotiations with the People's Republic of China that led to the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Canada on October 13, 1970. Canada and China established resident diplomatic missions in 1971, and it led to a series of diplomatic successes in the west. The People's Republic of China joined the United Nations in 1971, replacing the international legitimacy previous held by the Kuomintang Government of the Republic of China on the island of Taiwan. In February 1972, US President Richard Nixon made an unprecedented eight-day visit to the People's Republic of China and met with Mao Zedong. On February 22, 1973, the United States and the PRC agreed to establish liaison offices. Although both sides intended to establish diplomatic relations quickly, this move was delayed until 1979 due to the Watergate scandal. Deng traveled abroad and had a series of amicable meetings with western leaders, traveling to the United States in 1979 to meet President Jimmy Carter at the White House. Carter finally recognized the People's Republic, which had replaced the Taiwan-based Republic of China as the sole Chinese government recognized by the UN Security Council in 1971. One of Deng's achievements was the agreement signed by the United Kingdom and the PRC on December 19, 1984 under which Hong Kong was to be transferred to the PRC in 1997. With the 99-year lease on the New Territories coming to an end, Deng agreed that the PRC would not interfere with Hong Kong's capitalist system and would allow the locals a high degree of autonomy for at least 50 years. This \\"one country, two systems\\" approach has been touted by the PRC government as a potential framework within which Taiwan could be reunited with the mainland. Deng, however, did not improve relations with the Soviet Union. He continued to adhere to the Maoist line of the Sino-Soviet Split era, which stated that the Soviet Union was a superpower equally as \\"hegemonist\\" as the United States, yet even more threatening to the PRC because of its closer proximity. Deng brought China conflict with Vietnam in 1979, following the Vietnam War, under this subject of border disputes, and fought in the Sino-Vietnamese War. \\"Red China\\" was a frequent appellation for the PRC between the Communist ascendancy and the mid-late 1970s with the rapprochement between China and the West (generally within the capitalist/Western bloc). The term was first used, before the establishment of the PRC, in the late 1940s during the Chinese Civil War, to describe the Communist side, and saw great prevalence in the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s. Starting around 1972‚Äì1973, following Richard Nixon's visit to China and the beginning of rapprochment and mounting likelihood of diplomatic normalization, the term began to drop in usage significantly. By the early 1980s, it was increasingly rare in mainstream journalism and publications in the Western countries. Since the early 1980s, however, the term remains in use in some circles, particularly right-wing or conservative political discourse and publications; nonetheless, some, including some conservatives, feel the term is not applicable to China in the contemporary period as the country is no longer a \\"monolithic political entity whose subjects march in lockstep with an all-powerful Communist regime.\\" As of the early 2000s, \\"Red China\\" still retains some use among more right-wing writers, especially when framing China as an economic or political competitor or opponent (e.g. the \\"China threat\\" theory). \\"Red China\\" is sometimes used in more mainstream/less overtly partisan journalism for metaphoric or comparative use (e.g. \\"Red China or Green\\", New York Times article title). =Sino- Vietnamese War of 1979= China's relations with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam began to deteriorate seriously in the mid-1970s. After Vietnam joined the Soviet-dominated Council for Mutual Economic Cooperation (Comecon) and signed the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the Soviet Union in 1978, China branded Vietnam the \\"Cuba of the East\\" and called the treaty a military alliance. Incidents along the Sino-Vietnamese border increased in frequency and violence. In December 1978 Vietnam invaded Cambodia, quickly ousted the Pol Pot regime, and overran the country. China's twenty-nine-day incursion into Vietnam in February 1979 was a response to what China considered to be a collection of provocative actions and policies on Hanoi's part. These included Vietnamese intimacy with the Soviet Union, mistreatment of ethnic Chinese living in Vietnam, hegemonistic \\"imperial dreams\\" in Southeast Asia, and spurning of Beijing's attempt to repatriate Chinese residents of Vietnam to China. In February 1979 China attacked along virtually the entire Sino- Vietnamese border in a brief, limited campaign that involved ground forces only. The Chinese attack came at dawn on the morning of 17 February 1979, and employed infantry, armor, and artillery. Air power was not employed then or at any time during the war. Within a day, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) had advanced some eight kilometers into Vietnam along a broad front. It then slowed and nearly stalled because of heavy Vietnamese resistance and difficulties within the Chinese supply system. On February 21, the advance resumed against Cao Bang in the far north and against the all-important regional hub of Lang Son. Chinese troops entered Cao Bang on February 27, but the city was not secured completely until March 2. Lang Son fell two days later. On March 5, the Chinese, saying Vietnam had been sufficiently chastised, announced that the campaign was over. Beijing declared its \\"lesson\\" finished and the PLA withdrawal was completed on March 16. Hanoi's post- incursion depiction of the border war was that Beijing had sustained a military setback if not an outright defeat. Most observers doubted that China would risk another war with Vietnam in the near future. Gerald Segal, in his 1985 book Defending China, concluded that China's 1979 war against Vietnam was a complete failure: \\"China failed to force a Vietnamese withdrawal from [Cambodia], failed to end border clashes, failed to cast doubt on the strength of the Soviet power, failed to dispel the image of China as a paper tiger, and failed to draw the United States into an anti-Soviet coalition.\\" Nevertheless, Bruce Elleman argued that \\"one of the primary diplomatic goals behind China's attack was to expose Soviet assurances of military support to Vietnam as a fraud. Seen in this light, Beijing's policy was actually a diplomatic success, since Moscow did not actively intervene, thus showing the practical limitations of the Soviet-Vietnamese military pact. ... China achieved a strategic victory by minimizing the future possibility of a two-front war against the USSR and Vietnam.\\" After the war both China and Vietnam reorganized their border defenses. In 1986, China deployed twenty-five to twenty-eight divisions and Vietnam thirty-two divisions along their common border. The 1979 attack confirmed Hanoi's perception of China as a threat. The PAVN high command henceforth had to assume, for planning purposes, that the Chinese might come again and might not halt in the foothills but might drive on to Hanoi. The border war strengthened Soviet-Vietnamese relations. The Soviet military role in Vietnam increased during the 1980s as the Soviets provided arms to Vietnam; moreover, Soviet ships enjoyed access to the harbors at Danang and Cam Ranh Bay, and Soviet reconnaissance aircraft operated out of Vietnamese airfields. The Vietnamese responded to the Chinese campaign by turning the districts along the China border into \\"iron fortresses\\" manned by well-equipped and well-trained paramilitary troops. In all, an estimated 600,000 troops were assigned to counter Chinese operations and to stand ready for another Chinese invasion. The precise dimensions of the frontier operations were difficult to determine, but its monetary cost to Vietnam was considerable. By 1987, China had stationed nine armies (approximately 400,000 troops) in the Sino-Vietnamese border region, including one along the coast. It had also increased its landing craft fleet and was periodically staging amphibious landing exercises off Hainan Island, across from Vietnam, thereby demonstrating that a future attack might come from the sea. Low-level conflict continued along the Sino-Vietnamese border as each side conducted artillery shelling and probed to gain high spots in the mountainous border terrain. Border incidents increased in intensity during the rainy season, when Beijing attempted to ease Vietnamese pressure against Cambodian resistance fighters. Since the early 1980s, China pursued what some observers described as a semi- secret campaign against Vietnam that was more than a series of border incidents and less than a limited small-scale war. The Vietnamese called it a \\"multifaceted war of sabotage.\\" Hanoi officials have described the assaults as comprising steady harassment by artillery fire, intrusions on land by infantry patrols, naval intrusions, and mine planting both at sea and in the riverways. Chinese clandestine activity (the \\"sabotage\\" aspect) for the most part was directed against the ethnic minorities of the border region. According to the Hanoi press, teams of Chinese agents systematically sabotaged mountain agricultural production centers as well as lowland port, transportation, and communication facilities. Psychological warfare operations were an integral part of the campaign, as was what the Vietnamese called \\"economic warfare\\"‚Äîencouragement of Vietnamese villagers along the border to engage in smuggling, currency speculation, and hoarding of goods in short supply. In recent years, both countries have pursued good relations and downplayed the years of hostility from 1979‚Äì88. As a result, the Sino-Vietnamese conflict is generally not on the list of topics that may be openly mentioned in print or the media in present-day China, although veterans of the war are allowed to discuss their experiences on the Internet and correspond with their Vietnamese counterparts. On the other hand, a group of Chinese college students in 2007 discussed online plans for an invasion and conquest of Vietnam. This provoked considerable alarm in Hanoi, but the Chinese government stated that these were in no way officially sanctioned. After Ronald Reagan was elected US president in 1980, he gave a speech criticizing the Beijing government and proposing that diplomatic ties with Taiwan be restored. This aroused panic in China, and Reagan was convinced by his advisors to retract these statements. Vice President George H. W. Bush (who had been liaison officer to China from 1972‚Äì1978) then apologized for the president's remarks. Despite this, Sino-US relations took a downward turn in 1981‚Äì1982. The Chinese took umbrage at Reagan's vocal anti-communism, even though it was mainly directed at the Soviet Union, as well as continued US arms sales to Taiwan. In December 1981, Premier Zhao Ziyang visited North Korea where he attacked the US troop presence on the Korean peninsula and stated that it was responsible for the continued division of the country. There were various minor squabbles such as the granting of asylum to a prominent tennis player, Hu Na, who feared persecution for refusing to join the CCP. China cancelled several educational and cultural exchange programs with the United States as a result of this episode. The US invasion of Grenada and stationing of missiles in Western Europe met with Chinese disapproval, and the two countries took opposing sides on the Falkland Islands conflict, the Palestinian question, and the presence of American troops in South Korea. By 1984, Sino-US relations had improved and President Reagan visited Beijing in April‚ÄìMay of that year. The trip went well, although a speech made by Reagan that promoted capitalism, democracy, and religious freedom, as well as indirect criticism of the Soviet Union, was not aired on TV in China. In general however, China's foreign policy pronouncements were much more restrained than in the Mao era, and Beijing stated that its aim was now world peace rather than world revolution. Relations with the Soviet Union at last began to show some improvement and Foreign Minister Huang Hua led a delegation to Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev's funeral in November 1982. Huang met with his counterpart Andrei Gromyko and referred to Brezhnev as an \\"outstanding champion of world peace\\". He also expressed his hope for normalized Sino-Soviet relations, but in doing so apparently moved too quickly for the Beijing government, as he was removed from office almost as soon as he returned home (he had a history of making public statements that were at odds with official policy). On the state level, Sino-Soviet relations did improve during the 1980s. Trade and cultural exchanges grew substantially, but there was no indication of improved ties on the party level and no sign that the CCP was willing to treat the CPSU as an equal. Nagging foreign policy problems remained such as the presence of Soviet troops and nuclear missiles in Mongolia, as well as continued Soviet support for Vietnam and its occupation of Cambodia. =Economic Reform and Opening up= The new, pragmatic leadership emphasized economic development and renounced mass political movements. At the pivotal Third Plenum of the 11th CCP Congress, opened on 22 December 1978, the leadership adopted economic reform policies known as the Four Modernizations. These tenets aimed at expanding rural income and incentives, encouraging experiments in enterprise autonomy, reducing central planning, and establishing direct foreign investment in Mainland China. The Plenum also decided to accelerate the pace of legal reform, culminating in the passage of several new legal codes by the National People's Congress in June 1979. The goals of Deng's reforms were summed up by the Four Modernizations: the modernization of agriculture, industry, science and technology, as well as the military. The strategy for achieving these aims, all of which were designed to help China become a modern, industrial nation, was \\"socialism with Chinese characteristics\\". It opened a new era in Chinese history known as \\"Reforms and Opening up\\"() to the Outside World. The ten-year plan drafted by Hua Guofeng in 1978 was quickly abandoned on the grounds that China had neither the budget or the technical expertise to carry it out. Instead, a more modest five-year plan was adopted that emphasized light industry and consumer production. In September 1982, the 12th Party Congress convened in Beijing. The United States and the Soviet Union were again criticized for imperialism and reunification with Taiwan stressed. Most importantly, another new constitution was adopted in place of the 1978 document. This version (which remains China's constitution to the present day) emphasized foreign assistance in modernizing and developing the country, thus rejecting the Maoist self-reliance of the 1975 and 1978 constitutions. The last remaining references to the Cultural Revolution were also removed. Instead, the 1982 constitution stated that the \\"exploiter\\" class had been eliminated in China and so class struggle was no longer a relevant issue. Personality cults were also officially denounced at the 12th Congress. However, these changes were not managed without overcoming opposition in the party, bureaucracy, and military. There were still a few extremist followers of the Gang of Four, but not many and efforts were made to weed them from the party. There did exist a large number of Stalinists who believed in orthodox central planning, and socio-political conformity. This group generally wanted to return to the ways of the 1950s and restore ties with the Soviet Union, believing that the communist world was China's natural friend. In particular, many of the Stalinists thought that Deng Xiaoping was moving too far in dismantling Mao's legacy and allowing greater freedom of expression. The largest number of them were in the military, which complained about having its budget cut from 10% of China's total GDP in 1978 to 5% by 1982. Several weapons projects that had been in the works during the '70s were dropped due to being too expensive and unnecessary and generals also objected at being asked to produce consumer goods (a common practice in the Soviet Union) instead of receiving badly needed defense modernization. Deng stressed the need for military obedience to party directives, reminding them of Mao's dictum that \\"The party must control the gun, but the gun must never be allowed to control the party.\\" A higher degree of professionalism was emphasized in the PLA during the 1980s and the system of ranks that had been abolished in 1965 was slowly restored. On National Day (October 1) 1984, China staged its first military parade since 1959 to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. These parades had been held every year during the 1950s, then called off due to cost reasons. The 1984 event however showed the relative backwardness of China's armed forces, which had only recently reached the technological level of the Soviet Union 25 years earlier. In 1985, Yeh Jianyang and several other elderly party leaders agreed to retire. Deng argued that China was in the primary stage of socialism and that the duty of the party was to perfect \\"socialism with Chinese characteristics.\\" This interpretation of Chinese Marxism reduced the role of ideology in economic decision-making and emphasized policies that had been proven to be empirically effective, stressing the need to \\"seek truth from facts\\". Rejecting Mao's idealistic, communitarian values but not necessarily the values of Marx and Lenin, Deng emphasized that socialism did not mean shared poverty (thus repudiating the Gang of Four's slogan \\"We would rather be poor under socialism than rich under capitalism.\\") Unlike Hua Guofeng, Deng believed that no policy should be rejected out of hand simply because it had not been associated with Mao. Unlike more conservative leaders such as Chen Yun, Deng did not object to policies on the grounds that they were similar to those found in capitalist nations. He merely stated that these ideas were part of the common heritage of mankind and not specifically tied to either capitalism or socialism. Although Deng provided the theoretical background and the political support to allow economic reform to occur, few of the economic reforms that Deng introduced were originated by Deng himself. Local leaders, often in violation of central government directives introduced many reforms. If successful and promising, these reforms would be adopted by larger and larger areas, and ultimately introduced nationally. Many other reforms were influenced by the experiences of the East Asian Tigers. Among other things, it was now being admitted that Taiwan's per-capita GDP was three times that of the mainland. This is in sharp contrast to the economic restructuring, or perestroika, undertaken by Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, in which Gorbachev himself originated most of the major reforms. Many economists have argued that the bottom-up approach of Deng's reforms, in contrast to the top-down approach of Perestroika, was a key factor in his success. In a 1985 interview with Frank Gibney of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Deng remarked that the Soviet system suffered from an inflexibility and rigidness that did not affect China. Contrary to popular misconceptions, Deng's reforms included introduction of planned, centralized management of the macro-economy by technically proficient bureaucrats, abandoning Mao's mass campaign style of economic construction. However, unlike the Soviet model or China under Mao, this management was indirect, through market mechanisms, and much of it was modeled after economic planning and control mechanisms in Western nations. This trend did not impede the general move toward the market at the microeconomic level. Deng sustained Mao's legacy to the extent that he stressed the primacy of agricultural output and encouraged a significant decentralization of decision-making in the rural economy teams and individual peasant households. At the local level, material incentives rather than political appeals were to be used to motivate the labor force, including allowing peasants to earn extra income by selling the produce of their private plots on the free market. In the main move toward market allocation, local municipalities and provinces were allowed to invest in industries that they considered most profitable, which encouraged investment in light manufacturing. Thus, Deng's reforms shifted China's development strategy to emphasize light industry and export-led growth. Light industrial output was vital for a developing country that was working with relatively little capital. With its short gestation period, low capital requirements, and high foreign exchange export earnings, the revenues that the light- manufacturing sector generated could be reinvested in more technologically advanced production and further capital expenditures and investments. However, these investments were not government-mandated, in sharp contrast to the similar but much less successful reforms in Yugoslavia and Hungary. The capital invested in heavy industry largely came from the banking system, and most of that capital came from consumer deposits. One of the first items of the Deng reforms was to prevent reallocation of profits except through taxation or through the banking system; hence, the reallocation in more \\"advanced\\" industries was somewhat indirect. In short, Deng's reforms sparked an industrial revolution in China. These reforms were a reversal of the Maoist policy of autarky and economic self-reliance. The PRC decided to accelerate the modernization process by stepping up the volume of foreign trade, especially the purchase of machinery from Japan and the West. By participating in such export-led growth, the PRC was able to step up the Four Modernizations by taking advantage of foreign funds, markets, advanced technologies, and management experience. Deng also attracted foreign companies to a series of Special Economic Zones, where capitalist business practices were encouraged. Another important focus of the reforms was the need to improve labor productivity. New material incentives and bonus systems were introduced. Rural markets selling peasants' homegrown products and the surplus products of communes were revived. Not only did rural markets increase agricultural output, they stimulated industrial development as well. With peasants able to sell surplus agricultural yields on the open market, domestic consumption stimulated industrialization, and also created political support for more difficult economic reforms. Deng's market socialism, especially in its early stages, was in some ways parallel to Lenin's New Economic Policy and Bukharin's economic policies, in that they all foresaw a role for private entrepreneurs and markets based on trade and pricing rather than government mandates of production. An interesting anecdotal episode on this note is the first meeting between Deng and Armand Hammer. Deng pressed the industrialist and former investor in Lenin's Soviet Union for as much information on the NEP as possible. Concurrent with economic reforms, China began a major crackdown on crime in what became known as \\"Strike Hard\\" campaigns. These have been launched periodically up to the present day and are typically accompanied by the liberal use of capital punishment and occasionally even mass executions. This stands in contrast to the Mao era, where executions were relatively rare after the CCP's consolidation of power during 1950-52 and criminals were generally punished with labor reform and political reeducation. Tiananmen Square protests At the same time, political dissent as well as social problems, including inflation, political corruption, massive urban migration, and prostitution emerged. The 1980s saw a surge in intellectual material as the country emerged from the conformity of the Cultural Revolution; the time period between 1982‚Äì89 saw freedom of the press like never before, and has since then never been seen again. Two prominent schools of thought emerged. One school composed of students and intellectuals who urged greater economic and political reforms; the other, composed of revolutionary party elders, became increasingly skeptical on the pace and the ultimate goals of the reform program, as it deviated from the intended direction of the Communist Party. Hard-liners in the party and especially the military stated that \\"art and literature must serve politics\\", while moderates were willing to tolerate apolitical material. Nonetheless, writers and artists were still told that their primary job was to \\"educate the people to believe in socialism\\". As such, the party took a stand against certain Western ideas and philosophies, as well as abstract theories of human nature. Highly personal poetry and discussions of the subconscious were viewed as representing an \\"unhealthy\\" tendency. Officials also took a stand against pornography, which was being imported from Hong Kong in large quantities. This was coming at a time when many young people were skeptical of the party's leadership and increasingly questioning whether it was really possible to achieve socialism or if doing so was desirable. Nonetheless, the authorities tolerated Zhao Cuan's play Marx In London which was compatible with official viewpoints in that it presented the communist founding father as a mortal man who lived in a different age and whose theories could not provide the answers for all of China's present-day problems. On the other hand, the writer Liu Binyan, who had been in and out of favor since 1957, was criticized for his novel A Different Kind Of Loyalty which suggested that the Communist Party was not infallible, nor should it be followed without question. In late 1983, there appeared to be a brief revival of the Cultural Revolution when the \\"Anti Spiritual Pollution\\" campaign was launched. Pornography and unacceptable writings were confiscated, people with Western hairstyles were forced to cut their hair, and army units were required to sing \\"Socialism is Good\\", a venerable tune that had been banned during the CR for \\"keeping the people too quiet.\\" However, Deng Xiaoping rather quickly halted the campaign. During the 1980s, religious freedom was restored in China after having been virtually outlawed in 1966‚Äì1976. The state recognized five official faiths, Protestantism, Catholicism, Islam, Buddhism, and Taoism. Houses of worship were permitted to operate with a license and under the condition that they not oppose the party and socialism. This religious settlement remains in China to the present day. In December 1986, student demonstrators, taking advantage of the loosening political atmosphere, staged protests against the slow pace of reform, confirming party elders' fears that the current reform program was leading to a kind of social instability, the same kind that killed hundreds of millions between the years of the Opium War and the founding of the PRC. Inspired by Fang Lizhi, a physicist from the University of Science and Technology of China who gave speeches criticizing Deng's go slow policies, students took to protest. The students were also disenchanted with the amount of control the government exerted, citing compulsory calisthenics and not being allowed to dance at rock concerts. Students called for campus elections, the chance to study abroad, and greater availability of western pop culture. Hu Yaobang, a prot√©g√© of Deng and a leading advocate of reform, was blamed for the protests and forced to resign as the CPC General Secretary in January 1987. In the \\"Anti Bourgeois Liberalization Campaign\\", Hu would be further denounced. Premier Zhao Ziyang was made General Secretary and Li Peng, a staunch conservative who was unpopular with the masses, formerly Vice Premier and Minister of Electric Power and Water Conservancy, was made Premier. At the 13th Party Congress of the CCP in October‚ÄìNovember 1987, Deng Xiaoping and remaining Party elders formally stepped down from power. This included a number of hard-liner Maoists who had resisted Deng's policies, including Chen Yun and Li Xiannan. The new leadership of the Central Committee averaged 5.5 years younger, and more than 70% were college educated. However, even with the retirement of the aged Long March veterans, they still retained considerable political pull behind the scenes, and one complaint of the student demonstrators in 1989 was the continued political influence exerted by party officials who were supposed to be retired. It was speculated that the appointment of Li Peng, a known political hardliner, as premier was a concession to Deng Xiaoping's opponents. The major policy declaration of the 13th Congress was formal endorsement of \\"market\\" socialism and that it was necessary to \\"adapt the principles of socialism to fit reality rather than bend reality to fit ideology.\\" As a further move away from the past, in 1988 the party decided that portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin would no longer be displayed in Tiananmen Square on national holidays, only portraits of Mao and Sun Yat-sen. After Zhao became the party General Secretary, the economic and political reforms he had championed came under increasing attack from his colleagues. His proposal in May 1988 to accelerate price reform led to widespread popular complaints about rampant inflation and gave opponents of rapid reform the opening to call for greater centralization of economic controls and stricter prohibitions against Western influence. This precipitated a political debate, which grew more heated through the winter of 1988-1989\\\\. With demands for political reforms growing, Deng Xiaoping merely reiterated that the Communist Party was necessary to provide stable leadership and economic development and that \\"China is not ready for democracy. If we were to hold elections tomorrow, the country would be plunged into a civil war.\\" The death of Hu Yaobang on April 15, 1989, coupled with growing economic hardship caused by high inflation and other social factors, provided the backdrop for a large-scale protest movement by students, intellectuals, and other parts of a disaffected urban population. University students and other citizens in Beijing camped out at Tiananmen Square to mourn Hu's death and to protest against those who would slow reform. Their protests, which grew despite government efforts to contain them, although not strictly anti-Government in nature, called for an end to official corruption and for the defense of freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Protests also spread through many other cities, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. On April 26, the central leadership, under Deng Xiaoping, issued the 4-26 Editorial on People's Daily, which was subsequently broadcast on national media, denouncing all recent actions of protest as a form of \\"turmoil\\" (). The editorial was the first in a series of events in an effort to contain the escalating protests through forceful measures. Thereafter, Deng's actions caused the presidency to have much greater power than originally intended. Various leaders sympathetic to the students, most notably Wan Li, then the NPC Chairman with a degree of constitutional powers to prevent full military action, were placed under house arrest after landing in Beijing. Wan's seclusion ensured that Premier Li Peng was able, in cooperation with Deng, then-head of the Central Military Commission, to use the office of the Premier to declare martial law in Beijing and order the military crackdown of the protests. This was in direct opposition to the wishes of the Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and other members of the Politburo Standing Committee. Martial law was declared on May 20, 1989. Late on June 3 and early on the morning of June 4, a date now synonymous with the movement in the Chinese language, military units were called from neighboring provinces and brought into Beijing. Armed force was used to clear demonstrators from the streets. Official PRC estimates place the number of deaths at between two and three hundred, whilst groups such as the Red Cross believe the number to be in the two to three thousand range. After the protests, the Chinese government faced hordes of criticism from foreign governments for the suppression of the protests, the government reined in remaining sources of dissent that were a threat to order and stability, detained large numbers of protesters, and required political re-education not only for students but also for insubordinate party cadre and government officials. Zhao Ziyang would be placed under house arrest until his death some 16 years later, and due to the subject still being largely taboo in China, Zhao has not yet been politically rehabilitated. One Child Policy In 1979, the Chinese government instituted a one child policy to try to control its rapidly increasing population. The government had already enacted an aggressive family planning policy and fertility rates were already dropping sharply. Simultaneously there were major market-oriented economic reforms, which launched very rapid growth and migration to cities, which also reduced fertility. The policy was highly controversial in rural areas (where children were an asset in farm work) and interfered with the strong demand for sons. It helped solve the problem of famine, but by 2010 was leading to a major demographic disaster, with too many old retired people supported by too few workers. China returned to a two-child policy in 2015. Controversies are ongoing.Thomas Scharping, \\"Abolishing the One-Child Policy: Stages, Issues and the Political Process.\\" Journal of Contemporary China 28.117 (2019): 327-347.Junsen Zhang, \\"The evolution of China's one-child policy and its effects on family outcomes.\\" Journal of Economic Perspectives 31.1 (2017): 141-60. online Notes References Further reading * Dittmer, Lowell. \\"China in 1981: Reform, Readjustment, Rectification.\\" Asian Survey 22.1 (1982): 33‚Äì46. online * Donnithorne, Audrey. \\"Prolonged Readjustment: Zhao Ziyang on Current Economic Policy.\\" Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs 8 (1982): 111‚Äì126. * Lam, Willy Wo-Lap.

The crackdown in 1989 led to great woes in China's reputation globally, and sanctions resulted. The situation, however, would eventually stabilize. Deng's idea of checks and balances in the political system also saw its demise with Jiang consolidating power in the party, state and military. The 1990s saw healthy economic development, but the closing of state-owned enterprises and increasing levels of corruption and unemployment, along with environmental challenges continued to plague China, as the country saw the rise to materialism, crime, and new-age spiritual-religious movements such as Falun Gong. The 1990s also saw the peaceful handover of Hong Kong and Macau to Chinese control under the formula of One Country, Two Systems. China also saw a new surge of nationalism when facing crises abroad. Recovery in the 1990s =Restoring economic stability and growth= The inflation trends of the years leading up to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 had subsided by the early 1990s, as Jiang Zemin and the new generation of leadership attempted to calm any economic influx. Political institutions have stabilized, owing to the institutionalized procedures of the Deng years and a generational shift from peasant revolutionaries to well-educated, professional technocrats. The majority of university graduates come from a sciences-oriented background, and many pursued life outside of China. For those who stayed, state-owned research firms and enterprises were a popular destination. In the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square protests, China became an international pariah and the next three years were grim. Hardliners took over the government and began reining in free enterprise. They also attempted to revive Maoist propaganda and ideological campaigns, but the public largely treated it with apathy. In practice, the changes of the last decade made it impossible to ever truly return to the ways of Mao's time. The CPC leadership was further embarrassed by the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe during 1989‚Äì1990, and especially by the fall of Romanian leader Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, as his fanatical regime was one they were certain would never fall. Despite retreating into its shell, China's government continued to state that it welcomed foreign business and investment. For all its weakness and unpopularity, the CPC nonetheless had no serious opposition, as most overseas dissident groups were divided, quarrelsome, and lacking a charismatic leader. In April 1990, Li Peng visited Moscow where he was faced with dozens of Soviet protesters denouncing him as a butcher. Li laid a wreath on Lenin's tomb, indicating his loyalty to a fading ideology. His ideas of reform did not extend beyond economic matters, and he flatly dismissed the idea that glasnost and perestroika were also applicable to China. The failure of the August 1991 coup in Moscow also upset Chinese leaders, although the PRC publicly stated that all events going on in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union were the internal affairs of those countries and it was not their business to criticize them. China also quickly granted diplomatic recognition to all newly independent ex-Soviet republics. Internal CCP discussions and documents however stated that the Soviets had made a colossal blunder by appointing Mikhail Gorbachev as CPSU general secretary and thus allowing the return of capitalism to the country. Further, the Chinese leadership maintained that the coup attempt fell apart due to an inability to keep the Soviet army adequately indoctrinated. As a result, political education and Marxist‚ÄìLeninist propaganda in the PLA was stepped up. Meanwhile, relations with the United States became extremely bad in the aftermath of Tiananmen Square, reaching their worst point since before President Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972. The US Congress in particular was eager to impose as many economic sanctions and cancellation of business, trade, and cultural exchanges as it could, although President George HW Bush (who had been liaison officer to China in the 1970s), continued to uphold an optimistic view of Sino-US relations and that the current situation was only a temporary bump in the road. He did however succeed in antagonizing Beijing by meeting with the exiled Dalai Lama in April 1991. Chinese suspicion of US intentions worsened and numerous accusations were made of Washington having embarked on a systematic campaign to undermine the socialist system, especially after Congress accused China of exporting goods made with prison labor and selling weapons to rogue regimes in the Middle East (as far back as 1987, Beijing had been accused of selling Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran). Sino-US military ties were also abruptly terminated in 1989 and all technology transfers and sales of US military equipment to China cancelled. During the Persian Gulf crisis in 1990‚Äì91, China condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but also criticized the UN intervention, stating that it was a local issue that should be resolved strictly by the Arab states.  Deng's Southern Tour  In the spring of 1992, Deng Xiaoping suddenly reappeared in public and embarked on a tour of southern China to restore faith in his reforms and stop the country's slide back into Maoism (on the trip, he criticized the CPC for its \\"continuing leftism\\"). The visit was not only Deng's last major public appearance, but also seen as a test for the direction of the new leadership. Deng's renewed push for a market-oriented economy received official sanction at the 14th Party Congress later in the year as a number of younger, reform-minded leaders began their rise to top positions. The congress also affirmed the position of Jiang Zemin, a former mayor of Shanghai, as the new \\"core of CPC leadership\\", paving the way of Jiang becoming the \\"Third-generation\\" leadership figure. Deng and his supporters argued that further reform was necessary to raise China's standard of living. After the visit, the Communist Party Politburo publicly issued an endorsement of Deng's policies of economic openness. Though not completely eschewing political reform, China has consistently placed overwhelming priority on the opening of its economy. Relations with the West also improved by 1993, after Deng reminded the CCP leadership that China did not have the technological or financial resources to confront the US or be a geopolitical player, that capitalism and democracy were currently in the ascendancy, and that there was no choice but to practice a passive foreign policy. Although another massive protest is unlikely in the near future, social instability due to economic conflicts has become a greater challenge for the third and fourth generation of leaders. Politically, however, Deng's experiment separating the governance of Party, Government and Military have proven to be a failed strategy under the current political system. During the recovery period, Jiang Zemin took the office of CPC General Secretary, President of the PRC, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, securing political stability, and centralizing power yet again. =Deng's legacy= Deng Xiaoping was one of only a few peasant revolutionaries to lead China, along with Mao Zedong and the founders of the Han and Ming dynasties. Deng's policies opened up the economy to foreign investment and market allocation within a socialist framework, and put into practice a daring and unprecedented system that allowed free enterprise and capitalist ideas to grow and compensate for each other under a single- party political system. Since his death, under Jiang's leadership, mainland China has sustained an average of 8% GDP growth annually, achieving one of the world's highest rates of per capita economic growth, and became the world's fastest growing major economy. Also as mentioned, due in part to \\"socialist\\" measures and price/currency controls, the inflation characteristic of the years leading up to the Tiananmen protests had subsided. Political institutions have stabilized, due to the institutionalization of procedure of the Deng years and a generational shift from peasant revolutionaries to well- educated, professional technocrats. At the beginning of the 1990s it seemed that social problems have eased as well, as China rapidly became a more modern and prosperous nation. According to journalist Jim Rohwer, for example, \\"the Dengist reforms of 1979-1994 brought about probably the biggest single improvement in human welfare anywhere at any time.\\" Deng's reforms lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Construction work in Shenzhen, considered a powerful symbol of Deng's reformist legacy The reforms, however, have left a number of issues, mainly in the social and political arena, unresolved. As a result of his market reforms, it became obvious by the mid-1990s that many state-owned enterprises (owned by the central government, unlike TVEs publicly owned at the local level) were unprofitable and needed to be shut down to prevent them from being a permanent and unsustainable drain on the economy. As the pace of urbanization continued to increase, urban unemployment became a serious problem, and urban housing shortages caused the rise of low-income slums in major urban centres like Shanghai and Guangzhou. Furthermore, by the mid-1990s most of the benefits of Deng's reforms, particularly in agriculture, had run their course; rural incomes had become stagnant, leaving Deng's successors in search of new means to boost economic growth in rural areas, or else risk a massive social implosion. Finally, Deng's policy of asserting the primacy of economic development, while maintaining the rule of the Communist Party, has raised questions about its legitimacy. Many observers both inside and outside of China question the degree to which a one-party system can indefinitely maintain control over an increasingly dynamic and prosperous Chinese society. Questions have also been raised about the amount of foreign enterprise within China, and the time it takes before the government will no longer be able to effectively control private enterprise to fit their standards. Deng Xiaoping died on February 19, 1997. His successor Jiang Zemin delivered an official eulogy to the late revolutionary and Long March veteran stating, \\"The Chinese people love Comrade Deng Xiaoping, thank Comrade Deng Xiaoping, mourn for Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and cherish the memory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping because he devoted his life- long energies to the Chinese people, performed immortal feats for the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation.\\" His ideology, Deng Xiaoping Theory, became an official \\"guiding ideology\\" in the national Constitution in the subsequent meeting of the National People's Congress.  Return of Hong Kong and Macau  Hong Kong was returned to PRC control after a 99-year-lease to Great Britain on July 1, 1997. The agreement reverting control had applied Deng's theory of One Country, Two Systems. Hong Kong was to maintain independence in all areas except for foreign affairs and defence, withholding any major changes for another fifty years. Macau reverted to Chinese control under a similar agreement with Portugal on December 20, 1999. The two former colonies kept separate legal systems. The return of the two colonies meant the installation of an unprecedented political system, and the legal matters involved thereof, especially those involving Hong Kong's Basic Law, became the subject of constant debate. The subject of the amount of control the Mainland has over the former colonies' political institutions had raised many questions both internally and abroad. Some debate ensued over the legitimacy of Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and the level of democracy in Hong Kong, as the colony is supposed to remain economically independent from the mainland for another fifty years. Hong Kong is also fighting against Shanghai to keep its status as the regional commercial hub. Third generation of leaders Jiang Zemin, the core of the \\"Third Generation\\" of Leadership Deng's health deteriorated in the years prior to his death in 1997. During that time, General secretary Jiang Zemin and other members of his generation gradually assumed control of the day-to-day functions of government. This \\"third generation\\" leadership governed collectively with Jiang at the \\"core\\". Jiang was initially seen as an unlikely candidate for the position of General Secretary, and was believed to be simply a power transition figure. In reality, however, Jiang's era saw the return to complete, centralized leadership by 1998, after ousting rival party leader Qiao Shi and firmly taking the positions of the CPC General secretary, the President, and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, becoming paramount leader of China's tripartite Party-State-Military functional structure. With support from Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, then General secretary and Premier respectively, the government enacted tough macroeconomic control measures. The PRC began expunging low-tech, duplicated projects and sectors and projects in transport, energy, agriculture and sectors, averting violent market fluctuations. Attention has focused on strengthening agriculture, still the economic base of the developing country and on continuing a moderately tight monetary policy. In March 1998, Jiang was re-elected President during the 9th National People's Congress. Premier Li Peng was constitutionally required to step down from that post. He was elected to the chairmanship of the National People's Congress. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji was nominated as premier of the State Council by President Jiang Zemin to replace Li and confirmed by the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) on March 17, 1998 at the First NPC Session. He was reelected Standing Committee member of Political Bureau of 15th CPC Central Committee in September 1997. Zhu was believed to be a tougher and more charismatic leader compared to the generally unpopular Li Peng. =Falun Gong= While the government under Jiang Zemin allowed further opening of the Chinese economy, a more liberal and materialistic environment gave way to the emergence of various schools of new-age social and religious thinking in what is known as Qigong fever. Falun Gong (Ê≥ïËΩÆÂäü lit. The Practice of the Wheel of Law) founded by Li Hongzhi in 1992, was one such qigong practice which holds some similar beliefs to Buddhism and Taoism. It was allowed to grow for a few years, under CPC supervision. After criticism of the qigong practices by academics and certain inner party elements began in 1999, Falun Gong practitioners initiated group appeals or letter writing to local party and government leadership to restrict what practitioners considered \\"unfair\\" media criticism. A newspaper article denouncing \\"teenagers practicing Qi Gong,\\" with some parts specifically targeting Falun Gong, in Tianjin in April triggered a series of events which eventually led to over 10,000 practitioners silently protesting outside the Beijing Zhongnanhai compound to call for the release of detained practitioners. Premier Zhu Rongji met with several Falun Gong representatives and agreed to a few, but not all their demands. Some political analysts have suggested that Jiang was using the situation to strengthen his own core of CPC leadership, while CPC supporters contend that Falun Gong's continual spread would result in unwanted political instability. On June 10, 1999 the government set up the \\"6-10 Office\\", an extra-constitutional organization in charge of the crackdown on \\"heterodox faiths\\", which included Falun Gong. China's state-controlled media vilified Falun Gong and denounced it as an unhealthy element in society. On 22 July, the PRC Ministry of Civil Affairs outlawed the Falun Dafa Research Society as an illegal organization \\"engaged in illegal activities, advocating superstition and spreading fallacies, hoodwinking people, inciting and creating disturbances, and jeopardizing social stability\\",Xinhua, China Bans Falun Gong, People's Daily, 22 July 1999 coinciding with a concerted media assault. State television's prime time Xinwen Lianbo that day was extended to three hours from half an hour. It and many provincial and municipal TV networks labeled Falun Gong as an \\"evil cult\\". Regular programming was changed in many cases for up to a week. On July 23, the People's Daily contained a full-page editorial attacking the movement.\\"Enhance Knowledge; See Clearly the Harm; Hold on to Policies; Maintain Stability\\", People's Daily, July 23, 1999 On July 22, 1999 Falun Gong's exiled founder Li Hongzhi published a statement in which he called on international governments, organizations, and people for support, claiming that Falun Gong was without any particular structure, had no political objectives, nor had ever been involved in any anti-government activities. Human rights organisations noted that Falun Gong and its supporters claim that since 1999, thousands of practitioners have been tortured, beaten, subjected to psychiatric abuses, put in forced labour camps, and that tens of thousands more have been imprisoned. Falun Gong practitioners, including western practitioners travelling to China to protest, have continued to appeal for an end to the persecution and legalisation of the practice. Practitioners inside China have continued to resist and oppose what they see as the state controlled media's propaganda campaigns against Falun Gong, but continue to be met with harassment, arrests, torture or worse, according to Falun Gong sources. =Economic development= Amidst maintaining political stability, Premier Zhu Rongji kept things on track in the difficult years of the late 1990s, maintaining mainland China's averaged growth at 9.7% a year over the two decades to 2000. The ability of the PRC to chart an effective course through the recent Asian Financial crisis, which crippled Southeast and East Asian economies (including that of Hong Kong and Taiwan), was also rather noteworthy. Part of the survival was owed to the state's overall control of the economy. Against the backdrop of the Asian financial crisis and the catastrophic 1998 Yangtze River Floods, mainland China's GDP still grew by 7.9% in the first nine months of 2002, beating the government's 7% target despite a global economic slowdown. Active state intervention to stimulate demand through wage increases in the public sector and other measures showed certain strengths in the Chinese economic system in times of hardship. Economic reforms have triggered internal migrations within China. Click on the image for more information. While foreign direct investment (FDI) worldwide halved in 2000, the flow of capital into mainland China rose 10%. As global firms scramble to avoid missing the China boom; FDI in China has risen 22.6% in 2002. While global trade stagnated, growing by one percent in 2002, mainland China's trade soared by 18% in the first nine months of 2002, with exports outstripping imports. Zhu tackled deep-seated structural problems which more conservative leaders were afraid of letting go. Uneven development was a major issue, as was the remaining state-owned enterprises. In addition, inefficient state firms and a banking system mired in bad loans and lost funds to foreign countries. Substantial disagreements over economic policy resulted in the party leadership, as the tensions focused on the pace of change. Zhu was long known to have been involved in a divisive relationship with President Jiang. The PRC leadership was also struggling to modernize and privatize State-owned enterprises (SOEs) without inducing massive urban unemployment. A generation of people that suffered due to the Cultural Revolution that lacked the proper education or applicable skills has found it increasingly difficult to find a stable place in the increasingly privatized workforce. As millions lost their jobs as state firms closed, Zhu demanded financial safety nets for unemployed workers. While mainland China will need 100 million new urban jobs in the next five years to absorb laid off workers and rural migrants; so far they have been achieving this aim due to high per capita GDP growth. Under the auspices of Zhu and Wen Jiabao, his top deputy and successor, the state has been alleviating unemployment while promoting efficiency by pumping tax revenues into the economy and maintaining consumer demand. Critics have charged that there is an oversupply of manufactured goods, driving down prices and profits while increasing the level of bad debt in the banking system. But demand for Chinese goods, domestically and abroad, is high enough to put those concerns to rest in the time being. Consumer spending is growing, boosted, in large part, due to longer workers' holidays. Zhu's right-hand man, then Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao oversaw regulations for the stock market, campaigned to develop poorer inland provinces to stem migration and regional resentment. Zhu and Wen have been setting tax limits for peasants to protect them from high levies by corrupt officials. Well respected by ordinary Chinese citizens, Zhu also holds the respect of Western political and business leaders, who found him reassuring and credit him with clinching China's market-opening World Trade Organization (WTO) deal, which has brought foreign capital pouring into the country. Zhu remained as Premier until the National People's Congress met in March 2003, when it approved his struggle to clinch trusted deputy Wen Jiabao as his successor. Like his fourth-generation colleague Hu Jintao, Wen's personal opinions are difficult to discern since he sticks very closely to his script. Unlike the frank strong-willed Zhu, Wen, who has earned a reputation as an equally competent manager, is known for his suppleness and discretion. Crises abroad The downturn in relations with the US during the 1990s was not totally related to the Tiananmen Square Massacre, but numerous other factors including the end of the Cold War which made Sino-US cooperation less important or useful. The transition to a de facto unipolar geopolitical landscape and US military actions around the globe, from the Persian Gulf to Haiti to the Balkans, were received with dismay by Beijing. In 1995‚Äì96, the old issue of Taiwan's political status returned to the forefront after having largely been swept under the rug during the years of amicable Sino-US relations in the 1970s-80s. Beijing was disturbed by the island's transition to a multiparty democracy in 1987 and after the fallout in relations with the US in the early 1990s, American arms sales to Taipei were stepped up. In a speech to the Central Military Commission in 1993, Premier Jiang Zemin spoke of China's primary strategic concern being the prevention of Taiwan from declaring political independence. During this time, China began a significant military modernization program and a move away from Maoist ideas of \\"people's war\\" with a vast, lightly armed infantry force. Although arms sales from the US had been ended in 1989, China found a new arms supplier in post-Soviet Russia, which was in rather desperate economic straits during the 1990s and was willing to sell armaments to nearly anyone willing to pay. The CCP during this time began conscious efforts to remove the PLA from direct involvement in high-level political decisions, and as of 2017, no PLA general has sat on the Central Committee since 1997. In 1998, the PLA was directed to abandon economic and business activities and focus strictly on defense matters. However, this edict proved less than effective as many army officers, enjoying lavish profits, simply continued business activities in a more surreptitious fashion. Corruption and selling of army posts to the highest bidder has continued to be endemic in the PLA. With Taiwanese presidential elections due up in 1996, Beijing began a significant arms buildup near the Taiwan Straits. The PLA conducted two major military exercises in July 1995 and March 1996, apparently to intimidate Taiwan into not electing a pro-independence president. In response, US president Bill Clinton dispatched the US 7th Fleet to the region in a major show of force. China abruptly pulled back. Aggressive posturing towards Taiwan ultimately proved self-defeating for Beijing since it sowed increased distrust with the US and China's neighbors. US-Japanese military ties were stepped up, and in 1997, Washington and Tokyo concluded a renewed \\"Guidelines for Defense Cooperation\\" pact. In 1999, Sino-US relations took another ugly downturn when NATO forces undergoing bombing operations in Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. Three Chinese journalists died in the bombing, and Beijing reacted harshly. Mass anti-US protests rocked the streets of Beijing in the largest public demonstrations to take place since the pro- democracy movement 10 years earlier. Despite US statements that the bombing was accidental, China did not accept this explanation, bitterly condemning the action and demanding a full apology. In an official statement, then-Vice- President Hu Jintao declared the action as \\"barbaric\\" and behind the basic principle of ignorant \\"American hegemony\\". In the same statement he raised traditional slogans regarding the strength of the Chinese people, to rally behind the government and Jiang's leadership a huge portion of the populace. As protests escalated, the Central Government began changing its tone in an attempt to calm the outpouring wave of nationalism. Further aggravating relations with the US in 1999 were accusations of Chinese espionage at the Los Alamos Nuclear Lab in New Mexico. Around the start of the 21st century, although China had a relatively healthy economy with increased foreign investment, it faced a more precarious position on the global scale. Human rights became the concern for many western governments, and most leaders of western powers mention the issue every time on an official state visit. Pro- Taiwan Independence forces of the Democratic Progressive Party won the elections in Taiwan for the first time, limiting talks of Chinese reunification. Li Teng-hui published his \\"Two Countries Statement\\", the first of its kind labeling Taiwan as an independent entity separate from China. Yet another clash with the United States occurred in April 2001 when a US spyplane collided with a Chinese jet fighter over the South China Sea, killing the Chinese pilot, whose remain was never recovered. The American EP-3E spyplane was forced to land on Hainan Island, after which Chinese authorities promptly detained the crew and confiscated the aircraft. After two weeks of negotiations, the crew were released. Three months later, China returned the plane to the US in pieces. Meanwhile, in July 2001, the PRC and Russia signed the 20-year Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, aimed at increasing Sino- Russian cooperation and mutual assistance in various areas, covering economic, military, diplomatic (including Taiwan), energy and ecological fronts. The move was seen as another step towards balancing out US dominance in global affairs. China and Russia had also agreed upon a complete border treaty between the two countries.

He was the youngest son of King Lot and Morgause, King Arthur's half-sister, thus making him Arthur's nephew, as well as brother to Gawain, Agravain, and Gaheris, and either a brother or half-brother of Mordred. Arthurian legend = In French literature = Gareth, as Guerrehet, first appears in the First Continuation of Chr√©tien de Troyes's Perceval ou le Conte du Graal, where he is the protagonist of the final episode as he avenges the death of a fairy king named Brangemuer, son of Guingamuer, by slaying the giant known as \\"Little Knight\\". Several of his adventures are narrated in the Vulgate Cycle (Lancelot-Grail). In the Vulgate Merlin, Gareth and his brothers defect from their father King Lot and take service with King Arthur, participating in the early battles against the Saxon invaders of Britain and in the war against the Frankish king Claudas on the continent. As the youngest and often most chivalrous of the Orkney princes, Gareth later prevents his brothers Gawain and Agravain from killing their other sibling Gaheris in revenge for the murder of their mother Morgause, condemns his brothers for their killing of Lamorak, and attempts to dissuade Agravain and Mordred from exposing Lancelot and Guinevere's affair. His death at the hands of Bors during Lancelot's rescue of Guinevere from being burned at the stake is related in the Mort Artu (Death of Arthur), the final volume of the Vulgate Cycle.Norris J. Lacy, ed. and trans., Lancelot-Grail: The Death of Arthur, Volume 7 of Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 2010, p. 69. . The Lancelot and the Mort Artu sections differ in their characterisation of Gareth: in the Lancelot, he is portrayed as Gawain's most cherished brother; in the Mort Artu, it is rather his older brother, Gaheris.Norris J. Lacy, ed., Lancelot-Grail: Lancelot Parts III and IV, pp. 393‚Äì4. = Le Morte d'Arthur = \\"'Lady,' replied Sir Beaumains, 'a knight is little worth who may not bear with a damsel.'\\" Lancelot Speed's illustration for James Thomas Knowles' The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights (1912) Gareth is the subject of Book IV (Caxton VII) in Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, \\"The Tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney\\", which tells how he became a knight. In Malory's retelling of an episode from the Prose Tristan, Gareth seeks to prove himself worthy of knighthood through his deeds instead of just his lineage. For this reason, he arrives at Camelot in disguise as a kitchen boy as le bel inconnu, or the Fair Unknown, who comes without a name and therefore without a past. He is set to work by Sir Kay, who always gives him difficult work, teases him as a lowly kitchen boy and nicknames him \\"Beaumains\\" or \\"Good Hands\\" (alternatively \\"Beautiful Hands\\" or \\"Fair Hands\\"). Gareth receives much better attention from Sir Lancelot, who gives him gifts of clothes and gold for spending money. Arthur Hughes (c. 1894‚Äì1908) Gareth then goes to the aid of an unknown woman, later revealed to be the Dame Lynette, to save her sister Lyonesse (both also appearing under various alternate spellings) from the Red Knight of the Red Lands. He is accompanied by the dwarf Melot, who knows his true identity. However, Lynette takes Gareth as a mere kitchen boy and constantly derides him. On the way, he slays the impressive Sir Perarde, the Black Knight, and takes his armour and horse. He then meets Sir Pertolope, the Green Knight, who mistakes him for his brother, the Black Knight. Lynette tells the Green Knight that he is a kitchen boy and begs him to rid her of him. Gareth overcomes the Green Knight, but spares his life in return for the knight's swearing to serve King Arthur. He then in much the same fashion defeats Sir Perymones, the Puce Knight (sometimes the Red Knight, but not to be confused with the one of the Red Lands), and Sir Persaunte (Persant of Inde), the Indigo Knight, both of whom also swear loyalty to Arthur. He arrives at Lyonesse's castle, where she is besieged by Sir Ironside, the Red Knight of the Red Lands. He fights him all day and finally prevails, although the Red Knight has the strength of seven men. He intends to kill him as he himself had slaughtered all the other knights who came to save the lady Lyonesse, but the Red Knight explains that he did so because the lady he loved made him swear to kill Lancelot, and the only way to get his attention was to kill the knights. Gareth spares him, making him swear to serve Arthur and also go to Camelot and apologise to Lancelot. Lustily in love with Lyonesse, Gareth conspires to consummate their relationship before marrying. Only by the magical intervention of Lynette is their tryst unsuccessful, thus preserving Gareth's virginity and, presumably, his standing with God. Gareth later counsels Lyonesse to report to King Arthur and pretend she does not know where he is; instead, he tells her to announce a tournament of his knights against the Round Table. This allows Gareth to disguise himself and win honour by defeating his brother knights. The heralds eventually acknowledge that he is Sir Gareth right as he strikes down Sir Gawain, his brother. In Book IV, there are only two knights that have ever successfully held against Lancelot: Sir Tristan and Gareth. This was always under conditions where one or both parties were unknown by the other, for these knights loved each other \\"passingly well\\". Gareth was knighted by Lancelot himself when he took upon him the adventure on behalf of Lynette. However, in Book XVIII (Chapter VIII): \\"The Death of Arthur\\", the unarmed Gareth and his brother Gaheris are killed accidentally by Lancelot during the rescue of Guinevere. This leads to the final tragedy of Arthur's Round Table; Gawain refuses to allow King Arthur to accept Lancelot's sincere apology for the deaths of his two brothers. Lancelot genuinely mourns the death of Gareth, whom he loved closely like a son or younger brother. King Arthur is forced by Gawain and Mordred's insistence to go to war against Lancelot. Mordred's grief is largely faked, driven by his desire to become king. This leads to the splitting of the Round Table, Mordred's treachery in trying to seize Guinevere and the throne, Gawain's death from an old unhealed wound, and finally, Arthur and Mordred slaying each other in the final battle. Modern versions The legend of Gareth and Lynette has been reinterpreted by many writers and poets, the most renowned being Alfred Lord Tennyson in Idylls of the King (1859‚Äì1888). In this version the \\"colored\\" knights are replaced by knights associated with various times of day: the final knight is known as Night or Death and is the most feared of the three, though ultimately the weakest. Gareth marries Lynette. In some other versions, Gareth marries Lynette's sister, whom he rescues, and Gaheris marries Lynette. Theodore Goodridge Roberts authored the short story \\"For to Achieve Your Adventure\\", in which Lynette knows she is sending Gareth into an ambush in an attempt to make him give up for his own protection. * In the film Knights of the Round Table (1953), he was played by Anthony Forwood. * Richard Thorp played him in the British film Lancelot and Guinevere (1963). * Vera Chapman's novel The King's Damosel (1976) gives a complete version of Lynette's life. * Gareth was portrayed by Jonathan Cake in the film First Knight (1995). * In the novel Queen of Camelot (2002) by Nancy McKenzie, Gareth and Lynette formal became betrothed when he first came to Arthur. * In the mobile game Fate Grand Order, Gareth is depicted as a female knight, while keeping much of the legend's original family traits and story.

In 2010, China became the world's second largest economy by GDP. At the same time, numerous social problems emerged and intensified. As Paramount leader Jiang Zemin, NPCSC Chairman Li Peng and PRC Premier Zhu Rongji, gradually retired from their position of power, \\"fourth-generation\\" leaders, led by CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, faced with increasing social unrest, attempted to steer the country towards a new direction. From the path of focusing solely on economic development, Hu and Wen placed focus on creating an overall balance under the idea of the Scientific Outlook on Development to create a socialist harmonious society. In this process, there was an unprecedented shift in stance towards favouring rural development and farmers, as well as other generally populist policies. The Hu-Wen government, on the same token, attempted to restrict some personal freedoms, especially those associated with political content on the Internet. China's increased prominence on the global stage has also brought with it general skepticism and intense scrutiny, especially in the lead up to the 2008 Summer Olympics and after the March 2008 protests in Tibet. The government continues to be criticized on human rights abuses and the various product quality scandals that have increasingly damaged the country's integrity and continues to raise suspicions about the country's safety standards. Others, however, point to the immense progress the country has made and generally discredit criticisms of China as being embedded in cultural and historical misunderstandings and rooted in paranoia of China's potential dominance on the world stage. These ideological clashes, fused with rhetoric from Beijing, has led to an intense wave of nationalism (or Socialist patriotism) surfacing in Chinese populations around the world. As of mid-2012, government statistics show that for the first time ever over 50% of the Chinese population now live in urban areas, marking a milestone in the urbanization of China. The majority of modern city dwellers are migrants and their children who moved to cities during the economic boom of the last 30 years started by Deng Xiaoping's policy of economic liberalization. \\"Fourth Generation\\": The Hu-Wen administration =Power transition= Ever since the 1980s, Deng Xiaoping had promoted mandatory retirement ages for senior CCP officials, which was made official in 1998. In November 2002, at the 16th Communist Party of China National Congress, then-General Secretary Jiang Zemin stepped down from the powerful Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China to make way for a younger \\"fourth generation\\" of leadership led by Tsinghua engineering graduate Hu Jintao. Speculation remained, however, that Jiang would continue to wield significant influence. At the time, Jiang stacked newly expanded Politburo Standing Committee, China's foremost power organ, with three of his hardline allies: former Shanghai secretary Huang Ju, former Beijing party secretary Jia Qinglin, and Li Changchun to control propaganda. In addition, the new Vice-President, Zeng Qinghong, was also seen as a staunch Jiang ally, as he was part of Jiang's Shanghai clique. Also elevated during the Congress was Wen Jiabao, then Premier Zhu Rongji's right-hand man. Wen would become Premier in March 2003, and along with Hu, they were termed the Hu-Wen Administration. Both Hu and Wen's careers are remarkable in that they survived through the 1989 political crisis, which was attributed to their moderate views and careful attention not to offend or alienate older supporters. Hu Jintao is the first Party Committee Secretary to have joined the Communist Party after the Revolution over 50 years ago. In his 50s, Hu was the youngest member by far of the then seven-member Standing Committee. Wen Jiabao, a geology engineer who spent most of career in China's hinterlands, had never lost his political ground despite being a former ally to disgraced Party general secretary Zhao Ziyang. In November 2012, Hu Jintao retired as General Secretary and was succeeded by Xi Jinping, the nation's first paramount leader to be born after the foundation of the PRC. Xi initiated a series of large-scale anti-corruption drives, which however are believed to be secondary to removing his political opponents in the party, especially allies of Jiang Zemin's two sons. Jiang himself, despite being retired since 2004, is believed to still be manipulating politics behind the scenes. =Policy transition= Due to the large number of social, political, and economic imbalances left over from the Jiang era, Hu and Wen inherited a government nearly run-down from severe corruption and the immense rise in materialism. Because Jiang continued to wield influence, the direction of the Hu-Wen administration did not deviate from that of the Jiang-era for a few years after taking over power. Jiang, however, faced both popular pressure and significant inner party and military opposition, and stepped down as the Central Military Commission Chairman in September 2004. Although superficially, Hu and Wen continued to support Jiang era policies and hail his Three Represents theory, gradual changes were put in place to revert some of the worst excesses of the Jiang era. The changes had a much more egalitarian focus, concentrated on sectors of the Chinese population which have been left behind by the economic reform and closing the great wealth gap. Hu and Wen have both taken a number of high-profile trips to the poorer areas of China with the stated goal of understanding these areas better. The degree of difference between the Hu and Jiang administrations is subject to debate. Within the top leadership of the PRC, there still a general consensus that Chinese economic reform should continue. But because of the clear slant towards more capitalist elements under a one-party system, it has been contested that the government has an unclear ideological direction. The seriousness of China's internal problems is often masked by its high economic growth indicators and rapidly increasing foreign investment interest. Both Hu and Wen have given keynote addresses indicating the government's determination to deal with problems in a more logical, scientific way. =Media control= Chinese leaders understand that news media could be a very effective means to fight against corruption. Media controls were initially reduced, as market forces have encouraged tabloid reporting. Yet, the government occasionally fires reporters or shuts down newspapers that stray outside the party-line. The media reforms of Hu Jintao have been considered conservative by Western watchdogs. At the same time, Hu issued a directive for official party newspapers and media outlets such as Xinwen Lianbo to concentrate on more populist issues instead of constantly following the daily affairs of each of China's top leaders. The introduction of the Internet and SMS has increased the difficulty of attaining complete control, although general internet censorship involving sites such as Google and Wikipedia persist. Moreover, the news media from Hong Kong, protected by Basic Law, has become increasingly involved in news reporting in China, and have become increasingly accessible to a Mainland public hungry for \\"real news\\". = Protection of individual rights = The term \\"Weiquan movement\\" first appeared in the 1990s. The word w√©iqu√°n (Chinese characters: Á∂≠Ê¨ä) literally means \\"rights protection\\". As it implies, weiquan movement is not necessarily meant to protect specifically the political rights of the civilians. In fact, it was rather like a movement of consumers' rights protection at its early stage. It became more developed after 2003. The citizens began to protect their violated rights by means of organizing demonstrations, seeking help through the legal system and media reports, writing open or appeal letters, etc. However, because the legal system is not independent and mature, and the fact that the central government is sometimes suspicious and local governments even hostile toward it, weiquan movement has been encountering difficulties in the course of its development. There are cases in which lawyers were harassed, journalists beaten, and civilians imprisoned in weiquan movement. What makes weiquan movement more difficult is that in China there exists a system called \\"Re-education through labor\\" (Pinyin: l√°od√≤ng ji√†oyƒÉng or l√°oji√†o in short) (Chinese characters: Âä≥Âä®ÊïôÂÖª or Âä≥Êïô in short). It is a system in which a person can be detained for up to 4 years without being convicted by a court. This system is also used to deal with some weiquan movement activists. In spite of the difficulties, the weiquan movement still made some progress, such as the abolition of \\"custody and repatriation\\" in 2003. However, the pace of the progress is still very slow. =Hong Kong= Hong Kong's sovereignty was transferred to the People's Republic of China in 1997. Since then, the economy of the former British colony has progressed smoothly. There was ongoing debate about the amount of democracy under the new system. Notably, the central government ran into trouble with Hong Kong legal groups and citizens surrounding the territory's pseudo-constitution, the Hong Kong Basic Law, particularly Article 23, and democratic reform. Although the region enjoys a high degree of autonomy in all areas except for defence and foreign affairs, the Central Government in Beijing desired to keep appointment powers for the Hong Kong Chief Executive as well as part of the Hong Kong legislature. These continued powers led to unrest with certain segments of the Hong Kong population, who demanded direct elections for the Chief Executive and the legislature. Thousands of protesters took to the streets in a series of July 1 marches. =Taiwan= With Hong Kong and Macau reunited with the mainland the main outstanding issue is Taiwan. The strategy of the PRC government was to wait out the term of pro-Taiwan independence President Chen Shui-bian in hopes that the pro-Chinese reunification ticket of Lien Chan and James Soong would win the elections of 2004. Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan made an unprecedented visit to Beijing in 2005, shaking hands with Communist Party leader Hu Jintao, marking the first such Kuomintang-Communist meeting since the end of the Chinese Civil War. Chen Shui-bian and his pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party was reelected in 2004, impeding possible reunification progress. Though Chen will unlikely pledge to the One-China policy to begin negotiations, he has pledged the Four Noes and One Without, which quells any armed conflict in the near future. At the same time, Chen has gone step by step with actions provoking Beijing, trying to gradually create a separate Taiwan identity. In 2008, tourism slightly opened between Taiwan and the mainland. = Tibet = The Chinese government and the 14th Dalai Lama have been in contact since 1978, at the behest of the reformist Deng Xiaoping, and have held several secret or formal talks since 1982. The main points of contention are the Dalai Lama's want for a Greater Tibet, or to unite the Tibet Autonomous Region with Chinese territory that has not been a part of political Tibet in modern times, and the Dalai Lama's insistence that Tibet should be run \\"like a western-style democracy\\" instead of by the Communist Party of China. In response to the Chinese government's rejection of these demands, the Dalai Lama has traveled all over the world persuading foreign governments to demand China accept these terms. As a result of this pressure and the apparent failure of liberal reforms in Tibet to quell separatist sentiment, hardliners within the Chinese government gained in power. Tibetan nationalists felt, then, that they must escalate with violent opposition in Tibet \\"to prevent China from doing business as usual\\". After a period of relatively peaceful time since the demonstrations in 1989, the 2008 Tibetan unrest indeed provoked an international reaction against China. Issues =SARS, Neo-SARS and other disasters= In November 2002, the SARS outbreak began in Guangdong. To stop panic and avoid possible economic damage, and to preserve face and public confidence, local officials applied tight media control. The central Government was knowingly ignorant of the media control. The international community was misinformed about the existence of the virus. Finally in April 2003 the government admitted to the full scale of ‚Äòatypical pneumonia‚Äô cases infected with SARS, two months after the disease had rapidly spread across the world with initial infections in Hong Kong and Vietnam sourced to Guangdong. After intense international pressure, PRC officials allowed international officials to investigate the situation. In late April, major revelations came to light as the PRC government admitted to underreporting the number of cases due to the problems inherent in the health care system. A number of PRC officials were fired from their posts, including the health minister Zhang Wenkang and the mayor of Beijing Meng Xuenong (a Jiang and Hu supporter, respectively), and systems were set up to improve reporting and control in the SARS crisis. The PRC government delivered an official apology. General Secretary Hu Jintao promised a total disclosure of SARS data and permitted WHO experts to examine the SARS cases. Finally, in July 2003, the WHO declared SARS contained, but warned the disease could emerge again during the next winter. By then the disease had already made its way around the world.Sara E. Davies, \\"Duty in the time of epidemics: What China and Zimbabwe teach us.\\" Australian Journal of International Affairs 66.4 (2012): 413-430. Just as the nation was emerging out of the SARS crisis, A new dangerous epidemic suddenly appeared the avian flu outbreak. Beijing has maintained a strict and transparent policy to gain back a reputation damaged heavily during the SARS outbreak. In October 2005, Premier Wen Jiabao issued a nationwide directive to heavily prosecute the officials who attempted to hide Avian Flu cases. Chinese society was woken up by a series of disasters and accidents, especially SARS in 2003, followed by the explosion of avian flu and the chemical spill in the Songhua River in 2005. The last disaster finally led to a national risk management system equipped with a full range of emergency responses.Lei Zhang, and Lijin Zhong, \\"Integrating and prioritizing environmental risks in China's risk management discourse.\\" Journal of contemporary China 19.63 (2010): 119-136. In December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus later identified SARS- CoV-2, broke out in Wuhan, Hubei then spread to other provinces of China and many other countries. =Anti-corruption efforts= Chinese society depended heavily on personal relationships, which, combined with the new lust for wealth, produced escalating corruption. Historian Keith Schoppa says that bribery was only one of the tools of corruption, which also included, \\"embezzlement, nepotism, smuggling, extortion, cronyism, kickbacks, deception, fraud, squandering public monies, illegal business transactions, stock manipulation and real estate fraud.\\" Given the repeated anti-corruption campaigns it was a prudent precaution to move as much of the fraudulent money as possible overseas.R. Keith Schoppa, Revolution and Its Past: Identities and Change in Modern Chinese History (3rd ed. 2020) p . 383. Top leaders such as General Secretary Jiang Zemin warned that corruption could threaten the party's ongoing existence. Corruption has been a major area of focus in the Hu-Wen Administration, although the effectiveness of anti-corruption measures has been disputed. Although it has been argued that corruption is the inevitable result of China's social customs and the complicated nature of social relationships (see guanxi) in the country, it is reasonable to believe that one-party rule and the current political system is, at least in part, exacerbating the problem. In 2008 the head of the university center on corruption estimated that 10,000 corrupt officials fled China with up to $100 billion in public funds in the last decade.The Americana Annual 2009: An encyclopedia of the events of 2008 (2009) p 121 Xu Caihou provided a classic case of high-level corruption.For other cases see He served as a high military official in once sat on the Politburo. He died of cancer in 2015 as investigations into his embezzlements and bribes began. His home contained enormous amounts of gold, jewelry, cash, and other luxury items requiring several trucks to haul away. He kept a long list of clients who had received undeserved military promotions through bribery and payoffs.http://www.businessinsider.com/general-xu-caihou-guilty-for- corruption-2015-1 Opinion polls continually show that corruption (in all sectors of society) is the main complaint of the people. Currently, hospitals, schools, police, and social and legal institutions are constantly affected by bribery, cronyism, and nepotism. However, the Communist Party of China still asserts a monopoly on exposing corrupt officials and businessmen, and critics accuse the party of selective punishment. Analysts say the authorities are reluctant to pursue senior figures and their allies and punishment comes in the form of political purges rather than genuine law enforcement.Jiangnan Zhu, Jie Lu, and Tianjian Shi, \\"When grapevine news meets mass media: Different information sources and popular perceptions of government corruption in mainland China.\\" Comparative Political Studies 46.8 (2013): 920-946. After 2012, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping made corruption a high priority target, including the removal of many high officials. In the process he greatly and increased his own powers and ability to undermine political opponents.Ling Li, \\"Politics of Anticorruption in China: Paradigm change of the party‚Äôs disciplinary regime 2012‚Äì2017.\\" Journal of Contemporary China 28.115 (2019): 47-63. Online =Removal of Xi's term limits= In March 2018, the party-controlled National People's Congress passed a set of constitutional amendments including removal of term limits for the president and vice president, the creation of a National Supervisory Commission, as well as enhancing the central role of the Communist Party. On 17 March 2018, the Chinese legislature reappointed Xi Jinping as president, now without term limits. According to the Financial Times, Xi expressed his views of constitutional amendment at meetings with Chinese officials and foreign dignitaries. Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align two more powerful posts‚ÄîGeneral Secretary of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC)‚Äîwhich have no term limits. However, Xi did not say whether he intended to serve as party general secretary, CMC chairman and state president, for three or more terms. Foreign policy Hu Jintao's serious public image led China to a more staunch stance on global affairs compared to the Jiang era. Partly attributed to the United States' attention being focused towards problem regions such as Iraq, China has made advances in foreign affairs without much restriction from the U.S. in the 21st century. Military modernization and increased defense spending, as well as industrial and military espionage and accusations of cyber-hacking, have caused increased concern over Chinese intentions since 2000. However, the PLA's modernization efforts have continued to be hamstrung by corruption, outdated military equipment, and continued emphasis on political indoctrination over practical military skills.http://www.businessinsider.com/r-chinese-militarys-ability-to-wage-war- eroded-by-graft-its-generals-warn-2014-18 Since taking power in 2012, General Secretary Xi Jinping has conducted a series of purges of corrupt PLA generals, including Gu Junshan and Xu Caihou, who were accused of embezzling enormous sums of money. However, China observers have noted that many of these purges were motivated by politics as much as a desire to eliminate corruption, as most of the victims were army officers who supported Xi Jinping's political rivals. Gu Junshan, who had served as Deputy Logistics Chief for the PLA, was charged with embezzlement, bribery, misuse of state funds and abuse of power, and expelled from all his posts and the party. He received a suspended death sentence. Enormous quantities of gold, jewelry, and fine furniture were confiscated from his home in Henan, and it was reported that 20 large trucks had to be used to haul all of it.http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies- politics/article/1848264/chinas-disgraced-pla-general-gu-junshan-given- suspended = North Korea = Recognized as the world's next superpower, Hu's government was eager to demonstrate China's position of relative influence. China was the mediating nation in the Six-party talks, in an attempt to calm threats from North Korea's nuclear program. Being the sole remaining powerful ally of North Korea, China continued to supply the rogue state with food and oil, as well as financial aid. North Korea's nuclear test in October 2006 came as a major embarrassment to the Chinese government's policies, and marked the beginning to an eventual split between China and Kim Jong-il's regime, who was unwilling to pursue a road of economic reform and opening up. In October 2006, there was evidence to suggest that China had cut off certain supplies, including food and oil, to North Korea. Kim Jong-il showed a less cordial attitude towards China, but had no option but to comply should China continue trade sanctions. = African nations = China has also taken an increasingly prominent role in Africa. President Hu went on a 7-nation African visit in January 2007, solidifying deals and promising financial aid with African leaders with no conditions attached, winning the support, albeit with some caution, of many African leaders. = Shanghai Cooperation Organisation = In 1996 the Shanghai Five grouping was created, comprising China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan. When Uzbekistan joined the group in 2001 it was renamed to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). The SCO states its goals are \\"the strengthening mutual confidence and good-neighbourly relations among the member countries; promoting their effective cooperation in politics, trade and economy, science and technology, culture as well as education, energy, transportation, tourism, environmental protection and other fields; making joint efforts to maintain and ensure peace, security and stability in the region, to move towards the establishment of a new, democratic, just and rational political and economic international order.\\"Brief introduction to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation SCO Website Western analysts note that the SCO may serve as a balance against US and NATO advancement in the region. Some have even called it a new Warsaw Pact.SCO: means new Warsaw Pact? Russia: Beyond the HeadlinesPutin praises strength of 'Warsaw Pact 2' Telegraph Online SCO leaders, however, insist that the organization is not an alliance directed against any other states.Moscow Moves To Raise Profile in Central Asia The Jamestown Foundation = Taiwan issue = As usual, China and world governments still adhere to the one-China policy. Since the 1990s, the number of countries which have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan remains in the twenties, and Taiwan has been trying to buy diplomatic recognition from more countries by so-called \\"money diplomacy\\". Having become economically stronger, China is emulating Taiwan's \\"money diplomacy\\", and persuading those countries to cut diplomatic relations with Taiwan and to sway to China's side. Promising financial help, buying over high government officials, and even getting involved in election campaigns in those countries have become part of their \\"money diplomacy\\".  Culture  There appeared some changes in various cultural aspects in China. New movements and trends (influenced by western society such as high brand clothing, street dancing, etc.) have appeared in the society, and the newly forged and ever expanding middle class has the opportunity to have a different life style which few of the former generations had access to. This includes studying abroad, finding new jobs in large cities and purchasing luxury goods. However these opportunities are still only limited to the urban city dwellers in China. =Nationalism= Although Marxist‚ÄìLeninist-Maoist Thought has remained the guiding principle of the Chinese state, communist ideology became increasingly sidelined after the 1980s and the PRC's main justification for its continued existence is the notion that multiparty democracy is inefficient and cannot rapidly modernize the nation. Nonetheless, small, but vocal groups of diehard communists have remained, including Chongqing Party Secretary Bo Xilai. Bo Xilai, the son of Bo Yibo, one of the legendary \\"Eight Elders\\" of the CCP, rose from mayor of Dalian to party secretary of Chongqing by 2007. A one-time Red Guard and advocate of Maoist nostalgia, Bo actively promoted a revival of old-fashioned socialist ideals and campaigns, as well as merciless \\"Strike Hard\\" offensives against organized crime. He gained considerable support among the poorer and less advantaged in the inland city, but Maoist revivalism was not well-received by many, nor was his use of ruthless, ham- fisted tactics. The mainstream CCP leadership, wary of anything reminiscent of a return to Cultural Revolution-era chaos, decided to act against Bo, and in 2012, he and his wife were tried on corruption and embezzlement charges. Ultimately, he was stripped of all his positions and expelled from the party. The episode exposed an ugly power struggle within the CCP, and was thought to be connected with the upcoming leadership transition from Hu Jintao to Xi Jinping. Remaining challenges =Population= The leaders of the PRC now face a daunting task of pushing ahead with major economic reforms while managing its vast population of 1.3 billion people. The recent economic reforms have undermined the socialist state's safety net and forced people to look to the private sector for work and services. As the economy faces structural changes, 25 to 30 million state workers have been laid off since 1998 while only 8 million jobs are created annually at the current growth rate. With millions of laid off workers roaming the cities, keeping social order will prove a difficult task. Workers' protests have not been too infrequent, with the government usually heeding to the protestors' demands, while arresting their leaders. Another potential crisis is the advent of AIDS, which by UN estimates, could reach 10 million cases in 2010. In the Henan province, where perhaps hundreds of thousands of people have been infected with HIV by selling their blood, the government is only beginning to pay attention to the problem. Public awareness and widespread acknowledgement has yet to come. While there have been major economic reforms, the government has been slow on political reform, citing that social stability is vital for a developing economy. Few analysts believe the PRC will democratize quickly, but many see democratization as an inevitable end of the economic reforms. Many in mainland China see one-party rule as effective and any talk of political reform is meant to change the way the party governs, rather than remove it from power. In recent years, local elections with more candidates than positions available have become regular, yet talking about major changes at higher levels remains taboo. = Pollution = China's reliance on coal continue to damage its already compromised air quality. Some of its major cities are among the most polluted in the world. =Future prospects= Domestic issues require more attention from the central government than ever before. The growing number of public protests against corruption in China, along with the increasing wealth gap, require political action to stabilize the country. In addition, provincial-level authorities are separating themselves in policy development and implementation from guidelines laid out by the central government. Currently China's leaders have focused on economic means of resolving these problems. Whether they will attempt political reforms may decide how successfully China's internal problems can be resolved. The Olympics took place in Beijing in August 2008. Expo 2010 took place in Shanghai. To investors and firms, mainland China represents a vast market that has yet to be fully tapped. This point is best illustrated by the rapid growth of cell phone and Internet users in mainland China. Educationally, the PRC is forging ahead as partnerships and exchanges with foreign universities have helped create new research opportunities for its students. Human rights issues remain a concern among members of the world community and Chinese activists. Many countries hope for China to effectively deal with the challenges within the country, in order to ensure the prosperity of China. Furthermore, many countries have significant trade relations with China, so the 2015 Chinese stock market crash was seen as significant.

It may be used with metformin, a sulfonylurea, or insulin. Use is recommended together with exercise and diet. It is not recommended in type 1 diabetes. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headaches, muscle pains, inflammation of the throat, and swelling. Serious side effects may include bladder cancer, low blood sugar, heart failure, and osteoporosis. Use in not recommended in pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is in the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class and works by improving sensitivity of tissues to insulin. Pioglitazone was patented in 1985, and came into medical use in 1999. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS less than ¬£1 as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$3.20. In 2017, it was the 125th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than five million prescriptions. It was withdrawn in France and Germany in 2011. Medical uses Pioglitazone is used to lower blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes either alone or in combination with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin. While pioglitazone does decrease blood sugar levels, the main study that looked at the medication found no difference in the main cardiovascular outcomes that were looked at. The secondary outcome of death from all causes, myocardial infarction, and stroke were lower. Contraindications Pioglitazone cannot be used in patients with a known hypersensitivity to pioglitazone, other thiazolidinediones or any of components of its pharmaceutical forms. It is ineffective and possibly harmful in diabetes mellitus type 1 and diabetic ketoacidosis. Its safety in pregnancy, lactation (breastfeeding) and people under 18 is not established. Given previous experiences with the related drug troglitazone, acute diseases of the liver are regarded as a contraindication for pioglitazone. Pioglitazone and all other drugs of its class (thiazolidinediones) are absolutely contraindicated in patients with heart failure. Side effects A press release by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2007 noted that there is a greater incidence of fractures of the upper arms, hands and feet in female diabetics given rosiglitazone compared with those given metformin or glyburide. The information was based on data from the ADOPT trial. Following release of this statement, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, the developer of pioglitazone (sold as Actos in many markets) admitted that it has similar implications for female patients. The risk of hypoglycemia is low in the absence of other drugs that lower blood glucose. Pioglitazone can cause fluid retention and peripheral edema. As a result, it may precipitate congestive heart failure (which worsens with fluid overload in those at risk). It may cause anemia. Mild weight gain is common due to increase in subcutaneous adipose tissue. In studies, patients on pioglitazone had an increased proportion of upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, headache, myalgia and tooth problems. Chronic administration of the drug has led to occasional instances of cholestatic hepatitis, reversible upon drug discontinuation. On July 30, 2007 an Advisory Committee of the Food and Drug Administration concluded that the use of rosiglitazone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes was associated with a greater risk of \\"myocardial ischemic events\\" when compared to placebo, but when compared to other diabetes drugs, there was no increased risk. Pioglitazone is currently being reviewed. A meta-analysis released subsequently showed that pioglitazone reduced the risk of ischemic cardiac events rather than increased the risk, but increased CHF. =Bladder cancer= On June 9, 2011 the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products decided to withdraw pioglitazone due to high risk of bladder cancer. This suspension was based on the results of an epidemiological study conducted by the French National Health Insurance. According to the results of the epidemiological study, the French agency found that patients, who were taking Actos for a long time to aid in type 2 diabetes mellitus, significantly increased risk of bladder cancer compared with patients who were taking other diabetes medications. On June 10, 2011 Germany's Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices also advised doctors not to prescribe the medication until further investigation of the cancer risk had been conducted. On June 15, 2011 the U.S. FDA announced that pioglitazone use for more than one year may be associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, and two months later the label was updated with an additional warning about this risk. A 2017 meta- analysis of diabetes found no difference in the rates of bladder cancer attributed to the pioglitazone. Drug interactions Combination with sulfonylureas or insulin reciprocally exponentiate risk of hypoglycemia. Therapy with pioglitazone increase the chance of pregnancy in individuals taking oral contraception. Mechanism of action Pioglitazone selectively stimulates the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-Œ≥) and to a lesser extent PPAR-Œ±. It modulates the transcription of the genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism in the muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver. As a result, pioglitazone reduces insulin resistance in the liver and peripheral tissues, decreases gluconeogenesis in the liver, and reduces quantity of glucose and glycated hemoglobin in the bloodstream. More recently, pioglitazone and other active TZDs have been shown to bind to the outer mitochondrial membrane protein mitoNEET with affinity comparable to that of pioglitazone for PPARŒ≥. Society and culture In 2008 it generated the tenth-highest amount of money for a medication in the U.S. in 2008, with sales exceeding $2.4 billion. =Brand names= Pioglitazone is marketed as trademarks Actos in the United States, Canada, the UK and Germany, Glustin in Europe, Glizone and Pioz in India by Zydus Cadila and USV Limited, respectively and Zactos in Mexico by Takeda Pharmaceuticals. On August 17, 2012 the US FDA announced its approval of the first generic version of Actos.  Research  There is tentative research that suggests that pioglitazone may be useful for treating major depression. Because it is thought to reduce inflammatory activity in neuroglia, it was studied in a small clinical trial involving children with autism, under the autoimmune/inflammatory hypotheses of the causes of autism. Pioglitazone may improve symptoms of psoriasis.

At the time, Filo was both a photojournalism student at Kent State University, and staffer of the Valley Daily News, which became the Valley News Dispatch - now a satellite paper for the Greensburg Tribune-Review. Biography After winning the Pulitzer Prize while working for the Valley Daily News (a Gannett paper) of the Pittsburgh suburb of Tarentum, Pennsylvania, he continued his career in photojournalism, rapidly finding work at the Associated Press, the Philadelphia Inquirer, and as a picture editor at the Baltimore Evening Sun. He eventually rose to a picture editing job at the weekly news magazine Newsweek. He is now head of photography for CBS. Taking the picture Mary Ann Vecchio meeting John Filo at Kent State University, May 2009 The Kent State shooting by members of the Ohio National Guard occurred at Kent State University in the city of Kent, Ohio on May 4, 1970, and resulted in the deaths of four students. At the time John Filo was in the University student photography lab when the shots rang out. He quickly ran outside and below recalls what happened: To take the picture John used a Nikkormat camera with Tri-X film and most of the exposures were 1/500 between 5.6 and f 8 depending on whether the sun was behind a cloud or not. Altered photo In the early 1970s, an anonymous editor airbrushed the fence post above Mary Ann Vecchio's head out of Filo's Pulitzer Prize Winner photograph. Since then, the altered photo has circulated and has been reprinted in many magazines. Numerous publications, including Time (Nov. 6, 1972, p. 23; Jan. 7, 1980, p. 45) and People (May 2, 1977, p. 37; April 30, 1990, p. 117), have used the altered image without knowing it. Meeting with Mary Ann Vecchio In 1995, Filo met Mary Ann Vecchio for the first time, when both were scheduled to appear at an Emerson College conference commemorating the 25th anniversary of the shootings. The two met again on the Kent State University campus, at the 39th commemoration in May 2009, where they both spoke.

The city was of great strategic importance as the major Russian military center for southern Manchuria, and a major population center on the main line on the Russian South Manchurian Railway connecting Port Arthur with Mukden. The city was fortified by the Imperial Russian Army with three lines of fortifications.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, pp. 205‚Äì208. Background When the Imperial Japanese Army landed on the Liaodong Peninsula, Japanese General ≈åyama Iwao divided his forces. The IJA 3rd Army under Lieutenant General Nogi Maresuke was assigned to attack the Russian naval base at Port Arthur to the south, while the IJA 1st Army, IJA 2nd Army and IJA 4th Army would converge on the city of Liaoyang. Russian General Aleksey Kuropatkin planned to counter the Japanese advance with a series of planned withdrawals, intended to trade territory for the time necessary for enough reserves to arrive from Russia to give him a decisive numerical advantage over the Japanese. However, this strategy was not in favor with the Russian Viceroy Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev, who was pushing for a more aggressive stance and quick victory over Japan. Both sides viewed Liaoyang as a site suitable for a decisive battle which would decide the outcome of the war. Preparations At Liaoyang, Kuropatkin had a total of 14 divisions with 158,000 men, supported by 609 artillery pieces. He divided his forces into three groups. * The Eastern Group was commanded by General Alexandr von Bilderling and consisted of the 3rd Siberian Army Corps and the 10th European Army Corps. * The Southern Group was commanded by General Nikolai Zarubaev and consisted of the 1st Siberian Army Corps, 2nd Siberian Army Corps and 4th Siberian Army Corps, together with a total of 11 cavalry squadrons under Lieutenant General Pavel Mishchenko. * Kuropatkin kept a reserve of 30 battalions, mostly from the 17th Siberian Army Corps. His outermost defensive line extended approximately to the south of the ancient walled city. With the start of the rainy season in July, the muddy terrain favored the defenders.Jukes, The Russo-Japanese War 1904‚Äì1905, pp. 49‚Äì52. ≈åyama also divided his forces into three groups: * IJA 1st Army under General Kuroki Tamemoto, * IJA 2nd Army under General Oku Yasukata, * IJA 4th Army under General Nozu Michitsura. ≈åyama had a total of eight divisions with 120,000 men and 170 artillery pieces. The overall Japanese strategy, which had been developed by General Kodama Gentar≈ç, was to have the 2nd Army advance along the railway line, while the 1st Army converged upon the city via Motien Pass from the north. The 4th Army would be a reserve to be committed to the right of the 2nd Army towards the end of the battle. Due to a disparity in military intelligence, Kuropatkin was convinced that he was outnumbered, whereas ≈åyama, with the assistance of the local Chinese population, had precise knowledge of the Russian strength and deployment. However, ≈åyama was concerned with his numerical inferiority, and waited to attack in hopes that a quick victory at Port Arthur would enable him to add the strength of IJA 3rd Army to his forces before yet more Russian reinforcements arrived to the north. However, after three weeks without progress at Port Arthur, ≈åyama decided that he could wait no longer. Battle The battle began on 25 August with a Japanese artillery barrage, followed by the advance of the Japanese Imperial Guards Division under Lieutenant General Hasegawa Yoshimichi against the right flank of the 3rd Siberian Army Corps. The attack was defeated by the Russians under General Bilderling largely due to the superior weight of the Russian artillery and the Japanese took over a thousand casualties. On the night of 25 August, the IJA 2nd Division and IJA 12th Division under Major General Matsunaga Masatoshi engaged the 10th Siberian Army Corps to the east of Liaoyang. Fierce night fighting occurred around the slopes of a mountain called \\"Peikou\\", which fell to the Japanese by the evening of 26 August. Kuropatin ordered a retreat under the cover of heavy rain and fog, to the outermost defensive line surrounding Liaoyang, which he had reinforced with his reserves. Also on 26 August, the advance of the IJA 2nd Army and IJA 4th Army was stalled Russian General Zarubaev before the outmost defensive line to the south. However, on 27 August, much to the surprise of the Japanese and consternation of his commanders, Kuropatkin did not order a counterattack, but instead ordered that the outer defense perimeter be abandoned, and that all Russian forces should pull back to the second defensive line. This line was approximately south of Liaoyang, and included several small hills which had been heavily fortified, most notably a 210-meter tall hill known to the Russians as \\"Cairn Hill\\". The shorter lines were easier for the Russians to defend, but played into ≈åyama‚Äôs plans to encircle and destroy the Russian Manchurian Army. ≈åyama ordered Kuroki to the north, where he cut the railroad line and the Russian escape route, while Oku and Nozu were ordered to prepare for a direct frontal assault to the south. The next phase of the battle began on 30 August with a renewed Japanese offensive on all fronts. However, again due to superior artillery and their extensive fortifications, the Russians repulsed the attacks on 30 August and 31 August, causing considerable losses to the Japanese. Again to the consternation of his generals, Kuropatkin would not authorize a counter- attack. Kuropatkin continued to overestimate the size of the attacking forces, and would not agree to commit his reserve forces to the battle. On 1 September, the Japanese 2nd Army had taken Cairn Hill and approximately half of the Japanese 1st Army had crossed the Taitzu River about eight miles east of the Russian lines. Kuropatkin then decided to abandon his strong defensive line, and made an orderly retreat to the innermost of the three defensive lines surrounding Liaoyang. This enabled the Japanese forces to advance to a position where they were within range to shell the city, including its crucial railway station. This prompted Kuropatkin to at last authorize a counter- attack, with the aim of destroying the Japanese forces across the Taitzu River and securing a hill known to the Japanese as \\"Manjuyama\\", to the east of the city. Kuroki had only two complete divisions to the east of the city, and Kuropatkin decided to commit the entire 1st Siberian Army Corps and 10th Siberian Army Corps and thirteen battalions under Major General N. V. Orlov (the equivalent of five divisions) against him. However, the messenger sent by Kuropatkin with orders got lost, and Orlov‚Äôs outnumbered men panicked at the sight of the Japanese divisions. Meanwhile, the 1st Siberian Army Corps under General Georgii Stackelberg arrived on the afternoon of 2 September, exhausted by a long march through the mud and torrential rains. When Stackelberg asked General Mishchenko for assistance from two brigades of his Cossacks, Mishchenko claimed to have orders to go elsewhere and abandoned him. The night assault of Japanese forces on Manjuyama was initially successful, but in the confusion, three Russian regiments fired upon each other, and by morning the hill was back in Japanese hands. Meanwhile, on 3 September Kuropatkin received a report from General Zarubayev on the inner defensive line that he was running short on ammunition. This report was quickly followed by a report by Stackelberg that his troops were too tired to continue the counter-attack. When a report arrived that the Japanese First Army was poised to cut off Liaoyang from the north, Kuropatkin then decided to abandon the city, and to regroup at Mukden a further to the north. The retreat began on 3 September and was completed by 10 September. Aftermath After the Battle of Liaoyang: Injured Russians transported by the Red Cross (Angelo Agostini). Despite ≈åyama‚Äôs goal of encircling and annihilating the Russian forces in Manchuria at Liaoyang, Kuropatkin was able to retreat in good order as the exhausted Japanese were unable to pursue. On 7 September, Kuropatkin informed St Petersburg that he had won a great victory over the Japanese by avoiding encirclement and inflicting great losses. However, Russian War Minister Viktor Sakharov ridiculed the report. Celebrations in Tokyo were muted by the heavy casualty reports, and the knowledge that their victory was not complete as the decisive battle of the war would need to be fought elsewhere. Officially, 5,537 Japanese and 3,611 Russian were killed, and 18,063 Japanese and 14,301 Russian wounded. Soviet studies later asserted that the Russian armies suffered about 15,548 casualties (2007 killed 1448 missing, 12 093 wounded) against 23,615 total Japanese casualties Russia and USSR in Wars of the XX century - Moskow, Veche, 2010 - p.32 Gallery Russian forces were supported by observers in a variety of balloons, providing aerial monitoring of the unfolding battle.

By excluding ƒ∞zmir's metropolitan area, it is one of the prominent districts of the province in terms of population and is largely urbanized at the rate of 53.6%. Bergama center is situated at a distance of to the north from the point of departure of the traditional center of ƒ∞zmir (Konak Square in Konak, ƒ∞zmir) and lies at a distance of inland from the nearest seacoast at the town of Dikili to its west.

The district area's physical features are determined by the alluvial plain of Bakƒ±r√ßay River. Name The name Bergama, as well as its ancient predecessor Pergamon, are thought to be connected with the even more ancient Luwian language adjective \\"parrai\\" (Hittite language equivalent; \\"parku\\"), meaning \\"high\\" in the same vein as being the etymological root of a number of other ancient cities across Anatolia. The ancient and modern Greek language form of the name is . In Turkish language, it has been adapted to Bergama. The name of Pergamos derives from Perga (as keramos from kera=earth, clay), although a Turkish author √ñzhan √ñzt√ºrk claims that Bergama means \\"high settlement/base\\" in Hittite language (reference needed), while Argoma (modern Suluova) in Amasya means \\"border settlement\\" at the Hittite-Kaskian border.Hittite Parku \\"high\\" + huma(ti) ‚Äúbase/settlement\\" and Arguma erha ‚Äúborder\\" + huma(ti) ‚Äúbase/settlement\\" √ñzhan √ñzt√ºrk.

Located on a promontory north of the Bakƒ±r√ßay river, inland from the Aegean Sea, Bergama has a population of about 102,000. The ruins of the ancient city of Pergamon lie to the north and west of the modern city; Roman Pergamon is believed to have sustained a population of approximately 150,000 at its height in the 1st century AD. Among Bergama's notable ruins are the Sanctuary of Asclepius (or Asclepeion), a temple dedicated to an ancient Greek god of healing, a Greek Theater, and the Red Basilica complex (\\"Kƒ±zƒ±l Avlu\\" in Turkish) that straddles the Selinus River, a 2nd-century AD construction likely built by Hadrian. The town also features an archaeological museum.  History The Kingdom of Pergamon (colored olive) shown at its greatest extent in 188 BC. The city of Pergamon was the capital of the Attalid dynasty from 281 BC to 133 BC and then became part of the Roman province of Asia. It remained under Eastern Roman rule in the Middle Ages except for Sassanid invasion in 620s, Umayyad invasion in 715 and Sultanate of Rum rule between 1074 and 1097. It was conquered by Karasids in 1302. It was part of Ottoman Empire in 1337. During Ottoman rule, it was part of the Sanjak of Karesi between 1337 and 1868, in Saruhan one (Its centre was Manisa) between 1868 and 1877 and finally in ƒ∞zmir one. During the Turkish War of Independence, it was occupied by Greece on June 19, 1919, but came under Turkish control on September 14, 1922.

Allianoi Allianoi is an ancient spa settlement, with remains dating predominantly from the Roman Empire period (2nd century AD) located near the city of Bergama (ancient Pergamon) in Turkey's ƒ∞zmir Province. The site is at a distance of to the northeast of Bergama, on the road to the neighboring town of ƒ∞vrindi. One particularity of Allianoi is its being a very recent historical discovery. It was mentioned only once in the 2nd century by the orator and medicinal writer Aelius Aristides in his \\"Hieroi Logoi\\" (Sacred Tales) (III.1), one of the key sources for the knowledge on the science of healing as it was understood at that time. No other writer of antiquity nor any epigraphic finding known had referred to Allianoi. Kozak Plateau Country road in Kozak Plateau Kozak Plateau (Kozak Yaylasƒ±) is a high plain at an altitude varying between and starting at a distance of from Bergama center in the northern direction. The plain is a favorite regional excursion area, famed for its hand-made textile products and pine forests whose pine nut is also extensively exported. Ovacƒ±k gold mine Recently, Bergama also made headlines in the context of controversies based on environmental concerns over the gold mine in Ovacƒ±k village.Managing cyanide: health, safety and risk management practices at Turkey's Ovacik gold‚Äìsilver mine, Journal of Cleaner Production vol. 14, 8, 2\\"European Court of Human Rights judgment on the Bergama Mine in Turkey\\" Mines and Communities, published 01-05-2001, access on 31-03-2012  Wind turbine manufacturing  LM Wind Power, a division of GE Renewable Energy, opened a wind turbine blade manufacturing facility in Bergama in 2017. The first blades it produced were used at the Bodangora Wind Farm in New South Wales, Australia. Bergama Carpets Bergama Carpets Bergama is also renowned for its high quality carpets. There are approximately eighty villages that still weave Bergama carpets. The history of carpet weaving in Bergama dates back to the 11th century - when Turkish migration started to the area. Bergama carpets have almost always been woven with wool - an attestation to the pastoral life style of the Y√∂r√ºk clans populating the area at the time. Although the history of carpet weaving in Bergama dates back to the 11th century, most surviving carpets do not age more than 200 years - mainly due to their wool content. The oldest surviving Bergama carpets can be found in mosques in and around Bergama, as well as the archaeological museum in Bergama. Bergama Festival Between June 18‚Äì24, Bergama celebrates its annual festival \\"Bergama Kermesi\\", which is already running into its seventy-second anniversary.

He fought for the Union as a brigadier general during the American Civil War. Buford is best known for having played a major role in the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, by obtaining the 'high ground' while in command of a division. Buford graduated from West Point in 1848. Buford remained loyal to the United States when the Civil War broke out, despite having been born in the divided border state of Kentucky. During the war he fought against the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia as part of the Army of the Potomac. His first command was a cavalry brigade under Major General John Pope, and he distinguished himself at Second Bull Run in August 1862, where he was wounded, and also saw action at Antietam in September and Stoneman's Raid in spring 1863. Buford's cavalry division played a crucial role in the Gettysburg Campaign that summer. Arriving at the small town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on June 30 before the Confederate troops, Buford set up defensive positions. On the morning of July 1, Buford's division was attacked by a Confederate division under the command of Major General Henry Heth. His men held just long enough for Union reinforcements to arrive. After a massive three day battle, the Union troops emerged victorious. Later, Buford rendered valuable service to the Army, both in the pursuit of Robert E. Lee after the Battle of Gettysburg, and in the Bristoe Campaign that autumn, but his health started to fail, possibly from typhoid. Just before his death at age 37, he received a personal message from President Abraham Lincoln, promoting him to major general of volunteers in recognition of his tactical skill and leadership displayed on the first day of Gettysburg. Early years Buford was born in Woodford County, Kentucky, but was raised in Rock Island, Illinois, from the age of eight. His father was a prominent Democratic politician in Illinois and a political opponent of Abraham Lincoln. Buford was of English descent.Boatner. Encyclopedia. Marcus Bainbridge Buford. \\"The Buford Family in America,\\" 1903. His family had a long military tradition. John Jr.'s grandfather, Simeon Buford, served in the cavalry during the American Revolutionary War under Henry \\"Lighthorse\\" Lee, the father of Robert E. Lee. His great-uncle, Colonel Abraham Buford (of the Waxhaw Massacre), also served in a Virginia regiment. His half-brother, Napoleon Bonaparte Buford, would become a major general in the Union Army, while his cousin, Abraham Buford, would become a cavalry brigadier general in the Confederate States Army. After attending Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, for one year, Buford was accepted into the Class of 1848 at the United States Military Academy (West Point). Upperclassmen during Buford's time at West Point included Fitz-John Porter (Class of 1845), George B. McClellan (1846), Thomas J. Jackson (1846), George Pickett (1846), and two future commanders and friends, George Stoneman (1846) and Ambrose Burnside (1847). The Class of 1847 also included A.P. Hill and Henry Heth, two men Buford would face at Gettysburg on the morning of July 1, 1863. Buford graduated 16th of 38 cadets and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Dragoons, transferring the next year to the 2nd U.S. Dragoons.Eicher, Longest Night, p. 153. He served in Texas and against the Sioux, served on peacekeeping duty in Bleeding Kansas, and in the Utah War in 1858. He was stationed at Fort Crittenden, Utah, from 1859 to 1861.Bielakowski, p. 310; Longacre, pp. 69‚Äì73; Fort Crittenden was originally named Camp Floyd, but was renamed during his assignment there. He studied the works of General John Watts de Peyster, who urged that the skirmish line become the new line of battle.Hamersly, pp. 82‚Äì88. Civil War Throughout 1860, Buford and his fellow soldiers had lived with talk of secession and the possibility of civil war until the Pony Express brought word that Fort Sumter had been fired upon in April 1861, confirming secession as fact. As was the case with many West Pointers, Buford had to choose between North and South. Based on his background, Buford had ample reason to join the Confederacy. He was a native Kentuckian, the son of a slave-owning father, and the husband of a woman whose relatives would fight for the South, as would a number of his own. On the other hand, Buford had been educated in the North and come to maturity within the Army. His two most influential professional role models, Colonels William S. Harney and Philip St. George Cooke, were Southerners who elected to remain with the Union and the U.S. Army. He loved his profession and his time on the frontier had snapped the ties that drew other Southerners home. John Gibbon, a North Carolinian facing the same dilemma, recalled in a post-war memoir the evening that John Buford committed himself to the Union: In November 1861, Buford was appointed Assistant Inspector General with the rank of major, and, in July 1862, after having served for several months in the defense of Washington, was raised to the rank of brigadier general of volunteers. In 1862, he was given his first position, under Major General John Pope, as commander of the II Corps Cavalry Brigade of the Union Army of Virginia, which fought with distinction at the Second Battle of Bull Run. Buford personally led a charge late in the battle, but was wounded in the knee by a spent bullet. The injury was painful, but not serious, although some Union newspapers reported that he had been killed.Bielakowski, p. 310. He returned to active service, and served as chief of cavalry to Major Generals George B. McClellan and Ambrose E. Burnside in the Army of the Potomac. Unfortunately, this assignment was nothing more than a staff position, and he chafed for a field command. In McClellan's Maryland Campaign, Buford was in the battles of South Mountain and Antietam, replacing Brigadier General George Stoneman on McClellan's staff. Under Major General Joseph Hooker in 1863, however, Buford was given the Reserve Brigade of regular cavalry in the 1st Division, Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac. August 1863 ‚Äì General Buford (seated) & staff After the Battle of Chancellorsville, Major General Alfred Pleasonton was given command of the Cavalry Corps, although Hooker later agreed that Buford would have been the better choice. Buford first led his new division at the Battle of Brandy Station, which was virtually an all-cavalry engagement, and then again at the Battle of Upperville. In the Gettysburg Campaign, Buford, who had been promoted to command of the 1st Division, is credited with selecting the field of battle at Gettysburg. On June 30, Buford's command rode into the small town of Gettysburg. Very soon, Buford realized that he was facing a superior force of rebels to his front and set about creating a defense against the Confederate advance. He was acutely aware of the tactical importance of holding the high ground south of Gettysburg, and so he did, beginning one of the most important battles in American military history. His skillful defensive troop dispositions, coupled with the bravery and tenacity of his dismounted men, allowed the I Corps, under Major General John F. Reynolds, time to come up in support and thus maintain a Union foothold in tactically important positions. Despite Lee's barrage attack of 140 cannons and a final infantry attack on the third day of the battle, the Union army won a strategic victory. The importance of Buford's leadership and tactical foresight on July 1 cannot be overstated in its contribution to this victory. Afterward, Buford's troopers were sent by Pleasonton to Emmitsburg, Maryland, to resupply and refit, an ill-advised decision that uncovered the Union left flank. In the Retreat from Gettysburg, Buford pursued the Confederates to Warrenton, Virginia, and was afterward engaged in many operations in central Virginia, rendering particularly valuable service in covering Major General George Meade's retrograde movement in the October 1863 Bristoe Campaign. Death and legacy By mid-December, it was obvious that Buford was sick, possibly from contracting typhoid, and he took respite at the Washington home of his good friend, General George Stoneman. On December 16, Stoneman initiated the proposal that Buford be promoted to major general, and President Abraham Lincoln assented, writing as follows: \\"I am informed that General Buford will not survive the day. It suggests itself to me that he will be made Major General for distinguished and meritorious service at the Battle of Gettysburg.\\" Informed of the promotion, Buford inquired doubtfully, \\"Does he mean it?\\" When assured the promotion was genuine, he replied simply, \\"It is too late, now I wish I could live.\\"Sandford, np. In the last hours, Buford was attended by his aide, Captain Myles Keogh, and by Edward, his black servant. Also present were Lieutenant Colonel A. J. Alexander and General Stoneman. His wife Pattie was traveling from Rock Island, Illinois, but would not arrive in time. Near the end, he became delirious and began admonishing the servant, but then, in a moment of clarity, called for the man and apologized: \\"Edward, I hear that I have been scolding you. I did not know what I was doing. You have been a faithful servant, Edward.\\" John Buford died at 2 p.m., December 16, 1863, while Myles Keogh held him in his arms. His final reported words were \\"Put guards on all the roads, and don't let the men run to the rear.\\"Moore, np. On December 20, memorial services were held at the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church, a church on the corner of H. Street and New York Avenue in Washington, D.C. President Lincoln was among the mourners. Buford's wife was unable to attend due to illness. The pallbearers included Generals Casey, Heintzelman, Sickles, Schofield, Hancock, Doubleday, and Warren. General Stoneman commanded the escort in a procession that included \\"Grey Eagle,\\" Buford's old white horse that he rode at Gettysburg. After the service, two of Buford's staff, Captains Keogh and Wadsworth, escorted his body to West Point, where it was buried alongside fellow Gettysburg hero Lieutenant Alonzo Cushing, who had died defending the \\"high ground\\" (Cemetery Ridge) that Buford had chosen. In 1865, a 25-foot obelisk style monument was erected over his grave, financed by members of his old division. The officers of his staff published a resolution that set forth the esteem in which he was held by those in his command: In 1866, a military fort established on the Missouri- Yellowstone confluence in what is now North Dakota, was named Fort Buford after the general. The community of Buford, Wyoming, was renamed in the general's honor. It was sold at auction for $900,000 on April 5, 2012 to an unnamed Vietnamese by its owner, who had served in the U.S. military in 1968‚Äì1969. In 1895, a bronze statue of Buford designed by artist James E. Kelly was dedicated on the Gettysburg Battlefield. In 1992, the M8 Buford light tank was produced and named after him. In popular media Buford was portrayed by Sam Elliott in the 1993 film Gettysburg, based on Michael Shaara's novel The Killer Angels. Buford is a character in the alternate history novel Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War, written by Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen.

History =First World War= Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8, similar to what No. 10 Squadron operated between 1917 and 1918. No. 10 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps was formed from a nucleus provided by No. 1 Reserve Aircraft Squadron on 1 January 1915 at Farnborough Airfield, Hampshire.Philpott 2013, p.388 It initially acted as a training squadron until 27 July 1915 when it relocated to Saint- Omer on Western Front in France. No. 10 Squadron's first major engagement was providing spotting for the Indian Corps during the Battle of Loos in September 1915 with the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2. The squadron also participated in the Battle of the Somme in 1916. In April 1917, No. 10 Squadron carried out spotting and bombing duties during the Second Battle of Arras. The squadron re-equipped with the Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8 in September 1917. In June 1918, No. 10 Squadron began to receive the Bristol F.2b. The squadron participated in the Second Battle of the Somme between August and September 1918. The squadron briefly spent time in Germany as part of the army of occupation after the armistice. On 8 February 1919, the squadron was reduced to a cadre and returned to the UK. It was disbanded on 31 December 1919 following the end of the First World War, like many other squadrons.Halley 1988, p. 38. =Interwar= On 3 January 1928, No. 10 Squadron was reformed as a night bomber unit at RAF Upper Heyford with the Handley Page Hyderabad. The unit relocated to RAF Boscombe Down in April 1931 and re-equipped with the Handley Page Hinaidi. These soon gave way to the Vickers Virginia in September 1932 before being replaced by the Handley Page Heyford in 1934. On 16 September 1935, the unit helped provide the nucleus to form No. 97 Squadron and later helped form No. 78 Squadron on 1 November 1936. No. 10 Squadron moved to RAF Dishforth on 25 January 1937 to form part of the newly created No. 4 Group of RAF Bomber Command (which they would remain a part of throughout the Second World War), converting to the monoplane Armstrong Whitworth Whitley Mk.I. =Second World War= Handley Page Halifax Mk.II L9619 of No. 10 Squadron based at RAF Leeming, December 1941.

On the night of 11/12 June 1940, Whitleys from No. 10 Squadron launched a raid on the Italian cities of Turin and Genoa. On 8 July 1940, the unit moved to RAF Leeming, Yorkshire.Falconer, p. 140 On 23 September 1940, the squadron launched a raid on the Boulogne docks in occupied-France. In December 1941, the squadron converted to the Handley Page Halifax Mk.I/Mk.II.Halley 1988, p. 39. In July 1942, the squadron was split in two when a detachment was sent to RAF Aqir, British Mandate, which went on to form No. 462 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force. On 19 August 1942, No. 10 Squadron relocated to RAF Melbourne, Yorkshire, where it would remain until the end of the war in Europe.Falconer, p. 140 On 7 May 1945, No. 10 Squadron was transferred to Transport Command and converted over to the Douglas Dakota. The squadron relocated to RAF Broadwell, Oxfordshire, on 6 August 1945. =Post-War= Transport Command (1945‚Äì1950) Following the end of the war, No. 10 Squadron relocated to India in October 1945 where it carried out transport duties until it disbanded on 20 December 1947. The squadron was reformed once more on 4 October 1948 when No. 238 Squadron was renumbered to No. 10 Squadron at RAF Oakington, Cambridgeshire. Between 1948 and 1949, the squadron took part in the Berlin Airlift,Ashworth, p. 50 operating from RAF L√ºbeck. No. 10 Squadron disbanded once more on 20 February 1950. Bomber Command (1953‚Äì1964) On 15 January 1953, No. 10 Squadron reverted to its original bomber role upon its reformation at RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire, with the English Electric Canberra B.2. In April 1955, the squadron moved to RAF Honington, Suffolk, while Scampton was closed for runway works. Between October and November 1956, No. 10 Squadron deployed to RAF Nicosia, Cyprus, during the Suez Crisis. From RAF Nicosia, Canberra B.2 WH853 of No. 10 Squadron dropped the first RAF bombs on Egypt during a raid on Almaza Air Base on 31 October 1956. The squadron disbanded on 15 January 1957. No. 10 Squadron reformed at RAF Cottesmore on 15 April 1958 flying the Handley Page Victor B.1 until disbandment on 1 March 1964. Vickers VC10 (1966‚Äì2005) Vickers VC10 C.1 XV106 of No. 10 Squadron in 1977. The squadron's numberplate was transferred back from Bomber Command to Transport Command in 1965, and on 1 July 1966 the squadron reformed at RAF Brize Norton as the first operators to receive the new Vickers VC10 C.1. Fourteen VC10 C.1s were delivered to 10 Squadron between 1966 and 1967. The C.1 was a variant of the civil 'Standard VC10' fitted with the wing and more powerful engines of the 'Super VC10'. The C.1 could carry 139 passengers in rear-facing seats, eight standard pallets or up to 78 medical evacuation stretchers. These VC10s were named after airmen who had been awarded the Victoria Cross. The most visible role No. 10 Squadron's VC10s played was that of VIP transport and aeromedical evacuations. In the VIP role the C1s flew the British Royal Family, government ministers and Prime Ministers around the world. Later the VC10 VIP role was phased out, VIP transport being carried out by chartered British Airways 767s and the RAF BAe 146 fleet. However, former Prime Minister Tony Blair reverted to the VC10 for more sensitive flights, notably during his diplomacy to Pakistan and the Middle East after the 11 September 2001 attacks. The rationalisation of the VC10 force led to No. 10 Squadron being disbanded on 14 October 2005, with their C.1(K) aircraft transferred to No. 101 Squadron. =Airbus Voyager (2011‚Äìpresent)= Airbus Voyager KC3 ZZ335 at Tallinn Airport, Estonia, August 2015. In 2011, with the closure of RAF Lyneham and the transfer of the RAF's Hercules force to Brize Norton, it was announced that No. 10 Squadron would be reformed as the first operator of the new Airbus Voyager.RAF Hercules fleet moves to Brize Norton ‚Äì MOD, 4 July 2011 The squadron was officially reformed on 1 July 2011.Chairman's Message - RAF 10 Squadron Association The first Voyager (ZZ330) was delivered to Brize Norton on 5 April 2012. Operations began with the Voyager on 12 May 2012, with a sortie flown from RAF Brize Norton to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus. The first air-to-air refuelling flight with the Voyager took place on 20 May 2013, when No. 10 Squadron refuelled Panavia Tornado GR4s.

The museum is located in the Grange Park neighbourhood of downtown Toronto, on Dundas Street West between McCaul and Beverley streets. The museum's building complex takes up of physical space, making it one of the largest art museums in North America. In addition to exhibition spaces, the museum also houses an artist-in-residence office and studio, dining facilities, event spaces, gift shop, library and archives, theatre and lecture hall, research centre, and a workshop. Established in 1900 as the Art Museum of Toronto, and formally incorporated in 1903. It was renamed to the Art Gallery of Toronto in 1919, before it adopted its present name, the Art Gallery of Ontario, in 1966. The museum acquired the Grange in 1911 and later undertook several expansions to the north and west of the structure. The first series of expansions occurred in 1918, 1924, and 1935, designed by Darling and Pearson. Since 1974, the gallery has undergone four major expansions and renovations. These expansions occurred in 1974 and 1977 by John C. Parkin, and 1993 by Barton Myers and KPMB Architects. From 2004 to 2008, the museum underwent another expansion by Frank Gehry. The museum complex saw further renovations in the 2010s by KPMB, and Hariri Pontarini Architects. The museum's permanent collection includes over 98,000 works spanning the first century to the present day. The museum collection includes a number works from Canadian, First Nations, Inuit, African, European, and Oceanic artists. In addition to exhibits for its collection, the museum has organized and hosted a number of travelling art exhibitions. History The museum was founded in 1900 as the Art Museum of Toronto by a group of private citizens and members of the Toronto Society of Arts. The institution's founders included George A. Cox, Lady Eaton, Sir Joseph W. Flavelle, J. W. L. Forster, E. F. B. Johnston, Sir William Mackenzie, Hart A. Massey, Prof. James Mavor, F. Nicholls, Sir Edmund Osler, Sir Henry M. Pellatt, George Agnew Reid, Byron Edmund Walker, Mrs. H. D. Warren, E.R. Wood, and Frank P. Wood. A south view of the first expansion building in 1922 The museum's incorporation was confirmed by the Government of Ontario three years later by legislation, An Act respecting the Art Museum of Toronto in 1903. The legislation provided the museum with expropriation powers in order to acquire land for the museum. Before the museum moved into a permanent location, it held exhibitions in rented spaces belonging to the Toronto Public Library near the intersection of Brunswick Avenue and College Street. The museum acquired the property it presently occupies shortly after the death of Harriet Boulton Smith in 1909, when she bequeathed her historic 1817 Georgian manor, The Grange, to the gallery upon her death. However, exhibitions continued to be held in the rented spaces at the Toronto Public Library branch until June 1913, when The Grange was formally opened as the art museum. In 1911, ownership of The Grange, and the surrounding property was formally transferred to the museum. Shortly afterwards, the museum signed an agreement with the municipal government of Toronto to maintain the grounds south of The Grange as a municipal park. In 1916, the museum drafted plans to construct a small portion of a new gallery building designed by Darling and Pearson in the Beaux-Arts style. Excavation of the new facility began in 1916. The first galleries adjacent to The Grange were opened in 1918. In the next year, the museum was renamed the Art Gallery of Toronto, in an effort to avoid confusion with the Royal Ontario Museum. In 1920, the museum also allowed the Ontario College of Art to construct a building on the grounds. The museum was expanded again in 1924, with the opening of the museum's sculpture court, its two adjacent galleries, and its main entrance on Dundas Street. The museum was expanded again in 1935 with the construction of two additional galleries. Portions of the 1935 expansions were financed by Eaton's. View of Walker Court in 1929, several years after it opened. In 1965, the museum saw its collection of European and Canadian artworks expand, with the acquisition of 340 works from the Canadian National Exhibition. During the mid-1960s, the director of the museum, William J. Withrow, pushed to have the museum designated as a provincial museum, in an effort to gain further provincial funding for the institution. In 1966, the museum changed its name to the Art Gallery of Ontario, in order to reflect its new mandate to serve as the provincial art museum. In the 1970s, the museum embarked on another expansion of its gallery space, with its first phase completed with the opening of the Henry Moore Sculpture Centre on October 26, 1974. Although the museum planned on expanding its Canadian exhibits in its second phase of expansions, the creation of a centre dedicated to a non- Canadian artists drew criticism from Canadian Artists' Representation, and threatened to protest the opening of the centre. The museum was expanded again in 1993, which saw the of new space and of renovations‚Äîusable space, increasing the preexisting floorspace by 30 per cent. The expansion saw the renovation of 20 galleries, and the construction of 30 galleries. In 1978, the museum's staff was unionized under the Ontario Public Service Employees Union. During the 1990s, the museum drafted plans that would have saw the development of a pedestrian mall from University Avenue to the art gallery. However, conflicting developments on adjacent properties, lack of support from the City of Toronto government, and the eventual development of another renovation plan by Frank Gehry saw the museum's plans for a pedestrian mall abandoned in the early 2000. In 1996, Canadian multi-media artist Jubal Brown vandalized Raoul Dufy's Harbor at le Havre in the Art Gallery of Ontario by deliberately vomiting primary colours on them. Construction for the Frank Gehry redesign of the museum complex in February 2008 Under the direction of then-CEO Matthew Teitelbaum, the museum embarked on a C$254 million (later increased to C$276 million) redevelopment plan by architect Frank Gehry in 2004, called Transformation AGO. Although Gehry was born in Toronto, the redevelopment of the museum complex would be his first work in Canada. The project initially drew some criticism. As an expansion, rather than a new creation, concerns were raised that the structure would not look like a Gehry signature building, and that the opportunity to build an entirely new gallery, perhaps on Toronto's waterfront, was being squandered. During the course of the redevelopment planning, board member and patron Joey Tanenbaum temporarily resigned his position over concerns about donor recognition, design issues surrounding the new building, as well as the cost of the project. The public rift was subsequently healed. Kenneth Thomson was a major benefactor of Transformation AGO, donating much of his art collection to the gallery (providing large contributions to the European and Canadian collections), in addition to providing $50 million towards the renovation, as well as a $20 million endowment. Thomson died in 2006, two years before the project was complete. In 2018, the museum formally changed the name of Emily Carr's The Indian Church painting to Church at Yuquot Village in an effort to remove culturally insensitive language from the title of works in its collection. A note next to the painting provides the original name of the piece and explains Carr's use of the term was with keeping in \\"the language of her era\\". The museum has also reviewed the titles of several other works on a case-by-case basis, as items from the Canadian collection are rotated from its exhibit, or from its storage. In May 2019, the museum changed its admission model, offering free entry to visitors 25 years of age and under and a C$35 pass for all others, which provides admission to the museum for the entire year. = Selected exhibitions since 1994 = King Tut: The Golden King and the Great Pharaohs exhibition hosted at the Art Gallery of Ontario in 2009 The Art Gallery of Ontario has hosted and organized a number of temporary and travelling exhibitions in its galleries.

The Grange manor was reopened to serve as the museum's building in 1913. Since its opening, the museum underwent several expansions to the north, and west of The Grange. Expansions to the museum were opened in 1918, 1924, 1935, 1974, 1977, 1993, and 2008. The museum complex takes up of physical space, and is made up of two buildings, The Grange, and the main building expansion, built to the north, and west of The Grange. After the main building's redevelopment in 2008, the museum complex has of dedicated gallery space. =The Grange= The Grange is a historic manor built in 1817 and is the oldest portion of the museum complex. The building is two-and-a- half storeys tall, and built from stone, brick-on-brick cladding, and wood and glass detailing. Although it was designed in a Neoclassical style, it retains the symmetrical features of Georgian-styled buildings, found in Upper Canada prior to the War of 1812. The building was initially used as a private residence, with its previous owners having altered the property on several occasions before its re-purposing into an art museum. This includes the addition of a west wing in the 1840s, and another wing to the west in 1885. Although the museum expanded the complex in the decades after acquiring the property, The Grange itself saw little work done to it for the next half- century. As a part of its 1967‚Äì1973 expansion project, the museum restored The Grange to its 1830s configuration, and repurposed the building into a historic house. The Grange was operated as a historic house until it was later repurposed by the museum as an exhibition space and members' lounge. The western wings of The Grange were built in the 1840s and 1885. The main building's South Gallery block is visible in the background. The building was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1970. The building was later designated by the City of Toronto government as \\"The Grange and Grange Park\\" in 1991 under the Ontario Heritage Act. In 2005, the City of Toronto government, and the museum entered a heritage easement agreement, which requires designated interior and exterior elements of The Grange to be retained for perpetuity. =Main building= Situated directly north and west of The Grange, the main building was opened to the public in 1918, and has underwent a number of expansions and renovations since opening. Plans for the \\"main building\\" to the north of The Grange originated in 1912, when the architectural firm Darling and Pearson submitted their expansion plans for the north of The Grange. Due to The Grange's location, and historic value, the expansion plans were limited along the southern portions of the museum's property; as the museum wanted to preserve The Grange's southern facade, and the municipal park south of the building. The expanded plan featured 30 viewing halls, all of which would surround one of three open courtyards, an English garden, an Italian garden, and a sculpture courtyard. The design was largely modelled after another building designed by Darling and Pearson, the Royal Ontario Museum. The designs by Darling and Pearson were intended to be implemented in three phases, although the plans for the final design phase were abandoned by the mid-20th century. Construction for the first phase began in 1916, and was completed in 1918. The first phase featured an expansion wing adjacent to The Grange, that had three galleries. The second phase of the design was opened in 1926. It included half of the sculpture court (later named Walker Court) to the north of the 1918 wing, two additional galleries flanking the sculpture court, and an entrance to the north. The exterior facade of the 1926 expansion was only made of bricks and stucco. No serious designs were planned for the exterior facade of the 1926 expansion, as the museum envisioned that the exterior facade would eventually be enclosed in stone by future expansions. Further expansions to the east and the west of the building was completed in 1935. However, as the third phase of expansion was never embarked on, the \\"temporary facade\\" to the north remained the same until the early 1990s. Late-20th century expansions Western fa√ßade of the main building from Beverley Street, prior to the 2004‚Äì2008 redevelopment. The western portion of the building opened in 1977. Another series of expansion was undertaken by the museum during the 1970s, as a part of a new three-phased expansion plan; with its first two phases designed by John C. Parkin. The first phase of the expansion was completed in 1974, which saw the restoration of the Grange, and the opening of the Henry Moore Sculpture Centre, a centre which Moore helped design. Moore choose the dimensions for the centre, the colour of the floor and the walls, and saw the installation of a skylight in the centre, in order to allow more natural light into the gallery. The centre saw little alteration to its design during the museum's expansion in the early 2000s, with the exception of a opening, providing access to the Galleria Italia. The second phase saw the opening of several new galleries adjacent to Beverley Street in 1977. The third phase of expansion planned by the museum was delayed until August 1986, when it announced a competition for Ontario- based architects to design the museum's southwest, and northern extension on Dundas Street to cover the \\"temporary facade\\". A seven-member panel eventually selected a design by Barton Myers. The architectural firm KPMB Architects was contracted to complete the expansion, which opened in 1993. The expansion in 1993 saw of new space built, and the construction of 30 new galleries. After the expansion and renovations in 1993, the museum complex had approximately of interior space. 2004‚Äì2008 redevelopment From 2004 to 2008, the museum's building underwent a C$276 million redevelopment, led by architect Frank Gehry. Gehry was commissioned to expand and revitalize the museum, not to design a new building; as such, one of the challenges he faced was to unite the disparate areas of the building that had become \\"a bit of a hodgepodge\\" after six previous expansions dating back to the 1920s. The redevelopment plans was the first design by Gehry to not feature a highly contorted structural steel frame for the building's support system. The exterior fronting on Dundas Street was changed as a part of the redevelopment; with the front entrance moved to the north, aligning with Walker Court, and the installation of a glass and wood projecting canopy known as the \\"Galleria Italia\\". The roof of Walker's Court was also redeveloped, with steel truss girders installed, and glued laminated timber used to support the glass- panelled roof, which provides of skylight for the courtyard. The southern portion of the museum building also saw redevelopment, with the construction of a five-storey South Gallery block, and a protruding spiral staircase that connects the fourth and fifth levels of the block. The exterior facade of the South Gallery Block includes glass and custom made titanium panels, and like the Dundas Street fronting, is supported by glued laminated timber. The new addition required the demolition of the postmodernist wing by Myers and KPMB Architects. Wood was used extensively during the redevelopment, with woodwork needing to be done for the museum's hardwood floor, information kiosk, ticket booth, security booth, and the stairs inside the building, including a spiral staircase in Walker Court. The facings of the booths, staircases, and the hardwood floor is made of Douglas fir trees. The redeveloped building opened in November 2008, with the transformation increasing the museum's total floor area by 20 per cent for a total of ; as well as increasing the art viewing space by 47 per cent. An event space called Baillie Court occupies the entirety of the third floor of the south tower block. =Galleria Italia= The Galleria Italia is a glass, steel, and wood projecting canopy at the fronting of Dundas Street, also acting as a viewing hall on the second level of the building. The galleria was named in recognition of a $13 million contribution by 26 Italian-Canadian families of Toronto, a funding consortium led by Tony Gagliano, a past President of the museum's Board of Trustees. Both ends of the glass and wood canopy extend pass the building forming \\"tears\\", providing the appearance that the building's facade has been pulled off the building. The Galleria Italia is made out of glued laminated timber and glass gallery space which sites atop the Dundas Street walkway. Approximately 1,800 glued laminated timber pieces were used on the facade of the Galleria Italia; and 2,500 timber connectors. The galleria is composed of two layers, with the inner layer formed by 47 vertical radial arches, each of which increases in spacing between one another as it approaches the main entrance. The radials provide lateral support against the wind for the outer layer, a glued laminated timber mullion grid, as it transfers the weight to the floor. Both of these sit on a steel frame, which supports the galleria. The mullion grid itself is attached to sliding bearings, that allows its curtain wall to adjust to changes in temperature, without compromising the integrity of the wood. Most of the timber was made of Douglas fir trees, from a manufacturer based in Penticton, British Columbia. Each piece of timber is unique, given that the galleria's design featured slants that increased in width incrementally, and whose curvatures were changing throughout its length. The galleria uses 128 steel horizontal beams to prevent the radials from contorting. Given that the museum is typically maintained at 50 per cent relative humidity, the steel used to support the glued laminated timber required a galvanized finish in order to prevent corrosion. =Reception for redevelopment= Walker Court after the 2004 to 2008 redevelopment. The redevelopment saw walkways and staircases \\"threaded\\" through the courtyard. The completed expansion received wide acclaim, notably for the restraint of its design. An editorial in The Globe and Mail called it a \\"restrained masterpiece\\", noting: \\"The proof of Mr. Gehry's genius lies in his deft adaptation to unusual circumstances. By his standards, it was to be done on the cheap, for a mere $276-million. The museum's administrators and neighbours were adamant that the architect, who is used to being handed whole city blocks for over-the-top titanium confections, produce a lower-key design, sensitive to its context and the gallery's long history.\\" The Toronto Star called it \\"the easiest, most effortless and relaxed architectural masterpiece this city has seen\\", with The Washington Post commenting: \\"Gehry's real accomplishment in Toronto is the reprogramming of a complicated amalgam of old spaces. That's not sexy, like titanium curves, but it's essential to the project.\\" The architecture critic of The New York Times wrote: \\"Rather than a tumultuous creation, this may be one of Mr. Gehry's most gentle and self-possessed designs. It is not a perfect building, yet its billowing glass facade, which evokes a crystal ship drifting through the city, is a masterly example of how to breathe life into a staid old structure. And its interiors underscore one of the most underrated dimensions of Mr. Gehry's immense talent: a supple feel for context and an ability to balance exuberance with delicious moments of restraint. Instead of tearing apart the old museum, Mr. Gehry carefully threaded new ramps, walkways and stairs through the original.\\" 2010s renovations The museum opened the Weston Family Learning Centre in October 2011, designed by Hariri Pontarini Architects. The space is an exploration art centre, featuring a hands-on centre centre for children, a youth centre, and an art workshop and studio. Several months later, in April 2012, the museum opened the David Milne Study Centre, which was designed by KPMB Architects. The cost to build the David Milne Study Centre cost the museum approximately C$1 million. The South Entrance and lounge outside the library, also designed by Hariri Pontarini Architects, was opened in July 2017. The renovated and renamed J. S. McLean Centre for Indigenous & Canadian Art opened in July 2018. Permanent collection Snuff bottles from the museum's Kenneth Thomson collection AGO's permanent collection saw significant growth in the late-20th and early-21st century. The museum's permanent collection grew from 3,400 works in 1960, to 10,700 in 1985. As of March 2018, the AGO's permanent collection holds over 98,000 pieces, representing many artistic movements and eras of art history. The museum's collection is organized into several \\"collection areas,\\" which typically encompasses works from a specific art form, artist, benefactor, chronological era, or geographic locale. Until the early 1980s, works collected for the museum's collection was primarily Canadian or European artists. Its collection has since expanded to include artworks from the Indigenous peoples in Canada, and other cultures from around the world. The museum's African collection includes 95 artworks, most of which originate from 19th century Sahara. Exhibited at a permanent gallery on the second floor of the museum, most of the pieces in the African collection were gifted to the museum by Murray Frum, with the first pieces donated to the museum in 1972. The museum also has a number of Ethiopian Christian manuscripts and artworks, although these works form a part Thomson Collection of boxwoods and ivories. In 2002, the museum was bequeathed 1,000 works by Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islanders artists. Some of these items are exhibited at a gallery on the second floor of the museum. In 2004, Kenneth Thomson donated over 2,000 works from his personal collection to the museum. Although the majority of the Thomson collection consist of works by Canadian or European artists, the collection also includes works created by artists in other parts of the world. =Canadian= The museum includes an extensive collection of Canadian art, from pre-Confederation to the 1990s. Most of the museum's Canadian art is exhibited on the second floor, with 39 viewing halls dedicated to exhibiting 1,447 pieces from the museum's Canadian collection. The wing includes the 23 viewing halls of the Thomson Collection of Canadian Art, and the 14 viewing halls of J.S. Mclean Centre for Indigenous & Canadian Art. Canadian works are also exhibited in the David Milne Centre and the visible storage area in the museum's concourse. Mail Boat Landing at Quebec by Cornelius Krieghoff (1860). It is one of 145 works by Krieghoff in the Thomson Collection of Canadian Art. The galleries of the Thomson Collection of Canadian Art provide an in-depth look at the works of individual artists, whereas the other viewing halls of organized around later thematic issues. The Thomson Collection was donated to the museum by Kenneth Thompson in January 2004. The collections features nearly 650 paintings and works by Canadian artists; 250 of which were created by Tom Thomson; 145 works from Cornelius Krieghoff; 168 works from David Milne, and others from the Group of Seven. Nearly two-thirds of the collection were re-framed in preparation for their installation into the viewing halls. In addition to the Thomson Collection of Canadian Art, works by David Milne are also housed in the David Milne Study Centre. The centre was opened in 2012, and feature computer terminals linked to the Milne Digital Archives, and televisions which play films on Milne's life. The centre houses works and 230 other artifacts belonging to Milne, including diaries, journal, and paint boxes. Most of the Milne artifacts were gifted to the museum from Milne's son in 2009. The J.S. McLean Centre for Indigenous & Canadian Art exhibits 132 from Canadian and indigenous artists. Approximately 40 per cent of works presented in the centre were created by Indigenous artists. The McLean Centre for Indigenous and Canadian Art is , with 14 viewing halls. Three of these galleries are dedicated to exhibiting Inuit art, whereas one is dedicated to exhibiting contemporary First Nations art. Works in the Mclean Centre are organized around larger thematic issues relating to Canadian history, as opposed to chronologically. As a result, works from indigenous and Canadian artists are presented together to showcase the reciprocal influences and conflict between the two. An example of such thematic presentation is evident in how the museum exhibits Tom Thomson's The West Wind. When the painting was exhibited at the Mclean Centre, it was presented with Anishinaabe pouches adjacent to it, showcasing how two peoples viewed northern Ontario at that time. Text that accompanies works in the centre are presented in three languages, English, French, and either Anishinaabemowin or Inuktitut. The walls along the primary entry point into the McLean Centre is marked by small projectile points from arrows, spears, and knives from 9,000 BCE to 1,000 CE. The projectiles are a part of an art installation, as opposed to an ethnographic or archeological display. The West Wind by Tom Thomson (1917). The Canadian collection includes a number of works by Thomson. Landscape paintings from Canadian artists were among the first paintings to be acquired for the museum's collection. The museum's Canadian collection has works from a number of Canadian artists, including Jack Bush, Paul-√âmile Borduas, Kazuo Nakamura, and members of the Group of Seven. The museum has more than 300 works by David Milne; 168 of which were donated to the museum as a part of the Thomson Collection of Canadian Art. The museum also has nearly 150 works from A. Y. Jackson, although the majority of it is placed in storage. The collection also features works from Canadian sculptors Frances Loring, Esmaa Mohamoud, and Florence Wyle. The museum also has a large collection Inuit artworks. The 1970s saw the first Inuit artwork added to the museum's collection; with the Art Gallery of Ontario acquiring the Sarick Collection, the Issacs Reference Collection, and the Klamer Collection during the 1970s and early 1980s. In 1988, the museum formed the Inuit Collections Committee in order to maintain and grow the collection. The collection includes 2,800 sculptures, 1,300 prints, 700 drawings and wall hangings from Inuit artists. 500 of these works are exhibited at the Inuit Visible Storage Gallery, opened in 2013. Conversely, the museum did not acquire its first First Nations artwork until 1979, acquiring a piece by Norval Morrisseau for its contemporary collection. The Art Gallery of Ontario did not acquire First Nations art until the late-1970s, in an effort to prevent overlap between the AGO's permanent collection and the permanent collections of the Royal Ontario Museum; which already had a collection of First Nations art. The early 21st century saw the museum increase the representation of First Nations art in its Canadian-centred galleries, including the R. Samuel McLaughlin Gallery. First Nations artists whose works are featured in the museum's collection includes Charles Edenshaw, and Shelley Niro. =Contemporary= Hallway in the Vivian & David Campbell Centre for Contemporary Art, situated within the south gallery block The museum's contemporary art collection contains works from international artists from the 1960s to present, and Canadians from the 1990s to present. The collection also extends to installations, photography, graphic art (such as concert, film, and historic posters), film and video art. Works from these collections are exhibited in several centres and galleries throughout the museum, including the Vivian & David Campbell Centre for Contemporary Art which comprise the upper three levels of the south gallery block, and the Galleria Italia. The museum's contemporary collection includes a number of works by Canadian artists, General Idea, Brian Jungen, Liz Magor, Michael Snow, and Jeff Wall. The museum's contemporary collection also has works by international artists in the Arte Povera, conceptualism minimalism, neo-expressionism, pop art, and postminimalism movements. Artists from these movements whose works are included in the museum's collection include Jim Dine, Donald Judd, Mona Hatoum, Pierre Huyghe, John McCracken, Claes Oldenburg, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Gerhard Richter, Richard Serra, Robert Smithson, Andy Warhol, and Lawrence Weiner. The museum also features a permanent exhibition of Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirror Room ‚Äì Let's Survive Forever in one of the viewing halls of the Signy Eaton Gallery. The permanent Infinity Room was purchased in 2018 for C$2 million, after the success of a larger multi-room Kusama and Infinity Mirror Room travelling exhibit held in the same year. The permanent Infinity Room was opened in May 2019. =European= Viewing hall in the Tannenbaum Centre for European Art. The museum has a large collection of European art ranging from 1000 CE to 1900 CE, Items from the museum's European collection are exhibited in several viewing halls throughout the museum. The Tannenbaum Centre for European Art and its viewing halls are located on the ground floor. Paintings and sculptures from the Thomson Collection of European Art are exhibited on the ground floor, while the ship models from the Thomson collection are exhibited in the museum's concourse. The European Collection includes the Margaret and Ian Ross Collection, which features a number of bronze sculptures and medals, with a particular emphasis on Baroque art from Italy. The museum's collection of European paintings and sculptures was further bolstered in January 2004, after the museum acquired the Thomson Collection of European Art. The Thomson Collection of European Art includes over 900 objects, including 130 ship models. Massacre of the Innocents by Peter Paul Rubens (1611). The painting was donated to the museum in 2004. The Thomson Collection of European Art includes the world's largest holding of the Gothic boxwood miniatures, featuring 10 carved beads and two altarpieces. Other works featured in the Thomson Collection for European Art includes Massacre of the Innocents by Peter Paul Rubens. The painting was acquired by Ken Thomson in 2002 for C$115 million, at the time the most expensive Old Master work sold at an art auction. Thompson intended for the work to serve as the centrepiece for the collections he donated to the museum in 2004. When the museum reopened in 2008, the painting was installed in a blood-red, low-lit room in the Thomson Collection for European Art. The room featured no other paintings, with the only lighting in the room directed towards the work. The painting remained at that location until 2017 when it was placed in a gallery with other works from the European collection. In 2019, the museum acquired the painting Iris Bleus, Jardin du Petit Gennevilliers by Gustave Caillebotte for more than C$1 million. The painting is the second work by Caillebotte to enter the permanent collections of a Canadian art museum. The museum's European collection also includes major works by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Giovanni del Biondo, Edgar Degas, Thomas Gainsborough, Paul Gauguin, Frans Hals, Claude Monet, Angelo Pi√≤, Nino Pisano, Rembrandt, Auguste Rodin, and James Tissot. =Modern= Sculptures from the modern collection at the Joey & Toby Tanenbaum Sculpture Atrium The museum's modern art collection includes works from Americans, and Europeans from the 1900s to the 1960s, Works by Canadian artists during this time period are typically exhibited as a part of its Canadian collection, as opposed to the museum's modern art collection. Works from the modern art collection are exhibited in several centres and galleries throughout the museum, including the Joey & Toby Tanenbaum Sculpture Atrium, the Henry Moore Sculpture Centre, and several other galleries on the ground floor of the museum. The museum is home to the largest public collection of works by Henry Moore, most of which is held in the Henry Moore Sculpture Centre. The museum dedicated approximately of space to the sculptor, which includes the Henry Moore Sculpture Centre, and related galleries including the Irina Moore Gallery. Moore donated 300 pieces, nearly his entire personal collection, to the museum in 1974. The donation originated from a commitment made by Moore on December 9, 1968, to donate a significant portion of his work to the Art Gallery of Ontario, contingent that the museum builds a dedicated gallery to exhibit his works. In addition to the works donated by Moore, the museum also purchased another piece, Two Large Forms, from the sculptor in 1973. The sculpture was originally placed at the museum's northeast fa√ßade, near the intersection of Dundas and McCaul streets. However, the museum later relocated the sculpture to Grange Park nearby in 2017 as part of the park's renovation. The museum's modern collection also includes works by Pierre Bonnard, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, Marc Chagall, Otto Dix, Jean Dubuffet, Jacob Epstein, Helen Frankenthaler, Alberto Giacometti, Natalia Goncharova, Arshile Gorky, Barbara Hepworth, Hans Hofmann, Franz Kline, Henri Matisse, Fernand L√©ger, Joan Mir√≥, Amedeo Modigliani, Claude Monet, Ben Nicholson, Pablo Picasso, Gino Severini, and Yves Tanguy. =Photography= The Art Gallery of Ontario also has a photography collection of 70,000 photographs dating from the 1840s to present day. The photograph collection includes 495 photo albums from the First World War. Items from this collection are exhibited in two viewing halls on the ground floor.

In June 2019, the museum acquired the Montgomery Collection of Caribbean Photos, which includes 3,500 historic photographs of the Caribbean from the 1840s to 1940s. The collection was acquired by the museum for $300,000, most if which was provided by 27 donors from Toronto's Caribbean community. The Montgomery Collection is the largest collection of its kind outside the Caribbean. Other photographers whose works are featured in the collection include Edward Burtynsky, Alfred Eisenstaedt, Robert J. Flaherty, Suzy Lake, Arnold Newman, Henryk Ross, Josef Sudek, Linnaeus Tripe, and Garry Winogrand. =Prints and drawings= Young Country Gil Dancing by Fran√ßois Boucher (), part of the museum's prints and drawings collection The museum's prints and drawings collection includes more than 20,000 prints, drawings, and other works on paper, from the 1400s to the present day.

The collection includes the largest and most significant body of works from Betty Goodwin, with a bulk of the works given to the gallery by the artist. In 2015, the museum was bequeathed 170 drawings, prints, and sculptures by K√§the Kollwitz. The prints and drawings collection also includes drawings by David Blackwood, Fran√ßois Boucher, John Constable, Greg Curnoe, Jean-Honor√© Fragonard, Thomas Gainsborough, Paul Gauguin, Vasily Kandinsky, Michelangelo, David Milne, Pablo Picasso, Egon Schiele, Michael Snow, Walter Trier, Vincent van Gogh, and Frederick Varley; and prints by Ernst Barlach, James Gillray, Francisco Goya, K√§the Kollwitz, Henry Moore, Robert Motherwell, Rembrandt, Thomas Rowlandson, Stanley Spencer, James Tissot, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and James McNeill Whistler. Library and archives The Art Gallery of Ontario also houses the Edward P. Taylor Library & Archives. The library and archives are open to the public and require no entrance fee. However, access to the museum's archives, and its special collections requires a scheduled appointment. The library also serves as the adjunct art history library for OCAD University. =Library= The general collections of the library reflect the permanent collection of works of art and the public programs of the Art Gallery of Ontario, containing over 300,000 volumes for general art information and academic research in the history of art. The library serves as a reference library; materials in the collections do not circulate. Holdings encompass western art in all media from the medieval period to the 21st century; the art of Canada's indigenous peoples including Inuit art; and African and Oceanian art. The library additionally comprises Canadian, American and European art journals and newspapers; over 50,000 art sales and auction catalogues (late 18th century to current); 40,000 documentation files on Canadian art and artists, and international contemporary artists; and multimedia, digital and microform collections. Materials may be searched on the online catalogue. The Library & Archives also produces pathfinders and bibliographies for collections research, such as the Thomson Collection Resource Guide to the large collection of works of art donated by benefactor and collector Kenneth Thomson. Work tables at the Edward P. Taylor Library & Archives, the art gallery's library and archives The library's rare books collection includes art historical sourcebooks from the 17th century to the present; British Neoclassical folios of the 18th century; catalogues raisonn√©s; British and Canadian illustrated books and magazines; travel guides, particularly Baedekers, Murrays, and Blue Guides; French art sales catalogues from the late 18th century to the mid-20th century; and artists' books. =Archives= The museum's archives document the history of the institution since its establishment in 1900, as well as The Grange since 1820. Series include exhibition files, publicity scrapbooks (documenting Gallery exhibitions and all other activity), architectural plans, photographs, records of the Gallery School, and correspondence (with art dealers, artists, collectors, and scholars). Because of the regularity with which artists' groups held exhibitions at the Gallery, the archives are a resource for research into the activities of the Group of Seven, the Canadian Group of Painters, the Ontario Society of Artists, and others. The Art Gallery of Ontario's special collections are one of the most important concentrations of archival material on the visual arts in Canada. In over 150 individual fonds and collections, ranging in date from the early 19th century to the present day, the Special Collections document with primary source material artists, art dealers and collectors, artist-run galleries, and other people and organizations that have shaped the Canadian art world. Programs =Artist-in-residence= The AGO's Artist-in-Residence program, the first of its kind at a major Canadian art gallery, grants selected artists access to AGO facilities, a stipend covering materials and living costs, and a dedicated studio, the Anne Lind AiR Studio in the Weston Family Learning Centre.25k Mocca Award honours arts patrons partners in art.

The language they speak is called iKota, but is sometimes referred to as Bakota, ikuta, Kota, and among the Fang, they are known as Mekora. The language has several dialects, which include: Ndambomo, Mahongwe, Ikota-la- hua, Sake, Menzambi, Bougom. Some of these dialects themselves include regional variations of some kind. The Kota are traditionally a patriarchal society, however some of the sub-groups such as the Mahongwe have over time adopted a matrilineal system of lineage (Mahongwe means, \\"from your father\\"). The true meaning of Bakota is unclear, however it may be derived from the word kota, which means to bind/to attach/to link, hereby suggesting they view themselves as a united people bound by a common fate. Estimates indicate that there are at least 43,500 Kota speakers in the world, of whom 34,442 people (79%) live in the Ogouee-Ivindo province of northeastern Gabon, and 9055 people (21%) in neighboring Congo-Brazzaville. They are noted for their copper and brass reliquary guardian figures, which are part of a powerful religious and mystical order known as Bwete. Another key feature of the Kota people is the originality of its circumcision and widow-purification rituals, which are generally kept secret. Politically, the Kota have been classified under the disputed \\"stateless societies\\" category. They have a strong egalitarian background, which in some instances cuts across age and gender lines. Kota children are taught to value tradition, respect for the elderly, and the concept of \\"Ewele\\" (loosely translated as 'pride'). The Kota are not considered big players in Gabonese politics, however some Kota have been appointed to key positions in the Government. Alexandre Sambat, a long-time ambassador to the United States who later ran for president in 1993, was of Kota origin. Pascal Desire Misongo, another Kota, has served as minister of Justice in Gabon.

It usually has two primary goals: To avoid the unintentional creation of positive feedback, which will cause the amplifier to oscillate, and to control overshoot and ringing in the amplifier's step response. It is also used extensively to improve the bandwidth of single pole systems. Explanation Figure 1: Step response of a two-pole amplifier for various degrees of compensation. Parameter Œ∂ is set by a compensation capacitor: smaller Œ∂ results in faster response, but more ringing and overshoot. Most amplifiers use negative feedback to trade gain for other desirable properties, such as decreased distortion, improved noise reduction or increased invariance to variation of parameters such as temperature. Ideally, the phase characteristic of an amplifier's frequency response would be linear; however, device limitations make this goal physically unattainable. More particularly, capacitances within the amplifier's gain stages cause the output signal to lag behind the input signal by 90¬∞ for each pole they create.In this context, a pole is the point in a frequency response curve where the amplitude decreases by 3db due to an integrating resistance and capacitive reactance. Ultimately, each pole will result in a phase lag of 90¬∞, i.e., the output signal will lag behind the input signal by 90¬∞ at this point. For the mathematical concept of a pole, see, Pole (complex analysis). If the sum of these phase lags reaches 360¬∞, the output signal will be in phase with the input signal. Feeding back any portion of this output signal to the input when the gain of the amplifier is sufficient will cause the amplifier to oscillate. This is because the feedback signal will reinforce the input signal. That is, the feedback is then positive rather than negative. Frequency compensation is implemented to avoid this result. Another goal of frequency compensation is to control the step response of an amplifier circuit as shown in Figure 1. For example, if a step in voltage is input to a voltage amplifier, ideally a step in output voltage would occur. However, the output is not ideal because of the frequency response of the amplifier, and ringing occurs. Several figures of merit to describe the adequacy of step response are in common use. One is the rise time of the output, which ideally would be short. A second is the time for the output to lock into its final value, which again should be short. The success in reaching this lock-in at final value is described by overshoot (how far the response exceeds final value) and settling time (how long the output swings back and forth about its final value). These various measures of the step response usually conflict with one another, requiring optimization methods. Frequency compensation is implemented to optimize step response, one method being pole splitting. Use in operational amplifiers Because operational amplifiers are so ubiquitous and are designed to be used with feedback, the following discussion will be limited to frequency compensation of these devices. It should be expected that the outputs of even the simplest operational amplifiers will have at least two poles. A consequence of this is that at some critical frequency, the phase of the amplifier's output = ‚àí180¬∞ compared to the phase of its input signal. The amplifier will oscillate if it has a gain of one or more at this critical frequency. This is because (a) the feedback is implemented through the use of an inverting input that adds an additional ‚àí180¬∞ to the output phase making the total phase shift ‚àí360¬∞ and (b) the gain is sufficient to induce oscillation. A more precise statement of this is the following: An operational amplifier will oscillate at the frequency at which its open loop gain equals its closed loop gain if, at that frequency, :# The open loop gain of the amplifier is ‚â• 1 and :# The difference between the phase of the open loop signal and phase response of the network creating the closed loop output = ‚àí180¬∞. Mathematically, :: Œ¶OL ‚Äì Œ¶CLnet = ‚àí180¬∞ = Practice = Frequency compensation is implemented by modifying the gain and phase characteristics of the amplifier's open loop output or of its feedback network, or both, in such a way as to avoid the conditions leading to oscillation. This is usually done by the internal or external use of resistance-capacitance networks. = Dominant-pole compensation = The method most commonly used is called dominant-pole compensation, which is a form of lag compensation. It is an external compensation technique and is used for relatively low closed loop gain. A pole placed at an appropriate low frequency in the open-loop response reduces the gain of the amplifier to one (0 dB) for a frequency at or just below the location of the next highest frequency pole. The lowest frequency pole is called the dominant pole because it dominates the effect of all of the higher frequency poles. The result is that the difference between the open loop output phase and the phase response of a feedback network having no reactive elements never falls below ‚àí180¬∞ while the amplifier has a gain of one or more, ensuring stability. Dominant-pole compensation can be implemented for general purpose operational amplifiers by adding an integrating capacitance to the stage that provides the bulk of the amplifier's gain. This capacitor creates a pole that is set at a frequency low enough to reduce the gain to one (0 dB) at or just below the frequency where the pole next highest in frequency is located. The result is a phase margin of ‚âà 45¬∞, depending on the proximity of still higher poles. The dominant pole produces a phase shift approximating ‚àí90¬∞ from approx. 10 times the pole frequency to a frequency a factor of ten below the next higher pole position. The next higher pole, in turn, adds another ‚àí45¬∞ for a frequency at its location for a total of ‚àí135¬∞ (neglecting the still higher poles). This margin is sufficient to prevent oscillation in the most commonly used feedback configurations. In addition, dominant-pole compensation allows control of overshoot and ringing in the amplifier step response, which can be a more demanding requirement than the simple need for stability. This compensation method is described below: Let A be the uncompensated transfer function of op amp in open-loop configuration which is given by: Uncompensated Transfer Function of open loop Op-Amp where AOL=the Open loop gain of the Op-Amp w1, w2, w3= Frequencies at which gain rolls off by -20dB, -40dB and -60dB respectively. Thus, for compensation, introduce a dominant pole by adding an RC network in series with the Op-Amp as shown in the figure. Diagram of a dominant pole compensated open loop Op-Amp The Transfer function of the compensated open loop Op-Amp circuit is given by: TF after Dominant pole compensation where fd < f1 < f2 < f3 The compensation capacitance C is chosen such that fd < f1. Hence, the frequency response of a dominant pole compensated open loop Op-Amp circuit shows uniform gain roll off from fd and becomes 0 at f1 as shown in the graph. Frequency response in Dominant Pole compensation The advantages of dominant pole compensation are: 1\\\\. It is simple and effective. 2\\\\. Noise immunity is improved since noise frequency components outside the bandwidth are eliminated. Though simple and effective, this kind of conservative dominant pole compensation has two drawbacks: # It reduces the bandwidth of the amplifier, thereby reducing available open loop gain at higher frequencies. This, in turn, reduces the amount of feedback available for distortion correction, etc. at higher frequencies. # It reduces the amplifier's slew rate. This reduction results from the time it takes the finite current driving the compensated stage to charge the compensating capacitor. The result is the inability of the amplifier to reproduce high amplitude, rapidly changing signals accurately. Often, the implementation of dominant-pole compensation results in the phenomenon of Pole splitting. This results in the lowest frequency pole of the uncompensated amplifier \\"moving\\" to an even lower frequency to become the dominant pole, and the higher- frequency pole of the uncompensated amplifier \\"moving\\" to a higher frequency. To overcome these disadvantages, pole zero compensation is used. = Other methods = Some other compensation methods are: lead compensation, lead‚Äìlag compensation and feed-forward compensation. :Lead compensation. Whereas dominant pole compensation places or moves poles in the open loop response, lead compensation places a zeroIn this context, a zero is the point in a frequency response curve where the amplitude increases by 3db due to a differentiating resistance and capacitive reactance. Ultimately, each zero will result in a phase lead of 90¬∞, i.e., the phase of the output signal will be 90¬∞ ahead of the phase of the input signal at this point. For the mathematical concept of a zero, see, Zero (complex analysis). in the open loop response to cancel one of the existing poles. :Lead‚Äìlag compensation places both a zero and a pole in the open loop response, with the pole usually being at an open loop gain of less than one. :Feed-forward compensation uses a capacitor to bypass a stage in the amplifier at high frequencies, thereby eliminating the pole that stage creates. The purpose of these three methods is to allow greater open loop bandwidth while still maintaining amplifier closed loop stability. They are often used to compensate high gain, wide bandwidth amplifiers.

Monica came from a poor Montreal family, and many of her relatives were involved in crime; her grandmother served time in jail for receiving stolen goods, and reportedly ran a school for crime for the neighbourhood children in the Red-Light District. In 1956, at the age of 17, Monica married Anthony Smith, a Scottish gangster (he was 33). The couple had two children. Smith was deported from Canada in 1962. She then became romantically involved with Viateur Tessier, but he was jailed in 1966 for armed robbery. When she was 19 four of her seven siblings perished in a fire in downtown Montreal. The area had been purchased by the City of Montreal for future demolition for the Jeanne Mance public housing projects. The members of her crew included G√©rald Leli√®vre and his brother Robert, who made headlines in 1984 when he and three others were killed when a bomb was detonated in a downtown Montreal apartment building. The victims had been suspected in the murder of West End Gang kingpin Frank \\"Dunie\\" Ryan. Monica and her accomplices held up more than 20 banks, stealing over an estimated $100,000. On September 19, 1967 Monica died after crashing into a bus and being shot twice by an undercover police officer following a high-speed chase through the north-end of the city.

At 13 he was apprenticed to a barber, whom he served for six years. He then went to Edinburgh, where in 1771 he obtained the freedom of the city by joining the corporation of barber-surgeons. In 1784 he published his first caricature, of Laird Robertson. In 1785, induced by the favour which greeted certain attempts of his to etch in aquafortis, he took down his barber's pole and opened a small print shop in Parliament Close. There he continued to flourish, painting miniatures, and publishing at short intervals his sketches and caricatures of local celebrities and oddities, who abounded at that period in Edinburgh society. Kay's portraits were collected by Hugh Paton and published under the title A series of original portraits and caricature etchings by the late John Kay, with biographical sketches and illustrative anecdotes (Edinburgh, 2 vols. 4to, 1838; 8vo ed., 4 vols., 1842; new 4to ed., with additional plates, 2 vols., 1877), forming a unique record of the social life and popular habits of Edinburgh at its most interesting epoch.

In many cases, the condition continues to be difficult to diagnose and therefore benefits from a good understanding of the underlying cause. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of constrictive pericarditis are consistent with the following: fatigue, swollen abdomen, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), swelling of legs and general weakness. Related conditions are bacterial pericarditis, pericarditis and pericarditis after a heart attack. Causes The cause of constrictive pericarditis in the developing world are idiopathic in origin, though likely infectious in nature. In regions where tuberculosis is common, it is the cause in a large portion of cases. Tuberculosis-x-ray Causes of constrictive pericarditis include: * Tuberculosis * Incomplete drainage of purulent pericarditis * Fungal and parasitic infections * Chronic pericarditis * Postviral pericarditis * Postsurgical * Following MI, post-myocardial infarction * In association with pulmonary asbestos  Pathophysiology  The pathophysiological characteristics of constrictive pericarditis are due to a thickened, fibrotic pericardium that forms a non-compliant shell around the heart. This shell prevents the heart from expanding when blood enters it. This results in significant respiratory variation in blood flow in the chambers of the heart. During inspiration, pressure in the thoracic cavity decreases but is not relayed to the left atrium, subsequently a reduction in flow to the left atrium and ventricle happens. During diastole, less blood flow in left ventricle allows for more room for filling in right ventricle and therefore a septal shift occurs. During expiration, the amount of blood entering the left ventricle will increase, allowing the interventricular septum to bulge towards the right ventricle, decreasing the right heart ventricular filing.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is often difficult to make. In particular, restrictive cardiomyopathy has many similar clinical features to constrictive pericarditis, and differentiating them in a particular individual is often a diagnostic dilemma. * Chest X-Ray - pericardial calcification (common but not specific), pleural effusions are common findings. * Echocardiography - the principal echographic finding is changes in cardiac chamber volume. * CT and MRI - CT scan is useful in assessing the thickness of pericardium, calcification, and ventricular contour. Cardiac MRI may find pericardial thickening and pericardial- myocardial adherence. Ventricular septum shift during breathing can also be found using cardiac MRI. Late gadolinium enhancement can show enhancement of the pericardium due to fibroblast proliferation and neovascularization. * BNP blood test - tests for the existence of the cardiac hormone brain natriuretic peptide, which is only present in RCMP but not in CP * Conventional cardiac catheterization * Physical examination - can reveal clinical features including Kussmaul's sign and a pericardial knock.  Treatment  The definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis is pericardial stripping, which is a surgical procedure where the entire pericardium is peeled away from the heart. This procedure has significant risk involved, with mortality rates of 6% or higher in major referral centers. A poor outcome is almost always the result after a pericardiectomy is performed for constrictive pericarditis whose origin was radiation-induced, further some patients may develop heart failure post-operatively.

The misuse doctrine provides that the copyright holder engaged in abusive or improper conduct in exploiting or enforcing the copyright will be precluded from enforcing his rights against the infringer. Copyright misuse is often comparable to and draws from the older and more established doctrine of patent misuse, which bars a patentee from obtaining relief for infringement when he extends his patent rights beyond the limited monopoly conferred by the law.Motion Pictures Patents Co v Universal Film Mfg Co., 243 U.S. 502 (1917); Morton Salt Co. v G.S. Superego Co., 312 U.S. 488 (1942) The doctrine forbids the copyright holder from attempting to extend the effect or operation of copyright beyond the scope of the statutory right. For example, by engaging in restrictive licensing practices that are contrary to the public policy underlying copyright law.Lasercomb America, Inc. v Reynolds, 911 F.2d 970 (4th Cir. 1990) In fact, the misuse doctrine is said to have evolved to tackle such aggressive licensing practices. Requirements Although the doctrine of copyright misuse has not yet been delineated, several circuits have upheld the defence on the following policy grounds ‚Äì # The plaintiff has violated antitrust laws # The plaintiff used the copyright in a manner violative of the public policy of copyright law Difference from Fair Use Fair use defence to copyright infringement allows unauthorised use of copyrighted work in a reasonable manner under certain circumstances. The following are some of the facets that distinguish the misuse doctrine from fair use ‚Äì # Fair use is statutorily recognised in 17 USC ¬ß 107, whereas copyright misuse is yet to receive statutory support; and # The defendant must prove that his unauthorised use of copyrighted work qualifies for a fair use exception, whereas the defendant need not suffer directly from the misuse to successfully claim an exception to copyright infringement. In the United States Although the misuse doctrine was a well-known defence in patent infringement cases, it was extended to copyright law in M. Witmark & Sons v Jensen for the first time.80 F. Supp. 843 (D. Minn. 1948) Consequently, copyright misuse was adopted by various circuit courts in recent years. However, the contours of the doctrine remain uncertain as it is yet to be explicitly recognised by the United States Supreme Court. Some scholars have even advocated for the codification of the misuse doctrine. = Lasercomb America, Inc. v Reynolds = In Lasercomb America, Inc. v Reynolds,supra note 3 at 975 (\\"the public policy behind the grant of copyright and patent is essentially the same\\") the Fourth Circuit became the first appellate court to uphold a copyright misuse defence as analogous to the patent misuse defence. In this case, Lasercomb had sued Reynolds for making unauthorised copies of its die-making software, which was subject to copyright protection. Reynolds alleged that Lasercomb had misused its copyright by imposing unreasonable non-compete clause that restricted creating a competing product for a period of one hundred years in its standard licensing agreement.supra note 3 at 973 The Court ruled that although the inclusion of such a provision did not constitute an antitrust violation, it did violate the public policy underlying copyright and rendered Lasercomb‚Äôs copyright unenforceable. The Court also held that the defendant need not be subjected to the purported misuse in order to set up a valid defence as Reynolds had not signed the standard licensing agreement.supra note 3 at 979 Lastly, the Court clarified that Lasercomb was free to initiate a suit for infringement once it has purged itself of the misuse and its copyright was not invalidated.ibid. = Practice Management Information Corp. v American Medical Association = The Ninth Circuit was the next circuit to adopt the copyright misuse doctrine in Practice Management Information Corp. v American Medical Association.121 F.3d 516 (9th Cir. 1997) In this case, American Medical Association granted Health Care Financing Administration (now known as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) a non-exclusive, royalty-free perpetual license to use its coding system for medical procedures.Ibid. at 517 However, the license was restricted, as no other coding system could be used.supra note 11 at 520-521 Practice Management, a publisher and distributor of medical books, filed for declaratory relief to have the copyright invalidated when it failed to procure the volume discounted it requested.supra note 11 at 521 The Court refused to invalidate the copyright but ruled that the licensing provision requiring exclusive use of the coding system constituted copyright misuse.ibid. = Alcatel USA Inc. v DGI Technologies Inc. = The Fifth Circuit upheld the defence of copyright misuse in Alcatel USA, Inc. v DGI Technologies, Inc.166 F.3d 772 (5th Cir. 1999) Alcatel licensed the use of its software only along with its manufactured equipment.ibid. at 777 The terms of the license banned downloading or copying Alcatel‚Äôs software. However, DGI downloaded and copied Alcatel‚Äôs software in violation of the licensing agreement in order to ensure compatibility with its product.supra note 16 at 778 In a suit for infringement of copyright, DGI claimed misuse of copyright by Alcatel.supra note 16 796 The Court found Alcatel to have exceeded the scope of the copyright grant to gain an extended monopoly, which effectively constituted a copyright misuse. = Assessment Technologies of WI, LLC v WIREdata Inc. = The doctrine of copyright misuse was upheld by the Seventh Circuit in Assessment Technologies of WI, LLC v WIREdata Inc,350 F.3d 640 (7th Cir. 2003) which is another case involving computer software. In this case, WIREdata sought public information about a number of properties from the Wisconsin municipalities. The information was collected by the municipalities and compiled using the plaintiff‚Äôs software for tax assessment purposes. Hence, some municipalities refused to furnish the information for fear of infringing Assessment Technologies‚Äô copyright.ibid. at 642 WIREdata, the defendants in this case, sued in state court for the release of information and Assessment Technologies sued in federal court, claiming that the release would violate its copyright. The Court held that the conduct of the plaintiff amounted to copyright misuse as the information withheld by the municipalities were beyond the purview of the said copyright. = Video Pipeline, Inc. v Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Inc. = In Video Pipeline, Inc. v Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Inc.,342 F.3d 191 (3d. Cir 2003) the Third Circuit stated that a copyright holder might commit misuse in trying to enforce a license that prohibit criticism of copyright-protected works. Video Pipeline had an agreement with Disney, which allowed it to compile more than 500 movie trailers. When Video Pipeline started to post the trailers online, Disney asked Video Pipeline to remove the trailers, as they were not covered by the terms of the license. Although Video Pipeline complied with Disney‚Äôs request, it sought a declaratory relief that its use of trailers online did not in any manner violate Disney‚Äôs copyright. Additionally, Video Pipeline amended the plaint to seek declaratory relief to use two minute video clip review it created out of sixty two movies. Disney, which owned Buena Vista, filed a counterclaim for copyright infringement in response to the suit. The Court observed that the doctrine is yet to be affirmatively expressed by the United States Supreme Court and that the licensing terms were reasonable. Accordingly, the Court ultimately ruled that the doctrine was inapplicable to the factual matrix of this case. This case has assumed significance because it was decided in a circuit wherein Redbox sued three major studios, namely Universal, Walter and Fox. In India India has incorporated fair dealing provisions into its domestic law, which provides important limitations to copyright holders‚Äô rights. The doctrine of copyright misuse has not received any statutory support much like in the United States. = Tekla Corporation v Survo Ghosh = In Tekla Corporation and Ors. v Survo Ghosh and Ors., the Delhi High Court ruled that the defence of copyright misuse was not available to the defendants either in a suit for permanent injunction from infringing a plaintiff‚Äôs copyright or in an action for damages for copyright infringement. In 2011, the plaintiffs had initiated a suit for copyright infringement against the defendants for unauthorized usage of its software. Instead of invoking any of the exemptions under Section 52 of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957, the defendants contested that the plaintiffs were precluded from claiming remedies for infringement as their conduct constituted copyright misuse. It was alleged that the plaintiffs had been charging an exorbitant fee alongside imposing ‚Äòunreasonable' conditions as a part of their licensing agreements. However, the Court was not persuaded by the American jurisprudence on this subject and refused to recognize the doctrine of copyright misuse, as it would amount to adding more grounds than what the statute already provided.ibid. para 16 The Court was also concerned about the implications of the doctrine on judicial delays in enforcement of copyright if it were to be adopted in India.supra note 24 at para 25 Nonetheless, the Court is said to have missed an opportunity to engage with copyright policy prevalent in India.
