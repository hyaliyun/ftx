Subject to Financial Services Authority (FSA) approval, Royal Liver and its subsidiaries became part of the Royal London Group on 1 July 2011. History The Liverpool Lyver Burial Society was founded by a group of working men from Liverpool in the Lyver Inn on 24 July 1850 to \\"provide for the decent interment of deceased members\\". By 1857 the Society had moved to its fourth head office and had expanded throughout the United Kingdom. By the end of the 1890s a decision was taken to build what would become the Royal Liver Building; it opened on 19 July 1911. William Field was a Managing Director of Royal Livers Friendly Society in 1911. His Father, John Field, born 1820 was an agent for the Society by 1860. William Field is pictured in the 150 year Commemorate Book put out by the Society. It is believed that one of the pillars of the Royal Liver Building has the family Motto \\"Fair Field No Favours\\" on it. William Field died in 1916 while still employed by the Society. It is believed that others of the Field family were also involved with the management of the Society during this time. During the 20th century, Royal Liver Assurance expanded to cover the whole of Ireland and the UK. Today, Royal Liver Assurance employs around 900 people, has approximately 3.4 million policies in force for 1.7 million members and manages more than £3.7 billion in funds. The Royal Liver Assurance has operated a delegation system since 1886; today, there are about 230 or so elected delegates. The Royal Liver Poetry of Place competition sees schoolchildren write poems about their favourite Liverpool places, which are voted for by the public via the Royal Liver website. Liver Legends include the late, great Scott Hodge who famously danced naked on the Royal Iris on 23 December 1989 for the Liver Xmas Afternoon Party and Norman \\"Normal\\" Edge, the most eccentric man ever. Royal Liver Group At the time of its acquisition by the Royal London Group in 2011 The Royal Liver Group consisted of: * Royal Liver Assurance Limited (RLAL), an Incorporated Friendly Society, founded in Liverpool in 1850 for the mutual benefit and financial security of local families. RLAL also traded under the names Progress (in the UK) and Caledonian Life (in Ireland). RLAL had two subsidiary companies: * Royal Liver Asset Managers in the UK * Citadel Financial Advice Limited in Ireland. Royal Liver previously had a financial advisor company called Park Row, however this was wound up following an investigation by the FSA. Although owned by Royal Liver, Citadel is an independent company offering financial advice on a wide range of issues and financial services in Ireland. Takeover In 2007, Royal London approached Royal Liver about a possible combination of their businesses, but Royal Liver decided to remain as an independent entity.Royal London press release – 15 August 2007 Since then, however, the financial downturn hit the insurance industry hard. The FSA launched Project Chrysalis, aimed at mutual insurance companies. Companies were asked to hold more capital, and to either stop writing new policies, or justify that continuing selling new business wouldn't put existing policyholders at a disadvantage. At the time, it was anticipated that several mutuals would merge due to lack of capital.FT Advisor – Rival mutuals look at merger for survival Royal Liver were then approached again by Royal London in February 2010.CityAM – Royal London and Liver in merger talks Talks continued for some time, and the board of Royal Liver agreed the terms of a potential merger in April 2011.CityWire – Royal London and Royal Liver agree takeover terms The delegates of Royal Liver voted in favour of the merger at the AGM on 12 May 2011.Royal Liver press release – Delegates vote YES The transfer to Royal London was completed on 1 July 2011.

Kaneko as :{Li_{k}(1-e^{-x}) over 1-e^{-x}}=sum_{n=0}^{infty}B_{n}^{(k)}{x^{n}over n!} where Li is the polylogarithm. The B_{n}^{(1)} are the usual Bernoulli numbers. Moreover, the Generalization of Poly-Bernoulli numbers with a,b,c parameters defined as follows :{Li_{k}(1-(ab)^{-x})over b^x-a^{-x}}c^{xt}=sum_{n=0}^{infty}B_{n}^{(k)}(t;a,b,c){x^{n}over n!} where Li is the polylogarithm. Kaneko also gave two combinatorial formulas: :B_{n}^{(-k)}=sum_{m=0}^{n}(-1)^{m+n}m!S(n,m)(m+1)^{k}, :B_{n}^{(-k)}=sum_{j=0}^{min(n,k)} (j!)^{2}S(n+1,j+1)S(k+1,j+1), where S(n,k) is the number of ways to partition a size n set into k non-empty subsets (the Stirling number of the second kind). A combinatorial interpretation is that the poly-Bernoulli numbers of negative index enumerate the set of n by k (0,1)-matrices uniquely reconstructible from their row and column sums. For a positive integer n and a prime number p, the poly-Bernoulli numbers satisfy :B_n^{(-p)} equiv 2^n pmod p, which can be seen as an analog of Fermat's little theorem. Further, the equation :B_x^{(-n)} + B_y^{(-n)} = B_z^{(-n)} has no solution for integers x, y, z, n > 2; an analog of Fermat's last theorem.

Purpose of the visiting mission  The mission intended to investigate the political situation in the Spanish Sahara, as well as the conflicting claims to the territory: * Spain had administered the Spanish Sahara since the Berlin Congress in 1884, but had announced it was pulling out of the territory. A Madrid-backed political party, the Partido de Unión Nacional Saharaui (PUNS), argued for a gradual transition to independence and demanded privileged relations between Spain and a future Western Sahara. * The Polisario Front, an indigenous anti-colonial organization that was waging a guerrilla war against Spanish forces since 1973, claimed the country for its inhabitants, the Sahrawis, and demanded immediate independence. * Morocco invoked historical ties between its royal family and the Sahrawi tribes, claiming the territory as its Southern Provinces. * Mauritania referred to common ethnicity (of Sahrawis and Moors) and historical territorial connections, to claim it as a northern part of the country; Tiris al-Gharbiyya. * The United Nations had since 1966 demanded that a referendum among the native population should determine the future status of the territory.  The mission  The mission was composed of three members. Its head was Simeon Aké, UN ambassador of the Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast); accompanying him were Marta Jiménez Martinez, a Cuban diplomat, and Manouchehr Pishva, from Iran. It toured Spanish Sahara on May 12–19, 1975, after initially having been denied entry by Spanish authorities. On May 8–12 and again on May 20–22, it visited Madrid, Spain; and from May 28 to June 1, it toured the neighbouring countries Mauritania, Morocco and Algeria; in Algeria - which supported the Polisario since late 1974 - it also met with leaders of the Polisario Front.  Findings of the mission  =Moroccan Sahara= In the territory, the mission encountered opposing demonstrations by the Polisario Front and the PUNS, both demanding independence, but differing in their approach to the Spanish authorities. Tony Hodges writes: :During its visit to the territory,\\" [the UN mission] reported, \\"the mission did not encounter any groups supporting the territorial claims of neighbouring countries and consequently had no say of estimating the extent of their support, which appeared to be submerged by the massive demonstrations in favour of independence. ::and :Although the mission met privately with a number of groups in the northern region representing PUNS,\\" the UN envoys noted, \\"it did not witness any separate public demonstrations in support of that party. This was in marked contrast to the Frente Polisario, whose supporters from the onset appeared en masse carrying the flags and emblems of their movement. It was not until the mission visited the southern region that PUNS, following the example of its opponents, organized mass demonstrations to greet the mission at each place visited.\\" ::and :At Villa Cisneros and other settlements in the south, Polisario and PUNS supporters staged separate, rival demonstrations, but \\"although both groups mustered a large number of supporters,\\" the mission noted, \\"the preponderance was clearly in favour of the Frente Polisario.\\" The placards of Polisario and PUNS were \\"similar,\\" for \\"both demanded complete independence for the territory and opposed integration with neighbouring countries.\\" ::and :Owing to the large measure of cooperation which it received from the Spanish authorities, the Mission was able, despite the shortness of its stay in the Territory, to visit virtually all the main population centers and to ascertain the views of the ovverwhelming majority of their inhabitants. At every place visited, the Mission was met by mass political demonstrations and had numerous private meetings with representatives of every section of the Saharan community. From all these, it became evident to the Mission that there was an overwhelming consensus among Saharans within the Territory in favour of independence and opposing integration with any neighbouring country [...] The Mission believes, in the light of what it witnessed in the Territory, especially the mass demonstrations of support for one movement, the Frente Polisario [...] that its visit served as a catalyst to bring into the open political forces and pressures which had previously been largely submerged. It was all the more significant to the Mission that this came as a surprise to the Spanish authorities who, until then, had only been partly aware of the profound political awakening of the population. The mission estimated the largest demonstration they witnessed, \\"organized by the Frente Polisario\\", in El-Aaiun on May 13, 1975, to have consisted of 15,000 people - significant, since a 1974 census by the Spanish authorities had set the total population at just below 75,000 people. =Surrounding nations= * In Mauritania, the mission met with President Moktar Ould Daddah in Nouakchott, where he reiterated his demand for the integration of the territory into Mauritania. The mission also travelled to the northern towns of Atar, Zouerate, Bir Moghrein, and Nouadhibou, where they witnessed \\"large rival demonstrations\\" by the Parti du Peuple Mauritanien (PPM; Ould Daddah's ruling party) and the Polisario Front. * In Fes, King Hassan II repeated the Moroccan claim to the territory, and the mission witnessed \\"large pro-annexation demonstrations in towns in the far south of the country, near the Western Saharan border\\" that \\"left in no doubt [...] the depth of popular support in Morocco for Hassan's campaign of 'reunification,' as well as his governments determination to achieve its objectives. The mission was informed that Morocco would not accept the inclusion of independence among the options to be put to the Western Saharans in a referendum. The only acceptable question was: 'Do you want to remain under the authority of Spain or to rejoin Morocco?'\\" * In Algeria, President Houari Boumedienne stated that \\"Algeria had no interest in Western Sahara other than to see the Sahrawi's right to self-determination respected\\". The mission also visited the Sahrawi communities in Tindouf, Oum el-Assel and Hassi Abdallah in Algeria, where they \\"were met by thousands of pro-POLISARIO demonstrators\\" and were shown Spanish officers of the Tropas Nómadas, held as prisoners-of-war by POLISARIO forces. POLISARIO General-Secretary El-Ouali Mustapha Sayed stated that \\"a referendum was unnecessary since it was now evident that the majority of Saharawis wanted independence, but [...] said that that they would accept one, if the UN insisted, on condition that the Spanish administration had first been withdrawn and replaced by a 'national' administration, that all Spanish troops had been withdrawn and replaced by POLISARIO soldiers under UN and Arab League guarantees, and that all refugees had been allowed to return to the territory\\". Consequences of the mission report The mission presented its report to the United Nations on October 15, 1975. The results of the investigation were cited especially by the Polisario Front and its Algerian backers as supportive of their argument, but the debate was largely submerged by the presentation of the opinion of the International Court of Justice on October 16. The court argued that while there were historical ties between both Mauritania and Morocco to the tribes and lands of Spanish Sahara, neither country's claim sufficed to grant it ownership of the territory. The court also ruled that the Sahrawis possessed a right of self- determination, meaning that any solution to the problem of the status of Spanish Sahara had to be approved by the Sahrawi public. (A position regarded as supportive of the referendum.) As a response to the ICJ verdict, King Hassan II of Morocco announced within hours of the release of the court's findings, that he would organize a Green March into Spanish Sahara to assume ownership of the territory.

He was better known by his professional name Mr. Sebastian. Career Originally an art teacher, Alan Oversby left his initial profession to pursue his interests in tattooing and piercing instead. From his studio in London, he promoted both tattooing and body piercing, especially within the gay leather community. He was a correspondent of both Doug Malloy and Jim Ward. Sponsored by Malloy, he visited Los Angeles. Malloy also sponsored trips to London to visit him, bringing along Ward and Sailor Sid Diller. These exchanges were critical to the global spread of the techniques and technology used in contemporary body piercing. Oversby was also responsible for the adoption of the use of topical and local anesthetics as part piercing procedure in Europe. Although they are used less now, it used to be standard practice to use anesthetics when performing piercings in England, where in North America this practice is almost unknown. He was interviewed in the fourth issue of PFIQ. He performed much of the tattooing and piercing on Psychic TV musicians Genesis P-Orridge and Paula P-Orridge. His vocals were used in the Psychic TV track \\"Message from The Temple\\" which appeared on their first album Force the Hand of Chance. Operation Spanner In 1987, Alan Oversby was one of 16 men charged as a part of Operation Spanner, a series of raids that resulted in the arrest of men who were all engaged in consensual homosexual BDSM activities. Alan, like the other men, was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm for performing a genital piercing on a client. He was also charged with using anaesthetic without a licence and for sending obscene material through the post (photographs of piercings). As the judge was not willing to take the consensuality of the participants into account, Alan pleaded guilty along with the other 15 men. He received a sentence of 15 months, which was suspended for two years. References * Modern Primitives. Re/Search Publications.

Named after the star Grumium in the constellation Draco, it was the only ship of the Navy to bear this name. Construction Grumium was laid down under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MCE hull 443, on 12 November 1942, as the liberty ship SS William G. McAdoo, by the Permanente Metals Corporation, Yard No. 2, in Richmond, California. She was launched on 20 December 1942, sponsored by Mrs. T. Y. Sturtevant. William G. McAdoo was acquired by the Navy on 5 October 1943. The ship was converted for Navy use by the Todd Shipyards in Seattle, Washington and commissioned on 20 October 1943, with Lieutenant Commander B. J. Parylak in command. Service history Grumium loaded supplies at San Francisco 9 November, and got underway from San Pedro 19 November 1943, bound for Pago Pago. The ship unloaded drum gas there and at Funafuti 8 to 11 December, after which she proceeded to Kwajalein 6 March, and Eniwetok 15 March, delivering oil and aviation fuel. After another stop at Kwajalein 26 to 28 April, Grumium returned to San Francisco via Pearl Harbor, arriving in California 27 May 1944. = Conversion = At San Francisco Grumium was transferred to the direct control of Commander, Naval Air Forces, Pacific Fleet, and underwent conversion to an aviation support ship. She was redesignated IX-174, 20 June 1944, and 2 days later was underway for Pearl Harbor once more, to supply American fast carrier aircraft, then increasing greatly in numbers.  Late war service  Grumium arrived Pearl Harbor 30 June, and 10 July, continued to Roi Island. Arriving 19 July, the ship transferred supplies to aircraft groups until early September, then returned to Pearl Harbor. She sailed with another load of aviation supplies 28 September, calling at Ulithi and Eniwetok before arriving at Manus on 17 November. There she supplied carrier forces making the supporting strikes for the Philippine campaign, as America’s great island offensive gained momentum. Remaining at Manus until 5 December 1944, Grumium sailed to a closer advance base, Ulithi, arriving four days later. From Ulithi the ship supported the far reaching air raids on the Philippines, Okinawa, and Formosa in the months to come. As US forces moved ever north and west, supplies had to be moved into new advance bases, and Grumium sailed 14 January 1945, to bring up aviation supplies from Manus to Ulithi. Then she made a similar voyage to Roi Island before moving her supply base to Guam 16 March 1945. The ship was soon to carry her support activities to the assault area itself, however, and rendezvoused with an Okinawa-bound convey at Saipan 23 March. = Supporting Okinawa invasion operations = As American forces went ashore at Okinawa 1 April, and began that campaign, Grumium made preparations to supply the cruising carrier groups from Kerama Retto, near Okinawa. Arriving 2 April, she serviced the escort carrier groups protecting the landing and providing group support. Japanese forces were determined to defeat the assault and quickly expanded suicide attacks against the assembled ships. Grumium came under air attack at Kerama Retto 6–7 April; of the many planes destroyed she helped shoot down one. She also rescued survivors from a suicide crash on 28 April, and a bomb hit on 30 April. While Grumium was at Kerama Retto, a special designation for aviation supply ships was established; and she became AVS-3 on 25 May 1945. She departed the Okinawa area 6 June, arrived Guam 14 June, and arrived Eniwetok to supply the carrier forces 1 July 1945. Grumium remained there during and after the final operations of the war providing vital supplies until departing for the Hawaiian Islands 12 October. Stopping briefly at Pearl Harbor, she arrived Norfolk via the Panama Canal 25 November, for deactivation. Decommissioned 20 December 1945, she was redelivered to the Maritime Commission 27 December 1945.  Inactivation and decommissioning  The ship was subsequently laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, James River Group, Lee Hall, Virginia. Grumium, along with the Liberty ship SS George Pomutz, was sold for $203,600, on 17 April 1970, to N. V. Intershita. She was delivered 18 May 1970, and subsequently sold to Salvamento y Demolicion Naval S. A., Barcelona, Spain, for scrapping, completed, 27 October 1970.

It opened in 1859. Other companies' lines extended westwards and southwards, and the CD&D; line formed a key link in opening up the agricultural area of south-west Scotland. When Stranraer and Portpatrick were reached by the contiguous lines, the CD&D; line was the eastern section of the Port Road, which provided an important route from English originating points to Northern Ireland by ferry between Portpatrick and Donaghadee. Much later the ferry route was from Stranraer to Larne. The CD&DR; was absorbed by the larger Glasgow and South Western Railway in 1865. The line was one of the 1965 Beeching closures, except for a stub from Dumfries to Maxwelltown Oil Terminal which continued until 1994, although it was dormant in the latter years. Nothing now remains of the rail activity on the line. History =Authorisation and construction= In the middle of the nineteenth century the counties of Galloway, Wigtownshire and KirkcudbrightshireNow all part of the administrative Region of Dumfries and Galloway. were devoted to agriculture, but lacked efficient land communications links with the rest of the United Kingdom. Mail from the northern part of England, and Scotland, to Ireland passed this way through the ports of Portpatrick and Donaghadee, but the poor roads made the passage difficult. The Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway (GD&CR;) was authorised in 1846 and the authorisation appears to have included a branch from Dumfries to Kirkcudbright, but the shortage of money at that time led to abandonment of the plans for the branch.First Report of the Directors of the Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway, quoted in Fryer. The opening of the Chester and Holyhead Railway in 1850 induced the Post Office to transfer the mail to that route.The transfer was done in September 1849, at which stage the Holyhead line had been opened as far as Bangor. In the same year the GD&CR; merged with other lines to form the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;). The directors of the G&SWR; sought to open up the area, with a view to regaining the mail traffic in due course. The G&SWR; also wished to forestall any incursion into the area by the rival Caledonian Railway. The G&SWR; line passed through Dumfries on its route from Carlisle to Glasgow, and the Company had a line from Glasgow to Ayr. Both points were a considerable distance from Portpatrick, and when local interests promoted a railway connecting Castle Douglas to Dumfries, the G&SWR; encouraged the scheme, seeing it as a first step in its plans. The G&SWR; encouragement took tangible form in a subscription of £60,000, which was half of the proposed capital of the scheme. Local interests found the remainder, and a Bill was presented to Parliament; it attracted little opposition and the authorising Act for the Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway was passed on 21 July 1856.Awdry states on page 66 that the Act was \\"obtained\\" by the G&SWR; but this must be a misunderstanding of the earlier abortive GD&CR; branch proposal. The Castle Douglas Company was nominally independent, and its shareholding and directors are recited in contemporary accounts. The line was to be a little over 19 miles (31 km) long. Construction proceeded quickly, but the authorised capital proved insufficient for completion, and an additional £24,000 in 6% preference shares was authorised by Parliament in the 1859 session; the G&SWR; subscribed all of the additional capital, becoming the majority shareholder.CD&GR; Bill, described in General Report of the Board of Trade of the Railway and Canal Bills of the Session 1859 =Opening= The CD&DR; system at opening, with important (later) lines shownThe line opened on 7 November 1859 and was immediately commercially successful; the preference share dividend was paid in full and sufficient surplus enabled a 1% dividend to be paid on ordinary shares in the first full year. The line was operated from the outset by the G&SWR.; In 1861 the Portpatrick Railway completed a connection from Castle Douglas to Stranraer and Portpatrick, and through traffic ran from Carlisle and points south and east over the CD&DR; line. The Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway was amalgamated with the Glasgow and South Western Railway on 1 August 1865, by the terms of the G.&S.W.R.; Amalgamation Act of 5 July 1865. In the twentieth century the amalgamated G&SWR; formed part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in the 1923 grouping of the railways. The Caledonian Railway gained running powers over the line between Dumfries and Castle Douglas, which allowed it access to Portpatrick, Stranraer and Stranraer harbour over a jointly owned line, the Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Joint Railway. These running rights allowed the Caledonian Railway to run Irish boat trains from Carlisle and south of the border, considerably shortening the former longer route though Ayrshire. =Closure= The line was substantially closed, under the Beeching Axe, on 14 June 1965. The section between Maxwelltown and Dumfries remained open to serve an oil depot, but this section of line has now been lifted and is a cycleway/footpath. Dalbeattie accident, 1874 There was a collision on the single line in 1874. In Tales of the Glasgow and South Western Railway, Smith records that > All west of Lochanhead was single line then. A G.&S.W.; ballast train had > the staff and was working in the section to Castle Douglas. A westbound > Caledonian goods was given a ticket, and about a mile west of Dalbeattie met > the ballast [train] returning. Three of the enginemen were killed. Of > course, staff and ticket working was absolutely foolproof. The tickets were > in a locked box, openable only by the key on the end of the staff. But then, > nobody ever used the key on the end of the staff; the point of the standard > office poker fitted the lock exactly.Under the Train Staff and Ticket system > of working single lines, possession of the train staff (a physical object > marked with the stations between which it was valid) was a guarantee that no > train would approach in the opposing direction.

If Smith's narrative is correct, the personnel at Dalbeattie > issued the ticket recklessly, and the driver of the Caledonian goods train > failed to insist on seeing the train staff, which should have been his > guarantee. Smith amplifies the detail in his The Little Railways of South-West Scotland: The goods train was the 11:30 a.m. from Dumfries to Stranraer; Driver John Robb received a ticket at Lochanhead; asked if he had seen the staff \\"he could not remember clearly\\". At Kirkgunzeon he received a ticket again, and was not shown the staff. At Dalbeattie he went through the station slowly and William Douglas, a 16-year-old goods clerk, handed Robb a ticket; Robb said that he asked him, \\"Is that all right?\\" and Douglas replied, \\"Yes, go on.\\" Douglas later said that he knew nothing of the ballast train, but when the goods train arrived, he found the book of tickets lying open on the desk; he wrote out the ticket and gave it to Robb. The ballast train was returning to Dalbeattie, running down a gradient of 1 in 100 with little forward visibility. The collision was inevitable; both engine drivers died. Topography The line left Dumfries station curving immediately westwards and south-westwards, through difficult terrain.

The protein is part of a system whose main function is to catalyze the accumulation and transport of lactose and other beta-galactosides across the permeable barrier of a membrane.  MelB carrier protein and its properties  Beta-galactoside permeases can describe any transport proteins that enable a cell to uptake, and thus accumulate, beta-galactosides. One known example of these transport proteins is the melibiose, or melB, carrier protein derived from the melB gene of E. coli. This strain of beta-galactoside permease is known it transport melibiose and other galactosides across the cell membrane using hydrogen, sodium, or lithium ions in cotransport.  Involvement of the phosphatidic acid cycle  Early studies by Hiroshi Nikaido in 1962 suggest a direct relationship between the amount of beta-galactoside permease activity in a cell and the turnover rate of phospholipids in E. coli. In his experiments with gram-positive and gram- negative bacterial cells under varying conditions, the level of P32 in phospholipids was found to be increased under conditions of maximal activity in beta-galactoside permease. Insofar, Nikaido concluded that this correlation suggested that phospholipids are involved in the process of transporting beta- galactosides through the cell membrane. However, later research in 1965 by Alvin Tarlov and Eugene Kennedy using carbon tracers reveals increased levels of glycerol and serine, in addition to those of phosphorus, in the presence of increasing levels of beta-galactoside accumulation. The existence of these otherwise inert amino acids in relation to increasing levels of galactosides indicates a far less direct correlation between increasing levels of permease activity with increasing amounts of inorganic phosphate in the cell.

The weapon was to serve as a replacement for the Short Magazine Lee–Enfield (SMLE). An advanced designed chamber allowed for a high-velocity .276 Enfield rimless round, which was more powerful than the service-issued .303 British cartridge. However, implementation of the P'13 was rendered impractical by the outbreak of the First World War. History During the Second Boer War, the British Army had been faced with expert Boer marksmen equipped with the Mauser Model 1895, in 7×57mm caliber. This experience prompted the War Office to develop its own \\"magnum\\" round in 1910, using a .276-calibre rimless cartridge. In August 1910, the Small Arms Committee, which had been responsible for the adoption of the Short Magazine Lee–Enfield, was asked by the Director of Artillery to produce a new specification for a service rifle. The main changes called for a Mauser-style action and a one-piece stock (a cheaper and more serviceable option). In response, Birmingham Small Arms (BSA) submitted a design chambered for a rimless high-velocity cartridge. In 1911, the Royal Small Arms Factory (RSAF) at Enfield, the British Government's design and production facility, produced a modified Mauser-pattern rifle for a similar cartridge, the .276. This rifle was presented to the Small Arms Committee on 3 April 1911 by the Assistant Superintendent Carnegie, and the Chief Designer Reavill. rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge for which the Pattern 1913 Enfield action was designed. Initially the RSAF designed the new rifle, at this point the Pattern 1911, around two calibres; the .276 and the .256. The .256 was found to be inaccurate and the .276 was adopted in mid-1911 for further testing. Problems with pressure and jacket fouling in the bore resulting from the high velocity round led to the cartridge being redesigned.http://www.milsurps.com/content.php?r=191-Pattern-1913-(.276)-Trials- Rifle-(Mfg-by-R.S.A.F.-Enfield) Numerous changes to the rifle and the cartridge led to eleven Pattern 1911 and Pattern 1912 rifles being manufactured. At the end of 1912, it was decided to put the latest incarnation of the design into limited production for troop trials in 1913 and 1,000 were ordered from RSAF. By the end of 1912, 508 rifles had been completed, and by the end of January 1913, 1,251 had been manufactured. The rifle was distributed to the army as the Rifle, Magazine, Enfield, .276-inch. The troop trial rifles left handed rifling twist rate was , 5 grooves, groove depth land width . The trials took place in Britain, Ireland, Egypt and South Africa and at the end, the Chief Inspector of Small Arms recommended a number of changes, which resulted in a quantity of 6 improved Pattern 1913 rifles being manufactured between March and April 1914. The outbreak of World War I led to the abandonment of the effort to introduce a smaller caliber rimless cartridge for purely practical reasons. Adapting the design (with largely cosmetic alterations aside from chamber and extractor redesign) to fire the standard .303 British round led to the Pattern 14 Rifle (P'14), which was fed from a five-round internal magazine by five-round stripper clips. Effective mass production in Britain during World War I was impossible, and so the P'14 became a de facto afterthought. Thus, the SMLE remained the standard British rifle during World War I and beyond. Design The Pattern 1913 Enfield was mainly based on the Mauser line of bolt action rifles. Engineering concepts found in the German Gewehr 98 and American M1903 Springfield service rifle bolt actions were combined with design features of the British Short Magazine Lee–Enfield Mk III service rifle. The design of the Pattern 1913 Enfield showed the emphasis on accurate, rapid fire emphasized by British Army training during this period. The adjustable flip-up aperture rear sight with a battle setting when folded down was an excellent design, allowing rapid and accurate sight acquisition, and was advanced for the period. The Mauser-type bolt had a low-profile bolt handle with an integral safety lug built into its base that locked in the receiver. The unusual 'dog-leg' shaped bolt handle has a low profile and places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger close to the firer's hand, again facilitating rapid cycling and fire. Like the Lee–Enfield, the safety falls under the firer's thumb and can be operated silently. The action was configured to be easily operable, even when heated by sustained rapid fire, with slick operation, cock-on-closing feature and positive camming action when opening or closing the bolt. The Pattern 1913 Enfield bolt locking lugs had a 4 degree helical angle with matching angles on the receiver lug seats (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final head space is not achieved until the bolt handle is turned down all the way. The Lee–Enfield rifle also featured helical locking surfaces. The British probably used helical locking lugs to allow for chambering imperfect or dirty ammunition and that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The angled lugs had no tendency to unwind with chamber pressure since the \\"angle of repose\\" of smooth, lubricated steel surfaces is approximately 8 degrees. One advantage was that when the bolt handle was turned up was that the lugs cleared each other immediately so full effort was applied to the extraction cam. The trigger had a mechanical interlock to prevent firing unless the bolt was fully locked. The nickel-steel action was large and strong and had a long bolt throw compared to other military service rifle bolt actions, since it had to be capable of handling the dimensionally large .276 Enfield cartridge variants, and the barrel was given a heavy profile. The Pattern 1913 Enfield like the Mauser Gewehr 98 had no magazine cut-off mechanism, which when engaged permits the feeding and extraction of single cartridges only while keeping the cartridges in the magazine in reserve. It was a long and comparatively heavy rifle – the Lee-Enfield Mk III weighed empty – and the pronounced sight protector 'ears', the 'pot-belly' magazine and 'dog-leg' bolt handle gave it an ungainly air. The P13 is distinguished by unusual angled finger grooves on the fore end of the stock, which were not present on the later P14 and M1917. Some P'13s survived as target rifles in the UK, often having been \\"sporterized\\" (removal of wooden handguards and shortening of the stock). Very few were produced, and so very few survive.

The general structure is RR′C(X)C(=O)R where R is an alkyl or aryl residue and X any one of the halogens. The preferred conformation of a haloketone is that of a cisoid with the halogen and carbonyl sharing the same plane as the steric hindrance with the carbonyl alkyl group is generally larger.  Haloketone synthesis  *Haloketones and halo carbonyl compounds in general are synthesized by reaction of carbonyl compounds with halogenation agents: **Halogens, bromine and chlorine give monosubstitution, fluorine gives polysubstitution ** Tetrabutylammonium tribromide ** N-Bromosuccinimide **1,3-Dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DBDMH) *In the Hell–Volhard–Zelinsky halogenation a carboxylic acid reacts with bromine in presence of phosphorus tribromide. * In the Nierenstein reaction an acyl chloride reacts with diazomethane =Asymmetric synthesis= Efforts are reported in asymmetric synthesis of halocarbonyls through organocatalysis.

Acid chloride bromination reaction mechanism Dogo- Isonagie 2006  Haloketone reactions  Haloketones take part in several reaction types. In reaction with a nucleophile, two electrophilic sites are available and in reactions with a base several acidic protons exist due to the presence of two electron withdrawing groups. The carbon halogen bond experiences increases polarity from the inductive effect of the carbonyl group making the carbon atom more electropositive. * In nucleophilic aliphatic substitution reactions with potassium iodide in acetone, chloroacetone reacts faster than 1-chloropropane by a factor of 36,000. * In the Favorskii rearrangement a base abstracts first an acidic α-proton and the resulting carbanion then displaces the halogen. * The same sequence is observed in the Bingel reaction with fullerenes * In crossed aldol reactions between haloketones and aldehydes the initial reaction product is a halohydrin which can subsequently form an oxirane in the presence of base. * Haloketones are important in heterocyclic chemistry. An example is the use of haloketones in the Hantzsch pyrrole synthesis and the Hantzsch thiazole synthesis. * Haloketones react with phosphites in the Perkow reaction. * The halogroup can be removed in reductive dehalogenation of halo ketones * Historically, treatment of haloketones with zinc dust in the Reformatsky reaction was one of the first reliable methods for generating unstabilized enolates.

In the next two decades she sang for 100 films, till the early 1950s, when Lata Mangeshkar changed the playback-singing scene in India. =Career= She was just 10 years old when she recorded her first song for HMV in 1934 and she started her career as a stage artiste. Vijay Bhatt and Shankar Bhatt of Prakash Pictures spotted her during one of her shows. They liked her voice and persuaded her to discontinue acting on stage as it would spoil her voice (In those days, there were no microphones and you had to shout to be heard). So she quit theatre, and became an employee of Prakash Pictures as an actress and singer. Rajkumari's first film with them was a Hindi-Gujarati bilingual called Sansar Leela Nayi Duniya. She got important roles in films like Aankh Ka Tara and Turki Sher (1933). She was the heroine in Bhakt Ke Bhagwan and Insaaf Ki Topi (1934). In those days she often acted opposite Zakaria Khan (late actor Amjad Khan's father, whose screen name was Jayant). She also used to sing for popular music director Lallubhai. He gave music to films starring Rajkumari ji like Nai Duniya, alias Sacred Scandal (1934) (Sansaar Leela in Gujarati version), Laal Chitthi, alias Red Letter (1935), Bombay Mail (1935), Bambai Ki Sethaani (1935) and Shamsheer-e-Arab (1935). She began getting fed up with having to watch on her figure and decided to stick to just singing as a career. After she quit Prakash Pictures, she began playback singing for actresses like Ratnamala, Shobhana Samarth, etc. and soon she became the first female playback singer of Indian cinema. She sang many Gujarati and Punjabi songs. Even though she was not formally trained to sing, she was very good at picking up what her composers taught her. They thought she was a trained singer! She was able to also establish herself as a classical singer and excelled in singing and voice production within the framework of classical forms of thumri and dadra. Among her peers were Shamshad Begum, Zohrabai Ambalewali, Juthika Roy, Zeenat Begum, etc. Both Shamshad and Zohrabai had resounding voices with a high range, while Rajkumari had a soft and very sweet voice with a small range. She sang quite a few songs with Mukesh. She did not get much opportunity to sing with Mohammed Rafi – mainly because Lata Mangeshkar was a fast upcoming singer at the time. She sang with Noor Jehan in Naukar (1943). She never sang with K. C. Dey, but she did sing songs composed by him, as well as his nephew, Manna Dey. =Later life= Rajkumari was married very late in life. Her husband was V.K. Dubey who was from Benares, (Uttar Pradesh) where he spent a lot of his time (because he owned a shop there), while she settled in Bombay. He later joined her in Bombay. Rajkumari Dubey died in 2000. During her career, she would go on to sing songs for Neel Kamal, a Raj Kapoor and Madhubala starrer, and Hulchul (1951); but her two most famous films would be Bawre Nain (1950), where she sang for Geeta Bali \\"Sun Bairi Baalam Sach Bol Re\\" and Mahal (1949), where she sang \\"Ghabrekar Ke Jo Hum Sir Ko Takraayan\\" and \\"Chun Chun Gunguruva Baje Jhumba\\", a duet with Zohrabai Ambalawali for the Indian actress Madhubala, Rajkumari actually sang for Vijayalaxmi, Lata sang for Madhubala). By this time, however, Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle had shot to fame, relegating most other female singers in the industry to the sidelines. She sang her only song for O. P. Nayyar in the 1952 movie Aasmaan, which was his debut movie; \\"Jab Se Pee Piya Aan Base\\". The story goes that he was considering Lata Mangeshkar for the song. (Rest of the songs of the movie are sung by Geeta Dutt and C. H. Atma). When somebody told this to Lata, she said something about him which led to a misunderstanding. Angered, O. P. Nayyar made Rajkumari sing this song and never repeated her. He never used Lata to sing for him as well. Rajkumari endured a long dry spell until music director Naushad spotted her singing in the chorus for his background score for Pakeezah (1972). Naushad was much taken aback by this, having greatly respected her in her heyday, and heartbroken to hear that she was reduced to singing in the chorus to make ends meet. As a result, he gave her an entire song to herself in Pakeezah, Najariya ki Mari. Her last film song was recorded for R. D. Burman in the film Kitaab; \\"Har Din Jo Beeta\\". Rajkumari also appeared in a British TV programme called Mahfil on Channel 4, a Samandar Films production, produced by Firdous Ali and Mahmood Jamal. In this programme, she sang a set of her famous film songs and ghazals; the caption on one of the songs, \\"Yeh raat phir na aayge\\", from the film Mahal, cites that the song was pictured on Zohra (and not Madhubala or Vijayalaxmi). The programme was aired on 24 March 1991. Rajkumari died in poverty in early 2000.

A bolt action weapon with an integral 5-round magazine, it was principally contract manufactured by companies in the United States. It served as a sniper rifle and as second line and reserve issue until being declared obsolete in 1947. The Pattern 1914 Enfield was the successor to the Pattern 1913 Enfield experimental rifle and the predecessor of the U.S. Rifle M1917 Enfield. History rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge for which the action was originally designed rimmed cartridge for which the P14 action was adapted During the Boer War the British were faced with accurate long-range fire from Mauser rifles, model 1893 and 1895, in 7×57mm caliber. This smaller, high-velocity round prompted the War Department to develop their own \\"magnum\\" round, the .276 Enfield, in 1910. An advanced new rifle using a modified Mauser M98-pattern action was built to fire it, the Pattern 1913 Enfield (P13); effective mass production was still some way off when World War I started, to say nothing of the logistical nightmare of introducing a new rifle cartridge in wartime, so nothing came of it. Conscripts of the Estonian Sakala Partisan Battalion with P14 rifles in 1939 or 1940. Production history The primary contractor (Vickers) was unable to produce more than a handful of rifles, so the P14 became a de facto afterthought. The Short Magazine Lee–Enfield therefore remained the standard British rifle during World War I and beyond. The need for additional small arms combined with a shortage of spare industrial capacity led the British government to contract with United States commercial arms manufacturers, Winchester, Remington and Eddystone (a subsidiary of Remington set up principally to manufacture the P14) to produce the P14 for the British before the US entered the war in 1917. However, each factory produced slightly differing parts, leading to interchangeability issues. Therefore, the official designation of the rifle was dependent upon its manufacturer: e.g., the Pattern 1914 Mk I W is a Mk I of Winchester manufacture, R would be Remington, or E for Eddystone. Problems were encountered with specifications, quality and shortage of machine tools and skilled workers, with the result that the first rifles were not accepted by British inspectors until February 1916. In December 1916, a modification was made to enlarge the bolt lugs and the rifle became the Mark I*. They were still designed by the letter of their manufacturer (W, R or E), even if the production had become more standardized. The Mk I were soon confined to training usage and marked DP, meaning Drill Purpose. The P14's principal combat use during World War I was as a sniper rifle, since it was found to be more accurate than the Short Magazine Lee–Enfield, either in standard issue form or with modified \\"fine-adjustment\\" aperture rearsights designated Pattern 1914 Mk I W (F) and Pattern 1914 Mk I* W (F) or, from April 1918,John Walter, Rifles of the World, p110 3rd edition Aldis Pattern 1918 telescopic sights designated Pattern 1914 Mk I* W (T) (modified and telescopic sights were mainly used on Winchester-manufactured rifles, the Winchesters being thought to be of superior quality). Eventually Winchester manufactured 235,293 rifles, Remington manufactured 400,000 and Eddystone manufactured 600,000, totaling 1,235,293 rifles. When the U.S. entered World War I, the P14 was modified and standardized by the U.S. Ordnance Department and went into production at the same factories as had produced the P14, production of that rifle having ceased, as the Model of 1917. Sometimes called the M1917 Enfield, it was chambered for the standard US .30-06 Springfield cartridge and enjoyed some success as a complement for the Springfield M1903 rifles which were America's official standard issue, soon far surpassing the Springfield in total production and breadth of issue. In 1926 the Pattern 1914 Enfield was re- designated by the British military as the No3Mk1. Prior to and during World War II, the Pattern 1914 Enfield was used, after undergoing modification (\\"Weedon Repair Standard\\", formally the Mk2 standard) in Britain mainly as a rearguard rifle. The modification consisted of armourers at the Weedon Royal Ordnance Depot or various other commercial companies inspecting the rifles, removing the volley sights and performing any necessary repair prior to issue. Post Dunkirk and with the great loss of arms that the British forces endured in 1940 the No3Mk1 stock suddenly became a valued resource. The rifle was also used again as a sniper rifle, the configuration being different from the World War I incarnation. Additionally, the US also sent some M1917 Enfield rifles to the UK under Lend-Lease, though the different .30-06 Springfield chambering limited use and necessitated clearly marking the rifles with a 2 inch wide red band around the stock. The Australian Army also used some quantities of the sniper variant of the P14 during World War II. Once sufficient numbers were built up of the Short Magazine Lee–Enfields and No4's the No3Mk1 were either relegated primarily to equip the World War II British Home Guard or used as sniper rifles. Some sniper rifles were used during the Korean War. The P14/No3Mk1 was declared obsolete in British service in 1947. Surplus P14s were sold throughout the Commonwealth, especially Canada, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, where they proved popular for full-bore target shooting, and being sporterised for game shooting. Design details British sniper training in France 1944 Home Guard volunteers are instructed on the working of a P14 rifle during World War 2. Adapting the design to fire the standard .303 British round led to the Rifle, .303 Pattern 1914 (P14), a design fed from a five-round internal box magazine. With its prominent sight protection ears on the receiver, \\"dog-leg\\" bolt handle and \\"pot-belly\\" magazine, it was distinctive in appearance. The action was essentially a Mauser design with some Lee–Enfield features and optimised for rapid fire, with the action cocking on closing, a feature highly valued by the British Army with its emphasis on riflemen highly trained for rapid fire, but less valued in other armies, such as the US or Germany, where cock-on-opening designs such as the M1903 Springfield and Gewehr 98 were preferred. Cock-on-opening actions became more difficult to operate when heated by rapid fire as the effort to open the bolt had to overcome the striker spring to cock the action as well as unsticking the fired case from the chamber. The P14 was an advanced design for the time, and was said to be the most advanced service rifle of World War I.p.14 Julian S. Hatcher \\"Hatcher's Notebook\\" Stackpole Books Harrisburg PA, 1962 The Pattern 1914 Enfield had a large, strong bolt action made from nickel-steel, and the bolt travel is long, as it was designed for the dimensionally large and powerful .276 Enfield cartridge. The bolt action had a Model 98 Mauser type claw extractor and two forward lugs; there was also a rear safety lug formed by the base of the bolt handle sitting in a recess in the receiver. Much faster and smoother to operate than a Model 98 Mauser, the bolt was well-supported throughout its travel and the camming action on opening and closing the bolt facilitated ease and speed of operation. The unusual 'dog-leg' shaped bolt handle is low profile and places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger close to the firer's hand, again facilitating rapid cycling and fire. Like the Lee–Enfield, the safety falls under the firer's thumb and can be operated silently. Due to the original Pattern 1913 Enfield action being designed around the high-powered .276 Enfield experimental cartridge with a larger diameter case than the .303 British, the internal box magazine capacity for the smaller diameter .303 British was six rounds, although the employed stripper clips held only five cartridges. The Pattern 1914 Enfield like the Mauser Gewehr 98 had no magazine cut-off mechanism, which when engaged permits the feeding and extraction of single cartridges only while keeping the cartridges in the magazine in reserve. The rifle was designed with an iron sight line consisting of rear receiver aperture battle sight calibrated for .303 British Mk VII ball ammunition at with an additional ladder aperture sight that could be flipped up and was calibrated for in increments and in increments. The ladder aperture sight moves vertically on a slide, and hence was not able to correct for wind drift. The rear sight element was protected by sturdy \\"ears\\" and proved to be faster and more accurate than the typical mid-barrel sight offered by Mauser, Enfield or the Buffington battle sight of the 1903 Springfield. The front sighting element consisted of a wing guards protected front post, and was adjusted laterally and locked into position during assembly at the arsenal. The Pattern 1914 Enfield rear sight element was situated on an elongated receiver bridge, which added weight to the action, as well as lengthening the bolt. There were also volley-fire sights similar to those on the Short Magazine Lee–Enfield fitted to the left side of the weapon for use up to , though these were of little use and were usually deleted when the weapon was refurbished. The advanced aperture sights with their long sight radius contributed to a well- deserved reputation for accuracy, and WW1 snipers considered it to be more accurate than the standard Short Magazine Lee-Enfield Mk III infantry rifle.Sniping in France by Major H. Hesketh-Prichard (1920) p. 259 \\"It is as well to understand at once that a far higher degree of accuracy can be obtained from the P14 than from the Short Magazine Lee–Enfield, and this is the reason why it has been issued to snipers\\". Compared to the Lee–Enfield the Pattern 1914 Enfield was more accurate, more durable; however, it was heavier – the Lee—Enfield Mk III weighed empty – and had only half the magazine capacity, giving it a significantly lower effective rate of fire. The pre World War professional British Army emphasized besides marksmanship also on rapid-fire training, resulting in the annual Mad minute qualification shoot for their riflemen. In contrast to the Boer War experience which had led to the P13/P14 project, World War I conditions favoured volume of fire, at which the Short Magazine Lee–Enfield excelled.

Like many of Dostoevsky's stories, \\"White Nights\\" is told in the first person by a nameless narrator. The narrator is a young man living in Saint Petersburg who suffers from loneliness. He gets to know and falls in love with a young woman, but the love remains unrequited as the woman misses her lover, with whom she is finally reunited. The Russian writer, Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (1821-1881) Plot summary The short story is divided into six sections: ;First Night: The narrator describes his experience walking in the streets of St. Petersburg. He loves the city at night, and feels comfortable in it. He no longer feels comfortable during the day because all the people he is used to seeing are not there. He drew his emotions from them: if they were happy, he was happy; if they were despondent, he was despondent. New faces made him feel alone. As he walked, the houses would talk to him and tell him how they were being renovated or painted a new color or being torn down. He lives alone in a small apartment in Saint Petersburg with only his old and unsociable maid Matryona to keep him company. He tells the story of his relationship with a young woman called Nastenka (a diminutive of the name Anastasia). He first sees her standing against a railing, crying. He becomes concerned and considers asking her what is wrong, but eventually continues walking. There is something special about her and he is very curious. When he hears her scream, he intervenes, saving her from a man who is harassing her. The young woman holds his arm, and he explains that he is alone, that he has never known a woman, and that he feels timid with her. Nastenka reassures him that ladies like timidity and she likes it, too. He tells her how he spends every minute of every day dreaming about a girl that would just say two words to him, who will not repulse him or ridicule him as he approached. He explains how he thinks of talking to a random girl timidly, respectfully, passionately, telling her that he is dying in solitude and that he has no chance of success with her. He tells her that it is a girl's duty not to rudely reject or mock one as timid and luckless as he is. As they reach Nastenka's door, he asks if he will ever see her again. Before she can answer, he adds that he will be at the spot they met tomorrow anyway just so he can relive this one happy moment in his lonely life. She agrees, stating she can't forbid him not to come and she has to be there anyway. The girl would tell him her story and be with him, provided that it does not lead into romance. She too is as lonely as the narrator. ;Second Night: On their second meeting, Nastenka seeks to find out more about him. He tells her that he has no history because he has spent his life utterly alone. When she presses him to continue, he suggests that he is of the type of the \\"dreamer\\". \\"'The dreamer'\\", he explains, \\"is not a human being, but a creature of an intermediate sort.\\" He gives a long speech (in a style that anticipates that of the Underground Man in Notes from Underground), about his longing for companionship, leading Nastenka to comment \\"...you talk as if you were reading from a book\\". He begins to tell his story in the third person, calling himself \\"the hero\\". This \\"hero\\" is happy at the hour when all work ends and people walk about. He references Vasily Zhukovsky and mentions \\"The Goddess of Fancy\\". He dreams of everything, from befriending poets to having a place in the winter with a girl by his side. He says that the dreariness of everyday life kills people, while in his dreams he can make his life as he wishes it to be. At the end of his moving speech, Nastenka sympathetically assures him that she will be his friend. ;Nastenka's Story: Nastenka tells the narrator her story. She grew up with her strict grandmother who gave her a largely sheltered upbringing. Her grandmother's pension being too small, they rent out their house to gain income. When their first lodger dies, he is replaced by a younger man. The young man begins a silent courtship with Nastenka, often giving her a book so that she may develop a reading habit. She takes a liking to the novels of Sir Walter Scott and Aleksandr Pushkin. On one occasion, the young man invites her and her grandmother to a performance of The Barber of Seville. On the night that the young lodger is about to leave Petersburg for Moscow, Nastenka urges him to marry her. He refuses immediate marriage, saying that he does not have money to support them, but assures her that he will return for her a year later. Nastenka finishes her story at the end of this, noting that a year has gone and he hasn't sent her a single letter. ;Third Night: The narrator gradually realizes that despite his assurance that their friendship would remain platonic, he has inevitably fallen in love with her. He nevertheless helps her by writing and posting a letter to her lover, and conceals his feelings for her. They await his reply to the letter or his appearance, but Nastenka grows restless at his absence and takes comfort in the narrator's friendship. Unaware of the depth of his feelings for her, she tells him that she loves him because he hasn't fallen in love with her. The narrator, despairing due to his unrequited love, notes that he has now begun to feel alienated from her as well. ;Fourth Night: Nastenka despairs because she knows that her lover is in Petersburg but hasn't contacted her. The narrator continues to comfort her, for which she is extremely grateful, leading him to break his resolve and confess his love for her. Nastenka is disoriented at first, and the narrator, realizing that they can no longer continue to be friends in the same manner, insists on never seeing her again. She urges him to stay, and suggests that their relationship might become romantic some day, but that she wants his friendship in her life. The narrator becomes hopeful at this prospect. As they are walking, they pass by a young man who stops and calls after them. He turns out to be Nastenka's lover, and she jumps into his arms. She returns briefly to kiss the narrator but journeys into the night, leaving him alone and broken-hearted. ;Morning: The final section is a brief afterword about a letter he receives from Nastenka, in which she apologizes for hurting him and insists that she would always be thankful for his companionship. She also mentions that she will be married within a week and hopes that he will come. The narrator breaks into tears upon reading the letter. Matryona, his maid, interrupts his thoughts by telling him she has finished cleaning the cobwebs. The narrator notes that though he'd never considered Matryona to be an old woman, she looked far older to him then than she ever did before, and wonders if his own future is to be without companionship and love. He refuses to despair: > \\"But that I should feel any resentment against you, Nastenka! That I should > cast a dark shadow over your bright, serene happiness! ...That I should > crush a single one of those delicate blooms which you will wear in your dark > hair when you walk up the aisle to the altar with him! Oh no -- never, > never! May your sky be always clear, may your dear smile be always bright > and happy, and may you be for ever blessed for that moment of bliss and > happiness which you gave to another lonely and grateful heart ... Good Lord, > only a moment of bliss? Isn't such a moment sufficient for the whole of a > man's life?\\" Film adaptations * Le notti bianche, a 1957 Italian film by Luchino Visconti * White Nights, a 1959 Russian film by Ivan Pyryev * Four Nights of a Dreamer, a 1971 French film by Robert Bresson * White Nights, a 2003 Iranian film, Directed by Farzad Motamen * Iyarkai, a 2003 Indian film by S.

Janet January Elliott was reared in an affluent family in Boston and New York, the daughter of railroad executive, Howard Elliott. Anxious to explore, Janet was tired of the \\"superficial social life of her world in New York,\\" and, in 1918, at age 24, she joined the Red Cross as a nurse in France to help out the war effort and to be near her fiancé, Frederick Roelker Wulsin, whom she married in 1919. Life and work She was born Janet January Elliott to a wealthy New York family. Her father was a railroad executive. Janet served as a Red Cross nurse in the French Third Republic during World War I. In 1919, she left New York for Paris, where she married Frederick Wulsin, a Harvard University graduate from a self-proclaimed prominent Ohio family. Inspired by the travels of Roy Chapman Andrews, the Wulsins resolved to dedicate themselves to a life of folly and travel the world. From 1921 to 1925, the couple mounted expeditions to the far reaches of China, Tibet, and Outer Mongolia to study the people, flora, and fauna of the region. With a grant from the National Geographic Society, they took 28 camels, six horses, four Mongolian camel drivers and 10 Chinese \\"specimen collectors.\\" Together, the Wulsins collected 1,400 botanical and zoological specimens and documented Buddhist rituals. They also took hundreds of photographs, documented tribespeople and desert landscapes, and were even allowed to photograph the interior of several of the great Tibetan Buddhist lamaseries, one of few early Westerners allowed to do so. In 1926, National Geographic published one account of their expeditions, but Janet's contributions went uncredited. Stray newspaper articles in the United States were often misleading or inaccurate. The Wulsins returned to the United States in 1925, and divorced in 1929. Elliott remarried Richard Hobart, a banker and collector of Chinese art. Janet's role in her first husband's expeditions went largely uncredited until after her death in 1963, when her daughter, Mabel Cabot, mother of Ali Wentworth, found her mother's private letters and diaries and published Vanished Kingdoms (), a biographical account of Janet's explorations.

It connects the small community of Creston with the rural state routes. Also, in conjunction with SR 58 and SR 41, it provides a slower, more scenic route between the Central Coast and the San Joaquin Valley. Route description SR 229 starts at SR 58 east of Santa Margarita. It travels north on Webster Road as a one-lane, windy mountain road, after which the road widens to two lanes as it approaches Rocky Canyon Road. In this segment, it is a county road much like a standard rural state route. It continues north through relatively flat, rural farmland and then passes through the small town of Creston, continuing north and terminating at SR 41. SR 229 is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. History SR 229 was adopted as a state route in 1933 as Legislative Route 137.

Its original purpose was to provide an alternate route between US 101 (the major north-south route on the Central Coast) to US 466 (a major route connecting the Central Coast to the San Joaquin Valley). In the 1950s, US 466 was moved to LRN 33 (currently SR 46). The original alignment became unsigned. In 1957, LRN 137 was changed to start at LRN 58 (currently SR 58) instead of LRN 2. This isolated the route between two rural routes. In 1964, with the renumbering of California state routes, LRN 137 became SR 229 and became a signed route.Route 225-232. CAHighways.org.

In digital devices, changes to the analog video signal are created by a chip that converts the digital video to analog within the device. In DVD players, trigger bits are created during DVD authoring to inform the APS that it should be applied to DVD players analog outputs or analog video outputs on a PC while playing back a protected DVD-Video disc. In set top boxes trigger bits are incorporated into Conditional Access Entitlement Control Messages (ECM) in the stream delivered to the STB.

The U.S. Post Office at Eads (ZIP Code 81036) now serves Chivington postal addresses. Chivington was named for the Reverend John Chivington, a colonel in the Union Army during the American Civil War, who was celebrated as the hero of the 1862 Battle of Glorieta Pass and commanded the 700 Union soldiers who perpetrated the Sand Creek massacre, a slaughter of Native Americans in a nearby gulch. The massacre was condemned by the United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War and Territorial Governor John Evans lost his job for encouraging Chivington.  History  Chivington (est. 1887) was one of several railroad towns in Kiowa County on eastern Colorado's plains along the Missouri Pacific Railroad line, and in the late 19th century, eastern Colorado had a lot of agriculture and related commerce. Railroad workers also briefly contributed to the local economy as the Missouri Pacific extended into Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Palmer Lake, and eventually brought service into Denver. As new towns along this railroad line formed, they were named alphabetically, which might explain why \\"Chivington\\" was chosen—with the massacre site only about 9 miles away, \\"C\\" brought the name \\"Chivington\\" to mind. And in Colorado, the massacre was not as infamous as in the rest of the nation. During Chivington's early days, it supported a number of local businesses, the crown jewel being the $10,000, 60-room, 3-story Queen Anne styled Kingdon Hotel—but when the railroad realized that Chivington's water had too high an alkali content to use in the locomotive boilers, a nearby town in Kansas (Horace) instead became an important watering stop for the railroad. The Kingdon Hotel was disassembled (its intended purpose was to house railroad workers), and its materials shipped to two other Colorado communities for constructing buildings there—a common fate in Colorado, in the era. The dust bowl and Depression days of the 1920s and 1930s proved sustained agriculture on Colorado's eastern plains unsupportable, and Chivington (like many other nearby towns) mostly died somewhere in those decades. Today's Chivington A few newer homes are still occupied in Chivington, but the town consists mostly of a few abandoned but still-standing ruins, more partially collapsed buildings (the former school house degrades, year-by-year), and many piles of bricks mark where the town once stood. Standard green highway markers (\\"Chivington\\") identify what these ruins once were. The post office existed into the 1980s but nearby Eads today offers the nearest postal service and amenities like stores and gas stations. Lamar is the closest remaining \\"significant\\" town on Colorado's eastern plains. Chivington appears to be returning, like much of eastern Colorado, to its sparse grassland and prairieland origins. One of the former town's buildings contains a ghost sign asking for Chivington citizens to vote for a man named Jan King, who ran for the office of Kiowa County clerk. The famous TransAmerica Cycling Trail passes through Chivington and is frequented by hundreds of cyclists annually. Geography Chivington is located at (38.436649,-102.542095).

The film is the sequel and spin-off to the 2000 animated film The Emperor's New Groove, and features reprises of the roles of David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt, Patrick Warburton and Wendie Malick from the first film, with new voices by John Mahoney and Tracey Ullman. It was also the last film to feature the voice of John Fiedler, who died six months before it was released. Plot Emperor Kuzco (David Spade) narrates the story about Kronk Pepikrankenitz (Patrick Warburton), now chef and Head Delivery Boy of Mudka's Meat Hut, who is fretting over the upcoming visit of his father. Kronk's father always disapproved of young Kronk's culinary interests and wished that Kronk instead would settle down with a wife and a large house on a hill. In a flashback, Kronk tells the story of how he almost had both of these. As unwitting accomplice to Yzma (Eartha Kitt) – the villainess of the first film who turned into a cat at the end of the original, but is now human again despite still having a tail – he goes along with her plan to sell sewer slime as a youth potion. He makes enough money to buy the old folks' home from the old folks and put his large new home there. Eventually Yzma is revealed as a fake and the old folks chase her down and corner her at a bridge over a river full of crocodiles. To prevent them from attacking her, she transforms herself into a rabbit, but is then caught and taken away by a condor. When Kronk realizes the old folks have sold everything they own in return for something which doesn't work, he gives his home back to them. Kronk, as camp counselor of the Junior Chipmunks at Camp Chippamunka, falls in love with fellow counselor Miss Birdwell (Tracey Ullman); but when one of his Chipmunks, Tipo, pulls a prank to win the camp championships and is caught, Kronk protects the boy at the cost of alienating his love. Kronk's father (John Mahoney) arrives and confusion ensues as several supportive friends try to pass themselves off to him as Kronk's wife and kids. But in the end Kronk realizes that his wealth is in his friendships, and this finally wins his father's thumbs up and Miss Birdwell's love. Meanwhile, just outside the house, Yzma is in the condor's nest with two eggs, which hatch and presumably attack her before the credits roll.

The degree can be considered akin to a degree in general studies and is becoming increasingly popular in the United States. The Bachelor of Independent Studies targets adult learners previously unable to complete their educational pursuits, through transfer credit options and interdisciplinary concentrations tailored to each student. While it is an undergraduate degree, it is far more akin in structure to a graduate degree.

It was one of several textile companies that helped create what became the city of Nashua, creating roads, churches and its own bank as part of the process. Like most New England textile mills it struggled during the Depression.

The Nashua Manufacturing Company was incorporated in 1823 on the initiative of Daniel Abbot (today considered the \\"father of Nashua\\", he renamed the town from Dunstable, New Hampshire to Nashua in 1803). He and several other local tradesmen began the company after quietly buying up land from the banks of the Merrimack along the Nashua River up to Mine Falls, as they planned to use the falls to power their mills, rather than the Merrimack.History of Nashua website They hired Asher Benjamin to design the mills, including churches and a grid of streets. They modelled their plans on the experiment at Lowell with the Lowell Mill Girls. They were highly successful, and after digging the Nashua power canal were able to build more mill buildings and hire more labor, resulting in the town's population rising from 100 to 1200 in the years 1824-1828. The company started its own bank in 1835 to pay its workers in its own currency, the Nashua Bank (later the Indian Head Bank). Though others began mills in the same period, the Nashua Manufacturing Company was always the largest and during the 19th and early 20th centuries, it bought several other textile manufacturers, including Jackson Company, Indian Head Mills, and Tremont and Suffolk Mills.Austin J. Coolidge & John B. Mansfield, A History and Description of New England, Boston, Massachusetts 1859 The company owned a major part of the land along the Nashua River, that it used for powering its machines, and the largest contiguous portion of these properties encompassing 400 acres is now protected as Mine Falls Park and the Nashua Manufacturing Company Historic District. It was acquired by Textron Inc. in 1945. The company shut the Nashua Mills in 1947.History of Nashua, NH -- City of Nashua, New Hampshire Six of the mill buildings along the Nashua River were converted into luxury apartments in the mid- to late-1990s and are now known as Clocktower Place Apartments.

Mechanism of action Sorafenib is a protein kinase inhibitor with activity against many protein kinases, including VEGFR, PDGFR and RAF kinases. Of the RAF kinases, Sorafenib is more selective for c-Raf than B-RAF. (See BRAF (gene)#Sorafenib for details the drug's interaction with B-Raf.) Sorafenib treatment induces autophagy, which may suppress tumor growth. Based on its 1,3-disubstituted urea structure, Sorafenib is also a potent soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor and this activity likely reduces the severity of its adverse effects. Medical uses Sorafenib is indicated as a treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and thyroid cancer. =Kidney cancer= Clinical trial results, published January 2007, showed that, compared with placebo, treatment with sorafenib prolongs progression-free survival in patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma in whom previous therapy has failed. The median progression-free survival was 5.5 months in the sorafenib group and 2.8 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for disease progression in the sorafenib group, 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.55; P<0.01). In Australia this is one of two TGA- labelled indications for sorafenib, although it is not listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for this indication. =Liver cancer= At ASCO 2007, results from the SHARP trial were presented, which showed efficacy of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary endpoint was median overall survival, which showed a 44% improvement in patients who received sorafenib compared to placebo (hazard ratio 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.87; p=0.0001). Both median survival and time to progression showed 3-month improvements; however, there was no significant difference in median time to symptomatic progression (p=0.77). There was no difference in quality of life measures, possibly attributable to toxicity of sorafenib or symptoms related to underlying progression of liver disease. Of note, this trial only included patients with Child-Pugh Class A (i.e. mildest) cirrhosis. Because of this trial Sorafenib obtained FDA approval for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in November 2007. In a randomized, double-blind, phase II trial combining sorafenib with doxorubicin, the median time to progression was not significantly delayed compared with doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Median durations of overall survival and progression-free survival were significantly longer in patients receiving sorafenib plus doxorubicin than in those receiving doxorubicin alone. A prospective single-centre phase II study which included the patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)concluding that the combination of sorafenib and DEB-TACE in patients with unresectable HCC is well tolerated and safe, with most toxicities related to sorafenib. In Australia this is the only indication for which sorafenib is listed on the PBS and hence the only Government-subsidised indication for sorafenib. Along with renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the TGA-labelled indications for sorafenib. =Thyroid cancer= On November 22, 2013, sorafenib was approved by the FDA for the treatment of locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) refractory to radioactive iodine treatment. The Phase 3 DECISION trial showed significant improvement in progression-free survival but not in overall survival. However, as is known, the side effects were very frequent, specially hand and foot skin reaction. =Desmoid tumors= A phase 3 clinical trial is under way testing the effectiveness of Sorafenib to treat desmoid tumors (also known as aggressive fibromatosis), after positive results in the first two trial stages. Dosage is typically half of that applied for malignant cancers (400 mg vs 800 mg). NCI are sponsoring this trial.

In Scotland the drug had already been refused authorization by the Scottish Medicines Consortium for use within NHS Scotland, for the same reason. In March 2012, the Indian Patent Office granted a domestic company, Natco Pharma, a license to manufacture generic Sorafenib, bringing its price down by 97%. Bayer sells a month's supply, 120 tablets, of Nexavar for. Natco Pharma will sell 120 tablets for , while still paying a 6% royalty to Bayer. The royalty was later raised to 7% on appeal by Bayer.http://www.lawyerscollective.org/updates/supreme-court-says-no-to-bayer-upholds-compulsory-license-on-nexavar.html Under the Patents Act, 1970 and the World Trade Organisation TRIPS Agreement, the government can issue a compulsory license when a drug is not available at an affordable price. Research =Lung= In some kinds of lung cancer (with squamous-cell histology) sorafenib administered in addition to paclitaxel and carboplatin may be detrimental to patients. =Ovarian cancer= Sorafenib has been studied as maintenance therapy after ovarian cancer treatment and in combination with chemotherapy for recurrent ovarian cancer but did not show results that led to approval of the drug for these indications. =Brain (recurrent glioblastoma)= There is a phase I/II study at the Mayo Clinic of sorafenib and CCI-779 (temsirolimus) for recurrent glioblastoma. =Desmoid tumor (aggressive fibromatosis)= A study performed in 2011 showed that Sorafenib is active against aggressive fibromatosis. This study is being used as justification for using Sorafenib as an initial course of treatment in some patients with aggressive fibromatosis. Nexavar controversy In January 2014, Bayer's CEO Marijn Dekkers allegedly stated that Nexavar was developed for \\"Western Patients Who Can Afford it, not for Indians\\". However, Dekkers actually never said this. In fact, his words were misquoted and the context was omitted. A kidney cancer patient would pay $96,000 (£58,000) for a year's course of the Bayer-made drug, whereas the cost of the Indian version of the generic drug would be around $2,800 (£1,700).> Notes References External links  Bayer brands Orphan drugs Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors Chloroarenes Trifluoromethyl compounds Anilines Ureas Phenol ethers Pyridines Carboxamides ","title":"Sorafenib"},{"id":"3492955","text":"A schematic illustrating how FTTX (Node, Curb, Building, Home) architectures vary with regard to the distance between the optical fiber and the end user. The building on the left is the central office; the building on the right is one of the buildings served by the central office. Dotted rectangles represent separate living or office spaces within the same building. Fiber to the x (FTTX; also spelled \\"Fibre\\") or fiber in the loop is a generic term for any broadband network architecture using optical fiber to provide all or part of the local loop used for last mile telecommunications. As fiber optic cables are able to carry much more data than copper cables, especially over long distances, copper telephone networks built in the 20th century are being replaced by fiber.“How Fiber Optics Work”. https://computer.howstuffworks.com/fiber-optic4.htm. How Stuff Works. Retrieved 2 June 2020. FTTX is a generalization for several configurations of fiber deployment, arranged into two groups: FTTP/FTTH/FTTB (Fiber laid all the way to the premises/home/building) and FTTC/N (fiber laid to the cabinet/node, with copper wires completing the connection). Residential areas already served by balanced pair distribution plant call for a trade-off between cost and capacity. The closer the fiber head, the higher the cost of construction and the higher the channel capacity. In places not served by metallic facilities, little cost is saved by not running fiber to the home. Fiber to the x is the key method used to drive next-generation access (NGA), which describes a significant upgrade to the Broadband available by making a step change in speed and quality of the service. This is typically thought of as asymmetrical with a download speed of 24 Mbit/s plus and a fast upload speed. The Definition of UK Superfast Next Generation Broadband OFCOM have defined NGA as in \\"Ofcom's March 2010 'Review of the wholesale local access market\\" \\"Super- fast broadband is generally taken to mean broadband products that provide a maximum download speed that is greater than 24 Mbit/s. This threshold is commonly considered to be the maximum speed that can be supported on current generation (copper-based) networks.\\" A similar network called a hybrid fiber- coaxial (HFC) network is used by cable television operators but is usually not synonymous with \\"fiber In the loop\\", although similar advanced services are provided by the HFC networks. Fixed wireless and mobile wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX and 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) are an alternative for providing Internet access. Definitions The telecommunications industry differentiates between several distinct FTTX configurations. The terms in most widespread use today are: *FTTP (fiber-to-the-premises): This term is used either as a blanket term for both FTTH and FTTB, or where the fiber network includes both homes and small businesses **FTTH (fiber-to-the-home): Fiber reaches the boundary of the living space, such as a box on the outside wall of a home. Passive optical networks and point-to-point Ethernet are architectures that are capable of delivering triple-play services over FTTH networks directly from an operator's central office.Tim Poulus, \\"FTTH networking: Active Ethernet versus Passive Optical Networking and point-to-point vs. point-to-multipoint\\", Telecompaper, 17 November 2010.

This mini-switch provides Ethernet services to end user devices via standard twisted pair patch cords. The switches are located decentrally all over the building, but managed from one central point **FTTF can mean five different things: ***(fiber-to-the- factory): fiber runs to factory buildings ***(fiber-to-the-farm): fiber runs to agricultural farms ***(fiber-to-the-feeder): a synonym of FTTN ***(fiber- to-the-floor): fiber reaches a junction box at a floor of a building ***(fiber-to-the-frontage): This is very similar to FTTB. In a fiber to the front yard scenario, each fiber node serves a single subscriber. This allows for multi-gigabit speeds using XG-fast technology.

FTTE and FTTZ are not considered part of the FTTX group of technologies, despite the similarity in name.Robert Reid, \\"All multimode fiber is not created equal\\", Cabling Installation & Maintenance, PennWell Corporation, February 2007, retrieved 12 July 2013 *FTTdp (Fiber To The Distribution Point): This is very similar to FTTC / FTTN but is one-step closer again moving the end of the fiber to within meters of the boundary of the customers premises in last junction possible junction box known as the \\"distribution point\\" this allows for near-gigabit speeds *FTTL (fiber-to-the- loop): general term *FTTN / FTTLA (fiber-to-the-node, -neighborhood, or -last- amplifier): Fiber is terminated in a street cabinet, possibly miles away from the customer premises, with the final connections being copper. FTTN is often an interim step toward full FTTH (fiber-to-the-home) and is typically used to deliver 'advanced' triple-play telecommunications services *FTTC / FTTK (fiber-to-the-curb/kerb, -closet, or -cabinet): This is very similar to FTTN, but the street cabinet or pole is closer to the user's premises, typically within , within range for high-bandwidth copper technologies such as wired ethernet or IEEE 1901 power line networking and wireless Wi-Fi technology. FTTC is occasionally ambiguously called FTTP (fiber-to-the-pole), leading to confusion with the distinct fiber-to-the-premises system. Typically providing up to 100 Mbit/s *FTTS can mean three different things: ** (fiber-to-the- screen or -seat): On an airplane, fiber reaches the IFE screens ** (fiber-to- the-street): The customer is connected using copper to the fiber passing near the building, up to away. This is a compromise between FTTB and FTTC. Typically providing up to 500 Mbit/s ** (fiber-to-the-subscriber): This is a synonym for FTTP To promote consistency, especially when comparing FTTH penetration rates between countries, the three FTTH Councils of Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific agreed upon definitions for FTTH and FTTB in 2006, with an update in 2009, 2011 and another in 2015. The FTTH Councils do not have formal definitions for FTTC and FTTN. Benefits While fiber optic cables can carry data at high speeds over long distances, copper cables used in traditional telephone lines and ADSL cannot. For example, the common form of Gigabit Ethernet (1Gbit/s) runs over relatively economical category 5e, category 6 or augmented category 6 unshielded twisted-pair copper cabling but only to . However, 1 Gbit/s Ethernet over fiber can easily reach tens of kilometers. Therefore, FTTP has been selected by every major communications provider in the world to carry data over long 1 Gbit/s symmetrical connections directly to consumer homes. FTTP configurations that bring fiber directly into the building can offer the highest speeds since the remaining segments can use standard Ethernet or coaxial cable. Fiber is often said to be \\"future-proof\\" because the data rate of the connection is usually limited by the terminal equipment rather than the fiber, permitting substantial speed improvements by equipment upgrades before the fiber itself must be upgraded.Fiber To The Home: The Ultimate Guide. OSPInsight. https://get.ospinsight.com/fiber-to-the-home- the-ultimate-guide Retrieved 2 June 2020. Still, the type and length of employed fibers chosen, e.g. multimode vs. single-mode, are critical for applicability for future connections of over 1 Gbit/s. With the rising popularity of high-definition, on-demand video streaming applications and devices such as YouTube, Netflix, Roku, and Facebook LIVE, the demand for reliable bandwidth is crucial as more and more people begin to utilize these services. FTTC (where fiber transitions to copper in a street cabinet) is generally too far from the users for standard ethernet configurations over existing copper cabling. They generally use very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL) at downstream rates of 80 Mbit/s, but this falls extremely quickly over a distance of 100 meters. Fiber to the premises Fiber to the premises (FTTP) is a form of fiber-optic communication delivery, in which an optical fiber is run in an optical distribution network from the central office all the way to the premises occupied by the subscriber. The term \\"FTTP\\" has become ambiguous and may also refer to FTTC where the fiber terminates at a utility pole without reaching the premises. Fiber-optic cable being pulled underneath NYC's streets Fiber to the premises can be categorized according to where the optical fiber ends: *FTTH (fiber-to-the-home) is a form of fiber-optic communication delivery that reaches one living or working space. The fiber extends from the central office to the subscriber's living or working space. Once at the subscriber's living or working space, the signal may be conveyed throughout the space using any means, including twisted pair, coaxial cable, wireless, power line communication, or optical fiber. *FTTB (fiber-to-the-building or -basement) is a form of fiber-optic communication delivery that necessarily applies only to those properties that contain multiple living or working spaces. The optical fiber terminates before actually reaching the subscribers living or working space itself, but does extend to the property containing that living or working space. The signal is conveyed the final distance using any non-optical means, including twisted pair, coaxial cable, wireless, or power line communication. An apartment building may provide an example of the distinction between FTTH and FTTB. If a fiber is run to a panel inside each subscriber's apartment unit, it is FTTH. If instead, the fiber goes only as far as the apartment building's shared electrical room (either only to the ground floor or to each floor), it is FTTB. Fiber to the curb/cabinet/node The inside of a fiber cabinet. The left side contains the fiber, and the right side contains the copper. Fiber to the curb/cabinet (FTTC) is a telecommunications system based on fiber-optic cables run to a platform that serves several customers. Each of these customers has a connection to this platform via coaxial cable or twisted pair. The \\"curb\\" is an abstraction and can just as easily mean a pole-mounted device or communications closet or shed. Typically any system terminating fiber within of the customer premises equipment would be described as FTTC. Fiber to the node or neighborhood (FTTN), sometimes identified with and sometimes distinguished from fiber to the cabinet (FTTC),da Silva, Henrique (March 2005), \\"Optical Access Networks\\", Instituto de Telecomunicações, 9 March 2005, slide 10. Retrieved on 2007-03-25. is a telecommunication architecture based on fiber-optic cables run to a cabinet serving a neighborhood. Customers typically connect to this cabinet using traditional coaxial cable or twisted pair wiring. The area served by the cabinet is usually less than one mile in radius and can contain several hundred customers. (If the cabinet serves an area of less than in radius, the architecture is typically called FTTC/FTTK.)McCullough, Don (August 2005), \\"Flexibility is key to successful fiber to the premises deployments\\" , Lightwave 22 (8). Retrieved on 2010-01-27. FTTN allows delivery of broadband services such as high-speed internet. High-speed communications protocols such as broadband cable access (typically DOCSIS) or some form of digital subscriber line (DSL) are used between the cabinet and the customers. Data rates vary according to the exact protocol used and according to how close the customer is to the cabinet. Unlike FTTP, FTTN often uses existing coaxial or twisted-pair infrastructure to provide last mile service and is thus less costly to deploy. In the long term, however, its bandwidth potential is limited relative to implementations that bring the fiber still closer to the subscriber. A variant of this technique for cable television providers is used in a hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) system. It is sometimes given the acronym FTTLA (fiber-to-the-last- amplifier) when it replaces analog amplifiers up to the last one before the customer (or neighborhood of customers). FTTC allows delivery of broadband services such as high-speed internet. Usually, existing wire is used with communications protocols such as broadband cable access (typically DOCSIS) or some form of DSL connecting the curb/cabinet and the customers. In these protocols, the data rates vary according to the exact protocol used and according to how close the customer is to the cabinet. Where it is feasible to run new cable, both fiber and copper ethernet are capable of connecting the \\"curb\\" with a full 100Mbit/s or 1Gbit/s connection. Even using relatively cheap outdoor category 5 copper over thousands of feet, all ethernet protocols including power over Ethernet (PoE) are supported. Most fixed wireless technologies rely on PoE, including Motorola Canopy, which has low-power radios capable of running on a 12VDC power supply fed over several hundred feet of cable. Power line networking deployments also rely on FTTC. Using the IEEE P1901 protocol (or its predecessor HomePlug AV) existing electric service cables move up to 1Gbit/s from the curb/pole/cabinet into every AC electrical outlet in the home—coverage equivalent to a robust Wi-Fi implementation, with the added advantage of a single cable for power and data. By avoiding new cable and its cost and liabilities, FTTC costs less to deploy. However, it also has historically had lower bandwidth potential than FTTP. In practice, the relative advantage of fiber depends on the bandwidth available for backhaul, usage-based billing restrictions that prevent full use of last-mile capabilities, and customer premises equipment and maintenance restrictions, and the cost of running fiber that can vary widely with geography and building type. In the United States and Canada, the largest deployment of FTTC was carried out by BellSouth Telecommunications. With the acquisition of BellSouth by AT&T;, deployment of FTTC will end. Future deployments will be based on either FTTN or FTTP. Existing FTTC plant may be removed and replaced with FTTP.Ed Gubbins, \\"Analyst: AT&T; may replace some FTTC with FTTP\\", Connected Planet, Penton Media, Inc., 21 December 2007 Verizon, meanwhile, announced in March 2010 they were winding down Verizon FiOS expansion, concentrating on completing their network in areas that already had FiOS franchises but were not deploying to new areas, suggesting that FTTH was uneconomic beyond these areas. Verizon also announced (at CES 2010) its entry into the smart home and power utility data management arenas, indicating it was considering using P1901-based FTTC or some other existing-wire approach to reach into homes, and access additional revenues from the secure AES-128 bandwidth required for advanced metering infrastructure. However, the largest 1Gbit/s deployment in the United States, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, despite being conducted by power utility EPB,EPB, website of a non-profit agency of the City of Chattanooga, established in 1935 to provide electric power to the greater Chattanooga area. Retrieved 12 July 2013. was FTTH rather than FTTC, reaching every subscriber in a 600-square-mile area. Monthly pricing of $350 reflected this generally high cost of deployment. However, Chattanooga EPB has reduced the monthly pricing to $70/month.EPBFI, a website for EPB Fiber Optics. Retrieved 3 June 2014. Historically, both telephone and cable companies avoided hybrid networks using several different modes of transport from their point of presence into customer premises. The increased competitive cost pressure, availability of three different existing wire solutions, smart grid deployment requirements (as in Chattanooga), and better hybrid networking tools (with major vendors like Alcatel-Lucent and Qualcomm Atheros, and Wi-Fi solutions for edge networks, IEEE 1905 and IEEE 802.21 protocol efforts and SNMP improvements) all make FTTC deployments more likely in areas uneconomic to serve with FTTP/FTTH. In effect FTTC serves as a halfway measure between fixed wireless and FTTH, with special advantages for smart appliances and electric vehicles that rely on PLC use already. Deployments Operators around the world have been rolling out high-speed Internet access networks since the mid-2000s. Some used a network topology known as Active Ethernet Point-to-Point to deliver services from its central office directly into subscribers' homes. Fiber termination was handled by a residential gateway provided by Advanced Digital Broadcast inside a subscriber's home to be shared with other consumer electronics (CE) devices. Since 2007, Italian access providers Fastweb, Telecom Italia, Vodafone, and Wind participated in an initiative called Fiber for Italy, with the aim of creating a countrywide fiber-to-the-home network in Italy. The pilot taking place in the Italian capital, Rome, has seen symmetrical bandwidth of 100 Mbit/s. Telecom Italia, which refused to take part in the Fiber for Italy initiative, has an even more ambitious plan to bring fiber-to-the-home and fiber-to-the-business to 138 cities by 2018. By the end of December 2010, the total number of fiber-to-the-home enabled homes had passed 2.5 million, with more than 348,000 subscribers.) In September 2010, the European Commission published a new \\"Recommendation for Regulated Access to NGA Networks\\" along with a list of measures to promote deployment of fast broadband and next generation access networks. Portugal Telecom plans to complete its fiber-to-the-home nationwide roll out by 2020. Currently 200 mbs down, 100mbs up costs 22 euros per month. Between September 2017 and March 2019, the number of European FTTH and FTTB subscribers increased by nearly 16%.

Optical distribution networks =Direct fiber= The simplest optical distribution network architecture is direct fiber: each fiber leaving the central office goes to exactly one customer. Such networks can provide excellent bandwidth but are more costly due to the fiber and central office machinery.Dieter Elixmann, et al., \\"The Economics of Next Generation Access- Final Report: Study for the European Competitive Telecommunication Association (ECTA)\\", WIK-Consult GmbH, 10 September 2008. Retrieved 12 July 2012. South Africa and specifically in the city of Cape Town have one of the largest Direct fiber networks in the world. Cape Town has been on the forefront of telecommunication and connectivity for many years, with a large amount of fiber in the ground and many competitive offerings. Their argument for direct fiber is that multiple operators can patch into the network easily, and troubleshooting made simple.\\"Fibre in Cape Town\\" Direct fiber is generally favored by new entrants and competitive operators. A benefit is that no layer 2 networking technologies are excluded, whether passive optical network (PON), active optical network (AON), or other. Any form of regulatory remedy is possible using this topology.Rudolf van der Berg, \\"Developments in Fiber Technologies and Investment\\", Working Party on Communication Infrastructures and Services Policy (CISP), Committee for Information, Computer and Communication Policy (ICCP), Directorate for Science, Technology and Industry (DSTI), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 3 April 2008. Retrieved 12 July 2013. =Shared fiber= More commonly, each fiber leaving the central office is actually shared by many customers. It is not until such a fiber gets relatively close to the customers that it is split into individual customer-specific fibers. AONs and PONs both achieve this split. =Active optical network= Comparison showing how a typical AON (a star network capable of multicasting) handles downstream traffic differently from a typical PON (a star network having multiple splitters housed in the same cabinet) AONs rely on electrically powered network equipment to distribute the signal, such as a switch or router. Normally, signals need an optical-electrical-optical transformation in the AON. Each signal leaving the central office is directed only to the customer for whom it is intended. Incoming signals from the customers avoid colliding at the intersection because the powered equipment there provides buffering. Active Ethernet (a type of ethernet in the first mile) is a common AON, which uses optical ethernet switches to distribute the signal, incorporating the customers' premises and the central office into a large switched ethernet network. Such networks are identical to ethernet computer networks used in businesses and academic institutions, except that their purpose is to connect homes and buildings to a central office rather than to connect computers and printers within a location. Each switching cabinet can handle up to 1,000 customers, although 400–500 is more typical. This neighborhood equipment performs layer 2 switching or layer 3 switching and routing, offloading full layer 3 routing to the carrier's central office. The IEEE 802.3ah standard enables service providers to deliver up to 1000 Mbit/s, full-duplex, over one single-mode optical fiber FTTP, depending on the provider. =Passive optical network= A passive optical network (PON) is a point-to-multipoint FTTP network architecture in which unpowered optical splitters are used to enable a single optical fiber to serve up to 128 customers. A PON reduces the fiber and central office equipment required compared with point-to-point architecture. The downstream signal coming from the central office is broadcast to each customer premises sharing a fiber. Encryption is used to prevent eavesdropping. Upstream signals are combined using a multiple-access protocol, usually time division multiple access (TDMA). =Ethernet point-to-point= Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) is a common way of delivering triple- and quad-play (voice, video, data, and mobile) services over both fiber and hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) networks. Active PPPoE uses dedicated fiber from an operator's central office all the way to the subscribers' homes, while hybrid networks (often FTTN) use it to transport data via fiber to an intermediate point to ensure sufficiently high throughput speeds over last mile copper connections. This approach has become increasingly popular in recent years with telecoms service providers in both North America (AT&T;, Telus, for example) and Europe's Fastweb, Telecom Italia, Telekom Austria and Deutsche Telekom, for example. Google has also looked into this approach, amongst others, as a way to deliver multiple services over open-access networks in the United States.Stephen Hardy, \\"Is Active Ethernet best FTTH option for Google?\\" , Lightwave, PennWell Corporation, 24 February 2010 =Electrical network= Once on private property, the signal is typically converted into an electrical format. The optical network terminal (ONT, an ITU-T term) or unit (ONU, an identical IEEE term) converts the optical signal into an electrical signal using thin film filter technology. These units require electrical power for their operation, so some providers connect them to backup batteries in case of power outages to ensure emergency access to telecommunications. The optical line terminations \\"range\\" the optical network terminals or units in order to provide TDMA time slot assignments for upstream communication. For FTTH and for some forms of FTTB, it is common for the building's existing ethernet, phone, and cable TV systems to connect directly to the optical network terminal or unit. If all three systems cannot directly reach the unit, it is possible to combine signals and transport them over a common medium such as Ethernet. Once closer to the end user, equipment such as a router or network interface controller can separate the signals and convert them into the appropriate protocol. For FTTC and FTTN, the combined internet, video and telephone signal travels to the building over existing telephone or cable wiring until it reaches the end-user's living space, where a VDSL or DOCSIS modem converts data and video signals into ethernet protocol, which is sent over the end-user's category 5 cable.

Gijsbertus Jacobus (Bert) Sas was born in Leeuwarden. He was named after his father, a soldier who by his pension had reached the rank of lieutenant colonel. His mother Geertrui Huiber was 20 years younger than her husband. Bert was the youngest of 3 children, and attended a secondary school in Leeuwarden. In 1910 he went to the Koninklijke Militaire Academie in Breda. During World War I, in 1917, he was promoted to first lieutenant and married Maria Johanna van der Minne. From 1923 until 1926 he followed the training for staff officier at the Hogere Krijgsschool. After this he obtained another staff function in The Hague. In 1928 he was promoted to the rank of captain and became head of the most important bureau of the 2nd division where all of the important military questions were handled. However, during the period from 1928 until 1936, military expenditure was strictly limited. Between 1936 and 1937 he was the military attaché in Berlin for 10 days per month, spending the remaining 20 days in The Hague. He was then recalled to The Hague, where he functioned as the right-hand man of General Reijnders in the role of head of the operations division. In March 1939, following the German annexation of the Sudetenland, Reijnders sent him back to Berlin. This time he set up residence there with his wife Miep. In Berlin he immediately restored his friendship with the German colonel Hans Oster. Oster had obtained an important position as the right hand of Wilhelm Canaris at the German Abwehr, the espionage and counter- espionage service of the army. They were connected not only through their mutual dislike for the Nazi regime. Their friendship dated from the beginning of the 1930s, when they first met, possibly when Sas was working in The Hague. Oster passed him all important information that he obtained. He did not do this out of sympathy for Sas, but because he considered it his duty to Germany. He did not see himself as a traitor, but someone who did his duty to the decent Germany that he loved. At end of August 1939 he warned The Hague that a war with Poland was about to begin. He gave 25 August 1939 as the invasion date, but this date passed by. At 14:50 on that day Hitler gave the order for the invasion, but revoked it when he heard that England was not going to concede. Sas' credibility suffered. When he reported on 31 August that the war was now close, the head of intelligence, Van der Plassche did not believe him. Sas was the only one who delivered this report: London and Paris gave reassurance. However the Netherlands mobilised at the insistence of Queen Wilhelmina. General Reijnders, still his superior in The Hague, was positive over Sas' information. His relationship with General Reijnders remained good as long as the neutrality of Netherlands was not discussed. During September and October 1939, Sas obtained more signals that the neutrality of the Netherlands would not remain inviolate. Oster, during this time, assured him that only Belgium would be the target. However Sas did not believe this. At his insistence, Oster obtained further information from the German headquarters in Zossen. This showed that the suspicions that Sas now had were correct: the Netherlands would be invaded together with Belgium. The violation of neutrality would not be limited to a passage through southern Limburg into Belgium.

He played the majority of his NFL career with the San Diego Chargers (now the Los Angeles Chargers), and he was inducted into the Chargers Hall of Fame. Johnson played college football for the Grambling State Tigers. He was drafted by San Diego in the 1975 NFL Draft in the first round with the eighth overall pick. Johnson was named to the NFL All-Rookie team in his first season. The Chargers won three consecutive division titles from 1979 through 1981. Their defense led the league in sacks in 1980 behind Johnson's team- record sacks. In 1984, Johnson was traded to the San Francisco 49ers, and he won a Super Bowl with the team that season. Johnson retired after the 49ers season in 1985. He is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame and the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame, and was named to both the Chargers' 40th and 50th anniversary teams. Early life Johnson was born in Shreveport, Louisiana and grew up in Bossier City. When Johnson was in the eighth grade, he wanted to pick up a basketball in his physical education class when his coach said, \\"Get your big hands off my basketball.\\" The nickname \\"Big Hands\\" was born. He played football at Charlotte Mitchell High School, and later played college football at Grambling State University for their Tigers football team. NFL career Johnson was drafted in the 1st round with the 8th overall pick by the Chargers in 1975 and was named to the NFL All-Rookie team. In 1980 Johnson teamed with fellow 1975 Chargers' draftees Fred Dean and Louie Kelcher as the Chargers led the NFL in sacks (60). That year Johnson led the NFL with 17½ sacks, which is still a Chargers' team record. He broke Steve DeLong's mark of 17 in 1969. Johnson and Dean were named 1st-team All-Pro, with Kelcher being named 2nd-team All-Pro. The trio, along with Leroy Jones formed a defensive frontline that was locally nicknamed the Bruise Brothers.

It was intended to be a lower cost implementation while providing compatibility with existing High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) and DVI displays. Unlike HDMI, which is aimed at high-definition multimedia consumer electronics devices such as television monitors and DVD players, UDI was specifically targeted towards computer monitor and video card manufacturers and did not support the transfer of audio data. UDI was primarily backed by Intel with support from Samsung and other partners. In early 2007 Intel started supporting the similar DisplayPort standard, and both Intel and Samsung withdrew from the UDI SIG. There has been no announcements made about UDI since early 2007 and the UDI website is no longer operational.  Overview  UDI provided higher bandwidth than its predecessors (up to 16 Gbit/s in its first version, compared to 4.9 Gbit/s for HDMI 1.0) and incorporated a form of digital rights management known as HDCP. The connector had a single row of 26 contacts pitched 0.6 mm apart from each other, looking very similar to the USB plug which has a single row with only four contacts. Three of the 26 contacts are not wired but were reserved for undetermined future upgrade possibilities. Transmit and receive plugs were slightly different, and a UDI cable would fit only one way. Bidirectional communication worked at a much lower data rate than that available for the single direction video datastream. On December 20, 2005, the UDI Special Interest Group (UDI SIG) was announced. They worked on determining the refined specifications and promoting the interface. Members included Apple Computer, Intel, LG, NVIDIA, Samsung, and Silicon Image Inc. The UDI specification was finalized in July 2006.

Charlie Russell was my favorite because his work was absolutely authentic, because he drew what he lived ...\\" Largely self-taught, Heath began freelancing for comics during summers while he was in high school, and both penciled and inked at least two installments of the naval feature \\"Hammerhead Hawley\\" in Holyoke Publishing's Captain Aero Comics vol. 2, #2 (Sept. 1942) and vol. 3, #12 (April 1944). Heath was in Montclair, New Jersey's Montclair High School class of 1945. It is unclear if Heath, anxious to fight in World War II, graduated; in a 2004 interview, he recalls going \\"into the Air Force in my senior year of high school, in 1945,\\" after having been \\"put in an accelerated class so I could get through with high school. I almost made it, but then the Air Force called me and in I went.\\" He served stateside for nine months, drawing cartoons for his camp newspaper, but due to a clerical error, he said, he was on neither the military payroll nor any official duty roster for a significant portion of his time. A 2011 article in his hometown newspaper said that, \\"After a short stint in the military, Heath came back to Montclair, graduated from high school, got married and started a family.\\" Career While spending several weeks arranging appointments with artists for an assistant's job, Heath was hired as an office \\"gofer\\" for the large Manhattan advertising agency Benton & Bowles, earning $35 weekly. He continued looking for work as an artist on his lunch hour, and in 1947, landed a $75-a-week staff position at Timely Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics. Initially working in the Timely offices, Heath, like some of the other staffers, soon found it more efficient to work at home. He and his new wife had been living at his parents' home and continued to do so for two more years, while saving money for their own house. By the mid-1960s, however, they had children and were divorced.Heath interview, Alter Ego, p. 23 The artist said in 2004 he believed his first work for Timely was a Western story featuring the Two-Gun Kid. Historians have tentatively identified his first work as either a Kid Colt story in the omnibus series Wild Western #4 (Nov. 1948); the second Two-Gun Kid story in Two-Gun Kid #5 (Dec. 1948), \\"Guns Blast in Thunder Pass;\\" and the Two-Gun Kid story in Wild Western #5 (Dec. 1948), while confirming Heath art on the Kid Colt story that same issue. Heath's first superhero story is tentatively identified as the seven-page Witness story, \\"Fate Fixed a Fight,\\" in Captain America Comics #71 (March 1949). =1950s= Heath drew several Western stories for such Timely comics as Wild Western, All Western Winners, Arizona Kid, Black Rider, Western Outlaws, and Reno Browne, Hollywood's Greatest Cowgirl. As Timely evolved into Marvel's 1950s iteration, known as Atlas Comics, Heath expanded into other genres. He drew the December 1950 premiere of the two-issue superhero series Marvel Boy, as well as scattered science fiction anthology stories (in Venus, Journey into Unknown Worlds, and Men's Adventures); crime drama (Justice); horror stories and covers (Adventures into Terror, Marvel Tales, Menace, Mystic, Spellbound, Strange Tales, Uncanny Tales, the cover of Journey into Mystery #1), satiric humor (Wild, Mad), and war stories. Heath produced combat stories both for the wide line of Timely war titles and the first issue (Aug. 1951) of EC Comics' celebrated Frontline Combat. He contributed to Mad #14, illustrating Harvey Kurtzman's parody of Plastic Man. Heath later did the first of many decades' worth of war work for DC Comics, with Our Army at War #23 and Star Spangled War Stories #22, both cover-dated June 1954. Other 1950s work includes an issue of 3-D Comics from St. John Publications and \\"The Return of the Human Torch\\" (minus the opening page, drawn by character-creator Carl Burgos) in Young Men #24 (Dec. 1953), the flagship of Atlas' ill-fated effort to revive superheroes, which had fallen out of fashion in the post-war U.S. =Later career= Heath co-created with writer-editor Robert Kanigher the feature \\"The Haunted Tank\\" in G.I. Combat #87 (May 1961). Heath stated in a 1999 interview that \\"I didn't like \\"The Haunted Tank\\" [in G.I. Combat] as much ... I liked less because there was always the same four characters – J.E.B. Stuart plus his three buddies – virtually the same story every issue: He'd be talking to this ghost, over and over again. I couldn't believe kids kept wanting to look at it.\\" Also with Kanigher, Heath co-created and drew the first issues of DC's Sea Devils, about a team of scuba-diving adventurers.McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 101: \\"Showcase #27 in August [1960] saw Dane Dorrance, Biff Bailey, Judy Walton, and Nicky Walton dive into underwater adventures as the Sea Devils, by writer Robert Kanigher and illustrator Russ Heath.\\" DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz described Heath in 2010 as \\"[A] master of texture and lighting and meticulous levels of detail. Given the chance he'd draw every barnacle on a sunken pirate ship.\\" Several of Kanigher's characters were combined into a single feature titled \\"The Losers\\". Their first appearance as a group was with the Haunted Tank crew in G.I. Combat #138 (Oct.–Nov. 1969) drawn by Heath.McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 135: \\"Scribe Robert Kanigher and artist Russ Heath turned these self-described Losers – including \\"Navajo Ace\\" Johnny Cloud of the U.S. Army Air Force, Marines Gunner Mackey and Sarge Clay, and Captain William Storm, a PT boat commander with a prosthetic leg – into a fighting force that meshed as one.\\" Various Heath drawings of fighter jets in DC Comics' All-American Men of War were the uncredited and uncompensated basis for pop artist Roy Lichtenstein's oil paintings Whaam!, Blam, Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, and Brattata. Additional . Heath became known for the authenticity of his military comics. The artist would buy uniforms, helmets and radios and Army surplus stores to use as reference, which peer Joe Kubert said Sometime in the 1960s, Heath drew two pieces of commercial art that became familiar bits of Americana after gracing the back covers of countless comic books through the early 1970s: advertisements for toy soldier sets, depicting Roman and Revolutionary War battle scenes. As Heath described in a 2000s interview, One version of Heath's \\"Roman Soldiers\\" ad that appeared for years on the backs of 1960s and 1970s comic books Heath was one of the artists who sometimes assisted Kurtzman and Will Elder on their regular Playboy strip \\"Little Annie Fanny\\". Writer Mark Evanier described Heath making the most of one such assignment: Heath recalled in 2001 that as an adult he lived \\"seven years in Manhattan, seven years in Chicago and seven years in Connecticut\\", in the town of Westport, before moving to California in 1978. There he worked as an animator for Saturday-morning TV cartoons and later did commissioned art for comics fans. A rare example of Heath working on super-hero material was his inking Michael Golden's penciled artwork on Mister Miracle #24 and 25. Heath and writer Cary Bates launched The Lone Ranger comic strip on September 13, 1981. His last comic-book story was penciling and inking the four-page flashback sequence of the 22-page story \\"The Mortal Iron Fist, Conclusion\\", in Marvel Comics' The Immortal Iron Fist #20 (Jan. 2009) He went on to provide cover art for publisher Aardvark-Vanaheim's satiric comic book glamourpuss #11–13 (Jan.–May 2010), with his last known published comics work the one-page illustration \\"That Russ Heath Girl #4\\", appearing in issue #19 (May 2011). He lived in Van Nuys, California, where in his 80s he had knee surgery after The Hero Initiative and the Comic Art Professional Society of Los Angeles raised money to help pay for an operation. Awards Heath received an Inkpot Award in 1997 and was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2009. Heath received the Comic Art Professional Society Sergio Award in 2010 and the National Cartoonists Society's Milton Caniff Award in 2014. In 2018, Heath was awarded the Inkwell Awards Stacy Aragon Special Recognition Award for his lifetime achievement as comic book inker.

A signal sent by an ideal transmitter or received by a receiver would have all constellation points precisely at the ideal locations, however various imperfections in the implementation (such as carrier leakage, low image rejection ratio, phase noise etc.) cause the actual constellation points to deviate from the ideal locations. Informally, EVM is a measure of how far the points are from the ideal locations. Noise, distortion, spurious signals, and phase noise all degrade EVM, and therefore EVM provides a comprehensive measure of the quality of the radio receiver or transmitter for use in digital communications. Transmitter EVM can be measured by specialized equipment, which demodulates the received signal in a similar way to how a real radio demodulator does it. One of the stages in a typical phase- shift keying demodulation process produces a stream of I-Q points which can be used as a reasonably reliable estimate for the ideal transmitted signal in EVM calculation. Definition Constellation diagram and EVM An error vector is a vector in the I-Q plane between the ideal constellation point and the point received by the receiver. In other words, it is the difference between actual received symbols and ideal symbols. The root mean square (RMS) average amplitude of the error vector, normalized to ideal signal amplitude reference, is the EVM. EVM is generally expressed in percent by multiplying the ratio by 100%. http://rfmw.em.keysight.com/wireless/helpfiles/89600b/webhelp/subsystems/digdemod/Content/digdemod_symtblerrdata_evm.htm The ideal signal amplitude reference can either be the maximum ideal signal amplitude of the constellation, or it can be the root mean square (RMS) average amplitude of all possible ideal signal amplitude values in the constellation. For many common constellations including BPSK, QPSK, and 8PSK, these two methods for finding the reference give the same result, but for higher-order QAM constellations including 16QAM, Star 32QAM, 32APSK, and 64QAM the RMS average and the maximum produce different reference values. http://rfmw.em.keysight.com/wireless/helpfiles/89600b/webhelp/subsystems/digdemod/Content/dlg_digdemod_comp_evmnormref.htm The error vector magnitude is sometimes expressed in dB. This is related to the value of EVM in percent as follows: :mathrm{EVM (dB)} = 20log_{10} left( {mathrm{EVM (%)} over mathrm{100 (%)}} right). The definition of EVM depends heavily on the standard that is being used, for example in 3GPP LTE the relevant documents will define exactly how EVM is to be measured. There are discussions ongoing by academics as to some of the problems around EVM measurement. Dynamic EVM Battery life and power consumption are important considerations for a system-level RF transmitter design. Because the transmit power amplifier (PA) consumes a significant portion of the total system DC power, a number of techniques are employed to reduce PA power usage. Many PAs offer an adjustable DC supply voltage to optimize the maximum RF output power level versus its DC power consumption. Also, most PAs can be powered-down or disabled when not in use to conserve power, such as while receiving or between packets during transmission. In order to maximize power efficiency, the PA must have fast turn-on and turn-off switching times. The highest DC power efficiency occurs when the time delta between PA Enable and the RF signal is minimized, but a short delay can exacerbate transient effects on the RF signal. Because the power-up/power-down operation of the PA can cause transient and thermal effects that degrade transmitter performance, another metric called Dynamic EVM is often tested. Dynamic EVM is measured with a square wave pulse applied to PA Enable to emulate the actual dynamic operation conditions of the transmitter. The degradation in dynamic EVM is due to the PA transient response affecting the preamble at the start of the packet and causing an imperfect channel estimate. Studies have shown that dynamic EVM with a 50% duty cycle square wave applied to PA Enable to be worse than the static EVM (PA Enable with 100% duty cycle).

History and ownership In the 1930s, Carvins Creek was dammed to create the Carvins Cove Reservoir, which for many decades served as the primary water source for the City of Roanoke. A small rural community (called Carvins Cove) was displaced by the reservoir's creation, and some of its roads and housing foundations still become visible during droughts. A series of droughts in the late 1990s spurred the City of Roanoke and Roanoke County to create the Western Virginia Water Authority, which consolidated their water delivery systems. The reservoir and the land below the contour are owned by the Authority; the land above the contour is owned by the City of Roanoke. In April 2008, Roanoke City Council placed of Carvins Cove under a conservation easement donated to the Western Virginia Land Trust and the Virginia Outdoors Foundation. The easement protects much of the Cove from inappropriate development and is the largest ever recorded in the Commonwealth of Virginia.Easement protects land at Carvins Cove - Roanoke.com Recreation A mountain bike rider in Carvins Cove Recreational activities, such as mountain biking, hiking, and equestrian activities, are allowed around the reservoir.

It secretes rennet, which is used in cheese creation. The word abomasum (ab- \\"away from\\" + omasum \\"intestine of an ox\\") is from New Latin and it was first used in English in 1706. It is possibly from the Gaulish language.  Function  The abomasum's normal anatomical location is along the ventral midline. It is a secretory stomach similar in anatomy and function to the monogastric stomach. It serves primarily in the acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein, preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine. The abomasum is lined with glands to release hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes needed to break down food. It is very similar to the nonruminant stomach.  Pathology  Dairy cattle on high production diets are susceptible to a number of pathologies, most commonly after calving. A gas-filled abomasum can move into an abnormal location and become displaced. If the abomasum displaces to the right, it is at risk of torsion. A displaced abomasum will cause cows to present all or some of the following signs: loss of appetite, decrease rumen contractions, decrease cud- chewing, and drop in milk production. While a displaced abomasum is not immediately life-threatening, veterinary care is required for surgical correction. Milder cases can be corrected by rolling the cow over or forcing her to run up a steep hill.DN: Displaced Abomasum Abomasitis is a relatively rare, but serious, disease of the abomasum whose causes are currently unknown.  As food  The abomasum is used to make the lampredotto, a typical dish of Florence. It is also fried and eaten with onions as part of the Korean dish Makchang gui. Another dish made with the abomasum is the Persian Sirabi- Shirdan (borrowed in Turkey as Şırdan).

Completed in 1901, it is a flat slab buttress dam constructed of steel, a relatively rare material for construction of dams, which are typically made of earthenworks, concrete, or masonry. Most sources indicate it was one of only three such dams constructed in the United States, the other two being the Ashfork-Bainbridge Steel Dam (1898, Arizona) and the Hauser Lake Dam (1907, Montana), the last of which failed within a year of construction. History In 1894, prior to the construction of the steel dam, the Atlantic Mining Company built a timber crib dam across the Salmon Trout River. The dam created a reservoir which supplied water to the Atlantic stamp mill which extracted copper from ore-bearing rock. With the growth of the Atlantic stamp mill and the construction of the Baltic Mining Company mill nearby, this reservoir proved to be insufficient, and in 1901 the steel dam was built. It was designed by J. F. Jackson and built by the Wisconsin Bridge and Iron Company. The old timber crib dam remained in place, submerged, upstream of the steel dam. A system of spillways, sluices (or launders as they are referred to in contemporary texts), and pipes brought water downhill to the stamp mills. The dam itself measures 74 ft (23 m) high at its center and extends for a length of 1,006 ft (307 m) across the river. Access to the reservoir was shared by the Atlantic and Baltic mines, which had a common board of directors. The dam operated for several decades, until the mines closed. After that time, the dam was no longer maintained. On Easter morning of 1941, the spillway behind the dam broke, causing a flood. There was little damage to the steel part of the dam, but with the mining operations stopped, the dam owners had the spillway valves opened. However, there were still incidents of overtopping,As illustrated in this: overtopping image and the Copper Range Company (successor to Atlantic Mine Company and owner of the dam) had large holes cut in it in 1979 so that it would not retain water. This lowered the level of the reservoir, revealing the earlier timber dam.The dam in this illustration of the Dam article is actually the earlier timber crib dam replaced by the Redridge Steel Dam Ownership of the dam was transferred to Stanton Township in 1992. Fears that the timber dam might fail and Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality considering the dam a \\"significant hazard\\" forced the township to consider renovating the dam in 2001. Five options were proposed for a long-term fix for the dam. These options ranged from repairing the steel and wooden dams for $311,000 to restoring/ reconstructing the entire structure for over a million dollars. Stanton Township could not afford to do any of the proposed options, so another option was sought out. A short-term fix was found to make the dam safer. The upper 13 feet of the wooden structure was removed in 2004 to bring the water level down and relieve some of the pressure. A more permanent repair is still needed. A recent study by a team of students from Michigan Technological University determined that both dams are likely to remain safe for the foreseeable future. Redridge Steel Dam (upstream side, showing holes cut) The underside of the western end of the steel dam  Construction information  Steel dams use relatively thin steel plates in contact with the water body, with a framework of steel behind them transmitting the load to the ground. The plates are slanted upwards in the direction of water flow, so that the weight of the water puts compressive forces on the girders holding the plates up. This transmits force to the ground without the bending moment that a vertical wall of plates would engender. It was believed at the time that these dams could be constructed faster and more cheaply than masonry dams. Geography and site information HAER Redridge is in Houghton County, one of the more rugged counties in Michigan, and access to the dam site is relatively challenging, although there is a history of Michigan Technological University students making pilgrimages to the site, especially those interested in industrial archaeology.

Beginning in Amazing Adventures #16 (by Englehart with art by Bob Brown and Frank McLaughlin), the story continued in Justice League of America #103 (by Len Wein, Dick Dillin and Dick Giordano), and concluded in Thor #207 (by Conway and penciler John Buscema).Amazing Adventures #16 (Jan. 1973), Justice League of America #103 (Dec. 1972), and Thor #207 (Jan. 1973) at the Grand Comics Database Awards She has been recognized for her work in the industry with a Shazam Award for Best Colorist in 1973.1973 Academy of Comic Book Arts Awards, Comic Book Awards Almanac Bibliography Comics work includes (incomplete): * 2001: A Space Odyssey #4–5 * Adventure Comics #457–459, 467–471, 473 * Amazing Adventures #16, 17, 20 * Amazing Adventures Vol. 2 #1 * The Amazing Spider-Man #127, 151–182, 184, 198, 200, 223–225, 228–230, 233, 235, 239, 241, 252–253, 255, Annual 13, Giant-Size 1–2 * Astonishing Tales #1 * Avengers #110, 119, 155 * Batman #308, 313–315, 317–319, 321–322 * Battlestar Galactica #5, 23 * Fantastic Four #137, 154–155, 161, 184–188, 190–192, 196, 203, 205, 208–209, 232–233, 236–237, 239–244, 246–248, 251–263, 265–306, 308–309, 316 * Magik (Illyana and Storm) #1–3 * New Mutants #1–5, 7–11, 13–15, 17–34, 37–39, 41, 43, 45–51, 53–60, 62, 64–73, 75–78, 80, 82–86, 88, 90 * New Mutants Annual #2–4 * Nova #9, 12, 25 * Phoenix (1984) #1 * Power Man (1974) #17–19, 31, 62 * Power Pack #1–10 * Prince Namor, The Submariner #1–2 * Rom #2, 16, 62 * Sabre #1 * Spectacular Spider-Man #3, 45, 47, 60, 69–70, 84, 89, 91, 94 * Spider-Man Megazine #1, 3 * Spider-Woman #1, 7, 24–25 * Star Wars #5, 28, 39, 41–44, 46–47, 53–54, 56, 61, 64–70, 75–86, 89, 91–92 * Star-Lord Special #1 * Strange Tales #169–174, 179 * Submariner #60, 63–64, 69 * Superboy #247 * Superman #336–344 * Supernatural Thrillers #8, 10 * Thor #208–210, 213, 219–220, 225, 242–248, 250–253, 255–271, 277–279, 284, 286, 288, 291, Annual 6–7 * Tomb of Dracula #8–9, 19–20, 57 * Uncanny X-Men #113–114, 116–133, 136–148, 150, 153, 155, 157–163, 166–168, 171–204, 206–235, 237–253, 255–260, 262–263, 267–272, 275, 279, 294, 300, Annual 3–8, 11–12, 17 * Untold Legend of the Batman #1–3 * Werewolf By Night #5–8 * What If? #2, 13, 18, 28, 32–33, 35 * Wolverine (1982) #1–6, 12–13, 15–18 * Worlds Unknown #4, 7 Notes References American female comics artists Living people Marvel Comics people Place of birth missing (living people) Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Glynis Oliver"},{"id":"3493133","text":"Davis Islands is a Tampa neighborhood and archipelago on two islands in Hillsborough County, Florida. Its proximity to Downtown Tampa and its views of the Port of Tampa have made it a popular area to live. The area's population was 5,474 at the 2010 census. About Davis Islands Palace of Florence Apartments on Davis Islands Villa de Leon Davis Island is also home to Peter O. Knight Airport and Davis Island Yacht Club. Also on the Islands are the Marjorie Park Municipal Yacht Basin & Marjorie Park at 115 Columbia Drive and the Seaplane Basin just South of the Airport. Marjorie Park was donated to the City of Tampa and named by Davis after his wife Marjorie Merritt Davis. With a canal fully separating a portion of the island from the rest of it, Davis Islands is technically an archipelago, hence the plural form \\"Islands\\" in its name. Originally, Davis Islands consisted of three islands. With the construction of the airport, however, the end of one canal was filled in to make enough land area for a runway, connecting the two largest islands at their southern ends and reducing the archipelago's island count to two. Nearly all streets on the island are named after bodies of water or islands. They are loosely arranged in alphabetical order, beginning with Adalia Avenue (the first street crossed after arriving on the island from the only bridge that connects it to the mainland) and ending with Severn Avenue, the street farthest away from the bridge that leads to the main island's southernmost point, on which the Davis Island Yacht Club is situated. There are no traffic lights on Davis Islands. History Davis Island was built upon two man-made islands atop two small natural islands formerly known as \\"Little Grassy Key\\" and \\"Big Grassy Key\\" at the mouth of the Hillsborough River.History of Davis Islands The islands were built from mud dredged from the bottom of Tampa Bay in the 1920s and expanded. This dredge-and-fill operation was undertaken at the height of the Florida Land Boom by developer and Tampa native D. P. Davis. Davis then purchased all the dredged land for $350,000. He planned a resort community with three hotels, nine-hole golf course, airport, and swimming pool. D.P. Davis then sold 306 of the original lots for $1,683,582. The development stalled when the Florida land boom of the early 1920s wound down, and Davis was mysteriously lost at sea while making a transatlantic voyage in October 1926.https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1409/ Many of the original Mediterranean-style structures are still standing and have received national Historic Designation, as well as local protections. Buildings of note include the Palace of Florence and Mirasol. Today Davis Island is a mix of residential and retail areas. Most predominant today is an eclectic mix of architectural styles because of the slowdown in development in the 1930s. Business District East Davis Boulevard is the commercial area of the neighborhood. Along several blocks there are restaurants, cafes, bars, and shops in a tranquil sidewalk setting. The area is also very pet-friendly due to the pedestrian nature of the island.http://www.stpetersburgtimes.com/2002/05/10/Citytimes/Go_dogs_go.shtmlhttp://www.sptimes.com/2004/04/28/Hillsborough/Liquor_squabble_turns.shtmlhttp://www.tbt.com/bars/listing.jsp?ident=7600http://blogs.tampabay.com/wingman/2009/06/counting- down-tampa-bays-best-bars-no-60-to- no-41.htmlhttp://www.dibuzz.com/2009/09/30/anchor-bar/ Recreational facilities The Davis Islands Trail linear park was completed in 2010, with amenities such as benches and water fountains. The 10-foot-wide asphalt trail is 1.3 miles and runs from Channel Drive and Davis Boulevard to the parking lot at Peter O. Knight Airport. In 2014, the Roy Jenkins Pool reopened after a $2.5 million renovation. The 85-year-old building at 154 Columbia Drive has two pools, one with five swim lanes extending 75 feet and the other kiddie- sized. Other sports facilities include the Sandra W. Freedman Tennis Complex and an array of softball fields at Davis Islands Park. Famous residents Derek Jeter built a , seven-bedroom, nine-bathroom waterfront home in the vicinity, drawing comparisons to an aircraft carrier. The home dwarfs other nearby homes and is the largest home in the Tampa area. Other notable neighborhood residents include current Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady, former NFL player Brad Culpepper, former Tampa Bay Lightning captain Vincent Lecavalier, current Lightning players Steven Stamkos and Victor Hedman, and former Tampa mayor Bob Buckhorn.http://www.sptimes.com/2003/06/17/Floridian/He_s_ever_the_great_d.shtmlhttp://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/article1026935.ece Demographics Source: Hillsborough County Atlas As of the census of 2010, there were 5,747 people and 2,577 households residing in the neighborhood.

Ashton (born May 7, 1942) is the co-founder of WordPerfect Corporation and a former professor at Brigham Young University (BYU). Ashton worked for a time with Novell after the company bought WordPerfect, and subsequently founded Thanksgiving Point in Lehi, Utah. Career Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, Ashton began his work in computer science at the University of Utah, studying computing and music in the early 1970s. In 1977, Ashton began work on word processing when he created a specification for an improved console-based word processor. His specifications outlined various innovations at the time, including continuous documents, function key shortcuts, modeless editing, and primitive WYSIWYG formatting. Along with his student, Bruce Bastian, Ashton incorporated Satellite Software International, which would later become the WordPerfect Corporation, in September 1979. In 1987, Ashton left BYU to serve full-time as president and chief executive officer of WordPerfect Corporation. Ashton ran WordPerfect as a triumvirate, along with Bastian and W. E. \\"Pete\\" Peterson. Ashton and Bastian each controlled 49.5% of the company, and Peterson controlled 1%. While Ashton was the titular head of WordPerfect, Peterson ran the day-to-day operations, and was frequently misinterpreted as the head of the company by the press. Ashton's management style was hands-off. For a time, the entire development organization of WordPerfect reported directly to him. In 1990, Ashton was identified by Forbes magazine as one of the 400 wealthiest individuals in the United States. Ashton joined the Novell Corporation's Board of Directors in 1994, and resigned in 1996. Ashton is unrelated to Ashton-Tate, a database company and contemporary of WordPerfect in the 1980s. In April 1999, Ashton founded ASH Capital, a venture investment company controlled by Ashton and managed by James Savas and David Harkness. Thanksgiving Point After WordPerfect was acquired by Novell and Ashton's responsibilities were alleviated, he and his wife founded Thanksgiving Point. Thanksgiving Point is located in Lehi, Utah, within 20 miles of WordPerfect's former corporate headquarters in Orem. \\"We wanted to create something for the people around us,\\" says Ashton. \\"We've been blessed financially and with a large family. We wanted to give something back to the community and the families in our area.\\" Today, Thanksgiving Point provides the community with a place where adults and children can learn about farming, gardening and cooking. It also has a championship caliber golf course, a museum of ancient life, a children's curiosity museum, a 55-acre themed garden, and a movie theater.

Deliveries began in 1986. The United States Air Force employs the craft as the C-38 Courier. A later derivative known as the G150 was launched in 2002. Gulfstream announced the final sale of the G150 in September 2016 and the last delivery by mid-2017. Design and development IAI Astra at the 1988 Paris Air Show Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) developed the Astra from its Model 1124 Westwind business jet. Work on an improved Westwind began in the late 1970s,Relman 1993, p. 314. with the first prototype flight on 19 March 1984.Relman 1993, p. 316. The first production Astra flew on 20 March 1985, with FAA certification granted on 29 August 1985 and customer deliveries starting in 1986. The original 1125 Astra was replaced by the Astra SP, announced in 1989; 37 were built. The third variant, the Astra SPX, flew for the first time in August 1994. This variant was renamed G100 from September 2002 following Gulfstream's acquisition of Galaxy Aerospace, which held the Astra type certificate, in May 2001. In September 2002, Gulfstream announced the improved G150, based on the G100. This last variant features a wider (12 in) and longer fuselage (16 in aft of rear pressure bulkhead) updated avionics and an increase in maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) to compared to the G100's MTOW of . It was certified by the FAA in late 2005. It has been certified for the steeper-than-normal approach path required to land at London City Airport.G150 Steep Approach to London City approaches reach 5.5 degrees Aviation Week. Accessed: 9 January 2011. Production of the G100 was discontinued following certification of the G150. IAI continued to manufacture G150s in Israel and the completed airframes were then flown to the U.S. for interior outfitting. In September 2016, Gulfstream announced that, owing to slow sales, production would be stopped, with delivery of the final aircraft due in mid-2017. The Astra was further developed in the 1990s; the wing was modified and mated to a completely new fuselage. This development became the IAI Galaxy (later the Gulfstream G200).\\"The Israel IAI-1126 Galaxy/Gulfstream G200\\" By 2018, Gulfstream G150s from 2006–2008 were in the range of $3.8 to $4.8 million.

The C-38A was operated by the 201st Airlift Squadron at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. The C-38A replaced the earlier Learjet C-21. The C-38A differs from the standard Gulfstream G100, being fitted with various military avionics systems. The C-38A was also ordered for the United States Navy, replacing North American T-2 Buckeyes at Naval Air Station Patuxent River beginning in September 2015.

It first aired on 11 November 1963, during the first season. The title was re-used in 2002 for an episode with an unrelated plot. Introduction Doctor James Hamilton develops a device that allows him to experience the thoughts and feelings of another person. Opening narration Plot At a military outpost in Greenland, Project Engineer Maj. Brothers (Guardino) begins losing his grip on reality - while wrestling with guilt and remorse - after losing one of his soldiers in an icy crevasse. Mentally haunted by a spectre of the dead man, Brothers decides he must detonate an atomic device to obliterate the crevasse, along with any implicating evidence of self-imposed incompetence - and the outpost, as well - to purge himself of his emotional anguish. The outpost's psychiatrist, Dr. Hamilton (Merrill), uses a revolutionary mind probe machine in an attempt to understand what is driving Brothers mad. During the experiment, Hamilton learns of the officer's plan to destroy the outpost as their minds join for a split second. When an unexpected earthquake causes the device to malfunction, the minds of Hamilton and Brothers are switched. This new identity enables the insane officer to set about his plan for destruction while in the guise of the doctor, with the real doctor - now in the guise of the disturbed officer - confined to a padded cell, desperately trying to warn everyone of the impending doom. When Hamilton's administrative assistant, Ingrid (Kellerman), who had earlier expressed her love for the doctor, reads his notes that were taken prior to the experiment, she learns of the possible exchange of minds between the two men. Ingrid then comes by the cell to talk with Brothers about his claims of really being the doctor, where he convinces her that he is actually the man she loves by revealing an intimate detail regarding their relationship; something that the officer would know nothing about. Now realizing that the wrong man is behind bars, she helps him to escape. Meanwhile, attempting to obtain information from another officer on how to detonate the bomb, Brothers is ordered to return to the doctor's office, where he encounters Hamilton and Ingrid. Brothers, intent on killing Hamilton before he can expose his true identity, is mortally wounded during Hamilton's attempt to attach the electrodes from the mind probe machine - with help from Ingrid - to himself and to Brothers. At the final moment of the process, just before Brothers dies, Hamilton's mind is successfully returned to his body. Afterwards, both Hamilton and Ingrid try to make sense of the ordeal, while wondering how to explain the unbelievable circumstances surrounding Brothers' death, with Hamilton suggesting that they simply tell the truth - Maj. Brothers shot himself. Closing narration Cast * Gary Merrill - as Dr. James Hamilton * Harry Guardino - as Maj.

The birdbeak dogfish has a very long, narrow snout, no anal fin, two long and low dorsal fins with grooved spines, small rectangular pectoral fins, and pitchfork-like denticles. It lives at depths between 73 and 1,450 m. It is ovoviviparous with up to 12 pups per litter. It eats bony fish and shrimp. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the birdbeak dogfish as \\"Not Threatened\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. A study published in the Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom evaluated the reproductive strategy of the female deep-water shark birdbeak dogfish. This research article discovers that there is a close relationship that exists between Hg level of pregnant females and the Hg level of their embryos, which indicates that there is a transfer of mercury from maternal sources.

Until 1996, it was an Amtrak station, as well as a railroad stop for the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific Railroads. Union Station was served by Amtrak's Los Angeles-New Orleans Sunset Limited and Los Angeles-Chicago Texas Eagle. The station is on the National Register of Historical Places.  Architecture  Phoenix Union Station (center) anchors the south end of downtown Phoenix Union Station was constructed in 1923 by the Santa Fe and the Arizona Eastern (Southern Pacific) Railroads. The Station is one of the best examples of Mission Revival architecture, along with Brophy College Preparatory, in Phoenix. The Mission Revival style, a popular building style between 1890 and the 1920s, was typified by such Union Station features as stucco wall finishes, arcades, red tiled roofs, curvilinear gables, massive piers, and impost moldings. According to the \\"Phoenix Historic Building Survey\\" by the Phoenix City Council, September 1979: ; Historic Name: Union Station of the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe Railroads ; Description : A large Mission Revival railroad station with a central two-story waiting room structure between long, low arcaded wings. Red-tiled, gabled roofs are terminated by high parapet walls that are shaped with the familiar curves of the Mission Revival at the ends of the wings and in entrance pavilions at both the railroad and street sides of the central pavilion. In keeping with the character of the Mission Revival there are few other decorative details. : The waiting room is a high, beamed space with original wooden furnishings and particularly fine ceiling light fixtures. There have been some alterations in the waiting room, and the arcaded wings which were originally open as passenger waiting areas have been enclosed. A microwave transmitting tower next to the central pavilion is out of harmony with the structure ... ; Significance: : Union Station was a joint venture between the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe Railroad Companies and was designed by their architect, Peter Kiewit. Dedicated on September 30, 1923, the building was proclaimed a \\"Monument to the progressiveness and prosperity of the valley and a testimony of the confidence in the future of the Salt River Valley and Phoenix.\\" : A milestone in Phoenix's development, Union Station ushered in tourism on a grand scale and promoted greater national visibility.  History  Rob Bohannan presented this history at ARPA's dedication of the clock and plaque donated by ARPA members, January 11, 1992. Used with permission: In 1995, the last full year Amtrak stopped at Union Station, 21,495 passengers boarded or alighted here. Since Amtrak left in 1996, the Olympic Torch train has stopped here twice, and tourist trains like the GrandLuxe (formerly American Orient Express) have also occasionally used Union Station. In 2000, the Arizona Department of Transportation and the Arizona Rail Passenger Association presented \\"Transpo 2000,\\" an exposition of a modern Talgo trainset at Union Station. = Historic designations = * National Register of Historic Places #NPS 85003056 * Phoenix City Register  Current services  No regular passenger trains call at Union Station. However, as recently as 2010, there were efforts to bring back passenger rail service to Phoenix. Amtrak operates the Sunset Limited three times a week from the town of Maricopa, which is in Pinal County thirty miles south of downtown Phoenix. A private company, White's Taxi Shuttle, operates a taxi service to the Phoenix metro area; as of April, 2017 there is Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach service to and from Maricopa with stops in Tempe and Phoenix (including Sky Harbor airport). The Sunset Limited also directly serves Tucson, and many Phoenix passengers travel to Tucson as an alternative to boarding the train in Maricopa (Greyhound operates frequent daily motorcoach service between Phoenix and Tucson; the Tucson Greyhound depot is about one-half mile east of the Tucson Amtrak station). Amtrak's Southwest Chief train route operates through Flagstaff daily, and Amtrak provides guaranteed through-ticketed Thruway Motorcoach connecting shuttle service via Airport Shuttle of Phoenix or Arizona Shuttle from Metrocenter Mall (in north central Phoenix) and the town of Camp Verde (in Yavapai County) to and from the trains at Flagstaff. The nearest Valley Metro Rail station, City Hall (\\"Washington Street and Central Avenue and Jefferson Street and 1st Avenue\\"), is half a mile away.

His highlights with the Steelers included giving the eventual Super Bowl Champion 49ers its only loss in 1984, and guiding the Steelers to the 1984 AFC Championship Game against the Miami Dolphins. He was traded on April 12, 1988, to the San Diego Chargers for his last, full NFL season. He would play one more game in 1989 with the New York Jets. For his career Malone passed for 10,175 yards and 60 TDs, and rushed 159 times for 628 yards and 18 TDs. Malone also had one career reception for a 90-yard TD, a Steelers team record until Mike Wallace broke it with a 95-yard touchdown reception vs. Arizona in 2011. Malone's career, however, was plagued with several severe injuries. A September 1987 Sports Illustrated article on Malone recounted the knee injury he suffered against Seattle while playing wide receiver that forced him to miss the entire 1982 season after having surgery. Malone started only half the season in 1985 for Pittsburgh due to various injuries, and missed two games at mid season in 1986 with a thumb injury on his throwing hand. Among his more memorable games in the NFL include becoming the first quarterback in Steeler history to complete over 80% of his passes (minimum 20 attempts) in a game vs. San Diego on November 25, 1984 (18 completions in 22 attempts, 253 yards, 4 touchdowns, 1 interception); won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his opening day 1985 performance vs. Indianapolis (21 completions in 30 attempts for 287 yards, 5 touchdowns passing, 1 rushing) that included tying Hall of Famer Terry Bradshaw's team record for single game touchdown passes; passed for a career-high 374 yards on 26 completions with three touchdowns vs. Cincinnati on September 30, 1985; was the starting quarterback when Pittsburgh became the first visiting team to beat the Denver Broncos in the post season, leading the Steelers to a come from behind 24–17 victory in the 1984 AFC Divisional Game on December 30, 1984 (overcame two early fumbles to complete 17 of 28 passes for 228 yards and threw the game-tying touchdown pass to Louis Lipps); earned the final victory of his career as a starting quarterback against Pittsburgh, completing 17 of 24 passes, throwing a touchdown and scoring 1 rushing to lead San Diego to a 20–14 win over Pittsburgh on December 11, 1988; set a Steeler post season record (since eclipsed by Neil O'Donnell and Tommy Maddox) for single-game passing-yards for his 336-yard performance vs. Miami in the 1984 AFC Championship Game (completed 20 of 36 passes; threw 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions). Sportscasting career After his playing career ended, Malone became a television sportscaster, working at WPXI in Pittsburgh and ESPN, where he was a host and analyst on the programs NFL Matchup, NFL Live and NFL 2night. He became a four-time Emmy Award Winner as the sports director at WBBM-TV in Chicago from 2004 until 2008, when his contract was not renewed (amongst others at the station) in an effort to cut costs. Malone then moved to Westwood One as a color commentator for its NFL coverage.

His television program Peter R. de Vries, misdaadverslaggever (Crime Reporter) (1995−2012) covered high-profile cases and set a Dutch television viewing record. In 2005, he started his own political party which was disbanded soon after. Early life and career Peter Rudolf de Vries was born on 14 November 1956 in Aalsmeer in the Netherlands. He went to primary school in Amstelveen and to secondary school in Amsterdam. From 1976 to 1977 he was enlisted in military service, where he achieved the rank of sergeant. Biografie .

In 1987, he resigned from De Telegraaf and became chief editor of the weekly magazine Aktueel, which he transformed into a crime magazine. Aktueel periode . Retrieved on 2008-02-03. Investigative journalism De Vries has worked for several publications in the past and has been an independent crime journalist since 1991. He investigated the murder of Christel Ambrosius, and revealed that Mabel Wisse Smit knew the drug lord Klaas Bruinsma better than she had previously admitted. Another important issue in his show was a found floppy-disk. This disk contained detailed information from AIVD research, the Dutch secret service. It turned out that the service observed the murdered politician Pim Fortuyn; the service thought that he had sexual relations with Moroccan men. =The kidnapping of Freddy Heineken= In 1983 De Vries followed the case of the kidnapping of Freddy Heineken for the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf. He attended proceedings and sometimes visited the hotels in France where the kidnappers Cor van Hout and Willem Holleeder were being held under arrest. He wrote two books based on his investigation. The first was De zaak Heineken (The Heineken Case, 1983), released in the same year as the kidnapping. This was followed by De ontvoering van Alfred Heineken (The Kidnapping of Alfred Heineken, 1987), a novel from the perspective of Cor van Hout based on interviews De Vries conducted with Hout en Holleeder over a period of four weeks during his last hotel arrest in Évry, Essonne in 1986. The novel was later adapted as Kidnapping Freddy Heineken (2015) starring Anthony Hopkins. In 1994 De Vries tracked down Frans Meijer, one of the kidnappers, in Paraguay. =Police corruption investigation= On 13 September 2006, De Vries was arrested in Oisterwijk and detained for several hours in Tilburg when he tried to confront a police officer with allegations about questionable actions concerning the inheritances of elderly women.

In the first half of 2006, De Vries and Wim Dankbaar produced a two and a half hour special about the 1963 assassination of U.S. president John F. Kennedy. In what has been De Vries' longest show to date, he spent two weeks in Texas speaking with former CIA and FBI agents and the ex-girlfriend of Lee Harvey Oswald. One of the interview subjects, James Files, said he was the gunman responsible for taking Kennedy's life. Files contradicted the findings of the Warren Commission and claimed that the CIA and the mafia were involved in the assassination. =Natalee Holloway disappearance= In November 2006, a program by De Vries was broadcast in which he accused Joran van der Sloot, one of the prime suspects in the disappearance of Natalee Holloway, of her disappearance in Aruba. On 11 January 2008, Van der Sloot threw a glass of red wine into De Vries' face right after a live broadcast of the Dutch talk show \\"Pauw & Witteman\\" on which De Vries and Van der Sloot (with his parents) had been guests. The wine got into De Vries' eyes and briefly it seemed to have caused him a considerable amount of pain. During the tense but peaceful conversation during the broadcast, De Vries had on several accounts challenged Van der Sloot's integrity.Van Der Sloot Slings Wine. Retrieved on 2008-02-03. On 31 January 2008, De Vries said to the media that he knew what had happened in the case of Natalee Holloway. He shared his findings with the police, stating that he would publicly show this new-found evidence in a special episode of his television program. TV guide. Retrieved on 2008-02-04. On 3 February 2008 the undercover video aired on Dutch television showing Van der Sloot purportedly smoking marijuana and admitting to being present during Holloway's death. The show was watched by 7 million viewers in the Netherlands and was the most popular non-sports program in Dutch television history. Patrick van der Eem, working undercover for De Vries, had befriended Van der Sloot, who was unaware that he was being taped when he said that Holloway had suffered some kind of seizure while having sex on the beach. After failing to revive her, he said that he summoned a friend named Daury, who loaded her on a boat and dumped her body into the sea. The prosecutor in Aruba determined the video was admissible, but the evidence was deemed insufficient to warrant re- arrest. Although the taped confession appeared damning, Van der Sloot argued that he was lying to impress Van der Eem, who he believed was a drug dealer. Van der Eem said that ABC paid US$830,000 to secure the rights to broadcast the program in the United States. De Vries wrote the introduction to the June 2008 book Overboord: hoe ik Joran van der Sloot aan het praten kreeg (Overboard: how I got Joran van der Sloot to talk) in which Van der Eem recounts his experience with Van der Sloot with transcripts of the undercover video. On 22 September 2008, in New York, De Vries accepted an International Emmy Award in Current Affairs for his coverage while accompanied by Natalee's mother Beth Holloway. =Joran van der Sloot sex trafficking= Police photo of Joran van der Sloot In November 2008, De Vries aired undercover footage of Van der Sloot making preparations for the apparent sex trafficking of Thai women in Bangkok. De Vries claimed that Van der Sloot was making $13,000 for every woman sold into prostitution in the Netherlands. Van der Sloot used the alias of \\"Murphy Jenkins\\" to avoid Thai authorities. Peruvian Minister of Justice Aurelio Pastor said that Thailand is pursuing criminal charges against Van der Sloot. According to The National Enquirer, he is being investigated for his involvement in the disappearance of young women he may have recruited for a Thai sex slave gang while posing as a production consultant for a modeling agency that would send them to Europe. =Death of Mariska Mast= In August 2010, De Vries traveled to Subiaco, Western Australia in an attempt to interview dive instructor Daniel Ian Ross, who is being sought through Interpol for the August 2008 death of 23-year-old Dutch tourist Mariska Esmeralde Mast at the Honduran island of Roatán. Ross was initially arrested and released after surrendering his British passport with instructions not to leave the island. Ross, who has dual citizenship, then used his Australian passport to leave the island. Ross denied responsibility for the death through his lawyers in Australia, which does not have an extradition treaty with Honduras. An autopsy report stated that Mast died of blunt force injuries and asphyxiation resulting from strangulation. His flatmate Jisoo Han, who helped take Mast to the hospital, was later arrested and is under house arrest in Honduras. Han publicly appealed to Ross to come forward and exonerate her. Ross called the police when De Vries attempted to contact him at his home on 19 August. De Vries was arrested and paid a $200 fine for disobeying a police order to move on. On 6 September Perth magistrate Giuseppe Cicchini rejected an application by Ross for a restraining order against De Vries, who had by then left the country. De Vries criticized the Western Australia Police for arresting him, stating: \\"I didn't touch him, I didn't insult him, I didn't threaten him... This is a homicide case and I tracked him down and now you're putting me in jail. That's the world upside down.\\" =Documentary work with Beth Holloway= On 11 September 2010, De Vries traveled to Lima, Peru with his television crew and Beth Holloway to visit Miguel Castro Castro prison where Joran van der Sloot was being held while awaiting trial for the murder and robbery of Stephany Tatiana Flores Ramírez. According to Van der Sloot's attorney Maximo Alonso Altez Navarro, his client was taken to meet them \\"practically by force.\\" Altez Navarro stated that the meeting with Holloway took \\"less than one minute,\\" with Van der Sloot saying that he could not speak to her without his lawyer present and handing her his business card. Altez Navarro claimed that Holloway was \\"snuck\\" into the prison without being identified by the media crew who she was with. A prison spokesperson stated that Holloway's name was not found in the visitor registry. The group was removed from the prison, reportedly after a hidden camera was discovered by the guards. Representatives for Holloway and De Vries denied that a hidden camera was involved nor was anything seized. Colonel Abel Gamarra of the National Police of Peru stated that no arrests had been made. While in Peru, Holloway spoke with Flores Ramírez's brother Enrique on camera. On 17 September De Vries and the group left Peru for Panama and arrived in Aruba on the same day. He spent a few days in Aruba working with Holloway on a documentary about her missing daughter to be run on Dutch television, reportedly with the cooperation of prosecutors who had been investigating Van der Sloot.  Politics  In 2005, De Vries started a political party, Partij voor Rechtvaardigheid, Daadkracht en Vooruitgang (P.R.D.V. or Party for Justice, Action and Progress). On 31 October he presented his plans that mainly focused on changing the existing political culture in the Netherlands. Peter R.de Vries presenteert politieke partij To prove his point, he stated that an opinion poll on 16 December would decide whether he would actually continue his party or not, with a 41% cut-off point. Since only 31.4% thought De Vries would be a gain for Dutch politics, he decided to disband the party. Peter R.de Vries gaat niet de politiek in.

Named after the equatorial constellation Cetus, it was the only ship of the Navy to bear this name. Construction Cetus was laid down 21 November 1942 as liberty ship SS George B. Cortelyou, MCE hull 445, by Permanente Metals Corporation, Yard No. 2, Richmond, California, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract; launched 26 December 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Norman F. Potter; acquired by the Navy 4 January 1943; and commissioned 17 January 1943, Lieutenant Commander Nicholas T. Gansa, USNR, in command. Service history Cetus assignment, for which she sailed from San Francisco 1 February 1943, was carrying cargo among South Pacific bases, and from ports in New Zealand. She arrived at Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, 24 February, and began her share of the buildup of Solomon and Society Islands bases from which naval forces fought north through the Bismarcks. On 12 July 1944, she sailed from Guadalcanal for Eniwetok, where she prepared for her support of the invasion of Guam. She put to sea again 23 July, and arrived off Guam 27 July, 6 days after the initial assault. With bitter fighting continuing ashore, Cetus offloaded her much needed cargo over reefs and beaches, then returned to the South Pacific. In September and October 1944, Cetus brought cargo, some of which eventually played its part in the liberation of the Philippines, from Espiritu Santo to Ulithi and Manus. Cetus lay just outside Manus Harbor 10 November when ammunition ship exploded, but escaped injury. She returned to Auckland and Wellington, New Zealand, to load cargo after brief overhaul, and on 18 March 1945 arrived at Guam to aid in preparations for the invasion of Okinawa, carrying cargo to Saipan, and then to Ulithi. On 26 April she herself arrived off Okinawa, with cargo to support the determined fighting ashore. Cetus unloaded under the constant hazard of enemy air and surface suicide attack, but received no injury. She then sailed for San Francisco, arriving on 12 June for a major overhaul which kept her there until after the close of the war. Decommission and final disposition She proceeded on to Norfolk, Virginia, where she was decommissioned 20 November 1945, and returned to MARCOM the following day. She was laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, James River Group, Lee Hall, Virginia, 21 November 1945. She was sold to Hierros Ardes, S.A., Spain, for $71,520 on 26 October 1971, for scrapping. She was removed, 6 January 1972. Awards Cetus received two battle stars for World War II service.

He played primarily in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and National Basketball Association (NBA), and is the only player to have led both the NBA and ABA in rebounding. Nater was a two-time ABA All-Star and was the 1974 ABA Rookie of the Year. He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins, winning two National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) titles. Early life Swen Nater was born in the Netherlands, his parents divorcing when he was three years old. When his mother remarried and the family's economic situation deteriorated, she, her husband, and Swen's younger brother moved to the United States, leaving Swen and his sister in an orphanage. After three years it appeared they would remain in the Netherlands until a television show, It Could Be You (a forerunner to This Is Your Life), discovered the situation and brought the two siblings to America to be reunited—on TV—with the rest of the family. At age nine, he was in a new country and did not speak a word of English. Swen graduated from Long Beach Wilson High School in California. College career Nater attended and played basketball at Cypress College, a junior college in Cypress, California (where he met his wife, Marlene). He played little as a freshman, but was a Community College All-American as a sophomore. He earned a scholarship to UCLA, and redshirted his first year. Nater helped John Wooden's UCLA Bruins win two NCAA titles. He was a backup to Bill Walton, and averaged just 3.2 points and 3.3 rebounds per game as a senior. He never started a collegiate game—his primary role was helping to develop Walton in practice. Professional career Nater was drafted by The Floridians in the 1972 ABA Draft, and then by the Virginia Squires in the June 1972 ABA dispersal draft after the Floridians' demise.BasketballReference.com Swen Nater page RememberTheABA.com Virginia Squires detailed year by year notes page Nater was also drafted in the first round of the 1973 NBA draft with the 16th overall pick by the Milwaukee Bucks; he was the first NBA first-round pick to have played in the NCAA without ever starting a college game. In August 1973, he opted to sign with the Squires. On November 21, 1973 the Squires traded Nater to the San Antonio Spurs for a draft pick and $300,000. With the Spurs, Nater was the American Basketball Association Rookie of the Year and led the ABA in field goal percentage in 1974. He led the ABA in rebounding in 1975. He was named to the All-ABA Second Team in 1974 and 1975, and participated in the ABA All-Star Game both seasons. During his three seasons in the ABA, Nater played for the Spurs, Squires, and the New York Nets. Nater's NBA career began with the Milwaukee Bucks, and he was traded after one season to the Buffalo Braves. When the Braves played in San Diego, Nater became a local favorite. Nater led the NBA in rebounding average during the 1979–80 season, making him the only player ever to lead both the NBA and ABA in rebounding. Before the 1983–84 season, Nater was traded by the Clippers along with a just-drafted Byron Scott to the Los Angeles Lakers for Norm Nixon, Eddie Jordan, and a 1986 second-round draft pick (which would eventually be dealt to the Phoenix Suns and become Jeff Hornacek). Nater and Scott helped lead the Lakers to the NBA Finals that year, but the next season the team did not offer him a guaranteed contract. Nater played for Australian Udine in the Italian League, where he was the best paid player and led the league in rebounding even though the team ended up being relegated. The next season, he initially accepted an offer from Barcelona in the Spanish League, but ultimately he changed his mind and decided to retire. After the NBA He built the basketball program at Christian Heritage College in San Diego, California, and coached from 1985 to 1995. He left the position because it \\"was high on work and low on pay.” He was living in El Cajon, California, where his two daughters were born and raised. https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19970310&slug;=2528110 He then went to work for Costco, for whom he was a sporting goods assistant buyer.

The park derives its name from the Big Woods, a large, contiguous forested area covering much of southeast Minnesota prior to the arrival of European settlers. The park and its forest were an outlying 'woods' typical and similar to the Big Woods proper, which were historically found on the more recent glacier deposits located west of the Cannon River to the west. Aside from a small waterfall, the outstanding natural feature of the park is the forest itself. Natural history Hidden Falls, a small waterfall on Prairie Creek The Platteville Limestone formation, deposited almost 500 million years ago during the Ordovician Period, forms the bedrock of the park. The limestone is exposed only in a few places along Prairie Creek, most notably at Hidden Falls. The rest of the park is covered in glacial drift up to deep.Nerstrand Big Woods State Park, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources A later glaciation passed to the west, from which meltwater flowed and enlarged the valley of Prairie Creek. This area was once covered in spruce forest, but as the climate warmed after the end of the last ice age, oak stands and prairie became dominant. 400 to 500 years ago the climate cooled slightly, promoting the growth of the Big Woods. In the spring native wildflowers bloom in abundance. A remnant population of the dwarf trout lily, an endangered plant endemic to this area, is present in the park. Cultural history The town of Nerstrand was settled in the 1850s, though unlike most prairie farming communities they were fortunate to have a stand of trees nearby. Following a pattern of their European homeland, the adjacent forest was divided into woodlots, typically of each, which the individual owners managed according to their own needs. The timbers and planks for most of the area's barns, and some of its houses, were cut from old-growth oak present in the area that is now the park. Some lots were cleared for farming or grazing, but many were left as sustainable sources of firewood. This mosaic of uses created patches where native animals and plants could survive and then recolonize other lots as usage changed over the years, resulting in the high quality of the habitat today. In the 1930s large lumber companies attempted to acquire the land for logging. However, the lots were divided among 169 owners, not all of whom even lived in Minnesota anymore, and buying enough land to log commercially proved to be so complicated that each company gave up. Local requests to evaluate Nerstrand Woods as a state park site were received favorably by Minnesota officials in 1934. However the diverse ownership situation which preserved the woods in the first place also stalled the acquisition of parkland. Legislative bills failed and local interest waned, but in 1938 a new federal law allowed the United States Forest Service (USFS) to purchase land here and swap it for state-owned land within Superior National Forest. By 1944 the USFS had title to and a bill officially authorizing Nerstrand Woods State Park passed the next year. A unique clause was inserted in the legislation giving the University of Minnesota the option to conduct forestry experiments in suitable park areas. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources purchased more of the woodlots during a series of offers starting in the 1950s, expanding the park to cover approximately two square miles, though some private inholdings remained. Trails and a picnic area were developed, followed by a campground in the 1960s. In 1992 the park's name was modified to Nerstrand Big Woods State Park to emphasize the habitat it preserved. Acquisition of inholdings and surrounding land continues, with recent acquisitions including the former Nerstrand Town Dump to the northwest of the park, and a dairy farm to the east. Recreation Park facilities include individual and group campsites, picnic areas, a playground, and an extensive network of hiking trails. The park is unique among Minnesota state parks in that it has neither access to a body of water suitable for recreation nor a major historical site. The park is lightly utilized, with vacant campsites on every night except major summer holidays such as Memorial Day and Labor Day, according to DNR statistics. The southern half of the park is open to snowmobiles during the winter months, while the northern half is reserved for cross-country skiing. References *Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.

Early life and education Kidd was born in Sylvester, Georgia, and attended local schools. She graduated from Texas Christian University with a B.S. in nursing in 1970. She worked in her twenties as a Registered Nurse and college nursing instructor at the Medical College of Georgia. She was influenced in her 20s by the writings of Thomas Merton to explore her inner life. In her 30s, she took writing courses at Emory University and Anderson College in South Carolina, now Anderson University, as well as studying at Sewanee, Bread Loaf, and other writers' conferences. Career She got her start in writing when a personal essay she wrote for a writing class was published in Guideposts and reprinted in Reader's Digest. She went on to become a Contributing Editor at Guideposts. Her first three books were spiritual memoirs describing her experiences in contemplative Christianity, the last telling the story of her journey from traditional Christianity to feminist theology. God's Joyful Surprise: Finding Yourself Loved (Harper SanFrancisco, 1988) is focused on abandoning a hopeless quest for perfection and accepting one is loved as one is. When the Heart Waits: Spiritual Direction for Life's Sacred Questions (Harper SanFrancisco, 1990) tells of her painful midlife crisis. Finally, The Dance of the Dissident Daughter: A Woman's Journey from Christian Tradition to the Sacred Feminine (Harper SanFrancisco, 1996), discussed her encounter with women's spirituality. Her first novel, The Secret Life of Bees (2002), is set during the American civil rights movement of 1964, telling the story of a white girl who runs away from home to live with a woman who now works as an independent bee-keeper and honey-maker with many of her sisters. It has been adapted as an award-winning play in New York and debuted off Broadway at the Atlantic Theater. The novel was also adapted as a movie of the same name by Fox Searchlight, starring Dakota Fanning, Queen Latifah, Jennifer Hudson, Alicia Keys and Sophie Okonedo. The Secret Life of Bees movie won two People's Choice Awards at the 35th annual awards ceremony, taking home Best Movie Drama and Best Independent Movie. Her second novel, The Mermaid Chair (2005), won the 2005 Quill Award for General Fiction. The story concerns a woman who upon coming home to an island off the coast of South Carolina becomes attracted to a Benedictine monk who is just a few months short of taking his final vows. The title refers to a chair in his monastery carved with mermaids dedicated to a female saint said to be a mermaid before her conversion and who is patroness of the island. It was adapted as a 2006 Lifetime movie of the same name. The movie starred Kim Bassinger and Bruce Greenwood. In 2006, Firstlight, a collection of Kidd's early writings, was published in hardcover by Guideposts Books; it was published in paperback by Penguin in 2007. After traveling with her daughter, Ann Kidd Taylor, to sacred sites in Greece, Turkey, and France, Kidd and Taylor co-authored a memoir, Traveling with Pomegranates: A Mother-Daughter Story. Published by Viking in 2009, it appeared on numerous bestseller lists, including the New York Times list and has been published in several languages. Her 2014 novel, The Invention of Wings, is set during the antebellum years and based on the life of Sarah Grimké, a 19th-century abolitionist and women's rights pioneer. The novel debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list and was later selected for Oprah's Book Club 2.0. In April, Kidd appeared in an interview with Oprah on OWN's Super Soul Sunday episode. Kidd's novel The Book of Longings, was published on April 21, 2020. It tells the fictional story of Ana, an educated woman who marries Jesus Christ. Her formerly privileged life changes greatly, and she is often left alone once Jesus begins his ministry. D. G. Martin calls it \\"an enriching and challenging read.\\" Personal life Kidd is married to Sanford \\"Sandy\\" Kidd. The couple have two children, Bob and Ann. She has lived in Charleston and Mt.

This Africa set film was shot mostly in Kenya. The music was composed by Nico Fidenco. Black Emanuelle was followed by a number of sequels, all revolving around follows the erotic adventures of Mae Jordan (played by Laura Gemser), a globe-trotting, hedonistic investigative journalist and photographer known to her readers as \\"Emanuelle\\". Her character has been described as \\"a strong and independent woman, sexually proactive, at the centre of wealthy young and old white men of power, and involved in any sort of depraved set and situation.\\"  Plot  Journalist and photographer Mae Jordan publishes her work under the name Emanuelle. She accepts an assignment from a diplomatic couple and starts a sexual relationship with both. Together they teach her the ways of the country and love.

William Meredith  Production  = Casting = According to the account in his memoir, Albertini came across a picture of Gemser at a travel agency while he was shooting in Kenya. Struck by her beauty, he located her agent in Gand (Belgium). Upon travelling there and telling him that he wanted her to star in a film, the agent tried to dissuade him, pointing out that she could hardly pose for a photograph properly, let alone act. Albertini, however, insisted. In the meantime, the producer had called together Angelo Infanti, Karin Schubert and Gabriele Tinti, and they started shooting in Kenya. After a few days, Gemser loosened up and began to act. Albertini's account omits that Gemser had already appeared in two films: Amore libero - Free Love and Emmanuelle: L'antivierge. = Title = Black Emanuelle was made to cash in on the success of the French film Emmanuelle with Sylvia Kristel, which was released the year before. Albertini claims it was he who omitted one m in the name of the lead character, in contrast to the French Emmanuelle character. It was deliberately omitted to avoid copyright claims.  Release  One version of this otherwise softcore film contains brief hardcore pornographic inserts.  Box office  Director Albertini remembers that the film was a huge success. He states that this was also due to the \\"beautiful costumes\\" () by Adriana Spadaro and to the soundtrack by Nico Fidenco, who Albertini had invited for the job. As Albertini remembers, the soundtrack record Black Emanuelle stayed in the hit parades for a long time.  The Black Emanuelle series  By 1976 came two Black Emanuelle follow-ups, one in title (Black Emanuelle 2 by Albertini) and one in plot (Emanuelle in Bangkok, a.k.a. Black Emanuelle 2, by Joe D'Amato), also triggering four quasi-sequels from 1977 to 1978 by D'Amato (under the title Emanuelle) and two Emanuelle women in prison films by Bruno Mattei in 1982 and 1983. = Black Emanuelle films by Bitto Albertini = * Black Emanuelle (1975) (with Laura Gemser). * Black Emanuelle 2 (a.k.a. The New Black Emanuelle) (1976) (with Shulamith Lasri). Black Emanuelle 2 differs greatly in plot than the first film, featuring Israeli actress Shulamith Lasri as Emanuelle Richmond, a supermodel going through a state of amnesia and locked in a mental institution in New York. The lead actor, as in the first film, is Angelo Infanti. Albertini's later movie, Il Mondo dei sensi di Emy Wong (1977, starring Chai Lee) was released as Emanuelle Gialla and Yellow Emanuelle in some markets. = Emanuelle films by Joe D'Amato = * Emanuelle in Bangkok (1976) * Emanuelle in America (1977) * Emanuelle Around the World (1977) * Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals (1977) * Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade (1978) Emanuelle in Bangkok that stars Laura Gemser as the journalist lead character 'Emanuelle' of the first Black Emanuelle film has the original Italian title of Emanuelle nera - Orient Reportage and is considered a genuine sequel directed by Joe D'Amato. The later D'Amato sequels that all have the same lead character but do not use the word nera (black) in their titles are noted to feature scenes of extreme violence and depravity (one controversial scene in Emanuelle in America shows a naked woman masturbating a horse). = Nico Fidenco's music = Kristopher Spencer calls Fidenco's scores to the Black Emanuelle films \\"by turns sultry and serious, fun and funky\\", and describes the instrumentation and sound typical of these soundtracks: = Emanuelle films by Bruno Mattei = * Violence in a Women's Prison (1982) * Emanuelle Escapes from Hell (1983) Four years after the release of the last Emanuelle film by D'Amato, the journalist character 'Emanuelle' played by Laura Gemser was revived by Bruno Mattei in two women in prison films: Violence in a Women's Prison where the real name of the character is given as Laura Kendall and Emanuelle Escapes from Hell (Emanuelle fuga dall'inferno a.k.a. Blade Violent - I violenti). Emanuelle Escapes from Hell was directed by Mattei and Claudio Fragasso under the collective pseudonym Gilbert Roussel. Uncut versions of several Emanuelle films contain scenes depicting actual penetration. Also Black Emanuelle and Emanuelle Around the World contain scenes where the Emanuelle character is seen having explicit sex. These scenes were created with hardcore inserts, using a body double. Laura Gemser never performed explicit sexual acts on film, nor was she informed that a body double would be used. Other films There are films that star Laura Gemser as a character other than Mae Jordan / Laura Kendall / 'Emanuelle' but that have, at one point or another, been promoted as Emanuelle films, especially in foreign releases. These films included even an earlier film that featured Gemser, Amore libero (1974), which saw a release with the English title \\"The Real Emanuelle\\". The name of Gemser's character had often been changed to Emanuelle in the English dubbing of such films. *The Real Emanuelle (Amore Libero - Free Love, 1974), directed by Pier Ludovico Pavoni. *Emmanuelle on Taboo Island (La Spiaggia del desiderio, 1976), directed by Enzo D'Ambrosio & Humberto Morales. *Black Cobra Woman / Emmanuelle Goes Japanese (Eva nera, 1976), directed by Joe D'Amato. *Black Emanuelle, White Emanuelle / Emanuelle In Egypt (Velluto nero, 1976), directed by Brunello Rondi. *Sister Emanuelle (1977), directed by Giuseppe Vari. *Emanuelle & the Porno Nights (Le notti porno nel mondo, 1977), directed by Bruno Mattei. *Emanuelle in the Country (L'Infermiera di campagna, 1978), directed by Mario Bianchi. *Emanuelle's Daughter / Emanuelle's Sweet Revenge (I mavri Emmanouella, 1980), directed by Elia Milonakos. *Divine Emanuelle: Love Cult (Die Todesgöttin des Liebescamps, 1981), directed by Christian Anders. *Emanuelle: Queen of the Desert (La Belva dalle calda pelle, 1982), directed by Bruno Fontana. *Emanuelle's Perverse Outburst (Le dechainement pervers de Manuela, 1983), directed by Joe D'Amato.

Named a spelling variation of the star Alnitak in the constellation Orion, it was the only ship of the Navy to bear this name. Construction Alnitah was laid down 10 December 1942, as liberty ship SS John A. Logan, MCE hull 451, by Permanente Metals Corporation, Yard No. 2, Richmond, California, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract; launched on 14 January 1943; sponsored by Mrs. T. W. Ludington; acquired by the Navy on a bareboat basis on 7 October 1943; converted for naval service at San Pedro, California, by Los Angeles Shipbuilding Corp.; renamed Alnitah on 11 October 1943 and simultaneously designated AK-127; and placed in commission at San Pedro on 27 November 1943, Lieutenant Commander Ernest J. Youngjohns, Jr., USNR, in command. Service history Following a brief period of shakedown training, the ship took on cargo and personnel at Port Hueneme, California, for transportation to the South Pacific. She departed the California coast on 12 December, and reached Espiritu Santo on 3 January 1944. On that same day, Alnitah reported to Service Squadron 8 for duty as an interisland transport. Among her ports of call were Guadalcanal and Florida Island, Solomon Islands; Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides; Treasury Islands; Russell Islands; Fiji Islands; Auckland, New Zealand; Nouméa, New Caledonia; Milne Bay, New Guinea; Ulithi, Caroline Islands; Tinian and Guam, Mariana Islands; and Okinawa. Alnitah continued her routine of transporting cargo and personnel throughout the Pacific theatre of operations into late July 1945. The ship departed Saipan on 28 July, and shaped a course for the west coast of the United States. During her homeward voyage, Japan capitulated in mid-August ending World War II. After a two-day visit en route at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the cargo ship arrived at San Francisco, California, on 21 August, and received voyage repairs before the vessel resumed action on 25 September. She was subsequently assigned to Magic Carpet duty, which involved shuttling American military personnel from various points in the Pacific back home to the United States. USS ALNITAH departed Kwajalein Island, Marshall Islands 01NOV1945 and arrived San Diego CA 21NOV1945. The cargo ship made a voyage from San Francisco to Roi, Kwajalein, and Majuro Atolls in October. She touched back at Pearl Harbor on 12 November before continuing on to San Diego, California. Alnitah debarked her passengers before getting underway on 29 November, for Okinawa. The vessel arrived there on 22 December, and discharged her cargo and passengers. She operated in the Okinawa area through 4 February 1946; then sailed for the Philippines. The ship reached Subic Bay on 8 February and there embarked troops for transportation to Japan. Alnitah left Philippine waters on 16 February, and arrived at Yokosuka, Japan, on 23 February. Inactivation and decommissioning USS ALNITAH departed Kwajalein Island, Marshall Islands 01NOV1945 and arrived San Diego CA 21NOV1945. Upon her arrival preparations were begun to deactivate the ship. She was decommissioned on 11 March 1946, and was transferred to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) representative at Yokohama, Japan. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 28 March 1946. On 26 September 1947, she was laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Astoria, Oregon, as part of the \\"7th Group Libertys\\". She was sold for scrapping on 3 March 1961, to Zidell Exploration, Inc., for $52,887.87, with delivery on 12 April 1961.

He was the captain of Leicestershire in 2005, having some success in one-day cricket. In the 2006 season, Ackerman stepped down to concentrate on his batting. This move seems to have paid off as Ackerman scored 309 not out against Glamorgan at Sophia Gardens, the highest ever first-class score by a Leicestershire player. Ackerman's father, Hylton Michael Ackerman, played first-class cricket for Border, Natal, Northern Transvaal and Western Province in South Africa, and for Northamptonshire in England.

The site is now occupied by the modern village of Gümüslük. History Myndos was protected by strong walls, and had a good harbor. (Paus. ii. 30. § 8; Strabo xiv. p. 658; Arrian, Anab. i. 20, ii. 5.) Otherwise, the place is not of much importance in ancient history. Both Pliny (v. 29) and Stephanus of Byzantium (s. v.) mention Palaemyndus as an ancient Carian settlement near to Myndus, which seems to have become deserted after Dorian Mynduse was founded. (Comp. Strab. xiii. p. 611). Mela (i. 16) and Pliny (l. c.) also speak of Neapolis in the same peninsula and as no other authors mention such a place in that part of the country, it had been supposed that Myndus (the Dorian colony) and Neapolis were the same place. Pliny, however, mentions both Myndus and Neapolis as two different towns, and modern scholars differentiate the two. The cynic philosopher Diogenes of Sinope visited Myndos and noticed how large the city gates were, relative to the town; he cynically remarked; \\"Oh men of Myndos, I urge you to shut the city gates, as your town might exit from these!\\".DIOGENES LAERTIUS, LIVES OF THE PHILOSOPHERS, § 6.57 Sections of the town walls and gate have been restored with financial assistance from private companies. Myndian ships are mentioned in the expedition of Anaxagoras against Naxos. (Herod. v. 33.) Herodotus relates the story of how a captain from Myndus, Scylax, was found to have left no guards on his ship while a Persian force was preparing to attack the island of Naxos. The Persian commander, Megabates, flew into a rage and had him put in stocks, at which point Aristagoras, a tyrant from Miletus helping several Naxian oligarchs to retake Naxos, discovered what had happened to his guest- friend Scylax. Pleading with Megabates to no avail for Scylax, he released him anyway, incurring the Persian commander's wrath. The consequence of this falling out was that, according to Herodotus, Megabates warned the Naxians of what was afoot, ruining the expedition and in turn Aristagoras who, with nowhere to go, stirred up the Ionian Revolt. This is a classic example of Ionian αταξιη (lack of discipline, disorder, licentiousness), a charge commonly levelled at them, especially in the 5th century by Athens. At a later time, when Alexander the Great besieged Halicarnassus, he was anxious first to make himself master of Myndus; but when he attempted to take it by surprise, the Myndians, with the aid of reinforcements from Halicarnassus repulsed him with some loss. (Arrian, l. c.; comp. Hecat. Fragm. 229; Polyb. xvi. 15, 21; Scylax, p. 38; Ptol. v. 2. § 9; Liv. xxxvii. 15; Hierocl. p. 687.) Athenaeus (i. 32) states that the wine grown in the district of Myndus was good for digestion. Remains of the city are visible in and around Gümüslük and in the adjacent waters; it is supposed that some unrecorded earthquake caused seafront sections of the ancient town to be submerged. As a result, much of the land and offshore areas are protected from interference and development. Ecclesiastical history Myndus was an episcopal see of Caria, a suffragan of Stauropolis (Aphrodisias). The Notitiæ episcopatuum allude to it as late as the 12th or 13th century. However, only four of its bishops are known: Archelaus, who attended the First Council of Ephesus (431); Alphius, who assisted at the Council of Chalcedon (451); John who was present at the Third Council of Constantinople (680); and another John who went to the Second Council of Nicaea (787).Sophrone Pétridès, \\"Myndus\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia, 1911. full text The bishopric is included in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ), p. 931 Notable People * Alexander of Myndus, ancient Greek writer * Apollonius of Myndus, ancient Greek astrologer * Eusebius of Myndus, ancient Greek philosopher * Botryas of Myndus, ancient Greek writerPHOTIUS, BIBLIOTHECA EXCERPTS, § 190.9 * Zenon of Myndus, ancient Greek writerStephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica, § M462.3 Notes References External links * Gumusluk * Gümüslük Ancient Greek archaeological sites in Turkey Greek colonies in Caria Dorian colonies Ancient Troezen Ruins in Turkey Destroyed cities Former populated places in Turkey Geography of Muğla Province History of Muğla Province Buildings and structures in Muğla Province Halicarnassus Members of the Delian League Populated places in ancient Caria Bodrum District ","title":"Myndus"},{"id":"3493385","text":"Miss Prissy is a character in Looney Tunes.

Together with the other Elean colonies Bucheta and Elatea it was a city of the Cassopaeans, who were a sub-tribe of the Thesprotians. It was located south of the river Acheron. History Very little is known about its history, save that Pandosia and its neighbours Bucheta and Elatea were conquered by Philip of Macedon. He transferred the cities to the possession of Alexander I of Epirus. Alexander was allegedly warned by an oracle to beware of Pandosia and the Acheron river. When he left Epirus for a military campaign on the Italian Peninsula he thought himself to be safe, far away from the two places. He did not realize there was also a city called Pandosia and identically named river in Bruttium until it was too late. He was killed there during the Battle of Pandosia. Archaeology In 1994, archaeological surveys were started on small number of fortified town sites in Southern Epirus. The modern village Kastri is most frequently identified as the site of the ancient city. The ruins of an acropolis can be seen on a hill near Kastri. This site occupies and was investigated with an archaeological survey in 1994. Over 85,000 artifacts were uncovered, more than 15,000 pottery sherds and more than 70,000 tile and brick fragments. A definitive identification of this site as Pandosia has not been possible however, because Strabo described the city as situated to the south of the Acheron, but Kastri is just north of the river. This uncertainty has led to the suggestion that it might have been located much further inland at Gourana. Alternatively, the Acheron river might have changed its course over time to the south of the city.

Running for about in a general east–west direction, connecting Osgood, Milan, and Aurora. SR 350 was originally introduced in the 1931 routed between Milan and Aurora. The road was extended west to the Osgood in 1932. In 1950s the SR 350 had a couple of minor realignments and a segment was paved. The rest of the route was paved in the early 1960s. Route description SR 350 starts in Osgood at the corner of Buckeye Street and Beech Street. Buckeye Street runs northwest–southeast carrying U.S. Route 421, and Beech Street runs northeasterly from here carrying SR 350. The highway passes through residential neighborhoods, before leaving Osgood. After leaving Osgood the road turns more east–west passing through rural Ripley County. The highway enters the community of Delaware and has an intersection with SR 129. After SR 129 the road becomes southeast–northwest and heads towards Pierceville. In Pierceville the road parallels a CSX Transportation rail track, passing a few residential properties. East of Pierceville SR 350 turns towards the east leaves the rail track and passes through rural Ripley County for a short distance before entering the town of Milan. The highway passes through the northern part of Milan and an intersection with SR 101. After Milan the road turns towards the southeast and passes north of Moores Hill, before passing through rural Dearborn County. While in rural Dearborn County the road passes near Sparta, Mount Sinai, and just north of Wilmington. East of Wilmington SR 350 passes South Dearborn High School, before entering Aurora. In Aurora the roadway crosses over the south fork of the Hogan Creek. The SR 350 designation ends at an intersection with US 50 crossing northeast–southwest and SR 56 continuing towards the southeast. History SR 350 had its beginning in 1931 when it was designated, by Indiana State Highway Commission, from Milan to Aurora. By September 1932 SR 350 was extended west to an intersection with SR 29 (now US 421), in Osgood. The road was moved to its modern routing between Sparta and north of Milan between 1956 and 1957. Between 1957 and 1959 the road was rerouted around Mount Sinai onto the modern routing. At the same time the road was paved between the eastern in of the reroute and Wilmington was paved. The rest of SR 350 was paved between 1960 and 1961. Since the road was paved, SR 350 has not undergone any major changes.

In addition, the numbering plan area extends into the United States community of Hyder, Alaska, located along the Canada–United States border near the town of Stewart. The incumbent local exchange carriers that service the area code are Telus, Northwestel, and CityWest in the city of Prince Rupert. History Area code 250 was created on October 19, 1996, as a split of area code 604, which was retained by the Lower Mainland. Prior to 1996, 604 had been the sole area code in British Columbia for almost half a century. While British Columbia would have likely needed another area code in any event due to the province's growth in the second half of the 20th century, the split was hastened by Canada's system of number allocation. Canada does not use number pooling as a relief measure. Instead, each competitive local exchange carrier is allocated blocks of 10,000 numbers (corresponding to a single prefix) in each rate centre where it plans to offer service, even in the smallest hamlets. Once a prefix is assigned to a carrier and rate centre, it cannot be moved elsewhere, even when a rate centre has more than enough numbers to serve its customers. This has resulted in thousands of wasted numbers, a problem exacerbated by the proliferation first of fax machines and pagers and then cell phones. By the middle of the first decade of the 2000s, 250 was already on the verge of exhaustion, again due to the number allocation problem and the continued proliferation of cell phones—particularly on Vancouver Island and in the larger cities in the Interior. Amid projections that 250 would be exhausted by January 2008, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission began considering relief options in early 2007. Proposals included: * a geographic split that would have left 250 with the Interior, and switched Vancouver Island to a new area code * expanding area code 778, previously a concentrated overlay for Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley, to the 250 territory * concentrated overlays covering part of the 250 territory Several of the major landline and wireless providers in the 250 territory strongly favoured an overlay, saying it would be easier to implement than a split. They also wanted to spare themselves and their customers the expense and burden of changing their numbers, which would have required en masse reprogramming of cell phones. The proposal for a split would have forced Vancouver Island's residents to change their numbers for a second time in a decade. The CRTC announced on June 7, 2007, that 778 would be expanded to become an overlay for the entire province starting that July 4. On that date, exchanges in 778 became available to Vancouver Island and Interior residents, and a permissive dialling period began across British Columbia, during which it was possible to make local calls with either seven or ten digits. Three CO prefixes in the 250 area code were reserved for use by Northwestel, as 13 of its 15 switches at the time could not handle multiple area codes, and its system could not accommodate ten-digit-dialling. The CRTC decided on an overlay after concluding that there was not enough time to implement a split before 250 was due to exhaust in January 2008. Effective June 23, 2008, ten-digit dialling became mandatory throughout the entire province, and attempts to make a seven-digit call triggered an intercept message with a reminder of the new rule. After September 12, 2008, seven-digit dialling no longer functioned. Overlays have become the preferred method of area code relief in Canada, as they are an easy workaround for the number allocation problem as opposed to a split plan. On June 1, 2013, area code 236 was implemented as a distributed overlay of area codes 250, 604, and 778. It was expected to be exhausted by May 2020.

Professional career His career consisted mostly of time as a defensive back with the great Minnesota Vikings teams of the 1970s. He totaled 34 interceptions and three fumble recoveries in 156 professional games. He was never selected to a Pro-Bowl or given All-Pro honours. Wright was the defensive player who was covering Drew Pearson during the 1975 NFC Playoffs on the infamous Hail Mary pass in the 1975 NFC Divisional Playoff Game between the Dallas Cowboys and Minnesota Vikings, played on December 28, 1975. Some observers and Viking players believed that Pearson pushed off on Wright, causing him to fall down and thus allowing Pearson to catch the pass from Roger Staubach and score the winning touchdown. However no penalty was called on Pearson. College career He was an All-Conference player from two years at San Diego State University after transferring from Monterey Peninsula College before turning pro.

The population of the civil parish is less than 100 at the time of the 2011 Census. Details were included in the civil parish of Farlington, North Yorkshire. It is situated to the east of the villages of Stillington and Farlington, near Easingwold. Marton-cum-Moxby consists of the hamlets of Marton-in-the-Forest and Moxby. Today both Marton and Moxby are overwhelmingly agricultural in character. History Both Marton-in-the-Forest and Moxby Hall are mentioned in the Domesday Book as Martun and Molesbi respectively. Both were part of the Bulford hundred. The etymology of Marton comes from Old English of mere and tun meaning settlement in the marsh. The civil parish was formed from the ancient Marton-cum-Moxby parish that arose from the Augustinian priories of Marton (monks) and Moxby (nuns). Boundary changes transferred land to Sutton- on-the-Forest in 1882 and Farlington in 1887. Governance The parish is within the Thirsk and Malton UK Parliament constituency. It lies within the Stillington ward of Hambleton District Council and Stillington electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council. Geography The parish is bounded on the east by the River Foss and on the west by Farlington Beck. Much of the parish used to be a marsh prior to being drained by the nearby monasteries. Religion There is a functioning church in the parish dedicated to St Mary located at Marton-in-the-Forest. It is a Grade II* listed building built around 1540, though some parts indicate an older building. Notable buildings The Priory of St Mary was founded by Bertram de Bulmer in 1158 as a joint house of monks and nuns at Marton, although by 1167 the nuns had moved to Moxby. Bulmer endowed the priory with lands at Burnsall and Thorpe. Henry II granted Moxby land in Huby, and the churches of Whenby and Thormanby. Both priories were suppressed by Henry VIII in 1536 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The remains of both priories are now scheduled monuments.

He also worked as an animation background designer, magazine illustrator and screenwriter.  Biography  = Early life = Nicola Cuti was born on October 29, 1944 in Brooklyn, New York, the first of two sons of Alphonso Gitano Cuti, a darkroom technician, and Laura Antoinette Sica, a housewife. His grandparents had emigrated from Italy in the 1930s to make a home in America. His brother, Emil, was a medical technician and later sold medical supplies to hospitals. He served in the United States Air Force as an Air Policeman from 1966 to 1972, stationed at Toul Rossieres Air Base, France; Cigli, Turkey; and Bangor, Maine. His first published work, a comic strip, was published in a French magazine, Singular- Plural, and his first published story, “Grub” was published in Creepy Magazine while he was on active status in Bangor, Maine. After leaving the service, his first employment was at Krantz Animation Studio in New York City, which was under the direction of the legendary filmmaker, Ralph Bakshi. In 1972, while visiting his parents in Florida, he met a pretty[?] young blonde girl on the flight, Charlene Veselsky, and they were married six months later. Together they had a daughter, Jaymee, who worked as a journalist and is presently[?] in the publicity department of the Portland, Oregon Water Department. Nick and Charlene were divorced in 1995. =Moonchild= Starting in 1968, he self- published three underground comix featuring his first original character, Moonchild, a big-eyed, buxom innocent waif who had the ability to live in outer space without any life support systems. (Issue #2 of Moonchild was published in conjunction with Gary Arlington's San Francisco Comic Book Company.)Fox, M. Steven. \\"Moonchild #2\\", ComixJoint. Accessed Sept. 22, 2016. She was also featured in Mark Estren's book A History of the Underground Comics, in the first underground comic in full color, Weird Fantasies and in several issues of Cheri magazine. She was then published as a three issue miniseries, under the name Moonie, Moonchild the Starbabe, by MU Press with covers, writing, editing, pencils by Cuti and inks and lettering by Dave Simons. Cuti had long admired the work of comic artist Wally Wood and asked if Wood would look at his portfolio. Cuti did a single-page comic strip featuring Moonchild but it was never published in Wood's magazine Witzend; however, Cuti eventually became Wood's studio assistant at the Wood Studio in Valley Stream, Long Island. He worked on the strips Cannon and Sally Forth for Wood. When Charlton Comics was seeking an assistant editor, Cuti was interviewed by the new editor, George Wildman, and was hired. He worked for Charlton for four years and worked as assistant editor for Louise Simonson at Warren publishing and then as assistant editor to Len Wein at DC Comics. In 1986 a friend, Bill Dubay, had taken a job as art director for Marvel Films in California and invited Cuti to work as a background artist. Excited at the prospect of working in the animation field, Cuti moved his wife, Charlene, and daughter, Jaymee Rose, to California. For the next sixteen years he found employment as a freelance background designer for such studios as the Walt Disney Company, Universal Studios, Sony Pictures, Sunbow Entertainment, and many more working on such projects as Conan the Adventurer, Defenders of the Earth, 101 Dalmatians, Dilbert, Exo-Squad, Starship Troopers, and many other TV series. Cuti moved to Florida where he began writing and shooting indie movies for Creature Productions and then for his own company Ni-Cola Entertainment LLC. His big dream was to produce a movie based on his character, but he knew it would take a fortune to do Moonie properly and so he shelved the idea. In 2012, it was announced that the comic miniseries story \\"Moonie vs the Spider Queen\\" would be adapted by Temple of the Cave's Temple Immersive Audio as an AudioDrop, a short-form audio production. It was scheduled for release in April 2012. The production features Tom Nagel and Michael Cornacchia and is scripted and directed by Eric Paul Erickson from the original story by Cuti. Bill Black, a friend and fellow indie movie maker, had suggested to Cuti that instead of trying to produce a high budget version of Moonchild he should do it in episodes and use each episode as a means to finance the next episode. On September 12, 2012, Cuti began shooting the first episode of a three-part movie entitled Moonie and the Spider Queen, Episode One. The movie starred Nikoma DeMitro as Moonie, Anthony Wayne and William August as the space pilots. The shooting by cinematographer, Wheat, was completed on September 15. It was then edited by Randy Carter and composited with special effects by Stuart Scoon. The movie premiered on 16 August 2013 at the Fetish Convention, held in Tampa Bay and was put on sale on Amazon.com. In 2018, Cuti sold the Moonchild franchise to Nakoma DeMitro. The series is being rebooted with no known tentative release date. = Charlton (1972–76) = In 1972, when he was hired as the assistant to George Wildman, editor of the Charlton Comics in Derby, Connecticut. Charlton was a low-paying outfit that nonetheless produced a variety of comic book genres from 1946 until its demise in 1986, even after most publishers had long since turned to a steady diet of superhero titles. Cuti began turning out scripts for Charlton's horror and fantasy titles, working with artists such as Steve Ditko, Don Newton, Wayne Howard and Tom Sutton. He recruited younger artists such as John Byrne and Mike Zeck, who began freelancing for Charlton and illustrated some of Cuti's stories. In less than three years, Cuti produced well over 200 story scripts and text features for Charlton. In 1973, he teamed with Joe Staton, who collaborated with him in the creation of E-Man, a naive alien superhero who became a cult favorite. The character epitomized Cuti's disdain for the melodramatic, cape-wearing superheroes of other publishers. Cuti and Staton also co-created Michael Mauser, a grubby and uncouth private investigator, who began as an extra in E-Man but was quickly spun off into a series of his own. Both characters survived the implosion of Charlton and continue to the present, with Cuti and Staton collaborating on one-shots and series of new E-Man and Michael Mauser comics and stories. = Post-Charlton = Cuti left Charlton in 1976 and went back to work for Warren, producing more than 100 story scripts for Warren's horror and fantasy magazines, until that company's demise in the early 1980s. At various times he held the positions of contributing editor, assistant editor and consulting editor. During the same period, he taught himself the medium of scratchboard, emulating an artist he admired, Frank Kelly Freas. Cuti developed a realistic scratchboard style in contrast to his inked cartoon style and began selling illustrations to mainstream magazines such as Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine, Analog, Amazing Stories and Heavy Metal. After he left Warren, Cuti became an assistant editor and then digest editorInterview with Nick Cuti, Digest Comics (August 2008). at DC Comics, handling various superhero and children's titles and scripting his own six- part space opera, Spanner's Galaxy, illustrated by Tom Mandrake. He also scripted the final two Creeper back-up stories that appeared in The Flash.Flash #322-#323 Cuti moved to California in 1986 to begin work for animated TV series, producing background and prop designs for a dozen different studios, including Disney, Sony Pictures and Universal Studios. At the same time, he continued to write comic book scripts and create magazine and book art in both scratchboard and paint. Captain Cosmos, Cuti's homage to the TV space operas of his childhood, appeared in a series of comic books created in collaboration with Staton and also in Cuti's novel, Spin a Web of Death, three radio dramas and three short TV films. Moonchild returned to print in a three-part comic series in 1992 as Moonie, Moonchild the Starbabe and as novels in 2003. At a convention, his friend, partner, and actress for Moonie, Nakoma DeMitro, suggested he write a series for young girls since there wasn’t much out there for them in the science fiction field and Starflake the Cosmic Sprite was born. Like Moonie, she could live in outer space without any life support. = Films = In 2003, Cuti moved to Florida, where he scripted for independent films—some adapted from his Charlton and Warren scripts—and consolidated his Captain Cosmos TV series into a full- length feature film, Captain Cosmos and the Gray Ghosts. Films produced and written by Cuti include Grub, Shock House, Tagged!, The Lady Without Substance and Moonie and the Spider Queen\\". = Novels = Cuti wrote and illustrated text novels with his character \\"Moonie\\" as the heroine, Moonie and the Spider Queen (2009) (inks by Dave Simons), Moonie in the Slave Market of Opuul (2010) (inks by Mark Stegbauer),Moonie in Too Many Moons (2010) (inks by Mark Stegbauer) and \\"Moonie Moonie Goes to War\\". A fifth novel \\"Moonie and the Space Pirates\\" was written by a friend of Cuti's, Vic Stonecypher.Moonie and the Spider Queen Eventually, Cuti decided he had done all he could with Moonie, the Starbabe, and sold the series to DeMitro in order to concentrate on his newest creation, Starflake, the Cosmic Sprite. A contest was initiated to find a model for Starflake and Alicia Sage won the title. He wrote seven Starflake novels including, Starflake rides with the Galactic Bikers, Starflake hunts the Power Beast, and Starflake picks the Junkyard Planet. A Starflake Comic series was also created and published by his good friend, Kevin Glover. He was working on a young adult series of Starflake titled Starflake, Deep Space Ranger. Awards Cuti was twice awarded Warren’s Ray Bradbury Award for writing. In 2009, Cuti was awarded the Inkpot Award for career achievement and was given the award at the San Diego Comic-Con International.Wahl, Andrew. \\"CCI: Nicola Cuti Earns Inkpot Honor,\\" Comic Book Resources, July 23, 2009.

Career A native of Alcoi, at the age of 24 Montllor moved to Barcelona, where he was a member of various independent theater groups, including the CICF, and later with Núria Espert and Adrià Gual. In 1968, he began to sing songs with lyrics by songwriters such as Vincent Andrés Estellés, Pere Quart, as well as writing several songs by himself. Montllor was known for his deep voice and his histrionic on-stage manners, and went on to become one of the most talented members of the Nova Cançó movement, albeit one of the least popular. As a result of the tributes paid to him by internationally renowned artists such as Miquel Gil and Pascal Comelade, his work has received increased attention from music lovers in the last few years. Montllor's gift for acting led to him being cast alongside Lola Gaos in José Luis Borau's Furtivos, one of the most important films in the history of Spanish cinema. Illness and death Montllor died of esophageal cancer in Barcelona on 10 March 1995, at the age of 53. Five months earlier, his hometown of Alcoi had paid him an emotional tribute in recognition of his success. Tributes In 2005, on the tenth anniversary of his death, a series of tributes and celebrations in honour of Montllor took place throughout the Catalan countries. Also in 2005, Inadaptats, a Catalan independentist music band, recorded a CD entitled \\"Homenatge a Ovidi\\" (\\"A Tribute to Ovidi\\") with covers of 14 of Montllor's most famous songs. Valencian pro-independence band Obrint Pas dedicated their 2006 track \\"No Hem Oblidat\\" (We Have Not Forgotten) to Montllor.

Gill (July 13, 1919 – December 17, 2006)Social Security Death Index, Joseph P. Gill was an American magazine writer and highly prolific comic book scripter. Most of his work was for Charlton Comics, where he co-created the superheroes Captain Atom, Peacemaker, and Judomaster, among others. Comics historians consider Gill a top contender as the comic-book field's most prolific writer. Per historian and columnist Mark Evanier, Gill \\"wrote a staggering number of comics. There are a half-dozen guys in his category. If someone came back and said he was the most prolific ever, no one would be surprised.\\" Biography =Early life and career= Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Gill began writing for comic books for the New York City-based Timely Comics, the first predecessor of Marvel Comics, during the 1940s period fans and historians call the Golden Age of comic books. The vast majority of his work went unsigned, both in the manner of that time and during his staff- writing position at one company from the 1950s to 1980s, making a comprehensive bibliography difficult or impossible to compile. In addition, Gill's Timely stories were actually written, often pseudonymously for Funnies, Inc., an outsource \\"packager\\" that created comics on demand for publishers testing the waters of the then-new medium. His earliest confirmed credit is the one-page text story \\"Following Orders\\" in Novelty Press' Target Comics vol. 8, #11 (#89), cover-dated January 1948. As Gill recalled his start in the business, via his brother, Ray Gill, \\"My brother was an editor at Funnies, Inc., an editorial service that packaged comics for publishers. They put [publisher] [Martin] Goodman – who [owned] Marvel later – into comics, and did the first [comics] in my brother's office\\".Cooke, Jon B., & Christopher Irving. \\"The Charlton Empire: A Brief History of the Derby, Connecticut Publisher\\", Comic Book Artist #9, August 2000. Access date 2010-04-27. WebCitation archive. Gill is reportedly among the writers who scripted Captain America for Timely following the departure of character creators Joe Simon and Jack Kirby in late 1941.Mark Evanier, \\"Joe Gill, R.I.P.\\", POV Online (column of January 16, 2007). Around this time, Gill met future hardboiled detective novelist Mickey Spillane, a lifelong friend, who also began writing for Funnies, Inc. Following military service in World War II as a U.S. Navy radio operator – in which according to family lore Gill's ship was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine and Gill's signaling for help amid the sinking led to the rescue of many hands. Spillane and Ray Gill insisted Joe go into freelance writing with them. When superheroes fell out of favor in the post-war years, Gill began scripting teen-humor, Western and other genre comics for Timely. Following an industry downturn around 1948, he eventually found his way to the low-budget comic-book publisher Charlton Comics, based in Derby, Connecticut. =Charlton Comics and the Silver Age= There, beginning in the early 1950s, Gill became the company's primary staff writer for the next thirty years. He was known for his speed, often finishing a full-length comics script in a day and writing as much as an estimated 100 to 125 pages a week across a number of genres, from crime fiction to science fiction, romance to war stories. Superheroes were a minor part of Charlton; Gill created one of its first, Zaza the Mystic. He also did colorist work for the company. In 1960, as the industry was returning to superheroes for what would become known as the Silver Age of comic books, Gill and the soon-to-be-legendary co-creator of Marvel Comics' Spider-Man, Steve Ditko, created the astronaut-turned-atomic- hero Captain Atom in the sci-fi anthology title Space Adventures #33 (March 1960). The character would eventually become a stalwart of the DC stable, as would Blue Beetle, an old Fox Comics superhero revived by Gill and artists Bill Fraccio and Tony Tallarico as a campy, comedic character in Blue Beetle #1 (June 1964). In 1967, Charlton editor Dick Giordano introduced the company's \\"Action Hero\\" superhero line, with new characters that included Gill and artist Pat Boyette's The Peacemaker as well as Gill and company art director Frank McLaughlin's Judomaster. In other areas, he collaborated with Ditko on the giant-ape series Konga and on the movie-spinoff series Gorgo. =Later life and career= Gill in his later years, holding a copy of Mike Danger When Giordano was hired at industry leader DC Comics in 1969, he commissioned scripts from Gill for such titles as The Secret Six and the toy- license property Hot Wheels. Gill continued to work regularly at Charlton throughout this period, notably on the ongoing Vietnam War feature \\"Shotgun Harker and Chicken\\" for Charlton's war title Fightin' Marines. In 1975, Gill and artist John Byrne co-created the post-apocalyptic series Doomsday + 1 (1976–1977), the first series-creator credit for future industry-star Byrne. In 1983, Gill wrote two stories featuring Secret Agent X-9 for King Features Syndicate. These stories were illustrated by Jack Sparling and only saw print in European comic books. When Charlton Comics ceased publication in 1986, Gill retired from comic-book scripting save for an occasional freelance story for DC. His final recorded credit is as one of the colorists on the small-press superhero comic Ebony Warrior #2 (June–July 1993), published by Ania. He appeared as a guest, with fellow Charlton alumni Willie Franz and Sam Glanzman, at a New York City comics convention panel, broadcast November 21, 2000, on the WBAI radio show 'Nuff Said!'Nuff Said! Guest List. WebCitation archive. Gill, who suffered from complications from a fall at the Shady Knoll Health Center in Seymour, Connecticut, and who in the last part of his life spent much time at the Doyle Senior Center, playing pool in the morning and poker in the afternoon, died of undisclosed causes at age 87 in Seymour. There was no funeral, according to his wishes, and his only surviving relative, niece Carol Anderson, took his ashes to a cemetery in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where his wife and son are buried.

It is also the name of the coastal settlement at the foot of the ancient city walls, also known as Porto Germeno. The ancient citadel which stands at the foot of Mt Cithaeron and extends down to the sea at the inlet of Aigosthena, on the east side of the Gulf of Corinth, is famous for retaining several of the tallest surviving towers of ancient Greece. Geography Aigosthena is situated on the Alkyonides Gulf, a bay of the Gulf of Corinth. It is surrounded by forested mountains: the Cithaeron to the north and the Pateras to the south. Aigosthena was historically the northernmost city of the Megaris (Megarida). It is 10 km west of Vilia, 20 km southwest of Thebes northwest of Athens.  Ancient Aigosthena  Plan of Ancient Aigosthena. The ancient site of Aigosthena consisted of a fortified citadel connected to the sea by two fortification walls; the fortress consisting of the acropolis citadel and the lower town. The acropolis stands on a low hill, 450m from the sea. Measuring roughly 90 by 187 m (~575 Doric feet), the citadel was roughly trapezoidal in plan, with the narrower side (113m) facing west toward the sea. The citadel was constructed along the contours of a 55 m hill, and was defended by eight artillery towers incorporated into its perimeter wall. There was a primary gate on the west side into the area between the north and south walls to the sea. A small postern (auxiliary) gate was located immediately north of the second tower on the eastern side. The northern of the two walls to the sea is well preserved, stretching 370 m to a final tower of which the foundations and fallen blocks are now underwater. The northern wall consisted of six towers and a fortified gate running in a nearly straight line from the northwest corner of the citadel to the sea. The bed of a river runs along the probably line of the south wall, which is not evident. The walls were built in a variety of masonry styles, which may be evidence of different phases of construction. Masonry styles in use include isodomic (ashlars with hammered faces and drafted corners), pseudo-isodomic, and - in sections – a style approaching polygonal. In general terms, these walls are among the best preserved of any of the Hellenistic period and show a high level of skill and finish. There is clear evidence of quarrying immediately south of the southeast tower of the citadel. Based on the design of the defense towers, Ober proposes that the site was fortified after 370 BCE. Lawrence opts for a date in the late 4th century BCE, on the assumption that Demetrios Poliorcetes built the fortress rather than simply occupying it. The site was under the control of the Achaean League in 243-224 BCE, and in 224 - 146 BCE it joined the Boeotian League. Shrines of Melampos and Heracles are known to have existed by inscriptions recovered on the site. The town and its warehouses operated down into Roman times. An inscription of c. 420 CE listed Aigosthena as a free city. A five-aisled Christian basilica was erected in the lower fortified area in the medieval period, and there was a monastery complex within the citadel.  Modern Aigosthena  The modern village Aigosthena, also known as Porto Germeno, is part of the municipal unit of Vilia. Its permanent population was 80 at the 2011 census.Detailed census results 2011 It is a popular beach resort with a small port.

The Wind was originally a concept car unveiled in September 2004 at the Paris Motor Show as a 2+1 roadster. On February 2, 2010, Renault announced that the Wind would enter production. It was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show on March 2, 2010. The production version was a two-seater, as opposed to the 2+1 seating of the concept car. In February 2012, Renault retired the Wind, Espace, Kangoo, Modus, and Laguna lines in the United Kingdom. For Mainland Europe, the Wind remained available until June 2013. The Gordini edition, No. 6 was the only Wind that featured aerials. Engine The Wind is equipped with an I4 petrol engine: either the 1.2 litre TCE, or a 1.6 litre. Design The concept Wind's design is like other Renault vehicles such as the performance versions of the Clio and Mégane. The production Wind, however, is heavily based on the Twingo, evident in its overall size and stance, and also its semi-circular door handles exactly the same as those on the Twingo. The steering wheel and pedal assemblies in the concept are adjustable and fold away automatically when the door is opened for easier access. The producer was Erdenechulun. The Wind features a one piece metal roof which rotates 180° backwards (much like the Ferrari 575M Superamerica), instead of being made of several pieces like many other metal roof convertibles. Renault claims that it takes twelve seconds to fold the roof away, which is comparable to most other convertibles. Trim lines There were three model trim lines: Dynamique, Dynamique S, and the limited edition \\"Collection\\". The Dynamique trim line was the most basic, with 16\\" alloy wheels and air conditioning as standard features. The Dynamique S trim was above this, with 17\\" alloy wheels and climate control. The Limited Edition \\"Collection\\" trim had the biggest range of features, including a gloss black retractable roof and red and chrome dashboard inserts.

The park is about from the city of Pittsburgh, near Hookstown. Raccoon Creek State Park is easily accessed from Pennsylvania Route 18 and U.S Routes 30 and 22. The park offers numerous activities such as hiking, biking, cross-country skiing, camping, swimming, fishing, and boating, the last three at the \\"Raccoon Lake.\\" Raccoon Creek State Park was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and its Bureau of Parks as one of \\"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\\". History =Health resort= Raccoon Creek State Park is located on the site of a former Victorian era health resort. Frankfort Minerals Springs was the site of a natural mineral spring. It was founded by Edward McGinnis in the mid-19th century. He believed that the mineral spring waters held curative powers. McGinnis built his resort atop a hill in what is now Raccoon Creek State Park. Visitors to the resort walked down steps to the springs. The resort was very prosperous. At one time it featured a hotel, dance hall, livery stable and numerous guest cottages. Frankfort Mineral Springs closed during the first part of the 20th century. =Recreational Demonstration Area= Along with two other Pennsylvania state parks, Raccoon Creek State Park was established as a Recreational Demonstration Area during the Great Depression. Its earliest buildings, constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935, are split among four areas: three group camps and a headquarters/maintenance complex.Milner, John, Associates. [ National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Raccoon Creek RDA]. National Park Service, October 1986. Accessed 2009-12-17. Built in the National Park Service Rustic style, these buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 as a historic district; a total of 114 buildings and structures qualified as contributing properties. The district was added to the Register for several significant reasons: besides their distinctive architecture and their role as parts of a recreational area, the buildings reflect the federal government's attempts to resolve the poverty of the Depression through political means. =Park= Raccoon Creek State Park has continued to develop from its beginning in the 1930s to one of the largest state parks in Pennsylvania. Facilities at the park are a mix from the early camp to modern facilities. In addition to recreational areas, there are large tracts of undeveloped land. Scenes for the film The Road were filmed at the park in the spring of 2008. =Wildflower Reserve= The 314-acre Wildflower Reserve, located at the eastern section of Raccoon Creek State Park, contains one of the most diverse stands of wildflowers in western Pennsylvania. Over 700 species of plants have been identified in the Reserve . Trails lead through a variety of habitats like oak-hickory forest, pine plantations, woodland meadows, and flood plain forest along Raccoon Creek. Wildflowers can be observed throughout the growing season with peak wildflower blooms occurring in late April and August. Because of its uniqueness and to preserve the many wildflower species, the Reserve is closed to all activities other than hiking on designated trails. Wildflower Reserve. Environment Raccoon Creek State Park lies within the Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests ecoregion. Recreation Raccoon Lake There are about 500 picnic tables spread among 5 picnic areas at Raccoon Creek State Park. Five pavilions are available to rent or if unrented are available on a first come, first served basis. Raccoon Lake is open for year-round fishing. The common game fish are bullhead catfish, bluegill, yellow perch, crappie, walleye, muskellunge, and both large and smallmouth bass. Raccoon Lake's feeder streams are stocked with brook and rainbow trout by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. These fish can also be found in the lake. Hunting is permitted on over of Raccoon Creek State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are ruffed grouse, squirrels, turkey, pheasants, white-tailed deer, and rabbits. The hunting of groundhogs is forbidden.

Origin and career  Silvanus was born in Gaul, the son of Bonitus, a Laetic Frankish general who had supported Constantine I in the civil war against Licinius. Like so many other Franks of his times, and like his father before him, he was a loyal and thoroughly romanized \\"barbarian\\" in the military service of the Empire. By AD 351, he held the rank of tribune and was one of the senior officers who defected to Emperor Constantius II at the Battle of Mursa Major, after initially supporting the usurper Magnentius. An able soldier, Silvanus was eventually promoted to the rank of Magister militum per Gallias, a crucial post, then in AD 352-353, Constantius personally entrusted him with the difficult task of driving the Alamanni tribesmen raiding and looting in Gaul back beyond the Rhine, and restoring the fast eroding Roman authority in the province. This Silvanus fulfilled partly by bribing the Alamanni chieftains with the taxes he had collected, partly by defeating the Alamanni in battle and partly by suppressing the local bagaudae insurrections flaring up again in central and northern Gaul.  Trial and usurpation  The corrupt coterie of Constantius II managed to persuade the suspicious, paranoid emperor, that Silvanus was planning to seize power. According to Ammianus, the praetorian prefect Lampadius and the ex-treasurer of the privy purse, Eusebius, used a sponge to alter a letter sent by Silvanus to his friends in Rome.Ammianus Marcellinus, History, 15.2.3. The altered letter suggested that Silvanus was attempting to win support within the Senate for a coup. Constantius' court clique, with the exception of fellow Frankish generals Malarich and Mallobaudes, was uniformly against Silvanus. Courtiers Apodemius and Dynamius forged further correspondence that cast doubt on Silvanus' loyalty. Constantius then held a trial where Silvanus' allies were successful in defeating the spurious charges against the general. But Silvanus, unaware of the success of his supporters, responded to the threat of condemnation and execution by actually proclaiming himself emperor on 11 August 355 in Colonia Agrippina (modern Cologne).The argument that the usurpation was the product of a breakdown in communications between Constantius and his general in the field has been well argued by Nutt. Late Roman historian Michael Kulikowski has argued that the entire episode was a later invention, created as an excuse to rid Constantius II of Silvanus before he became a threat. His primary basis of this argument is the fact that no coins minted with Silvanus' image have been found to date, since virtually every usurper minted coins as an attempt to legitimize his authority.  Death of Silvanus  Constantius II, who was staying in Milan, ordered Silvanus to present himself at court, then sent Ursicinus to take over Silvanus' post. Ursicinus was himself at odds with Constantius' clique, and Silvanus no doubt trusted the veteran general. The letter that Ursicinus gave to Silvanus did not indicate that Constantius already knew of Silvanus' bid for power, so Silvanus considered himself safe. However it seems that Ursicinus betrayed and then arranged for the murder of Silvanus by co-opting some of the rebel soldiery. These men killed the usurper's guards and cornered Silvanus, who was on his way to church, then hacked him to death with their weapons.  Ammianus's report of Silvanus's death  It has been suggested by at least one scholar that Ammianus invented the entire coup attempt to gloss over the role played by his patron, Ursicinus, in the murder of a fellow general.See David Hunt's handling of Drinkwater's argument in \\"The Outsider Inside: Ammianus on the Rebellion of Silvanus\\" in Jan Willem Drijvers and David Hunt, eds., The Late Roman World and its Historian: Interpreting Ammianus Marcellinus (London, 1999). This theory suggests that Constantius had grown suspicious of the popular Frankish general and so offered his post to Ursicinus, who then murdered his peer in the course of a botched change of command. It has been noted that Silvanus did not mint any coinage (which would have been a clear indication of a usurpation attempt), unlike other equally-short lived usurpers of the era, such as Poemenius.Barnes. However, the thesis of a concocted coup attempt is generally rejected by scholars.Syme; Matthews. The lack of numismatic evidence is not determinative, because Trier, the nearest minting centre to Colonia Agrippina, closed its gates to Silvanus. Ammianus thus concludes his treatment of the Silvanus episode: \\"Such was the end of a commander of no small merit, who was driven by fear of the slanders in which a hostile clique had ensnared him in his absence to adopt extreme measures in self-defence\\" (15.5.32).

She achieved a solo number one single in 2009 when she collaborated with Tinchy Stryder on their single \\"Never Leave You\\", which made her the first and, to date, the only member of the Sugababes to achieve a number-one single outside of the group. Early life Berrabah was born in Aldershot, Hampshire to Moroccan parents. She has four sisters, younger sister Samiya, older sisters Laila, Zakiya and Nora and a brother, Khaled. Her family owned a kebab shop in Aldershot. Berrabah's father died of cancer in 2002. Berrabah attended The Connaught School in Aldershot and the Academy of Contemporary Music in Guildford, the latter on the merit of a scholarship. It was then that she met her managers and formed the group Boo2, with her sister, Samiya and began looking for record contract opportunities. She won Top of the Pops magazine’s Star Search in 2003 that gave her the chance to be the lead singer of a new group and had performed at Party in the Park as well. =2006–2008: Success with the Sugababes= Berrabah in 2006, performing on the Taller in More Ways Tour Following Mutya Buena's departure from Sugababes, Berrabah was brought in as a replacement by the group's management. Their manager had seen Boo2 perform at an American showcase a few years prior in 2003 and Berrabah had impressed him. As soon as Buena left, he gave Berrabah a call about the opportunity and got her to record three songs to audition for remaining members Keisha Buchanan and Heidi Range. They liked the demos and Berrabah was then announced as the newest member of the trio. The first single to feature Berrabah's vocals, \\"Red Dress\\", entered the UK Singles Chart at number four. Taller in More Ways was re-released in early 2006 with re- recorded vocals by Berrabah. Because of the hastiness of the replacement, she could only re-record vocals for three of the tracks on the album. She also contributed the song, \\"Now You're Gone\\" to the new track listing. They performed the 2007 Comic Relief single with fellow girl band, Girls Aloud, \\"Walk This Way\\", which went to number one. On 28 April 2007, Berrabah was arrested over allegations that she had assaulted a girl on the dancefloor in a club. No charges were brought. The first single from their album Change, the Dr. Luke-produced \\"About You Now\\", topped the UK Singles Chart for four weeks. In October 2007, Change became the group's second UK Albums Chart number one, giving the group the top position on the singles and albums charts simultaneously. Berrabah was credited with co-writing five songs on the album. Berrabah was arrested again on 10 January 2008 on suspicion of causing criminal damage and a public order offence. The arrest was made in connection with an alleged attack on a car in her hometown of Aldershot on 9 January 2008. The charges were quickly dropped when it was revealed that she was not even in town at the time. Despite announcing a break after the Change tour, the group quickly began working on Catfights and Spotlights, which was released in late 2008 and became their lowest charting album at the time. =2009–2011: Solo success and group turmoil= After the commercial disappointment of Catfights and Spotlights, the group began working on the album Sweet 7, signing with Roc Nation and working with their in-house producers in the US. Around this time, Berrabah also featured on \\"Never Leave You\\" by Tinchy Stryder in 2009, the single debuted at number one in the UK. The first single, \\"Get Sexy\\", from Sweet 7 was released soon after and reached number 2 on the UK charts. Prior to shooting the video for the second single, RedOne production \\"About a Girl\\", Berrabah was rumoured to have left the group. She had missed two engagements promoting the album. It was later revealed that in fact Buchanan had been removed due to disagreements with Berrabah and Range, and replaced by Jade Ewen. Berrabah and Range had earlier quit the Sugababes claiming that they could not work in the group any longer, their management then retained them and removed Buchanan instead. Following these events, Berrabah checked into a European health clinic for a three-week stay, citing \\"severe nervous exhaustion\\". Sweet 7 was released in early 2010 after multiple delays from late 2009. It charted at number 14 on the UK Albums Chart. The Sugababes began recording a new studio album soon after, leaving Island Records for a distribution deal with RCA Records in 2011. The planned first single, \\"Freedom\\" was released for free in August after it failed to gain any traction in airplay. A few months after the release, Range explained that the Sugababes were taking a break while they pursued individual endeavours. =2011–present: Solo career= Berrabah began working on solo material in 2011 with producer Pete Kirtley, who had previously produced her co-writing contribution, \\"Now You're Gone\\" from Taller in More Ways and material by Boo2. In January 2012, Berrabah confirmed she had been working on a solo album. A clip of the song \\"God Won't Save You Now\\" was posted to the SoundCloud account of Kirtley and fellow producer Sacha , who are collectively known as D-B-X. The full song leaked a few weeks later. On 6 March 2012, it was reported Berrabah had gone to Los Angeles to record new material for the album. Berrabah was featured on the song \\"Ordinary Me\\" by rapper Mr. Bigz on the latter's mixtape The Bigz Bang Theory in late 2012. In May 2013, Berrabah confirmed she had nearly completed work on her solo album, and was looking to release the collection some time in the summer. Berrabah had earlier stated that she had written every song on the album apart from two. Berrabah teamed up with British DJ Adam J for his single \\"Love (Is All We Need)\\", and featured production team The Nightcrashers. Berrabah released another single, \\"Summertime\\", on 21 September 2014. The video premièred on Vevo on 9 August. During this time, Berrabah also made a series of appearances on reality competitions, competing in the BBC celebrity gymnastics show Tumble in mid-2014 and Celebrity Masterchef in 2016. She made her theatre debut in 2019, with the jukebox musical Club Tropicana. Personal life Berrabah married Marcio Sousa Rosa on 17 October 2014. She gave birth to her first child on 10 June 2018, a daughter named Amirah.

Beauregard Donald 'Beau' Felton is a fictional character on the television drama series Homicide: Life on the Street portrayed by Daniel Baldwin for seasons 1-3. He was loosely based on Det. Donald Kincaid, from David Simon's nonfiction book, Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, on which the series was based.Smith, Van. \\"Homicide, Revisited,\\" Baltimore City Paper, December 10, 2013. Beau Felton was born on October 22, 1960.Homicide: Life on the Street episode \\"Strangers and Other Partners\\", originally aired May 16, 1997. He is a hardheaded tough guy from Billytown, in the southwest area of Baltimore. His main squad partner in the series is Det. Kay Howard. The two of them are friends, and their discussions that there is no sexual tension between them are later affirmed when he stays at her place as a purely platonic roommate, after his marriage breaks down. Felton is married to Beth Felton, though by the beginning of the series their marriage is on the rocks. They have three young children—a boy, Zack; a girl, Alley; and an unnamed baby—to whom Beau is very close. Beth, who is emotionally unstable, eventually empties out their house in the third season, disappears with the children, and does as much as she can to prevent him from seeing his children. When Lt. Megan Russert is introduced in the first episode of the third season, Felton is already having an affair with her, although she breaks it off very soon after. When Beth leaves, Felton begins to drink heavily and his police work suffers as a result; Howard becomes disgusted with him following a binge in which he loses crucial evidence for a seemingly unsolvable case, assigned to her from the late Steve Crosetti's caseload. In spite of an office dress code, Felton never wears a tie unless required to for a special occasion like testifying in court; Homicide executive director Barry Levinson said this was a \\"big character point\\" for Felton. During a raid in the third season episode \\"The City That Bleeds\\", Felton is shot, along with Det. Howard and Det. Bolander. Beau is wounded in the neck and leg, but the bullets miss all major organs and arteries; Howard and Bolander, meanwhile, are far more seriously injured. Felton is the first to recover, though he carried a lot of the guilt over Howard being hit. He is the first to go back on duty, but his recovery, coupled with Beth leaving him for good, worsens his drinking problem. After Felton loses his temper over a minor incident, and blames it on his recovery, Lt. Al Giardello bluntly tells him he had never been good enough for Homicide, even before he was shot, citing Felton's drinking and personal problems. Due to unsuccessful contract negotiations with actors Daniel Baldwin and Ned Beatty, Felton and Bolander were written out of the series after Season 3. The narrative reason for the characters' absence is given in the Season 4 premiere, in which Giardello reveals that Felton and Bolander got drunk and engaged in embarrassing and grossly inappropriate behavior while attending a police/firefighter convention in New York City. Both are suspended for 22 weeks without pay, a reference to the then-standard length of a network drama's TV season. Bolander chooses to retire when his suspension is up, while Felton drops out of sight. During Season 5, Giardello often complains about Felton's unknown whereabouts, and rumors began to spread that he had resigned in disgrace following his suspension. In the two-part season finale of Season 5 (\\"Partners and Other Strangers\\" and \\"Strangers and Other Partners\\"), Felton is found dead in his house, a shotgun blast having destroyed most of his skull. The evidence first points to suicide, but M.E. Julianna Cox soon determines that he had been murdered with a pistol shot to the back of the head; the killer then used the shotgun to stage the suicide. He was murdered on May 9, 1997.shown on screen when then-Maryland Governor Parris Glendening and then-Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke unveil a memorial tablet and an acrylic plaque is displayed. Giardello soon learns that Felton had actually returned from his long suspension to an offer to work undercover for Internal Investigations Division (IID), under the direction of Detective Stuart Gharty. Felton had been undercover for six months helping IID and the FBI build a case against a massive auto theft ring, but an information leak led to his cover being blown. He was personally murdered by the auto kingpin, who managed to evade capture. Beth wants nothing to do with Beau's funeral, so Kay Howard and Megan Russert handle the arrangements. A memorial for Felton is established in the police headquarters, and attended (on screen) by then-Maryland Governor Parris Glendening and then-Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke. The investigation of Felton's murder leads the detectives to remember moments with Felton, although most of these memories prove unpleasant. The episode illustrates these memories with flashbacks consisting of brief clips from the first three seasons; these clips are Felton's only appearance on the series after Season 3. The last appearance of Felton was in the 2000 TV movie Homicide: The Movie, where he and (Season 3 deceased) Detective Crosetti are seen in the afterlife playing cards in the squad room and waiting for the next \\"arrival\\" – who turns out to be Al Giardello.

Branched polymers have more compact and symmetrical molecular conformations, and exhibit intra-heterogeneous dynamical behavior with respect to the unbranched polymers. In crosslinking rubber by vulcanization, short sulfur branches link polyisoprene chains (or a synthetic variant) into a multiply branched thermosetting elastomer. Rubber can also be so completely vulcanized that it becomes a rigid solid, so hard it can be used as the bit in a smoking pipe. Polycarbonate chains can be crosslinked to form the hardest, most impact-resistant thermosetting plastic, used in safety glasses. Branching may result from the formation of carbon-carbon or various other types of covalent bonds. Branching by ester and amide bonds is typically by a condensation reaction, producing one molecule of water (or HCl) for each bond formed. Polymers which are branched but not crosslinked are generally thermoplastic. Branching sometimes occurs spontaneously during synthesis of polymers; e.g., by free-radical polymerization of ethylene to form polyethylene. In fact, preventing branching to produce linear polyethylene requires special methods. Because of the way polyamides are formed, nylon would seem to be limited to unbranched, straight chains. But \\"star\\" branched nylon can be produced by the condensation of dicarboxylic acids with polyamines having three or more amino groups. Branching also occurs naturally during enzymatically-catalyzed polymerization of glucose to form polysaccharides such as glycogen (animals), and amylopectin, a form of starch (plants). The unbranched form of starch is called amylose. The ultimate in branching is a completely crosslinked network such as found in Bakelite, a phenol-formaldehyde thermoset resin. Special types of branched polymer Dendrimer synthesis first generation Newkome 1985 :* A graft polymer molecule is a branched polymer molecule in which one or more of the side chains are different, structurally or configurationally, from the main chain. :* A star- shaped polymer molecule is a branched polymer molecule in which a single branch point gives rise to multiple linear chains or arms. If the arms are identical the star polymer molecule is said to be regular. If adjacent arms are composed of different repeating subunits, the star polymer molecule is said to be variegated. :* A comb polymer molecule consists of a main chain with two or more three-way branch points and linear side chains. If the arms are identical the comb polymer molecule is said to be regular. :* A brush polymer molecule consists of a main chain with linear, unbranched side chains and where one or more of the branch points has four-way functionality or larger. :* A polymer network is a network in which all polymer chains are interconnected to form a single macroscopic entity by many crosslinks. See for example thermosets or interpenetrating polymer networks. :* A dendrimer is a repetitively branched compound. In radical polymerization Polymerization of 1,3-butadiene In free radical polymerization, branching occurs when a chain curls back and bonds to an earlier part of the chain. When this curl breaks, it leaves small chains sprouting from the main carbon backbone. Branched carbon chains cannot line up as close to each other as unbranched chains can. This causes less contact between atoms of different chains, and fewer opportunities for induced or permanent dipoles to occur. A low density results from the chains being further apart. Lower melting points and tensile strengths are evident, because the intermolecular bonds are weaker and require less energy to break. The problem of branching occurs during propagation, when a chain curls back on itself and breaks - leaving irregular chains sprouting from the main carbon backbone. Branching makes the polymers less dense and results in low tensile strength and melting points. Developed by Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta in the 1950s, Ziegler–Natta catalysts (triethylaluminium in the presence of a metal(IV) chloride) largely solved this problem. Instead of a free radical reaction, the initial ethene monomer inserts between the aluminium atom and one of the ethyl groups in the catalyst. The polymer is then able to grow out from the aluminium atom and results in almost totally unbranched chains. With the new catalysts, the tacticity of the polypropene chain, the alignment of alkyl groups, was also able to be controlled. Different metal chlorides allowed the selective production of each form i.e., syndiotactic, isotactic and atactic polymer chains could be selectively created. However, there were further complications to be solved. If the Ziegler–Natta catalyst was poisoned or damaged then the chain stopped growing. Also, Ziegler–Natta monomers have to be small, and it was still impossible to control the molecular mass of the polymer chains. Again new catalysts, the metallocenes, were developed to tackle these problems. Due to their structure they have less premature chain termination and branching. Branching index The branching index measures the effect of long-chain branches on the size of a macromolecule in solution. It is defined as g = b2>/l2>, where sb is the mean square radius of gyration of the branched macromolecule in a given solvent, and sl is the mean square radius of gyration of an otherwise identical linear macromolecule in the same solvent at the same temperature. A value greater than 1 indicates an increased radius of gyration due to branching.

The invasion is documented by Gregory of Tours who cited the now-lost work of Sulpicius Alexander. According to this account, Marcomer, Sunno and Genobaud invaded the Roman provinces Germania Inferior and Belgia. They broke through the limes and killed many people, destroyed the most fruitful lands and made the city of Köln panic. After this raid the main body of the Franks moved back over the river Rhine with their booty while some remained in the Belgian woods. When the Roman generals Magnus Maximus, Nanninus and Quintinus heard the news in Trier, they attacked those remaining Frankish forces and killed many of their number. After this engagement, Quintinus crossed the Rhine to punish the Franks in their own country, however his army was surrounded and beaten. Some Roman soldiers drowned in the marshes, others were killed by Franks, few made it back to their empire. Nanninus and Quintinus were replaced by Charietto and Syrus, who were again confronted by an attack of unidentified Franks. Later after the fall of Magnus Maximus, Marcomer and Sunno held a short meeting about the recent attacks with the Frank Arbogastes, who was a general (magister militum) in the Roman army. The Franks delivered hostages as usual and Arbogastes returned to his winter quarters in Trier. A couple of years later when Arbogastes had seized power and the West Roman army was nearly completely in the hands of Frankish mercenaries, he crossed the Rhine with a Roman army into Germania because he hated his own kin. Marcomer was seen with Chatti and Ampsivarii but the two did not engage. Later we hear from the poet Claudian that Marcomer was arrested by Romans and banned to a villa in Tuscany. His brother Sunno crossed the Rhine and tried to set himself up as leader of Marcomer's band, but he was killed by his own people. According to the later Liber Historiae Francorum, Marcomer tried to unite the Franks after the death of Sunno. He proposed that the Franks should live under one king and proposed his own son Pharamond for the kingship. This source does not tell us if Marcomer succeeded but from other sources it may seem that Pharamond was regarded as the first king of the Francs. However, this account of the Liber Historiae Francorum is not accepted as historical by modern scholars such as Edward James because Marcomer is therein called the son of the Trojan king Priam, and Sunno the son of Antenor, obviously impossible because Priam and Antenor lived hundreds of years earlier.

In 1891, the original funicular line was opened, running between its namesake stations. After surviving the closure of the nearby funiculaire Rue Terme - Croix-Rousse in 1967, this line closed in 1972 for refurbishment and conversion to rack railway technology, reopening for service in 1974 (four years before lines A and B opened). When it was integrated with the metro as Lyon Metro Line C in 1978, the line's southern end was extended from Croix-Paquet to Hôtel-de-Ville (City Hall), also equipped with rack rail. A further extension of Line C opened on December 8, 1984, when its northern end was extended from Croix- Rousse to Cuire as an adhesion railway (no rack). The line now serves five stations, and is long. It was constructed using various methods: the original route used by the former funicular line runs up a steep incline rising from a deep tunnel to an exposed trench, the newly built level segment at Croix- Rousse using cut-and-cover, and the latest section beyond Hénon running on the surface. Croix Paquet station claims to be the steepest metro station in the world, with an incline of 17%.

History U.S. Digital Television was formed in June 2003 and launched its service as a test in Salt Lake City near the end of 2003. On March 16, 2004, 1000 subscribers signed up with no advertising. US Digital also launched into the Albuquerque, New Mexico, market. At that time, the company expected to enter the Las Vegas market next and an additional 30 markets by the end of the year. * In the fourth quarter 2004, fifth-generation chips and ATSC tuners would be supplied by LG for USDTV tuners and would be available. In September 2005, Hearst-Argyle Television, McGraw-Hill Companies, News Corp.'s Fox Television Stations, LIN TV, and Morgan-Murphy Stations broadcasters invested $26 million in the company. Alt URL Steven Lindsley indicated that the investing broadcasting companies did not think that the service would be able to compete against the cable companies, thus withdrawing support from USDTV. On July 6, 2006, in Delaware Bankruptcy Court, the company filed for Chapter 7. While USDTV filed for liquidation bankruptcy, the company continued to operate in its four markets while two other companies were interested in purchasing its assets to continue the service. Investors at bankruptcy were USDTV (28.28%), and those with 12.35% each: Hearst-Argyle (split between HATV Investments Inc. and Hearst Broadcasting), LIN Television Corp., McGraw-Hill Ventures Inc., News-USDTV Holdings Inc. and Telcom DTV LLC. The company was placed under the control of a trustee, Alfred Thomas Giuliano. In September 2006, NexGen Telecom, an original investor, purchased the assets of the company for a reported $1 million cash. NexGen had a major loss in another investment in fourth quarter 2006 forcing them to curtail their ongoing investment in USDTV. When no new bridge funding could be found, US Digital ended services in March 2007. Services USDTV served customers in and near Salt Lake City, Utah, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Las Vegas, Nevada, and Dallas, Texas. The company used extra bandwidth on digital television stations to send channels to subscribers who had a special set-top box digital tuner provided by the company and an attic- or roof-mounted antenna which were available nationwide via Wal-Mart and in the West by RC Willey furniture and electronics stores. The USDIGITAL brand boxes sold where the service was not available operated like an ordinary digital television tuner. Two technology companies, eWest and ServicePower, partnered to help clients install the equipment while self-installers would get two months free. The cost for the basic-tier service was $19.95 per month. USDTV also offered Starz! for an additional monthly fee. The basic tier started out with 11 cable channels: ESPN, ESPN2, Disney Channel, Toon Disney, Discovery Channel, The Learning Channel, Lifetime, Lifetime Movie Network, Home & Gardening Television, Fox News, and the Food Network. By July 2003, the service had 30 channels.

In particular, he is famous for his two fu, On the Owl () and his Lament for Qu Yuan (). He is also the author of the treatise Xinshu (), containing political and educational insights.Svarverud, Rune. Methods of the Way: Early Chinese Ethical Thought. Leiden: Brill, 1998. Life Jia Yi was born about 200 BCE in Luoyang, though some sources suggest his birth may have been a year earlier in about 201 BCE.Loewe (1986), 148. As a youth Jia became well known in his home county for his literary skills and ability to recite the Chinese Classics. His precociousness caught the attention of \\"Venerable Wu\\" (Wu gong ), the local governor and a prominent Legalist scholar who had been a student of the Qin dynasty official Li Si. Wu brought Jia onto his staff, and when he became Commandant of Justice in 179 BCE he recommended Jia to Emperor Wen of Han as a scholar of the Classics. Emperor Wen made Jia a \\"professor\\" (bóshì ), and within one year had promoted him to Grand Master of the Palace (tàizhōng dàfū ), a relatively high-ranking position at the imperial court. Upon assuming his new position, Jia began submitting proposals for institutional reformsincluding a proposal to require vassal lords to actually reside in their fiefs and not at the capital. He advised Wen to teach his heir to use Shen Buhai's administrative method, so as to be able to \\"supervise the functions of the many officials and understand the usages of government.\\" He was frequently opposed by a group of older officials who had been early supporters of Liu Bang, the founder of the Han dynasty, and who continued to hold important positions under Emperor Wen.Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 87, 103, 106-107, 115 This old-guard faction, probably feeling that Jia was a threat to their own positions, protested when Emperor Wen was considering promoting Jia to a ministerial post, saying that Jia was \\"young and just beginning his studies, yet he concentrates all his desires on arrogating authority to himself, and has brought chaos and confusion to everything.\\" The emperor, bowing to the faction's pressure, gradually stopped seeking Jia's advice, and in 176 BCE exiled Jia to the southern kingdom of Changsha (roughly corresponding to modern Hunan Province) to serve as Grand Tutor to its young king Wu Chan (; r. 178157 BCE).Di Cosmo (2002), 201-202. Emperor Wen ended Jia's exile around 172 BCE by summoning him back to the imperial capital at Chang'an, ostensibly in order to consult him on matters of Daoist mysticism. The emperor appointed him to the position of Grand Tutor (tàifù ) to Liu Yi, Emperor Wen's youngest and favorite son, who was said to have been a good student and to have enjoyed reading. Liu Yi died in 169 BCE due to injuries he suffered in a fall from a horse. Jia blamed himself for the accident and died, grief-stricken, about one year later.  Works  Jia known for his famous essay \\"Disquisition Finding Fault with Qin\\" (Guò Qín Lùn 過秦論), in which Jia recounts his opinions on the cause of the Qin dynasty's collapse, and for two of his surviving fu rhapsodies: \\"On the Owl\\" and \\"Lament for Qu Yuan\\". Since he wrote favorably of social and ethical ideas attributed to Confucius and wrote an essay focused on the failings of the Legalist-based Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC), he was classified by other scholars in the Han Dynasty as a Confucian scholar (rujia). Jia Yi was known for his interest in ghosts, spirits, and other aspects of the afterlife; and, he wrote his Lament to Qu Yuan as a sacrificial offering to Qu Yuan, who had a century-or-so earlier drowned himself after being politically exiled. Jia Yi's actions inspired future exiled poets to a minor literary genre of similarly writing and then tossing their newly composed verses into the Xiang River, or other waters, as they traversed them on the way to their decreed places of exile.

Cox was introduced in the season five episode \\"M.E., Myself, and I,\\" returning to her hometown to take a position as the chief medical examiner (M.E.), after two years at the morgue in Buffalo. Her father is in frail health and barely hanging on. He passes away within days of her arriving, devastating her; while its first implied that he has died of natural causes, she later reveals that he died from injuries sustained in a car crash caused by a drunk driver. She compensates for her sadness, stating that \\"sometimes I drive too fast... sometimes I drink too much... sometimes I fall madly in love with the wrong man\\". As the chief M.E., Cox distinguished herself by being much more friendly and personable with the homicide unit than her predecessor. The detectives were all impressed that she would actually make trips to see them once in a while, both on and off duty, and she was very good at her job. She did not tolerate sloppy work or incompetence, and she fired two of her staff members - one who deliberately mis-classified a prostitute's murder as a drug overdose, and a second who stole jewelry from several homicide victims. She was also a regular at the Waterfront Bar. Cox was immediately attracted to Det. Mike Kellerman during a time when he was under investigation for corruption and sidelined from active duty. Both in need of comfort, they had a one-night stand that turned into a very open, laid-back sort of pseudo-relationship which mostly consisted of them getting drunk and having sex. The relationship eventually went downhill fast, however, and they distanced themselves. Cox briefly had a relationship with Det. Tim Bayliss, although she later admitted that it was mostly wanting someone over the holidays, and she angrily ended any relationship when he returned a pair of earrings to her in front of everyone at a crime scene. Towards the end of the 6th season, a truck driver working for the city ran a passenger car off the road, killing both the car driver and himself and leaving the car driver's wife a quadriplegic. Facing a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, the city pressured Cox to alter the evidence and report that the car driver was legally intoxicated; her tests had shown that the man had alcohol in his system but was not over the legal limit. Cox refused to lie and was fired, hearing later that the city had to pay the wife a $45 million settlement. She said goodbye to Kellerman and lamented that they had never put together a real relationship, implying she would have stayed around if they had. After losing her job, she left Baltimore. She returned in Homicide: The Movie to help the detectives catch a man who tried to assassinate Al Giardello, who had been their shift commander during the series.

Essingeleden has three bridges – Fredhällsbron (270 m), Essingebron (470 m), and Gröndalsbron (460 m) – and one tunnel, Fredhällstunneln (210 m), which is one of the busiest tunnels in Europe. The road is part of European route E4 and E20, and is the busiest road in Sweden, with about 150,000 vehicles per day. In August 2007 this has increased to 170,000 cars per day, because Essingeleden was then the only road through central Stockholm exempt from the Stockholm congestion tax, and because of repairs of the main road through the inner city. This has caused big traffic jams on Essingeleden and Södra länken. Since 1 January 2016, Essingeleden has been subject to the congestion tax. Aerial view of Essingeleden looking south 2014.  History  Opening of Essingeleden 1966 Essingeleden southbound The road was inaugurated on 21 August 1966 with two temporary lanes in each direction on the western half of the road, as Sweden was about to switch over to right-hand sided traffic the next year. The road was fully operational in September 1967 after Sweden had switched over to right-hand side traffic, and Essingeleden became the first six-lane motorway in Sweden. During the 1990s, the road was repainted from six lanes to eight lanes to increase the capacity.  Plans  Essingeleden has on several occasions been included in plans to create a ring road around Stockholm, but the ring road is only very slowly being built. Not much happened 1966–2000, but then the Southern Link (opened 2004) and the Northern Link (opened 2015) were built. A new parallel motorway is under construction further west, \\"Förbifart Stockholm\\". It will have several tunnels and will be very expensive, around 25 billion SEK. The Stockholm congestion tax (gross tax amount 800 MSEK/year) is supposed to be used for this and other road and public transit projects in Stockholm. The construction started in 2014 after several years of debating and planning.

Life Robsjohn-Gibbings studied architecture at London University. He afterwards worked briefly as a naval architect, designing ocean liner interiors, and then as art director for a motion picture studio. In 1926, he became a salesman for an antiques dealer who specialized in Elizabethan and Jacobean furniture, and Robsjohn-Gibbings was assigned prominent accounts such as Elizabeth Arden and Neiman Marcus. In the late 1930s and 1940s he was the most important decorator in America. After opening a shop on New York's Madison Avenue in 1936, Robsjohn-Gibbings proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such scions as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf, and Thelma Chrysler Foy. The design work of T. H. Robsjohn Gibbings is hallmarked as a modern mixture of the classical elements of Ancient Grecian design, and Art Deco design. It features mosaic floor reproductions, sculptural fragments, and sparse furnishings, all combining to achieve his trademark brand of modern historicism. He disliked the prevailing tastes of the day, describing them as \\"an indigestible mixture of Queen Anne, Georgian and Spanish styles.\\" He likewise considered Bauhaus-style modernism a fraud; he expressed his views in his writings such as Goodbye, Mr. Chippendale (1944), a spoof of modern interior design, Mona Lisa's Mustache: A dissection of Modern Art (1947), and Homes of the Brave (1953). One of the designer's most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber's mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for the house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions' paw feet, and Ionic columns in table bases, torchères, and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived and was sold intact to Conrad Hilton in 1952 and similarly sold on to its next owner, David Howard Murdock. He retained some of what was called the \\"opulent simplicity\\", but sold off the contents in the early 1980s. The architect might have appreciated the irony that, although the fine fittings and structure remained virtually untouched, these rooms made the perfect background for the new owner's fine collection of eighteenth century English furniture. It has since been sold again. T. H. Robsjohn-Gibbings much preferred the visual vocabulary of the classical world, particularly ancient Greek furniture and design. Robsjohn-Gibbings' look was widely emulated, and, from 1943–56, he worked as a designer for the Widdicomb Furniture Company in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 1960, he met Greek cabinetmakers Susan and Eleftherios Saridis, and, together, they created the Klismos line of furniture, which drew heavily on classical forms. It is still in production. Robsjohn-Gibbings eventually moved to Athens, where he became designer to Aristotle Onassis. His honors include the 1950 Waters Award and the 1962 Elsie de Wolfe Award. His furniture has been collectible for the past decade and particularly those pieces he had designed for the Casa Encantada, which are fetching high prices in auctions. His work has been studied by Daniella Ohad Smith, who has delivered a paper in the annual conference of the Interior Design Educator Council in 2008 and has published an article on his concepts in shaping the modern American home.

Route description The western terminus of SR 46 is at I-70 east of Terre Haute at an interchange before becoming a heavily traveled modernized 2-lane highway through Spencer where it intersects SR 67 and US 231. It then proceeds to Ellettsville where it becomes a 4-lane expressway until an Interchange with I 69. It then goes directly through the college town of Bloomington. It multiplexes with SR 45 on a road known as \\"The Bypass\\" just north of Indiana University where it passes by the athletic complex. It then goes by the College Mall in Bloomington where it makes a left turn and winds towards the artist colony of Nashville passing by SR 446 and Lake Monroe. After making a right turn at SR 135 in Nashville it proceeds to Columbus where it goes under I-65 at an interchange. It then heads to Greensburg where it multiplexes with SR 3 and again becomes a 4-lane expressway. At this point it makes a right turn and becomes a minor 2-lane highway as it closely follows I-74 until its eastern terminus at US 52 in northeastern Dearborn County.  History  Until 1936, SR 46's western terminus was at the Illinois–Indiana state line and when U.S. Route 150 (US 150) was commissioned on that route. The eastern terminus was at the Ohio–Indiana border when US 52 was commissioned along this route. Until recently \\"The Bypass\\" portion in Bloomington had congestion. However, a major construction project completed in Nov. 2012 widened the road to 4 lanes and alleviated the issue on this part of the roadway. SR 46 as a result of this project is now four lanes from Elletsville until the intersection with SR 446. Recently, Route 46 has been truncated from U.S. Route 40 to Interstate 70 because U.S Route 40 was moved to Interstate 70.

The fiddle itself is identical to the violin, however it is played differently in widely varying regional styles. In the era of sound recording some regional styles have been transmitted more widely while others have become more uncommon. Contemporary performers Modern performers include: Liz Carroll (All-Ireland Junior and Senior Fiddle Champion); John Carty; Brian Conway; Matt Cranitch; Desi Donnelly; Martin Fay; Frankie Gavin; Cathal Hayden; Kevin Burke; Martin Hayes; Eileen Ivers (9-time All-Ireland Fiddle Champion); Seán Keane (fiddler); Maurice Lennon; Andy McGann; Sean McGuire; Brendan Mulvihill; Gerry O'Connor; Caoimhín Ó Raghallaigh; Tommy Peoples; Bridget Regan; Marie Reilly; Paul Shaughnessy; Sean Smyth; John Sheahan. Sligo fiddlers like James Morrison and Michael Coleman did much to popularise Irish music in the United States in the 1920s. More recently Michael Gorman was also a huge influence. Donegal fiddler John Doherty came from a large family of fiddlers. He travelled all over Ireland, developing an encyclopedic knowledge of fiddle tunes. He was one of the last of the travelling fiddlers. He had a large body of knowledge of Scottish (especially marches and highlands) music as well. History The fiddle has ancient roots in Ireland, the first report of bowed instruments similar to the violin being in the Book of Leinster (ca. 1160). The modern violin was ubiquitous in Ireland by the early 1700s. Style Compared to classical violin, Irish fiddler tend to make little use of vibrato except for slow airs, and even then it is used relatively sparingly. Like the rest of Irish traditional music tradition, melodies are embellished through forms of ornamentation, such as rolls, trebles, and cuts. Irish fiddlers also use a vocabulary of bow slurs different from other fiddle traditions, at least in proportion of usage. Most notably, fiddlers often slur into the beat to produce a certain lilt, not unlike the Newcastle hornpipe style of bowing in England and Scotland, though the technique in Ireland is not restricted to hornpipes. They may also slur over beats in such a pattern as to create a natural back-beat in reels. Numerous Irish Reels are performed by The Dubliners, one of the pioneers of traditional Irish Music. Slow airs are occasionally played upon the fiddle, but the style is best known for fast, snappy reels and jigs. Strathspeys, popular in Scottish Fiddle are seldom played, as such, but there are some tunes which amply utilized dotted rhythm. Some tunes are: * The Wind That Shakes The Barley * The Humours Of Lissadell * The Maid Behind The Bar Regional styles Examples include the Sliabh Luachra and Donegal fiddle traditions. In Irish fiddling there are few known composers, as many tunes have been taught by ear and passed down from one generation to another. Also, many players adjusted tunes to suit their style and taste, so there can be many variations for a particular tune.

From 1971 until 1985 he was a top editor at Charlton Comics, where he also became the long-time regular artist on Popeye comic books. Biography =Early life and career= Wildman, a lifelong resident of Connecticut, served in the United States Navy in both World War II and the Korean War. During World War II he was a Navy recruiter, and after the end of World War II, he joined the Naval Reserves. Recalled to duty in Korea, he served on the . Returning home, Wildman studied advertising at what later became the Paier College of Art. In the 1950s, he was a commercial artist, first working for an ad agency and then as a freelance artist. During this time, he began producing art for Charlton Comics in Derby, Connecticut. =Popeye= When King Comics ceased publication of its Popeye title, Charlton acquired the rights. Longtime writer-artist Bud Sagendorf was busy with both the daily comic strip and Sunday newspaper comic strips and declined the job of continuing. Wildman was offered a contract to draw the Popeye comic, with the prolific Joe Gill scripting. The first Charlton issue of Popeye was published in 1969, the final one in 1977. Hired as an assistant editor to Sal Gentile, Wildman was promoted in 1971 to managing editor and eventually executive editor. Assistant editor Nicola Cuti wrote several of the later Popeye scripts for Charlton. Wildman's tenure as editor continued through 1985, while Western Publishing picked up Popeye under its Gold Key and Whitman trademarks. Bill Pearson, by then assistant editor at Charlton, began writing scripts, and Wildman produced illustrations while off-duty from Charlton. In 1979, the release of Robert Altman's Popeye film led to a demand for Popeye- related merchandise. For Random House, Wildman illustrated a \\"Pop-Up Book\\" that was later displayed at the Smithsonian Institution. Wildman was also invited to produce a painted wooden Easter egg for the White House Easter event; this egg was also donated to the Smithsonian. =Freelance= Western Publishing ceased its comics line in the early 1980s, and Wildman retired from Charlton Comics in 1985, moving into a freelance comic book and children's book illustration career. His pencils, inks and paints graced publications featuring Disney, Hanna-Barbera, Harvey and Warner Bros. characters along with countless designs for various businesses. In 1994, Wildman and his wife Trudy were guests of honor at a festival in Chester, Illinois, celebrating the 100th birthday of Popeye's creator, Elzie Crisler Segar. Wildman received the Popeye Fan Club's Lifetime Achievement Award. Wildman was also a guest of the 2004 festival, which celebrated the 75th anniversary of Popeye. As of the late 2000s, Wildman and his son Karl operated their own ad agency, producing computer animation, greeting cards and other products. Wildman's work was seen regularly in the \\"Hidden Pictures\\" of Highlights for Children. Awards The National Cartoonists Society awarded him \\"Best Cartoonist, Humor Division\\" in 1981. His contributions have been recognized with a nomination for the Shazam Award for Best Penciller (Humor Division) in 1974, and another nomination for the Shazam Award for Best Inker (Humor Division) that same year.*Comic Book Awards Almanac Death George Wildman died at the age of 88 on May 22, 2016.

He was best known for his long-running television series Weir's Way.  Early life and career  Weir was born in Springburn, Glasgow, and the younger brother of the actress Molly Weir. After service in the Royal Artillery during World War II, he worked as a surveyor for the Ordnance Survey, before commencing a full-time career as a climber, writer and photographer. In 1950 he was a member of the first post-war Himalayan expedition and, in 1952, was one of the first to explore the previously closed mountain ranges of Nepal, east of Kathmandu.  Media career and later life  A statue of Tom Weir was unveiled on the eastern shore of Loch Lomond in 2014. Another view of the statue Weir became a pioneering campaigner for the protection of the Scottish environment, and wrote a column for The Scots Magazine for over 50 years. From 1976–1987, he hosted the Scottish Television series Weir's Way, meeting the people of Scotland, exploring the landscape and its natural history. When STV repeated the series during the late night slot from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s it managed to achieve 30% audience share. The series is now available on DVD in the UK. Weir won the Scottish Television 'Personality of the Year Award' in 1976. He was appointed MBE in 1976. He lived in Gartocharn and in 2000 he was awarded the inaugural John Muir Lifetime Achievement Award by the John Muir Trust in recognition of his environmental work. He is also celebrated in the song \\"Tom Weir\\" written by Edinburgh musician Sandy Wright and performed by the band Aberfeldy. And in 2007, L. Pierre wrote an ambient instrumental song, \\"Weir's Way\\", featured on his album, \\"Dip\\". Weir was buried on 17 July 2006 in Kilmaronock Parish Church, near Drymen. He was buried in the same plot as the ashes of his sister Molly.  DVD release  A collection of some of Weir's best walks was released on DVD in 2006.

If a stock is recommended to be \\"overweight\\", the analyst opines that the stock is better value for money than others. 2) An investment portfolio judged to be overweight indicates that an investor holds proportionately more than the benchmark weight of a certain asset (a share, bond, industry/sector, country, currency, or asset class, etc.).https://www.stock-ratings.com/ratingscalc/ Examples Definition 1: If a particular stock is selling for $500 and the analyst feels that the stock is worth $600, the analyst would be declaring the stock to be overweight. Definition 2: Suppose that Technology stocks make up 10% of the relevant stock index by market value. For example, the weight of the Technology sector in the index could be 10%. Overweight — Suppose that an investor holds 15% of his/her investment in Technology stocks. The investor's stock portfolio is then 5% overweight in Technology stocks. Suppose further that the investor is advised by his broker or financial adviser that Technology should be \\"overweight\\". The investor is being advised to hold more investments in Technology, as a percentage, than the weight of that asset in the index/market. In this example, the recommendation is to hold more than 10% by value of Technology shares. Underweight — In contrast to overweight holding, if the broker advises that Technology should be \\"underweight\\", the recommendation to the investor is to hold less than 10% by value of Technology shares. Equal weight - The third possibility is that the broker advises that Technology should be \\"equal weight\\". In which case, the recommendation is to hold 10% by value of Technology shares.

He last managed Austria Klagenfurt. Between 1989 and 1999 he played for FC Bayern Munich, Karlsruher SC and 1860 Munich. In total Bender played 229 games in the Bundesliga, scoring 42 goals. Bender is most fondly remembered for a goal scored against Oliver Kahn and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga. Career In summer 1989, Bender was playing in the second level of the Bundesliga, for SpVgg Unterhaching, then FC Bayern Munich. He was an emerging talent of the same style as Jürgen Kohler, Alan McInally and Radmilo Mihajlovic. In spite of this competition he made 20 appearances in the season and scored two goals. Next season, Bender played 33 games, and scored five goals, as he was now a fully-fledged member of the squad. Season 1991–92 went badly for Bayern, as they went through three coaches (Jupp Heynckes, Søren Lerby and Erich Ribbeck). Bender moved to Karlsruhe in 1992 after a bad end- of-season result, in a direct swap with Mehmet Scholl. Bender moved to Karlsruhe in what became a very attack-minded team which immediately reached the UEFA Cup. In his strongest season to date, including a 7–0 victory over Valencia CF, Bender contributed significantly, helping them to reach the 1996 German Cup final. 1996 saw Bender transfer to TSV 1860 Munich. He played there for three seasons, but in his last, only saw six full matches. For one season he moved back to Karlsruhe, and then two more (2000–02) were spent playing for 1. FC Saarbrücken, a second-league team. Then he played some years in the lower leagues, and has, since 2006, embraced a new career, coaching in Austria. In February 2011, Bender was appointed fitness trainer for the Nigerian national team. References External links 1966 births Living people German footballers 1.

It is attributed to electronic effects and it is most notable in square planar complexes, although it can also be observed for octahedral complexes.Coe, B. J.; Glenwright, S. J. Trans-effects in octahedral transition metal complexes. Coordination Chemistry Reviews 2000, 203, 5-80. The cis effect is most often observed in octahedral transition metal complexes. In addition to this kinetic trans effect, trans ligands also have an influence on the ground state of the molecule, the most notable ones being bond lengths and stability. Some authors prefer the term trans influence to distinguish it from the kinetic effect, while others use more specific terms such as structural trans effect or thermodynamic trans effect. The discovery of the trans effect is attributed to Ilya Ilich Chernyaev,Kauffmann, G. B. I'lya I'lich Chernyaev (1893-1966) and the Trans Effect. J. Chem. Educ. 1977, 54, 86-89. who recognized it and gave it a name in 1926.Chernyaev, I. I. The mononitrites of bivalent platinum. I. Ann. inst. platine (USSR) 1926, 4, 243-275. Kinetic trans effect The intensity of the trans effect (as measured by the increase in rate of substitution of the trans ligand) follows this sequence: :F−, H2O, OH− < NH3 < py < Cl− < Br− < I−, SCN−, NO2−, SC(NH2)2, Ph− < SO32− < PR3, AsR3, SR2, CH3− < H−, NO, CO, CN−, C2H4 The classic example of the trans effect is the synthesis of cisplatin and its trans isomer. Starting from PtCl42−, the first NH3 ligand is added to any of the four equivalent positions at random. However, since Cl− has a greater trans effect than NH3, the second NH3 is added trans to a Cl− and therefore cis to the first NH3. :Synthesis of cisplatin using the trans effect If, on the other hand, one starts from Pt(NH3)42+, the trans product is obtained instead: :Synthesis of transplatin using the trans effect The trans effect in square complexes can be explained in terms of an addition/elimination mechanism that goes through a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate. Ligands with a high trans effect are in general those with high π acidity (as in the case of phosphines) or low-ligand lone-pair–dπ repulsions (as in the case of hydride), which prefer the more π-basic equatorial sites in the intermediate. The second equatorial position is occupied by the incoming ligand; due to the principle of microscopic reversibility, the departing ligand must also leave from an equatorial position. The third and final equatorial site is occupied by the trans ligand, so the net result is that the kinetically favored product is the one in which the ligand trans to the one with the largest trans effect is eliminated. Structural trans effect The structural trans effect can be measured experimentally using X-ray crystallography, and is observed as a stretching of the bonds between the metal and the ligand trans to a trans- influencing ligand. Stretching by as much as 0.2 Å occurs with strong trans- influencing ligands such as hydride. A cis influence can also be observed, but is smaller than the trans influence. The relative importance of the cis and trans influences depends on the formal electron configuration of the metal center, and explanations have been proposed based on the involvement of the atomic orbitals.Anderson, K. M.; Orpen, A. G. On the relative magnitudes of the cis and trans influences in metal complexes. Chem. Commun. 2001, 2682-2683. References Further reading * Quagliano, J. V.; Schubert, Leo.

The company produces oil and natural gas from onshore and offshore fields in the Azerbaijani segment of the Caspian Sea. It operates the country's only oil refinery, one gas processing plant and runs several oil and gas export pipelines throughout the country. It owns fuel filling station networks under the SOCAR brand in Azerbaijan,Turkey, Georgia, Ukraine, Romania and Switzerland. History The SOCAR Tower head office in Baku =Soviet era= Azneft, a business that integrated the Azerbaijani oil industry was created after the Bolshevik Revolution through the nationalization of the Azerbaijani oil industry. It was subordinate to different organizations in the former Soviet Union and the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, depending on its organizations' characteristics at different times and was known as Azerneftkomite, Azerneftkombinat (later divided into the Azerneft, Azerneftzavodlar and Azerneftmashingayirma syndicates), and Azerneftchikharma syndicates, and so forth. In 1954–1959, the Ministry of the Oil Industry of the Azerbaijan SSR and in 1965–1970, the Ministry of Oil Production Industry of the Azerbaijan SSR were established on the basis of Azerneft. In August 1970, it was renamed back to Azerneft. SOCAR’s Heydar Aliyev Baku Oil Refinery =Post-independence= As the Republic of Azerbaijan gained independence, Azerineft State Concern was established on 3 December 1991. The State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) was created on 13 September 1992 by the merger of Azerbaijan's two state oil companies, Azerineft State Concern and Azerneftkimiya Production Association according to the decree of then president Abulfaz Elchibey. In 1994, the Onshore and Offshore Oil and Gas Production Association were established as part of the State Oil Company. In 2003, the Onshore and Offshore Oil and Gas Production Association were merged to form the Azneft Production Union. In December 2005, the former head of the Baku Oil Refinery and a member of the Azerbaijani parliament, Rovnag Abdullayev, was appointed President of SOCAR. He replaced Natig Aliyev, who was named Azerbaijan's Minister of Industry and Energy. Operations =Upstream operations= SOCAR's activities are exploration, preparation, exploitation of onshore and offshore oil and gas fields in the Azerbaijan Republic, transportation, processing, refining and sale of oil, gas, condensate and other related products. SOCAR's exploration activities cover the prospective offshore fields in the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea. The current largest fields being explored are Shafag-Asiman, which is explored with BP, and Absheron natural gas fields which is being explored together with BP and Total respectively. In October 2010, SOCAR and BP signed a new production sharing agreement on development and joint exploration of Shafag- Asiman. In December 2014, SOCAR signed SWAP PSA on the joint exploration and development of potential prospects in the shallow water area around the Absheron peninsula together with BP. Besides, SOCAR holds exploration activities in Umid and Bulla Deniz gas fields on its own. In 2016, SOCAR build the new platform No. 18 and produced of gas in the same year. Azerbaijan has 57 oil fields, 18 of which are offshore, in the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea. The essential part of the company's revenue comes from the giant ACG oil field complex and Shah Deniz gas field. In September 1994, SOCAR entered into a Production sharing agreement (PSA) with the foreign oil companies led by BP for the 30-year development of the ACG oil field which was later known as the Contract of the Century. Two years later Shah Deniz PSA was signed. As of 2014 SOCAR holds 11.6% of the ACG shares and 16.7% of the Shah Deniz shares. Moreover, SOCAR operates a number of onshore fields on its own which is the main source of the domestic supply. In 2013, 43.48 million tons (318.74 million barrels) of oil was produced in Azerbaijan, of which 8.31 million tons (60.95 million barrels) belong to SOCAR. In the same period, Azerbaijan's natural gas production reached record high of 29.46 billion cubic metre of which SOCAR shares constitute 7.14 billion cubic metre of it. SOCAR and the consortium led by BP signed a letter of intent for future development of the Azer-Chirag-Gunashli field between SOCAR on 23 December 2017. According to amended and restated Azeri-Chirag-Deepwater Gunashli Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) signed on 14 September 2017, development of this field will continue until 2050 and equity share of SOCAR will increase in the ACG PSA. It was called as the Contract of the New Century by the group chief executive of BP, Bob Dudley. On 19 April 2019, SOCAR president Rovnag Abdullayev and BP's regional president for Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, Garry Johns signed a contract cost $6 billion. The final investment decision on the Azeri Central East (ACE) platform, which is planned to be built on the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) block, has been adopted at the signing ceremony. The construction is scheduled to start in 2019, and the completion is scheduled for mid-2022. =Pipeline operations= SOCAR has a share in two parallel-running major export pipelines of the country; Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline (BTC) and South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP). Azerbaijan's major export pipelinesThe pipelines deliver the ACG and Shah Deniz hydrocarbons from Sangachal Terminal located in 45 km south of Baku to Turkey and Europe. They pass through the borders of three countries: Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. The share of SOCAR in the BTC and SCP is 25% and 16.7% respectively. In addition, SOCAR is the major shareholder with 58% ownership in the Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline (TANAP) and with 20% ownership in Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) which are meant to transmit some 16 bcma of gas produced from the second phase of Shah Deniz gas field with 10 bcma of that going to Europe and 6 bcma to Turkey. The TAP is seen as a competitor to Russia's South Stream because of diversification of gas supplies to Europe. The company has stakes in the relatively low-capacity Baku-Supsa Pipeline and Baku-Novorossiysk Pipeline. The Azerbaijani part of the Baku-Novorossiysk Pipeline is operated by SOCAR, whereas Baku-Supsa Pipeline's operator is BP. Moreover, SOCAR operates Dubendi Oil Terminal in Azerbaijan and Kulevi Oil Terminal in Georgia which are important for transportation and export. =Refining operations= SOCAR has two oil refineries and one gas processing plant. Azerneftyagh Oil Refinery specializes in the production of fuels and oils, producing gasoline, kerosene and diesel distillates, various oils (industrial, motor, transformer etc.) and asphalt. All fuel distillates produced there are sent to Heydar Aliyev Baku Oil Refinery for redistillation. The refinery processes 21 out of 24 grades of the Azerbaijani crude. It meets the country's entire demand for petroleum products and 45% of its petroleum products are exported. The Gas Processing Plant produces processed gas, liquefied gas and natural gasoline. In 2010, the plant produced 4 bcm of processed gas, 24,800 tons of liquefied gas and 26,700 tons of natural gasoline. =Retail station operations= SOCAR fuel filling station on Babek Avenue, Baku, Azerbaijan The first fuel station of the company under the brand name SOCAR was opened in neighboring Georgia in 2008, before any in its home country. The fuel stations in Georgia are operated by the subsidiary of the company SOCAR Georgia Petroleum. As of 2014 there were currently more than 110 filling stations in Georgia making it the largest retail fuel station network of SOCAR. In Azerbaijan, the company operates a few (less than any other country where it operates) filling stations under the brand name SOCAR since 2010. It is the third largest network of retail stations in Azerbaijan after Azpetrol and Lukoil. In 2011, the first retail station of SOCAR was opened in Ukraine. In October 2014 the number of the SOCAR stations in Ukraine reached 40. In 2011, the company entered into the Romanian market acquiring initially 90% and at a later stage the rest 10% of the stake in Romtranspetrol. In September 2014, SOCAR launched its 30th filling station in Romania. In November 2011, SOCAR bought ExxonMobil's Swiss subsidiary Esso Schweiz for an undisclosed amount. Along with the acquisition SOCAR became the owner of a network of more than 160 filling stations operating under the brand name Esso across the country. The first SOCAR premium fueling station in Switzerland after the rebranding was opened in September 2012 in Zurich. All the operations in Switzerland are managed and led by SOCAR Energy Switzerland. =Other operations= In December 2007, SOCAR Trading was incorporated and became the marketing division of SOCAR.

Accidents On 17 August 2013, a gas blowout occurred at the platform No.90 of Bulla Deniz field. As a result, the platform burned from 17 August to 24 October 2013. On 23 October 2014, four workers were killed and three workers were in injured when during repair works on the platform No. 441 at the Narimanov field a small wagon-house fell into the sea which damaged a gas pipeline and caused a fire. Altogether, fourteen SOCAR's workers were killed in oil and gas platforms accidents in 2014. On 4 December 2015, three workers of SOCAR were reported missing after part of the living quarters at Oil Rocks fell into the sea due to a heavy storm. At the same day, seven workers were killed, 23 reported missing, and 33 were rescued and evacuated when a fire broke out on the platform No. 10 at the western section of the Gunashli oilfield. (As of January 2016, a total of 10 bodies have been found, leaving 20 people unaccounted for.) Sponsorship Since 2012, SOCAR has sought to avoid U.S. sanctions aimed at Iran, its partner in a 28 billion dollar Caspian Sea natural gas project. SOCAR funded an all-expenses-paid US-Azerbaijan \\"energy conference\\" in Baku for 10 members of Congress and 32 staff members which took place on 28 and 29 May 2013. It used two Houston based non-profit organizations, the Assembly of the Friends of Azerbaijan (AFAZ) and the Turquoise Council of Americans and Eurasians, both run by Kemal Oksuz as conduits.

An account of its less-than-successful activities can be found in Transcendental Wild Oats by Alcott's daughter Louisa May Alcott. Lane purchased what was known as the Wyman farm and its , which also included a dilapidated house and barn. Residents of Fruitlands ate no animal substances, drank only water, bathed in unheated water and \\"no artificial light would prolong dark hours or cost them the brightness of morning.\\" Additionally, property was held communally, and no animal labor was used. The community was short-lived and lasted only seven months. It was dependent on farming, which turned out to be too difficult. The original farmhouse, along with other historic buildings from the area, is now a part of Fruitlands Museum. History Fruitlands photographed in 1915 Amos Bronson Alcott, a teacher and member of the New England Non-Resistance Society, came up with the idea of Fruitlands in 1841. He traveled to England the following year, where he hoped to find support and people to participate with him in the experiment. England was home to his strongest group of supporters, a group of educators who had founded the Alcott House, a school based on his philosophy of teaching. One of his supporters was Charles Lane, who journeyed with him to the United States on October 21, 1842. In May 1843, Lane purchased the Wyman Farm in Harvard, Massachusetts for $1800. Though Alcott had come up with the idea of Fruitlands himself, he was not involved in purchasing the land, largely because he was penniless after the failure of his Temple School and his subsequent years in Concord, Massachusetts as a farmer. In July, Alcott announced their plans in The Dial: \\"We have made an arrangement with the proprieter of an estate of about a hundred acres, which liberates this tract from human ownership\\". They had officially moved to the farm on June 1 and optimistically named it \\"Fruitlands\\" despite only ten old apple trees on the property. In principle, the Fruitlands reformers did not believe in purchasing property; Lane said the following on the subject: \\"We do not recognize the purchase of land; but its redemption from the debasing state of proprium, or property, to divine uses, we clearly understand; where those whom the world esteems owners are found yielding their individual rights to the Supreme Owner\\" The commune attracted 14 residents, including the Alcott and Lane families. By July, the community had succeeded in planting of grains, one of vegetables, and one of melons. On July 8, Ralph Waldo Emerson visited along with Ellery Channing. Although he was impressed by the serenity of the site and the idea of hard work, he cautiously recorded, \\"I will not prejudge them successful... They look well in July. We will see them in December.\\" Alcott and Lane collaborated on a letter which was published in the New York Evening Tribune on September 1 and soon republished elsewhere. In the article, titled \\"The Consociate Family Life\\", the duo explained their main purpose was to improve society through \\"simplicity in diet, plain garments, pure bathing, unsullied dwellings\\". Fruitlands ultimately failed the winter after it opened, largely due to food shortages and accompanying unrest in the inhabitants. The rigors of a New England winter proved too severe for the members of the Fruitlands. Philosophy Fruitlands co-founder Amos Bronson Alcott Many of Alcott's and Lane's ideas were derived from Transcendentalism. They were influenced by the Transcendental ideas of God not as the traditional view from the Bible but as a world spirit. Alcott's view of Transcendentalism was a sort of religious anarchism, a renunciation of the world to focus on the spirit. The members of Fruitlands believed that spiritual regeneration was linked to physical health, that \\"outward abstinence is a sign of inward fullness\\". Though it was based on working together as a community, Fruitlands also hoped for individualistic improvement. Alcott also believed in the perfect intuition of children and, therefore, put a strong emphasis on education and hoped that their innocence would have a rejuvenating effect on elders. =Economy= Fruitlands residents, who called themselves \\"the consociate family\\", wished to separate themselves from the world economy by refraining from trade, having no personal property, and not using hired labor. Alcott and Lane believed that the community could achieve complete freedom only by eliminating economic activity altogether. Alcott in particular believed the present economy was evil. To this end, they strove towards self-sufficiency by planning on growing all the food they would need themselves and making only the goods they needed. By accomplishing these two goals, they would eliminate the need to participate in trade or to purchase their food from the outside world. Initially, Bronson Alcott and Lane modeled their ideas about personal property off the Shakers, who held property communally. However, the Shakers were not completely self- sufficient; they traded their hand-made goods for coffee, tea, meat and milk. Bronson Alcott and Lane eliminated the need to trade for these supplies because they eliminated animal products and stimulants from their diets entirely. In the end, the Fruitlands community had no effect on the economy of the outside world; Fruitlands allowed its residents to practice their ideals without forcing them to effect any real change. =Lifestyle and diet= Fruitlands residents began their days with a purging cold-water shower and subsisted on a simple diet containing no stimulants or animal products. They were vegans, excluding even milk and honey from their diets. “Neither coffee, tea, molasses, nor rice tempts us beyond the bounds of indigenous production,” Lane wrote. “No animal substances neither flesh, butter, cheese, eggs, nor milk pollute our tables, nor corrupt our bodies.” Diet was usually fruit and water; many vegetables—including carrots, beets, and potatoes—were forbidden because they showed a lower nature by growing downward. Greaves' Table of the Circumstantial Law, as revised by Fruitlands co-founder Charles Lane Fruitlands members wore only linen clothes and canvas shoes; cotton fabric was forbidden because it exploited slave labor and wool was banned because it came from sheep. Bronson Alcott and Lane believed that animals should not be exploited for their meat or their labor, so they used no animals for farming. This arose out of two beliefs: that animals were less intelligent than humans and that, therefore, it was the duty of humans to protect them; and that using animals \\"tainted\\" their work and food, since animals were not enlightened and therefore unclean. Eventually, as the winter was coming, Alcott and Lane compromised and allowed an ox and a cow. Residents There were no formal admission requirements or procedures to join the community at Fruitlands, and there was no official record-keeping of members. Many residents stayed only for a short period of time and most lists are based on the journals of Alcott's wife Abby May. Residents of the Fruitlands came to be called \\"consecrated cranks\\" and followed strict principles and virtues. They strongly believed in the ideas of simplicity, sincerity, and brotherly love. *Amos Bronson Alcott - Born in 1799, Bronson Alcott was a prominent educator and Transcendentalist who believed in eliminating corporal punishment, and incorporating field trips, physical education, art and music into the curriculum. *Abigail Alcott - Abigail was Bronson Alcott's wife and also a reformer. She was one of only two women who lived at Fruitlands, and was primarily responsible for taking care of the house and farm, as well as raising her four children. *Louisa May Alcott - The Alcotts' second daughter, her short piece Transcendental Wild Oats was written about her experiences at Fruitlands. *Charles Lane - Lane met Bronson Alcott in England in 1841, at which time Lane was living at the Alcott House school in Surrey. His strict views on living a \\"pure\\" life were ultimately part of what destroyed the Fruitlands community. His son was also a resident of Fruitlands. *Joseph Palmer - Palmer joined Fruitlands in August 1843, and stayed through the demise of the commune, later purchasing the farm and founding another utopian society there. He was famous for wearing a full beard, despite social stigma against it; he had even served time in prison for defending his right to wear a beard. *Isaac Hecker - Hecker began life as a baker in New York City, but then went through a progression of religious and spiritual explorations. He resided at Brook Farm, another Transcendentalist community, for six months before joining the Fruitlands community. He was initially attracted by the \\"deeper\\" spiritual life at Fruitlands compared to Brook Farm, though he only stayed for two months. He later became a Roman Catholic priest. *Samuel Larned - Like Hecker, Larned lived briefly at Brook Farm before coming to Fruitlands. He was known for using foul language because he believed that swears said with a pure heart uplifted listeners. *Abraham Everett - Also known as Abraham Woods, he changed his name upon his arrival at Fruitlands, to Wood Abram. He had once been committed to an insane asylum before joining Fruitlands. *Samuel Bower - Bower lived at Fruitlands for only a few months, after which he left to experiment with nudism, believing that clothes \\"stifled the spirit\\". *Ann Page - Besides Abby May Alcott, Page was the only adult female member of Fruitlands. Page and Mrs. Alcott were responsible for most of the household chores and often had to take care of the farm as well. Page was eventually kicked out of Fruitlands, supposedly for eating a piece of fish, which was forbidden in the community. Dissolution and legacy Historical marker at the former site of Fruitlands The biggest challenge at Fruitlands was farming. The community had arrived at the farm a month behind the planting schedule and only about of land were arable. The decision not to use animal labor on the farm proved to be the undoing of the commune, combined with the fact that many of the men of the commune spent their days teaching or philosophizing instead of working in the field. Using only their own hands, the Fruitlands residents were incapable of growing a sufficient amount of food to get them through the winter. Fruitlands was also hampered by its structure. Alcott and Lane wielded nearly limitless authority and dictated very strict and repressive models for living. \\"I am prone to indulge in an occasional hilarity\\", wrote Alcott's wife Abby May, \\"but seem frowned down into still quiet and peace-less order... [and] am almost suffocated in this atmosphere of restriction and form\\". The Fruitlands experiment ended only seven months after it began. According to Bronson Alcott, the inhabitants left Fruitlands in January 1844; his daughter, Louisa May, wrote that they left in December 1843, which is considered to be the more accurate date. Alcott was deeply dismayed by the failure of Fruitlands and, moving with his family to live with a nearby farmer, refused to eat for several days. Later, Ralph Waldo Emerson helped purchase a home for the family in Concord. Fruitlands had only a brief opportunity to impact America and the Transcendentalist movement. After it had ended, the land was bought by one of its former participants, Joseph Palmer, who for 20 years used the site as a refuge for former reformers. The property was purchased in 1910 by Clara Endicott Sears, who opened the farmhouse to the public in 1914 as a museum. Today, the Fruitlands Museum also includes a museum on Shaker life, an art gallery of nineteenth-century paintings, and a museum of Native American art and crafts.

The community is located approximately halfway between the town of Rose Bud to the north, and the unincorporated community of El Paso to the south. Alternately, the community is about northwest of Beebe, and less than east of Mount Vernon. Considered as a postal designation (ZIP code: 72136), the population of Romance as of the 2010 census was 1,772 residents. Geography and history Lacking exact boundaries, much of the Romance area falls within the borders of Marshall Township and Kentucky Township within White County. As legend maintains, the community was named by a school teacher many years ago who thought the view from bluffs on the community's eastern side was particularly romantic. Romance has been noted for its unusual place name. Naming of the community has proven significant in maintaining Romance's most visible business, a small branch post office of the United States Postal Service. The local post office is one of several within the USPS system that gain attention because of \\"love-themed\\" names, but received special focus in 1990 as the first location to issue that year's stamp in the USPS Love Stamp series. Romance's post office is among those popular around the United States for postmarks of cards for Valentine's Day, as well as for wedding invitations. A side venture of sorts has developed in recent years, with a small number of weddings performed on the grounds of the post office, though the practice is not affiliated with the USPS. Government As an unincorporated community, local government of Romance is part of the jurisdiction of the county judge of White County, the county's chief executive, and subject to county-wide ordinances. The current County Judge is Michael Lincoln of Searcy. The community is represented legislatively in the county's quorum court in Searcy, the county seat, during monthly and special meetings by the quorum court district's justice of the peace. Local law enforcement, similarly, is provided directly from the county level by deputies of the White County Sheriff's Department, as well as township constables for Marshall and Kentucky townships. The current Sheriff is Ricky Shourd and the current Constable is Curtis Elliot. Judicial enforcement is the responsibility of the circuit court judge and prosecuting attorney. A small southern portion of the Romance area is federally controlled territory used as a parachute drop zone for Little Rock Air Force Base in Jacksonville; the base is approximately south of the territory. The drop zone was first established in the early 1980s. Additionally, Romance is represented legislatively on the state level in the Arkansas General Assembly as part of Senate District 18 (Senator Missy Irvin) and House District 44 (Representative Cameron Cooper); the community is part of Arkansas's 2nd Congressional District on the federal level. Terrain and climate Small creeks and ponds can be found around the community, including Cedar Creek on Romance's south side. Clifty Creek flows through the center of Romance. Bad Luck Creek and Bayou Des Arc also flow nearby to the east, with Des Arc being dammed and forming Barnett Lake between Romance and the nearby community of Floyd. Scenic waterfalls can be found along these streams. There are a series of steep and elevated bluffs along Highway 31, with several pull off points to enjoy the scenic view. Geographically, Romance is considered to be in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains. The southern portion of the community, which is situated atop Black Jack Mountain, is significantly higher in elevation than other parts of Romance. The overall climate is somewhat similar to that found in other north central Arkansas communities, with warm, dry summers and cold, wet winters. Severe weather can include thunderstorms, hail, and tornados during the warm months, with snow, sleet, freezing rain and frigid windchills in the winter months. Transportation Romance is situated along two major Arkansas state highways: * Highway 5, a north–south highway serving central Arkansas. This major portion of the highway continues north to the Missouri state line, and south to Cabot at U.S. Highway 67. Among other intersections, this path provides access to U.S. Highway 64 at El Paso, and U.S. Highways 62 and 412 in Mountain Home. * Highway 31, a north–south highway with a northern terminus in Romance at Arkansas 5, and continuing through Beebe and Lonoke towards its southern terminus at the U.S. Highway 79 business loop northeast of Pine Bluff. The path provides access to U.S. Highway 67 in Beebe, and Interstate 40 in Lonoke. The majority of roads in the area are administered by the White County Road Department, including Hilltop Acres, which serves the center of Romance and connects to both Arkansas 5 (opposite Manning Road) and Arkansas 31 (opposite Rogers Road). Passing by the former Romance Store building, which once housed the community's post office, the southern portion of Hilltop Acres travels through something of an unofficial downtown area. The post office was relocated to a lot along Arkansas 31 in the early 1990s; the remaining general store closed soon afterward. Among county roads in the area, four major roads serve greater Romance: * Blackjack Mountain Road (White County Road 149) is a paved road of the White County road system that travels south of but somewhat parallel to the westernmost portion of Arkansas 31. The name of the approximately 6.5-mile-long east–west road is taken from blackjack oak trees found throughout the hills on Romance's south side. Its western terminus is at Arkansas 5, opposite a portion of Highway 310. Its eastern terminus is at Arkansas 31, to the northwest of the unincorporated community of Floyd. * Romance Road (White County Road 26) is an east–west unpaved road of the White County road system that travels from its western terminus at Kentucky Valley Road near Romance's center to approximately 1/2 mile east of Gravel Hill Road, currently dead ending at Quattlebaum Cemetery, in the unincorporated community of Gravel Hill. A portion of the road runs parallel to Bad Luck Creek. For all basic purposes, the Gravel Hill community is considered an integral part of the greater Romance area. The local fire departments have noted that the Floyd/Romance Volunteer Fire Department will service those living on the south end of Gravel Hill Road, with the department based in the nearby unincorporated community of Joy providing service to those on the north end of Gravel Hill. * Kentucky Valley Road (White County Road 157) is a paved road of the White County road system with a varied path mostly traveling north and northeast of the center of Romance. Its southern terminus is at Hilltop Acres, to the right of former Romance Store building and leading past the community's volunteer-staffed fire station. Occasionally taking 90-degree turns, its final turn is toward a northern terminus at Daffodil Road. Kentucky Valley Road travels toward Kentucky Township, with both the road and township taking their names from early settlers of the area having arrived from Kentucky. * Daffodil Road is a north–south unpaved road of the White County road system that travels mostly north and northwest from a southern terminus intersecting with Hilltop Acres, as that road veers to the left, near the center of Romance. Daffodil Road continues toward a northern terminus at Denison Road, south of Rose Bud. The closest navigable waterway for commercial use is the Arkansas River at Little Rock. Commercial rail service is available in Little Rock and North Little Rock, with passenger rail service also in Little Rock. The nearest airfield is Cantrell Field, southwest of the city limits of Conway, offering charter service at Conway Municipal Airport (CXW). Major airlines and air freight service are available in Little Rock at Little Rock National Airport (LIT), Adams Field. Education =Early childhood= Education for children in Romance prior to the age of five years is primarily home-based, though a limited amount of day-care facilities can be found within short drives of the community. =Elementary and secondary= Children in the greater Romance area are largely served by the Rose Bud Public School District in nearby Rose Bud. Romance's school district was consolidated with the Rose Bud district during the 1950s, and the community had a local school as early as 1895, when the Harper School on Blackjack Mountain operated.http://www.argenweb.net/white/yesterday/Romance_files/romahsch1895.html Extreme eastern portions of the community are part of the Beebe Public School District. Both are member schools of the Beebe-based Wilbur D. Mills Educational Service Cooperative. Far western portions of the area are part of the Mount Vernon-Enola Public School District, part of the Arch Ford Educational Service Cooperative based in Plumerville. =Colleges and universities= Seven post-secondary institutions of higher learning are located within a radius of Romance: * Arkansas State University Beebe – a campus of the state's second-largest public university – is a satellite of the main campus in Jonesboro. ASU-Beebe further serves as a parent campus to two- year branch campuses in Searcy and Heber Springs within the radius; a learning center operated at Little Rock Air Force Base is also part of the ASU-Beebe system. Via distance learning connections, the Beebe campus offers varied bachelor's degrees as well as several associate-level degrees. The university is the oldest and second-largest two-year institution in the state, in terms of student enrollment. * Harding University, a private four-year university affiliated with the Churches of Christ, with its main campus in Searcy, a school of theology in Memphis, Tennessee, and varied international study programs in Europe, Africa, South America and Australia. * Hendrix College, a private four-year college affiliated with the United Methodist Church, located in Conway, and like Harding, regarded by many as one of the most prestigious institutions of its kind in Arkansas. * The University of Central Arkansas, a leading four-year public university in the region, located in Conway, particularly notable for programs in educating teachers. The broadcast center of the Arkansas Educational Television Network is located on the UCA campus. * Central Baptist College, a private four-year college affiliated with the Missionary Baptist Church, located in Conway and near the UCA campus. The school is notable for religious studies programs, with more recently developed programs geared toward instruction in media, public service and medical careers. Economy Few businesses are found in Romance, with commuting to jobs in surrounding communities being very common. The average travel time from home to work as of 2000 is typically around 44 minutes, according to research from the U.S. Census Bureau. Those businesses most easily identified, other than the USPS, include hay and grass farming, raising of livestock, meat processing, and antique and craft sales. The Romance area is also part of the Fayetteville Shale Play, a region for natural gas resource exploration throughout northern Arkansas since 2005. In popular culture During early 2012, the Animal Planet series American Stuffers chronicled the owner and staff of Xtreme Taxidermy, a Romance area taxidermy shop specializing in pet preservation located approximately two miles south of Blackjack Mountain Road along Arkansas Highway 5.

It runs east-west underneath the two major rivers of Lyon, connecting Vieux Lyon with the Presqu'ile and the Part-Dieu region. Line D commenced operation under human control on 4 September 1991, between Gorge-de-Loup and Grange-Blanche. It was extended to Gare de Vénissieux on 11 December 1992, when it switched to automatic (driverless) operation, also known as MAGGALY (Métro Automatique à Grand Gabarit de l’Agglomération Lyonnaise). On 28 April 1997, the line was extended again to Gare de Vaise. Being the deepest of the lines in Lyon, it was constructed mainly using boring machines and passes under both rivers, the Rhône and the Saône.

The MPL 85 are composed of 2 cars per trainset. From 2020, only during peak hours, each train could combine two MPL 85 trainsets and form a single train of 4 cars. In 2016, new MPL-16 trains have been ordered to Alstom. 10 of them will circulate on the line starting from 2023, in addition to MPL 85 trains. The 2 cars of each train will be connected with gangways, and it will be a novelty in Lyon Metro. The MPL 16 trains won't be able to run on the line D with the current driverless system, MAGGALY. To overcome this problem, the line D will get a new driverless system, the same as the one which will equip the line B starting from 2020, where MPL 16 will circulate too.

It is situated north of York. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 3,714, reducing to 3,610 at the 2011 Census. Prior to 1996 it had been part of the Ryedale district. Wigginton is bordered on the east by the township of Haxby, the A1237 York Outer ring Road to the south, the B1363 to the west and open farmland to the north. History The village name derives from the Old English pre-7th century personal name \\"Wicga\\", meaning \\"a beetle\\", plus the Old English suffix, \\"-tun\\", meaning a \\"settlement or enclosure, hence \\"Wigca's settlement\\". The village was named in the Domesday Book and noted as belonging to the cathedral church of St Peter in York. The name of the village has been recorded as Wichestun in the 11th century and Wygynton in the 13th century. The first recorded owners of the manor were the Askebys, who may have been connected with the neighbouring village of Haxby, and of Roger de Haxbey, who owned nearby land during the reign of Edward I. Hugh de Moresby, Lord of Moresby in Cumberland, was in possession of the manor of Wigginton in 1337. Through inheritance and marriage the manor passed to Anne Pickering and her second husband, Sir Henry Knyvett. She sold the manor with others in 1541 to Henry VIII, but his heir, Edward VI, granted them back to Anne and Henry in 1548. Governance Wigginton was in the Vale of York parliamentary constituency until the 2010 general election when it was transferred to the newly created constituency of York Outer. In that election the Conservative Party candidate, Julian Sturdy, was elected having received 43% of the vote and a majority of 3,688 over the Liberal Democrat candidate. The town is located within the Haxby and Wigginton Ward of the York Unitary Authority. As of May 2019 it is represented by Councillors Andrew Hollyer (Liberal Democrat), Edward Pearson (Liberal Democrat) and Ian Cuthbertson (Liberal Democrat). Demography In 1872 the population was recorded as 349. In the National Census of 1881 the population had risen to 399. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 3,714. Geography The town sits on flat ground consisting mostly of clay with soil that is sand and alluvium. To the west of the village is Westfield Beck. The nearby town of Haxby now merges with Wigginton though the old Parish Boundary map still shows the dividing line. This runs east to west along the back of the houses on Wheatfield Drive on its southern edge as far as Barley Drive. Here it turns northward cutting across Greenshaw Drive until it reaches the road known The Village. The boundary follows this road until it turns west. The boundary at this point continues northward cutting across Windsor Drive near Ripley Grove and then out into the countryside.

The range lies amongst a series of range-valley-ranges, in south-central Nevada (mostly south of the Humboldt River).

Swedish archaeologists 1922. Asine (; ) was an ancient Greek city of ancient Argolis, located on the coast. It is mentioned by Homer in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad as one of the places subject to Diomedes, king of Argos. It is said to have been founded by the Dryopes, who originally dwelt on Mount Parnassus. In one of the early wars (740 BCE) between the Lacedaemonians and the Argives, the Asinaeans joined the former when they invaded the Argive territory under their king Nicander; but as soon as the Lacedaemonians returned home, the Argives laid siege to Asine and razed it to the ground, sparing only the temple of the Pythaëus Apollo. The Asinaeans escaped by sea; and the Lacedaemonians gave to them, after the end of the First Messenian War, a portion of the Messenian territory, where they built a new town (also named Asine). Nearly ten centuries after the destruction of the city its ruins were visited by Pausanias, who found the temple of Apollo still standing., 3.7.4, 4.14.3, 4.34.9, et seq. Its site is located near the modern Tolon. Excavations made from 1922 by Swedish archaeologists led by Axel W. Persson (and involving the then Crown Prince Gustav Adolf of Sweden) found the acropolis of ancient Asine surrounded by a Cyclopean wall (much modified in the Hellenistic era) and a Mycenaean era necropolis with many Mycenaean chamber tombs containing skeletal remains and grave goods. Excavations have continued since the 1920s almost continuously under the Swedish Institute at Athens.Richard Stillwell, ed.

It was released on December 17, 2005, when it was broadcast on Saturday Night Live as their second Digital Short. Primarily performed by Andy Samberg and fellow cast member Chris Parnell, the song and accompanying music video follow the two comedians as they eat cupcakes from the Magnolia Bakery, buy snacks at a convenience store, and smuggle the food into a Sunday afternoon matinee of The Chronicles of Narnia. The song was written by Samberg and Parnell, as well as Lonely Island members Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone, in one night. They recorded the following night in the comedy troupe's office and shot the music video around Manhattan two days later using a borrowed camera. After being quickly mixed and edited by Schaffer, the short was approved for broadcast on the next evening's telecast of Saturday Night Live by producer Lorne Michaels. Although the writers initially worried the studio audience would respond to the short negatively, the short received a positive reception and enjoyed Internet stardom overnight, with multiple bootleg copies surfacing on video-sharing website YouTube, catapulting the awareness of the then-fledgling website. The song and short brought forth positive critical reception, with many hailing it as a revival for the stagnant series. In retrospect, commentators have named \\"Lazy Sunday\\" as one of the best Saturday Night Live moments of the 2000s. Background The track \\"Lazy Sunday\\" and its accompanying music video follow the two cast members (Parnell and Samberg), who adopt the brash personas of hardcore rappers. The song follows their quest to achieve their \\"ultimate goal\\" of attending a matinee of the fantasy film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The lyrics involve subjects that are \\"anything but hardcore,\\" such as eating cupcakes from the Magnolia Bakery, searching for travel directions on MapQuest and buying tickets with $10 bills. Samberg described the lyrics as \\"two guys rapping about very lame, sensitive stuff.\\" Schaffer and Taccone had been on the writing staff for nearly three months, yet to this point they had only two live sketches that survived the dress rehearsal process and actually made it on air. Recording and production The song was recorded in one night on Taccone's laptop in the offices of Saturday Night Live in the GE Building. Parnell, Samberg, Schaffer, and Taccone wrote \\"Lazy Sunday\\" on the evening of December 12, 2005. They recorded the following night in the office The Lonely Island occupied together using a laptop Taccone bought on Craigslist. While colleagues were rehearsing and rewriting that Saturday's show, the group spent the morning of December 15 shooting their video with a borrowed camera. The video used the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in Chelsea to stand in for a multiplex cinema and Taccone's girlfriend's sister, comic Emily Heller, to play a convenience-store clerk. Schaffer spent the entire next night (into the morning) editing the video and working with technicians to bring it up to broadcast standards. In the moments preceding the show's live performance and broadcast, the team learned from Michaels that \\"Lazy Sunday\\" would be shown on that night's show. The three comedians were very worried about how the video would be received by the studio audience. Release The short had its premiere on Saturday Night Live (season 31, episode 9) and received a positive response. \\"It played really well, and we were just super happy about that,\\" said Samberg. The video aired during the actor's first season on the show, when he and the comedy troupe were little known to even Saturday Night Live most devout fans; Samberg reported that the video greatly increased his recognizability \\"overnight\\". \\"It captures a certain scrappiness about the show. There's an unpolished realness to it that I think people can instantly relate to,\\" said Saturday Night Live veteran Amy Poehler. By the following morning, the video was a national cultural sensation. Schaffer and Taccone also were contacted by friends who heard the track played on radio stations and in bars. \\"Lazy Sunday\\" inspired a line of T-shirts, released during the initial boom of popularity in the weeks after its release. According to Bill Hader, speaking about the event in 2019 on Conan O'Brien's podcast, it propelled Samberg to a level of stardom above his SNL co-stars; he recalled Samberg receiving an applause break the following week when appearing in a sketch. Hader recalled, \\"None of us were angry or jealous but it was more of an envious [feeling], just 'wow, did you see that?' We'd never been that close to a thing that was a phenomenon.\\" The success of \\"Lazy Sunday\\" encouraged Michaels to trust the troupe more and push their material onto the show. The short was initially available after its broadcast through the iTunes Store (then known as the iTunes Music Store), made free for subscribers. Additionally, it was posted to several web sites and shared via e-mail by fans. The unofficial uploads of the video went viral and were cumulatively watched more than five million times on YouTube. The clips were removed in February 2006, when NBC Universal asked the site to remove all copies, along with several other copyrighted NBC video clips. YouTube at that time was a startup website that appeared to be aimed for video creators, but by February 2006, due to \\"Lazy Sunday\\", established itself as a home for any type of video sharing. YouTube would later that year be purchased by Google for .NBC nastygrams YouTube over \\"Lazy Sunday\\" , Boing Boing NBC later placed the short on its SNL site and Hulu.

In the break between verses, the song is dubstep instead of the regular instrumental like in the original. However, in the middle of a song, Samberg and Parnell transform the song into a darker dubstep mafioso rap song. Samberg used Lazy Sunday 2 to bring a close to his time on SNL, with the final lines referring to how the first Lazy Sunday had been the opening chapter of his celebrity, and the sequel was how he would end his SNL tenure. \\"On these New York streets, I honed my fake rap penmanship. That's how I began, and that's how I'mma finish it!\\"SNL Digital Short: \\"Lazy Sunday 2\\" – YouTube Cultural influence \\"Lazy Sunday\\" is considered to have helped turn around Saturday Night Lives declining performance performance prior to 2005. Thanks to \\"Lazy Sunday\\" initial iTunes success, Apple announced they had licensed several archived Saturday Night Live sketches to offer for download in January 2006. The viral success of the video is widely credited as having been the tipping-point for YouTube's success. The video-hosting site had gone online five months earlier, in July 2005. The rap video was the first television clip to go viral on the site, and in the week of its upload, the website traffic went up 83-percent. The video also spawned dozens of response videos, including a West Coast response by actor Mark Feuerstein, an English response by comedian Sam Baron, an Australian response about lawn bowls, a song that defended the honor of the Midwest called \\"Lazy Muncie,\\" and \\"Lazy Ramadi,\\" a song by two US Army SSGs based in Ramadi, Iraq. In \\"The Merger\\", an episode of the television series The Office, Michael Scott makes an orientation film called \\"Lazy Scranton\\" for the Stamford employees who were transferred to Scranton. Starring Michael and Dwight, the video uses the same music, rap style, and camera effects used in the \\"Lazy Sunday\\" video. In the feature film Epic Movie, the character Captain Jack Swallows (a reference to Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise) breaks out in a rap called \\"Lazy Pirate Day\\"; the song is reminiscent of \\"Lazy Sunday\\" both visually and musically. Swallows is played by Darrell Hammond, a long-time performer on Saturday Night Live.

He was one of the most prolific authors of fu poetry of his time. He was a grandson of Fu Xie (), a son of Fu Gan (), and the father of Fu Xian ().Britannica Kokusai Dai-Hyakkajiten article \\"Fu Xuan\\" (Fu Gen in Japanese). Shogakukan.Kanjigen entry \\"Fu Xuan\\" (Fu Gen in Japanese). Gakken 2006. Life Although he lost his father early and grew up poor, Fu Xuan eventually became famous in literature and music. Nominated as a civil service candidate by the local provincial government, he was appointed as a Gentleman () and put in charge of managing the compilation of the historical text Book of Wei (). Later, he became a subordinate of Sima Zhao, the regent of Wei from 255 to 265. He rose through the ranks to become the Administrator () of Hongnong Commandery () and Colonel of Agriculture (). In 265, after Sima Yan usurped the Wei throne and established the Jin dynasty (265–420) with himself as the new emperor, he appointed Fu Xuan as a Regular Mounted Attendant () and awarded him the title of a Viscount (). Later, Fu Xuan was reassigned to be a Commandant of Escorting Cavalry (). Fu Xuan was recommended to the position of Palace Attendant (), but was dismissed from consideration after a falling-out. In 268, he became Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk (), and in 259 Minister Coachman (). He authored a memorial to suggest ways of preparing for floods and external invasions. He later served as the Colonel-Director of Retainers (). He was of such an impatient disposition that whenever he had any memorial or impeachment to submit, he would proceed at once to the palace, no matter what the hour of the day or night, and sit there until he had audience the following dawn. It was while thus waiting that he caught a chill from which he subsequently died. Fu Xuan also once wrote an essay praising the Chinese mechanical engineers Ma Jun and Zhang Heng, where he lamented the fact that extraordinary talents of natural geniuses were often ignored or neglected by those in charge. Writings According to his biography in the Book of Jin, Fu Xuan wrote over a hundred volumes of the Wen Ji (), the Fu Zi (), and over 120 texts, of which only a small fraction survived to this day. The Fu Zi, for example, survives only in the form of annotations added by Pei Songzhi in the fifth century to the third-century text Records of the Three Kingdoms. Fu Xuan expressed in his writings a critical view of a number of his contemporaries, including both supporters and enemies of Sima Zhao. Poetry Fu Xuan's poems, primarily in the yuefu style, are noted for their powerful and empathetic portrayals of women. Translations of several of his sixty-odd surviving poems can be found in the book New Songs from a Jade Terrace by Anne Birrell (). One of the more famous poems by Fu Xuan is \\"Woman\\": :How sad it is to be a woman!! :Nothing on earth is held so cheap. :Boys stand leaning at the door :Like Gods fallen out of Heaven. :Their hearts brave the Four Oceans, :The wind and dust of a thousand miles. :No one is glad when a girl is born: :By her the family sets no store. :When she grows up, she hides in her room :Afraid to look at a man in the face. :No one cries when she leaves her home—Sudden as clouds when the rain stops. :She bows her head and composes her face, :Her teeth are pressed on her red lips: :She bows and kneels countless times. :She must humble herself even to the servants. :His love is distant as the stars in Heaven, :Yet the sunflower bends towards the sun. :Their hearts are more sundered than water and fire—A hundred evils are heaped upon her. :Her face will follow the years changes: :Her lord will find new pleasures. :They that were once like the substance and shadow :Are now as far from Hu as from Ch'in [two distant places] :Yet Hu and Ch'in shall sooner meet :That they whose parting is like Ts'an and Ch'en [two stars](http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/c-poet2.html) See also *Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms *Poetry *Chinese poetry *List of Chinese people *Chinese poets *Feminism *Feminist Movement References * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

It was the solo project of The Olivia Tremor Control's Bill Doss. The name predates the Olivia Tremor Control and was in use until Doss's 2012 death. Doss started the project while in high school, going as far as to self-release an album on cassette called A Spiraling World of Pop, later re-released under the Elephant Six banner. Doss then met up with Will Cullen Hart and Jeff Mangum; together, they formed The Olivia Tremor Control, and the Sunshine Fix moniker was put into hiatus (although, as an aside, it became the title of an Olivia Tremor Control song, which appears on the Singles and Beyond compilation). Following the dismantling of Olivia Tremor Control in 2000, Doss began recording under the Sunshine Fix name again, releasing a single and preparing an EP, which was released by Kindercore Records in 2000, featuring members of the Olivia Tremor Control, Of Montreal, Elf Power, and others. In 2001, Doss formed a more stable band, adding Kevin Sweeney and Sam Mixon, and released Age of the Sun on Emperor Norton Records. A tour with The Four Corners followed. In 2001, drummer Dave Gerow joined the fray to tour in support of \\"Age of the Sun\\" with acts like Guster, Ugly Casanova, and Sloan. They continued touring and recorded Green Imagination at the home of Widespread Panic bassist Dave Schools and mixed by Andy Baker at The Bakery in Athens GA. Green Imagination was released on SpinArt records in 2004. Although the record received a generally muted critical reception, the band continued to tour in its support.

She later became a pipa soloist for the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe. Early life During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, Gao Hong's father was sent to a rural area of China, due to his criticism of the Mao Zedong and the Chinese government. Her mother, being highly concerned about her future, took her to a fortune teller at age 6 to find out what her future would be like. The fortune teller told her that she would be a \\"flying dragon\\" (a Chinese nickname given to people who travel all over and never settle down, which is also the name of one of her compositions). When she was 12 years old she became a professional pipa player and was already traveling throughout China to perform in concerts and different shows. Move to the United States In 1994 Gao gave a 10-city tour of the United States and eventually settled in Minnesota.

Famous alumni include Bob Griese. Its name comes from the Latin King of the World. The premises are now used for Ivy Tech. Rex Mundi was located at 3501 N. First Avenue, Evansville, IN 47710. It opened in the fall of 1959 in a rapidly expanding area close to what was then the north city limits of Evansville. The Country Club Meadows and Country Club Manor subdivisions opened in the early to mid 1950s in the immediate vicinity of the Rex Mundi site. At the time of the opening of the high school, the Diocese of Evansville maintained a strict policy requiring those registered in Catholic parishes to send their children to Diocesan schools. While it required an entrance exam for admissions (and exempted those who failed from the required attendance in the Catholic High School system), Rex Mundi benefited from the Diocesan attendance policy and soon was full to overflowing. History =Background= The effects of World War II had many implications for most of the world. One post-war outcome was the massive worldwide increase of births between 1946 and 1964, known as the Baby Boom. Approximately 76 million boomers were born in the United States, accounting for 29% of the population. The generations immense size brought them economic powers, rises in electronic mass media, and a high level of education. However, obtaining this high level of educational success did not come easily. Despite the positive reflections, this unexpected event inflicted problems on the nation as well. Because of the high fertility rate, more students than ever flooded into schools. Based on elementary school enrollment, there were expected to be 3,700 Catholic high school students by 1964. Mater Dei and Reitz Memorial were the only Catholic schools for these students to be distributed to. Reitz Memorial was built to hold 500 students and was handling almost twice that many. Mater Dei, built for 600, was almost as crowded. Classrooms became quickly overcrowded as the capacity of students reached its maximum. Bishop Grimmelsman decided that there was no other alternative but to build a new school. =Opening= In 1956 the decision was made to open the third catholic high school in Evansville, Rex Mundi. The 15 acres of land was purchased from Mr. and Mrs. Ollie Heerdink. Rex Mundi was constructed by Virgil Miller, who was also responsible for planning other schools within the diocese. Located on First Avenue near Buena Vista, the school is expected to hold 700 to 750 pupils. On opening day, Rex Mundi welcomed 280 students. Of which, about 200 were freshmen, and the remaining were sophomores. Enrollment was expected to reach 800 in several years. =Early years= The high school began with a Catholic priest, Father Charles Meny, as superintendent, and with priests, nuns (Sisters of St. Francis of Oldenburg, Indiana) and a few lay teachers making up the faculty. The school \\"tracked\\" its students for most courses, providing basic college prep courses as well as business and home economics courses that those in college prep were not allowed to take—at least in the first several years of the school's tenure. Priests taught all religion courses, and religion was a required subject. An outstanding strength of the school was its mathematics department, headed up by Franciscan Sister Theresa Marie. Under her guidance the school captured medals in state math competitions for several years, beginning soon after Rex Mundi opened. The sports program, particularly the basketball team, also garnered attention statewide. Graduating in the class of 1963, basketball team captain Bob Griese went on to fame in college and professional football. Father Meny kept strict control over the day-to-day workings of the school. Unlike another Catholic high school in Evansville, Reitz Memorial, which boasted separate programs for young women and young men within the same building, Rex Mundi's boys and girls attended classes together. (Religion, biology and gym classes were separated by gender.) Into at least the middle 1960s a demerit system drove the discipline policy of the institution, and speaking to members of the opposite sex in the hallways was against the school rules, resulting in demerits. (A diocese- wide rule book for Catholic high school students forbade dating before the age of 16 and bringing a non-Catholic boyfriend or girlfriend to school dances; infractions of these rules often resulted in calls to parents.) Other rules were typical of schools of the time and included proscription of talking in class, disobeying direct orders from teachers, etc. An accumulation of a certain amount of demerits triggered suspension or expulsion. A visit to Father Meny for disciplinary action was a serious matter at Rex Mundi High School in the early years. =Closing= By 1971, Rex Mundi became a victim of falling enrollment and pressing finances. Enrollment in the Catholic high schools fell dramatically from 2,530 students in 1967 to only 1,900 in 1971. With the extreme decline of incoming students, the need for three Catholic schools was not necessary. Ultimately, the only option was to shut down one of the Catholic high schools. Reitz Memorial was quickly taken out of the equation because it was the founding school and centrally located. The decision process of whether to close Rex Mundi or Mater Dei was contemplated for three months before a conclusion was finally made. February 29, 1972, Peter Taromina, of the Area Catholic School Board, made the motion to retain Mater Dei and Reitz Memorial high schools. This motion was seconded by Wilbur “Red” Walker. The board voted 7-4 to close Rex Mundi. The results were taken to Diocesan Council who voted 12-4 to close the school. March 29, 1972, the decision to close Rex Mundi was made official. The current students, administrators, graduates, and families were all strongly affected by the decision. If the Rex Mundi students chose to continue in the Catholic high school system, their options were either be transferred to Mater Dei or Reitz Memorial. Juniors were allowed to decide which school they wanted to attend, however, underclassmen had to go to the school in their district. They began visiting Mater Dei and Reitz Memorial high schools to become acquainted with future classmates and teachers. Each day, fifteen Rex Mundi students from the freshmen, sophomore, and junior classes spent their school day at one of the two schools. A Rex Mundi student was assigned a student at the host school with similar academic interests to provide a tour. This allowed the Rex Mundi student to get an idea of what the classes at his or her new school would be like. The school board was “firmly committed” to providing adequate transportation. The Evansville Catholic Diocese put the former Rex Mundi convent up for sale. March 22, 1975, George Utley, director of Ivy Tech, purchased the old Rex Mundi convent for $1.5 million for the state. More than half of the proceeds from the sales of Rex Mundi was used to pay off old debts. With the closing of Rex Mundi, faculty had to be distributed elsewhere. Catholic school officials were responsible for the employment of staff and faculty for the two remaining Catholic high schools in Evansville. The selection of faculty depended on a basis of need, competence, and seniority. Like any other high school, Rex Mundi gave students the opportunity to make new friends, experience new things, and make great memories. Because these memories were created, Rex Mundi alumni hold a special link to their school.

Its primary watercourse is the Galisteo River or Galisteo Creek, a perennial stream, for part of its course, that flows from the eastern highlands down into the Rio Grande about three miles above the Santo Domingo Pueblo. The Galisteo basin covers approximately 467,200 acres and runs from San Miguel County in the east, across Santa Fe County, and into Sandoval County at its westernmost point, the Rio Grande.\\"Watershed Restoration Action Strategy for the Galisteo Creek Watershed\\" Northeast of Galisteo Basin rise the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and to the southwest lie the Sandia Mountains. Because of its location lying between mountain ranges and connecting the Rio Grande Valley with the Great Plains, the Galisteo Basin was used as a trade route by prehistoric and historic indigenous and later also by the Spanish explorers. Geography The Galisteo Basin drains the southern Sangre de Cristo Mountains, shares its northern drainage divide (height of land) with the Santa Fe Basin and its eastern drainage divide with the Pecos Basin. To the west it is bounded by the Rio Grande, and to the south by the drainage divide with the Estancia Basin, by the Ortiz Mountains. and the drainage divide with the Arroyo de la Vega de la Tanos, which flows off the western slopes of the Ortiz Mountains. =River course= The north fork of the Galisteo River arises in the southern Sangre de Cristo Mountains on the slopes of Thompson Peak and Glorieta Baldy. It includes flow from Grasshopper Canyon Creek, Deer Creek and Apache Canyon Creek. It is joined by the east fork just south of the town of Galisteo. The east fork of the Galisteo River, also known as the San Cristobal Arroyo, flows off of Rowe Mesa and Glorieta Mesa. A major tributary of the east fork is Padre Springs Creek. The south fork joins the river about below the east fork. The south fork of the Galisteo River, also known as the Arroyo de la Jara, drains from the eastern and southern slopes of the basin. Its major contributor is Gaviso Arroyo. After the three fork join together, the river flows northwest for about into the Rio Grande. The tracks of the BNSF railroad run beside the Galisteo River for most of this distance, turning south about 2 miles before the river enters the Rio Grande. After the three fork join together, the river receives flow from the north off the height of land south of the city of Santa Fe, including Gallina Arroyo, San Marcos Arroyo and Canada de la Cueva. From the south it receives flow off the eastside of the Ortiz Mountains from Arroyo la Joya, Arroyo Canamo, Cunningham Creek, and Arroyo Viejo. History The Galisteo Basin has a rich cultural history being a part of Pueblo culture (Eastern Anasazi). It is widely considered one of the most impressive archeological sites in the United States. Most of the sites are currently closed to the public. The most famous Pueblo ruin within the basin is San Cristobal Pueblo. From the 14th to the early 15th century, the pueblos in Galisteo Basin were trade centers. After 1680, the basin was abandoned. Various peoples, known and unknown, inhabited the area, including the Tano (Arizona Tewa), East Rio Grande Keresan, Pecos, and Tewa.

Scifres (born October 8, 1980) is a former American football punter. He played the majority of his career with the San Diego Chargers, and is included on the Chargers 50th Anniversary Team. High school Scifres attended Destrehan High School in Destrehan, Louisiana and lettered in football, soccer, and baseball. In football, he was an All-District selection. Scifres graduated from Destrehan High School in 1998. College years While playing for Western Illinois, Scifres was the only punter from NCAA Div 1-AA (now called the Football Championship Division) to become a 2002 finalist of the Ray Guy Award, given to the nation's top punter. He set a school and conference record with an 89-yard punt against Southwest Missouri State in 2000. Scifres also kicked a game-winning 56-yard field goal in his first career attempt in 1999. Two-time First-team All-American selection by Football Gazette, Three-time All-conference selection, Seven-time National player of the week, and Five-time Conference player of the week. His college nickname was Scabies. He graduated from Western Illinois University with a degree in Communications & Broadcasting. Professional career =San Diego Chargers= 2008. Scifres was selected with the 14th pick of the fifth round of the 2003 NFL Draft out of Western Illinois University. In the Chargers' 2009 Wild Card Playoff versus the Colts, Scifres kicked a 67-yard punt and averaged 51.7 yards with six punts. Also, all his punts during the game were inside the Colts' 20-yard line, with 4 inside their 10-yard line. Perhaps Scifres's best punt of the game was the last, a 52-yard kick launched from the San Diego 47 yard line that bounced out of bounds at the Colts' 1, pinning Indianapolis deep and allowing the Chargers' defense to force the Colts to punt the ball away from the back of their own end zone. Scifres said after the game, \\"I don't know if you can dream a game like this.\\" Scifres also made some clutch punts near the end of the 2007 Chargers' AFC Divisional Playoff Game that pinned the Colts back deep in their own territory and ultimately helped thwart the Colts' QB Peyton Manning's come back attempts. In week 11 against the Denver Broncos Scifres completed his first NFL completion to Mike Tolbert for 28 yards. Scifres boomed his way into the Chargers’ record books in 2012. Already the team’s record-holder for career punting average (45.3), Scifres was voted the team’s Special Teams Player of the Year last season after setting a new team record with an average of 48.3 yards per punt, a mark that shattered the previous high of 46.7, which he set back in 2010. And thanks to the Chargers’ outstanding coverage units, Scifres posted a 40.6-yard net average in 2012, second in the franchise’s 53-year history.https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/players/6485/ In 2014, U-T San Diego wrote that Scifres \\"arguably was the team MVP\\" in a Week 11 win over the Oakland Raiders after he landed punts on the Raiders' own 2-, 4-, 6-, 8- and 12-yard line. In a 23–14 loss in Week 14 to the New England Patriots, he suffered a clavicle fracture on a blocked punt, when his body was twisted mid- air and his shoulder landed hard on the ground.

In 1934 the Dominion of Newfoundland surrendered its constitution to the Crown and ceased to have a legislature in order to be ruled by London through the Commission of Government. The next House of Assembly was not elected until Newfoundland became the tenth province of Canada in 1949, following the 1948 referendum on joining Canadian confederation. As much information as is currently available about the dates of election, number of members returned, and the result by party, is set out below. Newfoundland's party system was subject to frequent changes due to the polarized and often violent elections, so an attempt has been made to explain the relationships between the parties and some brief highlights of political events. History Prior to the province been granted colony status in 1832 Newfoundland had no elected form of government. In the early days after discovery the island was divided into colonies and were administered by individuals authorized to govern proprietary colonies and are likewise called Proprietary governors. The first of these were established in 1610 at Cuper's Cove and was governed by John Guy. Other colonies were soon established and were likewise governed by individuals with keen interest to reap the benefits to its mercantile owners in England. This type of rule had continued until 1728. From 1729 to 1817 Newfoundland was governed by non-resident naval governors. Sir Francis Pickmore became the first resident governor. It was then established that all other governors were required to remain on the island over winter. In 1824 when Newfoundland was granted Colonial status the then governor Sir Thomas Cochrane appointed an advisory council without any real power.Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador, . With the arrival of Dr. William Carson to Newfoundland, who was very familiar with British constitutional law, a concerted effort was made to influence the residents to form Representative Government. Others of prominence such as Patrick Morris, William Thomas, Thomas H. Brooking, Benjamin Bowring, Charles Tricks Bowring and Henry Winton had also joined in to agitate for elected representation with power to govern. Brooking was chosen as chairman of the committee to make representation to the British Parliament in January 1832. On 7 June 1832 a Bill to grant a Representative Assembly to Newfoundland was introduced in the British Parliament. Governor Cochrane returned to Newfoundland in August with the power to call an election and did so on 25 September 1832. However, full responsible government would not be granted until 1855. 1st general election: 1832 : Party composition: Conservative 10, Liberal 5. Total Assembly membership 15. After many years of agitation the British Parliament provided Newfoundland with a local legislature. Unfortunately the ethnic and religious disagreements in the colony, between the predominantly Irish Catholic and British Protestant inhabitants, caused the system to work even less well than in other parts of British North America. 2nd general election: November 1836 : Party composition: Liberal 11, Conservative 4. The elected leaders were dominated by reformers, who were mostly Catholic. The appointed Legislative Council was mostly composed of conservative Protestant merchants. However, the two Houses did not meet, when Chief Justice Henry John Boulton discovered some of the writs from the election were not sealed, and called another election. 3rd general election: May 1837 : Party composition: Liberal 11, Conservative 4. Total Assembly membership 15. A new election was called by Chief Justice Henry John Boulton after he discovered some of the writs from the previous election were not sealed. This was disputed by many Reformers and many did not run for election. However, in this election the Reformers took most of the seats. 4th general election: December 1842 : Party composition unknown. Total membership of the Consolidated Legislature 15 elected and 10 appointed members. The experiment was tried of combining the Assembly and Council in a unicameral legislature. The British Parliament twice extended the term of this legislature. By 1847 the whole system broke down. A bicameral legislature was restored, which continued until 1932. 5th general election: November 1848 : Party composition unknown but divided between a Liberal majority and a Conservative minority. Total Assembly membership 15. Support grew for the introduction of a government responsible to the Assembly, which was being introduced elsewhere in British North America about this time. 6th general election: November 1852 : Party composition: Liberal 9, Conservative 6. Total Assembly membership 15. The campaign for responsible government continued and was accepted by the Colonial Office in London. 7th general election: 7 May 1855 : With this election, Newfoundland becomes the last British colony in North America to achieve responsible government. Party composition unknown but divided between a Liberal majority and a Conservative minority. Total Assembly membership 30. The Liberal leader, Philip Francis Little, became the first Premier of the Colony. The Liberals were a largely Catholic party, which depended on Methodist support to defeat the mostly Anglican Conservative opposition. Little became a Judge in 1858 and the Premiership passed to an older Catholic Liberal, John Kent. 8th general election: 7 November 1859 : Party composition: Liberal 18, Conservative 12. Total Assembly membership 30. Kent's government got in severe difficulties. The Methodists had begun to switch their support to the Conservatives endangering the Liberal majority. Kent, a man with a fiery temper, was on bad terms with the Governor. In 1861 after the Premier accused the Judges of conspiring against his Government, the Governor was delighted to dismiss him. The Conservative leader, Hugh Hoyles, was installed as Premier. As he was in a minority in the Assembly the new Premier requested and got a dissolution. 9th general election: 2 May 1861 : Party composition: Conservative 15, Liberal 13, vacant 2. Total Assembly membership 30. This was the most violent and sectarian election in Newfoundland's history. In one two member electoral district a party of voters going to the polling place were attacked. A relative of one of the candidates was shot dead. Subsequently, there were riots. The returning office later gave sworn evidence that he had only returned two members due to his being threatened. A mob attacked and burnt the returning officers home, a few days later. The Assembly decided not to seat any claimants from the disputed election, although the Conservatives won the subsequent by-election. Shortly before the next election Hugh Hoyles was replaced as Premier by a more conciliatory Conservative, Frederick Carter, who was anxious to reduce sectarian strife and bring some Catholics into the cabinet. 10th general election: 7 May 1865 : Party composition: Conservatives 22, Opposition 8. Total Assembly membership 30. Carter did acquire some Catholic support as the old sectarian alignments broke down. The issue of whether Newfoundland should become a part of Canada caused a realignment. A new Anti-Confederation Party opposed the mostly pro-Confederation Conservatives. The next general election would decide the issue. 11th general election: 13 November 1869 : Party composition: Anti-Confederation 21, Conservative 9. Total Assembly membership 30. The defeat for the Confederation cause was so complete that the Conservatives soon dropped the idea. For many years afterward being called a supporter of Confederation was a political smear. The new Premier was Charles Fox Bennett, a Protestant leader of a mostly Catholic party. All was well so long as the Confederation issue was still dominant, but there was always a risk of sectarian strife reappearing. 12th general election: November 1873 : Party composition: Anti-Confederation 17, Conservative 13. Total Assembly membership 30. The Anti-Confederates led by Charles Fox Bennett won the election and formed the government; a \\"new\\" Conservative party led by Frederick Carter formed the opposition. 13th general election: 7 November 1874 : Party composition: Conservative 17, Anti-Confederation 13. Total Assembly membership 30. The Conservatives decided that the way to win the next election was to take up sectarian issues. The tactic worked at some cost to the islands political stability. Frederick Carter defeats Fox and regains the Premiership. The party system continued to move in the direction of renewed sectarianism. The Anti-Confederation Party faded away and was replaced by a new Liberal Party, as before largely composed of Catholics. In April 1878 Carter was replaced as Conservative Premier by William Whiteway. 14th general election: 4 November 1878 : Party composition: Conservative 21, Liberal 10. Total Assembly membership 31. Whiteway continued in office as Premier. 15th general election: 6 November 1882 : Party composition unknown but divided between a Conservative majority and a Liberal minority. Total Assembly membership 32. Premier Whiteway's support began to splinter. A New Party, based on merchant interests in the capital, broke away. 16th general election: 31 October 1885 : Party composition: Reform 18, Liberal 13, Independent 1. Total Assembly membership: 32 The election was contested by a Reform Party which replaced Whiteway's Conservatives. Sir Robert Thorburn of the Reform Party took over as Premier. The Reform Party campaigned on a policy of not compromising with Catholics. Thorburn broke his election promise by inviting Catholic Liberals to join his government. The Reform and Liberal parties merged, to form a larger Reform Party. Meanwhile, William Whiteway, the former Conservative leader, set up a new party. As the name Liberal was not being used, Whiteway adopted it for his new party. It must therefore be appreciated that the Liberal Party which contested the 15th general election was a different party from the Liberal Party from the 16th general election onwards. 17th general election: 6 November 1889 : Party composition: Liberals 28, Reform 3, Independent 1. Total Assembly membership: 32 William Whiteway began a new Premiership, but he was not as vigorous as he had been in his previous term of office. The Reform Party disappeared and a new Tory Party took over as the opposition to the Liberals. 18th general election: 6 November 1893 : Party composition: Liberal 23, Tory 12, Independent 1. Total Assembly membership 36. Many of the victorious Liberals (and the Independent) had their elections set aside by the Courts. The Premier and his leading supporters were unseated and disqualified from seeking re-election. The Governor appointed the Tory leader, Augustus F. Goodridge, as Premier in 1894. However, as the Liberals kept on winning by-elections Goodridge never had a majority. In December 1894 the interim Liberal leader, Daniel J. Greene, became Premier. In February 1895 he passed a law to lift the electoral disqualification of Whiteway and then resigned in his favour. 19th general election: 28 October 1897 : Party composition: Tory 23, Liberal 13. Total Assembly membership 36. The new Premier was Sir James Spearman Winter. By 1900 the Tory Party had faded out in the way Newfoundland parties quite often seemed to do. 20th general election: 8 November 1900 : Party composition: Liberal 32, Opposition 4. Total Assembly membership 36. Sir Robert Bond of the Liberal Party became Premier. Bond is accounted the best of Newfoundland's Premiers and the early 20th century was one of the rare periods of prosperity in island history. 21st general election: 31 October 1904 : Party composition: Liberal 30, United Opposition 6. Total Assembly membership 36. The so-called United Opposition Party was reinforced when Edward Patrick Morris resigned from Bond's government. Morris founded the Newfoundland People's Party, which became the principal opponent of the Liberals. Newfoundland was recognized as a Dominion of the British Empire (the same status as that of Canada, Australia and New Zealand) in 1907. 22nd general election: 2 November 1908 : Party composition: Liberal 18, People's 18. Total Assembly membership 36. The tied result caused problems. Sir Robert Bond did not feel he could continue with this Assembly, as once his party provided a Speaker they would be in a voting minority. The Governor refused an immediate dissolution, so Bond resigned. Sir Edward Patrick Morris formed a government, but had the same problem as Bond. The Governor granted Morris a dissolution. 23rd general election: 8 May 1909 : Party composition: People's 26, Liberal 10. Total Assembly membership 36. The title of Prime Minister replaced Premier in 1909. 24th general election: 30 October 1913 : Party composition: People's 21, Union 8, Liberal 7. Total Assembly membership 36. William Coaker of the Fishermen's Protective Union decided to set up a political party. The Union (or Unionist) Party entered into an electoral pact with the Liberals. During the First World War, Newfoundland made considerable sacrifices. Newfoundland had no military forces before the War. The islanders built up the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. Appalling casualties on the Western Front made conscription a live issue. The People's Party invited opposition leaders to join a National government. When Sir Edward Patrick Morris resigned in 1918, the Liberal leader William Lloyd was invited to lead the coalition government. Before the 1919 election the Liberal and Union parties linked themselves in the Liberal Reform Party. In May 1919 the People's Party leader, Sir Michael Cashin, moved a motion of no confidence in a ministry he seems to have quit minutes before. The motion passed so Cashin became Prime Minister. 25th general election: 2 November 1919 : Party composition: Liberal Reform 24, People's 12. Total Assembly membership 36. The new Liberal Reform Prime Minister was Sir Richard Squires. The People's Party became the Liberal-Labour-Progressive Party following the election. 26th general election: 2 May 1923 : Party composition: Liberal Reform 23, Liberal-Labour-Progressive 13. Total Assembly membership 36. In this Assembly term leading Minister's were attacked for corruption by a resigning colleague. Squires’ reputation seemed to have been destroyed. William Warren became a Liberal Reform Prime Minister in July 1923. Albert Hickman took over immediately before the 1924 election. Before the next election the Liberal-Reform Party collapsed. Some of its members joined with Albert Hickman as the Liberal-Progressive Party. William Warren was associated with Tories in forming a replacement for the Liberal-Labour-Progressive Party which was named the Liberal-Conservative-Progressive Party. 27th general election: 2 June 1924 : Party composition: Liberal-Conservative-Progressive 25, Liberal-Progressive 10, Other 1. Total Assembly membership 36. The new Prime Minister was Walter Stanley Monroe, a businessman who promoted legislation, which some Newfoundlanders considered unduly benefited the rich. In August 1928 the Prime Ministership was passed to Monroe's cousin Frederick C. Alderdice. The plain businessman's government had become so unpopular that the population was prepared to re-elect Sir Richard Squires, leading the Liberal Party with the support of its Union Party allies. 28th general election: 29 October 1928 : Party composition: Liberal 19, Liberal- Conservative-Progressive 12, Union 9. Total Assembly membership 40. Sir Richard Squires became Prime Minister for the second time with the support of the Union Party. Frederick C. Alderdice re-organized the opposition as the United Newfoundland Party. The Great Depression hit Newfoundland hard. The island had not had a budget surplus since 1919 and had been borrowing to cover budget deficits. Cuts in public expenditure and rising unemployment produced political unrest. In 1932 a demonstration outside the Colonial Building (where the legislature sat) led to a riot. The demonstrators broke into the building. They were prevented from invading the floor of the Assembly, but Squires fled out of a side door and went into hiding for a few days. He lost the general election which followed. 29th general election: 11 June 1932 : Party composition: United Newfoundland 24, Liberal 2, Other 1. Total Assembly membership 27 (reduced from 40 as an economy measure). New Prime Minister Frederick C. Alderdice was not able to rescue the public finances. By this time Newfoundlanders despaired of the ability of their politicians to solve the problems. The British government commissioned William Warrender Mackenzie, 1st Baron Amulree to conduct a study of the situation in Newfoundland. His Amulree Report was scathing about the political culture of Newfoundland. The price of British government financial aid was the abandonment of responsible and representative government. The legislature was dissolved. The Commission of Government came into operation on 16 February 1934 ending more than a century of legislative democracy in Newfoundland.

It is one of the oldest scientific societies in the United States. An independent, nonprofit organization with more than members in 100 countries, the academy's mission is \\"to advance scientific research and knowledge; to support scientific literacy; and to promote the resolution of society's global challenges through science- based solutions\\". The incoming president and CEO is Nicholas Dirks; the current chair of the board of governors of the academy is NYU professor and longtime senior vice president of all research for IBM, Paul Horn. He succeeds Nancy Zimpher, Chancellor, The State University of New York (SUNY). History Founded on January 29, 1817, the New York Academy of Sciences was originally called the Lyceum of Natural History. Convened by the Academy's founder and first President, Samuel L. Mitchill, the first meeting of the Lyceum took place at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, located on Barclay Street near Broadway in lower Manhattan. The principal activities of the early Lyceum focused on hosting lectures, collecting natural history specimens, and establishing a library. In 1823, the Lyceum began publishing its own scientific journal, then the Annals of the Lyceum of Natural History of New York, now the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. By 1826 the Lyceum owned \\"the richest collection of reptiles and fish in the country,\\" however a fire in 1866 destroyed the collection completely. Following the fire, the Academy turned its focus away from collecting and instead to research, scientific publishing, and disseminating scientific information. From the outset, the New York Academy of Sciences membership was unique among scientific societies, with a democratic structure that allowed anyone to become a member, from laymen to respected professional scientists. For that reason, the membership has always included a mix of scientists, business people, academics, those working in government, and public citizens with an interest in science. Prominent members have included two United States Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe, as well as numerous well-known scientists such as Asa Gray (who served as the Superintendent of the Academy starting in 1836), John James Audubon, Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Louis Pasteur, Charles Darwin, and Margaret Mead (who served for a time as the Vice President of the Academy). Prior to 1877, the Academy only admitted men, but on November 5, 1877, they elected Erminnie A. Smith the first female member. Membership has also included numerous Nobel Prize winners over the years. Early Academy members played prominent roles in the establishment of New York University in 1831 and the American Museum of Natural History in 1858. The Academy has made significant contributions to the scientific community during the course of its history, including publishing one of the first studies on environmental pollution in 1876; conducting a scientific survey of Puerto Rico from 1907 to 1934; the first conference on antibiotics on 21 July 1948; hosting an important gathering and publishing the first volume on the cardiovascular effects of smoking in 1960; the founding of a Women in science Committee in 1977; the world's first major scientific conference on AIDS in 1983; and a conference on SARS in 2003. In 2006, the Academy moved into its current home on the 40th floor of 7 World Trade Center.

The film concerns the lives of a group of wealthy young socialites during debutante season in Manhattan. In addition to some of their debutante parties, it covers their frequent informal after-hours gatherings at a friend's Upper East Side apartment, where they discuss life, philosophy and their fate; form attachments, romances and intrigues; and react to an interesting but less well-to-do newcomer. Metropolitan was nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the 63rd Academy Awards.Stillman, Whit. Barcelona & Metropolitan; A Tale of Two Cities. Faber and Faber Ltd. 1994. The film is often considered the first of a trilogy of Stillman films, followed by Barcelona (1994, but written before Metropolitan) and The Last Days of Disco (1998). Plot Middle-class Princeton student Tom Townsend, an admirer of Charles Fourier, attends a debutante dress ball one evening on a whim. After the ball, a mix-up leads to his meeting a small group of young Upper East Side socialites known as the Sally Fowler Rat Pack, after the girl whose apartment they use for after-hours parties. Believing that they accidentally stole a taxi from Tom, they decide to invite him to their after- hours party, to prevent ill feelings. Tom decides to attend the party, and befriends several other attendees, including Nick Smith, a cynic who takes Tom under his wing; Audrey, a shy girl who enjoys Regency era literature and has a crush on Tom; and Charlie, an overly philosophical friend with an unrequited love for Audrey. Tom learns that he and the Rat Pack have some common friends, including his ex-girlfriend Serena Slocum, with whom he remains infatuated. Under Nick's tutelage, Tom ingratiates himself to the Rat Pack and soon becomes a full-fledged member. Much of the film is composed of dialogues in which Tom and the Rat Pack discuss the nebulous social scene they occupy, including how they are coming of age just as the culture in which they were raised is ending, leaving them with uncertain social futures. During these discussions, Tom reveals that he, too, was raised wealthy, but that his father abandoned the family to marry another woman, leaving Tom and his mother with limited financial resources. As a result, Tom harbors a love-hate relationship with wealth and the upper class. Serena has been dating Rick Von Sloneker, a young, titled aristocrat notorious for his womanizing. At a party after the International Debutante Ball, Nick alienates himself from the group by accusing Rick of getting a girl drunk and convincing her to \\"pull a train\\" several years before, after which she committed suicide. Other members of the Rat Pack point out holes in Nick's story. Nick admits that the story was a \\"composite\\" of incidents from Rick's life. Shortly thereafter, Nick leaves Manhattan, giving Tom his top hat as a token of friendship. Believing that Tom is not interested in her romantically, Audrey decides to leave Manhattan to spend the rest of vacation in the Hamptons with Rick and another girl from the Rat Pack. Realizing that he's developed feelings for Audrey, Tom recruits Charlie to help him rescue her from Rick. The two travel to the Hamptons together, bonding en route. Against their expectations, they arrive to find Audrey in no peril. Tom and Charlie nonetheless instigate a fight with Rick, which ends with them being kicked out of his beach house. Afterward, Tom and Audrey talk on the beach, with Audrey saying that she is planning to attend college in France, and Tom contemplating going to visit her there. Tom, Audrey, and Charlie begin hitchhiking together towards Manhattan. Themes Leading commentators such as Emmanuel LevyEmmanuel Levy, Cinema of Outsiders: The Rise of American Independent Film. and Madeleine Dobie have identified the film as a comedy of manners or a coming-of-age story. Suzanne Pucci, in her book Jane Austen and Company, compares the film to Austen's novels and those of Henry James, such as Wings of the Dove.Suzanne Pucci, Jane Austen and Company, p. 3, 2003. For Pucci, the film deserves full membership in the class of 20th- and early 21st-century Austen remakes such as Ruby in Paradise and Bridget Jones's Diary. According to her, the film tracks \\"the Austen phenomenon beyond Austen, into what (is called) the 'post-heritage' film, a kind of historical costume drama that uses the past in a deliberate or explicit way to explore current issues in cultural politics.\\"Suzanne Pucci, Jane Austen and Company, p. 4, 2003. Cast Production Whit Stillman wrote the screenplay for Metropolitan between 1984 and 1988 while running an illustration agency in New York, and financed it by selling his apartment for $50,000 as well as with a few contributions from family members and friends. Including post-production, the total cost of making the film was $210,000. Stillman wanted to set the film in the past, possibly in the pre-Woodstock 1960's, but the budget didn't allow for a strict period film to be made. Instead he added period details to give the film an \\"aura of the past\\", like vintage Checker Cabs, and generally excluded anything too specific to the present day. Reception Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 93% \\"fresh\\" rating from a sample of 40 reviews. The consensus reads, \\"Metropolitan gently skewers the young socialite class with a smartly written dramedy whose unique, specific setting yields rich universal truths.\\" Accolades *Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay *Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature References External links  *Metropolitan: After the Ball an essay by Luc Sante at the Criterion Collection * 2015 40-minute interview featuring Whit Stillman, Carolyn Farina, and Dylan Hundley regarding Metropolitan 1990 films 1990s coming-of-age comedy-drama films American coming-of-age comedy-drama films American films American independent films Films directed by Whit Stillman English-language films Films set in New York (state) Films shot in New York (state) New Line Cinema films Films about the upper class 1990 directorial debut films 1990 independent films ","title":"Metropolitan (1990 film)"},{"id":"3493809","text":"Serra dos Aimorés seen from Nanuque, Minas Gerais Serra dos Aimorés (\\"Botocudo mountain\\") is a mountainous area in eastern Brazil straddling the border between Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais.

Facts Kunqian Catherine Zhu was born on 16 September 2000 in Belfast to Chinese parents who were living in Wales (part of the United Kingdom) and working for a Chinese firm there. The child's mother, Man Lavette Chen, had selected Northern Ireland as a birthplace for her daughter so that she could gain Irish nationality. As Catherine's parents were only temporary migrants in the UK, she was not eligible for British citizenship simply by virtue of birth in the United Kingdom, as the United Kingdom abolished automatic jus soli in 1983. However, by being born in Belfast, Catherine was entitled to Irish citizenship because at that time, anyone born on the island of Ireland had the automatic, unrestricted right to Irish citizenship. Thus, Mrs Chen obtained a passport and hence Irish citizenship for Catherine, with the intention of using Catherine's status as a European Union citizen to move the family permanently to Cardiff, Wales. However, British authorities rejected the family's application for permits to reside permanently in the United Kingdom. On appeal, adjudicator Michael Shrimpton of the Immigration Appellate Authority referred the decision to the European Court of Justice, which ruled that, as a citizen of the European Union, Catherine Chen had a right under Article 18 of the EC Treaty to reside anywhere in the EU, and that denying residency to her parents at a time when she is unable to look after herself would conflict with this basic right. Advocate General Tizzano stated that it was not an abuse of EU rights to take advantage of the Irish citizenship rules because it is for the Member States and not the EU to decide whether to confer citizenship on a person. Judgment The court ruled: Significance This case and similar examples led to the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, making it constitutionally possible in future for the Republic of Ireland to refuse citizenship to individuals who did not have a parent who is Irish, British or living permanently in Ireland.

The Battle of Yatay was the first major land battle of the Paraguayan War, and most important of the war's second phase.  Background  Following the declaration of war by Paraguayan president/dictator Francisco Solano Lopez on Argentina, the Paraguayans immediately attacked with two columns. The original plan was that the first column, commanded by Wenceslao Robles, would seize Corrientes while a second column of 12,000 men, commanded by Antonio de la Cruz Estigarribia, would then advance to the east of Corrientes and capture Brazilian possessions on the Uruguay River. The primary focus of this invasion plan was the capture of Brazilian possessions, as this would prevent Brazilian expansion, a great concern of President Lopez. The other column would then capture Corrientes, distracting Argentine forces and creating a lifeline between Paraguay and the Atlantic Ocean. This plan was later revised so that two-thirds of the assault force would attack Corrientes and later divert southeast and invade Uruguay. In response, a military alliance was signed on 1 May among Argentina, Uruguay and the Empire of Brazil. Following the successful capture of Corrientes, Argentine Gen. Wenceslao Paunero launched a daring attack – on 25 May – that recaptured the city. However, given the enormous numerical superiority of the enemy, he chose to evacuate the city and its civilians two days later and head to the southwest of the province. Only after having evacuated Corrientes did Paunero learn that the Paraguayans were making progress on the Uruguay River. Argentine President Bartolomé Mitre put Gen. Urquiza, governor of the province of Entre Ríos, in charge of facing the Paraguayan column. Urquiza called on his aid Paunero, who had retreated to Esquina. These forces were joined by a battalion of volunteers from Corrientes, led by Col. Desiderio Sosa, who had participated in the reconquest of Corrientes. Many future heroes of the History of Corrientes Province such as Santiago Baibiene and Plácido Martínez, were in that battalion.Castello, Antonio Emilio, Historia de Corrientes, Ed. Plus Ultra, Bs. As., 1991. Meanwhile, the naval Battle of Riachuelo took place. During the course of the battle the Imperial Brazilian fleet destroyed the Paraguayan squadron near the city of Corrientes.Tissera, Ramón,Riachuelo, la batalla que detuvo la marcha de López al Océano, Revista Todo es Historia, No. 46, Buenos Aires, 1971. This loss prevented the Paraguayan column Paraná River from providing support to the forces on the Uruguay River.  Armies  On 5 May, after invading the northwestern province of Corrientes, Gen. Estigarribia sent Col. Pedro Duarte in front of a small advance column to control the bank of the Uruguay River. Duarte took the city of Santo Tome Estigarribia's forces followed up and met him there four days latter. The army then crossed the Uruguay River and entered the province of Rio Grande do Sul, Empire of Brazil. They left behind them the column of Duarte, with more than 3,000 soldiers to defend Uruguay. Combat of São Borja (July 10, 1865): 1º battalion of Brazilian volunteers defending their flag against the Paraguayans (according to a sketch of M. Mynssen). Estigarribia advanced unopposed to the south, taking on São Borja and Itaqui. In the meantime, Estigarribias's column was attacked and partially destroyed on the outskirts of São Borja, in combating Mbuty.Zenequelli, Lilia, Crónica de una guerra, La Triple Alianza. Ed. Dunken, Bs. As., 1997. Some of the Paraguayan forces were stationed in Sao Tome and São Borja while Duarte was heading south. Urquiza ordered Paunero to join him in Concordia, but the leader delayed the completion of Urquiza's orders. On June 4 the troops of Urquiza, who refused to fight the Paraguayans on the grounds of being considered allies against Brazil (which Argentina had frayed relations with), were disbanded. Uruguayan President Gen. Venancio Flores, fresh from his triumph over the white party or \\"blancos\\", marched to join Urquiza with 2,750 men. In addition, the Brazilian forces, commanded by Lt. Col. Joaquim Rodrigues Coelho Nelly, totaling 1,200 men, were heading their way. They met on July 13. At the first meeting Flores was given the Line Cavalry Regiment \\"San Martín\\", with 450 men, plus the artillery squadron East with 140 men. In total, Flores had 4,540 troops—not nearly enough to confront the Paraguayan columns. Flores, Duarte and Estigarribia marched slowly to meet and engage in battle, while Paunero's 3,600 men began a march through swamps and rivers, swiftly crossing the southern province of Entre Rios to join Flores. In addition, 1,400 of Correntina cavalry under Gen. Juan Madariaga joined their forces. Finally, Col. Simeon Paiva, with 1,200 men, followed closely by the column of Duarte. Estigarribia had a chance to destroy all his enemies one by one, but missed. He also disobeyed orders from Lopez, who ordered him to continue on his way to Alegrete:Rosa, José María, La guerra del Paraguay y las montoneras argentinas, Ed. Hyspamérica, 1986. On August 5 he went to Uruguayana and ordered his troops to reorganize and gather supplies. The Brazilian forces of Gen. David Canabarro, too few to attack the column of 5,000 men of Estigarribia, were limited to camp near the city without being attacked by the Paraguayans. On August 2 Duarte occupied the village of San José de Restoration, now the town of Paso de los Libres. A week later he advanced and was defeated, suffering 20 casualties in the Battle of Chap Kish. Given the news that all enemy forces were in pursuit, Duarte sought help from his superior, Gen. Estigarribia, who sent him this answer: Insulted, Duarte was prepared to give battle without any help.León Rebollo Paz, La Guerra del Paraguay. Historia de una epopeya, Bs. As., 1965, pág. 74. On August 13 Paunero avoided the army of Duarte and joined Flores, whose forces then numbered 12,000 men, nearly four times the force of Duarte. Duarte moved away from Paso de los Libres and took positions on the banks of the stream Yatay, near the village. There was a brief encounter on the afternoon of August 16, and at dusk the two armies were facing each other from a half-mile off.  Battle  Map of the Battle of Yatay. Both the Yatay and Uruguay rivers had recently flooded, leaving much of the battlefield underwater. Most Paraguayan infantry forces were entrenched among trees and ditches in the area of the nearby village estates and protected by mud that covered the frontal approach, but the stream behind them made it impossible to retreat in case of a defeat, which was considered very likely by Duarte.Zenequelli, Lilia, op. cit. Duarte's forces consisted of 1,980 infantry and 1,020 cavalry,Zenequelli, op. cit., afirma que contaba en total con 3.200 hombres. with no artillery. The Allies had a total of 5,550 infantry, 5,000 cavalry and 32 pieces of artillery. Among the leaders of the allied army were experienced commanders Flores and Paunero, Lion Palleja, Ignacio Rivas, Enrique Castro and José Gregorio Suárez and Argentines Juan Bautista Charlone, José Miguel Arredondo, José Giribone Ignacio Segovia, Joaquin Viejobueno, Leopoldo Nelson, Simeon Paiva and Madariaga. Defeat of Paraguayans at Yatay. The battle began at 10:00 am, with an early attack on the Paraguayan positions by the Palleja Infantry Division. Duarte seized the opportunity and countered with almost all his cavalry, causing hundreds of casualties and forcing them to retreat. Faced with an increasingly bad situation, the cavalry division of Segovia attacked the Paraguayan cavalry, supported by Castro's eastern and Suarez. For two hours the battle was fought exclusively with cavalry. Duarte ordered a withdrawal maneuver, which finally enabled the allied infantry to go into action, and although their (the allies) numerical superiority was overwhelming, the Paraguayans fought with tenacity. When the battle was almost lost, Duarte tried a desperate cavalry charge, and in the fight his horse was killed. Paunero himself demanded that Duarte surrender, which he finally agreed to do. A final Paraguayan force of infantry under Lt. Zorrilla crossed the Yatay stream and was attacked by a cavalry unit of Suarez and Madariaga, who attacked from the rear. A few hundred Paraguayan soldiers swam the Uruguay River, while the rest were killed or taken prisoner. In total they suffered 1.500 deadRosa, en La Guerra del Paraguay..., basado en fuentes brasileñas, asegura que tuvieron 1.700 muertos; tal vez sumase los 200 uruguayos y argentinos tomados prisioneros, y de los que buena parte fueron fusilados a posteriori por Flores, pero difícilmente lo hayan sido en su totalidad. and 1,600 prisoners, including 300 wounded.  Consequences  Paraguayan soldiers, wounded prisoners of the Battle of Yatai. Among the prisoners, Flores found several dozen soldiers from the Uruguayan Blanco Party, supporters who had taken refuge in Paraguay who tried to wrest power in Uruguay from the hands of Flores' forces. He ordered their execution as traitors.Also ordered the execution of some soldiers federal Argentines, not recognized national authority Mitre, who had won three years ago by a rebellion against the Confederation Argentina. Gavier Diaz, op. cit., p. 38. On September 18, after having assured the representatives of the Brazilian Emperor that he would not surrender and would rather be buried under the rubble of Uruguay, Gen. Estigarribia surrendered with little resistance. Soon afterwards, the Paraguayan forces occupying the abandoned city of Corrientes retreated to the north, and soon moved on to Paraguay. Almost all of the war following was fought in Paraguayan territory until the country's complete defeat in 1870, which resulted in the loss of 70% of the country's adult male population.

In ruminants, the gut fermentation of ingested plant materials liberates phytol, a constituent of chlorophyll, which is then converted to phytanic acid and stored in fats. In shark liver it yields pristane. Human pathology Refsum disease, an autosomal recessive disorder that results in the accumulation of large stores of phytanic acid in tissues, frequently manifests peripheral polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, anosmia, and hearing loss. Although humans cannot derive phytanic acid from chlorophyll, they can convert free phytol into phytanic acid. Thus, patients with Refsum disease should limit their intake of phytanic acid and free phytol. The amount of free phytol in numerous food products has been reported. Roles in nature Insects, such as the sumac flea beetle, are reported to use phytol and its metabolites (e.g. phytanic acid) as chemical deterrents against predation. These compounds originate from host plants. Indirect evidence has been provided that, in contrast to humans, diverse non-human primates can derive significant amounts of phytol from the hindgut fermentation of plant materials. Modulator of transcription Phytol and/or its metabolites have been reported to bind to and/or activate the transcription factors PPAR-alpha and retinoid X receptor (RXR). The metabolites phytanic acid and pristanic acid are naturally occurring ligands. In mice oral phytol induces massive proliferation of peroxisomes in several organs. Geochemical biomarker Phytol is likely the most abundant acyclic isoprenoid compound present in the biosphere and its degradation products have been used as biogeochemical tracers in aquatic environments.

It is located on the Maesteg Line from Cardiff via Bridgend. Passenger services are operated by Transport for Wales Rail as part of the Valley Lines network for local services. History The station was opened by the Llynvi Valley Railway on 25 February 1864. Originally developed as part of the Duffryn Llynvi and Porthcawl Railway, it was a junction of six railway lines: *The Duffryn Llynvi and Porthcawl Railway from Porthcawl to Maesteg and *The Maesteg Line to Bridgend, connecting to the South Wales Main Line *The Ogmore Valley Railway to Brynmenyn & Nantymoel *The Port Talbot Railway and Docks Company to Port Talbot docks and Pontyrhyl *The Garw Valley Railway to Blaengarw and onwards to the Blaengarw and International collieries Coal train from the Ogmore Valleys passing Tondu in 1962 It hence had an extensive set of railway workshops, and was also the junction access point for the Tondu Ironworks. Enough traffic flowed through the junction to warrant a sizable locomotive shed. The original Ogmore Valley Railway shed was demolished in 1889 to make way for a roundhouse shed, which later became home to various Great Western Railway allocated tank engines.https://www.flickr.com/photos/taffytank/6955608730/ The ironworks shut from 1895 onwards, but the previous developments meant that it remained an important junction with the installation of a wagon works for the collieries in the area. After British Railways closed most of the branch lines to passengers in the 1950s and early 1960s and the demise of the Blaengarw and International collieries in the late 1980s, the station and lines were greatly rationalised. The locomotive shed closed in the late-sixties. Tondu station was closed on 22 June 1970 (with the end of passenger trains over the old L&O; route to Cymmer Afan) and was reopened on 28 September 1992. British Rail and Mid Glamorgan County Council reopened the line. Arriva Trains Wales 150252 passes the Tondu Junction signal box with a service to . The current passing loop is still controlled by the former Tondu junction signal box, which manually controls the line using semaphore signals. As well as the former Maesteg Line, the former Port Talbot Railway and Docks Company line exists as a freight-only by-pass line to Margam. Passenger trains would sometimes be diverted through this branch-line whenever the main-line between Bridgend and Port Talbot was closed for engineering work. Trains were diverted to travel via and reverse at Tondu.https://www.flickr.com/photos/123410911@N03/16059618079/ Nowadays, when the main-line is closed, bus services will replace train services as the old branch has speed restrictions of 5-15 mph in force.

It prescribes changes to Excise Duties, Value Added Tax, Income Tax, Corporation Tax, and Capital Gains Tax. It enacts the 2004 Budget speech made by Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. In the UK, the Chancellor delivers an annual Budget speech outlining changes in spending, tax and duty. The respective year's Finance Act is the mechanism to enact the changes. The rules governing the various taxation methods are contained within the various taxation Acts. (For instance Capital Gains Tax Legislation is contained within Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. The Finance Act details amendments to be made to each one of these Acts. Notable changes in the 2004 Act included changes to the taxation of UK pensions and provisions to reduce avoidance of inheritance tax. Pensions Taxation One of the main changes introduced by the Act was a change in the taxation of UK pensions from 6 April 2006. Prior to the change many different taxation regimes applied to pension schemes depending on the type of scheme. The changes introduced a single taxation regime. The principle of the new regime is that a pension fund will be tax-free provided it is below the life time allowance (which was set at £1.5m for the year from 6 April 2006). A second restriction was imposed limiting the maximum annual contribution into a pension scheme. Although the new regime is simpler, the need to provide transitional arrangements for pension scheme members whose existing entitlements exceed the new limits resulted in the actual implementation being extremely complex. Inheritance tax The Act also introduced an income tax regime known as pre-owned asset tax which aims to reduce the use of common methods of inheritance tax avoidance.REV BN 40: Tax Treatment Of Pre-Owned Assets Section 4 The Finance Act 2004 (Duty Stamps) (Appointed Day) Order 2006 (S.I. 2006/201 (C. 3) was made under sections 4(5) and (6).

American Civil Liberties Union, 535 U.S. 564 (2002), was a United States Supreme Court case involving the American Civil Liberties Union and the United States government regarding the Child Online Protection Act (COPA).Ashcroft v. Am. Civil Liberties Union, . The unconstitutionality of the law was ultimately upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, while earlier injunctions against the law by that same court were at first dismissed by but later upheld by the Supreme Court. Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (2002) dealt with a similar law, the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA).. COPA was Congress's second attempt to criminalize the Internet distribution of what it considered pornography, including simulated pornography and artwork. COPA enforced penalties of a $50,000 fine and six months in prison for the posting for \\"commercial purposes\\" of content on the internet that is \\"harmful to minors\\".. Background In 1996 Congress created the Communications Decency Act, (CDA) as part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. The CDA prohibited the use of the internet to purposely send indecent material to those under 18 years of age. In June 1997, the Supreme Court unanimously struck down the anti-indecency provisions of the CDA in Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, because in the CDA the internet was held to the same standards as broadcast media. The court held that because the internet is less \\"invasive\\" than broadcast media, the same rules could not apply to the two entities. Despite this ruling, however, the court agreed that the government does have a responsibility to protect minors from obscene/indecent internet content. =Child Online Protection Act= Congress's second attempt to answer to this was the Child Online Protection Act (COPA) of 1998, an amendment to the Communications Act of 1934. COPA made it illegal for any commercial sources to allow minors access to \\"harmful\\" content, drawing on language from the landmark Miller v. California case to better define the term \\"obscenity.\\" Material that is \\"harmful to minors\\" was defined as: > any communication, picture, image, graphic image file, article, recording, > writing, or other matter of any kind that is obscene or that-- > :(A) the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would > find, taking the material as a whole and with respect to minors, is designed > to appeal to, or is designed to pander to, the prurient interest; > :(B) depicts, describes, or represents, in a manner patently offensive with > respect to minors, an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, an > actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual act, or a lewd exhibition of > the genitals or post-pubescent female breast; and > :(C) taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or > scientific value for minors.\\". Opponents of COPA argued that child pornography is already illegal, and COPA would not be effective because it would waste too much time going after individual sites within the US which could simply set up shop overseas if shut down. It was also argued that COPA would infringe upon rights of adults to receive non-pornographic/harmful messages, and that COPA was not the least invasive or most efficient way to protect children from harmful online content. =Procedural history= On February 1, 1999, Judge Lowell A. Reed Jr. of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granted a preliminary injunction blocking COPA enforcement.Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Reno, The ruling was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In 2000, the Third Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction against COPA because they deemed it impossible to apply \\"contemporary community standards\\" to the internet.Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft, This decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari.Ashcroft v. Am. Civil Liberties Union, . First Supreme Court decision In May 2002, the Supreme Court affirmed the injunction and remanded the case back to the Third Circuit, ruling that using community standards would cause more harm than good. COPA should be enjoined because the statute likely violates the first amendment. There are less restrictive alternatives to COPA. Blocking and filtering software are less restrictive. Filters impose selective restrictions on speech at the receiving end, not universal restrictions at the source. Childless adults can access information they have a right to see without having to identify themselves. Adults with children may turn off their filters to access material they wish to view. Congress passed two more less restrictive alternatives to COPA: the prohibition of misleading domain names and the minor safe \\"dot-kids\\" domain name. Blocking and filtering software also blocks all pornography (40% of content deemed harmful to minors comes from overseas). =Dissenting opinions= A large portion of the opinion of this brief involved the opinions of those who dissent from the decision the court has made, or who disagree with it. Several justices in this case filed opinions concurring in the judgment, and for many different reasons. Several justices joined in disagreement with the court's decision to invoke an injunction on the Child Online Protection Act. They argued that Congress could not have possibly achieved its statutory objective in another, less restrictive way, that COPA did not impose a large amount of limits on free speech, and that the Act was tailored to fit a compelling interest . The reasons they give are as follows: Filters are among the suggested methods of using less restrictive means to protect minors from \\"harmful\\" content. However, currently-available filtering technology is lacking in several different ways: # Filtering is faulty. It allows some harmful material to get through because filters use a system of matching key words and phrases, and lack the capability to distinguish between images that are deemed \\"obscene\\" and those that are not. # In this same sense, filters lack precision. They block out some valuable material along with the harmful material deemed \\"obscene\\". An example of this given in Justice Breyer's dissent is the ACLU informing Congress during a hearing that filtering software \\"blocks out valuable and protected information, such as information about the Quaker religion, and web sites including those of the American Association of University Women, and the AIDS Quilt. This is an extreme weakness of filters, something that will probably be used in arguments against them until, and if, new technology is developed that is able to define and deem what is \\"obscene\\" and what is not. #It is not possible for a parent to control filters on all computers, and the likelihood of a minor to simply use a different computer without a filter on it is extremely high. This is the problem with filtering content at the user end, and not at the source. It is impossible to enforce parental monitoring of their children. Justice Breyer uses an example illustrating that # Filtering software costs money. Justice Breyer then argues a second point: The court had decided that the Act was not narrowly tailored to fit Congress's \\"compelling interest\\", or its intended objective. This means that the court deemed that COPA included too large a scope of regulated content to be determined constitutional under the First Amendment, and in turn it was not capable of achieving Congress's goal of protecting minors from harmful online content. Justice Breyer argues the contrary. In Justice O'Connor's concurrence, she says that the Act as \\"properly interpreted\\" imposes \\"only a modest burden on protected speech\\". She uses the Miller v. California case to highlight this. Comparing the Miller precedent's definition of what is deemed legally obscene, she shows how COPA's terminology is extremely similar to that of the Miller case. She argues that \\"the only significant difference between the present statute and Miller's definition consists of the addition of the words \\"with respect to minors\\", and \\"for minors\\", and that this broadens the Act's scope only slightly. She also argues that the Act was tailored to fit a compelling interest, and that the use of \\"alternative\\" and \\"less restrictive\\" regulation such as filters was not tailored to fit a compelling interest, and she in fact argued that filters are the \\"status quo\\". She argues that filters, as they are readily available now, do not further Congress's goals in any way, and in turn do not pursue a compelling interest. Sticking with the \\"status quo\\" is always easier, but it does not further the goal, and it only allows the problem to perpetuate. She gives the example of \\"despite the present existence of filtering software, children are still gaining access to harmful material\\". She says that the court should not have asked whether the Act uses the least restrictive means possible to protect minors from harmful content, but whether it advances Congress's goals? She concluded that COPA does not enact major burdens on free speech when it is properly interpreted. That it \\"significantly helps to achieve a compelling congressional goal, protecting children from exposure to commercial pornography\\". And that there is no \\"practically available, less restrictive way similarly to further this compelling interest.\\" Second Supreme Court decision In October 2002, the Third Circuit heard the case a second time. In March 2003, the Third Circuit again upheld the injunction.Am. Liberties Union v. Ashcroft, The Supreme Court granted certiorari again,Ashcroft v. Am. Civil Liberties Union, . and in June 2004 the Court reaffirmed the original preliminary injunction.. Subsequent developments The case was remanded to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and went to trial in October 2006. In March 2007, a permanent injunction was granted. The case was appealed to the Third Circuit, which upheld the permanent injunction in July 2008. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court for a third time, but the Court denied certiorari in January 2009,. effectively striking COPA from the United States code, with the law never having taken effect.

It premiered at the Criterion on 2 June 1948 starring Yvonne Arnaud and produced by Hugh Beaumont; it was a smash hit, running for two years. Clement Attlee saw the play while he was Prime Minister. Sydney Box bought the film rights while head of Gainsborough Pictures. The film starred John McCallum and Googie Withers, who had just gotten married. \\"We think, it Is an excellent idea to work together,\\" said John. It was the first of a three-picture contract Withers signed with Sydney Box. The job of directing was given to Ralph Thomas, who had just made two comedies for Box, Once Upon a Dream and Helter Skelter. John McCallum came down with jaundice during filming and had to take a week off. This caused filming to be suspended for a week, costing the production £12,000. However the film was completed half a day under schedule. Release Under the terms of the film right contracts, the movie of Traveller's Joy was not allowed to be released until the play finished running. This held up release for over two years.

It is a being of pure hatred, anger and greed, and requires the fear of its victims to survive. It exists in the minds of its victims and can transmit itself telepathically, although it can also physically manifest as a giant snake. It is so evil that it cannot bear the sight of its own reflection. In the Dark Places of the Inside, it manifests as phantoms such as Dukkha (played by Jeff Stewart), Anatta (played by Anna Wing), and Annica (played by Roger Milner). The Mara was created on the planet Manussa in the Scrampus system, turning the Manussan empire into the Sumaran empire. Eventually the Mara was defeated and driven out by a Manussan (the ancestor of the future Manussan Federator) and cast into the \\"dark places beyond\\". However, it survived. In Kinda, the Fifth Doctor, Nyssa, Tegan and Adric encountered the Mara on the planet Deva Loka. When Tegan fell asleep near the wind chimes on Deva Loka, she became possessed by the Mara. It soon left her and possessed a native Kinda named Aris, who began to stir up the normally peaceful Kinda against an expedition of human colonists who were also present on Deva Loka. The Doctor was able to prevent the humans detonating a bomb which would have destroyed their dome and killed many Kinda, and managed to trap the Mara in a circle of mirrors. As the Mara could not bear to see its own reflection, it was driven out to the Dark Places of the Inside. In Snakedance, Tegan became possessed by the Mara once again. She then navigated the TARDIS to Manussa, where a ceremony was to be held to mark the 500th anniversary of the banishment of the Mara. Using Tegan and a young Manussan named Lon, the Mara tried to obtain the \\"great crystal\\" with which it hoped to restore its corporeal existence. The Doctor was guided by Dojjen, an old mystic who showed him how to find the \\"still point\\". When the Mara tried to make its return at the ceremony, the Doctor concentrated his thought with a small replica of the great crystal, and by finding the still point was able to repel the Mara. Then by grabbing the great crystal, the Doctor broke the Mara's hold over its controlled victims, and destroyed its new snake body. This time, the Mara had apparently been permanently destroyed. Unfortunately, it turns out that the Mara has retreated deeper into Tegan's mind. The Mara is revisited in the 2010 audio story The Cradle of the Snake, when it erupts in Tegan yet again. The Doctor, Tegan, Nyssa and Turlough search for a cure on Manussa, but hundreds of years in its past, when it was still an industrialized civilization. The Mara moves beyond Tegan and finally manages to possess both Nyssa and the Doctor, before finally being destroyed through an array of cameras and televisions. In the Torchwood episode \\"Small Worlds\\", Jack speculates that \\"fairies\\" may be \\"part Mara\\". However, his noting of \\"Mara\\" as the origin of the word \\"nightmare\\" and their ability to steal the breath from their victims suggests that he is referring to the Mara of Germanic/Scandinavian mythology rather than the Manussan Mara. Christopher Bailey, writer of Snakedance and Kinda, was a practising Buddhist and named Doctor Who's Mara after the Buddhist demon Mara. The two names share a common Proto-Indo-European root. The Mara was mentioned by the Tenth Doctor in the 2007 Children in Need special \\"Time Crash\\". The Mara also appears in the final story in the 2014 anthology Tales of Trenzalore, when it possesses some of the inhabitants of the town of Christmas and forces them to dig up the remains of Jalen Fellwood so it can use them to get a new body. The Doctor manages to defeat the Mara by filling the snow machine with salt, something that Fellwood believed held magical properties. Because the Mara draws power from this belief, it ends up being destroyed.

When the current station opened with the restoration of passenger services in 1992 by British Rail, there was much local debate whether to call the station 'Troedyrhiw Garth' once more because of the potential confusion with Garth Railway Station on the Heart of Wales Line in Powys. Upon opening on 28 September 1992 the new station was named simply Garth. Service Passenger services are operated by Transport for Wales as part of the Valley Lines commuter rail network.

Created under the Pensions Act 2004, the regulator replaced the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA) from 6 April 2005 and has wider powers and a new proactive and risk-based approach to regulation. The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority was established by the Pensions Act 1995 and came into full operation on 6 April 1997. It replaced the Occupational Pensions Board as the regulator of occupational pensions in the UK.Whitaker's Almanack; 1998; p. 331 The Pensions Regulator has a clear set of objectives: * to protect members’ benefits * to reduce the risk of calls on the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) * to promote, and to improve understanding of, the good administration of work- based pension schemes * to maximise employer compliance with automatic enrolment duties; * to minimise any adverse impact on the sustainable growth of an employer (in relation to the exercise of TPR’s functions under Part 3 of the Pensions Act 2004 only). To meet these objectives The Pensions Regulator employs a risk-based approach, concentrating its resources on schemes which pose the greatest risk to the security of members’ benefits. The regulator also promotes high standards of scheme administration and works to ensure that those involved in running pension schemes have the necessary skills and knowledge. David Norgrove was appointed the first chair of The Pensions Regulator in January 2005. After 2 terms, he was replaced by Michael O'Higgins in January 2011. Mark Boyle became Chair in 2014 and was reappointed for a second term . Lesley Titcomb became chief executive in March 2015 and was replaced by Charles Counsell in April 2019. More information about the TPR board can be found here. Recent high profile cases Following the January 2018 collapse of construction and services company Carillion with extensive pension liabilities, The Pension Regulator faced calls that it should be scrapped and replaced by a new, more powerful body. The \\"excoriating\\" final report of the Parliamentary inquiry into the collapse of Carillion, published on 16 May 2018, described TPR as \\"feeble\\": In June 2018, TPR's non-executive chairman, Mark Boyle, accepted the MPs' criticism but said the organisation's culture had changed to become clearer, quicker and tougher in its dealings with employers and pensions trustees. On 25 June 2018, TPR announced it was considering issuing a contribution notice – a legally enforceable demand for a financial contribution to the pension deficit – against former Carillion directors. TPR is using its powers more often and testing powers it has not used previously. In the courts, it has brought prosecutions against 23 individuals or organisations in 2017-2019 for failure to provide information, wilful noncompliance with automatic enrolment duties and recklessly providing false or misleading information to TPR, fraud and compute misuse. In 2018, TPR engaged with a range of schemes that they were concerned were at risk of contagion as a result of the collapse of Carillion. It made use of available intelligence to target schemes covering liabilities of £85.5bn and more than 800,000 members. In cases where TPR has initiated anti-avoidance action by issuing a Warning Notice it has recovered more than £1bn, often through the use of settlement, avoiding a costly litigation process. In February 2017, TPR agreed a cash settlement worth up to £363 million with Sir Philip Green in relation to the BHS pension scheme. The arrangement, which gained the support of the trustees of the two BHS pension schemes, provided funding for a new independent pension scheme to give pensioners the option of the same starting pension as they were originally promised by BHS, and higher benefits than they would get from the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). In December 2018, it was announced Southern Water will pay more money into its pension scheme over a shorter recovery period following an investigation by TPR. TPR took action over what it felt was an imbalance between the funds contributed to the Southern Water Pension Scheme and the level of dividends paid to shareholders in 2016 and 2017. In June 2017, TPR agreed a £74 million settlement for a third defined benefit (DB) pension scheme as part of its anti-avoidance investigation into thread manufacturer Coats Group Plc (Coats).  TPR's new approach  Through its TPR Future programme, TPR has completed a review of its entire approach to regulation and has started to implement a new regulatory model to drive up standards and tackle risk by engaging proactively with a larger proportion of the schemes and employers it regulates. TPR's 'Making workplace pensions work' publication is a guide to its new way of operating.

Clematis virginiana L. var. missouriensis (Rydb.) Palmer & Steyermark ) is a vine of the Ranunculaceae (buttercup family) native to North America from Newfoundland to southern Manitoba down to the Gulf of Mexico. The rationale for some of the common names is unclear, as they include examples normally applied to unrelated plants, including twining parasites (e.g. \\"devil's hair\\" for Cuscuta). The name \\"Love Vine\\" also is applied to alleged aphrodisiacs, such as Caribbean species of Cassytha, which are unrelated to Clematis, not being in the family Ranunculaceae. Description This plant is an aggressively growing vine which can climb to heights of by twisting leafstalks. The leaves are opposite and pinnately compound, trifoliate (3 leaflets) that have coarse unequal teeth on the margins. It produces small dull white flowers of width from July to September that are faintly sweetly fragrant; normally dioecious so that there are separate staminate (male) and pistillate (female) plants. The male plants are a little showier in flower and don't bear seed. The dry fruit is an achene with long hair as silvery gray feathery plumes attached in late August into November. It grows on the edges of the woods, moist slopes, fence rows, in thickets and on streambanks. It grows in full sun to light full shade and is very adaptable to many soils from sandy to clay, dry to draining wet, and acid to alkaline with pH range of 6.0 to 8.5. It has a deep but sparse, fibrous root system that makes it hard to transplant.(2.) Good for USDA hardiness zones of 3 to 8. Virgin's Bower is not commonly planted in gardens and landscapes in most places. It is sold by a good number of native plant nurseries and some specialty and large conventional nurseries. What is usually sold at most every conventional nursery or garden center is the similar sweetautumn clematis, Clematis terniflora, from Japan that is much more rampant growing, that bears heavier clouds of white flowers with a stronger fragrance, that has simple leaves not compound with 3 leaflets, that as one plant self-sows around a lot, and becomes an invasive plant when escaping cultivation in North America. It is a larval host of the clematis clearwing moth.https://bugguide.net/node/view/34780 References =Further reading= virginiana Vines Flora of North America Plants described in 1755 Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Clematis virginiana"},{"id":"3494064","text":"The Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO EC) () is the highest executive body of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and acts as the government of the State of Palestine.Abbas confirms resignation from PLO Executive Committee .

He was the editor-in-chief of The Washington Times from 1992 until his retirement in 2008.  Early life  Pruden was born in 1935 in Little Rock, Arkansas, his family having lived in the state for several generations. His father, James Wesley Pruden, Sr. (1908-1979), was a Southern Baptist minister, the pastor of the Grace Baptist Church, and a radio evangelist. Some of his sermon titles are \\"Why I Became a Baptist After Preaching for the Nazarenes for Ten Years\\", \\"Why Every Baptist Should Get Drunk Once\\", and \\"Who's in Hell\\".\\"Dr. Wesley Prudent Will Lead Revival at Local Church\\", Minden Herald, Minden, Louisiana, June 1, 1951, p. 1 The senior Pruden was also the president of the Little Rock chapter of the White Citizens' Council,\\"James Wesley Pruden (1908–1979)\\" by Terry D. Goddard, The Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture, accessed January 1, 2012. a segregationist group that battled integration throughout the 1950s and 1960s.  Newspaper career  Pruden's first job in the newspaper business was in 1951 when, as a tenth grade student at Little Rock Central High School, he worked nights as a copyboy at the since defunct Arkansas Gazette, where he later became a sportswriter and an assistant state editor. After high school, he attended a two-year college, Little Rock Junior College, now incorporated into the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. In 1956, he began working at the Commercial Appeal in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1963, he joined the National Observer, a national weekly published by Dow Jones & Co., for which he covered national politics and the civil rights movement. In 1965, he was assigned to cover the Vietnam War. For the next decade, he was a foreign correspondent, based in Saigon, Hong Kong, Beirut, and London. The National Observer ceased publication in 1977. Between 1976 and 1982, Pruden worked on a novel, a satire for which he could not find a publisher. In 1982, he joined the Washington Times, four months after the paper began, as chief political correspondent. He became assistant managing editor in 1983, managing editor in 1985, and editor- in-chief in 1992. He retired in January 2008, and became editor-in-chief- emeritus. He continued to write a twice-weekly column on politics and national affairs for The Times. Pruden is known for his coverage of President Ronald Reagan about whom he wrote: \\"When Ronald Reagan speaks, the people never hear the politician saying, 'blah blah blah.' They hear a man who talks like they do, saying things that sound like common sense. Such is the essence of the 'Reagan mystique,' the aura of power that has carried the nation along with the man who is arguably the most effective president since Franklin D. Roosevelt.\\" In 1991, he won the H.L. Mencken Prize for excellence in writing and commentary.Menckeniana. Spring 1992. No. 121. Under Pruden's editorship, every Saturday The Washington Times ran a full page of stories on the American Civil War, the only daily newspaper in the United States to do so.\\"The Washington Times Pushes Extremist, Neo-Confederate Ideas\\" by Heidi Beirich and Bob Moser, Intelligence Report, Summer 2003, Issue Number: 110, Southern Poverty Law Center. Note: Other newspapers, particularly in the South, ran the weekly feature, \\"This Was the Civil War\\", between 1961 and 1965 to commemorate the centennial of the conflict. Pruden called it \\"probably our single most popular feature\\", and noted that \\"There are more books published on the Civil War than on any other American topic.\\" Pruden said that \\"the Civil War page has just as many stories about glorifying the Union as it does the Confederacy.\\" Soon after Pruden retired as editor-in-chief, the Times announced that the Civil War page would be expanded to include coverage of all America's wars and would be renamed \\"America at War.\\"Announcement Washington Times, 2008-05-31  Controversies  Pruden's retirement from his position as Editor-in-Chief of The Washington Times in 2008 was widely seen as involuntary. The Columbia Journalism Review describes him as having been \\"pushed out amid allegations that he allowed racism to fester in the newsroom.\\"The Washington Times takes a giant step—backwards by Mariah Blake, Columbia Journalism Review, 2013-02-11 On November 17, 2009, Pruden published an opinion piece in The Washington Times titled \\"Obama bows, the nation cringes,\\" where he set forth his thoughts on what he considered President Obama's breaches of etiquette committed on his tour of Asia, such as bowing to Emperor Akihito of Japan. In the article, he expressed the opinion that since President Obama was \\"sired by a Kenyan father, born to a mother attracted to men of the Third World and reared by grandparents in Hawaii,\\" he \\"has no natural instinct or blood impulse for what [America] is about.\\"Obama bows, the nation cringes Washington Times, 2009-11-17 A number of commentators criticized the column as racist.Political Animal column by Steve Brenan, Washington Monthly, Dec. 17, 2009.\\"Pruden: Obama lacks \\"blood impulse\\" for what America \\"is about\\" due to \\"Kenyan father,\\" \\"mother attracted to men of the Third World\\" Media Matters for American, Nov. 16, 2009. In 2013, Pruden returned to The Washington Times as part of \\"a wide-ranging shakeup\\" following the death of Reverend Sun Myung Moon, the newspaper's founder.

Usually abbreviated to T.Y., Teyateyaneng takes its name from the two twin rivers which run on the north (Tebe-tebe River) and the South (Teja-tejana River). Both rivers lead to the Mohokare, or the Caledon River which forms the western boundary with South Africa. They are both named for their vast quantities of sand which means rapid dipping of feet as one crosses them, leading to both names which may well suggest that this is a 'place of quick sands'.Teyateyaneng's name therefore comes from the southern Teja-tejana River, but the name later changed to Teyateyaneng, perhaps due to British influences as the country became a Protectorate in the late 1800s. The town is situated approximately 400 KM south of Johannesburg, 184 KM east of Bloemfontein, and 517 KM west of Durban, all major metros in the neighbouring South Africa. r Lesotho Embassy in Rome Teyateyaneng is also the camptown for the district of Berea. In 2005 it had a population of 75,115. Geography Teyateyaneng is located about 40 kilometers north east of the national capital of Maseru on the Main North I highway, a road that runs parallel to the South African border leading to the northern town of Butha-Buthe. The city is situated on a high plateau at about 1600 meters altitude. History Teyateyaneng was founded in 1886 as the capital of Berea by then Chief Gabasheane Masupha, one of the sons of the nation's founder King Moshoeshoe I. The town is the birthplace of many famous Basotho including the late former Prime Minister Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle, renowned musicians Tshepo Tshola and Sechaba 'Fatere' Litabe, and more recently; accomplished broadcasters such as J-Tagg Tsiame. Economy Teyateyaneng has several retail businesses and carpet- producing and tapestry factories, though with little industrial activity overall, perhaps owing to its close proximity to a larger Maseru. The town has remained the country's athletic, art and entertainment capital with many events being setup here regularly. Sports =Football= Lioli player The Lioli Football Club is one of the country's biggest football brands. The club was founded and is based in Teyateyaneng since 1934. In 1985 the team won the national league championship for the first time, but the club's most successful era was in the 2010s when it won league championships in 2009, 2013, 2015, and 2016. The club also won the Lesotho Independence Cup in 1984, 2007, 2010, 2014, and 2016, as well at the Top 8 Cup numerous other times in the modern era. The team also came second in the league two times in row in the 2016–17, and 2017–18 seasons. Unlike many other growing western lowlands towns that have seem an emergence of privately owned clubs over the years, the people of Teyateyaneng have rallied behind the club through the years, taking pride in the iconic identity of the club whose name is synonymous with the town's founding Chief Masupha's regiment \\"Lioli\\", named after the red hawk. The club arguably boasts the largest active fan base in Lesotho's premier league today. =Cricket= The town has proven to be an athletic powerhouse of Lesotho over the years, producing prolific footballers who have represented Lesotho internationally at different levels. In the late 1990s as the country revived the Cricket sports, Teyateyaneng further produced many players who rose through high school competitions to represent the country at all levels since. Earlier players included the likes of all-rounders Ts'epo 'Muso, Seisa Tsiame, and Ts'epo Lephema among others, before another generation of players such as Leokaoke Lebona, batsman Thabang Mafereka, and pace bowlers Ian Osler and Thabiso Mohapi emerged. Other sporting disciplines are played at a school level, but football and cricket remain the town's largest sporting quotes. Points of interest Teyateyaneng as a district capital has multiple schools, a district referral hospital and several recreational and tourism facilities such as hotels, lodges and cafes. The town is also surrounded by several rock caves with cave paintings of the Khoi San tribes that once occupied the place centuries ago before the Basotho people migrated south to settle in the Mohokare River valley, before ultimately becoming an organized state with inhabitants going further to occupy the mountainous terrain to the east and the south of what is the present day Lesotho. The town's friendly close-knit community is always willing to accompany tourists on many hiking trails at request. The town is much closer to the country's eastern highlands compared to many of its lowlands neighbours and offers interesting mountain side settlements and cattle posts hiking trails in the east.

The telescope supports a 1024x1024 HAWAII-1 based HgCdTe infrared camera operating between 0.8 and 2.5 µm. This camera is capable of direct imaging in an 8.5 x 8.5' (2.5 x 2.5 mrad) field with 0.5\\" (2.4 µrad) pixels as well as polarimetry and grism spectroscopy.

Plot When he is forced to vacate the office of his debt-ridden correspondence college, 'Professor' Will Davis (Will Hay) goes to the Ministry of International Commerce at Whitehall in order to confront his one-and-only student, PR man Bobby Jessop (John Mills). To get Davis off his back, Jessop proposes to get him a job at Whitehall. Jessop then leaves in order to fetch a Professor Davys at the railway station. The professor is a leading economist who has returned from a long stay in South America in order to advise the British government on a trade treaty with the South American nations, which could be crucial to Britain's war effort. The clueless Davis is mistaken for the expert and gets involved in a series of interviews, giving answers based on gambling, con jobs, double entendres or just plain ignorance. These scenes are very funny and are made more so by the reactions of an increasingly incredulous Joss Ambler as government minister 'Sir John'. Jessop later returns with 'Professor Davys' and the confusion is sorted out, though it has left the BBC interviewers in a state of mental collapse. Jessop then discovers that the man he brought with him is in fact Crabtree (Felix Aylmer), a member of a group of fifth columnists working for Nazi Germany. Jessop promises Davis a job if he will help him track down the real Professor Davys (Henry Hewitt), who is being held in a safe house by Crabtree's associates. Assuming a number of disguises, Davis and Jessop set off to foil the plot before the treaty is compromised.

It is situated in the quieter far eastern region of the national park and reaches a height of 696 metres (2,283 feet). Rest Dodd is a fell that is often by-passed by walkers as they travel the busy footpath between Ullswater and Haweswater either to climb the more significant fell of High Street or strive to complete Alfred Wainwright’s Coast to Coast Walk. Indeed Wainwright describes Rest Dodd as “A fell of little interest although the east flank falls spectacularly in fans of colourful scree”. The fell is usually climbed in conjunction with other nearby \\"Wainwright\\" fells such as The Nab, Brock Crags and Angletarn Pikes. Topography Rest Dodd stands on the long ridge forming the boundary of the Martindale catchment, an extensive valley system emptying north into Ullswater. South east of Rest Dodd is The Knott and in the opposite direction is Brock Crags. A subsidiary ridge juts out north from Rest Dodd, ending at The Nab. This fell separates the heads of the Martindale valleys of Bannerdale and Rampsgill. A much shorter rocky spur also runs north west from Rest Dodd, divided from the Nab by Yewgrove Gill. The southern flank of the fell is formed by Hayeswater Gill. Rest Dodd appears as a high, rounded dome from most directions, the upper slopes being clad in rough grass. Below about 1,500 ft all of the faces are steep and rough, with some outcropping on the Martindale flanks. The ridge connecting to The Knott is broad topped and marshy, whilst that connecting to Brock Crags crosses a series of rocky outcrops as it narrows above Satura Crag. The way to the Nab, once the boundary wall of the deer forest is passed, is crossed by extensive peat hags. Many of these are deeper than the height of a man and add considerably to the time required. Ascents The ascent of Rest Dodd is usually started from the valley of Patterdale where there are two possible starting points: the village of Hartsop gives the most advantageous start being just two miles from the fell summit but it is a tough climb from Hayeswater Gill to join the main path from Patterdale village to Haweswater. The other route is longer (3.5 miles) and starts in Patterdale village and utilises the main path over Boardale hause and past Angle Tarn before following an old stone wall which leads unerringly to Rest Dodd’s summit.Alfred Wainwright:A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 2: Summit The summit of the fell has a substantial cairn due to the proximity of quite a few old stone walls and gives full length views of the Helvellyn range to the west as well as of the Ramps Gill valley to the north.

Paris was the 1983 NPC American National and IFBB World Bodybuilding Champion.  Biography  =Early life= Paris was born and grew up in Brown County and Columbus, Indiana. From a very early age, he was both artistic and athletic. He won National Scholastic awards for his drawings and paintings and wrote short stories in his spare time. Moreover, Paris was also involved in his school's debate team and a member of the International Thespian Society. Paris was involved in many sports in high school, he did track and field, golf, and was a talented football player for his school. After experimenting with weight training as a Sophomore, Paris started to gain size and strength. From that discovery Paris knew he wanted to be a bodybuilder. He moved to southern California to pursue his life and dreams of becoming a bodybuilder and actor. Within two years he had won two competitions, Mr. Los Angeles and Mr. Southern California. =Career= In 2006, Flex Magazine ranked Bob Paris the most aesthetic athlete in the history of bodybuilding. Renowned for both his aesthetics and artistic approach toward the sport, he was also a dedicated advocate for the rights of athletes and an outspoken voice in the push for drug testing at the professional level. He retired from bodybuilding in 1991. In addition to his writing career, Bob Paris remains a civil rights advocate and public speaker. He is also a model and a classically trained theater actor. Since rising to fame in the early 1980s, Bob Paris has appeared on the covers of scores of magazines worldwide. On October 10, 1998, he made his New York stage debut, starring at Carnegie Hall opposite Bea Arthur, Sandy Duncan, Michael Jeter, Philip Bosco, Alice Ripley and Tyne Daly in the Broadway musical, Jubilee as the character Mowgli.\\"Jubilee Carnegie Hall Concert (1998)\\", ovrtur.com. In 2009, he performed in a recurring role on the first season of the ABC Television series, Defying Gravity. Personal life In the July 1989 issue of Ironman, Paris came out in the media as a gay man. He was the world's first male professional athlete, in any sport, to come out in the media while still an active competitor in his sport.Ironman Magazine, July, 1989 The same year, Paris appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show discussing marriage and being gay. Oprah asked Paris, \\"Bob, why not just stay in the closet?\\" Paris explained how \\"you fall in love\\" and that it doesn't feel right to hide it. Paris and his former boyfriend, Rod Jackson, became symbols for gay marriage and advocated gay rights. Paris's career ended up suffering because he came out as gay; he claims his life was even threatened through mail and by phone. Paris lost about 80% of his bookings and endorsements for bodybuilding. After seven years of being together, Paris and Jackson split up. Paris admits that he kept trying to keep his relationship going even when he knew better; Paris felt that he would be giving gays a bad image if he and Jackson broke up. In 2012, Paris explained on his website that he never wanted to be a \\"lifestyle bodybuilder.\\" Paris enjoyed the discipline and focus bodybuilding engendered; he also simply just excelled at the sport. To Paris, bodybuilding allowed him to be artistic and a jock all at once, and the sport allowed him to exert his physical presence to the world in a way that demonstrated that he was a man. Today Paris is still active in fitness but not as serious as he once was. Paris believes exercise is part of having a more fulfilling life. Paris saw himself more as a writer over anything else. However, Paris believes bodybuilding saved his life and structured him to be the man he is today. Today, Paris no longer body-builds, although he lives a more basic natural and spiritual lifestyle and often describes this through his writings on Instagram and other social medial outlets. Paris lives with his spouse, Brian LeFurgey, on an island near Vancouver, British Columbia. Paris holds dual American and Canadian citizenship. Together since 1996, Bob and Brian were legally married in British Columbia after the province equalized the marriage laws in 2003.

The monster sets out to avenge the desecration of Ananka's tomb. His first victim is Stephen Banning, whom the creature kills as the aging archaeologist prepares for bed. As the sheriff (Cliff Clark) and coroner (Emmett Vogan) can't come up with a lead to the killer, newspapermen converge on Mapleton to learn more about the story. Babe Hanson (Wallace Ford) arrives on the scene after learning of his friend's death. When Jane Banning (Mary Gordon), Steve's sister, is killed, Hanson is convinced it is the work of a mummy. Meeting with the sheriff and coroner, Hanson is unable to convince them of the identity of the culprit. He tells his story to a newspaperman at the local bar, but is himself dispatched by Kharis almost immediately afterwards. Dr John Banning (John Hubbard) enlists the help of Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) to solve the puzzle of the \\"grayish mark\\" found on the victims' throats. Norman's test results prove that Hanson was right: the substance was indeed mold from a mummy. Meanwhile, Bey has plans of his own. Knowing that Banning and his girlfriend, Isobel Evans (Elyse Knox) are planning to marry, he sets out to disrupt their nuptials. Bey himself has become smitten with Isobel, and sends Kharis on a mission to bring her to him. Kharis initially balks, but finally adheres to Bey's command. In the dark of the night, the monster stealthily enters the Evans's home and abducts the fainting girl to the cemetery caretaker's hut. Bey unveils his plan to the reluctant Isobel, that she is to become his bride, as a \\"High Priest of Karnak\\", and bear him an heir to the royal line. Banning and the rest of the townspeople have become convinced that their recent Egyptian immigrant may be involved in the crimes. Arriving in force, they confront Bey outside the hut. Kharis slips away with Isobel unbeknownst to the horde, and Bey attempts to shoot Banning, but is himself gunned down by the sheriff. The creature is observed heading toward the Banning estate, and the group begins pursuit, many bearing torches. Inside the home, Banning holds Kharis at bay with a torch while he rescues Isobel from the mummy's grasp, but inadvertently sets fire to some curtains. With the aid of the sheriff and coroner, John and Isobel escape via a trellis as Kharis pursues them out onto the upstairs balcony. The townspeople keep the mummy from similarly escaping by hurling additional torches at him, and the monster perishes in the flames of the thoroughly consumed house. Banning and Isobel wed in short order, as he has received his draft notice and is due to report for his tour of duty in World War II.

Filming began June 1, 1942. Chaney disliked the role of Kharis the mummy. Make-up artist Jack Pierce spent up to eight hours each day wrapping Chaney in artificially-aged gauze. Instead of the painstaking, cotton-based makeup used on Boris Karloff and Tom Tyler in Universal's earlier Mummy films, Chaney wore a rubber mask. For unknown reasons, Wallace Ford's character's name is changed from Jenson from the previous film to Hanson in this film. The story was continued in the 1944 film, The Mummy's Ghost. The film was released on October 23, 1942 by Universal Pictures on a double bill with Night Monster. It was re-released in February, 1948 by Universal through Realart Pictures Internet Movie Database Trivia and went to television as part of the original Shock Theater package of 52 Universal titles syndicated in 1957. Critical reaction In recent times, Tim Janson of The SciFi Movie Page gave The Mummy's Tomb 3 1/4 stars. He writes, \\"Lon Chaney Jr., was a welcome addition as Kharis. He was physically more imposing than Tom Tyler or Boris Karloff\\". http://www.scifimoviepage.com/review-of-the-mummys-tomb-from-1942/ References  External links   * 1942 films 1940s fantasy films 1942 horror films American black-and-white films American films American supernatural horror films American sequel films Ancient Egypt in fiction English-language films Films directed by Harold Young (director) Films set in Egypt Films set in Massachusetts Mummy films Universal Classic Monsters films Universal Pictures films American fantasy films ","title":"The Mummy's Tomb"},{"id":"3494250","text":"A rank is a line of military personnel, drawn up in line abreast (i.e. standing side by side).Holbrook, p. 13.Duparcq, p. 71.

Supper at Emmaus. 1601. National Gallery, London The painting inevitably invites comparison with the National Gallery version of the same subject: the expansive theatrical gestures have become understated and natural, the shadows are darkened, and the colours muted although still saturated. The effect is to emphasize presence more than drama. Some details - the ear of the disciple on the right, the right hand of the innkeeper's wife - remain badly drawn, but there is a fluidity in the handling of the paint which was to increase in Caravaggio's post-Roman work as his brushwork became increasingly calligraphic. The artist may have had problems working out his composition - the innkeeper's wife looks like a last-minute addition. Neither she nor the innkeeper are mentioned in the Gospel of Luke 24:28-32, but had been introduced by Renaissance painters to act as a foil to the amazement of the two disciples as they recognise the resurrected Christ.

During Ottoman rule the monastery fell into disrepair. In 1844, Patriarch Germanos IV converted the monastery into a school of theology, which was inaugurated on 1 October 1844. All the buildings, except for the 17th-century chapel, were destroyed by the 1894 Istanbul earthquake, but were rebuilt by architect Periklis Fotiadis and inaugurated on 6 October 1896.

Introduced in the animated film The Lion King in 1994, Nala subsequently appears as a less prominent character in the film's sequels The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998) and The Lion King 1½ (2004), and serves as a recurring character in The Lion Guard (2015–2019). In the original film, the adult Nala is voiced by American actress Moira Kelly. Young Nala's speaking voice is provided by actress Niketa Calame, while singers Laura Williams and Sally Dworsky provide the singing voices of young and adult Nala respectively. Nala is introduced as the best friend of Simba, and ultimately becomes his wife by the end of The Lion King. Several years after Simba's uncle Scar has killed Simba's father Mufasa and taken the throne, Nala desperately ventures into the jungle to find help. Upon unexpectedly reuniting with a grown Simba, who she had long been tricked by Scar into presuming dead, Nala encourages him to return to Pride Rock, overthrow his uncle and ultimately become king. As Simba's queen, Nala has a son, Kopa, an adventurous cub in The Lion King: Six New Adventures, a daughter, Kiara, whose story is explored in The Lion King: Simba's Pride and another son named Kion, who serves as the protagonist of The Lion Guard. Nala is the most significant female character in The Lion King. As the film was inspired by William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet, Nala is considered to be The Lion King's equivalent of Hamlet's love interest Ophelia, although differences remain between the two characters. Many early concepts first developed for Nala were eventually abandoned, including a brother and father for the character, as well as her being romantically pursued by Scar. While critical reception towards Nala has been generally mixed, Kelly's vocal performance has been praised. Nala appears in the Broadway musical adaptation of the film, first played by singer Heather Headley. The character also appears in the television series The Lion Guard, with Gabrielle Union replacing Kelly as the voice of Nala. Beyoncé and Shahadi Wright Joseph voice the character in the 2019 CGI live adaptation of the original film directed by Jon Favreau. Development =Conception and creation= Screenwriter Linda Woolverton conceived Nala \\"as part of a gradual progression ... which have driven recent public conversation about what young girls should be able to expect from their cinematic role models.\\" In early versions of the screenplay, Nala has a younger brother named Mheetu, who enjoys accompanying her and her best friend Simba on their adventures. Pronounced \\"me too\\", the character's name is a reference to this personality trait. Simba was intended to save the cub from a wildebeest stampede, and Nala would eventually become responsible for protecting Mheetu from Simba's tyrannical uncle Scar. Nala also had a fox friend named Bhati. According to Woolverton, Mheetu and Bhati were eventually written out of the film because their stories were beginning to distract from Simba's, in addition to the Mheetu-Scar subplot making the film too dark when combined with the death of Simba's father Mufasa. At one point, Nala also had a named father; the character was similarly abandoned. In addition, in another script, Sarafina (then named Naanda) was Sarabi's younger sister, and Mufasa was implied to be her mate, and thus Nala's Father. This implication was censored in the final draft as it would lead to incest between Simba and Nala as half siblings as well as first cousins. Because The Lion King was originally conceived as a much more mature and adult-oriented film, Nala was intended to have been banished from the Pride Lands as punishment for rejecting Scar's romantic advances. This idea was to have been further explored in Scar's song \\"Be Prepared (Reprise)\\", during which Scar demands that Nala become his queen, but the musical number was ultimately cut from the final film because the scene was considered too \\"creepy.\\" Matthew Roulette of TheFW believes that the scene was abandoned because of the significant age difference between Nala and Scar. Nala means \\"gift\\" in Swahili. The character has a mother, whose name is never mentioned in the film; however, she is credited as Sarafina during the film's end credits. Candice Russel of the Sun- Sentinel believes that Nala contributes to the film's love story – \\"an indispensable factor in Disney cartoon features\\" – in addition to convincing Simba to return to Pride Rock. It has been observed that, unlike Disney's three previous animated efforts (The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992), the romantic relationship between Nala and Simba is not main plot of the film. Ella Ceron of Thought Catalog observed that \\"At [Simba's] return, she's not exactly the friendliest little kitten, either ... but is willing to overlook her own hurt ego in the spirit of their friendship. She believes in Simba, and doesn’t understand why he wouldn’t want to fight for his right to rule.\\" =Voice and music= The speaking voice of adult Nala is provided by American actress Moira Kelly. Kelly (who rose her fame in Robert Downey, Jr. film Chaplin) learned that Disney was auditioning actresses for the role of Nala from her agent. Despite having not been the directors' first choice for the role, Kelly was allowed to audition because the filmmakers were interested in hearing different voices at the time. Kelly believes the directors had been searching for a specific \\"quality of voice ... a sort of authoritative voice but with a lot of warmth\\" to complement Nala's sensible yet nurturing personality. After attending a series of callbacks, during which Kelly returned to Disney several times to re-read the character's lines, Kelly was selected as one of two finalists. Kelly would not officially be offered the part until several months after her audition; Disney's first choice for the role remains undisclosed. Actor Matthew Broderick, voice of Simba, had already begun recording alongside another actress who had been cast as Nala before that actress was replaced with Kelly. Broderick was not informed that his original co-star had been recast, and only learned that Nala was voiced by Kelly at the film's premiere. The film's entire recording process took approximately three years to complete, during which Kelly's sessions were held in both the United States and Canada, while her co-stars Broderick and Jeremy Irons, voice of Scar, were recording in the United States and England, respectively. Each main cast member recorded their dialogue separately, which took Kelly some time to get used to because she had grown accustomed to working with several other actors at a time on the sets of her live-action films. For The Lion King, a director would often take the place of another actor for Kelly to act opposite of. Vocally, Kelly decided to approach the role as though she were reading to a child, explaining, \\"it's kind of fun to play with different voices and try to color the lines for the child so they can imagine it more fully\\", which she admitted is different than how the actress would approach a live-action role. Because Nala is a \\"very straight character\\", determining what kind of voice she would use for her was not a particularly challenging task. Additionally, the filmmakers would also film Kelly's performances in order to incorporate her own facial expressions into her character's design, the process of which impressed the actress. In her film debut, actress Niketa Calame voices young Nala. According to Calame's official website, Nala remains the actress' \\"biggest role to date\\". A classically trained pianist and chorister, Laura Williams provides the singing voice of young Nala, which can be heard in the song \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\"; the singer was 15 years old at the time. Meanwhile, singer-songwriter Sally Dworsky provides the singing voice of adult Nala, which is heard during the song \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\". The lyrics of the film's love theme, \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\", were re-written approximately 15 times, according to lyricist Tim Rice, who wrote the song alongside composer Elton John. At one point, the producers wanted the song to be a comical duet performed by supporting characters Timon and Pumbaa, despite the fact that John had originally composed the song with Nala and Simba in mind. However, John lobbied in favor of \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\" being a love song performed as a duet by Nala and Simba, with which the filmmakers ultimately agreed. When asked by Disney if she was interested in reprising her role as Nala in The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, Kelly immediately accepted, joking, \\"Sure, you wanna do a third, fourth, fifth? I'm right there\\". In the case of The Lion King 1½, it took the actress only a couple of days to record her character's dialogue due to Nala's comparatively smaller role in the film; much of Nala's footage from the first film was simply reused accordingly. Elton John's official website cites Kelly among the film's cast of actors who \\"would grace any red carpet.\\" Kelly's performance as Nala is responsible for introducing the actress to a younger audience. Previously, she had been better known for appearing in more adult-oriented live-action films at that time. In 2011, Kelly revealed that fans of the film rarely recognize her speaking voice as the voice of Nala, although Robert DeSalvo of NextMovie.com claims that the actress \\"has a ... distinctive voice that The Lion King fans will instantly recognize as the voice of adult Nala.\\" Characterization and themes A straight woman character, Kelly described Nala as a sensible and nurturing yet authoritative character, while Amber Leab of Bitch Flicks described her as strong, independent and intelligent. According to Oh My Disney, Nala serves as \\"the proverbial glue that keeps The Lion King together\\", from whose perspective the audience watches the film because she \\"says EXACTLY what we’re thinking\\". Occupying the role of the film's female lead, Nala is The Lion King's most important female character, who contributes to the film's \\"small romance element\\". Often identified as the film's deuteragonist, Taylor Orci of The Atlantic felt that \\"Nala is really the agent of change in The Lion King\\", dismissing Simba as a \\"rich, lazy boyfriend.\\" Leab observed that The Lion King's male characters tend to \\"take the center stage\\" while \\"female characters take a backseat to the action.\\" Lenka Křivánková of Masaryk University wrote in her thesis \\"1990s Hollywood Break-Away Hits: A Feminist Perspective\\" that she was not particularly surprised by the film's lack of strong roles for women because of its Shakespearean source material, dubbing the film \\"an old traditional fairy tale with all its traditional features\\", including patriarchy and monarchism. Writing for the University of Waterloo's Kinema, Vicky Wong believes that Nala reinforces the film's \\"take your place\\" motif, reminding main character Simba of his responsibilities. In his book Retelling Stories, Framing Culture: Traditional Story and Metanarratives in Children's Literature, author John Stephens credits Nala with teaching Simba about responsibility – \\"the lesson the hero must learn before he can become an adult\\". Film critic James Berardinelli identified Nala as The Lion King's \\"sole significant female character.\\" Including Nala, The Lion King has only three major female characters in comparison to the film's total of nine male ones. Mouse Morality: The Rhetoric of Disney Animated Film author Annalee R. Ward wrote that Nala's role in The Lion King reflected \\"a 1990s feminist reversal\\". In her book Biblical Allusions, author Lindsay Bacher acknowledged that Nala is often depicted as a stronger and more responsible character than Simba, despite observations that The Lion King's female characters lack agency. Leab identified Nala as Simba's \\"equal\\" who is \\"a more naturally sound leader throughout the film, while Simba tends to be comparatively a bit more immature and in need of multiple characters propelling him into responsible/rightful action.\\" Nala is also a more skilled fighter than Simba, proven by the character's ability to overwhelm him in battle, which is reminiscent \\"of the physical power of lionesses in the real nature.\\" However, as strong as she is, Nala has little impact elsewhere; author Brian K. Pennington wrote in his book Teaching Religion and Violence that \\"Nala's assertions of gender equality are clearly groundless, since only a male lion can stop Scar.\\" New York's David Denbey dismissed Nala's athleticism as nothing more than Disney's attempt to \\"disguise [the film's] essential boss- daddy ethos.\\" Bacher believes that had The Lion King featured Nala as the Pride Lands' hero as opposed to Simba, the film could have avoided having a \\"patriarchal structure.\\" Leab concluded that \\"the main and most problematic aspects of the film\\" remain that The Lion King \\"boils down to the fact that an entire group of strong female characters are unable to confront a single male oppressor; to do so, they need to be led by a dominant male.\\" Leab continued, \\"It almost sucks more that Nala is such a strong ... female character and still ends up constrained by this plot device\\", accusing the film of depicting women as weak. Alongside Faline from Bambi (1942) and Maid Marian from Robin Hood (1973) added, Nala belongs to a trio of Disney heroines who, after having been separated from their love interests for several years, eventually reunite with them. Stephens believes that Nala and Simba's separation allows the characters to fall in love \\"properly\\" upon reuniting as young adults. Because The Lion King is loosely based on William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet, Nala is considered to be the film's \\"representative\\" of the Hamlet character Ophelia, Hamlet's love interest. Both characters' relationships with and opinions of their love interests are similar, however, there are several differences between the two women. The Daily Californian's Miyako Singer argued that \\"Nala is no poor, tragic Ophelia\\", instead resembling a \\"fierce princess warrior\\" similar to the strong heroines Disney introduced during the 1990s. Unlike Ophelia, Nala does not succumb to insanity, nor does she eventually die. Instead, Nala establishes herself as a powerful ally by encouraging Simba to return to Pride Rock, and helping the character overthrow Scar. Additionally, Nala is a more stubborn character than Ophelia, the latter of whom is quite passive and obedient. While Ophelia is raised by a single father, Nala is raised solely by her mother, which inspired Allen to believe that Nala is a manifestation of how Ophelia would have turned out had she been raised by a woman instead of a man, concluding, \\"Nala is able to show the potential that Ophelia could have had.\\". Appearances =Film and television= A young Nala debuted in The Lion King (1994) as the daughter of Sarafina and the best friend of Simba, who she often accompanies on his adventures throughout the Pride Lands. Simba invites Nala to visit the forbidden Elephant Graveyard with him, despite his father Mufasa's orders. The cubs are soon ambushed by Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, a trio of hyenas chosen by Simba's treacherous uncle Scar to kill Simba in order to improve his own chances of becoming king, but are ultimately rescued by Mufasa. The following day, however, Nala is devastated to learn from Scar that both Simba and Mufasa have perished during a wildebeest stampede. With both Simba and Mufasa dead, Scar usurps the throne and becomes king. Several years into Scar's tyrannical rule, which has left the kingdom barren and starving, a desperate Nala ventures into the jungle in search of help, where she attempts to eat a warthog named Pumbaa; little does she know that the warthog is actually a friend of Simba's, who is, in fact, alive and well. While defending Pumbaa from Nala, Simba recognizes Nala, and the two finally reunite only to argue over why Simba is refusing to face his responsibilities and return to Pride Rock. Upon learning that Simba has eventually decided to return to Pride Rock and face Scar, Nala travels back to the Pride Lands to assist him. Surprised to find Simba alive, Scar forces his guilt-ridden nephew to \\"admit\\" to the pride that he is responsible for Mufasa's death, which was in fact caused by Scar himself by throwing Mufasa off a cliff into the stampede. Upon learning the truth, Simba forces his uncle to admit his crime to the pride, and a battle ensues between the pride and Scar's army of hyenas. Simba eventually defeats Scar and becomes king, with Nala ultimately becoming his queen. In the film's first direct-to-video sequel The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998), Nala appears in a less prominent role as Queen of the Pride Lands and mother of Kiara, the spirited daughter of her and Simba. Nala observes that Kiara, of whom Simba is very protective, has inherited her father's rebellious personality and love of adventure. When Kiara befriends Zira's son Kovu, a young lion from an exiled pride of Scar's followers known as the Outsiders, Nala is much more tolerant of their relationship than Simba, and convinces him to offer Kovu a chance to prove himself trustworthy. At the end of the film, Nala gains Kovu as her son-in-law after he marries Kiara. In The Lion King 1½ (2004), which focuses instead on Timon and Pumbaa's friendship, Nala's role is virtually identical to that of her appearance in The Lion King because filmmakers reused most of the character's footage from the first film. Voiced by actress Gabrielle Union, Nala reprises her role as Queen of the Pride Lands in the television series The Lion Guard, the 2016 premiere of which was preceded by the made-for-television film The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar (2015). Set within the time gap in The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, the show revolves around Nala and Simba's son Kion who, being their second-born cub after Kiara, has been tasked with forming the next Lion Guard, a group responsible for protecting the Pride Lands. By the end of season 3, Nala also gains Rani as her daughter-in-law after she marries Kion, who is becoming the king of the Tree of Life and retired as the leader of the Lion Guard. Although a fan of the Lion King franchise, Union avoided watching previous Lion King films in preparation for the role because she wanted to \\"put [her] own stamp\\" on the character. On November 1, 2017, it was confirmed that Beyoncé Knowles- Carter would voice adult Nala in Jon Favreau's The Lion King, which was released in July 19, 2019. Favreau felt that \\"part of [her joining the film] is that she’s got young kids, part of it is that it’s a story that feels good for this phase of her life and her career, and she really likes the original very much. And then, of course, there are these wonderful musical numbers that she can be involved with, and my God… she really lives up to her reputation as far as the beauty of her voice and talent\\". The same day Shahadi Wright Joseph was cast as young Nala in the film. Joseph reprises her role from the Broadway production. Joseph choose to work on the film because \\"[she knows] Nala inspires little girls because that happened to [her] when [she] was younger. [Joseph] literally said that [she] wanted to be her. She’s a great role model\\". Joseph said that, upon learning that Beyoncé would be voicing the grown-up Nala, she \\"really had to step [her] game up and think about what Beyoncé would want\\". The film marks the comeback of the singer since her pregnancy and her first musical film since Dreamgirls in 2006. Nala's role in the 2019 remake is slightly expanded. As a cub, Nala is portrayed as more wary and reluctant when venturing the Elephant Graveyard with Simba, sensing the danger lurking in the place. During Scar's reign, adult Nala develops a rivalry with Shenzi due to their first encounter. She also suggests to Sarabi that they should fight back or leave Pride Lands, but Sarabi turns down both suggestions. This leads Nala to sneak out of Pride Rock the following night so she can get help. Zazu uses himself as a diversion to allow Nala to leave without being caught by Scar and the hyenas. She reunites with Simba at the jungle like in the original but leaves immediately after Simba refuses to return, only for Simba to follow her soon after changing his mind. During the climax, Nala fights against Shenzi and emerges victorious. She then marries Simba and gave birth to a cub like in the original film. =Musical= In the Broadway musical adaptation of The Lion King, the role of Nala was originated by Trinidadian-American singer Heather Headley. Her Broadway debut, at first auditioning for the role proved a challenge for the singer due to her Ragtime contract, which her agent was eventually successful in getting her released from. Director Julie Taymor felt that Nala's journey in the film was underdeveloped and among the story's weaker elements, and thus decided to \\"strengthen\\" the character's narrative for Broadway. Her role in the musical remains the same as the film except for a scene where during the song \\"The Madness of King Scar\\", Nala comes to Scar to urge him to do something about the drought in the Pride Lands, only for Scar to try and seduce her into becoming his queen and mother of his children. Nala refuses since she's already been betrothed to Simba, prince of the Pride Lands as an infant by their parents, Sarafina, Mufasa and Sarabi and flees the Pride Lands to find help. Reception Critical reception towards Nala has been generally mixed; both film and feminist critics have accused the film of lacking empowering roles for female characters, including Nala. James Berardinelli of ReelViews appreciated the fact that \\"after three animated motion pictures centered upon the love of two people from different worlds\\", the love story between Nala and Simba has been relegated to that of \\"a subplot.\\" Desson Howe of The Washington Post advised parents to remind their daughters that despite the fact that Nala \\"pads in the supportive shadows, awaiting her inevitable marriage to Simba, it doesn't mean human girls can't grow up to be monarchs too.\\" Nala's role and demeanor during the film's romantic \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\" sequence has drawn criticism in regards to her \\"submissive behaviour\\". The New York Times' Janet Maslin cited the film's lack of a strong heroine among its weaknesses, dismissing Nala and Simba's interaction throughout \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\" as \\"obligatory\\" and \\"gratuitous\\". Joel W. Martin wrote in the Journal of Religion and Film, \\"One song later, [Nala and Simba] have fallen in love. Playing one day, they literally tumble down a hillside in the jungle, and he ends up on top of her. This time, she does not bear her teeth, but instead, shows 'bedroom eyes'\\". Martin ultimately accused the scene's \\"reversal of positions\\" of \\"establish[ing] male dominance.\\" Criticizing the film for \\"being merely distracting when it could have been both meaningful and instructive\\", Robert Humanick of Slant Magazine wrote, \\"Small potatoes, then, when Simba's former childhood friend and betrothed queen Nala ... unexpectedly reappears in his duty-free, protein-rich life, demanding he return to his kingly responsibilities and coaxing the lion to sleep tonight with arguably the most blatant 'fuck me now' face to ever appear in a PG-rated film.\\" Kathryn LeBey Davidson of Her Campus believes that Nala's reputation is harmed by her limited screen time and role, ranking her the 19th greatest Disney heroine. More recently, the possibility of an incestuous relationship involving Simba, his mate Nala, Scar and Mufasa has surfaced. According to Johnson Cheu, author of Diversity in Disney Films: Critical Essays on Race, Ethnicity, Gender, Sexuality and Disability, the fact that Mufasa, Scar, and Simba appear to be the only male lions present in The Lion King suggests the possibility that either Mufasa or Scar is Nala's father, which would in turn make Nala either Simba's half-sister or cousin. However, The Lion Guard identifies Nala's father as a red-maned unnamed lion who-in his youth- resembled his grandson (and Scar's great-nephew) Kion. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahDYZy4-yPU This lion was likely kicked out of the pride upon coming of age, as happens to real male lions, though not before impregnating Sarafina (Nala's mother). However, the character has garnered positive reviews as well. Sara Franks-Allen of ScreenCrush wrote that \\"If being a Disney princess is about being a good role model for little girls, then Nala has a lot in her favor\\", elaborating, \\"She's strong enough to take down Simba, ventures out on her own to find help for her pride and calls Simba out for ignoring his responsibilities.\\" Meanwhile, Ella Ceron of Thought Catalog ranked Nala 14th on her list of \\"The 16 Most Awesome Female Characters From Disney Movies\\". Responsible for introducing the seasoned actress to a younger audience, Kelly's vocal performance as Nala has garnered critical acclaim. Writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe hailed Kelly's voice acting as \\"terrific.\\" Jeremy Gerard of Variety commended Kelly for voicing the character \\"beautifully\\". PopSugar ranked Kelly among the website's \\"Favorite Animated Voices\\", writing, \\"there are a lot of great voices in Disney's The Lion King ... but Moira Kelly has a unique quality to her voice, and I remember reveling in it as a youngster anytime the adult Nala was on the screen.\\" Official Disney Blogs published an article entitled \\"We All Thought it… But Nala Actually Said It\\", which cites the character's most revered quotes. The blog also ranked Nala eighth on the website's \\"Definitive Ranking of Disney Cats\\" list. In a 2014 interview, actor Eddie Redmayne admitted that Nala was his first \\"celebrity crush\\", having been specifically attracted to the character's \\"sweet\\" face and singing voice, referring to the experience as his \\"sexual awakening\\". Review of Beyonce's Nala in 2019 remake is generally positive. Brandon Zachary from CBR Exclusive praised Nala's growth in the film is better than the original due to her unexpected rivalry with Shenzi. He enjoys the final fight between Nala and Shenzi at the climax, commenting it \\"has more weight than any of the other nameless fights that happen in the frenzy\\" and gives bigger moment for Nala's character. Brian Truitt from USA Today praised Beyoncé's performance as Nala for bringing \\"all the necessary fire as Nala, a lion willing to do anything to protect her pride.\\" Peter Debrug from Variety commented that Nala is an improvement from her animated version.

The film was directed by Todd Phillips (later the director of Old School, The Hangover Trilogy and Joker) and covers the band's summer and fall 1997 tours, plus footage from their 1998 spring tour of Europe. The documentary ends with The Great Went, a giant two-day festival held in upstate Maine which attracted 70,000 people. The film's title comes from a Phish song of the same name, which is featured at the end of the movie. Songs Most songs that appear in the film were performed live unless noted. Eight cover songs are featured in the film, including the rehearsal and debut of Ween's \\"Roses Are Free\\" from their Chocolate and Cheese album. Two other notable debuts captured in the film are an early version of \\"Sleep\\" (played solo by Trey on his Languedoc guitar for the cameras which would later appear on their 2000 album Farmhouse) and a soundcheck of the band performing what was at the time the new faster arpeggiated version of \\"Water in Sky\\" that would be seen later that year in studio form on their 1998 album The Story of the Ghost. The song list does not follow the order in which the scenes were shot. \\"The Great Went\\" appears as the climax of the film, though in reality it was the first footage that Phillips shot for the movie.

Biography When Sökol was still a toddler, her parents (Michael \\"Happy\\" Sökol and Magdalena Cuillery) divorced and her mother married Fernando Diez Barroso, an executive at Televisa. As a child, she was known as Sasha Diez Barroso, but now goes by her paternal name, Sökol. She studied at the Colegio Peterson and later at the Centro de Educación Artística (CEA) of Televisa. At that time, the music and television producer Luis de Llano Macedo was seeking to create a Mexican version of the band Parchís, and Sökol held castings at the CEA. Sökol has one brother named Michel Sokol Cuillery and two sisters, Alexandra and Ximena Diez Barroso. =Timbiriche= Sökol was selected as one of the original seven members and that is how she started her singing career in 1982. Sökol recorded seven albums with Timbiriche, which earned 25 gold albums and ten platinum albums. Timbiriche earned her awards from El Heraldo and the TVyNovelas Awards. In 1984, with Timbiriche, Sökol participated in Vaselina as Sandy, the Spanish-language version of Grease. In 1986, she left Timbiriche and moved to Boston, Massachusetts, US to continue her acting studies. =Solo career= In 1986, Sökol enrolled at the Walnut Hill School for the Performing Arts. The following year, she released her first solo album, Sasha, which sold over a million copies in Mexico, making it one of Mexico's best-selling albums in 1987.( SASHA SOKOL HISTORIA BIO MUSIC) \\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KZuoVynFIs 18 February 2010. Retrieved 23 August 2014 Her first single was \\"No Me Extraña Nada\\", which was released with a music video. She was nicknamed \\"La Dama de Negro\\" (The Lady in Black) for her habit of dressing in said color. The biggest hit of the album was \\"Rueda Mi Mente\\", which peaked at number one on Mexican radio and remained there for several weeks. Sökol made her television solo debut in Siempre En Domingo, the biggest variety show in Ibero-America at the time. In 1988, she released the maxi-single \\"Diamante\\", which was chosen as the theme song for the music magazine Eres. In 1988, she also launched a television career with the series Tres Generaciones (TV Show) (Three Generations), starring Carmen Montejo and Angélica María. In 1989, she recorded a song titled \\"Detrás del Amor\\" for the compilation album Nos vamos de vacaciones, which also featured Alejandra Guzmán and Alix Bauer (another ex-Timbiriche). She released her second album, Trampas de luz, that year. In 1990, she recorded the song \\"Amor amor\\" for the compilation album Juntos ayer y hoy, and the song \\"Noche de ronda\\" for the compilation album El estudio de Lara. In 1991, Sökol released her third album, Siento, and appeared in the Mexican soap opera Alcanzar una estrella II. It was a tremendous hit and the musical group from the telenovela, called Muñecos de papel (Paper Dolls) which included Sökol, Ricky Martin, Bibi Gaytan and Angélica Rivera among others, released two soundtrack albums with music from the series. Muñecos de papel had such success that it went on a national tour throughout Mexico and was nominated as \\"Revelation of the Year\\" at the second annual awards show Premios Eres, and won the coveted honor. In 1992, Sökol released her fourth solo album, Amor sin tiempo. From the late 1980s to the early 1990s, Sökol was among the most popular singers in Mexico and Latin America. Her most successful album has been her first, Sasha (1987). At that time, she was considered the top female pop icon in Mexico and her style was imitated by hordes of teenagers throughout Mexico, and led to the release of her own jewellery line and a perfume labelled \\"Fama\\". In 1993, Sökol put her career on hold and put herself in rehabilitation for cocaine addiction. Months later, she formally made statements to the Mexican media about her drug addiction and rehabilitation. She publicly apologized to her fans for her disappearance and for all the rumours that were brought forth while out of the spotlight. In 1997, she returned to the music scene with an album titled 11:11, released by Sony Mexico. Right before she started a 1998 tour titled 11:11 acústico (11:11 Acoustic), which was to take place throughout Mexico and certain countries in Central and South America, but her international tour was cancelled because of her mother's hospitalization and eventual death. In 1998, Sökol joined all original founding members of the Mexican pop group Timbiriche in an international tour, and they recorded a double album titled El concierto. In 2004, she returned once again to the music scene, after a long absence, with the album Por un amor.Llewellyn, Howell (2004) \\"V2 Spain Does Not Limit Itself to 'Indie Sound'\\", Billboard, 6 March 2004.

In 2005, Sokol participated in the reality show Big Brother VIP and won the grand prize. Up to 2005, she had earned eleven gold albums, four platinum albums and one diamond album in her solo career. In 2006, she recorded the song \\"No encuentro un momento pa' olvidar\\" with the Spanish singer Miguel Bosé. In 2007, she joined the original founding members of Timbiriche (except Paulina Rubio because of an international solo tour) to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the group. In 2010, the same six founding members of Timbiriche went on tour again. In 2010, Sökol returned to the pop music genre with her seventh pop album, and eighth album overall, Tiempo Amarillo. In 2012, Sökol joined Erik Rubin and Benny Ibarra, fellow members of the pop group Timbiriche, and released Primera Fila: Sasha Benny Erik, a live album featuring their greatest hits as a musical trio called Sasha, Benny y Erik. The album includes three hits from each artist, three cover songs and one new track. The unique aspect of this live album is that they sing all 13 tracks together.

1777, for the oboist Giuseppe Ferlendis (1755–1802) from Bergamo. In 1778, Mozart re-worked it as a concerto for flute in D major. ISMN M-00645740-3 The concerto is a widely studied piece for both instruments and is one of the more important concertos in the oboe repertoire. Movements As with his Flute Concerto No. 1, the piece is arranged for a standard string section (violin I/II, viola and cello/double-bass doubling the bass line), two oboes, and two horns in D/C.Flute Concerto No. 2 in D major, K. 314 (K. 285d). Allmusic. The first and last movements are in the home key of C major, while the second movement is in the subdominant key of F major. The piece is divided into three movements: # Allegro aperto # Adagio non troppo # Rondo : Allegretto Flute Concerto No. 2 The Flute Concerto No. 2 in D Major, K. 314 (285d) is an adaptation of the original oboe concerto. Dutch flautist Ferdinand De Jean (1731–1797) commissioned Mozart for four flute quartets and three flute concerti; of which Mozart only completed three quartets and one new flute concerto. Instead of creating a new second concerto, Mozart rearranged the oboe concerto he had written a year earlier as the second flute concerto, although with substantial changes for it to fit with what the composer deemed flute-like. However, De Jean did not pay Mozart for this concerto because it was based on the oboe concerto.Freed, Richard. Flute Concerto No. 2 in D major, K. 314 . John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. 5–7 October 2006 Origin While the original version for oboe had been lost before Alfred Einstein wrote Mozart: His Character, His Work, the oboe origin of the flute concerto was suspected then, in part because of references in letters to a now-missing oboe concerto, as Einstein wrote, and of similar details in the orchestral string lines which suggested a transposition was used. Also, Einstein noted the two scores in D Major and C Major of the K. 314 Concerto in the Library of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna, which led to the belief that the oboe concerto was the origin of the flute concerto. The orchestra parts of the composition and solo oboe part in C were rediscovered by Bernhard Paumgartner in Salzburg, in 1920. See also The first movement of Mozart's unfinished Oboe Concerto in F major, K. 293 (1778) has been completed by the Mozart scholar and pianist Robert D. Levin, and by the musicologist William Drabkin in 2015.

Her music is a blend of pop dance with infusions of electronica. She began her professional career at the age of 16, and has gained recognition within the European music scene, on MTV and in the Russian music industry. Making a transition to the US music scene, Sasha attracted press attention when attending at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards. Gradiva met American producer Tricky Stewart and soon after released her first US single \\"Wanted\\". It was co-written with Justin Tranter of Semi Precious Weapons and produced by Stewart and Norwegian producer Axident. She has gained recognition within the club dance scene and has been referred to by Hot Spot Magazine and Gay Pride as \\"one of the most promising artists in the mainstream US music scene.\\" Career After much success overseas, Gradiva has emerged on the U.S dance-pop scene with her fusion of pop and electronica. Sasha, Gradiva's self- titled debut solo album, was released by ARS Records. It produced six hit singles that propelled her to stardom. Sasha followed up the impressive success of her debut solo album with yet another hit record- Say My Name with Love. Gradiva has appeared in the pages of the Russian publications of Cosmopolitan, Maxim and Vogue. Skum's lead guitarist John Eaton, is impressed with Sasha's commitment to not lip sync, has been quoted saying, \\"Sasha doesn't go that route and makes it live, the way it should be. I like her style and she is going to be a huge star.\\" Gradiva was the first Russian artist to be invited to the Grammy Awards in 2012, where she wore a pink gown with a gun sleeve, causing a media frenzy. Dubbed \\"The Gun Girl\\" at the Grammys, stories circulated in outlets that included Rolling Stone Magazine, US Weekly, Entertainment Weekly, The Hollywood Reporter, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, among others, that quickly gained her the reputation of being a showstopper. When asked to explain the meaning behind her ensemble, she has said that she was calling all countries to submit their weapons for fashion and artistic expression. Her singles \\"Pandemonium\\" and \\"I'm on Fire\\" were placed on MTV Network, but it was her collaboration with Semi Precious Weapons' lead singer Justin Tranter, as well as recorder producer Tricky Stewart, for her debut U.S single release, Wanted that put her on the US map. Wanted was released on February 25, 2012, nearly one month after the media frenzy that followed her appearance at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in a pink gown and Terminator-esque arm sleeve. \\"Wanted\\" reached No. 3 on Billboard's Hot Dance Single Sales chart and #5 on their overall Hot Single Sales chart in 2012, further proving she is well on her way to matching her European success in the U.S. Gradiva spent all of 2013 and part of 2014 touring the entire US, and hit all 50 states, gaining a large fan base in America. She put on shows across the country to crowds of over 300,000 and has shared stages with the likes of Adam Lambert, Icona Pop, Cher Lloyd and Emeli Sande among others. Her latest single \\"Tin Foil\\" has been well received in the UK, and charted at #10 in the Music Week Upfront Club Chart, while its Super Stylers Remix charted at #12. Gradiva remains upfront and center as a fashionista in the media, and is popular among household media names like Hollywood Life, Radar Online, OK!, Star, National Enquirer, People, and many others. Sasha lives in Los Angeles, California with her daughter Uma, where she is spending most her time in the studio working on new music for her fans. In May 2016 Gradiva announced that she will be partnering with Jolie Jewelry for her new \\"Gun Girl\\" jewelry line that's set to be sold online and in a few select stores, including H. Lorenzo and Fred Segal. Political views In 2014, Gradiva condemned Russia's controversial anti-gay law in an interview with The Huffington Post. Her strong sense of self paired with an equally strong voice and set of liberal political views, has made her an icon in the LGBT dance scene. She most recently took a stand against the racial injustices that took place in Baltimore, Spring of 2015, by putting on a show at the House of Blues Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, called \\"No Color Just Shine.\\" Gradiva is also rumored to be pairing up with controversial artist ChadMichael C Morrisette for a creative collaboration, possibly in honor of the Orlando Pulse shooting victims.

The plantation was built for Carter Burwell, grandson of Robert \\"King\\" Carter, and was completed in 1755. It was probably named for both the prominent and wealthy Carter family and nearby Grove Creek. Carter's Grove Plantation was built on the site of an earlier tract known as Martin's Hundred which had first been settled by the English colonists around 1620. In 1976, an archaeological project discovered the site of Wolstenholme Towne, a small settlement downstream a few miles from Jamestown which had been developed in the first 15 years of the Colony of Virginia. The population of the settlement was decimated during the Indian Massacre of 1622. After hundreds of years of multiple owners and generations of families, and the death of the last resident in 1964, Carter's Grove was added to Colonial Williamsburg Foundation's (CW) properties through a gift from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1969. Carter's Grove was open to tourists for many years but closed its doors to the public in 2003 while CW redefined its mission and role. Later that year, Hurricane Isabel seriously damaged Carter's Grove Country Road, which had linked the estate directly to the Historic Area, a distance of , bypassing commercial and public roadways. CW then shifted some of the interpretive programs to locations closer to the main Williamsburg Historic Area and announced in late 2006 that it would be offered for sale under specific restrictive conditions, including a conservation easement. In December 2007, CNET founder Halsey Minor acquired the Georgian style mansion and for $15.3 million and announced plans to use it as his home and for a thoroughbred horse breeding program with the Phipps family. The Virginia Outdoors Foundation and the Virginia Department of Historic Resources co-hold the conservation easement on 400 of the 476 acres. However, Minor never lived at the property and filed for personal bankruptcy in 2013. The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation submitted the only bid at the auction held on May 21, 2014, for the outstanding mortgage amount, and announced that it planned to resell it, with a price increased because of significant costs related to the sale, including over $600,000 in necessary repairs.\\"Colonial Williamsburg to sell plantation anew\\"Virginia Lawyers Media June 2, 2014 p. 5 Samuel M. Mencoff, a founder of Madison Dearborn Partners, acquired the property later in 2014. History =Wolstenholme Towne= In 1620, Wolstenholme Towne was built on the original land grant on the James River known as Martin's Hundred (in what is now James City County, Virginia). It was owned by an investment group of the Virginia Company of London but was later abandoned after losing many of its citizens in the Indian Massacre of 1622. =Robert Carter= Robert Carter (1663–1732) aka \\"King\\" Carter, was born in Corotoman in Lancaster County, Virginia. Robert was married to Judith Armistead (1665–1699). He bought some of the land that had been Wolstenholme Towne, when his daughter, Elizabeth Carter (1688–1721) married. Robert retained ownership of the property and Elizabeth was entitled to the income produced by the land. =Elizabeth Carter= Elizabeth Carter of Corotoman, Lancaster County, Virginia (1688–1721) was married to Nathaniel Burwell (1680–1721), in 1709. Elizabeth and Nathaniel had a son: Carter Burwell (1716–1777). =Carter Burwell= Carter Burwell (1716–1777) inherited the property from his grandfather, and built the current house on what was by then a estate. Carter married Lucy Ludwell Grymes (1720-?). Lucy was the daughter of John Grymes (1691–1749) and Lucy Ludwell (1698–1748). Carter and Lucy lived in the completed house for six months before Carter died in 1777. Carter had a son, Nathaniel Burwell (1750–1814), who married Susanna Grymes (1752–1788) on November 28, 1772. =Nathaniel Burwell= Colonel Nathaniel Burwell (1750–1814) moved to Carter's Grove in 1771 and raised corn and wheat. Carter's Grove remained in the Burwell family until 1838 when it was sold to Thomas Wynne, grandson of John Wynne (1705-1774). = Edwin G. Booth = Edwin Gilliam Booth (1810-1886) bought the Carter's Grove property in 1879, two years before Americans celebrated the hundredth anniversary of George Washington's victory at Yorktown nearby. Booth renovated the mansion and used it to celebrate a reconciliation theme. A \\"New South\\" advocate and tireless supporter of railroads and new industry, Booth painted the interior red, white and blue and planted a grove of locust trees on the approach from the land. He also added elaborate porches to the mansion's front and rear.Wenger pp. 8-9 A Virginia lawyer, plantation owner and prewar Whig delegate in the Virginia House of Delegates for Nottoway County, Booth Sr. spent much of the war based in Philadelphia with his second wife and providing assistance to Confederate prisoners.W.R. Turner, Old Homes and Families in Nottoway, available at files.usgwarchives.net/nottoway/ A biography is also available online.https://archive.org/stream/lifecharacterofe00dwig/lifecharacterofe00dwig_djvu.txt Both his sons who reached adulthood had been Confederate officers, Archer Jones Booth dying in 1864. Dr. Edwin G. Booth Jr. (1839-1922) survived the war in part because the Confederate ship on which he was a naval surgeon was captured in the Battle of Mobile Bay. He inherited Carter Grove and after the turn of the century bought the George Wythe house in Williamsburg, where he died. His eldest daughter Lucy married Dr. Hugh Smith Cummings, who served as the fifth U.S. Surgeon General (1920-1935). The family's papers are held by the library of the University of Virginia.http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=uva- sc/viu00113.xml;query=Nottoway%20County = T. Percival Bisland = New York businessman and investor in silver mining bought Carter's Grove in 1907. He rehabilitated the property with the assistance of New York architect William W. Tyree, removing one of the Booth era porches, adding window screens, indoor toilets, central heat and a modern kitchen in a flanking dependency joined to the mansion by an enclosed gallery. However, by the fall of 1910, both he and his wife died, so the property languished under absentee owners.Wenger pp. 10-11 =Archibald McCrea= Archibald McCrea, a Pittsburgh industrialist, bought the dilapidated mansion in 1928. He and his wife, Mary \\"Mollie\\" Corling (Johnston) Dunlop McCrea, originally of Petersburg, restored the mansion, and substantially modernized and expanded it under the guidance of Richmond architect Duncan Lee who designed several of the stately homes along Monument Avenue. These renovations significantly changed the appearance of the mansion. As originally built Carter's Grove had a low hip roof similar to Wilton, the McCreas had the roof raised and added dormer windows for additional rooms on the upper floor which gave the house a roofline similar to the mansion at Westover Plantation. Archibald McCrea died in 1937, but his widow lived on at Carter's Grove another 25 years. Soon after her death, it was purchased from her estate and transferred to the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. Colonial Williamsburg Foundation From 1969 to 2007, Carter's Grove was operated by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, and was open to the public for most of those years. In the 1970s, archaeological discoveries uncovered the remains of the circa 1620 Wolstenholme Towne fortified settlement on the property (which was substantially wiped out by the Indian Massacre of 1622, and soon thereafter abandoned). Wolstenholme Towne and slave quarters from a later period were partially restored to represent their respective periods during the almost 400-year history of the property. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1971. and However, while inclusion of a Colonial-era plantation was part of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.'s aspirations for Colonial Williamsburg, the practical challenge with Carter's Grove was that it did not connect directly with the focus on presenting Revolutionary-era Williamsburg and was unable to attract sufficient audiences. Audience development—the appeal to rising generations—is fundamental to the Foundation. On January 2, 2003, the site was closed to the public to save operating funds saying: *The main house at Carter's Grove is furnished as it was in 1928, and does not fit into the time period of Colonial Williamsburg. *Colonial Williamsburg is away and few visitors make the journey to the plantation. *Closer to the downtown Williamsburg area, Colonial Williamsburg operates the Great Hopes Plantation which can easily be reached by the pedestrian traffic from the restored area. An additional hardship in the physical linking between the Historic Area of Colonial Williamsburg and Carter's Grove Plantation was severe weather damage to bucolic Carter's Grove Country Road in James City County during Hurricane Isabel later in 2003. The storm destroyed many trees along the paved road, which is located almost entirely on private property, and required much of it to be semi-permanently closed, pending funding for costly repairs. (Since the hurricane, the Carter's Grove Plantation property continued to be physically accessible by its main entrance on U.S. Route 60 in Grove, Virginia, although still closed to the public). In 2006, completing a four-year evaluation, CW concluded that the best approach to Carter's Grove was to offer it in a fully protected sale. This was to include restrictions to ensure protection of the James River view shed, wetlands and forest, exterior and interior architecture, and archaeological sites on the property as well as prohibit residential and commercial development. On March 31, 2007, Colonial Williamsburg announced that it would be listing Carter's Grove with a real estate company based in Charlottesville, Virginia, for the amount of $19 million. 2007 and beyond Colonial Williamsburg put Carter's Grove up for sale, asking $19 million.DailyPress.Com, March 31, 2007 article was here, may no longer be available on-line On December 19, 2007, it was publicly announced that Carter's Grove, its Georgian style mansion and were acquired for $15.3 million by CNET founder Halsey Minor, a Virginia native and wealthy entrepreneur. Per the press release from the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation the new owner \\"plans to use the mansion as a private residence and use the site as a center for a thoroughbred horse-breeding program.\\" Colonial Williamsburg did not include the contents of the plantation in the sale. The contents, instead, were sold May 17–18, 2008, by Northeast Auctions at auction in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\\"Today's Regional Mystery: Whaddayaknow?\\", DailyPress.Com, April 12, 2008 article is/was on-line here A conservation easement on the mansion and 400 of the is co-held by the Virginia Outdoors Foundation and the Virginia Department of Historic Resources. Carter's Grove Country Road was never fully restored after the damage from Hurricane Isabel in 2003. The easternmost portion remains part of the Carter's Grove proper, subject to land conservation covenants. The portion west to Mounts Bay Road reverted to Kingsmill Properties. The section west of Mounts Bay Road continues to be owned by Colonial Williamsburg. Halsey Minor made no changes to Carter's Grove, and he stopped making mortgage payments in 2010, announcing he owed $12 million in debts. Carter's Grove LLC went into bankruptcy and a federal judge appointed Stan Samorajczyk as trustee to make repairs and sell the property. The leaking roof and inoperable environmental control system had caused deterioration. Thus, in 2013 the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and Virginia Department of Historic Resources supervised repairs by The Roofing & Remodeling Company, including replaced leaky flashing around 40 dormers, six chimneys and eight brick walls, installing new copper flashings in accordance with National Slate Association specifications; replaced flashings on the ridges and hips of the roof, as well as replacing some slates. The Martin's Hundred artifacts had been feared lost, but were saved. In February 2012 Dominion Virginia Power gave notice that the company planned to construct a 7+ mile, 500 kV Extra-High Voltage transmission line from their Surry Nuclear Power Plant in Surry, Virginia, across the James River to a planned switching station, to just east of Carter's Grove. The river crossing will be supported on 17 lattice-type transmission towers, four of which will stand 295' above the river surface, nearly as tall as the Statue of Liberty. This has sparked significant opposition from historic preservationists who are concerned that these towers will mar the view from Carters Grove, and the nearby Colonial Parkway.

The line ran from Moe to the former gold-mining town and popular tourist destination of Walhalla. Construction began in 1904. The line closed in sections from 1944 to 1954.  History  Historic photo of Walhalla railway station ~1910 A special train poses on a bridge of the Long Tunnel Extended timber tramway built to supply wood to the mines at Walhalla. The occasion, a visit by the State Governor in February 1907, shows passengers in ties and hats sitting on empty log trucks, along with the Bagnall 0-4-0ST locomotive and its crew in the foreground. The last of four narrow gauge lines of the Victorian Railways, construction of the Moe–Walhalla railway began in 1904, but was not completed until 1910 due to the difficult mountainous terrain to be contended with. The railway was expected to be a boon for the town, which was in a state of economic and population decline due to gold mining operations becoming increasingly uneconomical, the largest gold mining company closing in 1914. But the arrival of the railway did not save the town. After the closure of the Walhalla mines, substantial timber traffic was carried from sawmills in the Erica area until the late 1940s. Although the line carried numerous special passenger trains to Walhalla in the 1930s and early 1940s, freight and passenger traffic to Walhalla itself declined to almost nothing by 1939. The railway was closed in sections from 1944–54, the section from Platina to Walhalla closing in April 1944 and the final section from Moe to Erica eventually closing on 25 June 1954. The tracks and buildings were removed by 1960, leaving only the roadbed and a number of bridges. The Thomson River Railway Bridge is listed on the Register of the National Estate. The centre span was part of a road bridge over the Murray River at Tocumwal (NSW). The station building at Walhalla was relocated to the Melbourne suburban station of Hartwell.  Reconstruction  In recognition of the outstanding tourist potential of the railway, a number of attempts were made to reopen the line for tourist traffic, but none were successful until the early 1990s. The Walhalla Railway Taskforce was formed in 1991, becoming the Walhalla Goldfields Railway, Inc., in 1993. By this time the roadbed was a totally overgrown jungle of blackberries and heavy scrub, with numerous sections of the trackbed having collapsed and all being derelict except one of the bridges. Restoration began with the establishment of Thomson Station and its accompanying yard on the site of an original station. The railway commenced operations in April 1994, within the Thomson Station yard. Gradually the line extended, first over the nationally heritage-classified Thomson River Bridge in October 1994, pushing up the Stringers Creek Gorge to Happy Creek. This became the terminus for the line until the six bridges in the last kilometre into the Walhalla Station yard were completed, this section of line opening on 15 March 2002. The operating line is in length.

Formed in Glasgow in 1838, it is the smallest of the three Scottish banks. Independent until it was purchased by Midland Bank in 1920, it formed part of the National Australia Bank Group (NAB) between 1987 and 2016. Clydesdale Bank was divested from National Australia Bank in early 2016 and its holding company CYBG plc, trades on the London and Sydney stock exchanges. In June 2018, it was announced that Clydesdale Bank's holding company CYBG would acquire Virgin Money for £1.7 billion in an all-stock deal, and that the Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank brands would be phased out in favour of retaining Virgin's brand. CYBG plc's banking businesses, Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank, Virgin Money and B, currently operate as trading divisions of Clydesdale Bank plc under its banking licence. As with two other Scottish banks, the Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale Bank retains the right to issue its own banknotes. History = Establishment = In March 1838, an advertisement appeared for a new joint stock banking company in Glasgow, the Clydesdale Banking Company. It was to be \\"chiefly a local bank – having few branches – but correspondents everywhere\\" though it was conceded that a branch in Edinburgh would be necessary. The Bank duly opened for business in both cities in May 1838.J M Reid, The History of the Clydesdale Bank 1838–1938 (1938) Checkland described the Bank as the creation of \\"a group of Glasgow businessmen of middling order, liberal radicals…who were active in the government and charities of the city.\\"S G Checkland, Scottish Banking a History 1695–1973 (1975) The driving figure behind the formation of the bank was James Lumsden, a stationer by business, a councillor, police commissioner and, later, Lord Provost of Glasgow. Another member of the founding committee, Henry Brock, became the Bank's first manager. Brock came of a merchant family, was an accountant and one of the founders of the Glasgow Savings Bank. Despite the declaration in the advertisement, in the year after formation the Bank opened three Glasgow branches as well as its first country branches in Campbeltown and Falkirk; a further seven had been opened by 1844. These were supplemented by the acquisition of the Greenock Union Bank; formed in 1840, it had four branches in the Glasgow hinterland. =Expansion= A former branch of Clydesdale Bank in Leith The Clydesdale Bank/Banca Dhail Chluaidh Stornoway branch bearing a bilingual sign in English and Gaelic Following the purchase of the Greenock Union, there was little change in the structure of the Bank and there were still only 13 branches in 1857. In that year, Clydesdale became the first Scottish bank to produce a printed balance sheet, and it showed assets of £2.7 million and net profits of £70,000. The public disclosure of its strength stood it in good stead, for only months later the Western Bank of Scotland closed its doors, followed the next day by the first closure of the City of Glasgow Bank. Clydesdale gained not only customers but 13 branches from the Western. A few months later came the acquisition of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Bank, which had been weakened by the same economic disturbances. The Edinburgh & Leith Bank, as it was originally, had been formed in 1838 \\"for the benefit of the 'industrious middle classes'\\" and it had bought the Dumfries- based Southern Bank of Scotland in 1842 and the Glasgow Joint Stock Bank in 1844, the latter leading to the change of name to Edinburgh & Glasgow Bank. Poor lending in the 1845–47 period, particularly to Australia, dogged the Bank for the next ten years and it was eventually taken over by the Clydesdale for a nil consideration; Clydesdale retained 19 of its 27 offices. Five years later, in 1863, Clydesdale acquired the more successful Eastern Bank of Scotland, like Clydesdale, also founded in 1838. Based in Dundee it was to have two separate offices and boards, one in Dundee, the other Edinburgh. Before opening for business it acquired the Dundee Commercial Bank to serve as its Dundee office. Difficulties with the two boards working together led to the Edinburgh bank being wound up and the Eastern became an essentially Dundee bank; its acquisition gave Clydesdale its first interests north of the River Tay. Much of the growth in the Bank's network had come from acquisitions and the management remained cautious regarding direct branch expansion. However, in 1865, a committee was formed to look at prospects and 16 branches were opened in two years. In 1874 the Clydesdale went south of the border and opened three branches in Cumberland but this was seen as following existing trade rather than making a specific attempt to enter the English market. Indeed, Clydesdale was one of the last Scottish banks to acquire a London office (1877). In 1878, the City of Glasgow Bank failed for the second time, leading again to an increase in Clydesdale's deposits and the acquisition of nine of the Glasgow branches. The scale of the collapse led to further debate on the desirability of limited liability and, following legislation in 1879 (allowing fixed uncalled liability on shares), Clydesdale Bank registered as a limited liability company in 1882. Reid described the period 1890–1914 as \\"the tranquil years\\", but that did not preclude steady expansion of the branch network – from 92 to 153. That was to mark the end of Clydesdale's independent existence. In 1917 the bank was approached by London City and Midland (later Midland Bank) and, although initially resisted, Clydesdale Bank was sold in 1920. However, it continued to operate independently and was always referred to as an affiliate, not a subsidiary. The Glasgow banks suffered more than others in the depressed economy of the inter-war period and from being the largest lender in Scotland in 1920, it fell to fifth place by 1939. Despite this, the Bank continued to open branches, particularly in areas enjoying export growth, and the network increased from 158 in 1919 to 205 in 1939. =The Midland Era= Midland had also acquired the North of Scotland Bank in 1923 but the Aberdeen management had fiercely resisted any attempt to merge with Clydesdale. However, the changed competitive market after the Second World War meant that the two banks could not remain separate and in 1950 they were amalgamated to become the Clydesdale and North of Scotland Bank (soon shortened to Clydesdale Bank). Clydesdale had 189 branches and the North of Scotland 161, covering 221 towns between them. Of the eight Scottish banks, Clydesdale had been the third-largest by deposits, the North being the smallest. The merged bank became Scotland's largest in terms of deposits, advances and branches. However, by 1969, mergers elsewhere had reduced the number of Scottish banks to three with Clydesdale now being the smallest. Midland needed to rationalise the enlarged Clydesdale but faced resistance. Midland also needed additional capital and its solution to both challenges was to sell Clydesdale (along with Midland's Irish subsidiaries) to National Australia Bank in 1987. =National Australia Bank Group= A Clydesdale Bank branch in Kilmarnock In 1989 National Australia Bank bought the Clydesdale bank for £420 million. Fred Goodwin, an accountant working for Touche Ross, worked on the acquisition. In 1995 Goodwin, with little direct banking experience, was appointed deputy CEO of the Clydesdale until 1997. During this period Goodwin earned the nickname \\"Fred the shred\\" for his aggressive manner in dealing with staff. In September 2013 the bank was fined £8.9 million after miscalculating the mortgage repayments of more than 42,000 customers. In March 2015 the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee said in a conduct report that they had evidence that the Clydesdale Bank had mis-sold unregulated tailored business loans and that the bank's own internal review of the mis- selling had serious shortcomings and lacked transparency. In April 2015 the Clydesdale was fined £20.7 million the largest of its type imposed by the Financial Conduct Authority for the mis-selling of PPI insurance. =CYBG plc= National Australia Bank confirmed in October 2014 that it planned to exit the UK, and was considering a number of options for Yorkshire and Clydesdale Banks, including a possible stock market listing. In October 2015, NAB confirmed it would float Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in February 2016 through an initial public offering, with an aim of raising £2 billion. The bank's newly formed holding company CYBG plc began conditional trading on the LSE and the Australian Securities Exchange on 3 February, and began trading unconditionally from 8 February. The flotation share price of 180p meant that the National Australia Bank made an estimated loss of £2 billion on the sale and had to make provisions of around £1.7 billion to cover claims for mis-selling of products. In March 2016 CYBG announced the closure of 28 branches as a cost saving move. The following month, CYBG announced the closure of a further 9 Clydesdale branches and 17 Yorkshire Bank branches. =Acquisition of Virgin Money= In June 2018, CYBG plc announced it would acquire Virgin Money for £1.7 billion in an all-stock deal. Almost one in six employees are expected to lose their jobs in the takeover, which will result in retail customers being migrated to the Virgin Money brand over three years. The acquisition of Virgin Money was completed on 15 October 2018. In June 2019, CYBG plc announced its plans to consolidate its businesses under the Virgin Money brand. Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and B, which exist as trading divisions of Clydesdale Bank plc will begin to use the Virgin Money name in late 2019 with full use planned by early 2021. In preparation for rebranding, the existing Virgin Money plc was merged into the existing Clydesdale Bank plc on 21 October 2019.

Features = Hierarchal scopes = TextMate allows users to create their own arbitrarily complex syntax highlighting modes by using a modified version of the Apple ASCII property list format to define language grammars. These grammars allow nesting rules to be defined using the Oniguruma regular expression library, and then assigned specific “scopes”: compound labels which identify them for coloration. Therefore, each point of a document is assigned one or more scopes, which define where in the document the point is, how it should be colored, and what the behavior of TextMate should be at that point. For instance, the title of one of the links in the “External links” section has the scope: text.html.mediawiki markup.list.mediawiki meta.link.inline.external.mediawiki string.other.link.title.external.mediawiki This scope tells us that we are looking at a link title within a link within a list within a MediaWiki document. TextMate themes can mark up any scope, at varying levels of precision. For instance, one theme may decide to color every constant (\`constant.*\`) identically, while another may decide that numerical constants (\`constant.numeric.*\`) should be colored differently than escaped characters (\`constant.character.escape.*\`). The hierarchal scope syntax allows language authors and theme authors various levels of coverage, so that each one can choose to opt for simplicity or comprehensiveness, as desired. =Commands= TextMate supports user-defined and user-editable commands that are interpreted by bash or the interpreter specified with a shebang. Commands can be sent many kinds of input by TextMate (the current document, selected text, the current word, etc.) in addition to environment variables and their output can be similarly be handled by TextMate in a variety of ways. At its most simple, a command might receive the selected text, transform it, and re- insert it into the document replacing the selection. Other commands might simply show a tool tip, create a new document for their output, or display it as a web page using TextMate's built-in HTML renderer. Many language-specific bundles such as bash, PHP or Ruby contain commands for compiling and/or running the current document or project. In many cases the STDOUT and STDERR of the code's process will be displayed in a window in TextMate. =Snippets= At their simplest, TextMate “snippets” are pieces of text which can be inserted into the document at the current location via a context- sensitive key stroke or tab completion. Snippets are \\"intelligent\\", supporting \\"tab stops\\" dynamic updating, access to environment variables, and the ability to run inline scripts. This allows complicated behaviors. Tab stops can be cycled through using the “tab” key and support default text, drop-downs, to complete elements of the snippet. The results of these tab stops can be dynamically changed in another portion of the snippet, as the user fills in a stop. TextMate environment variables can be used, supporting information about the current scope, line number, or author name, etc. Snippets also have the ability to run inline shell scripts. =Bundles= TextMate language grammars, snippets, macros, commands, and templates can be grouped into “bundles” of functionality. Any snippet, macro, or command can be executed by pressing a keyboard shortcut, by typing a particular word and then pressing the “tab” key (so-called “tab triggers”), or by selecting the command from a menu. Tab triggers are particularly useful; the combination of tab triggers and snippets greatly eases coding in verbose languages, or languages with commonly typed patterns. Snippets, macros, and commands can be limited to a particular scope, so that for instance the “close html tag” command does not work in a python script, freeing up that keyboard shortcut to be used for something else. This allows individual languages, and even individual scopes, to override built-in commands such as “Reformat Paragraph” with more specialized versions. Even special keys such as the return key and spacebar can be overridden. A Subversion repository is available containing many more bundles than are shipped with the editor package, for everything from Markdown to blogging to MIPS assembly language.For information on getting more bundles, see the relevant section in the TextMate manual. =Project management= Several documents or folders can be opened at once in a TextMate project window, which provides a drawer along its side listing file and folder names, and a series of tabs across the top. In TextMate 1.5, this drawer provides a means for users to organize files and folders from across the file system, as well as the ability to create virtual folders for further organization. This feature was removed from TextMate 2 and replaced with an ordinary file browser. Search and replace can be undertaken across an entire project, and commands can interact with the selected files or folders in the drawer. Bundles for CVS, Subversion, darcs, and other revision control systems allow TextMate to manage versioned code. =Other features= TextMate has many features common to programming editors: * Folding code sections can be used to hide areas of a document not currently being edited, for a more compact view of code structure or to avoid distraction. The sections to be folded can be selected by hand, or the structure of the document itself can be used to determine foldings. * Regular-expression–based search and replace speeds complicated text manipulations. TextMate uses the Oniguruma regular expression library developed by K. Kosako. * A function pop-up provides a list of sections or functions in the current document. * Clipboard history allows users to cut many sections of text at once, and then paste them. * Column editing mode allows adding the same text to several rows of text, and is very useful for manipulating tabular data. * \\"rmate\\" support for launching textmate as editor for files from remote servers - much improved over work-arounds needed in version 1 How to edit files from my FTP Server as a TextMate project. TextMate Wiki - FAQ: Projects In addition, TextMate supports features to integrate well with the OS X graphical environment: * Clipboard graphical history supports pasting from previous copies, including prior launches. * Find and replace support an analogous graphical history. * Editing is further enhanced by multiple cursors (insertion points), and the ability to extend the current selection to additional instances creating multiple cursors. * A WebKit-based HTML view window shows live updates as an HTML document is edited. * VoiceOver and Zoom users can use TextMate thanks to its accessibility support.Support accessibility in text view - VoiceOver and Zoom. GitHub pull request =Limitations= TextMate does have a few limitations when compared to other editors in its class: * Because TextMate is not tightly coupled to a scripting language, as Emacs is to Emacs Lisp, it is impossible for users to have complete control over the program's configuration and behavior. Allan Odgaard explained his thoughts on the subject in an email to the TextMate mailing list, advocating for \\"platform-recommended\\" solutions.Allan Odgaard. “Re: Changing cursor position from command”. TextMate mailing list. 14 February 2007. * No built-in HTML validator — because TextMate uses the W3C validator for HTML validation, users must have an active network connection to validate HTML using the standard functionality. * Despite its substantial support for macros, commands, and snippets, TextMate has no built-in support for code- hinting or guided code-completion, so text editors that support these features may prove to be a better choice when learning the syntax of a new language or coding in verbose languages. * TextMate is not binary safe. It is explicitly text only, and does not guarantee that arbitrary binary data in a file will be preserved through a load/save cycle, regardless of whether that data is edited. Community TextMate has a community of users, who contribute to the git repository of open-source TextMate bundles.Manual.macromates.com The TextMate wiki has hints and tips, feature suggestions, and links to external resources. A ticket system exists for filing bug reports and feature requests, and an IRC channel () is usually active. TextMate bundles exist to support code written in many dozens of programming languages.

Cricketing career Born 3 May 1904 in Penarth, Glamorgan, Austin Matthews began playing cricket at a young age with the Cardiff clubBrief profile of Austin Matthews and with a natural height advantage he showed promise both as a fast-medium bowler and a hard-hitting batsman. However, from 1926 he moved to Northampton and thus became qualified for Northamptonshire. Competing for a place with Nobby Clark and medium-pacer Albert Thomas, Matthews played fairly frequently in 1928 and regularly from 1929 but in fact in these initial years fared better as a batsman than bowler, hitting 116 against Warwickshire at EdgbastonWarwickshire v Northamptonshire in 1929 and falling only 45 short of a four-figure aggregate – which in fact placed him fourth in batting for the county.Batting for Northamptonshire in County Championship 1929 However, in 1930 he did not reach fifty,Batting for Northamptonshire in County Championship 1930 and subsequently his batting declined to the point that from 1935 he did not once reach fiftyFirst Class Batting in Each Season and was regarded purely as a bowler. Although Matthews took 93 wickets in the dry summer of 1933 and formed one of the better new ball bowling partnerships with Clark, his very poor record in 1935 suggested his talent lacked depth. However, in 1936, as Northamptonshire moved into the deepest abyss of form of any county side, Wisden said that “For sheer consistency, Matthews stood alone” and that he had had one of his best seasons for the County.Brookes, Wilfred H. (editor); John Wisden's Cricketer's Almanack; Seventy-Fourth Edition (1937), Part II, p. 427. Then in 1937, Matthews became coach at Stowe School and was not expected to play any first-class cricket. However, when Jack Mercer was injured, Maurice Turnbull asked him to help Glamorgan and he accepted. In Matthews’ third match for the county, he took fourteen Sussex wickets for 132 runs on a batsman's pitch at Hastings, and two weeks later was a controversial choice for the third Test match against New Zealand at The Oval, making his debut alongside Denis Compton. He took two wickets (Walter Hadlee in both innings), made two runs and took one catch, and was never picked again. However, in contrast to his average of 26.53 in ten seasons for Northamptonshire, Matthews in 1937 headed the first-class bowling averages and came close to repeating this feat in 1938 and 1946, when he equalled his 1933 haul of 93 wickets and took seven for twelve on a treacherous pitch against Somerset.Preston, Hubert (editor); Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Eighty-Fourth Edition (1947), p. 262. For Glamorgan, Austin Matthews took 225 wickets at the low average of 15.88 runs per wicket, and after World War II he also coached Cambridge University. In later years he occasionally wrote for cricket publications because of his strong criticism of post-war coaching methods. Other sports An all-round sportsman, Matthews played rugby union for Penarth RFC and later Northampton RFC. In 1929, during his time with Penarth, Matthews was a final Welsh rugby trialist and his cap is held in the Penarth Club's archive. Matthews captained Northampton RFC between 1935 and 1937. His Northampton cap is also lodged with the Penarth RFC archive together with the cap gained by Matthews' father, Frederick, as a final Welsh rugby trialist in 1896. Matthews also represented Wales at table tennis. He died 29 July 1977 in Penrhyn Bay, Llandudno, Caernarvonshire.

The German original title is Jakob der Lügner (). Becker was awarded the Heinrich-Mann Prize (1971) and the Charles Veillon Prize (1971) after the publication of his bestseller. The novel was made into two films, Jacob the Liar (1975) by Frank Beyer, which was nominated for Best foreign language film at the Academy Awards, and Jakob the Liar (1999), a Hollywood production starring Robin Williams. Jacob the Liar was first translated into English by Melvin Kornfeld in 1975, but without Becker's input. A new English translation was made in 1990 by Leila Vennewitz and Becker, published in 1996 it won the Helen and Kurt Wolff Translator's Prize. Plot summary The novel follows the life of the Jewish protagonist Jacob Heym in the ghetto of Łódź, Poland during the German occupation of World War II. Jacob met an 8-year-old girl named Lina, whose parents were both killed and who is hidden from the Germans after escaping from the camp transport train. While walking around the ghetto near the time of curfew, Jacob is suddenly stopped by a seemingly bored German officer on a patrol. The officer pretends that the Jewish curfew of 8 pm has already passed, and sends the hapless Jacob to the police station. Jacob obeys him submissively and is followed by the sentinel's flashlight. He arrives at the station where he hears radio news reporting about the approach of the Red Army. Miraculously, Jacob is released since the sentinel was playing a practical joke on him and it was not yet curfew. The first Jew to leave that station alive, Jacob cannot believe his luck. Both this and the radio broadcast fill him with hope. The next day he is working with his partner Mischa, who wants to risk his life by stealing potatoes. At the last moment, Jacob impedes his attempt and gives him the good news about the Russians, but Mischa is skeptical - so Jacob, to give Mischa hope, tells him he has a hidden radio, otherwise forbidden in the ghetto. Jacob lies for the first time by pretending that he possesses a radio since he figures that nobody would believe him if he tells them he saw the precinct from inside. The question raised in the reader's mind is \\"Does he act responsibly by lying, even if he has only good intentions?\\" Jacob has enlivened Mischa who immediately goes to Rosa Frankfurter's parents to convey the word. Although he promised Jacob not to mention his name when spreading the news, Mischa breaks his word. Rosa's skeptical father Felix is enraged by the dangerous news Mischa is spreading without proof. Felix destroys a radio he is hiding in the basement. Mischa eventually spreads the lie out: Jacob possesses a radio. Jacob is now forced to become creative in order to maintain the lie. Now that the neighbors believe he has a radio, he has to provide new items of fictional news each day in order to help maintain the peace and hope, and prevent despair from returning to the ghetto. Striving to propagate some real news, he decides to steal a newspaper from an \\"Aryan water closet\\", which Jews are strictly prohibited from entering. While he is in it, a nervous guard comes close to the toilet but Jacob's friend Kowalsky distracts the watchman's attention by knocking over boxes and saves Jacob's life. The next day Herschel Schtamm, a usually fearful and timid man, hears the voices of deportees coming out of a wagon. Intent on giving them hope by telling them the news, he gathers his courage and approaches the wagon but is seen and shot by a watchman. Jacob feels responsible for Schtamm's death. He comes home to find Lina looking for the radio while he was gone. He tells her to stay out of his room but realizes that hearing the radio will give her much needed hope. From another room where Lina can not see him, Jacob imitates the sounds of a radio- show, emulating the voice of Winston Churchill, telling her the metaphorical story of a princess who became ill because nobody could provide her a cloud. The princess was cured when a gardener brought her a cloud made out of cotton wool, because she thought in reality that was what clouds were. It implicates the question of authentic versus perceived need, and of course the question about the imagined world created by the lies of Jacob inside the ghetto. Just as the princess became healthy after she received the \\"fake\\" cloud, the hope of the Jews is inspired by artificial truth. Over time, the lie becomes cumbersome and inconvenient to Jacob, and the attention tedious. He pretends that the radio is becoming defective but is still swamped by people who are either begging for news, inculpating him, or pretending friendship to get access to the news. Jacob cannot stand this pressure and in a moment of weakness confesses everything to Kowalsky, who reassures him that he understands everything and would have acted exactly in the same way, and that Kowalsky will not bother Jacob again with any questions. The novel has two endings. The narrator thinks that there should be an independent ending based on what really happened, but he also wants to corroborate that he is trying to reach the reader emotionally, and thus proposes a second ending. However both endings are equally powerful in their own ways. The fictitious ending Jakob is killed while attempting to escape from the ghetto. Immediately after, as if Jacob's death-shot is the opening of the battle for the city, the Russians arrive to liberate them all. It is ambiguous why Jacob was trying to escape: to save himself and abandon his people to their fate; or to get first-hand information about the course of the war and return to the ghetto, thus redeeming himself for the lie about the radio. The true ending Kowalsky hangs himself shortly after Jacob's confession about the radio. Everyone is deported to the death camps. Analysis The name \\"Jacob\\" is related to Jewish history and culture. In the biblical story of Jacob, from the Book of Genesis, Jacob tells a lie to his father Isaac, in order to steal a blessing meant for his brother Esau. According to classic Jewish texts, Jacob lived a life that paralleled the descent of his offspring, the Jewish people, into the darkness of exile. The novel also challenged East German literary norms by depicting fictitious events in World War II but without open resistance to Nazism. Rather, the resistance offered is in the desire to live. Also, the ending in which Soviet soldiers liberate the ghetto is described as the fictitious one, while the transport of the ghetto inhabitants to their death, the likelier outcome during World War II, is described as the \\"real\\" one, another challenge to GDR literary norms.Paul O'Doherty, The Portrayal of Jews in GDR Prose Fiction, Amsterdam 1997, pp.149-50.

Biography Although Piero Fornasetti's works are produced as individual pieces, he was an important figure in Italian industrial design culture, to such an extent that his name is now better known on the international design scene than in any other fields. Fornasetti was, however, an artist actively involved in a variety of aesthetic disciplines, including painting, drawing, graphic design and product design: “It's rare to see such happiness in the act of making and producing, such a sweeping vision, free of any shadow of conflict in the moment of creation: a serene epiphany, an outpouring of inventions.\\"Patrick Mauriés, “Fornasetti. Practical Madness,\\" Thames and Hudson Ltd, 1991, p.14 In the course of his artistic career he created over 13,000 works and he was responsible for one of the largest outputs of objects and furniture of the 20th century, thanks less to the number of copies of individual pieces than to the diversity of his decorations. The sources of inspiration for his art (he began as a painter) were Piero della Francesca, Giotto, paintings from Pompeii, Renaissance frescoes and metaphysical painting, from which he never stopped drawing inspiration, making virtuosity the distinctive feature of his own art. In the Fifties, Piero Fornasetti founded the design and decorative arts atelier in Milan that bears his name, Fornasetti, which today, under the artistic direction of his son Barnaba Fornasetti, is known throughout the world. One decisive factor in starting this activity was meeting Gio Ponti, who pushed him to develop his intuition: to produce everyday objects enriched by the kind of decoration that would bring art into ordinary people's homes. Thus the Fornasetti atelier was born. Today internationally renowned for the production of finely crafted furniture and accessories, it is a supreme example of the principle of \\"practical madness\\", where creativity is in perfect harmony with and inextricably linked to the utility of the object and the technical process through which it is made tangible. Precious porcelains, sophisticated pieces of furniture and furnishing accessories form the heart of the incredible variety of its output, which spans art and design: conversation pieces, visions to contemplate, but at the same time objects to be used. \\"It has always been my notion not to make one-off pieces, but series of items\\": a true statement of principle. Fornasetti justifies it, depending on the circumstances, by referring to democratic principles, since beauty, by its very nature, is intended for all and must not be reserved for a limited circle of initiates, or by referring to the technical side of his work, since the printing of a motif, the common denominator of all his creations, cannot help but be enriched, refined and varied in intensity through multiple, random mutations, as the work proceeds. Out of all Fornasetti's ideas, one has imposed itself particularly powerfully due to the insistence of the infinite \\"variations\\" to which it has been subjected, so much so that it has become his true brand. This is the woman's face that is the subject of the series \\"Tema e Variazioni\\" (\\"Theme and Variations\\"), of which over four hundred versions exist today, with potentially more to come. As an artist who was ahead of his time, establishing himself as a significant figure in contemporary culture, Piero Fornasetti has the merit of having contributed, with his work, to renewing taste and creating a unique and immediately recognisable visual language. Postmodern before the term existed, \\"the magician of precious and precise magic\\", according to Pablo Neruda's celebrated definition, Piero Fornasetti moved from canvas to page to furnished space, confusing perspectives, transfiguring space, reinventing time and giving life to a form of decoration that could be printed or deployed on any surface, from walls to display structures, from furniture to everyday objects, from books to posters to theatre sets. \\"All my work is based on drawing;\\" stated Piero himself, \\"drawing understood as a discipline, a way of living and organising one's own existence. (…) The artist must put things in order to create another world, a second nature, and as a way of continuously studying things and their essence...\\": this is the model of Fornasetti who, as Bruno Munari liked to say,\\" can only be measured by the yardstick of Fornasetti”. =Childhood and training= Piero Fornasetti was born in 1913 into a well-heeled, middle-class family in Milan and spent his childhood in the apartment building built by his father Pietro, in the Città Studi district, where at the time the city ended and the fields began. The first child in a wealthy bourgeois family, he found himself facing a predetermined future: his father, a Lombard entrepreneur, had decided that he would follow in his footsteps, taking on the family business. Contrary to family expectations, at the age of ten Piero was already drawing and displaying an innate artistic inclination: with practice, he began to produce landscapes, still lives, hot air balloons, mysterious ladies and architectural elements, many of the visual themes that would later recur in his work. \\"I will never forget the thrill when, as a boy, one summer morning on the lake, for the first time my pen began to trace the outline of a leg, then a body, then a face. I was astonished, ecstatic and in awe of this miracle, and am still always amazed every time at this blossoming of the image I have inside me, emerging all by itself from the page... \\".Barnaba Fornasetti, texts of Ginevra Quadrio Curzio, “Piero Fornasetti. One hundred years of practical madness,\\" Corraini Edizioni, Triennale Design Museum 2013, p.37 Piero quickly displayed a tenacious and unshakeable character, showing his determination to pursue his very specific aspiration. In 1932, Piero enrolled at the Accademia di Brera, but was expelled two years later for insubordination. He later enrolled in the Scuola Superiore of Arts Applied to Industry at Castello Sforzesco, also in Milan. Irremediably rebellious, he was unable to adhere to the dogma of any school. Endlessly curious, he continued to study, read, browse magazines, appropriating information and constantly expanding the horizons of his knowledge. =The Thirties, the art printworks= From the early Thirties, Piero began a phase of tireless study of every engraving and printing technique. Thanks to his constant practice and great technical skill, he was able to work with the greatest artists of the time, printing artist books and lithographs for them. From Alberto Savinio to Fabrizio Clerici, from Giorgio de Chirico to Massimo Campigli, from Lucio Fontana to Cascella to Berman, from Raffaele Carrieri and Carlo Bo: the Fornasetti Art Printshop became a benchmark or many artists of his generation. \\"He was the first to print lithographs by De Chirico in Milan, some considerable time ago\\" - wrote Raffaele Carrieri in \\"Epoca\\" in 1978. Through this constant experimentation, Fornasetti invented a printing method that allowed him to obtain unique graphic effects on silk scarves. In 1933, he proposed a series for the Milan Triennale V, which was rejected because it was off-topic but earned him the attention of Gio Ponti, whom he would meet in 1940 (on the occasion of the VII Triennale) and with whom years later he would enter into a very close creative partnership. The two of them were aligned not only on the definition and importance of decoration and the cultural heritage that it implies, but also on the whole notion of architecture, the relationship between man and his environment. =The Forties, the war and working with Gio Ponti= With his special culture and passion for paper, inks and lettering, from the early Forties onwards Piero Fornasetti produced a vast series of limited edition graphic works, with a refined and very precise style: calendars, Christmas gifts, advertising images, theatre programs, posters and magazine covers (including some for Domus, curated at the time by Gio Ponti). Editorial concepts designed and produced on commission or for pure pleasure, for clients, acquaintances or friends, which express - in various forms and to the highest standards - his notion of formal elegance, his sense of humour, his love of information, and his style as a communicator. During these years (along with Filiberto Sbardella, Aligi Sassu and others), he produced various sketches and drawings for the Esino Lario School of Tapestry. In 1940 he began to publish his own work in the design and architecture magazine Domus, edited at the time by Gio Ponti, and in Stile. From 1940 to 1942 he designed a series of almanacs commissioned by Gio Ponti himself. The first three almanacs, small publications designed and printed using previously unpublished themes, which started life as Christmas gifts, would inspire a longer series beginning immediately after the war and ending in 1950. On paper, intuitions were born, themes emerged, and characters were defined for a variety of subjects. And each image encapsulated a way of seeing and responding to the stresses of the time: at the origin of Fornasetti's great success, and its furniture, objects, and rooms, was that production of graphic images and drawings that attest to the originality and the true innovative scope of his style. Called up on the outbreak of war, Piero Fornasetti initially managed to remain in Milan by getting the job of decorating the Sant'Ambrogio barracks. Later, in 1943, he took refuge in Switzerland, where he continued his artistic research and produced posters and lithographs for theatrical events and magazines. This period represented an unprecedented opportunity, during which he created oil portraits, watercolours, and drawings in ink, Indian ink and ballpoint pen, devoting himself to investigating intriguing points of view, mostly of the human body, on which he would later draw in his production of decorative graphic arts. During this period he created the sets for Albert Camus's Caligula directed by Giorgio Strehler. This is the moment when the relationship with Gio Ponti also became closer. Their work together, which, on his return to Milan, would produce important concepts of interiors and furnishing, design and decoration for houses, apartments, ship cabins or cinema auditoria, was so felicitous that it would eventually induce Gio Ponti to declare: \\"If one day they write my life story, they'll have to call one of the chapters Passion for Fornasetti.\\" =The Fifties, Lina Cavalieri and the \\"Tema e Variazioni\\" series= With the advent of the Fifties, the creative duo of Gio Ponti and Piero Fornasetti were able to put into practice their point of view: a home interior and furnishing style that they had long been promoting in theory. A method that envisages \\"the specific functionality of rooms and furniture\\", \\"the simplicity and sincerity of forms and materials\\", the worship of \\"sun, air, and light\\", and \\"unity of aspiration for all social categories\\". At the start of those years the pair designed and decorated the “Architettura” trumeau, which was then exhibited at the Triennale IX in 1951 and which in 1998, over thirty years after its original conception, was auctioned at Christies for the sum of fifteen thousand dollars, a record at the time. An exemplary fusion of modern and ancient, rationalism and the Renaissance, architecture and furniture, structure and decoration, this piece of furniture has inevitably become an icon of Italy's design brilliance in the interwar years of economic boom. Contrasting the wasted space, unused rooms and inadequate services of the traditional house with the reduced living spaces of the modern age, the two furnished and decorated the Casino of Sanremo (1950), an entire apartment that became famous as a symbol of their style, Casa Lucano (1951), and the first- class cabins and lounges of transatlantic liners like the Andrea Doria (1952). In 1952 Piero Fornasetti began work on what would later become his most famous and iconic series: \\"Tema e Variazioni\\" (\\"Theme and Variations\\"). Starting from the portrait of a woman, he began a pictorial quest that was to accompany him throughout his life and to which Alberto Moravia dedicated a text. The timeless face is that of Lina Cavalieri, an opera singer who lived at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries and who was renowned at the time as \\"the most beautiful woman in the world\\": a true archetype of enigmatic, classical beauty. This work, which so captivated Henry Miller that he used it on the cover of his autobiography \\"My Life and Times\\", continues to be reproduced today by his son Barnaba Fornasetti on a series of everyday objects, not only porcelain, but also furniture and accessories, in endless new variations. In 2016, the first 100 illustrations from the series were collected in a completely handmade, prestigious, limited edition volume. During the same year, the series entered the world of theatre, becoming part of the sets of \\"Don Giovanni\\", the opera by W.A. Mozart presented and produced by Fornasetti. Over the same period, in parallel with the development of his personal iconography applied to everyday objects, Piero Fornasetti continued unceasingly in his process of artistic reflection. 1958 saw the creation of \\"Stanza metafisica\\" (\\"Metaphysical Room\\"), a work composed of thirty-two hinged, wheelless doors, designed to form a congenial space for meditation, an early example of an artistic installation, first presented at the exhibition at the Tea Centre in London. =The Sixties and Seventies, a new cultural climate= At the end of the Sixties, the cultural climate changed. A strong ideological rationalism and the belief in purely functional forms took hold in architecture, applied arts and design. From this perspective, decoration was considered pointless and affected frippery. There appeared to be no place for craftsmanship, given the unchallengeable demands of the market and industrial production. While Gio Ponti kept up with the times, Fornasetti seemed to entrench himself disdainfully behind his own certainties and principles. The relationship between the two became colder, to such an extent that Ponti came to reproach Fornasetti for being unable to reinvent himself. In this same period, Piero succeeded in shaping the conceptual side of his approach, inaugurating in the Seventies the space that offered him a way of giving continuity to his work with other instruments. In 1970, together with a group of friends, he ran the Galleria dei Bibliofili, where he exhibited both his own work and that of contemporary artists. Piero began painting again. The figures, heads, faces, and bodies made of bottles or fruits remained a part of his new pictorial style, alongside abstract compositions that highlighted an unexpected fascination for layers, interactions of colour and different techniques. =The Eighties, rediscovery and the London gallery \\"Themes and Variations\\"= After the death of Gio Ponti (in 1979), in 1980 the \\"Themes & Variations\\" gallery opened in London, on the initiative of Liliane Fawcett and Giuliana Medda. This revived interest in his work overseas too, where he was already widely known. Fornasetti's oeuvre began to be rediscovered beyond the ideological contrast of form/function and ornament/pointlessness, and in 1987 Piero collaborated with Patrick Mauriés on the first monograph on his work, accompanied by an introduction by Ettore Sottsass. The book was published posthumously - Piero Fornasetti died in 1988 during a minor operation in hospital. After Piero's death, in October 1988, his son Barnaba Fornasetti carried on with a part of his father's activity. The Fornasetti Style \\"The thing that always strikes me most in Piero Fornasetti's work is theatricality. Any piece of furniture is never just a piece of furniture: it is a piece of scenery, a decor, a set. An object that evokes a story, which offers a setting for a story,\\" says Silvana Annicchiarico, who, as Director of the Triennale Design Museum, decided in 2013 to dedicate a first retrospective to him, which from Milan then went on tour to Paris, at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, and Seoul, at the Dongdaemun Design Plaza. Piero Fornasetti himself explained this aspect of his work as follows: \\"The public explained to me that what I was doing was something more than decoration. It was an invitation to imagine, to think, to escape from the things that surround us, which are too mechanised and inhuman. They were a passport to the realm of imagination.\\" Although he nurtured a fierce desire for independence, and was keen to declare the uniqueness of his creation, we can only imagine him as an omnivorous reader and always well informed about the artistic developments of his time. In his endless body of work, one can trace imagery ranging from the Neo-baroque and the Neo-romantic to the surreal and the metaphysical, as well as an awareness of Italy's rich artistic tradition, married to a profound passion for the outdated and the anachronistic. His is a complete oeuvre, drawing on history and modernity, architectural epochs and artistic movements. It appears innovative, or at least evocative, because it is based on original, unexpected appropriations and recontextualisations of styles and trends. Fornasetti feels close to the discipline described by Eugen Herrigel in his little book \\"Zen and archery\\", to the idea that one should observe, study and internalise the real in order to be able to consciously forget it and recreate it according to the rules of intellect, imagination and design: \\"look at bamboo for years, then forget it, then you can paint bamboo. Internalise, create, produce\\". It is from the loss of reference that an essential characteristic of Fornasetti's style can be made - a loss of sources of inspiration, styles, perspectives. To subvert the sense of depth, to challenge it, to inscribe it in the register of illusion, to provoke dizziness in the viewer, represents one of Piero Fornasetti's evident desires.

Faro was at that time the last part of the Kingdom of the Algarve still in Muslim hands, and there her father was the Qadi. Christening She was christened in time,Most probably because she had been previously christened according to the Mozarabic Rite, the re-christening being done in the Roman Rite. receiving her new name as Maior Afonso, or Mor Afonso, Mor being short for Maior, a common female name in medieval Portuguese. Afonso was given her in baptism as her new patronymic, meaning \\"the daughter of\\" Afonso - and that suggests that her elderly royal lover was also her godfather, that she took his spiritual \\"fatherhood\\" when christened. Her father's name was Aloandro Ben Bekar (also known in Portuguese as Aloandro or Aldroando Gil after his christening). In ancient Portuguese chronicles, Madragana was also referred to as Mouroana,Sometimes spelled Mourana (also in the variety Mourana Gil). Notice that the origin of the name Mourana is not the Portuguese for Moor, Mouro, but the Portuguese traditional name Ouroana, or Aureana. Mouroana Gil, and Madraganil - all of which are Christian names. Ethnicity Madragana as ancestress of Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of king George III of England There is some controversy regarding her ethnicity. Duarte Nunes de Leão, a Portuguese royal chronicler of the 16th century, said that Madragana was a Moor.LEAO, Duarte Nunes de, Primeira parte das Chronicas dos reis de Portvgal (sheet 97) That was disputed in the 18th century by António Caetano de Sousa. Sousa, António Caetano de, História Genealógica da Casa Real Portuguesa, Tomo XII, Parte II (pages 702 and 703) She was probably Mozarab.Freire, Anselmo Braancamp, Brasões da Sala de Sintra, Vol I, pages 206-207Felgueiras Gayo & Carvalhos de Basto, Nobiliário das Famílias de Portugal, Braga, 1989Pizarro, José Augusto de Sotto Mayor, Linhagens Medievais Portuguesas, 3 vols., Porto, Universidade Moderna, 1999.Soveral, Manuel Abranches de, \\"Origem dos Souza ditos do Prado\\", in Machado de Vila Pouca de Aguiar. Ascendências e parentescos da Casa do Couto d'Além em Soutelo de Aguiar, Porto, 2000 Nonetheless, this supposed Moorish connection gave rise to a claim by Mario de Valdes y Cocom that the royal family of England had African ancestry via the 15-generation descent of Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of George III of the United Kingdom, from Madragana, giving Charlotte what the proponent described as a \\"conspicuously Negroid\\" appearance.Mario de Valdes y Cocom, \\"The blurred racial lines of famous families - Queen Charlotte\\", PBS Frontline. However, it is far from clear that Madragana's family was of recent African origin, nor is it likely that, if she were African, Madragana's negligible contribution to Charlotte's genetic makeup would have caused the Queen alone, among all of Madgarana's descendants at this distant time, to display distinctive African features.Stuart Jeffries, \\"Was this Britain's first black queen?\\" The Guardian, 12 March 2009. Madragana bore Afonso two known children: *Martim Afonso Chichorro (c. 1250 – after 1313), married to Inês Lourenço de Sousa (or Inês Lourenço de Valadares) (born c. 1250). *Urraca Afonso (born c. 1260), married twice: 1st in 1265 to Pedro Anes Gago de Riba Vizela (c. 1240-1286); 2nd c. 1275 to João Mendes de Briteiros (born c. 1250). When passion with the King waned, Madragana was married to Fernão Rei. They had at least one daughter, Sancha Fernandes. Note that Rei means 'king', in Portuguese, and so Fernão Rei is believed to originally have been a servant of the king (Fernão do Rei, Ferdinand of the King).

It is a light grayish brown, paler ventrally, with a long snout and large greenish eyes. This deep water shark has two dorsal fins with long, grooved spines and the second dorsal fin smaller than the first. Its upper teeth are blade-like and lower have finely serrated edges. This tertiary consumer feeds on mainly fish such as bony fish, but also cephalopods such as squid and other invertebrates like crustaceans. The gulper shark is currently a vulnerable species mainly because of exploitation by humans and their abnormally long gestation period and low fecundity, preventing their population from recovering. Development and reproduction Gulper sharks reach maturity at around age 12 to 16 years for females, and age 7 to 8 years for males. The maturity of a gulper shark can be determined by the seven-stage maturity scale for aplacental and placental viviparous sharks.Ungaro, N. (2008) Field manual on macroscopic identification of maturity stages for the Mediterranean fishery resources. FAO This scale is good for practical field use, but may not be as accurate as other maturity scales that have more than seven stages. Maturity for gulper sharks is considered when they are at stage 3 or above, which for males is when gonads are enlarged and filled with sperm, and sperm ducts are tightly coiled. For females, stage three is when ovaries are large and well rounded. On average, male gulper sharks are smaller than females. The size of an average adult male is 80 to 95 cm. The size of an average adult female is from 90 to 100 cm long. Differences in size between the sexes may be due to the need for space to support offspring. It has been hypothesized that gulper sharks display a “depth distribution pattern associated with size” based on random human observation. Male gulper sharks tend to outnumber females 2:1, which is common for many fish species. The life expectancy, longevity, of female gulper sharks ranges between 54 and 70 years. Having a long life expectancy but a low net reproduction rate suggests that the population of gulper sharks would be at a very high risk if too many of them were killed from excessive fishing. Female gulper sharks typically have between 2 and 10 pups in their lifetime, with generally one pup per pregnancy, this is considered to be a low fecundity. Once fertilized, females can hold up to 6 mature egg cells, or oocytes, in their body at a time. The length of time these egg cells are kept inside the female's body is called the gestation period. Gulper sharks have a long gestation period, around two years. Gulper sharks can have long resting periods between pregnancies.ARKive, Gulper shark (Centrophorus granulosus) . They are ovoviviparous, meaning the only parental care they give their young is during the incubation period. Since not all oocytes form into pups, when a pup or two is formed inside the female, they eat the remaining fertilized eggs, known as oophagy. After they are born, they are on their own. Having a low fecundity, a long gestation period, breaks between pregnancies, and a late age of maturity all contribute to the gulper shark having a very low net reproduction rate. It is believed that the gulper shark has the lowest reproduction rate of any elasmobranch species.

PhD Thesis, Universitat de Valencia Acceptable habitats for gulper populations are found globally, wherever temperate and tropical waters are found. The gulper shark is most commonly found in the 300 to 800 meter depth range, inhabiting the upper continental slopes and outer continental shelves, the gulper is highly migratory species and has schooling habits based on multiple sharks being present around baited cameras. Due to the frequency and patterns of migration the gulper shark population estimates may be inaccurate with some sharks being counted twice, which are exacerbated by inappropriate tagging techniques. There are multiple species of gulper sharks, which has contributed to misidentification in the past. For example, populations of the gulper shark in the Southeast Atlantic Ocean may represent a separate species. Therefore, taxonomic confusion may influence current geographical range. The gulper sharks like deep, murky waters. Human interaction =Fishing and bycatch= Human interaction with the gulper shark exists mainly in the form of fishing. Longline fishing is a typical method for fishing at the depth required to catch gulper sharks, and the broad distribution of gulper habitat leads to this method being used to catch gulpers around the world. However, gulper sharks are not always caught intentionally. The deep waters in which the gulper and similar shark species live is difficult to harvest, and longlines are an unspecific form of fishing. Longlines intended for other species can easily catch gulper sharks.Seafood Watch. Fishing Methods Fact Card. alt=A photo of a gulper shark that has been caught. When a fish species other than the intended catch is caught, it is called bycatch. Although bycatch is not always a significant cause of loss to population size, it highlights the unpredictable nature of deepwater fish exploitation.Hogan, Michael (2010) “Overfishing” in Encyclopedia of Earth, Sidney Draggan and C. Cleveland (eds.). Washington DC. Rules and regulations regarding bycatch treatment are difficult to enforce by the nature of the bycatch being unintentional. Bycatch is often not treated as a serious issue until a species has declined to a point where small bycatch has a large effect, so data on the effect of bycatch on gulper populations is not abundant. Gulper shark populations have dropped as much as 80% in some areas, so bycatch is only recently becoming a big issue for them. =Consumables= Fins and meat are generally taken from gulper sharks, but it is of particular interest because of the quantity of liver oil it contains: compared to similar species such as the dogfish shark, the gulper has a larger liver with more oil. Traditionally, shark oil is a folk remedy for a variety of ailments, but also has been shown to contain compounds of contemporary medicinal value, most notable squalene, although the compound can also be extracted from plants.Owen, James (December 29, 2009) Sharks Killed for Oil Used in Swine Flu Vaccine. National Geographic This compound makes the liver of the gulper shark very valuable and is a large part of gulper-specific fishing. Ecology =Life history= The life history of an organism describes the timing of important events for the typical individual of a species. The life history of the gulper shark shows that vulnerability to harvesting is inherent in its biology. The slow rate of gulper growth and development leads to a life strategy that is more centered on competition with one another than escaping predation, especially from humans. This is demonstrated from even the earliest part of an individual gulper's life history where it consumes other fertilized eggs inside its parent's body. A long gestation period, later maturity, and long lifespan all contribute to a K-selected tendency that favors intraspecific competition, or competition with similar species, over survival defenses having to do with predation. Harvesting is a form of predation that slow, invested reproduction does not easily alleviate. The long gestation, low fecundity, and breaks in individual reproduction lead to slow repopulation ability. Slow reproduction is a part of the species biology, and cannot be changed in one generation based on sudden predation pressure. A group of gulper sharks that undergoes predation by humans may take fifteen years or longer to recover, if at all, based on their maturation time of twelve to sixteen years. Large populations of gulper sharks must be built over long periods of time. Gulper life strategy is also consistent with their trophic level and place in the deepwater community. They are tertiary consumers with no apparent predators, so their biological gear toward competition is an ecologically sound strategy.H.R.81 - Shark Conservation Act of 2009. opencongress.org The introduction of human interaction with gulper sharks is the introduction of a higher trophic level, and presents a relationship that current gulper biology is not equipped to handle while maintaining steady or growing population size. While the fishing of gulper sharks and utilization of squalene from their livers is not inherently an activity that drives them toward extinction, overexploitation of the species can be a problem. The status of gulper sharks on the ICUN red list is currently only vulnerable rather than endangered. The squalene taken from the gulper liver is in high demand as a possible cancer therapy component among other uses, leading to unchecked harvesting of the species. When the populations are declining due to overexploitation, each viable individual is important. As much as 80% of the gulper population has been depleted in some areas, so any harvesting can have a large effect on the decline of the species or possible recovery. The key to overexploitation in gulper sharks is that they require nearly as much time as humans to mature and reproduce. Their life strategy indicates that the frame of view for gulper fishing plans needs to be based on longer amounts of time, to allow for the consideration of the next generation of individuals. Gulper shark do not mature much faster than humans, so they need to be exploited based on a schedule that reflects this. However, being harvested by a species with similar growth patterns means that the gulper shark is unlikely to be considered in this way. It is highly susceptible to overexploitation leading to widespread population decline and its status and a species vulnerable to endangerment. =Conservation efforts and legislation= The gulper shark has been classified as vulnerable status by the IUCN since 2000 due to heavy overfishing and exacerbated through bycatch and low reproductive rates. The General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), which is in charge of almost all intergovernmental fishery management decisions, mandated in 2005 to stop expanding deep water fishing beyond 1,000 meters.Report of the Working Group on Fish Ecology (WGFE), 13–17 March 2006, ICES Headquarters, Copenhagen. ICES WGFE Report 2006. This mandate however, does not support the main population of gulper sharks, which generally live 300–800 meters below the surface. This decision also does not stop any current deepwater fishing; it simply stops any further expansion. This is an insufficient conservation attempt, as it does not help gulper populations under stress, it simply stops more stress from accumulating. The current level of fishing may already be enough to render that population critically endangered in that region, especially considering the low reproductive rate of gulpers. alt=Small tied bales of flat gray objects, messily stacked underneath a translucent tentlike roof between white walls. Other areas of gulper shark populations have no current regulations. The Northwest Atlantic Ocean currently has no rules in regard to the harvesting of gulper sharks, and has already seen a decrease in gulper population of 80–95% since 1990.GFCM (2005) GFCM Recommendations on Mediterranean fisheries management While not many laws apply to gulper sharks specifically, some blanket laws covering many different species have been created. The United States Government passed the Shark Conservation Act in 2010, which prohibited removing fins from sharks that were usually caught as bycatch and then sold to Chinese markets for shark fin soup. This law seals many of loopholes by requiring that any fins or tails brought to land must be “naturally attached to the corresponding carcass” and that no U.S. ship in foreign waters is allowed to possess shark fins. This act protects all species of sharks within 50 nautical miles of the U.S. coast. This is a much more effective law than that by the GFCM, because it addresses shark finning directly and cuts down on the amount of gulpers killed for their fins. Since this law point-blank cuts down on bycatching, it should be an effective effort at the conservation of shark species off U.S. coasts. =Conservation= alt=A comprehensive list of similarities in Centrophorus. While conservation attempts are being made, certain issues like fishery guidelines and catch verification pose problems for furthering conservation attempts. The fisheries concept is a closely regulated way to harvest gulpers, while monitoring the species population to ensure it does not crash. They generally use body mass as an indicator of when to harvest the sharks to allow growth of the population. When these ratios are incorrect, the fishery can easily crash because sharks are harvested before they can reproduce. This is especially true with the gulper shark, which has a two-year-long gestational period and a twelve to sixteen year maturity for females. Biery and Daniel Pauly from UBC Fisheries Centre in Canada executed a review on species-specific fin to body- mass ratios in 2012. Their paper concludes that current regulated ratios are not appropriate for all species and that regulations based on a general ratio for all species is inadequate and may be harming fisheries. The ratios used by many fisheries were originally compiled by a politically affiliated group called The Regional Fishery Management Organizations, RFMO. Biery and Pauly collected fin to body-mass ratios for 50 different species and eight different countries and observed that actual fin to body-mass ratios varied by species and location. Species specific mean ratios ranged from 1.1% to 10.9% and estimated mean ratios by country ranged from 1.5% to 6.1% indicating that current regulations will crash fisheries and not promote population growth. Away from the commercial side of conservation, there are tagging efforts to monitor gulper populations. Tagging is a common ecological tool to study the species characteristics. A large problem with monitoring the populations of Australian and Indonesian dogfish is that discriminating between the seven local species by morphological attributesalone is unreliable. In 2012 a study conducted by Ross Daley, Sharon Appleyard, and Matthew Koopman from the CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research Center in Hobart, Australia aims to help monitored recovery plans by implementing a new catch data verification plan. Their study focuses on using the 16s mitochondrial gene region to differentiate these species and when sequenced, all but C. harrissoni and C. isodon were distinguishable. They concluded that 16s gene is a strong marker suitable for fishery catch verification and that using this technique is a reliable and efficient system for routine testing. However, specialized primers needed for trials are sensitive to decay. Therefore, preservation problems need to be researched to further the prospective use of a 16s mitochondrial classification. This system for routine testing is only available to scientists and would require substantial training for fishermen to be able to use this technique. Uncertainties and inconsistency in data While information concerning gulper sharks exists, there is no place to centrally compile the information so that other researchers may easily obtain it. This leads to repetition in basic data and less depth into the subject matter. Information presented may also be inaccurate as many genus of Centrophorus are morphologically similar. While attempts are being made to make it easier to identify different genus, such as Daley's use of 16s mitochondrial DNA listed above, older data listed for gulper sharks could be for ones other than the granulosus, such as the dumb gulper shark. This also means that current populations numbers could account for other dogfish than just the gulper sharks. Lastly, due to the frequency and patterns of migration, the recorded gulper shark populations may be inaccurate.

It is a low-growing annual plant growing to tall, with soft, finely hairy stems. The leaves are opposite, rounded, diameter, with a lobed margin. The flowers are pink to purple, long. The specific name refers to the amplexicaul leaves (leaves grasping the stem). Description Henbit dead- nettle is an annual herb with a sprawling habit and short, erect, squarish, lightly hairy stems. It grows to a height of about . The leaves are in opposite pairs, often with long internodes. The lower leaves are stalked and the upper ones stalkless, often fused, and clasping the stems. The blades are hairy and kidney-shaped, with rounded teeth. The flowers are relatively large and form a few-flowered terminal spike with axillary whorls. The calyx is regular with five lobes and closes up after flowering. The corolla is purplish-red, fused into a tube long. The upper lip is convex, long and the lower lip has three lobes, two small side ones and a larger central one long. There are four stamens, two long and two short. The gynoecium has two fused carpels and the fruit is a four-chambered schizocarp. This plant flowers very early in the spring even in northern areas, and for most of the winter and the early spring in warmer locations such as the Mediterranean region. At times of year when there are not many pollinating insects, the flowers self-pollinate. Distribution and habitat Henbit dead-nettle is probably native to the Mediterranean region but has since spread around the world. It is found growing in open areas, gardens, fields and meadows. It propagates freely by seed, where it becomes a key part of a meadow ecosystem, Sometimes entire fields will be reddish-purple with its flowers before spring ploughing. Where common, it is an important nectar and pollen plant for bees, especially honeybees, where it helps start the spring build up. It is widely naturalised in eastern North America and elsewhere, However, its attractive appearance, edibility, and readiness to grow in many climates often mean it is permitted to grow when other weeds are not. This plant, though common, is not regarded as a threat to local ecosystems. It plays an arguably beneficial role in its environment by providing nectar to pollinators and providing forage for animals. The seed is also eaten by many species of birds. However, non-native species can be criticized for destabilizing ecosystems by favoring certain species over others. They typically also do not provide food for insect larvae. Uses The leaves, stem, and flowers of the plant are edible and have a slightly sweet and peppery flavor, similar to celery. Henbit can be eaten raw or cooked.

It was replaced in its turn, on 26 June 1964, by the notionally less-strictly government controlled Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française (ORTF), which itself lasted until the end of 1974. RTF was both state-owned and state-controlled. With a budget set by the French National Assembly under the direction of the Ministry of Information, all of its spending and investment plans had to be directly agreed by the Minister of Information and the Minister of Finance. Alain Peyrefitte, Minister of Information, speaking in a debate in the National Assembly on 26 May 1964,French National Assembly archives described RTF as \\"the government in every Frenchman's dining-room\\" – La RTF, c'est le gouvernement dans la salle à manger de chaque Français. History A public monopoly on broadcasting in France had been established with the formation of Radiodiffusion Française (RDF) in 1945. RDF was renamed \\"Radiodiffusion- Télévision Française\\" (RTF) in 1949 and ORTF in 1964. From the beginning, the public broadcaster experienced fierce competition from the \\"peripheral stations\\": French-speaking stations aimed at the French public but transmitting on longwave from neighbouring countries, such as Radio Monte Carlo (RMC) from Monaco, Radio Luxembourg (later RTL) from Luxembourg, and Europe 1 from Germany (exceptionally, in 1974, RMC was allowed to set up a transmitter on French territory). Offices RTF's head offices were located in the avenue de Friedland in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. Its television studios and technical buildings were at 13–15 rue Cognacq-Jay. Channels By the start of the 1960s, the RTF had established five radio and two television channels: =Radio= *France I (later France Inter) on long wave *France II (regional programmes, closed on 8 December 1963 and replaced by Inter Variétés – a variation of France Inter for older listeners) on high-power medium-wave transmitters *France III (later France Culture) on low-power medium-wave transmitters *France IV (later France Musique) on FM only *France V (formerly Radio Alger, a name which it was to resume on 5 July 1962 when it ceased to be part of RTF following the independence of Algeria) =Television= *La première chaîne (\\"The First Channel\\"), broadcast in black and white from 25 July 1948 on VHF 819 lines, and until 3 January 1956 on 441 lines. For a period, experimental 625-line transmissions (test cards) in colour using the French SECAM system (see below) were made on the channel's VHF network each Tuesday morning. *La deuxième chaîne (\\"The Second Channel\\"), created on 21 December 1963 and broadcast on UHF 625 lines, initially in black and white only. Colour transmissions in SECAM were introduced (on this channel only) on 1 October 1967. Regional television Regional television, for areas outside Paris, was slow to develop compared with the situation in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. The first regional station, known as Télé-Lille, began broadcasting on 10 April 1950 with two hours a day of programming for Lille and its surrounding area. The station's main news programme was called Images du Nord (\\"Images of the North\\"). Télé-Lille's signal did not stop at the country's borders, with the result that the station had five times more viewers in the Belgian provinces of West Flanders, East Flanders, and Hainaut than it had in northern France. By February 1952, the establishment of a co-axial link with the RTF's studios in Paris meant that Télé-Lille, when not televising its own programmes, could relay RTF's main Paris-originated programming. In an attempt to counter the spread in Alsace of the viewing of programmes from regional television in the neighbouring German Land of Baden-Württemberg – the inhabitants of Strasbourg had, for example, been able to watch the coronation in June 1953 of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom only on West German television – Télé-Strasbourg began broadcasting on 15 October 1953. Marseille followed on 20 September 1954, Lyon on 8 November 1954, Toulouse in August 1961, Bordeaux on 25 January 1962, and most other regional centres opened shortly thereafter. From late 1963, the regional programmes were also broadcast on La deuxième chaîne by using optical standard conversion in the regional centres (a 625 lines camera aimed at an 819 lines monitor with a special CRT) in order to better adapt the regional coverage to the new \\"regions\\" created in France, and they remained even after the opening of La troisième chaîne (The Third Channel) under the ORTF on 31 December 1972, all three networks broadcasting the regional news, sometimes from two or even three different production centres (e.g. Niort broadcasting Poitiers on networks 1 and 3, and Nantes on network 2). Directors The directors of the RTF were directly appointed by the Minister of Information.

The film stars most of the same cast from the original, including Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, and Corbin Bernsen. Absent from this film is Wesley Snipes, who played Willie Mays Hayes in the first film and who had become a film star in his own right by 1994. Omar Epps took over his role. Several new cast members appear in Major League II. David Keith plays Jack Parkman, a selfish superstar catcher who is looking to replace the aging Jake Taylor (Tom Berenger) as the starter. Takaaki Ishibashi, of Japanese comedic duo Tunnels, is outfielder Hiroshi \\"Kamikaze\\" Tanaka who helps excite the team. Eric Bruskotter is rookie catcher Rube Baker who is getting used to the MLB life. Unlike the first film, which was rated R, Major League II was rated PG and released by Warner Bros. instead of Paramount Pictures. Plot In the previous season, the Cleveland Indians won the division title by beating the New York Yankees in a one-game playoff, but were defeated in the ALCS by the Chicago White Sox. The success of last season has changed the attitudes of the Indians. Pitching sensation Rick \\"Wild Thing\\" Vaughn has become a media sensation and is now more concerned about his public image than his pitching, causing him to lose the edge on his fastball. Instead, he begins to rely on highly ineffective breaking balls, to which he gives nicknames such as \\"Eliminator\\" and \\"Humiliator.\\" Home run hitter Pedro Cerrano becomes a Buddhist and adopts a more placid, carefree style as opposed to the angry and aggressive player he was before. Center fielder Willie Mays Hayes has become a Hollywood actor and now fancies himself a power hitter, due to a sprained knee he suffered while shooting his new film, a box office flop. Aging catcher and team leader Jake Taylor has also returned, but once again is dealing with injuries to his knees. Rachel Phelps, the owner who previously attempted to sabotage them last season, sells the team to Roger Dorn, who has retired as an active player to take the job. One of his first acts is to sign Oakland Athletics all-star catcher Jack Parkman, which forces Jake to compete for his old position. Parkman is an arrogant player who does not respect the team. To further complicate things, minor-league catcher Rube Baker has also been invited to camp despite his inability to throw the ball back to the pitcher with any consistency. As the team breaks camp, manager Lou Brown informs Taylor that he is keeping him on as a coach rather than a player. Jake is upset at first but reluctantly accepts the position. The Indians get off to a slow start, with various complications and conflicts between the players. Parkman quickly becomes a divisive figure in the clubhouse due to his ego, for which Lou suspends him after Parkman criticizes the team in the local papers. Parkman then informs Lou that the suspension is moot as he has been traded to the White Sox. Lou confronts Dorn for not consulting him about the trade. Dorn explains that he could no longer afford to pay Parkman's salary and had no choice but to trade him. In return, Japanese import Hiroshi \\"Kamikaze\\" Tanaka, a gifted left fielder with a penchant for crashing into the fence, is sent to the Indians. Finally out of options, Dorn sells the Indians back to Rachel Phelps. Rachel keeps Dorn on as the Indians general manager and his first order of business is to re-activate himself as a player. Phelps bought the team back as revenge for ruining her plan to move the team to Miami. With the Indians now in last place, she has another chance to do so. Lou suffers a heart attack in the clubhouse due to his frustration over the team's performance and Jake takes over in his stead. When Rube is hit by a pitch in his ankle during a doubleheader against the Boston Red Sox, Hayes is called upon to run for him but refuses to do so, which angers Jake. Vaughn quarrels with Hayes and the two begin fighting, which leads to the entire team fighting each other and getting ejected. After the game, Tanaka criticizes Cerrano for not having any \\"marbles\\" due to his struggles and Hayes makes a wisecrack at Baker about his injury, leading Rube to chastise Hayes and the rest of the team for their lack of passion. Inspired by the speech, Hayes volunteers to run for the injured Baker in the bottom of the ninth inning of the second game and promptly steals second, third and home to tie the score. Cerrano, also inspired, demands that Jake insert him into the game to pinch hit and he responds by hitting the game-winning home run. The win sparks a hot streak that the Indians ride all the way to a second straight division title, clinched by beating the Toronto Blue Jays on the last day of the season. Despite this, Vaughn continues to slump as his ineffective breaking pitches have caused him to lose confidence in his best pitch, his fastball. To make matters worse, he refuses to finish games he starts and has allowed the heckling fans to get into his head. In the ALCS, the Indians meet the White Sox again and win the first three games of the series. This inspires Rachel to give the team a phony pep talk before Game 4, which is purposely designed to get in the heads of the players and distract them. It works, as a still struggling Vaughn gives up a game-winning home run to Parkman in the bottom of the ninth. With strong offense by Parkman, the White Sox defeat the Indians in the next two games, forcing a seventh game in Cleveland. The night before the game, Jake goes to visit Vaughn at his home and tells him that he might be called on to pitch in relief in Game 7. Vaughn nonchalantly tells Taylor he will be ready, which infuriates Jake. He calls Vaughn out for having lost his edge and strongly advises him to find it again before the upcoming game. The White Sox jump out to an early 2–1 lead in Game 7 after Parkman bowls over Rube on a play at the plate. With the Indians down by one, Hayes reaches base on a walk and taunts Parkman by saying he is going to score on the play without sliding. Rube then lines a drive to the left field corner and Hayes rounds the bases and heads for home. The ball gets to Parkman first, but Hayes, making good on his promise not to slide, hurdles over Parkman and lands on home plate. Parkman responds, however, by hitting a three-run home run in the seventh inning and the White Sox take a 5–3 lead into the bottom of the eighth. Although the Indians get a runner on, two quick outs are recorded and Jake is forced to make a strategic move. He calls upon Dorn to \\"take one for the team\\" and sends him up to pinch hit. Dorn takes the first pitch off his lower back and is pulled for a pinch runner. Cerrano steps in, having apparently reverted to his more placid self. After taking two pitches, Cerrano's teammates begin shaking little bags of marbles at him. With this, the Cuban slugger is able to find his focus and send the next pitch over the fence to give the Indians a 6–5 lead. However, the go-ahead runs reach base with two outs in the top of the ninth. Jake calls on Vaughn to get the final out and to the crowd's delight, Vaughn has taken Jake's message to heart and rediscovered his edge. To further this, he tells Jake that he intends to walk the current batter and pitch to Parkman instead, who is on deck. Knowing that an intentional walk will load the bases, Jake initially balks but takes confidence in Vaughn and allows him to face Parkman. Vaughn throws a fastball that Parkman swings through for strike one, then follows with another fastball that Parkman fouls straight back. With two strikes on him, an impressed Parkman dares Vaughn to throw it a third time. Vaughn fearlessly complies with one more fastball dubbed the \\"Terminator\\" that Parkman swings through, striking out to end the game and send the Indians to the World Series.

In the United States, the movie grossed a total of $30,626,182 at the box office. Critical reception Major League II received extremely negative reviews from critics, leaving the film with just a 5% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews. The site's consensus states: \\"Striking out on every joke, Major League II is a lazy sequel that belongs on the bench.\\" Year-end lists * Dishonorable mention – Dan Craft, The Pantagraph Notes Cleveland Stadium was not used, as it was in the first film. Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore replaced Milwaukee County Stadium as the stand-in for the team's home. Although Oriole Park bore a stronger resemblance to the stadium that the Indians were playing in when Major League II was released (the now-Progressive Field), like Milwaukee County Stadium it was designed to represent Cleveland Stadium in the film as the new ballpark was not yet named at the time of the filming. The outfield scoreboard at Oriole Park reads \\"Welcome to Cleveland Stadium\\" at various points and scenes in the outfield are played in front of a blue wall, which Cleveland Stadium had (Oriole Park and Progressive Field both have dark green outfield walls). In one scene, a sign for the \\"Sheraton Inner Harbor\\" can be seen above an outfielder's head. The Sheraton Inner Harbor is a hotel located in Baltimore's Inner Harbor, not Cleveland. A year after this film was released, the actual Cleveland Indians team made it to the 1995 World Series, which was the team's first playoff appearance in 41 years. The Indians ended up losing in 6 games to the Atlanta Braves. In the lead-up to Game 3, the first World Series game played in Cleveland in 41 years, the PA system played \\"The House Is Rockin\\", the song from the end of Major League II. In another coincidence, Bob Uecker served as a commentator for the 1995 World Series television coverage on NBC, which shared broadcasting rights with rival network ABC, thanks to a strike that cancelled the final two months of the 1994 season, as well as the postseason and World Series. Two years after that, the Indians made it to the World Series again (also telecast by NBC and again with Uecker as a commentator) ended up with the same result, this time losing to the Florida Marlins in 7 games. It would be 19 years before the Indians returned to the World Series, which they would once again lose in 7 games to the Chicago Cubs; this came a mere four months after the city's NBA team, the Cavaliers, had defeated the heavily-favored Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals that also went seven games, and brought an end to a 52-year championship drought. Sequel David S. Ward announced in 2010 that he was working on a new film, which he called Major League 3, and hoped to cast the original stars Charlie Sheen, Wesley Snipes and Tom Berenger. The plot would see Sheen's character Ricky \\"Wild Thing\\" Vaughn coming out of retirement to work with a young player. The film is being seen as the third film in the series, despite the fact that a third film, Major League: Back to the Minors, was released in 1998. On April 6, 2011 in Cleveland Ohio, Charlie Sheen during his \\"violent torpedoes of truth\\" tour announced to the audience that he was working on a third sequel, titled Major League 3, and said \\"We are gonna shoot it right here in Cleveland!\\" He opened the show wearing a \\"Rick Vaughn\\" #99 Cleveland Indians jersey. In 2017, Morgan Creek announced plans to reboot their classic films from 1980s and 1990s as either television series or movies, following the success of The Exorcist television series. Several films in the early stages of development include film series Young Guns, Major League, and Ace Ventura.

Being situated close to Lake Constance and the Swiss border, it is mostly known for the Aachtopf — Germany's biggest natural spring in terms of production. History Aach was first mentioned in the year 1100. By the year 1150 the settlement was known in Latin as '. Aach was granted town rights in 1283 by King Rudolph I of Germany. For the next centuries it was a part of Further Austria. In 1499 battles of the Swabian War took place right before gates of Aach. Only 26 years later, in 1525, the German Peasants' War reached Aach, when region's aristocrats flew from the uprisings to the city, whereupon it was occupied by the rebel peasants. However, the uprisings were thrown down quickly by September 1525. On March 25, 1799, there was a battle in Aach between Austria and France in the Napoleonic Wars. After Austria's defeat in the Third Coalition 1805, Aach came to the Grand Duchy of Baden, which joined the German Empire in 1871. After World War II Aach became a part of the new (West) German state of Baden-Württemberg. Law and government Tower of Aach Aach has formed a cooperation with the nearby City of Engen sharing some of its administrative domains. Aach has a city council with twelve seats. The last elections in 2004 brought three seats for the CDU, three seats for the SPD and four seats for independent voters' associations. Aach's mayor is Manfred Ossola. Geography Aach is situated at the edge of the Hegau — a volcanic landscape between Lake Constance and the Swabian Alb mountains. The German–Swiss border lies about 14 km to the southeast. Jewish History The first record of Jews in Aach is dated to 1518, in which the Jews of nearby Geisingen were accused of murdering a Christian child, an incident that can be considered a Blood libel. Every ten years, the local Jews were required to renew their residence permits. Between 1560 and 1570, five Jewish families resided in the town. Jews could host a maximum of five guests. They were required to notify the authorities upon the arrival of a Jewish visitor, and he could not trade with the local townspeople. In 1583, residence rights, now truncated to five-year increments, were renewed for Aach's six Jewish families. Additional restrictions were imposed on the town Jews, forbidding them to deal with agricultural products, and chant at the synagogue.

In college, he was the starting receiver for Middle Tennessee State University. College career Calico made 65 receptions during his freshman season and finished third single season receptions in school history. As a sophomore, he had 47 catches for 752 yards with three touchdowns. On October 28, 2000, Calico caught three passes for 89-yards and two touchdowns during a 61-35 loss to Mississippi State. During the game, Calico made a one-handed 42-yard reception on the sideline as he was covered by three defenders including Fred Smoot. He was able to split the defenders and raced down the sideline for a touchdown. This catch was voted the best catch of the 2000 season and an old painting depicting the catch is hung in the college football hall of fame. As a junior, he had 37 catches for 583 yards with five touchdowns. He bounced back as a senior with 45 catches for 606 yards with four touchdowns. Professional career Calico accepted his invitation to the 2003 Senior Bowl and helped the North defeat the South 24-21. He attended the NFL Combine and was impressive after running the 40-yard dash in times ranging from 4.34-4.42. This greatly raised his draft stock and NFL analyst Gil Brandt projected him to be a first round pick in the upcoming draft, with the possibility of going to the Tennessee Titans at 28th overall. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, the majority of scouts and NFL draft experts projected him to be a second round pick. He was ranked the seventh best wide receiver prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com. The Tennessee Titans selected him in the second round (60th overall) of the 2003 NFL Draft. He was the highest selection taken from Middle Tennessee State. Calico was also the 19th player ever drafted from Middle Tennessee State. He recorded four touchdowns in his rookie season. After a knee injury caused by an illegal horse-collar tackle from Roy Williams, he was cut by the Titans after 2005. On May 13, 2008, he was signed by the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. He was released in June 2008.

However already in 1996 private owners opened a club at the former location with the same name and concept, successfully reviving the club until 2007. https://gaymagz.dk/tag/thorstein- viggoson/ http://lgbt.dk/timeline/pan-club-i-knabrostraede/ Pan was one of Europe's biggest gay clubs and the biggest in Copenhagen. It attracted a large number of people, particularly in the weekends with Saturday being the biggest night. While people of almost all age groups came to the club, it was most popular with younger gay men and lesbians. It also attracted a heterosexual crowd, and in periods it was one of the more fashionable places to go in Copenhagen with many celebrities visiting the club. The club was originally run and owned by \\"LBL\\" (now, LGBT Denmark), the Danish national organization for gays, lesbians and bisexuals. The place has since become a commercial venue and has changed owners several times. Most recently, it was taken over by three men, Munir, Rico and Sadi in 2005 until it closed in 2007. Located at Knabrostræde 3 in the city center, the club had four floors (although not all floors were open at all times) for a total of 2 dance floors and 6 bars. The ground floor featured the cloakroom. The first floor (also known as Pan One) played mostly dance music. The second floor (Pan Two) featured primarily new and old pop music. The third floor featured a karaoke bar and a view over the dance floor of Pan Two. There was also a mezzanine between the first and second floors, offering a view over Pan One along with a sitting area. In the summer, one could sit in the open-air yard outside the club. Britney Spears visited the club in 2004 the night before her concert in Copenhagen. During the last years of the club's operation, the fraction of heterosexuals attending the club steadily increased. This generated negative comments from members of the homosexual crowd who, while generally being welcome to heterosexuals, also wanted to keep the place a gay club. In Denmark it is illegal to restrict access to a club to people of a particular sexual orientation. In September 2006 the club announced a new system that would require guests to show a member card before being allowed to enter the club. The member card was to be ordered from the club website. Guests would be admitted if accompanied by a card holder and tourists would be allowed to enter without a card. The club owners cited a growing number of heterosexual people entering the club just to get a look at the homosexuals, as the motivation for this measure. The member card requirement was put into effect on April 1, 2007. However, a few days later the club announced that it was shutting down, citing a decreasing number of visitors as the reason. April 14, 2007 was the last night the club was open to the public. In the building that used to host PAN, a new nightclub, K3 opened in April 2007. It does not cater specifically to the homosexual community but describes itself as gay-friendly. In August 2008, it was reported that the K3 club would be hosting gay parties under the name \\"PAN retro\\", with the first party planned for December 28, 2008.  Chain of the Original PAN Clubs in Denmark LBL's division in Aarhus, followed in 1976 with PAN Club Aarhus, and trohugout the 1980s several more followed in its peak in the early 1990s having 6 nightclubs in total, most located in Jutland. During a receivership in 1994, PAN A/S was forces to sell all their estate property and to lease or sell all of their night clubs to avoid bankruptcy. Unfortunately the only night club that was saved was the one in Aarhus, that continued until 2006, where it had to close because of competition from especially one larger and more modern nightclub in Aarhus, also aiming at the LGBT audience. In 1996, 2 year after the closure of the PAN Club in Copenhagen, a man named Thorstein Viggoson opened a new night club with the name \\"PAN Club\\" at the same location of the former PAN Club in Copenhagen successfully recreating the image of the former PAN Club, however it closed in 2007 only a year after the last original PAN Club in Aarhus. In 2009 private owners opened a new LGBT nightclub in Aarhus inspired by Pan Club in Aarhus and Copenhagen, called G-Bar (short for Gay-Bar) with a smilair logo as the Pan Clubs.

American newspapers began as modest affairs—a sideline for printers. They became a political force in the campaign for American independence. Following independence the first amendment to U.S. Constitution guaranteed freedom of the press. The U.S. Postal Service Act of 1792 provided substantial subsidies: Newspapers were delivered up to 100 miles for a penny and beyond for 1.5 cents, when first class postage ranged from six cents to a quarter. The American press grew rapidly during the First Party System (1790s-1810s) when both parties sponsored papers to reach their loyal partisans. From the 1830s onward, the Penny press began to play a major role in American journalism. Technological advancements such as the telegraph and faster printing presses in the 1840s also helped to expand the press of the nation as it experienced rapid economic and demographic growth. Editors typically became the local party spokesman, and hard-hitting editorials were widely reprinted. By 1900 major newspapers had become profitable powerhouses of advocacy, muckraking and sensationalism, along with serious, and objective news-gathering. During the early 20th century, prior to rise of television, the average American read several newspapers per-day. Starting in the 1920s changes in technology again morphed the nature of American journalism as radio and later, television, began to play increasingly important competitive roles. In the late 20th century, much of American journalism became housed in big media chains. With the coming of digital journalism in the 21st century, all newspapers faced a business crisis as readers turned to the Internet for sources and advertisers followed them. A selection of American newspapers from 1885, with portraits of their publishers.

Grady & Evan Howell) - San Francisco Chronicle (Michael H. de Young) - The Washington Post (Stilson Hutchins) Colonial period On September 25, 1690, the first colonial newspaper in America, Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick, was published in Boston. However, it was suppressed after its first editionToday in media history: First colonial newspaper published in 1690. In 1704, the governor allowed The Boston News-Letter, a weekly, to be published, and it became the first continuously published newspaper in the colonies. Soon after, weekly papers began publishing in New York and Philadelphia. Merchants published mainly commercial papers. For example, The Boston Daily Advertiser reported on ship arrivals and departures. Prior to the 1830s, a majority of US newspapers were aligned with a political party or platform. Political parties would sponsor anonymous political figures in The Federal Republican and Daily Gazette. This was called partisan press and was not unbiased in opinion. The first editors discovered readers loved it when they criticized the local governor; the governors discovered they could shut down the newspapers. The most dramatic confrontation came in New York in 1734, where the governor brought John Peter Zenger to trial for criminal libel after the publication of satirical attacks. The jury acquitted Zenger, who became the iconic American hero for freedom of the press. The result was an emerging tension between the media and the government. By the mid-1760s, there were 24 weekly newspapers in the 13 colonies (only New Jersey was lacking one), and the satirical attack on government became common practice in American newspapers.Alison Olson, \\"The Zenger Case Revisited: Satire, Sedition and Political Debate in Eighteenth Century America.\\" Early American Literature (2000) 35#3 pp: 223-245. online =The New England Courant= The New England Courant It was James Franklin (1697–1735), Benjamin Franklin's older brother, who first made a news sheet something more than a garbled mass of stale items, \\"taken from the Gazette and other Public Prints of London\\" some six months late. Instead, he launched a third newspaper, The New England Courant.\\" His associates were known as the Hell-Fire Club; they succeeded in publishing a distinctive newspaper that annoyed the New England elite while proving entertaining and establishing a kind of literary precedent. Instead of filling the first part of the Courant with the tedious conventionalities of governors' addresses to provincial legislatures, James Franklin's club wrote essays and satirical letters modeled on The Spectator, which first appeared in London ten years earlier. After the more formal introductory paper on some general topic, such as zeal or hypocrisy or honor or contentment, the facetious letters of imaginary correspondents commonly fill the remainder of the Courant's first page. Timothy Turnstone addresses flippant jibes to Justice Nicholas Clodpate in the first extant number of the Courant. Tom Pen-Shallow quickly follows, with his mischievous little postscript: \\"Pray inform me whether in your Province Criminals have the Privilege of a Jury.\\" Tom Tram writes from the moon about rumors of a certain \\"villainous Postmaster\\". (The Courant was always perilously close to legal difficulties and had, besides, a lasting feud with the town postmaster.) Ichabod Henroost complains of a gadding wife. Abigail Afterwit would like to know when the editor of the rival paper, the Gazette, \\"intends to have done printing the Carolina Addresses to their Governor, and give his Readers Something in the Room of them, that will be more entertaining.\\" Homespun Jack deplores the fashions in general and small waists in particular. Some of these papers represent native wit, with only a general approach to the model; others are little more than paraphrases of The Spectator. And sometimes a Spectator paper is inserted bodily, with no attempt at paraphrase whatever. They also published poetry, histories, autobiographies, etc.Williard Grosvenor Bleyer, \\"The beginning of the Franklins' New-England Courant.\\" Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly 4.2 (1927): 1+ Ben Franklin, journalist [Benjamin Franklin] saw the printing press as a device to instruct colonial Americans in moral virtue. Frasca argues he saw this as a service to God, because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions, thus, doing good provides a service to God. Despite his own moral lapses, Franklin saw himself as uniquely qualified to instruct Americans in morality. He tried to influence American moral life through the construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England. Franklin thereby invented the first newspaper chain, It was more than a business venture, for like many publishers since, he believed that the press had a public-service duty. When Franklin established himself in Philadelphia, shortly before 1730, the town boasted three \\"wretched little\\" news sheets, Andrew Bradford's American Mercury, and Samuel Keimer's Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences and Pennsylvania Gazette. This instruction in all arts and sciences consisted of weekly extracts from Chambers's Universal Dictionary. Franklin quickly did away with all this when he took over the Instructor, and made it The Pennsylvania Gazette. The Gazette soon became Franklin's characteristic organ, which he freely used for satire, for the play of his wit, even for sheer excess of mischief or of fun. From the first he had a way of adapting his models to his own uses. The series of essays called \\"The Busy-Body,\\" which he wrote for Bradford's American Mercury in 1729, followed the general Addisonian form, already modified to suit homelier conditions. The thrifty Patience, in her busy little shop, complaining of the useless visitors who waste her valuable time, is related to the ladies who address Mr. Spectator. The Busy-Body himself is a true Censor Morum, as Isaac Bickerstaff had been in the Tatler. And a number of the fictitious characters, Ridentius, Eugenius, Cato, and Cretico, represent traditional 18th-century classicism. Even this Franklin could use for contemporary satire, since Cretico, the \\"sowre Philosopher\\", is evidently a portrait of Franklin's rival, Samuel Keimer. As time went on, Franklin depended less on his literary conventions, and more on his own native humor. In this there is a new spirit—not suggested to him by the fine breeding of Addison, or the bitter irony of Swift, or the stinging completeness of Pope. The brilliant little pieces Franklin wrote for his Pennsylvania Gazette have an imperishable place in American literature. The Pennsylvania Gazette, like most other newspapers of the period was often poorly printed. Franklin was busy with a hundred matters outside of his printing office, and never seriously attempted to raise the mechanical standards of his trade. Nor did he ever properly edit or collate the chance medley of stale items that passed for news in the Gazette. His influence on the practical side of journalism was minimal. On the other hand, his advertisements of books show his very great interest in popularizing secular literature. Undoubtedly his paper contributed to the broader culture that distinguished Pennsylvania from her neighbors before the Revolution. Like many publishers, Franklin built up a book shop in his printing office; he took the opportunity to read new books before selling them. Franklin had mixed success in his plan to establish an inter-colonial network of newspapers that would produce a profit for him and disseminate virtue.Ralph Frasca, Benjamin Franklin's Printing Network: Disseminating Virtue in Early America (2006) excerpt and text search He began in Charleston, South Carolina in 1731. After the second editor died his widow Elizabeth Timothy took over and made it a success, 1738–46. She was one of colonial era's first woman printers.Ira L. Baker, \\"Elizabeth Timothy: America's First Woman Editor,\\" \\"Journalism Quarterly\\" (1977) 54#2 pp 280-285. For three decades Franklin maintained a close business relationship with her and her son Peter who took over in 1746.Ralph Frasca, \\"'The Partnership at Carolina Having succeeded, was Encourag'd to Engage in Others': The Genesis of Benjamin Franklin's Printing Network,\\" Southern Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal of the South (2006), Vol. 13 Issue 1/2, pp 1-23. The Gazette had a policy of impartiality in political debates, while creating the opportunity for public debate, which encouraged others to challenge authority. Editor Peter Timothy avoided blandness and crude bias, and after 1765 increasingly took a patriotic stand in the growing crisis with Great Britain. However, Franklin's Connecticut Gazette (1755–68) proved unsuccessful. =The Virginia Gazette= Early theatrical notices may also be followed in The Virginia Gazette, a paper of unusual excellence, edited by William Parks in Williamsburg, the old capital of Virginia. Here The Busy-Body, The Recruiting Officer, and The Beaux' Stratagem were all performed, often by amateurs, though professionals were known as early as 1716 in Williamsburg. Life in Williamsburg in 1736 had a more cosmopolitan quality than in other towns. A sprightly essay-serial called The Monitor, which fills the first page of The Virginia Gazette for twenty-two numbers, probably reflects not only the social life of the capital, but also the newer fashion in such periodical work. It is dramatic in method, with vividly realized characters who gossip and chat over games of piquet or at the theatre. The Beaux' Stratagem, which had been played in Williamsburg three weeks before, is mentioned as delightful enough to make one of the ladies commit the indiscretion of giggling. The Monitor represents a kind of light social satire unusual in the colonies.Robert Manson Myers, \\"The Old Dominion Looks to London: A Study of English Literary Influences upon\\" The Virginia Gazette\\"(1736-1766).\\" The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 54.3 (1946): 195-217. in JSTOR =Politics in the later newspapers= After 1750, general news became accessible, and the newspapers show more and more interest in public affairs. The literary first page was no longer necessary, though occasionally used to cover a dull period. A new type of vigorous polemic gradually superseded the older essay. A few of the well-known conventions were retained, however. We still find the fictitious letter, with the fanciful signature, or a series of papers under a common title, such as The Virginia-Centinel, or Livingston's Watch-Tower. The former is a flaming appeal to arms, running through The Virginia Gazette in 1756, and copied into Northern papers to rouse patriotism against the French enemy. The expression of the sentiment, even thus early, seems national. Livingston's well-known Watch-Tower, a continuation of his pamphlet-magazine The Independent Reflector, has already the keen edge of the Revolutionary writings of fifteen and twenty years later. The fifty-second number even has one of the popular phrases of the Revolution: \\"Had I not sounded the Alarm, Bigotry would e'er now have triumphed over the natural Rights of British Subjects.\\" (Gaine's Mercury in 1754–1755) Revolutionary epoch and early national era: 1770–1820 (This section is based on Newspapers, 1775–1860 by Frank W. Scott) Massachusetts Spy, July 7, 1774 Weekly newspapers in major cities and towns were strongholds of patriotism (although there were a few Loyalist papers). They printed many pamphlets, announcements, patriotic letters and pronouncements.Carol Sue Humphrey, The American Revolution and the Press: The Promise of Independence (Northwestern University Press; 2013) On the eve of Revolution Virginia had three separate weeklies at the same time named The Virginia Gazette—they all kept up a heavy fire against the king and his governors.Stella F. Duff, \\"The Case Against the King: The Virginia Gazettes Indict George III.\\" William and Mary Quarterly 6#3 (1949): 383-397.in JSTOR =The Massachusetts Spy and the Patriotic Press= Isaiah Thomas's Massachusetts Spy, published in Boston and Worcester, was constantly on the verge of being suppressed, from the time of its establishment in 1770 to 1776 and during the American Revolution. In 1771-73 the Spy featured the essays of several anonymous political commentators who called themselves \\"Centinel,\\" \\"Mucius Scaevola\\" and \\"Leonidas.\\" They spoke in the same terms about similar issues, kept Patriot polemics on the front page, and supported each other against attacks in progovernment papers. Rhetorical combat was a Patriot tactic that explained the issues of the day and fostered cohesiveness without advocating outright rebellion. The columnists spoke to the colonists as an independent people tied to Britain only by voluntary legal compact. The Spy soon carried radicalism to its logical conclusion. When articles from the Spy were reprinted in other papers, the country as a whole was ready for Tom Paine's Common Sense (in 1776). The turbulent years between 1775 and 1783 were a time of great trial and disturbance among newspapers. Interruption, suppression, and lack of support checked their growth substantially. Although there were forty-three newspapers in the United States when the treaty of peace was signed (1783), as compared with thirty-seven on the date of the battle of Lexington (1775), only a dozen remained in continuous operation between the two events, and most of those had experienced delays and difficulties through lack of paper, type, and patronage. Not one newspaper in the principal cities, Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, continued publication throughout the war. When the colonial forces were in possession, royalist papers were suppressed, and at times of British occupation, revolutionary papers moved away, or were discontinued, or they became royalist, only to suffer at the next turn of military fortunes. Thus there was an exodus of papers from the cities along the coast to smaller inland places, where alone it was possible for them to continue without interruption. Scarcity of paper was acute; type worn out could not be replaced. The appearance of the newspapers deteriorated, and issues sometimes failed to appear at all. Mail service, never good, was poorer than ever; foreign newspapers, an important source of information, could be obtained but rarely; many of the ablest writers who had filled the columns with dissertations upon colonial rights and government were now otherwise occupied. News from a distance was less full and regular than before; yet when great events happened, reports spread over the country with great rapidity, through messengers in the service of patriotic organizations. The quality of reporting was still imperfect. The Salem Gazette printed a full but colored account of the battle of Lexington, giving details of the burning, pillage, and barbarities charged to the British, and praising the militia who were filled with \\"higher sentiments of humanity.\\" The Declaration of Independence was published by Congress, July 6, 1776, in the Philadelphia Evening Post, from which it was copied by most of the newspapers in the new nation; but some of them did not mention it until two weeks later, and even then found room for only a synopsis. When they were permitted to do so, they printed fairly full accounts of the proceedings of provincial assemblies and of Congress, which were copied widely, as were all official reports and proclamations. On the whole, however, a relatively small proportion of such material and an inadequate account of the progress of the war is found in the contemporaneous newspapers. The general spirit of the time found fuller utterance in mottoes, editorials, letters, and poems. In the beginning, both editorials and communications urged united resistance to oppression, praised patriotism, and denounced tyranny; as events and public sentiment developed these grew more vigorous, often a little more radical than the populace. Later, the idea of independence took form, and theories of government were discussed. More interesting and valuable as specimens of literature than these discussions were the poems inspired by the stirring events of the time. Long narratives of battles and of heroic deaths were mingled with eulogies of departed heroes. Songs meant to inspire and thrill were not lacking. Humor, pathos, and satire sought to stir the feelings of the public. Much of the poetry of the Revolution is to be found in the columns of the newspapers, from the vivid and popular satires and narratives of Philip Freneau to the saddest effusions of the most commonplace schoolmaster.for full details see Gillian B. Anderson, Freedom's Voice in Poetry and Song. Part 1, An Inventory of Political and Patriotic Lyrics in Colonial American Newspapers, 1773-1783. Part 2, Song Book (1977), 888pp The newspapers of the Revolution were an effective force working towards the unification of sentiment, the awakening of a consciousness of a common purpose, interest, and destiny among the separate colonies, and of a determination to see the war through to a successful issue. They were more single-minded than the people themselves, and they bore no small share of the burden of arousing and supporting the often discouraged and indifferent public spirit. The New Jersey Journal became the second newspaper published in New Jersey. It was established by Shepard Kollock at his press during 1779 in the village of Chatham, New Jersey. This paper became a catalyst in the revolution. News of events came directly to the editor from Washington's headquarters in nearby Morristown, boosting the morale of the troops and their families, and he conducted lively debates about the efforts for independence with those who opposed and supported the cause he championed. Kollock later relocated the paper twice, until 1785, when he established his last publication location in Elizabeth under the same name. The Elizabeth Daily Journal ceased publication on January 2, 1992 after having been in continuous publication for 212 years, the fourth oldest newspaper published continuously in the United States.Staff. \\"NEW JERSEY LOSES OLDEST PAPER\\", The Palm Beach Post, January 3, 1992. Accessed March 21, 2012. \\"The Daily Journal, the state's oldest newspaper, will close Friday after losing money for two years. Publisher Richard J. Vezza wouldn't say how much money the 212-year-old newspaper had lost. Most of its 84 employees will be laid off.\\" Many of the papers, however, which were kept alive or brought to life during the war could not adapt themselves to the new conditions of peace. Perhaps only a dozen of the survivors held their own in the new time, notably the Boston Gazette, which declined rapidly in the following decade, The Connecticut Courant of Hartford, The Providence Gazette, and The Pennsylvania Packet of Philadelphia, to which may be added such representative papers as the Massachusetts Spy, Boston's Independent Chronicle, the New York Journal and Packet, the Newport Mercury, the Maryland Gazette of Annapolis, the Pennsylvania Gazette and The Pennsylvania Journal, both of Philadelphia. Practically all were of four small pages, each of three or four columns, issued weekly. In 1783, the Pennsylvania Evening Post became the first American daily. The next year, the Pennsylvania Packet was published three times a week, and the New York Journal twice a week, as were several of the papers begun in that year. There was a notable extension to new fields. In Vermont, where the first paper, established in 1781, had soon died, another arose in 1783; in Maine, two were started in 1785. In 1786, the first one west of the Alleghenies appeared at Pittsburgh, and following the westward tide of immigration the Kentucky Gazette was begun at Lexington in 1787. Conditions were hardly more favorable to newspapers than during the recent conflict. The sources of news were much the same; the means of communication and the postal system were little improved. Newspapers were not carried in the mails but by favor of the postmen, and the money of one state was of dubious value in another. Consequently, circulations were small, rarely reaching a thousand; subscribers were slow in paying; and advertisements were not plentiful. Newspapers remained subject to provincial laws of libel, in accordance with the old common law, and were, as in Massachusetts for a short time in 1785, subject to special state taxes on paper or on advertisements. But public sentiment was growing strongly against all legal restrictions, and in general the papers practiced freedom, not to say license, of utterance. With independence had come the consciousness of a great destiny. The collective spirit aroused by the war, though clouded by conflicting local difficulties, was intense, and the principal interest of the newspapers was to create a nation out of the loose confederation. Business and commerce were their next care; but in an effort to be all things to all men, the small page included a little of whatever might \\"interest, instruct, or amuse.\\" Political intelligence occupied first place; news, in the modern sense, was subordinated. A new idea, quite as much as a fire, a murder, or a prodigy, was a matter of news moment. There were always a few items of local interest, usually placed with paragraphs of editorial miscellany. Correspondents, in return for the paper, sent items; private letters, often no doubt written with a view to such use, were a fruitful source of news; but the chief resource was the newspapers that every office received as exchanges, carried in the post free of charge, and the newspapers from abroad. =Partisan newspapers= Newspapers became a form of public property after 1800. Americans believed that as republican citizens they had a right to the information contained in newspapers without paying anything. To gain access readers subverted the subscription system by refusing to pay, borrowing, or stealing. Editors, however, tolerated these tactics because they wanted longer subscription lists. First, the more people read the newspaper, more attractive it would be to advertisers, who would purchase more ads and pay higher rates. A second advantage was that greater depth of coverage translated into political influence for partisan newspapers. Newspapers also became part of the public sphere when they became freely available at reading rooms, barbershops, taverns, hotels and coffeehouses.Charles G. Steffen, \\"Newspapers for Free: The Economies of Newspaper Circulation in the Early Republic,\\" Journal of the Early Republic, Fall 2003, Vol. 23 Issue 3, pp 381-419 The editor, usually reflecting the sentiment of a group or a faction, began to emerge as a distinct power. He closely followed the drift of events and expressed vigorous opinions. But as yet the principal discussions were contributed not by the editors but by \\"the master minds of the country.\\" The growing importance of the newspaper was shown in the discussions preceding the Federal Convention, and notably in the countrywide debate on the adoption of the Constitution, in which the newspaper largely displaced the pamphlet. When Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay united to produce the Federalist Essays, they chose to publish them in The Independent Journal and The Daily Advertiser, from which they were copied by practically every paper in America long before they were made into a book. When the first Congress assembled March 4, 1789, the administration felt the need of a paper, and, under the influence of Hamilton, John Fenno issued at New York, April 15, the first number of The Gazette of the United States, the earliest of a series of administration organs. The editorship of the Gazette later fell to Joseph Dennie, who had previously made a success of The Farmer's Weekly Museum and would later found The Port Folio, two of the most successful newspapers of the era. The seat of government became the journalistic center of the country, and as long as party politics remained the staple news interest the administration organs and their opponents were the chief sources of news for the papers of the country. Partisan bitterness increased during the last decade of the century as the First Party System took shape. The parties needed newspapers to communicate with their voters. New England papers were generally Federalist; in Pennsylvania there was a balance; in the West and South the Republican press predominated. Though the Federalists were vigorously supported by such able papers as Russell's Columbian Centinel in Boston, Isaiah Thomas's Massachusetts Spy, The Connecticut Courant, and, after 1793, Noah Webster's daily Minerva (soon renamed Commercial Advertiser) in New York, the Gazette of the United States, which in 1790 followed Congress and the capital to Philadelphia, was at the center of conflict, \\"a paper of pure Toryism\\", as Thomas Jefferson said, \\"disseminating the doctrines of monarchy, aristocracy, and the exclusion of the people.\\" To offset the influence of this, Jefferson and Madison induced Philip Freneau, who had been editing The Daily Advertiser in New York, to set up a \\"half weekly\\", to \\"go through the states and furnish a Whig [Republican] vehicle of intelligence.\\" Freneau's National Gazette, which first appeared October 31, 1791, soon became the most outspoken critic of the administration of Adams, Hamilton, and Washington, and an ardent advocate of the French Revolution. Fenno and Freneau, in the Gazette of the United States and the National Gazette, at once came to grips, and the campaign of personal and party abuse in partisan news reports, in virulent editorials, in poems and skits of every kind, was echoed from one end of the country to the other. The National Gazette closed in 1793 due to circulation problems and the political backlash against Jefferson and Madison's financial involvement in founding the paper. The other Republican paper of primary importance was the Aurora General Advertiser, founded by Ben Franklin's grandson and heir, Benjamin Franklin Bache, on October 2, 1790. The Aurora, published from Franklin Court in Philadelphia, was the most strident newspaper of its time, attacking John Adams' anti-democratic policies on a daily basis. No paper is thought to have given Adams more trouble than the Aurora. His wife, Abigail, wrote frequent letters to her sister and others decrying what she considered the slander spewing forth from the Aurora. Jefferson credited the Aurora with averting a disastrous war with France, and laying the groundwork for his own election. Following Bache's death (the result of his staying in Philadelphia during a yellow fever epidemic, while he was awaiting trial under the Sedition Act), William Duane, an immigrant from Ireland, led the paper until 1822 (and married Bache's widow, following the death of his own wife in the same Yellow Fever epidemic). Like Freneau, Bache and Duane were involved in a daily back-and-forth with the Federalist editors, especially Fenno and Cobbett. Noah Webster, strapped for money, accepted an offer in late 1793 from Alexander Hamilton of $1,500 to move to New York City and edit a Federalist newspaper. In December he founded New York's first daily newspaper, American Minerva (later known as The Commercial Advertiser). He edited it for four years, writing the equivalent of 20 volumes of articles and editorials. He also published the semi-weekly publication, The Herald, A Gazette for the country (later known as The New York Spectator). As a partisan he soon was denounced by the Jeffersonian Republicans as \\"a pusillanimous, half-begotten, self-dubbed patriot\\", \\"an incurable lunatic\\", and \\"a deceitful newsmonge ... Pedagogue and Quack.\\" Fellow Federalist Cobbett labeled him \\"a traitor to the cause of Federalism\\", calling him \\"a toad in the service of sans-culottism\\", \\"a prostitute wretch\\", \\"a great fool, and a barefaced liar\\", \\"a spiteful viper\\", and \\"a maniacal pedant.\\" The master of words was distressed. Even the use of words like \\"the people\\", \\"democracy\\", and \\"equality\\" in public debate, bothered him for such words were \\"metaphysical abstractions that either have no meaning, or at least none that mere mortals can comprehend.\\" The first party newspapers were full of vituperation. As one historian comments, > It was with the newspaper editors, however, on both sides that a climax of > rancorous and venomous abuse was reached.

This decade of violence was nevertheless one of development in both the quality and the power of newspapers. News reporting was extended to new fields of local affairs, and the intense rivalry of all too numerous competitors awoke the beginnings of that rush for the earliest reports, which was to become the dominant trait in American journalism. The editor evolved into a new type. As a man of literary skill, or a politician, or a lawyer with a gift for polemical writing, he began to supersede the contributors of essays as the strongest writer on the paper. Much of the best writing, and of the rankest scurrility, be it said, was produced by editors born and trained abroad, like Bache of the Aurora, Cobbett, Cooper, Gales, Cheetham, Callender, Lyon, and Holt. Of the whole number of papers in the country towards the end of the decade, more than one hundred and fifty, at least twenty opposed to the administration were conducted by aliens. The power wielded by these anti- administration editors impressed John Adams, who in 1801 wrote: \\"If we had been blessed with common sense, we should not have been overthrown by Philip Freneau, Duane, Callender, Cooper, and Lyon, or their great patron and protector. A group of foreign liars encouraged by a few ambitious native gentlemen have discomfited the education, the talents, the virtues, and the prosperity of the country.\\" The most obvious example of that Federalist lack of common sense was the passage of the Alien and Sedition laws in 1798 to protect the government from the libels of editors. The result was a dozen convictions and a storm of outraged public opinion that threw the party from power and gave the Jeffersonian Republican press renewed confidence and the material benefit of patronage when the Republicans took control of the government in 1800. The Republican party was especially effective in building a network of newspapers in major cities to broadcast its statements and editorialize in its favor. Fisher Ames, a leading Federalist, blamed the newspapers for electing Jefferson: they were \\"an overmatch for any Government ... The Jacobins owe their triumph to the unceasing use of this engine; not so much to skill in use of it as by repetition.\\"Noble Cunningham, The Jeffersonian Republicans: 1789–1801 (1957) p 167 The newspapers continued primarily party organs; the tone remained strongly partisan, though it gradually gained poise and attained a degree of literary excellence and professional dignity. The typical newspaper, a weekly, had a paid circulation of 500. The growth of the postal system, with the free transportation of newspapers locally and statewide, allowed the emergence of powerful state newspapers that closely reflected, and shaped, party views. =Growth= Growth in newspapers The number and geographical distribution of newspapers grew apace. In 1800 there were between 150 and 200; by 1810 there were 366, and during the next two decades the increase was at least equally rapid. With astonishing promptness the press followed the sparse population as it trickled westward and down the Ohio or penetrated the more northerly forests. By 1835 papers had spread to the Mississippi River and beyond, from Texas to St. Louis, throughout Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and into Wisconsin. These pioneer papers, poorly written, poorly printed, and partisan often beyond all reason, served a greater than a merely local purpose in sending weekly to every locality their hundreds of messages of good and evil report, of politics and trade, of weather and crops, that helped immeasurably to bind the far- flung population into a nation.Frank Luther Mott, American Journalism: A History 1690 – 1960 (3rd ed 1962), pp 190-92Barbara L. Cloud, \\"A Party Press? Not Just Yet! Political Publishing on the Frontier.\\" Journalism History 7#2 (1980): 54+. Every congressman wrote regularly to his own local paper; other correspondents were called upon for like service, and in some instances the country editors established extensive and reliable lines of intelligence; but most of them depended on the bundle of exchanges from Washington, Philadelphia, and New York, and reciprocally the city papers made good use of their country exchanges.John Nerone, \\"Representing public opinion: US newspapers and the news system in the long nineteenth century.\\" History Compass 9.9 (2011): 743-759. ref>David M. Ryfe, \\"News, culture and public life: A study of 19th-century American journalism.\\" Journalism Studies 7.1 (2006): 60–77. [ online] As the number of cities of 8,000 or more population grew rapidly so too the daily newspapers were increasing in number. The first had appeared in Philadelphia and New York in 1784 and 1785; in 1796 one appeared in Boston. By 1810 there were twenty-seven in the country—one in the city of Washington, five in Maryland, seven in New York, nine in Pennsylvania, three in South Carolina, and two in Louisiana. As early as 1835 the Detroit Free Press began its long career.Mott, American Journalism (1962), pp 115-18, 181-90.Ted Curtis Smythe, \\"The diffusion of the Urban Daily, 1850-1900.\\" Journalism History 28.2 (2002): 73+ The press in the Party System: 1820–1890 (This section is based on Newspapers, 1775–1860 by Frank W. Scott) The political and journalistic situation made the administration organ one of the characteristic features of the period. Fenno's Gazette had served the purpose for Washington and Adams; but the first great example of the type was the National Intelligencer established in October 1800, by Samuel Harrison Smith, to support the administration of Jefferson and of successive presidents until after Jackson it was thrown into the opposition, and The United States Telegraph, edited by Duff Green, became the official paper. It was replaced at the close of 1830 by a new paper, The Globe, under the editorship of Francis P. Blair, one of the ablest of all ante-bellum political editors, who, with John P. Rives, conducted it until the changing standards and conditions in journalism rendered the administration organ obsolescent. The Globe was displaced in 1841 by another paper called The National Intelligencer, which in turn gave way to The Madisonian. Thomas Ritchie was in 1845 called from his long service on The Richmond Enquirer to found, on the remains of The Globe, the Washington Union, to speak for the Polk administration and to reconcile the factions of democracy. Neither the Union nor its successors, which maintained the semblance of official support until 1860, ever occupied the commanding position held by the Telegraph and The Globe, but for forty years the administration organs had been the leaders when political journalism was dominant. Their influence was shared and increased by such political editors as M. M. Noah and James Watson Webb of the New York Courier and Enquirer, Solomon Southwick of the Albany Register, Edwin Croswell, who edited The Argus and who, supported by Martin Van Buren and others, formed what was known as the \\"Albany Regency.\\" The \\"Regency\\", the Richmond \\"Junta\\", which centered in the Enquirer, and the \\"Kitchen Cabinet\\" headed by the editor of The Globe, formed one of the most powerful political and journalistic cabals that the country has ever known. Their decline, in the late thirties, was coincident with great changes, both political and journalistic, and though successors arose, their kind was not again so prominent or influential. The newspaper of national scope was passing away, yielding to the influence of the telegraph and the railroad, which robbed the Washington press of its claim to prestige as the chief source of political news. At the same time politics was losing its predominating importance. The public had many other interests, and by a new spirit and type of journalism was being trained to make greater and more various demands upon the journalistic resources of its papers. The administration organ presents but one aspect of a tendency in which political newspapers generally gained in editorial individuality, and both the papers and their editors acquired greater personal and editorial influence. The beginnings of the era of personal journalism were to be found early in the 19th century. Even before Nathan Hale had shown the way to editorial responsibility, Thomas Ritchie, in the Richmond Enquirer in the second decade of the century, had combined with an effective development of the established use of anonymous letters on current questions a system of editorial discussion that soon extended his reputation and the influence of his newspaper far beyond the boundaries of Virginia. Washington Barrow and the Nashville Banner, Amos Kendall and The Argus of Western America, G. W. Kendall and the New Orleans Picayune, John M. Francis and the Troy Times, and Charles Hammond and the Cincinnati Gazette, to mention but a few among many, illustrate the rise of editors to individual power and prominence in the third and later decades. Notable among these political editors was John Moncure Daniel, who just before 1850 became editor of the Richmond Examiner and soon made it the leading newspaper of the South. Perhaps no better example need be sought of brilliant invective and literary pungency in American journalism just prior to and during the Civil War than in Daniel's contributions to the Examiner. Though it could still be said that \\"too many of our gazettes are in the hands of persons destitute at once of the urbanity of gentlemen, the information of scholars, and the principles of virtue\\", a fact due largely to the intensity of party spirit, the profession was by no means without editors who exhibited all these qualities, and put them into American journalism. William Coleman, for instance, who, encouraged by Alexander Hamilton, founded the New York Evening Post in 1801, was a man of high purposes, good training, and noble ideals. The Evening Post, reflecting variously the fine qualities of the editor, exemplified the improvement in tone and illustrated the growing importance of editorial writing, as did a dozen or more papers in the early decades of the century. Indeed, the problem most seriously discussed at the earliest state meetings of editors and publishers, held in the thirties, was that of improving the tone of the press. They tried to attain by joint resolution a degree of editorial self-restraint, which few individual editors had as yet acquired. Under the influence of Thomas Ritchie, vigorous and unsparing political editor but always a gentleman, who presided at the first meeting of Virginia journalists, the newspaper men in one state after another resolved to \\"abandon the infamous practice of pampering the vilest of appetites by violating the sanctity of private life, and indulging in gross personalities and indecorous language\\", and to \\"conduct all controversies between themselves with decency, decorum, and moderation.\\" Ritchie found in the low tone of the newspapers a reason why journalism in America did not occupy as high a place in public regard as it did in England and France. =Editorials= The editorial page was assuming something of its modern form. The editorial signed with a pseudonym gradually died, but unsigned editorial comment and leading articles did not become an established feature until after 1814, when Nathan Hale made them a characteristic of the newly established Boston Daily Advertiser. From that time on they grew in importance until in the succeeding period of personal journalism they were the most vital part of the greater papers. =Penny Press= In the 1830s new high speed presses allowed the cheap printing of tens of thousands of papers a day. The problem was to sell them to a mass audience, which required new business techniques (such as rapid citywide delivery) and a new style of journalism that would attract new audiences. Politics, scandal, and sensationalism worked.Mott, American Journalism: A History 1690 – 1960 (1962), pp 228-52. James Gordon Bennett Sr. (1794–1872) took the lead in New York.James L. Crouthamel, \\"James Gordon Bennett, the 'New York Herald', and the Development of Newspaper Sensationalism.\\" New York History (1973) 54#3: 294-316. in JSTOR In a decade of unsuccessful effort as a political journalist he had become familiar with the increasing enterprise in news-gathering. He despised the upscale journalism of the day—the seriousness of tone, the phlegmatic dignity, the party affiliations, the sense of responsibility. He believed journalists were fools to think that they could best serve their own purposes by serving the politicians. As Washington correspondent for the New York Enquirer, he wrote vivacious, gossipy prattle, full of insignificant and entertaining detail, to which he added keen characterization and deft allusions. Bennett saw a public who would not buy a serious paper at any price, who had a vast and indiscriminate curiosity better satisfied with gossip than discussion, with sensation rather than fact, who could be reached through their appetites and passions. The idea that he did much to develop rested on the success of the one-cent press created by the establishment of the New York Sun in 1833. To pay at such a price these papers must have large circulations, sought among the public that had not been accustomed to buy papers, and gained by printing news of the street, shop, and factory. To reach this public Bennett began the New York Herald, a small paper, fresh, sprightly, terse, and \\"newsy\\". \\"In journalistic débuts of this kind\\", Bennett wrote, \\"many talk of principle—political principle, party principle—as a sort of steel trap to catch the public. We ... disdain ... all principle, as it is called, all party, all politics. Our only guide shall be good, sound, practical common sense, applicable to the business and bosoms of men engaged in every-day life.\\" According to historian Robert C Bannister, Bennett was : :A gifted and controversial editor. Bennett transformed the American newspaper. Expanding traditional coverage, the Harold provided sports reports, a society page, and advice to the lovelorn, soon permanent features of most metropolitan dailies. Bennett covered murders and sex scandals and delicious detail, faking materials when necessary.... His adroit use of telegraph, pony express, and even offshore ships to intercept European dispatches set high standards for rapid news gathering.Robert C. Bannister, \\"Bennett, James Gordon\\" in John A. Garraty, ed., Encyclopedia of American Biography (1975) pp. 80-81. Bannister also argues that Bednnett was a leading crusader against evils he perceived: :Combining opportunism and reform, Bennett exposed fraud on Wall Street, attacked the Bank of the United States, and generally joined the Jacksonian assault on privilege. Reflecting a growing nativism, he published excerpts from the anti-catholic disclosures of \\"Maria Monk,\\" and he greeted Know- Nothingism cordially. Defending labor unions in principle, he asssailed much union activity. Unable to condemn slavery outright, he opposed abolitionism.Bannister, \\"Bennett, James Gordon\\" pp. 80-81. News was but a commodity, the furnishing of which was a business transaction only, which ignored the social responsibility of the press, \\"the grave importance of our vocation\\", prized of the elder journalists and of the still powerful six-cent papers. The Herald, like the Sun, was at once successful, and was remarkably influential in altering journalistic practices. The penny press expanded its coverage into \\"personals\\"—short paid paragraphs by men and women looking for companionship. They revealed people's intimate relationships to a public audience and allowed city folk to connect with and understand their neighbors in an increasingly anonymous metropolis. They included heavy doses of imagination and fiction, typically romantic, highly stylized. Sometimes the same person updated the paragraph regularly, making it like a serial short short story. Moralists were aghast, and warned of the ruin of young girls. (Commenting on censorship of books in the 1920s, New York Mayor Jimmy Walker said he had seen many girls ruined, but never by reading.) More worrisome to the elders they reflected a loss of community control over the city's youth, suggesting to Protestant leaders the need for agencies like the YMCA to provide wholesome companionship. Personals are still included in many papers and magazines into the 21st century. =Specialty media= In a period of widespread unrest and change many specialized forms of journalism sprang up—religious, educational, agricultural, and commercial magazines proliferated.Mott, American Journalism: A History 1690 – 1960 (1962), pp 317-23. The Catholic immigrants started arriving in large numbers and major dioceses sponsored their own newspapers. For example, between 1845 and 1861, the Diocese of St. Louis saw four newspapers come and go: the Catholic News- Letter (1845–48), The Shepherd of the Valley (1850–54), The St. Louis Daily Leader (1855–56), and the Western Banner (1858–61).Jasper W. Cross, \\"The St. Louis Catholic Press and Political Issues, 1845-1861.\\" Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia 80.4 (1969): 210-224. Online The Boston Pilot was the leading Irish Catholic paper whose news and editorials were reprinted often by other Catholic papers the leading Irish Catholic newspaper of the period. The paper tried to balance support of the Union with its opposition to emancipation, while maintaining Irish American patriotism.Francis R. Walsh, \\"The Boston Pilot Reports the Civil War.\\" Historical Journal of Massachusetts 9.2 (1981): 5+. Evangelical Protestants began discussing temperance, prohibition, and Even broach the subject of votes for women.Candy Gunther Brown, The Word in the World: Evangelical Writing, Publishing, and Reading in America, 1789-1880 (2004). Abolition of slavery after 1830 became a highly inflammatory topic promoted by evangelical Protestants in the North. The leading abolitionist newspaper was William Lloyd Garrison's Liberator, first issued January 1, 1831, which denounced slavery as a sin against God that had to be immediately stopped. Many abolitionist papers were excluded from the mails; their circulation was forcibly prevented in the South; in Boston, New York, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Alton, and elsewhere, editors were assaulted, offices were attacked and destroyed; rewards were offered in the South for the capture of Greeley and Garrison; in a few instances editors, like Lovejoy at Alton, lost their lives at the hands of mobs.Lorman A. Ratner and Dwight L. Teeter Jr., Fanatics and Fire-eaters: Newspapers and the Coming of the Civil War (2010) pp 1-33. =Rural papers= Nearly every county seat, and most towns of more than 500 or 1000 population sponsored one or more weekly newspapers. Politics was of major interest, with the editor-owner typically deeply involved in local party organizations. However, the paper also contained local news, and presented literary columns and book excerpts that catered to an emerging middle class literate audience. A typical rural newspaper provided its readers with a substantial source of national and international news and political commentary, typically reprinted from metropolitan newspapers. Comparison of a subscriber list for 1849 with data from the 1850 census indicates a readership dominated by property owners but reflecting a cross-section of the population, with personal accounts suggesting the newspaper also reached a wider non-subscribing audience. In addition, the major metropolitan daily newspapers often prepared weekly editions for circulation to the countryside. Most famously the Weekly New York Tribune was jammed with political, economic and cultural news and features, and was a major resource for the Whig and Republican parties, as well as a window on the international world, and the New York and European cultural scenes.Nicholas Marshall, \\"The Rural Newspaper and the Circulation of Information and Culture in New York and the Antebellum North,\\" New York History, Spring 2007, Vol. 88 Issue 2, pp 133-151, = Newspapers of the Territories = The first newspaper to be published west of the Mississippi was the Missouri Gazette. Its starting issue was published on July 12, 1808 by Joseph Charless an Irish printer. Swayed by Meriweather Lewis to leave his home in Kentucky and start a new paper for the Missouri Territory Charles was identified by the paper's masthead as \\"Printer to the Territory\\". The paper published advertisements for domestic help, notice for runaway slaves, public notices, and sales for merchandise like land plots or cattle. Newspapers like the Gazette were instrumental in the founding new territories and supporting their stability as they become states. With westward expansion other territories, like Nebraska, followed in Lewis and Missouri's plan for territory stability and founded a newspaper alongside the opening of the Nebraska Territory in 1854. The Nebraska Palladium was a rough newspaper that produced poetry and news from the East, ran advertisements, and created a space for emerging political editorials. that developed a sense of community and cultural influence in the territory. Produced during a time when pioneers were far removed from neighbors these early territorial papers brought a sense of community to the territories. Because of the information gap felt by new settlers of the territories such as Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, and Oklahoma there was a mass startup numerous newspapers. Frank Luther Mott says, \\"Wherever a town sprang up, there a printer with a rude press and a 'shirt- tail-full of type' was sure to appear\\".Mott, American Journalism: A History, 1690-1960 p 282. Competition was intense between the large number of pop-up papers and often the papers would fail within a year or be bought out by a rival. =Associated Press and impact of telegraphy= This idea of news and the newspaper for its own sake, the unprecedented aggressiveness in news- gathering, and the blatant methods by which the cheap papers were popularized aroused the antagonism of the older papers, but created a competition that could not be ignored. Systems of more rapid news-gathering (such as by \\"pony express\\") and distribution quickly appeared. Sporadic attempts at co-operation in obtaining news had already been made; in 1848 the Journal of Commerce, Courier and Enquirer, Tribune, Herald, Sun, and Express formed the New York Associated Press to obtain news for the members jointly. Out of this idea grew other local, then state, and finally national associations. European news, which, thanks to steamship service, could now be obtained when but half as old as before, became an important feature. In the forties several papers sent correspondents abroad, and in the next decade this field was highly developed.Jonathan Silberstein-Loeb, \\"Exclusivity and Cooperation in the Supply of News: The Example of the Associated Press, 1893–1945,\\" Journal of Policy History (2012) 24#3 pp 466-498Victor Rosewater, History of Cooperative News Gathering in the United States (1930) The telegraph, invented in 1844, quickly linked all major cities and most minor ones to a national network that provided news in a matter of minutes or hours rather than days or weeks. It transformed the news gathering business. Telegraphic columns became a leading feature. The Associated Press (AP) became the dominant factor in the distribution of news. The inland papers, in such cities as Chicago, Louisville, Cincinnati, St. Louis, and New Orleans, used AP dispatches to become became independent of papers in Washington and New York.J. Steven Smethers, \\"Pounding Brass for the Associated Press: Delivering News by Telegraph in a Pre-Teletype Era.\\" American Journalism 19#2 (2002): 13-30.Richard A. Schwarzlose, The Nation's Newsbrokers. Vol. 1: The Formative Years, from Pretelegraph to 1865 (1989); Nation's Newsbrokers Volume 2: The Rush to Institution: From 1865 to 1920 (1990) In general, only one newspaper in each city had the Associated Press franchise, and it dominated the market for national and international news. United Press was formed in the 1880s to challenge the monopoly. The growing number of chains each set up their own internal dissemination system. =Great editors= Out of the period of restless change in the 1830s there emerged a few great editors whose force and ability gave them and their newspapers an influence hitherto unequalled, and made the period between 1840 and 1860 that of personal journalism. These few men not only interpreted and reflected the spirit of the time, but were of great influence in shaping and directing public opinion. Consequently, the scope, character, and influence of newspapers was in the period immensely widened and enriched, and rendered relatively free from the worst subjection to political control. Copperhead cartoon from 1862 (note the horns) Naturally, the outstanding feature of this personal journalism was the editorial. Rescued from the slough of ponderousness into which it had fallen in its abject and uninspired party service, the editorial was revived, invigorated, and endowed with a vitality that made it the center about which all other features of the newspaper were grouped. It was individual; however large the staff of writers, the editorials were regarded as the utterance of the editor. \\"Greeley says\\" was the customary preface to quotations from the Tribune, and indeed many editorials were signed. James Gordon Bennett, Sr., Samuel Bowles (1826–78), Horace Greeley (1811–72), and Henry J. Raymond (1820–69) who were the outstanding figures of the period. Of Bennett's influence something has already been said; especially, he freed his paper from party control. His power was great, but it came from his genius in gathering and presenting news rather than from editorial discussion, for he had no great moral, social or political ideals, and his influence, always lawless and uncertain, can hardly be regarded as characteristic of the period. Of the others named, and many besides, it could be said with approximate truth that their ideal was \\"a full presentation and a liberal discussion of all questions of public concernment, from an entirely independent position, and a faithful and impartial exhibition of all movements of interest at home and abroad.\\" As all three were not only upright and independent, but in various measure gifted with the quality of statesmanship at once philosophical and practical, their newspapers were powerful molders of opinion at a critical period in the history of the nation. The news field was immeasurably broadened; news style was improved; interviews, newly introduced, lent the ease and freshness of dialogue and direct quotation. There was a notable improvement in the reporting of business, markets, and finance. In a few papers the literary department was conducted by staffs as able as any today. A foreign news service was developed that in intelligence, fidelity, and general excellence reached the highest standard yet attained in American journalism. A favorite feature was the series of letters from the editor or other member of the staff who traveled and wrote of what he heard or saw. Bowles, Olmsted, Greeley, Bayard Taylor, Bennett, and many others thus observed life and conditions at home or abroad; and they wrote so entertainingly and to such purpose that the letters—those of Olmsted and Taylor, for instance—are still sources of entertainment or information. The growth of these papers meant the development of great staffs of workers that exceeded in numbers anything dreamed of in the preceding period. Although later journalism has far exceeded in this respect the time we are now considering, still the scope, complexity, and excellence of our modern metropolitan journalism in all its aspects were clearly begun between 1840 and 1860. =Greeley's New York Tribune= The New York Tribune under Horace Greeley exhibited the best features of the new and semi- independent personal journalism based upon political party supporters and inspired with an enthusiasm for service that is one of the fine characteristics of the period. In editing the New Yorker Greeley had acquired experience in literary journalism and in political news; his Jeffersonian and Log Cabin, were popular Whig campaign papers, had brought him into contact with politicians and made his reputation as an insightful, vigorous journalist. He was a staunch party man, therefore he was chosen to manage a party organ when one was needed to support the Whig administration of Harrison. The prospectus of the New York Tribune appeared April 3, 1841. Greeley's ambition was to make the Tribune not only a good party paper, but also the first paper in America, and he succeeded by imparting to it a certain idealistic character with a practical appeal that no other journal possessed. His sound judgment appeared in the unusually able staff that he gathered about him. Almost from the first, the staff that made the Tribune represented a broad catholicity of interests and tastes, in the world of thought as well as in the world of action, and a solid excellence in ability and in organization, which were largely the result of the genius of Greeley and over which he was the master spirit. It included Henry J. Raymond, who later became Greeley's rival on the Times, George M. Snow, George William Curtis, Charles A. Dana, Bayard Taylor, George Ripley, William H. Fry, Margaret Fuller, Edmund Quincy, and Charles T. Congdon. It is easy to understand how with such a group of writers the idea of the literary newspaper, which had been alive from the beginning of the century, should have advanced well-night to its greatest perfection. The great popular strength of the Tribune doubtless lay in its disinterested sympathy with all the ideals and sentiments that stirred the popular mind in the forties and fifties. \\"We cannot afford\\", Greeley wrote, \\"to reject unexamined any idea which proposes to improve the moral, intellectual, or social condition of mankind.\\" He pointed out that the proper course of an editor, in contrast to that of the time-server, was to have \\"an ear open to the plaints of the wronged and suffering, though they can never repay advocacy, and those who mainly support newspapers will be annoyed and often exposed by it; a heart as sensitive to oppression and degradation in the next street as if they were practiced in Brazil or Japan; a pen as ready to expose and reprove the crimes whereby wealth is amassed and luxury enjoyed in our own country as if they had only been committed by Turks or Pagans in Asia some centuries ago.\\" In conformity with these principles Greeley lent his support to all proposals for ameliorating the condition of the labouring men by industrial education, by improved methods of farming, or even by such radical means as the socialistic Fourier Association. He strongly advocated the protective tariff because he believed that it was for the advantage of the workingman; and the same sympathy led him to give serious attention to the discussion of women's rights with special reference to the equal economic status of women. There were besides many lesser causes in which the Tribune displayed its spirit of liberalism, such as temperance reform, capital punishment, the Irish repeals, and the liberation of Hungary. On the most important question of the time, the abolition of slavery, Greeley's views were intimately connected with party policy. His antipathy to slavery, based on moral and economic grounds, placed him from the first among the mildly radical reformers. But his views underwent gradual intensification. Acknowledged the most influential Whig party editor in 1844, he had by 1850 become the most influential anti-slavery editor—the spokesman not of Whigs merely but of a great class of Northerners who were thoroughly antagonistic to slavery but who had not been satisfied with either the non-political war of Garrison or the one-plank political efforts of the Free Soil party. This influence was greatly increased between 1850 and 1854 by some of the most vigorous and trenchant editorial writing America has ever known. The circulation of the Tribune in 1850 was, all told, a little less than sixty thousand, two-thirds of which was the Weekly. In 1854 the Weekly alone had a circulation of 112,000 copies. But even this figure is not the measure of the Tribune's peculiar influence, \\"for it was pre-eminently the journal of the rural districts, and one copy did service for many readers. To the people in the Adirondack wilderness it was a political bible, and the well-known scarcity of Democrats there was attributed to it. Yet it was as freely read by the intelligent people living on the Western Reserve of Ohio\\", (James Ford Rhodes) and in Wisconsin and Illinois. The work of Greeley and his associates in these years gave a new strength and a new scope and outlook to American journalism. Greeley was a vigorous advocate of freedom of the press, especially in the 1830s and 1840s. He fought numerous libel lawsuits waged battles with the New York City postmaster, and shrugged off threats of duels and physical violence to his body. Greeley used his hard-hitting editorials to alert the public to dangers to press freedom. He would not tolerate any threats to freedom and democracy which curtailed the ability of the press to serve as a watchdog against corruption and a positive agency of social reform. After replacing Greeley Whitelaw Reid became the powerful long-time editor of the Tribune. He emphasized the importance of partisan newspapers in 1879: : The true statesman and the really influential editor are those who are able to control and guide parties. ... There is an old question as to whether a newspaper controls public opinion or public opinion controls the newspaper. This at least is true: that editor best succeeds who best interprets the prevailing and the better tendencies of public opinion, and, who, whatever his personal views concerning it, does not get himself too far out of relations to it. He will understand that a party is not an end, but a means; will use it if it lead to his end, -- will use some other if that serve better, but will never commit the folly of attempting to reach the end without the means. ... Of all the puerile follies that have masqueraded before High Heaven in the guise of Reform, the most childish has been the idea that the editor could vindicate his independence only by sitting on the fence and throwing stones with impartial vigor alike at friend and foe.Whitelaw Reid, American and English Studies, Vol. II (1913), pp. 258-60 =Henry Raymond and the New York Times= Henry Jarvis Raymond, who began his journalistic career on the Tribune and gained further experience in editing the respectable, old-fashioned, political Courier and Enquirer, perceived that there was an opening for a type of newspaper that should stand midway between Greeley, the moralist and reformer, and Bennett, the cynical, non-moral news- monger. He was able to interest friends in raising the hundred thousand dollars that he thought essential to the success of his enterprise. This sum is significant of the development of American daily journalism, for Greeley had started the Tribune only ten years earlier with a capital of one thousand dollars, and Bennett had founded the Herald with nothing at all. On this sound financial basis, Raymond began the career of the New York Times with his business partner George Jones on September 18, 1851, and made it a success from the outset. He perfected his news-gathering forces and brought into play his intimate acquaintance with men of affairs to open up the sources of information. Above all he set a new standard for foreign service. The American public never had a more general and intelligent interest in European affairs than in the middle years of the 19th century. The leading papers directed their best efforts toward sustaining and improving their foreign service, and Raymond used a brief vacation in Europe to establish for his paper a system of correspondence as trustworthy, if not as inclusive, as that of the Herald or Tribune. If our newspapers today are immeasurably in advance of those of sixty years ago in almost every field of journalism, there is only here and there anything to compare in worth with the foreign correspondence of that time. The men who wrote from the news centers of Europe were persons of wide political knowledge and experience, and social consequence. They had time and ability to do their work thoroughly, carefully, and intelligently, innocent of superficial effort toward sensation, of the practices of inaccurate brevity and irresponsible haste, which began with the laying of the Atlantic cable. The Tribune spoke for the Republican party in 1864 The theory of journalism announced by Raymond in the Times marks another advance over the party principles of his predecessors. He thought that a newspaper might assume the rôle now of a party paper, now of an organ of non-partisan, independent thought, and still be regarded by the great body of its readers as steadily guided by principles of sincere public policy. An active ambition for political preferment prevented him from achieving this ideal. Although he professed conservatism only in those cases where conservatism was essential to the public good and radicalism in everything that might require radical treatment and radical reform, the spirit of opposition to the Tribune, as well as his temperamental leanings, carried him definitely to the conservative side. He was by nature inclined to accept the established order and make the best of it. Change, if it came, should come not through radical agitation and revolution, but by cautious and gradual evolution. The world needed brushing, not harrowing. Such ideas, as he applied them to journalism, appealed to moderate men, reflected the opinions of a large and influential class somewhere between the advanced thinkers and theorists and the mass of men more likely to be swayed by passions of approbation or protest than by reason. It was the tone of the Times that especially distinguished it from its contemporaries. In his first issue Raymond announced his purpose to write in temperate and measured language and to get into a passion as rarely as possible. \\"There are few things in this world which it is worth while to get angry about; and they are just the things anger will not improve.\\" In controversy he meant to avoid abusive language. His style was gentle, candid, and decisive, and achieved its purpose by facility, clearness, and moderation rather than by powerful fervor and invective. His editorials were generally cautious, impersonal, and finished in form. With abundant self-respect and courtesy, he avoided, as one of his coadjutors said, vulgar abuse of individuals, unjust criticism, or narrow and personal ideas. He had that degree and kind of intelligence that enabled him to appreciate two principles of modern journalism—the application of social ethics to editorial conduct and the maintenance of a comprehensive spirit. As he used them, these were positive, not negative virtues. Vile gossip and scandal spew from the press in the 1888 Puck cartoon Raymond's contribution to journalism, then, was not the introduction of revolutionizing innovations in any department of the profession but a general improving and refining of its tone, a balancing of its parts, sensitizing it to discreet and cultivated popular taste. Taking The Times of London as his model, he tried to combine in his paper the English standard of trustworthiness, stability, inclusiveness, and exclusiveness, with the energy and news initiative of the best American journalism; to preserve in it an integrity of motive and a decorum of conduct such as he possessed as a gentleman. =Postwar trends= Newspapers continued to play a major political role. In rural areas, the weekly newspaper published in the county seat played a major role. In the larger cities, different factions of the party have their own papers.Mark Wahlgren Summers, The press gang: newspapers and politics, 1865-1878 (1994) online During the Reconstruction era (1865-1877), leading editors increasingly turned against corruption represented by President Grant and his Republican Party. They strongly supported the third-party Liberal Republican movement of 1872, which nominated Horace Greeley for president.Matthew T. Downey, \\"Horace Greeley and the Politicians: The Liberal Republican Convention in 1872.\\" Journal of American History (1967) 53#4 pp: 727-750 in JSTOR The Democratic Party endorsed Greeley officially, but many Democrats could not accept the idea of voting for the man who had been their fiercest enemy for decades; he lost in a landslide. Most of the 430 Republican newspapers in the Reconstruction South were edited by scalawags (Southern born white men) – only 20 percent were edited by carpetbaggers (recent arrivals from the North who formed the opposing faction in the Republican Party. White businessmen generally boycotted Republican papers, which survived through government patronage.)Stephen L. Vaughn, ed., Encyclopedia of American journalism (2007) p 441.Richard H. Abbott, For Free Press and Equal Rights: Republican Newspapers in the Reconstruction South (2004). Newspapers were a major growth industry in the late nineteenth century. The number of daily papers grew from 971 to 2226, 1880 to 1900. Weekly newspapers were published in smaller towns, especially county seats, or for German, Swedish and other immigrant subscribers. They grew from 9,000 to 14,000, and by 1900 the United States published more than half of the newspapers in the world, with two copies per capita. Out on the frontier, the first need for a boom town was a newspaper. The new states of North and South Dakota by 1900 had 25 daily papers, and 315 weeklies. Oklahoma was still not a state, but it could boast of nine dailies and nearly a hundred weeklies. In the largest cities the newspapers competed fiercely, using newsboys to hawk copies and carriers to serve subscribers. Financially, the major papers depended on advertising, which paid in proportion to the circulation base. By the 1890s in New York City, especially during the Spanish–American War, circulations reached 1 million a day for Pulitzer's World and Hearst's Journal. While smaller papers relied on loyal Republican or Democratic readers who appreciated the intense partisanship of the editorials, the big-city papers realized they would lose half their potential audience by excessive partisanship, so they took a more ambiguous position, except at election time.Arthur Meier Schlesinger, The Rise of the City: 1878-1898 (1933) pp 185-87 Journalism was an attractive, but low- paid profession that drew ambitious young men starting their careers, and a few women. Editors were too busy condensing and rewriting and meeting deadlines to provide much tutelage. Reporters learned the craft by reading and discussing news stories among themselves, and following the tips and suggestions of more experienced colleagues. Reporters developed a personal rather than a professional code of ethics, and implemented their own work rules. Falsification was never allowed but increasingly the editors demanded sensationalistic perspectives, and juicy tidbits regardless of the news value.Randall S. Sumpter, Before Journalism Schools: How Gilded Age Reporters Learned the Rules (2018) Online review After the Civil War, there were several transitions in the newspaper industry. Many of the main founders of the modern press died, including Greeley, Raymond, Bennett, Bowles. and Bryant. Their successors continued the basic policies and approaches, but were less innovative. The civil war put a premium on news reporting, rather than editorials, and the news columns became increasingly important, with speed of the essence as multiple newspapers competed on the city streets for customers. The major papers issued numerous editions the day each with blaring headlines to capture attention. Reporting became more prestigious. There was no newspaper that exerted the national influence of Greeley's New York Tribune. Western cities, developed influential newspapers of their own in Chicago, San Francisco and St. Louis; the Southern press went into eclipse as the region lost its political influence and talented young journalists headed North for their careers. The Associated Press became increasingly important and efficient, producing a vast quantity of reasonably accurate, factual reporting on state and national events that editors used to service the escalating demand for news. Circulation growth was facilitated by new technology, such as the stereotype, by which 10 or more high-speed presses could print the same pages.Allan Nevins, The Emergence of Modern America: 1865-1878 (1927) pp 240-41 With the movement of thousands of people with the conclusion of the Civil War new territories and states experienced and influx of settlers. The growth of a state and territory could be measured by the growth of the areas newspapers. With settlers pushing westward communities were considered stable if they had a newspaper publishing. This was a form of communication for all of the settlers and pioneers that lived in the far, rural communities. Larger, more established towns would begin to grow multiple newspapers. One of the papers would promote a Democratic view and the other Republican.

There were widely held values, such as political corruption, corporate crime, child labor, conditions in slums and prisons, unsanitary conditions in food processing plants (such as meat), fraudulent claims by manufacturers of patent medicines, labor racketeering, and similar topics. In British English however the term is applied to sensationalist scandal-mongering journalist, not driven by any social [original text missing; \\"journalist\\" above likely should be \\"journalism\\" or \\"a ... journalist.\\"]. The term muckraker is most usually associated in America with a group of American investigative reporters, novelists and critics in the Progressive Era from the 1890s to the 1920s. It also applies to post 1960 journalists who follow in the tradition of those from that period. See History of American newspapers for Muckrakers in the daily press. Muckrakers have most often sought, in the past, to serve the public interest by uncovering crime, corruption, waste, fraud and abuse in both the public and private sectors. In the early 1900s, muckrakers shed light on such issues by writing books and articles for popular magazines and newspapers such as Cosmopolitan, The Independent, Collier's Weekly and McClure's. Some of the most famous of the early muckrakers are Ida Tarbell, Lincoln Steffens, and Ray Stannard Baker. History of term muckraker President Theodore Roosevelt coined the term 'muckraker' in a 1906 speech when he likened the muckrakers to the Man with the Muckrake, a character in John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (1678).Mark Neuzil, \\"Hearst, Roosevelt, and the Muckrake Speech of 1906: A New Perspective.\\" Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly 73#1 (1996) pp: 29-39. Roosevelt disliked their relentless negativism and he attacked them for stretching the truth: > There are, in the body politic, economic and social, many and grave evils, > and there is urgent necessity for the sternest war upon them. There should > be relentless exposure of and attack upon every evil man whether politician > or business man, every evil practice, whether in politics, in business, or > in social life.

The term originated during the circulation battles between Joseph Pulitzer's New York World and William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal from 1895 to about 1898, and can refer specifically to this period. Both papers were accused by critics of sensationalizing the news in order to drive up circulation, although the newspapers did serious reporting as well. The New York Press coined the term \\"Yellow Journalism\\" in early 1897 to describe the papers of Pulitzer and Hearst.W. Joseph Campbell, Yellow journalism: Puncturing the myths, defining the legacies (Greenwood, 2001) Origins: Pulitzer v. Hearst Joseph Pulitzer purchased the World in 1882 after making the St. Louis Post-Dispatch the dominant daily in that city. The publisher had gotten his start editing a German-language publication in St. Louis, and saw a great untapped market in the nation's immigrant classes. Pulitzer strove to make The World an entertaining read, and filled his paper with pictures, games and contests that drew in readers, particularly those who used English as a second language. Crime stories filled many of the pages, with headlines like \\"Was He A Suicide?\\" and \\"Screaming for Mercy\\". Pulitzer provided a bargain: he only charged two cents per issue but gave readers eight and sometimes 12 pages of information (the only other two-cent paper in the city never exceeded four pages). While there were many sensational stories in the World, they were by no means the only pieces, or even the dominant ones. Pulitzer believed that newspapers were public institutions with a duty to improve society, and he put the World in the service of social reform. During a heat wave in 1883, World reporters went into the Manhattan's tenements, writing stories about the appalling living conditions of immigrants and the toll the heat took on the children. Stories headlined \\"How Babies Are Baked\\" and \\"Lines of Little Hearses\\" spurred reform and drove up circulation. Just two years after Pulitzer took it over, the World became the highest circulation newspaper in New York, aided in part by its strong ties to the Democratic Party. Older publishers, envious of Pulitzer's success, began criticizing the World, harping on its crime stories and stunts while ignoring its more serious reporting—trends that influenced the popular perception of yellow journalism, both then and now. Charles Dana, editor of the New York Sun, attacked the World and said Pulitzer was \\"deficient in judgment and in staying power.\\" Pulitzer's approach made an impression on William Randolph Hearst, a mining heir who acquired the San Francisco Examiner from his father in 1887. Hearst read the World while studying at Harvard University and resolved to make the Examiner as bright as Pulitzer's paper. Under his leadership, the Examiner devoted 24 percent of its space to crime, presenting the stories as morality plays, and sprinkled adultery and \\"nudity\\" (by 19th century standards) on the front page. A month after taking over the paper, the Examiner ran this headline about a hotel fire: > HUNGRY, FRANTIC FLAMES. They Leap Madly Upon the Splendid Pleasure Palace by > the Bay of Monterey, Encircling Del Monte in Their Ravenous Embrace From > Pinnacle to Foundation. Leaping Higher, Higher, Higher, With Desperate > Desire. Running Madly Riotous Through Cornice, Archway and Facade. Rushing > in Upon the Trembling Guests with Savage Fury. Appalled and Panic-Stricken > the Breathless Fugitives Gaze Upon the Scene of Terror. The Magnificent > Hotel and Its Rich Adornments Now a Smoldering heap of Ashes. The \\"Examiner\\" > Sends a Special Train to Monterey to Gather Full Details of the Terrible > Disaster. Arrival of the Unfortunate Victims on the Morning's Train—A > History of Hotel del Monte—The Plans for Rebuilding the Celebrated > Hostelry—Particulars and Supposed Origin of the Fire. Hearst could go overboard in his crime coverage; one of his early pieces, regarding a \\"band of murderers\\", attacked the police for forcing Examiner reporters to do their work for them. But while indulging in these stunts, the Examiner also increased its space for international news, and sent reporters out to uncover municipal corruption and inefficiency. In one celebrated story, Examiner reporter Winifred Black was admitted into a San Francisco hospital and discovered that indigent women were treated with \\"gross cruelty\\". The entire hospital staff was fired the morning the piece appeared. New York With the Examiner's success established by the early 1890s, Hearst began shopping for a New York newspaper. Hearst purchased the New York Journal in 1895, a penny paper that Pulitzer's brother Albert had sold to a Cincinnati publisher the year before. Metropolitan newspapers started going after department store advertising in the 1890s, and discovered the larger circulation base, the better. This drove Hearst; following Pulitzer's earlier strategy, he kept the Journal's price at one cent (compared to The Worlds two cent price) while doubling the size to 16 pages. Crime news featured big bold headlines, and startling graphic art. The approach worked, and as the Journals circulation jumped to 150,000, Pulitzer had to cut his price to a penny, hoping to drive his young competitor (who was subsidized by his family's fortune) into bankruptcy. In a counterattack, Hearst raided the staff of the World in 1896. In the 1880s Pulitzer had annoyed his rivals when he raided their staffs; now it was his turn. Hearst picked off the best journalists, especially those who considered Pulitzer a difficult man to work for. Although the competition between the World and the Journal was fierce, the papers were temperamentally alike. Both were Democratic, both were sympathetic to labor and immigrants (a sharp contrast to publishers like the New York Tribune's Whitelaw Reid, who blamed their poverty on moral defects), and both invested enormous resources in their Sunday publications, which functioned like weekly magazines, going beyond the normal scope of daily journalism.Joseph W. Campbell, The Year That Defined American Journalism: 1897 and the Clash of Paradigms (Routledge, 2006). Their Sunday entertainment features included the first color comic strip pages, and some theorize that the term yellow journalism originated there, while as noted above the New York Press left the term it invented undefined. The Yellow Kid, a comic strip revolving around a bald child in a yellow nightshirt, became exceptionally popular when cartoonist Richard Outcault began drawing it in the World in early 1896. When Hearst predictably hired Outcault away, Pulitzer asked artist George Luks to continue the strip with his characters, giving the city two Yellow Kids. The use of \\"yellow journalism\\" as a synonym for over-the-top sensationalism in the U.S. apparently started with more serious newspapers commenting on the excesses of \\"the Yellow Kid papers\\". Spanish–American War Pulitzer and Hearst are often credited (or blamed) for drawing the nation into the Spanish–American War with sensationalist stories or outright lying. In fact, the vast majority of Americans did not live in New York City, and the decision makers who did live there probably relied more on staid newspapers like the Times, the Sun or the Post. The most famous example of the exaggeration is the apocryphal story that artist Frederic Remington telegrammed Hearst to tell him all was quiet in Cuba and \\"There will be no war.\\" Hearst responded \\"Please remain. You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war.\\" The story (a version of which appears in the Hearst-inspired Orson Welles' film Citizen Kane) first appeared in the memoirs of reporter James Creelman in 1901, and there is no other source for it. But Hearst was a war hawk after a rebellion broke out in Cuba in 1895. Stories of Cuban virtue and Spanish brutality soon dominated his front page. While the accounts were of dubious accuracy, the newspaper readers of the 19th century did not need, or necessarily want, his stories to be pure nonfiction. Historian Michael Robertson has said that \\"Newspaper reporters and readers of the 1890s were much less concerned with distinguishing among fact-based reporting, opinion and literature.\\" Pulitzer's treatment in the World emphasizes horrible explosion Hearst's treatment was more effective and focused on the enemy who set the bomb—and offered a huge reward to readers Hearst's treatment was more effective and focused on the enemy who set the bomb—and offered a huge reward to readers. Pulitzer, though lacking Hearst's resources, kept the story on his front page. The yellow press covered the revolution extensively and often inaccurately, but conditions on Cuba were horrific enough. The island was in a terrible economic depression, and Spanish general Valeriano Weyler, sent to crush the rebellion, herded Cuban peasants into concentration camps and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. Having clamored for a fight for two years, Hearst took credit for the conflict when it came: A week after the United States declared war on Spain, he ran \\"How do you like the Journal's war?\\" on his front page. Modern scholarship rejects the notion that Hearst or Yellow Journalism caused the war. In fact, President William McKinley never read the Journal, and newspapers like the Tribune and the New York Evening Post, both staunchly Republican, demanded restraint. Moreover, journalism historians have noted that yellow journalism was largely confined to New York City, and that newspapers in the rest of the country did not follow their lead. The Journal and the World were not among the top ten sources of news in regional papers, and the stories simply did not make a splash outside Gotham. War came because public opinion was sickened by the bloodshed, and because conservative leaders like McKinley realized that Spain had lost control of Cuba. These factors weighed more on the president's mind than the melodramas in the New York Journal.George W. Auxier, \\"Middle Western Newspapers and the Spanish American War, 1895-1898.\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review 26.4 (1940): 523-534. online =After the War= Hearst placed his newspapers at the service of the Democrats during the 1900 presidential election. He later campaigned for his party's presidential nomination, but lost much of his personal prestige when columnist Ambrose Bierce and editor Arthur Brisbane published separate columns months apart that called for the assassination of McKinley. When McKinley was shot on September 6, 1901, the Republican press went livid, accusing Hearst of driving Leon Czolgosz to the deed. Hearst did not know of Bierce's column and claimed to have pulled Brisbane's after it ran in a first edition, but the incident would haunt him for the rest of his life and all but destroyed his presidential ambitions. Pulitzer returned the World to its crusading roots as the new century dawned. By the time of his death in 1911, the World was a widely respected publication, the flagship of the Democratic Party, and would remain a progressive organ until its demise in 1931. =In popular culture= In many movies, sitcoms and other works of fiction, reporters often use yellow journalism against the main character, which typically works to set up the reporter character as an antagonist. This is done so often that it is sometimes considered to be a cliché. For instance in the Spider-Man franchise, publisher J. Jonah Jameson spitefully and constantly smears the superhero in his Daily Bugle despite having his suspicions repeatedly proven wrong. Likewise, in the 1997 James Bond movie Tomorrow Never Dies, the deranged media magnate and main antagonist Elliot Carver (played by Jonathan Pryce) tries to start a war between Great Britain and China via sensationalized news stories; in the movie, he even alludes to Hearst's role in the Spanish–American War, using the apocryphal quote \\"You provide the pictures and I'll provide the war\\" as an excuse to prove that his plot is not new. (This quotation is also in Orson Welles' classic film Citizen Kane.) In Thomas Harris' novel Red Dragon, from the Hannibal Lecter series, a sleazy yellow journalist named Freddy Lounds, who writes for the National Tattler tabloid, is tortured and set aflame for penning a negative article about serial killer Francis Dolarhyde. In the movie Bob Roberts, Senator Roberts characterizes media investigations into his business dealings (and particularly the links between his anti-drugs charity and CIA drug trafficking) as \\"yellow journalism\\". The Chicago Daily News in 1901 relied on newsboys hawking the headlines. =Newsboys in the front line of the circulation wars= Sensationalism made readers want to purchase newspapers, and circulation managers had to find new ways to handle the much heavier load. They typically relied primarily on newspaper hawkers or newsboy who sold individual copies of one paper on downtown streets. There also were plenty of newsstands that sold different titles from a stationary stand or storefront. Vending machines came in the 1890s. Home delivery was not uncommon in the early 1900, but became increasingly important as paperboysbegan to deliver more newspapers to subscribers. A busy corner would have several hawkers, each representing one major newspapers. They might carry a poster board with giant headlines, provided by the newspaper. The downtown newsboy started fading out after World War II, when publishers began to emphasize home delivery. Teenage newsboys delivered papers on a daily basis for subscribers who paid them monthly. Hawkers typically purchased a bundle of 100 copies from a wholesaler, who in turn purchased them from the publisher. Legally every state considered the newsboys to be independent contractors, and not employees, so they generally were not subject to child labor laws. Newsboys' were not employees of the newspapers but rather purchased the papers from wholesalers in packets of 100 and peddled them as independent agents. Unsold papers could not be returned. The newsboys typically earned around 30 cents a day and often worked until late at night.(nd) Child labor in America 1908-1912: Photographs of Lewis W. Hine. Retrieved 17 June 2007. - See \\"Newsies\\". Cries of \\"Extra, extra!\\" were often heard into the morning hours as newsboys attempted to hawk every last paper.David Nasaw, (1999) p. 9. The local delivery boy pulling a wagon or riding a bicycle while tossing the morning or evening paper onto the front porch was a product of the 1930s. Newspapers lost circulation and advertising as the economy went down, and needed to boost revenues and cut expenses. Starting in 1930, the International Circulation Managers' Association launched a national operation to show local newspaper management how to boost home newspaper readership. The designed a prepackaged curriculum in door-to-door subscription marketing. This movement created the middle-class newspaper boy and permanently altered the relationship between teenage years and entrepreneurial enterprise.Todd A. Postol, \\"Creating the American Newspaper Boy: Middle-Class Route Service and Juvenile Salesmanship in the Great Depression.\\" \\"Journal of Social History (1997) 31#2: 327-345. online Circulation managers solved their problem. The teenage boys. They were still independent contractors rather than employees, but the circulation manager designed the routes, and taught the boys how to collect and account for the subscription money. To inspire the young entrepreneurs, they created a distinctive gendered managerial philosophy of masculine guidance. It inspired the boys' entrepreneurship and stabilized their work habits, while providing extra money for tight family budgets.Todd A. Postol, \\"Masculine Guidance: Boys, Men, and Newspapers, 1930–1939.\\" Enterprise & Society 1.2 (2000): 355-390. \\"Boys Selling Newspapers on Brooklyn Bridge\\" by Lewis Hine, 1908 American photographer Lewis Hine crusaded against child labor by taking photographs that exposed bad conditions, especially in factories and coal mines. In sharp contrast, however, Hine's photographs of newsboys them did not depict another appalling form of dangerous child labor or immigrant poverty, for they were not employees. There were working on their own as independent young entrepreneurs and Hine captures the image of comradeship, youthful masculinity and emerging entrepreneurship. The symbolic newsboy became an iconic image in discourses about childhood, ambition and independence.Oenone Kubie, \\"Reading Lewis Hine's Photography of Child Street Labour, 1906–1918.\\" Journal of American Studies 50.4 (2016): 873-897. Newsboys became an iconic image of youthful entrepreneurship. Famous American newsboys included Bruce Barton, Ralph Bunche, Joe DiMaggio, Thomas Edison, Dwight Eisenhower, Joe Kennedy, Sam Rayburn, Walter Reuther, David Sarnoff, Cardinal Spellman, Harry Truman and Mark Twain.David E. Whisnant, \\"Selling the gospel news, or: The strange career of Jimmy Brown the newsboy.\\" Journal of Social History 5.3 (1972): 269-309, at p. 271. Ethnic press While the English language press served the general population, practically every ethnic group had its own newspapers in their own language. Many immigrant populations in the 19th century were drawn to the rich farmlands of the Great Plains states such as Minnesota, Nebraska, and Iowa. In small communities that drew large influxes of specific ethnic groups community newspapers became a place where political and religious interests could be promoted in familiar languages. Many of these papers also wanted to embody the spirit of American democracy within their readers. One paper committed to ensuring all Danish-American citizens took part and exercised their rights was the Den Danske Pionerr or The Danish Pioneer in translation. This paper was backed by Sophus F. Neble a Danish immigrant who had failed at dairy farming and instead set to typing and enhancing the paper in Omaha, Nebraska. Under Neble that paper rose to a circulation of 40,000 during World War I. German publishers were one of the most influential immigrant groups in developing the ethnic press. By 1890 there were 1,000 German-language newspapers published each year in the United States. Prior to World War I Germans were accepted as a reputable immigrant group with over five million immigrants moving to the country between 1820 and 1924. However once America entered the conflict national opinion changed and German culture was no longer welcome in the country. A large amount of anger was focused at German newspapers which some American's viewed as supporting Germany in the war effort. In October 1917 Congress passed legislation that sought to control foreign-language press. The laws stated that newspapers must translate all printed material concerning the war. The German papers nearly all folded in World War I, and after 1950 the other ethnic groups had largely dropped foreign language papers.Susan Olzak and Elizabeth West. \\"Ethnic conflict and the rise and fall of ethnic newspapers.\\" American Sociological Review (1991): 458-474. in JSTOR; Full text online This drop of foreign-press publications during World War I was not only felt by German-Americans. In 1915 the circulation of the daily Yiddish newspapers was half a million in New York City alone, and 600,000 nationally. In addition thousands more subscribed to the numerous weekly papers and the many magazines.Yiddish is a dialect of German written in the Hebrew alphabet and based entirely in the Jewish population. Representative was the situation in Chicago, where the Polish Americans sustained diverse political cultures, each with its own newspaper. In 1920 the community had a choice of five daily papers - from the Socialist Dziennik Ludowy [People's daily] (1907–25) to the Polish Roman Catholic Union's Dziennik Zjednoczenia [Union daily] (1921–39) - all of which supported workers' struggles for better working conditions and were part of a broader program of cultural and educational activities. The decision to subscribe to a particular paper reaffirmed a particular ideology or institutional network based on ethnicity and class, which lent itself to different alliances and different strategies. Most papers preached assimilation into middle class American values and supported Americanization programs, but still included news of the home country.Jon Bekken, \\"Negotiating Class and Ethnicity: the Polish-language Press in Chicago.\\" Polish American Studies 2000 57(2): 5-29. After 1965, there was a large surge of new immigration, especially from Asia. They set up few major papers. By the 21st century, over 10 percent of the population was Hispanic. They patronized Spanish-language radio and television, but outside large cities it was hard to find Spanish newspapers, books or magazines for sale.Leara D. Rhodes, The Ethnic Press: Shaping the American Dream (Peter Lang Publishing; 2010) Chains and syndicates, 1900–1960 Ad for the Hearst chain, 1923 E. W. Scripps founder of the first national newspaper chain in the United States, sought in the early years of the 20th century to create syndicated services based on product differentiation while appealing to the needs of his readers. Success, Scripps believed, depended on providing what competing newspapers did not. To achieve this end while controlling costs and centralizing management, Scripps developed a national wire service (United Press', a news features service (Newspaper Enterprise Association), and other services. Scripps successfully reached a large market at low costs in new and different ways and captured the interests of a wider range of readers, especially women who were more interested in features than in political news. However, the local editors lost a degree of autonomy and local news coverage diminished significantly.Gerald J. Baldasty, \\"Centralizing Control in Newspaper Chains: E. W. Scripps and the Newspaper Enterprise Association, 1902–1908,\\" American Journalism, April 2001, Vol. 18 Issue 2, pp 13–38 In part to aid in his political ambitions, Hearst opened newspapers in other cities, among them Chicago, Los Angeles and Boston. By the mid-1920s he had a nationwide string of 28 newspapers, among them the Los Angeles Examiner, the Boston American, the Chicago Examiner, the Detroit Times, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and the Washington Times and Washington Herald and his flagship the San Francisco Examiner. In 1924 he opened the New York Daily Mirror, a racy tabloid frankly imitating the New York Daily News. Among his other holdings were the magazines Cosmopolitan, and Harper's Bazaar; two news services, Universal News and International News Service; King Features Syndicate; and a film company, Cosmopolitan Productions, as well as real estate. Hearst used his influence to help Franklin D. Roosevelt win the 1932 Democratic nomination. However he broke with Roosevelt in 1935 because Roosevelt did not want to fund the veterans' bonus. After that the Hearst chain became the bitter enemy of the New Deal from the right. The other major chains likewise were hostile, and in 1936 Roosevelt had the support of only 10% of the nation's newspapers (by circulation). Competition: television and Internet, 1970–present A 2015 report from the Brookings Institution shows that the number of newspapers per hundred million population fell from 1,200 (in 1945) to 400 in 2014. Over that same period, circulation per capita declined from 35 percent in the mid-1940s to under 15 percent. The number of newspaper journalists has decreased from 43,000 in 1978 to 33,000 in 2015. Other traditional news media have also suffered. Since 1980 the television networks have lost half their audience for evening newscasts; the audience for radio news has shrunk by 40%.Elaine C. Kamarck and Ashley Gabriele, \\"The news today: 7 trends in old and new media\\" Center for Effective Public Management at Brookings, November 10, 2015 =Rapid decline in circulation= According to annual analyses of circulation conducted by the Pew Research Center, daily newspaper circulation in the United States peaked in 1984, while Sunday paper circulation continued to rise until 1993. Since that time, the readership of newspapers has been on a steady decline.\\"Newspapers Fact Sheet\\" (July 9, 2019) This coincides approximately with the beginning of home Internet use. The rate of the decline in readership increased greatly in 2004, and continued experience its sharpest declines in recent history. The recent slide continues a decades-long trend and adds to the woes of a mature industry already struggling with layoffs and facing the potential sale of some of its flagships. In addition newsstand sales of magazines fell more than 4 percent, to about 48.7 million copies. Among domestic newsweeklies, Time magazine reported the biggest drop. Analysts pointed to the increased use of the Internet, noting that more people in 2006 read the New York Times online than on paper. Newspaper readership goes up with education, and education levels are rising. That favorable trend is offset by the choice of people in each age group to read fewer papers.Katharine Q. Seelye, \\"Newspaper Circulation Falls Sharply\\", New York Times October 31, 2006. online and Journalism.org The State of the News Media 2004 (2005) online at The decline in readership and revenues continued steadily by year after that. American dailies lost 60% of their ad revenue--$30 billion—between 2005 and 2014. The typical response is a drastic cut in the employment of journalists. Their numbers also fell 60% from about 50,000 in 2005 to 20,000 in 2014.\\"Up against the paywall\\" The Economist (21 Nov 2015) p 62 By 2018, the overall readership of US newspapers had dropped to 1940 levels, and advertising revenue was at the same level as it had been in 1980. Resisting somewhat the trend to become fully digital, in 2018 sixty-five percent of advertising revenue still stemmed from non-digital ads.Op Cit, \\"Newspapers Fact Sheet\\" =Corporate turmoil= After 1950 newspaper readership grew slower than the population. After 1990 the number of readers started to decline. The number of papers also declined, especially as afternoon papers collapsed in the face of television news. However sales of advertising remained strong and profits were still high. In 2002, newspapers reported advertising revenues of $44 billion. According to Morton Research, a market analysis firm, in 2003, the 13 major publicly traded newspaper companies earned an average pretax profit margin of 19 percent.see [journalism.org (2005)] From 1987 to 2003 showed an industry in transition. Although 305 newspapers ceased daily publication during this period, 64% of these newspapers continued to serve their markets as weeklies, merged dailies, or zoned editions. The 111 dailies that went out of business were offset by 63 dailies that started publication. In effect, the newspaper industry lost service in 48 markets during 17 years. After 2003 the process speeded up, as revenue from advertising fell and circulation declined, as more people relied on the internet for news.Hiromi Cho et al., \\"An Industry in Transition: Entry and Exit in Daily Newspaper Markets, 1987-2003,\\" Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, Summer 2006, Vol. 83 Issue 2, pp. 381–396 =Spanish and Asian language newspapers= The first Spanish-language newspapers in the United States were El Misisipí and El Mensagero Luisianés, which began publication in New Orleans in 1808 and 1809. La Gaceta de Texas and El Mexicano, the first newspapers in what is now considered the Southwest, were written and typeset in Nacogdoches, Texas but printed in Natchitoches, Louisiana in 1813. They supported the Mexican independence movement. The Latino Print Network estimated the combined circulation of all Hispanic newspapers in the United States at 16.2 million in 2003. Mainstream (English) daily newspapers owned 46 Hispanic publications—nearly all of them weeklies—that have a combined circulation of 2.9 million. From 1990 to 2000, the number of Hispanic newspapers alone nearly doubled from 355 to 652 In 1976 the Miami Herald started El Herald, a one-page Spanish insert that was reborn in 1987 as El Nuevo Herald, a daily supplement to the Miami Herald. El Nuevo Herald became independent of the Herald in 1998 and by 2003 had an average daily circulation of 90,300. In 1981, the Gannett chain entered daily Spanish publishing when it bought El Diario/La Prensa, a 52,000-circulation New York City tabloid that is the nation's oldest Spanish daily. The Tribune Co., Belo Corp. and Knight Ridder launched daily Spanish-language papers in 2003. Hispanic-oriented newspapers and magazines generated $1.3 billion in revenue in 2002. By comparison, the operating revenue that year for Knight Ridder's 32 papers was $2.8 billion. Readership remains small, however. New York City already had two Spanish-language dailies with a combined circulation of about 100,000, as well as papers from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and a score of weeklies. But Louis Sito said their \\"circulation levels were very, very minimal when compared to the population size.\\" (New York, population 8 million, is 27 percent Hispanic; the Bronx, 1.3 million, is 48 percent Hispanic.) Sito urged Newsday publisher Raymond A. Jansen to launch a daily instead of a weekly, and Hoy premiered on November 16, 1998, with a circulation of 25,000. By 2003, Hoy sold 91,000 copies a day in the New York metro area. The Dallas-Fort Worth market contains 1.3 million Latinos—22 percent of the population and growing (estimated to reach 38 percent by 2006). The Dallas Morning News developed Al Día to entice that audience. The Monday- through-Saturday paper debuted in September 2003 with a staff of 50, an initial circulation of 40,000 and a newsstand price of 25 cents. Diario La Estrella began in 1994 as a dual-language insert of the Fort Worth Star- Telegram and first grew into an all-Spanish stand-alone paper with a twice- weekly total circulation of 75,000 copies distributed free via newsstands and selective home delivery. With the notable exception of Viet Mercury, a now- defunct, 35,000-circulation weekly Vietnamese-language paper published by Knight Ridder's San Jose Mercury News, U.S. media companies have generally eschewed the Asian market even though daily papers in Chinese, Korean or Vietnamese are thriving in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and other cities. The Mandarin-language World Journal, which distributes from San Francisco to Toronto and states a circulation (unaudited) of 350,000. World Journal; its biggest competitor, Sing Tao (181,000 circulation unaudited); and Korea Times (254,000, also unaudited) are owned by international media giants based in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Seoul, respectively.Tim Porter, \\"Dismantling the Language Barrier\\" American Journalism Review October/November 2003 online In 2014, Connecting Cleveland, a four-page paper with stories in English and Nepali was launched to serve Nepali-speaking Bhutanese families in the Cleveland, Ohio area.

It has been published in different periods.  Periods  = 1907 - 1908 = A Nosa Terra, was a bilingual Spanish and Galician publication founded in 1907 in A Coruña by the regionalist organization Solidaridad Gallega. It was created under the initiative of Rodrigo Sanz, Manuel Murguía, Manuel Lugrís Freire and Florencio Vaamonde. Its first number appeared on 4 August 1907 and there were sixty issues published during the first run. = 1916 - 1936 = On December 14, 1916, A Nosa Terra was refunded and published by the Irmandades da Fala until 1932 and by Galeguist Party until 1936. During this period, A Nosa Terra was written only in Galician and used as a way to promote galeguism and getting closer to other nations.McKevitt, Kerry Ann. “Os nosos irmáns: intercambios literarios entre a Xeración Nós e as Irmandades da Fala coas literaturas peninsulares (1918-1936)”.

During its time in A Coruña, the headquarters were located in Xosé Iglesias Roura's office, who was its first director. Antón Villar Ponte was his successor until the Fourth Irmandades da Fala Assembly in 1922. In 1932, after the creation of Galeguist Party, A Nosa Terra became its official paper and the headquarters were translated to Pontevedra. In June 1933, A Nosa Terra was suspended due to financial reasons, but later was published again. In 1936 A Nosa Terra published its last issue in this period. = 1942 - 1972 = After the Spanish Civil War ended in 1939, many supporters of the galeguist movement had to leave Spain because of their ideology and settled in South America. On June 28, 1941, Irmandade Galega was founded in Buenos Aires and started to produce A Nosa Terra in that city as a successor of the previous period. Produced irregularly, A Nosa Terra contained information about the activities promoted by the nationalist groups in Buenos Aires and the rest of America. Castelao was named its director until his death in 1950. The final issue appeared in December 1972. = 1977 - 2011 = Spanish caudillo Francisco Franco's death in 1975 favoured the return of many exiled after the civil war. In 1977, a new newspaper named A Nosa Terra started being published weekly in Santiago de Compostela. Like the previous incarnations, it was nationalist and written in Galician only. A Nosa Terra was surrounded by controversy in 1981, when it was cancelled for three months because of its opposition to the Spanish Constitution of 1978. At this time, the headquarters were moved to Vigo. In December 2007, A Nosa Terra redesigned its contents and external view,Manuel Veiga dirixirá a nova A Nosa Terra, A Nosa Terra, 3/12/2007. and they also created an online version. Financial problems always affected the newspaper,'A Nosa Terra' se vuelve virtual, OBELLEIRO, P., El País, 1/9/2010. and it became unsustainable, until in August 2010 its publisher Promocións Culturais Galegas S.A. suspended payments and ended the printed edition.

The society of the Gieselthal is very reminiscent of pre-World War I Germany, and the people speak a German dialect invented by Barr herself. The Gieselthal centaurs call themselves halbpferd (\\"halfhorses\\") and look down on the nomadic \\"gypsy centaurs\\" who come through their valley at intervals. While relations between centaurs and \\"two-leggers\\" are usually cordial, there is normally some distance---centaurs see \\"two-leggers\\" as weak and fragile. Stinz Löwhard is, uniquely among his people, a veteran of the military, having attained the rank of Major, and war-hero status, in the last war fought in his world. He was greatly changed by his eight years' military service, and often feels rather alienated from his neighbors and family on account of it. Even so, he is a loving, faithful husband and tries to be the best father he knows how to be. He is quite wealthy, by the standards of his home, and holds the titles of \\"Räth\\" (council member) and Mayor at various times. The Stinz stories cover his life through his mischievous youth, up through his stormy courtship of his neighbor's daughter Brüna, his induction into the military, some of his war exploits, and his life after his return home.

Ownership, Staff & volunteers The Student Room Group is run by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Newson (who is also the largest shareholder). There are around 70 employees based out of their Brighton office. The Student Room sites are also run by a team of volunteers and helpers, including: Volunteer Section Leaders, Volunteer Team Members, Forum Helpers, Personal Statement Helpers, CV Helpers & Peer Support Volunteers. Volunteers used to be entitled \\"Moderators\\", but have since had moderation responsibility of forum posts decreased from the role to be coordinated instead by a paid out of hours moderation team. The websites  =The Student Room Sections= The main sections of the site are: * Study Help - where students and teachers help each other out. This section now incorporates a range of social learning tools * University Courses - where students can get advice on any university course they may be wanting to study * Universities - with individual forums for each UK university for prospective students to get advice from existing students, and for existing students to connect with each other. There are also University Guides combining student & official content * Careers & Jobs - for discussions about volunteering, careers sectors and job applications * Life & Style - including Health, Relationships and Fitness * Entertainment (formerly Hobbies and Interests) - for discussion on sport, TV Shows, Cars and Music * Debate & Current Affairs - where students can discuss and debate news, politics and philosophy. Also including an online Model House of Commons. * Chat (formerly TSR Community) - for general chat and discussion on all things. The site is designed as a place for UK students and those looking to study at UK universities to find information about studying, courses and careers. There is however a significant international element (who have their own sub forum).International Lounge - The Student Room Another section of the site allows members to use a free personal statement checking service for university admissions.PS Help 16-09-2013 Members may post their personal statement in a forum ready for checking. For privacy, only the poster and members of the checking and administration teams (the former consisting of students already at university) may view the statement. For paying members, when this was such a thing, there was a hidden section consisting of around two hundred arcade games and competition league tables, as well as a secret sub-forum. There are also several other benefits to subscribing to the service, which includes access to Learn Together (see above), custom User Titles and larger avatars.Subscription options 16-09-2013 In total the whole site has well over 300 forums and sub forums. Model House of Commons The \\"Debate and Discussion\\" section of the forum also hosts a Model Parliament based on the UK Parliamentary system. The Model House of Commons [MHoC] is run by an elected Speaker and is made up of 50 MPs who create and vote on legislations. Anyone is free to join the MHoC and they can do so by applying to one of the six parties that operate there: the Labour Party, the Conservative & Unionist Party, the Liberal Democrat Party and the Libertarian Party. (These parties have no affiliation with any real-life party and can have somewhat different ideological stances to real-life parties of the same name). A governmental term lasts 6 months, and the MHoC is currently in its 29th (XXIX) Parliament. The current government is a Liberal Democrat/Labour government with the Conservatives in official opposition. =TSR Wiki= The site has developed its own wiki: the TSR Wiki. Written and edited by students on a range of academic, university, careers & life subjects. This provides a reference source for prospective and current UK students on matters of institutions, examinations, courses, applying and going to university, student travel, night life, careers and health, and other general topics of interest to students. Two of the largest sections of the wiki provided a wide range of revision notes, covering many subjects from GCSE level through to University level. It also offers dozens of examples of personal statements used to apply to UK universities and colleges. T History The forum was created in around 2001 under the name \\"UK Learning\\" as a site for students at university to talk to each other. Since then the forum has grown in popularity and developed into a forum consisting of dozens of sub-forums and thousands of new posts daily. In late 2004 the forum saw a change to its present name of \\"The Student Room\\". UK Learning was originally a portal site, the purpose of which was to push traffic towards profit-oriented sites offering various educational resources such as sample coursework, essays and personal statements. The remainder of the site was a vBulletin-based discussion forum, most of the content of which was derived from usenet posts to which users of the forum could respond through the forum rather than via a usenet client, which enabled the site to rapidly build content (and thus search engine driven traffic) while having only a small user base. Thus, UK Learning/The Student Room has never been a profit-oriented site in itself, though as noted above it does attempt to generate income in the form of optional subscriptions paid by users of the site, advertising banners and voluntary donations from users as a means to offset the large running costs of the site. The connection to the aforementioned profit-oriented sites can still be seen on The Student Room but are no longer the focus of the site. In mid-2002 the portal aspect of the site was dropped in favour of focusing the site around the discussion forum, and the site has remained roughly in this state since. In early 2006 the company which owns TSR was taken over. This new owner, known as CN, set about adding advertisements to the site in order to generate revenue for the running costs. This angered several users as a fundraising drive had recently been held, placement of the advertisements was widely considered intrusive and detrimental, and some of the advertisements were arguably inappropriate. In mid-2006 the owner, CN, detailed ideas for the future of The Student Room; as part of this, CN met a small group of the moderators at a meeting in London. Many ideas were put forward and plans discussed, and over the next few months preparatory work took place for The Student Room to undergo a facelift with the addition of many improvements to attract new members, and on 19 September 2007 the new look website was launched. Media coverage In summer 2004 the forum was also the subject of media coverage after examination questions, from papers yet to be sat, were leaked onto the forum. The user claimed the questions were sample exam questions based on the Edexcel Mathematics exam he was sitting the next day, and asked for help from other users. In May 2007 the site was heavily quoted by the BBC in an article relating to problems faced in an OCR A Level Biology Practical exam after reports to the media from an unnamed member. Some users on the site appeared to have been told far too much about the practical exam by their teachers while others heavily criticised and complained about the difficulty of the exam afterwards. A similar incident was reported in May 2008, again following discussion on OCR Biology A2 practical exams. Following A Level results day in 2007, the wiki section of the site was mentioned in an article in the independent about preparing for university. It mentioned how TSR has a pretty much exhaustive list of what a student had to take to university with them. The site was also mentioned on 16 August 2007 in 'crucial contacts' list for higher education on Nottingham Evening Post website. In August 2008, the site was featured in a half page article in The Times as part of their students supplement produced for the A Level results day. The article looked at the content of the site, picking out key features such as the university discussion forums and the personal statement help section. In February 2009, The Student Room and DIUS (Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills) worked together to produce a resource for people over the age of 21 considering going back to education. The minisite features an interactive map of universities across the country, video interviews with mature students and profiles of members who went to university as a mature student. In October 2013, the website decided to turn off a feature known as 'negative reputation' (or neg rep for short) which allowed users to negatively rate other users' posts. It was claimed by the moderators that the feature put people off expressing their opinions.http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=2490492 The change was met with much consternation, with many users calling for the drastic move's reversal; a few users supported the move as well.

It is about three miles northeast of Lurgan and had a population of 824 in the 2001 Census. Aghagallon has mainly developed along Aghalee Road in a linear fashion with development to the southeast along Colane Road. St Patrick's Church and the adjacent primary school are in the middle of the village. Although the village is named after the townland of Aghagallon, it lies almost wholly within neighbouring Derrynaseer townland. Townlands of Aghagallon Parish The parish of Aghagallon consists of 13 townlands; Aghadrumglasny, Aghagallon, Ballycairn, Ballykeel, Ballymacilrany, Derryclone, Derryhirk, Derrymore, Derrynaseer, Drumaleet, Montiaghs, Tamnyvane, and Tiscallen, The Three Pronged Revolver An incident that took place in Aghagallon in 1790 became known as \\"The Battle of Annaghdroghal Bridge\\". A group of Protestant men from the nearby village of Waringstown, accompanied by flute and drum and under the command of Colonel Sharp, marched from Waringstown at the request of Lord Waring to plough and prepare a field in Aghagallon for a friend and fellow English landowner and Orangeman. Their journey from Waringstown to Aghagallon was a controversial one, with several incidents occurring along the way in the town of Lurgan. As Col. Sharp and his men reached the Annaghdroghal Bridge just east of Aghagallon they were met by local men who refused them passage. A fight occurred and the Battle of Annaghdroghal began. Col. Sharp led his men in the first attack and was fatally wounded by \\"The Darkie\\" McStravick, receiving a chest wound from a three-pronged muck fork. McStravick fled the scene and dumped the fork (\\"The Three Pronged Revolver\\") down a dry well at Derryclone. According to rumour, Darkie Mcstravick had lived in Derryclone, which is why he fled there to dispose of the \\"Three Pronged Revolver\\". The fork was retrieved around 1890 from the well and was presented to a local museum by Phelim McStravick in 2008.  Education  The village has two primary schools, St Patrick's Primary School, Aghagallon and St Mary's Primary School, Derrymore  2001 Census  Aghagallon is classified as a small village or hamlet by the NI Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) (i.e. with population between 500 and 1,000 people).Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service.

Egerton 1994. The collection was discovered by James Halliwell-Phillipps, and also includes Edmund Ironside, another play whose authorship has been attributed by some scholars to William Shakespeare.Sams, Eric. (1986). Shakespeare's Edmund Ironside: The Lost Play. Wildwood Ho. The collection was compiled by a seventeenth century actor in the King's Revels Men, William Cartwright (ca. 1606–1686; not to be confused with his contemporary poet/dramatist of the same name), who later became a bookseller and collector of plays during the English Civil War.Corbin and Sedge, 2002, p. 1. There is no confirmed recorded production of the play during Shakespeare's lifetime, although the well-worn state of the Egerton manuscript, the presence of notations referencing specific actors' names, and the inclusion of instructions within the text's margins suggesting censorship by the Master of Revels all suggest that the play enjoyed heavy use even during the Jacobean period.Id. at 1–3, 38–39. Significantly, it is not known which acting company owned or performed the play.Id. at 40 A transcript of the text was published by the Malone Society in 1929, and in fully edited texts by A. P. Rossiter in 1946, Peter Corbin and Douglas Sedge in 2002, and Michael Egan in 2003. Title and subject matter The play covers the events leading up to the murder of Richard II's uncle, Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, in 1397. The manuscript has no title. Most scholars and theatre companies who have worked on the play call it Thomas of Woodstock or Woodstock, but some entitle it Richard II, Part One, either as the main title or as a sub-title.Corbin and Sedge, 2002, pp. 3–4. Those who elect to call it Richard II, Part One or by similar titles do so because the play describes events immediately prior to Shakespeare's Richard II and provides context for the behaviour of many of Shakespeare's characters. However, this title has been criticised as \\"going too far\\", because it makes the play's relationship to Shakespeare's play seem definitive when it is only speculative.Wilhelmina P. Frijlinck, ed. The First Part of the Reign of King Richard II or Thomas of Woodstock. Malone Society, 1929, p.v. Moreover, events depicted in Woodstock are covered as well in Richard II (such as the farming out of the kingdom and the death of Green), so that play cannot be a sequel in the ordinary meaning of the term. A.P. Rossiter, who edited the play, preferred the title Woodstock since Woodstock is the play's protagonist, not Richard.A.P. Rossiter, Woodstock: A Moral History (London: Chatto & Windus, 1946), p. 26 Corbin and Sedge both throughout their edition evidence that Shakespeare was familiar with the play, drew inspiration from it (especially in King Lear, particularly in the quarto version), and expected audiences to be familiar with it in Richard II, noting that many modern productions reverse the first two scenes to give the audience a better understanding of the events that occurred before the play opens. Authorship Given the play's close relationship to the subject matter of Richard II, Shakespeare's authorship has been suggested, although few of the play's earlier editors supported this speculation. The Malone Society editor makes no reference to the Shakespeare theory.Frijlinck, First Part. A.P. Rossiter states \\"There is not the smallest chance that he was Shakespeare\\", citing the drabness of the verse, while acknowledging that the play's aspirations indicate that \\"There is something of a simplified Shakespeare\\" in the author.Rossiter, Woodstock, p. 73 Other authors have been suggested. In 2001 MacDonald P. Jackson used stylistic analysis to propose Samuel Rowley as a possible author.Macd. P. Jackson, \\"Shakespeare's Richard II and the Anonymous Thomas of Woodstock,\\", in Medieval and Renaissance Drama in England 14 (2001) 17–65. Corbin and Sedge argue that Thomas of Woodstock was written by an author of \\"considerable range and competence\\", but they regard any attribution to Shakespeare \\"or any other author\\" as \\"highly speculative\\". Nonetheless, they note that: :Shakespeare is perhaps the one known dramatist in the 1590s whose dramatic style most closely resembles that of Thomas of Woodstock. The 'Shakespearian' characteristics of the play may be summarised as follows: a sophisticated handling of chronicle material; a careful and fruitful juxtaposition of low life scenes over and against court life; the sense of England as a significant 'character' throughout the play; a sure handling of dramatic technique as in the economical and engaging exposition; the careful drawing of effective female characters (specifically Anne O' Beame [i.e. Anne of Bohemia]); Nimble's malapropisms, anticipating Costard, Dogberry and Mrs. Quickley; the dramatist's ability to manipulate audience sympathy in a complex fashion towards Richard and to present Woodstock as a figure of conscience in a manner which anticipates Gaunt.Corbin and Sedge, 2002, p. 4. In 2006 Michael Egan offered a case for Shakespeare's authorship of the play in a four volume (2100-page) variorum edition, which includes a book-length authorship analysis. His evidence consists for the most part in what he suggests are thousands of verbal parallels. Egan claimed that Ian Robinson supported the attribution of the play to Shakespeare in a 1988 publication, Richard II and Woodstock.Robinson, Ian, Richard II and Woodstock, Brynmill Press, 1988 Retrieved 29 November 2013. but he cited no other adherents to this view. Ward Elliott reported that he had performed stylometric analysis on the manuscript's text which he claimed discounts Egan's attribution.SHAKSPER 2005: Wager In a review of Egan's treatise for the Times Literary Supplement, Bart Van Es also challenged Egan's attribution, arguing that the verbal links he had found were often tenuous. Egan wagered ₤1,000 that he could prove \\"by clear, convincing and irrefutable evidence\\" that Shakespeare wrote the play. In 2011, a panel of three independent Shakespeare scholars concluded that he had not done so, and that the play was not Shakespearean.http://shaksper.net/archive/2011/304-august/28082-thomas-of- woodstock; see, also, \\"Poor Richards,\\" SHK 25.080 Sunday, 16 February 2014 An argument against Shakespeare's authorship is the fact that the character of Sir Henry Green is killed fighting in Act V of Thomas of Woodstock, yet is alive again at the beginning of Richard II until his execution is ordered by Bolingbroke in Act III. There is no instance of a character dying twice in the validated works of Shakespeare. There are, however, inconsistencies in Shakespeare, such as the claim at the end of Henry IV, Part 2 that Falstaff will be seen again in Henry V, a promise which is not kept. Furthermore, the character of Falstaff is arguably a different one in the history plays than the character encountered in The Merry Wives of Windsor, not to mention the apparent setting of that play in Renaissance England rather than Prince Hal's time. Date The 1929 Malone Society editor states that most scholars place its composition between 1591 and 1595.Frijlinck, First Part., p. xxiii Ule and Baker date it more precisely to about 1582; they believe it was written by Christopher Marlowe while he was at Cambridge, shortly after he had completed other plays they attribute to him such as Timon, and The Famous Victories of Henry V.Ule, A Concordance to the Shakespeare Apocrypha, which contains an edition of the play and a discussion of its authorship. Corbin and Sedge, while cautioning that \\"[d]ating by suppositions of literary or theatrical influence is ... a hazardous business,\\" nonetheless state that \\"in so far as literary influence may help dating, it would seem probable that Woodstock was written, and perhaps staged, some time before 1595.\\"Corbin and Sedge, 2002, pp. 4, 8. Egan dates the play to 1592–1593, while dating the manuscript to 1605. MacDonald P. Jackson argues that \\"Woodstock's contractions and linguistic forms, expletives, metrical features and vocabulary all point independently to composition in the first decade of the seventeenth century\\", a conclusion which would make the play's relationship with Richard II that of a \\"prequel\\" rather than a source.Jackson, Macd. P. \\"Shakespeare's Richard II and the Anonymous Thomas of Woodstock\\" in Medieval and Renaissance Drama in England 14 (2001) 17–65. Performances The Hampshire Shakespeare Company, a non-professional theatre in Amherst, Massachusetts, staged the first known American production of \\"Thomas of Woodstock\\" in 1999. Local writer Frederick Carrigg supplied an ending to cover the missing manuscript page(s). Royal Blood: The Rise and Fall of Kings was a 10-play series of Shakespeare's history plays staged chronologically over four seasons by Pacific Repertory Theatre from 2001–04, which included the American professional premieres of both Edward III and \\"Thomas of Woodstock\\". They proposed Shakespeare as the author of both plays in their first arc in 2001, consisting of Edward III, Thomas of Woodstock, and Richard II.Pacific Repertory Theatre website archives The Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, D.C., staged Richard II in 2010 with director Michael Kahn's incorporation of a significant part of \\"Thomas of Woodstock\\" at the start of the play. On 20 December 2013 the Royal Shakespeare Company gave a rehearsed reading of the play at London's Barbican Centre in the context of its ongoing performances of Richard II. The text was significantly cut by the director (for example the subplot involving Nimble and the blank charters was excised) to highlight the relationship between the two plays.

Early career In 1960 Burciaga joined the United States Air Force. After spending a year in Iceland, where he wrote extensively as part of his job, he was sent to Zaragoza, Spain, for three years. There he discovered the work of Spanish poet, Federico García Lorca. After completing his military service, he earned a B.A. in fine arts from the University of Texas at El Paso in 1968 and started work as an illustrator and graphic artist, first in Mineral Wells, Texas (an experience he later recorded in an \\"Hispanic Link\\" column called \\"Mineral Wells—A Near and Distant Memory\\"), and then in Washington, D.C., where he began his participation in the Chicano movement and where he met Cecilia Preciado, whom he married in 1972. Writing career After moving to California in 1974 so Cecilia could work at Stanford University, Burciaga started writing reviews and columns for local journals and newspapers. In 1985 he became a freelance contributor to the syndicated column \\"Hispanic Link\\" and the Pacific News Service. On May 5, 1984, he helped found the Latino comedy troupe, Culture Clash at the Galería de la Raza in San Francisco's Mission District along with Marga Gómez, Monica Palacios, Richard Montoya, Ric Salinas, and Herbert Sigüenza. Tony continued performing with the group until 1988. Tony and Cecilia Burciaga lived near Stanford University, where Cecilia served in various positions, including Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, Associate Provost for Faculty Affairs, and Assistant to the President as Director of the Office of Chicano Affairs. In her post, she became very active in the support and formation of the Chicano community at Stanford, including the creation of El Centro Chicano, a Chicano/Latino student center. Tony Burciaga continued his writing and drawing. In 1985, Tony and Cecilia became Resident Fellows in Casa Zapata, a unique Chicano theme dormitory where approximately half of the residents were Chicano undergraduate students. Tony, Cecilia, and their two children lived in a small apartment attached to the dormitory. The dormitory put on various Chicano and Latino- related educational events and gatherings, and was also well known for its history of mural art. In Casa Zapata, Burciaga contributed to this tradition, and painted several murals with students. His most well-known mural is the critically acclaimed \\"Last Supper of Chicano Heroes\\" in the Casa Zapata dining hall. The students of the dorm filled out a survey about who their heroes were, then Burciaga placed these figures sitting around the table in the traditional image of \\"The Last Supper.\\" Included in this image were people such as César Chávez, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, Ignacio Zaragoza, Che Guevara, Martin Luther King, Jr., and others. It is part of a larger mural entitled \\"The History of Maize.\\" The Burciagas served as Resident Fellows until 1994. As a writer, Burciaga became increasingly successful in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the publication of several books. Weedee Peepo (1988), Drink Cultura (1993), and Spilling the Beans (1995) are all collections of essay exploring social issues with a bilingual blend of wit and wisdom. His 1992 book of poetry, Undocumented Love, won the American Book Award. Through his writings, he regularly spoke at various community-based events for social justice in the San Francisco Bay Area including East Palo Alto, Redwood City, and San Jose. Burciaga was intensely involved in supporting actions for social justice including opposing anti-immigration movements such as California Proposition 187 and other English-only policies. In 1995, while in remission from cancer, Burciaga won the Hispanic Heritage Award for Literature. Burciaga died on October 7, 1996. At the time, he was working on his first novel about a group of friends growing up in El Paso, Texas. In 1997, In Few Words/ En Pocas Palabras: A Compendium of Latino Folk Wit and Wisdom, was published posthumously. Burciaga's success as a muralist, poet, journalist, and humorist was in his versatility and virtuosity with language. He wrote in Spanish, English, and combinations of the two to express social criticism and his deep feelings of alienation. Francisco Lomelí and Donaldo Urioste, in their review (De Colores, 1977) of Restless Serpents (1976), said that his poetry \\"is powered by an incisive sense of irony with the purpose of criticizing set or ignored truths.... His critical approach becomes effective because his attacks avoid demagogic or abstract declarations.\\" Burciaga's appeal as a writer lay in his sense of humor, which he used to satirize the rigidity of a system still clinging to traditions of racism and discrimination. With few exceptions his themes are eminently political and social, echoing the early militant voices of poets like Ricardo Sánchez, Abelardo Barrientos Delgado, and Raymundo \\"Tigre\\" Pérez, although Burciaga was distinctly more sophisticated than the latter two and avoided Sánchez's strident anger and provocative license with language..

The ruling held that though a newspaper held the copyright in the collection and the arrangement of freelance articles and in its newspaper, it could not publish the articles within a database. Publication within the database would remove the articles from the context of the collective work and therefore their publication as such was not within the rights held by the newspaper. Background In 1995, Heather Robertson, a freelance writer, wrote two articles that were published in the print edition of The Globe and Mail. Later, the newspaper placed copies of her articles in three databases, including Info Globe Online, an online database of Globe and Mail articles, as well as the Canadian Periodical Index. The databases did not contain many aspects of the print version of the Globe and Mail. They did not contain the advertisements, some tables, photographs, artwork, photo captions, birth and death notices, financial tables, weather forecasts and some design elements. Heather Robertson objected to the presence of her articles in the databases and sued the Globe and Mail for unauthorized reproduction of her work. The case was granted class action status. Robertson also asserted claims on behalf of salaried writers at the Globe. The issue before the Court was whether the reproduction of Robertson's articles were part of the Globe's copyright in its newspaper or if the reproduction infringes Robertson's copyright in her work. Lower court ruling At trial and on appeal, the courts found in favour of Robertson. It was noted that for the Globe to seek protection under its collective copyright the database must constitute a newspaper or consist of a \\"substantial part thereof in any material form whatever\\". A substantial part of a newspaper exists in the arranging and formatting of articles, much of which is lost when the articles are put on a database. Thus, the courts found that the database was not merely a newspaper in a different guise but a new work. Supreme Court of Canada ruling Four issues were presented to the Supreme Court to decide: On the appeal: # Would a licence from a freelance author specifically granting a publisher the right to republish his or her article in the electronic databases need to be in writing? # Does Robertson have standing to assert a claim on behalf of employees of the Globe? On the cross-appeal: Whether the electronic databases infringed the right of # freelance authors; and # Globe staff writers. The bulk of the opinion was focused on the first of the cross-appeal issues. =Main Issue= The Court first recognized that the author held the copyright in her articles, and the newspaper held the copyright in the compilation or collection of works that contained them. As a result, the issue became whether the electronic databases were a reproduction of the original article, or of the newspaper. The Court then noted that though the newspaper had the right to modify its collection, it did not have the right to decontextualize its articles so much so as to remove the intimate connection to the newspaper.para. 41 The Court agreed with the U.S. Supreme Court who found in Tasini that the databases were not a reproduction of the original collected work. The Court stressed that a primary determinant of their result was the output that the user received when querying the database, not the input that the Globe put into it.para. 48 Indeed, the Court found that the CD-ROM database did not violate the author's copyright as it presented articles related to that day's paper when a user viewed a particular article. Though the layout was different, the Court reasoned that the essence of the collection remained.para. 52 Overall, the Court ruled that Robertson's rights had been violated by the addition of her works into two of the three databases. =Secondary Issues= After determining that Robertson could claim copyright infringement for the inclusion of her articles in two of the databases, the court then turned to the secondary issues, and ruled that: # Only an exclusive license needed to be in writing. A grant of a non-exclusive license does not need to be in writing to be enforceable.para. 56 # Employees of The Globe and Mail should not have been certified as members of the class. The employees retained no rights in the works when the works were produced in accordance with their employment agreements.para. 62 # Given the previous finding that two of the databases did not substantially reproduce the newspapers as they were in the print edition, it was found that the databases were not \\"newspapers, magazines or similar periodicals for purposes of s. 13(3)\\" of the Copyright Act.para. 63 The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed Robertson's appeal and allowed the cross appeal on the issue of CD-ROMs. Dissent Abella, J. dissented in part, on the issue of whether or not the databases were substantially the same as the print version of the Globe and Mail. In her opinion, inclusion of the articles in the databases was a valid exercise of the rights granted to the newspaper publisher by the author. See also * New York Times Co. v.

The game uses a selection of 21 cards out of a standard deck. These are shuffled and the player selects one at random. The cards are then dealt out face up in three columns of 7 cards each. The player points to the column containing their card. The cards are picked up and the process is repeated three times, at which point the magician reveals the selected card. Variations Minor aspects of the presentation are adjustable, for example the cards can be dealt either face-up or face-down. If they are dealt face-down then the spectator must look through each of the piles until finding which one contains the selected card, whereas if they are dealt face-up then an attentive spectator can immediately answer the question of which pile contains the selected card. Some performers deal the cards into face-up rows or columns instead of piles, which saves more time as all cards are partly visible. When the same method is applied to three piles of nine cards each, it is called the 27 card trick. It is identical in principle. Method The magician begins by handing the spectator the 21-card packet and asking them to look through it and select any one card to remember. The cards are then dealt into three piles one at a time, like when dealing out hands in a card game. Each time they are dealt out, after the spectator indicates which pile contains the thought of card, the magician places that pile between the other two. After the first time, the card will be one of the ones in position 8-14. When the cards are dealt out the second time, the selection will be the third, fourth, or fifth card in the pile it ends up in. In picking up the piles, the magician places this pile between the other two again. This ensures that the selection will now be one of the ones in position 10-12. The third time the cards are dealt out, the selection will be the fourth card in which ever pile it ends up in. On the third deal, as soon as the spectator indicates which pile contains the selection, the magician knows that it is the fourth, or middle, card in that pile. If the magician gathers up the piles again, as before with the pile containing the selection in the middle, the selection will be the eleventh card in the 21 card packet. If 27 cards are used, the procedure is the same but the selection will be the fourteenth card in the packet.

Towns which include a city within, but not coextensive with, the town, are shown as towns. *In Massachusetts, only those municipalities which title themselves as cities are shown as cities. Those municipalities which are considered to be legal cities by the Massachusetts Secretary of State's office but which title themselves as towns are shown as towns. *If a county includes any unincorporated territory, this is noted following the list of municipalities in the county. Trivia The only municipality name that is found in all six New England states is Warren. The Warren in Rhode Island is the largest of the six. There are several municipality names that can be found in five of the six New England states. These include Andover, Bridgewater, Bristol, Chester, Franklin, Lincoln, Plymouth, Richmond, Salisbury, Sharon, Washington and Windsor. Manchester also exists in five states if the Manchester-by-the-Sea in Massachusetts is counted (prior to the early 1990s, the Massachusetts community used to be just \\"Manchester\\", like the others). In most of the above cases, the missing state is Rhode Island, although in a few it is Connecticut (Lincoln, Richmond) or Massachusetts (Bristol), although there is a Bristol County in Massachusetts. There are at least three other place names that existed as municipality names in five of the six states in the 19th century, but lost this status due to one of more of the communities disincorporating or being annexed.

Synonymy The name Tano is a Spanish borrowing of an older Hopi-Tewa autonym tʰáánu tééwa. Tano is often encountered in the anthropological literature referring to the ancestors of the Arizona Tewa before they relocated to Hopi territory. The name Hano, similarly, is a borrowing of tʰáánu into Hopi as hááno, háánòwɨ, which was then Anglicized. Hano in English also refers to Tewa Village, one of the main Arizona Tewa settlements. Other historical names include Tamos, Tamones, Atmues, Tanos, Thanos, Tagnos, Janos. Tewa is the preferred autonym (over Hano, Tano, and Hopi-Tewa) because the Tewa language refers to its people as \\"Tewas.\\" History The Hopi-Tewa are related to the Tewa communities living in the Rio Grande Valley, such as Santa Clara Pueblo and Ohkay Owingeh. The long contact with Hopi peoples has led to similarities in social structure with their kinship system and their organization to clans being almost identical with the Hopi (the other Tanoan Pueblo groups do not have clans). However, the Tewa dual moiety has been preserved. Language Many Hopi-Tewa are trilingual in Tewa, Hopi, and English. Some speakers also speak Spanish and/or Navajo. Hopi-Tewa is a variety of the Tewa language of Tanoan family and has been influenced by Hopi (which is an unrelated Uto-Aztecan language). Arizona Tewa and the forms of Rio Grande Tewa in New Mexico are mutually intelligible with difficulty. What is remarkable about this speech community is that the influence of the Hopi language on Hopi-Tewa is extremely small in terms of vocabulary. Arizona Tewa speakers, although they are trilingual, maintain a strict separation of the languages (see also Code-switching: Example). These attitudes of linguistic purism may be compared with other Tewa speech communities in New Mexico where there has been very little borrowing from Spanish even though the Tewa and Spanish have had long periods of contact and the Tewa were also bilingual in Tewa and Spanish. Traditionally, the Hopi- Tewa were translators for Hopi leaders and thus also had command of Spanish and Navajo. This contrasts with the Hopi who generally can not speak Tewa (although they may have limited proficiency in Navajo).

Bleuette has a fully jointed composition body. She was 27 cm (10\\" 5/8) tall until 1933, then 29 cm (11\\" 3/8) until production ended in 1960. She had a bisque head until World War II, then a composition head until 1958 when a hard plastic body and head were used for the last two years of production. The magazine came out weekly and included patterns for the doll. More than 1,060 patterns were published over the 55 years Bleuette was available. The first Bleuette dolls are known as \\"Premiere Bleuette\\", and were given free to those who had placed an order for a year's subscription to La Semaine de Suzette before its first publication in February 1905, and were available only until one month after the first issue. 20,000 Jumeau dolls were ordered from the Société Française de Fabrication de Bébés et Jouets (SFBJ) for the initial advertisement, but 60,000 subscriptions were received, and this first supply of dolls were gone before the first issue was even released. Over the years the doll was given a younger sister, Benjamine, in 1926, which was on the market only a short time, then a baby brother, Bambino, in 1928. An older sister, Rosette, was her companion in her last years between 1955 and 1960. The doll is popular with modern doll collectors for its size and the vast assortment of patterns available spanning 55 years of fashion trends. During the first world war, there were Red Cross nurses outfits, Tipperary outfits, aviator outfits, automotive outfits, skating and ski outfits. Many designers over the years contributed to the design of the Bleuette doll's wardrobe. Jeanne Lanvin was especially noted as a contributor. Well-known artists drew the illustrations for the catalogues, and they are collected today. Noted are Manon Iessel and Maggie Salcedo. Joseph Pinchon drew the comical Bécassine which was turned into a companion doll for Bleuette. La Semaine de Suzette also included patterns for an assortment of furniture that could be made from cardboard. Furniture was available for the doll through the offices of the publisher. Also available at the offices were a repair shop for broken dolls as well as new heads and wigs. The publishers of La Semaine de Suzette were devout Catholics and wished to find a way to get the Christian message into French homes. The home arts which young girls learned were intended to teach them to be good mothers and good Christian French wives. There were patterns for bridal dresses and Christening gowns in the magazine, and a Holy Communion dress available through the publishing offices and catalogues.

It is known from a partial skeleton (UA 8656) found by Catherine Forster and colleagues in Maevarano Formation rocks at a quarry near Berivotra, Mahajanga Province.Tudge, Colin (2009) The Bird:A Natural History of Who Birds Are, Where They Came From, and How They Live Rahonavis was a small predator, at about long and 0.45-2.27 kg (1-5 lbs),Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2008) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages Supplementary Information with the typical Velociraptor-like raised sickle claw on the second toe. The name Rahonavis means, approximately, \\"cloud menace bird\\", from Malagasy ' (RA-hoo-na, \\"cloud\\" or \\"menace\\") + Latin ' \\"bird\\". The specific name, R. ostromi, was coined in honor of John Ostrom. Classification Skeletal restoration Rahonavis has historically been the subject of some uncertainty as to its proper taxonomic position – whether it is a member of the clade Avialae (birds) or a closely related dromaeosaurid. The presence of quill knobs on its ulna (forearm bone) led initially to its inclusion as an avialan; however, the rest of the skeleton is rather typically dromaeosaurid in its attributes. Given the extremely close affinities between primitive birds and their dromaeosaurid cousins, along with the possibility that flight may have developed and been lost multiple times among these groups, it has been difficult to place Rahonavis firmly among or outside the birds. Rahonavis could be a close relative to Archaeopteryx, as originally suggested by the describers, and thus a member of the clade Avialae, but while the pelvis shows adaptations to flight similar in function to those of Archaeopteryx, they seem to be independently derived. Rahonavis was probably also a close relative of Overoraptor. Beginning in the early 2000s, a consensus emerged among most theropod researchers that Rahonavis was more closely related to deinonychosaurs than to avialans, and specifically was a member of the South American dromaeosaurid clade Unenlagiinae. A 2005 analysis by Makovicky and colleagues found Rahonavis to be closely related to the unenlagiines Unenlagia and Buitreraptor. Supplementary information. Norell and colleagues (2006) also found Rahonavis to lie within the Unenlagiinae, as the sister taxon to Unenlagia itself. A 2007 study by Turner and colleagues again found it to be an unenlagiine dromaeosaurid, closely related to Unenlagia. This consensus has been challenged, however, by a few studies published since 2009 that have found many traditional \\"dromaeosaurids\\", including the unenlagiines, closer to Avialae than to dromaeosaurines. A large analysis published by Agnolín and Novas (2013) recovered Rahonavis as closer to Avialae than to Dromaeosauridae. A cladistic analysis by Cau (2018) recovered Rahonavis as a probable relative of the long-tailed Early Cretaceous avialans Jeholornis and Jixiangornis.Andrea Cau (2018). \\"The assembly of the avian body plan: a 160-million-year long process\\" (PDF). Bollettino della Società Paleontologica Italiana. 57 (1): 1–25. doi:10.4435/BSPI.2018.01. The analysis of Hartman et al. (2019) \\"strongly rejected\\" the supposed avialan position of Rahonavis, finding its placement in Unenlagiinae better supported as it takes 10 less steps. The discoverers of Rahonavis initially named it Rahona but changed the name after discovering that the name Rahona was already assigned to a genus of lymantriid moths. Discovery and species The fossilized remains of Rahonavis were first recovered from the Maevarano Formation in Madagascar in 1995 by a joint expedition of SUNY and the University of Antananarivo, near the village of Berivotra. Most geological formations in this area are covered in dense grass, making identification of fossils difficult. However, when a portion of hillside was exposed by fire, the remains of a giant titanosaur were revealed. It was during the excavation of this find that paleontologists discovered the bones of Rahonavis among the bones of the much larger dinosaur. Rahonavis is known from this single specimen, consisting of the hind limbs, trunk, portions of the tail (all of which were found articulated), as well as portions of the wing and shoulder bones. Rahonavis was one-fifth larger than the closely related Archaeopteryx, about the size of a modern raven. The lack of well-documented relatives of this species nonwithstanding, a single thoracic vertebra (NMC 50852) most similar to those of R. ostromi was found in the Albian to Cenomanian Kem Kem Beds Lagerstätte in Morocco. Lacking the pleurocoels found in Rahonavis and having a larger neural canal, it appears to belong to a different genus. Although former character can vary in species of the same genus, in individual vertebrae of the same animal, and ontogenetically, the distance in space and time suggests that whatever this specimen may be, it does not belong into Rahonavis. Paleobiology Restoration Although numerous artists' reconstructions of Rahonavis show it in flight, it is not clear that it could fly; there has even been some doubt that the forearm material, which includes the quill knobs, belongs with the rest of the skeleton. Some researchers have suggested that Rahonavis represents a chimera consisting of the forelimb of a bird conflated with the skeleton of a dromaeosaurid, and consider Rahona as described a nomen dubium. The nearby discovery of the primitive bird Vorona berivotrensis at least shows that the possibility of a mix-up cannot be fully excluded. However, many other scientists, including the original describers of Rahonavis, maintain that its remains belong to a single animal, citing the close proximity of the wing bones to the rest of the skeleton. All the bones attributed to Rahonavis were buried in an area \\"smaller than a letter-sized page\\", according to co-describer Luis M. Chiappe in his 2007 book Glorified Dinosaurs. Additionally, Chiappe argued that suggestions of a chimera by paleornithologist Larry Martin were based on Martin's misinterpretation of the wing and shoulder bones as being more advanced than they really are. Chiappe maintained that Rahonavis could probably fly, noting that its ulna was large and robust compared to Archaeopteryx, and that this fact, coupled with the prominent quill knobs, suggest that Rahonavis had larger and more powerful wings than that earlier bird. Additionally, Rahonavis shoulder bones show evidence of ligament attachments allowing the independent mobility needed for flapping flight. Chiappe concluded that Rahonavis was capable of flight, though it would have been more \\"clumsy in the air than modern birds.\\" Agnolín and Novas (2013) noted that, like Microraptor, a bat-like flightstroke using the deltoideus complexes seems to have been likely in R. ostromi.

Life and career  André Turp took private voice lessons with Édouard Woolley and Frank H. Rowe, before entering the Montreal Music Conservatory, where he was a pupil of Ruzena Herlinger. He was then awarded a grant and went to Italy to study with Hélène Vita. He made his stage debut in 1950 in operettas with the \\"Variétés Lyriques\\", in Montreal. He also took part in several programs with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. A biographical note from Covent Garden·on his first appearance there revealed that he had appeared in twenty-one Offenbach operettas.Andrew Porter. Opera Diary – BBC Television: Hands Across the Sky (February 7). Opera, April 1960, p298. His true operatic debut took place in 1956, at New Orleans, where he sang Roméo in Roméo et Juliette, Rodolfo in La Bohème, and Cavaradossi in Tosca. He then appeared with the Opera Guild of Montreal, in the late 1950s, as Macduff in Macbeth, and Fenton in Falstaff. His major breakthrough came in London, at the Royal Opera House, where he made his debut on February 5, 1960, as Edgardo in Lucia di Lammermoor, opposite Joan Sutherland. He was to appear with that company for several seasons in numerous roles including the Duke of Mantua, Alfredo, Turiddu, Rodolfo, Cavaradossi, etc. He was invited to the Glyndebourne Festival in 1961, where he sang in Henze's Elegy for Young Lovers. At about the same time, he began a long association with the Opéra- Comique and the Palais Garnier, adding to his repertoire roles such as Werther (a role he sang with great success an estimated 500 times in Europe), Faust, Don Jose in Carmen, Hoffmann in Les contes d'Hoffmann, etc. He also appeared in Switzerland, Spain and Portugal. In the 1970s, for the BBC he participated in performances of the original versions of Verdi's Simon Boccanegra and Don Carlos, which have been recently released by Opera Rara. Turp retired from the stage in 1983. He taught at the Montreal Music Conservatory from 1979 until 1989, and served on juries for international competitions in Toulouse and Verviers.

Early issues of the comic focused on the Peach's command of a misfit unit of the Afrika Korps from 1940 to 1943; subsequent issues have explored the pre- and post-war lives of Pfirsich (German for \\"Peach\\") and his supporting cast. Publication history The Desert Peach was first published in 1988, by Thoughts and Images, later by MU Press/AEON, and still later by A Fine Line. 32 issues were released throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, and subsequently re-released in eight collected volumes; as well, a Desert Peach musical was produced in 1992, and Bread and Swans, a Desert Peach novel, was released in 2005. With the exception of the musical, all Desert Peach material has been created entirely by Barr. Barr took Peach to the Modern Tales webcomics collective, where she explored Pfirsich's afterlife: wracked with guilt for having failed to save enough people from the Holocaust, he sentenced himself to Hell. The website ceased operations in 2012 and the comics were removed. Inspiration Barr has said that she was inspired to create the character while working in the file office of the University of Washington, which was being painted a \\"horrible half- pink, half-tan color.\\" Searching for a color name, she stumbled upon \\"desert peach\\", and was immediately inspired by the pun upon \\"The Desert Fox,\\" the name given to Field Marshal Erwin Rommel during World War II . According to his biographers, Erwin Rommel had a youngest brother, named Manfred, who died in infancy--Barr said she only developed a personality who the universe had prematurely discarded. Supporting cast The Desert Peach commanded the 469th Halftrack, Gravedigging and Support Unit of the Afrika Korps: a catch- all for misfits, mavericks, and otherwise peculiar soldiers who, for whatever reason, were not suitable for service in the German Army but nonetheless were enlisted. In the words of their medical officer (a psychiatrist assigned to the 469th because his specialty was considered a \\"Jewish science\\"), it was a unit composed \\"entirely of stray puppies\\". The 469th was based on an escarpment by the sea. Pfirsich was of the opinion that a commander should not merely lead his troops but protect them, and arranged with local Allied commanders that there would be no fighting in that area (although newcomers did not always accept this modus vivendi). Throughout the series, Barr focused on many characters; the following list includes some of the most prominent. *Obergefreiter Udo Schmidt: Pfirsich's orderly and aide-de-camp. Scruffy, dirty, ill-tempered, dark-skinned, secretly Jewish, and with a habit of using pages from Mein Kampf as rolling papers, Schmidt was the 469th's only card- carrying member of the Nazi Party. He claimed that his reason for joining was that he had been very young and a desperate Party recruiter had bought him beer. *Leutnant Kjars Dagobert Winzig: the 469th's self-appointed political officer. A concert pianist in civilian life, the blond, blue-eyed Winzig was an enthusiastic, armband-wearing supporter of Hitler and Nazism. However, he was not actually a party member, since (as he shamefacedly explained) \\"party members have to pay dues\\". *Oberleutnant Rosen Kavalier: ace Luftwaffe pilot, and the Peach's fiancé. A cheerful adventurer, bold and brash, Rosen (whose real name, thanks to his British father, was Melvin Gonville Ramsbottom) once got Pfirsich drunk enough to have heterosexual sex for the first time, claiming that he should experience it at least once. This encounter led to the birth of Pfirsich's son. *Obergefreiter Heinrich Dobermann: munitions expert. As the result of a training accident on a minefield, Dobermann was brain- damaged, mildly insane, and addicted to several painkillers and psychotropic medications. As well, he adopted a live Tellermine 42 as a pet, naming it \\"Fridl\\". * Kristof Falbe: the 469's mute radio operator. Never speaks, just taps the radio microphone to communicate.

History Originally, the land where Chingle Hall now stands was owned by Ughtred de Singleton from around 1066. In 1260 Adam de Singleton built a small manor house known as Singleton Hall. It was surrounded by a moat and the studded oak front door was accessed via a small wooden drawbridge, which was replaced in the 16th century by a brick- built bridge. The door and bridge have survived to this day, although some of the moat has now dried up. The hall, renamed Chingle Hall, remained in the possession of the Singleton family until Eleanor Singleton, the last of the line, died in 1585. The house then passed to the Wall family through the marriage of William Wall with Anne Singleton. Their son Anthony Wall, once mayor of Preston, died there in 1601. In 1680 the house was extended westwards. The Walls owned the hall until the mid-18th century when the house passed to a local branch of the Singleton family. From 1794 the house was owned by the Farrington family for some hundred years before being bought by the Longton family. In 1945, the house was rented by the Howarths before they bought the property in 1960. After Mr Howarth died the house stood empty and was badly vandalised, until Sandra and John Coppleston-Bruce bought the house in 1986 and restored it. The property was then bought by the Kirkhams in February 1995. The current owner is an eminent professional person and local historian who has carried out detailed research into the history of Chingle Hall and the families who have lived there since its construction. The house and gardens are private property and are not open to the public.  Saint John Wall  Some have made the claim that Saint John Wall was born in the Hall in 1620. It is unlikely that he was a member of the Preston Wall family. He became a Roman Catholic priest in 1641. Some have claimed that Chingle Hall was used as a place of worship by Catholics during the time of the Catholic Reformation when it was illegal to practice mass in Britain. In 1678 John Wall was apprehended at Rushock Court near Bromsgrove. He was taken to Worcester jail, where he was offered his life if he would forsake his religion. He declined. Brought back from Worcester, he was drawn and quartered at Redhill on 22 August 1679. His quartered body was given to his friends, and was buried in St. Oswald's churchyard. A Mr. Levison, however, allegedly acquired the martyr's head, and it was treasured by the friars at Worcester until the dissolution of that house during the French Revolution. The Franciscan nuns at Taunton claim to possess a tooth and a bone of the martyr. He was canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970.

The Ontario High Court of Justice affirmed the artist's right to integrity of their work. The operator of the Toronto Eaton Centre was found liable for violating Michael Snow's moral rights by putting Christmas bows on his work Flight Stop. Background Michael Snow was commissioned to do a sculpture called Flight Stop consisting of a number of Canada geese in flight in the atrium of the Toronto Eaton Centre. During the Christmas season of 1981 the Eaton Centre placed red ribbons around the necks of the geese. Snow brought an action against the Centre to get an injunction to have the ribbons removed. He had argued that the ribbons offended the integrity of, and distorted, his work. Judgment The judge agreed with Snow. He held that the sculpture's integrity was \\"distorted, mutilated or otherwise modified\\" which was \\"to the prejudice of the honour or reputation of the author\\" contrary to section 28.2 of the Copyright Act. The opinion was based both on the opinion of Snow as well as the testimony of experts in the art community.

It is native to the waters of the Western Pacific, from the Japan to Indonesia.Froese, R. and D. Pauly, Editors. Amphiprion frenatus. FishBase. 2015. Other common names include blackback anemonefish, bridled anemonefish, fire clown, and red tomato clown.Common names of Amphiprion frenatus. FishBase. 2015.  Characteristics of anemonefish  Clownfish or anemonefish are fishes that, in the wild, form symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones and are unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone, see . The sea anemone protects the clownfish from predators, as well as providing food through the scraps left from the anemone's meals and occasional dead anemone tentacles. In return, the clownfish defends the anemone from its predators, and parasites. Clownfish are small-sized, , and depending on species, they are overall yellow, orange, or a reddish or blackish color, and many show white bars or patches. Within species there may be color variations, most commonly according to distribution, but also based on sex, age and host anemone. Clownfish are found in warmer waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans and the Red Sea in sheltered reefs or in shallow lagoons. In a group of clownfish, there is a strict dominance hierarchy. The largest and most aggressive fish is female and is found at the top. Only two clownfish, a male and a female, in a group reproduce through external fertilization. Clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites, meaning that they develop into males first, and when they mature, they become females. Description A male lacking black sidesThe adult fish is bright orange-red, with a white head bar or vertical stripe just behind the eyes, joined over the head and with a distinctive black outline. Females are mainly blackish on the sides. Males are considerably smaller and are red overall. Juveniles are a darker red, with two or three white bars. They have 9-10 dorsal spines, 2 anal spines, 16-18 dorsal soft rays and 13-15 anal soft rays. They reach a maximum length of . =Color variations= The only color variation is sex related with females having darker coloration or dark spots on their sides. =Similar species= The Australian clownfish (A. rubrocinctus) has a similar coloration, however the female does not have the distinctive black outline of the white band, the band is poorly developed and may be discontinuous on top of the head. Geographic location is the easiest way to distinguish small juveniles as they are otherwise difficult to distinguish. The cinnamon clownfish (A. melanopus) is also similar, but has a broader white headbar and outside Melanesia it has black pelvic and anal fins. Image:HamaKN.jpgA. frenatus (Tomato anemonefish) Image:Amphiprion rubrocinctus RLS.jpgA. rubrocinctus (Australian anemonefish) Image:Amphiprion melanopus RLS.jpgA. melanopus (Red & Black anemonefish) Distribution and habitat This species is found as far north as Ryukyu Islands, Japan, to the South China Sea and surrounding areas including Malaysia and Indonesia. Some authors report that this species is associated with a single species of anemone, the bubble-tip anemone (Entacmaea quadricolor). Other authorities report that it may be associated with the sebae anemone (Heteractis crispa), as well. In aquaria As a pet, many marine hobbyists agree that at least of tank volume is necessary for the fish, however others believe larger is necessary for this fish to have ample room for maneuvering. Many hobbyists use a quarantine tank prior to introduction into the main tank as it helps to rid the tomato clownfish of saltwater-borne diseases. This species of fish thrives well even without a host anemone. In the absence of a host, it may \\"adopt\\" corals of a tank to reside. It will eat most meat or vegetable food preparations, including dried algae, mysis shrimp, and brine shrimp. The tomato clownfish has been reported to be aggressive and territorial when mature, and specimens have been known to be extremely aggressive even towards clownfishes of other species. For this reason, it is best kept singly or in mated pairs. It can be bred in captivity, and the fry can be fed on baby brine shrimp and rotifers.

He worked in several markets but is best known for his long stint in the Tampa Bay area. Career =Early career= Lassiter was born Robert Henry Glodowski in Camden, New Jersey and raised in Collingswood, New Jersey, where he lived until dropping out of high school in the middle of his junior year and running away to New York City. He then wandered the United States doing odd jobs until arriving in 1970 on St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. A sales representative from a beautiful music radio station heard Lassiter's voice in a bar in Charlotte Amalie in the Virgin Islands one afternoon and immediately suggested he apply for an on-air job. Lassiter was soon hired as a music disc jockey at the salesman's station, WESP-FM, signing on September 1, 1970 under the air name of \\"Ron Scott.\\" He would move from there to beautiful music and progressive rock stations all over the country: WOUR-FM in Utica, New York; WOWI-FM in Norfolk, Virginia; WEZS-FM in Richmond, Virginia; and WJOI-FM in Pittsburgh. After his first marriage in 1972, he legally changed his name to Lassiter. In 1981, Lassiter was working as a country music DJ at WKQS-FM 99.9 in Miami under the name Bobby Clifford when he heard talk-radio giant Neil Rogers on WINZ (940 AM). Rogers became Lassiter's mentor and idol, whom he followed into talk radio by taking a late- night weekend slot at Miami's WGBS-AM (710) in 1984. (Lassiter apparently intended to continue as Bobby Clifford on WGBS, but in preparing for his debut the station prepared promos and announcements using the name \\"Lassiter\\" without asking; Lassiter was forced to use his real name on the air.) Rogers heard Lassiter on WGBS and liked what he did, urging his own station—in a relentless, on-air campaign—to hire the newcomer. WINZ did hire Lassiter as a weekend host, but fired him in December 1985 when he uttered a profanity on the air. =Tampa: WPLP (1985-87) and WFLA (1987-89)= In September 1985, Tampa Bay's first all-talk station, WPLP-AM, lured Lassiter to Tampa with his first (low-paid) full-time position on weeknights. (At the time he was still working weekends on WINZ and doing fill-ins at WPLP; the station intended to move Neil Rogers from nighttime to day and, until Lassiter was fired, was grooming him as Rogers' replacement.) He took over WPLP's afternoon drive time slot on September 23, 1985. Lassiter recalled on the air that the station initially offered him $12,000 per year, which he turned down, eventually accepting a comeback offer of $18,000 when Rogers suggested he take the job as training for doing talk radio every day. (He later admitted faking his resume to get hired at WPLP, claiming to be a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania.) Although Lassiter's Miami career was not to be, he soon took Tampa by storm with his confrontational and deliberately offensive style, quickly rising to the top-rated talk program in the market by an enormous margin. He was, in fact, the second-highest-rated radio show in the market, bested only by Cleveland Wheeler and Scott Shannon's Q-ZOO on WRBQ-FM. Lassiter redefined AM talk radio in Tampa Bay, asserting himself as an on-air bully who targeted Christians, conservatives, the elderly, and virtually everybody else. As he himself would one day describe: Instead of a market for the retirees who formed much of the area's population, Lassiter made talk radio a young listener's medium: kids and young Baby Boomers would listen to hear Lassiter torment the old people. In the process, they would join in on the conversation and find themselves lambasted as well. Lassiter's ratings and reputation were such that the biggest AM radio station in the market, WFLA, hired him away from WPLP for substantially more money in mid-1987. At FLA Lassiter joined the ranks of the golden age of Tampa talk radio, with such personalities as Dick Norman, Tedd Webb, and Liz Richards, and maintained his ratings supremacy to that local competition. Indeed, while Lassiter had pulled upwards of 7% shares at WPLP -- which by itself made him the number one talk show in Tampa Bay -- at WFLA he rose to 8 and 9 shares, at a time when the entire talk-radio audience in Tampa Bay was roughly a 10 share of the market. =Chicago (1989-91)= By 1989 Lassiter had become something of a sensation in the broadcast industry, appearing on national television and creating a demand for his talents in the largest markets in the U.S. WABC (AM) in New York made an offer in 1988, but WFLA would not let him out of his contract. (The slot at WABC eventually went to Rush Limbaugh instead.) Ultimately he was won over by WLS (AM), the Capital Cities/ABC radio hub in Chicago, who offered him a five-year, $1.05 million contract for the afternoon drive timeslot. Lassiter's tenure at WLS was uneasy from the start: the CapCities executives behind the station micromanaged to an extreme degree, and were anxious to cultivate a friendly, inoffensive image, which ran completely counter to the type of radio that Lassiter did best. Members of management were waiting outside the studio on Lassiter's first night at WLS (23 August 1989) to give him a laundry list of things he had done that they did not want on their airwaves. Lassiter felt that since CapCities executives knew of his work before they even asked for a job interview, they knew perfectly well what kind of on-air personality they were getting. Lassiter deeply resented their sudden desire to rein him in. Rather than change the style that had attracted WLS to him in the first place, Lassiter asked to be let out of the contract. The station refused, touching off what Lassiter called \\"open warfare\\" between WLS executives and their new employee. Their attempts to censor him only intensified his efforts to insult and infuriate his audience (and employers) on-air, and led Lassiter to walk out in the middle of staff meetings off-air. One journalist wrote that By late 1991, both parties were exasperated; unimpressive Arbitron ratings did not ease tensions. Lassiter's five-year contract had an escape clause that gave WLS the option to terminate it at the end of 1991, and Lassiter was openly predicting that the station would do exactly that. In fact, they didn't even wait for the end of the year, removing Lassiter from the air following his afternoon broadcast on September 20. Although he would remember his time in Chicago as \\"a two-and-a-half-year nightmare\\", the job did raise Lassiter's profile significantly; in 1990, he appeared on CNN's Crossfire as a representative of left-wing political talk radio. In December 2005, Lassiter would later point out that - more than fourteen years after he was thrown off the air - he was still on the FAQ page on the WLS website. Indeed, as of August 2007, Question 7 on that page is \\"Why don't you bring back Bob Lassiter/Larry Lujack/etc.?\\" . \\"Maybe you don't know much about Lujack, but to be mentioned in the same sentence with him and WLS is more than an honor\\", Lassiter said. \\"It is and always will be the highlight of my career.\\"http://blog.bloglassiter.com/?p=103 =Return to Tampa= WSUN (1993-95) Lassiter then moved to Davenport, Iowa with the intention of retiring from the radio business. After a year and a half, however, Tampa came calling again; the venerable WSUN was experimenting with a non-topical talk-radio format and offered him a hefty sum for its morning- drive slot. Lassiter accepted the job and moved back to Tampa, returning to the air on February 1, 1993. The morning time slot saw Lassiter's combative persona reach a peak, as he began an increasingly hostile feud with his old mentor Neil Rogers. Neil would constantly deride him about his weight, calling him \\"Blob\\". Though it started out as a put down, the fans of Lassiter in Tampa area began to use it as a term of endearment. However, he was not a ratings success, and in January 1994 he moved to the mid-afternoon; Sharon Taylor, the newscaster for his morning show, became his on-air sidekick. While his numbers vastly improved, the circumstances forced him to change his approach drastically; in his final month (November 1995), Lassiter famously teased Taylor about her Thanksgiving turkey. Despite his adaptations and his ratings (he regularly routed WFLA in his afternoon day part), Lassiter recognized that the station was failing and, as he had at WLS, began publicly predicting that his contract option would not be renewed. Again he was correct; WSUN's parent company Cox Broadcasting fired him before his scheduled showtime on November 27, 1995. Although Lassiter would later recall that no employer had ever treated him better or been more fun to work for, the end of his relationship with WSUN was very bitter: Cox refused to release him from his non-compete agreement (despite the fact that WSUN was changing formats and thus Lassiter would not be competition). WFLA (1996-99) Once the non-compete expired in April 1996, Lassiter returned to WFLA's night shift and reclaimed his classic persona, as well as his Arbitron ratings throne. By that time, however, the business had changed dramatically. Rush Limbaugh had transformed the AM band; Lassiter referred to his style as \\"Support Group Radio\\" -- he found that listeners had become used to having their beliefs echoed and reinforced by the radio host, not challenged—and not particularly primed to call the show. In addition, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 had deregulated station ownership, leading the industry to trend towards national syndication and away from local personalities. The contrarian and often left-leaning Lassiter increasingly found himself an anachronism, even as he garnered tremendous market shares of listeners who both loved and loathed him. He rolled with the punches as best he could, provoking his audience more furiously than ever and taking on-air potshots at WFLA's own conservative host, Mark Larsen, but it often seemed that his real nemesis was the very industry he was part of, commercial radio. In 1999 WFLA, which had been owned by Jacor, was purchased along with all of Jacor's holdings by Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia). At the time Clear Channel was building its radio empire and employing a variety of cost-cutting techniques, such as relying heavily on centralized, syndicated programming and eliminating local personalities and technicians from its payroll. Lassiter, disgusted by the changes Clear Channel was making and knowing that his time in radio was not long, began expressing open hostility to their policies on the air; at one point he was even reading employee questionnaires circulated inside the offices, and describing the deeply caustic answers he was filling in. Finally on December 1, 1999, four weeks before his contract was set to expire, Lassiter opened his broadcast with a monologue aimed directly at WFLA's business office: Predictably, he was told the next day that he need not bother to return to work at WFLA that day or any other. \\"Most men would have been devastated upon losing a six-figure, cushy job,\\" Lassiter said later. \\"I was relieved.\\" He officially retired from radio. His slot was filled by future radio star Glenn Beck. Retirement/Death Shortly after his retirement, Lassiter experienced a serious downward slide in his health. A lifelong and unrepentant smoker, he had long ignored the advice of his physicians, and after he was diagnosed with diabetes in about 1990 he had ignored the problem until the disease had advanced considerably. Between 2000 and his death, he would lose 40 percent of his foot, receive treatment for bladder cancer, experience slow decline in kidney function, and slowly lose his eyesight. During his retirement, Lassiter devoted himself to his longtime interest in futures trading, and in 2002 he started a public journal of his trades on Elite Trader, a popular web site for financial traders. He posted on ET under the username \\"Tampa\\" and his journal titled \\"Short Skirt Trades\\" would go on to become one of the most popular journals on the site. The journal retained Lassiter's wit, wordplay, and love of playing with his audience. Between 2004 and early 2005, Lassiter also maintained a trading blog (now deleted) under the alias of \\"The Big Cheese\\" (a nickname he'd been given as station manager in Utica). By 2005, Lassiter was largely confined to his home in the Tampa Bay area. However, his spirits remained good, and in the summer of 2005 he began a new blog--under his own name--whose readership steadily increased. In his writings, Lassiter revisited many memories, but mostly depicted a life in which he was isolated and reclusive, his computer being his only real window on the outside world. On February 14, 2006 -- his 19th wedding anniversary—Lassiter revealed on his blog that he had been told that his kidneys were failing. His doctors, whom he had seen that day, had given him a prognosis of six months to two years. He lived eight months afterward, dying on October 13, 2006, 13 days after his 61st birthday. His death was revealed in a final post in his blog] by his wife, Mary Lassiter: Style Although frequently funny and thought- provoking, Lassiter was always caustic, always contrarian, and often downright mean. He typically began his show with a topical monologue that could last anywhere from five minutes to an hour to a full three-hour shift; the monologue was usually designed to incite his listeners to the point of blind rage, at which point he would begin to accept calls from people who were furious to the point of inarticulacy. As he once put it, \\"It dawned on me that if I talked for an hour, hour and a half, by the time I stopped these people weren't rational. And then I would just rip them to shreds.\\" In fact, Lassiter showed extreme disdain and impatience with his callers, not hesitating to poke fun at them, subtly trap them into demonstrating their hypocrisy or lies, or even to insult them outright. \\"Get off my phone, you subhuman pig!\\" became one of his most famous catchphrases. Lassiter famously began each hour of his show by giving the day of the week, date, and time (e.g., \\"Six minutes after the hour of eight o'clock; welcome back, funseekers. It's a Thursday night, September the twelfth, nineteen hundred and ninety six.\\") He also cultivated a number of signature sign-offs over the years. At WPLP he ended each show by saying \\"Behave yourselves\\", and playing \\"Take It To the Limit\\" by The Eagles; at WLS, he signed off with, \\"Love you, Chicago\\"; in his final years at WFLA he closed by playing an extended version of The Blues Brothers' \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" as he continued speaking or answering phones, then finally playing a tape of a caller saying \\"That's it?...We're done?...well, have a good night then.\\" =Callers= Lassiter had no use for callers who agreed with him, often rushing them off the line so he could find someone with whom he could have a compelling fight. In fact, after his monologue and topic setup he would often tell people who agreed with him not to call, that he was only interested in opposing viewpoints that day; if he received callers who agreed with him anyway, he would immediately hang up on them. Lassiter was willing to give equal time to those who disagreed with him, even if he would mercilessly lambast them afterward. Frequently, though, he had to force the opposition to speak their piece, cutting off their attempts at preambles, red herrings and ad hominem attacks and demanding that they answer the question at hand. If there was an exception to this rule, it was with the cranks and extremists: when he received calls from the religious fringe, conspiracy theorists, ideologues, even members of the Ku Klux Klan--he would let them have their say, even encouraging them to make outrageously offensive and marginal statements and thus discredit themselves. In later years, Lassiter became known for \\"punishing\\" his listeners when they didn't call in. If he reached a point in the show at which the switchboard wasn't lit, rather than riffing or starting a new monologue to fill the time, Lassiter would allow dead air to sit in. He might hum \\"The Anniversary Waltz\\", drum his fingers on the console, or even be heard quietly dealing himself a game of solitaire. Sometimes he would adopt more creative punishments: one night in Chicago, when nobody would address his topic, Lassiter invited calls from Born-Again Christians who wanted to give their personal religious testimonies, and wouldn't allow any other callers. The message was, it was a call-in show, so it was callers' job to carry the program. Lassiter had no intention of doing their job for them. Occasionally, though, he would reward callers who annoyed him with absolute silence: in fact, on the night of August 2, 1996, Lassiter kept a caller on the air at WFLA without saying a word for 12 full minutes. On the other hand, despite his unsparingly caustic demeanor and complete frankness, radio with Lassiter was in many respects a kind of free-for-all. At least once a week, Lassiter would do \\"open phones\\", letting people call in with whatever they wanted to talk about. At times, he would even bypass the call screeners and answer the phones himself—a format he called \\"Chat With Bob\\"--letting prank callers, and anyone who wanted to be on the radio at all, speak (although he would censor them if necessary). This would lead to an inordinant number of people calling in and flushing toilets or holding the receiver up to the radio to hear the show on the six second tape delay; Lassiter would frequently respond to these calls by mocking the lengthy period of time they would wait on hold (typically forty minutes to an hour) just to do something completely trivial. =Monologues= Although he was unpleasant and pointedly controversial, Lassiter was a careful and engaging orator, building his monologues and telephone harassment with masterful diction, phrasing, and dynamics. It was a strategy that worked: he himself often noted that the secret of his success was that even the many people who despised him couldn't help but listen night after night, year after year. Lassiter was not shy about airing his personal life on the air: he shared extremely intimate details of his own childhood (including his parents' divorce and his subsequent estrangement from his father); his first marriage, including stories of an abortion and infidelities by both parties; his own history of recreational drug use; and the ups and downs of his radio career. \\"You probably know more about me than you do about your own spouse, unless you have a better-than- average marriage\\", he once informed his listeners. Listeners were also frequently treated to present-day anecdotes about himself and his second wife Mary (the former Mary Toensfeldt—nicknamed \\"Muffy\\" -- who had been the business manager at WPLP during his tenure there), or his hobbies of astronomy, birdwatching, futures trading, and fiddling with his home computer. Often these were subjects he defaulted to when taking a break from \\"coliseum- style radio.\\" =Stunts= Lassiter was also famous for the hoaxes and stunts he pulled on the radio. At times he told his audiences that he would dunk a kitten into a bucket of water live on the air until the board filled with calls, or that he was now forbidden by broadcast-decency advocates from having any even remotely controversial content on his shows. One Friday in the mid-1990s, he and the entire staff of WFLA convinced listeners that he had been pulled from the air by panicky management while substituting for another host, told them that there would be a major announcement about his future during his regular timeslot on Monday, and when listeners tuned in he was back on the air to rub their nose in their own gullibility. The $50,000 Giveaway The most famous and celebrated of his stunts became known as the \\"$50,000 Giveaway\\", which Lassiter pulled at WPLP on New Year's Day 1987. Explaining that there were to be changes in station policy in attempt to get big ratings, Lassiter announced that WPLP would be awarding $50,000 to each and every person who called that night and every other night in 1987; if they were listening before they called, Lassiter promised, callers would receive an additional $10,000. Additionally, the best caller of each hour would receive a brand-new Rolls Royce, while the worst caller would receive an all-expenses- paid trip to Paris. Other prizes, such as vacation homes, yachts, and a penthouse in the Trump Tower, were offered occasionally throughout the show. Every few minutes as Lassiter talked, his producer Michael Serio would cut in and whisper a disclaimer: \\"Pssst! Hey, he doesn't mean a word of it! So don't get any smart ideas about suing us!\\" Despite this, at least half of Lassiter's callers during his first three hours believed every word he told them and expressed absolute glee at having won $50,000 for doing nothing but calling a radio show. Even when Lassiter explained that to collect their money they merely needed to show up at the station in the morning (though he claimed not to know the address) and ask for it in cash, tax-free, with no need of identification, these \\"winners\\" never seemed to think that anything was fishy. At the end of the third hour, Lassiter admitted openly to his callers that he had been lying all along, pointed out that his promises were absolutely outrageous and unbelievable, and took callers to task for taking him at his word without stopping to think about whether what they were hearing was even possible. Even after he did so, calls continued to pour in from people who wanted to win $50,000. Christmas Show Every year on December 23 (or on the last Friday before Christmas), Lassiter's on-air vitriol seemed to vanish; on that day, he delivered his annual Christmas show, in which he fondly ruminated on the existence of Santa Claus and the meaning of the holiday, then spent the rest of his shift offering his own Christmas reminiscences from his childhood all the way to the present. He told the same stories every year, but always had different and compelling versions of them to keep the audience interested. Regular highlights included the year in which he gave the same Christmas list to each of his recently divorced parents, resulting in two of everything he asked for, and the story of a special present (a Lady Schick electric razor) he'd given his mother when he was twelve, only to discover, when cleaning out her home after her death 26 years later, that she had kept it for all that time. Lassiter's warmth and sentiment on these broadcasts was astonishing in contrast to his usual \\"Mad Dog\\" persona, and listeners often confessed to him that they found themselves captivated by the show, tears streaming down their faces as they relived Lassiter's Christmases with him. On-Air Blunder On January 26, 1989, he was asked to fill in for the first 30 minutes of the following WFLA shift, that of station mainstay Dick Norman. Lassiter straight- facedly informed Norman's listeners that he had just renegotiated his contract and that because his ratings were so high, he was able to demand that WFLA fire Norman. Ironically, the regular news reports during Lassiter's show featured the story of a car that had backed full speed into a large propane tank at a gas station in nearby Brandon, Florida, killing the heretofore unknown driver in a fiery crash. The irony was that the driver was Dick Norman. When he was informed of Norman's death several minutes into the show, Lassiter immediately issued a very emotional, repentant, on-air apology and filled in for the rest of Norman's timeslot, inviting listeners to call in and share their reminiscences of \\"Uncle Dickie.\\" Airchecks Lassiter's unique and provocative style have created a high demand for airchecks of his old shows. One of the most notorious of these, known as \\"Mr. Airstream,\\" is a recording from WPLP on April 1, 1987. It is a phone conversation in which an irate elderly man in an Airstream trailer protests Lassiter's treatment of old people, as well as the President (who, at the time, was Ronald Reagan) and Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker; threatens to report him to the station management, the FCC, the Chamber of Commerce, and even the police; and ends the call by saying, \\"Have a bad night, hippie!\\" Fans of the recording, as well as Lassiter himself, consider it to be the greatest moment in talk-radio history.

Majority of them live in this country, residing mainly in its Katanga, Kasai, and Maniema provinces. The Baluba consist of many sub-groups who speak various dialects of Luba (e.g. Luba-Kasai, Luba-Katanga) or other languages, such as Swahili. The Baluba developed a society and culture by about the 400s CE, later developing a well-organised community in the Upemba Depression known as the Baluba confederation. Luba society consisted of miners, smiths, woodworkers, potters, crafters, and people of various other professions. Kingdoms of the Savanna: The Luba and Lunda Empires, Alexander Ives Bortolot (2003), Department of Art History and Archaeology, Columbia University, Publisher: The Metropolitan Museum of Art Their success and wealth grew greatly over time, but this also caused their gradual decline to marauding bands of slavers, robbers, and terrorists from among Portuguese and Omani led or influenced invasions. History Geographical distribution of the Luba people (approx). Archaeological evidence proves that the Baluba had settlements around the lakes and marshes of the Upemba Depression by the fifth century CE. The evidence suggesting an advanced Iron Age society by then comes from multiple sites, and these are among the best developed archaeological records in Central Africa. The Kamilambian, Kisalian and Kabambian series of evidence has been dated to be from 5th to 14th-century, suggesting a settled stable Luba culture over many centuries.Pierre de Maret (1979), Luba Roots: The First Complete Iron Age Sequence in Zaire, Current Anthropology, University of Chicago Press, volume 20, number 1 (Mar., 1979), pages 233-235 Of these, the Kisalian period (8th to 11th century) pottery and utensils found, were crafted with extraordinary excellence. The finds dated to pre-8th century by modern dating methods are iron objects or pottery, thereafter copper objects appear. The archaeological studies suggest that the Luba people lived in villages, in homes made of reeds and wattle, around the shores of numerous streams and lakes found in the Upemba Depression of Central Africa. This Depression has been historically flooded from the water runoff from southern Shaba highlands for parts of the year, its water bodies filled with papyrus islands and floating vegetation, the region drying out after rains ended. As a community, the Luba people constructed dams and dikes as high as 6 to 8 feet using mud, papyrus and other vegetation, to improve the marshy soil conditions for agriculture and stock fish during the long dry season. With settled communities, states Thomas Reefe – a professor of History, the Luba people had developed metal extraction techniques, skills to make utilitarians products from them and \\"high degree of craft specialization\\". The metal working techniques in use by the early Luba people included drawing out thin wires, twisting and laminating them, plaiting them into complex well designed shapes such as necklaces, bracelets and hooks for fishing, needles for sewing and such. These products attracted interest and demand from far off ethnic groups, creating trade opportunities and traders amongst the Luba people. This trade and all economic activity in the villages of Luba people had a tribute system, where a portion of the hunt, fish or produce was given to the lineage head or the people guarding the borders. These were natural borders, such as that created by waters of Lake Upemba, where passage across required channels and bridges. The movement into and out of the Luba people lands was thus controlled and taxed. =Luba Empire= Around 1500, possibly earlier, the Luba people began to coalesce into a single, unified state which historians now call the Kingdom of Luba or Luba Empire. The kingdom grew and became more sophisticated over time, reaching its peak between 18th to 19th-century. The demands, raids and violence of the 19th-century slave and ivory trade by the European colonial empires such as Belgium and the Arab-Swahili chiefs such as Tippu Tip and Msiri, states Thomas Reefe, \\"tore the Empire apart\\" and ended it. The political sophistication of the Luba Empire was the adoption of two layers of power, one of Balopwe (hereditary kingship) and another a council of royals or elders. These provided governance stability through mutual balancing, when there were disputes of succession from death or other causes. This idea was adopted by the neighboring Lunda people and other ethnic groups. The development and evolution of the Luba Empire, and the life of Luba people therein, has been unclear. This is in part because the Luba people were an entirely oral tradition culture where knowledge and records were verbally preserved without a written script. The orthography for the Luba language, called kiLuba, was invented in the 19th century, and thus early information about the Luba Empire has been derived from documents written by others usually hostile and only aware of the communities at the Luba Empire's border, or by the Luba people only in the late 19th-century and the 20th-century after the best decades of the Empire were long over. The later written texts suggest that the Luba people had developed sophisticated literary traditions around their concepts of good and evil, and integrated these concepts and their religious ideas into their legends about morality and people with power.Newell S. Booth, Jr. (1976), Civil Religion in Traditional Africa, Africa Today, Vol. 23, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 1976), pages 59-66 For example, one legend relates to two kings, one called the red king Nkongolo Mwamba and other called the black king Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe. According to the Luba people's oral history, The Luba people were a part of a large state in the 16th and 17th centuries, ruled by a Balopwe through delegation to regional chiefs. According to the oral tradition by inabanza Kataba, the empire expanded over time, with a major consolidation in the 18th century, partly triggered by the desire by rivals to control the salt and iron mines in the south. The Luba Empire was shielded from Portuguese and other colonial interests by the Lunda Empire, which lay to their southeast. This shielding was noted by David Livingstone in his travel memoirs, and likely blocked the Angolan traders from regular contact with the Luba people. Around the start of the 19th-century, the oral traditions of both the Luba and Kanyok people suggest a major conflict, led by mutual raids. This conflict helped the Luba Empire grow, as its king Ilunga Sungu entered into new territories and formed marriage alliances. By 1810 when he died, his fame and reverence among the Luba people had peaked and the site of his royal court had become Kitenta (royal sacred village) where his spirit was venerated. The Luba Empire (up left) in relationship to others and major trade routes, in the 19th century After the death of Ilunga Sungu, Kumwimbe Ngombe came to power leading his warriors to expand southeast with contacts with traders from East Africa. After his victory, in accordance with Luba traditions, the conquered chiefs and rulers had to marry sisters or daughters from the Luba ruling family in order to tie them into a relationship and loyalty with the Luba Empire capital. The ivory and slave trade had grown to the east of Luba Empire by mid 19th-century, the natural supplies of ivory exhausted while the international demand for it was increasing. The region under Luba people then had abundantly preserved herds of elephants with their tusk. Kanyembo region, states Thomas Reefe, for example had no ivory to sell. In 1840, after Kumwimbe Ngombe died of old age, king Ilunga Kabale succeeded to rule the Luba people. He expanded the empire further, till 1870 when he died. By then, the region of Luba people and their Empire covered much of what is now southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, extending for hundreds of kilometers from their early 19th-century heartland. =Guns, trade and colonial era= The success and wealth of Luba people grew in relative isolation because they were far from the eastern and western coasts of Africa, living in difficult to reach terrain. The forests and mountains protected them, as did their neighbors who blocked traders from direct and regular contact with distant international traders, in order to monopolize the gains from trade with international operators. This originally shielded the Luba from the ill effects of the earlier slave trade. Later, however, the Luba people became victims of the slave demand and trading, in some cases selling people from their own lands as slaves. But, by the 1850s, the slavers began intruding into the Luba people lands. Despite a ban on slave trading in the Western world, the eastern and northern parts of Africa, led by Arab-Swahili slave and ivory traders entered into the eastern and northeastern regions of the Luba Empire. These intruders came with guns, experience of running caravans, other tools of raids and wars. Although he weapons of the Luba people were not primitive (they had weapons such as bows and arrows, swords, axes, poison), the intruders had much more advanced weapons. David Livingstone in his memoir wrote how amazed the Luba people were with the guns, thought they were tobacco pipes and the gun was the weapon that mowed down large populations of the Luba. The notorious slave and ivory trader, Tippu Tip for example wrote, translates Thomas Reefe, \\"Luba had no guns, their weapons were bows and arrows; guns they did not know. The guns we have with us, they asked us, \\"Are they pestles?\\" The conquest of the Luba people was swift.Francois Renault (1988), \\"The structures of the Slave trade in Central Africa in the 19th century.\\" Slavery and Abolition, volume 9, number 3, pages 146-165 Msiri, a Tanzanian operator supplying ivory and slaves to the Sultan of Zanzibar, raided and took over the southeastern Shaba region of Luba people. Its other side, the southwestern borders were breached by the Ovimbundu ivory and slave hunters for the Portuguese interests. While slaves could no longer be exported to the Americas, they were used for work and caravan operations within Africa. Breaches from all sides, by better equipped armies, weakened the Luba Empire rapidly between 1860 and 1880s, and accelerated its demise. In parallel, the news of disarray and confusion from many corners of the Luba Empire, led to internal disputes on succession and strategy when the Luba king Ilunga Kabale died in 1870. By 1868, Said bin Habib el-Afifi had raided Luba operations and with force taken 10,500 pounds of copper. By 1874, another Arab-Swahili trader Juma bin Salum wad Rakad, and a friend of Tippu Tip, had entered into an agreement with one of the Ilunga Kabale's son and established the base of his elephant hunting and ivory trade operations in the heart of the Luba people's lands. The Arab-Swahili raids, such as those by Tippu Tip, into Luba people's lands were organized with Nyamwezi subordinates and slave armies. These raids and attacks by the outsiders also introduced smallpox into the Luba population. Baluba leaders, c. 1905 In 1885 Leopold II, king of Belgium, secured European recognition of his right over the territories that became what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The first Belgian expedition into the Luba people's region arrived in 1891. The king of Belgium, impressed with the accomplishments of Tippu Tip in getting resources from central Africa, appointed him the governor of the region that included the Luba people's territory.Matthew G. Stanard (2015), Belgium Empire, in The Encyclopedia of Empire, John Wiley & Sons, , DOI 10.1002/9781118455074.wbeoe074 The Luba people were forced to work in the copper mines of the Katanga province during the Belgian rule, causing numerous mining-related deaths. They rebelled in 1895, then again from 1905 to 1917, and these insurrections were crushed militarily. =Post-colonial era= In 1960 the Belgians, faced with rising demand for independence and an end to colonial rule, granted independence to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That same year Katanga Province, which was home to a considerable number of Luba, attempted to secede under Moise Tshombe as the State of Katanga. The Luba were divided, with one faction under Ndaye Emanuel supporting the secession, and another under Kisula Ngoye supporting the central government. When Tshombe's breakaway regime collapsed in 1965, Kisula Ngoye became the liaison between the Luba people and the central government. Religion The traditional religious beliefs of the Luba people included the concept of a Shakapanga or a Universal Creator, a Leza or the Supreme Being, a natural world and a supernatural world. The supernatural world was where Bankambo (ancestral spirits) and Bavidye (other spirits) lived, and what one joined the afterlife if one lived an Mwikadilo Muyampe (ethical life). The Luba religions accepts the possibility of communion between the living and the dead. The religious life included prayers, community singing, dances, offerings, rites of passage rituals and invocations. These rituals and services had intermediaries for rites such as Nsengha or Kitobo (priests). In addition, for anxiety and ailments, a Nganga or Mfwintshi (healer) were in service who would perform Lubuko (divination). The religious thought did not limit itself to rituals, but included ideas of a good personhood, good heart, dignity for others and self-respect. The religious code of civil life and goodness affected the Luba social life. Christianity was introduced to the Luba people by missionaries who came with the Belgium colonial rule. Some of these missionaries, such as William Burton, performed ethnographic research, starting with an aggressive projective research and teaching the Luba people, but ultimately became sympathetic as he learnt and understood their traditional beliefs and cultural richness. Culture The Luba people tended to cluster in single street villages, with homes with rectangular thatched roofs on both sides of the street whose lineage is usually related. The homes were in the savanna and forests. They hunted, fished in abundant waters near them, gathered food such as fruits from the wild and had mastered agriculture. In contemporary era, they grow cassava, corn, raise livestock. Some Luba carve wood and produce artist handicrafts. =Art= Art was well developed in the Luba culture. Pottery, articles crafted from iron (such as axes, bows and spears), wooden staff and carvings and parts clad in sheets of copper were routinely produced. A notable artform of the Luba people was the Mwadi, where the male ancestors were represent in their female incarnations of the ancestral kings.Alexander Ives Bortolot (2003), Kingdoms of the Savanna: The Luba and Lunda Empires The Metropolitan Museum of Art According to scholars such as Daniel Kabozi, some of the intricate art works of the Luba people were mnemonic devices, a form of symbolic coded script to aid preserving information and recalling the history and knowledge of the Luba. The Luba people, states Mary Roberts, developed \\"one the most complex and brilliant mnemonic systems in Africa for recording royal history, king lists, migrations, initiation esoterica and family genelogies\\", such as the Lukasa memory board. These artworks are now found in numerous museums of the world.

In addition to his writing, he has worked with the BBC to create and host historical television documentaries, and presents the radio series Making History. Early life and education Holland was born in Oxfordshire and brought up in the village of Broad Chalke near Salisbury, Wiltshire, England, the elder of two sons. His younger brother James Holland is also a historian and author whose focus is World War II. He has said that his two passions as a child were dinosaurs and ancient civilizations: \\"I had the classic small boy's fascination with dinosaurs–because they’re glamorous, dangerous and extinct–and essentially the appeal of the empires of antiquity is much the same. There's a splendour and a terror about them that appealed to me–and that kind of emotional attachment is something that stays with you.\\" Holland attended Chafyn Grove preparatory school and the independent Canford School in Dorset. He then went on to Queens' College, Cambridge,'HOLLAND, Thomas (born 5 January 1968)' in Who's Who 2013 graduating with a 'Double First' (first-class honors in both parts I and II of the course of study in the English Tripos). He began working on a doctoral dissertation on Lord Byron from Oxford University, but soon quit after deciding that he was \\"fed up with universities and fed up with being poor\\" and instead began working. Writing career =Novels= Holland's first books were Gothic horror novels about vampires, set in various time periods throughout history. His first novel, The Vampyre: Being the True Pilgrimage of George Gordon, Sixth Lord Byron (1995), drew on his knowledge of Lord Byron from his university studies and recast the 19th-century poet as a vampire. It was re-titled Lord of the Dead: The Secret History of Byron for the 1996 U.S. release. The Los Angeles Times called it \\"a good vampire yarn—elevated and elegant enough to make you feel you needn't conceal it behind the dust jacket of some self-help work, yet happily gory and perilous\\" although they felt \\"the newly plowed plot ground is sometimes hurried through as if to get to the scholarly stuff, where the author feels perhaps on more solid ground.\\" Its sequel, Supping with Panthers, was published in 1996 (it was also re-titled for the U.S. release, to Slave of My Thirst). Holland stayed with the supernatural horror genre for his next few books, continuing to use his knowledge of ancient cultures and settings. In Attis (1996), he took historical figures from the ancient Roman Republic like Pompey and the poet Catullus and put them in a modern setting among a string of brutal murders. He set 1997's Deliver Us From Evil in 17th-century England, with a man named Faustus leading an army of the undead. 1999's Sleeper in the Sands is set in Egypt, starting with the discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922 and traveling backward in time as a deadly secret is unveiled. Holland's last novel to date departed from the supernatural genre. The Bone Hunter (1999) is a thriller, set in the United States, about the rivalry between two 19th-century paleontologists around whom people begin dying. =Historical non-fiction books= While doing research for The Bone Hunter, Holland read From Alexander to Actium by historian Peter Green and his childhood passion for ancient history and civilizations was reignited. \\"All my old fascination with antiquity just went Whoosh! up again. From that moment I started re- immersing myself in that world. I had a sense that antiquity was almost like a science fiction world, that it was utterly remote and yet eerily like our own. I was doing vampire books at the time and it never crossed my mind to write history–but I was finding that my real interests were welling up, and the vampire books were really historical novels, and that I was much less interested in the fiction than in the research.” He gave up writing fiction and turned to writing history. His first book of history, Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic, was published in 2003 and garnered positive reviews. It was called \\"gripping and hugely entertaining\\" by The Sunday Times, \\"informative, balanced and accessible\\" by BookPage, and \\"a model of exactly how a popular history of the classical world should be written\\" by The Guardian. Rubicon won the 2004 Hessell-Tiltman Prize, awarded to the best work of non-fiction of historical content. Persian Fire: The First World Empire and the Battle for the West (2005) is an account of the 5th-century B.C. Greco- Persian Wars. It was reviewed positively by Paul Cartledge, a professor of Greek history at Cambridge University, for The Independent: \\"If Persian Fire does not win the Samuel Johnson Prize, there is no justice in this world.\\"independent.co.uk: \\"Persian Fire: The first world empire and the battle for the west, by Tom Holland \\", 2 Sep 2005 Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, historian Dominic Sandbrook called it \\"riveting\\" and praised the \\"enormous strengths\\" of the author.telegraph.co.uk: \\"A civilising influence – Dominic Sandbrook reviews Persian Fire by Tom Holland\\", 18 Sep 2015 It won the Anglo- Hellenic League's 2006 Runciman Award. Millennium: The End of the World and the Forging of Christendom (2008) examines the two centuries on either side of the seminal year 1000 A.D., and how Western Europe ascended out of the Dark Ages to become a leading world civilization once again. Noel Malcolm reviewed it for The Daily Telegraph and called it \\"a tremendously good read\\" but criticized the lack of detail about historical evidence and Holland's \\"elevated\\" style of prose. Christina Hardyment, reviewing it for The Independent, praised Holland's writing style, saying he \\"excels at narration, never jogging when he can gallop ... His highly individual road map to the hitherto 'dark ages' is written with forceful – and convincing – panache.\\" Holland's book on the rise of Islam, In the Shadow of the Sword: The Battle for Global Empire and the End of the Ancient World (2012), was called \\"a work of impressive sensitivity and scholarship\\" by The Daily Telegraph and \\"a book of extraordinary richness ... For Tom Holland has an enviable gift for summoning up the colour, the individuals and animation of the past, without sacrificing factual integrity\\" by The Independent. But it was criticized by historian Glen Bowersock in The Guardian as being written in \\"a swashbuckling style that aims more to unsettle his readers than to instruct them ... irresponsible and unreliable\\". Dynasty: The Rise and Fall of the House of Caesar (2015) covers the reigns of the five emperors of Rome's Julio-Claudian dynasty, from Augustus to Nero. Classics professor Emily Wilson, reviewing it for The Guardian, was critical of the \\"overblown style\\" of Holland's writing and the narrative's lurid details, saying of the book \\"this is ancient Rome for the age of Donald Trump\\". But in his review for The Observer, Nick Cohen wrote \\"Among the many virtues of Tom Holland's terrific history is that he does not shrink from seeing the Roman emperors for what they were: 'the west's primal examples of tyranny'.\\" Holland next wrote two historical biographies for children. The first, Athelstan: The Making of England (2016), is a part of the 'Penguin Monarchs' series and covers the life of Æthelstan, the 10th- century ruler widely regarded as the first king of England. The second, Æthelflæd: England's Forgotten Founder (2019) is an entry in the Ladybird Expert series and tells of Athelstan's aunt (and daughter of Alfred the Great), Æthelflæd, who ruled the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia in the early 10th century. Dominion: The Making of the Western Mind (titled Dominion: How the Christian Revolution Remade the World for the U.S. edition), was published in 2019. It is an examination of Christianity's influence on Western civilization in which Holland maintains that the religion's influence continues to be seen in ethics and cultural norms throughout the world today, even when the religion itself is rejected: \\"To live in a western country is to live in a society still utterly saturated by Christian concepts and assumptions.\\" Dominion received positive reviews, with Kirkus Reviews calling it \\"astute and thoughtful\\", and Publishers Weekly saying that \\"entertaining is too light a term and instructive is too heavy a term for a rich work that is enjoyably both\\". Reviewing it for The Times, Gerard DeGroot argued that much of what Holland attributes to Christian influence is simply humanity evolving the need to work together for survival, but said \\"I have to commend the originality of this book, not to mention [Holland's] brave ambition.\\" =Other writing= Holland's new translation of The Histories by Herodotus, the ancient Greek scholar, was published in 2013. Although Holland had studied Latin in school, his Greek is completely self-taught, and he set himself the task of translating one paragraph of the over-800-page Histories every day until he finished. Kirkus Reviews called his translation \\"a feast for students of ancient history and budding historians of any period.\\" Classics scholar Edith Hall reviewed it for The Times Literary Supplement and said it was \\"unquestionably the best English translation of Herodotus to have appeared in the past half-century, and there have been quite a few ... I am in awe of Tom Holland's achievement.\\" Holland has written dozens of articles for newspapers, journals and websites on varied topics including wildlife conservation, sports, politics and history. He also writes frequent book reviews for The Guardian. In March 2019, he announced on Twitter that he had written an opera about Cleopatra and it was in the showcase stage of development.  Radio  Holland adapted the writings of classical Greek and Roman authors Herodotus, Homer, Thucydides, and Virgil for a series of broadcasts on BBC Radio 4. In 2001, Radio Four also broadcast a dramatic play he wrote based on Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War, titled Our Man in Athens. It presented the narrative as that of a veteran war reporter under siege in the studios of Radio Free Athens. Since 2011, he has been one of the presenters of Radio 4's popular history series Making History. Television documentaries =Dinosaurs, Myths and Monsters= In February 2011, Holland wrote and presented Dinosaurs, Myths and Monsters, a BBC Four television program. It explored the influence of fossils on the mythology of various cultures throughout history, including the ancient Greeks and Native Americans. =Islam: The Untold Story= In August 2012, Holland produced and presented a documentary for Channel 4 television titled Islam: The Untold Story, which questioned Islamic doctrine that maintains Muhammad founded the religion in Mecca in the 7th century, and that the Quran was transmitted, in full, directly to Muhammad by Allah (God) via the angel Gabriel, rather than being written by a person or persons. Holland argued that there is very little contemporary historical evidence about the life of Muhammad, with no mention of him at all in historical texts until decades after his death, and no mention of Mecca in any datable text relating to him until over a century after he died. He concluded that it is much more likely that Islamic theology developed gradually over several centuries as the Arab Empire expanded, and that descriptions of Muhammad's home more closely resemble what is now southern Israel than Mecca. Holland said the program provoked \\"a firestorm of death threats\\" against him. Islam: The Untold Story generated more than 1,200 complaints in total to Ofcom and Channel 4 though Ofcom found there was no breach of its broadcasting code to investigate. A planned screening of Islam: The Untold Story before an audience of historians was cancelled, due to security concerns over threats received by Holland as a result of the documentary. Several religious scholars, including Dr. Jenny Taylor, founder of the Lapido Media Centre for Religious Literacy in World Affairs, and Dr. Keith Small of the International Qur'anic Studies Association, defended Holland and the right of historians to critically examine the origin stories of religions. Writing on the Channel 4 website, Holland responded to the criticism by saying that the origins of Islam is a \\"legitimate subject of historical enquiry\\" and that his documentary was \\"a historical endeavour and is not a critique of one of the major monotheistic religions\\". =Isis: The Origins of Violence= In 2017, Holland revisited the topic of Islam by writing and presenting another documentary for Channel 4. Isis: The Origins of Violence looked at the militant terror group ISIS and argued that they use Islamic doctrine to inform and justify their quest for a global caliphate. In the film, Holland visited the site of the 2015 Bataclan theatre massacre in Paris, interviewed a Salafi jihadist leader in Jordan, and then went to the Iraqi city of Sinjar, which had historically been largely populated by the Yazidi minority. In 2014, ISIS forces swept into the city and killed most of the Yazidi men and old women, taking the young women as sex slaves and the young boys to train as ISIS soldiers. At one point, Holland was shown approaching a pit filled with the remains of Yazidi women whom Isis considered too old to be used as sex slaves, and then had to vomit off-camera. In an interview with the Evening Standard to promote the film, he said \\"Just as Nazis justified genocide in terms of racial theory, there are Islamic scholars who justify it in terms of what the Koran says. Not to engage with that, to pretend that's not an issue, is essentially to be complicit in genocide.\\" He also said that westerners are wrong to blame their own foreign policy for the existence of ISIS: \\"We want to believe we have agency. We want to believe it's about foreign policy — because then we can do something about it. But you just have to read Dabiq [the ISIS magazine]. They say upfront: 'We hate you because you’re not Muslim'.\\" Although some Muslim groups once again registered their disapproval of the programme's content and of Channel 4 for airing it, Holland stated their reaction this time was much less severe than with Islam: the Untold Story. Journalist Peter Oborne wrote a rebuttal to it on the website Middle East Eye titled \\"No, Channel 4: Islam is not responsible for the Islamic State\\", in which he stated that the 2003 invasion of Iraq is responsible for ISIS, not Islamic teachings. But The Guardian praised the documentary, saying \\"Isis: The Origins of Violence will start many arguments, but we should be grateful for having broadcasters brave and thoughtful enough to make them.\\" Activism =Conservation= Holland has campaigned and written articles in support of measures to save London's disappearing hedgehog population. He is a staunch opponent of the proposed Stonehenge road tunnel and other development projects that threaten landscapes around Britain's historic sites and since 2018 has been president of the Stonehenge Alliance, a group dedicated to stopping construction of the tunnel (or at least convincing the government to redesign it from the planned 1.8 miles. in length to a longer, deep bored tunnel of at least 2.8 miles that would be less obtrusive to the World Heritage Site). In 2017, he said of the Stonehenge tunnel: \\"The issue is whether Stonehenge exists to provide a tourist experience, or whether it is something more significant, both historically and spiritually. It has stood there for 4,500 years. And up to now, no one's thought of injecting enormous quantities of concrete into the landscape and permanently disfiguring it.\\" =Politics= In August 2014, Holland and fellow historian Dan Snow organized 200 British public figures in signing a letter to the people of Scotland, published by The Guardian, expressing the hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in the September 2014 referendum on that issue. The letter read in part \\"We want to let you know how very much we value our bonds of citizenship with you, and to express our hope that you will vote to renew them. What unites us is much greater than what divides us. Let's stay together.\\" Among the signatories were Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, Mick Jagger, Dame Judi Dench and Stephen Hawking. Earlier that year, he had voiced his desire for the United Kingdom to stay a part of the European Union, saying: \\"I would like to remain a citizen of the European Union, but I would like even more to continue in a country that includes Scotland ... the likelier it seems the United Kingdom will leave the EU, the likelier Scotland is to leave the United Kingdom. I don't want to be a Little Englander. I want to stay European, and I want to stay British.\\" After Britain voted to leave the EU in 2016, Holland stated that he himself had voted Remain, but that since Brexit had been chosen by the people in a democratic vote, the government had to carry through with it. He posted on his Twitter account in October 2018: \\"Brexit has to happen – anything else would be undemocratic. But the result was close, close, close – so the Brexit settlement should properly accept that. I'm sure that's what most people feel.\\" In 2017, Holland joined Scottish businessman/blogger Kevin Hague and history professor Ali Ansari to create a new think tank which they named \\"These Islands\\". It is devoted to stimulating positive debate about Britain's identity, Brexit and the Scottish independence issue, and promoting the idea that staying united as a nation is beneficial to all the countries that make up Great Britain. A number of academics and activists have contributed papers to the These Islands website. In 2019, Holland was a signatory on a public letter to The Guardian denouncing Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party and candidate for Prime Minister, for alleged antisemitism. In an article for The Telegraph, he wrote that Corbyn's support for Palestinian activist Raed Salah was particularly offensive to him due to Salah's spread of the blood libel, which originated in England in the 12th century: \\"England, as the birthplace of this most toxic of lies, has a particular responsibility to take a stand against it. Taking a stand against it, however, is something that Jeremy Corbyn, by backing a promoter of the blood libel, has failed to do.\\" =Yazidi= While filming Isis: Origins of Evil, Holland interviewed Yazidi refugees, survivors of an ethnoreligious population of northern Iraq who in 2014 suffered the mass murder of many of their men and older women, and the kidnapping of their children and young women, by ISIS. In 2017, he wrote an article for The Spectator in which he implored the Western world not to forget the Yazidi. In it, he detailed what ISIS had inflicted upon the Yazidi: > \\"Yazidis [were] shot and thrown like refuse into pits; men and boys beheaded > in front of their families; girls as young as eight subjected to gang rape; > beatings; forced conversions; torture; slavery. In a camp I visited, a woman > who had been raped for an entire year, then shot in the head when her owner > grew tired of her, then finally sold back to her husband, lay curled in a > foetal ball in a makeshift tent, rocking and moaning to herself.\\" In June 2018, he gave an interview to James Delingpole on the latter's podcast and spoke about Western apathy toward the Yazidi's suffering: \\"Nobody in the West really gives a shit. And the reason nobody gives a shit, as a Yazidi refugee I spoke to said, is that in the West you have Christians, you have Muslims, you have Jews who all speak up for their co-religionists, but who cares about the Yazidi? Who cares about them?\\" In June 2019, he joined several other speakers in addressing an assembly of members of Parliament in the Grand Committee room of the House of Commons, where he spoke about the cruelties inflicted upon the Yazidi. Views =Education= Holland has been a proponent of state education over private, saying in 2014 > The wealth that the leading [independent] schools can call upon has become > obscene. How can state-funded schools possibly compete with sports fields > and state-of-the-art facilities that have seen sport, acting and even > popular music dominated by the privately educated? Which said, I am not > convinced that the teaching in private schools is any better than in state > schools. Our local primary school has teachers as good as any you could hope > to meet, and when I compare the start that it has given my children to that > given to the prep-school pupils I know, I do not remotely feel that my > children have come off second-best. Just the opposite, in fact. He supported the plan of Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove to spread the teaching of Latin in state schools. saying in 2014: > Traditionally, an education in ancient languages has served as a marker of > privilege – which is why public schools have always been so keen on > providing it. I don’t see, though, why children should be deprived of the > riches of classical civilisation, just because they are in the state system > ... It is not an elitist policy but the precise opposite: impeccably > progressive. =Christianity= Although his father is an atheist, Holland was raised in the Christian church by his \\"devout Anglican\\" mother, and he said in 2013 that because of her example \\"I've always associated Anglicanism with goodness and decency and generosity of spirit and compassion, so I never had that visceral association of Christianity or institutional religion with repression or dogma or illiberalism\\". Nonetheless, as an adult he disavowed belief in the existence of God, saying \\"I have seen no evidence that would satisfy me that anything supernatural exists. I have seen no proof for god\\". In 2016, he wrote an article titled \\"Why I Was Wrong About Christianity\\" for the New Statesman, in which he said that he had come to realise he was incorrect to have thought in the past that his own western values derived from the Greece and Rome of antiquity and owed nothing to Christianity: > Familiarity with the biblical narrative of the crucifixion has dulled our > sense of just how completely novel a deity Christ was ... [Christianity] is > the principal reason why, by and large, most of us who live in post- > Christian societies still take for granted that it is nobler to suffer than > to inflict suffering. It is why we generally assume that every human life is > of equal value. In my morals and ethics, I have learned to accept that I am > not Greek or Roman at all, but thoroughly and proudly Christian. =Islam and the Islamic State= He has defended himself from critics who have suggested that his views on Islam and its origins are rooted in 'Islamophobia', saying that he merely believes Islam should receive the same kind of historical analysis that other religions do. In 2013, he said in an interview with The Daily Telegraph: \\"Islam is like a shot of caffeine into British culture. It adds a new dimension to the world, it enriches the variety and scope of our intellectual life.\\" In March 2015, Holland published a piece titled \\"We must not deny the religious roots of Islamic State\\" in the New Statesman. It argued that the jihadis of ISIS call themselves Islamic and use text from the Quran to justify their actions, so people like Mehdi Hasan ought not to claim they are not Muslims, as he had in the previous week's issue. Holland wrote that \\"It is not merely coincidence that ISIS currently boasts a caliph, imposes quranically mandated taxes, topples idols, chops the hands off thieves, stones adulterers, executes homosexuals and carries a flag that bears the Muslim declaration of faith.\\"newstatesman.com: \\"Tom Holland: We must not deny the religious roots of Islamic State\\", 17 March 2015 In 2017, he said \\"The mistake people make is to replicate Isis's position, which is that there's one, true form of Islam and anyone who deviates from that isn't a Muslim. That's Isis's justification for killing Shia. Ironically, when Western leaders say 'it's nothing to do with Islam', they're doing the same. I don’t think it's the business—particularly of non-Muslims—to specify what a Muslim is. If people say they're Muslim, they're Muslim.\\" In May 2015, Holland gave the inaugural Christopher Hitchens Lecture at the Hay Festival, in which he addressed the subject of De-Radicalising Muhammad. In an interview he gave to the literary website Quadrapheme the following month he explained that he wanted the lecture to promote discussion of the way Muhammad's life is interpreted, arguing that his \\"mythos lies at the core of what is pernicious in the goings-on of Islamic State and other radicals.\\" Personal life Holland married Sadie, now a midwife, on July 31, 1993. The couple have two daughters and live in Brixton, London. He is the great-nephew of Olympic cyclist Charles Holland, the first Englishman to complete the Tour de France. Holland is a prolific user of the social media site Twitter. He joined the site in January 2011, and as of January 2019, had sent out over 150,000 tweets. In 2016, Holland was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He is a keen cricket fan and player and a bowler for the Authors XI team, which is composed of prominent British writers. He contributed a chapter (about the only time in his years of playing the game that he hit a six, while the Authors XI were playing a team from Eton College) to the book that the team collectively wrote about their first season playing together, The Authors XI: A Season of English Cricket from Hackney to Hambledon (Bloomsbury, 2013). He also wrote an article for the Financial Times about receiving batting training from his cricketing hero, England captain Alastair Cook.

Many make use of decks prepared in advance in order to provide the illusion of spelling card names in a particular sequence. Jean Hugard's Encyclopedia of Card Tricks lists a number of such spelling-based tricks, many of which are considered to be self-working. Pre-arranged deck ace, one of the cards whose names are spelled during this trick In the first style of Spelling Bee trick, the magician shuffles a deck of playing cards and removes a stack of thirteen cards from the top. Holding these cards face down, they state they will be able to spell the name of each card using only that stack. They will draw cards one at a time from the stack. For each card drawn, they spell one letter from the intended card's name, then place the card on the bottom of the deck. After the card's whole name is spelled, the next card drawn will be the intended card. For example, if the magician wishes to spell out \\"ace\\", they will draw three cards, saying the letters \\"a\\", \\"c\\", and \\"e\\" as they go. Then they will draw a fourth card, which will be an ace. The ace is removed from the deck. The magician can then continue through the deck, repeating the process for \\"two\\", \\"three\\", and so on, up to \\"queen\\", until the magician is holding only one card, which will be a king. John Scarne's variation on the trick includes some intentional misspellings as a performance element. This trick requires some preparation on the part of the magician, who arranges the cards in order before beginning the performance. When spelling from ace to king, the order is 3-8-7-A-Q-6-4-2-J-K-10-9-5. For two to ace, the deck is arranged J-4-9-2-K-8-A-5-7-3-Q-10-6. At the beginning of the trick, the magician performs a false shuffle that does not disturb the arrangement of the top stack. The trick can also be performed without the false shuffle, making it accessible to the unskilled performer. The Encyclopedia of Card Tricks presents a more complex variation of this trick, called the Shuffled Spelling Bee. This version uses the entire deck, with the black suits, the spades and clubs, arranged in advance. An audience participant is given a magician's choice that results in the unwanted red suits, the hearts and diamonds, being removed. The spades are provided to the audience member, and the magician then spells out card names using the clubs. A further variation on this trick by Stuart Lee uses all four suits. Audience-selected cards A person selecting a card The second style of \\"Spelling Bee\\" tricks involves one or more audience members selecting and memorizing a card. It is replaced it in the deck, which is then apparently shuffled. The magician reveals the selected card after drawing cards to spell out a word provided by audience members, often the name of the selected card. The magician either controls the placement of the selected card in the deck, knows its location with the help of a key card, or uses sleight of hand to force it out at the appropriate time. In either case, this creates the illusion that the magician was able to predict the appearance of the card with magic. For example, the magician may force the selected card to be the fifth from the top of the deck, then select a volunteer with a four-letter name to deal one card for each letter in their name - four in total. The magician then instructs the volunteer to deal the next card, which will be the selected card.  Nine cards in three piles  A third variation uses nine cards, selected at random. They are divided into three piles of three cards. A participant looks at the bottom card of one pile and memorizes it. That pile is then placed on top of the other two piles, such that the memorized card will be the third card from the top. The magician then begins dealing cards onto the table one at a time from the nine-card stack, one for each letter in a set of words according to a formula. At the end of every step except the last, the remaining cards are placed on top of the dealt cards; this becomes the stack for the next step. The formula is specific and must be followed exactly for the trick to work. In order, the magician spells out the face value of the selected card, the word \\"of\\", the suit of the card (always in the plural form), and any five-letter word of their choice. The top card on the final stack of five dealt cards will always be the original selected card.

Named after the constellation Indus, it was the only ship of the Navy to bear this name. Indus was laid down 4 October 1943 as liberty ship SS Theodore Roosevelt (MCE hull 1814) by Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, Baltimore, Maryland, under a Maritime Commission contract; launched 29 October 1943; sponsored by Mrs. William MacMillan, granddaughter of President Theodore Roosevelt; acquired by the Navy 5 November 1943; converted at the Maryland Drydock Company; and renamed Indus. She commissioned 15 February 1944, Commander. A. S. Einmo in command. After the installation of additional equipment at Norfolk, the net cargo ship conducted shakedown in Chesapeake Bay until 14 March 1944. She sailed from Norfolk 1 April for the Pacific theater, via the Canal Zone, and arrived Espiritu Santo 12 May 1944. Her first assignment was the installation of nets in Seeadler Harbor, and she arrived there 1 June 1944 to direct and support the work of net-laying ships. With these important anti-torpedo nets completed, the ship departed 29 July to load gear at Milne Bay, New Guinea, arriving Mios Woendi to install nets 30 August. Indus then returned to Milne Bay 27 September, and soon afterward became flagship for Commander 7th Fleet Service Forces during the Leyte operation. She sailed 12 October for Hollandia and arrived Leyte Gulf 24 October to support that vital operation. The versatile ship issued stores and did repair work during this period, and during the numerous air raids shot down at least two Japanese aircraft. She departed 6 December for Hollandia where she loaded additional gear and provisions. As the next major assault in the Philippines, the Lingayen Gulf operation, began to take shape at staging bases, Indus joined the service group and departed 28 December for the landing. Although the Japanese made desperate air attacks on the convoy, sinking some ships but suffering heavy losses themselves, the fleet resolutely drove through to its objective. Indus arrived safely at the assault area 9 January 1945 and performed service duties during the initial landing stages. Departing 23 February, the ship sailed to the recaptured base at Subic Bay and on 28 February began to establish net defenses. She continued this vital work until departing 11 May for Hollandia, where she arrived two days later. Indus returned to the Manila Bay area 24 May to unload supplies, then sailed 1 June for Pearl Harbor. She remained there until 30 June, when she sailed with net gear for Eniwetok Atoll, for work on the net defenses there. The veteran ship returned to Pearl Harbor in August, and was in port when the surrender of Japan was announced. She subsequently carried cargo and did net work at Eniwetok, Saipan, and Kwajalein until the end of 1945. She returned to Norfolk 14 March 1946, via the Panama Canal, decommissioned at Norfolk 20 May 1946, and was returned to the Maritime Commission 3 days later. Placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet under her old name, she was berthed at Wilmington, North Carolina until she was scrapped in 1967. Indus received one battle star for World War II service.

As of 2016, the employee-owned, privately held corporation included 1,100 stores in the Southeastern United States with 170,000 employees and sales of $32 billion. Jenkins was widely known as \\"the state's largest commercial employer and head of a chain of stores that was a leader in introducing many innovations, including electric-eye doors and frozen food cases.\\" Early life =Georgia= Jenkins was born in Warm Springs, Georgia, and his family owned a general store in the community of Harris City, Georgia, catering primarily to farmers. In the 1920s, the local cotton fields were decimated by the boll weevil, prompting Jenkins' father to move his business to Atlanta where people had money to buy groceries. Young Jenkins stayed behind to sell the remaining inventory and finish high school. In 1924, he also moved to Atlanta and enrolled at Georgia Tech, going to classes at night, and working days. Jenkins never returned to complete his academic education at Georgia Tech. Jenkins tried a series of jobs, including cab driver (he quit on the first day after getting stiffed for a fare), selling shoes (too slow), selling candy bars on consignment (nobody purchased them), and delivering grocery orders for his father's store. For reasons unknown, he never worked at his father's store to learn the business. He began as a clerk for Piggly Wiggly stores and after eight weeks, was sent to replace a manager who was recovering from an illness. From that point on, his job was temporary manager at all the owner's stores. After four months, Jenkins was not convinced that the grocery business would become his vocation, so he accepted a job selling real estate; he sold one house, collecting a substantial commission. However, his boss was convinced that a fortune could be made in the south Florida land boom. They made plans for the trip, but the wife of his boss refused to go, so Jenkins went by himself. =Move to Florida= About that time, a friend invited Jenkins to join him on a trip to visit family in Sarasota. They stopped in Gainesville, but Jenkins' sister had left on a family visit herself, so the friend took him on to Tampa, where Jenkins knew a man who managed a laundry. That friend encouraged Jenkins to stay the week and—while viewing the sights—they visited another man who owned more than a dozen Piggly Wiggly markets. After learning of Jenkins' grocery experience in Atlanta, the man offered him a job. Jenkins accepted, intending to return to school in the fall. Within a few weeks, however, his boss was so impressed that Jenkins was promoted to manage the store in St. Petersburg and school was postponed. By keeping his store well-stocked and clean, Jenkins saw his sales more than quadruple in less than a year. He was transferred to the company's largest store in Winter Haven, which he managed for four years. In 1930, Florida was reeling following the real estate bubble burst in 1925, followed by the 1926 Miami hurricane, the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane, and the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The chain's owner was forced to sell his stores, which were purchased by a businessman in Atlanta. The new owner chose not to visit his new property, so Jenkins decided to visit him to talk about the future. Jenkins drove to Atlanta, visited the man's office, introduced himself to the secretary, and asked to see the owner. The response was that the owner was not available due to a critical business consultation, but Jenkins could hear the owner talking on the telephone about his golf game. Enraged, Jenkins returned to Winter Haven and began plotting a strategy. He decided to open his own store and compete directly with the new owner. Publix Although the country was in the midst of the Great Depression, Jenkins incorporated Publix Food Stores in 1930 with 30 shares, each valued at $100. He kept 13 for himself and sold four to friends. The butcher and assistant manager at Piggly Wiggly each purchased another four shares, raising $1,200 to supplement Jenkins' savings of $1,300. He and five employees opened a new market next door to his former employer. The chain fought back, bringing in a handsome and charming manager from Miami who supposedly garnered all the customers wherever he went. The two stores began a series of one-upmanships, where the Piggly Wiggly store would offer a shopping premium, and Jenkins' Publix would offer something better. The first year was difficult, but Jenkins' store covered its expenses whilst the Piggly Wiggly closed. As the economy improved, the store did better, and five years later a second store was opened on the other side of town. =First supermarket in Florida= During the depression, Jenkins had purchased an orange grove. In 1940, he used that as collateral to secure a $70,000 bank loan to build the store of his dreams, the first supermarket in Florida. Described as a \\"food palace\\", the building had much glass and marble, with a stucco exterior. There was a paved parking lot, and the front entrance utilized an electric eye automatic door opener. The interior was air conditioned, with bright fluorescent lighting, wide aisles, and music playing in the background. The open dairy cases were custom designed, and freezers offered frozen food. These features were unheard of in the grocery business at that time. The original two Publix stores were closed, but Jenkins realized that he would have to open many more stores to be successful. =Expansion= Building materials were scarce during World War II, so in 1945 Jenkins purchased an existing company: Lakeland Grocery Company of Lakeland, Florida, which operated a chain of 19 locations under the name All American Food Stores. Jenkins promptly moved the Publix offices to Lakeland's existing buildings; Lakeland remains the headquarters of Publix as of 2020. Jenkins travelled frequently, for he was always looking for products and innovations to improve his stores. In the 1950s, bakeries and flower shops were added, delicatessens came in the 1960s, and in the 1980s, pharmacies and Presto!, a network of no-charge automated teller machines. In the early 1990s, the chain began to expand outside of Florida, starting in Georgia. By 1995, there were over 500 supermarkets in three states with almost 100,000 employees and sales of $9.4 billion. =Employee satisfaction= Jenkins was affectionately called \\"Mr. George\\" by his workers, who were known as associates, rather than employees. He believed that workers who owned the business and shared in its success would work harder to exceed customer expectations, so he granted full- time workers stock in the company and shared the store's profits on a quarterly basis. These benefits were eventually expanded to part-timers who worked at least 1,000 hours in a year. Personal life =Family= In 1947, he married Anne MacGregor, a registered nurse. They had seven children: Howard, Kenneth, David, Delores, Carol, Nancy, and Julie. The couple divorced in 1974. =Death and tributes= Jenkins suffered a stroke on August 8, 1989, but continued to work and visit his supermarkets in a wheelchair. Jenkins died in 1996 at Lakeland Regional Medical Center and was buried in Oak Hill Burial Park in Lakeland. He left his wealth to the George M. Jenkins Fund (charity) and his family, which continues to control the company. Florida Governor Lawton Chiles stated, \\"George (Jenkins) made a tremendous contribution to our business climate, but perhaps more importantly, he was a true civic leader who had a deep dedication to improving our communities.\\" Philanthropy Jenkins established the George W. Jenkins Foundation in 1966 to improve Publix communities. After Jenkins' death, the foundation's name became Publix Super Markets Charities. Jenkins' daughter, Carol Jenkins Barnett, serves as its president. In addition to local charities, the corporation supports five national campaigns: Special Olympics, March of Dimes, Children's Miracle Network, United Way of America, and Food for All. Jenkins was once asked, \\"If you hadn't given away so much, how much do you think you would be worth today?\\" Without hesitation, he replied, \\"Probably nothing.\\" Rolling Out The Green Carpet, Publix employee training workbook Honors Jenkins received an honorary Doctorate of Law from Florida Southern College in 1956, and the University of Tampa in 1963. Stetson University conferred an honorary Doctorate of Humanities in 1977, and he was awarded a Doctorate of Science in 1979 from the Florida Institute of Technology. Jenkins was elected president of the Supermarket Institute in 1961 and served through 1963. The article, \\"The Grocer the Girls All Love – George Jenkins, Lakeland, Florida\\" appeared in the October 16, 1954, issue of The Saturday Evening Post. In 1966, Jenkins received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. The George Jenkins Arena in the Lakeland Center opened in 1974 as a multipurpose entertainment facility with seating for 10,000. George W. Jenkins High School in Lakeland was named in his honor in 1993. Jenkins received the Horatio Alger Award in 2007, and was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2009.

In 1898, the community decided that an opera house was required to serve the people of Calumet.Theatre History from the Calumet Theatre. Local architect Charles K. Shand was chosen to design the building, and Chicago interior designer William Eckert developed a crimson, gold, and ivory color scheme for the interior.Calumet Theatre from the state of Michigan The theatre opened on March 20, 1900, with the operetta The Highwayman, by Reginald De Koven and Harry B. Smith, on tour from Broadway. The theatre was one of the first municipal theatres in the country. It soon attracted attention from America's finest actors, actresses, and other theatre greats, such as Frank Morgan (later famous for his roles in The Wizard of Oz), Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., Lon Chaney, Sr., John Philip Sousa, Sarah Bernhardt, and Madame Helena Modjeska among others. As time wore on, the theatre began to lose popularity, due mostly to the decline of the local economy and the increasing popularity of movies. In the late 1920s, the theatre was converted to a motion-picture house, serving in this medium until the 1950s. Summer stock theatre was brought back to the Calumet Theater in 1958, and performed there every summer until 1968, and returned in 1972. In 1975, the auditorium was restored for the centennial of Calumet. In 1988-89, the exterior of the theatre was restored. In 1983, the Calumet Theatre Company was incorporated as a non-profit organization.About Us from the Calumet Theatre In 2013, the theater began working on adding an elevator to improve accessibility for the second floor and balcony. The elevator was installed in 2018. Five staff members and several volunteers help to operate the Theatre. Today, the Calumet Theatre is home to as many as 60 theatre-related events a year, with an estimated 18,000 people attending.

The building sits on a Jacobsville sandstone foundation, and has a copper roof with copper cornices. A porte-cochere covers one entrance, and a clock tower originally rising to include a bell) stands nearby. An illuminated marquee is at the Sixth Street entrance. The theatre itself originally held 1200 seats. With the closure of the 2nd balcony, and addition of the movie projection booth on the 1st balcony, the Theatre now holds 700 seats and features 5 fantastic murals on the proscenium arch. Ghost stories Some of the visitors to the Calumet Theatre hope to catch a glimpse of the reputed ghost of the theatre, Madame Helena Modjeska. The story of the ghost first emerged in 1958, when actress Adysse Lane claimed that the ghost of Madame Modjeska appeared to her during a performance when Lane had forgotten her lines. Since then, unexplainable happenings have occurred. Many people have heard music and felt cold air from nowhere. The Calumet Theatre was featured as a haunted location on the paranormal TV series Most Terrifying Places which aired on the Travel Channel in 2019.

It is a major airfield with a runway, instrument approach facilities, and nighttime illumination. The facility boasts over fifty hangars and an extensive support infrastructure. Overview Tonopah is controlled by the USAF Air Combat Command. The known primary use of this airport is to shuttle government employees to the weapons test range from McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. The primary (paved) access to the facility is off of U.S. Route 6 at the north end of the airport. Dirt road access points also exist on the south and east sides of the range. The site is plainly visible from commercial airliners, which pass north of the base on transcontinental flights. History The Tonopah Range Airport first opened in 1957, supporting operations on the Test Range itself, which was used for United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC, later Department of Energy or DOE) funded nuclear weapon programs. It was apparently not a World War II era field, as it is not listed in the 1944 US Army/Navy Directory of Airfields. Eventually, the installation and its 6,000 ft asphalt runway was abandoned. The area was open range, with wild horses running free. The earliest known depiction of the airfield was on the July 1970 Air Force Tactical Pilotage Chart. The 1982 Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association Airport Directory described the Tonopah Test Range airfield as having a single paved runway. =Foreign technology evaluation= The advent of Operation Rolling Thunder during the Vietnam War in March 1965 led to the introduction of the obsolete and subsonic MiG-17 (J5) and the supersonic MiG-21 by the North Vietnamese Air Force (NVAF) being pitted against U.S. aircraft.Michell III p. 75–81 On 16 August 1966, Iraqi Air Force Captain Munir Redfa took off from Rasheed Air Base, near Baghdad on a routine navigation training flight. He headed southwest in an attempt to defect from Iraq to Israel. Crossing the Jordanian border, Jordanian interceptors were unable to catch him, and upon crossing the Israeli border, two Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) Mirage III interceptors approached his aircraft. Captain Radfa lowered his landing gear, making a signal that he posed no threat, and he was attempting to defect. He landed his Soviet-built MiG-21F-13 (Fishbed \\"E\\") fighter at Hatzor Airbase, Israel and was granted asylum.Michel III p. 75 HAVE DOUGHNUT, (MiG-21F-13) flown by United States Navy and Air Force Systems Command during its 1968 exploitation. The MiG-21 posed a major threat to Israeli Air Defenses as well as to American pilots over the skies of North Vietnam. Over the next year, the IDF put in over 100 hours of testing of the MiG-21 and shared the results with the United States. In a secret agreement negotiated with the United States Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Israel agreed to loan the MiG to the United States in exchange for Israel purchasing the F-4 Phantom II, at the time the top-of-the-line fighter for both the USAF and United States Navy. In late 1967, a USAF DouglasC-124 landed in Israel, and the MiG was loaded into the cargo hold, and flown to Groom Lake. At Groom Lake, it was then re-assembled for flight, and evaluated in a series of test flights known as HAVE DOUGHNUT. The aircraft made its first flight at Groom Lake in January 1968. AFSC recruited its evaluation pilots from the Air Force Flight Test Center, while Tactical Air Command's were primarily United States Air Force Weapons School graduates. By mid-1968, the MiG-21 was far less of an enigma than it had been. Over 102 sorties were flown in the aircraft.

The MiG-17 was of paramount importance to the United States, because it was also used by the North Vietnamese Air Force. It was much more agile than the supersonic MiG-21, and in experienced hands it would run rings around the F-4 Phantom. After a brief period of testing, the first MiG-17, coded HAVE DRILL arrived at Groom Lake in January 1969. The second MiG-17, HAVE FERRY, arrived in March. By June 1969, the results of the evaluations of the MiG-21 and MiG-17s were incorporated into the USAF Fighter Weapons School and the Navy TOPGUN training school.Michel III p. 75, 76 (with photo of ex-Syrian MiG-17 painted with Israel markings) In 1969 Pakistan supplied the U.S. with a Chinese built MiG-19 (J6) which was tested under the Have Drill program.Michell III p. 188, 189We Interview Les Waltman, website These aircraft were given USAF designations and fake serial numbers so that they may be identified in DOD standard flight logs. In May 1973, Project HAVE IDEA was formed which took over from the older HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE FERRY and HAVE DRILL projects. In May 1973, when Project Have Idea was initiated for joint technical and tactical evaluation of Soviet aircraft types, the tactical evaluation flights of foreign aircraft were undertaken by Detachment 1, 57th Fighter Weapons Wing. 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron Tonopah Test Range Airport in 1982 In July 1975, the 4477th Tactical Evaluation Flight (“Red Eagles”) was formed at Nellis AFB as tactical evaluation organization. Also in the early 1970s, the concept of \\"Aggressor Squadrons\\", was born, using the Northrop F-5E Tiger II, which was found to be nearly identical in terms of maneuvering and speed with the MiG-21 to train front-line combat pilots in Soviet Air Force tactics. Aggressor training was done where the units went head to head against USAF fighters in mock dogfights at this time to find out and exploit possible weaknesses. Foreign military sales of United States fighter aircraft to Indonesia and Egypt in the mid-1970s to replace the Soviet fighter aircraft allowed these nations to clandestinely transfer un-needed MiG-21 and ultra modern MiG-23s aircraft to the United States for evaluation. Up to 25 of these Soviet aircraft made their way to Groom Lake and pilots assigned to Detachment 1, 57th FWW at Nellis were sent to the facility for training as \\"Aggressor\\" pilots. These pilots then were reassigned to the aggressor training units at Clark AB, Philippines, RAF Alconbury, England and Nellis AFB. However, by the mid-1970s, as the fleet of Soviet aircraft grew at Groom Lake, the facilities there were becoming crowded and the MiGs needed another clandestine home. Several locations were considered, Michael Army Airfield at the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah, and the Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field on the Goldwater Range in Arizona. The Tonopah Test Range Airport, however, was only 70 miles to the northwest of Groom Lake and was on the controlled AEC Test Range, so it better fit the need for a new home. The AEC airport had the potential for improvement and expansion, with the only public land overlooking the base miles away. Although not as hidden as Groom Lake, the airport was remote enough to operate the Soviet aircraft in secrecy. In fact, the security surrounding the Tonopah Test Range was so effective that the new base was not publicly reported as an Air Force military airfield until 1985. On 1 April 1977, the 4477th TEF was reassigned to Tonopah. In December 1977 the 6513th Test Squadron (“Red Hats”) was formed at Edwards AFB to perform technical evaluations of these aircraft. In 1980 the 4477th TEF was re-designated as the 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron and the operation was renamed again to Constant Peg. The squadron developed realistic combat training operations featuring adversary tactics, dissimilar air combat training, and electronic warfare. Planes kept coming in from other sources as well. No less than three Cuban pilots brought their MiGs to Florida. A number of Chinese made MiGs were purchased outright from China via the front company Combat Core Certification Professionals Company (CCCP!) and imported in crates. Three Syrians flew their MiG-23 and MiG-29s to Turkey in 1988. Over the course of its history U.S. test pilots flew several models of Soviet- designed MiGs. * Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 were a subsonic, early jet aircraft design. Though originally meant to counter American bombers of the 1950s and 1960s, durable, cigar-shaped MiG-17s became North Vietnam's primary fighter and eventually served in at least 20 air forces worldwide. MiG-17s were designated as: : YF-113A Soviet MiG-17F NATO:\\"Fresco-C\\" used in HAVE DRILL program : YF-113C Chinese J-5 used in HAVE PRIVILEGE program : YF-114C Soviet MiG-17F NATO:\\"Fresco-C\\" used in HAVE FERRY program \\"Red 84\\" MiG-21F-13 taxiing past the control tower, 1986 : YF-114D Soviet MiG-17PF NATO:\\"Fresco-D\\" (Serial: 75-008) * Shenyang J-6 (J-6/Jianjiji-6 (Fighter Aircraft, Type 6)/F-6 (Export model) Farmer, is a 30mm gunMichael III p. 189, 212 Chinese license built version of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19, Russia's first supersonic interceptor. While the USSR produced less than 2,000 MiG-19s, later discarding it in favor of the MiG-21 due to excessive accidents, the Chinese endorsed the aircraft, fixed the reliability problems and built over 3,000 of them; more than any other nation.Gordon p. 60, 61 J-6s were exported to North Vietnam at the end of Operation Rolling Thunder which ended in 1968, but saw extensive aerial combat during operations Linebacker and Linebacker II in 1972. The J-6 made its first flight in 1959 and went into production in 1963.Gordon p. 62 Six primary models were produced:Gordon p. 61–65 : Shenyang J-6 (F-6) Farmer-C Tactical Fighter : J-6A (F-6A) Farmer-B Interceptor : J-6A Farmer-B W/Missiles : Nanchang J-6B Farmer-D Interceptor W/Missiles : Shenyang J-6C Farmer-C Tactical Fighter : Shenyang J2-6 (FR-6) Farmer-C Tactical Reconnaissance Fighter Pakistan was the first and largest customer of the J-6 (F-6) receiving nearly 300 aircraft, mostly of the J-6C (F-6C) variety.Gordon p. 107 There were few external differences between the earlier MiG-19 and J-6 models. Later J-6 models had their pitot tubes positioned on the right side of the fuselage forward of the cockpit and a bullet-shaped fairing which contained the brake parachute positioned under the aircraft's fin.Gordon p. 63, 65 * Mikoyan- Gurevich MiG-21 were cone-nosed, supersonic fighters that were somewhat less maneuverable than MiG-17s. They also saw action with the North Vietnamese and became a popular export aircraft, with more than 8,000 produced. MiG-21s were designated as: : YF-110B Soviet MiG-21F-13 NATO:\\"Fishbed-C/E\\" (Serials assigned: 75-001, 75-004 and 75-010) : YF-110C Chinese Chengdu J-7B (MiG-21F-13 variant) : YF-110D Soviet MiG-21MF NATO:\\"Fishbed-J\\" \\"Red 49\\" MiG-23 on the Tonopah ramp, 1988 * Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 were the MiG-21's replacement. Their swing-wing was patterned on that of the F-111, but unlike their US antecedent, the MiG-23s were small and light enough to serve as dogfighters. MiG-23s were designated as: : YF-113B Soviet MiG-23BN NATO:\\"Flogger-F\\" : YF-113E Soviet MiG-23MS NATO:\\"Flogger-E\\" In addition, unconfirmed Soviet aircraft flown were MiG-25 Foxbat (YF-116); MiG-29 Fulcrum (YF-118) and Sukhoi Su-22 Fitter (YF-112). Crashes associated with the foreign aircraft included the 1979 Tonopah MiG-17 crash during training versus an F-5 and the 1984 Little Skull Mountain MiG-23 crash which killed a USAF general, Robert M. Bond. Aerial dogfights were staged between the various MiG models against virtually every fighter in US service, and against SAC's B-52 Stratofortress and B-58 Hustlers to judge the ability of the bombers countermeasures systems, they performed radar cross-section and propulsion tests that contributed greatly to improvements in US aerial performance. Two 64th Fighter Weapons Squadron F-5s with a 4477th TEF MiG-17 (leading) and MiG-21 (trailing) in 1979. Note the Tactical Air Command badge applied to the vertical fin of the MiG-21. All the models had quirks. The MiG-17 did not have an electric seat, so pilots had to use cushions to position themselves properly inside the cockpit. Both it and the MiG-21 had pneumatic brakes applied by squeezing a lever on the front of the stick. Many of the MiG-21s did not have steerable nose gears, making them difficult to taxi; the sign of a novice Fishbed pilot was the zigzag track he made while moving on the ground. If a pilot put the throttle back on a MiG-21, it would take a long time to spool up again when trying to accelerate. Thus many of those who flew it stayed on afterburners as much as possible. The MiG-23 did not have that problem, as it was designed for speed—but it was unstable and difficult to fly. None of the Soviet-designed aircraft at Tonopah flew in bad weather or at night. All were very short-legged, compared to contemporary US aircraft, and sorties were limited to 20 minutes or so. The MiGs had US airspeed indicators and a few other minor instrument and safety modifications. Other than that, they were stock—down to their Warsaw Pact paint jobs. Two pilots of the 4477th died flying the Soviet planes. The pilots had no manuals for the aircraft, although some tried to write one. Nor was there a consistent supply of spare parts, which had to be refurbished or manufactured at high cost. What was learned during these projects prompted the US Navy to commence Top Gun exercises first at NAS Miramar, California and then NAS Fallon, Nevada. Shortly thereafter the Air Force commenced its Red Flag exercises at Nellis AFB, Nevada.Constant Peg, Air Force Magazine, April 2007, Vol. 90, No. 4Steve Davies: \\"Red Eagles. America's Secret MiGs\\", Osprey Publishing, 2008 l1986 photo of members of the 4477th Tactical Evaluation Squadron standing in front of \\"Red 85\\", a former Indonesian MiG-21F-13 under evaluation Near the end of the Cold War the program was abandoned and the squadron was disbanded. Flight operations closed down in March 1988, although the 4477th was not inactivated until July 1990, according to one official Air Force history. The decision to shut down operations may have had something to do with the fact that a new generation of Soviet aircraft was entering service and also the inevitable round of budget cuts from Washington. The assets of the squadron could not go to the boneyard at Davis-Monthan AFB, and the fate of them remains, in some cases, still classified. Several of the F-110s (MiG-21) were sent to museums or now are on static display. Some of the airplanes may have been broken up, and it is rumored that some were buried in the Nevada desert. In addition, a few were used for target practice on Air Force weapons ranges. In 2006, the Constant Peg program was declassified and the USAF held a series of press conferences about the former top secret US MiGs. It was revealed that the US MiGs flew more than 15,000 sorties and nearly 7,000 aircrew flew in training against dissimilar aggressors in the Nevada desert between 1980 and the end of the program in 1988. Detachment 3, 53d Test and Evaluation Group After the 4477th TES was inactivated, the remaining assets were reconstituted as a detachment of the 57th Fighter Wing at Nellis AFB. It later became DET 2, 57th Fighter Wing in October 1991 and DET 2, 57th Wing in April 1993; in October 1996, DET 2, 57th Wing, became Detachment 3 of the 53rd Test and Evaluation Group. It is believed that Air Force Material Command operates MiG-29 Fulcrums and Su-27 Flanker aircraft somewhere in Nevada flying against Fighter Weapons School instructors, 422d Test and Evaluation Squadron aircrews and F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon \\"Aggressor\\" aircraft flying from Nellis AFB. It is known that the USAF continues a Foreign Materiel Acquisition/Exploitation program, although the extent of acquisitions and operations of that program is not available. In March 1991, in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War, a team from the Joint Captured Materiel Exploitation Center arrived at Jalibah Southeast Air Base in Iraq. They returned with a MiG-29 nose, providing Air Force intelligence personnel with a Slot Back I radar and the Fulcrum's infrared search and tracking system. Later in the decade, Air Force intelligence personnel were able to acquire more complete versions of the MiG-29, the result of spending money rather than fighting a war. In October 1997, the US purchased 21 fighter aircraft from the Republic of Moldova—including the MiG-29UB. According to the National Air and Space Intelligence Center, after \\"undergoing years of study\\" and employing \\"all the [center’s foreign materiel exploitation] resources,\\" the MiG-29UB was displayed in front of NASIC headquarters at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. An Iraqi Air Force MiG-25 Foxbat found buried under the sand at Al-Taqaddum Air Base, Iraq, 2003 In 1997, the United States purchased 21 Moldovan aircraft for evaluation and analysis, under the Cooperative Threat Reduction accord. Fourteen were MiG-29Ss, which are equipped with an active radar jammer in its spine and are capable of being armed with nuclear weapons. Part of the United States’ motive to purchase these aircraft was to prevent them from being sold to \\"rogue states\\", especially Iran.\\"Transcript.\\" Defense Link In late 1997, the MiGs were delivered to the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, though many of the former Moldovan MiG-29s are believed to have been scrapped. In 2003, after the seizure of the Iraqi Air Force Al-Taqaddum Air Base, an advanced Russian MiG-25 Foxbat was found buried in the sand after an informant tipped off U.S. troops. The MiG was dug out of a massive sand dune near the Al Taqqadum airfield by U.S. Air Force recovery teams. The MiG was reportedly one of over two dozen Iraqi jets buried in the sand. Contrary to what some in the major media have reported, not all the jets found at captured Iraqi Air Force bases were from the Gulf War era. The Russian-made MiG-25 Foxbat recovered was an advanced reconnaissance version never before seen in the West and was equipped with sophisticated electronic warfare devices. Air Force recovery teams had to use large earth-moving equipment to uncover the MiG, which was over 70 feet long and weighed 25 tons. The advanced electronic reconnaissance version found by the U.S. Air Force is currently in service with the Russian air force. =F-117A Nighthawk program= Uncoded F-117A Nighthawk 79-10782 (FSD-3). Photo taken while assigned to the 4450th Tactical Group, 1989. The F-117s did not carry tail codes while in development and flight testing in order not to identify their place of origin In the 1980s, Tonopah Airport became a major operating location for the Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk. The first flight testing of the stealth YF-117A aircraft began in June 1981 at Groom Lake Nevada. However, Groom Lake had too many other operations going on to support an operational unit. The F-117 test unit remained at Groom until short after the 1991 Gulf War. In addition, there were security concerns because an operational unit based at Groom Lake would involve many more people who could now see things that they should not be seeing. Therefore, a new covert base had to be established for F-117 operations.Area 51 In the summer of 1979, Tonopah Test Range Airport was selected to be the home of the Tactical Air Command 4450th Tactical Group (4450th TG). The mission of the 4450th at Tonopah was to guide the classified F-117A Stealth Fighter to an initial operating capability.Peebles, Curtis, (1999), Dark Eagles, Presidio Press; Revised edition, Beginning in October 1979 Tonopah Test Range Airport was reconstructed and expanded. The base was immediately staffed with US Air Force security police. The flight line was walled off with a double fence; the only access to the runway was through gates. The area between the fences was lighted at night and had intruder detectors. At first, the facilities were limited to a few buildings, a small mess hall, and sixteen winterized trailers. Security checkpoints were placed on the sole public access road which led to the TTR. The runway was lengthened to . Taxiways, a concrete apron, a large maintenance hangar, and a propane storage tank were added. Phase II of the expansion consisted of the construction of an extra taxiway, a new control tower, a hangar, a parts warehouse, a dining hall, a water storage tank, and extensive fuel storage tanks. Phase III expansion of the facility was a runway extension to a total length of . Extensions were made to taxiways, the ramp, the runway gained arrester gear, and new navigation aids were installed. More fuel storage was provided, together with Liquid Oxygen (LOX) storage, a fire station, and the first 24 aircraft hangars. The cost was over $100 million. 4450th Tactical Group - F-117 Test Pilots On 17 May 1982, the move of the 4450th TG from Groom Lake to Tonopah was initiated, with the final components of the move completed in early 1983. The Tactical Air Command (\\"R\\"-Unit), also known as the \\"Baja Scorpions\\" unit, remained at Groom Lake until the last production F-117 was delivered from Lockheed in July 1990. During the operational lifetime of the F-117, however personnel from Tonopah and later Holloman AFB would be temporarily deployed to Groom Lake for various checkout flights of classified elements of the aircraft.Pace, Steve (1992) F-117A Stealth Fighter, Aero Publishers; 1st edition The F-117 project was highly classified and Tonopah Test Range became a black project facility. Nearly all Air Force personnel and their families lived in the city of Las Vegas. Group personnel would be flown to Tonopah each Monday morning and board a contract Key Airlines Boeing 727-100 aircraft at Nellis AFB, which operated about 15 daily flights between the two bases. The member would live in dormitories at \\"Mancamp\\" during the work week, then fly back to Nellis AFB Thursday afternoon or Friday morning. All dormitory rooms had private bathrooms and showers, televisions with about 30 cable TV channels, a telephone with unrestricted local service to Las Vegas, access to laundry rooms in the building, and access to 24-hour recreational and dining facilities around Mancamp. Civilian engineers and executives were allowed to commute on the Key Airlines or Janet flights, but all other civilians generally lived in the surrounding region and drove to the TTR in their own vehicles or commuted in chartered buses. On Friday afternoons, the reverse would take place, leaving only essential personnel at Tonopah over the weekend. At Nellis, the passenger jets sitting in the shadow of the foothills bordering the flight line became a common sight. If the base personnel knew—and many of them did—that the contractor aircraft were there to ferry most of the 2,500 inhabitants of Tonopah to work, they did not talk about it much. It was part of what became known as the “Night Hawk spirit,” the devotion to a secret worth keeping. It pervaded Tonopah and its sister base at Nellis, where thousands of family members knew not to ask where their loved ones went for four days each week. Support aircraft 4450th TG A-7D at Nellis AFB. Because of the tight restrictions on F-117A flights during the 4450th TG \\"black\\" era, a surrogate aircraft was needed for training and practice and to provide a cover story for the 4450th TG's existence. The aircraft chosen was the Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV) A-7 Corsair II. The A-7Ds came from England AFB, Louisiana, which was converting to the A-10 Thunderbolt II. The A-7 had been chosen as an interim trainer because its cockpit layout and avionics were considered similar to those in the F-117. It was also a single- seat attack fighter, as the F-117 was programmed to be. It therefore would bring all pilots to a common flight training base line. The 4450th TG was the last active USAF unit to fly the A-7D. Along with the A-7Ds that came from England AFB, the group acquired one of the new A-7K twin-seat trainers from the Arizona Air National Guard for checkout flights at Nellis. A second A-7K was acquired from Edwards AFB (73-1008), which was the prototype two-seater that had been converted from its original A-7D configuration in 1978. In doing so, the group became the only active-duty unit to fly the A-7K. T-38 Talon 68-8016 at Tonopah Airport T-38s replaced the A-7Ds in early 1989 after the public announcement of the F-117A's existence. A-7D flight operations began in June 1981 concurrent with the very first YF-117A flights. The A-7's wore a unique \\"LV\\" tailcode (for Las Vegas) and were based officially at Nellis Air Force Base. They were maintained by the 4450th Maintenance Squadron, based at Nellis. Some A-7s operated from Tonopah from the beginning, and care was taken to leave them outside the hangars, so that satellites passing overhead could see that Tonopah operated nothing more exciting than some Corsairs. There were approximately 20 aircraft, including a couple of A-7K trainers. In addition to providing an excuse for the 4450th's existence and activities the A-7's were also used to maintain pilot currency, particularly in the early stages when very few production F-117As were available. The pilots learned to fly chase on F-117A test and training flights, perform practice covert deployments, and practice any other purpose that could not be accomplished using F-117As, given the tight restrictions imposed on all F-117A operations. On off-range flights, the pilots talked to the air traffic controllers as if they were in an A-7D Corsair II. Each F-117 aircraft also carried a transponder that indicated to radar operators that it was an A-7. In January 1989, just three months after the USAF admitted the F-117A existed, the aging A-7's were replaced with newer T-38A and AT-38B Talon trainers as a measure to streamline the F-117A's training operation. Many of these \\"Talons\\" formerly belonged to the 4447th TS \\"Red Hats\\" that flew \\"acquired\\" Soviet aircraft at Groom Lake, Nevada. One of the AT-38B Talons even served as a USAF Thunderbird in the 1970s. With the arrival of the T-38s, the squadrons Corsairs were retired; the borrowed A-7K being returned to the Arizona Air National Guard. F-117A operations F-117s and an A-7D performing an aerial refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker Routine F-117A operations began in late 1982. Before each night's sorties, there would be a mass briefing of the pilots, followed by target and route study. The hangar doors were not opened until one hour after sunset. This meant the first takeoff would not be made until about 7:00 P.M. in winter and 9:30 P.M. in the summer. Eventually two waves were flown per night. This involved eight primary aircraft and two spares, for a total of eighteen sorties. The aircraft would fly the first wave (called the \\"early-go\\"), then return to TTR and be serviced. A second group of pilots would then fly the second wave (the \\"late-go\\"). Typically, the training flights simulated actual missions. A normal mission would have two targets and several turn points. On other nights, there would be a \\"turkey shoot\\" with some fourteen targets. The pilots would get points for each one; at the end of the night, they would be added up to see who \\"won.\\" The missions ranged across the southwest, and the targets were changed each time, to make it more challenging. Ground Maintenance performed inside a hangar at Tonopah Airport on 79-10802 The second wave was completed by about 2:30 or 3:00 A.M. in the winter, a few hours later in the summer. The planes had to be in their hangars and the doors closed one hour before sunrise. After landing, the pilots would be debriefed. The area around TTR was closely monitored. If a truck was seen in the hills around the base, it would be checked out, as were airplanes flying near the base's restricted airspace. Air Force members were also prohibited from driving into the town of Tonopah without special permission. Internal security at the base was also stringent. Personnel crossing into the double-fence area housing the hangars and flightline were required to pass through a security control point. This relied upon the Identimat hand geometry scanner, a biometric technology acquired by Wackenhut, the same company that provided perimeter security on the TTR. The F-117 operations building was a giant vault with no windows. Within the building was another vault room where the flight manuals were stored. When in use, the manuals always had to be in the pilot's physical possession. If a pilot had to go to the bathroom, his manuals were loaned to another pilot or returned to the vault. The new F-117 fleet was considered for several high-profile military operations during the mid-1980s, but operations remained largely confined to nighttime flights around Nevada and California for a number of years. It took a presidential authorization to begin off-range flights. In the event of an unscheduled landing, the pilots carried a signed letter from a senior Air Force general ordering the base or wing commander to protect the aircraft.  37th Tactical Fighter Wing  F-117A Nighthawk 85-0830 being towed at Tonopah after its return from Operation Desert Storm, 1991. Note the spotters, the armed security police with M-16s, and tow bar attached to the front landing gear. In spite of the tight security, the Air Force was already making plans to “normalize” future support within the AF Logistics Command structure. As a “black” program, it would probably never achieve a support structure similar to that for F-15s or F-111s. Sacramento Air Logistics Center was tasked in late 1983/early 1984 to prepare to take on full logistics and management responsibility for support of the F-117A. A depot was established in 1984 to accomplish repairs and install modifications on the aircraft. This depot, first located in Lockheed's Palmdale Plant 10 (PS-77), eventually took the place of Lockheed Depot Field Teams performing the depot work at Tonopah. The F-117s were moved between the TTR and depot by C-5, and were only loaded and unloaded at night. This arrangement required the aircraft to be defueled, disassembled, cradled, and then loaded aboard the C-5, flown to the depot, and unloaded before the real work could begin. Of course, this meant that the reverse actions had to occur at the end of the depot work before the aircraft could be reassembled, flight- tested, and redelivered to Tonopah. In addition to the logistical problems, the security also created safety problems. The nighttime operations resulted in two F-117A losses due to spatial disorientation, one of the planes crashing 30 miles east of the airfield in October 1987. An F-117 based at Tonopah Test Range and piloted by Maj. Ross Mulhare crashed on July 11, 1986 near Bakersfield, California. Another F-117 piloted by Michael C. Stewart was lost on October 14, 1987 on the range about 30 miles east of the TTR Airfield, and it took the Air Force nearly a day to find the wreckageFatigue, night flights add to danger for F-117 pilots, Mark Thompson, Houston Chronicle, 3 June 1989. In both crashes the pilot was killed on impact, and both were attributed to fatigue and disorientation. An F-117 Nighthawk with a T-38 Talon chase plane flying over Tonopah Test Range Airport. In November 1988 the Air Force formally acknowledged its F-117 activities at Tonopah, bringing what was a \\"black world\\" program into \\"gray world\\" status. However F-117 flight operations continued to be restricted to the nighttime hours. Late in 1989 the Air Force began preparations to lead the F-117 into regular Air Force operations. This would be done in two phases: first, bringing the aircraft under the umbrella of the Tactical Air Command, and second, locating the fleet at a regular Air Force base. The first phase came on October 5, 1989 when the 4450th Tactical Group was inactivated and the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing from George AFB was assigned to Tonopah. The Tactical Air Command (TAC) also activated the Det 1, 57 Fighter Weapons Wing (FWW) at Tonopah. During this phase, three pairs of F-117 aircraft left the TTR for Panama in December 1989 to participate in Operation JUST CAUSE. Only one mission with two F-117As was attempted. In April 1990, the F-117 was placed on public display at Nellis AFB and the Air Force mission at Tonopah Test Range became a mostly unclassified \\"white world\\" program, though at no time would the general public be permitted near the TTR complex or on the Nellis Range. During this phase, daytime F-117 flying operations began. Previously, training sorties were flown at nighttime under radio silence and without air traffic control contact. The change to daytime, white-world flying required much less vigilance on the part of pilots and was cited as improving the safety of training operations. A short history of the 37th Training Wing. Office of History, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas Summer 1990 saw the peak of Air Force activity at the Tonopah Test Range Airport. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait the base was mobilized to support Desert Shield. On August 19, 1990, 22 F-117A's from the 415th and a dozen tankers left Tonopah for Langley AFB. A total of 18 F-117s would continue onward to Khamis Mushait Air Base in Saudi Arabia for Operation DESERT SHIELD, followed by hundreds of TTR support personnel. The planes and a contingent of Tonopah Test Range personnel remained in Saudi Arabia until late 1991. As a result of the deployment and the pending relocation to New Mexico, flying operations and staffing at the TTR declined significantly during 1991. Some of the support facilities which had been open 24 hours a day, such as the dining halls and library, began routinely closing at night.  Move to Holloman Air Force base  The second phase of real-world integration came in January 1990 with the announcement that the 37th TFW would move from Tonopah to Holloman AFB, New Mexico, which would ultimately be delayed due to the Gulf War. As a result of the end of the Cold War, reduced defense budgets were the order of the day. In reviewing its tactical bases and the costs of maintaining them, It was determined that the 37th FW operations from Tonopah required considerable logistics support via commercial air and trucking. All military personnel were permanently assigned to Nellis AFB, Nevada, and were transported once each week by air. Also the security requirements of the F-117A had been lessened with its introduction into the Air Force inventory as an operational weapons system. It was determined that a considerable amount of money would be saved by moving the F-117 operations out of the remote site at Tonopah. Tactical Air Command also believed, while Tonopah Airport was adequate for testing and development of aircraft, it was unsuitable as a fully operational tactical base. Also, the Air Force wanted to retire the F-15A/B Eagles operated by the 49th Fighter Wing at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, most of which were manufactured in the mid-1970s and were costing more and more to operate. As a result, plans were put in place to construct suitable facilities for the F-117A at Holloman AFB and to retire the F-15A/B models of the 49th FW. The official ceremony for the F-117A arrival at Holloman AFB came on May 9, 1992, setting into motion the final exodus of the Air Force at Tonopah. On June 1, 1992 Det 1, 57 FWW moved from Tonopah to Nellis AFB. On July 8, the 37th FW was inactivated and the 415th FS, 416th FS, and 417th FS had all become part of the 49th Fighter Wing. By August 1992, the TTR Airport was largely in caretaker status with many of the facilities mothballed. =Post 1992 = After 1992, very little was published about what, if any, aircraft were based there. The facility was placed on caretaker status effective 31 December 1992, however the USAF continued to maintain the runway as active along with the navigation aids remaining open to the DOE and the USAF on an as-needed basis. In July 2001, a commercial McDonnell Douglas MD-82 aircraft landed at the Tonopah Test Range airfield due to a cargo fire warning light, according to an ASRS report. It departed without incident.  Role and operations  = RQ-170 Sentinel = RQ-170 Sentinel. The 30th Reconnaissance Squadron, operating Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, was activated at Tonopah in August 2005 as part of the 57th Operations Group at Nellis. The squadron currently operates the USAF's RQ-170 Sentinel UAVs. It may also be used by the Detachment 3, 53d Test and Evaluation Group for foreign aircraft evaluation testing. =F-117A storage= In 2008, the surviving fleet of 52 production F-117As were stored, with wings removed, in their original hangars at Tonopah. Since the aircraft still contain classified material, the Air Force was not able to mothball them in the normal facilities and will use hangars at Tonopah instead. One of the mothballed Stealth Fighters is painted in “Gray Dragon” experimental camouflage. The last operational F-117A left Air Force Plant 42 at Palmdale, California, home of the Lockheed Skunk Works for Tonopah on 11 August 2008, marking the disbandment of the 410th Flight Test Squadron, the last operational F-117A squadron. Of these, one was scrapped to test effective methods of disposing of the fleet.Barrier, Terri. \\"F-117A retirement bittersweet occasion.\\" Aerotech News and Review, March 16, 2007.

Lindbergh State Park is a 569-acre (2.3 km²) Minnesota state park on the outskirts of Little Falls. The park was once the farm of Congressman Charles August Lindbergh and his son Charles Lindbergh, the famous aviator. Their restored 1906 house and two other farm buildings are within the park boundaries. The house, a National Historic Landmark, and an adjacent museum are operated by the Minnesota Historical Society, known as the Charles Lindbergh House and Museum. Three buildings and three structures built by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s were named to the National Register of Historic Places. These buildings include a picnic shelter and a water tower, built in the Rustic Style from local stone and logs, and have remained relatively unchanged since construction. Although the property includes shoreline on the Mississippi River, the Lindbergh family requested that the park not include intensive use areas for swimming or camping, so development was kept to a minimum. History Charles August Lindbergh, known as C.A., was a prominent lawyer and real estate trader in Little Falls. In March 1901 he married Evangeline Lodge Land, the college-educated descendant of two notable Detroit medical families, who had come to Little Falls the previous autumn as a teacher. She, C.A., and his two daughters from a previous marriage moved to a property, which C.A. had purchased for a dairy farm three years earlier. They had a three-story house built on the bluff overlooking the Mississippi River. A tenant's house was built across the road for the farm workers. Charles Augustus Lindbergh was born in 1902, and would be the couple's only child. A barn was built later that year, and the farm was populated with cattle, goats, hogs, sheep, chickens, and pigeons as well as cats and dogs. On August 5, 1905 a fire started for unknown reasons on the third floor. The house burned down to its stone foundation, but the Lindberghs and their servants escaped injury and managed to save many of the household items. The Lindberghs had a new house built on the foundation of the first. However it was much smaller, due to C.A.'s overextended finances and a growing strain in the marriage. The new house fit awkwardly onto the footprint of the old, necessitating a short hallway with seven doors leading off. The basement, intended as a library for C.A., and the upper floor was never finished. Instead, C.A. entered politics and in 1907 began serving the first of five consecutive terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. For the next decade the younger Charles spent much of each year in Detroit and Washington, D.C., living only two or three months at the house in Little Falls. However, Charles would credit his time spent on the farm and playing along the Mississippi for his strength and self-reliance. The unfinished upper floor became Charles' exclusive play area, and upon hearing an unusually loud engine one day in 1911 he climbed out onto the roof and saw his first airplane. and Evangeline's relationship with C.A. and his daughters worsened, and in 1917 she and Charles moved back into the house year-round. Charles continued sleeping in his bedroom, which was really a screened-in porch, on all but the very coldest winter nights. He began overseeing the farm and was an early adopter of mechanization technology. Charles left in 1920 to attend college and returned only once, in 1923, arriving in his Curtiss JN-4 plane and landing in a field on the west side of the property. In the next two years the barn burned down and C.A. died, and the farm was largely neglected. After Charles Lindbergh became famous in 1927, souvenir seekers frequently broke into the empty house and caused extensive damage. Encouraged by locals hoping to see the house protected, the Lindbergh family donated the farm to the state of Minnesota in 1931 as a park in memory of C.A. The family worked with the Minnesota Historical Society to restore the home, and donated many original furnishings. The Works Progress Administration developed the park for recreation. In 1969 the house and its grounds were transferred to the Minnesota Historical Society. In what was to be his final public address, Charles spoke from the porch of his boyhood home at the 1973 grand opening of an adjacent interpretive center. He died the following year. The visitor center initially focused on the three generations of Lindberghs in America, at the request of the spotlight-leery Charles. However, a 2002 remodeling doubled the exhibit space and added more about the aviator himself. In 1989 the WPA developments were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. The district contains six contributing properties—two buildings (a picnic shelter and latrine), two structures (the water tower and a retaining wall along Pike Creek), and two objects (drinking fountains near the picnic shelter). All were built between 1938 and 1939. They are considered historically significant as examples of New Deal federal work relief and Minnesota's state park development, and architecturally significant for their National Park Service rustic design. The same picnic shelter design was used in Lake Bemidji State Park. Park grounds The land is glacial till deposited between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago. Slate boulders carried in by glaciers from farther north are visible in the bed of Pike Creek. The vegetation remains similar to its pre-settlement composition of pine forest with oak and prairie openings. Damming has raised the water level of the Mississippi substantially from the days when Charles Lindbergh swam in it. The park has a campground with 38 sites, 15 of those with electrical hookups. There is also a group campsite that accommodates up to 30 people, one walk-in campsite, and a canoe-in site along the Mississippi River.

The building was built after the St. John's fire of 1846 by Halifax architect David Stirling. The British Bank of North America was formed in 1835 and opened its first colonial branch in Newfoundland in 1837, with other branches soon to follow in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, British Columbia, Yukon and in California. From 1857 to 1894 the building was acquired by the Commercial Bank of Newfoundland and had replaced the original hipped roof with a mansard roof. In 1892 it sustained more fire damage in the fire of 1892, it was of the few structures that survived the devastation. It was reconstructed by William Howe Greene, who had also built the Supreme Court House and Cabot Tower. In 1895 the Bank of Montreal moved into the building and two years later, the only Newfoundland bank to survive the 1894 Crash, the Newfoundland Savings Bank, moved into the building.

The library has been incorporated into the flight simulation packages FlightGear and OpenEaagles. It can also be called from a small standalone program to create a batch simulation tool. JSBSim has been in development and use since 1996, and has been built on all of the most popular platforms in use today including those running Linux, Macintosh, and Microsoft Windows operating systems. JSBSim is written in C++ and uses XML configuration files. History and Overview JSBSim (Jon S. Berndt) was conceived in 1996 as a lightweight, data-driven, non-linear, six degree-of-freedom (6DoF), batch simulation application aimed at modeling flight dynamics and control for aircraft. Since the earliest versions, JSBSim has benefited from the open source development environment it has grown within, and the wide variety of users that have contributed ideas for its continued improvement. It has been incorporated into larger, full- featured, flight simulation applications and architectures (known examples are FlightGear and OpenEaagles), and has been used as a batch simulation tool in industry and academia. As an example of ease of use, the following code illustrates how JSBSim could be called by a small program, with execution being controlled by a script: #include int main(int argc, char **argv) { JSBSim::FGFDMExec FDMExec; bool result = true; FDMExec.LoadScript(argv[1]); while (result) result = FDMExec.Run(); } The above application works when built with the JSBSim library, and it only needs to be supplied with an aircraft configuration file, an initial conditions file, and a script file that controls execution. All of these files are defined using XML (eXtensible Markup Language). JSBSim is perhaps the first flight dynamics model to employ XML to describe an aircraft for simulation. An example of an aerodynamic definition is shown below: aero/qbar-area fcs/flap-pos-deg 0.0 0.0 10.0 0.007 20.0 0.012 30.0 0.018 Input Output Features When running JSBSim in a standalone mode using the basic driver program, one only needs to supply a script name. Control inputs can be supplied to JSBSim from within the script. If the aircraft configuration file contains an input port specification, the user can also telnet into JSBSim. From within the telnet interface, values of many parameters internal to JSBSim can be both read and set. The simulation itself can also be paused and resumed. The telnet feature, of course, is most valuable for running JSBSim in real-time. The sample standalone application included with the JSBSim distribution supports running in soft real-time. JSBSim can be directed to output logically grouped sets of data to the console (screen), to a file, or to a socket. Output can simultaneously be directed out through any number of channels, where each channel can contain any set of data or single specific parameter, can be directed towards any file or socket (or even the console), and can be output at any rate. A utility included with JSBSim takes the whole data file output by JSBSim and creates a complete set of plots in PDF format, using the open source plotting tool, gnuplot. Flight Control Features The JSBSim Commander Flight Control System Editor JSBSim allows a flight control system or autopilot to be constructed from individual components. The suite now includes: filters, conditional switch, summer, sensor, and gain (variable and static) components. Additionally, there is a function component that can be defined by the user. A sample flight control system block diagram is seen below in the flight control system editor for the separate open source project, JSBSim Commander (currently in the early stages of development, but functional). Aerodynamics Modeling JSBSim uses a coefficient build-up method for modeling the aerodynamic characteristics of aircraft. Any number of forces and moments (or none at all) can be defined for each of the axes. Each force/moment specification includes a definition comment, and a specification of the function that calculates the force or moment. The function definition can be a simple value, or a complicated function that includes trigonometric and logarithmic functions, and a one-, two-, or three-dimensional table lookup. Propulsion Modeling JSBSim includes generic piston/propeller, rocket/nozzle, turbine, and turboprop models. The models are not detailed engineering models, but they allow engines to be added easily. Any number of engines can be added to an aircraft model, at any location and orientation, and different engine types can be mixed. Equations of Motion JSBSim is a full, six degree-of-freedom flight dynamics model. It provides the capability to specify initial conditions, and to trim the aircraft in several ways prior to startup. Specific integrators can be chosen for propagating each of the translational and rotational velocities and positions. Currently, 3rd order Adams-Bashforth is the default. Extensibility JSBSim is designed to be extensible. The key objects (engines, flight control components) are implemented as base classes with a simple interface. Specific, new engines can be modeled by creating new classes derived from the base classes. New flight control components can be created in the same manner. Notable uses JSBSim is the default flight model used with the FlightGear open source simulator. Along with FlightGear, JSBSim is used to drive the motion base simulator at the University of Naples in Italy. JSBSim is included as a driving application for the OpenEaagles simulation environment. JSBSim has been used to model the flight of rockets (from sounding rockets to larger launch vehicles). It has been used to model the flight of UAVs—including the ARES vehicle designed to fly in the Martian atmosphere. It has been used as part of an air traffic control study. JSBSim has been used together with MATLAB and Simulink, has been compiled as a DLL, and has been ported to C#. The C# port is out of date and is no longer publicly available. Future plans Development continues on JSBSim itself. Additional tools that work with JSBSim are also emerging. A freely available tool called DATCOM+ (a derivative of Digital Datcom) outputs an aerodynamic specification directly in JSBSim-ML format (the XML aircraft file format). JSBSim Commander is under development as an editor for creating and modifying JSBSim models.

It is used in combination with the strong two clubs bid and is a form of preemptive bid. The term refers to an opening bid, and is not to be confused with the \\"weak jump overcall\\", which denotes a similar type of hand, but is bid over an opponent's opening bid. Acol players tend to restrict the weak two bid to the major suits (i.e. 2H or 2S), as 2D is hardly preemptive. Instead 2C and 2D may be used for different types of strong hands (8 playing tricks, or 23+/game force, respectively, in \\"Benji Acol\\"). The requirements for a weak two bid may vary by partnership agreement. The most common treatment is that it requires: * any good suit of exactly six cards in diamonds, hearts or spades; a longer suit should make a higher preemptive opening bid * no side five-card suit or four-card major * in modern tournament play, the announced range for a weak two-bid is usually 5-10, 5-11, 6-10 or 6-11 HCP; for some a hand with six in a suit plus 11 points may be strong enough for a bid at the one level; see Rule of 20 What constitutes a \\"good\\" suit is again a matter of partnership agreement. The American Contract Bridge League recommends that the opener hold at least two of the top three or three of the top five cards in the suit (that is, either K-Q or Q-J-10 or better). Others recommend at least three honors (K-Q-J). History A prototype of the weak two was used in auction bridge, and the principle was attested as early as 1910 by J.B. Elwell.History of Weak Two, Chris Ryall website It was incorporated into the Vanderbilt Club system. In early 1940s, Howard Schenken developed the modern weak two-bid along lines similar to Vanderbilt's. In Charles Goren's original bidding system, when a player opened the bidding with two of a suit, this signified that the player held a very strong hand. (This later became known as the strong two bid.) Later players found it more effective to reserve only the conventional two clubs opening; to show a strong hand. That left the room for opening bids of 2, 2, or 2 to show a weak hand with a six-card suit. This became known as the weak two bid. In some systems, a bid of 2 shows a strong hand with a five-card suit, and a bid of 2 shows a hand that is similarly strong, but balanced. These alternate versions are less common. Responses Standard American and Standard English Acol responses to weak twos are as follows... * A raise of the bid suit extends the preempt, and is to play. The weak two bidder does not bid again. * A bid of 2NT is 17+ artificial forcing enquiry. * A new suit is forcing and at least invitational. This is known as RONF for raise only non-forcing bid. After a 2NT enquiry. * A bid of three of any suit other than the suit of the \\"weak two\\" bid shows a \\"feature\\" (typically either an ace or a king) in the named suit and maximum. * A bid of three of the suit of the \\"weak two\\" bid denies a \\"feature\\" in any other suit and is minimum. * A bid of 3NT shows a maximum without a feature. Common Variations Some pairs play a feature shows a stop for NT. Weak Pulls * A new suit at the lowest level shows a weak hand with a long suit and is to play. The weak-two bidder does not bid again. Ogust * When using the Ogust convention, the following alertable responses apply: ** 3 shows a \\"minimum\\" hand and a \\"poor\\" suit. ** 3 shows a \\"minimum\\" hand and a \\"good\\" suit. ** 3 shows a \\"maximum\\" hand and a \\"poor\\" suit. ** 3 shows a \\"maximum\\" hand and a \\"good\\" suit. ** 3NT shows A-K-Q of the preempt suit. Here, the definitions of \\"minimum\\" and \\"maximum\\" hands and \\"poor\\" and \\"good\\" suits are matters of partnership agreement. ** A range of seven HCP or less for a \\"minimum\\" hand and eight HCP or more for a \\"maximum\\" hand is fairly typical. ** Since \\"strict\\" preempts usually show either K-Q or better or Q-J-10 or better, partners who play \\"strict\\" preempts typically regard a \\"good\\" suit as something more (K-Q-J or better, for example). On the other hand, partners who are less strict in their preempts might define a \\"good\\" suit to have either K-Q or better or Q-J-10 or better and a \\"poor\\" suit to have anything less. There are several variations on the Ogust convention. Ogust's original definition, for example, had the swapped responses in the red suits and did not include the 3NT response. The responses shown here, however, are now pretty much standard. Parallel Twos Playing Parallel Twos an opening 2 shows five hearts 7-11 HCP, 2 shows five spades 7-11 HCP. The 2 and 2 opener's are referred to as Parallel Twos because they are played in parallel with the regular six card weak twos in hearts and spades. You can play them in any bidding system Acol, SAYC, Precision, Blue Club etc. See the eBook \\"Parallel Twos For You\\" N.Jones June 2014. Muiderberg, Lucas Twos or Woo Twos The Muiderberg convention, like Parallel Twos, allows weak two-level bids to be made on five card suits, but use different bids and have additional shape constraints to allow use on weaker hands. Typically a non-vulnerable Muiderberg Two shows 5-9 points, a 5 card major and 4+ cards in a minor, and the bid is 2 of the major. Vulnerable, a 5-5 shape is often preferred. To find opener's second suit, responder can bid 2NT (strong enquiry) or 3 (weak, asking opener to pass or correct to 3). The regular six card weak twos in hearts and spades are generally shown using the multi 2 diamonds.  Antispades Twos  Antispades Twos (also known as Antispades Weak Twos) make up a two-level opening based on either a six-card suit or a two-suiter with at least nine cards distributed across any two suits. The 2♣ opening promises 5-10 HCP and either a 6-card club suit, or clubs and diamonds, or clubs and spades. The 2 opening promises 5-10 HCP and either a 6-card diamond suit, or diamonds and hearts, or diamonds and spades. The 2 opening promises 5-10 HCP and either a 6-card heart suit, or hearts and spades, or hearts and clubs. (The 2♠ opening is artificial and very strong, promising either 23+ HCP balanced, or a hand of 16+ HCP with four losers or fewer.) Partnerships can adopt Weak, Parallel, Lucas or Antispades Twos and retain their existing one- level bidding structure -- for example, Acol or Five-card Majors -- along with a strong balanced meaning for the 2NT opening.

Playing with Central Districts' junior teams, Kinnear was selected with pick 56 in the 1997 AFL Draft by Collingwood and was touted as a key forward. Kinnear made his senior AFL debut in 1998 and had a breakthrough period in 2000–2001 which saw him live up to potential as a key-position player. He could play as a mobile forward, with good hands and had height, and was retained on the list. Kinnear however played just one game for Collingwood in 2002, where he kicked an infamous pass across the face of goal against Carlton. Playing most of his football with Collingwood's Victorian Football League (VFL) affiliate the Williamstown Seagulls, Kinnear made some senior appearances in 2003, but a serious ankle injury against Richmond saw him stretchered off the ground, and looked like the end of his career. However, Kinnear recovered and returned to the seniors for the 2003 finals and played in the 2003 AFL Grand Final, where Collingwood lost to Brisbane Football Club.

Named after Culebra, an island between Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, it was the only ship of the Navy to bear this name. Culebra Island was laid down 29 October 1943 as liberty ship SS John F. Goucher (MCE hull 1830) by Bethlehem Fairfield Shipyard, Baltimore, Maryland, under a Maritime Commission contract. She was launched 23 November 1943 and sponsored by Miss J. F. Miller. Culebra Island was transferred to the Navy on 29 November 1943 and commissioned 19 May 1944 with Commander W. E. McClendon in command. Departing Norfolk 30 June 1944 Culebra Island reached Milne Bay, New Guinea, 16 August. She joined Floating Repair Unit 1 of the 7th Fleet at Alexishafen and remained there on repair duty until arriving at Hollandia 7 October. Here she prepared ships for the Leyte operation until 25 December when she departed for San Pedro Bay, towing a drydock and escorting a tug convoy. From 6 January to 21 February 1945 she repaired and tended ships in San Pedro Bay, then sailed to Mindoro to ready LSMs for the forthcoming invasions in the southern Philippines. On 14 April she sailed for Morotai to serve ships bound for the Borneo operation and repaired those damaged there until 24 July when she returned to Leyte. Culebra Island remained in the Philippines on repair duty until 1 December 1945 when she sailed for San Diego, California. Arriving 9 January 1946 she served at the US Naval Repair Base until placed in commission in reserve 30 November 1946. Culebra Island was placed out of commission in reserve 15 January 1947. She was scrapped in 1974.

Krishna was a member of the Yadava tribe. In later Hindu texts such as the Mahabharata, the Harivamsha and the Puranas mention Yadu as the eldest son of king Yayati and his queen Devayani. The prince of King Yayati, Yadu was a self-respecting and a very established ruler. According to the Vishnu Purana, the Bhagavata Purana and the Garuda Purana, Yadu had four sons, while according to the rest of the Puranas he had five sons. The kings between Budha and Yayati were known as Somavanshi. According to a narrative found in the Mahabharata, and the Vishnu Purana, Yadu refused to exchange his years of youth with his father Yayati. So he was cursed by Yayati that none of Yadu's progeny shall possess the dominion under his father's command. Thereby, he could not have carried on the same dynasty, called Somavamshi. Notably, the only remaining dynasty of King Puru was entitled to be known as Somavamshi. Thereby King Yadu ordered that the future generations of his would be known as Yadavas and the dynasty would be known as Yaduvanshi. The generations of Yadu had unprecedented growth and got divided into two branches.  Descendants  Sahasrajit's descendants were named after his grandson, Haihaya, and were known as the Haihayas. King Kroshtu's descendants were often referred to as the Yadavas. According to P. L. Bhargava, when the original territory was partitioned between Sahasrajit and Kroshta, the former received the part lying to the western bank of the river Sindhu and the latter received the territory situated along the east bank of the river. Several castes and communities in modern India, such as the Sainis of Punjab Province, Yadav or Ahir(Ayar), Chudasama, Jadeja, Bhatti Rajputs, and Jadaun claim descent from Yadu.

The words \\"texture\\" and \\"microstructure\\" are interchangeable, with the latter preferred in modern geological literature. However, texture is still acceptable because it is a useful means of identifying the origin of rocks, how they formed, and their appearance. Textures are penetrative fabrics of rocks; they occur throughout the entirety of the rock mass on a microscopic, hand specimen and often on an outcrop scale. This is similar in many ways to foliations, except a texture does not necessarily carry structural information in terms of deformation events and orientation information. Structures occur on hand-specimen scale and above. Microstructure analysis describes the textural features of the rock, and can provide information on the conditions of formation, petrogenesis, and subsequent deformation, folding or alteration events. Sedimentary microstructures Description of sedimentary rock microstructure aims to provide information on the conditions of deposition of the sediment, the paleo-environment, and the provenance of the sedimentary material. Methods involve description of clast size, sorting, composition, rounding or angularity, sphericity and description of the matrix. Sedimentary microstructures, specifically, may include microscopic analogs of larger sedimentary structural features such as cross- bedding, syn-sedimentary faults, sediment slumping, cross-stratification, etc. =Maturity= The maturity of a sediment is related not only to the sorting (mean grain size and deviations), but also to the fragment sphericity, rounding and composition. Quartz-only sands are more mature than arkose or greywacke. =Fragment shape= Fragment shape gives information on the length of sediment transport. The more rounded the clasts, the more water or wind- worn they are. Particle shape includes form and rounding. Form indicates whether a grain is more equant (round, spherical) or platy (flat, disc-like, oblate); as well as sphericity. Roundness Roundness refers to the degree of sharpness of the corners and edges of a grain. The surface texture of grains may be polished, frosted, or marked by small pits and scratches. This information can usually be seen best under a binocular microscope, not in a thin section. =Composition= Composition of the clasts can give clues as to the derivation of a rock's sediments. For instance, volcanic fragments, fragments of cherts, well-rounded sands all imply different sources. =Matrix and cement= The matrix of a sedimentary rock and the mineral cement (if any) holding it together are all diagnostic. =Diagenetic features= Usually diagenesis results in a weak bedding-plane foliation. Other effects can include flattening of grains, pressure dissolution and sub-grain deformation. Mineralogical changes may include zeolite or other authigenic minerals forming in low-grade metamorphic conditions. Sorting Sorting is used to describe the uniformity of grain sizes within a sedimentary rock. Understanding sorting is critical to making inferences on the degree of maturity and length of transport of a sediment. Sediments become sorted on the basis of density, because of the energy of the transporting medium. High energy currents can carry larger fragments. As the energy decreases, heavier particles are deposited and lighter fragments continue to be transported.http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/geol111/sedrx.htm This results in sorting due to density. Sorting can be expressed mathematically by the standard deviation of the grain-size frequency curve of a sediment sample, expressed as values of φ (phi). Values range from <0.35φ (very well sorted) to >4.00φ (extremely poorly sorted). Metamorphic microstructure The study of metamorphic rock microstructures aims to determine the timing, sequence and conditions of deformations, mineral growth and overprinting of subsequent deformation events. Metamorphic microstructures include textures formed by the development of foliation and overprinting of foliations causing crenulations. The relationship of porphyroblasts to the foliations and to other porphyroblasts can provide information on the order of formation of metamorphic assemblages or facies of minerals. Shear textures are particularly suited to analysis by microstructural investigations, especially in mylonites and other highly disturbed and deformed rocks. =Foliations and crenulations= On the thin section and hand specimen scale a metamorphic rock may manifest a planar penetrative fabric called a foliation or a cleavage. Several foliations may be present in a rock, giving rise to a crenulation. Identifying a foliation and its orientation is the first step in analysis of foliated metamorphic rocks. Gaining information on when the foliation formed is essential to reconstructing a P-T-t (pressure, temperature, time) path for a rock, as the relationship of a foliation to porphyroblasts is diagnostic of when the foliation formed, and the P-T conditions which existed at that time. Flinn Diagram showing degree of stretching, or lineation (L) versus flattening, or foliation (S) =Lineations= Linear structures in a rock may arise from the intersection of two foliations or planar structures, such as a sedimentary bedding plane and a tectonically induced cleavage plane. The degree of lineation compared with the degree of foliation for certain strain markers in deformed rocks are commonly plotted on a Flinn diagram. =Ductile shear microstructures= Very distinctive textures form as a consequence of ductile shear. The microstructures of ductile shear zones are S-planes, C-planes and C' planes. S-planes or schistosity planes are parallel with the shear direction and are generally defined by micas or platy minerals. Define the flattened long-axis of the strain ellipse. C-planes or cissalement planes form oblique to the shear plane. The angle between the C and S planes is always acute, and defines the shear sense. Generally, the lower the C-S angle the greater the strain. The C' planes are rarely observed except in ultradeformed mylonites, and form nearly perpendicular to the S-plane. Other microstructures which can give sense of shear include * sigmoidal veins * mica fish * rotated porphyroblasts Igneous microstructure Analysis of igneous rock microstructure may complement descriptions on the hand specimen and outcrop scale. This is especially vital for describing phenocrysts and fragmental textures of tuffs, as often relationships between magma and phenocryst morphology are critical for analysing cooling, fractional crystallization and emplacement. Analysis of intrusive rock microstructures can provide information on source and genesis, including contamination of igneous rocks by wall rocks and identifying crystals which may have been accumulated or dropped out of the melt. This is especially critical for komatiite lavas and ultramafic intrusive rocks. =General principles of igneous microstructure= Igneous microstructure is a combination of cooling rate, nucleation rate, eruption (if a lava), magma composition and its relationships to what minerals will nucleate, as well as physical effects of wall rocks, contamination and especially vapor. =Grain texture= According to the texture of the grains, igneous rocks may be classified as * pegmatitic: very large crystals * phaneritic: rocks contain minerals with crystals visible to the unaided eye, commonly intrusive * aphanitic: rapid cooling, crystal nucleation and growth is stunted, forming a uniform, fine grained rock * porphyritic: containing phenocrysts in a fine groundmass * vesicular: contains voids caused by trapped gas while cooling * vitreous: glassy or hyaline without crystals * pyroclastic: rock formed of fragments of crystals, phenocrysts and rock fragments of a volcanic origin * equigranular: rock crystals are all the same size =Crystal shapes= Crystal shape is also an important factor in the texture of an igneous rock. Crystals may be euhedral, subeuhedral or anhedral: * Euhedral or automorphic, if the crystallographic shape is preserved. * Subeuhedral or Subhedral, if only part is preserved. * Anhedral or xenomorphic, if the crystals present no recognizable crystallographic forms. Rocks composed entirely of euhedral crystals are termed panidiomorphic, and rocks composed entirely of subhedral crystals are termed subidiomorphic. =Porphyritic structure= Porphyritic structure is caused by the nucleation of crystal sites and the growth of crystals in a liquid magma. Often a magma can only grow one mineral at a time especially if it is cooling slowly. This is why most igneous rocks have only one type of phenocryst mineral. Rhythmic cumulate layers in ultramafic intrusions are a result of uninterrupted slow cooling. When a rock cools too quickly the liquid freezes into a solid glass, or crystalline groundmass. Often vapor loss from a magma chamber will cause a porphyritic texture. Embayments or 'corroded' margins to phenocrysts infer that they were being resorbed by the magma and may imply addition of fresh, hotter magma. Ostwald ripening is also used to explain some porphyritic igneous textures, especially orthoclase megacrystic granites. =Phenocryst shape: implications= A crystal growing in a magma adopts a habit (see crystallography) which best reflects its environment and cooling rate. The usual phenocryst habit is the ones commonly observed. This may imply a 'normal' cooling rate. Abnormal cooling rates occur in supercooled magmas, particularly komatiite lavas. Here, low nucleation rates due to superfluidity prevent nucleation until the liquid is well below the mineral growth curve. Growth then occurs at extreme rates, favoring slender, long crystals. Additionally, at crystal vertices and terminations, spikes and skeletal shapes may form because growth is favoured at crystal edges. Spinifex or dendritic texture is an example of this result. Hence, the shape of phenocrysts can provide valuable information on cooling rate and initial magma temperature. =Spherulites= Spherulitic texture is the result of cooling and nucleation of material in a magma which has achieved supersaturation in the crystal component. Thus it is often a subsolidus process in supercooler felsic rocks. Often, two minerals will grow together in the spherulite. Axiolitic texture results from spherulitic growth along fractures in volcanic glass, often from invasion of water. =Graphic and other intergrowth textures= Intergrowths of two or more minerals can form in a variety of ways, and interpretations of the intergrowths can be critical in understanding both magmatic and cooling histories of igneous rocks. A few of the many important textures are presented here as examples. Graphic, micrographic texture, and granophyric textures are examples of intergrowths formed during magmatic crystallization. They are angular intergrowths of quartz and alkali feldspar. When well-developed, the intergrowths may resemble ancient cuneiform writing, hence the name. These intergrowths are typical of pegmatite and granophyre, and they have been interpreted as documenting simultaneous crystallization of the intergrown minerals in the presence of a silicate melt together with a water-rich phase. Intergrowths that form by exsolution are aids in interpreting cooling histories of rocks. Perthite is an intergrowth of K-feldspar with albite feldspar, formed by exsolution from an alkali feldspar of intermediate composition: the coarseness of perthitic intergrowths is related to cooling rate. Perthite is typical of many granites. Myrmekite is a microscopic, vermicular (worm-like) intergrowth of quartz and sodium-rich plagioclase common in granite; myrmekite may form as alkali feldspar breaks down by exsolution and silicon is transported by fluids in cooling rocks. Iron-titanium oxides are extremely important, as they carry the predominant magnetic signatures of many rocks, and so they have played a major role in our understanding of plate tectonics. These oxides commonly have complex textures related both to exsolution and oxidation. For instance, ulvospinel in igneous rocks such as basalt and gabbro commonly oxidizes during subsolidus cooling to produce regular intergrowths of magnetite and ilmenite. The process can determine what magnetic record is inherited by the rock. See also   References * Vernon, Ron H., 2004, A Practical Guide to Rock Microstructure, Oxford University Press, Oxford.

Though they basically play pop/alternative rock, their music has touched a number of other styles throughout their 30-year career, such as new wave, punk rock, grunge, MPB and electronic music. They are one of the most successful rock bands in Brazil, having sold more than 6,3 million albums as of 2005 and having been covered by several well-known Brazilian artists and a couple of international singers.Titãs' covers by other artists at País dos Banguelas They were awarded a Latin Grammy in 2009 and have won the Imprensa Trophy for Best Band a record four times. Titãs started with a rather unusual line-up of nine members (including six lead vocalists): Nando Reis (bass guitar, vocals), Branco Mello (vocals), Marcelo Fromer (Rhythm guitar), Arnaldo Antunes (vocals), Tony Bellotto (Lead guitar), Paulo Miklos (sax, mandolin, harmonica, vocals), André Jung (drums), Sérgio Britto (keyboards, vocals) and Ciro Pessoa (vocals). Pessoa quickly left the band even before their debut album, Titãs, was released. André Jung was the initial drummer, but just after Titãs he also quit and was replaced by Charles Gavin, establishing their classic line-up. Since then, the band lost five members who were never officially replaced: in 1992, Antunes left to pursue a solo career. In 2001, Fromer died after being hit by a motorcycle in São Paulo. In the next year, Reis also left the group to focus on his solo albums. In 2010, Gavin left due to personal reasons. The most recent change was the departure of Miklos, who wanted to focus on personal projects. After Fromer's death and Reis' departure, the band performed with some session guitarists and bassists, but ended up having Mello and Britto as full-time bassists (with Britto performing only when Mello sings) and Miklos as the rhythm guitarist. After Gavin left, the band has been working with Mario Fabre, a session drummer. For Miklos' position, they hired Rita Lee's son Beto Lee. The band has released their latest studio album in 2018, titled Doze Flores Amarelas.  History  =1981-1985: Formation and first works= Most of the band members (except for guitarist Tony Bellotto and drummer Charles Gavin) met at Colégio Equipe in São Paulo at the end of the seventies and, after their first live performance at the school itself in 1981, the band began to perform live in several night clubs around the city. Their very first performance was at the Mário de Andrade Library - on that occasion, Nando Reis played the drums. The first lineup was: Arnaldo Antunes (vocals), Branco Mello (vocals), Marcelo Fromer (rhythm guitar), Nando Reis (bass guitar), Paulo Miklos (sax and vocals), Sérgio Britto (keyboards and vocals), Tony Bellotto (lead guitar), Ciro Pessoa (vocals) and André Jung (drums). It was a pop/new wave-styled band, with a rather conventional sound and odd looks, with tender and little ball neckties. In 1984, Pessoa left the band, unwilling to exchange the local night clubs for popular TV shows. Soon after, the band signed with the WEA label to record their first album, Titãs, produced by Pena Schimdt, and featuring songs previously recorded with Pessoas's vocals. Although poorly promoted and hardly a success, the band spawned their first hit: \\"Sonífera Ilha\\", later recorded by singer Moraes Moreira. Following the release, Reis briefly left the band, willing to focus on another group he played at (salsa act Sossega Leão, in which he was a percussionist and crooner), but two weeks later he changed his mind and was accepted back. In 1985, with Charles Gavin replacing André Jung on drums (the latter going on to Ira!), their second album, Televisão, produced by Lulu Santos, was released with tighter arrangements than their debut album. Not only was the title track a great hit, the album was more heavily promoted than the first one and brought more opportunities to the group. Still, it sold below expectations. = 1985-1989: Into the spotlight = In November 1985, Tony Bellotto and Arnaldo Antunes were arrested for heroin traffic and transportation. It is considered by the band as the climax of their first crisis, started with the first two albums low sales. Also, the episode made so much of an impact in the band that the next album, Cabeça Dinossauro, released in June 1986, contained a lot of tracks criticizing public institutions (\\"Estado Violência\\" and \\"Polícia\\"), as well as other \\"pillars\\" of the Brazilian society and indeed society in general (\\"Igreja\\" and \\"Família\\"). The heavy and punk-influenced rhythms and the forceful lyrics, characteristic of the band in this phase, are fully represented in this album which is considered by the critics one of the best works of the group and one of the landmarks of the Brazilian rock. Jesus não Tem Dentes no País dos Banguelas, released in the end of 1987, continued in the same vein as the previous album in tracks like \\"Nome aos Bois\\", \\"Lugar Nenhum\\" and \\"Desordem\\", however adding samplers in tracks like \\"Corações e Mentes\\", \\"Todo Mundo quer Amor\\", \\"Comida\\" and \\"Diversão\\". After some international performances, the band recorded some of their hits in live Montreux Festival and released Go Back in 1988. The biggest hit to come out of Go Back was a live version of the song \\"Marvin\\" which is a re-invented version of \\"Patches\\" by Clarence Carter made famous by Elvis. Still in 1988, they guest performed on the song \\"Tempo\\" (written by Antunes and Miklos) of Sandra de Sá's 1988 self-titled album. The producer Liminha (a former adjunct member of Os Mutantes) was always an important associate of the band since Cabeça Dinossauro, and this association arrived to its climax in Õ Blésq Blom (1989), one of the most popular productions of the band by that time. Some of the prominence tracks: \\"Miséria\\", \\"Flores\\", \\"O Pulso\\" and \\"32 Dentes\\". One of the prominent features of this work was the special guest appearance of a couple of improvisors, called Mauro and Quitéria, discovered by the band at a beach in Recife. = 1990-1995: Antunes' departure and Jack Endino era = The band had arrived to a decisive point in its history and the next album, Tudo ao Mesmo Tempo Agora marks a strong yaw at the musicians' style, searching for heavier, alternative and authorial sound, along with scatological lyrics. The members themselves produced the album. Unhappy with the new direction taken by the band, Antunes left for a solo career, although he would continue to write occasional songs with them. The following album, Titanomaquia, in 1993, continued the previous work in a way, with heavy instrumentation and aggressive lyrics, only now produced by Jack Endino, producer of important bands like Nirvana, which contributed for the grunge-influenced sound. In 1995 the band decided to take a break for one year during which many of its members decided to work solo. Miklos and Reis released their debut solo efforts, Paulo Miklos and 12 de Janeiro, respectively; Britto and Mello formed Kleiderman; and Bellotto wrote his first book, Bellini e a Esfinge. The band released Domingo in the end of 1995, again with production by Endino. = 1997-1999: Acoustic and tribute efforts = Titãs, as depicted in their MTV Unplugged album. Standing, from left to right: Marcello Fromer, Paulo Miklos, Branco Mello and Nando Reis. Sitting, from left to right: Sergio Britto, Charles Gavin and Tony Bellotto. The band's commercial peak was reached once they released the commemorative work Acústico MTV (MTV Unplugged), their most successful album to date, released in 1997, which sold 1,7 million copies. Recorded Live, Acústico MTV not only revisited their career up to that point but it also had a song which became an immediate hit named \\"Pra dizer Adeus\\" (originally from Televisão). It also had a number of guest performers, including former member Arnaldo Antunes. This record was followed by Volume Dois (1998), modeled in the same way of their unplugged album, only recorded in studio; and cover album As Dez Mais (1999), which didn't sell well and was panned by critics, despite \\"Aluga-se\\" and \\"Pelados em Santos\\" becoming hits. Also in 1999, the band embarked on a collaborative tour with Os Paralamas do Sucesso, another successful Brazilian rock band, and a live, collaborative record followed: Titãs & Paralamas Juntos ao Vivo. = 2001-2009: Fromer's death, Reis' departure, documentary and Latin Grammy = On 11 June 2001 Marcelo Fromer was rammed by a motorcycle in São Paulo and died two days later of Brain death. It was a hard stroke to the band, which started recording their new album the day after. A Melhor Banda de Todos os Tempos da Última Semana was released at the end of 2001 and brought \\"Epitáfio\\" as the prominence song and the title track as the first single. Regarding the death of Marcelo, this statement was published on June 20, 2001 at Titãs official site: In the following year, the band saw the departure of vocalist and bassist Nando Reis, who has since lead a successful solo career (including songs penned for other artists) fronting his own band Nando Reis e os Infernais. He announced his parting on 9 September 9, 2002, giving \\"thought incompatibility\\" as a reason and also saying Fromer's and his close friend Cássia Eller's deaths left him very upset: In a 2012 interview, he would say he didn't feel ready for the studio following his friends' deaths and three consecutive, exhausting tours. The band hired the bass guitarist Lee Marcucci (from Rádio Táxi) to play in their first album without Reis, Como Estão Vocês? (How Are You?). With self-help hits as \\"Enquanto Houver Sol\\", questions on relevance remain on Titãs' side, which faced declining sales and the ageing of their fanbase. In 2005, they released another MTV-branded album, only this time in a non-acoustic live performance. This album generated a new hit for the group, called \\"Vossa Excelência\\", that basically criticizes the hypocrisy and lack of care from politicians, thus bringing the band back to its roots. Titãs performing live in Foz do Iguaçu, Paraná, in 2006 On February 18, 2006, Titãs opened the Rolling Stones free concert at Copacabana beach, Rio de Janeiro for an audience of some 1.5 million people. In 2007, the band started a tour, entitled 25 Anos de Rock (25 Years of Rock), again joining Os Paralamas do Sucesso to celebrate the 25th anniversary of both bands, as well as the 25th anniversary of the rising of 1980s Brazilian rock bands. The two line-ups played together most of the time on the shows, presenting also some invited musicians, like Arnaldo Antunes, Andreas Kisser and Dado Villa-Lobos. The concert in Rio de Janeiro, which took place at January 26, 2008, was recorded and filmed. The resulting collaborative CD and DVD were released five months after, titled Paralamas e Titãs Juntos e Ao Vivo . The band released a documentary of the 25 years of their career. The documentary features 90 minutes of images collected since the beginning of the band, including recording of albums, live performances, and more. It is titled Titãs - A Vida Até Parece Uma Festa. For most of 2008 and early 2009, the band recorded their 13th studio album, the Latin Grammy-winner Sacos Plásticos. The album was released on June 3, 2009, through Arsenal Music. The producer, Rick Bonadio, had already worked with artists such as Fresno and NX Zero. The first single from the album was \\"Antes de Você\\" (\\"Before You\\"), and it received radio airplay on May 7. It was featured at the Caras & Bocas (current 19pm Rede Globo telenovela) soundtrack. The second single was \\"Porque Eu Sei que É Amor\\" (Because I Know It's Love) which was featured in Cama de Gato (a Brazilian telenovela that also features the song \\"Pelo Avesso\\" as opening theme, from their 2003 album Como Estão Vocês?) and reached #16 at Brasil Hot 100 Airplay Brasil Hot 100 Airplay In an interview to Jornal da Tarde, and regarding the music of the new album, Bonadio stated: = 2010-2016: Gavin's departure, 30th birthday, Nheengatu = Titãs live in 2012 as a quartet + session drummer Mário Fabre. On February 12, 2010, Titãs announced in their official website that drummer Charles Gavin would leave the band for personal reasons. Gavin later stated that he was physically and mentally exhausted because of the tours and album releases. The quartet continued their performances of the Sacos Plásticos tour with drummer Mario Fabre, who has remained with the band since then as a session member. Fabre was suggested by Gavin himself. When asked about the status of Fabre in the band, Bellotto explained that \\"he is the official drummer! He's the drummer of Titãs! But he isn't one of Titãs, because our history began long ago, at Greek mythology... \\" During an interview, keyboardist Sérgio Britto said the band was planning to start recording a new album in 2011. Nothing else was said since then, until March 2013, when they revealed they were starting to work on a new album, to be released in the second half of 2013. The album would be self-produced, and, according to Britto, it would be \\"a mixture between Cabeça Dinossauro and Õ Blésq Blom\\". In January 2012, the band announced a live performance in company of ex-members Arnaldo Antunes, Nando Reis and Charles Gavin. The show would celebrate the 30-year career of the band, and would include guest performances of other friends of the band, and there were plans for a DVD release. According to Miklos: The reunion took place on October 6, 2012, in São Paulo. For the first time since 1997's Acústico MTV, the seven original members of the band reunited for a one-night performance. According to Bellotto: The band gathered in Reis' house to discuss the reunion - it was the first time since Fromer's death that all seven members met. Titãs as of 2013. From left to right: Tony Bellotto, Paulo Miklos, Branco Mello, and Sergio Britto. In 2013, Titãs performed new songs live, part of their Titãs Inédito (Titãs Unseen) tour. They were planning to begin work on a new album in April or May 2014. Miklos said the album was likely to be \\"heavy, dirty and mean\\". Later, Britto confirmed that the album would be released in early May and that the band was already recording songs for it, but it was yet to be titled. In March, radio Globo FM announced that the album would be actually released in April and would feature 14 tracks. On April 16, the band announced that the album was ready and would be really released in May, via Som Livre records. On April 28, they announced the title, cover and release date for the album, which is called Nheengatu and was released on 12 May. In August 2015, they released Nheengatu ao Vivo, a live album and DVD with songs from their Nheengatu Tour. In February 2016, they opened a Rolling Stones Brazilian show for a second and third time, this time at the Morumbi Stadium in São Paulo, on two different dates. = 2016-2018: Miklos' departure and rock opera = On 11 July 2016, vocalist, guitarist and founding member Paulo Miklos announced he would leave the band to focus on his personal projects. He was then replaced by session member Beto Lee, son of Brazilian notorious rock singer Rita Lee. His first recording with the band is a version of \\"Pro Dia Nascer Feliz\\", originally by Barão Vermelho, for the soundtrack of the 24th season of Malhação, a Rede Globo series. With Lee's inclusion, the band recovered some old songs for its live setlists, including Titanomaquia's \\"Será Que É Disso Que Eu Necessito?\\" and \\"Nem Sempre se Pode Ser Deus\\". They also started to have Bellotto sing in some songs. Also in 2016, the band announced a new album for a possible 2017 release. According to Bellotto, it would be a rock opera, and the band intended to enter the studio until mid-2017 so the album could be released in the year's second half. Drawing inspiration from albums such as The Who's Quadrophenia and Green Day's American Idiot, the over 30-track rock opera would have its story written by Hugo Possolo and Marcelo Rubens Paiva. By April 2017, Mello said a handful of tracks were ready. Also in April, the band started a tour called \\"Uma Noite no Teatro\\" (A Night at the Theater) with a show that was also the inaugurating event of Shopping Villa-Lobos' theater Opus. The tour included three new songs: \\"Me Estuprem\\" (Rape Me), about sexual harassment and rape; \\"12 Flores Amarelas\\" (12 Yellow Flowers); and \\"A Festa\\" (The Party). By that time, none of them were expected to be featured in the band's new album. On 23 September, however, the band performed them again during their show at the Rock in Rio 7, and this time they were announced as part of the new project. In December 2017, they announced that they had already started recording the album and that it would be released via Universal Music. On January 31, they announced that the opera rock would be released in early 2018 and that its title would be Doze Flores Amarelas. In May 2018, after the Doze Flores Amarelas DVD had been recorded, Mello was diagnosed with a tumor in his larynx, which forced him to step down from the band activities for three months. Lee Marcucci, who worked for the band as a session musician from 2002 to 2009, stepped in to replace him. = 2018-present: Trio Acústico and return to BMG = In 2017, their MTV Unplugged celebrated its 20th anniversary and fans requested the band to do something special for the occasion, but they were at the time focusing on the rock opera, which involved a complex and sophisticated tour. Since Brazil's economy wasn't going through a favorable time and fans kept on requesting the celebration, the band started in 2019 a series of acoustic performances in which they mixed songs from the 1997 album, more recent works and older songs that hadn't been picked for Unplugged. The tour was named \\"Trio Acústico\\" (Acoustic Trio). The first performance took place in Paulínia on 23 February, and the tour became a priority for the band, who conciliated it with the Doze Flores Amarelas promotional tour and a third tour called \\"Enquanto Houver Sol\\", this one in an electric format and involving songs from many eras of the group. The preference for Trio Acústico is due to the simplicity of the performances. Otávio Juliano, who directs the rock opera, is also responsible for this tour. The tour's idea is to pay tribute to the album without copying it. Each show is divided into three parts: one with all three remaining original members; one in which each of them performs solo, and one with the trio performing with the two session members, Fabre and Lee. Usually, Bellotto sings \\"Polícia\\" and \\"Querem Meu Sangue\\"; Mello performs \\"Cabeça Dinossauro\\", \\"Tô Cansado\\" and \\"Toda Cor\\" alone on his acoustic guitar; and Britto plays \\"Miséria\\" and \\"Nem Cinco Minutos [Guardados]\\" (the latter on the piano, despite the song having been written on the acoustic guitar). During the shows, the members tell the story behind each song. This format was inspired by Springsteen on Broadway. In 2020, the band announced it had recorded a studio version of the project and that it would be released as three EPs, with a total of 25 songs. The first release was expected for March. A re-recording of \\"Sonífera Ilha\\" was released as a single and video on 20 March, when it was also announced that the EPs would be released starting in April via BMG, the label to which then returned by the end of 2019. On May 5, 2020, original founding member Ciro Pessoa died following complications from a cancer and COVID-19.

Early life  Six-foot-two and weighing 220 pounds, Jones is a cousin of Hall of Fame receiver Charley Taylor of the Washington Redskins and Browns' defensive end Joe Jones. Jones attended Texas Southern College (now Texas Southern University), a historically black college, and starred in track and field as well as football, running the 100-yard and 220-yard dashes. He was drafted in 1963 by his hometown team, the Houston Oilers of the American Football League, but suffered a knee injury in training camp and was cut.  New York Giants and the \\"spike\\" The New York Giants offered Jones a bus ticket to New York and payment for knee surgery. Known as \\"Rhino\\" to his teammates, Jones wore uniform number 45 in New York. Having seen players such as Giants teammate Frank Gifford and Green Bay Packers star Paul Hornung celebrate touchdowns by throwing the ball to fans in the stands, Jones decided to come up with his own post-touchdown maneuver. In a 1965 game, after scoring a touchdown, he threw the football down hard in the end zone. He called the move a \\"spike\\"; modern post-touchdown celebrations, including \\"touchdown dances\\", are said to have came from Jones' invention. Contributing to his choice of action was a new rule for 1965 which would fine a player $500 if he threw a ball into the stands. Jones said the fine occurred to him, so he decided to throw the ball on the ground instead. In 1967, Jones had his best season, catching 49 passes for 1,209 yards, an average of 24.7 yards per catch, and 13 touchdowns, leading the NFL in receiving touchdowns. He was second in the league in combined rushing and receiving yards from scrimmage, behind Leroy Kelly of the Browns. He made the NFL's Pro Bowl that season and the next.  Later career and retirement  In January 1970, Jones was traded to the Browns in exchange for running back Ron Johnson and veteran defensive lineman Jim Kanicki. The Browns were in the market for a new wide receiver after having traded all-pro Paul Warfield to the Miami Dolphins. In the team's first game of the 1970 NFL season on September 21, 1970 Cleveland Municipal Stadium, Jones returned the second-half kickoff against the New York Jets for a touchdown, a key play in the Browns' 31-21 win over the Jets in front of 85,703 fans. The crowd, officially the largest crowd in Browns' history, was a part of NFL history that evening in the first game ever played on ABC's Monday Night Football. However, that touchdown would be the highlight of his one season with the Browns as knee injuries soon caught up with Jones. Soon after being traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in July 1971, he was forced to retire at age 29.  Career statistics  Jones finished his career with 224 receptions for 4,986 yards, an average of 22.3 yards per catch, and 38 touchdowns (36 receiving, one rushing, one kick return). His yard per catch ranks number one for all NFL players in a career with at least 200 receptions.

The garnet measures 3 cm. Location: Paraíba, Brazil. Dark-coloured porphyroblasts of garnet in mica schist at Syros, Greece. A porphyroblast is a large mineral crystal in a metamorphic rock which has grown within the finer grained matrix. Porphyroblasts are commonly euhedral crystals, but can also be partly to completely irregular in shape. The most common porphyroblasts in metapelites (metamorphosed mudstones and siltstones) are garnets and staurolites, which stand out in well-foliated metapelites (such as schists) against the platy mica matrix. A similar type of crystal is a phenocryst, a large crystal in an igneous rock. Porphyroblasts are often confused with porphyroclasts, which can also be large outstanding crystals, but which are older than the matrix of the rock. If a porphyroblastic mineral has small inclusions of minerals within it, the mineral is described as poikiloblastic. This observation can help interpret deformation history. A rock which has many porphyroblasts is described as having a porphyroblastic texture. As porphyroblasts grow, the foliation may be preserved as oriented inclusions trapped by the porphyroblast as it overgrows them, and this is helpful for tracking changing deformation planes. In metamorphic rocks that experience deformation during metamorphism, porphyroblasts may grow before, during, or after the phase of deformation recorded by the matrix minerals. The relationship of porphyroblast growth to deformation is typically evaluated by comparing the shape orientation of trails of mineral inclusions in the porphyroblast to the matrix fabric. Thin section of garnet mica schist from Salangen, Norway. A garnet porphyroblast (black) contains curved trails of small inclusions (white and grey). Some garnet porphyroblasts contain curving trails of quartz and other mineral inclusions that record rotation of the crystals relative to their surroundings. However, the question of how much porphyroblasts actually rotate in an external reference frame fixed to the Earth's surface during metamorphism and deformation has long been the subject of debate. The question focused on so-called \\"spiral garnets\\", also known as \\"snowball garnets\\", whose inclusion trails define spiral patterns. These microstructures are interpreted classically as having formed by shearing induced rotation of a growing garnet crystal. Later research, however, led to an alternative formation model in which a porphyroblast grows over a developing microfold while maintaining a stable position in the external reference frame. Repetition of this process can then produce complex spiral-shaped patterns. Although many researchers continue to adopt the classic rotational model, most researchers who have published research testing both models by measuring the orientations of porphyroblasts have come to support the modern interpretation.

Watsonias are native to southern Africa (South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland).Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families The genus is named after Sir William Watson, an 18th-century British botanist. Diversity There are 56 accepted species in southern Africa, with two varieties and about 112 names either unresolved or regarded as synonyms.The Plant List (2010). Version 1. Published on the Internet; (accessed 1 September 2012) All are perennial herbs growing from corms and producing erect spikes of showy flowers. Most are fynbos plants, adapted to a Mediterranean-type climate, but some occur along the eastern and inland areas of the country and adapted to a wider range of conditions, mainly continental climate with summer rainfall. Many species occur mainly in the mountains, though some occur in sandy flats and marshy areas. Cultivation The most commonly cultivated species is the pink-flowered Watsonia borbonica and its white mutant 'Arderne's White'. These were crossed with Watsonia meriana and other species in the early 20th century by breeders including John Cronin in Australia and Luther Burbank in California to produce a wide range of cultivars. Watsonia has been eclipsed in popularity by Gladiolus and other bulbs, and is now neglected by the nursery industry. Distribution Native to South Africa, Watsonia species were introduced as garden ornamentals to Australia in the mid-19th century and were widely grown by the 1940s. In the South-West of Western Australia, six species have become naturalised from garden escapes along rivers, wetlands and seasonally wet ground. In places Watsonia spp. have displaced native understorey flora; concentrations of them create a fire hazard in summer.Environmental Weeds Action Network (Western Australia) Watsonia meriana var. bulbillifera is also a weed in New Zealand, Réunion and Mauritius.

Fiamme are lens-shapes, usually millimetres to centimetres in size, seen on surfaces of some volcaniclastic rocks. They can occur in welded pyroclastic fall deposits and in ignimbrites, which are the deposits of pumiceous pyroclastic density currents. The name fiamme comes from the Italian word for flames, describing their shape. The term is descriptive and non- genetic. Fiamme are most typical of welded lapilli-tuffs and are commonly found in association with eutaxitic textures, best seen under the microscope. Some fiamme represent fragments of volcanic ejecta, often pumice lapilli that have been flattened by compaction and/or shear. Some fiamme are formed from flattened hot, relatively low viscosity, high porosity fragments of volcanic glass or pumice. But this is not the only way they can form: they can also form when pumice lapilli are altered to clay and compact during diagenesis; and fiamme are also widely reported in viscous lavas (andesites to rhyolites) where they form by shear-induced autobrecciation of pumiceous or obsidian zones, followed by shear and annealing of the fragments.

It is particularly prevalent in the broadcasting of sports events, although other television or radio programs may be blacked out as well. Most blackout policies serve to protect local broadcasters (primarily regional sports networks) from competition by \\"out-of- market\\" networks that carry different teams, by only allowing viewers to watch non-national telecasts of teams within their designated markets (with television providers blacking out regional telecasts of teams that are outside their market; in turn, encouraging viewers to purchase subscription-based out- of-market sports packages), and by allowing teams to black out national telecasts of games that are also being shown by a local broadcaster. By contrast, the blackout policies of the National Football League serve to encourage attendance to games instead—by only allowing them to be broadcast on television in a team's designated market if a certain percentage of their tickets are sold prior to the game. Similarly, there is a blanket blackout on all telecasts of association football (soccer) in the United Kingdom between 2:45 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. on Saturday matchdays. The term is also used in relation to situations where programming is removed or replaced on international feeds of a television service, because the broadcaster does not hold the territorial rights to air the programs outside of their home country. Canada =Federal elections= Perhaps the most notable non-sports-related blackout in television was the blackout of Canadian federal election coverage. Because there are six time zones across Canada, polls close in different parts of the country at different times. Section 329 of the Canada Elections Act outlawed disseminating election results from other ridings in constituencies where polls were still open, ostensibly to prevent the results from the East from influencing voters in western ridings However, in the federal election in 2000, Paul Charles Bryan published results from Atlantic Canada online despite being told not to by the authorities. Bryan was charged before the Provincial Court of British Columbia, but fought the charges as unconstitutional under section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects freedom of expression and freedom of association. Bryan's victory before the British Columbia Supreme Court meant that voters in British Columbia and the rest of Canada legally learned of election results in other ridings during the federal election in 2004. However, Elections Canada appealed, and Bryan lost his case before the British Columbia Court of Appeal. Bryan further appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, but in a ruling made on March 15, 2007 (R. v. Bryan), in a 5-4 ruling, the Court ruled that Section 329 of the Canada Elections Act is constitutional and justified under section 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Stephen Harper, who later became Prime Minister, labelled Elections Canada \\"jackasses\\" and tried to raise money for Bryan. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation also supported Bryan, hoping to \\"make election night a bigger event that it already is\\". Before the 2000 election, Elections Canada moved to reduce the effects of the blackout and the influence of unauthorized knowledge of election results in Western ridings by altering the times that polls close, so that polls no longer close at the same local time throughout the country. Polls in Atlantic Canada close at 9 p.m. Atlantic (9:30 in Newfoundland), polls from Alberta to Quebec close an hour later (9 p.m. Eastern, 8 p.m. Central and 7 p.m. Mountain) and finally, polls in British Columbia close an hour after that (7 p.m. Pacific). Historically, the results of the election are often not decisively known until more than an hour after polls close in the Eastern Time Zone, but are usually known within two hours of these polls closing. Provincial elections are not subject to blackout restrictions – in provinces that have two time zones, the vast majority of the population lives in one time zone or the other. Election laws in these provinces stipulate that all polls are to close at the same time – this time invariably being 8:00 p.m. (or 9:00 p.m. in Ontario beginning with the 2007 provincial election) in the time zone of the majority. On August 17, 2011, Elections Canada Chief Electoral Officer Marc Mayrand suggested improvements of the voting system to Parliament; among them were a proposal to remove the blackout rule, citing the expanded use of social media to disseminate results outside radio and television. Mayrand stated that \\"the growing use of social media puts in question not only the practical enforceability of the rule, but also its very intelligibility and usefulness in a world where the distinction between private communication and public transmission is quickly eroding. The time has come for Parliament to consider revoking the current rule.\\" On January 13, 2012, it was announced that the federal government would introduce legislation that would repeal the blackout rule, citing the increased use of social media. The blackout rule was officially repealed in October 2015, prior to the 2015 Canadian federal election. =CFL= The Canadian Football League's constitution does provide the option for teams to black out games in their home markets in order to encourage attendance; at one point, the CFL required games to be blacked out within a radius of around the closest over-the-air signal carrying the game, or of the stadium for cable broadcasts (and, for the Saskatchewan Roughriders, the entirety of the province). The policy received significant criticism in 2002 when the Hamilton Tiger-Cats enforced a blackout on a game against the Toronto Argonauts that had playoff implications; the range of the blackout was considered too wide for the market. Under the league's 2008–2013 contract with TSN, teams were given a cap on the number of blackouts they could impose per- season (with the number varying by media and CFL reports, ranging from 2 for Hamilton and Toronto, and 5 for teams in Western Canada), and final decisions were assigned to the league if at least 90% of tickets were sold out within 48 hours of the game. Although the CFL stated that the league's current contract with TSN (which began in 2014) does allow for blackouts, they have been seldom-used, if not at all. =NHL= Rogers Sportsnet broadcast regions. Map of TSN's regional feeds As in the U.S., National Hockey League games that are not scheduled as national telecasts by Sportsnet or TVA Sports are broadcast by regional feeds of either Sportsnet, TSN, or RDS (French), and are blacked out for viewers outside the team's home market. Sportsnet's four regional feeds correspond with each of its NHL teams' designated markets; the Ontario and Pacific feeds are designated to the Toronto Maple Leafs, and Vancouver Canucks respectively, while Sportsnet West and its corresponding market (which includes all of Alberta and Saskatchewan) is shared by the Edmonton Oilers and Calgary Flames. Although West is also the main feed for Manitoba, Flames and Oilers games are blacked out there to protect the Winnipeg Jets. As of August 2014, TSN is similarly structured, with the Ottawa Senators on TSN5 (East), Maple Leafs on TSN4 (Ontario), and Jets on TSN3 (Manitoba and Saskatchewan). The Montreal Canadiens were added in 2017 on TSN2 (which was originally promoted as being a secondary national channel). The Canadiens and Senators share the same market, which includes parts of Eastern Ontario (primarily the Ottawa Valley), and the entirety of Quebec and Atlantic Canada, while Saskatchewan is shared by the Jets, Flames, and Oilers. Until the 2014–15 season, all French-language broadcasts of the Montreal Canadiens were available nationally on RDS, which was previously the national French-language rightsholder of the NHL in Canada. As RDS was, until 2011, the only French- language cable sports channel in Canada, the team forwent a separate regional rights deal and allowed all of its games to be broadcast as part of the national package. As of the 2014–15 season, Quebecor Media and TVA Sports is the national French rightsholder as part of a sub-licensing agreement with Rogers Communications. RDS negotiated a 12-year deal with the team for regional rights to the Canadiens: games are now blacked out for viewers outside Quebec, Atlantic Canada, and parts of Eastern Ontario. Out-of-market games can be viewed using the subscription-based NHL Centre Ice, NHL Live, and Sportsnet Now+ (which carries out-of-market games whose rights are held by Sportsnet channels) although in-market games are blacked out from Centre Ice and NHL Live to protect local broadcasters. NHL Live allows streaming of in- market teams if the user authenticates themselves as a subscriber to Sportsnet and/or TSN, while Sportsnet Now+ is a direct-to-consumer version of the Sportsnet channels themselves. =Internet television= Many programs carried on Internet television in other parts of the world are not available in Canada because the major broadcast networks in Canada secure the rights to them and prevent Internet television aggregators, one notable example being Hulu, from distributing them in Canada. The National Football League, for example, sold worldwide Internet broadcast rights to a package of its Thursday Night Football games during the 2016 season to Twitter; however, Rogers Media forced Twitter to block the streams in Canada by virtue of its holding of terrestrial television rights in the country. Numerous organizations have attempted to establish workarounds that route Canadians' Internet traffic through the United States, workarounds that local broadcasters have opposed, with one, Bell Media, calling such practices \\"stealing\\",Evans, Pete (June 5, 2015).

CBC. Retrieved October 26, 2016.  India  Indian law requires all sporting events of \\"national importance\\", whose broadcast rights are owned by a pay television service, to be simulcast by the state broadcaster Doordarshan (DD) on its DD National TV channel. Tata Sky (which, at the time of the lawsuit, was partly owned by 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Star India which owns the Star Sports networks) filed a lawsuit over the rule, arguing that these simulcasts devalued the exclusive broadcast rights because DD National is a must-carry channel. In 2017, the Supreme Court of India ruled that pay television services must black out DD National when it is airing such events in order to protect the pay TV broadcaster, restricting availability of DD's simulcasts of such events to terrestrial television and DD Free Dish.  United Kingdom  = Association football = UEFA Article 48.2 and the major association football leagues of the United Kingdom enforce a blackout on all television broadcasts of football between 2:45 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. on Saturday matchdays. This applies to all matches, regardless of whether they are a domestic or international competition. A match which kicks off within the window may be joined in progress after the blackout window ends. This policy is ostensibly intended to encourage fans to attend football matches in-person, especially in lower divisions (whose attendance may be cannibalized by the availability of competing top-flight matches on television). The practice originated in the 1960s; Burnley F.C. chairman Bob Lord was opposed to television broadcasts of football matches—going as far as banning the BBC from televising Match of the Day from Turf Moor for a time. He pushed the Football League to adopt this stance as an organization-wide policy; it has since been adopted by The Football Association and the current Premier League, which broke away from the Football League in 1992 to become the highest level of club football in England. Affected matches can still be broadcast internationally, hence more Premier League matches can be shown outside the United Kingdom by other rightsholders than within. This intricacy created a \\"grey market\\" for obtaining the broadcasts from alternative sources, such as foreign satellite providers or unofficial online streaming services. The Premier League and other stakeholders have historically considered this practice to be a violation of the copyright of the broadcasts. In 2014, for taking inadequate steps to prevent unauthorized retransmissions from its streaming broadcasts online, the Premier League briefly restricted MENA region rightsholder beIN Sports to one 3 p.m. match per week on television only. Critics, including Advocate General at the Court of Justice of the European Union Juliane Kokott, have argued that 3 p.m. blackouts are outdated, as its purpose is hindered—especially within the Premier League—by the high demand for the few tickets available to the public, and that there was little evidence that television broadcasts actually affected attendance. To preserve the value of its domestic broadcast rights and allow more games to be televised, the Premier League has added more matches in windows outside of Saturday afternoons, such as weekdays and Sundays—including the final matchday of the season. In 2018, after complying by blacking out the first 15 minutes of a Serie A match that saw Cristiano Ronaldo's on-field debut for Juventus F.C., streaming service Eleven Sports UK & Ireland began to defy the ban and show selected Serie A and La Liga matches during this period. On 17 October 2018, Eleven announced that it would cease its telecasts of 3:00 p.m. kickoffs, but argued that the rule was outdated because only the UK and Montenegro have such blackout rules, and that the blackout period encourages illegal streaming. A representative of La Liga has backed Eleven Sports' position. In April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, UEFA authorised the suspension of the blackout rule for the remainder of the season. Upon the resumption of the 2019–20 Premier League, all matches were shown on domestic television due to them being played behind closed doors, while a number of free-to-air broadcasts (via Sky Sports sister channel Pick, Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, and the BBC—which usually holds rights to free-to-air highlights programmes) were also aired. This arrangement continued into the first month of the 2020–21 Premier League. United States =MLB/NHL blackout policies= Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League have very similar blackout rules. Unlike the National Football League, the blackout of games has nothing to do with attendance, but instead is implemented to protect broadcasters with contracts to air games. Unless a national broadcaster such as Fox or ESPN has exclusive rights to a certain regular season game (as they do on Sunday nights), the local broadcaster of a game (such as a Fox Sports regional network for example) has priority over a national broadcaster—so if Fox Sports 1, MLB Network, or TBS is airing a game that is also being aired by the local broadcaster, the national feed would be blacked out in markets where a local broadcaster is also showing coverage. The blackout rules do not apply during the postseason, as Fox and TBS hold exclusive rights to all games, and there are no regional television broadcasts. As of the 2014 MLB season, ESPN's coverage of Monday and Wednesday night games is allowed to co-exist with that of a regional broadcaster, and thus no longer has to be blacked out in the participating teams' markets. The NHL utilizes a similar policy of exclusive and non-exclusive national games; NBCSN has an exclusive national window on Wednesday nights (Wednesday Night Hockey), and the NBC broadcast network typically shows a Sunday-afternoon game of the week during the later portion of the season, along with other marquee games such as the Thanksgiving Showdown (held on the Friday after Thanksgiving) and the NHL Winter Classic and Stadium Series outdoor games. Typically, no other games involving U.S. teams are scheduled to occur at the same time. NHL Network and NBCSN typically broadcast non-exclusive national games outside these windows which are blacked out in the participating teams' markets to protect local broadcasts. All games in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, outside those designated for exclusive broadcast by NBC, are non-exclusive national games. Since 2017, they may now co-exist with national broadcasts on NBCUniversal cable channels and NHL Network, except in some areas that have an NBCUniversal-owned regional sports network. Out-of-market games can be viewed using the subscription-based MLB Extra Innings, MLB.tv, NHL Center Ice, and NHL.tv services, although in- market games are blacked out from all four services to protect local broadcasters, and they do not offer nationally televised games. Radio blackouts In Major League Baseball, there are no radio blackouts. However, for many years, the radio networks of the two participating ballclubs in the World Series were not allowed to air games, forcing flagship stations, if they wanted to broadcast the Series, to simulcast the network broadcast. As an example, while Boston Red Sox radio flagship WHDH and St. Louis Cardinals flagship station KMOX both broadcast the 1967 World Series, both stations had to simulcast the NBC Radio Network broadcast along with Boston's WCOP and St. Louis's KSD, the nominal NBC Radio affiliates in those cities. This changed after 1980, as fans of the Philadelphia Phillies were angry that they could not hear their popular broadcasting team of Harry Kalas and Richie Ashburn call the team's run to the title. Since then, only the flagship stations of the two participating ballclubs can originate coverage, though their broadcasts, as well as the national English and Spanish broadcasts, are also available on Sirius XM. Flagship stations are required to make mention of the presenting sponsor of the national ESPN Radio broadcasts as also sponsoring the team's own broadcasts during the World Series (as of 2016 this is AutoZone). All other network affiliates of the two clubs must carry the feed from MLB's national partner (currently ESPN Radio). If another ESPN Radio affiliate exists in the same market, that station can claim exclusivity, forcing a blackout of the team network affiliate from carrying the game, though this is rarely done as listener pushback against the ESPN Radio affiliate blocking the local play-by-play would likely be untenable (for instance in 2016, ESPN Radio O&O; WMVP in Chicago broadcast the national ESPN feed as expected, but made no move to block the official Cubs broadcaster WSCR from carrying local play-by-play, to the point of only mentioning the national coverage existed on their station through promos in national ESPN Radio programming). Additionally, radio stations (including flagships) may not include MLB games in the live Internet streams of their station programming. MLB itself offers radio feeds as a pay service via the league and team websites, along with being a part of the monthly premium fee service from streaming provider TuneIn. Some stations will simply stream the station's regularly scheduled programming that is being pre-empted by the game. The NHL has no radio blackouts for local broadcasts, although NBC Sports Radio broadcasts are, similarly to some cable broadcasts, not carried within the local markets of participating teams. =NBA blackout policy= Prior to the 1998-99 NBA lockout, the NBA and the WNBA used to black out nationally televised games on cable television within of the home team's market; however, these are now restricted to games on NBA TV, WatchESPN and other streaming providers. =NFL blackout policy= The NFL has engaged in various blackout policies to protect both local ticket sales, and local rightsholders of specific games.  Blackouts based on attendance  In the NFL, any broadcaster that has a signal that hits any area within a radius of an NFL stadium may only broadcast a game if that game is a road game (also known as an away game), or if the game sells out 72 hours or more before the start time for the game. If sold out in less than 72 hours, or is close to being sold out by the deadline, the team can sometimes request a time extension. Furthermore, broadcasters with NFL contracts are required to show their markets' road games, even if the secondary markets have substantial fanbases for other teams (like in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, officially a Baltimore Ravens secondary market, but home to many Pittsburgh Steelers fans). Sometimes if a game is within a few hundred tickets of selling out, a broadcaster with rights to show the nearly sold-out game will buy the remaining tickets (and give them to local charities) so it can broadcast the game. Other teams elect to close off sections of their stadium, but cannot sell these tickets for any game that season if they choose to do so. As a result, if the home team's game is a Sunday day game, both networks can air only one game each in that market (until 2000, this rule applied whether or not the game was blacked out; however, this was changed because some markets virtually never aired doubleheaders as a result). Usually, but not always, when each network can show only one game each in a market, the two stations work out between themselves which will show an early game and which will show a late game. This only affects the primary market, and not markets in a radius, which always get a doubleheader each Sunday. For the NFL International Series, the network broadcasting an International Series game will not have the game blacked out for the team's markets as the game is played outside of the United States; however, some blackout regulations do apply. There have been two exceptions to the rule, of which one has never been implemented and the other no longer applies. The first is for the Green Bay Packers, which have two overlapping 75-mile blackout zones – one surrounding the team's stadium in Green Bay and another surrounding Milwaukee. The team's radio flagship station is in Milwaukee, and the Packers played part of their home schedule in Milwaukee from 1953 through 1994. However, this policy has never been implemented in the Packers' case, as they have sold out every home game in Green Bay since 1960 and have a decades-long season-ticket waiting list (games in Milwaukee also sold out during this period). The second exception was for the Bills Toronto Series; by a technicality, Rogers Communications (the team's lessee) owned all tickets to those games and resold them to potential fans. Even when Rogers failed to sell all of the tickets, they were still technically defined to be sellouts by the league since Rogers was said to have \\"bought\\" the tickets. The technicality came into play for both Toronto Series preseason games, and again for the last two regular season games of the series. The Bills Toronto Series was cancelled after the 2013 season, largely due to the aforementioned lackluster attendance. In June 2012, NFL blackout regulations were revised in which, for the first time in NFL history, home games would no longer require a total sellout to be televised locally; instead, teams would be allowed to set a benchmark anywhere from 85 to 100 percent of the stadium's non-premium seats. Any seats sold beyond that benchmark will be subject to heavier revenue sharing.Report: NFL team owners get more flexibility on blackouts. The Buffalo News. Retrieved June 30, 2012. However, four teams, the Buffalo Bills, the Cleveland Browns, the Indianapolis Colts and the San Diego Chargers, opted out of the new rules, as it would require the teams to pay a higher percentage of gate fees to the NFL's revenue fund. In the 2015 NFL season, the league, after no games were blacked out at all in the 2014 season, voted to \\"suspend\\" the blackout policy as an experiment. The suspension continued into the 2016 season (a season that included the return of the Rams to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as an interim home until the completion of SoFi Stadium; the Coliseum has had long-standing issues with NFL sell-outs); commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the league needed to further investigate the impact of removing the blackout rules before such a change is made permanent. The suspension quietly continued into the 2017 NFL season as well, which saw the San Diego Chargers also relocate to Los Angeles, temporarily using the 27,000-seat, soccer-specific Dignity Health Sports Park (known as StubHub Center before 2019) as an interim venue until the completion of SoFi Stadium for the 2020 season, which is shared with the Rams. The suspension came a year after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ended a policy that formally forbade multichannel television providers from distributing telecasts of sporting events that had been blacked out by local broadcast television stations. Then-FCC chairman Tom Wheeler considered such policies to be \\"obsolete\\". The policies are still enforced via contractual agreements between the NFL and its media partners.  Exclusivity of local simulcasts for cable games  Per NFL policies, all games that are exclusively televised on cable channels, including ESPN's Monday Night Football, and Thursday Night Football games that are only shown on NFL Network, are syndicated to over-the-air broadcasters in the markets of the teams involved, and blacked out on the cable channel in defense of the local simulcast. The local market for these rights is defined as any station within the radius of a team's respective stadium. This policy attracted controversy in December 2007, when Hartford, Connecticut CBS affiliate WFSB was refused permission to air the local simulcast of a New England Patriots-New York Giants game on December 29, 2007. The game, which was part of the Thursday Night Football package on NFL Network, would see the Patriots attempt to become the first NFL team since 1972 and the expansion of the regular season to 16 games, to finish the regular season undefeated. At the time, NFL Network was available only on a sports tier of cable provider Comcast in the immediate viewing areas of the Patriots and Giants. Senator John Kerry and Rep. Ed Markey, both of the state of Massachusetts and fans of the Patriots team, wrote to the NFL as well as Comcast and Time Warner Cable, to request that the Patriots-Giants game be aired at least on basic cable in order to reach the highest possible number of television-viewing fans, citing the \\"potentially historic\\" nature of the game. Kerry clarified the next week that he did not intend to interrupt current negotiations between the cable operators and NFL. On December 19, 2007, representative Joe Courtney (D-CT) and other members of the Connecticut Congressional Delegation wrote to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to try to have the NFL allow wider broadcast access to the game. Consequently, on December 26, the NFL announced that the game would be simulcast nationally on CBS and NBC, in addition to WCVB-TV (ABC) in Boston and WWOR-TV (MyNetworkTV) in Secaucus, New Jersey (part of the New York City market)—which had both acquired the local rights to the game. Although NFL Network would later become more established, the NFL later began to sub-license the TNF games (including handling production for all of its games, and airing a portion of the package on broadcast television in simulcast with NFL Network) to a broadcast television rightsholder in 2014, as part of a move to help heighten the profile of the fledgling package. Radio broadcasts For radio broadcasts, the NFL follows a nearly identical policy to MLB. There are no radio blackouts, but only each team's flagship station can carry local broadcasts during the conference championships or Super Bowl. All other markets must carry the NFL on Westwood One feed for those games. For all other weeks, within 75 miles of a team's stadium, only stations the team or its flagship station contracts with can carry those games, regardless if the team is home or away. Thus, any competing station that carries Westwood One broadcasts cannot air those games. Like MLB, the NFL makes local broadcasts (except for those of the Tennessee Titans) available on NFL's Game Pass service and Sirius Satellite Radio; as a result, radio stations that carry NFL games, from any source, and stream on the Internet are prohibited from streaming games online, although it seems this provision is loosely enforced in some cases; WBBM in Chicago regularly airs live broadcasts of Chicago Bears games over their Internet stream, as does WTMJ in Milwaukee with the Packers, though both stations went to a desktop-only streaming policy in 2015 due to the introduction of GamePass and the absorption of the NFL Audio Pass streaming system into Game Pass.  Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961  In order to protect high school and college football, the federal Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 prohibits the television broadcast of any professional football game on Friday evenings or Saturdays, from the second Friday in September to the second Saturday in December, by television stations within of the venue of a college or high school game occurring in that period. To comply with this law, the NFL largely avoids scheduling games on Saturday nights altogether until the final weeks of the regular season, which usually features several Saturday night contests to satisfy primetime package inventory (presently within the Thursday Night Football package) =Indianapolis 500= To encourage local attendance, the live television broadcast of the Indianapolis 500 is blacked out on the Indianapolis affiliate of its broadcaster (currently NBC station WTHR, and previously ABC station WRTV) if the race is not a sell-out. The station carries the race tape-delayed in primetime. The blackout has only been lifted twice, in 2016 (due to a sellout) and in 2020 (due to the race being held behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic), since live flag-to-flag coverage of the 500 officially began in 1986. Prior to then, ABC had aired an edited broadcast of the race in primetime.

It is usually from one autocephalous or autonomous church to another. The term is also used to refer to a parish representation (or dependency) of a monastery or a patriarch. Ecclesiastical Embassy Church In the former case, the local territorial church grants a plot of land or a church building for the use of the foreign church being represented, and the location is then considered to belong canonically to the foreign church. Services held there are often in the language appropriate to the church being represented, and the congregation is often made up of immigrants or visitors from the nation associated with that church. Typically, a metochion presence on the territory of an autocephalous church is limited to only a few parishes at most. Dependency of a monastery In the case of a monastic metochion, such a parish church is a dependency of a particular monastic community, perhaps receiving clergy from that community or other forms of support. During the Byzantine era, a monastic metochion may have been property granted to a monastery for income purposes. Metochion is currently employed, as well, to refer to a dependent monastery, skete, kellion or monastic society that is being given the blessing and support to develop into an autonomous monastery, skete, kellion or society. For an example, Wawasinno Ki'chi Wa Mali'i Waabanowigaan—the Hesychastic Society of the Most Holy Mary—is a Canadian Orthodox hesychastic society founded for (but not to be exclusively of) Aboriginal Orthodox, and which is classified as a metochion of the Monastic Society of St. Silouan the Athonite (OCA, Archdiocese of Canada).\\"On 22 March 2009, the Archbishop (Seraphim (Storheim) of Ottawa) blessed the establishment of the Hesychastic Society of the Most Holy Mary (an aboriginal brotherhood), as part of the Monastic Community of St Silouan the Athonite.\\" (CANADIAN ORTHODOX MESSENGER.

Making waves  Surface waves can be created by any moving object displacing fluid: turbine blades, paddles, a hand, a flung stone, etc. Each pulse of water (or crest) pushed outward from the disturbance leaves a space (or trough) behind it which causes another, smaller pulse to follow: thus a thrown stone's single impact causes a series of ripples. Larger waves can be built up if a series of movements are timed to reinforce waves' motion, much like a person sliding back and forth in a bathtub. Boundaries and obstacles also shape waves by concentrating or dissipating some of the wave's energy. When fluid flows over a surface which diverts it upward, this flow can rise above the rest of the fluid in a standing wave which remains in one place while the flow lasts. An example of a natural standing wave may be found in swift-flowing streams, downstream from a boulder in the stream bed. Artificial reefs can also be placed into natural wave environments to enhance the quality of the incoming breaking wave for surfing. Wave focusing areas can build up wave power and height prior to breaking, and breaking surfaces then trip the wave up to make it break; the surfing surface then carries the breaking wave along an angle that maximises its value for surfing.  Applications  In a wave pool water is pushed out of an opening with enough force to create a wave-like shape. Riders can ride this type of wave on a regular surfboard. Wave pools go as far back as the 19th Century, as famous fantasy castle builder King Ludwig of Bavaria electrified a lake to create breaking waves. In 1929, a Pathe Pictorial there is film of \\"Indoor Surfers\\" frolicking in small, artificially-generated waves in a swimming pool in Munich, Germany. The waves were created by agitators which pushed waves through the diving area and into a shallow area - where kids were bodysurfing little waves: \\"This is the new kind of swimming bath that is becoming the rage of Germany,\\" one of the captions reads. \\"No more placid waters for bathers - the mechanism behind the netting keeps everything moving.\\" In 1939, a public swimming pool in Wembley, England was equipped with machines that created wavelets. Not for riding, but to approximate the soothing ebb and flowing motion of the ocean. Artificial waves created on a designed surface, by water shot over the surface at a high speed to create a wave, are ridden with a short board about the length of a wakeboard. With wakesurfing, which is derived from wakeboarding, it is possible to surf a wave created by a boat without being strapped on to the board and without being towed by a rope. With wakeboarding, the rider is strapped on to the board to prevent the board from flying out under the rider's feet and the rider is towed by a rope without surfing a wave. The \\"standing wave\\" or \\"sheet wave\\" type of artificial wave was developed in the 1980s by American real estate attorney Tom Lochtefeld who was a partner in the development of Raging Waters water parks in San Dimas, San Jose and Salt Lake City. A surfer from La Jolla, Lochtefeld had a vision of creating water park attractions that were as exciting as riding waves in the ocean, and in 1988 he patented \\"A wave-forming generator for generating inclined surfaces on a contained body of water.\\" The untechnical, proprietary term is \\"sheet wave.\\" Rather than pulse a rapidly deteriorating wave of energy through big pools of water, Lochtefeld’s \\"new wave\\" flowed water over a stationary surface - in an enclosed, transportable area measured in square feet, not acre feet. The first Wave Loch FlowRider opened at the Schlitterbahn, in Texas in 1991. In 1993, Lochtefeld built a larger, curling FlowBarrel sheet wave at the Summerland resort in Bo, Norway. The first barreling wave pool ever open to the public was developed by Lochtefeld’s Wave House restaurant and music lifestyle centers. The first Wave House opened in Durban, South Africa in 2001, and followed by San Diego, CA (2005), Santiago Chile (2008), and Singapore (2009). WaveLoch company has sold hundreds of FlowRider sheet wave machines around the world - from water parks to Royal Caribbean cruise ships. Dr Peter Killen was the first to develop a continuously breaking, oblique, stationary wave for the study of wave riding. The work was published in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics in 1976.

Named after Cebu, an island in the Philippines, it was the second ship of the Navy to bear this name. Construction Cebu was laid down 21 September 1943, as liberty ship SS Francis P. Duffy, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MCE hull 1805, by the Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, Inc., in Baltimore, Maryland; launched 18 October 1943; sponsored by Mrs. M. C. Bird; acquired by the Navy 27 October 1943; and commissioned 15 April 1944, Captain G. W. Scott in command. Service history Cebus special mission was providing shops and trained men for the repair of internal combustion engines, but through the course of the war, her men performed a variety of tasks, ranging from the repairing of ship's clocks to major work on battleships. She arrived at Manus in the Admiralty Islands 10 September 1944. At this fleet base, she prepared small craft and larger ships for their role in the Philippine operations, working many times around the clock in order to insure the readiness of ships vital to the invasion assaults. =Mount Hood explosion= At Manus on 10 November 1944, Cebu was anchored only from when the ammunition ship exploded, showering Cebus decks with bomb fragments and heavy projectiles. Five of her men were killed and six wounded, but quick work prevented serious damage to the ship itself. She was able to continue her work without interruption, preparing ships for the Lingayen and Iwo Jima assaults. Philippines and occupation duty Cebu was stationed at Ulithi from 22 January to 12 February 1945, when she sailed for San Pedro Bay. Her work continued at a furious rate as victims of suicide attacks required immediate repairs. Her services to small craft at Leyte continued until 21 September, when she sailed for occupation duties at Okinawa and Japan until 11 March 1946. Operation \\"Crossroads\\" Cebu prepared at Pearl Harbor from 29 March to 11 May 1945, for her role supporting the atomic tests of Operation Crossroads at Bikini and Kwajalein in the summer of 1946. Decommissioning She arrived at San Diego, California, 28 September, and was placed out of commission in the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Stockton, California, 30 June 1947. On 4 August 1961, Cebu was transferred to the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California. Her name reverted to Francis P. Duffy and she was struck from the Naval Register on 1 September 1962. Fate SS Francis P. Duffey [ex-USS Cebu (ARG-6)] laid up in reserve at Suisun Bay, CA., 27 July 1972. On 18 October 1973, Francis P. Duffy was sold to Zidell Explorations Inc., for $151,899.99 to be scrapped. She was withdrawn from on 14 November 1973.

A Pallava inscription dating to the time of Santivarman (AD 455 - 470) uses the term Samanta-Chudamanayah (best feudatories).Indian Hist (Opt), by Reddy, p.A-415 The Samanta in South India was used to mean a vassal to an emperor. In North India, the earliest use of the term in a similar sense was in Bengal in the Barabar Hill Cave Inscription of the Maukhari Chief, Anantavarman (dating to the 6th century AD) in which his father is described as the Samanta-Chudamanih (best among feudatories) of the imperial Guptas.Origin and growth of feudalism in early India: from the Mauryas to AD 650, by Gian Chand Chauhan, p.53 Early development The term 'Samanta' originally meant a 'neighbour' and in the Mauryan period, the term referred to the independent ruler of an adjoining territory as is evident from its use in the Arthashastra and Ashokan edicts. The 'border-kings' (pratyan-tanripati) mentioned by Samudragupta in his Allahabad prashasti were such Samantas in the original use of the term.Indian Hist (Opt), by Reddy, p.A-94 However, the term underwent a change, and came to mean a 'vassal' by the end of the Gupta period and in the post-Gupta period. In fact, the institution of the Samanta was the main innovation that distinguished the post-Gupta period from the periods of ancient India. By the end of the Gupta period and by the 6th century the term Samanta came to be universally accepted as the Prince of a subjugated but reinstated tributary region. Early kingdoms of Medieval India would surround themselves with a \\"Samanta-Chakra\\", that is, a 'circle of tributary chiefs'.Southeast Asia in the 9th to 14th centuries, David G. Marr and Anthony Crothers Milner (Eds), p.10 By the time of King Harshavardhana, the institution of the Samanta had become well-developed and the Samantas came to be considered powerful figures. In order to integrate them into the hierarchy of the realm they were often given high positions in the court.Indian Hist (Opt), by Reddy, p.A-95 One such example is the king of Vallabhi who was defeated by King Harsha and became a Maha-Samanta. This Vallabhi king then rose under Emperor Harsha to the position of a Maha-Pratihara (guardian of the royal gateway or the royal door- keeper) and went on to become a Maha-Danda-Nayaka (Royal Field Marshal). In effect, the institution of the Samanta brought rulers of fragmented or tribalistic, small independent regions under subjugation to serve the king or emperor as vassals. The office of the Samanta represented a semantic change in state formation from an independent neighbour to a tributary chief and finally to a high ranking court official. Types of Samanta Banabhatta describes several types of Samantas in his work, Harsha Charita. Bana's Harshacharitra is the only work from which we know of various categories of Samantas. Bana mentions a large number of conquered enemy Maha-Samantas in the royal camp who were probably waiting to be assigned their new duties.The Panjab past and present, Volume 23, Dept. of Punjab Historical Studies, Punjabi University, p.142 Some types of Samantas mentioned by Banabhatta are: * Samanta: which signified the lowest and ordinary type of vassal.General Studies History for UPSC, By Reddy, p.A-95 * Mahasamantha (Maha-Samanta): a step higher than a Samanta. * Shatrumahasamanta (Shatru-Maha-Samanta): a conquered enemy chief. * Aptasamanta (Apta-Samanta): those who willingly accepted vassalage and the emperor as their overlord. * Pradhanamahasamanta (Pradhana-Maha-Samanta): who were most trusted hands of the emperor and never disregarded their advice.Origin and growth of feudalism in early India: from the Mauryas to AD 650, by GC Chauhan, p.54 * Pratisamanta (Prati-Saamanta): who were opposed to the king and meant a hostile vassal. Though hostile, all Samantas had military obligations. If they did not fulfill their obligations, the king could seize their territory and appoint a new Samanta. Despite this, some Samantas would keep trying to throw off their allegiance to the king and assert their own independent rule. Banabhatta uses the term Anuraktamahasamanta (Anurakta- Mahasamanta) only once and it possibly meant those especially attached to their overlord. Obligations of the Samanta From the Harshacharitra, we understand that the Samanta had five duties. They are: * Paying yearly tributes to the emperor. * Paying homage to the emperor in person. * Defeated Samantas had to offer their sons and minor princes to the Emperor so that they are groomed in the imperial traditions and grow to be loyal to the emperor. * Render military aid to the emperor. * Perform administrative and judicial functions in times of peace. In the nature of rendering military aid, paying tributes and performing administrative and judicial functions, the office of the Samanta is comparable to the office of the Nayaka which was followed by the Vijayanagar Empire. The Samanta system was followed by several kingdoms across north and south India. In South India Some examples of Samantas in South India are: * In the Hoysala empire, samantas were feudal chiefs paying vassalitic homage to the Maharaja and served the king as heredity governors. Some examples or names of the Hoysala heredity governors are Samanta Chattaya ruling Huliyara, Samanta Goyideva ruling Magare and Samanta Bankeya ruling Senavagere. Some such as Samanta Gandaraditya ruled over a larger territory of Arakere, Kaligunda, Kunduru, Belugere, etc. put together.The half-yearly journal of the Mysore University, Volume 3, p.106 * In the Chalukya empire, the Banas under Vikramaditya Bali Indra Banaraja, the son of Balikula Tilaka Banaraja accepted the overlordship of the Chalukyas and proclaimed themselves as \\"Taruna Vasantham\\" and \\"Samanta Kesari\\".Karnataka through the ages: from prehistoric times to the day of the independence of India, Department of Literary and Cultural Development, Govt. of Mysore, 1968, p.131 * In the Kakatiya dynasty some examples are of Gonka I who rose to become a viceroy and Beta I (AD 1000 - 1050). Beta I emerged from a status of the Samanta Vishti Vamsa, a feudatory family from among the Karma or Kamma Buddhist peasants and went on to become a feudatory prince within the Chalukya empire. Beta's son, Prola I, rose to become a Mahamandalesvara under the Chalukya King Someshvara. Further, the son of Prola I named Beta II (aka, Betha Raju) and his grandson named Prola II assumed princely status in the Kakatiya dynasty.Kakatiya Nayaks: their contribution to Dakshinapath's independence, 1300-1370 A.D, by NG Ranga, p.15 * The office of the Samanta was also passed on as a matrilineal inheritance. An example is the Paduva Panamburu inscription of AD 1542 which refers to one Kinnika Samanta being succeeded by his Aliya (elder sister's son), Dugganna Samant, a Jain Chieftain of Mulki.Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, Volume 64, p.180 The Chiefs of Mulki served as Samantas and patronized Jainism.Religions in coastal Karnataka, 1500-1763, by KGV Madhava, p.73-85 In North India * The Samanta feudatories of Sagakula were called 'Sahi' and their overlord was called 'Sahanu Sahi' (King of Kings).Mālwa in post-Maurya period: a critical study with special emphasis on numismatic evidences, by Manika Chakrabarti, p.41 The location of Sagakula is unknown. The Jaina saint Kalaka describes in his \\"Kalakacarya Kathanaka\\", that a group of Saka kings called Sahi kings were induced to come to India from 'Sagakula'. After crossing the Indus, they captured Kathiawar and Ujjayini and installed their own Sahi as the \\"King of Kings\\" and began a dynasty.The Dynasty Arts of the Kushans, University of California Press, p.130 The Sagakula were probably Saka-Kula Western Satraps who had been expelled from Seistan by Mitradates-II of Parthia. * It is suggested that Adisura ruled over a small portion of northern Bengal and Bihar as a Samanta king during the Pala rule.The history and culture of the Pālas of Bengal and Bihar, cir. 750 A.D.-cir. 1200 AD, by Jhunu Bagchi, p.75 * A samanta king (sub-ordinate ruler) named Sarangadeva or Kesari of the Somavamsi family is said to have probably ruled Sarang-Garh in Orissa.Legend, history, and culture of India: based on archaeology, art, and literature, by Kailash Chandra Dash, p.11 * Bardhamman was ruled by a Samanta king, Ichai Ghosh or Iswani Ghosh of the Kayastha community, which his desdendents held as a zamindari.Census of India, 1991: West Bengal, Volume 3, p.14 In Nepal In the Nepali realm of the Maharaja of Licchavi, samantas held feudal domains and played a major part at court. Samantas played a role in other Nepali kingdoms as well. Dr Regmi writes that in Nepal the Samanatas adopted high sounding titles such as Maharaja and Maharajadhiraja at a time when they were just Samantas (vassals). An example is an inscription in which a Samanta of Changu area, named Amsu-Varma, adopted the title of Maharajadhiraja. They were not seen giving up the title of Samanta even after adopting a higher sounding title. One such example is Mahasamanta Maharaja Sri Karmalilah.Inscriptions of ancient Nepal, Volume 1, by D. R. Regmi, p.94 Regmi compares this situation with the Indian side, where the title of Maharaja was used by both the king as well as his feudatories, such as the feudatory of Sasnaka in Midnapore, Sri Samanta Maharaja Samadatta, who ruled Dandabhukti of Utkala. The position of a Samanta was also acquired by marrying into the ruling family. An example is Baliraja of Chaughan Rajasthanakot of Jumla who was made a Samanta Raja of the state after he married the daughter of Medinivarma who was the heiress of Semja. After marriage, Baliraja was virtually the head of all feudatory chiefs of the kingdom. This was elucidated in a copper-plate inscription of 1404 AD.Making of modern Nepal: a study of history, art, and culture of the principalities of western Nepal, by Ram NIwas Pandey, p.190 Samanta Raju This compound Indian title refers to a territorial vassal or governor (a person who provides military support and governs a territory) under a king or monarch in exchange for certain guarantees) in South India. This should not be confused with the titles given in the colonial British India.

Endemic to the island of Oahu, it was the first of its genus to become extinct, c. 1850. Its island name ʻāmaui is technically a corruption, as the Hawaiians considered all the thrushes from Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Oahu to be one species, the ʻāmaui. It was a large brownish songbird that lived in much of the highland forests on Oahu. It may have been mainly a fruit eater like many of the other Hawaiian thrushes. Due to its quick extinction, little is known about the ʻāmaui. It may have nested in trees like the ‘ōma’o or nested in crevices like the extinct kāmaʻo. Its song was reported to be similar to the Molokai olomaʻo as it may be its closest relative. It became extinct due to serious habitat degradation and destruction. Mosquitoes, introduced about thirty years earlier, caused the birds to evacuate what little good habitat was left in the low altitude areas of Oahu - and if the birds did not leave, they would have contracted malaria and perished. Birds that retreated to upper elevations would have been harassed by introduced rats, which attack the berries and steal chicks from nests. This species' extinction was not well recorded, as no one mentions a specific year when the ʻāmaui was last identified. Scientists believe that the species vanished between 1840 and 1860, most likely during the late 1850s. It is known from a single specimen taken in 1825 (now lost) and subfossil bones.

The object of Hive is to capture the opponent's queen bee by completely surrounding it, while avoiding the capture of one's own queen. Hive is an abstract strategy game. Hive shares elements of both tile-based games and board games. It differs from other tile-based games in that the tiles, once placed, can then be moved to other positions according to various rules, much like chess pieces. Thus, the game has mechanics comparable to an abstract strategy board game and is marketed in that genre. It does not fit the classical definition, however, as there is no gameboard involved; the pieces are simply placed on some relatively flat surface. Hive  Composition  The game uses hexagonal tiles to represent the various contents of the hive. The original two editions used wooden tiles with full-color illustrations on blue and silver stickers to represent the units, but the current third edition has been published using black and almond phenolic resin (\\"Bakelite\\") tiles with single-color painted etchings. There are 22 pieces in total making up a Hive set, with 11 pieces per player, each representing a creature and a different means of moving (the colors listed are for the third edition of the game; the first and second used full-color drawings): * 1 Queen Bee (Yellow-Gold) * 2 Spiders (Brown) * 2 Beetles (Purple) * 3 Grasshoppers (Green) * 3 Soldier Ants (Blue) In addition, one or more of the expansion pieces may be optionally added to the game: * 1 Mosquito (Gray) * 1 Ladybug (Red) * 1 Pill bug (Cyan) In addition, the game is packaged with a travel bag (a black drawstring bag for older editions; a nylon zippered case for the current version) to make the game more portable. Given the durability of the tiles and the lack of a board, the game is marketed as a \\"go-anywhere\\" game that simply needs a relatively flat surface on which to place pieces. In 2011, the publisher released a \\"Carbon\\" edition of Hive, with a monochrome design of black creatures on white pieces and white creatures on black pieces. Tiles for the Mosquito and Ladybug expansions are included in this set. In 2012, the publisher released a lower-priced \\"Pocket\\" edition of Hive. The pieces are smaller versions of the colored Bakelite tiles, and include the Mosquito and Ladybug expansions. The game is sold with an orange drawstring bag for storage.  Gameplay  = Setup and placement = The game starts with an empty layout, with all of both players' pieces in stacks or otherwise arranged as each player prefers. It confers little or no advantage to conceal the faces of unplaced pieces; both players have \\"perfect information\\" about the state of the game, and thus by process of elimination any piece not on the board is yet to be played. The official rules do not specify that a specific player color begins; either white (similar to Chess) or black (similar to Go) may play first and players may alternate first turn between games without swapping pieces. On each turn, a player may place a new piece from their supply, or, if their Queen Bee has been placed, move a piece according to its function. A new piece, when placed, must be adjacent to only the player's pieces; it cannot touch any of the opposing player's pieces. The only exception to this rule is the first piece played by each player; the first played piece simply cannot be adjacent to anything, and the other player's first piece must be adjacent to the first player's piece (see the \\"one hive rule\\" in the Movement section below). Once placed, a piece may be moved to a new space regardless of what pieces it will touch, except that it must be adjacent to at least one other piece. After the Queen Bee has been placed, a player is at liberty to place or move at will; as pieces are placed, the layout, known colloquially as the \\"hive\\", gets larger, and pieces become surrounded by others. The strategy in placing tiles is thus usually to wait to place stronger tiles until they have a strong chance of not being immediately trapped. The Queen Bee must be placed in one of the first four turns, and if a player's Queen Bee has not yet been placed, that player may not move any pieces. Therefore, it is generally preferable to place the Bee before being forced to do so on the fourth turn. = Movement = Movement of pieces in Hive is governed by the hexagonal shape of the tiles. Tiles must be situated such that one face of a tile contacts the face of an adjacent tile, and a movement of one \\"space\\" equates to a shift to a different (imaginary) hex-shaped area that is adjacent to both the current space and to one other piece. The game has no actual board, however it can be thought of as being played on an infinite plane of tessellated hexagons. A major rule in Hive is the \\"One-Hive Rule\\"; a piece may never be moved such that during or after its movement, there are two separate groups of pieces in play. Even if as a result of the piece's move, the layout remains one group, if the hive becomes disconnected while the piece is in transit the move is illegal. This allows for the basic strategy of \\"trapping\\" an opposing piece or pieces by moving one's own piece to the outside of the opposing piece; the opposing piece then cannot legally move because the trapping piece would be stranded. With two exceptions, moves are made around the circumference of all pieces of the layout, and a piece may never move into or out of a hex that is almost completely or completely surrounded (known as the \\"Freedom to Move Rule\\"). The two exceptions to both are noted below. * The Queen Bee is the most limited in movement; she can only move one space at a time. Although restricted, a well-timed movement of the Queen can avoid her being trapped and frustrate an opponent's plans. * The Beetle, like the Bee, can move only one space at a time. However, unlike the Bee, a Beetle can also climb on top of any adjacent piece, and then if the player so wishes can move one space at a time over the top of the layout. The piece under the Beetle cannot move as long as the Beetle remains on top, and for the purpose of placing new tiles, that space is the color of the Beetle's tile, not the underlying tile. Beetles can move on top of other Beetles even when that Beetle is atop another piece; theoretically a stack 5 tiles high can be constructed, with all four Beetles atop some other tile. A Beetle on top of the layout can crawl back down onto the edge of the board, or into any surrounded space. ** Beetles have an important but rarely-seen movement restriction, a variation of the Freedom to Move Rule; a Beetle may not move directly between two adjacent hexes if doing so would require passing through a gap between two stacks of pieces that are both higher than the origin hex (without the Beetle on it) and the destination hex. The Beetle may, however, take two turns to reach this spot by first crawling into either of the stacks blocking its path. * The Spider can move three spaces around the circumference of the layout; no more, no less. This makes the Spider restricted in terms of its usefulness later in gameplay, however it has a high degree of utility at the beginning of the game as a base for other pieces or as a fast-attack piece while the layout is still small. Even when the layout becomes larger, the Spider, when positioned correctly, can still affect the game significantly. * The Grasshopper is, like its namesake, a jumping piece; it moves by jumping over one or more other pieces in a straight line to the first adjacent space on the opposite side of the line of pieces. It always jumps in the direction of one of its faces, never one of its corners. Because of this mode of movement, it can quickly traverse from one side of the layout to the other, and like the Beetle it can move into a surrounded space. * The Soldier Ant may move only around the edge of the layout, like the Bee or Spider, but unlike either piece it may move as many spaces as the player wishes. This makes the Ant a very powerful piece, capable of moving from anywhere on the edge of the Hive to anywhere else to trap an opposing piece or free a trapped piece. * The Mosquito is a piece that acquires the power of any piece (allied or opponent) adjacent to it. If the Mosquito is adjacent to a Grasshopper, for example, the Mosquito can move like a Grasshopper. If the Mosquito climbs atop the Hive using Beetle powers, the Mosquito can only move as a Beetle until climbing down onto the main level of play. If a Mosquito is touching another Mosquito, each Mosquito only gets the powers of the pieces immediately adjacent to itself; a Mosquito can't inherit powers through another Mosquito. * The Pillbug can move a piece next to itself to a free space that is also next to itself. The action happens in two steps. Step 1: The Pillbug lifts the piece out of the Hive. Step 2: The Pillbug places the piece into a free space next to itself. These two steps are important to understand because the Pillbug cannot break the one-Hive rule. That is to say, it cannot move a piece essential to the Hive. There are a few other restrictions for the Pillbug as well: the Pillbug cannot move a piece if either the Pillbug or that other piece is covered; the Pillbug cannot move a piece if that piece was moved in the most recent turn; the Pillbug cannot move a piece if the Pillbug itself was moved in the most recent turn; the Pillbug cannot move a piece through a Beetle gate (if there are two Beetles creating a gate on the second layer of the Hive). * The Ladybug is a piece that moves by temporarily climbing atop of an adjacent piece, moving on top of a different piece, and then climbing back down to an open space on the main layer of the Hive. In the official online version of the game, if a player can not make any legal move then their turn passes and the other player moves twice (or more) in a row. = Endgame = The game ends when a Queen Bee is captured by surrounding it on all 6 sides by either player's pieces, and the player whose Queen Bee is surrounded loses the game. The game is a draw if a move results in the simultaneous surrounding of both Queen Bees, or in a situation where each player's best move for a turn leads to an endless cyclical repetition of a series of moves (this situation is known as stalemate). Openings There are many possible opening strategies, but two main formations are recommended by the game's publisher. They are reproduced below in order of placement: *Spider - Bee - Ant (in a V formation with the spider at the point): This is a flexible opening that allows the Bee maximum movement possibilities while also quickly introducing a powerful Ant that can move as needed to block or trap. Beetle-Bee-Ant and Hopper-Bee-Ant are common variations that replace the first Spider with a piece that can still move when surrounded and is thus less likely to be trapped for the entire game. *Bee - Spider - Spider (in a V formation with the bee at the point): This is an aggressive quick-strike opening that allows the player the fastest possible opportunity to move (on the third turn if necessary); the Spiders can thus quickly block the opponent's opening pieces. In addition, if the opponent answers with the same or a similar opening, it provides the best opportunity to force a draw if necessary as the Bees are adjacent. For this last reason, tournament rules forbid the placing of the Bee on the first move, as this opening leads to a preponderance of draws. Bee-Spider-Ant is a common variation very similar in its mechanics. Other openings include beginning with a Beetle or Grasshopper; depending on how the Hive's shape evolves, a Beetle or Grasshopper may be able to climb or jump out of its original position, when the Bee, Spider or Ant would likely be trapped for the entire game in a similar situation. As mentioned before, it is generally considered unwise to leave the placement of the Bee until the fourth turn; not only can placed pieces not move, but the player risks being forced to play an extended string of pieces that can be easily trapped. It is also unwise to play an Ant as the first piece; this piece is likely to be trapped and/or surrounded for the entire game, and thus the player is forced to play short one Ant, placing him/her at a severe disadvantage.  Expansions  In 2007 a promotional expansion was released that consisted of a new \\"Mosquito\\" piece for each player. This game piece can be added to each player's supply before the game begins. The Mosquito acts as a sort of \\"wild card\\" piece; once played, the Mosquito takes on the characteristics of any other piece it touches at the time, so that its movement and abilities change during the course of the game. For instance, if a mosquito is located adjacent to a Grasshopper and an Ant, it can either jump over a line of pieces as the Grasshopper moves, or move around the circumference of the hive as an Ant. That move may place it adjacent to a Beetle, Spider and the Queen Bee; if it moves again it can do so as any of those three. The only exception to this rule is that if it is moved on top of the hive (as a Beetle moves), it retains the abilities of a Beetle until it moves down off of the hive again. In 2010, a Ladybug expansion was announced. It was presented at Essen 2010. The Ladybug moves three spaces; two on top of the Hive, then one down. It must move exactly two on top of the Hive and then move one down on its last move. It may not move around the outside of the Hive and may not end its movement on top of the Hive. This expansion was released in early 2011, first on electronic versions of the game for iPhone and on the Hive website, then as part of the Hive Carbon edition, and finally as an expansion set for the 3rd edition Bakelite set. In January 2013, the Pillbug was announced as a possible expansion piece, and has been added to the game. It was designed as a defensive piece, to counteract the other two offensive expansions and to give the second player a bit of an advantage. The Pillbug moves exactly like a Queen. In addition, the Pillbug has the special ability, in lieu of moving, to pick up and move another bug of either color. When doing so, the Pillbug picks up an adjacent piece and places it into a different, unoccupied space adjacent to itself. This special ability may, for example, be used to rescue a friendly Queen on the verge of being surrounded. The Pillbug may not move a bug which was just currently moved by one's opponent in the immediately preceding turn. All standard rules apply to the Pillbug. The Mosquito adapts to both the movement and special power of the Pillbug.

Gene  The ADAMTS2 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 at the end (terminus) of the arm, from base pair 178,473,473 to base pair 178,704,934.  Function  ADAMTS2 is responsible for processing several types of procollagen proteins. Procollagens are the precursors of collagens, the proteins that add strength and support to many body tissues. Specifically, this enzyme clips a short chain of amino acids off one end of the procollagen. This clipping step is necessary for collagen molecules to function normally and assemble into fibrils outside cells.  Clinical significance  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, dermatosparaxis type is caused by mutations in the ADAMTS2 gene. Several mutations in the ADAMTS2 gene have been identified in people with this syndrome. These mutations greatly reduce the production of the enzyme made by the ADAMTS2 gene. Procollagen cannot be processed correctly without this enzyme. As a result, collagen fibrils are not assembled properly; they appear ribbon-like and disorganized under the microscope. Cross-links, or chemical interactions, between collagen fibrils are also affected.

The Croatian Orthodox Church () was a religious body created during World War II by the Fascist Ustaše regime in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH). It was created in order to assimilate the remaining Serb minority and also to unite other Orthodox communities into a state-based Orthodox Church. In 1942, NDH authorities finally made a move to organize a domestic Orthodox Church. This was part of a policy to eliminate Serb culture from Axis Croatia. The church lasted from 1942–45, and was intended to serve as a national church to which Serbs living in Croatia would convert, thus making it possible to describe them as \\"Croats of Orthodox faith\\". The Croatian Orthodox Church was managed by Montenegrin nationalist Savić Marković Štedimlija. There were some discussions during the 1990s, after the breakup of Yugoslavia, regarding the revival of such a church. History The Croatian Orthodox Church was created due to the loss of a significant part of the territory to Partisans and Chetniks, as well as the additional German pressure over growing anarchy in the country caused by the persecution of Serbs, which is why a concession to the Serb population was deemed necessary. The church was formed by a government statute (No. XC-800-Z-1942) on 4 April 1942. On 5 June, using a statute issued by the government, the church's constitution was passed. The church lasted until the collapse of the NDH. A small number of the Serb clergy joined it but the Serbian Church hierarchy along with ordinary Serbs rejected it. Many or most of the church's priests were Serbian priests compelled to change churches in order to survive, together with defrocked Orthodox priests, émigré priests from Russia, and some Uniate and Roman Catholic priests. On 7 June, Germogen, Metropolitan of Zagreb, former priest of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia became its leader. His enthronement was publicized by the Ustashe regime and the official ceremony took place in front of an armed guard, with the speaker of the Croatian parliament, mayor of Zagreb and several ministers in attendance. He was executed by the Partisans after the war as a collaborator. Before the Croatian Orthodox Church was formed, the NDH officially described the Eastern Orthodox Church as the \\"Greek-Eastern Church\\", and would refer to it as the \\"Schismatic Church\\" or the \\"Greek non- Uniate Church\\". It was not recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul. The Church was only recognized by one other Orthodox church, the Romanian Orthodox Church, on 4 August 1944Krišto, Jure. Sukob simbola: Politika, vjere i ideologije u Nezavisnoj Državi Hrvatskoj. Globus, Zagreb 2001. (pg. 258) (at the time, Romania was also under the control of the Fascist regime of Ion Antonescu). According to historian Jozo Tomasevich, although the Church was established as a way to appease the remaining Serb Orthodox population in the NDH, it was ultimately a means to destroying religious, cultural and national ties between Serbs in Serbia and Serbs in the NDH because the Ustashe could not achieve their goal of exterminating the whole Serb population of Croatia. Persecution of Serbs persisted even after its establishment, though it was not as intense as before. Proposals for a revival On 6 March 1993, Juraj Kolarić, dean of the Catholic Faculty of Theology in Zagreb, was reported by the Tanjug news agency as stating that the \\"Orthodox Church in Croatia should be organized along the Macedonian principle, with its patriarch, and break away as far as territory was concerned, from Serbia”. Kolarić tried several times to establish such a church by the \\"Croat Orthodox believers and possible Croatian Orthodox clergy, because then all the conditions for an autocephalous church would be met\\". Kolarić claimed that if such a church were formed, it would eventually by recognized by the Patriarch of Constantinople as the Serbian Orthodox Church would never again be present in Croatia.

Formation Crenulations form when an early planar fabric is overprinted by a later planar fabric. Crenulations form by recrystallisation of mica minerals during metamorphism. Micaceous minerals form planar surfaces known as foliations perpendicular to the principal stress fields. If a rock is subjected to two separate deformations and the second deformation is at some other angle to the original, growth of new micas on the foliation planes will create a new foliation plane perpendicular to the plane of principal stress. The angular intersection of the two foliations causes a diagnostic texture called a crenulation, which may involve folding of the earlier mica foliations by the later foliation. Recognition foliation on earlier F3-F4 foliation. A mechanical pencil is seen for scale comparison. Recognising a crenulation in a rock may require inspecting the rock with a hand-lens or petrographic microscope in thin section. Crenulations may be very cryptic, and there may be several recorded within a rock and especially, entrained within porphyroblasts. Crenulations may manifest as kinking of previous foliation, such that the original foliation appears to be lined or inscribed by a later foliation. In more advanced states, the later foliation will tend to form distinct foliation planes cross-cutting the earlier foliation, resulting in breaking, warping, and micro-scale folding of the earlier foliation into the new foliation. When the crenulation foliation begins to dominate it may totally or almost completely wipe out the original foliation. This process occurs at different rates in rocks and beds of different lithology and chemical composition so that it is usually valuable to look at a variety of outcrops to gain a better appreciation of the effect of crenulation or discover the orientation or presence of earlier foliations. Crenulation may also be the incipient foliation plane which precipitates shearing. In this case, it is often likely that the crenulation acts as a shear plane and it may be difficult to reconstruct earlier foliations and rock units across the crenulation foliation. Analysis Crenulations, because they are the result of a second (or more) foliation, preserve important information on not only the stresses which formed the crenulation foliation, but the orientation of previous foliations. Firstly, the crenulation must be analysed to determine the initial foliation, termed S1, and the overprinting subsequent foliation. The intersection of these two planes forms an intersection lineation. This intersection lineation, L1-2 may approximate the plunge of F2 interference folds. The initial impact of a crenulation foliation may be cryptic, microscopic growth of new minerals at an angle to previous foliations. This may occur only in certain compositions of the rocks which favor growth of minerals under the P-T conditions at that time. In more brittle conditions, especially in highly micaceous rocks, a crenulation may appear as 'kink bands, where S1 foliations are kinked by the S2 foliation so that the original minerals are broken or deformed. This may not result in new mineral growth. Eventually, the crenulation foliation overprints the S1 foliation. In extreme cases, the S2 foliation will obliterate the previous foliation, especially in wet rocks which have compositions amenable to growth of minerals at that time. In this case, porphyroblasts may be the only means in which to observe earlier foliations, assuming they have inclusion trails of the S1 foliation.

It has approximately 100 students from Year 7 to Year 12. Established in 1972 at the height of the alternative education movement, the school has no fees, no uniform and no examinations until Year 12. The school prides itself on being able to achieve success with students who may have struggled in the mainstream school system. This does, however, mean that the school often ranks lowly in academic rankings of schools. The school is located in a small former Wesleyan church in the busy commercial district. The building is one of the oldest in the Brunswick area. The school attempts to keep class sizes particularly low in comparison to the rest of the state, although this has been hampered by severe funding cuts in the last fifteen years. It attempts to provide more opportunities than simply academic ones, giving strong attention to topics such as art, photography and music, which allows it to help some students who may otherwise drop out altogether. Due to the small nature of the school site, the school has no recreational or sporting facilities of its own, and as such, the school has had to use those of the nearby Brunswick Secondary College campus (then one of two) - even after the campus closed in the early 1990s. Staff, parents and students of the school were heavily involved in the highly public campaign to save the former campus' gymnasium from demolition in 2003, even occupying the site for several weeks, as had been done with the successful Fitzroy High School campaign. They were ultimately successful, with a refurbished gymnasium opening in April 2005. The site is listed in the Victorian Heritage Register.

Some (particularly amateur) leagues and competitions use a 25-metre penalty. Examples of this include the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA), Australian Football International Cup and the Australian Amateur Football Council. Rules When the umpire pays a 50-metre penalty, he calls time-off, measures out approximately fifty metres from the spot of the mark by running in a straight line towards the goals, and setting the new mark, unless: * the player is already within 50 metres of goal, in which case the mark becomes the exact centre of the goal line. * in the Australian Football League's (AFL's) preseason competition, where a goal kicked from beyond 50m scores nine points instead of six, a team may choose to cut short a fifty-metre penalty at the fifty-metre line and take the higher-value, longer-range set shot.St Kilda Football CLub, 2011 NAB Cup Trial Rules , 15 December 2010, Retrieved 5 February 2011. Players are given a short period of time to follow the play down the field before the clock is restarted. The player cannot play on while the umpire is measuring out the 50-metre penalty, and must wait for the field umpire to blow time-on.Field Umpire Accreditation Manual (Australian Football League) Infractions which can result in a 50-metre penalty include: * Arguing with, disputing the decision of, or using abusive language towards an umpire. * Scragging the player who has taken a mark; that is, to tackle the player or impede him from taking the kick as quickly as he would like. This rule has been applied more stringently since 2006 to give defensive players less time to flood the defence, and to keep the game more flowing. * Failing to return the ball quickly and on the full to a player who has been awarded a free kick. * Wasting time, deliberately or inadvertently, by kicking the ball forward after one's team has conceded a free kick. * Using unnecessary roughness against a player who has already taken a mark. * Running over the mark; the man standing on the mark cannot move forward, and must respond if called to recede by the umpire. * Running through the mark; other defensive players who are not standing on the mark may not run across the imaginary line between the man standing the mark and the man taking the kick, unless following his direct opponent. * Entering the protected zone; defensive players may not impede an opponent by entering or remaining within the corridor of space extending ten metres either side of the imaginary line between the man standing the mark and the man taking the kick, and extending backwards, unless following his direct opponent. * If any free kick is paid against the defensive team while a mark or free kick is to be taken, the umpire either pays the free kick to the violated player at the spot of the foul, or awards a 50-metre penalty to the player with the ball, depending upon which penalty brings the attacking team closer to goal. * Any free kick resulting from an interchange infringement or a line-up has an additional 50-metre penalty applied to it; these are the only circumstances under which a 50-metre penalty is automatically applied to a free kick without further infringement. History The fifteen-yard penalty was first introduced at senior level by the Victorian Football Association in 1939, as one of the rules included in its rival code of Australian rules football. The rule was introduced to give the umpire a means of penalising a player who cribbed over the mark or wasted time on the mark; under standard rules at the time, such infractions could only be policed by reports. The Australian National Football Council introduced the rule into the national rules during 1954 (leagues began using it in 1955), which was applied to both time-wasting and to crude, late challenges on the player with the mark. The length was increased to 50 metres in 1988 when it was determined that the fifteen metre penalty had become insufficient to deter time-wasting and scragging. Rationale Fifty metres is the average length of a long kick. As 50-metre penalties are awarded only to players who have already taken a mark or been awarded a free kick, the penalty is the equivalent of having made a long pass downfield (with the playing area being over 150m long). This interpretation allows the fifty metre length to be adjusted to appropriate values for lower age groups. With the exception of interchange infringements, a player must already have a free kick or a mark to receive a 50-metre penalty. Often, crowds will call for \\"fifty!\\" when they see a player hurt behind play or in a marking contest. However, many fans are unaware that unless the mark is taken, fifty metres can never be awarded. There was an exception to this rule made in 2000, when a 50-metre penalty would automatically be awarded against any player who was reported for a non- wrestling offence; so unpopular was the change that it was repealed after seventeen rounds. Notable 50-metre penalties *The most famous 15-metre penalty occurred in the 1987 preliminary final, in an incident where Melbourne's Jim Stynes ran across the mark against Hawthorn. Gary Buckenara, needing a 55-metre goal after the final siren for Hawthorn to steal the victory, was brought 15 metres closer to goal. Buckenara converted the goal, Hawthorn advanced to the Grand Final, and Melbourne's long premiership drought continued.AFL rule is well worth trying here  Irish Daily Star *In 2005 an incident where Essendon's Mark Johnson called an opposition player from Sydney a \\"weak dog\\" when he wouldn't get up and was playing for a free kick was rewarded with a 50-metre penalty to the Sydney player. It was also believed Johnson engaged in abusive language with the umpire which may have influenced the decision. *During the infamous St Kilda vs Fremantle \\"Sirengate\\" match in round 5, 2006, St Kilda full-forward Fraser Gehrig abused and argued with the umpire, gave up five consecutive free kicks: a free kick in defensive goal square, three consecutive 50-metre penalties (spanning the entire length of the field, yielding a certain goal to Fremantle) and an additional free kick to Fremantle after the goal.\\"~Dockers, Saints and Sirengate~\\" *In Round 1, 2007, umpire Stuart Wenn awarded a short fifty-metre penalty against Collingwood's Heath Shaw after a mark by the Kangaroos' Shannon Grant with three minutes remaining on the game. Wenn positioned Shaw approximately on the kick-off line when he should have been on the goal line. Grant missed the 15-metre set shot, and the Kangaroos lost the game by three points.Laidley fumes at umpire blunder  News.com.au *In Round 11, 2009, triple 50-metre penalties occurred when Sydney Swans' Barry Hall put his arm around the neck of Hawthorn's Jarryd Roughead, who ended up in his own goal square. Hall was benched beside his coach, and Sydney lost the match by eleven points. *In Round 15, 2017, late in the match between and at Domain Stadium, St Kilda forward Tim Membrey took a mark inside 50, then teammate Nick Riewoldt asked for the ball back from Fremantle's Griffin Logue, fooling the latter into thinking that it was Riewoldt who took the mark. Logue gave away a 50-metre penalty for time-wasting, then Membrey kicked the goal to give the Saints a nine-point win. *In Round 4, 2020 during the AFL Women's match between St Kilda and Fremantle, a 50-metre penalty was awarded against St Kilda player Molly McDonald with less than two minutes remaining in the game. Fremantle player Kate Flood kicked a goal from inside the goal square to level the scores in a very low scoring game. Fremantle went on to win by one point, 3.6 to St Kilda's 3.5. The ball was kicked out on-the-full at the 50-metre line by a St Kilda player. McDonald, an Irish Gaelic football import, new to the AFL game, left the ball on the ground instead of returning it to the Fremantle player. This was deemed to be an untimely lapse in concentration by the St Kilda player and almost certainly affected the result of the game. AFL Women's Controversy Many commentators on AFL Women's football regard the 50-metre penalty as too harsh for the women's game. The original rule for the men's game was intended to be the length of one kick, but in AFL Women's it can amount to almost two kicks. In addition, with low scoring games, a single 50-metre penalty can affect the outcome of a game. The penalty is often awarded for accidental actions that in no way constitute poor player behaviour that the rule was designed to curb. This \\"spirit of the game\\" argument maintains that, in the spirit of the original intent of the rule, it should only be imposed for bad player behaviour, such as time wasting or mistreating a player after a mark. Another suggestion is to adopt a 25-metre penalty as in some leagues (see above) or to give umpires the discretion to award a 25-metre penalty instead of the mandatory 50 metres. In the 2020 AFLW season up to round four, 5.6 per cent of the 248 goals kicked came directly after a 50-metre penalty had been awarded, with just 2.7 per cent of the 4601 goals kicked in the 2019 AFL Men's season coming immediately after a 50-metre penalty.

Relative scores are assigned to all nodes in the network based on the concept that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question than equal connections to low-scoring nodes. A high eigenvector score means that a node is connected to many nodes who themselves have high scores. Google's PageRank and the Katz centrality are variants of the eigenvector centrality.  Using the adjacency matrix to find eigenvector centrality  For a given graph G:=(V,E) with V vertices let A = (a_{v,t}) be the adjacency matrix, i.e. a_{v,t} = 1 if vertex v is linked to vertex t, and a_{v,t} = 0 otherwise. The relative centrality, x, score of vertex v can be defined as: : x_v = frac 1 lambda sum_{t in M(v)} x_t = frac 1 lambda sum_{t in G} a_{v,t} x_t where M(v) is a set of the neighbors of v and lambda is a constant. With a small rearrangement this can be rewritten in vector notation as the eigenvector equation : mathbf{Ax} = lambda mathbf{x} In general, there will be many different eigenvalues lambda for which a non- zero eigenvector solution exists. However, the additional requirement that all the entries in the eigenvector be non-negative implies (by the Perron–Frobenius theorem) that only the greatest eigenvalue results in the desired centrality measure. The v^text{th} component of the related eigenvector then gives the relative centrality score of the vertex v in the network. The eigenvector is only defined up to a common factor, so only the ratios of the centralities of the vertices are well defined. To define an absolute score one must normalise the eigen vector e.g. such that the sum over all vertices is 1 or the total number of vertices n. Power iteration is one of many eigenvalue algorithms that may be used to find this dominant eigenvector. Furthermore, this can be generalized so that the entries in A can be real numbers representing connection strengths, as in a stochastic matrix.  Normalized eigenvector centrality scoring  Google's PageRank is based on the normalized eigenvector centrality, or normalized prestige, combined with a random jump assumption. The PageRank of a node v has recursive dependence on the PageRank of other nodes that point to it. The normalized adjacency matrix N is defined as:N(u,v) = begin{cases} {1 over operatorname{od}(u)}, & text{if } (u,v) in E  0, & text{if }(u,v) otin E end{cases}where od(u) is the out-degree of node u. The normalized eigenvector centrality score is defined as: p(v) = sum_{u} {N^T(v,u) cdot p(u)}  Applications  Eigenvector centrality is a measure of the influence a node has on a network. If a node is pointed to by many nodes (which also have high eigenvector centrality) then that node will have high eigenvector centrality. The earliest use of eigenvector centrality is by Edmund Landau in an 1895 paper on scoring chess tournaments. More recently, researchers across many fields have analyzed applications, manifestations, and extensions of eigenvector centrality in a variety of domains: * Eigenvector centrality is the unique measure satisfying certain natural axioms for a ranking system. * In neuroscience, the eigenvector centrality of a neuron in a model neural network has been found to correlate with its relative firing rate. * In a standard class of models of opinion updating or learning (sometimes called DeGroot learning models), the social influence of a node over eventual opinions is equal to its eigenvector centrality. * The definition of eigenvector centrality has been extended to multiplex or multilayer networks. * In a study using data from the Philippines, the authors showed how political candidates' families had disproportionately high eigenvector centrality in local intermarriage networks. * In a economic public goods problems, a person's eigenvector centrality can be interpreted as how much that person's preferences influence an efficient social outcome (formally, a Pareto weight in a Pareto efficient social outcome).

This in turn inspired the 1971 film Rendez-vous à Bray, directed by the Belgian cineaste André Delvaux. The story was combined with and inflected the modern re-telling of the Pygmalion myth, especially in its treatment by George Bernard Shaw as the 1913 play Pygmalion. It has also been used to name a sexual desire for lower- class women and high class men. Although often attributed first to Graham Greene in his 1951 novel The End of the Affair, the term was used as early as 1942 by Agatha Christie in her mystery “The Body in the Library” [NY: Collier, pp. 119-121] when Jane Marple reflects on the attraction of older wealthy men for young lower class girls and Sir Henry Clithering dubs it a Cophetua Complex. The English poet and critic James Reeves included his poem \\"Cophetua\\", inspired by the legend, in his 1958 book The Talking Skull. Hugh Macdiarmid wrote a brief two-verse poem Cophetua in Scots, which is a slightly parodic treatment of the story.THE A’EFAULD FORM O’ THE MAZE: THE WRITING OF HUGH MACDIARMID, 1922–1935 – COURSE GUIDE Alice Munro titled one story in her 1980 collection, \\"The Beggar Maid\\".

It lies between the Venetian plain to the south and the central alpine areas to the North. To the west, it is parted from the Asiago upland by the Brenta river, and to the east it is separated from the Cesen-Visentin massif by the Piave river. To the north lie Corlo lake and Feltre valley. In the past, the mountain was called Alpe Madre (Mother Alp), and is currently divided among three provinces: Vicenza to the west, Treviso to the south and Belluno to the northeast. It is the highest peak of a small massif, which also includes many other peaks such as Col Moschin, Colle della Berretta, Monte Asolone, Monte Pertica, Prassolan, Monti Solaroli, Fontana Secca, Monte Peurna, Monte Santo, Monte Tomatico, Meatte, Monte Pallon, and Monte Tomba. Geomorphology The Grappa Massif was formed almost ten million years ago. It was created by the collision between the African and European lithospheric plates. Over the millennia, these sediments have been interested by a cementification and then they were lifted up by pressures that caused the Alpine mountain range to rise. Nowadays, the main types of rocks found on the Grappa are: * The Grey Limestones: the oldest formation, comprising the biggest part of the massif: it is found on the cliff faces. Its calcareous composition has caused such an expanded karst phenomenon that brought to light a lot of caves full of stalactites, deep wells and caves; * the Rosso Ammonitico: with its calcareous origin, it forms the “cities of stone” situated in the Poise and Meda Valleys; * the Biancone: a calcareous rock which is found on the summit and around the villages of Borso and Semonzo; * the Red Flake: a clayish limestone that is also the raw material used to make cement. Furthermore, over the centuries, different external atmospheric pressures have modified the morphological structure of the Grappa massif. * the glaciers, which are responsible for the high valleys of the Brenta and Piave rivers. They also caused the formation of the glacial cirques near the summit. * the creeks, which have been caused by erosion from rainwater. * The karst phenomenon, that is really extensive in the Massif. There are a lot of caves and wells, sinkholes and swallow holes, the absence of streams and sources at high altitudes and the \\"cities of stone\\". Flora Due to its geographic position near the Venetian plain, the Monte Grappa area is very rich in both flowers and plants. In fact, its climatic conditions has favoured the prevalence of small Mediterranean scrub bushes and alpine vegetation that is composed mostly of conifers in the snowy areas. Typical trees and bushes on Monte Grappa include maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) and lime (Tilia platyphyllos), the fir tree (Abies concolor), the spruce fir and the beech tree, with various geophytes underneath. Typical forest flowers include: dandelions (Leontodon tenuiflorus), Knautia persicina, Globularia nudicaulis, peony (Paeonia officinalis), the rare iris (Iris cengialti), Soldanella and Clematis. Typical pasture grasses include: Festuca paniculata and Helictotrichon parlatorei, and on the cliffs Minuartia graminifolia can be found. Fauna The Grappa Massif is also rich in fauna. Common species include roe deer, mouflon, and chamois; there are birds of prey such as the buzzard, the peregrine falcon, the golden eagle and the eagle owl, and squirrels, foxes, badgers, and lizards can all be found on its slopes. History The World War I ossuary Some of the events of World War I and World War II took place on Monte Grappa, and a memorial monument, the statue of the Madonna del Grappa (ruined during World War II but restored in the following years), and a World War Museum lie on the mountain. The remains of Italian and Austro-Hungarian soldiers who died in war are kept here. During World War I, after the Italian Caporetto defeat, Mount Grappa became the most important pillar of Italian defence, and Austrians tried many times to conquer the peak to spread on the Venetian plain from November 11, 1917 to October 24, 1918. The Italians made caves in the rock and built fixed emplacements for the artillery so that they could keep control from the Valderoa Mount to Caprile hill. The most important military work is the Vittorio Emanuele Gallery, which is equipped with water tanks, infirmaries and beds. During World War II, the Partisans sought refuge on Monte Grappa. Here the Nazis killed a huge number of soldiers, and those who had not been killed in battle were publicly hanged at Bassano del Grappa. Post war, NATO built a radar missile base on Monte Grappa for American anti-aircraft defense, which was demolished in the 1970s. = The Military Memorial Monument = Detail of the Monte Grappa Sacrario militare On the summit of Monte Grappa there is a military memorial monument, designed by the architect Giovanni Greppi in collaboration with the sculptor Giannino Castiglioni. It was inaugurated on 22 September 1935. In the central body lie the remains of 12,615 soldiers, of these the identities of 10,332 are unknown. The monument is composed of five concentric circles laid on top of each other to form a pyramid. On the top there is the little sanctuary of the Madonnina del Grappa. Near the monument, there is cave where some peoplehttp://www.montegrappa.org/musei/murer_opera.php believe that some Partisans had been burnt alive by the Nazi-fascists. Since 1974 there has been a statue called Al Partigiano in that cave, made by the sculptor Augusto Murer.

Its name comes from Romans who consecrated the site to Venus Citarea, whose statue made of white marble was found in the area. An old legend has it that the rocks, which can be seen from the beach, were in origin sailors transformed into stones as a punishment for passing through. The reference is from Odysseus, in which it is told that “Feaci” (the people living at “Scheria”, a place in the Tyrrhenian area which has been identified with Ischia) provided Ulysses with a boat to get home, so the goddess Venus punished them for helping him. On Citara Beach the Poseidon Thermal Garden is provided with a series of sea and thermal water swimming pools. It is known for its sun catching position and limpid sea. Spring water gushes into the sea. Poseidon Thermal Garden and resorts The attraction of this Thermal Park in the setting of the bay of Citara in Forio in Ischia is unique and fascinating. The thermal springs that feed the baths at the Giardini Poseidon are considered curative, due to their volcanic origins. The therapeutic effect is based both on the richness and variety of mineral salts, and on the beneficial effect of the high temperature of these waters. 22 swimming pools (Thermal, Kneipp, ocean-water) have been installed using recent technical and medical knowledge. The water temperature varies from 28°C to 40°C (82°F to 104°F ), and the abundance of water means that it is constantly renewed. A Roman sauna, a large private beach are equipped with deck-chairs and beach umbrellas, and various restaurants of which one is situated in a beautiful grotto of local tuff-stones and a boutique with a newspaper kiosk, complete this establishment.

It opened on January 12, 1921, and seats approximately 1,500 people. In the 1930s, the first public-affairs media programming originated there with the America's Town Meeting of the Air radio programs. In recognition of this the National Park Service placed the building on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012, and designated it a National Historic Landmark in 2013. History The Town Hall was built by the League for Political Education, whose fight for passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (women's suffrage) led them to commission the building of a meeting space where people of every rank and station could be educated on the important issues of the day. The space, which became The Town Hall, was designed by the architectural firm of McKim, Mead & White, to reflect the democratic principles of the League. To this end, box seats were not included in the theater's design, and every effort was made to ensure that there were no seats with an obstructed view. This design principle gave birth to The Town Hall's long-standing mantra: \\"Not a bad seat in the house\\". It has become not only a meeting place for educational programs, gatherings of activists, and host for controversial speakers (such as the American advocate of birth control, Margaret Sanger, who was arrested and carried off The Town Hall stage on November 13, 1921, for attempting to speak to a mixed-sex audience about contraception), but one of New York City's premiere performance spaces for music, dance, and other performing arts. While the lecture series and courses on political and non- political subjects sponsored by the League continued to be held there, The Town Hall quickly established a reputation as an arts center during the first fifteen years of its existence. It has also had a long association with the promotion of poetry in the United States, which predates Edna St. Vincent Millay's public poetry reading debut at the Hall in 1928. The Hall has retained a close association with poets and poetry. = America's Town Meeting of the Air = America's Town Meeting of the Air was a radio program produced at the Hall for over twenty years, from 1935 to 1956. Town Meeting was the brain-child of George V. Denny, Jr., then the associate director of the Hall. Envisioned as a means of expanding the audience -- first nationally, then internationally -- for the programs held at the Hall which promoted the free exchange of ideas, the format of Town Meeting was a conversation among four speakers on a predetermined question. The series was launched on the NBC Blue Network on Memorial Day 1935. Although it began broadcasting on a single station with approximately 500,000 listeners, within three years, Town Meeting was carried by 78 stations and boasted 2.5 million listeners. Town Meeting also toured the United States and twelve cities on three continents. It won numerous awards. Recordings of America's Town Meeting of the Air, from 1935 to 1952, are preserved at the United States' National Archives' Donated Historical Materials collection, the catalog number of which is \\"DM.13\\". The organizational records (archives) of Town Hall, Inc. and America's Town Meeting of the Air, 1895–1955, are held by the Manuscripts and Archives Division of The New York Public Library. The Town Hall was owned by New York University for twenty years beginning in 1958. Musical performances The outstanding acoustic properties of The Town Hall for musical performancewhich some performers say rival those of Carnegie Hallwere discovered during the first musical event held at the venue, a recital by Spanish violinist Juan Manén on February 12, 1921. Later in 1921, German composer Richard Strauss gave a series of concerts that cemented the Hall's reputation as an ideal space for musical performances. Aside from the acoustics, the sight lines and intimacy of the auditorium have made it a popular venue for both new and experienced artists, whatever the instrument, repertoire, or style of the performer. During the 1920s and 1930s, The Town Hall quickly gained a reputation amongst performers and audiences as the best venue for a New York debut. In 1928, The Hall began producing regular musical concert series. Over the next few seasons, The Town Hall Endowment Series featured artists including Sergei Rachmaninoff, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Lily Pons, Feodor Chaliapin and Yehudi Menuhin. Contralto Marian Anderson made her Town Hall debut on December 30, 1935, after she had been denied an opportunity at an operatic career at many other venues due to discrimination against African- Americans. Her appearance followed her New York debut at Carnegie Hall in December, 1928, and marked her return from four years of concertizing in Europe. On January 20, 1941, the Kolisch Quartet gave the world premiere performance of Béla Bartók's String Quartet No. 6. Eddie Condon led a series of nationally broadcast radio shows from New York's Town Hall in 1944–45. A June 22, 1945, concertfeaturing Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Don Byas, Al Haig, Curley Russell, Max Roach and Sid Catlettgave the public its first mainstream exposure to the style of jazz that came to be known as bebop. Prior to appearing in concert at the Hall, Gillespie and Parker had released only one 78-RPM record, and only Gillespiedue to his high-profile associations with Cab Calloway, Earl Hines, and Billy Eckstinehad enjoyed mainstream name- recognition. In June 2005, the Uptown Jazz label released a CD containing seven sonically restored performances transcribed from acetates made at the concert. The Town Hall also hosted the 1947 concert that led to the re- invigoration of Louis Armstrong's career, and which led to the formation of Louis Armstrong and His All Stars, the small traditional jazz combo that he led for the last quarter-century of his life. The Hall's tradition of jazz programming continues with the Not Just Jazz series of concerts, which also features poetry, film and dance. Past participants in the series include The Art Ensemble of Chicago, the Lounge Lizards, Cassandra Wilson, Meredith Monk, and Allen Ginsberg. Anna Russell's performance of her analysis of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen was recorded at Town Hall on April 23, 1953. The performance can be heard on Sony Masterworks CD MDK 47252, issued in 1991. On May 15, 1958, The Town Hall hosted the 25th Year Retrospective Concert of the music of John Cage. This performance was recorded by Columbia Records producer George Avakian, and the resulting 3-LP set was instrumental in making Cage's music known to many listeners. In 1959 Sammy Davis Jr. recorded Sammy Davis Jr. at Town Hall a live album recorded at The Town Hall. Jazz composer and bandleader Charles Mingus also held two concerts here, resulting in his live albums from October 1962 and April 1964. The Hall offers Morning Performances free of charge to public school students in grades 3 to 8. It also features programming in alliance with Theatreworks USA as part of its Arts in Education program. The cast of the folk music mocumentary film A Mighty Wind performed in character at The Town Hall in September 2003, as part of a seven-city tour. Much of the film itself shows performances at The Town Hall, but the scenes were actually shot in Los Angeles. When hosted by Garrison Keillor, the radio show A Prairie Home Companion was often broadcast live from The Town Hall in its New York appearances while on tour. Its successor, Live from Here, hosted by Chris Thile, now appears most frequently in The Town Hall. The venue was announced as the home of Live from Here for its 2019-2020 season, which proved to be the show's last; American Public Media abruptly cancelled the show after the June 13, 2020 episode. In September 2009, singer Whitney Houston chose The Town Hall for her first interview in seven years, appearing on Oprah Winfrey's season premiere. When asked by Winfrey why she chose The Town Hall, Whitney said it held a special place in her heart because it was where she performed for the first time at the age of 14.

It was released in August 2000. It was designed to replicate the action of a professional wrestling match. The game was designed by Michael Foley and Barron Vangor Toth. On November 14, 2007, Comic Images released a Press Release stating that they had lost the WWE License due to declining sales. The game ceased production in December 2007. As of 2008, many of the players banded together to continue the game in what is now called the Virtual era. To date, 10 Virtual sets have been released, adding over 2,000 new cards to the game. Game play The game is intended to be played in a one-on-one or two- on-two setting (a tag team match), but multi-player variants are common and popular. Raw Deal uses a 60-card deck, called \\"Arsenal\\". On this deck, players may represent their favorite superstars and moves of professional wrestlers. In addition, Raw Deal uses a 20-card mini deck, called \\"Backlash Deck\\". Cards for the game are available in starter decks and booster packs. Expansions were released two to three times a year. Update sets called “Survivor Series” have also been released, which contain the most popular cards from the preceding sets. =Basics of the game= A typical game of Raw Deal can include cards representing everything from the venue in which the match takes place to outside interference in the match. Each player reveals their chosen wrestler (referred to as a Superstar card) before the game commences. Information on the Superstar card is used to determine the number of cards in a player's opening hand (starting hand size) and who will start the game (superstar value). Every superstar card also has a superstar ability, which reflects the wrestler's in-ring attributes and often forms the basis of the deck. Some superstar cards are referred to as “remakes”. This is because they represent the same WWE persona as an existing superstar card, but with a different title, hand size, superstar value and ability. They also do not count as the same superstar as the original superstar card for that WWE performer, as they are conceptually distinct and are often played quite differently. Almost every card other than Superstar cards has two values on it: Fortitude, and Damage. Fortitude represents the courage or strength of mind of the Superstar, while Damage is the amount of punishment that a Superstar deals to an opponent. =Winning the game= A player wins the game in one of two ways: Pinfall: a player inflicts enough Damage that their opponent has to overturn more cards than remain in their Arsenal. Count-Out: an opponent ends any turn with no cards left in their Arsenal. A player may elect to refuse a count-out and go for a pin, if they want to prevent their opponent from deliberately “counting themselves out”. =Card types= At a basic level, the cards in any Raw Deal deck will be of the following types: Maneuvers (yellow): in most decks, maneuvers are the means by which players inflict damage on their opponents and gain Fortitude. There are ten main types of maneuver - strikes, grapples, submissions, high risks, trademark finishers, assaults, holds, throws, trademarks, and extremes. Maneuvers can only be played on a player's turn. Reversals (red): these cards are used to stop an opponent's maneuver or action cards. They typically stop a specific type of card, although some will reverse any card. Unless stated otherwise, Reversals will work when played from a player's hand, or when overturned while taking damage. Reversals can only be played on the opponent's turn unless the card states otherwise, and will end an opponent's turn when played or overturned. Actions (blue): these cards represent different antics in and out of the squared circle. Their effects can range from allowing a player to draw cards or recovering cards in the Ringside pile, to removing cards from an opponent's Ring area or even immediately winning the game. Actions can only be played on a player's turn. Antics (green): much like actions, these cards represent any side action taken by the wrestler during the match. They serve almost identical functions to actions. Hybrids: hybrid cards are multicoloured, and can be used for either purpose. Hybrid actions and maneuvers can only be played on a player's turn, while hybrid reversals can only be played on an opponent's turn. Superstar- specifics: these can be any of the other types of cards, and represent the trademark actions of WWE wrestlers. These cards have a logo denoting which superstar(s) may use the card, and are usually the most powerful cards in any player's deck. “Remake” superstars are always capable of playing most or all cards with the original superstar's logo on them, but do not count as that superstar. The only exceptions to this rule are Bradshaw/JBL because the character changed quite drastically storyline-wise (to the point that he doesn't even acknowledge his former gimmick). Backlash Deck The Backlash deck is made up of 20 cards - 10 Pre-Match and 10 Mid-Match cards. These cards have a horizontal orientation. Pre-Match cards are purple- bordered, while Mid-Match cards are actions, maneuvers, reversals or hybrids and have the same color as a card of the same type in a player's Arsenal. Normally, a player can only have 5 Pre-Match and 5 Mid-Match cards in the Ring at any time. When playing with a Backlash deck, there is a Pre-Match phase in the game. Starting with the player with the higher Superstar Value, players alternate in playing these cards. After all players have played all the Pre- Match cards they can or wish to play, the players resolve their effects, starting with the player who had the highest Superstar Value. There are five stages to the Pre-Match phase: Venue - locations which provide specific benefits and effects, often to all players. Feud - feud cards represent rivalries between wrestlers. Many feud cards are superstar-specific, or have additional effects against particular opponents. Stipulation - the conditions for the match, which include No Disqualification, Hell In A Cell, First Blood, Buried Alive and TLC (Tables, Ladders and Chairs) Matches. Manager - valets or other individuals accompanying a wrestler to the ring. Regular - most Pre- Match cards are played in the Regular phase, including Events, Superstar- Specific Storyline Cards, Pay-Per-View Events that represent specific WWE annual pay-per-views and Objects like WWE title belts. Mid-Match cards can be played whenever it would be legal to play them, as they are actions, maneuvers and reversals. A Mid-Match card is not considered to have been played from a player's hand, but from the player's Backlash deck. Once a player has 5 Mid- Match cards in play, they cannot play any more unless they can increase their legal limit or remove one or more from the Ring. Backstage Area This is where a player's superstar card and Backstage Area cards are located. Although these cards are on the table, they are not considered to be “in” the Ring area. Most Backstage Area cards are superstar-specific and are not particularly powerful, although they are effectively “free” cards and cannot be reversed or removed from play by an opponent. The Enforcer cards for certain superstars (Eric Bischoff, Stephanie McMahon, Paul Heyman, The Mystery Wrestler, Sable, Stacy Keibler, Theodore Long and Bobby “The Brain” Heenan) are also revealed from the Backstage Area. Tournaments Raw Deal tournaments are typically singles events rather than tag team tournaments. There are three basic formats for tournaments: All Axxess, Afterburn and Revolution. All Axxess tournaments have no restrictions on the cards or superstars that may be used by players. Afterburn tournaments require a player's deck and superstar to have been from one of the most recent expansions or the latest Survivor Series set. At present, Afterburn-legal cards are limited to card printed or reprinted in Survivor Series 3, as well anything printed after the Vengeance set (Lethal Library, Armageddon, Unforgiven and Royal Rumble sets, as well as some prize support and promotional cards). Revolution Format is restricted to Revolution Format cards only, and follow the rules of the Revolution game by itself. Regardless of the format, singles tournaments use a random draw in the first round, and the Swiss pairing system in subsequent rounds, so that players will be facing opponents with roughly similar win-loss records in each round. Players who win a match by Pin receive 3 points, while players who win by Count-Out receive 2 points. The number of rounds depends on the size of the tournament, as does the number of finals positions. In most cases, a 2:1 win-loss ration is typically sufficient to secure a finals berth. In the event of a points tie for finals placing, the performance of a player's opposition is used to determine who will qualify for the finals. In addition, no more than one player may reach the finals with the same superstar - this is known as the Diversity Rule, and discourages players from all using the same deck. If four players are using the same superstar, only one can make the finals, even if the others would normally qualify. Once the top cut is made at the end of the regular rounds, players play single-elimination rounds until only one player is left as the tournament winner. Tournament kits and random cards are usually offered as prizes for tournaments. These include title belt cards, guest ringside announcer cards or other unique cards unavailable in starter decks or booster packs. After the tournament, the performance of the players is noted and sent through to update the existing world rankings. The Raw Deal world rankings use the ELO ranking system to determine a player's position. =World qualifiers & the World Championship= The Raw Deal World Championships were held every year in the same city as WWE WrestleMania, on the same weekend as the event. To reach the world championships, a player must have either win a regional qualifier, finish as the number-one ranked player in the world, or be one of the top 50 ranked players and be randomly chosen to attend. World Championship qualifier tournaments typically attracted much larger numbers and considerably greater amounts of prize support than a normal tournament, although they were conducted in exactly the same way. The winner received a trip to the World Championships in addition to any other prize support. When the Raw Deal Player's Committee started running the World Championships in 2008, they were held every year in Indianapolis, Indiana at Gen Con. Players still had to qualify to participate in the Championships. In 2013, this was changed to an Open Championship format, where any player who showed up to the event was allowed to participate.

He is the chairman of Astra Giurgiu.  Biography and career  He started playing football at 18 years old, at Argeș Pitești and played his first game in A Division (first Romanian league) on 28 February 1998 against Dinamo București but unfortunately for him he was defeated twice and his team lost with 2–0. In the first season for FC Argeș 1997–1998 he played another three games. In the next season he did not get any opportunity to play and at the half of the season was transferred to Rocar București where he played 10 games. He returned to FC Argeș in 1999 but did not play too much in the next four seasons, only 17 games during this time. Starting with the 2003–04 season, Coman became the titular goalkeeper in FC Argeș's goal and played in most of the games: 22. The next season was the last for him at Argeș Pitești and at the half of season was transferred to Rapid Bucharest. In total he played 69 games for FC Argeș. At the end of his first season for Rapid București, they finished on the third place in the championship and Coman played in almost all the games, only missing one. In the next season 2005–06, Coman played in 22 games and in the end the club finished the season in second place and won the vice-champion title and the Romanian Cup after they defeated Național București in the final. In the European Cups Coman debuted with Rapid Bucharest in the 2005–06 season in UEFA Cup. This was the best season for Rapid in Europe. They succeeded to qualify in UEFA Cup's groups after they eliminated Feyenoord Rotterdam in a group with PAOK Thessaloniki, Shakhtar Donetsk, Stade Rennais F.C. and VfB Stuttgart. Rapid defeated PAOK, Shakhtar and Rennes and were defeated by VfB Stuttgart but they still qualified in the next round where they eliminated Hertha BSC after two great games by Coman. They also eliminated another German team, Hamburger SV and played the quarter final against Steaua București, their great Romanian rival. After two draws they lost the qualification against Steaua. On 13 December 2008, Coman, who was tracked by Bordeaux and Standard Liége, left Rapid Bucharest to sign for FC Brașov only to return to Rapid in the 2010 season. Coman left Rapid on 16 July 2012 to sign a two-year contract with FC Vaslui. After only one season, he left Vaslui to play for Astra Giurgiu, where he ended his career in 2015, but agreed to stay at the club as chairman.  International career  Coman has in total 14 caps for Romania. He debuted on 16 November 2005 in a friendly game against Nigeria and played another 5 games after this. After some mistakes made by Bogdan Lobonț in the game against Bulgaria, he became the regular goalkeeper for Romania. He was originally supposed to be Romania's second-choice goalkeeper for Euro 2008, behind Bogdan Lobonț, but a last- minute injury before the tournament made coach Victor Pițurcă to call Eduard Stăncioiu of CFR Cluj.

The game was created by Zygimantas Berziunas and later sold for Dokeda company, which supported the game until the year of 2008. Shortly after the official close of the game, the domain name fatelords.com has been dropped and purchased by a third party. Dokeda has no plans to continue hosting the game in future. The game had many playershttp://2002.infobalt.lt/?&t;=konk&r;=450&i;=2761 from Lithuania, the Netherlands, the UK and the United States, as well as other countries. Rules The game was played in a round base system which lasted from the start of the month till the end. In this time players had numerous methods to gain points such as capturing enemy planets and destroying enemy ships. Planets with higher defenses were worth more points depending on the defense. Planets with no defense were only worth 10 points and were mostly captured out of spite. At the end of the round there would be a top 25 placement system and the player who earned the most points were ranked top. Staff Gato was the last admin of FateLords and made very few enhancements to the game. The last one being the addition of the Power I-Trader which could instantly transport small ships anywhere in the game for a fairly high resource fee. He had a planetary system located in deep space, a very vast and nearly endless section of the FateLords universe. This is a system that was only known to few veteran players. Towards the end of the games life the system was discovered by Mikdugal1 an ex-veteran who was long retired. He contacted Inubis another ex-veteran who rounded up his own \\"Clan\\" (AEF)and launched the final massive attack the game has ever seen. The planets were guarded by unreleased nearly invincible battle cruisers and after days of relentless attacks they managed to destroy one. Clans It is debatable as to which was the best clan in FateLords however there are many notable ones. To start DUF(Dutch United Forces) and Darkside being two of the longest running veteran clans in the top 5. LoS (Lord of Shadows) another veteran clan that despite their skill only operated as a support clan. AEF (American Elite Forces) was the first successful faction of American players and the first alliance to claim First and Second place from Darkside in several years.

As the trick requires only that a card is thought of, it does not require the use of a deck of cards.  Method  A spectator is instructed to think of any card (other than the joker). The magician then gives the following instructions: * Take the card's face value (with aces counting as 1 and royal cards counting as 11, 12 and 13 respectively) * Double it. * Add 3. * Multiply by 5. * If the card the spectator is thinking of is a spade, subtract 1. * If the card the spectator is thinking of is a heart, subtract 2. * If the card the spectator is thinking of is a club, subtract 3. * If the card the spectator is thinking of is a diamond, subtract 4. The spectator then tells the magician the number the spectator is now thinking of. The magician then names the card.  Secret  The series of mathematical manipulations results in any given card producing a unique number. The multiplication by 2 and 5 means that the final number is ten times the card's value, plus a fixed 15 (for the addition of 3 and the multiplication by 5) and an additional suit-dependent figure. Thus both suit and value are readily identifiable. *Harry Blackstone, Blackstone's Tricks Anyone Can Do To find their card, you take the first digit of their number and subtract 1 to get the number on the card. The suit is based on the second digit of their number. 4 for Spades, 3 for Hearts, 2 for Clubs, and 1 for Diamonds. For example, if their number is 64, then their card would be the 5 of Spades.

Silba was originally founded as a political, liberal movement with aims to support the new democracies in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, with which Denmark had previous relations before World War II and the subsequent Cold War. Silba has expanded the scope of its operations several times since its inception. The focus area was expanded to include all of Eastern Europe in the early 2000s, and has once again been expanded to include the entire world in 2017. It has moved from being a politically liberal movement to being a cross political NGO, with sister branches in the Netherlands and Norway. The main objectives of Silba are to promote democracy and civil liberties across the world and strengthening cultural ties between Eastern and Western Europe. Silba operates on three levels: the local level, the national level and the international level. Silba has 6 local branches located in large Danish cities, generally tied to universities, where events are regularly held for willing participants. These range from primarily social events to lectures and debates. On the national level, Silba organizes competence-building workshops for members to expand their knowledge on various subjects. Internationally, Silba organizes election observation missions and international seminars.

There are wet and dry slips for member use for a monthly fee. The wet slips can accommodate boats up to 90 feet in length, and the dry slips are for smaller boats up to 23 feet in length. SDYC leases an outstation on Catalina Island from the Catalina Island Conservancy. The outstation is named Buffalo Beach and is located at the White's landing, Long Point area. The outstation offers resources for club members such as cabins and tents for rent, showers, stoves, bathrooms, and cooking utensils. A dockmaster tends the outstation six months a year.  Fleets  San Diego Yacht Club is home to multiple fleets, many of which race regularly. These include Lehman 12s, PCs, Stars, Etchells, and an adult Sabot fleet. There is also a model yacht fleet which races CR914s. Most of the larger boats race outside of San Diego Bay in the Pacific Ocean.

Founded in 1928 by Staff Commodore Joe Jessop, its initial objective was to teach “swimming, boat care, racing tactics, and sportsmanship”. The initial class consisted of Robert Town (the 1928 Junior Commodore), brothers Gordon Frost, Sr.* and Albert A. Frost, Jr.*, Robert Merit, Grant Stone and Walter Fisch. Of these six juniors, two became future commodores of the San Diego Yacht Club. Lessons were taught in Sea Mews and Starlets, a junior trainer that was a smaller version of the popular Star class. Races for the Starlets were held in the Bay. Two years later in 1930 the American Starlet Association was created with Gordon Frost serving as its first Commodore. The San Diego Yacht Club Junior Sailing Program has evolved into a year-round training program involving around 200 youth sailors every year. The Junior Program consists of a full-time junior program director, coaches, maintenance and administrative staff. Facilities include a junior clubhouse, tool room, Sabot and Laser storage spaces, sail and boat wash areas and two launching ramps. Members of the Junior Program have access to the junior charter fleet that includes 25 Sabots, 18 Optimists, Lasers (and Radials), CFJ's and 420's. Also included in the fleet are the SDYC Jr. race committee boat the Al Frost Sr., a dozen Whaler chase boats, inflatables, and multi-boat trailers for travel to away regattas. Throughout the year, events are scheduled for sailors of all ability levels including special events, field trips, racing clinics, a very active after-school program, and practices. During the summer months, the Junior Program offers an eight-week summer sailing and racing program. The result of coaching, learning and racing has led to the San Diego Yacht Club Youth Program's success in local, area, national and international competitions. In the recent past, SDYC Juniors have won the US Sailing Youth Championships Single-handed trophy nine times and the Double-handed trophy four times. SDYC juniors won the Interscholastic Sailing Association's National Championships in 1993, 1996, 1999 and 2001–2005 and have placed in the top three each year. The alumni of the SDYC Junior Program compete at the highest international levels. Olympic Gold, Silver and Bronze medalists, World and National Champions in several classes and America's Cup competitors are all products of SDYC's Junior Sailing Program. Olympic hopeful Andrew Campbell is a part of the Junior program. Other notable juniors include Adam Roberts, Graham Biehl, Cameron Biehl, Jake LaDow, Judge Ryan, Grace McCarthy, and Jake Reynolds, many of whom continue their sport at college. About 200 children attend the program each summer, with many continuing year round. The junior sailors sail 420s, CFJs, Sabots and Lasers. Several high school sailing teams also sail out of the San Diego Yacht Club, including the Point Loma, Bishop's, Francis Parker, and Cathedral Catholic High School sailing teams.

He is Professor of Evolutionary Genetics at the University of Nottingham, in the School of Biology. Research summary Brookfield is interested in how the genome evolves and has recently focussed on the evolution of DNA sequences which control development, particularly in Drosophila, and on the evolution of transposable elements. Education, appointments and honours John Brookfield received his BA in Zoology from the University of Oxford 1976. He received his Ph.D. in Population Genetics at the University of London in 1980. Following a post as Research Demonstrator in Genetics at the University College of Swansea from 1979-1981, he became a Visiting Fellow in the Laboratory of Genetics at The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, North Carolina from 1981-1983. Returning to the UK, he became a Lecturer in Genetics at the University of Leicester from 1983-1986. He is now Professor of evolutionary genetics at the University of Nottingham. John Brookfield is an invited Fellow of the Society of Biology was appointed Fellow of the Institute of Biology in 2009, and has served as Vice-President (External Relations) of the Genetics Society. He served on the UK RAE panel for the assessment of Biological Sciences in both 2001 and 2008. Popular Science In 2006, John Brookfield was invited to comment on the Chicken or the egg controversy, along with a number of others. All parties came down on the egg first side of the debate. John gives his reasoning as \\"The first chicken must have differed from its parents by some genetic change, perhaps a very subtle one, but one which caused this bird to be the first ever to fulfil our criteria for truly being a chicken. Thus the living organism inside the eggshell would have had the same DNA as the chicken that it would develop into, and thus would itself be a member of the species of chicken.\\" To further public understanding of evolutionary genetics, John Brookfield has created a podcast explaining some of the issues, and as part of the Nottingham University 200 years of Darwin Celebrations, delivered Darwin's famous lecture On the Origin of the Species, in full Victorian dress. He has additionally written in the media about DNA profiling. Bibliography Carr, M., Soloway, J.R., Robinson, T.E., and Brookfield, J.F.Y.

In October 1940, a specialised NKVD force had also been formed to assist with local air defence for important areas. By June 1941 this new Main Directorate for Local Antiaircraft Defence had three regiments, including in Moscow, and four battalions, all engineer-anti-chemical units. Another division and five brigades totalling just under 30,000 men were in the process of formation. During World War II, most units of the NKVD Internal Troops were engaged alongside Red Army forces against Axis troops. They participated in the defense of Moscow, Leningrad, the Brest Fortress, Kiev, Odessa, Voronezh, Stalingrad, the North Caucasus and were heavily engaged during the Battle of Kursk. Typically, NKVD Internal Troops were defensive in nature, although they played a particularly instrumental role during the Battle of Moscow, the Siege of Leningrad, and the Battle of Stalingrad where the 10th NKVD Rifle Division suffered almost 90% casualties during the battle. Large VV units also stayed in the rear to maintain order, fight enemy infiltrators and to guard key installations (such as the armament manufacturing complex at Tula, protected by the 156th NKVD regiment in 1941) and the railway installations guarded by the 14th Railway Facilities Protection Division NKVD. Altogether, more than 53 Internal Troops divisions and 20 Internal Troops brigades were on active duty during the war. Of those, 18 units were awarded battle honors (military decorations or honorary titles). A total of 977,000 servicemen were killed in action. More than 100,000 soldiers and officers received awards for gallantry in the face of the enemy, and 295 servicemen were awarded the \\"Hero of the Soviet Union\\" title. = Cold War = After the war's end, Internal Troops played an important role in fighting local anti-Soviet partisans in the Baltic states (such as the Forest Brothers) and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. In 1953, the Internal Troops suppressed the Vorkuta labor camp uprising with gunfire, which resulted in death of at least 100 political prisoners. A series of Internal Troops districts supervised many divisions, brigades, regiments, and battalions. Among them was the headquarters for Internal Troops in the Baltic area, which became Directorate Internal Troops NKVD-MVD-MGB Baltic Military District (Управление ВВ НКВД-МВД-МГБ Прибалтийского округа). This headquarters supervised several Internal Troops divisions, including the 14th Railway Facilities Protection Division from 1944 to 1951.Soldat.ru, Headquarters of Internal Troops 1941-1951, accessed April 2014. Other divisions in the Baltic MD included the 4th, 5th, and 63rd Rifle Divisions NKVD. In 1969, the internal forces were managed by the Main Department of Internal Troops MVD of the USSR.These four paragraphs are drawn from http://shieldandsword.mozohin.ru/VD3462/mvd6691/troops/vv.htm By an order of the Ministry of Internal Affairs number 007 of 22 February 1969 on the basis of the Internal Troops, Internal and Escort of the Interior Ministry of the Ukrainian SSR, the Ukrainian SSR and the Moldavian SSR MVD Internal Troops Directorates were officially established. At the beginning of 1969 in the MVD were: *Internal Troops Directorates (UVV) of the MVD of the Ukrainian SSR and the Moldavian SSR *OMSDON \\"Felix Dzerzhinky\\" (Reutov, Moscow region). *19th, 36th (Moscow), 43rd (Minsk), 44th (Leningrad), 54th (Rostov-on-Don), 79th (Kirov), 80th (Kuibyshev), 83rd (Syktyvkar), 84th (Perm), 87th (Sverdlovsk), 88th (Tashkent), 89th (Novosibirsk), 90th (Kemerovo), 91st (Irkutsk), and 92nd (Khabarovsk) Convoy Divisions *Guard brigades and regiments *Special motorized militia units *Military Academies Ten other convoy divisions were formed up to the 1990s (42nd (Vilnius), 68th Division (Gorky), 75th (Alma-Ata), 86th, 101st, 102nd, 38th, 39th, 48th, 50th and 76th (77th?) Convoy Division (Petrovsky). On January 11, 1978 was established Interior Ministry forces in the Far East and Eastern Siberia. On April 23, 1979, on the basis of Headquarters 89th Convoy Division (Novosibirsk's Military Unit Number 7540) was created the Directorate of Internal Troops (UVV) MIA Western Siberia (with the inclusion of the 90th and 102nd convoy divisions).See further http://www.sibfo.ru/ovv/history.php On the basis of the 44th Convoy Division the UVV MIA North-West and the Baltic States was created. With the beginning of the Khrushchev era and de-Stalinisation, the Internal Troops became significantly reduced in size, but retained their pre-war functions. After the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, Internal Troops personnel were among the cleanup crews ('liquidators'), engaged in security and emergency management activities;У МВС вшанували учасників ліквідації наслідків аварії на ЧАЕС (ФОТО) hundreds of servicemen were exposed to heavy radiation and dozens died. By 1989, with the increasing popular discontent nationwide that had begun to manifest in the USSR, the Internal Troops of the MVD, on orders from the Presidum of the Supreme Soviet, officially became a reporting agency of the MIA after years as a part of the Ministry of Defense. On 1 October 1989, the Ground Forces' 14th Tank Division at Novocherkassk (Rostov Oblast) was transferred into the MVD as the 100th Motorised Division for Special Use VV MVD SSSR.Michael Holm, Prior to the 1990s, there were 180 regiments (of varying size) of Internal Troops, of which 90 were mainly guards of correctional institutions, important public facilities and public order. Some of them became engaged in the ethnic conflicts that occurred during the Dissolution of the Soviet Union. Their activities during this period included the 1989 violent incident in Tbilisi when VV servicemen used entrenching shovels to decimate a crowd of unarmed Georgian civilians. = Internal troops outside Soviet Union = Emblem of the Internal Troops of Kazakhstan. The patern of Internal Troops was copied by many countries of the Warsaw Pact. In 1945 in Poland the Internal Security Corps was established, in East Germany a similiar unit or the Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft (\\"People's Police Alert Units\\") was created in 1955. These units were created for a further reason as well: to have additional ground troop capacities in the event of a war, that did not show up at armaments negotiations, because those internal troops were not part of the military and still had suitable and compatible equipment. During Cold War the West German Bundesgrenzschutz /BGS (Federal Border Guard) was a paramilitary police with infantry units as well, for a short period there was even a mandatory service in force.  Internal troops today  After the fall of Soviet Union in 1990–91, local Internal Troops units were resubordinated to the respective new independent states, except for the three Baltic countries. Azerbaijan (Internal Troops of Azerbaijan), Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation (Internal Troops of Russia), Tajikistan (Tajik Internal Troops) and Ukraine (Internal Troops of Ukraine) retained the name, organization and tasks of their Internal Troops. Up until December 2002, Armenia maintained a Ministry of Internal Affairs, but along with the Ministry of National Security, it was reorganised as a non-ministerial institution (the two organisations became the Police of Armenia and the National Security Service).Taylor and Francis, Europa World Yearbook 2004, p.554.

Civil Georgia. 15 September 2004. The Internal Troops of Kazakhstan was dissolved in April 2014 and was replaced with the National Guard of Kazakhstan. Modern internal troops can partly be compared with Riot police forces all over the world. General organization Mongolian Internal Troops. Kyrgyz Internal Troops during a rehearsal for a Victory Day Parade in Bishkek in 2015. Despite being subordinated to a civilian police authority, Internal Troops are a military force with centralized system of ranks, command and service. The chief commander and staff of the Troops report only to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, maintaining their separate chain of command. Soviet VV units were predominantly formed up of conscripts drafted by the same system as for the Soviet Army. Modern troops in Russia and Ukraine are experiencing a slow transition to the contract personnel system. VV officers are trained in both own special academies and the Army's military academies. The main kinds of Internal Troops are field units, prison security units, various facility- guarding units and special forces like Rus. Since the 1980s, the several special forces units that developed within the VV, were created to deal with terrorism and hostage crises. Fields units are essentially light motorized infantry, similar to respective regular army units by their organization and weapons. Soviet prison security units (; criminal slang: vertuhai) originally consisted of the units that guard the perimeters of the prisons, and the prisoner transport teams (actually konvoi, literally \\"convoy\\"). In post-Soviet countries, some or all of the prison-related tasks were transferred to other agencies. Internal Troops in popular culture The Guard is a Soviet 1990 drama film, based on the real story of VV soldier who killed his entire prisoner transport unit as a result of dedovschina (brutal hazing system).

It is designed for 6 to 10 novice and intermediate players with characters of levels 2-5. The Assassin's Knot is a sequel to The Secret of Bone Hill, and is the second of three modules in the Lendore Isle series. It was ranked the 29th greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine. Plot summary The Assassin's Knot is a sequel to The Secret of Bone Hill, picking up on themes from that module and shifts them to a new locale. The player characters must solve the mystery of who killed the Baron of Restenford, with evidence pointing to somebody from the town of Garrotten. The scenario describes the town and its castle. The Assassin's Knot module is different from most of its contemporaries in that it contained no dungeon or dungeon- like area. The longer the players take to find the murderer, the more unfortunate events occur in the village. The village, Garrotten, is reputed to be the place to go to have someone killed. The entire village shuts down when the Baron of Restenford is found dead, mutilated beyond the possibility of magical restoration. Three small clues are all the player characters have to unravel the mystery. Publication history The Assassin's Knot was written by Len Lakofka and published by TSR in 1983 as a thirty-two page booklet with two outer folders. It is a sequel to L1 The Secret of Bone Hill, and the second module in the Lendore Isle series. This series was originally planned to be five modules. The third module in the series, L3 Deep Dwarven Delve, was only available as a limited release as part of the Dungeons & Dragons Silver Anniversary Collector's Edition set released in 1999. In 2006, Lakofka announced on the Pen & Paper website that he would be releasing L4 and L5 through Dragonsfoot, introducing additional material and adventures set in the Lendore Isles. A subsequent threaded discussion on the Dragonsfoot forum gives the title of L4 as \\"Devilspawn\\". The adventure \\"Priestly Secrets\\" in Dungeon #71 (Nov/Dec 1998) was set in Restenford and took into account events from this module in Garrotten. Reception The Assassin's Knot was ranked the 29th greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004. In his description of The Assassin's Knot in Heroic Worlds, Lawrence Schick makes light of the module by noting the obviousness of the murderers being from a town named Garrotten: \\"A murderer from a town called 'Garrotten'? Nah...\\" Doug Cowie reviewed the scenario for Imagine magazine. He noted the high standard of production and the \\"well laid out, clear instructions\\" for the gamemaster as well as good maps and plans. However, Cowie was dissatisfied with the proof reading and found a number of typos, some of which could interrupt the flow of play, according to him. He praised the fact that most of the interaction is all human/humanoid with \\"hardly a monster to be seen\\". Cowie also liked the off-stage action that puts some time pressure on the players. He appreciated the excellent detail for the town of Garrotten and praised Len Lakofka for having successfully dealt with the special issues involved in a murder mystery adventure. Cowie ended his review by noting: \\"This is a good 'un. I like it.\\" The Assassin's Knot received a fairly positive review by Dave Morris in issue No. 55 of White Dwarf magazine, who scored it 7 out of 10. Morris felt that the module was not in the same class as Temple of Death, lacking the sort of evocative background found in that adventure. He felt that it was \\"an entertaining murder mystery for AD&D; characters\\", but added, \\"this module gives no feeling of being part of a real world with a real history... it is difficult to believe or be interested in the world of L2\\". He did feel that younger players may enjoy the module for its puzzle aspect. Rick Swan reviewed the adventure in The Space Gamer No. 71. Swan felt that the characters on the cover of the module looked bored, and that players seeking to undertake this adventure had \\"better be ready to join them\\". Swan noted that the town in which the bulk of the adventure takes place and its occupants are well detailed, but that the non-player characters encountered were not interesting, and that the murder mystery of the plot is \\"a very pedestrian affair\\". Swan called the adventure \\"just plain dull\\" and advised passing on it. References * External links *L2 Assassin's Knot full module as a PDF file from the Wizards of the Coast website.

The person in charge of this area is known as the chef garde manger or pantry chef. Larger hotels and restaurants may have garde manger staff to perform additional duties, such as creating decorative elements of buffet presentation like ice carving and edible centerpieces. History A chaud-froid display piece The term garde manger originated in pre-Revolutionary France. At that time, maintaining a large supply of food and beverage was an outward symbol of power, wealth, and status. It is because of this duty of supervising the preserving of food and managing its utilization that many interpret the term garde manger as \\"keeping to eat\\". The term garde manger is also related to the cold rooms inside castles and manor houses where the food was stored. These food storage areas were usually located in the lower levels, since the cool basement-like environment was ideal for storing food. These cold storage areas developed over time into the modern cold kitchen. Most merchants who worked outside noble manors at this time were associated with a guild, an association of persons of the same trade formed for their mutual aid and protection. Guilds would develop training programs for their members, thereby preserving their knowledge and skills. Charcuterie was the name of a guild that prepared and sold cooked items made from pigs. Through this organization, the preparation of hams, bacon, sausages, pâtés, and terrines were preserved. When the guild system was abolished in 1791 following the French Revolution of 1789, garde mangers took on the responsibility for tasks that had formerly been performed by charcutieres, who had difficulty competing with the versatile garde mangers due to the limited range of skills involved. The position of \\"butcher\\" first developed as a specialty within the garde manger kitchen. As both the cost of and demand for animal meats increased, more space was required for the task of fabricating and portioning the raw meats. This increased need for space was due not only to an upswing in the volume of meat sales, but also to the need for separating raw meats from processed foods to avoid cross-contamination and the resulting possibility of foodborne illness. Modern Garde manger Modern Garde manger can refer to different things in the professional kitchen. In many restaurants, it is a station which is generally an entry-level cooking position within a restaurant, as it often involves preparing salads or other smaller plates which can be heated and quickly plated without significant experience. In other high-profile classically influenced restaurants and hotels, the position pertains to the classical preparations, which often include pâtés, terrines and elaborate aspics.

The fifth and final season ended on July 16, 2012. The show was set in the fictional town of Eureka, Oregon (although in the pilot episode Eureka was located in Washington - and the origin of a diamond in the episode \\"Best In Faux\\" was shown as Eureka, California). Most residents of Eureka are scientific geniuses who work for Global Dynamics - an advanced research facility responsible for the development of nearly all major technological breakthroughs since its inception. Each episode featured a mysterious accidental or intentional misuse of technology, which the town sheriff, Jack Carter, solved with the help of town scientists. Each season also featured a larger story arc that concerned a particular major event or item. The series was created by Andrew Cosby and Jaime Paglia and was produced by Universal Media Studios. While initially lacking in critical acclaim, Eureka was a ratings success for the network, averaging 3.2 million viewers during the second half of season three. In 2007, Eureka was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Visual Effects for a Series, and won the Leo Award for Best Visual Effects in a Dramatic Series. In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, the show airs on Syfy and is known as A Town Called Eureka, although it is also shown under its original title on the BT Vision platform. Synopsis Jaime Paglia, co-creator of Eureka, at the 2011 Phoenix Comicon. Deputy United States Marshal Jack Carter stumbles upon Eureka while transporting a fugitive prisoner (his own rebellious teenage daughter Zoe) back to her mother's home in Los Angeles. When a faulty experiment cripples the sheriff of Eureka, Carter finds himself quickly chosen to fill the vacancy. Despite not being a genius like most members of the town, Jack Carter demonstrates a remarkable ability to connect to others, keen and practical insights, and a dedication to preserving the safety of Eureka. Eureka took place in a high tech fictional community of the same name, located in the U.S. state of Oregon (Washington in the pilot), and inhabited by brilliant scientists. Camouflaged by an electromagnetic shield, the town is operated by a corporation called Global Dynamics (GD), which is overseen by the United States Department of Defense. The town's existence and location are closely guarded secrets. In episode 1.8 (\\"Right as Raynes\\"), Carter and Eureka scientist Nathan Stark are able to drive to Summerville, Oregon within an hour, give or take a few minutes. Then, in episode 2.03 (\\"Unpredictable\\"), the meteorologist's map shows Eureka as being on the Santiam River by the Green Peter Reservoir in Oregon. But in episode 5.06 (\\"Worst Case Scenario\\"), Jack is directed to place an electromagnetic field generator device at the center of Eureka's shield. The GPS coordinates given are , located in the Winema National Forest, north of the border between California and Oregon. Cast and characters =Main characters= * Sheriff Jack Carter, portrayed by Colin Ferguson, is a U.S. Marshal who reluctantly ends up as the sheriff of Eureka. Jack is consistently dumbfounded by the wonders Eureka produces, as well as its propensity to produce things that often threaten the entire town (or world). Despite being a man of average intelligence in a town full of geniuses, Jack's admittedly simple ideas and his intuition often save the day. * Zoe Carter, portrayed by Jordan Hinson (seasons 1–3, recurring in seasons 4–5), is Jack's rebellious teenage daughter. Unlike her father, she is intelligent enough to keep up with the town's residents. Yet, like her father, she possesses street smarts, something lacking for most of the town's residents. She hopes to attend Harvard Medical School and become a physician. * Dr. Allison Blake, portrayed by Salli Richardson-Whitfield, is a Department of Defense agent who acts as the liaison between Global Dynamics and the federal government in season one. Later, she becomes the head of Global Dynamics. In seasons four and five she is the head doctor due to the effect of their journey to the 1940s. Allison, unmarried, is also mother of Kevin, who has autism until time travel in season four creates a new timeline where Kevin is neurotypical. * Dr. Henry Deacon, portrayed by Joe Morton, is the town jack of all trades and a brilliant scientist. Henry has ethical objections to the kind of research conducted at Global Dynamics, so he prefers to be employed as the town's mechanic. Henry's assistance is often invaluable in defusing the bad situations that are created by experiments at Global Dynamics. * Dr. Nathan Stark, portrayed by Ed Quinn (seasons 1–3), is one of Eureka's top scientists. He and Jack are frequently at odds, although both respect each other. On and off, he is romantically involved with Allison. He is modeled after Tony Stark, a Marvel Comics character. * Dr. Beverly Barlowe, portrayed by Debrah Farentino (seasons 1–2, recurring in seasons 4-5), is the town psychiatrist. She secretly works for a mysterious organization known as the Consortium, which has expressed a desire to exploit Eureka's innovations by whatever means necessary. * Josephina \\"Jo\\" Lupo, portrayed by Erica Cerra (recurring in seasons 1–2, regular in seasons 3–5), is Eureka's deputy sheriff. She is a former U.S. Army Ranger with a love of firearms. In seasons four and five, she is the head of Global Dynamics security due to the effect of their journey to the 1940s. * Dr. Douglas Fargo, portrayed by Neil Grayston (recurring in seasons 1–2, regular in seasons 3–5), is a junior scientist, treated somewhat dismissively by his peers. Accident-prone, he often ends up a victim of the disasters befalling the town, and has caused a fair share of the problems. Grayston also provides the voice of S.A.R.A.H. (Self Actuated Residential Automated Habitat), the bunker home Jack and Zoe Carter live in. In seasons four and five he is the head of Global Dynamics due to the effect of their journey to the 1940s. * Zane Donovan, portrayed by Niall Matter (recurring in season 2, regular in seasons 3–5), is a rebellious genius who is recruited to Global Dynamics. He allegedly caused a stock market crash, and agreed to work for GD as an alternative to imprisonment. * Dr. Grace Monroe, portrayed by Tembi Locke, (seasons 4–5) a scientist, mechanic, and wife of Henry Deacon in an alternate timeline created after the Eureka Five time- traveled to 1947.

Crossovers Eureka was part of Sci-Fi's developing shared fictional universe, with several characters crossing over between series: Global Dynamics researcher Douglas Fargo (played by Neil Grayston) from Eureka traveled to South Dakota to update Warehouse 13's computer system in the Warehouse 13 episode \\"13.1\\". Warehouse 13 computer wizard Claudia Donovan (played by Allison Scagliotti) subsequently traveled to the town of Eureka, Oregon to check out the technological marvels at Global Dynamics in the Eureka episode \\"Crossing Over\\". Fargo again appeared in the Warehouse 13 episode \\"Don't Hate the Player\\" when Claudia, Lattimer, and Bering traveled to Palo Alto, California to find Douglas beta testing a virtual reality simulator with the aid of a dangerous artifact. Additionally, Hugo Miller spent some time in the town of Eureka, departing with Douglas Fargo at the end of episode \\"13.1\\"; he returns in \\"Love Sick\\", commenting that, \\"every week [there] something seems to go 'boom'!\\" His presence there is off screen. Reception =Ratings and viewership= The series premiere was watched by 4.1 million people, making it the top-rated cable program for that night; it was the highest-rated series launch in Sci-Fi's fourteen-year history.

The award was accepted by head writer Ed Fowler. Cancellation On August 8, 2011, it was announced that Eureka would be cancelled after five seasons. Syfy decided not to order a season six of Eureka: \\"But Eureka is not over yet. There is a new holiday episode this December and 12 stellar episodes set to debut next year, marking its fifth season and six memorable years on Syfy. The 2012 episodes are some of the best we've seen, and will bring this great series to a satisfying end.

He is Professor Emeritus at the Faculty of Chemistry, University of Bielefeld. His research involves mainly the chemistry of transition metals, especially with relation to nanochemistry. Müller’s work on a new type of isopolyoxovanadates has provided some of the most instructive examples of host-guest inorganic chemistry, leading to the recognition that a polyoxometalate is a supramolecular species involving a negatively charged host cage and a negatively charged encapsulated guest, and hence opening a new era in polyoxometalate chemistry. The template self-organization of an ”electronically inverse host” around a negatively charged guest might seem somewhat puzzling: According to theoretical studies, this follows from the fact that electrostatic repulsion is overcome by maximizing the molecular electrostatic potential at the guest His current research relates mainly to the synthesis of spherical porous metal oxide nanocapsules Mo132 Keplerates. Müller has also worked on simple transition metal sulphur compounds, including related hydrodesulfurization catalysis and a new type of host guest chemistry based on polyoxovanadates He has also strong interest in history and philosophy of science.For example: a) Die inhärente Potentialität materieller (chemischer) Systeme, A.

Academic career  Achim Müller studied chemistry and physics at the University of Göttingen and received there his PhD degree (1965) and the Habilitation (1967). In 1971, he became professor at the University of Dortmund and in 1977 professor of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Bielefeld.

Research  guanidinium cation-guests (sphere surface supramolecular chemistry). His current research relates mainly to bottom-up pathways towards tailor-made spherical porous metal oxide nanocapsules Mo132 Keplerates. Müller's discovery of the molecular giant spheres (Keplerates) of the type Mo132 (diameter ca. 3 nm) and their derivatives, of the wheel shaped cluster Mo154 (Refs. and Polyoxomolybdate Clusters: Giant Wheels and Balls, A. Müller, S. K. Das, E. Krickemeyer, C. Kuhlmann (checked by: M. Sadakane, M. H. Dickman, M. T. Pope), Inorganic Syntheses, Editor J. R. Shapley, 2004, 34, 191.) and hedgehog shaped cluster Mo368 (as large as 6 nm) has caused a paradigm shift due to the unique structural features and huge application range of these molecular nanoclusters . The capsule has 20 well-defined pores with crown-ether functions which may be reversibly opened and closed. Substrates enter through these pores, and they can react to form a variety of species depending on the internal tapestry of the nanocontainer. This inorganic nanocell also allows ion transport through the cavity. Several new phenomena under confined conditions can be studied by variation of the internal ligands with hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic character, based on a variety of reactive substrates inside (for the interdisciplinary character of the whole compound class see Ref.Molecular growth from a Mo176 to a Mo248 cluster, A. Müller, S. Q. N. Shah, H. Bögge, M. Schmidtmann, Nature, 1999, 397, 48.). These single molecules are quite large; this can be shown by taking the length of an oxygen molecule with two atoms (length 0.12 nm) as a unit, then considering Mo368 which is 50 times larger. All the mentioned nanomaterials belong to a class commonly termed polyoxometalates and some special ones to the molybdenum blue family; the elucidation by Müller of the chemical nature of molybdenum blue was a real tour de force.Soluble Molybdenum blues - \\"des Pudels Kern\\", A.

Jackson was an All-Star in 2009, threw a no-hitter on June 25, 2010, and was a member of the 2011 World Series champion Cardinals. Jackson has played for more major league teams than any other player in Major League Baseball history, having played for his 14th club, the Toronto Blue Jays, in 2019, passing the record previously held by Octavio Dotel. Early life Jackson's father, Edwin Jackson Sr., while in the United States Army, was stationed in Neu Ulm, Germany at the time of his birth. Jackson is one of 27 major league players who were born in Germany. He spent three of the first eight years of his life in Germany, had a few years in Louisiana, before spending the rest of his youth in Columbus, Georgia. Jackson attended Shaw High School in Columbus, Georgia from 1997 to 2001. While attending Shaw High School, Jackson played outfield for the Raider baseball team. His senior year, Jackson helped lead the Raiders baseball team to the 2001 GHSA AAAA State Championship title over Columbus High School in Columbus, Georgia. Professional career =Los Angeles Dodgers (2003–2005)= The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Jackson in the sixth round of the 2001 MLB draft. He was originally drafted as an outfielder but the Dodgers converted him into a pitcher. There was a time when Jackson was regarded as one of the premiere pitching prospects in baseball (after posting sub-4.00 earned run averages (ERAs) in AA and the majors at age 19 in 2003), but poor showings in AAA and MLB after that season ended his status as a \\"can't-miss\\" prospect. He made his major league debut on September 9, 2003, his 20th birthday. In that game, he pitched six innings, giving up one run and out-pitching Cy Young Award-winner Randy Johnson to earn his first career major league victory. =Tampa Bay Rays (2006–2008)= On January 14, 2006, Jackson and left-handed pitcher Chuck Tiffany were traded to Tampa Bay for pitchers Danys Báez and Lance Carter. In 2006, Jackson pitched in 23 games, mostly in middle relief, and posted a 5.45 ERA in 36⅓ innings. In 2007, Jackson became a full-time starter for the Rays. He began the season poorly, going 1–9 with a 7.23 ERA in 17 games over 74⅔ innings. Jackson managed to rebound somewhat after the All-Star break, posting a 4–6 record and a 4.48 ERA over 15 games, all of them starts. His season highlight came in a start against the Texas Rangers on August 11, in which he recorded a shutout, allowing only four hits and one walk while striking out eight. Jackson finished the season with a 5–15 record and an ERA of 5.76. In 2008, Jackson assumed the number four spot in the Rays' starting rotation out of spring training. He finished the season with a 4.42 ERA. Jackson tied with James Shields to lead the Rays with 14 victories, which also tied the record for most wins by a Rays pitcher.Chuck, Bill. 100 random things about the Red Sox, Rays, and Yankees, The Boston Globe. Published April 2, 2009. Retrieved May 2, 2009. Jackson pitching for the Tigers in 2009 =Detroit Tigers (2009)= On December 10, 2008, Jackson was traded to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for outfielder Matt Joyce. Jackson made his Tigers debut on April 7, 2009, against the Toronto Blue Jays. He allowed one run in 7⅓ innings, and received a no decision in Detroit's 5–4 loss. He earned his first victory with Detroit on April 18 against the Seattle Mariners, pitching 7⅔ scoreless innings. Jackson was selected to represent Detroit in the 2009 All-Star Game along with teammates Curtis Granderson, Justin Verlander, and Brandon Inge. He pitched a scoreless fifth inning for the AL, retiring Yadier Molina, Ryan Zimmerman, and Hanley Ramírez on four pitches. At the end of July, opposing batters were hitting .216 against him, which was the lowest batting average in the league; he was followed by Matt Garza (.222), Jarrod Washburn (.224), and Scott Feldman (.228). =Arizona Diamondbacks (2010)= On December 9, 2009, Jackson was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks as part of a three team trade that brought Austin Jackson, Phil Coke, Max Scherzer, and Daniel Schlereth to the Tigers. Jackson hit his second Major League home run off Jack Taschner against the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 11, 2010. On June 25, 2010, Jackson no-hit his former team, the Tampa Bay Rays, 1–0, at Tropicana Field, becoming the first pitcher to no-hit a former team since Philadelphia Phillie Terry Mulholland no-hit the San Francisco Giants in 1990. It was only the second no-hitter in Diamondbacks' history, the other being Randy Johnson's perfect game on May 18, 2004, as well as the fourth of the 2010 season, and the third time the Rays had been no-hit in less than 12 months. Jackson's 149-pitch performance included eight walks and a hit batter, and was aided by the defensive performances of Mark Reynolds, Tony Abreu, and Adam LaRoche (whose second- inning home run accounted for the game's only run). Jackson became the first German-born pitcher to throw a no-hitter, the first African American to do so since Dwight Gooden in 1996, and the first African American to do so for a National League team since Bob Gibson in 1971. =Chicago White Sox (2010-2011)= On July 30, 2010, the Diamondbacks traded Jackson to the Chicago White Sox for Daniel Hudson and David Holmberg. When the Diamondbacks traded Jackson to the White Sox he became the first pitcher in the Majors to be traded away in the same season that he pitched a no-hitter since Cliff Chambers pitched a no-hitter for the Pittsburgh Pirates against the Boston Braves in 1951. =St. Louis Cardinals (2011)= Jackson during the 2011 World Series victory parade On July 27, 2011, Jackson was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays with Mark Teahen for Jason Frasor and Zach Stewart. The Blue Jays then traded Jackson to the St. Louis Cardinals later that day, along with Octavio Dotel, Marc Rzepczynski and Corey Patterson for Colby Rasmus, P. J. Walters, Trever Miller and Brian Tallet. On July 29, 2011, Edwin Jackson pitched his first game as a Cardinal and threw 7 strong innings, leading St. Louis to a blowout win over their rivals the Chicago Cubs. Over 13 regular-season appearances for St. Louis in 2011, Jackson pitched 78 innings in which he struck out 51 batters and walked 23. He allowed 91 hits and 37 runs (31 earned) to accrue a regular-season ERA of 3.58 with the Cardinals. In four postseason starts during St. Louis' successful march to the 2011 World Championship, Jackson posted a 5.60 ERA, issuing 19 hits, nine bases on balls and 11 runs (all earned), including four home runs, over 17⅔ innings. Jackson declined a one-year salary arbitration offer from the Cardinals for the 2012 season, becoming a free agent in December 2011. =Washington Nationals (2012)= On February 2, 2012, Jackson agreed to a one-year contract with the Nationals. The contract was reported to be worth $11 million and to contain incentive bonuses for achievements such as postseason awards. Jackson went 10–11 with the Nationals with an ERA of 4.03. He became a free agent after the Nationals elimination from the playoffs. =Chicago Cubs (2013–2015)= On January 2, 2013, Jackson signed a 4-year, $52 million contract with the Chicago Cubs. On April 14, he along with Michael Bowden broke the record for most wild pitches in an inning, with 5. He finished the year 8–18 with a 4.98 ERA. The 2014 season was even more dismal for Jackson. He finished the season with a 6–15 record, a 6.33 ERA over 140⅔ IP, and allowed opponents a .302 against him. Over the course of his final 9 starts, Jackson posted a 1–6 record with a 9.95 ERA. His final start against the Los Angeles Dodgers saw him give up 5 earned runs in just ⅔ of an inning, leading to his subsequent demotion to the bullpen for the remainder of the year. Jackson entered 2015 competing for a spot in the starting rotation with Travis Wood, but lost after giving up 9 earned runs in 16.1 innings. He began the season as the long reliever in the Cubs bullpen. On July 19, the Cubs designated him for assignment. On July 27, the Cubs released Jackson, eating the $13 million remaining on his contract. The team also owed him the same amount through the 2016 season. =Atlanta Braves (2015)= On August 14, Jackson signed a contract with the Atlanta Braves for the remainder of the 2015 season. He made his first appearance with the Braves the next day. Jackson recorded his first career save in relief of Matt Wisler on October 4, 2015, the final day of the season. =Miami Marlins (2016)= On January 13, 2016, Jackson signed a one- year contract for $507,500 with the Miami Marlins. He was designated for assignment on May 31, 2016, when the team activated Mike Dunn from the disabled list. =San Diego Padres (2016)= After signing a minor-league contract with the Padres in June 2016, Jackson was called up and made his first start as a Padre on July 17, 2016. =Baltimore Orioles (2017)= Jackson with the Orioles in 2017 On April 5, 2017, Jackson signed a minor- league contract with the Orioles. He was called up to the Orioles from AAA Norfolk on June 7, 2017. Jackson was designated for assignment on June 11 and elected free agency two days later. =Return to Washington (2017–2018)= On June 16, 2017, Jackson signed a minor-league contract with the Nationals, making this his second stint with the franchise. After several outings with the Class-AAA Syracuse Chiefs, allowing just one earned run in 20⅓ innings of work, Jackson was promoted to the Nationals' major league roster to take injured starter Joe Ross' rotation spot for a July 18 start against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Jackson earned the 4–3 win, spinning seven innings of three-hit ball and allowing his only runs on solo home runs by Mike Trout and Martín Maldonado, and manager Dusty Baker said he would continue starting for Washington. He resigned a minor-league contract on January 11, 2018. He was assigned to AAA Syracuse Chiefs for the 2018 season. On June 1, 2018, the Nationals released Jackson from his minor-league contract after he opted out. =Oakland Athletics (2018)= Jackson signed a minor-league contract with the Oakland Athletics on June 6, 2018, and was assigned to the AAA Nashville Sounds. He was called up to start for the Athletics on June 25, tying a Major League record of having played for thirteen different teams. Jackson earned his 100th career victory on July 30, 2018 in a 10-1 win over the Blue Jays. =Toronto Blue Jays (2019)= On May 11, 2019, Jackson was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for cash considerations. On May 15, 2019, Jackson made a start against the San Francisco Giants, becoming the first player ever to play for 14 different teams in MLB. Jackson posted an 11.12 ERA through eight games (five starts). On July 16, 2019, he was designated for assignment. On July 20, 2019, Jackson was released. = Return to Detroit (2019)= On July 22, 2019, Jackson signed a minor-league contract with the Detroit Tigers and assigned him to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. In two starts for the Mud Hens, Jackson allowed five earned runs on 11 hits in innings, two strikeouts and four walks. On August 9, the Tigers selected Jackson's contract from the Mud Hens and promoted him to the majors. Jackson became a free agent following the 2019 season. = Return to Arizona (2020) = On February 2, 2020, Jackson signed a minor-league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He was released in late May. Pitching style Jackson is one of a minority of MLB starting pitchers who relies almost exclusively on two pitches, a mid-90s fastball and an effective power slider. His four-seam fastball has good velocity, averaging about 95 mph. He also has a two-seamer with similar velocity. His primary weapon against right-handed hitters is a hard slurve in the upper 80s. Against left-handed hitters, he often uses a changeup (85–89) and occasionally a curveball (78–81).

He was an intelligent, charismatic and devious character, but was also seen as a hero especially by many of the citizens of Montana. Early life Fritz Augustus Heinze was born in Brooklyn, New York, to wealthy parents, Otto Heinze, a Jewish immigrant from Germany and Lida Lacey, an immigrant from Ireland. He was very bright and had a good education in Germany (from 9 to 15 years of age)George Redmond, \\"Stock Market Operators\\", 1999, Financial Times/Prentice Hall, London, and at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute (now part of NYU) and was fluent in various languages. He then graduated from Columbia University's School of Mines, New York, in 1889. Instead of undertaking further studies in Germany, as his father wished, he headed west to Colorado and Salt Lake City to pursue his interest in mining.Michael P Malone, \\"The Battle for Butte – Mining and Politics on the Northern Frontier, 1864–1906\\", 2006, University of Washington Press, Seattle, Washington, Mining interests in Montana Heinze went to Butte, Montana, in 1889 as a mining engineer for the Boston and Montana Company. He became known for his hard drinking and fun-loving antics in Butte's saloons and gambling dens, whilst donning society dress and having a shy demeanor and polished manners that impressed the ladies. Assisted by an inheritance of $50,000 from his recently deceased father, Heinze revelled in working hard to be a significant player.Plain-Dealer (Cleveland), 5th Nov 1914, \\"Copper King Dies, leaving Millions\\" In 1894, Heinze's Montana Ore Purchasing Company opened a sophisticated new smelter, allowing Heinze to offer low-priced smelting to small mining companies. Originally, Heinze had to lease mines and secure ore from independent companies in order to keep operating. Heinze was able to locate rich ore bodies and the Rarus Mine, purchased in 1895, turned out to be one of Butte's premier mining properties.Northwest Digital Archives (NWDA), \\"Guide to the Montana Ore Purchasing Company Records 1900–1910\\", Retrieved 2011-03-10 Heinze had arrived in Butte well after the \\"Copper Kings\\", William A. Clark and Marcus Daly were well established, (Daly's company was the Anaconda and later, the massive Amalgamated Copper Mining Company [after the sale to William Rockefeller and Henry H. Rogers of Standard Oil], later renamed the Anaconda Copper Mining Company). In order to catch up, Heinze's strategies included reducing the working day for his miners from ten to eight hours and the miner's considered him a hero. One of the mining laws directed that an owner could mine the veins that outcropped on his claim, and follow them underground beneath claims owned by others. This was known as the law of the apex, and Heinze maintained that his miners had the right to take out copper ore from beneath his neighbors. Using this law to his advantage Heinze would employ up to 30 lawyers at a time and tie up his opponents in the legal system with case after case. With skillful political maneuverings, Heinze would also ensure that \\"friendly\\" people were appointed as judges in Montana. In one incident, a \\"pretty girl\\" was found to have offered a judge $100,000 and Heinze was implicated but never charged. Heinze also became a brilliant orator, and in speeches to the miners and public he would paint the Amalgamated Company as a ruthless and oppressive organisation. In 1902, Heinze combined his various mining interests into a company called United Copper Company, valued at $80 millionAnaconda Standard, 7 Jun 1901, \\"Heinze's New Company\\"Anaconda Standard, 27 Apr 1902, \\"Heinze forms a Syndicate\\" with capacity to produce 40 million pounds of copper a year, compared to 143 million a year produced by Amalgamated. In 1903, frustrated when the Rarus property was subject to a court order to cease mining, Heinze's miners moved down anyway from the Rarus into an adjoining Amalgamated property. Before being stopped, Heinze succeeded in taking out a hundred thousand tons of high grade copper ore. There was hand-to-hand combat with Amalgamated miners, opposition mine shafts were fouled through burning rubber and spreading caustic slaked lime, grenades were thrown, and high pressure hoses were fired. Dynamite was also set off, caving in the property and completely obliterating all the evidence. Heinze was charged with contempt of court yet he was fined only $20,000. The actions of Heinze had severely hampered the giant Amalgamated Company. In 1906, after a decade of the mining war, John D Ryan negotiated with Heinze for Heinze to sell his Butte interests to Amalgamated for a reported $12 million.Philadelphia Inquirer, 14 Feb 1906, \\"Heinze Sells Out; Copper War Over\\" His mining days in Butte, Montana, had come to an end but Heinze had amassed a fortune. Heinze's role in The Panic of 1907 In 1907, Heinze moved to New York to be a major player, this time in the financial arena. He based his company, United Copper, at 42 Broadway, just around the corner from Wall Street. Heinze entered the banking business, forming a close alliance with Charles W. Morse with whom he served on at least six national banks, ten state banks, five trust companies and four insurance companies. Across the corridor from Heinze were his brothers Otto and Arthur P Heinze who had a brokerage firm. It was Otto that formulated the ill-fated financial ploy in October 1907 that dramatically failed and was a major catalyst that caused America's massive financial collapse, called \\"The Panic of 1907\\".Robert F Bruner and Sean D Carr, \\"The Panic of 1907 – Lessons Learned from the Market's Perfect Storm\\", 2007, John Wiley and Sons, Hoboken, New Jersey, Otto's plan was to aggressively purchase the stock of United Copper. The price would soar high. Then, with prices high, and Otto controlling most of the stock, he would force the short-sellers to repay the borrowed stock. The short-sellers would have no option but to settle with Otto for high prices. But Otto overestimated how much of the company the family controlled. When he forced the borrowers to buy back stock they were able to get it from other sources. When the market realized his 'corner' had failed, the stock price of United Copper collapsed. From there panic spread, as people pulled money out of banks associated with Heinze, and then from trust companies associated with those banks. Heinze had eventually supported his brother's ploy and due to his heavy involvement in the financial system suffered great financial and personal losses. He was barred from any further involvement in financial institutions. The Panic of 1907 was one of the most significant financial crises in American history. There had been several contributing factors, such as the huge cost of the devastating 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but it was the actions of the Heinze brothers that had caused much of the panic. The 1907 crash eventually lead to the formation of the US Federal Reserve System in 1913.David Fettig, \\"F. Augustus Heinze of Montana and the Panic of 1907\\", The Region, The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Aug 1989, Retrieved 2011-03-11 =Charges against Heinze= In 1908, Heinze was indicted for his role in the corner, and there were a string of court cases that lasted for years in the New York courts.Philadelphia Inquirer, 6 Jan 1910, \\"Here and There About New York – Augustus Heinze under Charge of Morse-like Use of Bank Funds\\"Gillette News, 5 May 1910, \\"F. Augustus Heinze Goes Free\\" However, a series of fortunate incidents in the courts led to his full exoneration. When Heinze returned to Butte after his exoneration \\"His arrival was a monumental event. Reception committees met his train ... A lively band and an automobile procession of his followers paraded into town ... A large rope was attached to the wagon tongue so more men could assist in pulling their hero.\\"Sarah McNelis, \\"Copper King at War\\", 1968, University of Montana Press, Missoula One of the more exciting stories is that of the missing financial records for United Copper. In June 1909, Heinze, his brother Arthur P Heinze, and Carlos Warfield (President of the Ohio Copper Company) were indicted for spiriting away the books and correspondence of United Copper.Oregonian, 16 Jun 1909, \\"Heinzes are indicted\\" Secret service men trailed the United Copper men with their luggage trunks full of company books. The trunks journeyed from New York to New Jersey and back and then one of the men tried to take a trunk to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, but the railway baggage man would not accept the 378 pounds trunk. The trunks were eventually found in a basement on West Fifty-Fifth Street in New York. Two further trunks were missing but Heinze promised to the judge that he would find them!Anaconda Standard, 21 Jul 1909, \\"On a Warm Trail leading to Quarry\\" After the hiding of the books, the directors of the United Copper Company rebelled against Heinze but on the day before he was to be removed, he replaced the board of directors instead.The New York Times, 3 Jun 1909, \\"Heinze Puts out his Old Directors\\" Heinze was also charged with assaulting a cab driver in New York but the judge dismissed the case agreeing with Heinze that the cab driver had charged too high a fee. Part of Heinze's defense was that just because the cab driver was smaller than him, that did not mean that he may not have a good punch and Heinze felt he had to punch him first.Pawtucket Times, 30 Apr 1909, \\"Heinze cleared – Chauffer's Charges of Disorderly Conduct and Assault Dismissed\\" Mining interests in Utah Just prior to the tumultuous events of 1907, Heinze's interests had turned to the mines of Bingham Canyon, south-west of Salt Lake City, Utah. Heinze purchased a controlling interest in the Bingham Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company and the Ohio Copper Company.Salt Lake Telegram, 4 Dec 1906, \\"Becomes Heinze Holding\\" Unfortunately while Heinze fought his many charges in the courts, the operations struggled for fundingAnaconda Standard, 25 Oct 1910, \\"Ohio Copper\\" and Heinze's involvement in Utah eventually proved to be more as an impediment than as a saviour. The mining operation and mills of all the companies at Bingham were located in the narrow Bingham Canyon, including Ohio's small 150 ton/day Winnamuck mill. The story went that the canyon was so narrow that for a dog to wag his tail in the canyon the dog had to wag it up and down, not side to side. =The Mascotte Tunnel= Due to the location of the underground mines, the Ohio Copper Company sought to have an advantage over its opponents by transporting the ore from the mines to a mill (with planned capacity of 3000 ton/day) which they would build at the township of Lark, outside the canyon. The transporting of the ore could only be done by way of a tunnel. Expansion of the existing Dalton & Lark tunnel started in 1907.Deseret, 9 Feb 1907, \\"Ohio's New Mill\\" The three-mile long tunnel was called the Mascotte Tunnel after an early director of the Dalton & Lark company.Don Stack, \\"To Move a Mountain\\", UtahRails.Net, Nov 2010, Retrieved 2011-03-12 The Mascotte tunnel was owned by Bingham Consolidated, a company that was heading towards bankruptcy.Salt Lake Telegram, 24 Jun 1908, \\"Bingham Con. In Bankruptcy Court\\" Heinze was never one to miss an opportunity and Bingham Consolidated (with Heinze as a major stockholder) sold the tunnel (still unfinished) to the Bingham Central Railway Company (a company owned wholly by Heinze) for $150,000.Salt Lake Telegram, 23 Feb 1910, \\"Bingham Mines Co. Issues its First Annual Statement \\"Anaconda Standard, 13 Jun 1911, \\"Heinze in Control of the Ohio Copper\\" With this transaction, Heinze had gained sole ownership of the only route that would one day link the Ohio Copper Company's mines and its mill. When the tunnel was completed in March 1909, the General Manager, Colin McIntosh, said: \\"It was one of the most difficult pieces of surveying in the state and the men who did it without being an inch out of the way, cannot be given too much praise.\\"Deseret Evening News, 10 Mar 1909, \\"Upraise at Ohio Meets the Shaft\\" Heinze visited Salt Lake City for the first time since 1906 to inspect the facilities. He was greeted with much joy by the miners, many of whom had worked for Heinze in Montana.

An unnamed director said in an interview that \\"Should Mr. Heinze at any time deny it use of the Mascotte tunnel, it would be left without access to its own mill except by devious and expensive methods. ... it is the consensus of opinion that he is slightly too cagey to permit pass the opportunity to insure himself a commanding position over Ohio Copper ...\\".Anaconda Standard, 27 Jul 1909, \\"Heinze's Position Causes Much Talk\\" John D Ryan (who had negotiated the deal with Heinze in Montana) and Thomas F Cole from Amalgamated Copper offered to purchase the Ohio Copper Company from Heinze. However, they made the offer on the proviso that the Mascotte tunnel was part of the deal. Heinze refused.Anaconda Standard, 22 May 1910, \\"Mystery in Offer by Heinze People\\" In December 1910 there was growing concern about the running of the Ohio Copper Company. Large shareholders were reportedly dissatisfied with the Heinze management and felt the company's earnings were not sufficient to satisfy creditors, who were asking for settlement of their claims. The Bingham Central Railway Company was charging the Ohio Copper Company 15 cents for each ton of ore transported through the Mascotte tunnel earning Heinze around $200–300 per day.Anaconda Standard, 7 Sep 1913, \\"About the Trouble of Heinze's Ohio\\" =Heinze's departure= The Steven's Copper Handbook, 1911, said of Heinze: > The United Copper company is operated as a blind pool by F Augustus Heinze, > who has shown himself utterly rapacious, unscrupulous and conscienceless in > his mining and financial operations. About one-third of the common stock is > held in Holland, and the unfortunate Dutch investors were endeavoring June, > 1911, to obtain some explicit information regarding the company's affairs > ... the United Copper Company can be considered only as an exceptionally > daring piece of stock jobbery.Horace J Stevens (compiled and published), > \\"The Copper Handbook – A Manual of the Copper Industry of the World, Vol X, > 1911\\", Houghton, Michigan, 1911, Retrieved 2011-03-11 In February 1913 the United Copper Company was placed into receivership, so its assets (including Ohio Copper) could be unwound.Anaconda Standard, 11 Feb 1913, \\"Receivers Appointed for United Copper\\" In mid-1914, at an acrimonious shareholders meeting, control of the Ohio Copper Company passed from Heinze to William O Allison, President of the company.Chicago Tribune, 1 Jun 1914Chicago Tribune, 3 Jul 1914, \\"Ohio Copper Company\\" Payments that had been due had not been met and Heinze claimed that this was due to his ongoing legal costs. Following Heinze's departure, the Bingham Central Railway Company (Mascotte tunnel) was rolled into the new Ohio Copper Company and the combined company was named the Ohio Copper Mining Company of Utah, which operated until 1951.Utah State Historical Society, \\"The Ohio Copper Mining Company-Bingham Central Railway Records, 1871-1951\\" , Archived copy Retrieved 2011-03-11 The properties of Ohio Copper are now part of the massive Bingham Canyon Mine.

In the Korean independence movement In September 1919, Rhee was imprisoned for 18 months in Daegu Prison by the Japanese colonial authorities for his leadership role in the March 1st (Samil) Movement and other Korean Independence activities in Daegu. Torture by the Japanese police resulted in permanent hearing loss in one ear. As a pastor In 1923, Rhee attended Kobe Theological Seminary (神戶神學校) in Kobe, Japan. He returned to Korea and began Christian ministry in 1927 at Daegu Seomoon Presbyterian Church, where he became an ordained minister. Although popular as pastor and well known for his stirring sermons, Rhee was drawn to serving the least fortunate around him. He embarked on his lifelong journey of social work and ministry by serving as pastor at a leper treatment center in Daegu. After Korean independence from Japan in 1945, Rhee expanded his social work by looking after orphans and handicapped children. In 1946, Rhee founded the Daegu School for the Blind, the first special education school founded by a Korean. (The very first special education school in Korea, Pyongyang School for the Deaf and Blind, was founded by Rosetta Sherwood Hall, a medical missionary and educator from the U.S., in 1894. In 1913, the Japanese occupation government established the Seoul School for the Blind). When the devastating Korean War (1950–1953) resulted in increased number of war-orphans and the handicapped, Reverend Rhee was among the few who were devoted to helping them. The orphanage housed many handicapped children—who were clothed, fed and taught skills that would help them eventually leave the orphanage and live independently. Reverend Rhee ministered to the children's spiritual and emotional needs, as well as raising funds, eliciting donations and recruiting volunteer teachers and doctors. Founding of Daegu University Rhee saw the need to train special education teachers and social workers in addition to furthering the education of handicapped students who had special talents. In 1956, he founded the Korea Social Work School in Daegu. The school became a formal college in 1961. In recognition for the decades of invaluable contributions made by Rhee, South Korean president Park Chung-hee personally awarded him the 5.16 Minjok National Medal (5·16 민족상 교육부문 본상) in May 1969. Korea Social Work College, founded in 1961, became Daegu University in 1981. Rhee was president from 1961 to 1982. Daegu University installed the first Braille library in Korea in 1981, and the university continues its tradition of being in the forefront of social welfare and special education in Korea. Work in the Mariana Islands During the 1970s and 1980s, Rhee traveled extensively to the Mariana Islands in the Pacific where many Korean laborers were forced to work under the Japanese military during the Japanese expansion before and during World War II. Reverend Rhee discovered decades-old burial sites of Korean laborers deep in the jungles of Tinian and repatriated the remains to a national cemetery in Korea (National Cemetery for Overseas Koreans 국립망향의 동산 태평양 사이판 티니안 전몰 무명한국인묘). He also founded a group that erected a Korean Peace Memorial in the island of Saipan (Korean Peace Memorial at Malpi Point, Saipan) and in Tinian (Korean Monuments on Tinian), in remembrance of thousands of Korean laborers who died in those islands. In 1977, Rhee was awarded the Order of Merit for National Foundation by the South Korean government in recognition for his role in Korean independence. Rhee died of natural causes in Tumon, Guam, in 1981 at age 87.

They are small squid which can be found in the epipelagic to mesopelagic zones while some species are found in water with shallow substrates on steep slopes on the boundary of the mesopelagic zone. They are distinguished from other members of the Enoploteuthidae by not normally having large, black photophores at the tips of arms IV, although if these are present they are not covered in black chromatophores, and having fins which extend beyond their tail. The photophores of the integument are characteristicand are found in the three types . \\"Lensed\\" photophores are a blue color with a white ring, \\"simple\\" photophores are small and violet- colored and the \\"complex\\" photophores are surrounded by small green satellite points and have a green centre. The complex photophores will frequently appear to be blue depending on their physiological state. The integument also has small black chromatophores which look like dots. They have 5-12 variably sized photophores on the eye. Either the right or left arm IV is hectocotylized. Abralia is the most speciose genus in the Enoploteuthidae and is normally divided in to six subgenera, however, recent studies suggest that these may not form natural groupings. They have worldwide distribution in tropical and subtropical seas. They spend the day at depths below 600m and at night they move to less than 200m in depth.

ZET (tr. Zagreb Electric Tramways, the city public transportation company), ordered 70 vehicles in 2003 after Crotram consortium won the tender on the ground of lower price, competing with offers by Siemens (Combino) and AnsaldoBreda (Sirio). The first batch of vehicles was delivered, as the contract requested, from May 2005 until June 2007. Satisfied with the quality of the trams, ZET ordered another 70 vehicles in mid-2007, which are due to be delivered by May 2009. All 140 vehicles ordered by ZET are 32 m long, 5-part version, but ZET have also announced a purchase of 60 shorter (3-part, about 21 m long) trams of this type. The price of the second batch is €130 million (€1.85 m. per vehicle) and is somewhat higher than price for the initial 70 ordered in 2003 (€112 million). However, due to lower production costs the increased price is still very competitive compared to other European equivalents, which are priced up to €2.5 million each per similar vehicle. Other transport companies also have been interested. International interest in purchasing the TMK 2200 series tramway exists. Although Croatian press articles have suggested many operators being seriously interested in the TMK 2200, the more concrete arrangements so far have been: * Łódź Regional Tram project, for which the Crotram won on public tendering, but it was eventually annulled and Polish Pesa won the repeated tender, * In September 2006 an arrangement was made with Belgrade authorities to bring one tram for trial, but the arrangement failed, * In 2007 HKL (Helsinki City Transport), Helsinki, Finland showed interest for the TMK 2200. Končar sent one of ZETs vehicles (Nr. 2263) to Helsinki on 5 December 2007 and later submitted an offer in the initial round of HKL's tender process for 40 new trams. However, Končar was not selected for the second round and the board of HKL decided on 2 December 2010 to order 40 new articulated trams from the Finnish manufacturer Transtech Oy.Helsingin kaupungin liikennelaitos The final selection was made between Bombardier, CAF and Transtech. In test service the TMK 2200 received various criticisms and ultimately HKL decided to acquire trams with a more conventional bogie design, * In 2008 authorities of Zagreb agreed with authorities of Sofia, Bulgaria to bring one of vehicles for trial. In October 2008 vehicle no. 2282 was sent to Sofia, * In 2009 Crotram participated in tender for 30 new trams for Belgrade, but the city decided in favour of CAF Urbos.  Technical  The tram is 32 meters long, with three bogeyed and two fully suspended articulated sections, but the modular construction allows longer and shorter versions using the same design of the sections. Wider body and standard gauge versions will also be available for construction. The tram is entirely guided by synchronous computers. Suspension and articulations are run by hydraulics.

From that day on he immersed himself in music, practicing upwards of four hours a day. He took guitar lessons for a while but became dissatisfied with local guitar instructors and decided to become self-taught. He relied on instructional books and videos like Doug Marks's Metal Method, Ted Greene's Chord Chemistry and Modern Chord Progressions books, REH instructional videos, and Robben Ford's instructional DVDs. His early musical influences were guitarists Randy Rhoads, Yngwie Malmsteen, Steve Vai, Paul Gilbert, Vinnie Moore and Tony MacAlpine. After only three years of playing, he became a guitar teacher at the music store where he had purchased his first guitar. After high school Cooley went to the local college and studied music theory. Solo work Cooley was unsatisfied with local musicians and began to work on solo music in early 1996. He began playing seven-string guitars exclusively at this time. His debut solo album was the self-titled Rusty Cooley, released in 2003 by Lion Music. It consists of 12 tracks, one of which, \\"Under the Influence\\", was released as a video as well. The album featured Cooley on guitar, Brent Marches on bass, Eric Sands on fretless bass, and Bobby Williamson on keyboards. Music was by Cooley, Marches, and Kelly Carpenter; Carpenter also wrote the lyrics for, and handled the vocals on, the vocal versions of \\"Dominion\\" and \\"The Machine\\". Programming was done by Cooley and Williamson, while guitar engineering was done by Sands. Cooley also was in charge of production.  Track listing  Currently Cooley has collaborated with ProTone Pedals, testing their new Jason Becker Perpetual Burn Signature distortion pedal, as Becker himself has suffered from ALS since 1990, and as such, is no longer able to play guitar. ProTone Pedals has posted several videos of Cooley testing prototype versions of the pedal on YouTube . One of these video features a comment from Cooley himself, citing Becker as one of his biggest influences and stating that working on the pedal was something he considered an honor. ProTone has more recently been working on a Rusty Cooley Signature pedal. Cooley has collaborated with Dean Guitars to produce a signature seven-string model, of which several versions exist. Cooley's lead work was featured on Arnold Schwarzenegger-themed parody metal band Austrian Death Machine's second album, Double Brutal. Cooley is currently working with a new band, Day of Reckoning.Day of Reckoning Teaching Cooley has been a guitar instructor since his third year of playing. He has released five instructional products, done lessons for magazines (such as his \\"Metal Guru\\" column) and posted many lessons on sites such as Shredaholic. He has taught for the National Guitar Workshop three times (1996, 1997, 1998) and given many clinics. Cooley has many successful students, such as Chris Storey/Cris Osuna (ex-All Shall Perish) and Mica Roth, former member of Hybreed. Endorsements Currently Cooley endorses Ormsby Guitars, EMG Pickups, Morley Pedals, GHS strings, VHT, Rocktron, Eventide, Maxon and more recently Randall Amplification. He previously endorsed Jackson Guitars, Ibanez Guitars and Dean Guitars. His signature Dean model was released at NAMM in early 2007. It features a super-strat style body with a deeply sculpted lower horn (in order to perform the widest stretches when playing in high positions), EMG 707 pickups, volume control and a three-way switch.

Heightened competition from this phenomenon has led to the emergence of other advertising strategies, including guerrilla marketing, viral marketing, and experiential marketing along with new focuses on humanising messaging within marketing.

Daytona State College is accredited to award associate and bachelor's degrees by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.  History  The Florida Legislature authorized Daytona Beach Junior College as one of Floridas first comprehensive colleges in 1957. Its three divisions - college credit, adult education, and the Mary Karl Vocational School - functioned as separate entities under Volusia County Schools, although they all were administered by the colleges president. Volusia County Junior College was founded simultaneously as a school for African Americans; at its inception Daytona Beach was all-white (at the time there were no integrated colleges in the state). Following the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Volusia was closed in 1965, and its students were given the option of enrolling at Daytona Beach. Those who did found an unhospitable atmosphere, and while 450 students transferred in 1965-66, black enrollment in 1966-67 was under 100.Walter L. Smith, The Magnificent Twelve: Florida's Black Junior Colleges, Winter Park, Florida, FOUR-G Publishers, 1994, , p. 148. In 1968, the Florida Legislature combined Daytona Beach Junior Colleges divisions into a single administrative unit under a District Board of Trustees independent of Volusia County Schools. In 1971, the college was renamed Daytona Beach Community College. Daytona Beach Community College became a four-year college in 2006, when it offered its first bachelor's degree, the Bachelor of Applied Science in Supervision and Management. In 2008, the college was renamed as Daytona Beach College, then a month later renamed as Daytona State College, reflecting its transition to a four-year institution offering workforce baccalaureate degrees.

It has been the Massachusetts Minutemen football team's home stadium since 1965, with the exception of 2012 and 2013, when the team played at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough. From 2014 to 2018, the Minutemen split their home dates between McGuirk and Gillette. McGuirk Stadium is also home to the UMass Minutewomen lacrosse team. Originally known as Alumni Stadium, the facility was renamed in 1984 to honor Warren P. McGuirk, who was the UMass athletic director from 1948 to 1971. Although it is on the university's campus, which is almost entirely in Amherst, the stadium itself lies just across the town line in Hadley. History By 1960, the growth of the University and its burgeoning football program made the construction of a new sports facility a top priority. From the beginning, the stadium was conceived as a multi-purpose facility which could be used for other sports as well as for ceremonial occasions. A sweeping concrete structure whose bold curves and open space express and exploit the vocabulary of its material, McGuirk Stadium was the first major concrete stadium to be built in the Northeast since 1920. One unusual feature is its raised design: the lowest seats in the stands are more than off the ground. Replacing Alumni Field, the stadium hosted its first game on September 25, 1965, with UMass beating American International College, 41–0. The stadium was officially dedicated on October 16, 1965, when UMass defeated Rhode Island, 30–7, in a homecoming contest. The first sellout came on November 6, 1965, as Massachusetts hosted Holy Cross in front of 17,400 spectators. On October 22, 1966, McGuirk held its largest attendance of 18,700 for the contest between Massachusetts and Boston University. The most recent sellout at the stadium was on September 27, 2014, with a shootout loss against MAC foe Bowling Green, 47–42. The stadium is also the site of UMass Amherst graduation ceremonies, and hosted the 1987 NCAA women’s soccer championship. On April 10, 2009, an Amherst resident fell from the stadium in what police believe was a suicide. UMass now plays in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). McGuirk Stadium's current capacity is only modestly above the NCAA's requirement of 15,000 average attendance for FBS membership. The school upgraded its press box to meet NCAA requirements to bring some games back to campus, and upgraded its indoor training facilities.McGuirk Alumni Stadium - New Football Performance Center and Press & Skybox Complex. UMass Facilities and Campus Services. Retrieved December 31, 2014 Improvements McGuirk Stadium's permanent lights, installed August 2008 Lights were installed in the stadium for the 2008 football season, permitting UMass to play night games at home on a regular basis. The first game played under the permanent lights was the season opener on August 30, 2008, with UMass beating Albany 28-16. A video scoreboard was installed during the 2009 season. A new FieldTurf playing surface was installed in McGuirk Stadium for the 2014 football season. The plaza on the east side of the stadium behind the ticket gates, MinuteFan Park, hosts food and souvenir vendors and other exhibitors on game days. On April 20, 2011, the school officially accepted an invitation to become a football- only member of the Division I FBS Mid-American Conference. McGuirk Stadium was not considered suitable for FBS football, however. It would have been prohibitively difficult to meet the minimum FBS attendance of 15,000 fans per game, and its press box and replay facilities were well below MAC standards. Consequently, the 2011 season was the last at McGuirk Stadium before a major renovation project to upgrade it to FBS standards. For the 2012 and 2013 seasons, the Minutemen played all of their home games at the New England Patriots' home field, Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, east of UMass on the other side of the state. The renovation added a new training facility and locker rooms on the stadium's north end, called the Football Performance Center. The old press box was demolished, with a new box constructed to two levels with more TV and radio booths and added luxury suites. The cost of this construction was estimated at $20 million and was completed in time for the 2014 season at a cost of $34.5 million. Coaching staff and players took occupancy of the Football Performance Center in July 2014. The deal with Gillette Stadium called for UMass to play several games per year in Foxborough from 2014 through 2016, and left open the possibility for some games to be played on campus at McGuirk Stadium. One of the main reasons for this deal was the MAC's TV contract with ESPN typically scheduled a handful of MAC games to be played on Tuesday nights in October and November. If UMass were scheduled a home matchup for one of the weeknight games, the game could be played on campus, negating the need to bus students approximately 100 miles to and from Gillette Stadium late on a school night. In a 2012 email to the Maroon Musket, an independent magazine covering Minutemen football, athletic director John McCutcheon said once the new facilities are complete, the team intends to play at least one game at McGuirk Stadium until the license to play in Foxborough expired at the end of the 2016 season. McCutcheon also said that there were no plans to expand the stadium, although it would be the smallest stadium in the MAC and the second-smallest in FBS. The article incorrectly states that Dix Stadium is currently the smallest MAC stadium; four other stadiums are smaller. Although no plans to expand McGuirk had been formally announced, McCutcheon said in 2011 that \\"The seating expansion will involve lowering the ground level of the field, and adding 14 new rows of seating in the area created by the sunken turf.\\" On September 14, 2012, the UMass trustees approved a five-year, $3.1 billion capital plan. Included in the plan was $30 million to be spent renovating the stadium as part of the transition to FBS football play. Although construction on the renovations began in March 2013, an official groundbreaking ceremony was held on April 26, 2013, and completed in time for the 2014 season. In the summer of 2013, UMass secured the services of Perkins+Will to study various stadium expansion options to increase seating capacity; improve the overall structure and site amenities; and enhance the fan experience with improved concessions, restrooms, and fanfare amenities. The project team, consisting of Perkins+Will, UMass Athletics, UMass senior administration, and members of the Design & Construction Department, met over the course of four design charrettes to develop a series of improvement projects and build-out options for the existing stadium seating bowl and support facilities. The report was completed in the summer of 2013. Projects identified in the report included upgrading the existing stadium structure to improve accessibility; new restroom and concession areas support existing and increased seating capacities; addition of clubs and suites; south end zone seating; and the addition of an upper east grandstand seating structure. These improvements supported a stadium in the range of 30,000 – 35,000 seats. The combination of projects were studied with the existing east seating bowl left in place and renovated to current codes and the demolition and reconstruction of the east seating bowl. More recently, UMass secured the services of Perkins+Will to update the 2013 Stadium Expansion Study to support a stadium, required code improvements, and fan amenities in support of a stadium in the range of 20,000 to 25,000 seats with the ability to expand in the future. In May 2018, UMass received a $5.58 million pledge from alumnus Martin Jacobson to fund experiential improvements to the stadium. The pledge provides the support necessary to design and construct a seasonal air-supported indoor structure and contribute to a high-definition scoreboard at McGuirk Alumni Stadium, among other planned fan experience facility improvements. Construction was slated to begin at the conclusion of the 2018 football season, with a formal timeline for completion to be established as the final scope for all the improvements within the project are determined.

It is a diverse approach to a question that, in many ways, drives our society.’ Horrorscope 'this slim volume features 11 disturbing, humiliating, gratifying, annoying and mind- blasting stories ... A brilliant debut collection.' Orb Magazine =Rynemonn (2007)= In 2007, coeur de lion published Rynemonn by Terry Dowling. Rynemonn was the final collection of Tom Rynosseros stories, concluding this popular saga begun in Rynosseros (first published by Aphelion Publications, an independent Australian publisher, in 1990, and reprinted by Mirrodanse Books in 2003) and continued in Blue Tyson (Aphelion Publications 1992), and Twilight Beach (Aphelion Publications 1993).

Rynemonn also contained four previously unpublished Tom stories, the linking narrative 'Doing the Line' and 'Swordplay', 'Tesserina and The Target Man' and 'The Bull of September'. Reviews for Rynemonn included: 'Noted Australian wordsmith Dowling brings a close to the adventures of Tom Rynosseros in this collection of 11 stories, three original, with extensive bridging material. \\"This is the conclusion to the best and most ambitious Australian SF series ever written, and one of the best, ever – period.\\" ' Locus and Australian SF Reader Terry Dowling received the Peter McNamara award at the 2007 Aurealis Awards for excellence in speculative fiction in part due to the publication of Rynemonn. =X6 (2009)= In 2009, coeur de lion published X6 – a novellanthology featuring six all new novellas from six Australian speculative fiction authors: Margo Lanagan, Terry Dowling, Paul Haines, Louise Katz, Cat Sparks and Trent Jamieson. X6 was a finalist in the 2009 Aurealis Awards in the anthology/ collection category. Paul Haines's X6 novella 'Wives' won the 2009 Aurealis Awards for best horror short fiction and went on to win the 2009 Ditmar for best novella, the 2009 Sir Julius Vogel (NZ) Award for best novella, and made the James Tiptree Jr Literary Award honour list. Margo Lanagan's X6 novella 'Sea-Hearts' won the 2010 World Fantasy Award for best novella. X6 appeared on the Locus Magazine 2009 Recommended Reads list. The Aurealis Award Anthology and Collection judges said of X6, 'The strengths of the novella, a much-neglected genre of fiction, are shown to fine effect here in Keith Stevenson's un-themed anthology of six stories by some of Australia's most prominent speculative fiction writers. Fully using the capacity of a novella for deeper exploration of themes and characterisation, all six stories in this anthology are memorable, immersive and finely crafted. This is definitely speculative fiction on the literary side, ranging from sweetly poignant to darkly chilling.' Anthology and Collection Judges' Report Speaking about Paul Haines's X6 story 'Wives', the Aurealis Horror judges said it was, 'a cleverly crafted to force the reader to adjust from known parameters to the story's world, starting with a very simple image of a man in love with a girl in a country town, then, with hints and whispers, revealing that this world is not our own. The story is of a boy's coming of age as he tries desperately to assimilate his upbringing and his mother's values – that women are not simply property – within a society where property is everything. The real danger of the Australian values of mateship and mates before dates is shown in stark reality. The dialect and language are appropriate to the scene and set the distance between today's Australia and a future where we are more isolated and \\"countrified\\". It is a story of isolationism and the ease with which those who are cut off learn hate for \\"the other\\". It comments on the brutality of mutilation and the reaction of our protagonist when he discovers he has no pity or empathy, just bitter resentment for his own loss. It is a story of despair – a mother's despair and the despair of giving up hope when lovefails. This bleak story is haunting, and the 'realness' of this unreality is truly horrifying.' Horror Judges' Report The Australian Bookseller and Publisher magazine (November 2009) described X6 as 'a solid collection that will appeal to fans of Dreaming Down-Under and other recent anthologies.' =Anywhere but Earth (2011)= In 2011, coeur de lion published Anywhere but Earth an anthology of all new science fiction stories focusing on humanity's adventures out there, anywhere but Earth. Robert Stephenson's short story 'The Rains of La Strange' from the anthology won the Aurealis Award for science fiction short story. =ifbook:Australia 24 Hour Book Project (2012)= On 11–12 June, Stevenson was lead editor in the ifbook:Australia 24 Hour Book project. =Pyrotechnicon (2012)= 2012 also saw the publication of coeur de lion's first novel, Pyrotechnicon by Adam Browne, a picaresque outer space adventure penned by the almost legendary Cyrano De Bergerac. Hugo and Nebula award- winning science fiction author Greg Bear called Pyrotechnicon ‘A rich dessert of a novel, filled with finely crafted wit and adventure — Adam Browne has resurrected Cyrano in fine form. Delightful!’, while Jeff Vandermeer described it as, ‘a literary cabinet of curiosities filled with lush imagery and exotic notions. A delicious concoction of swashbucklery and delight. Highly recommended.’ Pyrotechnicon was launched officially at the Conflux 8 convention in Canberra. =Dimension6 speculative fiction magazine (2014)= Dimension6 was officially launched in April 2014 as a free and DRM-free Australian speculative fiction magazine distributed in epub an mobi (for Kindle) formats. Dimension6 was developed as a freely accessible platform to continue Stevenson's work of bringing outstanding original Australian speculative fiction to as broad an audience as possible. While essentially an Australian publication, D6 welcomes submissions from overseas authors as well. D6 is published three times a year and an omnibus edition, featuring all stories printed that year is available each November for $0.99.

The arena opened as a replacement for Keaney Gymnasium, which was built in 1953 for the needs of a much smaller student population at URI. It is home to the University of Rhode Island Rams basketball. The building is named for Thomas M. Ryan, Class of 1975, former CEO of Rhode Island-based CVS Pharmacy and lead benefactor of the arena. The $54 million center opened in June 2002. The first game in the arena was a women's basketball game against Kent State University on Nov. 22, 2002, and the first men's game was an upset win against USC on Nov. 26, 2002. The building is recognizable for its three corner towers, which were modeled after lighthouses. (The fourth corner would be where the building meets the Tootell Physical Education Center.) It stands directly next to Meade Stadium, and the original field house and west (visitor's side) grandstands were demolished to make way for the building. There are seven luxury boxes that can view both the basketball floor and the football stadium outside, and new grandstands were built in 2006. The women's basketball team won the first- ever regular season game in the Ryan Center 53-39 over Kent State on Nov. 22, 2002 and four days later the men made their official debut in the building with a 73-71 overtime upset over the University of Southern California. Ever since, the Ryan Center has been a hard place for opponents to play, with the men's team drawing a standing room only crowd of 8,121 against No. 2-ranked Pittsburgh in 2002, and the women's team setting its attendance record with 3,402 fans against St. Bonaventure on Jan. 16. Both the men's and women's teams more than doubled their attendance from the last year in Keaney Gymnasium. With the opening of the Ryan Center, URI was able to move all of its games on campus for the first time since the 1970s. The team had played occasional home games at the larger Dunkin' Donuts Center since 1973. The building Rhode Island lighthouses were the inspiration for the design of the three towers, marking the North and South entrances of The Ryan Center. The interior reflects the warm earth tones to mimic the surrounding beach community. Standing high and located on the University of Rhode Island campus in scenic South County the building is . The building also overlooks Meade Stadium, where the URI football team plays. The building serves as an indoor watching area, and has luxury boxes overlooking the field.

One of the most gifted followers of Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571–1610), Sellitto played an important role in the spread of Caravaggism to Naples and in the development away from Late Mannerism to a greater naturalism. The son of a painter and gilder, he was apprenticed briefly to the Piedmontese painter Giovanni Antonio Ardito (c. late 16th century–early 17th) before moving (c. 1591) to the studio of the Flemish painter Louis Croys. By 1608, at the age of 27 years, he had left Croys and had set up his own workshop in the Via Donnalbina, attracting to it such artists as Filippo Napoletano, Giovan Mattea Arciero (b 1591) and Francesco Abbenante (first decade of the 17th century). The talent for portraiture that Sellitto had shown while working with Croys brought him commissions from the court and aristocracy, although none of these documented works has been identified. Sellitto would have known Caravaggio during the artist's exile in Naples in 1606/1607, but the date indicates that this Baptist (illustrated) was painted several years previously - cf. Caravaggio's own treatment of the theme of John the Baptist. He died on 2 October 1614 after a brief 6-year independent career.

In 2007, the playing surface was named \\"Bob Lanier Court\\" in honor of former Bonnies and NBA great Bob Lanier, who led the Bonnies to the Final Four in 1970. It is the third- largest basketball arena in Western New York (behind the over 18,000 seats in KeyBank Center and the 6,100 seats in Alumni Arena at the University at Buffalo North Campus) and has the highest seating capacity of any sports venue in Cattaraugus County and the western Southern Tier. In 2001, the facility was named one of the five toughest places to play in college basketball by ESPN's Jay Bilas.

St. Bonaventure was assessed a technical foul, VCU tied it with a free throw, and then won in OT, 83–77.

Still, the league, while reprimanding the officials for their handling of the end of the game, upheld the technical foul because a young fan had run onto the court and bumped into an official while the ball was being inbounded.

They are also used to describe certain forms of incense. A pastille is also known as a troche, which is a medicated lozenge that dissolves like sweets. Origins The word pastille comes from the same origin as pastry, from the Latin word pastillus, for a lump of meal or grain, which was from panis, \\"bread\\". A pastille was originally a pill-shaped lump of compressed herbs, which was burnt to release its medicinal properties. Literary references to the burning of medicinal pastilles include the short story \\"The Birth-Mark\\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne, the poem \\"The Laboratory\\" by Robert Browning, and the novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë. They are also mentioned in the novel McTeague by Frank Norris, when the title character's wife burns them to mask an unpleasant odor in the couple's rooms. In Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon, \\"a half-filled package of violet pastilles\\" are among the items found in Joel Cairo's pockets. They were also widely used during the eighteenth century in Western cultures to take herbal curatives and medicines, which eventually were developed into sweets. Production Pastilles are made by pouring a thick liquid into a powdered, sugared, or waxed mold and then allowing the liquid to set and dry. The substances contained in the dried liquid are slowly released when chewed and allowed to dissolve in the mouth. The substances are then absorbed by the mucous membranes of the oral cavity or in the lower gastro-intestinal tracts. Various substances, be they of medicinal nature or for flavour, can be put into pastille forms. Due to the oily nature of these active substances (essential oils, tinctures and extracts), pastilles are usually based on a mixtures of starch and gum arabic, which emulsifies the substance and binds them in a hydrocolloidal matrix. The starch and gum also reduces the rate in which the pastille dissolves and moderates the amount of active substances delivered at a time. Gum arabic also hardens the pastilles and makes them more sturdy in storage and transport.

J. Palumbo Center, is a 4,406-seat multi-purpose arena in the Uptown area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania served by exits on both Interstate 376 and Interstate 579. The arena opened in 1988, and is part of Duquesne University. It is home to the Duquesne Dukes basketball, volleyball and wrestling programs. The center hosts concerts, boxing, and other special events, and is capable of converting the seating arrangement into a sport, stage, or theatre setup. The facility was named in honor of its benefactor, Antonio J. Palumbo, who was elected to the Duquesne University board of directors and, in 1987, received an honorary doctorate of Business and Administration from Duquesne. Performance Magazine, a concert trade magazine, has consistently ranked the Palumbo Center as one of the top 10 grossing arenas of its size since its opening in 1988. Facilities In 2006, the Palumbo Center underwent major renovations. In addition to resurfacing the basketball court, upgrading video monitors, and replacing some seating sections, the facility was updated and renovated to include: *New men's and women's basketball staff offices *Recruiting suite *Video breakdown room *Strength and conditioning facilities *Athletic trainer facilities The center houses the administrative offices for the athletic department and facility management. The center is also open to intramural sports and other recreation groups; however, in 2007, Duquesne University completed a new five- story recreational facility on Forbes Ave. near the A.J. Palumbo Center, which has now become the primary facility for recreational sports and activities. After the 2009-2010 basketball season, Duquesne University began major renovations on the Palumbo Center. A new center-hung scoreboard was installed as well as new corner scoreboards. In addition, then-current bleacher seating on the north end of the arena was replaced with permanent stadium chairs. The University also received $1.8 million in private donations to upgrade the locker rooms for the men's and women's basketball teams and the volleyball team. It was called the James and Janice Schaming Athletic Center, named after the largest donor. An even more extensive renovation began immediately after the 2018–19 basketball season. When the project is complete, expected at the start of the 2020–21 school year, the Palumbo Center will be renamed UPMC Cooper Fieldhouse. The new name stems from a partnership between the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the family foundation of late Duquesne star Chuck Cooper, the first African American selected in an NBA draft. The Palumbo name will be transferred to the main entrance and atrium area of the renovated facility. During the renovations, the Dukes will split home games between the UPMC Events Center at Robert Morris, PPG Paints Arena and La Roche University. Sports Prior to the building of the facility, the men's basketball team played games at various sites around the city, including Pittsburgh Civic Arena (their exclusive home from 1964 to 1988, and used for occasional big games until 2009), Fitzgerald Field House, and Duquesne Gardens, as well as several high school gymnasiums. The first men's basketball game was played in the arena on December 3, 1988, in which Duquesne defeated St. Joseph's 73-69. As of January 2008, Duquesne men's basketball had 132-125 (.514) all-time record at the Palumbo Center. The facility is used for most major sports at Duquesne, and has played host to NIT games, WNIT games, high school post season championships, national wrestling championships, and Atlantic 10 tournament competitions. During the 1994-95 basketball season, the Palumbo Center was the home of the Continental Basketball Association's Pittsburgh Piranhas. In the team's lone season in Pittsburgh, the Piranhas lost to the Yakima Sun Kings in the 1995 CBA finals. The new Consol Energy Center, now known as PPG Paints Arena, is now the home to the annual Pitt Panthers-Duquesne Dukes City Game as well as basketball games of regional interest, such as a men's game played on December 12, 2010 between the West Virginia Mountaineers and Duquesne. The Palumbo Center is also home to the women's volleyball team and hosted the Atlantic 10 Championship in 2012, won by Temple. For their 2017-18 season and part of the 2018-19 season, the arena served as the home of the Robert Morris Colonials men's basketball team for four games while the new UPMC Events Center was being built on campus.

Chris Dahlen of Pitchfork gave the album a 7.3 out of 10, saying: \\"Whether you dig it all or prefer him in small doses, Sole has never sounded more keyed up, heady and on target than he does on Selling Live Water, and its wrap-up is almost anthemic.\\" Ed Howard of Stylus Magazine gave the album a grade of B−, saying: \\"Fun, diverse, and complex, this record is yet another great addition to the increasingly varied Anticon aesthetic.\\" He added: \\"Encompassing personal introspection, socio- political commentary, naked explorations of relationships, and obtuse poetry, Selling Live Water also represents a massive step forward in Sole's lyrical evolution.\\" Track listing Personnel Credits adapted from liner notes. * Sole – vocals, entaludes * Telephone Jim Jesus – production (1, 15) * Alias – production (2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13) * Odd Nosdam – production (3, 14) * Jel – production (5, 8), cuts * Why? – keyboards (3, 14), vocal harmonies (14) * Alex Oropexa – extra keyboards (7, 9) References External links * 2003 albums Sole (hip hop artist) albums Anticon albums Albums produced by Alias (musician) Albums produced by Jel Albums produced by Odd Nosdam ","title":"Selling Live Water"},{"id":"3496212","text":"South Harrisburg (or South Side) is a neighborhood located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Overview The earliest mention occurs in the Old English poem Widsith. According to the Þiðrekssaga, he was born between king Wilkinus and a mermaid. His famous son is Wayland, and grandson Wudga. Though not explicitly given as such, Egil and Slagfin may be Wade's sons, since they are Wayland's brothers according to the Poetic Edda. The medieval English romance about Wade once existed, for Chaucer alluded to the \\"Tale of Wade\\" in one of his works, Troilus and CriseydeTroilus and Criseyde: With sobre chere, although his herte pleyde: / And in the feld he pleyde tho leoun; / He song; she pleyde; he tolde tale of Wade./ But natheles, he japed thus, and pleyde, / And on the walles of the town they pleyde, / From haselwode, there joly Robyn pleyde. and used the phrase \\"Wade's boat\\" (), meaning some sort of trickery, in The Merchant's Tale. The tale and the boat was apparently familiar, at the end of the 16th century, to an editor of Chaucer's works Thomas Speght, who remarked that Wade's boat bore the name Guingelot. To the Angles, Wade was the Keeper of the Ford, and acted as both ferryman and protector. Thidrekssaga Wade has always had a strong association with the sea or water. In the saga about Wade's family, the Vilkina saga (also known as the (Þiðrekssaga), it is said that Wade (Vadi; ) was born between King Vilkinus and a mermaid (gen. lit. \\"sea woman\\"). (Part: Story of Velent the Smith) Wade first apprenticed his son Wayland () to Mimir, from age 9 to 12, and later to two dwarfs living in mount Kallava. He went from his home in Sjoland (=?Zealand) to Grœnasund sound (in Denmark), and finding no ship sailing out, he waded across the sound in waters nine ells deep while carrying his young son Wayland on his shoulder.Imperfectly told in: After the boy studied for two stretches of 12 months, Wade came to fetch his son from the reluctant dwarfs, and was killed in a landslide caused by an earthquake. In the aftermath, the son (Wayland) slays the dwarfs and sets off in a boat he crafts, windowed with glass, reaching the land of king Nidung. Wades boat in Chaucer In Chaucer's, Merchant' Tale occurs the following reference to Wade's boat: > { - valign=\\"top\\"  :And bet than old boef is the tendre veel... :And eek > thise old wydwes, God it woot, :They konne so muchel craft on Wades boot, > :So muchel broken harm, whan that hem leste, :That with hem sholde I nevere > lyve in reste...  :And better than old beef is tender veal... :and also > these old widows, God did wot, :They can play so much craft on Wade's boat, > :So much harm, when they like it, :That with them should I never live in > rest.... } It is clear that, in this context, Wade's boat is being used as a sexual euphemism. However, it is debatable whether this single indirect reference can be taken to demonstrate fertility aspects are a part of his character. =Guingelot= Thomas Speght, an editor or Chaucer's works from the end of 16th century, made a passing remark that \\"Concerning Wade and his bote called Guingelot, and also his strange exploits in the same, because the matter is long and fabulous, I pass it over\\" There may have been widespread knowledge of Wade's adventure in his time, but it has not been transmitted to the present day, and Speght's omission has been deplored by subsequent commentators. \\"Wingelock\\" is Skeat's reconstructed Anglicized form of the boat's name.\\"Guingelot.. is merely a French spelling of some such form as Wingelok\\" in: (Reprint: Cosimo, Inc. 2008 , p. 191). Skeat objects to Michel's conjecture that the name reduces to Ganglate \\"going slowly\\" () Old English fragment of Wade In the 19th century, three lines from the lost Old English Tale of Wade was found, quoted in a Latin homily in MS. 255 in the Library of Peterhouse, Cambridge:Israel Gollancz read a paper to the Philological Society in 1896, which was summarized in: > { cellpadding=\\"2\\" REMwidth=\\"600\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  Ita quod dicere possunt > cum Wade: > :Summe sende ylves & summe sende nadderes, :sumne sende nikeres the biden > watez wunien. :Nister man nenne bute ildebrand onne.  \\"The homilist cites > some comments made by Wade in the Tale: > :Some are elves, some are adders, :and some are nickers that (dwell near > water?). :There is no man except Hildebrand alone.\\"  } On the same passage, Gollancz gave the following alternate translation: \\"We may say with Wade that [all creatures who fell] became elves or adders or nickors who live in pools; not one became a man except Hildebrand\\"By italicizing, Gollancz suggests the homilist is quoting the Tale of Wade and not necessarily the speech by Wade's character. The context of the quote has been variously conjectured. Rickert speculated that the situation resembled the scene in the Waldere fragment, \\"in which Widia, Wate's grandson, and Hildebrand rescue Theodoric from a den of monsters\\"., cited in Karl P. Wentersdorf stated that \\"Wade is here boasting of his victorious adventures with many kinds of creatures\\". Alaric Hall ventures that some antagonistic force has magically \\"sent\\" (and other beings) to beset Wade is beset by monsters, though he cautions that the fragment is too short for certitude..Gollancz and Wentersdorf evidently identify the verb here as ' \\"to be\\" thus translating as \\"became\\" or \\"are\\", whereas A. Hall construed the verb as \\"to send\\". Folklore Stones at Mulgrave near Whitby were said to be the grave of the dead sea-giant (they were known as \\"Waddes grave\\"). A tale was told of Sleights Moor in Eskdale, North Yorkshire. During the building of Mulgrave Castle and Pickering Castle Wade and his wife Bell would throw a hammer to and fro over the hills (a possible Roman road that was called \\"Wade's Causeway\\" or \\"Wade's Wife's Causey\\" locally, was also said to have been built in this manner.) One day Wade's son grew impatient for his milk and hurled a stone that weighed a few tonnes across Eskdale to where his mother was milking her cow at Swarthow on Egton Low Moor. The stone hit Bell with such force that a part of it broke off and could be seen for many years until it was broken up to mend the highways. It has also been said that the Hole of Horcum in North Yorkshire was formed where Wade scooped up earth to throw at his wife.

He completed three classes of primary school, he was a driver by occupation and he worked in Warsaw. In the period of 1952-1956 and in 1967, he murdered seven women and attempted a murder of six other women. Although he is believed to have murdered another, eighth victim (he even confessed to it), it was never proven, as the body was never found. He was sentenced to death and the execution by hanging, which was carried out in November 1969, in Warsaw. Modus operandi Modzelewski murdered women in the age between 18 and 87 by strangling them with a scarf or with his bare hands. He took valuables as well as useless objects from his victims which he then threw away. He executed them with utmost cruelty. The murders had a sexual motive, the lower part of the victims' bodies were nude and the arrangement of the corpse suggested a penetration of genital organs. Modzelewski was a sadist but it was not verified whether he tortured the victims before or after the murder. Victims The list contains names of the confirmed victims of Modzelewski, place of murder, cause of death, and the approximate date of murder #Józefa Pietrzykowska (67) a forest in Zielona Góra near Gałkówek, strangled with bare hands, July 1952 #Maria Kunka (32) a forest near Tuszyn, strangled with a scarf, December 1952 #Teresa Piekarska (21) a field by the forest in Nowy Józefów, strangled with a scarf, March 1953 #Irena Bernadetta Dunajska (24) a field near the road in Gałkówek, strangled with a scarf, 1/2 January 1955 #Helena Walos (18) the vicinity of a country road near the forest in Gałkówek, strangled with a scarf, March 1956 #Helena Klata (22) the vicinity of a road near the rail track between Andrzejów and Gałkówek, strangled with a scarf or bandana (a fragment of material was left on the victim's neck), August 1956 #Maria Gałecka (87) a flat on Sienna Street in Warsaw, strangled or drowned (the corpse stuck out of the bathtub, the buttocks were exposed and cut with a sharp tool), 14 September 1967 Investigation The investigation of the Vampire of Gałkówek's murders was discontinued in 1957. Despite the thoroughness of the investigation, the perpetrator was not found as the police were led astray from the beginning. They assumed that the murderer was a Polish State Railways employee as the crimes were committed near the railway track and some of the women who managed to survive stated that the offender was wearing a uniform. As a result, the perpetrator was not found and the local people continued to live in fear. 10 years later the case was reopened because of the murder in Warsaw. The suspect of killing Maria Gałecka was soon found. It was Stanisław Modzelewski, her ex-neighbour and he was known to have had a number of disputes with the victim.

Named after the constellation Sagittarius, it was the only ship of the Navy to bear this name. Sagittarius was laid down on 8 November 1943 as liberty ship SS J. Fred Essary (MCE hull 1835) by Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland, under a Maritime Commission contract; launched on 30 November 1943, sponsored by Mrs. J. Fred Essary; acquired by the Navy from the Maritime Commission on a bare-boat charter on 8 December 1943; converted to a net cargo ship; and commissioned as Sagittarius (AKN-2) on 18 March 1944. Service history Following shakedown in Chesapeake Bay, Sagittarius departed Norfolk on 1 May; transited the Panama Canal on 9 May; and arrived at San Diego on 21 May. Ten days later, she put into Pearl Harbor; and, on 8 June, she sailed for the Marianas. Arriving at Saipan on 1 August, she installed harbor defense nets there and at Tinian until early September. On 4 September, she sailed for Nouméa, New Caledonia; took on nets as cargo; and steamed for Ulithi, where she laid nets from mid-October to mid-November. She then got underway for Pearl Harbor, arriving on 29 November. In December, Sagittarius continued on to San Francisco for repairs and alterations at Mare Island. At the end of January 1945, she headed back to Hawaii; and, in March, she steamed for Ulithi. Arriving on 2 April, she became flagship of TU 52.8.3; then waited for further routing to the Ryukyus. Ten days later, the AKN sailed for Okinawa. She arrived in the Hagushi anchorage on 18 April; joined TF 51; and, within hours, underwent her first enemy air attack. On 28 April, she splashed her first kamikaze. On 2 May, she shifted to Nakagusuku Wan, where, as at Hagushi, the almost daily air raids continued. Despite the interruptions, however, Sagittarius conducted net laying operations until 26 May. On 27 May, having downed her second kamikaze and assisted in destroying a third, she headed for Pearl Harbor. Steaming via the Marianas, she exploded a drifting Japanese mine one day out of Saipan, on 4 June. On 17 June, she arrived at Pearl Harbor only to depart again, laden with nets, on 8 July. From 24 July to 9 August, she conducted net operations at Ulithi, then returned to Pearl Harbor. Arriving after the cessation of hostilities in the Pacific, Sagittarius steamed west again in mid-September; took on reclaimed nets at Ulithi; transported them to Saipan; then headed back to Pearl Harbor and San Francisco. She arrived at the latter on 19 November; and, in December, continued on to the east coast for inactivation. Sagittarius was decommissioned at Norfolk on 16 January 1946 and returned to the Maritime Commission three days later. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 7 February 1946. Sagittarius was scrapped in 1972. Awards Sagittarius earned two battle stars during World War II.

The game features an unusual method of capture which is \\"possibly unique\\" and \\"not known to exist in any other recorded board game\\". The real name of the game is permainan (\\"the game\\" in Bahasa Indonesia). In Java, the game is also called dam-daman. It was first published in France in 1970 as \\"Surakarta\\". The game is called \\"Roundabouts\\" in Sid Sackson's The Book of Classic Board Games. Equipment Surakarta with blue and yellow counters Traditional Indonesian game pieces are shells versus pebbles or stones, with the board grid inscribed in sand or volcanic ash. But any easily distinguished sets of pieces may be used (e.g. distinguished by colour, as shown). Players begin the game with 12 pieces each. Rules Players decide who moves first, then turns alternate. The object of the game is to capture all 12 of the opponent's pieces; or, if no further captures are possible, to have more pieces remaining than the opponent. Pieces always rest on the points of intersection of the board's grid lines. On a turn, a player either moves one of their pieces a single step in any direction (forwards, backwards, sideways, or diagonally) to an unoccupied point, or makes a capturing move special to Surakarta. =Capturing move= A capturing move consists of traversing along an inner or outer circuit (coloured blue and green in the diagram, but red and blue in the photo) around at least one of the eight corner loops of the board, followed by landing on an enemy piece, it. Captured pieces are removed from the game. Corner loops are used only when making a capture. The capturing piece enters and leaves the circular loop via a grid line tangent to the circle. Any number of unoccupied points may be travelled over, before or after traversing a loop. An unoccupied point may be travelled over more than once during the capturing piece's journey. Only unoccupied points may be travelled over; jumping over pieces is not permitted. Capturing is always optional (never mandatory). =End of game= A game is won when a player captures all 12 of the opponent's pieces. If neither side can make headway, the game is ended by agreement and the winner is the player with the greater number of pieces in play. =Scoring= A match consists of more than one game. Players agree beforehand how the winner will be determined. A couple of methods are typically used: * Playing a fixed number of games: Each game is scored by the number of pieces in play at the end of the game. The winner is the player with higher total points after all games have finished. * Playing to a fixed number of points: New games are played until one player reaches or exceeds the winning point total. Strategy In general, pieces are more powerful toward the centre of the board, where they are in one or two sets of loops. Pieces on the corner, on the other hand, are easy to trap, as the spaces next to the corner can be attacked in a number of directions. Computer opponents Surakarta is one of the games played regularly at the annual Computer Olympiad. Variants Surakarta variants are also played in rural China and Korea, with slightly different rules and boards.泰顺乡村棋类游戏 Taishun village board games물래고누 자동차고누 In these variants, pieces cannot step diagonally, and can slide along the outer circuit without capturing a piece. A 7x7 grid variant with 14 pieces for each player is played in Yogyakarta, Java, Indonesia and is called Bas-basan sepur. The game Surakarta is smaller with a 6x6 grid and only 12 pieces. Both games have the two capturing circuits (inner and outer circuits), and employ the same rules. The game today is rarely known in Yogyakarta with only 5.6% of participants in one 2016 survey showing knowledge of the game. Questionnaires were provided by Kinderstation International of which most of the participants surveyed were in Yogyakarta specifically with students mostly between the grades 4-6 in SD Muhamadiyah Condong Chess and Schools. Back in the 1980s the game was played often in some areas of Yogyakarta (such at the Imogiri and Bantul areas).

The majority of Arab Brazilians trace their origin to the Levantine region of the Arab World, known in Arabic as Bilad al-Sham, primarily from Lebanon and Syria, as well as Palestine. The first Syrians and Lebanese arrived in São Paulo around 1880. It is not known exactly when, although the Syrians and Lebanese say that in 1885 there was a small core of peddlers working in the market square. By 1920, the census listed 50,246 Syrians and Lebanese in Brazil, 38.4% (2/5) of these in the state of São Paulo. The 1940 census enumerated 48,614 Syrians, Lebanese and other related groups with a decrease of approximately 1647 people. As immigration almost ceased after 1929 and the colony aged, it is surprising that the decline was not even greater. The trend of the period between 1920 and 1940 was the continuous concentration of Syrians and Lebanese in São Paulo. Almost half (49.3%) of Syrians and Lebanese residents in Brazil lived in São Paulo. Contemporary data on the number of Arab descendants in Brazil is highly inconsistent. The national IBGE census has not questioned the ancestry of the Brazilian people for several decades, considering that immigration to Brazil declined almost to 0 in the second half of the 20th century. In the last census questioning ancestry, in 1940, 107,074 Brazilians said they were the children of a Syrian, Lebanese, Palestinian, Iraqi or Arab father. The native Arabs were 46,105 and the naturalized Brazilians, 5,447. Brazil had 41,169,321 inhabitants at the time of the census, so Arabs and children were 0.38% of Brazil's population in 1940. [2] Currently, many sources cite that millions of Brazilians are of Arab descent. Itamaraty claims that there are between 7 and 10 million Lebanese descendants in Brazil. [3] However, independent research, based on the interviewee's self-declaration, found much smaller numbers. According to a 2008 IBGE survey, 0.9% of the white Brazilians interviewed said they had a family background in the Middle East, which would give about one million people. [4] According to another 1999 survey by the sociologist and former president of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) Simon Schwartzman, only 0.48% of the interviewed Brazilians claimed to have Arab ancestry, a percentage that, in a population of about 200 million of Brazilians, would represent around 960 thousand people. [5]  Immigration to Brazil  Arab immigration to Brazil started in the 1890s as Lebanese and Syrian people fled the political and economic instability caused by the collapse of the Ottoman Empire; the majority were Christian but there were also many Muslims. Immigration peaked around World War II. 19th century, most of them coming from Lebanon and Syria, later from other parts of the Arab world. When they were first processed in the ports of Brazil, they were counted as Turks because they carried passports issued by the Turkish Ottoman Empire that ruled the present day territories of Lebanon and Syria. There were many causes for Arabs to leave their homelands in the Ottoman Empire; overpopulation in Lebanon, conscription in Lebanon and Syria, and religious persecution by the Ottoman Turks. Arab immigration to Brazil grew also after World War I and the rest of the 20th century, and concentrated in the states of São Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Goiás, and Rio de Janeiro. Most Arab immigrants in Brazil were Christians, Muslims being a minority. Intermarriage between Brazilians of Arab descent and other Brazilians, regardless of ethnicity or religious affiliation, is very high; most Brazilians of Arab descent only have one parent of Arab origin. As a result of this, the new generations of Brazilians of Arab descent show marked language shift away from Arabic. Only a few speak any Arabic, and such knowledge is often limited to a few basic words. Instead the majority, especially those of younger generations, speak Portuguese as a first language. The Brazilian and Lebanese governments claim there are 7 to 10 million Brazilians of Lebanese descent. Also, the Brazilian government claims there are 4 million Brazilians of Syrian descent. However, those numbers might an overestimate, given that an official survey conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in 2008 showed that less than 1 million Brazilians claimed any Middle-Eastern origin (only 0.9% of white Brazilian respondents said they had family origins in the Middle East).IBGE. IBGE: Características Étnico- Raciais da População.  Arabic influence in Brazil  Beirute, an Arab- Brazilian sandwich. Arab immigration has influenced many aspects of Brazil's culture – besides and beyond the Arabic influence inherited via Portugal, as, for instance, some Portuguese words of Arabic origin. In the main Brazilian cities it is easy to find restaurants that cook Arab food; and Arab dishes, such as sfihas (Portuguese esfirra), tabbouleh (Portuguese tabule), kibbeh (Portuguese quibe), hummus, tahina and halwa are very well known among Brazilians. Most Arab immigrants in Brazil have worked as traders, roaming the vast country to sell textiles and clothes and open new markets. This economic history can be seen today in the ways that the São Paulo-based Arab Brazilian Chamber of Commerce has gained greater recognition in increasing Brazilian exports to the Arab world. Arab-Brazilians are well integrated into Brazilian society. Today, only a minority of Arab Brazilians still know and speak the Arabic language, the vast majority of them being monolingual Portuguese speakers. Many important Brazilians are of Arab descent, including important politicians such as Paulo Maluf, Geraldo Alckmin, Gilberto Kassab, former President Michel Temer, José Maria Alkmin, artists, writers (for instance Raduan Nassar) and models.

The company was founded in 1890 as the CUFP, being restructured and renamed Unicer in 1977. In November 2017, the name of the company was changed to the present one, reflecting its most famous output, the Super Bock beer. Its activity is set up on the business of beers and bottled water. It is the largest Portuguese beverage company and is also present in the areas of soft drinks, ciders and wines, in the production and sale of malt, and in the Tourism business.  Structure  The Super Bock Group is a company with decision center in Portugal, owned in 56% by Viacer (Carlsberg and Violas) and 44% by the Carlsberg Group. The Holding Viacer congregates two groups – Violas (71.5%) and Carlsberg Group (28.5%). It is the largest Portuguese exporter of beer – an operation that has already reached more than 50 countries, mainly through Super Bock, which is the best-selling Portuguese beer in the world. The company follows a multi-brand and multi-business strategy, focused on beer and bottled water but extends to the segments of soft drinks, cider and wine. Super Bock Group is also associated with the activity of malt production and sale and holds assets in the tourism sector, Vidago and Pedras Salgadas thermal parks, both in Trás-os-Montes region (North of Portugal).  History  CUFP (Companhia União Fabril Portuense das Fábricas de Cerveja e Bebidas Refrigerantes) at 1934 Portuguese Colonial Exhibition. - Origins (1890–1950) The origin of the company date back to the beginnings of the beverage sector industrialization, during the second half of the nineteenth century, when, on 7 March 1890, CUFP (Companhia União Fabril Portuense das Fábricas de Cerveja e Bebidas Refrigerantes) was formed. This conglomerate can be considered the mother of the current beverage company, with the initial capital of 125,000 escudos (former Portuguese currency), which is roughly €623. Of the seven factories that have joined this project, some were already several decades old. - Nationalisation and creation of Unicer (1960–1980) In the Portuguese revolutionary period (that came after the Carnations Revolution), CUFP was nationalised on 30 August 1975. In December 1977, the State restructured the sector, combining the five nationalized companies into two, Centralcer, and Unicer – União Cervejeira (gathering CUFP, Imperial and Copeja). In 1988, by the Decree-Law No. 353/88, Unicer was transformed into \\"Public Limited Liability Company with a majority public capital\\" with the designation Unicer – União Cervejeira, SA. Productivity has more than trebled between 1979 and 1989, and by the end of the decade, Unicer beer sales exceeded the 300 million liters. It was also during this period that Unicer started a consistent focus on exporting exceeding, in 1983, a million liters of beer exported, and over 4 million liters in 1988. - Re-privatization and growth (1989–1999) Unicer's economic and financial indicators during the 1980s justified that it had been chosen by the government to begin the process of privatizations. Thus, on 26 April 1989, in a public session held in the Oporto Stock Exchange, the privatisation of 49% of capital took place. In 1990, the year the company celebrated its centenary, the privatization was completed, with the sale of the 51% stake that was still held by the State. Over the 1990s, Unicer continued to invest in technological modernisation in all its sectors, in productivity expansion, in rationalization and expansion of the distribution network and in rejuvenation of brands and corporate image. After 1995, the beer market was growing again, and Unicer strengthened its leadership in the sector. Super Bock expanded its popularity, participating in major events such as the most emblematic Portuguese summer festival Super Bock Super Rock, whose first edition took place in 1995; EXPO'98 or the campaign \\"Super Bock / Official Beer of the Year 2000\\" launched in 1999. In 1992, Unicer started to produce and market the Danish brand Carlsberg in Portugal. - Restructuring (2000–2005) In 2000, the core of Unicer shareholders, along with Viacer holding company, launches a public takeover bid, and gets to hold the totality of the capital, except for the shares of the company in itself. By the end of 2000, it was formalized the change of name from Unicer – União Cervejeira, SA, to Unicer – Bebidas de Portugal, SA. A year later, the company changed its legal status, becoming a holding company and rearranging and empowering the various business units. In 2000, Unicer entered the coffee sector, with the acquisition of the shares of the company A Caféeira, S.A., and strengthened its position in the wine sector, with the purchase of Quinta do Minho and Vimompor - Winery Society of Monção. In 2002, the purchase of VMPS – Vidago, Melgaço and Pedras Salgadas and their integration into Unicer, including six industrial facilities, natural parks and thermal and hotel units, and six water marks, projected the company for new challenges in the bottled water sector, as well as the entry in the Tourism sector. - New model of Governance (2006) In June 2006, there is a change in Unicer governance, and the operational leadership started to be performed by the chief executive officer, a position entrusted to António Magalhães Pires de Lima. Years later, concerning the beer business, a core business, there was a concentration of all of the production in Leça do Balio, where, in 2012, began the construction of a new factory with a capacity of 450 million liters, designed according to the foresight of the company's activity for the next twenty years. This emphasis on centralization and development of this production center represents an investment amounting to €100 million. In July 2013, António Pires de Lima leaves the position of chairman of the Executive Committee of Unicer, to accept the office of Minister of Economy. He was replaced by João Abecasis. - 125 years Unicer (2015) Unicer celebrated its 125th birthday on 7 March 2015, in a ceremony presided over by President of the Republic, Aníbal Cavaco Silva. The celebration coincided with the inauguration of the new industrial complex at Leça do Balio, part of the new warehouse, the headquarters building and the Beer Production Centre, in an investment of €100 million. The Beer Production Centre stands out by combining new equipment, technologically superior, and a greater production capacity. The new warehouse is a fully automated infrastructure with an electric car circuit with direct connection to the factory and where you can store 40,000 pallets and move 12,000 pallets daily. Also the new headquarters, inaugurated in September 2014, includes an outer plate (System Thermal Insulation and Acoustic) which reduces about 30% of energy consumption. Sustainability was a major concern in this work, and very positive indicators were achieved. In the new production plant and filling it was reduced by 23% the consumption of electricity; 12% water consumption; and 34% thermal energy consumption. But the new building is now in the process of obtaining LEED certification regulations that covers a set of design criteria, construction and operation of buildings in an environmentally sustainable manner. Also in order to mark the 125th anniversary of the company, Unicer launched the book \\"Unicer, a long history\\", a work written by professor Gaspar Martins Pereira, journalist Júlio Magalhães wrote the foreword.  Internationalisation  Currently, Unicer has commercial activity in more than 50 countries spread over five major markets: Angola, Rest of Africa, Europe, America, Pacific and Middle East. Since the 2000s, Unicer has expanded substantially its exports. In 2006, it already exported about 117 million liters of beer and 23 million liters of water, accounting for about 18% of total sales (compared to 6% in 2000). In 2012, Unicer exported more than 220 million liters of beverages, representing nearly 34% of its total turnover. On the beer market, the foreign market is even more important, exporting more than 40% of the total beer it produces. The Angolan and European markets are the main contributors to the growth of Unicer, which holds a prominent position in the Portuguese beer exported leadership. The main export market remains Angola, where Super Bock is at the top of the preferences among beer brands imported. In Brazil, Água das Pedras secured, during the first year of internationalisation in this country (2013), its presence in 350 sales outlets, including restaurants, gourmet shops, hotels, bars and upscale retail. The leading brand of sparkling water in Portugal is also betting in the USA. In August 2013, the first containers with half a million litres of Super Bock Non-Alcoholic 0.0% went to Saudi Arabia – thanks to a dealcoholisation process that does not include stopping the fermentation phase, and allows the conservation of the main features of a beer. After Saudi Arabia's experience, with Super Bock non-alcohol, Unicer wants to expand its presence in the Middle East. Unicer's planning of international activity focuses on the development and implementation of infrastructure projects in different geographies, such as United States, Mozambique and several European countries.

In 2005, Unicer launched the project Aquanattur (Industrial and Touristic Project of Pedras Salgadas and Vidago), with a major investment in upgrading these parks. - Pedras Salgadas Spa & Nature Park Pedras Salgadas Spa & Nature Park is a tourist complex where the accommodation is made in 12 'eco-houses', small houses built of wood and slate, consisting of eight modules that were installed skirting nature, so that it would not kill any tree. This project was authored by the architect Luís Rebelo de Andrade. The old thermal spa houses the thermal spa, renewed by the famous Portuguese architect Siza Vieira. In addition to the 12 houses of the initial project, the 'eco-houses' (which architecture has been awarded), the park also has two 'tree houses' – smaller houses, which rise between the trees creating the fantasy of true tree houses. - Vidago Palace Hotel Vidago Palace Hotel recently opened with 70 rooms and suites, some with private patios, distributed between the four floors. The hotel, raised to the five-star category, reopened to the public in 2010 with a thermal spa and a renewed 18-hole golf course.  Social Responsibility  In this area, Unicer is dedicated to 5 areas, taken as priority of the company: Ecological Footprint; Employees; Community; Business Partners; and Consumer, through the promotion of responsible consumption and the promotion of Active and Social Lifestyle. In these areas some projects stood out: - In 2006, Unicer launched EnSave project, designed in collaboration with Danfoss Solutions, which has saved in Leça do Balio, 90 million liters of water, 3,600 MW of electricity and 26% of the carbon dioxide consumption. - In 2007, Unicer was awarded the \\"Citizenship of Companies and Organisations\\" prize awarded by the AESE (Association for Corporate Higher Studies). - In 2008, Unicer starts two projects to create awards to recognise talent and national and international innovation. The first was the \\"Product Innovation Award\\", in collaboration with COTEC to reward innovative products developed on Portuguese soil. - Prémio Nacional de Indústrias Criativas (National Prize for Creative Industries), in collaboration with Serralves Foundation and with the support of a network of strategic partners in various industries, was launched in 2008. This award, now in its 7th edition already, became a door entry for the creation and generation of many businesses in the area of creativity and culture, and it won in 2012, the European Prize for Enterprise Promotion. - In November 2009, Unicer signs the letters of commitment promoted by APAN and the FIPA – «Advertising directed to children» and «Reformulation and Nutrition Information to Consumers» – to promote healthier lifestyles and fight bad eating habits. - Unicer has worked with universities, having been recognized by the Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto for the relevance of its collaboration on projects with this university, especially with the Chemical Engineering department, Biological Engineering and Industrial Engineering and Management; and the School of Engineering, University of Minho (EEUM) for continued support to education projects and research of this School, in particular with the Department of Biological Engineering. - 5 December 2013, more than one hundred employees went to the streets and engaged in a great action of volunteering with institutions, families and/or people in a situation of greater vulnerability and/or in need. - CAIS Recycla, a social entrepreneurship project created by CAIS and Unicer, was awarded and recognised by the President of the Republic, Cavaco Silva, in 2013, for the work for the promotion of socio-professional training of people in poverty and social exclusion. According to the latest data of the Directorate-General for Education Statistics and Science (DGEEC), released in February 2015, relating to undertakings with more spending on I&D; activities in 2012 in Portugal: * Unicer Group is at 2nd place in the list of companies/groups of chemical, pharmaceutical and agri-food with more intramural spending on I&D; activity in 2012. * Unicer Group rose to 5th place in the list of companies/groups with more intramural spending on I&D; activity in 2012.  Awards  - Unicer Unicer was distinguished by the excellence of its activation campaigns at sales outlets, in the international awards POPAI. All together, it received 9 awards, 4 gold, 3 silver and 2 bronze, being the national and international company most awarded in this edition. In 2011, Unicer's Management Report 2010 was awarded in the category \\"Annual Reports\\" as part of design excellence, by the Red Dot Awards: Communication Design. In late May 2015, the commemorative book of the 125 years of Unicer, \\"Unicer, a long history\\", won the Grand Prize of the Year and the Grand Prix in the category «Books» under the Papies'15 awards, which reward the best graphic communication internationally. - Brands In 2002, the year that celebrated its 75th anniversary, Super Bock became the first Portuguese beer (and one of the first in Europe) to receive quality certification.

Biography  Born Carlos de Oliveira, Carlinhos grew up in Rio de Janeiro in the 1940s, and was immersed in samba. Carlinhos took up the pandeiro at age seven, starting with one of his mother’s cake pans. He visited the favelas to absorb samba styles, particularly at one of the greatest samba schools, GRES Estação Primeira de Mangueira. Carlinhos would join in during rehearsals, and he soon came to the attention of Mangueira’s legendary singer, Jamelão, who invited Carlinhos to become a performing member of Mangueira, a high honor. Carlinhos’s pandeiro playing became quite theatrical, with unprecedented juggling and stunts (known as malabarismo). Soon Carlinhos was performing professionally, working with most important musicians and composers in Rio. In 1966, Brazil held a national contest to find the country’s best pandeiro player. Carlinhos out-performed 500 other players to win the first ‘Golden Tambourine’ award, thereby becoming known as Carlinhos Pandeiro de Ouro. With this recognition, Carlinhos represented Brazil in performances before the Japanese royal family, the Swedish royal family, and also in a command performance for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip of England. Carlinhos has had a wide-ranging career as a percussionist, appearing in Brazilian films, on Brazilian television, and performing around the world with Herbie Mann, Sergio Mendes, Sadao Watanabe, Ed Thigpen, Toots Thielemans, Martinho da Vila, Beth Carvalho, Maria Bethânia, and many more. Carlinhos married an American singer in 1983, moved to Hawaii, and raised a family. For the last three decades, he has led parades, performed with numerous American samba bands, and taught ‘classic’ Rio-style samba to thousands of students. Today, Carlinhos lives in Los Angeles, performingCarlinhos performance calendar nationally and teaching locally,Carlinhos class schedule at the 18th Street Arts Center in Santa Monica. He is a recipient of awards from the Durfee Foundation, the Alliance for California Traditional Arts, and the Department of Cultural Affairs, Los Angeles.

It was originally manufactured from polystyrene parts by E.S.R., Inc. starting in 1963 and sold as an educational toy for US$4.99. A successor, the Digi-Comp II, was not programmable, but in effect a visible calculator. A two-level masonite platform with guides served as the medium for a supply of marbles that rolled down an inclined plane, moving plastic cams as they fell. Operation In essence, the Digi-Comp I contained three mechanical flip- flops, providing an ability to connect them together in a programmable way using thin vertical wires that are either pushed, or blocked from moving, by a number of cylindrical pegs. The whole arrangement was 'clocked' by moving a lever back and forth. Different configurations of these cylinders caused the Digi-Comp to compute different boolean logic operations. With a three binary digit (3-bit) readout of the state of the flip-flops, it could be programmed to demonstrate binary logic, to perform various operations such as addition and subtraction, and to play some simple logic games such as Nim.

He is a former commentator for the Boston Celtics radio broadcasts. He hosted WEEI-FM's The Big Show until February 15, 2013. On March 17, 2014 he launched \\"The Big Show Unfiltered\\"; on SportstalkBoston.com. Ordway had broadcast on ESPN New Hampshire Radio Nashua/Manchester from June 2014 until May 2015 when he left The Big Show. Ordway then left ESPN NH unannounced to return to WEEI 10a-2p week days. Ordway is originally from Lynn, Massachusetts; he graduated from Lynn Classical High School. Ordway is back on WEEI as of September 8, 2015, as part of a midday show with Lou Merloni and Christian Fauria. Career Ordway began his broadcasting career in radio at a small station in Beverly, WMLO. He then went to WMEX/WITS in Boston in 1975, where at times he filled in for Steve Fredericks; he subsequently became sports director as well as working on Boston Bruins broadcasts. In 1981, Ordway gained prominence at WRKO in Boston where he manned a popular, award-winning call-in show, Sportscall. Ordway is known for his thirteen years as a member of the Boston Celtics' radio broadcast team. After seven years as the number-two announcer alongside longtime Celtics play-by-play man Johnny Most, Ordway took over as the Celtics' primary announcer in 1989, a post he held until 1996. During this period, he appeared as himself in an episode of the long running Boston based sitcom Cheers. In 1987, the Celtics moved their radio programming to WEEI, where Ordway became executive sports director, and later program manager. In 1996, he was promoted to program director, and began The Big Show. Ordway has also hosted a program during New England Patriots season called New England Tailgate, discussing the team with former players Fred Smerlas and Steve DeOssie. He has also appeared on the HBO sports documentaries The Curse of the Bambino and The Reverse of the Curse of the Bambino. =2008 contract negotiations= Ordway announced on his December 11, 2008, show that he would be going on vacation for the rest of the month as his contract with Entercom Communications was set to expire on December 31, and that he was not sure if he would be returning to the air after his vacation. Ordway's contract negotiations may have been affected by Entercom financial problems. The company risked being delisted by the New York Stock Exchange because its stock price had dipped below a dollar. In January 2009, it was announced that Ordway and Entercom had an agreement on a 5-year contract which would pay Ordway $1 million per year. It was reported on September 23, 2011 that Ordway's salary was cut in half due to lower ratings, as part of his contract.http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/articles/2011/09/23/ordways_salary_dips_with_ratings/?p1=Upbox_links Ordway's Salary Dips With Ratings On Tuesday night, February 12, 2013, Glenn was let go from WEEI. He was replaced on the afternoon show by Mike Salk, a Boston native previously doing sports radio in Seattle. The show was renamed from \\"The Big Show\\" to \\"Salk & Holley.\\" Move to Sirius/XM Ordway was on Sirius/XM Radio's Mad Dog Sports Radio hosting \\"The Big Weekend Show with Glenn Ordway\\" every Saturday and Sunday from 8-11am.

Daughter's birth On March 3, 2008, Ordway called into The Big Show to explain his absence from the show for the past three airings. His wife, Sarah, had just given birth to a baby girl, Mia, at Boston's Children's Hospital, and both mother and daughter had suffered severe complications during delivery. Mia, who was born without a heartbeat and wasn’t breathing, was treated at Children's Hospital. After doctors diagnosed Mia with brain-trauma injury, she was placed in a \\"hydrothermal cooling unit that dropped her body temperature to 92.3 degrees for three days\\". This same treatment had been used on injured Buffalo Bill player Kevin Everett. Ordway's wife underwent treatment at Boston's Brigham & Women's Hospital for internal injuries suffered during delivery. On March 19, 2008 Ordway made his return to The Big Show. He gave an update that both Sarah and Mia were on the road to recovery. The co-hosts on the show were WBZ4's Steve Burton and Tom Caron. Caron's wife coincidentally experienced similar childbirth complications with one of his newborn sons who is now 12. Ordway has two children with Sarah: Mia and Mia's older brother, Sam. He also has three children from a previous marriage named Michael, Amanda and Holly. All Pro Celebrity Tailgate In December 2006, the New England Patriots revoked season tickets purchased by Fred Smerlas. Smerlas had been in a partnership with Ordway in a company that hosts $250-a-head tailgate parties at Patriot games. The cost of the package increased to $625 – $750 if the customer wanted a game ticket with a face value of $125. The Patriots determined that the service violated its policy prohibiting season ticket holders from reselling their tickets to third parties except through the team's own ticket exchange, where sellers are required to charge face value. Both Ordway and Smerlas denied money was made on the resale of tickets. Awards and recognition * In 1990 UPI bestowed the Celtics' broadcasting team of Most and Ordway with a first-place finish for pre-game show as well as for play-by-play. * In 2005, Ordway was nominated for a Marconi award, a prestigious award given for excellence in radio, for \\"Major Market Personality of the Year\\". * In 2005, Ordway was awarded the Jimmy Award. The award honors 'individuals who have, over the years, committed themselves to the mission of Dana-Farber and the Jimmy Fund'. *Placed 91st on the trade journal Talkers Magazine list of the 2008 \\"Heavy Hundred\\". The list ranks what the magazine considers the most popular, influential, or entertaining talk-show hosts from around the country. As of 2009 Ordway had moved up to 87th.

It is owned by the Beard Land & Investment Company and the Beard family has always owned the railroad. The Beards have also created the Beard Industrial Park where the MET's customers are located. The railroad was unique in that it had operated exclusively with GE 70-ton switchers built between 1947-1955 for nearly 50 years(a former Southern Pacific EMD SW1500 switcher has been added to the roster as of late). The MET operates on 5 miles (8 km) of mainline track, as well as an addition 48.7 miles of yard and industry track, providing switching services in the Beard Industrial Park. The MET interchanges with the Union Pacific (ex- Southern Pacific Transportation Company) at Modesto and with the BNSF Railway (ex-Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway) at Empire.

On November 1, 1911 it leased the Modesto Interurban Railway (MIR). Passenger service was the primary service for the railroad when it started in November 1911 but only lasted until 1917. The MET went to diesel-only operation in March 1952. =Modesto Interurban Railway= The Modesto Interurban Railway was incorporated on March 23, 1909. The railway was created because only the Southern Pacific served Modesto and the Santa Fe Railway bypassed Modesto by to the east at Empire. The Modesto Interurban Railway linked the Santa Fe Railway with Modesto. On April 12, 1909 the grading commenced. Just days before the Modesto & Empire Traction began taking over the railroad, the Modesto Interurban Railway completed construction and operated its first train. The railway originally proposed in 1908 to build of track from Modesto along McHenry Avenue and then directly to Riverbank. By November 1, 1911 the Modesto & Empire Traction was leasing the railway.

Symptoms present in the baby shortly after birth from a prior nuchal cord may include duskiness of face, facial petechia, and bleeding in the whites of the eye. Complications can include meconium, respiratory distress, anemia, and stillbirth. Multiple wraps are associated with greater risk. The diagnosis may be suspected if there is a decrease in the baby's heart rate during delivery. Nuchal cords are typically checked for by running the finger over the baby's neck once the head has delivered. Ultrasound may pick up the condition before labor. If detected during delivery, management includes trying to unwrap the cord or if this is not possible clamping and cutting the cord. Delivery can typically take place as normal and outcomes are generally good. Rarely long term brain damage or cerebral palsy may occur. Nuchal cords occur in about a quarter of deliveries. The condition has been described at least as early as 300 BC by Hippocrates. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of a prior nuchal cord shortly after birth in the baby may include duskiness of face, facial petechia, and bleeding in the whites of the eye. Complications can include meconium, respiratory disease, anemia, and still birth.

Selwyn Crawford MD from the British Research Council defined a nuchal cord as one that is wrapped 360 degrees around the fetal neck. Crawford commented \\"It is all the more remarkable, therefore, that little work has been done. to analyze its effects during labor and delivery\\". To date, there is no prospective case control double-blind study looking at nuchal cords and observational studies vary in opinion as to the degree of poor outcomes. Also not included in these studies is which umbilical cord form (of the 8 different possible structures) was considered a nuchal cord. Ultrasound diagnosis of a cord around the neck was first described in 1982. “Coils occur in about 25% of cases and ordinarily do no harm, but occasionally they may be so tight that constriction of the umbilical vessels and consequent hypoxia result.” Williams Obstetrics 16th Edition, has only one single sentence in the entire textbook regarding cords around the neck. By contrast, the First Edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica from 1770 had 20 pages of information about Umbilical Cord Pathology with drawings of Umbilical Cord Entanglement. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has these images on its brochure. There are currently three recent texts on ultrasonography which demonstrate the ability of ultrasound to identify umbilical cord issues with reliability as of 2009. A study published in 2004 was done to establish the sensitivity of ultrasound in the diagnosis of a nuchal cord. Each of 289 women, induced the same day, underwent a transabdominal ultrasound scan with an Aloka 1700 ultrasound machine with a 3.5 MHz abdominal probe, using gray-scale and color Doppler imaging immediately prior to induction of labor. Presence of the cord was sought in the transverse and sagittal plane of the neck. A nuchal cord was diagnosed if the cord was visualized lying around at least 3 of the 4 sides of the neck. A cord was actually present at delivery in 52 of the 289 women. Only 18 of the 52 cords or 35% of the nuchal cords were detected on ultrasound done immediately before delivery, and 65% of nuchal cords were not detected. Of the 237 cases where there was no cord at delivery, ultrasound had false positive results, i.e. diagnosed a cord in 44 of the 237 cases (19%) in which there was no cord present at all. In this study, ultrasound was only 35% accurate at finding a single loop, and only 60% accurate at detecting a nuchal cord wrapped multiple times around the neck. In no study was it possible by ultrasound to distinguish between a loose or a tight cord, although at least 3 attempted to do so. Peregrine concludes that ultrasound diagnosis of nuchal cords will only be useful if doctors are able to do so reliably and predict which of those fetuses are likely to have a problem., However, perinatologists routinely look for umbilical cord issues in monoamniotic twins. Studies have shown an improvement in outcomes where cord entanglement was prenatally identified in these cases. Ultrasound measurement of the velocity of flow in the cord may be useful in the management of twins and chronically growth- retarded fetuses. Of course this depends on the training of the sonographer. To date there are no ultrasound courses which teach the identification of nuchal cord to physicians or technicians. A recent review by Wilson of the American Academy of Ultrasonography Technicians recommends the documentation of umbilical cord issues. =Classification= * A \\"Type A\\" nuchal cord is wrapped around the neck but is free sliding * A \\"Type B\\" pattern is described as a hitch which cannot be undone and ends up as a true knot. File:NuchalFree.gifNuchal cord - free sliding File:NuchalLocked.gifNuchal cord - locked pattern Treatment Management of a presenting nuchal cord should be tailored to prevent umbilical cord compression whenever possible. Techniques to preserve an intact nuchal cord depend on how tightly the cord is wrapped around the infant’s neck. If the cord is loose, it can easily be slipped over the infant’s head. The infant can be delivered normally and placed on maternal abdomen as desired. If the cord is too tight to go over the infant’s head, the provider may be able to slip it over the infant’s shoulders and deliver the body through the cord. The cord can then be unwrapped from around the baby after birth. Finally, if the cord is too tight to slip back over the shoulders, one may use the somersault maneuver to allow the body to be delivered. The birth attendant may also choose to clamp and cut the umbilical cord to allow for vaginal delivery if other methods of nuchal cord management are not feasible. Prognosis Retrospective data of over 182,000 births, with the statistical power to determine even mild associations, suggest that a single or multiple nuchal cords at the time of delivery is not associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, is associated with higher birthweights and fewer caesarean sections in births. Although some studies have found that a tight nuchal cord is associated with short term morbidity, it is unclear whether such outcomes are actually a result of the presence of the nuchal cord itself, or as a result of clamping and cutting the cord  References   External links  Complications of labour and delivery Midwifery Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Nuchal cord"},{"id":"3496408","text":"State Route 515 (SR 515) is a four-lane C-shaped state highway in the northern part of the U.S. state of Georgia. It begins just west of Nelson. It curves to the northeast to Lake Chatuge, where it heads north to the North Carolina state line. The highway was built to give motorists in the north Georgia mountains better access to Atlanta and its outlying suburbs, as opposed to the old SR 5 and U.S. Route 76 (US 76) highways, which this project replaced. SR 515 is also known as the Zell Miller Mountain Parkway, in honor of Zell Miller, the Young Harris native turned Georgia governor and U.S. senator. It is one of the Georgia Department of Transportation's Governor's Road Improvement Program (GRIP) corridors. The highway is known for its mountain views all along its route. SR 515 is part of the Appalachian Development Highway System's Corridor A, and is known as the \\"APD Highway.\\" The highway was designated in 1989. Route description SR 5 and SR 515 in northern Pickens County, Georgia SR 515 begins just west of Nelson and just north of the Cherokee-Pickens County line, at the convergence of the northern terminus of Interstate 575, SR 5, the northern terminus of SR 5 Business, and the northern terminus of SR 372. It is concurrent with SR 5 from its southern terminus to Blue Ridge. It is also concurrent with US 76 from East Ellijay to a point between Young Harris and Hiawassee. It maintains a fairly strict south-north routing from its southern terminus to Blue Ridge and then becomes a due east-west route for the remainder of its length. SR 515 is a significant route for the north Georgia mountains, funneling tourist traffic and serving as a growth corridor. SR 515 sees an Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) of more than 10,000 vehicles south of Blue Ridge, and at least 5,000 on the entirety of the route. The entire length of SR 515, including the concurrent sections, is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility and defense. History The road that would eventually become numbered as SR 515 was established at least by 1919 along nearly the same alignment as it travels today. At the time, it was numbered as SR 5 from Nelson to Ellijay, SR 2 and possibly 5 from Ellijay to Blue Ridge, and SR 2 from Blue Ridge to the Young Harris area. The entire route was paved by this time. In 1989, SR 515 was signed along its entire length.

It can also mean grain that has been ground at a gristmill. Its etymology derives from the verb grind. Grist can be ground into meal or flour, depending on how coarsely it is ground. Maize made into grist is called grits when it is coarse, and corn meal when it is finely ground. Wheat, oats, barley, and buckwheat are also ground and sifted into flour and farina. Grist is also used in brewing and distillation to make a mash.  \\"Grist for the mill\\"  The proverb \\"all is grist for the mill\\" means \\"everything can be made useful, or be a source of profit.\\" There are some minor variations, such as \\"all's grist that comes to his mill\\", meaning that the person in question can make something positive out of anything that comes along. A miller ground whatever grain was brought to him, and charged a portion of the final product for the service. Therefore, all grain arriving at the mill represented income, regardless of its quality.

Its main output is the Sagres brand of beers. The company has been controlled by Heineken since April 2008. History Sociedade Central de Cervejas was established in 1934, with the aim of selling the beers produced by the former breweries, Companhia Produtora de Malte e Cerveja Portugália, Companhia de Cervejas Estrela, Companhia de Cervejas Coimbra and Companhia da Fábrica de Cerveja Jansen. In 1935, and after 99 years of activity, Fábrica de Cervejas Trindade was integrated by Sociedade Central de Cervejas (SCC). Centralcer – Central de Cervejas, E.P. is incorporated in 1977 as a result of the merger of Sociedade Central de Cervejas, S.A.R.L. (incorporated in 1934) with Cergal – Cervejas de Portugal, S.A.R.L. (incorporated in 1972). Centralcer – Central de Cervejas, S.A. was therefore created as a result of the above-mentioned company's conversion into a joint stock company, regulated according to Decree-Law no. 300/90 of 24 September. The Company's total share capital is privatised in 1990, and it is the first operation of this kind to be undertaken in Portugal. The Bavaria Group purchases a shareholding in Centralcer – Central de Cervejas, S.A., and becomes one of its main shareholders. In 2000, there is a further alteration to the company's shareholding structure, as a result of its sale to VTR-SGPS, S.A., a group of Portuguese investors (Parfil, BES, Fundação Byssaia Barreto, Olinveste and Fundação Oriente), amongst whom are the inheritors of SCC's founding shareholders. In its turn and in the summer of the same year, this group assigned a 49% share to the international brewing group Scottish & Newcastle. In terms of the Group's organisation restructuring, the merger of Centralcer – Central de Cervejas, S.A. in Centralcontrol S.G.P.S., S.A. (merging company) was concluded in December 2001. The new merged entity changed its corporate denomination to SCC – Sociedade Central de Cervejas, S.A., as well as its head office, which is now located at the factory premises. In 2003, Scottish & Newcastle purchases Parfil's total shareholding, assuming total control of Sociedade Central de Cervejas and Sociedade da Água de Luso. In December 2004, the Company became known as SCC – Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas, S.A., a name that better reflects the scope of its activity, which not only includes beer, but also other products like bottled water and soft drinks. In 2007, after a consortium was set up between Carlsberg and Heineken a takeover bid was made for the acquisition of the Scottish & Newcastle Group. As a result of the negotiations, the acquisition was accomplished, with Heineken taking over the control of Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (SCC) on 29 April 2008, following the conclusion of the Consortium's acquisition of Scottish & Newcastle (S&N;). The consortium was dissolved after the deal was completed. Brands A bottle of Sagres SCC produces a range of beers, mainly pale lagers. Sagres brand was born in 1940 as a prestige beer, to represent Sociedade Central de Cervejas at the Portuguese World Exhibition inaugurated in May 1940. Sagres is named after a town of the same name, a small village located in the most south-westerly point of Europe, and where sailors learned all about the navigation science. With a similar fate to the caravels that left from Lisbon to faraway lands, Sagres was the first beer to be exported, arriving first in Gibraltar, and moving on to the Azores and the Overseas Territories of Angola, Cape Verde Islands, Guinea Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, Timor, Goa, Macau and Mozambique. Nowadays Sagres beer is present in almost every corner of the world, wherever there is a Portuguese community. Sagres (5,0% abv): is a pale lager (branca) made of 100% natural product, brewed according to exclusive traditional methods with water, malt, cereals which have not been malted and a rigorous selection of the finest hops. No additives or preservatives are used in its brewing. Moderately rich, it has a dry and pleasantly bitter taste. It is light and has a golden colour. Sagres was the first Portuguese brand to launch the Mini version (20cl), a success among consumers because of it small size and constant freshness. Sagres Preta (4,3% abv): is a dark Munich type of beer, moderately rich, with a pleasant caramel bouquet. For many years, Sagres Preta was the only dark ale on the domestic market. Sagres Bohemia (6,2% abv): is an auburn beer, with an intense character, fruity aroma, creamy foam and a reddish amber colour. It was launched in 2005. Sagres Radler (2,0% abv): Launched in 2013, it is suitable for light drinking occasions. Made from Sagres beer together with natural lemon juice, it is a medium bodied beer and fruit juice drink, with a slightly opaque straw-yellow colour. On the palate it has a gentle citric taste and aroma, and a good acid/sweet balance. Sagres Sem Álcool (0,3% abv): is a light non-alcoholic beer, with a refreshing character and the taste of the Original Sagres beer. It was launched in 2005. Sagres Sem Álcool Preta (0,3% abv): is a beer type Munich with a strong trace of malt and a smooth bitterness. The first non-alcoholic Sagres dark ale beer was launched in 2007. Sagres Special Editions: as part of Sagres innovation strategy, once or twice a year special editions with limited quantities are launched to the market. Some examples are Sagres Preta Chocolate (chocolate-flavored dark ale beer), Sagres Festa (regular Sagres with 4,2% alcohol and -2º filtration process) and Sagres Puro Malte (highly selected materials and aromatic hop). Marketing Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas promotes the Sagres brand through a very strong liaison with football. Sagres has a long-term sponsorship deal with the Liga Portuguesa Futebol, the highest level of professional football (soccer) in Portugal. As a result, the league was officially called Liga ZON Sagres. Besides that, Sagres beer is also official sponsor of many professional teams, like Benfica, Braga, Olhanense and Académica Coimbra. Sagres is also a proudly official sponsor of the Portugal national team since 1993, with over 20 years of unconditional support.

Probably named after a variant spelling of the constellation Tucana, it was the only ship of the Navy to bear this name. Tuscana was laid down 5 December 1943 as liberty ship SS William R. Cox (MCE hull 2406) by Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard Inc., Baltimore, Maryland, under a Maritime Commission contract; launched on 29 December 1943; sponsored by Miss Cheshire Cox; acquired by the Navy under bareboat charter and renamed Tuscana on 8 January 1944; converted to a net cargo ship at Baltimore by the Maryland Drydock Co.; and commissioned on 28 March 1944, Comdr. Thomas J. Butler, USNR, in command. Service history =Marshall Islands= Tuscana arrived at Hampton Roads, Virginia on 6 April 1944 and operated out of that port, conducting drills and shakedown in Chesapeake Bay. On 26 April, she set her course via the Canal Zone for Hawaii. She entered Pearl Harbor on 23 May, provisioned, took on passengers, and got underway for the Marshalls on 26 May. She arrived at Kwajalein on 5 June; got underway on 27 June, steaming with barge YC-1008 in tow; and arrived at Eniwetok on 29 June. On 20 July, while attempting to transfer a passenger to during a rain squall, Tuscanas Buoy Boat No. 1 became stranded on a reef. When pounding seas forced the boat's crew to abandon her, a boat from destroyer came to the rescue and saved all hands. On 27 July, Tuscana departed Eniwetok, with other net cargo ships and an escort, and set her course for the Marianas. =Mariana Islands= Tuscana anchored at Garapan on 1 August, detached men and cargo for the operation of harbor and waterfront facilities, and on 7 August began net operations. Throughout the remainder of the month, Tuscanas crew labored to assemble and launch anti- torpedo nets which were towed into place and installed by the smaller net laying ships (ANs). On this, her first net laying assignment, Tuscana provided nets to protect Mutcho Point and Garapan harbor from submarine attack. After completing this vital task, Tuscana arrived at Pearl Harbor on 11 September and began loading stores, buoys, and net materials. =Ulithi= On 19 September, she got underway with a slow convoy of eight ships and three escorts bound for the Marshalls. After a few days at Eniwetok, she continued on toward the Carolines and arrived at Ulithi on 9 October. Here, conferences on net laying took place on board the ship. Then, on 15 October, Tuscanas crew began net assembly. On 26 October, she began delivering nets to smaller net laying ships which towed them into place and installed them to protect the lagoon anchorage. On 28 October, Tuscana assembled the last net of this operation. The same day, , a member of the task unit working with Tuscana, struck a Japanese mine which caused severe damage to the net layer and underscored the ever-present hazards of warfare in the Pacific. Tuscana embarked passengers on 11 November and, on the following day, got underway and steamed via Eniwetok to the Hawaiian Islands. Throughout most of December, she remained at Pearl Harbor undergoing repairs. Then, on 27 December, she set her course again for the Marshalls and spent a week at Eniwetok before proceeding on to the western Carolines. Shortly after midday on 20 January 1945, she passed through Mugai Channel and anchored at Ulithi. Although hampered at first by rough seas. Tuscana supplied moorings and assembled 1,260 yards of anti-torpedo net for Towachi Channel and an additional 6,390 yards for use elsewhere in the approaches to Ulithi. On 12 February 1945, her assignment completed, she departed Ulithi. =Okinawa= In March, she underwent drydocking at Pearl Harbor; then took on cargo and passengers. She returned to Ulithi on 4 April 1945, and, on 12 April, departed that port steaming in convoy for Okinawa. She anchored off the Hagushi landing beaches on 18 April. Near dusk each evening, the general alarm sounded, a regular reminder of the danger of Japanese air raiders. On 2 May, sailors on board Tuscana saw the flash of firing off the ship's starboard quarter and later observed the glow of an explosion which they thought marked the fiery end of a Japanese suicide boat. On 6 May, Tuscana began to assemble nets and moorings to screen the anchorage. Early in the day on 28 May, as Tuscana lay anchored in Buckner Bay, a swarm of kamikazes attacked. For Tuscana, the action began at 07:25, when a Japanese airplane crashed into a merchant ship only 800 yards off her starboard bow. For over 30 minutes, Tuscana fought off the airborne raiders. At 07:35, a suicide plane crashed into . Soon thereafter, Tuscana opened fire on her first enemy plane; and, moments later, another came in toward her port bow. Tuscanas guns opened on the attacker and kept it under fire until it disappeared in the low overcast. At 07:44, she engaged a third aircraft and splashed it 600 yards off the port bow. She then turned her attention to the rescue of two survivors from Sandoval. At 07:55, yet another Japanese plane came in range, and Tuscana splashed this raider some three miles away. During the fight, Tuscana lost her starboard mainmast boom, which was toppled and damaged beyond operational use, and her topping lift was carried away by friendly fire. At 0758, Tuscanas guns opened on the last of the attackers and ceased fire five minutes later, just as a kamikaze crashed merchant ship SS Josiah Snelling. At 09:00, the all clear was sounded, and Tuscana emerged from her encounter with the enemy without personnel loss and with the knowledge of having assisted in the splashing of two enemy planes. During an early afternoon alert on 3 June 1945, Tuscanas gunners splashed a Japanese aircraft only 500 yards off her starboard quarter. On 6 June, she got underway and proceeded via Saipan and the Hawaiian Islands to the California coast. On 6 July, she anchored in San Francisco Bay to begin a prolonged period of overhaul. While the ship underwent extensive repairs, members of her crew attended schools in damage control, fire fighting, and radar. During this interlude, hostilities ended in the Pacific. =Post-war activities= Late in August, Tuscana completed dock trials and tests; then provisioned and got underway on 7 September. Steaming via Pearl Harbor, she arrived at Okinawa on 14 October and began discharging her cargo. Later in the month, as she was proceeding to Japan, she sighted and destroyed a floating mine. The ship anchored at Sasebo on 25 October. She returned to Okinawa in November; then continued on to Hawaii; and reached Pearl Harbor on 10 December. She discharged passengers and cargo there; and, on 14 December, she set her course for Balboa. Steaming via the Panama Canal, she arrived at Norfolk on 11 January 1946. =Decommissioning and sale= The net cargo ship was decommissioned on 28 January 1946 and returned to the War Shipping Administration the next day. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 25 February 1946. Laid up under the name William R. Cox, the ship remained in custody of the Maritime Administration until she was sold in the late 1960s to Horton Industries, Inc., and scrapped in 1967. Awards Tuscana received two battle stars for World War II service.

The series incorporated a \\"hidden camera\\" format similar to Candid Camera. The program was produced in Toronto by Screen Gems, at the studios of CFTO-TV. Richard Hayes was host, and the show's producer was Dan Enright. The show was short-lived, lasting only one season in US television syndication and on Canada's CTV. Format Two teams, each consisting of a celebrity and a friend or relative, would be shown a clip of an unsuspecting person placed in an embarrassing situation, recorded by a hidden camera, and as the film was frozen on a closeup of the person's face, the contestants had to wager on how the person would react. For example, a person in a taxicab is told by the driver that he is nearsighted and color blind; the contestants would guess whether the passenger would exit the cab or not. Each team started with $50 and could bet up to that amount in each round; the team with the most money after four rounds won the game, with their winnings donated to their favorite charity. Broadcast history This was one of several Canadian game shows Dan Enright worked on following his post-quiz show scandals exile; he would later make a comeback to American game shows when former partner Jack Barry brought him in to produce the final network season of Barry's own successful comeback series, The Joker's Wild.

His full name is given as Alexei Fyodorovich Karamazov and he is also referred to as Alyosha, Alyoshka, Alyoshenka, Alyoshechka, Alexeichik, Lyosha, and Lyoshenka. He is the youngest of the Karamazov brothers, being nineteen years old at the start of the novel. The preface and the opening chapter proclaim him as the hero. Dostoevsky intended to write a sequel, which would detail the rest of Alyosha's life, but died shortly after the publication of The Brothers Karamazov. At the outset of the story Alyosha is a novice in the local monastery. In this way Alyosha's beliefs act as a counterbalance to his brother Ivan's atheism. He is sent out into the world by his Elder and subsequently becomes embroiled in the sordid details of his family's life. He becomes involved with, and later engaged to, a young girl named Liza (or Lise) Khokhlakov, daughter to a confidante of Katerina Ivanovna's. Later on in the novel, Lise sinks into depression and self-hatred, spurning her lover and crushing her finger in a door. Alyosha is also involved in a side story in which he befriends a group of school boys whose fate adds a hopeful message to the conclusion of an otherwise tragic novel. Alyosha's place in the novel is usually that of a messenger or witness to the actions of his brothers and others. He is very close to Dmitri. Alyosha is depicted as a positive character, kind, loving and sensitive. Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka states that Alyosha, like Prince Myshkin, the protagonist in another Dostoyevsky novel, The Idiot, are almost Jesus-like characters, who are nevertheless unable to prevent the suffering of those around them. She suggests that as a witness or messenger, Alyosha is not a true moral agent, playing a passive role in the events of the novel.p373, Anna-Theresa Tymienieck, The Origins of Life, Springer, 2000 Rufus W. Mathewson states that Alyosha Karamazov is a more robust positive hero than Prince Myshkin. He argues that Alyosha is closer than Myshkin to being an active spokesman for conservatism, citing Alyosha's most impressive success as helping Dmitri. He describes Alyosha as relying on forgiveness, kindness and natural justice, rather than attempting to change the social order.p19-20, Rufus W. Mathewson, The Positive Hero in Russian Literature, Northwestern University Press, 2000 Concept and creation Alyosha is named after Dostoevsky's son of the same name, who was born in 1875 but died in 1878 of epilepsy. Because of this Dostoevsky imbued Alyosha with qualities and characteristics which he sought and most admired, including that of Jesus Christ. Dostoevsky is believed to have based the character of Alyosha on his friend, Vladimir Solovyov, a Russian philosopher and poet who led a generous life, to the point of giving away his clothes to people in the street.p295, Hans Urs von Balthasar et al., The Glory of the Lord: A Theological Aesthetics, Ignatius Press, 1991Zouboff, Peter, Solovyov on Godmanhood: Solovyov’s Lectures on Godmanhood, Harmon Printing House, Poughkeepsie, New York, 1944; see Czeslaw Milosz’s introduction to Solovyov’s War, Progress and the End of History, Lindisfarne Press, Hudson, New York 1990 Portrayals *Hermann Thimig is the first actor to play Alyosha in film in 1915's The Brothers Karamazov directed by Victor Tourjansky, now a lost film. *Italian actor Carlo Conso portrayed the character in the 1947 Italian film I fratelli Karamazoff *Canadian-American actor William Shatner portrays Alyosha in the 1958 American film adaptation. *Russian actor Andrey Myagkov in the Soviet 1969 adaptation. *Russian actor Aleksandr Golubev portrayed Alyosha in the 2009 Russian TV miniseries Bratya Karamazovy.

Prehistoric Nabta Playa (c. 7500 BC) In Nabta Playa by the end of the 6th millennium BC, prehistoric Egyptians had imported goats and sheep from Southwest Asia. Predynastic Badari (c. 4500-4000 BC) Foreign artifacts dating to the 5th millennium BC in the Badarian culture of Egypt indicate contact with distant Syria and Uruk. Predynastic Naqada, Gerzeh and Maadi (c. 4400–3100 BC) Mesopotamian king as Master of Animals on the Gebel el-Arak Knife, dated circa 3300–3200 BC, Abydos, Egypt. Louvre Museum, reference E 11517. This work of art both shows the influence of Mesopotamia on Egypt at an early date, and the state of Mesopotamian royal iconography during the Uruk period. Predynastic Egyptians in the Naqada I period traded with Nubia to the south, the oases of the western desert to the west, and the cultures of the eastern Mediterranean to the east. They also imported obsidian from Ethiopia to shape blades and other objects. Charcoal samples found in the tombs of Nekhen, which were dated to the Naqada I and II periods, have been identified as cedar from Lebanon. Evidence of Naqadan contacts include pottery and other artifacts from the Levant that have been found in ancient Egypt. Egyptian artifacts dating to this era have been found in Canaan and other regions of the Near East, including Tell Brak and Uruk and Susa in Mesopotamia. Lapis lazuli trade, in the form of beads, from its only known prehistoric source - Badakshan, in northeastern Afghanistan - reached ancient Gerzeh. By the first half of the 4th millennium BC, predynastic Egyptians in Maadi were importing pottery from Canaan. Early Dynastic (c. 3100–2575 BC) Evidence of Early Dynastic contacts are basically a continuation of the predynastic above with further extensions into Sudan. There are also some indications of contact with the Aegean and Crete in this period, but this evidence is weak. Narmer had Egyptian pottery produced in southern Canaan – with his name stamped on vessels – and then exported back to Egypt. Production sites included Arad, En Besor, Rafiah, and Tel Erani. An Egyptian colony that was stationed in southern Canaan dates to this same era. First Dynasty Egyptian pottery has been found in southern Canaan, some bearing the name of Narmer. Other reflections of ancient Near Eastern contact particularly include a design of a flint knife. Old Kingdom (before c. 2134 BC) Evidence of Old Kingdom trade (external map here) extends southward to Nubia (in modern Sudan and Ethiopia) and Punt (probably modern Ethiopia/Eritrea or the Eritreo-Sudanese borderlands, possibly Somalia), eastward to the Near East (Byblos and Ebla, Syria), northward to the Aegean and the Greek islands, and westward (limited evidence) with Libya. The Darb el-Arbain trade route, passing through Kharga in the south and Asyut in the north, was used from as early as the Old Kingdom for the transport and trade of gold, ivory, spices, wheat, animals and plants. Middle Kingdom (before c. 1648 BC) Evidence of Middle Kingdom contacts (external map here) reaches southward to Nubia, in particular Buhen and Kerma. Nubians also lived in ancient Egypt in this period. Eastward contacts are represented by objects and motific works of ancient Egypt found in the Near East, including modern Anatolia and Byblos and those ancient regions around Canaan and Syria. Some kings of Byblos have been found buried with Egyptian items. Westward, evidence of contact with Libya is generally limited to military expeditions. Northward, evidence of contact with the Aegean includes Minoan relics found in Egypt. New Kingdom (before c. 1070 BC) New Kingdom contacts (everywhere except Greece) seem to have been dominated by military activities. Strong northerly contacts with Crete, Mycenea and the Helladic (on the Aegean islands) seem to have persisted during this time. Southward, Egypt conquered Nubia. Eastward, the Egyptians successfully conquered the ancient regions of Palestine and Syria, being opposed by the Mitanni and the Hittites. Although, limited trade between the regions seems to have continued, culminating in the world's earliest known peace treaty, between Ramesses II and the Hittites. Westward, contact with Libya is again generally limited to military activities. Late Period (before c. 343 BC) Foreign contacts in the Late Period of ancient Egypt seem to have been mere extensions of those of the New Kingdom. Military expeditions again persist, everywhere but in ancient Greece. In fact, there is in this period evidence of Greek soldiers fighting for Egyptian pharaohs and the establishment of a Greek trading post, called Naucratis, within Egypt. Nubia would become dominated by ancient Egypt in this period. Eventually, however, by the 25th Dynasty, Nubia conquers and controls Egypt, only themselves to become later ousted by the Assyrians. Further, some scholars believe the Assyrians were then later driven out by the Napatans. Described by Herodotus as a road \\"traversed ... in forty days,\\" the Darb el-Arbain trade route became by his time an important land route facilitating trade between Nubia and Egypt. Eastward, Egypt gained control over Cyprus but, despite numerous attempts, never over Palestine. Again Libyan contacts in this era are generally limited to military activities.

Dostoevsky wanted to create a character that was \\"entirely positive... with an absolutely beautiful nature\\", someone who is truly 'Christian'. According to Joseph Frank, the character of Prince Myshkin approaches \\"the extremest incarnation of the Christian ideal of love that humanity can reach in its present form, but he is torn apart by the conflict between the contradictory imperatives of his apocalyptic aspirations and his earthly limitations.\\" At the beginning of The Idiot, Prince Myshkin has been in Switzerland for the last four years, at a sanatorium for treatment of his epilepsy. At age 26, having recovered his health, and in possession of a legal document suggesting entitlement to a significant inheritance, he returns to Russia. In St. Petersburg, his purity and guilelessness lead many to the false conclusion that he is an \\"idiot\\". In fact, he possesses an incisive intellect, deep emotional intelligence, and a wisdom that surpasses all the other characters in the novel. Significance of the character to the novel As a polyphonic novel each character in The Idiot has a unique voice and perspective in relation to the action and the other actors. As such every scene is a dramatic convergence of multiple independent voices and perspectives rather than simply being a monological recounting of the event by a narrator. Dostoevsky makes Prince Myshkin a character whose voice is capable of \\"actively and confidently interfering in the interior dialogue of the other person.\\" He is thus significant not merely to the plot, but to the very consciousness of the individual characters. His insight, compassion, sincerity, candour, disinclination to judge and lack of normal social egoism awaken a responsive consciousness in most of the people with whom he engages, and serve to disrupt the habitual flow of their self-centred thoughts and actions.Bakhtin (1984). p 242 =Nastasya Filippovna= —Nastásya Filíppovna Baráshkova (Настасья Филипповна Барашкова) It is in the character of Nastasya Filippovna that the capacity of the Prince to affect an other's interior dialogue is most marked. Viewed by both society and herself as a 'fallen woman' because of years of sexual exploitation by Totsky, Nastasya Filippovna often embraces the sharp-tongued, destructive persona of a cynical courtesan. Myshkin understands that this persona grows out of an internalisation of the abuse she suffered and the unjust moral condemnation consequent upon it, and from their first meeting lets her know that it is not who she really is, and that she is guilty of nothing. In the scene at the Ivolgins' apartment, Nastasya Filippovna mocks Ganya's family (who she knows disapprove of her) and intentionally provokes a scandalous scene, but \\"Myshkin's voice, intersecting with her internal dialogue in another direction, forces her to abruptly change that tone\\".Bakhtin (1984). p257 She kisses the hand of Ganya's mother and acknowledges the truth of Myshkin's reproach. In the subsequent scandal scene at Nastasya Filippovna's apartment, Myshkin again directly addresses her true, innocent self, prompting her once more to abandon the self-destructive course of the 'fallen woman'. Although it is only temporary, and Nastasya Filippovna persistently reasserts the negative voice of her guilt in her words and actions, Myshkin remains in her consciousness as the voice of her innocence. Near the end of the novel, when Aglaya Ivanovna (with whom the Prince is in love) has become Nastasya Filippovna's accuser, Myshkin again defends her, telling Aglaya that the accusations are unjust. According to the narrator, Nastasya Filippovna \\"—though she sometimes behaved with such cynicism and impudence—was really far more modest, soft, and trustful than might have been believed... Myshkin understood this.\\" =Rogozhin= —Parfyón Semyónovich Rogózhin (pre-reform Russian: ; post-reform ) After meeting Myshkin on the train to Petersburg in the opening scene of the book, Rogozhin labels him a yurodivy (holy fool). In the Eastern Orthodox tradition the yurodivy was usually a greatly respected figure. According to Frank, \\"though the gentlemanly and educated Prince bears no external resemblance to these eccentric figures, he does possess their traditional gift of spiritual insight.\\"Frank (2010). p 579 Rogozhin, sensing the Prince's unique qualities, immediately makes him his confidant and tells him the story of his obsession with Nastasya Filippovna. Later in the novel when, out of jealousy, Rogozhin has developed a hatred for him, Myshkin continues to treat Rogozhin as his friend and brother and, as with Nastasya Filippovna, is able to temporarily draw him out of his darkness and into a space of light and hope. But like Nastasya Filippovna, the negative voice of his obsession always reasserts itself in Myshkin's absence, and provokes him to violence.Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Part II, chapters 3-5; Part IV, chapter 11 =Aglaya Ivanovna= Aglaya Ivanovna's noble and passionate nature leads her to idealise the Prince, turning him into a Don Quixote-like figure, particularly in relation to his attempts to 'save' Nastasya Filippovna. Although the Prince is fascinated by Aglaya and falls in love with her, at no time is he influenced by this idealisation or by any of her other misguided opinions. Aglaya's illusions and the Prince's real motivations are juxtaposed in a number of scenes or consecutive scenes. For example, in a scene from Part II Aglaya reads aloud Pushkin's poem \\"The Poor Knight\\", unambiguously indicating to the assembled company that she is identifying the Prince with the poem's subject, a noble Knight who goes off to fight heroically in the Crusades. When this scene is interrupted by the arrival of the group of Nihilists who are seeking to slander the Prince and exploit his wealth, Aglaya is ecstatic that he will have the opportunity to \\"defend himself triumphantly\\". Instead the Prince humbly tries to make peace with the young men and calmly absorbs their insults and provocations, even sympathising with them and offering assistance.Frank (2010). p 585-6The Idiot. Part II, chapters 6-9 In the dinner party scene at the Epanchins' house in Part IV of the novel, Myshkin delivers a passionate denunciation of Catholicism, describing it as an unchristian religion because it has been dominated by the desire for political supremacy.The Idiot p 508 He is thus denouncing \\"the very confusion of the temporal and the spiritual that, on the personal level, Aglaya wishes him to incarnate.\\"Frank (2010). p 586 As with the other characters, Myshkin's persistently gentle and insightful voice is able at various times to affect Aglaya's interior dialogue in a way that enables her to find her true voice, but she too is unable to sustain the change it produces. In their longest and most significant dialogue, during their secret rendezvous at 'the green seat', her speech alternates between a spontaneous humour and innocence prompted by Myshkin's sincere love for her, and angry outbursts prompted by a misinterpretation of his devotion to Nastasya Filippovna and his failure to embody her romantic ideal.The Idiot (2004). Translator David McDuff. Penguin Classics. Chapter 8, pp 495-510 =Ippolit Terentyev= The character of Ippolit only has a relatively peripheral role in the plot, but he is of vital importance because he represents an antithetical orientation to Myshkin in relation to the problems of life and death, God and morality, that form the thematic basis of the novel. Like Myshkin, Ippolit lives in the shadow of illness and death, but his tormented nihilistic worldview excludes the vision of harmony, joy and compassion that is so essential to Myshkin. Consequently, he is impelled to increasing extremes of rebellion—against society, against nature and against God, as he strives to affirm his will in the face of his impotence.Frank (2010). pp 561, 582-3 Despite their apparently opposite orientations, Ippolit and the Prince have much in common. It is occasionally evident that Ippolit shares Myshkin's sense of the sacred and the beautiful, and he consciously addresses himself to that sensibility when constructing his atheistic philosophy. Ippolit's interpretation of the book's key religious symbol, Holbein's painting The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb, as something that perfectly illustrates the omnipotence of 'blind nature', is posited precisely because it is Christ who is depicted: 'nature' has \\"senselessly seized, smashed and devoured, dully and without feeling, a great priceless Being, a Being worth all of nature and its laws, worth the whole Earth, which was created perhaps solely for the emergence of that Being.\\"The Idiot (2004). p 476 Myshkin remains silent in response to Ippolit's sarcastic barbs about Christian humility, and does not make any attempt to refute his convoluted atheistic arguments. When engaging only with each other, the Prince's quietism and sincere empathy occasionally elicit a corresponding consciousness in Ippolit, but he always later reverts to his cynical bitterness.

It was taken out of operation in 2015. It has also been called the Loggerhead Lighthouse. It has been said to be \\"a greater distance from the mainland than any other light in the world.\\" History Dry Tortugas Light when the upper part was painted black. In 1856, Capt. Daniel Phineas Woodbury supervised construction of the lighthouse, based on an 1855 design by Capt. Horatio Wright, and it became operational in 1858. When originally constructed the walls of the tower were left its natural, yellowish-red brick color. The lens was a first order Fresnel lens which was manufactured by the French firm of L. Sautter and Company. In addition to the tower, the light station included a brick two-story dwelling with Greek Revival features, a brick two-story kitchen (still standing), and oil house, wash house, outhouses and cisterns. Forty-one year old Benjamin H. Kerr was appointed head keeper and received a salary of $600 per year. He had previously been keeper at Garden Key since 1850. Charles H. Perry was appointed 1st assistant keeper and John Fritz as the 2nd Assistant keeper. Both assistants received $300 per year. The Loggerhead Key lighthouse has a stone foundation and a conical brick tower. The walls are thick at the base and taper to thick at the top. The tower was later painted black on the upper part and white below. A radio room is attached to the base of the tower. A later replacement lens, a second order clamshell revolving Fresnel lens, is now on display at the United States Coast Guard Aids to Navigation School in Yorktown, Virginia. The light was automated in 1988. The first lighthouse in the Dry Tortugas was on Garden Key, and became operational in 1826. After several proposals for a new lighthouse on the \\"outer shoals\\" of the Dry Tortugas, a new lighthouse was built on Loggerhead Key and completed in 1858 at a cost of US$35,000, which was the amount that had been projected to upgrade the existing lighthouse on Garden Key. The Dry Tortugas lighthouse, along with the Garden Key lighthouse at Fort Jefferson, were the only lights on the Gulf coast that stayed in full operation throughout the American Civil War. A civilian prisoner of Fort Jefferson, John W. Adare and a companion, used planks to swim to the Key and stole the keeper's boat. Although they made it to Havana, the Spanish authorities there extradited them back to Key West. Undeterred, Adare attempted a second escape, one in which he needed a second plank for his ankle ball and chain. This time the boat was locked and Adare was captured the next day. The tower was damaged by a hurricane in October 1873 and plans were drawn up for a new tower. The tower was repaired by rebuilding the top and extending the steel rods anchoring the lantern to the bottom of the tower. After the repaired tower survived another hurricane in September 1875, the plans for a new tower were deferred and eventually dropped. The Dry Tortugas Light received an electric lamp in 1931, becoming the most powerful lighthouse in America, with three million candela. The rotating beacon stopped working in April 2014, and was formally decommissioned in December 2015. Head keepers * Benjamin H. Kerr (1858 – 1861) * James P. Lightburn (1861 – 1862) * Robert H.

Weekends feature shows on money, law, house repair, gardening and restaurants, as well as repeats from some weekday shows. WTAG is a Fox News Radio affiliate. History former logo former logo WTAG's history began on May 1, 1924 when the C. T. Sherer Co., a Worcester department store, received the license for WDBH. WDBH began operation May 24, 1924 with a power of 100 watts on a frequency of 268 meters (1120 kHz). The call letters was assigned by the Commerce Department as the next available block of sequential letters. The station used a play on words and represented that they stood for \\"We Do Business Honestly\\". The call letters were changed to WCTS in March 1925. Its power went up to 500 watts in April 1925. WCTS joined the WEAF network run by AT&T; about the same time. The station was purchased by Theodore Ellis, then the owner of the Worcester Telegram & Gazette, on September 23, 1925. The call letters were changed to WTAG in October 1925 and have not changed since. Ellis sold the newspapers and radio station in December 1925 to Harry Stoddard and George F. Booth (1960 recipient of the Yankee Quill Award). Their families would own the station until 1987. A studio was constructed on the fourth floor of the newspaper building at 18 Franklin Street. Broadcasting began there in May 1926. The transmitter was still at Sherer's department store on Front Street. The transmitter was a Western Electric IB and the antenna an inverted L. In July 1926 the wavelength was changed to 545.1 meters (550 kHz). It remained there briefly until June 15, 1927 when the wavelength was changed to 516.9 meters (580 kHz). It has remained on 580 kHz ever since. WTAG was a charter member of the NBC Radio Network. It carried their first broadcast November 15, 1926. From 1927 until 1934 the station ran various power levels on 580 kHz, finally ending up with 500 watts from a T antenna at 20 Franklin Street, the T&G; building. An RCA 1-B transmitter was put on the air in 1931 and was used occasionally until the mid-1960s. Limited by the downtown location, a site was located that would allow for construction of towers. A farm on Shrewsbury Street in Holden, about 5 miles (8 km) north of the center of Worcester, was purchased in 1934. Construction of a new transmitting facility was begun in 1935. On February 2, 1937 WTAG began transmitting with a power of 1000 watts using a three tower directional antenna system. This transmitter site has been in continuous use since that time. The transmitter used was an RCA 1-D which was kept until 1977. September 21, 1938 saw the infamous 1938 New England hurricane, which leveled all three towers between 5:00 and 5:20 p.m. WTAG operated from the 20 Franklin Street location until May 19, 1939 when the replacement of all three towers was completed. The replacement towers, self- supported and 375 feet (114 m) tall built by the Blaw-Knox company, are still in use today. WTAG's master control and studios were substantially renovated in 1939. The acoustics of the studio were much improved and theater seating allowed for an audience for live programming. The custom RCA mixing console was one of the largest built by RCA for a radio station. WTAG had its own orchestra and originated many music and dramatic shows from studio A. April 9, 1940 marked the beginning of daytime operation with power of 5,000 watts. Nighttime operation with 5,000 watts began January 2, 1942. Two additional Blaw-Knox towers were added to allow 5 kW directional night time operation. The five towers at the Holden site survived the Worcester Tornado in 1953. However, one of the towers was lost to Hurricane Carol in 1954. The nighttime directional pattern was reworked to use the four remaining towers. The fallen one was never replaced. Those four towers are still in use today. The station was the radio home of the Boston Red Sox in the Worcester area for forty years, from 1967 to 2006. The Red Sox' Worcester affiliation moved to WVEI and WCRN in 2007. Awards In 1945, WTAG received the Alfred I. duPont Award \\"for outstanding public service in encouraging, promoting and developing American ideals of freedom, and for loyal, devoted service to the nation and to the community\\" and the Peabody Award \\"for outstanding contribution to the welfare of the community it serves\\".

Green (who had directed The Jolson Story, \\"one of the biggest hits of the 40s\\") and starring Jackie Robinson as himself. The film focuses on Robinson's struggle with the abuse of bigots as he becomes the first African-American Major League Baseball player of the modern era. The film is among the list of films in the public domain in the United States. However a new copyrighted \\"restored and in color\\" version was released in conjunction with the Jackie Robinson Foundation in 2008. Plot The Jackie Robinson Story Screenplay cover Photo from 1950 Lobby card promoting The Jackie Robinson Story, showing Jackie Robinson (as himself) The film begins with Robinson as a boy. He is given a worn-out baseball glove by a stranger impressed by his fielding skills. As a young man, he becomes a multi- sport star at UCLA, but as he nears graduation, he worries about his future. His older brother Mack was also an outstanding college athlete and graduate, but the only job he could get was that of a lowly street cleaner. When America enters World War II, Robinson is drafted, serving as an athletic director. Afterward, he plays baseball with a professional African-American team. However, the constant travel keeps him away from his college sweetheart, Rae. Then one day, Brooklyn Dodgers scout Clyde Sukeforth invites him to meet Branch Rickey, president of the Major League Baseball team. At first, Robinson considers the offer to be a practical joke, as African Americans are not allowed to play in the segregated major leagues. When he is convinced that the opportunity is genuine, he and Rickey size each other up. After thinking over Rickey's warning about the hatred and abuse he would have to endure without being able to strike back, Robinson signs with the Dodgers' International League farm team, the Montreal Royals. Though he wants to delay marrying Rae to shield her, she insists on an immediate wedding so she can support her man in the trying times ahead. Robinson leads the league in hitting in his first year, and despite the grave concerns expressed by the Commissioner of Major League Baseball, Rickey goes ahead and promotes him to the Dodgers. Reviled at first by many of the fans and some of his own teammates, Robinson gets off to a shaky start, playing out of position at first base and going through a hitting slump, but then gradually wins people over with his talent and determination. The team goes on to win the pennant, with Robinson driving in the tying run and scoring the winning run in the deciding game. At the end, Robinson is invited to address the United States House of Representatives in Washington, D.C.

Much of the film was shot at Gilmore Field, home of the PCL Hollywood Stars. Reception Even during its initial release--in the era of racial segregation--the film received critical praise and fared well at the box office. According to Bosley Crowther, \\"What is surprising...in this new film ...is the sincerity of the dramatization and the integrity of Mr. Robinson playing himself. Too often, in films of this nature about sports figures, fanciful or real, the sentiments are inflated and the heroics glorified. Here the simple story of Mr. Robinson's trail-blazing career is re-enacted with manifest fidelity and conspicuous dramatic restraint. And Mr. Robinson, doing that rare thing of playing himself in the picture's leading role, displays a calm assurance and composure that might be envied by many a Hollywood star.\\" The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2006: AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers – Nominated Colorized version On April 19, 2005, 20th Century Fox and Legend Films released a colorized version of the film, donating a portion of the proceeds to the Jackie Robinson Foundation, a charity that benefits education for gifted students.

It is one of four high schools in Newmarket under the jurisdiction of the York Region District School Board (a fifth high school, Sacred Heart Catholic High School, is under the York Catholic District School Board) and currently educates students from Grades 9 to 12. It opened in December 2001. Prior to that, most of its students went to Newmarket High School. The founding students have demonstrated the initiative of character traits by creating original 'character feathers' which can be found in the main hall. The Newmarket Citizens' Band conducts rehearsals at Sir William Mulock Secondary School. Background The school is named after Sir William Mulock, an important figure in Canadian politics at the end of the 19th century, leading into the 20th century. He was one of the most prominent residents of Armitage, the first community established in King that has since been subsumed by Newmarket. The founding principal of SWMSS (Sir William Mulock Secondary School) was Reet Patterson. Carmen Spiteri-Johnson is the current principal, and approximately 1200 students attended the school during the 2010/11 school year. Sir William Mulock Secondary School offers a variety of programs in: Business, Laboratory Experiments, Earth & Space Sciences, Computer Studies, Engineering, Woodworking, Co-operative Education, Lifestyles, Fashion, English, Family Studies, Geography, Law & Politics, History, Library Studies, Biology/Medical Studies, Mathematics, Modern languages - French, Spanish, Latin, Portuguese, Chinese and Italian; Health, Music, Orchestral Studies, Dance, Physical Education, Science, Special Education, Technical Studies, Drama and Visual Arts. Mulock also offers many sports teams and clubs for students. The school is also limited in courses compared to other secondary schools in the area; this can be attributed to the relatively short establishment period. The first graduating class was in 2004. Feeder schools The main feeder schools for Sir William Mulock Secondary School are: * Rogers Public School * Crossland Public School * Clearmeadow Public School * Armitage Village Public School * Terry Fox Public School Blended Learning Starting the 2010/2011 year, the Grade 9 students of the school participated in a new program.

Born as Farqunda Ali Khan to Nizam Sikandar Jah and Fazilatunnisa Begum, Nasir-ud-Daulah ascended the throne in 1829. He inherited a financially weak kingdom. On his request, Lord William Bentinck withdrew all of the European superintendents of civil departments and followed a policy of non-intervention in the Nizam's affairs. The Nizam founded the Hyderabad Medical School in 1846; he also owed large debts to the Arabs, the Rohillas and the British, and in 1853 he signed a treaty with the British during the reign of Governor-General The Earl of Dalhousie. The British agreed to liquidate all of his debts in return for ceding part of his territory to the British. Early life Nasir-ud-Daulah was born as Mir Farkhunda Ali Khan in Bidar, at present-day Karnataka, India, on 25 April 1794. He was the eldest son of Nizam Sikandar Jah. Nasir-ud-Daulah's mother was Fazilatunnisa Begum, the favourite wife of his father. The Nizams were the erstwhile ruler of Hyderabad, the largest princely state of British India. Reign Nasir-ud- Daulah's father Nizam Sikandar Jah died on 21 May 1829. On 24 May, he ascended to the throne of Hyderabad. He inherited a financially troubled state because of the irregularities of the assistant revenue minister Maharaja Chandu Lal. Upon ascending the throne, possibly on the advice of Maharaja Chandu Lal, Nasir-ud-Daulah asked Lord William Bentinck, the Governor-General of India, to have Resident of Hyderabad Sir Charles Metcalfe stop interfering in matters of civil interest. The governor-general responded affirmatively and the European superintendents of civil departments were removed. Throughout his reign, Bentinck followed a policy of non-intervention in the affairs of the state. Because of the state's financial difficulties, Nasir-ud-Daulah found it difficult to pay his army. The state was becoming more and more indebted to the British. He mortgaged parts of his kingdom to the Arabs and the Rohillas. Smaller jagirdars (feudal landholders) also mortgaged their estates and as a result, these moneylenders controlled significant parts of the kingdom, including extensive parts of Bhir and Osmanabad districts. This made the zamindars (aristocrats) and the large jagirdars more arrogant. In Hingoli district, the Resident was forced to send troops to put down a rebellion. According to contemporaneous records, highway robbery, looting, murders and land-grabbing increased during Nasir-ud-Daulah's reign, and bribery and corruption became commonplace. The zamindars exploited the labourers. Fathulla Khan, a minister of the Nizam, said these activities occurred because of the withdrawal of British officers. In 1835, the Court of Directors of the East India Company revolted and wrote to the British government that there was a breakdown of law and order in the state of Hyderabad and that they could not ignore the misrule. In response, Nasir-ud-Daulah appointed some government workers as confidential servants to various districts of the state to monitor the activities of revenue officers, to suppress any oppression and to administer justice. The servants, however, were illiterate mansabdars (military officers) of low rank, and this system failed. These servants instead became agents of the taluqdars (landed gentry), who misused them to extort money from private individuals. Four years later, the Court of Directors wrote a similar letter. Nasir-ud-Daulah's younger brother, Prince Mubarez-ud-Daulah was inspired by the Wahhabi movement in India. He hated the British presence in the country and allegedly wanted to overthrow them and the Nizam. He struck a deal with Rasool Khan, the Nawab of Kurnool. With the help of his agents, the Resident of Hyderabad James Stuart Fraser intercepted their plans, then accused Mubarez-ud-Daulah of planning a conspiracy against Nasir- ud-Daulah. On 15 June 1839, Nasir-ud-Daulah ordered an attack on the palace of Mubarez-ud-Daulah, so that Mubarez-ud-Daulah could be arrested and held at Golconda Fort. Mubarez was successfully imprisoned, he remained so until his death in 1854. Under the guidance of Prime Minister Siraj-ul-Mulk (until his death in 1853) and the next Prime Minister Salar Jung I, Nasir-ud-Daulah established a modern revenue administration system. The kingdom was divided into 16 districts, each of which was administered by a taluqdar who was responsible for its judicial and civil administration. In 1846, Nasir-ud- Daulah founded the Hyderabad Medical School, which is now known as Osmania Medical College. He was interested in recruiting both men and women for the medical field. By 31 December 1850, Nasir-ud-Daulah's debts to the British had reached . By mid-1852, he found it difficult to pay his own officers. In 1853, he signed a treaty with the British government, during the rule of Governor- General The Earl of Dalhousie. According to this treaty, the British agreed to liquidate his debts in return for the Nizam ceding the Berar Province to the British. In return, the British paid the Nizam's officers. Death Makkah Masjid, Hyderabad, where Nasir-ud-Daulah is buried On 16 May 1857, Nasir-ud- Daulah died. He was buried at the Makkah Masjid mosque. He was succeeded by his son Afzal-ud-Daulah as the fifth Nizam of Hyderabad. Personal life Nasir-ud-Daulah had two nikkah wives. His first wife was Dilwarunnisa Begum, the daughter of an unranked officer in his court. His second wife was the daughter of an officer of a lower rank who worked at his palace. He fathered two sons- one from each wife. Afzal-ud-Daulah, born in October 1827, was his son from Dilwarunnisa Begum. Roshan-ud-Daulah, born March 1828, was his second son and was from his second wife. Titular Name Upon ascending the throne, Nasir-ud-Daulah took the following titular name: Asaf Jah, Muzaffar-ul- Mumamlik, Nizam-ul-Mulk, Nizam-ul-Daulah, Mir Farkhunda Ali Khan Bahadur, Fateh Jung, Sipah Salar, Ayn Waffadar, Rustam-i-Dauran, Arastu-i-Zaman, Fidvi- i-Senliena, Iqtidar-i-Kishwarsitan, Muhammad Akbar Shah, Padshah-i-Ghazi.

The family also operated a restaurant next door to its manufacturing facility on West 237th Street at the north end of Kingsbridge in the Bronx, New York City. In 1992 the family sold the business for $100 million to Nabisco, which became part of Kraft Foods in 2000.

History Joseph Kresevich, an immigrant from Trieste, Italy, began working in New York City bakeries after his arrival in the U.S. in 1922, and developed his own recipes. He married his wife, Angela, \\"an expert baker in her own right\\" in 1928. The two later founded the Stella D'Oro bakery, which evolved into the Stella D'oro Biscuit Company.Stella D'Oro: History (official site) The biscuits produced were less sweet than other Italian baked goods and marketed as an accompaniment to coffee and tea. Early on they made their cookies \\"pareve\\" (with neither meat nor dairy products), which appealed to a large and loyal New York kosher market. This early success led the company to relocate to a building at 237th and Broadway, in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx. Felice L. (Phil) Zambetti later became the company's CEO.\\"Paid Notice: Deaths: Zambetti, Felice L.

His economic standing and polite manners in Stalinist Poland earned him the nickname \\"the Gentleman Murderer\\" (elegancki morderca), also \\"piękny Władek\\" (the Handsome Władek).Artur Drożdżak (23 listopada 2013) Skazani na śmierć: Władysław Mazurkiewicz. Elegancki morderca. Gazeta Krakowska, Aktualności, via Internet Archive. Mazurkiewicz was arrested in 1955 and charged by the prosecution with six murders and two more attempted murders. He was convicted of killing four men and two women including Wiktor Zarzecki, Władysław Brylski, Józef Tomaszewski, and millionaire Jerzy de Laveaux along with his wife Jadwiga de Laveaux and her sister, Zofia Suchowa. He was tried by the regional court in Kraków and sentenced to death on August 30, 1956. He was executed by hanging six months later on January 29, 1957, two days before his 46th birthday. According to various rumours, Mazurkiewicz might have been responsible for as many as 30 murders, which were never confirmed. However, he himself pleaded not guilty, and claimed in court to have been beaten and blackmailed during interrogations. Life His mother died when Mazurkiewicz was 3 years old. He grew up with his father who was a printer by profession. After graduation in the newly reborn Poland, Mazurkiewicz enrolled at the Jagiellonian University department of law but dropped out. He was drafted during the September campaign. According to his own testimony, during the Nazi German occupation of Kraków, Mazurkiewicz made friends with the human resources chief of the local Gestapo, Rudolf Arnold, who issued him the Kennkarte of a Gestapo friseur which allowed him freedom of movement. He made a living by trading gold, money and diamonds illegally. His first murder victim was yet another gambler Wiktor Zarzecki poisoned by tainted tea in December 1943 and stripped of 1,200 dollars. After the war, Mazurkiewicz obtained a position with the Polish Red Cross, and worked as wine seller and driving instructor. In September 1955 he shot and wounded Stanisław Łopuszyński in Warsaw. His victim survived and contacted the police which led to his arrest and grand-scale investigation into his own crimes. His revolver was found, and he was recognized by the surviving victims. Nevertheless, Mazurkiewicz claimed in court to have signed an admission of guilt under torture.

It is often performed electronically, either by combining sine waves (additive synthesis) or by filtering out harmonics from more complex waves (subtractive synthesis). Timbre composition is also significant for players of the electric guitar. The guitarist's relative proximity to his or her amplifier alters the sound produced. The sound can be modified further via equalizers, filters, and various effects pedals. Timbre composition with acoustic instruments is usually very subtle. Minute altercations in performance change the sound produced by the instrument. Percussionists use specific sticks and mallets to yield desired timbres. Players of wind instruments alter the tone simply by changing the pressure of their lips. One could argue that the act of choosing which instrument to play or write for is in itself timbre composition. Timbre composition is used in vocal techniques such as throat-singing where the main focus of the music is timbre as opposed to pitch. Music that has been composed solely using the art of Timbre composition is called Timbre-centered music. Timbral listening is a technique used in both the composition and reception of Timbre-centered music which has been created using Timbre composition.

In 1561 Morinobu was adopted into the Nishina clan of Shinano Province as part of Shingen's plan to cement his control over the province. When the invasion of the Takeda territory by the Oda-Tokugawa alliance began in late 1581, Morinobu took on the responsibility of defending Takato Castle (高遠城) in southern Shinano, along with one of his allies, Oyamada Masayuki. As he fortified himself in the castle, Oda Nobutada, the designated successor of Oda Nobunaga and commander of the Oda army, sent a Buddhist priest to negotiate surrender. However, Morinobu responded by cutting off the nose and ears of the priest and was killed in the subsequent attack at the castle. Before he conducted seppuku prior to the fall of the castle, he told attacking Oda soldiers of his prediction of Nobunaga's death, which soon came to pass.

The group formed in 1997, when Beans, High Priest, M. Sayyid, and producer Earl Blaize met at a poetry slam in New York City. They are notable for their stream-of- consciousness lyrics and musical references to contemporary composition methods. History The group released several tape singles and two albums primarily on Dan the Automator's experimental hip-hop label 75 Ark before being signed by Warp Records in 2000. Their releases were met with mixed reviews from the mainstream music and underground hip-hop press alike, although they are noted for their inventiveness and the experimental electronic productions contributed by all members. They were frequently compared to other rappers with unorthodox lyrics, such as Kool Keith, MF Doom and Aesop Rock. In 2001, they opened for Radiohead during the European leg of their Amnesiac tour and subsequently toured with DJ Shadow. The group disbanded due to creative differences in August 2002, with Beans pursuing a solo career while High Priest and M. Sayyid formed Airborn Audio, which released a single album, Good Fortune, on Ninja Tune in 2005, and toured with The Faint and Bright Eyes. All three members have pursued solo projects since the group's breakup. Antipop completed their third album before they broke up, released in February 2003 as Antipop Consortium vs. Matthew Shipp. They reunited in 2007. In an August 2007 interview, the four members stated that they reunited with the intention of touring and releasing a new record. They played a reunion show at the Knitting Factory of New York City in March 2008 and formed part of the support for Public Enemy on the It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back Don't Look Back British tour in May 2008. They have played at the 2009 ATP VS the Fans festival in Minehead, UK, followed by the Incubate Festival in Tilburg, Netherlands the following week. After releasing their reunion album Fluorescent Black on Big Dada Records in 2009, the group has been touring steadily. Playing shows in Pontiac, Michigan; Futuresonic at Urbis in Manchester, UK (May 14, 2009), as well as appearing at the South By Southwest Music Festival in Austin, Texas in 2010.

In Japanese the first are called , the second . The shogunates or leaders of Japan have made it a priority to update and rebuild Buddhist temples since the Momoyama period. The Japanese word for a Buddhist temple is (kun reading), and the same kanji also has the pronunciation ji (on reading), so that temple names frequently end in -dera or -ji. Another ending, , is normally used to refer to minor temples. Such famous temples as Kiyomizu-dera, Enryaku-ji, and Kōtoku-in are temples which use the described naming pattern. Etymology The Japanese word for a Buddhist temple was anciently also written phonetically 天良 tera, and is cognate with the Modern Korean Chǒl from Middle Korean Tiel, the Jurchen Taira and the reconstructed Old Chinese *dɘiaʁ, all meaning \\"Buddhist Monastery\\". These words are apparently derived from the Aramaic word for \\"Monastery\\" dērā/ dairā/ dēr (from the root dwr \\"to live together\\"), rather than from the unrelated and later Indian word for monastery vihara, and may have been transmitted by the first Central Asian translators of Buddhist scriptures, such as An Shigao or Lokaksema. Buddhist and Shinto structures A torii at the entrance of Shitennō-ji, a Buddhist temple in Osaka In Japan, Buddhist temples co-exist with Shinto shrines, and both share the basic features of Japanese traditional architecture. Both Torii and rōmon mark the entrance to a shrine as well as temples although torii is associated with Shinto and Romon is associated with Buddhism. Some shrines, for example Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū, have a Buddhist-style main gate called sōmon. Many temples have a temizuya and komainu, like a shrine. Conversely, some shrines make use of incense or have a shōrō belltower. Others – for example, Tanzan Jinja in Nara – may even have a pagoda. Honden of the Zennyo Ryūō shrine, inside a Shingon temple in KyotoSimilarities between temples and shrines are also functional. Like a shrine, a Buddhist temple is not primarily a place of worship: its most important buildings are used for the safekeeping of sacred objects (the honzon, equivalent to a shrine's shintai), and are not accessible to worshipers. Unlike a Christian church, a temple is also a monastery. There are specialized buildings for certain rites, but these are usually open only to a limited number of participants. Religious mass gatherings do not take place with regularity as with Christian religions, and are in any event not held inside the temple. If many people are involved in a ceremony, it will assume a festive character and will be held outdoors. The architectural elements of a Buddhist temple are meant to embody themes and teachings of Buddhism. The reason for the great structural resemblances between the Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines lies in their common history. When Shintoism first encountered Buddhism it became more interpretive as it did not try to explain the universe as Buddhism sometimes tried to. It is in fact normal for a temple to have been also a shrine, and in architectural terms, obvious differences between the two are therefore few, so much so that often only a specialist can see them. Many visitors visit Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines for similar reasons such as prayer and for luck. The two religions coexist due to increased popularity of religions and the birth of new religions. Shrines enshrining local kami existed long before the arrival of Buddhism, but they consisted either of demarcated land areas without any building or of temporary shrines, erected when needed.Fujita, Koga (2008:20-21) With the arrival of Buddhism in Japan in the 6th century, shrines were subjected to its influence and adopted both the concept of permanent structures and the architecture of Buddhist temples. A Buddhist-style gate (karamon) at Iwashimizu Hachiman-gūThe successive development of shinbutsu- shūgō (syncretism of Buddhism and kami worship) and of the honji suijaku theory brought to the almost complete fusion of kami worship and Buddhism. It became normal for shrines to be accompanied by temples in mixed complexes called or .The fact was reflected in their name. Kamakura's Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū, for example, was then called Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gūji, or Tsurugaoka Shrine-temple. The opposite was also common: most temples had at least a small shrine dedicated to its tutelary kami, and were therefore called . The Meiji era eliminated most jingūji, but left jisha intact, so much so that even today most temples have at least one, sometimes very large, shrine on their premises and Buddhist goddess Benzaiten is often worshiped at Shinto shrines.An extant example of the syncretic fusion of Buddhism and Shinto is Seiganto-ji, part of the Kumano Sanzan shrine complex. It is one of the few jingūji still in existence after the forcible separation of Shinto and Buddhism operated by the Japanese government during the Meiji restoration. For details of the subject of shrine-temples, see the article Shinbutsu shūgō. As a consequence, for centuries shrines and temples had a symbiotic relationship where each influenced the other. Shrines took from Buddhism its gates (Mon), the use of a hall for lay worshipers, the use of vermilion-colored wood and more, while Chinese Buddhist architecture was adapted to Japanese tastes with more asymmetrical layouts, greater use of natural materials, and an adaptation of the monastery to the pre-existing natural environment., p=47 The clear separation between Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, which today is the norm, emerges only as a result of the shinbutsu bunri (\\"separation of kami and Buddhas\\") law of 1868. This separation was mandated by law, and many shrine- temples were forced to become just shrines, among them famous ones like Usa Hachiman-gū and Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū. Because mixing the two religions was now forbidden, jingūji had to give away some of their properties or dismantle some of their buildings, thus damaging the integrity of their cultural heritage and decreasing the historical and economic value of their properties.Kamakura Official Textbook for Culture and Tourism For example, Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū's giant Niō (the two wooden wardens usually found at the sides of a temple's entrance), being objects of Buddhist worship and therefore illegal where they were, were sold to Jufuku-ji, where they still are.Mutsu (1995:172) The shrine-temple also had to destroy Buddhism-related buildings, for example its tahōtō, its midō, and its shichidō garan. Architecture =General features= The roof is the dominant feature of a Buddhist temple. Buddhist architecture in Japan is not native, but imported from China and other Asian cultures over the centuries with such constancy that the building styles of all Six Dynasties are represented. Its history is, as a consequence, dominated by Chinese and other Asian techniques and styles (present even in Ise Shrine, held to be the quintessence of Japanese architecture) on one side, and by Japanese original variations on those themes on the other.Hozumi (1996:9-11) Partly due also to the variety of climates in Japan and the millennium encompassed between the first cultural import and the last, the result is extremely heterogeneous, but several practically universal features can be found nonetheless. First of all is the choice of materials, always wood in various forms (planks, straw, tree bark, etc.) for almost all structures. Unlike both Western and some Chinese architecture, the use of stone is avoided except for certain specific uses, for example temple podia and pagoda foundations. The general structure is almost always the same: post and lintel support a large and gently curved roof, while the walls are paper- thin, often movable and in any case non-carrying. The post and lintel structure embodies the Axis Mundi of the an iconic form of the Buddha which is typically represented in Pagodas and Indian Stupas. Arches and barrel roofs are completely absent. Gable and eave curves are gentler than in China and columnar entasis (convexity at the center) limited. The roof is the most visually impressive component, often constituting half the size of the whole edifice. The slightly curved eaves extend far beyond the walls, covering verandas, and their weight must therefore be supported by complex bracket systems called tokyō. These oversize eaves give the interior a characteristic dimness, which contributes to the temple's atmosphere. The interior of the building normally consists of a single room at the center called moya, from which sometimes depart other less important spaces, for example corridors called hisashi. Inner space divisions are fluid, and room size can be modified through the use of screens or movable paper walls. The large, single space offered by the main hall can therefore be altered according to the need. The separation between inside and outside is itself in some measure not absolute as entire walls can be removed, opening the temple to visitors. Verandas appear to be part of the building to an outsider, but part of the external world to those in the temple. Structures are therefore made to a certain extent part of their environment. The use of construction modules keeps proportions between different parts of the edifice constant, preserving its overall harmony.(On the subject of temple proportions, see also the article ken). Even in cases as that of Nikkō Tōshō-gū, where every available space is heavily decorated, ornamentation tends to follow, and therefore emphasize rather than hide, basic structures. Being shared by both sacred and profane architecture, these architectonic features made it easy converting a lay building into a temple. This happened for example at Hōryū-ji, where a noblewoman's mansion was transformed into a religious building. Buddhist architecture of the Heian Period consisted of the re-emergence of national tastes. The temple Hojoji represents paradise and the pure land which embodies elements of Pure Land Buddhism. The last formal temple was Motsuji. Muroji is a temple complex found below the mountain of Mount Muro. The area behind the temple is sacred and is off limits to visitors and pilgrims. The caves of Mount Muro are especially sacred. The famous Dragon Cave is the thought to house the Dragon King who protects the country. This is an example of how natural elements are sacred aspects of Buddhist Temples. There are four great temples of the seventh century: Askuadera, Kudara Odera, Kawaradera, and Yakushiji. = Four great temples of the seventh century =  Asuka-Dera  This great hall had three golden halls and was the first full scale temple. It was the most significant temple in the Asuka period. The founder of Asukadera was Soga no Umako and he had built a smaller scaled residence similar to the great hall. Many royal palaces were built in this natural environment for centuries later. When visited today it barely holds its grandeur it once had as there are no clear marks of where the original halls were and now the main scene is the parking lot with tour buses.  Kudara Odera  The foundation remains might be those of the remains found on the site of Kibi Pond (Kibi Ike). This grand temple had a nine-story pagoda which was constructed at the beginnings of Buddhism in Japan.  Kawaradera  The excavations and reconstruction of Kawaradera help us understand what it originally looked like. The plan originally had two golden halls with a pagoda and then residential spaces for monks. It was in an asymmetrical arrangement which was very new and innovative for this time. Sources lack in the history of its construction and who commissioned it.  Yakushiji  In the early eighth century this temple was constructed in Nara and has been reproduced into the original layout today. The monumental Yakushi triad exists here. The structure is in bright colors as it also would have originally been. =History= Ichijō-ji's pagoda is an example of the wayō style The architecture of Buddhist temples, as that of any structure, has changed and developed over the centuries. However, while the particular details may vary, the general themes and styles have strong similarities and common origins. The already mentioned Hōryū-ji was one of the first Buddhist temples built in Japan. Its primary structures represent the style current in 6th century CE Sui dynasty China. The Kondō (Golden Hall) is a double-roofed structure, supported by thick, strong pillars, and giving a feeling of boldness and weight. Most Buddhist temples in Japan belong to one of four main styles: * Wayō - A style developed in art and architecture in Japan during the Heian period by the esoteric sects Tendai and Shingon on the basis of contemporary Chinese architecture. So called to distinguish it from imported Chinese styles, in architecture it was characterized by simplicity, refraining from ornamentation, use of natural timber and in general plain materials. *Daibutsuyō - a Japanese religious architectural style which emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century on the basis of contemporary Chinese architecture. Introduced by priest Chōgen, this grandiose and monumental style was based on Song Dynasty architecture and was the antithesis of the simple and traditional wayō style. The Nandaimon at Tōdai-ji and the Amida Hall at Jōdo-ji are the only extant examples of this style., p=737, p=20 *Zenshūyō - A style which takes its name from its creators, the Buddhist Zen sect, and which emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century on the basis of contemporary Chinese architecture. The zenshūyō was originally called but, like the Daibutsu style, was renamed by Ōta Hirotarō, a 20th-century scholar. Its characteristics are earthen floors, decorative curved pent roofs (mokoshi) and pronouncedly curved main roofs, cusped windows (katōmado) and paneled doors., p=738 Typical of the style is also the main hall (Butsuden), which has just one story but seems to have two because it has a covered pent roof called mokoshi. *Setchūyō - an architectural style born in Japan during the Muromachi period from the fusion of elements from three preceding styles, the wayō, the daibutsuyō and zen'yō. It is exemplified by the main hall at Kakurin-ji., p=44 The combination of wayō and daibutsuyō in particular became so frequent that sometimes it is classed separately by scholars under the name . =Layout and geomantic positioning= Part of Tōshōdai-ji's garan (left to right, the kondō, the kōdō, the korō and the Raiō)Buddhist temple complexes consist of a number of structures arranged according to certain concepts or guidelines. The arrangement of the major buildings () changed over time. An early pattern had a gate, tower, kondō and kodō in a straight line from south to north. Corridors extended east and west from the flanks of the gate, then turned north, and finally joined north of the kōdo, forming a cloister around the pagoda and the major halls. This pattern, typified by Shitennō-ji in Osaka, came from China via Baekje; the Chinese style of Buddhist temples, though altered somewhat by China via Korean peninsula, ultimately was based on that of Chinese palaces, and this is evident in many of the basic design features which remain today in the temples of all three countries. A Buddhist temple complex in Japan generally follows the pattern of a series of sacred spaces encircling a courtyard, and entered via a set of gates. These gates will typically have a pair of large guardian statues, called Niō. In addition, many of the more important or powerful temples are built in locations which are favorable according to the precepts of Chinese geomancy. For example, Enryaku- ji, which sits atop Mount Hiei to the north-east of Kyoto, is said to defend the city from evil spirits by being placed in that direction. The arrangements of mountains and other geographic features in particular directions around the temple play important roles as well. This custom continued for a long time. Eight centuries after the founding of Enryaku-ji, the Tokugawa shogunate established Kan'ei-ji in a similar direction for the protection of their Edo Castle. Its mountain-name, Mount Tōei (東叡山 Tōei-zan), takes a character from Mount Hiei (比叡山 Hiei-zan), and can be interpreted as meaning \\"the Mount Hiei of the East.\\" Kamakura's Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū is now only a Shinto shrine but, before the of 1868, its name was and it was also a Buddhist temple, one of the oldest of the city.Kamakura Shōkō Kaigijo (2008: 56-57) The temple and the city were built with Feng Shui in mind. The present location was carefully chosen as the most propitious after consulting a diviner because it had a mountain to the north (the ), a river to the east (the Namerikawa) and a great road to the west (the ), and was open to the south (on Sagami Bay).Ōnuki (2008:80) Each direction was protected by a god: Genbu guarded the north, Seiryū the east, Byakko the west and Suzaku the south. The willows near the ponds and the catalpas next to the Museum of Modern Art represent respectively Seiryū and Byakko. Geomancy lost in importance during the Heian period as temple layout was adapted to the natural environment, disregarding feng shui. In addition to geomantic considerations, Buddhist temples, like any other religious structures, need to be organized in order to best serve their various purposes. The most important space in any Buddhist temple complex is the sacred space where images of Buddhas and bodhisattvas are kept, and where important rituals are performed. Zuiryū-ji These areas are always separated from those accessible to the lay worshipers, though the distance between the two and the manner of their separation is quite varied. In many temples, there is little more than a wooden railing dividing the sacred space with that of the laypeople, but in many others there is a significant distance, perhaps a graveled courtyard, between the two. Another structure or space of great importance accommodates the physical day-to-day needs of the clergy. Spaces for eating, sleeping and studying are essential, particularly in those temples that serve as monasteries. According to a 13th-century text,Shōtoku Taishi's Denkokonmokurokushō (聖徳太子伝古今目録抄) \\"a garan is a temple with a kon-dō (main hall), a tō (pagoda), a kō-dō (lecture hall), a shōrō (belfry), a jiki-dō (refectory), a sōbō (monks' living quarters), and a kyōzō (scriptures deposit, library).\\"Kōsetsu Bukkyō Daijiten (広説仏教語大辞典) These are the seven listed as shichidō elements of a The six Buddhist schools , introduced to Japan during the Asuka and Nara periods temple.Iwanami Kōjien A 15th-century text describes how Zen school temples (Sōtō (), Rinzai ())The Ōbaku School () arrived in Japan in the 17th century. included a butsuden or butsu-dō (main hall), a hattō (lecture hall), a kuin (kitchen/office), a sō-dō (building dedicated to Zazen), a sanmon (main gate), a tōsu (toilet) and a yokushitsu (bath).

Its three openings (, and ) symbolize the three gates to enlightenment. Entering, one can free himself from three passions (貪 ton, or greed, 瞋 shin, or hatred, and 癡 chi, or \\"foolishness\\"). See also mon. Its size depends on the temple's rank. (See photos.) *sanrō (山廊) – small buildings at the ends of a two-storied Zen gate containing the stairs to the second story. *sekitō (石塔) – a stone pagoda (stupa). See also tō *shichidō garan (七堂伽藍) – a double compound term literally meaning \\"seven halls\\" (七堂) and \\"(temple) buildings\\" (伽藍). What is counted in the group of seven buildings, or shichidō, can vary greatly from temple to temple and from school to school. In practice, shichidō garan can also mean simply a large complex. **Nanto Rokushū and later non-Zen schools: The shichidō garan in this case includes a kon-dō, a tō, a kō-dō, a shōrō, a jiki- dō, a sōbō, and a kyōzō. **Zen schools: A Zen shichidō garan includes a butsuden or butsu-dō, a hattō, a ku'in, a sō-dō, a sanmon, a tōsu and a yokushitsu. *shoin (書院) – originally a study and a place for lectures on the sutra within a temple, later the term came to mean just a study. *shōrō (鐘楼) – a temple's belfry, a building from which a bell is hung. *sōbō (僧坊) – The monks' living quarters in a non-Zen garan *sō-dō (僧堂) – Lit. \\"monk hall\\". A building dedicated to the practice of Zazen. It used to be dedicated to all kinds of activities, from eating to sleeping, centered on zazen. *sōmon (総門) – the gate at the entrance of a temple. It precedes the bigger and more important sanmon. See also mon. *sōrin (相輪) – a spire reaching up from the center of the roof of some temple halls, tiered like a pagoda. *sotoba or sotōba (卒塔婆) – transliteration of the Sanskrit stupa. **A pagoda. Tower with an odd number of tiers (three, five, seven nine, or thirteen). See also stupa. **Strips of wood left behind tombs during annual ceremonies (tsuizen) symbolizing a stupa. The upper part is segmented like a pagoda and carries Sanskrit inscriptions, sutras, and the kaimyō (posthumous name) of the deceased. In present-day Japanese, sotoba usually has the latter meaning. *stupa – in origin a vessel for Buddha's relics, later also a receptacle for scriptures and other relics. Its shape changed in the Far East under the influence of the Chinese watchtower to form tower-like structures like the Tōbuttō, the gorintō, the hōkyōintō, the sekitō, the tō, or the much simpler wooden stick-style sotoba. *tatchū (塔頭 or 塔中) **In Zen temples, a building containing a pagoda enshrining the ashes of an important priest stands. **Later, it became a subsidiary temple or a minor temple depending from a larger one. **Finally, it became also subsidiary temple being the family temple (bodaiji) of an important family. *tahōtō (多宝塔) – a two-storied pagoda with a ground floor having a dome-shaped ceiling and a square pent roof, a round second floor and square roofs. *temizuya (手水舎) – a fountain near the entrance of a shrine and a temple where worshipers can cleanse their hands and mouths before worship. *tesaki (手先) – Term used to count the roof-supporting brackets (tokyō (斗きょう)) projecting from a temple's wall, usually composed of two steps (futatesaki (二手先）)) or three (mitesaki 三津手先). *tokyō (斗きょう) – see tesaki. *torii (鳥居)- the iconic Shinto gate at the entrance of a sacred area, usually, but not always, a shrine. Shrines of various size can be found next to, or inside temples. *tōrō (灯籠) – a lantern at a shrine or Buddhist temple. Some of its forms are influenced by the gorintō. *-tō (塔) **A pagoda, and an evolution of the stupa. After reaching China, the stupa evolved into a tower with an odd number of tiers (three, five, seven, nine, thirteen), excepted the tahōtō, which has two. **The word is used together as a suffix of a numeral indicating the number of a pagoda's tiers (three tiers= san-jū-no-tō, five tiers= go-jū-no-tō, seven tiers = nana-jū-no-tō, etc.). *tōsu or tōshi (東司) – a Zen monastery's toilet. *Yakushi-dō (薬師堂) – a building that enshrines a statue of Yakushi Nyorai.* *yokushitsu* (浴室) – a monastery's bathroom. *zen-dō (禅堂) – lit. \\"hall of Zen\\". The building where monks practice zazen, and one of the main structures of a Zen garan. Temple names A temple's name ( or ) is usually made of three parts. The first is the , the second is the and the third is the . =Sangō= Even though they may be located at the bottom of a valley, temples are metaphorically called mountains and even the numbers used to count them carry the ending , hence the name sangō. This tradition goes back to the times when temples were primarily monasteries purposely built in remote mountainous areas. The founding of a temple is called for this reason. No fixed rules for its formation exist, but the sangō is basically topographical in origin, as in Hieizan Enryaku-ji: these two names together mean \\"Mount Hiei's Enryaku-ji\\". For this reason it is sometimes used as a personal name, particularly in Zen. There may be however some other semantic relationship between the sangō and the san'in-jigō, as for example in the case of Rurikōzan Yakushi-ji. The sangō and the jigō are simply different names of the same god. Sometimes the sangō and the jigō are both posthumous names, for example of the founder's mother and father. =Ingō= The character , which gives the ingō its name, originally indicated an enclosure or section and therefore, by analogy, it later came to mean a cloister in a monastery. It is in this sense which it is applied to temples or, more often, subtemples. It can be also found in the name of formerly minor temples risen by chance to great prominence. For example, Kawagoe's Kita-in used to be one of three subtemples of a temple which no longer exist. Less frequent in an ingō are and . is normally used in the name of particular buildings of a temple's compound, e.g. Kannon-dō, but can be employed as a name of minor or small temples. =Jigō= The only name in common use is however the jigō, (ending in ) which can then be considered the main one. The sangō and ingō are not, and never were, in common use. The character -ji it contains is sometimes pronounced tera or dera as in Kiyomizu-dera, normally when the rest of the name is an indigenous name (kun'yomi). =Unofficial names= Temples are sometimes known by an unofficial but popular name. This is usually topographical in origin, as for example in the case of Asakusa's Sensō-ji, also known as Asakusa-dera. A temple can also be named after a special or famous characteristic, as for example in the case Kyoto's Saihō-ji, commonly called Koke-dera, or \\"moss temple\\" because of its famous moss garden. Unofficial names can have various other origins.

Phallocentrism has been analyzed in literary criticism, psychoanalysis and psychology, linguistics, medicine and health care, and philosophy. First phase The term was coined in 1927 by Ernest Jones, as part of his debate with Freud over the role of the phallic stage in childhood development, when he argued that “men analysts have been led to adopt an unduly phallo-centric view”.Quoted in K. K. Reithven, Feminist Literary Studies (1990) p. 54 Drawing on the earlier arguments of Karen Horney,P. Gay, Freud (1989) p. 520 Jones, in a series of articles, maintained the position that women were not disappointed creatures driven by penis envy. Instead, this belief was itself a theoretical defense against castration anxiety. Freud, however, remained unmoved in his opposition to the Horney/Jones thesis,S. Freud, On Sexuality (PFL 7) p. 391-2 and his was the predominant psychoanalytic position thereafter, though some like Janet Malcolm would modify his position to the effect that “Freud's concept, of course, is... a description of phallocentrism, not a recommendation of it”.Janet Malcolm, The Silent Woman (1995) p. 87 Second phase Jacques Lacan added a linguistic turn to the debate with his article “The Signification of the Phallus” (1958/65), arguing that the phallus was not a part-object, an imaginary object, or a physical organ, but rather “the signifier intended to designate as a whole the effects of the signified... this signifying function of the phallus”.J. Lacan, Ecrits (1997) p. 285-8 Jacques Derrida challenged his thesis as phallocentric, and the charge was taken up by second-wave feminism,J. Childers ed., The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (1995) p. 225 extending the focus of protest from Lacan to Freud,P. Gay, Freud (1989) p. 774 psychoanalysis, and male-centered thinking as a whole:E. Ermath, Sequel to History (1992) p. 172-3 the way that “[t]he phallus, centre of meaning, became man's identity with himself... a masculine symbolic”.Andrea Nye, quoted in E. Ermath, Sequel to History (1992) p. 172-3 However conflict arose within feminism over the issue.E. Amour, Deconstruction (1999) p. 207 Some French feminists, seeing phallocentrism and feminism as two sides of the same coin, sought to make a postphallicist breakthrough.E. Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan (2005) p. 365 Others, like the English feminist Jacqueline Rose, while accepting that “Lacan was implicated in the phallocentrism he described,”J. Rose ed., Feminine Sexuality (1982) p. 56 nevertheless considered his analysis as important for an understanding of how women were constituted as a split subject in society. Third phase From a postcolonial perspective, however, such theoretical debates revealed the irrelevance of first world feminists, with their phallocentric preoccupations, to the ordinary life of the subaltern woman in the Third World;P. Mackay, Kathy Acker and Transnationalism (2009) p. 94 and third-wave feminism, with its concern for the marginalised, the particular, and for intersectionality, has also broadly seen the theoreticism and essentialism of feminism's earlier concern for phallocentrism as irrelevant to daily female experience.L. Heywood, Third Wave Agenda (1997) p. 135 Gayatri Spivak suggests that feminism needs to negotiate an accommodation with phallocentrism.G. C.

It offers undergraduate degrees in finance. The curriculum is focused on public finance, with an emphasis on government policy and regulation. Upon completion of their study, PKN STAN graduates serve in government institutions in Indonesia especially in the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia (Directorate General of Taxes, Directorate of Customs and Excise, etc.). PKN STAN director is Mr. Rahmadi Murwanto. Government affiliation PKN STAN is a government-affiliated college which means that the college is administered and funded by the government of Indonesia through the institution it is affiliated to. The government institution affiliated to PKN STAN is the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia. This affiliation with the government results in cost of education not being charged to the students of the college. In return, the graduates of the college are obliged to serve in government institutions in Indonesia. The Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia gets the largest number of graduates every year. The other government institutions get a portion of the college graduates allocation are the Government Accountability Office of the Republic of Indonesia (Badan Pemeriksa Keuangan Republik Indonesia/ BPK RI)and the Financial and Development Supervisory Agency (Badan Pengawasan Keuangan dan Pembangunan / BPKP). In previous years, there is a record of allocation of graduates to the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprise of Indonesia. Academic programs PKN STAN offers Diploma I Program, Diploma III Program, and Diploma IV Program. These programs are tailored to create professionals in public sector (government). Therefore, the courses in the college are a combination of economics, law, and public administration. Every year, the students in PKN STAN are evaluated. They have to achieve a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.75 out of 4.0. =Diploma I Program= Diploma I Program is a one-year program intended to create professionals with basic skills needed in the government sector. The program consists of 50 credits with three areas of specialization: * Customs and Excise * Taxation * Treasury =Diploma III Program= Diploma III Program is a three-year program intended to create professionals with skills needed in the government sector. The program consists of 120 credits with six areas of specialization: * Accounting * Taxation * Property Appraisal * Receivable and Auction Administration * Customs and Excise * Treasury Since the students serve in government institutions upon completion of their study, the courses taught in the program have emphasis on the public sector, especially the government sector. The curriculum also includes accounting in the private sector to enrich the knowledge of the students. Upon graduation, the students receive Ahli Madya (A.Md), a professional degree in Indonesia. For the D-I program, students can continue to the D-III program after working for two years in the government institutions (Ministry of Finance); students graduated from D-I program can only major to D-III program for specialization in accounting. =Diploma IV Program in Accounting= Diploma IV Program in Accounting is a two-year program that can only be taken after students finish the D-III program. The program has one area of specialization in accounting. Prospective students graduated from D-III program with specialization other than accounting conduct an additional semester of matriculation courses. The majority of the students admitted in the D-IV program have professional work experience in government institutions. Upon graduation, the students receive Bachelor of Science's degree in accounting. =Admissions= Admission to PKN STAN's D-III program is open to high school graduates. The general requirement is that applicants have graduated from high school no more than three years before the admission year. The applicants have to pass the intake examination. Admission to the D-III program is extremely competitive. On average every year, the college receives no less than 85,000 applications and accepts only around 1,300 to 1,500 students (1.5%-1.8%). This means at least 57 people fought for each place, which is one of the highest ratios of any higher education institution in Indonesia. In 2007 admission year, 125.000 high school graduates competed for 2.014 available seat. Due to the selectivity of the school, most PKN STAN students arrive at the school with significantly higher grades. Admission to STAN's D-IV program can only be done by students who have completed the D-III program and must complete a period of service in government institutions. They also have to pass the intake examination. =Student life= The college does not provide campus housings or dormitories, so the students usually rent a room or a house nearby the campus. There are many rooms and houses available for rent by the students in the campus areas.

An elliptical wing is a wing planform whose leading and trailing edges each approximate two segments of an ellipse. It is not to be confused with annular wings, which may be elliptically shaped. Properties Theoretically, the most efficient way to create lift is to generate it in an elliptical spanwise distribution across the wing.Clancy (1975) sections 5.17, 5.25 and 8.14 There is no inherent superiority to pure elliptical shapes, and wings with other planforms can be optimized to give elliptical spanwise lift distributions. The basic elliptical wing shape also has disadvantages: *The almost uniform lift distribution of a constant-aerofoil section elliptical wing can cause the entire span of the wing to stall simultaneously, potentially causing loss of control with little warning. To improve the stalling characteristics and give the pilot some warning, designers use a non-uniform aerofoil. For example, the wing of the Supermarine Spitfire was both thinned towards the tips and twisted to give washout, reducing the load on the tips so that the inner wing would stall first.\\"Spitfire\\"\\", Aeroplane icons No. 14, Kelsey, 2013, Page33.'Smith, J.; \\"The development of the Spitfire and Seafire\\", Journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society, 1947, Pages 343. Such compromises depart from the theoretical elliptical lift distribution, increasing induced drag. An elliptical spanwise lift distribution cannot be achieved by an untwisted wing with an elliptical planform because there is a logarithmic term in the lift distribution that becomes important near the wing tips. Jordan, P.F. \\"On Lifting Wings with Parabolic Tips\\", ZAMM, 54, pp. 463--477, 1974. *Elliptical wing planforms are more difficult to manufacture. In it, either leading edge or trailing edge or both are curved, and the ribs change in a non uniform way along the wingspan. In practice, most elliptical wings are approximations, for example several sections of the Spitfire leading and trailing edges are arcs of circles. The semi-elliptical wing For a wing to have an elliptical area distribution, it is not necessary for both the leading and trailing edges to have an elliptical shape. If one of these is straight, as in the semi- elliptical planform, the wing will still have an elliptical area distribution. Several aircraft of this type have been produced, one of the most successful being the American Seversky P-35. History Few aircraft have used the elliptical wing, and even fewer have seen mass production, most in the 1950s and 60s. It was first used in the 1920s, [see Bäumer B II \\"Sausewind\\" of 1925]. The Supermarine S.4 racing seaplane flew in 1925. It failed to win its race but its designer, Reginald Mitchell, would later return to a near- elliptical planform for the Supermarine Spitfire, which first flew in 1936. The German Heinkel He 70 \\"Blitz\\" of the early 1930s was a fast mail plane and reconnaissance bomber, and the predecessor to the Heinkel He 111 bomber, early models of which used an elliptical wing. Almost all of the United States Republic P-47 Thunderbolts used elliptical wings, except the last models, which had squared-off wingtips (as did low-altitude Spitfire variants). The Imperial Japanese Navy used an elliptical wing very similar to that of the He 70 on their Aichi D3A dive bomber. The Mitsubishi A5M also utilized elliptical wings. Several other types had planforms which differed relatively little from the elliptical. The Hawker Tempest II, which later developed into the Hawker Fury and Hawker Sea Fury, also utilised a near-eliptical wing planform, although squared off at the tips. The British Aircraft company Swift Aircraft are currently developing a two-seater Very Light Aircraft, Light-sport aircraft and CS-23 category Aircraft, the Swift Aircraft Swift, featuring elliptical wings.

This is a modern practice derived from the art and Roman Catholic practice in mediaeval scriptoria of rubricating headings, leading letters of sectional text, and words of text in manuscripts for emphasis, similar to italicization. History The inspiration for rubricating the Dominical words comes from Luke, 22:20: \\"This cup is the new testament in my blood, which I shed for you.\\" On 19 June 1899, Louis Klopsch, then editor of The Christian Herald magazine, conceived the idea while working on an editorial. Klopsch asked his mentor Rev. Thomas De Witt Talmage what he thought of a testament with the Dominical words rubricated and Dr. Talmage replied, \\"It could do no harm and it most certainly could do much good.\\" Klopsch published the first modern red letter edition New Testament later in 1899. The first modern, fully rubricated bible was published in 1901. The rubricated bible instantly became popular, and is sometimes favored by Protestant Christians in the United States. Especially in King James Version editions, this format is useful because quotation marks are absent. Qualifications Because the original texts of the Sacred Scriptures do not have quotation marks, which words exactly are Dominical has been interpreted, as opposed to explanatory text that follows them. For example, a footnote in the New International Version for John, 3:21 explains that \\"Some interpreters end the quotation after verse 15.\\"HOLY BIBLE, NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION. Copyright © 1973, 1978, 1984 International Bible Society. In addition, some publishers have chosen to rubricate the Dominical words after His Ascension to Heaven, for example, His words spoken to Saul on the road to Damascus in Acts of the Apostles, 9, and the Dominical words spoken to St. John in Revelation, 1-3. Thus, rubrications may not exactly correspond to Dominical words and may vary by edition. A feature of the first Klopsch edition is that the Dominical words were also italicized. This rather defeated the specific use of italics in the King James Version to mark words supplied by the translators that are not present in the original texts.

In North America, it was used in colonial French establishments in early New France, French Louisiana (Louisiane), Acadia (Acadie) and Quebec. The related ' () was used in Portugal, Brazil and other parts of the Portuguese Empire until the adoption of the Metric system. Definition =Unit of length= * 1 toise was divided in 6 feet () or 72 inches () or 864 lines () in France until 1812. In 1799 the meter was defined to be exactly 443.296 or toise, with the intention that the meter should equal of the distance from the pole to the equator. This had the effect of making the toise approximately 1949.03631 mm. According to an article written in 1866, during measurement of various standard length artifacts from several countries, the toise was measured as 1,949.03632 mm. Since before 1394, the standard for the toise of Paris was an iron bar embedded in the wall of the Grand Châtelet. But a little before 1667 the pillar in which the standard was embedded bent and distorted the standard. In 1667 officials constructed a new standard, but there were complaints that the new standard was about 0.5% shorter than the previous one. Nevertheless, the new standard was mandated. The old standard was since called \\"toise de l'Ecritoire\\". From 1668 to 1776 the French standard of length was the Toise of Châtelet, which was fixed outside the Grand Châtelet in Paris. In 1735 two geodetic standards were calibrated against the Toise of Châtelet. One of them, the Toise of Peru, was used for the Spanish-French Geodesic Mission. In 1766 the Toise of Peru became the official standard of length in France and was renamed Toise of the Academy (). In 1799, after the remeasurement of the Paris meridian arc () between Dunkirk and Barcelona by Delambre and Mechain, the metre was defined as 3 (feet) and 11.296 (lines) of the Toise of the Academy. * This word is probably the origin for the Scottish word, tawse, meaning a length of leather used for corporal punishment, especially formerly in schools. * 1 toise was exactly 2 metres in France between 1812 and 1 January 1840 (mesures usuelles). 1 toise = 1.8 metres in Switzerland. * 1 = 6 feet () = 1.98 m in Portugal. =Unit of area= * 1 toise was about 3.799 square metres or, of course, a square French toise, as a measure for land and masonry area in France before 10 December 1799. =Unit of volume= * 1 toise = 8.0 cubic metres (20th century Haiti) See also * Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution * Portuguese customary units * Fathom and Klafter, similar units References External links *Sizes.com toise page *Reference from UN United Nations.

The Martin's Hundred site is described in detail in the eponymous book of Ivor Noel Hume first published in 1979. History Martin's Hundred was one of the subsidiary \\"particular\\" plantations of the joint-stock Virginia Company of London. It was owned by a group of investors known as The Society of Martin's Hundred, named for Richard Martin, recorder of the City of London,http://www.northamericanforts.com/East/vajames.html#carter (not to be confused with his near-contemporary Richard Martin who was the father of Jamestown councilor John Martin).Brown 1890 pp. 944-945 Sir John Wolstenholme was among its investors. William Harwood was governor of Martin's Hundred settlement. The administrative center of Martin's Hundred (hundred defined a subdivision of an English county) was Wolstenholme Towne, a fortified settlement of rough cabins. The Society of Martin's Hundred obtained a grant for 80,000 acres from its parent company in 1618. In October of that year, about 250 settlers departed for the plantation, arriving in Virginia about January or March, 1619.Tyler, Lyon Gardiner (1906). The Cradle of the Republic: Jamestown and James River, p. 236. The Hermitage Press, Inc. Like all of the land the English claimed along the river, the plantation's had been part of the domain of the Powhatans, an association of Native American Tidewater tribes formed at the end of the 16th century by the Indian Chief Powhatan. On March 22, 1622, the Powhatans rose to kill as many English as they could surprise in their homes and fields. From near modern Richmond to Newport News, the Powhatans burned and looted dwellings and desecrated corpses. Death counts vary, but about 400 English died. Martin's Hundred, the plantation hardest hit, lost more than 50, perhaps as many as 70. Wolstenholme Towne's death toll was not separated in the death rolls. The Indian Massacre of 1622 nearly accomplished its purpose. The English withdrew from their scattered settlements to the safety of Jamestown. Wolstenholme Towne was resettled a year or more later but abandoned sometime after 1645. Martin's Hundred was represented in the House of Burgesses from 1619 until 1634, when Virginia's counties were formed.  Carter's Grove Plantation  It may be that no trace of the town was apparent by the time planter Robert \\"King\\" Carter bought the land about 1709, and it later became Carter's Grove Plantation, and went through hundreds of years of multiple owners and generations of families. Finally, in 1964, it was acquired by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, which operates the many restored colonial-period capital city attractions in Williamsburg. In 1970 Ivor Hume, Director, Department of Archaeology for The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, started excavating and found 23 grave sites dating from the second quarter of the 17th century.National Geographic Magazine vol 155, No6 , June 1979 In 2007, the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation sold Carter's Grove—with conservation easements designed to protect the house and most of the land – to Halsey Minor. After Minor's company filed for bankruptcy in 2011, the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation took over the needed repairs and then put the house on the market. There were no offers, and in the spring of 2014, the Foundation won a bid at the auction for Carter's Grove. In September 2014, the Foundation sold Carter's Grove to Samuel Mencoff, for $7.5 million. Mencoff is known for preservation projects, and Colin Campbell, who was the president and chief executive of the foundation, stated \\"The property is in the hands of somebody who is going to preserve it, take care of it.\\" Mencoff stated that he and his team would work closely with Colonial Williamsburg to preserve Carter's Grove.  Colonial Williamsburg  What remained of Wolstenholme Towne and its dead lay forgotten beneath the plantation's fields and woodlands until 1976, when archaeologists discovered the site. It and interpretive slave quarters from a later period were partially restored to represent their respective periods during the almost 400-year history of the property, greatly adding to the attraction's features for tourists. However, the main house at Carter's Grove is furnished as it was in 1928, and therefore, while of increasing historic value, does not fit well into the earlier time eras which are the main focus of Colonial Williamsburg presentations. During a period of declining attendance at Colonial Williamsburg attractions, the foundation determined the substantial distance from the main restored area (7 miles) to be an additional contributing factor to the need to reevaluate its role. On January 2, 2003 the site was closed to the public to save operating funds. Closer to the downtown Williamsburg area, Colonial Williamsburg now operates the Great Hopes Plantation interpretive site which can easily be reached by the pedestrian traffic from the restored area, and continues the story of the lives of the slaves who played a vital role in building Colonial Virginia. A future role of Carter's Grove as an attraction had not yet been determined as of October, 2006. Certain support functions of Colonial Williamsburg continue to operate on the Carter's Grove property, however, and the property is secured and maintained, even though not open to the public. In early 2008 archaeologists from Colonial Williamsburg finished surveying and testing various areas across Carter's Grove. Colonial Williamsburg sold the Carter's Grove plantation, Martin's Hundred, and the museum to a private individual whose use of the property remains unknown. Colonial Williamsburg archival staff are still allowed within the museum since some artifacts still reside there and must be preserved. Carter's Grove Country Road, a narrow but paved bucolic link to the Historic Area of Colonial Williamsburg, was damaged during Hurricane Isabel in late 2003, and has been closed to traffic since then. A substantial portion of Martin's Hundred land is now occupied by the community of Grove along U.S. Route 60 east of the Busch Gardens Williamsburg theme park.

Biography A native of Shanghai and a graduate of the University of Virginia (where he received prizes and medals for debate, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa), he taught English at St. John's University, Shanghai for a short time after coming back from the United States, where he became a Freemason, and then went to Beijing to start his political career.Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Christianity Yan Huiqing Bio Retrieved February 22, 2015 In 1906, he became an editor at the Commercial Press, received a D.Litt. from the Peiyang University (now Tianjin University), and was appointed to the Imperial Ministry of Education. He served as Foreign Minister, premier (and acting premier) five times and as acting president during his last premiership in 1926. Wu Peifu handpicked him for the acting presidency to pave the way for Cao Kun's restoration, and he set up a cabinet in anticipation, but he was unable to take office due to Zhang Zuolin's objection. When Yan finally took his post, he immediately resigned and appointed navy minister Du Xigui as his successor. A veteran diplomat, he was China's first ambassador to the Soviet Union, and a delegate to the Washington Naval Conference and the League of Nations; he also served as a diplomat to Germany, Sweden, Denmark, and, finally, the United States, where he denounced the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. During World War II, he translated and compiled Stories of Old China in Hong Kong while under Japanese house-arrest in 1942. He took his first plane trip in 1949 to Moscow in hopes of resolving the Chinese Civil War. He died in May 1950, survived by his widow and six children.

For a non- increasing sequence f(n) of non-negative real numbers, the series displaystylesumlimits_{n=1}^{infty}f(n) converges if and only if the \\"condensed\\" series displaystylesumlimits_{n=0}^{infty} 2^{n}f(2^{n}) converges. Moreover, if they converge, the sum of the condensed series is no more than twice as large as the sum of the original.  Estimate  The Cauchy condensation test follows from the stronger estimate, : sum_{n=1}^{infty} f(n) leq sum_{n=0}^{infty} 2^n f(2^n) leq 2sum_{n=1}^{infty} f(n), which should be understood as an inequality of extended real numbers. The essential thrust of a proof follows, patterned after Oresme's proof of the divergence of harmonic series. To see the first inequality, the terms of the original series are rebracketed into runs whose lengths are powers of two, and then each run is bounded above by replacing each term by the largest term in that run. That term is always the first one, since terms are supposed to be non-increasing. :begin{array}{rcccccccl}displaystyle sumlimits_{n=1}^{infty} f(n) & = &f;(1) & + & f(2) + f(3) & + & f(4) + f(5) + f(6) + f(7) & + & cdots  & = &f;(1) & + & Big(f(2) + f(3)Big) & + & Big(f(4) + f(5) + f(6) + f(7)Big) & + &cdots  & leq &f;(1) & + & Big(f(2) + f(2)Big) & + & Big(f(4) + f(4) + f(4) + f(4)Big) & + &cdots  & = &f;(1) & + & 2 f(2) & + & 4 f(4)& + &cdots = sumlimits_{n=0}^{infty} 2^{n} f(2^{n}) end{array} To see the second inequality, these two series are again rebracketed into runs of power of two length, but \\"offset\\" as shown below, so that the run of textstyle2sum_{n=1}^{infty}f(n) which begins with textstyle f(2^{n}) lines up with the end of the run of textstylesum_{n=0}^{infty}2^{n}f(2^{n}) which ends with textstyle f(2^{n}), so that the former stays always \\"ahead\\" of the latter. :begin{array}{rcl} sumlimits_{n=0}^{infty} 2^{n}f(2^{n}) & = & f(1) + Big(f(2) + f(2)Big) + Big(f(4) + f(4) + f(4) +f(4)Big) + cdots  & = & Big(f(1) + f(2)Big) + Big(f(2) + f(4) + f(4) + f(4)Big) + cdots  & leq & Big(f(1) + f(1)Big) + Big(f(2) + f(2) + f(3) + f(3)Big) + cdots = 2 sumlimits_{n=1}^{infty} f(n) end{array} Visualization of the above argument. Partial sums of the series textstylesum f(n), sum 2^{n}f(2^{n}), and 2 sum f(n) are shown overlaid from left to right.  Integral comparison  The \\"condensation\\" transformation textstyle f(n) rarr 2^{n} f(2^{n}) recalls the integral variable substitution textstyle x rarr e^{x} yielding textstyle f(x),mathrm{d}x rarr e^{x} f(e^{x}),mathrm{d}x. Pursuing this idea, the integral test for convergence gives us, in the case of monotone f, that sumlimits_{n=1}^{infty}f(n) converges if and only if displaystyleint_{1}^{infty}f(x),mathrm{d}x converges. The substitution textstyle xrarr 2^x yields the integral displaystyle log 2,int_{0}^{infty}!2^{x}f(2^{x}),mathrm{d}x and another integral test brings us to the condensed series displaystylesumlimits_{n=0}^{infty} 2^{n}f(2^{n}).  Examples  The test can be useful for series where n appears as in a denominator in f. For the most basic example of this sort, the harmonic series textstylesum_{n=1}^{infty} 1/n is transformed into the series textstylesum 1, which clearly diverges. As a more complex example, take :f(n) := n^{-a} (log n)^{-b} (log log n)^{-c}. Here the series definitely converges for a > 1, and diverges for a < 1. When a = 1, the condensation transformation gives the series :sum n^{-b} (log n)^{-c}. The logarithms 'shift to the left'. So when a = 1, we have convergence for b > 1, divergence for b < 1. When b = 1 the value of c enters. This result readily generalizes: the condensation test, applied repeatedly, can be used to show that for k = 1,2,3,ldots, the generalized Bertrand series > sum_{ngeq N} frac{1}{n cdotlog n cdotloglog ncdots log^{circ > (k-1)} n cdot(log^{circ k} n)^alpha} quadquad (N=lfloor exp^{circ > k} (0)rfloor+1) converges for alpha>1 and diverges for 0<alphaleq 1. Here f^{circ m} denotes the mth compositional iterate of a function f, so that > f^{circ m} (x) := begin{cases} f(f^{circ(m-1)}(x)), & m=1, 2, 3,ldots; >  x, & m = 0. end{cases} The lower limit of the sum, N, was chosen so that all terms of the series are positive. Notably, these series provide examples of infinite sums that converge or diverge arbitrarily slowly. For instance, in the case of k=2 and alpha =1, the partial sum exceeds 10 only after 10^{10^{100}}(a googolplex) terms; yet the series diverges nevertheless.  Schlömilch's Generalization  Lethttp://people.brandeis.edu/~joyner/everytopic/LiflyandCauchyTalk.pdf, p. 7/28 u(n) be a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers such that the ratio of successive differences is bounded: there is a positive real number N, for which: :{Delta u(n) over Delta u(n{-}1)}  = {u(n{+}1)-u(n) over u(n)-u(n{-}1)}  < N   text{for all } n. Then, provided that f(n) meets the same preconditions as in Cauchy's test, the convergence of the series textstylesum_{n=1}^{infty} f(n) is equivalent to the convergence of: :sum_{n=0}^{infty} {Delta u(n)}, f(u(n))  = sum_{n=0}^{infty} Big(u(n{+}1)-u(n)Big) f(u(n)). Taking textstyle u(n) = 2^n so that textstyle Delta u(n) = u(n{+}1)-u(n) = 2^n, the Cauchy condensation test emerges as a special case.  References  * Bonar, Khoury (2006). Real Infinite Series.

The British newspaper The Guardian called Silvers \\"the greatest literary editor there has ever been\\",Banville, John, \\"'The greatest literary editor there has ever been' – John Banville remembers Robert Silvers\\"], The Guardian, March 23, 2017 while Library of America remembered him as \\"an unsurpassed editor who helped define and sustain the literary and intellectual culture of New York and America\\".\\"LOA Remembers Robert Silvers, 1929–2017\\", Library of America, March 28, 2017 The New York Times described him as \\"the voracious polymath, the obsessive perfectionist, the slightly unknowable bachelor-workaholic with the colossal Rolodexes and faintly British diction\\", and, in his obituary, stated that \\"under his editorship [The Review] became one of the premier intellectual journals in the United States, a showcase for extended, thoughtful essays on literature and politics by eminent writers.\\" Author Louis Begley wrote, \\"the ideal editor of my – and I would guess every writer’s – dreams is ... Robert B. Silvers, the editor, brain, and heart of the NYRB. When I write a piece for his magazine, of course I have the immeasurable good luck to be edited by him.

Roger Cohen wrote, after Silvers' death, \\"No eye for imprecise thought was ever more discerning; no edit a sharper yet gentler distillation than his. ... He was a stickler for accuracy. The pencil in his hand went to the heart of the matter.\\"Cohen, Roger. \\"The Importance of Bob Silvers\\", the New York Times, April 28, 2017 In a 2012 profile of Silvers, The New York Times noted: \\"His greatest pleasure ... is simply good writing, which he talks about as others talk about fine wine or good food. Speaking about writers he likes, he sometimes flushes with enthusiasm. 'I admire great writers, people with marvelous and beautiful minds, and always hope they will do something special and revealing for us.'\\" Philip Marino, in The University of Chicago Magazine, commented: \\"Like a chemist pairing ingredients to induce a specific reaction, Silvers has built his career matching the right author and subject, in hopes of generating an exciting and illuminating result. ... 'he puts a writer together with material that even the writer might not have thought was appropriate,' says Daniel Mendelsohn\\". Glen Weldon, writing for NPR, concurred: \\"He encouraged writers to craft each review as a vigorous intellectual argument, and delighted in pairing reviewers with books that challenged their personal or political worldview.\\" Professor Peter Brown wrote: \\"Reviewing for Bob Silvers was like playing in the sprinkling rain of a mighty fountain ... to be doused in the sheer, bubbling delight of Bob’s own unquenchable enthusiasm and alert, discerning curiosity. It widened the heart\\".Brown, Peter. \\"Remembering Bob Silvers\\", The New York Review of Books, April 11, 2017 In The Nation, Harvard professor Stanley Hoffmann observed that, in publishing some of the earliest criticisms of the Vietnam and Iraq wars, Silvers realized what other commentators missed: \\"In both instances, Bob Silvers was, in effect, whether deliberately or not, compensating for the weaknesses of the more established media. ... It was important that a journal which has the authority of the Review in a sense took up the slack and presented viewpoints which were extremely hard to get into the established media.\\"Sherman, Scott. \\"The Rebirth of the NYRB\\", The Nation, May 20, 2004, p. 5. The Nation added, during the Iraq war: > One suspects [the editors of the Review] yearn for the day when they can > return to their normal publishing routine – that gentlemanly pastiche of > philosophy, art, classical music, photography, German and Russian history, > East European politics, literary fiction – unencumbered by political duties > of a confrontational or oppositional nature. That day has not yet arrived. > If and when it does, let it be said that the editors met the challenges of > the post-9/11 era in a way that most other leading American publications did > not, and that The New York Review of Books ... was there when we needed it > most. Silvers said: \\"The great political issues of power and its abuses have always been natural questions for us\\". His obituary in The New York Times commented that \\"Silvers made human rights and the need to check excessive state power his preoccupations, rising at times to the level of a crusade. ... [Silvers said], 'skepticism about government ... is a crucial point of view we have had from the first'.\\" In his 1974 book The American Intellectual Elite, Columbia University sociologist Charles Kadushin interviewed \\"the seventy most prestigious\\" American intellectuals of the late 1960s, including Silvers. The Time magazine review of the book expressed surprise at Silvers' position near the top of the list: \\"Robert Silvers, the editor of the New York Review of Books, the magazine that [Kadushin] indicates is favored by intellectuals who want to reach other intellectuals ... is an able editor but an infrequent writer; it must be assumed that his ranking at the top ... is due to a power not unlike that of the maitre d' of an exclusive restaurant.\\"Sheppard, R. Z. \\"The American Intellectual Elite by Charles Kadushin\\". Time magazine, September 2, 1974, accessed June 3, 2010. Silvers had a reputation for hiring and developing assistants who later became prominent in journalism, academia and literature.

Scott.\\"The Amazing Human Launching Pads\\". \\"Who Runs New York\\", New York magazine, September 26, 2010.

He defines what duty is. You will often find him working until two in the morning in the office, with his little assistants from Harvard around him. He never stops. He's always meeting people, and talking\\".Brown, Andrew. \\"The Writer's Editor\\", The Guardian, January 24, 2004. Claire Messud wrote in 2012 that she was impressed, when submitting reviews for novels to the Review, that Silvers had \\"read the novel at hand, and sometimes with more sensitivity than I had ... he pointed out, delicately, that I'd attributed a quotation to the wrong character, and upon another occasion, that I'd summarized an event in a misleading way ... [but] Bob is unfailingly generous and kind, someone who carefully suggests rather than commands alteration. He is an extraordinary editor in part because he is always respectful, of even the least of his contributors, or the least contribution.\\"Messud, Claire. \\"The Wizard of West Fifty-seventh Street\\", The Paris Review Daily, March 29, 2012. Charles Rosen elaborated: > Bob [has not] sunk his personality into his profession; rather... he has > found a means of transforming his profession into a fundamental way of being > human. Extracting reviews from writers is not, in his case, a métier, or > even a way of life, but a genuine form of self-expression, and he exercises > it with dignity, tact and what sometimes feels like excessive sympathy. He > has made writers feel that producing articles for him is not a business > transaction or even process of communication, but simply a reciprocal act of > friendship. A Financial Times interviewer, Emily Stokes, wrote in 2013 that Silvers viewed editing as \\"an instinct. You must choose writers carefully, having read all of their work, rather than being swayed by 'reputations that are, shall we say, overpromoted', and then anticipate their needs, sending them books and news articles\\" while seeking greater clarity, comprehensiveness and freshness in the writing. Stokes commented that Silvers \\"radiates a genial warmth [but told her that] it is part of the editor's role ... not to be swayed by friendships with authors but to let reviewers express their genuine views.\\" Silvers described some of the diplomatic aspects of the job: \\"The act of reviewing can have a deep emotional effect. People get hurt and upset. You have to be aware of that, but you can't flinch. [You must also reject reviews] sometimes. You say, 'No, I'm terribly sorry, I can't visualise that in the paper. I don't think it's adequate to the subject.'\\" James Atlas wrote of a typical day for Silvers: \\"In the late afternoon, he'd rush out to a lecture at the Council on Foreign Relations, show up at a dinner party, and then head back to the office to deal with the next breaking crisis.\\"Atlas, James. \\"The Ma and Pa of the Intelligentsia\\", New York Magazine, September 25, 2006, accessed April 6, 2017 Timothy Noah wrote: \\"Silvers edited three successive galleys for every piece, sharpening the argument, requesting additional evidence, removing pompous jargon and infelicitous phrases.\\" His New York Times obituary noted: \\"Silvers brought to [the Review] a self-effacing, almost priestly sense of devotion. ... [He was] loath to grant interviews. ... He arrived at the office early and left late, if at all, to the kind of heavyweight cocktail party that was, for him, a happy hunting ground for writers and ideas.\\" Legacy At the time of his death, Silvers left the Review with a circulation of more than 130,000\\"eCirc for Consumer Magazines\\", Audit Bureau of Circulations, accessed June 30, 2017 its book publishing operations, and a reputation as \\"the country’s best and most influential literary journal. ...

He also gave his consent to the Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965-1985) which saw the introduction of dung beetles to Australia as a fly control measure.

Elliott was once distributed through Elektra Entertainment Group, and more recently by Atlantic Records before starting her own label. The Goldmind, Inc. is home to Missy \\"Misdemeanor\\" Elliott, specializing in R&B;/hip-hop/soul music. History In 1997, Missy Elliott released her debut album Supa Dupa Fly, making it The Goldmind, Inc.'s official entrance into the music industry. The album, which was produced by Timbaland, spawned four hit singles, including the Grammy nominated \\"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\\", \\"Sock It 2 Me\\", \\"Beep Me 911\\" and \\"Hit 'Em Wit Da Hee\\". The album featured vocals by Nicole Wray, who was to become Elliott's first artist for The Goldmind, Inc. other than Elliott herself. In 1998, Nicole released her debut album Make It Hot, which was backed by the Timbaland produced smash hit single of the same title and two other minor hits \\"I Can't See\\" and \\"Eyes Better Not Wander\\". That same year Elliott was asked to Executive Produce, along with Timbaland, Sylvia Rhone and Merlin Bobb, the soundtrack to the film Why Do Fools Fall In Love (starring Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox, Lela Rochon and Larenz Tate). The soundtrack featured vocals from Gina Thompson, Destiny's Child, Coko, Busta Rhymes, En Vogue, Lil' Mo, Mel B aka Scary Spice, Mint Condition, The Goldmind's Nicole and the newly signed Mocha and Elliott herself. The soundtrack produced four minor hits \\"Get On The Bus\\" Performed by Destiny's Child and Timbaland, \\"No Fool No More\\" Performed by En Vogue, \\"I Want You Back\\" Performed by Mel B and \\"5 Minutes\\" Performed by Lil' Mo. In 1999, after signing three more artists: Gina Thompson (who appeared on the \\"Why Do Fools Fall In Love\\" Soundtrack), Danja Mowf and Torrey Carter; Elliott released her second album Da Real World which was originally intended to be called \\"She's A Bitch\\". The album was widely embraced by Elliott's fans and fans of the Timbaland sound. The album gave Elliott another three hit singles \\"She's A Bitch\\", the #1 hit single \\"Hot Boyz\\" and \\"All N My Grill\\" which featured vocals from Nicole. Gina Thompson, who was originally signed to Mercury Records under the production of Rodney and Fred Jerkins' Darkchild productions, produced a hit single featuring Elliott \\"Ya Di Ya\\". The song was taken from her second album If You Only Knew, but the album was never officially released. In early 2000, Elliott's '\\"Da Real World\\" was still on the charts. That year saw the debut of Elliott's first male artist Torrey Carter (nicknamed T.C.) with the single \\"Take That\\" taken from his debut album The Life I Live. His album suffered the same fate as Gina Thompson's album. Danja Mowf of the 'Superfriendz' who was originally signed in 1998 after contributing vocals to Aaliyah's \\"Are You That Somebody (Remix)\\" and then performing an impromptu rap over the phone, asked to leave The Goldmind because of broken promises that he'd make an album. So with four artist's leaving the label, Elliott began working on her third album, but needed someone to perform background vocals so she gave one of her old friends from her Swing Mob days a call. That friend was Charlene \\"Tweet\\" Keys, who was at the time depressed and penniless and was on the verge of committing suicide. Tweet credits Elliott as her guardian angel. 2001 saw the release of Miss E…So Addictive. The album was a success and produced four hit singles, the Grammy award-winning \\"Get Ur Freak On,\\" \\"One Minute Man,\\" \\"Take Away,\\" and \\"4 My People\\". In between the process of singles being released, Elliott would sign rock collective Sider to her label however the group would later disperse the fourth quarter of 2001 before any material was released by them. 2001 also saw two tragic events in Elliott's life. The first being her mother, Patricia Elliott, who plays a major role in The Goldmind Inc.'s success, suffering a stroke (she has since fully recovered), and the second being the death of her very good friend Aaliyah, who introduced the hit making duo Elliott and Timbaland to the music industry with her second album One In A Million in 1996. Nicole was also supposed to release her second project Elektric Blue that year, but left the label because of poor promotion from her first single, \\"I'm Lookin'\\" and many pushbacks along with the album. Mocha, who contributed vocals to Elliott's \\"Hit 'Em Wit Da Hee (Remix)\\", Gina Thompson's \\"Why Do Fools Fall In Love\\" and Nicole's debut album, most notably the hit \\"Make It Hot\\", was believed to have left The Goldmind, Inc. around this time because her debut album Bella Mafia was never released and remained in the shadows. In 2002, The Goldmind released Tweet's debut album, Southern Hummingbird, which was backed by the Timbaland produced hit single \\"Oops (Oh My).\\" The album also produced two other singles \\"Call Me\\" and \\"Smoking Cigarettes,\\" and was certified gold. In late 2002, Elliott released her fourth album Under Construction which went double platinum (her first multi-platinum release, as all of Elliott's previous albums stalled at platinum). The album spawned two hit singles, the Grammy award-winning and the 7x MTV VMA nominated song \\"Work It\\" and \\"Gossip Folks\\" and the two radio hit single's \\"Pussycat\\" and \\"Back In The Day.\\" In 2003, Elliott released her platinum selling fifth album This Is Not A Test!. Although it did go platinum, it was not as successful as Elliott's previous efforts. The two single's \\"Pass That Dutch\\" and \\"I'm Really Hot\\" didn't have a huge impact on radio. Elliott also signed Lil' Brianna aka Kandy Girl (who appears in Elliott's \\"Pass That Dutch\\" music video) to The Goldmind. 2004 didn't see any album releases from The Goldmind. This was because Elliott along with The Goldmind, Inc. and Tweet were moved from Elektra Entertainment Group to Atlantic Records. In late 2004, Tweet joined Cee-Lo Green and Teedra Moses on the Seagram's Gin Live Tour in promotion of her new single produced by Kwame & Elliott, \\"Turn Da Lights Off\\". In early 2005, Elliott's new TV program The Road to Stardom with Missy Elliott premiered. The show followed thirteen would-be musical artists hit the road with Elliott in a competition to be signed to The Goldmind, Inc. Jessica Betts eventually won the competition and walked away with $100,000 and a chance to cut a single for The Goldmind Inc. She recorded her debut album, Jessie Pearl, and was at first to include various collaborations from the likes of Elliott, Timbaland, Faith Evans and labelmate, Tweet; the end result was two Elliott and Souldiggaz contributions and a delayed release in Japan. Around this time, Elliott crafted a new trio named Wicked (whom would be renamed \\"So Def\\") and hinted to Billboard Magazine of what type of genre the group would be. March 2005 saw the release of Tweet's overdue second album, It's Me Again, but because of poor promotion the album didn't sell as well as originally intended and fell off the charts within months of its release. 2005 also saw the release of Elliott's sixth album The Cookbook. This album saw her departure from her main producing partner, Timbaland, who contributed only two tracks. Elliott says the reason for this was to give themselves a break as she felt they were experiencing \\"writer's block.\\" The album produced one hit single, the Grammy Nominated and MTV VMA winning \\"Lose Control\\" and another single \\"Teary Eyed\\". \\"We Run This\\" was released as an international lead single for Elliott's first compilation, Respect M.E. and the final single from The Cookbook. In 2006, rumors circulated that Rozonda \\"Chilli\\" Thomas of TLC was negotiating with Missy to sign with The Goldmind. Missy has been confirmed to be an executive producer on Chilli's album. Around this time, R&B; trio, So Def (formerly Wicked), were officially signed to the label with an accompanying MySpace page, licensed under Atlantic/Goldmind; the group released \\"Hell Naw\\" as a buzz single for their album later that year. Around this time, Lil' Brianna (a.k.a. Kandy Girl), left the label due to creative differences. In 2007, R&B; trio, So Def, left the label due to undisclosed reasons, thus their album was left unfinished. In 2008, Elliott was featured on two tracks to the soundtrack of Step Up 2: The Streets. In December of that same year, a debut album by Road to Stardom winner, Jessica Betts, was shelved in the U.S. and was released exclusively to Japan. 2010 saw the signing of rapper, Sharaya Howell, who was introduced by Elliott in the 2009 Crash Mansion Concert; her Soul Diggaz-produced single, \\"Green Light\\" leaked via internet in late January 2010. June 2010 saw the release of another single by Sharaya known as, \\"What Is Love?\\"; the single has been widely speculated to be released internationally after numerous performances of the song occurred during Missy Elliott's 2010 international summer tour. 2012 marked the year of Elliott's return to the rap game. In September 2012, Elliott released two new songs (\\"9th Inning\\" and \\"Triple Threat\\") exclusively to iTunes. Both songs were rumored to be featured on Elliott's long-awaited next album, which was at one point titled Block Party. From 2013 to 2014, scant releases followed from signee Sharaya, including the debut single \\"Banji\\" and the \\"Take Away\\"-sampled \\"Takin' It No More\\". 2015 would see the release of new solo music performed by Elliott. This period would also be the timing of production crew Soul Diggaz disbandment from the Goldmind. On November 12, 2015, after years of delays and previous failed attempts of materializing a proper single, Missy Elliott readied the offering \\"WTF (Where They From),\\" featuring vocal and production assistance from recurring collaborator Pharrell Williams. 2016 saw the release another Elliott single \\"Pep Rally\\" alongside the departure of previous understudy Sharaya J, who left to start her own production company and release more music frequently without label restriction. The following year, Elliott would release another single \\"I'm Better\\". By 2019, Elliott would compose an EP as a prelude to an official seventh studio album; the critically acclaimed Iconology.

Walther Bensemann (13 January 1873 – 12 November 1934) was a German pioneer of football and founder of the country's major sports publication, Kicker. Bensemann was born in Berlin, Brandenburg, as the son of a Jewish banker. During his time at private school in Montreux, Switzerland, he learned about the new sport of football. When he moved to Karlsruhe in order to complete his school-leavers' exam, he began to spread the sport around the German Empire. There, in September 1889, he founded the International Football Club, the first football club in southern Germany, and two years later he was instrumental in the founding of Karlsruher FV, one of the first champion clubs in Germany. He was also involved in the creation of Frankfurter Kickers, who would later become Eintracht Frankfurt. In 1900 he belonged to the founding-fathers of the German Football Association, the German Football Association. Bensemann thought of football as a means of international understanding, so he started to organize international matches such as the ones between selections of Lausanne and southern Germany in 1893. Consequently, this also led to the five historical matches between selections from Germany England and between 1899 and 1901, which albeit not having any official status, are considered the historically first international matches of any German national side. In 1920, Bensemann founded Kicker, which evolved soon into Germany's leading football magazine, a status which it retains until today. In 1933, the Nazi Machtergreifung in Germany compelled Benseman to move to Montreux where he died soon, relatively unnoticed and without means.  Walther Bensemann Prize  The German academy for football culture gives the Walther Bensemann prize every year toWalther Bensemann Preis a person for extraordinary dedication with courage and a pioneering spirit, for social responsibility, fairplay, intercultural understanding in and around football. It was given amongst others to Franz Beckenbauer, Bobby Charlton, Marcello Lippi, Alex Ferguson.

A sequel Fast Getaway II was released in 1994. Plot Sixteen-year-old Nelson Potter is part of a bank robbing team with his father Sam — Nelson scouts targets for the group and acts as a hostage in their endeavors. Their accomplices include Tony and Lilly, a skilled martial artist and Sam’s current love interest. Wanting Sam all to herself, Lilly tries to persuade him to cut Nelson from the group, but Sam declines. When she overhears him insulting her afterwards, Lilly refuses to give Nelson his share of the money from their latest heist and viciously attacks Sam, leading Nelson to subdue her at gunpoint. With the partnership dissolved, Tony and Lilly leave the group. After stealing a new getaway car, Sam and Nelson continue on their own. Sam’s goal is to eventually steal enough money to pay for Nelson’s college education, although Nelson sees nothing wrong with robbing banks for a living. While robbing yet another bank in Utah, Tony and Lilly tip off the police from their hotel room across the street, and Sam is arrested. With Nelson deemed a runaway, Lilly and Tony rush to claim him at the police station, hoping to utilize him in their own robberies. However, a woman named Lorraine picks up Nelson first after learning about the attempted heist on television. She deftly evades Tony and Lilly in a high-speed chase and takes Nelson back to her home, where Nelson pleads for her help in breaking his father out of jail. With Lorraine at the wheel, Nelson successfully retrieves Sam, who reveals that Lorraine is Nelson’s biological mother, having lied to his son about her death for years so that Nelson would stay with him after their separation. Feeling betrayed, Nelson tells his father he can no longer trust him. The next evening, Tony and Lilly track down Lorraine at her workplace and follow her back to her home, where they kidnap Nelson. Using Nelson’s maps, atlas, and other resources, Sam and Lorraine deduce that his next target is not a bank, but instead the Salt Lake City Amphitheater. They race to confront Tony and Lilly, who have already robbed the venue by using Nelson as a hostage in a vest loaded with dynamite. After forcing Nelson into the back of their pickup truck at gunpoint, Tony and Lilly attempt to get away with Sam and Lorraine in hot pursuit. In desperation, Lilly attacks Nelson and throws him from the truck, leaving him dragging precariously behind the vehicle on a strip of chain link fence. With Lilly distracted by a police helicopter, Sam climbs aboard the truck and gets the upper hand against Lilly, knocking her onto the highway. He then forces Tony off the road, giving Nelson enough time to remove the bomb and plant it in the truck. While Sam reaches for the detonator, Tony attempts to run him over, but Lorraine rams into the truck with her car at the last second, sending it tumbling down a cliff where it explodes. As the three drive away to seek medical attention for Nelson, Tony is shown dangling helplessly from the face of the cliff, having survived the ordeal. Sometime later, Sam, Nelson, and Lorraine embark on a road trip to Canada, where they jokingly make plans for their next bank robbery.

Richmond career  Funcke was recruited to the Richmond Tigers in the 1995 AFL Draft. Touted as a half-back player, he fulfilled that role for the Tigers, though not too impressively. At the end of the 1999 season Richmond delisted the then 21-year-old Funcke. It seemed that would be the end of his AFL career, but it was not.  Melbourne career  In 2000 Funcke played in the Victorian Football League (VFL) with the North Ballarat Roosters and surprisingly was picked up by the Melbourne Football Club and given a lifeline at AFL level. By that time, Funcke was a tagger/run-with player and he was utilised accordingly in his debut season with Melbourne in 2001. After playing the first game in Round 1, 2001, he did not return to the side until Round 19, but performed solidly when he returned, and was impressive in Melbourne's Round 20 win over Sydney. He was retained in the side for the rest of the season, but in 2002 he had a poor year and was finally delisted.  Post-AFL career  Funcke carved out a career with the Port Adelaide Magpies in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) once his AFL career ended, and he became a valuable player for the club. Personal issues forced him home during the 2005 season. In 2006, Funcke has signed on as a player-coach with Donald Football Club in the North Central Football League.

In contrast to the Darlington arrangement, the complementary feedback pair has one NPN and one PNP transistor, and so it is sometimes also called the \\"complementary Darlington\\". The configuration is named for its early popularizer, George C. Sziklai. Characteristics The current gain of the pair is similar to that of a Darlington pair and is the product of the current gains of the two transistors. The figure at the right illustrates an NPN-PNP pair that acts like a single NPN transistor overall. By replacing Q1 with a PNP transistor and Q2 with an NPN transistor the pair will act like a PNP transistor overall. Applications In a typical application the complementary feedback pair acts somewhat like a single transistor with the same type (e.g. NPN) as Q1 and with a very high current gain (β). The emitter of Q2 functions as a collector. Hence the emitter of Q2 is labeled \\"C\\" in the figure to the right. Likewise, in a typical application the collector of Q2 (also connected to the emitter of Q1) functions as an emitter and is thus labeled \\"E.\\" As with a Darlington pair, a resistor (e.g., 100Ω-1kΩ) can be connected between Q2's emitter and base to improve its turn-off time (i.e., its performance for high frequency signals). Advantages One advantage over the Darlington pair is that the base turn-on voltage is only about 0.6V or half of the Darlington's 1.2V nominal turn-on voltage. Like the Darlington, it can saturate only to 0.6V, which is a drawback for high-power stages.  Complementary feedback-based output stages  Complementary feedback pairs are often used in the output stages of power amplifiers due to their advantages both in linearity and bandwidth when compared with more common Darlington emitter follower output stages. They are especially advantageous in amplifiers where the intended load does not require the use of parallel devices. Complementary feedback pairs can also have the benefit of superior thermal stability under the right conditions. In contrast to the traditional Darlington configuration, quiescent current is much more stable with respect to changes in the temperature of the higher power output transistors vs the lower power drivers. This means that a Sziklai output stage in a class AB amplifier requires only that the bias servo transistor or diodes be thermally matched to the lower power driver transistors; they need not (and should not) be placed on the main heatsink. This potentially simplifies the design and implementation of a stable class AB amplifier, reducing the need for emitter resistors, significantly reducing the number of components which must be in thermal contact with the heatsink and reducing the likelihood of thermal runaway. Optimal quiescent current in an amplifier using complementary feedback pairs also tends to be much lower than in Darlington-based output stages, on the order of 10mA vs. 100mA or more for some emitter follower output stages. This means that idle power consumption is on the order of a few watts versus tens of watts for the same performance in many cases. This is a very compelling reason to use the Sziklai pair in cases where output power is moderate (25-100W), fidelity is critical and relatively low idle power consumption is desired. = Quasi-complementary output stages = Historically, designers frequently used the \\"quasi-complementary\\" configuration, which uses a Darlington push pair (i.e., two NPN transistors) and a complementary feedback pull pair (i.e., one PNP and one NPN transistor). This configuration, which uses three NPN transistors and one PNP transistor, is advantageous because while the first transistors and the most common small signal transistors for decades were PNP germanium devices, silicon PNP power transistors were slower to develop, and have historically been more expensive, than their NPN counterparts. Alternately, if a germanium PNP device were used, it would have significantly different characteristics. In the quasi- complementary topology, the performance of the lower pull pair, which used a single NPN transistor, more closely matched the performance of the upper push pair, which consists of two NPN transistors and an identical power device. While for decades the quasi-complementary output stage made sense, since PNP and NPN power transistors became roughly equally available and had more closely matched performance characteristics, modern audio power amplifiers often use equivalent topologies for both pairs; either both Darlington emitter follower or both Sziklai pair.

Garfield National Historic Site is a United States National Historic Site located in Mentor, Ohio. The site preserves the Lawnfield estate and surrounding property of James Abram Garfield, the 20th President of the United States, and includes the first presidential library established in the United States. History James A. Garfield acquired the home in 1876 to accommodate his large family. During the 1880 presidential election, Garfield conducted what became the first successful front porch campaign from the home, which became known as \\"Lawnfield\\" by the reporters covering his campaign. That same year, Garfield had 11 rooms added to the building to accommodate his large family.Garfield Home Undergone Restoration , Moreland Hills Historical Society. Garfield was shot four months into his term and died on September 19, 1881. Four years after his assassination, his widow Lucretia Garfield and her family added the Memorial Library wing, setting the precedent for presidential libraries. Garfield purchased the Mentor residence for several reasons. Until this time, he had been a resident of Hiram and represented the 19th Ohio congressional district. The Democratic Ohio Legislature had redistricted and removed the Republican Party counties of Ashtabula, Lake, Geauga, and Trumbull from the district, leaving only the Democratic Party counties of Ashland, Stark and Wayne.Lawnfield Historic Structures Report, James A Garfield National Historic Site; National Park Service; January 1990 Garfield also wanted a place where his sons could learn about farming, as well as a permanent residence where he could spend his summers while Congress was on recess. Lucretia Garfield lived in the house at least part of every year until her death in 1918. Her brother, Joseph Rudolph, lived there until he died in 1934. In 1936, Garfield's children donated the house and its contents to the Western Reserve Historical Society for use as a museum. On December 28, 1980, the United States Congress declared the Garfield home a National Historic Site.Lawnfield, James A. Garfield National Historic Site , Western Reserve Historical Society.

The club was founded in 1890 als BTuFC Alemannia 1890. In 1994 the club experienced an influx of members of SC Wacker 04 Berlin, which had folded, and took the name BFC Alemannia 90 Wacker. However, in 2013 they returned to their original name.Alemannia-Wacker hat es nie gegeben Fussball-Woche.de, published: 18 March 2013, accessed: 28 November 2015  History  Berliner Thor- und Fussball Club Alemannia was founded early in 1890 as SV Jugendlust 1890 Berlin before becoming BTuFC in February. They were also briefly partnered with Tambour-Verein Wanderlust that year. Sometime in the 1890s they adopted the name BFC Alemannia 90 Berlin. Initially the club played cricket which, alongside football and rugby, were English sports becoming popular in continental Europe at the time. A football department quickly developed, and the team played in Berlin's earliest leagues, becoming one of the founding clubs of the DFB (German Football Association) in Leipzig in 1900. From 1903 to 1911 the team played in the Märkischer Fußball-Bund where they captured league titles in 1905 and 1907. Through the 1920s, Alemannia played in the first division Oberliga Berlin-Brandenburg, winning the division in 1924 by defeating Norden-Nordwest Berlin, and then losing their defence of their title to Hertha BSC the following year. The club advanced to the German championship rounds in both seasons, only to be put out in the early going. By 1929 their performance had slipped, and they were relegated. In 1933, Allemannia became Alemannia. They did not qualify to play in the new first division Gauligen formed that year in the re-organization of German football under the Third Reich and remained out of top-flight competition for the duration of World War II. After the war, occupying Allied authorities ordered most organizations in the country disbanded, including sports and football clubs. The formation of new clubs was permitted late in 1945, and the membership of Alemannia was re- organized as SG Prenzlauer Berg West. This team appeared in the new Oberliga Berlin (I) and by 1947–48 was once again playing as Alemannia 90 Berlin. They played out their turn in the first division as a mid-table side until relegated in 1956, followed by a single season re-appearance that ended in a last-place finish in 1957–58. The club slipped briefly to fourth division play before playing in the Regionalliga Berlin (II) and Amateurliga Berlin (III) from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s. By the time of the demise of Wacker in 1994, Alemannia had fallen to the fifth tier Landesliga Berlin. Wacker's financial collapse saw many of the club's members join Alemannia, leading to the renaming to BFC Alemannia 90 Wacker. The newly combined side played in the Landesliga Berlin (V) and enjoyed a brief surge of success, moving from the lower half of the table to two consecutive second-place finishes. However, Alemannia Wacker has since faded but continued to play in the Verbandsliga Berlin as a mid-table side until its relegation in 2008. In 2013 they took back their original name. They played in the Bezirksliga Berlin (VIII) after their relegation from Landesliga Berlin (VII) in 2014 but were relegated from this level, too in 2015, now to the Kreisliga A.  Honours  The club's honours: * Brandenburg football championship (I) ** Champions: 1924 ** Runners-up: 1925 * Amateur-Oberliga Berlin ** Champions: 1957, 1970 * Berliner Landespokal ** Runners-up: 1949, 2005  Thorball  * Thorball or Torball was a German word in use in the 1890s and early 1900s for the sport of cricket. Several early clubs playing the new \\"English\\" games of football, rugby, and cricket incorporated it into their name. The term never caught on and did not enter into common usage, soon being abandoned by sports clubs. Today torball may refer to a form of football played by the blind or vision-impaired.

Released initially in May 1982, the album contains the pop hit \\"She Blinded Me with Science\\" in its later resequencings. The album's overall theme is the era of early radio. Compositions The music of \\"Europa and the Pirate Twins\\" is a deliberate merging of past and present, combining modern synthesizers with blues harmonica playing and electronic percussion with handclaps. The central character in \\"Radio Silence\\" is a personification of Radio Caroline, a 1960s British pirate radio station. Release history Preceding the album, Dolby allowed a demo of \\"Airwaves\\" to be included on a collection titled From Brussels with Love, published in December 1980 by Belgian label Les Disques Du Crépuscule. In response to friends urging him to put out a single, Dolby released his first 45 rpm 7-inch single – \\"Urges\\" backed by \\"Leipzig\\" – on 18 February 1981. The single was co-produced by Andy Partridge of XTC through Armageddon Records. Partridge also played percussion. Sounds magazine reviewed \\"Urges\\" positively, calling Dolby a \\"new romantic... A Futurist Rundgren perhaps?\\" None of these songs were announced as singles for an upcoming album, but later they appeared on certain formats of Golden Age of Wireless. While working on Golden Age of Wireless, Dolby was involved in side projects. He wrote the song \\"New Toy\\" for Lene Lovich, about his new Fairlight CMI synthesizer. In May 1981, Dolby produced the single \\"Dream Soldiers\\" by the Fallout Club, a band in which Dolby sang and played synthesizers. The Fallout Club was signed to Happy Birthday Records.Gimarc 1997, p. 161 In August, Dolby released the single \\"The Jungle Line\\" under the artist name Low Noise, his own project on Happy Birthday Records. He was inspired to write \\"The Jungle Line\\" after hearing Joni Mitchell's song of the same name on her 1975 album The Hissing of Summer Lawns.Gimarc 1997, p. 190 The Fallout Club disbanded toward the end of 1981. Dolby played live shows in London, including dates at the Heaven and the Albany Empire in April 1982.Gimarc 1997, p. 265 Three more of Dolby's songs appeared in late '81 and early '82. \\"Europa and the Pirate Twins\\" came out on 15 September 1981 as another independent Dolby single,Gimarc 1997, p. 197 \\"Airwaves\\" hit on 30 January 1982, and \\"Radio Silence\\" was released on 25 March accompanied by the announcement of the upcoming album.Gimarc 1997, p. 356 Finally, The Golden Age of Wireless album was released on 13 May 1982. EMI Records manufactured and distributed these singles and the album, supporting Dolby's own Venice in Peril (VIP) label. VIP was named for the steady process of Venice sinking under water. Dolby said he would donate part of the label profits to stop the flooding of Venice. Golden Age of Wireless was released five times, in different formats and layouts. All five releases appeared on vinyl, but only the third and fifth versions appeared on CD, with each changing the order of the songs, replacing the album mixes with extended or single mixes and even adding and removing entire songs. In the case of \\"Radio Silence\\", a completely different recording with prominent guitars was the version used on the early US incarnations. The first US version, issued by Capitol-EMI's Harvest imprint, excised the instrumental \\"The Wreck of the Fairchild\\" and added the two sides of Dolby's first single, \\"Leipzig\\" and \\"Urges\\". Additionally, Capitol swapped the original synthpop version of \\"Radio Silence\\" for a more rock-oriented version that had previously only been available as a single B-side in the UK. Capitol also opted for the single edit of \\"Airwaves\\" and abandoned the original UK \\"comic book\\" cover in favour of a shot of Dolby on a stage during the production of Bertholt Brecht's \\"Galileo\\". This image had previously been used as the cover of the \\"Europa and the Pirate Twins\\" single in the UK. When Dolby released the single \\"She Blinded Me with Science\\" backed by \\"One of our Submarines\\" on 23 October 1982 – complete with a music video for the A-side – Capitol removed \\"Urges\\" and \\"Leipzig\\", added the extended version of \\"Science\\" (also known as the \\"U.S. Mix\\") and \\"Submarines\\", and changed the album's cover art back to its original \\"comic book\\" design. Capitol also swapped the full-length version of \\"Windpower\\" for the single version (with an edited intro and outro). The Golden Age of Wireless sold very well in the US and \\"She Blinded Me with Science\\" became a major hit, with constant radio and MTV airplay. In 1983, Dolby's UK record label, Venice in Peril, followed suit and reissued the album with a similar track listing to the second US version. They opted for the short single version of \\"Science\\" but retained the full-length versions of \\"Airwaves\\" and \\"Windpower\\" and the original synthesizer-driven version of \\"Radio Silence\\", just as all three had appeared on the first UK edition. This is the edition that is widely available on CD to this day, on both sides of the Atlantic. A remastered \\"Collector's Edition\\" of The Golden Age of Wireless was released on 13 July 2009, complete with bonus tracks, personal sleeve notes and a DVD of the Live Wireless music video.

Other factors may affect the manufacturability such as the type of raw material, the form of the raw material, dimensional tolerances, and secondary processing such as finishing. Depending on various types of manufacturing processes there are set guidelines for DFM practices. These DFM guidelines help to precisely define various tolerances, rules and common manufacturing checks related to DFM. While DFM is applicable to the design process, a similar concept called DFSS (Design for Six Sigma) is also practiced in many organizations. For printed circuit boards (PCB) In the PCB design process, DFM leads to a set of design guidelines that attempt to ensure manufacturability. By doing so, probable production problems may be addressed during the design stage. Ideally, DFM guidelines take into account the processes and capabilities of the manufacturing industry. Therefore, DFM is constantly evolving. As manufacturing companies evolve and automate more and more stages of the processes, these processes tend to become cheaper. DFM is usually used to reduce these costs. For example, if a process may be done automatically by machines (i.e. SMT component placement and soldering), such process is likely to be cheaper than doing so by hand. For integrated circuits (IC) Achieving high-yielding designs, in the state of the art VLSI technology has become an extremely challenging task due to the miniaturization as well as the complexity of leading-edge products. Here, the DFM methodology includes a set of techniques to modify the design of integrated circuits (IC) in order to make them more manufacturable, i.e., to improve their functional yield, parametric yield, or their reliability. =Background= Traditionally, in the pre-nanometer era, DFM consisted of a set of different methodologies trying to enforce some soft (recommended) design rules regarding the shapes and polygons of the physical layout of an integrated circuit. These DFM methodologies worked primarily at the full chip level. Additionally, worst-case simulations at different levels of abstraction were applied to minimize the impact of process variations on performance and other types of parametric yield loss. All these different types of worst-case simulations were essentially based on a base set of worst-case (or corner) SPICE device parameter files that were intended to represent the variability of transistor performance over the full range of variation in a fabrication process. = Taxonomy of yield loss mechanisms = The most important yield loss models (YLMs) for VLSI ICs can be classified into several categories based on their nature. *Functional yield loss is still the dominant factor and is caused by mechanisms such as misprocessing (e.g., equipment-related problems), systematic effects such as printability or planarization problems, and purely random defects. *High- performance products may exhibit parametric design marginalities caused by either process fluctuations or environmental factors (such as supply voltage or temperature). *The test-related yield losses, which are caused by incorrect testing, can also play a significant role. =Techniques= After understanding the causes of yield loss, the next step is to make the design as resistant as possible. Techniques used for this include: *Substituting higher yield cells where permitted by timing, power, and routability. *Changing the spacing and width of the interconnect wires, where possible *Optimizing the amount of redundancy in internal memories. *Substituting fault tolerant (redundant) vias in a design where possible All of these require a detailed understanding of yield loss mechanisms, since these changes trade off against one another. For example, introducing redundant vias will reduce the chance of via problems, but increase the chance of unwanted shorts. Whether this is good idea, therefore, depends on the details of the yield loss models and the characteristics of the particular design. For CNC machining =Objective= The objective is to design for lower cost. The cost is driven by time, so the design must minimize the time required to not just machine (remove the material), but also the set-up time of the CNC machine, NC programming, fixturing and many other activities that are dependent on the complexity and size of the part. =Set-Up Time of Operations (Flip of the Part)= Unless a 4th- &/or 5th-Axis is used, a CNC can only approach the part from a single direction. One side must be machined at a time (called an operation or Op). Then the part must be flipped from side to side to machine all of the features. The geometry of the features dictates whether the part must be flipped over or not. The more Ops (flip of the part), the more expensive the part because it incurs substantial \\"Set-up\\" and \\"Load/Unload\\" time. Each operation (flip of the part) has set-up time, machine time, time to load/unload tools, time to load/unload parts, and time to create the NC program for each operation. If a part has only 1 operation, then parts only have to be loaded/unloaded once. If it has 5 operations, then load/unload time is significant. The low hanging fruit is minimizing the number of operations (flip of the part) to create significant savings. For example, it may take only 2 minutes to machine the face of a small part, but it will take an hour to set the machine up to do it. Or, if there are 5 operations at 1.5 hours each, but only 30 minutes total machine time, then 7.5 hours is charged for just 30 minutes of machining. Lastly, the volume (number of parts to machine) plays a critical role in amortizing the set-up time, programming time and other activities into the cost of the part. In the example above, the part in quantities of 10 could cost 7–10X the cost in quantities of 100. Typically, the law of diminishing returns presents itself at volumes of 100–300 because set-up times, custom tooling and fixturing can be amortized into the noise. = Material type = The most easily machined types of metals include aluminum, brass, and softer metals. As materials get harder, denser and stronger, such as steel, stainless steel, titanium, and exotic alloys, they become much harder to machine and take much longer, thus being less manufacturable. Most types of plastic are easy to machine, although additions of fiberglass or carbon fiber can reduce the machinability. Plastics that are particularly soft and gummy may have machinability problems of their own. = Material form = Metals come in all forms. In the case of aluminum as an example, bar stock and plate are the two most common forms from which machined parts are made. The size and shape of the component may determine which form of material must be used. It is common for engineering drawings to specify one form over the other. Bar stock is generally close to 1/2 of the cost of plate on a per pound basis. So although the material form isn't directly related to the geometry of the component, cost can be removed at the design stage by specifying the least expensive form of the material. =Tolerances = A significant contributing factor to the cost of a machined component is the geometric tolerance to which the features must be made. The tighter the tolerance required, the more expensive the component will be to machine. When designing, specify the loosest tolerance that will serve the function of the component. Tolerances must be specified on a feature by feature basis. There are creative ways to engineer components with lower tolerances that still perform as well as ones with higher tolerances. =Design and shape = As machining is a subtractive process, the time to remove the material is a major factor in determining the machining cost. The volume and shape of the material to be removed as well as how fast the tools can be fed will determine the machining time. When using milling cutters, the strength and stiffness of the tool which is determined in part by the length to diameter ratio of the tool will play the largest role in determining that speed. The shorter the tool is relative to its diameter the faster it can be fed through the material. A ratio of 3:1 (L:D) or under is optimum. If that ratio cannot be achieved, a solution like this depicted here can be used. For holes, the length to diameter ratio of the tools are less critical, but should still be kept under 10:1. There are many other types of features which are more or less expensive to machine. Generally chamfers cost less to machine than radii on outer horizontal edges. 3D interpolation is used to create radii on edges that are not on the same plane which incur 10X the cost. Undercuts are more expensive to machine. Features that require smaller tools, regardless of L:D ratio, are more expensive. Design for Inspection The concept of Design for Inspection (DFI) should complement and work in collaboration with Design for Manufacturability (DFM) and Design for Assembly (DFA) to reduce product manufacturing cost and increase manufacturing practicality. There are instances when this method could cause calendar delays since it consumes many hours of additional work such as the case of the need to prepare for design review presentations and documents. To address this, it is proposed that instead of periodic inspections, organizations could adopt the framework of empowerment, particularly at the stage of product development, wherein the senior management empowers the project leader to evaluate manufacturing processes and outcomes against expectations on product performance, cost, quality and development time. Experts, however, cite the necessity for the DFI because it is crucial in performance and quality control, determining key factors such as product reliability, safety, and life cycles. For an aerospace components company, where inspection is mandatory, there is the requirement for the suitability of the manufacturing process for inspection. Here, a mechanism is adopted such as an inspectability index, which evaluates design proposals. Another example of DFI is the concept of cumulative count of conforming chart (CCC chart), which is applied in inspection and maintenance planning for systems where different types of inspection and maintenance are available. Design for additive manufacturing Additive manufacturing broadens the ability of a designer to optimize the design of a product or part (to save materials for example). Designs tailored for additive manufacturing are sometimes very different from designs tailored for machining or forming manufacturing operations. In addition, due to some size constraints of additive manufacturing machines, sometimes the related bigger designs are split into smaller sections with self-assembly features or fasteners locators. A common characteristic of additive manufacturing methods, such as fused deposition modelling, is the need for temporary support structures for overhanging part features. Post-processing removal of these temporary support structures increases the overall cost of fabrication. Parts can be designed for additive manufacturing by eliminating or reducing the need for temporary support structures. This can be done by limiting the angle of overhanging structures to less than the limit of the given additive manufacturing machine, material, and process (for example, less than 70 degrees from vertical).

(1983, January). Mike Mentzer’s Video Venture . Muscle Mag International. Issue Number 33, page 25. (Retrieved August 21, 2008.)Tonguette, Peter. Bob Rafelson and His Odd American Places. The Film Journal. Issue 11. (Retrieved December 1, 2005.) The story centers on a young Birmingham scion, played by Jeff Bridges, who gets involved in a shady real- estate deal. In order to close the deal, he needs to buy a gym building to complete a multi-parcel lot. When he visits the gym, however, he finds himself romantically interested in the receptionist (Sally Field) and drawn to the carefree lifestyle of the Austrian body builder Joe Santo (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who is training there for the Mr. Universe competition. Schwarzenegger won a Golden Globe for \\"Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture\\" for his portrayal of Joe Santo, though, it was not his debut role, as he had played Hercules (as \\"Arnold Strong\\") in the 1969 film Hercules in New York, a gangster's henchman in Robert Altman's 1973 film The Long Goodbye and a masseur in the 1974 television film Happy Anniversary and Goodbye. Plot Craig Blake (Jeff Bridges) is a young Southern man born of a wealthy family, but left lonely and idle after his parents died in a plane crash. He is content to spend his time fishing, hunting and puttering around his large family mansion in Birmingham, Alabama, inhabited only by himself and a butler (Scatman Crothers). Blake's \\"job\\" is a sinecure working at a shady investment firm run by a slick con artist named Jabo (Joe Spinell) and he does very little actual work. But since he has to have his name \\"on paper\\" somehow as an employee, he is asked to personally transact the purchasing of a small gym that the real estate firm is buying in order to clear space for an office high-rise. He initially approaches the gym representing himself as a businessman looking to buy it, and acts relatively impersonal with its owner Thor Erikson (R.G. Armstrong) and employees Franklin (Robert Englund) and Newton (Roger E. Mosley), although he is strangely fascinated with the world he discovers there. Blake's primary social life is normally centered around the upscale country club and its crowd, including the WASP-y Lester (Ed Begley, Jr.) and the roguish rake Halsey (John David Carson). Blake spends his time at this club with his friends playing tennis and shooting poker dice, and flirting with the women of all ages - one of whom asks Blake to find an \\"authentic\\" musical guest for an upcoming party at the club. As Blake moves forward with his business deal, he falls in love with the gym after visiting it several times - he is immediately taken by the pretty receptionist Mary Tate Farnsworth (Sally Field) and the free-spirited, friendly bodybuilder Joe Santo (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who aspires to win the Mr. Universe title. He cannot bring himself to sell out his newfound friends at the gym for the sake of his job, and so he evades the inquiries of his friend and coworker Hal Foss (Richard Gilliland) as to his progress in the purchasing deal. All the while, he grows closer to Mary Tate and Santo - who initially appear to be a couple. However, Mary Tate latches onto Craig romantically - and Santo gives Craig his blessing for this unorthodox relationship, claiming that he needs to keep himself challenged both in the gym and in his romantic life in order to succeed. Mary Tate and Craig begin a passionate and exciting relationship, but trouble erupts when he tries to integrate Mary Tate into his country-club scene. This tension comes to a head at a party at the club, which features Joe Santo as a musical guest, performing bluegrass songs on the violin with a small country group. Craig, with Mary Tate as his guest (dressed inappropriately in a revealing pink dress), is enthusiastic about Joe Santo's upcoming musical performance for the night. However, Craig's friends, particularly Halsey, mock Santo as a \\"freak\\" and an outcast. When Halsey suggests that Santo disrobe and show the crowd his \\"tits,\\" Craig throws a glass of scotch in his face and tells Halsey that Santo could \\"crush him like an eggshell.\\" A fight nearly breaks out between the two, but is broken up. Meanwhile, a bitter Halsey and his friend Packman formulate a plan to embarrass Santo. When Santo's musical act is finally put on stage, the crowd seems enthusiastic about the music, though the hostess of the party dismisses it as a \\"racket.\\" However, Halsey and Packman drunkenly bellow at Santo and heckle the band. Santo notices it, but stoically continues playing. However, when Halsey screams \\"let's hear it for Muscle Beach symphony orchestra!\\" Santo is unable to continue playing, puts down his violin and leaves the party. Meanwhile, a frustrated Craig tries to convince Mary Tate to see him for who he really is, and not for his snobbish friends and ritzy surroundings. Jabo, owner of the shady real estate firm, attempts to bribe Thor, when he realizes that Blake will not purchase the building as he was supposed to. He plies Eriksen and his assistant Newton with drugs, booze and hookers, and on the day of the contest, they are busy with acts of debauchery as Santo is readying to take the stage - hoping to beat his rival Dougie Stewart (Ken Waller). While Thor is drunk and distracted with the prostitutes, Newton secretly stashes the prize money inside his handbag, and then leaves the gym with the prostitutes when they are finished - stealing the money and fleeing. Meanwhile, Joe Santo and Dougie Stewart pose together on stage, to the theme from the film Exodus and the enthusiastic applause of the crowd. When Blake visits the gym next, he engages in an intense physical fight, dodging weights and gym equipment thrown by the drunken and drug-crazed Eriksen. He finds Mary Tate at the gym, who had just moments earlier been assaulted by Eriksen in an amyl nitrite fueled rage. When the contestants at the Mr. Universe show discover that the prize money has been stolen, they run after Santo, who himself is actually running to try to meet Mary Tate. The chase results in the wave of bodybuilders pouring out into the streets of Birmingham, to the amazed crowd of onlookers who see them. The bodybuilders take advantage of this unexpected attention to put on an impromptu posing routine for the crowd, and the members of the crowd join in, imitating the athletes' poses and enjoying themselves. Ultimately, Craig sarcastically derides his former bosses at the real-estate firm, and decides to go into the gym business with Santo. Craig has finally \\"found himself\\" and discovered a true place in the sun, and true friendships, and he mocks his former boss Jabo with an exaggerated bodybuilding pose - acting as a final burning of the bridge between his old life and his new one. He moves out of his family's mansion, passing on all of his old family memorabilia to his loyal butler, and leaves behind his old self once and for all - on the way to a new and exciting future.

In 1912–1917, Andriienko- Nechytailo studied with Rerikh, Rylov, and Bilibin at the art school of the Society for the Promotion of the Arts in Saint Petersburg. In 1914–1916, he exhibited the composition Black Dome and his first cubist works in Saint Petersburg. In 1914, he participated in an international graphics exhibition in Leipzig. In 1917–1924, he devoted most of his time to designing stage sets for various theaters—in Saint Petersburg, Odessa, Prague, Paris, and for the Royal Opera in Bucharest. In Paris, where he lived from 1923, he also worked on sets for the films Casanova and Sheherazade and continued to paint in the cubist-constructivist style (e.g., Composition (1924), Construction 1924, or A Person 1926). In the 1930s Andriienko-Nechytailo produced a series of surrealist paintings (e.g., A Fair Stall 1933). He switched to neorealism in the 1940s and painted a number of portraits as well as a series the cityscapes Disappearing Paris (such as Rue Carpeaux 1946, Rue Paul Barruel 1954, Rue Cambronne 1954, and Paysage du Cycle 1956). From 1958 he returned to constructivism and abstraction. Andriienko-Nechytailo's work is characterized by a precision of composition that harmonizes subtly with color. His stage sets are remarkable for their laconic quality and architectural schematism, and his costume designs, for their richness. His paintings can be found in the City Museum of Modern Art and the Arsenal Library in Paris, the National Library in Vienna, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the National Museum in Lviv, and Ukrainian émigré museums and private art collections.

The section has generated some case law, including the essential case R. v. Smith (1987), in which it was partially defined, and R. v. Latimer (2001), a famous case in which Saskatchewan farmer Robert Latimer protested that his long, mandatory minimum sentence for the murder of his disabled daughter was cruel and unusual. The section states: Definition R. v. SmithSmith v. R., 1987 CanLII 64 (S.C.C.), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 1045. was the first case in which section 12 was considered by the Supreme Court of Canada. The Court, however, could and did follow previous interpretations of cruel and unusual punishments in pre-Charter case law, namely Miller and Cockriell v. The Queen (1977). Cruel and unusual punishment was thus defined as punishment \\"so excessive as to outrage standards of decency\\" or \\"grossly disproportionate to what would have been appropriate.\\" Justice Lamer, writing for the Court in R. v. Smith, went on to provide some guides as to how to measure proportionality, listing as special considerations the seriousness of the crime committed by the individual, the \\"personal characteristics\\" of the individual, and the various types of punishments available that could effectively \\"punish, rehabilitate or deter this particular offender or to protect the public from this particular offender.\\" Later, the Court would add in R. v. Goltz (1991)R. v. Goltz, 1991 CanLII 51 (S.C.C.), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 485. and R. v. Morrisey (2000)R. v. Morrisey, 2000 SCC 39 (CanLII), [2000] 2 S.C.R. 90, 2000 SCC 39. that how the individual would be impacted by the punishment in practise, the objectives of the punishment, whether other kinds of punishments could be used instead, and how other types of criminals are punished could be relevant to a section 12 test. Still, the test is not strict but rather deferential to the government. In Steele v. Mountain Institution (1990),Steele v. Mountain Institution, 1990 CanLII 50 (S.C.C.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1385. Justice Cory wrote for the Court that a judicial discovery of a cruel and unusual punishment should be \\"rare and unique\\". The Parliament of Canada's ability to judge the appropriateness of various punishments is not absolute, but courts are generally encouraged to exercise restraint in correcting Parliament. Prison Sentences If longer than necessary, to a degree that can be considered \\"grossly disproportionate,\\" certain prison sentences can be considered cruel and unusual and therefore unconstitutional under section 12. In R. v. Smith itself, the prison sentence of an alleged cocaine dealer was deemed so long as to be cruel and unusual under the Charter. While Parliament had the power to make laws in which a certain crime could result in a minimum length of time that must be served in prison, this could be unconstitutional if the law prescribes that same minimum length of time for a type of crime that \\"covers many substances of varying degrees of danger.\\" Specifically, the law did not consider how much cocaine was involved and why the rights claimant was acquiring it. The Court again considered whether a minimum prison sentence perceived as lengthy would be cruel and unusual in the case R. v. Latimer.R. v. Latimer, 2001 SCC 1 (CanLII), [2001] 1 S.C.R. 3, 2001 SCC 1. Latimer, who had murdered his disabled daughter, argued the 10 years that he would definitely serve (he could be in prison for longer if denied parole) was so long as to be cruel and unusual. The basis of this argument was that the murder was committed as a type of mercy killing. The Court in this case decided the sentence was not unconstitutional, noting the crime \\"resulted in the most serious of all possible consequences, namely, the death of the victim.\\" While Latimer had been convicted of second as opposed to first-degree murder, the Court added that \\"second degree murder is an offence accompanied by an extremely high degree of criminal culpability.\\" In this section 12 case, the principle of mens rea was considered vital. Execution In the 2001 extradition case United States v. Burns,United States v. Burns, 2001 SCC 7 (CanLII), [2001] 1 S.C.R. 283, 2001 SCC 7. the Supreme Court declined to decide whether capital punishment would classify in Canadian law as a cruel and unusual punishment and therefore a direct violation of section 12. They did, however, state that execution certainly \\"engages the underlying values of the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment,\\" noting its impossibility to correct (in cases of wrongful conviction) and its perceived \\"arbitrary\\" nature, as well as the skepticisms that it really would decrease crime rates. The Court also took into consideration that Parliament had already abolished the death penalty within Canada itself. Torture Torture is inherently cruel and unusual under section 12. As the Supreme Court wrote in Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2002),Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3. torture is \\"so inherently repugnant that it could never be an appropriate punishment, however egregious the offence.\\" The Court noted that the \\"prospect of torture induces fear and its consequences may be devastating, irreversible, indeed, fatal.\\" This view of torture goes back to R. v. Smith, in which Justice Lamer said that \\"some punishments or treatments will always be grossly disproportionate and will always outrage our standards of decency: for example, the infliction of corporal punishment.\\" In addition to violating section 12, in Suresh it was found that torture violates rights to liberty and security of person under section 7, and shocks the conscience. Therefore, Canada may not extradite people to countries where they may face torture.

In 1932, he moved from Romania to Paris. He met the secretary of Prokofiev who introduced him amongst the artistic colony of Montparnasse. There he developed a binding friendship with Jean Hélion and mingled with the abstract artists who revolved around Michel Seuphor and Joaquín Torres García. Soon Anatole Jakovsky became an art critic focusing on the abstract painters and in particular the Abstraction \\"movement - Creation \\" of Auguste Herbin of whom he wrote the first monograph. His first papers are devoted to Calder, Arp, Delaunay, Hélion, Mondrian, Nicholson, Pevsner, Seligmann, Villon, Vulliamy, Braque, Picasso, Zadkine... All of whom become friends. He also maintained a very close relationship with Robert Delaunay. Together, in 1939, they created \\"The Keys of the Paving Stones\\", the first plastic book. It is a collection of poems signed \\"Anatole Delagrave\\", illustrated by Robert Delaunay and made of plates of rhodoïde fluorescent. It is the first and last time that Anatole Jakovsky had recourse to a pseudonym. The work was drawn with 100 plates which are on show at the In the process of exploring various avenues of interest, Jakovsky met the naïve painter Jean Fous. There, in 1942, while helping him unpack books and various objects, he discovered canvases in a portfolio case of a Rousseau Customs officer which caught his interest. From that moment on, Anatole Jakovsky officially devoted himself to defend, promote and collect naïve painting. In 1949, he made his first appearance with the Editions J Damase in Paris, his first significant work on this artistic expression: \\"Naive painting\\". He did not cease writing forewords, monographs, and critical pieces as well as organizing international exhibitions of Naïve art, gathering little by little probably the most significant collection of naïve paintings, which he eventually donated with all his files to the town of Nice in 1978. Four years later, the Museum of the Castle of Sainte-Hélène bearing her name, preserved 600 canvases and drawings, sculptures, paintings under glass recalling the complete history of the Naïve art from the 17th century to the present time. Jakovsky's files have been integrated into the museum archives which holds exceptional documents legitimating the existence of this art among the first steps of all autonomous creations of the 20th century. Parallel with his interest in naïve painting, Anatole Jakovsky developed an interest in Gaston Chaissac of whom he wrote the first biography; Alphonse Allais, whom he discovered; the history of tobacco, the collections of pipes which it compared with Marcel Duchamp; old robots; old postcards; the history of the Eiffel Tower; the Palate of the Factor Horse and the Rocks of Rotheneuf; art populaire... Atole Jakovsky was a man in constant quest of discovery. He knew how to anticipate the taste of his contemporaries. He foresaw man on the moon and predicted World War II war as early as 1935. His eclecticism, his perspicacity, his pugnacity and stubbornness allowed us all to discover a whole new art culture.

It is the first part of the 13th episode of the second season, and the first half of the 33rd episode overall. It was directed by Aaron Springer and written by Springer, C.H. Greenblatt, and Merriwether Williams, with the animation directed by Frank Weiss. Greenblatt also served as the storyboard artist. The series follows the adventures and endeavours of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward encounter the Flying Dutchman, a ghostly pirate who seeks to acquire a new eternal crew to scare the residents of Bikini Bottom. As SpongeBob and Patrick do a poor job as his crew, the pirate considers devouring them instead, leading the two to try and figure out how to thwart his plan. \\"Shanghaied\\" originally aired as a television special on Nickelodeon in the United States on March 9, 2001, and featured a poll where viewers can vote on the outcome of the episode; subsequent broadcasts have since shown a revised version which removed references to this voting feature. The episode received critical acclaim from online pop culture critics for its extensive and hilarious gags, and is generally ranked highly among their lists for the best SpongeBob SquarePants episodes. The original broadcast version was released on the \\"The First 100 Episodes\\" DVD of the series in 2009 while the revised version was released on \\"The Complete Second Season\\" DVD set in 2004. Plot In Encino, California, SpongeBob SquarePants fan Patchy the Pirate presents his favorite episode \\"Shanghaied\\" to audiences. SpongeBob is shocked to find that an anchor (which he mistakes for a \\"baby\\") has suddenly dropped onto his house during breakfast, and alerts his next door neighbor Squidward to what happened. As Patrick shows up to take notice of the anchor, it soon swings from SpongeBob's house to Squidward's. This compels Squidward to begin climbing the anchor rope to see where it comes from, with SpongeBob and Patrick joining him. The three come across a large, floating, and glowing ship, which Squidward proceeds to board, impatiently demanding to know its owner. As SpongeBob tries to recall the ship's owner, the Flying Dutchman appears and insists on knowing who disturbs him, upon which SpongeBob naively expresses to him Squidward's complaints. After the Flying Dutchman burns Squidward for his alleged insults, the pirate turns to SpongeBob and Patrick for their own punishment, to which they try to escape from multiple times and fail. The Flying Dutchman then announces his rule that for anyone who sets foot on his ship, they will be forced to serve as his \\"ghostly\\" crew for eternity. Due to Squidward's continuous complaining, the pirate throws him through the \\"Fly of Despair\\", a seemingly endless void filled with horrific imagery, which intimidates SpongeBob and Patrick into becoming part of the ship's crew. After the Flying Dutchman instructs SpongeBob and Patrick to prepare the ship for a Bikini Bottom haunting spree, they prove inept at their haunting task, failing to frighten citizens even with the pirate leading by example. Due to their poor performance, the Flying Dutchman decides that he will eat SpongeBob and Patrick instead of letting them continue to be his crew. The two then try to escape through the perfume department, though they still end up on the ship. However, they overhear the Flying Dutchman mentioning in his diary that he could not eat without his dining sock, which leads the two to try and take it. The pirate notices them, and tries to take the sock back, which results in a stalemate. The Flying Dutchman proposes that when they give back the sock, he will give them three wishes. Upon settling the terms of the proposition, Patrick unwittingly wastes the first wish by wishing they had known this earlier, while SpongeBob wishes that Squidward could see them having wishes. Squidward safely returns to his home after passing through the void, only to be brought back to the ship by SpongeBob's wish. Upon realizing there is only one wish left, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward argue as to who should get the last wish. The Flying Dutchman intervenes and uses eeny, meeny, miny, moe to ultimately decide who gets the wish, with SpongeBob ending up selected. SpongeBob then wishes that the Flying Dutchman was a vegetarian so that he will not eat them. The three are then seemingly transported back to SpongeBob's pineapple home, but they quickly realize that they have also been turned into fruits, and are now in the Flying Dutchman's blender. A chase ensues as they bounce their blender away from the pirate, who now resides in a hippie van with a mast. After the episode proper, Patchy tries to read fan mail, only to be blown up with his parrot Potty who lit a fuse on himself, not knowing it is no longer planned for the program. Release \\"Shanghaied\\" originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States as a television special titled \\"You Wish\\" on March 9, 2001. In the special, viewers who tuned in can vote by telephone or online for who gets the wish at the end of the episode. After SpongeBob received the most votes, the original episode proper had SpongeBob get the wish, and Patchy then featured what would have happened if viewers voted for either Squidward or Patrick. For every subsequent broadcast of the episode, SpongeBob is the official character selected to get the wish, while the segments featuring Patchy the Pirate are trimmed down to remove any reference to the original polling feature of the episode. The original broadcast version of the episode was released on the 14-disc DVD collection titled \\"The First 100 Episodes\\" on September 22, 2009, while the revised version was released on \\"SpongeBob SquarePants: The Complete Second Season\\" DVD collection on October 19, 2004; the latter release includes a commentary track for the episode from director Aaron Springer, animation director Frank Weiss, and writer C.H. Greenblatt. The revised version would also be featured in the UK edition of the \\"SpongeBob Squarepants: Ghoul Fools\\" DVD release on October 8, 2012, with dubbing in French, German, Italian, and Dutch. A five-minute edit of the episode was released on the online platform YouTube by the official SpongeBob SquarePants YouTube account. Critical reception \\"Shanghaied\\" received critical acclaim from online pop culture critics.

He received his doctorate in sciences mathematiques from the University of Budapest in 1887. He served twice as the Rector of the University of Belgrade and was elected three times as president of the Serbian Royal Academy (1931-1937). Biography Bogdan Gavrilović was born in Novi Sad on 1 January 1864, to Sofija and Alexander Gavrilović. Bogdan was lucky to have a grandfather as a teacher and a principal of the grammar school he attended. Furthermore, his father was a professor and director of the Lycée in the town he was born. He spent six years at the Lycée (secondary school, based on the French lycées) and during this time he proved to be one of the top students in every subject he studied. With such sound academic grounding and being an excellent student, he received the Sava Tekelija scholarship to study in Budapest. There at the Tekelianum (a Serbian educational institution), he studied at the University of Budapest, where he obtained his doctor's degree in mathematics in 1887. After graduation, he aimed to bring these subjects into general teaching practice, and at the same time initiated a wide-ranging reform of teacher education in Serbia. That same year he was appointed professor at the Grande école in Belgrade (which in 1905 became the University of Belgrade). He lived in Belgrade until his death in 1947, active as a university professor up until Yugoslavia was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1941. Before the turn of the century he had published two voluminous university textbooks—900-page \\"Analytical Geometry\\" (1896), and \\"Theory of Determinants\\" (1899) on Linear algebra. Both works may be considered as capital works in mathematics in Serbia. Academician Radivoj Kašanin once wrote: \\"Both, especially the latter (Theory of Determinants), would do honor to any nation, and many countries, at that time more powerful and luckier than ours, could not boast of such works\\". For a whole decade at the beginning of the 20th century Bogdan Gavrilović was busy mostly with scientific subjects, publishing a score of excellent treatises, mainly in the periodical Glas, the official organ of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU), and Rad of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb. His interest was in the fields of algebra (theory of numbers and Linear algebra), analytical geometry and theory of functions. He was elected member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences in 1901 and of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences in 1906. He later expanded into the foundations of mathematics. Professor Gavrilović was an excellent organizer of scientific work at the Belgrade University and in the Academy. He made a great contribution to the universal acclamation of Belgrade's Grande école into the University of Belgrade, evidenced in his writings (\\"Spomenica o otvaranju Univerziteta\\", 1906). He subsequently became its rector, raised teaching levels and initiated the university's development. Also, he was three consecutive times (1931-1937) elected president of the Serbian Royal Academy. In 1894 he founded the mathematical library of the Department of Mathematics which was unfortunately destroyed near the end of the Second World War. With Mihailo Petrović Alas, Milutin Milanković and Dimitrije Nešić, he is credited for introducing modern mathematics in Serbia at the beginning of the 20th century. Gavrilović held many important scientific and social functions and received numerous high honors. In addition, he was a member of Circolo matematico di Palermo, doctor honoris causa of the University of Athens, president of the Nikola Tesla Society, and director of The Nikola Tesla Institute. He was also one of the founders of the Mathematical Institute in Belgrade (1946). He wrote a philosophical work in 1926 entitled \\"Kultura i Harmonija\\" (Culture and Harmony). His view was that mathematics was valued in its connection with philosophy as well as with experimental sciences. Both Bogdan Gavrilović and Mihailo Petrović Alas were credited for encouraging Milutin Milanković to leave his post in Vienna and come to Belgrade. His son, Stoyan Gavrilović, born in Belgrade in 1896, was Assistant Secretary of State in the Royal Yugoslav Government.

The album was released in October 2004 by the label Universal Latino. The songs covered are from a variety of genres, including new wave, hip hop music, punk, and traditional music of Mexico. The title, in apparent reference to the playful cover tracks throughout, means \\"with all due respect\\" in Spanish. This album received a Latin Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Album, Duo or Group at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2005.

This track includes references to the band's antipathy towards Vergara because of decisions he made in that club. The song was also motivated by Vergara's disparaging comment «Me pareció ver a un lindo gatito» (\\"I though I saw a pussy cat\\" or \\"I tawt I taw a puddy tat\\" in Spanish) when speaking about Mexican soccer club Pumas de la UNAM. Originally, Me Vale Vergara circulated freely on the Internet as a demo version, so when the band decided to include it in the re-edit, it had some arrangements made. The track includes collaborations by Pumas de la UNAM team players such as \\"Parejita\\" López, Leandro Augusto, and Aílton da Silva. For this special edition of the album, the cover design was changed, with a black background instead of the white background in the first version. There are a few added demos of some tracks, as well as a DVD with the music videos for \\"Amateur\\" and \\"Marciano\\", including a promo and a \\"behind the cameras\\" special. This re-edit was released only in Mexico and the US under the name Con Todo Respeto, Unlimited Edition. = Track listing = # Amateur # Diseño rolas # Marciano II (Punk Version) # The Revolution Will Not be Televised (demo version) # La Boa a go-go (demo version) # Chavas # Mamar # Quen Pon-Ponk (demo version) # Da da da # Perro negro granjero # Agüela # Mi agüita amarilla (demo version) # Me vale vergara # Marciano # The Revolution Will Not Be Televised (La Revo) # La boa a go-go # Quen Pon-Ponk # Mi agüita amarilla # Marciano veloz (demo version)  Sales and certifications   References  2004 albums Molotov (band) albums Covers albums Universal Music Latino albums Latin Grammy Award for Best Rock Album by a Duo or Group with Vocal ","title":"Con Todo Respeto"},{"id":"3497548","text":"Bruce Rogers is a Canadian broadcast journalist, author and politician.

It is generally considered a fad diet, in that it is designed for short-term weight- loss and requires no long-term commitment. The typical claimed intent of the diet is to lose 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of weight in a week, though nutritional experts point out that it is nearly impossible to lose that much fat within a week: much of the weight lost is water. Background The origins of the diet are unknown, and it first gained popularity as a piece of faxlore in the 1980s. The cabbage soup diet has many names, usually linking the diet to a mainstream institution, including the \\"Sacred Heart Diet\\", \\"Military Cabbage Soup\\", \\"TJ Miracle Soup Diet\\", and \\"Russian Peasant Diet\\". All of the institutions named have denied a link with the diet.shmc.org As a general rule, most if not all forms of the diet emphasize that the dieter can consume as much cabbage soup as they want. Criticism Many individuals and medical professionals are critical of the diet. Most of the weight lost is water and not fat, and therefore not permanent. The amount of calories per day while on the diet is far lower than what is considered safe for long-term consumption. In addition, the recipe for the soup as often given has an extremely high sodium content, usually to make it palatable, and the diet provides practically zero protein for several days at a time. Many people report feeling weak and light-headed during the course of the diet. On a practical level, the most common forms of the soup recipe have been criticized as being bland, though spicy variations have appeared. Even so, the blandness of the soup means that few manage the entire seven days, and often report feeling nauseated whenever they smell the soup toward the end of the week-long diet. It has also been noted that flatulence is a common side effect of the diet.
