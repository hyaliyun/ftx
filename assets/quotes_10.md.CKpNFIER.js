The screenplay concerns a college freshman who is sexually assaulted by a football jock. It sums up the ordeal that rape victims experience and the sexual assault on college campuses. A stark dramatization of the \\"acquaintance rape\\" dilemma, it was originally to be broadcast on October 17, 1989, but pushed to November 6th of that year because of coverage surrounding the earthquakes in Northern California. Plot At Woodword University, a football-oriented California school, Lyn McKenna is raped and brutalized by her best friend's boyfriend, football player Ron Cooper. Lyn is hesitant to reveal this information as she fears that doing so will create a number of social issues and will simply worsen the aftermath of her experience. However, continued threats from Ron and his fellow football teammates lead Lyn into desperate action, and she requests that the school hold a disciplinary hearing against Ron, and ultimately demands that a district attorney prosecute.

The party never contested any elections. Largely the project of its co-founder and leader, Allen E.

We don't want to be LIED TO, nor undervalued again.\\" Nutik aimed his message primarily but not exclusively at Western Montreal anglophones. Nutik predicted that the party would succeed the defunct Equality Party and aimed to build on voter disappointment with the Quebec Liberal Party and the Action d√©mocratique du Qu√©bec, which Nutik said didn't offer any particular consideration to minorities.

Thinking her dead and knowing that calling the cops would only land them in jail the pair decide to bury her in the boiler room of the closed drive-in theater where Royce used to work. The two set off to deal with Mattie's dead body. While the boys begin to dig a grave downstairs, a Satanic cult led by another former employee and (former classmate of Dexter and Royce) Abel enters the supposedly abandoned drive-in and begins a ritual involving pentagrams and human bloodletting in the upstairs concession stand. Their plan is to resurrect Jason Taylor (hippie turned reluctant but rich Internet entrepreneur and Abel's unwitting hero) out of his coma. However, when Dexter walks in mid-sacrifice, everything goes awry. Dexter and Royce are captured, gagged and duct-taped and Mattie's corpse is discovered. But when some of the sacrificed follower's blood unexpectedly \\"awakens\\" Matilda an all out chase ensues. Royce and Dexter get to her first, and the trio escapes. After safely stowing Mattie in Dexter's apartment, the boys run into Omar and his beefy sidekick Garry, who deliver a few swings of a curling stone and an ultimatum ‚Äî debt (plus interest) paid by last call or he will severely injure the pair. Knowing that millionaire Jason Taylor has a safe full of money at his place, Dexter and Royce take off to break in and steal it, a plan previously mentioned by Mattie, who knows the combination to Taylor's safe. With a few unexpected bumps along the way, such as running into, accidentally knocking out and then getting high the nephew of Taylor, who was housesitting, Dexter and Royce successfully manage to steal the safe. En route back to Dexter's apartment to grab Mattie, they run into Abel. A classic car chase causes our boys to seek refuge in a mall where they encounter a midget security guard named Martin. After winning his trust (Martin has unresolved issues with cults himself) he lets them leave without further trouble. Meanwhile at the New Age Resource Centre, Mattie (having been kidnapped by Abel) has been tied to an upside-down cross along with an unconscious Jason Taylor.

It was the first iteration of the fifth generation of this Australian-made model and also included the Ford Fairmont (EA)‚Äîthe luxury- oriented version of the Falcon.  Development  The result of a development program, the EA Falcon bore a passing resemblance to the European Ford Scorpio. However under the skin, it remained an entirely Australian design, and is credited as the first Falcon model to employ wind tunnel testing. Developed under the codename EA26 (E for the large size, A for Australia, 26 for the (usually in sequence) global project number), it would retain the traditional Falcon hallmarks of width and rear-wheel drive. This proved to be the correct move as sales of the Falcon began to climb after the fuel crisis aftermath, while those of the rival Holden Commodore slipped. It became clear that Australian buying patterns had not truly changed and what the public wanted was a full-size (albeit smaller) family car. In addition, Ford's dominance of the taxi market in Australia meant that a car that could comfortably seat three along the back seat‚Äîand even the front, with a bench seat installed‚Äîwas necessary. It also ensured that Ford could retain, at least until Holden released the new Statesman/Caprice in 1990, the market for official cars for governmental use. A centre high-mount stop light (CHMSL) was added late in Series I production as it was mandated by 1 July 1989. = Engines and transmissions = The EA series brought new engines to the Ford Falcon along with across the board fuel injection, overhead camshaft cylinder head, inclined valve alloy heads and a low profile intake manifold lowering the engine height. The capacity was decreased from the previous XF which was 4.1 litres and a push rod overhead valve (OHV) design. All EA series engines utilised the corporate Ford EEC-IV engine management system. Engine choice initially comprised three straight-six units starting with the base 3.2-litre EFI which utilised a throttle body injection (TBI) or central fuel injection (CFI) induction to give at 4000 rpm and at 3250 rpm. This engine was standard on GL models although very few were sold and many owners of the 3.2-litre found lacklustre torque and the resultant driving behaviour caused increased fuel consumption versus the 3.9. Ford discontinued the engine circa December 1988. Initially an extra cost option on the Falcon GL, and standard on Falcon S and Fairmont, the 3.9-litre EFI (commonly referred to as the CFI or TBI engine) increased stroke from 79 mm to 99.31 mm while bore remained at 91.86 mm. The engine used the same TBI as the 3.2-litre and power was rated at at 4250rpm and torque at 3250 rpm. This engine would also be discontinued at the end of the EB Series 1. Standard on Fairmont Ghia and optional across the range was the multi-point injection (commonly referred to as \\"MPEFI\\") 3.9-litre. This utilised port injection along with a low profile intake manifold to increase outputs to at 4250 rpm and at 3500 rpm. The option was signified on vehicles by a \\"3.9 Multipoint\\" badge on each front fender behind the wheel arch was silver, except on Falcon S where it was red. On Falcon GL models the fitment of 215/65R14 tyres in place of either 185/75R14 (sedan) or 195/75R14 (wagon) tyres was also linked to the MPEFI option. All 30th Anniversary EA Falcons used a winged Falcon badge in the same fender location regardless of engine option causing there to be no obvious MPEFI identification. A five-speed BorgWarner T50D fully synchronised manual and BorgWarner M51 three-speed automatic transmission were offered, however the latter was replaced by a four-speed M85LE in the Series II range. The initial four-speed automatics suffered poor reliability with loss of drive common within the first . Noise, vibration, and harshness expertise later found the issue to be destructive harmonics within the transmission and this was remedied with the transmissions later being highly regarded for reliability when properly maintained. Ford would often meet repair costs for these transmissions post-warranty on a goodwill basis. Until the fix, taxi owners would continue to fit reconditioned three-speed M51 automatics to these cars, until the bell housing design was finally changed in later models preventing this practice. = Suspension and chassis = The EA carried over significant parts of the prior X series Falcon platform to save costs. Rear suspension on the sedans continued with the coil spring live axle located by upper and lower unequal length trailing arms, and a transverse watts linkage. The watts linkage had its centre pivot mounted to the differential housing carrying over the roll centre movement compromise from the XE Falcon of 1982. All wagons carried over the leaf spring suspension of prior Falcons, chosen for their performance in fleet applications including load carrying. The biggest change for the EA series was the introduction across all models and body types of a new front architecture comprising rack and pinion steering with new front suspension utilising the short and long arm long spindle (SLALS) pseudo double wishbone design. This allowed for longer shocks, optimised ball joint location, improved geometry control, and dramatically improved front end response over the XF Falcon. Standard suspension was fitted to all Falcon and Fairmont models. The Falcon S lowered ride height by and increased spring and shock rates with larger stabiliser bars. An optional Country Pack suspension offered increased ride height compared to the standard suspension and typically came with enhanced underbody protection including a sump guard. Brakes were the same across the range using a hub integrated (i.e. not a hat rotor) front ventilated disc design of 287 mm and single piston callipers sliding on the hub carrier. The rear used solid discs also at 287 mm and the rear callipers carried over the Ford handbrake system using a threaded piston applying the handbrake cable forces to the rear disc pads.  Model range  Falcon GL sedan Falcon GL wagon The EA series was available in four model variants: * Falcon GL sedan and wagon * Falcon S sedan and wagon * Fairmont sedan and wagon * Fairmont Ghia sedan and wagon No commercial vehicle variants of the EA were developed and the existing XF Falcon utility and panel van both continued in production alongside the EA passenger vehicles. = Series II = Launched in October 1989, the Series II brought with it a four-speed automatic transmission, and could be distinguished via body-coloured, rather than black B-pillars. Despite the Series II models having significantly fewer problems than the Series I, Series II prices are also affected by curtailed resale values. The same problem also affects the NA Fairlane and DA LTD, and even the utility and panel van variants, which continued with the older XF architecture. ;30th Anniversary Released in October 1990 the 30th Anniversary commemorative models were identified by a 30th Anniversary winged badge on each front fender. These vehicles carried the vast majority of the technical updates of the EB Falcon.

Aftermarket performance models  Due to the absence of a V8 engine and high performance model, the EA attracted significant interest from the Australian aftermarket industry hoping to gain Ford's approval for a factory backed model. These included: *Brock B8 *Advanced Induction Technology (\\"AIT\\") offering intercooled turbo kits sold through many Ford dealers *EA SVO *APV SR3900 *EA TSS *DJR EA Falcon *Phase Autos HO Phase 7 *EA AVO Brock B8 Australian racing identity Peter Brock formed Austech Automotive Developments to produce a selection of vehicles based on the S and Fairmont Ghia models. All Brock EA Falcons featured a unique body kit, 16inch wheel package and interior upgrades. The latter used the standard seats bolstered and trimmed in a cloth specific to the model. Brock also improved the power output through a re- profiled camshaft, ECU tuning and modification to the induction and exhaust systems. A suspension upgrade was also performed, improving handling and ride quality.

The kit used a front mount intercooler fed by extra air vents in the bumper, turbocharger, extra injectors and was signified by a build plate and instrumentation markings. EA SVO With over 1000 built, the EA SVO was the most successful aftermarket option. A creation from Australian motor racing driver and engineer Mick Webb, the EA SVO came with ROH 16-inch wheels, Recaro seats, MoMo steering wheels, suspension upgrades including Bilstein Shock Absorbers, engine modifications, spoilers and two tone grey paint work. EA TSS The EA TSS was a series of options from body kit manufacture GP Sportscars. These cars were known for the option of a JDD Twin Tire system and Sprintex supercharger system. GP also manufactured a complete body styling kit, and interior package. As the TSS was a range of options, rather than a specific model, an interested owner could have a complete car optioned up, or just specific options. As a result, some featured either just the supercharged motor, or body kit. EA AVO An Australian turbocharging company, AVO, built up a turbocharged EA falcon that held the world record for the fastest caravan tow, at .

They were formed in 1993 in Malm√∂ and are named after the Abel Ferrara film The Driller Killer. They are signed to the French record label Osmose Productions and have released seven full-length albums, and a variety of split releases to date. Their style has been described as heavy punk, hardcore punk, crust punk and D-beat. They are also strongly influenced by the sound of Discharge. Driller Killer was one of the first bands to implement death metal sound into a crust punk formula. The popularity of the crust punk and death metal fusion cemented when Osmose Productions created Kron-H impring for the main purpouse of signing Driller Killer, Disfear, Loud Pipes and Dellamorte. While the tenure with Kron-H did not generate major financial success it gained praise from undergroud critics. The bands music has been inspired by ecological destruction, with their album Fuck the World which portrays the earth with a vagina that is symbolically raped by industrialisation.

The cone forms the last part of volcanic activity that lasted many years. An earlier explosive eruption, created the prominent tuff ring that is still clearly visible extending in an arc south of Sunderlands Road. Two much smaller craters were formed to the north west of the main cone. The smaller lies buried under Pigeon Mountain Road outside number 18, and the other forms 'Heights Park' ‚Äì a private reserve for the owners of 29 ‚Äì 41 Pigeon Mountain Road and 14 ‚Äì 36 Prince Regent Drive and 33 ‚Äì 39 Tyrian Close. It forms part of the Auckland volcanic field and is popular for scientific school trips. ≈åhuiarangi is named after an ancient NgƒÅi Tai ancestress who lived here. NgƒÅi Tai are the descendants of Maui-tikitiki-a-Taranga who fished up the North Island of New Zealand and are the tangata whenua of Howick and Pakuranga. Early settlers saw many kereru, native pigeons, feeding on the pigeonwood trees here, hence the name Pigeon Mountain. It was first quarried for roading metal by Fencibles from the 1847 Fencibles settlement at Howick. Quarrying continued for many years. In the 1920s the Shaw brothers worked with Harold Kearney, Dud Langdon and Jim Taylor using a pair of draught horses to pull a dray loaded with metal. In 1848 John Campbell and James Smyth, both from the fencible ship Sir Robert Sale, had the contract to spread metal on the road from Howick to Panmure, for which they were paid 5/- per day. At that time the mountain was named Pigeon Tree Hill. The 5 acre farm immediately to the south was owned by the 1847 Irish Fitzpatrick family of Patrick and Ann who came in the \\"Minerva\\" fencible ship. They lived in a raupo hut at Howick for 2 years. They had had 12 children,9 of whom survived. The children all attended Pakuranga school, a short distance across the paddocks to the south east. Fitzpatrick later bought other land around ≈åhuiarangi / Pigeon Mountain at Hutchinson Road and Bucklands Beach Rd expanding his farm to 20 acres. A photo taken of the Pakuranga Cricket club, which played at ≈åhuiarangi / Pigeon Mountain, shows 6 of the 16 players were from the Fitzpatrick family. His original fencibles cottage was still in use in the 1960s by 2 of his grandsons who were the caretakers of the ≈åhuiarangi / Pigeon Mountain sports ground in their youth. On their death the cottage was placed at the Howick Historical village. A number of Fencibles' widows also received land south of ≈åhuiarangi / Pigeon Mountain which was very swampy. Margaret Coyle received 4 acres of land where Pakuranga College is today.The Royal New Zealand Fencibles 1847‚Äì1852. R. Alexander. G. Gibson. A. LaRoche. Deed. Waiuku . 1997. pp 65, 103, 138 The mountain has been extensively quarried, with the entire north side of the volcano removed. In 1929 a fresh water spring was uncovered and water was piped to Howick and district at a cost of 9340 pounds. The mountain is a former pa site, and some of the terracing still remains. Artefacts as well as skulls were found there in the 1960s by students from Pakuranga College. The mountain is open to the public. The north face is partly fenced off and is an almost-vertical drop of . In the southwest corner there is a playing field built on a free-draining scoria base. On the quarried northwestern side is a kindergarten and Scout hall. In the 2014 Treaty of Waitangi settlement with the Tamaki Makaurau Collective of 13 Auckland iwi, the volcano was officially named ≈åhuiarangi / Pigeon Mountain and ownership was vested to the collective.

Introduction Predating the Independence of Namibia in 1990, the International Commission for South East Atlantic Fisheries (ICSEAF) was responsible for the management of the fisheries in the region both in the exclusive economic zones of Angola, Namibia and South Africa and in the adjacent water of the high seas. ICSEAF Convention came into force in 1971, with the Secretariat located in Madrid, Spain and was established mainly in response to increased levels of exploitation of newly discovered rich fishing grounds off the Namibian coast by the fleet of Distant Water Fishing Nations (DWFNs). ICSEAF failed its mandate largely because Contracting Parties did not comply with the conservation and management measures they adopted and that the Commission lacked effective compliance and enforcement mechanisms. Fishing efforts increased rapidly during the 1960s and throughout the 1970s and 1980s on targeted species such as hake, horse mackerel and pilchards off Namibia and horse mackerels (Trachurus capensis and T. trecae) and sardinellas (Sardinella aurita and S. maderensis) in southern Angolan waters. For example, in 1965 about 193,000 tonnes of hake were caught mainly off Namibia and by 1972, a peak of 820,000 tonnes was recorded, followed by a declining trend to about 338,000 tonnes landed by 1988. At Independence in 1990, the new government of Namibia proclaimed through the Act of Parliament a EEZ and the jurisdiction over the fisheries within the zone. The organisation became inoperative following Namibia's refusal to join it. Meanwhile, the high seas fisheries of the southeast Atlantic were left without a managing body. With new mandate and direction, SEAFO replaced ICSEAF. SEAFO is an intergovernmental regional fisheries management organisation responsible for ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of the fishery resources (excluding migratory fish stocks) in the high seas of southeast Atlantic Ocean, within the Convention Area. The SEAFO Convention Area is situated in the southeast Atlantic region, outside the exclusive economic zones of the coastal states of Angola, Namibia, South Africa and United Kingdom‚Äôs overseas territory of St. Helena and its dependencies Tristan da Cunha and Ascension Island. It covers an area of about 16 million square kilometres. The idea to establish SEAFO came from Namibia in 1995 because of the concern that certain commercially valuable straddling fish stocks required better protection to avoid compromising their potential in Namibian waters as a result of unsustainable fishing practices on the adjacent high seas. The idea was welcomed and greatly supported by the coastal neighbours of Angola, South Africa and United Kingdom (on behalf of St. Helena and its dependencies Tristan da Cunha and Ascension Islands) and by DWFN's of EU, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Poland, Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Ukraine and United States ‚Äì all of which have history of fishing or demonstrated real interest in the fisheries in the area. Complex negotiations between the coastal States and the DWFN started in 1997 and were completed in 2000 with the adoption of SEAFO Convention. SEAFO Convention is largely based on 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 1995 United Nations Fish Stock Agreement (UNFSA) and is internationally hailed as the most contemporary, responsive instrument for conservation and sustainable utilisation of living marine resources in high seas. The Convention was signed on 20 April 2001 in Windhoek by Angola, the European Community, Iceland, Namibia, Norway, Republic of Korea, South Africa, United Kingdom (on behalf of St. Helena and its dependencies Tristan da Cunha and Ascension Islands) and the United States of America. It entered into force on 13 April 2003 after the deposit of instruments of ratification by Namibia and Norway and approval by the European Community. Angola deposited its instrument of ratification on 7 March 2006, making it a 4th Contracting Party of SEAFO. The role played by the developing coastal States in the drafting of SEAFO Convention was extensive. The Commission is the highest decision-making body of the Organisation and it meets annually to among others, formulate fisheries conservation and management measures, review compliance issues and adopt the budget. Decision on matters of substance, within SEAFO is taken by consensus among the Parties. There is also a provision for non acceptance of a decision by a Contracting Party. Budgetary contributions are made up of an equal basic fee and a fee determined from the total catch of species covered by the Convention. SEAFO allows States and regional economic integration organizations to become parties to the Convention and encourages cooperation with non-Parties. Compliance with monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) is one of the criteria for consideration in determining the nature and extent of participatory rights in SEAFO fishing opportunities. SEAFO Convention foresees the creation of a robust system of observation, inspection, compliance and enforcement that includes control measures linked to flag State duties and port State duties as well as at-sea and in port inspection, boarding and inspection of vessels on a reciprocal basis, observer programs and procedures to follow up on infringements. For transparency and openness, SEAFO accords accessibility of observers to its meetings and to its documents. SEAFO Scientific Committee provides scientific advice to the Commission on the conservation and management issues such as the status of the resources and the harvesting levels. Subsidiary bodies may be established by the Commission, as needs arise, from time-to-time. The day-to-day work of the Organisation is coordinated, administered and overseen by the Secretariat, based in Swakopmund, Namibia. General Principles SEAFO Convention provides fundamental principles that govern conservation and management of living marine resources under SEAFO's jurisdiction. Fisheries management is based on the best available scientific evidence, and where scientific information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate, the precautionary approach principle prevails, until such time when more information is known about the resources dynamics, ecosystem structures and functions. The general principles encompass the concept of ecosystem approach to fisheries management. In particular conservation and protection of species that belong to the same ecosystem as, or are associated with or dependent upon the harvested fishery resources (e.g., seabirds, cetaceans, seals and marine turtle)s are given emphasis. In addition the general principles call for the minimization of harmful impacts on all living marine resources and protection of marine environment and its biodiversity. Fish stocks covered Living marine resources covered by SEAFO including fish (such as orange roughy Hoplostethus atlanticus, alfonsino Beryx splendens, Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides, hake Merluccius paradoxus, horse mackerel Trachurus capensis, chub mackerel Scomber japonicus, cardinalfishes Epigonus species, oreo dories and armourhead Pseudopentaceros species, some shark species and rays), molluscs (such as octopus and squid) and crustaceans (such as deep sea red crab Chaceon maritae). Some of the most notable commercially important species are orange roughy, alfonsino ‚Äì harvested by bottom trawling, and deep sea red crab ‚Äì capture by pots or traps and Patagonian toothfish caught by longlining. Highly migratory fish stocks such as tuna, swordfish, marlin and sharks in the region are covered by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Most of SEAFO fish resources are found in deep waters (greater than 500 m depth) and tend to be slow grower, long-lived, late-matured and therefore could be vulnerable to over‚Äìexploitation. Their biological and ecological dynamics are not well known and there are no good historic time series. Conservation and management regime SEAFO has adopted innovative ways to manage deep sea fisheries, taking into account the EAF management, the precautionary approach principles as well as the reliance on the best scientific available evidence. Since 2005 and 2007, the following conservation and management measures were adopted: * Limiting catches for deep sea red crab and Patagonian toothfish in South East Atlantic waters due to concerns on the sustainability of the current fisheries and of the potential negative impacts on the vulnerable marine habitats * Reducing incidental mortality of seabirds, especially petrels and albatrosses, by fishing gear adjustments and other technical measures during fishing operations * Prohibiting the ‚Äúshark finning‚Äù practice whereby vessels cut the valuable shark fins off and retain them on board while discarding the carcass of the shark * Reducing incidental mortality of sea turtles in fishing operations, notably by promptly releasing turtles entangled in fishing gear * Implementing closed areas in numerous fragile marine ecosystems such as seamounts to ensure long-term conservation and protection in line with precautionary approach principles while more scientific information is becoming available. For monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) of fishing activities, SEAFO has adopted comprehensive and stringent measures including the following: * Mandatory on board the fishing vessel a scientific observers in order to collect the required catch and biological data on the stocks * Mandatory automatic satellite vessel monitoring system (VMS) for all vessels fishing in the SEAFO area * Port State inspection scheme based on standards set forth in the FAO Model Scheme * Prohibiting fishing activities in vulnerable marine areas with prominent seamounts * Banning of transshipments at sea in order to combat illegal, unregulated and unreported fisheries (IUU) * Establishment of a Register of SEAFO-authorised fishing vessels * Established a list of vessels presumed to have carried out IUU fishing activities including IUU vessels that are in the IUU lists of Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO), North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Cooperation with other organisations SEAFO recognizes the need to cooperate with coastal States and all other States and Organisations having a real interest in the fishery resources of the South East Atlantic Ocean. At regional level, SEAFO and Angola, Namibia, South Africa and UK‚Äôs overseas territories in the region are working closely to ensure compatibility of conservation and management measures adopted for straddling fish stocks on the high seas and in areas of national jurisdiction. SEAFO has strong link with the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem Programme (BCLME) and the Benguela Current Commission (BCC) and shares information on the fisheries and the environment. At international level, SEAFO has working relationships with various regional fisheries management organisations, notably North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), Commission for the Conservation of the Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NAFO) and the International Commission for the Conservation of the Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Cooperation with these organisations is centred on the exchange of experiences on all matters of mutual interests, including on sharing of data on by-catch species and information on compliance matters such as on IUU fishing activities. SEAFO is working closely with the United Nations in particular with FAO and with the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea (DOALOS) aiming at strengthening high seas fisheries governance.

Historically, in the present day territory of Hungary, discourses on women‚Äôs roles, rights, and political access, along with feminist movements, have developed within the context of extremely traditional gender roles that were influenced by Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism and Calvinism. More recently, the Communist doctrine on women‚Äôs place in society was also influential. The post-communist era in Hungary has produced a number of organizations to address the needs of the nation‚Äôs women and mobilize female voters, and several universities now have gender studies programs. In the 21st century, the entry in the European Union has led to a more 'Westernized' culture. Pre-WWI In 1790, a man named P√©ter B√°r√°ny petitioned the National Gathering of Hungarian Noblemen to grant female nobles the right to observe the Gathering's proceedings. He argued that these women would be better prepared to raise politically active, patriotic sons, but the assembly did not accept his petition. The first women‚Äôs organization to form in Hungary was the Pester Women's Charitable Society, founded in 1817; by the end of the nineteenth century there were several hundred similar organizations throughout the kingdom, although, for the most part, they had little involvement in politics. When women gained access to secondary education in the mid- nineteenth century, the large presence of active women‚Äôs groups helped win the students a more academic curriculum, rather than one that focused on being a wife and mother. In 1895, women were first allowed to study philosophy, medicine, and pharmacy at the university level. In addition to the advocacy of women‚Äôs groups, these advances were due, in part, to the Hungarian push to elevate its status as a power in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, and present itself as an increasingly modernized region. R√≥zsika B√©dy-Schwimmer In 1904, R√≥zsika B√©dy-Schwimmer (Rosika Schwimmer), a pacifist and women‚Äôs rights advocate, founded the Association of Feminists. The group pushed for women's suffrage and helped bring the issue to a parliamentary vote on three separate occasions, although each attempt was unsuccessful. The Men's League for Women's Suffrage was founded in 1910, and in 1913 the 7th Congress of the International Women's Suffrage Alliance met in Budapest. The Association of Feminists worked closely with the city council of Budapest to establish a women's aid office and day care centers; they also published a journal on women's issues that helped to raise public awareness of women's concerns. Other groups active in the early twentieth century included female members of the Social Democrats, and the National Federation of Women Clerical Workers, which sought improvements in the rights of female professionals. Between the Wars Following World War I, an independent Hungary began to define itself in a ‚Äúnational framework,‚Äù and the women‚Äôs movement shifted to fit into this new framework effectively.Andrea Peto, ‚ÄúHungarian women in politics, 1945-51,‚Äù in Power and the People: A Social History of Central European Politics, 1945-56, eds. Eleonore Breuning, Jill Lewis, and Gareth Pritchard (Manchester University Press, 2005), chapt. 16. Following the brief Communist seizure of power by B√©la Kun in 1919, feminist groups, and other organizations considered revolutionary, became smaller, covert, and less influential; finding themselves in similar circumstances, some feminists, Communists, and other radicals formed working relationships. Hungarian women won partial suffrage and the right to serve in parliament, while the emergence of a party system of government gave women a new, socially accepted avenue for recognition and involvement. Women were particularly active in the National Unity Party and the Christian Women‚Äôs Camp. As their political opportunities expanded, Hungarian women were simultaneously gaining attention and support in a very traditional role: as mothers and caretakers of the nation‚Äôs children. Beginning in 1941, women‚Äôs groups began to diverge further, due mainly to political events leading up to World War II. Suffrage and politics Women attained limited suffrage in 1918 (voting for the first time in 1922); and full suffrage in 1945, but as in other communist states, civil rights of both men and women were symbolic, as the system was an authoritarian one. During the communist era, women were members of the parliament (they made up 18% of members in 1949 and 30% in 1980), but this was merely for the facade, as they had little power in practice, with the key players deciding policies being men. Hungary held its first free elections after the fall of communism, and only 7% of the elected members were women in 1990. As of 2018, women made up 12.6% of the parliament.http://archive.ipu.org/WMN-e/classif.htm Communist era Women were seen as a vital part of the productivity of the state, both as mothers and wives of male workers, and as workers themselves. Although women were included in the workforce in a more equal way under communist rule, they generally were placed under greater state control with regard to their personal freedoms, especially concerning reproductive rights, sexuality, and family life.Laszlo K√ºrti, ‚ÄúHungary,‚Äù in Eastern Europe: Politics, Culture, and Society Since 1939, ed.Sabrina Ramet (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1998), 76-77. Despite the official discourse on equality, the communist regime did not seek to genuinely address the deep social fabric of gender subordination. Nevertheless, women did see some gains under communism, despite remaining subordinate to men; they received greater access to secondary and university education, especially in technical fields.Sharon L. Wolchik, ‚ÄúWomen and the Politics of Gender in Communist and Post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe,‚Äù in Eastern Europe: Politics, Culture, and Society Since 1939, ed. Sabrina Ramet (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1998), 286. Post- communist era Beginning in 1989, women‚Äôs and feminist groups formed and established strong organizations which have worked to address the needs of Hungarian women. The post-communist economy has been particularly hard on blue-collar women who, in addition to providing income, are responsible for maintaining a home and caring for the family. Another important issue for women in the early 1990s was the restriction of abortion rights by conservative political parties. The Feminist Network, which emerged in May 1990, has been a leader in carrying on the movement for women‚Äôs equality, and the Federation of Young Democrats has been an important political party for female youth and women‚Äôs movements.Chris Corrin, Magyar Women: Hungarian Women‚Äôs Lives, 1960s-1990s (New York: St.Martin‚Äôs Press, 1994), 7-8. The issue of domestic violence has also come to public attention during the past two decades; an important change was the removal of the marital exemption from the rape law in 1997. Hungary has also ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings in 2013. Family life, fertility and reproductive health As in most other European countries, in the 21st century, family dynamics have become more liberal, with cohabitation growing in popularity, and the link between fertility and marriage decreasing. In 2015, 47.9% of births were to unmarried women. Hungary has a sub- replacement fertility rate; the total fertility rate (TFR) was 1.43 children born/woman in 2015. The maternal mortality rate in Hungary is 21 deaths/100,000 live births (as of 2010).

Quartz is one of the most common minerals in the earth's crust, and most quartz veins do not carry gold, but those that have gold are avidly hunted by prospectors. In the shallow, oxidized zones of quartz reef deposits, the gold occurs in its metallic state, and is easily recovered with simple equipment. Quartz reef mining played an important role in 19th century gold-mining districts such as Bendigo, Victoria, Central Otago in New Zealand, and the California mother lode. Mining Headframe with gin wheel. Abandoned Kilimafeza gold mine, Serengeti NP, Tanzania Mining the ore usually required mine shafts sunk to mine quartz from the reefs, sometimes deep underground. Horizontal tunnels called drifts were dug out from the shaft at different levels to find the gold-bearing rock. All the ore was hoisted to the surface for processing. Water had to be removed by pumping. Big hoisting engines were installed to hoist lifts and buckets up the shafts. On the surface above the shaft stands a building known as the headframe. This contained a wheel called a gin wheel which lifted buckets of rock up to a raised platform called a brace. Wheeled buckets then carried the rock along elevated tracks to waste dumps or processing works. The steel cable that hoisted the bucket passed over the gin wheel. Processing The gold was brought to the surface as small particles embedded in lumps of quartz. The quartz was then crushed into a fine dust by stamping batteries in a stamp mill. A stamp battery contained a row of stamps. On the bottom of each stamp was a heavy piece of iron steel. Each battery was driven by a cam shaft which was turned by a water wheel. The steel shoes went up and down between wooden guides and pounded the quartz which had been fed into steel boxes underneath the stampers. Ideally the stamping batteries would work 24 hours a day. After crushing, the quartz was mixed with water to make mud which then ran down sloping tables, called concentrating tables. On top of these tables were copper sheets coated with mercury, which amalgamates with gold. The gold particles stuck to the mercury, and could be collected from there. Mining Technology: Overview Quartz mines * Victoria Quartz mine, Bendigo, Victoria, Australia (Its deepest shaft used to mine a quartz reef was almost a kilometre and a half deep.) * Central Deborah Gold Mine, Bendigo (The mine still stands today.

Parentage  Arion's siring by Poseidon in stallion form varies by author: according to the Pseudo-Apollodorus, the horse was foaled by Demeter while she was \\"in the likeness of a Fury\\";Apollodorus, Library 3.6.8 Pausanias reported that, according to Antimachus, the horse was the foal of Gaia, the Earth, herself. According to Quintus Smyrnaeus, Arion was begotten by loud- piping Zephyrus on a harpy (probably Podarge).Quintus Smyrnaeus. Fall of Troy, Book 4.569 ff  Mythology  In the Epic Cycle Arion was mounted most notably by Adrastus, king of Argos. The earliest literary mention of Arion is in Homer's Iliad (Book XXIII, ln. 346). Statius also made mention of the horse in his 1st-century Latin epic poem the Thebaid (Book VI, 301). =Homer= On the subject of Arion, Homer said in the Iliad:Homer, Iliad 23.346 :\\"... there is no man that shall catch thee by a burst of speed, neither pass thee by, nay, not though in pursuit he were driving goodly Arion, the swift horse of Adrastus, that was of heavenly stock ...‚Äù =Pseudo-Apollodorus= Pseudo- Apollodorus (Book III, Ch. 6, sect. 8) recounts that in the defeat of the Argives, the same battle in which Eteocles and Polynices slew each other, Adrastus alone among the Argive leaders survived, saved by his horse Arion that Demeter, in the likeness of a Fury, had conceived by Poseidon. The scholiasts of the Iliad (XXIII, 347) and of Lycophron (153) attribute to him the same origin. =Pausanias= Pausanias says:Pausanias, Description of Greece 8.25.7 :\\"Demeter, they say, had by Poseidon a daughter, whose name they are not wont to divulge to the uninitiated, and a horse called Areion. For this reason they say that they were the first Arcadians to call Poseidon Horse.\\" In support of the lineage they advance, Pausanias reports, the Arcadians cite some verses from the Iliad (23.346 quoted above) and the Thebaid (an early Greek epic of uncertain authorship, of which only fragments remain). Pausanias says that \\"in the Thebaid it is said that Adrastus fled from Thebes: 'Wearing wretched clothes, and with him dark-maned Areion' \\".Pausanias, Description of Greece 8.25.8 Latin scholia assert that these verses indicate that Neptune was Arion's sire. But Pausanias goes on to quote Antimachus of Colophon as saying that Arion was a child of the Earth (Gaia):Pausanias, Description of Greece 8.25.9 :\\"Adrastus, son of Talaus, descendant of Cretheus, :The very first of the Danai to drive his famous horses, :Swift Caerus and Areion of Thelpusa, :Whom near the grove of Oncean Apollo :Earth herself sent up a marvel for mortals to see.\\" According to Pausanias, Heracles, waging war with the Eleans, acquired this horse from Oncus. The son of Zeus would have thus ridden upon Arion when he seized Elis. Thereafter, Heracles gave Arion to Adrastus; this is why Antimachus said of Arion: \\"Adrastus was the third lord who tamed him.\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 8.25.10 In popular culture * Arion appears in Rick Riordan's fantasy novel The Son of Neptune, in which he is mastered by the Roman demigod Hazel Levesque, daughter of Pluto (Hades in Greek Mythology). Hazel encounters a caged Arion in the headquarters of the Amazons in Seattle, and successfully manages to both feed and then ride him. He subsequently appears in the remaining installments of the Heroes of Olympus series. According to Percy, the horse usually 'cusses like a sailor'. * Japanese advertisements for the Mitsubishi Starion describe the name as referring to a star, and Arion. * Arion is featured in Wizard101. This version is a humanoid horse who is the son of Poseidon: Earth Shaker and the brother of Lamia. The players fight him in Atlantea within the \\"dungeon zone\\" of Aquila.

The station is owned by Jim Pattison Group. History The station's origins are actually that of an amateur radio station with the call letters 10AY owned by the Kelowna Amateur Radio Club, whose founding members in 1928 were George Dunn, Bobby Johnston, Harry Blakeborough and James William Bromley Browne. The club was formed with the sole purpose of obtaining a non-commercial radio license from the federal radio and telecommunications regulator of the day. 10AY broadcast church services, theatre shows and concert performances by the Ogopogo Concert Club. Its initial operating power was 50 watts. Two 90-foot poles were erected for antennas for the new CKOV (the call letters naturally stood for Canada Kelowna Okanagan Valley), and studios and offices were built on Mill Avenue. Browne used his own money to get the station going and then \\"sold shares\\" for $2.00 each. Okanagan Broadcasters was incorporated on July 27, 1931. On November 4, 1931, as a condition of Jim Browne being awarded a commercial radio license the non-commercial license had to be terminated and 10AY went off the air on this date. Following this, Browne flipped a switch and CKOV was born. He announced the station as, \\"This is CKOV, The Voice of the Okanagan\\". Its 60-watt transmitter was converted to 100 watts and CKOV operated on a frequency of 1230 kHz. The station continued as a community effort. Listeners sent in donations to keep the station going. Among them was hardware merchant W.A.C. Bennett, later to become Premier of British Columbia. At one of the licence renewal hearings years later, Browne was told by the regulator to \\"clean up\\" the ownership. It took him several years, and even then, they could not find some of the people who had \\"donated\\" to the resources of CKOV. In 1933, CKOV moved to 1210 kHz and decreased power to 50 watts. Following this move a year later, in 1934, the frequency changed to 630 kHz and power returned to 100 watts. It was an affiliate of the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission from 1933 to 1936 and was then an affiliate of the new Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In 1938, they purchased property on Lakeshore Road and built a new transmitter on the new site, with an increased power of 1000 watts. Okanagan Broadcasters obtained licenses for CKCQ Quesnel in 1957, CKWL Williams Lake in 1960 and CKBX 100 Mile House in 1971, which made history as Canada's first licensed private radio network. In December 1946, Okanagan Broadcasters launched a rebroadcast transmitter in Penticton. It would eventually be known as CKOK, and later CKOR. CKOV moved to new studios and offices on Pandosy Street. By this time, CKOV was a CBC Trans-Canada Network affiliate. It would remain an affiliate of TCN and its successor CBC Radio until 1977. The original CKOV building on Mill Avenue, which later became magistrate's offices, was purchased from the city in 1951 by the Kelowna Yacht Club, who continue to operate it as the clubhouse and administrative offices for the local yacht club to this day, although it has since been sold back to the city and leased on a nominal $1.00 per year rate. On June 3, 1954, Jim Browne died. His son Jim Browne Jr., a station engineer since 1931, assumed ownership of the station and had taken over management duties awhile back as his father's health had been failing for some time. In 1957, the three radio stations in the Okanagan Valley, CKOV Kelowna, CKOK Penticton and CJIB Vernon, opened CHBC-TV, which began broadcasting on September 21, covering the central Okanagan valley from its main studio in Kelowna, followed three weeks later by rebroadcast transmitters in Vernon and Penticton. Each of the radio stations had one-third ownership of CHBC-TV. Walter Gray started with CKOV and later became morning host. He went on to serve as Kelowna city councillor from 1986‚Äì90 and mayor from 1996-2005. He would also co-found CKIQ in 1970 with fellow broadcaster Bob Hall. After receiving federal broadcast regulator approval in 1964, Okanagan Broadcasters launched CJOV-FM. Several years later, CKOV received approval to increase nighttime power to 5,000 watts with daytime power remaining at 1,000 watts. Jim Browne Jr.'s son Jamie began as a full- time employee in 1968. Jamie would later own Okanagan Broadcasters before selling out to Seacoast Communications Group Inc. In June 1978, sister station CJOV-FM changed call letters to CHIM-FM. During the late 1970s, CKOV sold its one-third share in CHBC-TV equally to British Columbia Television and Selkirk Communications of Toronto. In 1981, construction began on a new studio and administrative office building at the transmitter site on Lakeshore Road, largely financed by the sale of its share of CHBC. As part of the same project, CKOV got a new solid-state AM transmitter and became an early adopter of AM stereo. Big ownership changes came in 1988 when the Browne family sold their 57-year-old CKOV and 24-year-old CHIM-FM stations to Seacoast Communications Group, which owned various radio stations on Vancouver Island including CFAX in Victoria, for an undisclosed price. The CRTC approved the transaction on August 31 of that year. There was a further windfall for both the Browne family and CKOV/Seacoast, as Jamie Browne developed and sold the land around the transmitter site as a new housing subdivision. The Browne family held part of the land, with the rest owned by Seacoast. This resulted in the relocation of CKOV's transmitter to lease land from CKIQ Kelowna at its site a couple of kilometers away. The following year, in 1989, CKOV's sister station CHIM-FM changed call letters to CKLZ-FM and rebranded itself as \\"104.7 The Lizard\\". Ten years later, in June 1998, the CRTC approved the purchase of CKOV and CKLZ by Jim Pattison Group from Seacoast. Former logo as CKOV 63 'AM' logo (circa: late 1990s - 2007) Finally, on April 23, 2007, the CRTC approved application by the Jim Pattison Group to move CKOV to the FM band at 103.1, with an effective radiated power of 11,000 watts average (35,000 watts maximum).Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2007-116 The new station said it would offer a soft vocals music format and continue with its traditional style of news and information programming, including Open Line with John Michaels, a daily current affairs show. The new FM station's music format and spoken word programming were to target Kelowna listeners in the 35-to-64-year-old age group. Although the application stated it would continue with a soft vocals and news and information format, the FM transmitter officially signed on at noon on August 17 of the same year with a country music format. The first song on B-103 was Tim McGraw's \\"I Like It, I Love It\\". The program director Bob Mills says one of the reasons for the change was that, \\"CKOV has lost money for years and I'm talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars annually, so a change had to happen.\\" As a tribute to the Browne family, which launched CKOV, the new station continued with the official CKOV call letters, but identified on air as \\"B-103\\". The AM signal was shut down on November 17, 2007 at 1 p.m. On December 16, 2008, Heather Adams announced her new co-host for the Morning Buzz program would be Troy Scott, who had recently resigned from his morning show on CHNK-FM in Winnipeg, Manitoba. On January 5, 2009 at 5:30 a.m. the Morning Buzz with Heather & Troy signed on for the first time. August 29, 2009 Heather and Troy began a Top 20 countdown show that runs twice on the weekend. For the second anniversary of B-103, the station unveiled a new updated logo of the bee wearing a white cowboy hat on b103.ca. B-103 rebranded and switched formats from a country music format to a hot adult contemporary one on February 3, 2010. Its programming officially launched at 5:30 AM, February 8, 2010. Current on-air talent includes Heather Adams and Steve Thompson in the mornings, Drew Ferreira hosts mid-days and Assistant Program Director Troy Scott moved from mornings to afternoon drive. Jim Avery, previously with CILK-FM, is still hosting on the weekends. Previous long-time hosts Dave Pears and Grant Scott are no longer with the station, with Pears retiring from a long career in Canadian radio broadcasting and Grant Scott's future uncertain.Country succumbs to the bottom line As well, the station changed its call letters from the historic CKOV-FM to CKQQ-FM on or around January 8, 2010.Changes for B103 Kelowna? As a result, CKQQ-FM is the second hot AC station in British Columbia to feature two similar letters after the \\"CK\\" on the callsign (CKZZ-FM, branded as Z 95.3 in Vancouver is the other). As of 2014, the historic \\"CKOV\\" call letters now currently belong to a radio station in Strathmore, Alberta. On October 20, 2017, CKQQ-FM flipped to variety hits branded as \\"Beach Radio 103.1\\".

Most Swedish Australians are Lutherans affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church. History A Swede may have been the first European to land in some spots on the Australian coast. Swedish botanist Daniel Solander and Britain's Sir Joseph Banks documented the flora and fauna of Australia on Captain James Cook's 1770 expedition to Australia.

Most were Lutheran and belonged to synods now associated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church, including the Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church, although a few others in the Queensland converted to Catholicism. Theologically, they were pietistic; politically, they supported progressive causes, and prohibition. A Swedish-Australian fraternal organisation was founded to help immigrants, who often lacked an adequate network of social services. Many others settled in Perth in particular as well as Canberra, Newcastle and South Australia.

Ashgate Publishing, Aldershot UK. Collaborative governance involves the government, community and private sectors communicating with each other and working together to achieve more than any one sector could achieve on its own. Ansell and Gash (2008) have explored the conditions required for effective collaborative governance. They say ‚ÄúThe ultimate goal is to develop a contingency approach of collaboration that can highlight conditions under which collaborative governance will be more or less effective as an approach to policy making and public management‚Äù Collaborative governance covers both the informal and formal relationships in problem solving and decision-making. Conventional government policy processes can be embedded in wider policy processes by facilitating collaboration between the public, private and community sectors.Bradley, Quintin. ‚ÄúA ‚ÄòPerformative‚Äô Social Movement: The Emergence of Collective Contentions within Collaborative Governance‚Äù Space and Polity. 16.2. (2012): 215-232. EBSCO. Web. 14 Oct. 2015. Collaborative Governance requires three things, namely: support; leadership; and a forum. The support identifies the policy problem to be fixed. The leadership gathers the sectors into a forum. Then, the members of the forum collaborate to develop policies, solutions and answers. There are many different forms of collaborative governance as such as Consensus Building and a Collaborative Network: * Consensus Building ‚Äì \\"A process where stakeholders build consensus on actions to address specific public policy problems; Community visioning is a process where members of a community build consensus on a descriptions of the community‚Äôs desired future and on actions to help make goals for the future a reality.\\"Bradley, Quintin. ‚ÄúA ‚ÄòPerformative‚Äô Social Movement: The Emergence of Collective Contentions within Collaborative Governance‚Äù Space and Polity. 16.2.

It‚Äôs also meant to accomplish building social capital; integration of human service delivery; and interconnected strategies for relationship building, learning processes, and measurement and modeling among the participants.‚Äù Bradley, Quintin. ‚ÄúA ‚ÄòPerformative‚Äô Social Movement: The Emergence of Collective Contentions within Collaborative Governance‚Äù Space and Polity. 16.2. (2012): 215-232. EBSCO. Web. 14 Oct. 2015. History Over the past two decades new collaborative approaches to governing and managing have developed in a range of fields, including: urban and regional planning; public administration and law; natural resource management; and environmental management. Collaborative governance has emerged as a response to the failures of government policy implementation and to the high cost and politicization of regulation and as an alternative to managerialism and adversarial approaches.Ansell, C., & Gash, A. (2008). Collaborative Governance in Theory and Practice. Retrieved October 16, 2015, from http://sites.duke.edu/niou/files/2011/05/Ansell-and-Gash The field of public administration has changed its focus from bureaucracy to that of collaboration in the context of the network society. Public administrators have blurred the lines between the people, the private sector and the government. Although bureaucracies still remain, public administrators have begun to recognize that more can potentially be achieved by collaboration and networking. Collaboration and partnerships are nothing new in the political realm, however the wider use of this leadership style has gained momentum in recent years. In part, this is a response to neoliberalism with its focus on the primacy of the free-market economy and the private sector.  Definitions  Ansell and Gash (2008) define collaborative governance as follows: > 'A governing arrangement where one or more public agencies directly engage > non-state stakeholders in a collective decision-making process that is > formal, consensus-oriented, and deliberative and that aims to make or > implement public policy or manage public programs or assets'. This definition involves six criteria:: (1) the forum is initiated by public agencies; (2) participants in the forum include non-state actors; (3) participants engage in decision making and are not merely ‚Äò‚Äòconsulted‚Äô‚Äô; (4) the forum is formally organized; (5) the forum aims to make decisions by consensus; and (6) the focus of collaboration is on public policy or public management. Emerson, Nabatchi and Balogh (2012) have developed a less normative and less restrictive definition, as follows: > 'The processes and structures of public policy decision making and > management that engage people constructively across the boundaries of public > agencies, levels of government, and/or the public, private and civic spheres > in order to carry out a public purpose that could not otherwise be > accomplished.'. This framework definition is a broader analytic concept and does not limit collaborative governance to state-initiated arrangements and to engagement between government and non-government sectors. For example, the definition encompasses collaboration between governments at different levels and hybrid partnerships initiated by the private or community sectors.  Advantages of Collaborative Governance  The intent of collaborative governance is to improve the overall practice and effectiveness of public administration. The advantages of effective collaborative governance are that it enables a better and shared understanding of complex problems involving many stakeholders and allows these stakeholders to work together and agree on solutions. It can help policy makers identify and target problems and deliver action more effectively. Stakeholders that are involved in developing a solution are more inclined to accept directions given or decisions made. It can thus serve as a way to identify policy solutions that have greater traction in the community. Additionally, it can contribute new perspectives on issues and policy solutions and thus offer new ways to implement strategies for change. For public officials who work in administration and management, collaborative governance can serve as a way of genuinely allowing a wider array of ideas and suggestions in the policy process. It may also be used to test ideas and analyze responses before implementation. For those who are not involved in formal government, it allows them to better understand the inner workings of government and carry more influence in the decision making process. It also enables them to see beyond government institutions being merely a vehicle for service delivery. They are able to feel ownership and a closer relationship to the system, further empowering them to be agents within institutional decision making.Murray, Jessica, et al. ‚ÄúEnhancing Participatory Governance and Fostering Active Citizenship: An Overview of Local and International Best Practices.‚Äù Politikon, vol. 37, no. 1, Jan. 2010, pp. 45‚Äì66. For both public and private sectors, a commitment to collaboration is likely to drive organizational change and affect resource reallocation. Other advantages include combining relevant skills and capacities, as well as allowing specialization. Overall, collaborative governance can lead to mutual learning and shared experiences, while also providing direction for institutional capacity building inside and outside agencies and organizations.  Disadvantages of Collaborative Governance  The disadvantages of collaborative governance in relation to complex problems are that the process is time consuming, it may not reach agreement on solutions, and the relevant government agencies may not implement the agreed solutions. In a complex structure with many entities working together, individual roles can become unclear and confusing. Some individuals act largely in a personal capacity, while others may act on behalf of agencies or organizations. Powerful stakeholder groups may seek to manipulate the process. Stakeholders can also begin to feel 'stakeholder fatigue', a feeling they get when they are repeatedly consulted by different agencies on similar issues. This kind of dynamic can be burdensome and time consuming.Murray, Jessica, et al. ‚ÄúEnhancing Participatory Governance and Fostering Active Citizenship: An Overview of Local and International Best Practices.‚Äù Politikon, vol. 37, no. 1, Jan. 2010, pp. 45‚Äì66. Structural issues also affect agendas and outcomes. Open structures with loose leadership and membership allow multiple participants to gain access to a fast expanding agenda. Achieving goals in such a wide agenda becomes more difficult as an increasing number of players struggle to resolve differences and coordinate actions. Furthermore, challenges arise for implementation when representatives are allowed to come and go with no real obligations to other collaborators. Accountability of participating members, unequal or hidden agendas, trust between members, power imbalances, and language and cultural barriers are all issues that can arise in collaborative government regimes. Critics argue that collaborative governance does not provide the institutional stability and consistency required, and therefore deters progress.Huxham, C., Vangen, S., Huxham, C., & Eden, C. (2000). The Challenge of Collaborative Governance. Public Management: An International Journal of Research and Theory, 2:3, 337-358 The work of Ansell and Gash (2008) and Emerson, Nabatchi and Balogh (2012) seeks to understand these issues and challenges and identify the social and process conditions required for effective collaborative governance.  Social Applications  Collaborative governance has been used to address many complex social, environmental and urban planning issues, including: flood crisis management and urban growth management in Australia; community visioning and planning in New Zealand; and public participation in the redesign of the Ground Zero site in New York. In the UK, the USA and countries across much of Western Europe, governments have attempted to shift the focus towards various forms of co-production with other agencies and sectors and with citizens themselves in order to increase civic participation.Newman, Janet; Barnes, Marian; Sullivan, Helen and Knops, Andrew (2004). Public participation and collaborative governance. Journal of Social Policy, 33(2), pp. 203‚Äì223. The classic forms of hierarchical governance and representative democracy are seen as inefficient when it comes to engaging citizens and making them a part of the decision making process. Large projects and initiatives require involvement and communication with not only citizens but partnerships with other government and non-government agencies and, in some instances, international cooperation with foreign governments and organizations. For example, managing the growing number of official and non-official crossings of the US-Mexico border has required input from all levels of US and Mexican governments, multiple government agencies (like U.S Forest Services and U.S. Border Patrol), land management, and other non-federal agencies for social affairs. All of these parties had to communicate and collaborate to address issues of border security and protecting natural resources. As a result, the U.S.Border Patrol and Forest Service successfully enacted the terms of the 2006 memorandum of understanding, creating inter-agency forums, increasing field coordination and joint operations, and constructing fences and other tactical infrastructure. Governing and managing large and growing metropolitan urban areas, covering numerous local governments and various levels of State and National governments, provides many governance challenges and opportunities. Abbott has reviewed metropolitan planning in South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia where collaborative governance arrangements, between State and local governments and the regional community, have evolved over a 20-year period leading to positive outputs and outcomes. > The positive outputs and outcomes of collaborative governance and > metropolitan planning in SEQ have been extensive and broad and extend well > beyond statutory regional land use planning. These include: three endorsed non-statutory regional plans; two endorsed statutory regional plans; an infrastructure program linked to the State budget; regional sectoral plans for transport, water supply, natural resource management, etc.; new legislation and institutional arrangements for metropolitan governance; and capital works such as the SEQ busway network.. India The Government of India launched the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program in 1975 to ensure appropriate growth and development of all children but this implementation was weak. To improve, in the city of Mumbai, they partnered up with a non-profit Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action (SNEHA), to build a child nutrition program for care and prevention of acute malnutrition. This partnership also included the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) to team up with their Nutritional Rehabilitation and Research Centre (NRRC) at Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital. The collaboration between SNEHA, a non-state actor, and ICDS and MCGM, state actors, led to what is considered the only large-scale successful program that implemented community- based approaches to identify, treat, and prevent wasting in urban informal settlements of India.

Paul A. Bloomquist (30 October 1932 ‚Äì 11 May 1972) was an American pilot and officer of the United States Army, who was the first American killed by the Red Army Faction. A veteran of the Vietnam War stationed in West Germany, Bloomquist died in a bombing attack at the IG Farben Building on 11 May 1972. Biography Paul A. Bloomquist was born on October 30, 1932, in Utah, United States. He served extensively with the United States Army during the Vietnam War, from 1964 to 1965 with the 57th Med. Det., a medical helicopter unit, and from 1968 to 1969 in the 498th Medical Company. Bloomquist received the Purple Heart three times, the Air Medal 37 times, the Distinguished Flying Cross four times, and was the 1964 \\"Army Aviator of the Year\\". After his time in Vietnam, he was appointed chief of a battalion stationed in Frankfurt, West Germany, and by 1971 was a major serving as the commanding officer of the 45th MB 3AD based in Hanau. Later that year he was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and was on assignment to the V Corps working on a drug rehabilitation program for troops. Death On 11 May 1972, Bloomquist was killed by a bombing attack on the headquarters of the V Corps in the IG Farben Building in Frankfurt. The attack was committed by the Red Army Faction, a West German far-left militant organization that targeted US military facilities and personnel in West Germany. The bombing was one of the Red Army Faction's first attacks, and was one of a series of bombings as part of the \\"May Offensive\\", and operation in retaliation for the United States' re-escalation of the Vietnam War. Posthumous awards Bloomquist was inducted into the DUSTOFF Association Hall of Fame, which honors Army Medical personnel engaged in Army aeromedical evacuation programs. The Dustoff Hall of Fame states the following: \\"LTC Paul A. Bloomquist exemplified the DUSTOFF spirit throughout his career. Spending nearly 35 months in Vietnam, he earned 4 awards of the Distinguished Flying Cross, 37 Air Medals, and 3 Purple Hearts. One DFC citation reports that even though he was wounded himself, he continued flying for nearly 13 hours during which time he rescued many casualties under heavy enemy fire. He was selected \\"Army Aviator of the Year\\" in 1964 and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce honored him as an \\"Outstanding Young American.\\" Following a battalion command in Germany, his life was cut short when a terrorist group exploded several bombs at the V Corps Headquarters in Frankfurt. In recognition of his service, the US Army installation at Ziegenberg, Germany, home of the 68th Medical Group, was renamed \\"Camp Paul Bloomquist.\\" Paul Bloomquist was inducted into the DUSTOFF Hall of Fame on 22 February 2003.\\" Bloomquist was also inducted into the Utah Aviation Hall of Fame, which is located at the Hill Aerospace Museum at Hill AFB, in 2010.

Along with slide and rhythm guitarist Dennis Robbins, bass guitarist John Fraga, and lead vocalist David Gilbert, The Rockets reached their pinnacle of success in 1979 with a Top 40 hit, a cover of the Fleetwood Mac song \\"Oh Well\\", and an appearance on the TV series The Midnight Special.  Biography  Rockets were formed in 1972 by former Mitch Ryder & The Detroit Wheels members Johnny \\"Bee\\" Badanjek and Jim McCarty. Vocals and drums were handled by Badanjek, McCarty was on lead guitar, John Fraga was on bass guitar and Marc Marcano was on keyboards. Johnny Bee was the driving force and primary songwriter for the Rockets. In the early days, Rockets paid their dues playing gigs at venues such as The Rainbow Room in Detroit, The People's Ballroom in Ann Arbor, and The Rock 'N Roll Farm in Wayne, Michigan. The band took on a new sound in 1976 when David Gilbert was brought in by new manager Gary Lazar, who also managed Detroit RCA Victor recording artist Dan Schafer, to take over vocals from Johnny Bee and Donnie Backus took over on keyboards. Gilbert had fronted several bands and was one of several lead singers that passed through the ranks of Ted Nugent and The Amboy Dukes. In 1971, he toured with them for a year and a half before forming Shadow which led to a record deal with RSO Records. Rockets made five studio albums that produced several minor hits, including a rocking rendition of Fleetwood Mac's \\"Oh Well\\", which made the Top 40. Always a popular group in Michigan, Rockets received some attention outside of the state but never became a true national act. Their first album, Love Transfusion, was released in 1977. During this period, they also opened some shows for Kiss. The album failed to produce any hits. The 1979 self-titled release featured the hits, \\"Oh Well\\" and \\"Turn Up The Radio\\". This record also featured David Hood on bass guitar, one of the \\"Swampers\\" from the famous Muscle Shoals Sound Studios in Alabama. Muscle Shoals was mentioned in Lynyrd Skynyrd's southern rock anthem \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\". The album was dedicated to Skynyrd members Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines and Cassie Gaines, who all perished in Skynyrd's infamous 1977 plane crash. Their third album (with the addition of new bass guitarist Dan Keylon) was the 1980 release No Ballads. \\"Desire\\" was a popular tune from this album. Next came the Back Talk album in 1981 (with another new bass guitarist, Bobby Haralson) and then Rocket Roll in 1982. \\"Rollin' By The Record Machine\\" from this release was the last hit for the band. Their final release, Live Rockets, was recorded on December 26 and 29, 1982, to a sold-out house at the Royal Oak Music Theatre near Detroit. This was the first time the band recorded with back-up vocalists, Shaun Murphy and Suzy Jennings, who continued to tour with them. Rockets performed their last two shows at Pine Knob near Detroit on August 28 and 29, 1983. The band members went their separate ways. Bandajek, McCarty and the rest went on to other projects. Gilbert played in several bands and learned the trade of Dryvit. He was 49 when he died of liver cancer in 2001. Dennis Robbins went on to become a solo artist signed to Giant Records in the 1990s and a multi-platinum hit songwriter, co-writing numerous country songs such as \\"Two Of A Kind (Working On A Full House)\\", \\"Get Me To The Church On Cumberland Road\\", \\"Do You Love Me (Just Say Yes)\\", \\"Too Much Month At The End Of The Money\\", and more. Bobby Neil Haralson died in the 1990s. John Fraga, bassist, born July 1, 1941, died September 27, 2010, at 69. Reunion and assumed breakup On April 16, 2010, Rockets were honored at the Detroit Music Awards with the Distinguished Achievement Award. Two former members of the Rockets (Jim McCarty and Johnny ‚ÄúBee‚Äù Badanjek) performed that night with their current band, The Hell Drivers. Shortly after that performance, and after receiving numerous requests from fans who attended The Hell Drivers local club shows for songs from The Rockets, the band decide that it was time revitalize the name, \\"Rockets\\". On July 2, 2010, Rockets played their first official reunion show at the Stars and Stripes festival in Mt. Clemens, Michigan in front of 10,000 fans. On August 21, 2010, Rockets played their second reunion show opening up for The J Geils Band at the DTE Energy Music Theater. After opening for their old tour mates, comments made in several publications around town touted Rockets / J. Geils show as the \\"best of the summer\\". On October 1, 2011, it was announced on Rockets Facebook page that Jim McCarty had decided to quit the band (though no official reason was stated at the time as to why, it was revealed later on that he decided to rejoin the band Cactus full-time), thus ending the existence of the band and any possibility of Rockets recording and releasing any new material. On April 14, 2013, the message \\"We're not done yet\\" was posted on their Facebook page. On May 29, 2013 it was announced on Facebook that Rockets were currently rehearsing heavily with new members for a bigger, badder, better sound and working up a whole bunch of new songs. Though no official line-up had been confirmed, it appeared as if the 2011 'break-up' had become a hiatus. On November 23, 2013, the first studio release in 30 years, a four-song EP was made available on iTunes. On June 28, 2014, Rockets played at the Trenton Street Fair in Trenton, MI. In August 2014, Rockets played their last gig. On September 17, 2015, it was stated on their official Facebook Page in reply to the status of the band that there are no definitive plans to continue with the current line-up. After a period of inactivity, it was announced that Rockets would be opening for Eddie Money on July 28, 2017. Although no official word has yet surfaced that the band is back playing on a regular basis.

KG) was a motor coach manufacturer based in Heilbronn, Germany. The company operated between 1920 and 2005 and was known for the production of touring coaches. History The business was founded 1 July 1920Die Geschichte der Firma Volvo Busse Deutschland by Gotthard Dr√∂gm√∂ller from Mecklenburg. Originally the Dr√∂gm√∂llers were built on a Mercedes-Benz chassis, but in 1965 the firm started to build complete vehicles, following the pattern established more than a decade earlier by Ulm-based Setra. Dr√∂gm√∂ller gained market exposure by producing touring coaches with so called theatre or panorama seating: these vehicles featured an interior floor that incorporated a slight downward slope from the back to the front of the vehicle, which improved forward vision for passengers. Volumes remained modest, however: during the 1980s the firm was producing around 90 vehicles per year with a workforce of approximately 320. In the 1990s the lucrative German market for touring coaches was dominated by Mercedes-Benz, Setra and Neoplan, and it was presumably in the hope of gaining a more significant share of the German market that in 1994 Volvo took a stake in Dr√∂gm√∂ller: in 1995 they acquired the business outright. In 2001 a new model with Dr√∂gm√∂ller-style theatre seating, the Volvo 9900, was introduced: nevertheless, the closure of the plant in 2005 suggests that Volvo's ambitions for their acquisition were not fully realised. The Heilbronn plant remained Volvo's German headquarters for buses until 2010, when the administration moved to Ismaning near Munich and the used buses department to Lohfelden near Kassel.

Starting the development in 1992, the first new coach was the Volvo B12-500, inheriting the characteristics of the E320 EuroPullman, with the backward leaning windscreen from the recent Comets. The B12 part of the name coming from the Volvo B12 chassis that it was built on. It was joined by the Volvo B12-500H, which was a little taller. Quite similar-looking, the easiest way to tell them apart is the middle door touching the side windows on the B12-500, while there is a little gap on the B12-500H. Also over the front door there is a window on the B12-500H, while there isn't on the B12-500. For 1999 the B12-500H received a facelift replacing the old rectangular row of headlights with new round ones, looking quite similar to those on the B10-400. It is unknown how long the B12-500 stayed in production, but it seem not to have reached the facelift. =Volvo B12-600= The second new Volvo coach was the Volvo B12-600 in 1995, a successor to the E330H EuroComet, it too being built on the B12 chassis. Unlike its predecessors, it was only available as a 12-metre two-axle coach, but with the well known theatre seating, it still sold well. Like with the B12-500H, it received a facelift for 1999. =Volvo B10-400= Dr√∂gm√∂ller didn't only produce pure touring coaches. In 1997 they introduced the Volvo B10-400, an intercity bus based on the Carrus Vega developed in Finland. As the name suggests, it was not built on the B12, but on the B10B and B10M chassis. The B10-400 was available in at least three different versions:1997 Volvo B10-400 K860 K1040 M-NFH Bus Brochure German Walter Miller Auto Truck Literature (eBay) (Visited 20 January 2015) B10-400 K/860,Volvo B 10-400 K/860 Volvo Busse Deutschland (Archived 9 March 2000) B10-400 K/1040Volvo B 10-400 K/1040 Volvo Busse Deutschland (Archived 9 March 2000) and B10-400 M/NFH.Volvo B 10-400 M/NFH Volvo Busse Deutschland (Archived 9 March 2000) The K/860 and the K/1040 were based on the B10B and the numbers represent their floor height in millimetres. The K/860 had double middle door (1-2-0), while the K/1040 only had a single middle door (1-1-0). The M/NFH was based on the B10M and had a low-floor bay at the rear end, with a double rear door and no middle door (1-0-2). There was also a B10B-based B10-400 IC,Volvo B10-400 IC Volvo Busse Deutschland (Archived 9 March 2000) but except from allowing more standing passengers, little is known about its characteristics. The Vega was also available from Poland under the name Volvo 7250, from 2000 also available on the B7R chassis. It is possible that some buses sold as B10-400 were built in Poland. In 2001, the B10-400 was replaced by the Volvo 8700, built in Poland and Finland. =Volvo 9900= The Volvo 9900 launched in 2001 was the successor to the B12-600, now being a model built on the B12B chassis, entirely after Volvo's specifications. It once again became available as a tri-axle like the old E430 SuperComet. The 9900 being the only product manufactured by Dr√∂gm√∂ller since 2001, sales were apparently not high enough for continued production in Heilbronn, so Volvo closed down the plant in 2005 and later moved the production to Poland.

The Act legalised prostitution and put the women involved under police and medical control. Not only was \\"sin\\" made official but poor women were badly treated. No other campaign groups dealing with the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts were as successful or held as much significance for women as the Ladies National Association. However, the LNA was not only concerned with the CD Acts; they were involved in other important social and political issues as well. They had the unanimous support of a Royal Commission in 1871, and by years of lobbying convinced Parliament to suspend the Acts in 1883 and repeal them in 1886, thus ending legalised prostitution. Background Parliament in the 1860s in the Contagious Diseases Acts (\\"CD\\") adopted the French system of licensed prostitution. The \\"regulationist policy\\" was to isolate, segregate, and control prostitution. The main goal was to protect working men, soldiers and sailors near ports and army bases from catching sexually transmitted infections, then known as venereal disease. The Ladies National Association was established in 1869 in response to the Contagious Diseases Act. Mary Priestman was the secretary and her sister Margaret Tanner was the secretary. Women were not allowed to join the original official repeal group, the National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Act. By 1871 the LNA had fifty-seven branches and 811 subscribing members, and as part of their effort for the campaign had published more than 520 pamphlets regarding the issue. A sympathetic MP commented to Butler: This comment illustrates how unique the movement was for the time. The Ladies National Association was the first politically focused campaign to be organised and led entirely by women, and in that way its members were pioneers for the rights of women. They were also one of the first such movements to be successful: the Contagious Diseases Acts were repealed in 1886. Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts The Contagious Diseases Act was a law passed by Parliament in 1864. It was replaced by Acts of 1866 and 1869 giving even more powers to the police, and covering additional districts. It caused demand not only for extension of the acts to the rest of the country, but also for the repeal of the acts. LNA defended prostitutes, saying that they were the victims of social injustice, not criminal miscreants. On 1 January 1870 the LNA published an article named \\"Women‚Äôs Protest\\" in the Daily News; this article gave a detailed explanation of what exactly the Ladies National Association felt was unjust and unlawful about these acts: Many influential women of the time associated themselves with this article, such as Florence Nightingale, Harriet Martineau, Mary Carpenter and many figures known in the literary and philosophical world. This article printed in the Daily News points out exactly what angered the LNA: the double standards of men, the fact that only women (even though men were also responsible for the spread of venereal disease) were subjected to humiliating medical examinations, that if they were found to be infected they would be contained in lock hospitals for treatment, and that if women refused to comply with the police they could face imprisonment regardless of any possible financial, economic, social and emotional impact on the woman or her family. Butler toured Britain in 1870, travelling 3,700 miles to attend 99 meetings in the course of the year. She focused her attention on working-class family men, the majority of whom were outraged at the description Butler gave of the examination women were forced to undergo; she called the process surgical or steel rape. The LNA faced confrontation not only from their rival group the Association for Promoting the Extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts who were campaigning for the extension of the contagious diseases acts, but by society in general. Many people were appalled by her frank manner in describing sexual matters and police brutality; it drew a lot of negative attention from newspaper editors and columnists, many of whom felt it was inappropriate for a woman to behave in such manner. An example of the condemnation can be seen by an article written by Dr. Preston on 24 June: However, her actions made her a heroine among other writers, particularly suffragist pamphleteers who admired her work and continuous effort for the repeal of the acts. International Efforts Anna Maria, Margaret Tanner (Treasurer) and Mary Priestman (secretary) Butler and the rest of the Ladies National Association not only concentrated their efforts within Britain. In May 1886, Butler wrote to the Priestman sisters about turning the LNA into an organisation for the colonies because the Contagious Diseases Acts were still in effect there, though they had been repealed at home. There was similar legislation in various European countries and similar provisions were enacted in India under the British Raj in 1897. The LNA took these legislations just as seriously as the acts in Britain and actively started campaigning for their repeal as well. Butler spent many years traveling between countries trying to rally support for her cause as well as holding numerous meetings in Britain. In May 1887 Butler told Sentinel readers that Other Campaigns Not only did the LNA concern themselves with the Contagious Diseases Acts, they also contributed to other women's rights campaigns of the time. For example, the LNA and some of its individual members were involved throughout the suffrage movement and their campaign for the women's vote.

Formed in 1978, the trio was composed of McClain, Delores Marie \\"D'Marie\\" Warren, and Robyrda Stiger. They signed to Polydor Records in the year of their formation and Frank Wilson produced their debut set. It was released as a self-titled album early in 1979 but then was repackaged under the title It Must Be Love several months later. The title track was released as a single and charted, but the second album did not sell well. The group was dropped less than a year after its release and they split in 1981. McClain later married producer Skip Scarborough and continued working in the music industry. Alton McClain continued recording as a gospel singer, releasing albums God's Woman in 1995 and Renaissance in 2005. Robyrda Stiger and D'Marie Warren signed with Epic Records as a part of the girl group Krystol . The group also included singer-songwriters Tina Scott and Karon Floyd- who would later be replaced by Robbie Danzie, due to Floyd going on maternity leave by the release of their second album Talk of the Town. Krystol's first two albums were produced by former SOLAR Records in-house producer Leon Sylvers III. Founding member D'Marie Warren who was born May 30, 1951 died in a car crash on February 22, 1985 at age 33, before Talk of the Town was released.

A first prototype of the motorcycle was introduced to the public at the Paris Motor Show in October 1982. The XLV was initially intended for the European market only (with the exception of the UK), but from 1985 on, it was also sold in Australia and New Zealand. In the first production run in 1983, 500 \\"Limited Edition\\"-models were produced for the Japanese home market. The \\"Limited Edition\\"-models can be identified by a golden metal badge attached to the right side of the auxiliary frame (below the seat) and are otherwise, except for the perforated front brake disc and the blue strap on the seat, identical to the standard model. Honda had intended the XLV to be a tourer with limited off-road capabilities. It is therefore hard to understand why Honda presented the motorbike to the press on a motocross track (on the island of Ibiza, Spain, in the spring of 1983). In the early 1980s, most dual-sport motorcycles had only one cylinder and weighed about 120 to 150 kilos - compared to them, the XLV with its 220 kilos (fully fueled) seemed to be unfit for sporty off-road driving. At the launch, several journalists crashed the heavy bike on the motocross track, for which it was entirely unsuited. The XLV750R (Honda type designation: RD01) was Honda's first dual-sport motorcycle with two non-parallel cylinders. It has an air-/oil-cooled V-twin engine with hydraulic valve tappets and a shaft drive. Those two construction features make the XLV a very low maintenance motorcycle. Other technical highlights at the time of introduction were the dry sump lubrication system (with the main frame acting as an oil tank, helping to lower engine temperatures), the three valves per cylinder (two inlet valves / one exhaust valve), the two spark plugs per cylinder, and the crankshaft with off-set pins. Honda XLV750R(D) The distinctive air scoops mounted below the fuel tank on either side of the motorbike provide additional cooling for the rear cylinder. They were only installed after tests of prototype models revealed thermal problems of the engine. Initially the XLV was offered in the aggressive colours of the Honda Racing Corporation (HRC), namely blue, white, and red, with a red engine, red fork rods and red hubs. This model bears the additional designation \\"D\\". Honda XLV750R(F) In 1985, a revised version of the XLV750R was introduced, bearing the additional designation \\"F\\". The XLV750R(F)-models were improved in some details (tamer cams resulting in 6 hp less power, improved automatic cam chain tensioners, improved carburetor setup, among other minor modifications) and had a black engine and golden rims with black hubs. These motorcycles were painted in the colour combinations black/blue metallic, black/red metallic and black/silver grey and were mainly marketed in Italy, France, and Australia. Honda never officially offered them in Germany, probably because the demand was very low due to the mainly negative press the XLV had received there.Leicht, pp. 34, 37Griep, p. 64 In 1986, the production of the XLV750R (RD01) was discontinued. Officially, the RD-genealogy was continued with the solely chain driven models NX650 Dominator (RD02 and RD 08), XRV650/750 Africa Twin (RD03, RD04, RD07), XR650L (RD06), SLR650/FX650 Vigor (RD09), XL650V/XL700V Transalp (RD10, RD11, RD13) and FMX650 (RD12). The type designation \\"RD05\\" was not assigned.

In January 1992, a suit filed by Baldwin's wife Deborah, claiming the window net had allowed her husband's head to strike the wall, was decided in favor of NASCAR, which was cleared of negligence by a 12-person state district court jury.

Han was detained for much of his ministry for his loyalty to the Vatican as opposed to the Chinese government-controlled Roman Catholic Church. Early life Han Dingxiang was born on May 17, 1937 in Hebei province in northern China. In 1960, Han was sentenced to and served 19 years in a Chinese labor camp during the rule of Mao Zedong. It is not known whether his sentence was related to religious activity. Catholic Church Han was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1986. He was elevated by the Vatican to the Bishop of Yongnian Diocese in 1989 just three years later. Han recognized the pope as head of the Chinese Catholic Church, not the government in Beijing. The Chinese government requires that all members of Christian denominations register and worship in state sponsored churches. By law, Christians of all denominations must worship in state-registered churches. Chinese Catholics, such as Han, who recognize the Pope in Rome as head of the Church must worship in underground churches, often called house churches. The Chinese government allows Chinese Catholics to recognize the Pope in Rome as a spiritual leader. However, the government rejects the notion that the Vatican alone has the authority to appoint bishops. The Chinese government often appoints its own bishops to its state controlled Catholic Church. Bishops appointed secretly by the Vatican must practice underground or risk detention and arrest. Han Dingxiang was detained on eleven separate occasions during his tenure as Bishop of Yongnian. Han last arrest took place in November 1999. Han was reportedly caught leading a religious retreat for Catholic nuns in Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei. Han was still under house arrest or other forms of detention stemming from his 1999 arrest at the time of death in 2007. He had served over eight years and had been kept in several locations, including a housing complex for Chinese police and their families. Han Dingxiang died on September 9, 2007 at a hospital in China while still in police custody. He was being treated for an undisclosed illness, which was reportedly lung cancer. His family had only recently been notified about his poor health. Han was reportedly cremated and buried just six hours after his death. The Cardinal Kung Foundation, a Catholic monitoring group based in the United States, urged the Vatican to investigate Han's death.

It is one of five songs on the album that Dylan initially recorded in New York City in September 1974 and then re-recorded in Minneapolis in December that year. The later recording, made on December 30, 1974, became the album track (and single). The complete New York recording sessions of \\"If You See Her, Say Hello\\" was released on the deluxe edition of The Bootleg Series Vol. 14: More Blood, More Tracks in 2018, with the first take of the song, recorded on September 16, 1974, also included on the single-CD and 2-LP versions of that album. The second take of the song, from the same September 16 session, had been released in 1991 on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1‚Äì3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961‚Äì1991. The deluxe version of The Bootleg Series Vol. 14 also included a remix of the December 1974 master issued on Blood on the Tracks. The song describes an anonymous lost love, with whom the singer had \\"a falling-out\\" and broke up. As the song goes on, the narrator tells in a very honest and melancholic tone how hard is his struggle with the issue of their separation, but he makes it clear that \\"she still lives inside of him\\", so they've never been apart. In the final verse, he says that his old lover can see him if she's ever coming back again. Covers and alternative versions There is an Italian version by singer Francesco De Gregori, called \\"Non Dirle Che Non √à Cos√¨\\". Jeff Buckley covered the song in a live performance on his album Live at Sin-√©. The Brazilian singer Renato Russo covered the song changing the title and lyrics to \\"If you see him, say hello\\". Dylan has performed alternate versions of the song in concert. His 1976 Lakeland, Florida performance has different lyrics for every verse. References in popular culture Bob Geldof used the title as the opening line to his composition \\"A Gospel Song\\" from his 1990 album The Vegetarians of Love. It is mentioned by David Duchovny's character Hank Moody at the end of episode five of the Showtime series Californication, describing the album as a \\"classic heartbreak album\\" and begins to sing the opening verse of the song to his daughter, Becca. In an interview with The Guardian, Ricky Gervais mentioned the song as the last he ever played while working at Xfm. He also named Blood on the Tracks as his favorite album. The song is played in the closing scene of the 19th episode, \\"Vesuvius\\" in the 9th season of How I Met Your Mother.

Later George Chandler, Glen LeFleur, Cliff Lake and Delisle Harper were included whilst simultaneously members of Olympic Runners. Session guitarist Cliff Lake went on to appeared with other artists such as Doris Troy, Edwin Starr, Chris Rea etc. and is said to be poised to make a comeback as a singer songwriter. Vocalist Lenny Zakatek joined in 1974 and they released their first album Gonzalez (1974), which featured a heavy funk sound. This album was Queen's bassist John Deacon favourite band in the mid 1970s. Our Only Weapon is Our Music (1975) followed, released on EMI's sister label, Capitol.

A remix of the same song reached No. 7 on the US Club Play chart and No. 15 in the UK Singles Chart. The band's third and fourth albums, Shipwrecked and Move It to the Music, were produced by Jones. Eve, Lake and Hunte left before their single \\"Ain't No Way to Treat a Lady\\" (1979) was released. In 1980 and after five years with the band Lenny Zakatek left to sing vocals with The Alan Parsons Project. The band's follow- up singles and their fifth album Watch Your Step, were not successful and the group lost its major label status.

These bears have gone on tour around the world in Shanghai, Buenos Aires and St Gallen, Switzerland.Singapore-Germany ties: \\"What are Buddy Bears?\\" United Buddy Bears In Berlin 2002, the idea was born to motivate as many countries acknowledged by the United Nations as possible to select an artist - with the result that as of today, more than 148 artists have designed a large, -tall Buddy Bear. Each bear is an artistic expression of the individual country. These bears are placed next to each other in a large circle - generally in alphabetical order - as a unique synthesis of the arts. One important prerequisite for this international unifying project is to choose artists from the individual countries - for the circle to reflect the diversity of the cultures of \\"one world\\". The observer learns about the culture, the history, the people and the landscape of the individual countries - large or small. Hence the United Buddy Bears circle has become a platform for even the smallest and poorest countries which frequently remain unnoticed. Suddenly, they are equal to larger and often rich nations.

It was founded in 1986 by activists from around the world. Along the Amazon river, Brazil. WRM believes that this goal can only be achieved by fighting for social and ecological justice, by respecting the collective rights of traditional communities and the right to self-determination of peoples who depend on the forests for their livelihoods. For this reason, WRM‚Äôs actions are oriented to support the struggles of indigenous peoples and peasant communities in defence of their territories. WRM‚Äôs International Secretariat is composed of a small team with members from different countries. The head office is in Uruguay.  Main Areas of Work  * Expansion of monoculture tree plantations for the production of timber, cellulose, palm oil, rubber or biomass. Industrial tree plantations pose a major threat to communities beyond tropical forest areas. * Impacts of corporations that extract timber, minerals, water and fossil fuels from forest territories, and of the infrastructure that supports this exploitation. * Initiatives that are presented as ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù but in fact only exacerbate forest loss and climate change. These include certification of forest management concessions, monoculture tree plantations, carbon offsets, environmental compensation programmes, among others. * New trends related to corporate tactics and national and international policies that facilitate the appropriation of community forests. * Local struggles and resistance strategies of movements, organisations and communities in the defence of their territories and forests. * The differentiated impacts that women face when their lands are encroached and appropriated: sexual violence, harassment, persecution and deprivation of livelihood, among others. Activities =Mutual learning and support for community struggles = * Visiting communities that are struggling against the destruction of their forests for tree plantations and other corporate projects, to exchange experiences and to jointly decide on forms of support. * Supporting meetings elaborated collectively with people from communities, organisations and social movements on the causes of forest destruction, global trends, threats and local resistance. * Promoting exchanges between activists and organisations that resist against similar threats to their livelihoods. * Creating spaces of trust and political connection to strengthen communities‚Äô struggles. * Showing solidarity with local and community struggles, based on demands presented by the organisations, communities and activists involved. = Production and dissemination of information and analyses = * Participating in debates and international campaigns to give visibility to community struggles and to expose the private and state tactics of land grabbing. * Producing analyses and exposing violations ‚Äì in local and international spaces ‚Äì on the impacts of false solutions to the destruction of forests and climate change for communities. * Producing analyses about new trends and international policies related to climate and biodiversity with forest dwellers threatened by these initiatives. * Facilitating the flow of information among groups in different regions of the world, for example with translations of texts, petitions and action alerts into local languages. * Publishing the WRM bulletin, an e-newsletter, since 1997. It exposes struggles, threats and resistance in forests, as well as false policy solutions at international and local level. Articles are written by activists and organizations from all over the world. The bulletin is distributed to more than 10,000 individuals and organizations in 131 countries around the world. * Producing diverse materials for activists and communities on specific topics. * Maintaining an online library with WRM materials since 1996, available in Spanish, French, English and Portuguese.

When Skye expresses concern about May's approach to dealing with Hutchins, Coulson explains that May has experience in dealing with superhumans, relating some details of a mission in Bahrain in 2008, in which May single-handedly took out a superhuman threat and several accomplices, saving a team of SHIELD agents, though a young girl was killed in the crossfire. Left traumatized by the experience, May withdrew from field duty. A series of strange occurrences around the Bus cause the team to realize that Hutchins is not causing the telekinetic incidents: one of the workers, Tobias Ford, attempted to sabotage the accelerator after making numerous complaints to Hutchins because he wanted her to notice him. The socially incapable Ford thought it was the only way to get her attention, and after being trapped in a partially-corporeal state by the explosion he caused, in limbo between Earth and another dimension (which he describes as \\"Hell\\"), he has been using his new abilities to 'protect' Hutchins. Ford cuts the plane's power, and it crashes in a field. When Fitz and Simmons try to make repairs, Ford locks up everyone except May, demanding that Hutchins be released to him. May takes Hutchins and escapes into a nearby forest until Ford corners them in a barn. May fights Ford until Hutchins talks him down, and May convinces him to let go of Hannah, at which point he dissipates. Hutchins is later put into witness protection. In an end tag May pulls a prank on Fitz, revealing that her trauma is gradually healing.

Though the name 'Ayyavazhi' is commonly used and the most accepted term to represent Ayyavazhi there are other terms too which are used to refer it. Ayyavazhi The exact origin of the name Ayyavazhi is not known. The various theories on its derivation include: ;Ayya's path: from the direct synonymous derivation, which takes Ayya as a noun (naming word) of Ayya Vaikundar.R.Shanmugam's, Narayana Kulatthil Narayanar Avataram, Page:188 ;Path of Father: from the local spoken-Tamil language Ayya (father) and vazhi (path).

The synonymous versions of the phrase are virtually unlimited, because the usage of the word 'Ayya' in Tamil varies widely. It is used to convey the words father, guru, the superior, a person of dignity, respectable one, master, the king, the teacher, preceptor, etc. The word 'vazhi' in Tamil can mean the way, a course of conduct, manner, method, mode, cause, antiquity, succession, religious system, reason, and so on. As Muttukuttyism This was a name given to Ayyavazhi during the late 19th century by the London Missionary Society Missionaries who is of negative views over Vaikundar. So they pour hatred on both Vaikundar and the belief centering him. They, however, recognise Ayyavazhi as an alternate religious phenomenon against or outside Hinduism. They referred to Ayyavazhi as Muttukutyism, being mistaken that Muttukutty is the one who believed as a god-incarnate by the followers.

MDA is not directly used to perform classification. It merely supports classification by yielding a compressed signal amenable to classification. The method described in Duda et al. (2001) ¬ß3.8.3 projects the multivariate signal down to an M‚àí1 dimensional space where M is the number of categories. MDA is useful because most classifiers are strongly affected by the curse of dimensionality. In other words, when signals are represented in very-high-dimensional spaces, the classifier's performance is catastrophically impaired by the overfitting problem. This problem is reduced by compressing the signal down to a lower- dimensional space as MDA does. MDA has been used to reveal neural codes.Lin L et al.

He is remembered as one of the ablest administrators in the history of the Swedish navy, and is in many ways a typical example of the type of aristocrat who served the Swedish Crown during the period of Sweden's imperial expansion. Biography He was the son of Lars Hermansson Fleming, the governor of √Öbo in present-day Finland. He was born at Askainen in Finland and began his military career in the army, as a cornet in the Field Marshal's Guards Company. In 1620 he began his naval service as a vice admiral and rear admiral, and served as the commander of a number of squadrons and fleets in the following years. He was away from Sweden with the navy for most of the campaigning seasons in the 1620s, but returned to Stockholm in the winters. Admirals were also administrative officers, and Fleming became a central figure in the administration of naval procurement. When the office of holmamiral, the official responsible for managing the state dockyard and arsenal in Stockholm, fell open in 1625, it was not filled for six years, but Fleming essentially fulfilled the duties of the office. During this period the dockyard was not under direct Crown control but was leased by private entrepreneurs, Henrik Hybertsson and Arendt de Groote. They built the large warship Vasa, which sank on its maiden voyage on 10 August 1628. Fleming had been involved in the negotiations of the original contract and in maintaining Crown control over the entrepreneurs, and was present at a demonstration of the ship's lack of stability about a month before the ship sailed. In the 1630s, Fleming went to sea less and took on a variety of civil administrative tasks. He presided over the Crown's accounting office and was a member of the Royal Council. From 1634 until his death he was the first governor-general of Stockholm, an office created under the Form of Government instituted in that year. As part of his duties he was involved in the planning of the city of Stockholm and the moving of the navy's dockyard from its original home on what is now Blasieholmen to the island of Skeppsholmen, which remained the main Stockholm naval base until the later 20th century. He was instrumental in organizing the expedition to establish the Swedish colony in North America, New Sweden, in modern Delaware, in 1637. He was also an industrialist, and in the 1630s established an ironworks at Vira, which produced weaponry for the Swedish armies in the Thirty Years War. The ironworks still exists, as a museum of 17th-century technology. He returned to a major sea command in 1644, during the Torstenson War with Denmark-Norway. He commanded the ships sent to attack the Danish fleet and land troops on the southern Danish coast, and on 1 July, directed the Swedish forces in the Battle of Kolberger Heide, in which the Danish fleet prevented the Swedish landing. He was killed in action several weeks later, on 27 July 1644, on board his flagship, Scepter, near Kiel. Personal life Son of Lars Hermansson Fleming & Anna Henriksdotter Horn af Kanckas. Grandson of Admiral Herman Persson Fleming (ca. 1520‚Äì1583) and Governor-General Henrik Klasson Horn (c.1512‚Äì1595). Married to Anna G√∂ransdotter Snakenborg. Father of Admiral Herman Claesson Fleming af Liebelitz (1619‚Äì1673) and Lars Claesson Fleming af Liebelitz (1621-1699) who served as Chamberlain for Christina, Queen of Sweden.

She was a granddaughter of Gustavus von Tempsky. Armine Von Tempski's autobiographies and novels were based on her early life among the Hawaiian cowboys (paniolos) on the Haleakala cattle ranch atop the HaleakalƒÅ shield volcano. The Haleakala Ranch, which Jack London first visited in 1907, was his favourite of the Hawaiian ranches he enjoyed on several extended visits with his wife Charmian. The young Armine, then sixteen years old, asked London to read some of her stories and give his opinion. He said that they were \\"clumsy, incoherent tripe\\" but added that \\"every so often there's a streak of fire on your pages,\\" which encouraged her. Her first published writing, in the early 1920s, was about efforts to restore the island of Kahoolawe after years of drought and overgrazing.  Personal life  She married California real estate agent Alfred Lathrop Ball on December 25, 1932, in Ventura County, California. They were friends of poet Don Blanding, who illustrated von Tempski's book, Ripe Breadfruit (New York: Dodd, Mead and Company, 1935).

History Ancient Greeks generally had a single name, often qualified with a patronymic, a clan or tribe, or a place of origin. Married women were identified by the name of their husbands, not their fathers. Hereditary family names or surnames began to be used by elites in the Byzantine period. Well into the 9th century, they were rare. But by the 11th and 12th centuries, elite families often used family names.Alexander P. Kazhdan, Michael McCormick, \\"Social Composition of the Byzantine Court\\", in Henry Maguire, ed., Byzantine Court Culture from 829 to 1204, 2004, , p. 168 Family names came from placenames, nicknames, or occupations.Patrick Hanks, Richard Coates, Peter McClure, The Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland, 2016, , p. lii It is not clear when stable family surnames became widely used. Though elite families often had stable family names, many of the \\"last names\\" used by Greeks into the 19th century were either patronymics or nicknames. It is also possible that family names were simply not recorded because Ottoman administrative practice preferred patronymics, and did not require surnames.Hamish Forbes, \\"Early modern Greece: liquid landscapes and fluid populations\\" Hesperia Supplements 40: 111-135 (2007) In the 19th century, patronymic surnames became common. For personal names, from the first century CE until the nineteenth century CE, pagan names from antiquity were mostly replaced by names from Christian scriptures and tradition. With the Modern Greek Enlightenment and the development of Greek nationalism, names from antiquity became popular again. citePeter Mackridge, Language and National Identity in Greece, 1766-1976, Oxford, 2009, p. 21}} Family names may be patronymic in origin or else based on occupation, location, or personal characteristic. These origins are often indicated by prefixes or suffixes. Traditionally a woman used a feminine version of her father's family name, replacing it with a feminine version of her husband's family name on marriage. In modern Greece, a woman keeps her father's family name for life but may use a husband's name. In official documents in modern Greece, people are given three names: a given name, a patronymic and a family name. Given names Until the late 18th century, almost all Christian Greeks were named for Orthodox saints from the Old and New Testaments and early Christian tradition. Since then, names of both deities and mortals from antiquity have been popular as well. Male names usually end in -Œ±œÇ, -Œ∑œÇ, and -ŒøœÇ, but sometimes ancient forms are also used. Female names almost always end in -Œ± and -Œ∑, though a few end in -œé with -ŒøœÖ being possible. Since antiquity, there has been a strong tradition of naming the first son after the paternal grandfather and the second after the maternal grandfather.\\"Naming practices\\" in British Academy and Oxford University, Lexicon of Greek Personal Names, online This results in a continuation of names in the family line. There is a strong clustering of first names by locality according to patron saints, famous churches or monasteries. Examples include: * Spyridon and Spyridoula in Corfu, * Gerasimos in Kefalonia, * Dionysia and Dionysios in Zakynthos, * Andreas and Andriana in Patras, * Markella and Markos in Chios * Savvas among families from Asia Minor, * Emmanuel or Manolis, Joseph or Sifis, Manousos, and Minas in Crete. * Tsambikos or Tsampika/Mika in Rhodes. When Greek names are used in other languages, they are sometimes rendered phonetically, such as Eleni for ·ºôŒªŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑, and sometimes by their equivalents, like Helen in English or H√©l√®ne in French. In the United States, there are also conventional anglicizations based on phonetic similarity rather than etymology, for example James or Jimmy for ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒÆœÑœÅŒ∑œÇ/Dimitris (nickname ŒùœÑŒØŒºŒ∑œÇ/Dimi, hence Jimmy), when the English name James is a derivative of ·º∏Œ¨Œ∫œâŒ≤ŒøœÇ/ Iakovos.  Family names Greek family names are most commonly patronymics but may also be based on occupation, personal characteristics or location. The feminine version is usually the genitive of the family name of the woman's father or husband; so, for example, Mr. Yannatos and Mrs. Yannatou. As a result of their codification in the Modern Greek state, surnames have Katharevousa forms even though Katharevousa is no longer the official standard. Thus, the Ancient Greek name Eleutherios forms the Modern Greek proper name Lefteris. In the past, people in speaking used the family name followed by the given name, so John Eleutherios was called Leftero-giannis. In modern practice he is called Giannis Eleftheriou, where Giannis is the popular form of the formal Ioannis but Eleftheriou is an archaic genitive. For women the surname is usually a Katharevousa genitive of a male name, whereas back in Byzantine times there were separate feminine forms of male surnames, such as Palaiolog√≠na for Palaiol√≥gos which nowadays would be Palaiol√≥gou. In the past, women would change their surname on first marrying to that of their husband in the genitive case, so marking the change of dependence to husband from father. In early Modern Greek society, women were named with -aina as a feminine suffix on the husband's given name, for example \\"Giorgaina\\" signifying \\"wife of George\\". Nowadays, a woman's surname does not change upon marriage but she can use the husband's surname socially. Children usually receive the paternal surname, though some children receive the maternal surname in addition or exclusively. In official documents, the father's name in the genitive will be inserted between a person's first and last names. For example, if John Papadopoulos has a daughter named Mary and a son named Andrew, they will be referred to as Mar√≠a Io√°nnou Papadopo√∫lou and Andr√©as Io√°nnou Papad√≥poulos. If Mary then marries George Demetri√°des, she may retain her original name or choose to be called Mar√≠a Ge≈çrg√≠ou Demetri√°dou. If she is widowed, she will revert to her father's patronymic but retain her husband's surname to become Mar√≠a Io√°nnou Demetri√°dou.

Early life Born in Sydney, Jones is an only child. He is the son of Russell Jones, a quantity surveyor, and Donna Jones, a teacher‚Äôs aide. He competed in the Sydney GPS Schools tennis competition representing the Shore school, before eventually forgoing his school education to pursue his tennis career. Jones competed in a number of high-profile events throughout his junior career including all four of the junior grand slams, most notably making the final of the 2007 French Open. In 2007, Jones, having reached the finals of the junior event at the French Open, a semifinal at Wimbledon and a quarterfinal finish at the Australian Open, was very hopeful for a win at the last US Open Junior event, which was his last match in the International Tennis Federation Junior Competition. Jones had a Junior career high ranking of 4 and won 191 out of 219 matches. Professional career Jones began playing professional tournaments in 2006. In his fourth ever professional event he made the final of the Burnie challenger in Tasmania, before spending time overseas in future events in an attempt to improve his ranking. Jones finished 2007 ranked 386, given his youth and ranking he was given wildcards into the 2008 Adelaide International qualifying draw, the 2008 Medibank International (which was his first ATP Tour main draw eventJones learns a lifetime of lessons in 75 minutes)and the 2008 Australian Open qualifying draw. The highlight of 2008 for Jones was winning his first futures title in USA and he finished the year ranked 434. 2009 saw Jones compete in all the Australian ATP events again in January, but he was unable to qualify for any of the main draw in either Brisbane, Sydney or the Australian Open. Jones won his second future tournament of his career in April 2009 in Australia, before heading overseas to play in both Challengers and Futures tournaments, which was highlighted by a Challenger semifinal in Russia. 2010 started slowly for Jones, who once again was unable to qualify for Brisbane, Sydney or the Australian Open. In February he was able to make a second finals appearance at the challenger tournament in Burnie, going down to rising star Bernard Tomic in the final, Jones continued his good form with a finals showing in an Australian futures tournament two weeks later. On 10 October 2010, Jones won silver for Australia in the Men's Tennis in the Commonwealth Games 2010 at Delhi, losing to India's Somdev Devvarman in the gold medal match played at the R.K.

History Boreas The palace was built about 1680, probably to Tylman van Gameren's design, for the high official and royal secretary Stanis≈Çaw Kleinpolt. The palace was subsequently sold in 1685 to Jan Dobrogost Krasi≈Ñski, in 1698 to Andrzej Chryzostom Za≈Çuski, and in the early 18th century to the Bishop of P≈Çock, Andrzej Stanis≈Çaw Kostka Za≈Çuski. From the 1730s the proprietor was Franciszek Maksymilian Ossoli≈Ñski, and later Micha≈Ç Kazimierz (\\"Rybe≈Ñko\\") Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, who reconstructed the palace in the rococo style, probably to a design by Johann Sigmund Deybel. The magnificent sculptures of the Four Winds (Notus, Boreas, Zephyrus and Eurus) atop the fence posts date from that period. The artist is unknown, but probably also participated in decorating the Saxon Garden. In 1769‚Äì71 the palace was rebuilt by Szymon Bogumi≈Ç Zug for Piotr Tepper. The right wing was widened, and a new annex was erected adjacent to ulica D≈Çuga, with an early-classicist front elevation. In 1801 the palace was purchased at auction by Karol Fryderyk D√ºckert. Until 1891 it belonged to his heirs. In 1808‚Äì1914 it served as an elegant hotel, the H√¥tel de Dresde (Dresden Hotel). After World War I the palace fell into decline, becoming a tenement house. In 1927 it was purchased by the Polish Treasury, restored, and made the seat of the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare. In 1944 the palace was deliberately burned by the Germans after they had suppressed the Warsaw Uprising.

It is located 6 miles east of Great Barford Castle and 9 miles east of Bedford Castle. History Though called a castle, it was in truth a motte and bailey fortified manor house with a manorial complex, built by the Normans in the late 12th, or early 13th, century. It was built as a rectangular ward, enclosed by a moat, with a rampart. The small motte, located in the north-east section of the ward, is believed to have been the site of a beacon or timber tower. There is belief that the castle was built on the site of a 10th-century Danish Viking fort. This belief is because the Danish Vikings, who had landed in East Anglia in 865, participated in a battle at Tempsford in 921, on the possible location upon which Gannocks castle was later built, although this is conjectural. Present There is still some evidence of the castle, in the form of earthworks, and the moat still remains. Currently, the site is owned by Central Bedfordshire Council. The site is a Scheduled Monument, protected by law. A geophysical survey of the castle site and adjoining playing field was organised by the Friends of Gannock Castle and carried out on 29 June 2004, by geophysical engineers, in the form of a Resistivity and Magnetometer survey. A second geophysical survey of the surrounding fields to the west and south of the site was organised by the Friends of Gannocks Castle, and carried out on 1 December 2006, by geophysical engineers, in the form of a Fluxgate Gradiometer survey. Restoration Restoration of Gannocks Castle was begun in 1998, with an opening day Medieval fair on 19 June 2006. The local Member of Parliament, Mr Alistair Burt MP, was a guest speaker. The fair featured a medieval re-enactment group, as well as wandering minstrels and dancers. Numerous stalls were set up, with demonstrations of crafts, archery, and medieval combat. Additional improvements to the site include the installation of benches and bird/bat boxes; restoration of a wildflower area; tree and scrub management; installation of an interpretation board and creation of a 'Heritage' trail leaflet. The Heritage Trail leaflet can be downloaded from the Tempsford websites below. A causeway was built across the Gannocks Castle moat, which is wet throughout the year, to allow greater access to the site. The causeway was not dug into the site, allowing it to be removed at a future date with no damage to the site. The site contained extensive scrub which was cleared by the Friends of Gannocks Castle, Tempsford villagers and the Ivel & Ouse Countryside Project volunteers. Specialists were used when required. The wood was logged, dried, and used as fire wood by local villagers. Smaller cuttings were mulched and spread across the site. The site is freely accessible in daylight hours. Car parking is by the side of Church Road, Tempsford and the site is signposted from the road.

He initially worked for the Otago Witness before going to Auckland for two years. He moved to Invercargill at the beginning of 1861. Together with George Smallfield, he founded Invercargill's first newspaper, the Southland News and Foveaux Straits Herald, and its first edition was published on 14 February 1861. The paper later became the Southland Daily News and existed until 1967, when it was bought by the rival The Southland Times. Bain founded the Mataura Paper Mill in 1875. He was a significant businessman in Invercargill, was president of the Southland Building Society for the first 30 years of its existence.

The hypothesis began with Carl Linnaeus in 1758, and was again advanced by J.D. Smith in 1980. It was proposed in its modern form by Australian neuroscientist Jack Pettigrew in 1986 after he discovered that the connections between the retina and the superior colliculus (a region of the midbrain) in the megabat Pteropus were organized in the same way found in primates, and purportedly different from all other mammals. This was followed up by a longer study published in 1989, in which this was supported by the analysis of many other brain and body characteristics. Pettigrew suggested that flying foxes, colugos, and primates were all descendants of the same group of early arboreal mammals. The megabat flight and the colugo gliding could be both seen as locomotory adaptations to a life high above the ground. The flying primate hypothesis met resistance from many zoologists. Its biggest challenges were not centered on the argument that megabats and primates are evolutionarily related, which reflects earlier ideas (such as the grouping of primates, tree shrews, colugos, and bats under the same taxonomic group, the Superorder Archonta). Rather, many biologists resisted the implication that megabats and microbats (or echolocating bats) formed distinct branches of mammalian evolution, with flight having evolved twice. This implication was borne out of the fact that microbats do not resemble primates in any of the neural characteristics studied by Pettigrew, instead resembling primitive mammals such as Insectivora in these respects. The advanced brain characters demonstrated in Pteropus could not, therefore, be generalized to imply that all bats are similar to primates. More recently, the flying primate hypothesis was soundly rejected when scientists compared the DNA of bats to that of primates. These genetic studies support the monophyly of bats. Neurological studies Soon after Pettigrew's study, work on another genus of megabat (Rousettus) disputed the existence of an advanced pattern of connections between the retina and the superior colliculus. However, this conclusion was later criticised on methodological grounds. Later studies have sought further evidence of unique characteristics linking the megabat and primate brains. These studies have had limited success in identifying unique links between megabats and present-day primates, instead concluding that the megabat brain has characteristics that may resemble those likely to have existed in primitive primate brains. Nonetheless, modern neuroanatomical studies have repeatedly supported the existence of very significant differences between the brains of megabats and microbats, which is one of the anchors of the \\"flying primate\\" hypothesis. Biochemical studies The implication that bats are diphyletic has been fiercely disputed by many zoologists, not only based on the unlikelihood that wings would have evolved twice in mammals, but also on biochemical studies of molecular evolution, which indicate that bats are monophyletic. However, other studies have disputed the validity of these conclusions. In particular, Pettigrew argued incorrectly that phylogenies based solely on DNA data can be subject to an artifact named the \\"base- compositional bias\\" Further studies did not find base-compositional bias sufficient to discount support for the monophyly of bats.

Meadows was Henry Moore's first assistant; then part of the Geometry of Fear school, a loose-knit group of British sculptors whose prominence was established at the 1952 Venice Biennale; a Professor of Sculpture at the Royal College of Art for 20 years; and returned to assist Moore again in his last years.Peter Davies, Independent Obituaries, 17 January 2005 Early life Meadows was born in Norwich, and educated at the City of Norwich School, After briefly training as an accountant in 1931, he attended Norwich School of Art and then in 1936 became Henry Moore's first assistant at his studio in Kent. He participated in the first Surrealist exhibition in London in 1936. He lived in Chalk Farm from 1937, assisting Moore in his studio at Hampstead, and studied at the Royal College of Art (although his first application was rejected, due to his association with Moore) and at the Courtauld Institute. In the Second World War, he initially registered as a conscientious objector, but when Nazi Germany invaded the USSR in 1941, he withdrew his objection. He was called up to the Royal Air Force and worked in air-sea rescue, serving for a time the Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean, where he was inspired by the large crabs. Career He returned to Moore's studio after the war, and helped Moore with his marble sculpture Three Standing Figures 1947 and his 1949 bronze Family Group. He went on to find acclaim. An elm figure was exhibited in the open air sculpture exhibition at Battersea Park in 1951, alongside the Festival of Britain, which went to the Tate Gallery.Bernard Meadows, Standing Figure, 1951, Tate Gallery He exhibited in the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale a year later, alongside a new generation of British sculptors, including Anthony Caro, Lynn Chadwick and Eduardo Paolozzi. Their angular artworks contrasted with the more rounded styles of their seniors, Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth, and they were dubbed by art critic Herbert Read as the \\"Geometry of Fear\\". He held his first solo exhibition at Gimpel Fils in 1957, with four more in the decade to 1967. He also exhibited at the S√£o Paulo Biennale in 1957, Documenta 2 in Kassel in 1959, and the 1964 Venice Biennale. He exhibited from New York City to Tokyo and produced a stream of public and private art in Britain and beyond. His edgy pieces often based on animals and seemingly carved from shrapnel could imply Cold War menace. Meadows' work titled Public Sculpture, a controversial assembly of stone blocks and balls of dripping and dimpled metal, was commissioned for the Eastern Daily Press in 1968 at Prospect House, Norwich.Eastern Daily Press news item Retrieved 19 May 2011 The sculpture is on permanent display outside the building together with prints and drawings in the Prospect House foyer. Also on display an illustrated panel telling the story of Bernard Meadows and Public Sculpture. Teaching commitments took precedence over his own work. He taught at the Royal College of Art from 1948, and was Professor of Sculpture from 1960 to 1980, where his students included Robert Clatworthy and Elisabeth Frink. He was a member of the Fine Arts Commission from 1971 to 1976. He returned to assist Moore at Perry Green, Hertfordshire from 1977, after Moore's health started to fail, and continued to help his mentor's estate after Moore's death in 1986, becoming an acting director of the Henry Moore Foundation. The Yorkshire Sculpture Park held a retrospective exhibition of Meadows‚Äô work for his 80th birthday in 1995, with a second retrospective at Gimpel Fils in London, the first exhibitions of his works for 15 years.

Early life and family Courtney was born in Christchurch on 2 October 1943, the son of Clifford Francis and Joyce Elizabeth Courtney. He grew up in the suburb of Spreydon, and was educated at Christchurch Technical College. He studied business administration and trained in the grocery industry before moving to Nelson. In 1968, Courtney married his wife, Wendy, and the couple went on to have three children. National politics Courtney represented the Nelson electorate from 1976 to 1981 and was opposition spokesman for horticulture and fisheries for five years. He was a recipient of both the Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977 for service to the community and the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal in recognition of services to New Zealand. Courtney is currently in his fifth term on the Nelson City Council. =Independent= In March 1981 Courtney announced that he had let his membership of the Labour Party lapse. Soon after, he withdrew from the Labour Party caucus and sat in the New Zealand House of Representatives as an independent. The Labour Party suffered defeats in the 1975, 1978 and 1981 general elections under the leadership of Bill Rowling. Courtney saw the momentum that had been gained under the Prime Ministership of the charismatic Labour leader Norman Kirk (1972‚Äì74) was being eroded and lost by Rowling. Courtney firmly believed that change was needed in the leadership in order to beat Robert Muldoon and the National Party. Rowling was not an effective counter to Muldoon: in Parliament Muldoon had the measure of Rowling and Rowling was perceived as weak in the media. After Courtney's strong performance in the Nelson by-election in 1976 the 1978 Labour Party general election result was a \\"major disappointment\\" for Courtney (Henderson, 1981). In the December 1980 leadership vote of confidence Courtney voted against Rowling. Rowling clung onto the Labour leadership by one vote-his own (Bassett, 2008). Courtney's announcement of his independent candidacy for the 1981 general election was made only a few days before the 35th anniversary of the death of Harry Atmore, MP for Nelson from 1911 to 1946. Atmore had been the last independent MP to be elected to the New Zealand Parliament. =1981 election= At the 1981 election supporters rallied around Courtney's Independent campaign and, although defeated, it was by the very narrow margin of 698 votes. Courtney took 37.0 per cent of the total vote, 3.4 percentage points behind the Labour candidate, and nearly three times as many votes as the National candidate's share of the vote. This was the best result by an independent candidate in New Zealand elections in nearly 40 years. Local politics Courtney was an elected member of Nelson City Council for six years during the 1970s under Mayor Roy McLennan; for some of that time, he was also a Member of Parliament. He had a three-year gap and then became a member of the city council for another three-year term under Mayor Peter Malone. Courtney came out of political retirement for the 2016 local elections. Of the 12 successful candidates, Courtney was elected with 6,743 votes. Courtney was re-elected with 8,601 votes in the 2019 local elections. Outside politics Courtney owned and operated supermarkets in Nelson and at its peak, he had five of them. He retired to Australia in about 2000. He returned to live in Nelson in late 2014 or early 2015.

Biography Before the 2007 World Cup Barbieri played 54 games for Australia. At 1.68m tall, her height has been questioned by the media in her position at goalkeeper, although has aptly proven herself as a shot-stopper. She played for Richmond SC, becoming the first female to play in the Australian semi-professional men's league. After gaining experience in the men's league, Barbieri made her debut in goals for the Matildas in September 2002 in a 1‚Äì0 win against Canada. In 2008, she was approached by the US football team, the Boston Renegades. However, the Boston management eventually pursued this no further for the remainder of the season, due to Barbieri's commitments to the Australian national team. She signed for Melbourne Victory for the inaugural season of the Westfield W-League. Barbieri won the Goalkeeper of the year award in that season. She was a scholarship holder with the Victorian Institute of Sport. On 19 February 2010, Barbieri was named captain of the Matildas following the 2009 retirement of Cheryl Salisbury. In June 2011, Barbieri was on the cover of the Australian FourFourTwo Magazine along with fellow Matilda's Thea Slatyer, Sam Kerr, Kyah Simon and Sarah Walsh. Barbieri had her first child, a girl, in 2013. In May 2015 national coach Alen Stajcic surprisingly axed Brianna Davey from Australia's 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup squad, a decision criticised in many quarters, recalling resurgent veteran Barbieri for her fourth World Cup. In July 2016, Barbieri signed a deal to play one game as a guest for Taroona in the Tasmanian Women's Super League. Barbieri was appointed coach of Heidelberg United's women's team in October 2016. In November 2017, she came out of retirement to join Melbourne City on an injury replacement contract, after one of their goalkeepers Emily Shields broke her wrist. In July 2018, Barbieri was appointed as an assistant coach of the Melbourne City W-League team.

B. microti is responsible for the disease babesiosis, a malaria-like disease which also causes fever and hemolysis. Life cycle The life cycle of B. microti includes human red blood cells and is an important transfusion-transmitted infectious organism. Between 2010 and 2014 it caused four out of fifteen (27%) fatalities associated with transfusion-transmitted microbial infections reported to the US FDA (the highest of any single organism). In 2018, the FDA approved an antibody-based screening test for blood and organ donors. An important difference from malaria is that B. microti does not infect liver cells. Additionally, the piroplasm is spread by tick bites (Ixodes scapularis, the same tick that spreads Lyme disease), while the malaria protozoans are spread via mosquito. Finally, under the microscope, the merozoite form of the B. microti lifecycle in red blood cells forms a cross-shaped structure, often referred to as a \\"Maltese cross\\" or tetrad, in addition to intracellular \\"ring forms\\" which are also seen in the malaria parasite (Plasmodium spp.). Taxonomy Until 2006 B. microti was thought to belong to the genus Babesia, as Babesia microti, until ribosomal RNA comparisons placed it in the sister genus Theileria. , the medical community still classified the parasite as Babesia microti though its genome showed it does not belong to either Babesia or Theileria. Genomics The genome of Babesia microti has been sequenced and published. The mitochondrial genome is circular.

He was the 22nd Vice-Chancellor of the University of Adelaide, from January 2018 through July 2020. He was previously the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania from 2011 to 2017. Biography Born in the United Kingdom, Rathjen moved to South Australia in 1965 when he was a child. He was educated at Blackwood High School in Adelaide. He studied Science at the University of Adelaide, majoring in biochemistry and genetics, and completing an honours degree. Rathjen was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to New College, Oxford in 1985 where he continued research into certain plant pathogens called viroids and their association with RNA behaviour. He was awarded a DPhil in 1987, and then worked as a postdoctoral researcher on embryonic stem cells from 1988 to 1990. Rathjen returned to the University of Adelaide, where he worked as Lecturer in Biochemistry from 1990 to 1995 and Professor in Biochemistry from 1995 to 2006. He was appointed to the Chair of Biochemistry in 1995. He became Head of the Department of Molecular Biosciences in 2000, and became Foundation Executive Dean of the Faculty of Sciences in 2002, a role he kept until 2005. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of Melbourne in 2006; in 2008, he became Dean of the Graduate School of Science, and from 2008 to 2011 he served as Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research). He was involved in Melbourne's controversial program of 'focused excellence', that shed some staff positions in order to reduce a growing debt. In April 2011 Rathjen took up the role of Vice-Chancellor at the University of Tasmania. During his vice- chancellorship, he promoted the University as a driver of socio-economic prosperity in Tasmania, including plans to move University of Tasmania campuses into CBD districts in Burnie, Launceston (yet to be completed), and Hobart (yet to be completed). During his vice-chancellorship, the university launched new associate degree programs. However, controversies during Rathjen's vice-chancellorship included the use of university funds for what was perceived as \\"travelling the globe in style\\", spending $50,000 in less than 6 months. In August 2020, a freedom of information request from the ABC revealed Rathjen spent more than $277 thousand on business travel over four years during his tenure as Vice-Chancellor. His wife, Joy Rathjen, also a University of Tasmania employee, accompanied him on nine of the business class trips, costing the University $57,083. In 2018, Rathjen returned to the University of Adelaide in the roles of Vice-Chancellor and President, in succession to Mike Brooks. In May 2020, Rathjen commenced an indefinite leave of absence after University of Adelaide Chancellor Kevin Scarce resigned without public explanation the previous day. Later in the week, the Independent Commissioner Against Corruption (ICAC) confirmed he was investigating allegations of improper conduct by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Adelaide. Rathjen, accused of engaging in \\"a personal relationship with a staff member\\", was succeeded by Acting Vice-Chancellor Mike Brooks. Rathjen formally resigned in July 2020, \\"due to ill health\\". In August 2020, the ICAC found that Rathjen had committed \\"serious misconduct\\" by sexually harassing two University of Adelaide colleagues, had lied to the then Chancellor Kevin Scarce, and also lied to the Commissioner in his evidence with respect to an investigation of sexual misconduct with a postgraduate student when he was employed at the University of Melbourne. The ICAC Commissioner Bruce Lander acknowledged there were \\"further issues\\" in the full 170 page report on the investigation which he chose not to release due to privacy concerns surrounding the victims, instead releasing an abridged 12 page version ‚ÄòStatement about an Investigation: Misconduct by the Vice- Chancellor of the University of Adelaide‚Äô. In determining his findings, the Commissioner relied in part on the personal blog of US journalist Michael Balter who documented Rathjen's prior history of sexual harassment, and was largely responsible for bringing the matter to the public's attention, and ultimately ICAC's. The ICAC Commissioner's damning findings against Rathjen have put the University of Adelaide's culture under intense scrutiny in both the local and international media.

Early life and career He was born in Dunedin on 19 May 1935, the son of Roderick MacDonell. He received his education at Christian Brothers High School, since renamed Kavanagh College. He became active with the labour movement in 1950. In 1958, he married Joan Banwell, the daughter of William Banwell. The MacDonells have four sons. MacDonell worked for a bank from 1953 to 1963, and was a national councillor for the New Zealand bank officers union. Political career MacDonell first attempted to enter politics at the 1959 local-body elections when he stood unsuccessfully for the Dunedin City Council on the Labour Party ticket. He stood for the council again in 1962 and was likewise unsuccessful. He represented the Dunedin Central electorate in Parliament for 21 years from to 1984. He was Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister of Trade and Industry (1973‚Äì1975) and to the Minister of Energy Resources (1974‚Äì1975). Following the Royal Commission on Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion, parliament discussed legislation to legalise abortion, and MacDonell supported his pro-life stance by holding a jar with a pickled 12-week-old foetus during the debate. Parliament passed the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977. MacDonell was Shadow Minister of Customs and Shadow Postmaster- General from 1975 to 1983 under Bill Rowling. The Dunedin Central electorate was abolished in the 1983 electoral redistribution, and the electorate of Dunedin West was established in its place. MacDonell was not selected as the Labour candidate for the new electorate of Dunedin West; instead, the party's president, Jim Anderton, installed his personal friend Clive Matthewson. MacDonell stood as an Independent in the 1984 general election but was not successful. MacDonell was later elected a member of the Dunedin City Council at the 1995 local-body elections representing the South Dunedin ward for three years. Later activities MacDonell now resides in Tasmania, Australia. He enjoys fishing for recreation. Honours and awards In 1977, MacDonell was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal, and in 1990 he received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.

Education The village once had two schools, but due to the lack of children from the village itself and the surrounding villages only one of the schools is still used. The other is now the Boys' Brigade. Manifold Primary School (still in use as the secondary school until the early 1980s) caters mainly for children between the ages of 4 to 9, however they do also have a nursery department which caters to pre-school children. On occasion the school will allow for a group of children to stay at the school for an extra two years, as opposed to going straight to a secondary school. The two main schools which the pupils will attend after leaving are: Churnet View Middle School and Saint Edward's Middle School, both located in Leek). Religion The village has two chapels and one church. The church of St Lawrence has an unusually wide chancel and windows by William Morris. Of the two chapels, one has been converted into a house and the other is in the process of being converted. Springs There are numerous fresh water springs located within the village and at one time this water was bottled and sold. The water can still be drunk or obtained freely from these sources. Buildings The village has a single public house, The Greyhound (formerly known as The Greyhound and Hare), which dates back to around 1750.

Wilhelm B√∂lsche (2 January 1861, Cologne, Rhenish Prussia, 31 August 1939, Schreiberhau, Riesengebirge) was a German author, editor and publicist. Life B√∂lsche was born in Cologne on 2 January 1861, son of journalist Carl B√∂lsche (March 16, 1813 - April 14, 1891) long-time editor of the K√∂lnische Zeitung.http://www.geisteswissenschaften.fu- berlin.de/we04/germanistik/faecher/ndl/forschung/boelsche/projekt/index.html As a secondary school student, B√∂lsche wrote essays on natural history for magazines such as \\"Die Gefiederte Welt\\" or \\"Isis\\". He studied from 1883 to 1885 philosophy, art history and archaeology at the University of Bonn. He did not complete studies of classical philology in Bonn, but in their course he traveled to Rome and Florence, then to Paris.Ibid. Deciding that he could make writing his career, he moved to Berlin in the fall of 1886, financially supported by his parents.Ibid. In Berlin-Friedrichshagen he became a central figure in the \\"Friedrichshagener Dichterkreis‚Äú, which was an association of writers of naturalism, holding their first meetings in 1888/89 in the houses of Wilhelm B√∂lsche and Bruno Wille in Friedrichshagen am M√ºggelsee (now in the Berlin district of Treptow-K√∂penick). This circle of friends would visit Erkner, where they sought the tranquility of the Brandenburg landscape near the cosmopolitan city of Berlin. The group became known enough for several Scandinavians to join it. The goal of this group of literati and intellectuals who settled around 1890 in Friedrichshagen, like of may other groups of that type sprouting up at that time, was social reform (German: Lebensreform) that promoted a bohemian, \\"natural\\" way of life as a response to industrialization and urbanization, a world view of life reform basically containing a secularized Gnostic-eschatological salvation doctrine (salvation through a \\"natural way of life\\")Wolfgang R.

Nevertheless, his publishing of \\"Das Liebesleben in der Natur‚Äú (The Love Life in Nature) in 1898 was the key for creating modern fact books in Germany. Boelsche also initiated with Wilhelm Schwaner (18631944) a prequel of the first German folk high school, the ‚ÄúFreie Hochschule Berlin‚Äù in 1902 and was an important instigator for the ‚ÄúLebensreformbewegung‚Äù (Humanistic naturalism ‚Äì key note: ‚ÄúBack to Nature‚Äù) in Germany. In 1890 he and Bruno Wille founded the \\"Freie Volksb√ºhne\\", which was intended as a workers' theater promoting the naturalist plays of the day. He also edited the most important cultural history review of the day, \\"Freie B√ºhne‚Äú (Free Stage) and popularized his free-thinking monism knowledge - especially the innovating school of Charles Darwin and Ernst Haeckel in dozens of self-edited books and series released by Kosmos-Verlag in Stuttgart collaborating with the Berlin artist Heinrich Harder. His friendship with the Hauptmann brothers, Gerhart Hauptmann and Carl, brought B√∂lsche to Schreiberhau in the Riesengebirge mountains, where he would spend the summer regularly, starting in 1901, making his permanent residence there in 1918. He continued to devote himself to his literary work and his extensive correspondence until old age. Personal life Wilhelm B√∂lsche was first married in Berlin in 1892 to Adele Bertelt (1860-1942), but they divorced in 1895. He remarried in 1897 in Cologne to Johanna Walther (1863-1923), a childhood friend (sister of architect Julius Wilhelm Walther, daughter of civil engineer and later factory manager Wilhelm Heinrich Walther and Augusta Alwina te Kloot).https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz5042.html:de:Wilhelm Walther (Architekt) The couple had three children: Ernst Wilhelm Julius (1898-1899), Karl Erich Bruno (1899-1977) and Johanna Alwine Elisabeth (1900‚Äì35). Wilhelm B√∂lsche died in Schreiberhau on August 31, 1939. He was interred at the evangelical cemetery of Nieder-Schreiberhau in Dept. F 3 next to his wife Johanna.http://www.szklarskaporeba.pl/images/articles/original/2124_1351698141.jpg Honours As a compliment to his work, Boelsche was the name giver to a mountain ridge in the \\"Riesengebirge‚Äú (Karkonosze Mountains), to a Berlin school (Realschule B√∂lsche ‚Äì Oberschule), and to many streets in German towns, including the \\"B√∂lschestrasse‚Äú in his former living district Berlin- Friedrichshagen.

In May 1998, a caesium-137 source managed to pass through the monitoring equipment in an Acerinox scrap metal reprocessing plant in Los Barrios, Spain. When melted, the caesium-137 caused the release of a radioactive cloud. The Acerinox chimney detectors failed to detect it, but it was eventually detected in France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and Austria.

He was Member of Parliament for Nelson from 1981 to 1990 and Mayor of Nelson from 1992 to 1998.New Zealand Who's Who 1991 and 2001 Early life and family Woollaston was born in Motueka to New Zealand artist Sir Mountford Tosswill Woollaston and Edith Winifred Alexander. He is married with two children. Woollaston attended Greymouth Main Primary School and Cobden Primary School. While his parents were overseas he attended St Andrew's College in Christchurch (1958‚Äì62) as a boarder.St Andrews College 1916-1966, History and School List He graduated from the University of Canterbury with a Bachelor of Science in physics (1971) and Christchurch Teachers' College with a Diploma in Teaching (1971).  Teaching career  Woollaston taught at Linwood High School (1972‚Äì74), lectured at the University of Canterbury (1975), and taught at both Collingwood District High School (1976‚Äì77) and Collingwood Area School (1977‚Äì80) before embarking on a political career. In 1974, Woollaston was awarded the Rutherford Trophy for Demonstrations in Physics by the New Zealand Institute of Physics, for his demonstration of linear dynamics.  Political career  Woollaston joined the New Zealand Labour Party in 1975. He was Secretary of the Labour Party Policy Council from 1982 to 1984. He was a Golden Bay County Councillor and on the Nelson Regional Airport Authority from 1977 to 1980. Woollaston was also on the Nelson Bays United Council and No 11 District Roads Board from 1979 to 1980. Woollaston stood for the Nelson electorate in 1981, defeating incumbent MP Mel Courtney. During his time in Parliament he was Associate Minister for the Environment (1987‚Äì89), Associate Minister of Justice (1987‚Äì90), Minister assisting the Deputy Prime Minister (1988‚Äì90), Minister of Conservation (1989‚Äì90), and Minister of Local Government (1990). Woollaston was a junior Minister in the controversial Fourth Labour Governments of David Lange & Geoffrey Palmer but never sought at the time (through resignation or public opposition) to distance himself from the Rogernomics policies of that era. In 1990 Woollaston retired from Parliament and was replaced as MP for Nelson by John Blincoe. On 6 December 1990, he was granted the title \\"The Honourable\\" for life, in recognition of his services as a member of the Executive Council.Roll of the Honourables. Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Retrieved 10 August 2013. In 1991 he became Policy Advisor to the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme in Nairobi, Kenya for two years.  Mayor  Following his return to New Zealand, Woollaston stood for and became Mayor of Nelson from 1992 to 1998. He was defeated by Paul Matheson in 1998.  Mahana (formerly Woollaston) Estates Winery in Receivership & Glenn Schaeffer  In 1993 Woollaston developed a small vineyard in the Waimea Plains near Nelson with his wife Chan. Originally intended as a retirement hobby, the winery grew into a full-time business when the Woollastons entered into a partnership with American couple, Glenn and (his former wife) Renee Schaeffer, purchasing an apple orchard at Mahana near Nelson. Originally the winery was called Woollaston Estates but in 2015 it changed its name to Mahana Estates. Glenn Schaeffer made headlines in 2009 when the US company he co- founded and headed (Fontainebleau Resorts) filed for bankruptcy. It had been developing the USD$2.9 billion Fontainebleau Las Vegas, a 68-storey 3889 room hotel, condominium and casino (now The Drew Las Vegas, which remains unfinished as of 2020). Woollaston retired from his position as managing director of the winery in 2009. In July 2018, the Mahana Estates Winery was put up sale and in September it was put into receivership. In December 2018 the High Court of New Zealand found that Schaeffer had made false representations to Las Vegas investors that they were purchasing a share in the winery and vineyard when in fact he had never transferred his interest in the business to the limited partnership and had continued to deal with the assets as if they were his own. Schaeffer was ordered to repay NZ$3.3 million to the investors. In June 2020, Schaeffer's appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.

It is endemic to Queensland in north-eastern Australia. It was formerly included in the white- rumped swiftlet (Aerodramus spodiopygius) but is now commonly treated as a separate species. It has two subspecies which are occasionally regarded as two separate species: A. t. terraereginae and A. t. chillagoensis (Chillagoe swiftlet). Description It is 11-12 centimetres long with a wing length of 107‚Äì118.2 millimetres and a weight of 10.5-12.5 grams. The upperparts are dark grey-brown while the underparts are a uniform greyish. There are pale feathers on the forehead and lores. The rump is normally pale greyish but can occasionally be darker. The tail is slightly forked. The form chillagoensis is smaller and paler with a weight of around 9.39 grams. It has a high-pitched flight call. In its breeding caves, it utters a metallic clicking call, used for echolocation. Distribution A. t. terraereginae occurs in tropical north-east Queensland from the Claudie River on the Cape York Peninsula south as far as the Eungella Range near Mackay. It is mainly found near the coast including a number of offshore islands. It occurs up to 1000 metres above sea- level but is commonest below 500 metres. A. t. chillagoensis is found further inland in the area around Chillagoe, west of the Great Dividing Range. Ecology Breeding occurs from July to March. The species breeds in colonies which can contain hundreds of individuals. These are located in caves or sometimes amongst boulders. The nest is attached to the walls or ceiling of the cave, 2‚Äì20 metres above the ground. It is translucent and basket-shaped and made from saliva mixed with grasses, casuarina needles, twigs and feathers. Two clutches are laid during the breeding season, each consisting of a single white egg. The egg is incubated by both parents for about 26.5 days. Incubation of the second egg is aided by warmth from the first chick. The young bird remains in the nest for about 46‚Äì51 days after hatching. The Australian swiftlet feeds in flight, preying on insects and drifting spiders. It forages in flocks over rainforest edges, savanna, pastures, beaches and gorges. It generally feeds within 30 kilometres of the breeding colony, leaving the nest for periods of about 30 minutes to hunt.

On 31 December 1813, she captured the French letter of marque brig Jason which became . Jason, of 264 tons (bm), was pierced for 22 guns but carried 14, 12 of which she had thrown overboard when Venerable chased her. She had left Bordeaux five days earlier and was sailing for New York with a cargo of silks, wines, and other articles of merchandise. There were 64 people on board, ten of whom were passengers. She was on her maiden voyage, copper-bottomed, and sailed so well, Captain Worth took her under protection, intending to go to Barbados.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 31, p.254-5. Venerable was Admiral Durham's flagship when on 16 January 1814, Venerable and her prize Jason, were in company with . Cyane spotted two 44-gun French frigates, and and signaled to Venerable. Venerable joined her and after a chase that left Cyane far behind, captured Alcm√®ne, though not without a fight. Venerable lost two men dead and four wounded, while the French lost 32 dead and 50 wounded. Alcm√®ne had a complement of 319 men under the command of Captain Ducrest de Villeneuve, who was wounded when he brought her alongside Venerable and attempted a boarding. Jason and Cyane tracked Iphig√©nie and initially fired on her but broke off the engagement because they were outgunned. Cyane continued the chase for over three days until Venerable was able to rejoin the fight after having sailed 153 miles in the direction she believed that Iphig√©nie had taken. On 20 January 1814, after a 19-hour chase, or what amounted in all to a four-day chase Iphig√©nie, Venerable captured the quarry, having again left Cyane behind. In the chase, Iphig√©nie cast off her anchors and threw her boats overboard in order to try to gain speed. She had a complement of 325 men, under the command of Captain √âmeric. She apparently did not resist after Venerable came up. Before meeting up with the British ships, the two French vessels had taken some eight prizes.James & Chamier (1837), Vol. 6, pp.259-61. The action resulted in the award in 1847, to any surviving claimants, of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Venerable 16 Jany. 1814\\". Venerable was able to locate Iphig√©nie because Commander Ducrest de Villeneuve of Alcm√®ne was so angry at Captain √âmeric, who was the senior French commander, for not having come alongside Venerable on the other side also to board, that he essentially revealed the rendezvous instructions to Durham. When some prisoners from Iphig√©nies crew were brought on Venerable, crew from Alcm√®ne too were enraged. Durham had to station Royal Marines between them, with fixed bayonets, to prevent fighting from breaking out.Long (1895), p. 199. Fate Venerable was placed on harbour service in 1825, and was broken up in 1838.

EM-8ER In 2016, Kern started a project on demand of fans, called EM-8ER (pronunciation: /Àà…õm.b…ôÀê/, Em-ber), a spiritual successor to his previous game Firefall. He created a company, called Crixa Labs LLC, that will release anything related to EM-8ER, like his tabletop role-playing game Gatesriders, set within the same universe. EM-8ER is a mini massively multiplayer online game set on the planet of the same name, where players control Gatesriders, humans with technological advancements such as their MEK suits and Thumper MEK/As. They fight against an ancient alien race called Tsi-hu and their giant Kaiju. The goal of the game is build bases, terraform, mine for resources and fight invasions. The game is in its early stages, with some demo builds shown to backers, however, his team of developers are actively working on the game and the approximate time of alpha release will be known after Kickstarter.

It is relevant in One Day Internationals and Twenty20 matches. When a bowler bowls a no-ball, the immediate next ball is a free hit. Additionally, if the ball is delivered full toss above the waist the batsman receives a free hit. History It came into international cricket in October 2007. Initially only foot fault no balls resulted in a free hit. From 2015, the rules were changed so that all no balls result in a free hit. Advantage gained The opportunity afforded by a free hit ball enables the batsman to play a more powerful shot without the fear of getting out by the most common methods (caught or leg before wicket). The fault lies with the fielding side, and the advantage is to the batting side. Also, if the ball did hit the stumps, the batsman could afford to steal single runs (a bye) because the ball is normally considered a dead ball. Fielding restrictions The fielding team is not allowed to change the field for the free hit ball, if the same batsman (who received the original no-ball) is on strike. However, for safety reasons, if the wicketkeeper is standing up at the stumps he is allowed to move back to a more traditional position. If the batsmen ran an odd number of runs on the original no-ball, the other batsman is now the striker, and the field may be re-positioned for the free hit. In fact re-positioning is also allowed if the striker changes for whatever reason, for example if a new batsman replaces a striker who is run out on the original no-ball, by failing to make his ground on the second run. The field must also be re-positioned if the no-ball was called for an illegal field placement. Signal The umpire at the bowler's end signals that the next ball is a free hit by making circular movements in the air with one raised hand. The free hit is carried over to the next ball if the original free hit ball is bowled wide or a no-ball; in this case the umpire is required to signal the free hit again.

The town is an enclave and located outside the borders of Kyiv Oblast, instead fully surrounded by the nation's capital Kyiv (Svyatoshyne Raion). Population: . The settlement appeared in 1900 as a khutir Berkovets during the construction of the railroad Kyiv - Kovel (1897-1903). The khutir consisted of a single homestead which served as a residence for local forest rangers in the Bilychi Woods. The settlement belonged to the Kyiv-Podil Administration of State Property. In 1903 near the khutir was constructed a passing loop which later transformed into a train station Bilychi. The station was named after a village that was located in close vicinity (today, part of Kyiv city). On February 11, 1941 the khutir Berkovets was given a status of an urban settlement Kotsiubynske.

Murray's younger brother is former Major League Baseball outfielder Calvin Murray. High school He was an All-State quarterback at North Dallas High School and was named Dallas-Ft. Worth metroplex Offensive Player of the Year his senior season. He was also a center fielder for the North Dallas baseball team. Murray was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 11th Round (287th overall) of 1982 MLB Draft and played one season ('82) for their Pikeville rookie league team in the Appalachian League before enrolling at Texas A&M.; College Murray arrived at Texas A&M; in the fall of 1983. Against Arkansas, he threw three touchdown passes in six-minute span and finished the game off with a late fourth-quarter touchdown toss to set a freshman school record with four touchdowns in a game. By the end of the season, he had been named the Southwest Conference Newcomer of the Year as well as second-team all-conference. He finished the year as the SWC's total offense leader, averaging 165 yds per game and was the conference leader with 14 touchdown passes. On the season, he passed for 1,544 yds and 14 touchdowns with a 53% completion rate. In 1984, in the third game of his sophomore year, Murray shattered his ankle diving for a first down in a game against Arkansas State. The injury would require surgery and a year of rehabilitation. In 1985, Texas A&M; appealed to the NCAA and received a medical hardship exemption, making 1984 a redshirt year for Murray and granting him an additional year of eligibility. Murray had an outstanding 1985 season, passing for 2,463 yards then an A&M; record. A&M; beat SMU, Arkansas, and Texas in three late-season home games that were all televised by ESPN. The Aggies' 42-10 whipping of Texas to return to the Cotton Bowl Classic for the first time since 1968 made Murray a household name. For his efforts, he earned second team All-American honors from the Football News and Offensive MVP honors in the Aggies' 1986 Cotton Bowl Classic victory over Auburn and Heisman Trophy winner Bo Jackson. In the game, Murray passed for 292 yards, breaking Joe Montana's Cotton Bowl Classic record and leading the Aggies to a 36-16 win. After the season, Murray was named Offensive Player of the Year by the Associated Press, The Dallas Morning News and Houston Chronicle. Murray had a spectacular 1986 season, one in which he broke most of Texas A&M;'s passing records and became the Southwest Conference's all-time touchdown leader. He was once again named a 2nd team All-American and led the Aggies to their second consecutive top-10 finish. One of Murray's career highlights came during the 1986 Baylor game at Kyle Field, in which he rallied the Aggies from a 17-0 deficit to a 31-30 victory, completing 25-of-40 passes for 308 yards and three touchdowns and rushing for another. The game was voted the decade's best by Texas Football magazine The Aggies returned to the Cotton Bowl Classic that year to face Ohio State, but Murray's return appearance was not as successful. In what would be his final game at A&M;, Murray threw five interceptions while completing only 12 of 31 passes as the Aggies ended a great season with a frustrating defeat. He finished his Aggie career 25-6-1 as a starter, making him the winningest quarterback in Aggie history (his career wins record was later broken by Corey Pullig). On April 19, 2012, in honor of his Cotton Bowl performance, Murray was inducted into the AT&T; Cotton Bowl Classic Hall of Fame. Fellow 2012 AT&T; Cotton Bowl Classic Hall of Fame inductees included Texas linebacker/defensive back Tom Campbell, Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz, BYU middle linebacker Shay Muirbrook, and Arkansas defensive lineman Jim Williams. Professional Murray made himself eligible for the NFL draft after his junior year, but went undrafted. Although one of the nation's top orthopedic specialists cleared Murray to play in the NFL, concerns about his health and lingering issues with his ankle kept teams away. Murray had two brief professional stints, signing as a free-agent with the San Francisco 49ers and the Calgary Stampeders, but eventually retired due to the chronic ankle injury that had plagued him since his early days at Texas A&M.; Coaching Murray was serving as the high school quarterback coach at Parish Episcopal School and runs the Air 14 Quarterback Academy. Personal life Murray is married to Missy Murray. His son Kyler played quarterback in his father's footsteps at Texas A&M; before transferring to the University of Oklahoma, where he won the Heisman Trophy in 2018. Kyler went on to become the first-overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft by the Arizona Cardinals.

Since 1 January 2010, it is part of the town Oebisfelde- Weferlingen.  Geography  D√∂hren is located about two km north of Helmstedt, on the border of the Lappwald mountain range.  History  In 1910 there were 434 residents in D√∂hren. From 1994 until 1 January 2005 D√∂ren was a part of the administration partnership Weferlingen. From 2005 until 31 December 2009, a member of the administration collectivity Flechtingen. As a result of a Gebiets√§nderungsvereinbarung (an agreement to change territories) the municipal councils of Oebisfelde (on 27 May 2009), B√∂sdorf (26 May 2009), Eickendorf (28 May 2009), Etingen (26 May 2009), Kathendorf (19 May 2009), R√§tzlingen (27 May 2009), Eschenrode (28 May 2009), D√∂hren (28 May 2009), H√∂dingen (20 May 2009), H√∂rsingen (27 May 2009), Schwanefeld (25 May 2009), Seggerde (26 June 2009), Siestedt (28 May 2009), Walbeck (28 May 2009) and Flecken Werflingen (19 May 2009) agreed to dissolve their municipalities and become entwined with the town of Oebisfelde-Weferlingen. The application was accepted by the commune oversight committee and came into force on 1 January 2010. Following the application becoming law, the independent community of D√∂hren along with its constituent communities became a part of the new town of Kalbe. In the new municipality and current locality of D√∂hren, a council was formed with seven members including the local mayor.  Politics  The previous voluntary mayor Frank-Hildemar Rosburg was elected to serve from 6 May 2001 to 31 December 2009, and has since then become the local mayor. = Local Council = According to the last local elections on 7 June 2009, the municipal council had eight members. Due to the founding of Oebisfelde- Weferlingen, the municipal council automatically became the local council. The voter turnout was 44.6%. The election brought the following result: * W√§hlergruppen 6 seats (76.9%) * SPD 2 seats (23.1%) A local council with five members was elected in 2014. In addition, the local mayor is the chairman of the local council. = Crest and Flag = The coat of arms was approved on 2 March 2004 by the Magdeburg Regional Council. Blazoning: \\"In red a ringing silver bell, surrounded by two leafy silver lime branches, the right one with 10, the left one with 9 leaves, all leaves except one in the upper corners of the shield facing the bell.\\" The colours of the municipality are silver (white) and red, derived from the coat of arms motifs and shield colour. The silver bell symbolizes the 17th century hall church in the center of the rundling village of D√∂hren and the bell inside it, cast in 1508 by the famous Brunswick bell founder Henrik Mente - according to the inscription. Since the bell tower had to be demolished in 1987 due to its dilapidation, the bell remained silent for 10 years. In 1997 it was re-hung in the newly erected tower; therefore it is shown ringing. Thirdly, the bell represents the connection of the community with the Mariental Monastery. Like the courtyards of the roundabout around the church, the two lime branches nestle in a circle around the bell. The 19 leaves symbolise the farmsteads that became the property of D√∂hren residents in 1809 after the former Mahrenholz manor was bought and divided. The linden branches also make reference to a linden tree from an old municipal seal. The coat of arms was designed by the Magdeburg heraldist Ernst Albrecht Fiedler. The flag of D√∂hren is white-red (1:1) striped (transverse form: stripes running horizontally, longitudinal form: stripes running vertically) and is centrally covered with the municipal coat of arms.The Lutheran Church  Culture and Sights  = Buildings = Around the village church in the old village centre there are many half-timbered houses from the 17th to 19th century.  Economy and Infrastructure  There used to be a linen factory in D√∂hren, whose chimney still stands. = Transportation Connections = To the Bundesstra√üe 1, which connects Braunschweig with Berlin, it is about 16 kilometers in southern direction. The Bundesautobahn 2 (junction Helmstedt-West) is reached after 14 kilometers. D√∂hren had a station on the Helmstedt-Oebisfelde railway line, which was last served from Weferlingen.

Jos√© Antonio Gir√≥n de Velasco (28 August 1911, Herrera de Pisuerga, Palencia - 22 August 1995, Fuengirola, M√°laga) was a prominent Spanish Falangist politician. He was minister of Labor (1941‚Äì57), counselor of the Council of the Realm and member of the Cortes Espa√±olas. He was one of the most heard voices against any kind of changes during the last years of Francoist regime, taking part in the political group known as \\"the Bunker\\", for their reluctance to the Spanish transition to democracy after Franco's death. He began his political activities during his university studies in Valladolid. In 1931 he joined Juventudes Castellanas de Acci√≥n Hisp√°nica (Castilian Youth for Spanish Action), a small political group founded in Valladolid by On√©simo Redondo, that would merge with Ramiro Ledesma's Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista (Unions of the National- Syndicalist Offensive) and Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera's Falange Espa√±ola de las JONS. He fought in the Civil War on the Nationalist side and commanded units of Falangist militias. After the war, he was appointed national delegate of Veterans and in 1941 minister of Labor, when he was only 30. He deployed an intense activity, like the labor institutes for training workers and the development of the social security system ('). He was removed from the Ministry in 1957 according to the liberalizing shift that Franco wished for the Spanish economy (Stabilization Plan). The previous year, Gir√≥n had decreed a salary increase that the Spanish economy could not afford. Throughout Francoism, Gir√≥n was one of the leaders of Falange and he increasingly showed his dissent, according to the Falangist principles, to many policies of the regime. Notably, he was strongly opposed to opportunism. He yearned for the Falangist 'pending revolution', as Primo de Rivera's ideas just inspired a few policies but Francoism was not really an actual Falangist regime, but a consensus of rightist and authoritarian tendencies. After Franco's death, both he and Blas Pi√±ar were the natural leaders of the \\"Bunker\\" in the Cortes Espa√±olas, and voted against the Political Reform Act of 1976 that allowed the transition to democracy.

Biography Sarah Drake was born in Skeyton on 24 July 1803, the same area of Norfolk as the London University botanist John Lindley and went to school with Lindley's sister Anne. As a young woman, she went to Paris, where she probably studied painting as was expected of young women of the day. In 1830 \\"Ducky\\" (as she became known) moved into the Lindley home at Acton Green in London. She appears to have had a number of roles in the Lindley home, including that of governess, but eventually took up botanical art, gradually taking over from Lindley the illustration of his botanical publications. She created illustrations for his Sertum Orchidaceae, for example, as well as over 1000 illustrations for the horticultural magazine Edwards's Botanical Register, which Lindley edited from 1829 to 1847. More than 300 of these drawings were of orchids and Lindley named the Western Australian orchid genus Drakaea in her honour.Kramer, Jack. Women of Flowers: A Tribute to Victorian Women Illustrators. Stewart, Tabori & Chang, 1996. She also contributed illustrations to the Transactions of the Horticultural Society of London. Drake is perhaps best known for her collaboration with Augusta Innes Withers on the drawings for the monumental Orchidaceae of Mexico and Guatemala by James Bateman, but she also contributed to Lindley's book, Ladies' Botany (1834‚Äì1837), Nathaniel Wallich's Plantae Asiaticae Rariores, John Forbes Royle's Illustrations of the botany and other branches of the natural history of the Himalayan Mountains and to The Botany of HMS Sulphur (1836‚Äì1842). She did not travel abroad and probably went no further than Kew Gardens, the Lindley home or to Loddiges nursery, which put on a display of orchids especially for her.Schmidt, Alesandra M., and Trudy B. Jacoby. \\"Herbs to Orchids: Botanical Illustration in the Nineteenth Century\\". Watkinson Exhibition Catalogs, Paper 3, 1996. Drake's career ended when the Botanical Register went out of business in 1847. She returned to Norfolk to care for elderly relatives and moved in with her uncle, Daniel Drake. In 1852 she married John Sutton Hastings, a wealthy farmer. She died on 9 July 1857, putatively from diabetes, but it has been speculated that she may have suffered from cumulative poisoning from her painting materials.

Classical perspective John Stuart Mill believed the restraint of trade doctrine was justified to preserve liberty and competition The classical perspective on competition was that certain agreements and business practice could be an unreasonable restraint on the individual liberty of tradespeople to carry on their livelihoods. Restraints were judged as permissible or not by courts as new cases appeared and in the light of changing business circumstances. Hence the courts found specific categories of agreement, specific clauses, to fall foul of their doctrine on economic fairness, and they did not contrive an overarching conception of market power. Earlier theorists like Adam Smith rejected any monopoly power on this basis. > \\"A monopoly granted either to an individual or to a trading company has the > same effect as a secret in trade or manufactures. The monopolists, by > keeping the market constantly under-stocked, by never fully supplying the > effectual demand, sell their commodities much above the natural price, and > raise their emoluments, whether they consist in wages or profit, greatly > above their natural rate.\\"Smith (1776) Book I, Chapter 7, para 26 In The Wealth of Nations (1776) Adam Smith also pointed out the cartel problem, but did not advocate legal measures to combat them. > \\"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and > diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or > in some contrivance to raise prices. It is impossible indeed to prevent such > meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent > with liberty and justice. But though the law cannot hinder people of the > same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to do nothing to > facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary.\\"Smith (1776) > Book I, Chapter 10, para 82 Smith also rejected the very existence of, not just dominant and abusive corporations, but corporations at all.Smith (1776) Book V, Chapter 1, para 107 By the latter half of the nineteenth century, it had become clear that large firms had become a fact of the market economy. John Stuart Mill's approach was laid down in his treatise On Liberty (1859). > \\"Again, trade is a social act. Whoever undertakes to sell any description of > goods to the public, does what affects the interest of other persons, and of > society in general; and thus his conduct, in principle, comes within the > jurisdiction of society... both the cheapness and the good quality of > commodities are most effectually provided for by leaving the producers and > sellers perfectly free, under the sole check of equal freedom to the buyers > for supplying themselves elsewhere. This is the so-called doctrine of Free > Trade, which rests on grounds different from, though equally solid with, the > principle of individual liberty asserted in this Essay. Restrictions on > trade, or on production for purposes of trade, are indeed restraints; and > all restraint, qua restraint, is an evil...\\"Mill (1859) Chapter V, para 4 The use of the word \\"society\\" to mean the state, and the false claim that because a \\"social act\\" effects the \\"interest\\" of other persons it comes under the \\"jurisdiction\\" of the state, even if the act is entirely voluntary (i.e. an act of Free Will, agency, for both parties in the exchange). Liberty in commercial matters (in the voluntary buying and selling of goods and services) is not some different \\"principle\\" to liberty generally - it is clearly the same principle. Neo-classical synthesis After Mill, there was a shift in economic theory, which emphasised a more precise and theoretical model of competition. A simple neo-classical model of free markets holds that production and distribution of goods and services in competitive free markets maximizes social welfare. This model assumes that new firms can freely enter markets and compete with existing firms, or to use legal language, there are no barriers to entry. By this term economists mean something very specific, that competitive free markets deliver allocative, productive and dynamic efficiency. Allocative efficiency is also known as Pareto efficiency after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto and means that resources in an economy over the long run will go precisely to those who are willing and able to pay for them. Because rational producers will keep producing and selling, and buyers will keep buying up to the last marginal unit of possible output - or alternatively rational producers will be reduce their output to the margin at which buyers will buy the same amount as produced - there is no waste, the greatest number wants of the greatest number of people become satisfied and utility is perfected because resources can no longer be reallocated to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off; society has achieved allocative efficiency. Productive efficiency simply means that society is making as much as it can. Free markets are meant to reward those who work hard, and therefore those who will put society's resources towards the frontier of its possible production.for one of the opposite views, see Kenneth Galbraith, The New Industrial State (1967) Dynamic efficiency refers to the idea that business which constantly competes must research, create and innovate to keep its share of consumers. This traces to Austrian-American political scientist Joseph Schumpeter's notion that a \\"perennial gale of creative destruction\\" is ever sweeping through capitalist economies, driving enterprise at the market's mercy.Joseph Schumpeter, The Process of Creative Destruction (1942) Contrasting with the allocatively, productively and dynamically efficient market model are monopolies, oligopolies, and cartels. When only one or a few firms exist in the market, and there is no credible threat of the entry of competing firms, prices raise above the competitive level, to either a monopolistic or oligopolistic equilibrium price. Production is also decreased, further decreasing social welfare by creating a deadweight loss. Sources of this market power are said to include the existence of externalities, barriers to entry of the market, and the free rider problem. Markets may fail to be efficient for a variety of reasons, so the exception of competition law's intervention to the rule of laissez faire is justified. Orthodox economists fully acknowledge that perfect competition is seldom observed in the real world, and so aim for what is called \\"workable\\" or \\"effective competition\\".Whish (2003) p.14Clark, \\"Towards a Concept of Workable Competition\\" (1940) 30 Am Ec Rev p.241-256Markham, \\"An Alternative Approach to the Concept of Workable Competition\\" (1950) 40 Am Ec Rev p.349-361 This follows the theory that if one cannot achieve the ideal, then go for the second best optionc.f. Lipsey and Lancaster, \\"The General Theory of Second Best\\" (1956-7) 24 Rev Ec Stud 11-32 by using the law to tame market operation where it can. Chicago School Robert Bork argued that competition law was fundamentally flawed A group of economists and lawyers, who are largely associated with the University of Chicago, advocate an approach to competition law guided by the proposition that some actions that were originally considered to be anticompetitive could actually promote competition. The US Supreme Court has used the Chicago School approach in several recent cases.Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36 (1977), Broadcast Music Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., NCAA v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Oklahoma, Spectrum Sports Inc. v. McQuillan, State Oil Co. v. Khan, Verizon v. Trinko, and Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc. One view of the Chicago School approach to antitrust is found in United States Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner's booksAntitrust lawPosner, Antitrust Law (2001) 2nd ed., and Economic Analysis of LawPosner, Economic Analysis of Law (2007) 7th ed., Posner once worked in the Department of Justice's antitrust division, has long been a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, and is likely the most widely cited antitrust scholar and jurist in the United States.Posner (2001) p.24-25 Robert Bork was highly critical of court decisions on United States antitrust law in a series of law review articles and his book The Antitrust Paradox.Bork, Robert H. The Antitrust Paradox (1978) New York Free Press Bork argued that both the original intention of antitrust laws and economic efficiency was pursuit only of consumer welfare, the protection of competition rather than competitors.Bork (1978) p.405 Furthermore, only a few acts should be prohibited, namely cartels that fix prices and divide markets, mergers that create monopolies, and dominant firms pricing predatorily, while allowing such practices as vertical agreements and price discrimination on the grounds that it did not harm consumers.Bork (1978) p.406 Running through the different critiques of US antitrust policy is the common theme that government interference in the operation of free markets does more harm than good.Frank Easterbrook, The Limits of Antitrust, 63 U. Tex. L. Rev. 1 (1984). \\"The only cure for bad theory\\", writes Bork, \\"is better theory\\". The late Harvard Law School Professor Phillip Areeda, who favours more aggressive antitrust policy, in at least one Supreme Court case challenged Robert Bork's preference for non intervention.Brooke Group v. Williamson 509 US 209 (1993) Other critiques Some economic libertarians have criticised competition law in its entirety, challenging the legitimacy of action against price fixing and cartels.For a criticism of the libertarian view see Michael E. DeBow (2007) What's Wrong with Price Fixing: Responding to the New Critics of Antitrust, published by the Cato Institute See Dominic Armentaro \\"Antitrust: The Case for Repeal\\" (Ludwig Von Mises Institute 1986) and \\"The Case Against Antitrust\\" by Robert A. Levy (Cato Institute 2004). The case being that \\"competition law\\" (or \\"Antitrust\\") is based upon a false view of economics - that it harms rather than benefits consumers in the long term. And that \\"competition law\\" (or \\"Antitrust\\") is based upon principles of law and philosophy that are both false and confused. Policy developments Anti-cartel enforcement is a key focus of competition law enforcement policy. In the United States the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act 2004 raised the maximum imprisonment term for price fixing from three to ten years, and the maximum fine from $10 million to $100 million.see generally, Pate (2004) at USDOJ In 2007 British Airways and Korean Air pleaded guilty to fixing cargo and passenger flight prices.see, USDOJ Antitrust's press release and the court filing These actions complement the private enforcement which has always been an important feature of United States antitrust law. The United States Supreme Court summarised why Congress allows punitive damages in Hawaii v. Standard Oil.Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of California 405 U.S. 251, 262 (1972) > \\"Every violation of the antitrust laws is a blow to the free-enterprise > system envisaged by Congress. This system depends on strong competition for > its health and vigor, and strong competition depends, in turn, on compliance > with antitrust legislation. In enacting these laws, Congress had many means > at its disposal to penalize violators. It could have, for example, required > violators to compensate federal, state, and local governments for the > estimated damage to their respective economies caused by the violations. > But, this remedy was not selected. Instead, Congress chose to permit all > persons to sue to recover three times their actual damages every time they > were injured in their business or property by an antitrust violation.\\" In the EU, the Modernisation Regulation 1/2003 means that the European Commission is no longer the only body capable of public enforcement of European Community competition law. This was done in order to facilitate quicker resolution of competition-related inquiries. In 2005 the Commission issued a Green Paper on Damages actions for the breach of the EC antitrust rules,Damages actions for the breach of the EC antitrust rules {SEC(2005) 1732} /* COM/2005/0672 which suggested ways of making private damages claims against cartels easier.see FAQ on the Green paper here See also *Competition policy *Consumer protection *Herfindahl-Hirschman Index in market structure *History of economic thought *SSNIP *Relevant market *European Community competition law *Irish Competition law Notes References * Bork, Robert H.

Initially named Abd√ºl Hamid, it was ordered by the Ottoman Navy in 1900 from the British shipbuilding company Armstrong Whitworth.B. Langensiepen, A. G√ºlery√ºz, J. Cooper, The Ottoman Steam Navy, 1828‚Äì1923, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland, United States, 1995. pp. 149‚Äì150. . It was laid down in Elswick, Newcastle, in April 1902; launched on 25 September 1903; its sea trials began on 17 December 1903; and it was commissioned in April 1904. It weighed 3,904 tons; was 112 m long with a beam of 14.5 m and a draught of 4.8 m; and was named after the Ottoman Sultan Abd√ºlhamid II. It had two 150mm L/45 quick firing guns, eight 120mm L/45 quick firing guns, six 47mm L/50 quick firing guns, six 37mm quick firing guns, and two 457mm torpedo tubes. Hamidiye was powered by two sets of four-cylinder triple expansion steam engines providing a top speed of 22.2 knots and carried a nominal complement of 400 (in 1904) and 355 (in 1915). Its name Abd√ºl Hamid was changed to Hamidiye after the 1908 Young Turk Revolution. Under the terms of the Treaty of S√®vres, which ended the First World War between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire, the ship was to be handed over to the United Kingdom as war compensation. However, the ensuing Turkish War of Independence culminated in the abrogation of the Treaty of S√®vres; it was replaced by the Treaty of Lausanne, which permitted the new Turkish republic to retain its fleet, including Hamidiye, which became a training ship. Design =General characteristics= Hamidiye was long (length overall) ( between perpendiculars) and had a beam of 47 ft 6 in (14.48 m) and a draft of 16 ft (4.88 m). The ship displaced with a normal load. She was protected by Krupp armor. The armor system consisted of a main armored deck: the horizontal portions were thick, while the slopes on the sides of the ship were thick. Hamidiye was powered by 2-shaft vertical triple expansion engines, which were supplied with steam by cylindrical boilers. The power plant was rated at 12,500 indicated horsepower, which produced a top speed of .Gardiner, Chesneau, & Kolesnik, p. 392 =Armament= Hamidiye was armed with a wide array of medium and smaller caliber guns. The largest of these were two /45 Armstrong quick-firing guns each mounted in its own turret, one forward and one aft. These guns fired projectiles at a rate of 5 to 7 rounds per minute. The mounts allowed elevation to 20¬∞, which provided a maximum range of 14,600 yards (13,350 m). Eight /50 Armstrong quick-firing guns rounded out the primary armament; these were placed in single mounts amidships, four on either side. Secondary weapons consisted of six 3-pounder guns and six 1-pounder guns, each mounted in single emplacements. Hamidiye also carried a pair of torpedo tubes; these were emplaced in two aim-able mounts underneath the forebridge. After the First World War, Hamidiye was rearmed; both types of primary guns were removed, and replaced with SK L/45 and SK L/50 Krupp guns. Service history =1908‚Äì1909= Hamidiye was involved in putting down a Greek uprising at Samos Island in 1908. In 1909 it was attached to the army which, under Mahmud ≈ûevket Pasha, marched on Istanbul to put down the counter- revolution (31 March Incident), and anchored off Ye≈üilk√∂y, across from Sevket Pasha's headquarters. =Balkan Wars= Hamidiye fought in the Balkan Wars under the command of Captain Rauf Orbay, and was the only Ottoman ship to distinguish itself in the conflict.Hough, pp. 66‚Äì67 In November 1912, while shelling Bulgarian positions during the First Balkan War, Hamidiye was damaged in the Battle of Kaliakra by the Bulgarian torpedo boat ,Sondhaus, p. 219 though Orbay claimed to have sunk two other torpedo boats.Hough, p. 67 The torpedo tore a hole in her bow on the starboard side, and killed eight men.Gardiner and Gray, p. 389 Though the bow was mostly submerged, it was able to withdraw back to home port for repairs. On 14 January 1913, Hamidiye slipped through the Greek naval blockade of the Dardanelles under cover of night, and proceeded to raid Greek shipping in the Aegean. The next day, at Syros, it sank the Greek armed merchantman Makedonia and shelled the town of Ermoupoli. From there it set sail to Beirut and Port Said.Hall, p. 200, p. 65 The raids of Hamidiye and its ability to roam around the Mediterranean and sow confusion, disrupt shipping and destroy various ships and facilities while avoiding its pursuers became a major morale booster for the Ottomans. The main aim of its sally however, to draw away the Greek cruiser so as to enable the Ottoman fleet to tackle the rest of the Greek navy in support of the Ottoman land forces, failed. Orbay then led his ship to shell Greek and Serbian positions on the coast of Albania. On 28 February it tried to attack Greek merchant ships carrying Serbian troops from Salonika to Albania to help with the Siege of Shkod√´r, but the Serbs set up the field artillery on decks and fired back forcing it to retire. At San Giovanni di Medua (Turkish: ≈ûingin) on 12 March 1913, it sank six Greek merchant ships and heavily damaged an Austrian ship, as well as shelling the Serbian military encampment there. Evading the Greek destroyers sent to find it, Hamidiye set sail for Egypt. Another sortie south of Crete led to the capture of another Greek merchantman, but reports of Greek warships near Rhodes forced Hamidiye, whose boilers were damaged and reduced her speed, to seek refuge in the Red Sea, where it sat out the end of the war. =World War I= Ottoman cruiser Hamidiye (right) as seen from the battlecruiser at the ƒ∞zmit Naval Base in the Sea of Marmara. During World War I, it fought against the Russian Navy in Black Sea and joined and in maintaining control over Black Sea lanes and ports. It engaged in numerous naval battles, was hit many times. Hamidiye conducted a series of operations in company with Yav√ªz and Midilli; on 23 September 1914, Hamidiye sailed with Yav√ªz to Trebizond to escort three transports.Halpern, p. 228 In November it bombarded military installations at Russian port Tuapse. The ship sortied again in January 1915 along with Midilli; on 9 January the two ships accidentally encountered the Russian fleet off Yalta. In the brief engagement, Midilli hit the Russian battleship once. On their return they were pursued by ships of the Russian fleet. The recently repaired Yav√ªz steamed out of the Bosporus to cover the arrival of Hamidiye and Midilli and force off the pursuing Russians.Halpern, pp. 228‚Äì229 =Post World War I= The war between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire was ended with the signing of the Treaty of S√®vres on 10 August 1920; according to the terms of the treaty, Hamidiye, along with Yav√ªz and several other warships, were to be ceded to Great Britain as war reparations.Gardiner and Gray, p. 388 However, the Turkish War of Independence, led by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, eventually created a new Turkish state; the Treaty of S√®vres was discarded, and the Treaty of Lausanne was signed in its place. Under the terms of this treaty, the new Turkish republic regained possession of much its fleet. It was the first Ottoman warship to be transferred to the Turkish Navy in 1925. On 23 October 1937, Hamidiye was involved in a collision with at Be≈üikta≈ü. Ordu sank with the loss of two crew members. Awards Ottoman cruiser Hamidiye in 1913. The only commemorative military medal issued by the Ottomans for the Balkan Wars was the Cruiser Hamidiye Medal 1913, which was given to each of the ship's 394 crew members. The ship was decommissioned in March 1947 after a service of training cadets since 1940. For a short while between 1949 and 1951, it was a museum ship anchored at the port of the Kabata≈ü quarter in Istanbul, on the European shoreline of the Bosphorus. Hamidiye was then laid up at the Golden Horn between 1951 and 1964, until it was sold for scrap on 10 September 1964. It was then towed to the Pa≈üabah√ße quarter in the Beykoz district of Istanbul, on the Anatolian shoreline of the Bosphorus, and its breaking-up was completed there in 1966.

Population and land use At the turn of the 20th century, the townland had a population of approximately 200 people. By the early 21st century, it was proposed to develop a planned settlement on \\"greenfield agricultural land\\" in the area. Covering and containing 5,000 dwellings, schools, a medical centre and other facilities, this settlement was proposed to service a population of 13,000 people. Similar in concept to Adamstown, Dublin, the planning application called for the settlement to be based on three villages and a town centre, built around a new railway station. Due to the fallout from the Irish property bubble and planning challenges, the development was significantly delayed, with approval only finally given in June 2016. As of the 2011 census, Monard townland had a population of 196 people. Train station The 2001 planning proposal called for a railway station, serving the projected residential development, to be located at the Rathpeacon siding on the Dublin-Cork mainline. In June 2016, the planning authority, An Bord Plean√°la, stated that construction on housing within the 'Monard Strategic Development Zone' could not commence until the completion of this proposed station. , no works on the proposed Monard train station have commenced, with no funding allocated in the National Development Plan for the period 2018-2027. The Cork Metropolitan Area Draft Transport Strategy 2040, a public consultation document published by the National Transport Authority in May 2019, included Monard as one of several potential locations for future stations in the area.

Biography Derek Wanless was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, where he was educated at the Royal Grammar School. From 1967-70, he was an undergraduate at King's College, Cambridge, which he attended on a support grant from Westminster Bank. He was an extraordinarily gifted mathematician and graduated as Senior Wrangler in 1970. On graduation he moved into banking, qualifying as a statistician, and attended the Program for Management Development at Harvard. He was a member of the Institute of Statisticians and a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Bankers, of which he was President in 1999. He had joined Westminster Bank, a constituent of the present National Westminster Bank in 1967, beginning with a Saturday job before becoming NatWest's Director of Personal Banking from 1986-1988. Then becoming the General Manager for UK Branch Business and UK Financial Services before, in 1992, taking on the role of Group Chief Executive until 1999, when he received a reported pay-off of ¬£3,000,000. It was on Friday 8 October 1999, that BBC News reported that Derek Wanless had been ousted from his position as Chief Executive. Wanless was reportedly forced out by the bank's Non-Executive Directors, who replaced him with Sir David Rowland. Wanless had been criticised by City investors for taking the bank into investment banking, and failing to curtail high costs. As executive responsible for NatWest's card business, he led the team which invented Switch, the UK's debit card scheme. He led the NatWest Group immediately prior to its takeover, by the (then) relatively small Royal Bank of Scotland. In 2002 he carried out a review of the future funding of the National Health Service for Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer and in 2007 carried out a further review for the King's Fund. He was a Non-Executive Director of Northern Rock between 2000/2007, where he was Chairman of The Northern Rock's Audit and Risk committees. His position became highly contentious, following the incipient collapse of Northern Rock in September 2007. The Northern Rock's crisis was due to inadequate risk provision, and a 'run on the Bank' was only halted with promises of unlimited UK government support.BBC News (Sept. 2007). ‚ÄúNorthern Rock deposits guaranteed: The government has said that it will guarantee all deposits held by the embattled Northern Rock bank‚Äù, BBC News, 17 September 2007.

To a lesser extent, the practice exists, or has existed, in other parts of the western Balkans, including Bosnia, Dalmatia (Croatia), Serbia and Northern Macedonia. National Geographic's Taboo (2002) estimated that there were fewer than 102 Albanian sworn virgins left. Terminology Other terms for a sworn virgin include, in English, Albanian virgin or avowed virgin; in Serbo-Croatian: Vird≈æina, in , vajz√´ e betuar (most common today, and used in situations in which the parents make the decision when the person is a baby or child), and various words cognate with \\"virgin\\" ‚Äì virgjinesh√´, virgjeresh√´, verginesa, , vergjinesha; in Turkish, sadik, meaning \\"honest, just\\", in Serbian, ostajnica (she who stays), in Bosnian, tobelija (bound by a vow).  Origins  The tradition of sworn virgins in Albania developed out of the Kanuni i Lek√´ Dukagjinit (, or simply the Kanun),From Turkish Kanun, which means law. It is originally derived from the Greek kan√¥n (Œ∫Œ±ŒΩœéŒΩ) as in canon law, a set of codes and laws developed by Lek√´ Dukagjini and used mostly in northern Albania and Kosovo from the 15th century until the 20th century. The Kanun is not a religious document ‚Äì many groups follow it, including Albanian Orthodox, Catholics and Muslims. Hoti, Ottoman Albania, at the beginning of the 20th century The Kanun dictates that families must be patrilineal (meaning wealth is inherited through a family's men) and patrilocal (upon marriage, a woman moves into the household of her husband's family). Women are treated like property of the family. Under the Kanun, women are stripped of many rights. They cannot smoke, wear a watch, or vote in local elections. They cannot buy land, and there are many jobs they are not permitted to hold. There are also establishments that they cannot enter. The practice of sworn virginhood was first reported by missionaries, travelers, geographers and anthropologists, who visited the mountains of northern Albania in the 19th and early 20th centuries. One of them was Edith Durham, who took the photograph at right.  Overview  A person can become a sworn virgin at any age, out of personal desire or to satisfy parents. One becomes a sworn virgin by swearing an irrevocable oath, in front of twelve village or tribal elders, to adopt the role and practice celibacy. After this, sworn virgins live as men and others relate to them as such, usually though not always using masculine pronouns to address them or speak about them to other people;Andreas Hemming, Gentiana Kera, Enriketa Pandelejmoni, Albania: Family, Society and Culture in the 20th Century (2012, ), page 168: Others relate to them as men, usually using male pronouns both in addressing them and in speaking of them. they may dress in male clothing, use a male name, carry a gun, smoke, drink alcohol, take on male work, act as the head of a household (for example, living with a sister or mother), play music and sing, and sit and talk socially with men. According to Marina Warner, the sworn virgin's \\"true sex will never again, on pain of death, be alluded to either in her presence or out of it.\\" Similar practices occurred in some societies of indigenous peoples of the Americas. Breaking the vow was once punishable by death, but it is doubtful that this punishment is still carried out. Many sworn virgins today still refuse to go back on their oath because their community would reject them for breaking the vows. However, it is sometimes possible to take back the vows if the reasons or motivations or obligations to family which lead to taking the vow no longer exist.  Motivations  There are many reasons why someone might take this vow, and observers recorded a variety of motivations. One person spoke of becoming a sworn virgin in order to not be separated from her father, and another in order to live and work with a sister. Some hoped to avoid a specific unwanted marriage, and others hoped to avoid marriage in general; becoming a sworn virgin was also the only way for families who had committed children to an arranged marriage to refuse to fulfil it, without dishonouring the groom's family and risking a blood feud. It was the only way a woman could inherit her family's wealth, which was particularly important in a society in which blood feuds (gjakmarrja) resulted in the deaths of many male Albanians, leaving many families without male heirs. (However, anthropologist Mildred Dickemann suggests this motive may be \\"over-pat\\", pointing out that a non-child-bearing woman would have no heirs to inherit after her, and also that in some families not one but several daughters became sworn virgins, and in others the later birth of a brother did not end the sworn virgin's masculine role.) Moreover, a child may have been desired to \\"carry on\\" an existing feud, according to Marina Warner. The sworn virgin became \\"a warrior in disguise to defend her family like a man.\\" If a sworn virgin was killed in a blood feud, the death counted as a full life for the purposes of calculating blood money, rather than the half-life a woman was counted as. It is also likely that many women chose to become sworn virgins simply because it afforded them much more freedom than would otherwise have been available in a patrilineal culture in which women were secluded, sex- segregated, required to be virgins before marriage and faithful afterwards, betrothed as children and married by sale without their consent, continually bearing and raising children, constantly physically labouring, and always required to defer to men, particularly their husbands and fathers, and submit to being beaten. Dickemann suggests mothers may have played an important role in persuading children to become sworn virgins. A widow without sons traditionally had few options in Albania: she could return to her birth family, stay on as a servant in the family of her deceased husband, or remarry. With a son or surrogate son, she could live out her life in the home of her adulthood, in the company of her child. Murray quotes testimony recorded by Ren√© Gremaux: \\"Because if you get married I'll be left alone, but if you stay with me, I'll have a son.\\" On hearing those words Djurdja [the daughter] \\"threw down her embroidery\\" and became a man.  Prevalence  The practice has died out in Dalmatia and Bosnia, but is still carried out in northern Albania and to a lesser extent in Northern Macedonia. The Socialist People's Republic of Albania did not encourage women to become sworn virgins. Women started gaining legal rights and came closer to having equal social status, especially in the central and southern regions. It is only in the northern region that many families are still traditionally patriarchal. Currently there are between forty and several hundred sworn virgins left in Albania, and a few in neighboring countries. Most are over fifty years old. It used to be believed that the sworn virgins had all but died out after 50 years of communism in Albania, but recent research suggests that may not be the case; instead, the increase in feuding following the collapse of the communist regime could encourage a resurgence of the practice.

It lasts from Friday to Sunday. It is organized by the Polish Cultural and Educational Union (PZKO) and the folklore group Gorol, and preserves the traditions of the Zaolzie Poles. It is the largest cultural and folklore festival in the Zaolzie area, drawing thousands of spectators each day of festivities. In 2007 almost 20,000 people visited the festival. Notable personalities, mainly from the Czech Republic and Poland, also visit the festival each year. In 2007 Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Mirek Topol√°nek visited the festival. The primary goal of the festival is the presentation of Gorol folklore groups from the environs of Jab≈Çonk√≥w and the rest of the Zaolzie region. Such groups were appearing at the festival until 1955, when for the first time groups from outside the region were invited. Folklore groups from the Polish part of the Beskid Mountains are invited each year as well. Folklore groups from other countries also appear. The festival has its roots in the earlier ≈öwiƒôta G√≥r (Feasts of the Mountains), which were gatherings of Gorals from Jab≈Çonk√≥w parish. After the end of World War II the idea of reviving the tradition was considered by local Polish activists. The General Committee of the PZKO decided on 22 July 1948 that a festival be held that August, later rescheduled to 12 September. At the suggestion of Karol Piegza, Polish writer and folklorist, it was named ≈öwiƒôto G√≥ralskie. The current name, Gorolski ≈öwiƒôto, is the same as the original one but in the local dialect and has been used since 1967. The first festival in 1948 was successful, and so it was decided to hold it annually. It became more and more popular and attracted ever more visitors from an ever broader area. Several Gorols working as organizers and storytellers during the festival became very popular, particularly W≈Çadys≈Çaw Niedoba (Jura spod Gr√≥nia), Ludwik Ciencia≈Ça (Maciej), and W≈Çadys≈Çaw M≈Çynek (Hadam z Drugi Izby). The main storyteller of the festival is now Tadeusz Filipczyk (Filip). Since 1961 Niedoba has been responsible for the program of the festival. M≈Çynek started his organizational work in 1973, and Filipczyk in 1986. W≈Çadys≈Çaw M≈Çynek's most important contribution to the festival is that he helped to join Gorolski ≈öwiƒôto with Tydzie≈Ñ Kultury Beskidzkiej (The Week of Beskid Culture), a cultural and folklore festival in Wis≈Ça and other municipalities of the Beskids of Poland. The result of this cooperation is the annual appearance in Gorolski ≈öwiƒôto of top Polish folklore groups and also groups from other countries. The first festival in 1948 was organized by only 21 people, and now the number of organizers reaches into the hundreds.Gawlik 2006, 99. The festival is now held in Lasek Miejski (Municipal Forest). During the festival many small wooden cottages are set up, managed by local branches of the PZKO from surrounding Beskid villages. Visitors can buy there traditional food and beverages, like traditional miodula (mead). These wooden cottages have been a feature of Gorolski ≈öwiƒôto since 1969. A stage was built in 1985.

He first served in the Sudanese military before he and others founded Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in 1983. He defected to the Sudanese government after his dissatisfaction with the SPLA. He was therefore, given the 5th position in the high-ranking command of the SPLA before his defection.  Early life  Arok was a Dinka Bor from the Twic community of Kongor. He is known by some to be related to Dr. John Garang De Mabior. He was in Kongor in 1984 to 1985 as the regional commander for Mading Bor. He almost died of thirst between Juba and Mading Bor when he and his troops travelled in an area where there was no water. He was succeeded by Commander Kuol Manyang Juuk as the leader in Mading Bor. He had some disagreements with the leadership of Garang. In 1987 his wife Mrs Elizabeth Thon Arok died and he went to London to place his children in school and he return with his daughter Eileen Thon Arok.  Imprisonment  Rumors had it that Commander Arok was imprisoned and later dismissed by Garang after he secretly made an agreement with the Sudanese government officials in London. His plan was to overthrow Dr. Garang and lead SPLA back to Sudan. In late 1992 Arok escaped from SPLA imprisonment, together with Kerubino Kuanyin.  Return to Sudan  In early 90s Arok returned to Khartoum. He was known as the leader of Twic/Tuic East group which was part of the Khartoum Peace Agreement signed by Dr. Riek Machar and the Sudanese government.

In an aviation career that spanned eighteen years, Hill piloted nearly 60 of the Army Air Corps' newest aircraft, testing and evaluating their capabilities for service. Pete Hill was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts on October 24, 1894 and attended grammar school and high school in his hometown. In 1916, he graduated from Brown University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering. The following year, he enlisted in the Aviation Section of the U.S. Army Signal Enlisted Reserve Corps. In 1918, he received flight instruction at the School of Military Aeronautics at Cornell University, the Aviation Concentration Camp at Camp Dix in Dallas, Texas, and at Chanute Field in Rantoul, Illinois. Hill then accepted a commission as a 2nd lieutenant in the regular Army and served as a flying instructor before receiving instruction as a bombardment pilot. In 1919, Hill served in the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps in Washington, D.C., then in 1920 was ordered to duty with the American Army of Occupation in Germany, where he served as the Engineer Officer of the Air Service Flying Station in Weissenthurm. In 1922, he was assigned to duty with the 12th Aero Squadron stationed at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, then transferred back to Chanute Field for instruction in aerial photography. After completing the course, he stayed on as a student instructor. In 1924, he returned to duty in Washington, D.C., in the Training and War Plans Division under the Chief of the Air Service. In 1925, he was ordered to duty at Mitchel Field, New York, where he was appointed Commanding Officer of the 14th Photo Section, a job he held until 1929. He then served as the Commanding Officer of the 6th Photo Section at Nichols Field in Manila. In 1932, he returned to the United States and was assigned to Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, where he served as a test pilot and Assistant Chief of Planes and Engines in the Maintenance Unit. In 1935, he was assigned as the Chief of the Flying Branch of the Material Division at Wright Field, with the temporary rank of Major. His duties involved the flight testing and evaluation of numerous new military aircraft designs at various contractors' plants, including the Consolidated P-30, Martin B-10, B-12, and many others. Crashed Model 299 at Wright Field, Ohio. On October 30, 1935, Hill and Boeing's chief test pilot Leslie Tower died as a result of injuries received from the crash of the Boeing experimental aircraft Model 299 at Wright Field; three others on board survived., The crash occurred because the crew neglected to remove the wind-gust locks, devices intended to keep the control surfaces from moving when the plane was on the ground. This aircraft was the prototype of what would later become the famous B-17 Flying Fortress of World War II. Major Hill was buried in Newburyport, Massachusetts, on November 3, 1935. In 1939, the U.S. War Department named the site of the Ogden Air Depot \\"Hill Field\\" in honor of Major Ployer Peter Hill. In 1948, Hill Field was renamed Hill Air Force Base.

He served as a professor of law at the Rutgers School of Law‚ÄìNewark from 1964 to 1999. He was one of the founders in 1966 of the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York City, and successfully argued a number of cases before the Supreme Court of the United States. He also founded the Public Interest Law Center of New Jersey. Education Kinoy was born on September 29, 1920 in New York City. He attended public schools and Harvard University (A.B., 1941), where he graduated magna cum laude. As a student at Harvard, Kinoy was a member of the national executive committee of the American Student Union. He earned his law degree at Columbia University (LL.B., 1947), where he was executive editor of the law review. Career as attorney Kinoy was attorney for the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE), classified in the 1950s as a Communist-controlled union by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS), headed by conservative Democratic Sen. James O. Eastland from Mississippi. Kinoy took an active part in the defense of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg from 1951. They were convicted of atomic espionage and executed on June 19, 1953. Kinoy made the last appeal to try to save the Rosenbergs from execution. In the 1950s, Kinoy was a partner in the law firm of Donner, Kinoy & Perlin. Among their clients were left-wing groups such as the Committee for Justice for Morton Sobell and Labor Youth League.U.S. Senator James O. Eastland (D-MS), chairman of the SISS, on the floor of the Senate, on February 3, 1965. Kinoy was a member of the National Lawyers Guild, serving as national vice president in 1954. In 1964, at the height of the Civil Rights Movement activities in the South to end disenfranchisement and segregation, he participated in a conference sponsored by the National Lawyers Guild's Committee for Legal Assistance in the South. It briefed attorneys on legal problems confronting civil rights demonstrators in Mississippi, where state and local governments resisted change. He and his partner, William Kunstler, were two of the most prominent attorneys during the 1960s to handle civil rights cases in the South. In 1964, Kinoy became a professor of law at Rutgers University, deciding to enlarge his practice that way. He taught until being forced to retire at the age of 70 in 1991. Following his retirement from Rutgers, Kinoy taught constitutional law at Temple University Law School in Philadelphia from 1994 to 1995 and was a key faculty advisor for the Temple Political & Civil Rights Law Review. From 1964 to 1967 he was also a partner in the law firm of Kunstler, Kunstler & Kinoy of New York City. He was counsel for the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and the Southern Conference Educational Fund. He was also affiliated with the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, which in 1966 became part of the newly established Center for Constitutional Rights in New York City, of which he was a founding member. Together with William Kunstler and others, Kinoy determined the need for a non-profit legal defense organization to raise awareness of issues in civil rights and work to overturn unconstitutional practices. In 1966, Kinoy was a speaker at the annual dinner of the National Guardian newspaper. He also did legal work for the American Civil Liberties Union, which worked to establish precedent in civil and constitutional rights cases. During the 1950s and 1960s, Kinoy represented persons called to hearings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities; in 1966 he was officially removed from a hearing by Senator Eastland, its chair, and subsequently convicted of disorderly conduct. In 1968, the U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the conviction. As The New York Times stated in its obituary, > Mr. Kinoy was involved in a number of landmark legal verdicts. In 1965, he > successfully argued the case of Dombrowski v.

In his autobiography Rights On Trial: The Odyssey Of A People's Lawyer, Kinoy claimed that the break-in at Watergate by Republican Party operatives in 1972 was an attempt to remove, not place, wiretaps in the Democratic Party headquarters. He suggests that it was ordered because the Nixon administration knew of the impending decision in United States v. United States District Court, likely, by a tip from SCOTUS Justice William Rehnquist, who had served as Nixon's Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel prior to joining the Supreme Court. Kinoy was one of the founders of the Women's Rights Law Reporter, the first legal periodical to focus exclusively on women's rights. Kinoy also was the key founder of the Mass Party Organizing Committee, a coalition-based, electorally friendly attempt to create a socialist third party in the United States in the 1970s. Personal life Kinoy was married to Barbara S. Webster at his death. He had previously married and was divorced from Susan Knopf. He died on September 19, 2003 at the age of 82 at his home in New Jersey. He was survived by two children from his first marriage, as well as by his younger brother Ernest Kinoy, a noted television and film screenwriter.

St. Cuthbert's beads (or Cuddy's beads) are fossilised portions of the \\"stems\\" of Carboniferous crinoids. Crinoids are a kind of marine echinoderm which are still extant, and which are sometimes known as \\"sea lilies\\". These bead-like fossils are washed out onto the beach and in medieval Northumberland were strung together as necklaces or rosaries, and became associated with St Cuthbert. In other parts of England, circular crinoid columnals were known as \\"fairy money.\\" Pentagonal crinoid columnals were known as \\"star stones\\", and moulds of the stems left impressions which were known as screwstones. In Germany, the columnals were known as Bonifatius pfennige (St Boniface's pennies) and in America they are known as Indian beads. Palaeontology The \\"beads\\" are thick discs or short cylinders, which, when the crinoid was still alive, were articulated to form a branched structure, linked by soft tissue, nerves and ligaments which occupied the central hole (lumen). The columnals usually became disarticulated after the animal died. Articulated crinoid fossils are relatively rare, but disarticulated columnals are quite common in the fossil record. They may be extracted from their matrix (often limestone) or, in the case of exposures in coastal cliffs, they can sometimes be found washed out of the matrix and deposited on the foreshore, as if from the sea. History In mediaeval Northumberland, the fossilised columnals were collected at Lindisfarne, and strung together as a necklace or rosary. Over time, they became associated with St. Cuthbert, who was a monk on Lindisfarne and the nearby island of Hobthrush (also known as St Cuthbert's Isle) in the 7th century and became Bishop of Lindisfarne. According to legend, it was said that St. Cuthbert used the beads as a rosary, or that his spirit created them on stormy nights so they could be found on the beach the next morning. Lane and Ausich (2001) suggest that the beads were not associated with St. Cuthbert before the 12th century, and may have become popular after a limestone quarry came into operation on Lindisfarne in the 14th century. The first known reference to Cuthbert's beads in a documentary source is found in an account of a visit to Lindisfarne by a John Ray in 1671: At the time, the origin and nature of the \\"beads\\" was not well known. The peculiar stones were categoried with \\"Devil's toenails\\" (Gryphaea shells), \\"snakestones\\" (ammonites), \\"St Peter's fingers\\" or \\"Devil's fingers\\" or \\"thunderbolts\\" (belemnites); although by 1673, Martin Lister hypothesised that crinoids were \\"plants petrified\\". The term \\"St Cuthbert's beads\\" became a common way of referring to crinoid columnals from the 17th century onwards, and is a term which is still used occasionally in palaeontological writings. In literature In Sir Walter Scott's poem Marmion, written in 1808, St. Cuthbert is described (by fishermen) as creating these bead-like fossils at Lindisfarne, Northumberland. The poem also makes reference to St. Hilda of Whitby, Yorkshire who, according to religious legend, turned snakes into stone, the \\"snake stones\\" being the numerous fossil ammonites of that area.

History Matrixism, also referred to as \\"The path of the One,\\" was primarily introduced in 2004. A website on Yahoo GeoCities created by an anonymous source provided the basis for the religion. Matrixism is inspired by the Matrix trilogy and its associated stories (including The Animatrix). However, these stories are not the sole foundation. The ideals of Matrixism can be traced back to the early 20th century to The Promulgation of Universal Peace, the record of talks by \`Abdu'l-Bah√° during his journeys to the West in the United States.Kohn, Rachael.

Tenets Matrixism carried with it four main beliefs that are described as \\"The Four Tenets of Matrixism\\". Briefly these were: belief in a messianic prophecy, use of psychedelic drugs as sacrament, a perception of reality as multi-layered and semi-subjective, and adherence to the principles of at least one of the world's major religions.Jordison, Sam (2005).

Northern colletes are solitary bees, though females may nest in what are termed aggregations ‚Äì sites where the bees nest close together, but do not form colonies as social bees do. They nest underground in soft (often sandy) soil, digging burrows up to 20 times their body length. It is often to be found nesting in coastal sand dunes and, on Hebridean islands, machair (coastal grassland). Appearance The bees are medium-sized (with a head-to- body length of around 8‚Äì15 mm) and slender. They have a black abdomen, with narrow white bands on each segment. Tawny hairs cover the top of the thorax, with somewhat paler hairs on the face. They are very similar to other species within the genus Colletes and, if more than one of these species shares the same habitat, microscopic examination can be necessary to distinguish between them. Females are slightly larger than the males, possessing slightly longer abdomens, which are also darker and glossier. Life cycle Adult northern colletes emerge in late June, and are active until late August. The bees are active only when the temperature is warm. The males emerge one or two days before the females. The females probably mate soon after emergence. The males then die, while the female constructs a burrow which may be as much as 26 cm deep. The female produces a secretion from glands in the mouth, forming a cellophane-like coating for the burrow. Each egg is sealed inside an individual cell, with enough regurgitated nectar and pollen to feed the larva throughout the winter. The larva lives underground, pupating in its burrow and emerging the following June as an adult. As northern colletes do not form colonies, there are no worker bees. Distribution Machair in the Outer Hebrides is a typical habit for this species. This is a rare bee. It can be found in Britain and Ireland, where it nests on the coasts of Ireland and northern England, while in Scotland it can be found on islands as well as coastal areas of the mainland. Elsewhere in northern Europe, it is present in low densities in Scandinavia, again in coastal areas. It appears to prefer south-facing slopes with low, sparse vegetation; the bee forages in nearby flower-rich areas. In southern Europe, however, it inhabits higher altitudes, being found in the Pyrenees, Carpathians and Altay Mountains. One of the most significant habitats for this species of bee is the machair (coastal duneland) of the Outer Hebrides in Scotland where it was reported in September, 2007 that eleven previously unknown colonies had been discovered.

In October 1917, Patriot formed part of a large-scale operation, involving 30 cruisers and 54 destroyers deployed in eight groups across the North Sea in an attempt to stop a suspected sortie by German naval forces. Despite these countermeasures, the two German light cruisers and , managed to evade the patrols and attacked the regular convoy between Norway and Britain, sinking nine merchant ships and two destroyers, and before returning safely to Germany. She maintained continuous operations both as a convoy escort, and in harbour protection. Patriot remained part of the 14th Destroyer Flotilla at the end of the war. Following the end of the war, the Grand Fleet was abolished, forming the Atlantic Fleet, with more modern destroyers (mainly the V and W classes and the S class) supporting the fleet, while older destroyers went to subsidiary tasks or were laid up.Manning 1961, pp. 27‚Äì28.

A part of historical Greater Mtskheta, it is a place where the ancient city of the same name and the original capital of the early Georgian kingdom of Kartli or Iberia was located. It particularly flourished in the early centuries CE and was destroyed by the Arab invasion in the 730s.  Archaeology  Minor excavations on the territory of Armazi carried out in 1890 revealed the plinth of adobe town walls, with stone steps, and cleared the two-room structure, where fragments of a woman's torso of the 1st century AD were discovered. From 1943 to 1948 large-scale excavation was undertaken under Andria Apakidze of the Georgian Academy of Sciences, resumed in 1985 and continuing. These have shown that the adobe town walls and towers, built upon a plinth of hewn stone in the first half of the 1st century AD, surrounded the hill top and the side sloping down towards the river, an area of 30 ha. The land within the walls was terraced and various buildings were sited on the terraces. The three major cultural layers have been identified: the earliest dates back to the 4th-3rd century BC (Armazi I), the middle one is from the 3rd-1st century BC (Armazi II), and the relatively newer structure belongs to the 1st-6th century AD (Armazi III). Armazi I is constructed of massive stone blocks forming an impregnable base but were finished off by less durable mud brick. It also contains a great hall of six columns with a tiled roof. Armazi II is noted for a temple with an apse. Armazi III is the richest layer constructed of elegantly cut stone blocks, joined together with lime mortar and metal clamps. Among the surviving structures are the royal palace, several richly decorated tombs, a bathhouse and a small stone mausoleum.Lang, David Marshall. \\"Armazi\\". Encyclop√¶dia Iranica Online Edition.

History  The ruins of the Armazi citadel Archaeological evidences testify that the ancient Armazi was far more extensive than it is today. Armazi's strategic situation was dictated by its ready access to the Daryal Pass, the main road over the Greater Caucasus, through which the Scythians invaded the ancient Near East. The name of the city and its dominant acropolis, Armaz-Tsikhe (literally, \\"citadel of Armazi\\"; ·Éê·É†·Éõ·Éê·Éñ·É™·Éò·ÉÆ·Éî), is usually taken to derive from Armazi, the chief deity of the pagan Iberian pantheon. The name first appears in the early medieval Georgian annals though it is clearly much older and reflected in the Classical name Armastica or Harmozica of Strabo, Pliny, Ptolemy and Dio Cassius. According to a collection of medieval Georgian chronicles, Armaztsikhe was founded, in the 3rd century BC, by king Pharnavaz I of Iberia at the place hitherto known as Kartli. This fortress stood on the modern-day Mount Bagineti, on the right bank of the Mtkvari River (Kura), at its confluence with the Aragvi. The other citadel, Tsitsamuri (·É¨·Éò·É¨·Éê·Éõ·É£·É†·Éò) or Sevsamora of the Classical authors, stood just opposite, on the left bank of the Aragvi and controlled the road towards Mount Kazbek. Even after the rise of Mtskheta as a capital of Iberia, Armazi remained the holy city of Iberian paganism and one of the defenses of Mtskheta. The fortress was captured by the Roman general Pompey during his 65 BC campaign against the Iberian king Artag. A ruined structure over the Mtkvari River dates from that time and is still called \\"Pompey's bridge\\". Armazi's heyday came when Iberia was allied with the Roman emperors. Armazi stele of Vespasian unearthed in 1867 reports that the Roman Emperor Vespasian fortified Armazi for the Iberian king Mithridates I in 75 AD.Sherk, Robert K. (1988), The Roman Empire: Augustus to Hadrian, p. 128-9. Cambridge University Press, . This defense wall constructed in a unique position to block the southern exit of the Daryal Pass before it widens into the plain of modern Tbilisi was presumably a preventive measure against the Alans who frequently raided the Roman frontiers from across the Caucasus. Armazi stele of Serapit. During this period, Armazi was governed by a hereditary pitiakhsh, whose rank approximated to that of viceroy or satrap, and was second in the official Iberian hierarchy after the king. The excavations of the hereditary necropolis of this dynasty yielded engraved gems bearing portraits of two of these viceroys, Asparukh (probably the contemporary of the Roman emperor Hadrian, 117-138 AD) and Zevakh (fl. 150 AD), a rare example of authentic, pre- Christian Georgian portraiture.Lang, David Marshall. \\"Asparukh\\" . Encyclop√¶dia Iranica Online Edition. Accessed on September 13, 2007. Aramaic inscriptions from Armazi mention also the royal architect and the epitropos (\\"Lord Chamberlain\\"). Armazi played a central role in ancient Georgian cultural life and in the evolution of local epigraphy in Georgia, prior to the invention of the Georgian alphabet in the 5th century. Among a number of curious inscriptions found at Armazi, the most important is the bilingual Greco- Aramaic tombstone inscription commemorating the short-lived Serapita and her noble lineage. It contains an unusual, in its ductus and some of its forms, version of the Aramaic alphabet which came to be known as the \\"Armazi script\\" although it can also be found outside Armazi, in other parts of Georgia. With the transfer of the Georgian capital to Tbilisi in the late 5th or early 6th century, Armazi went into a gradual decline. It still had its own high-ranking commandant, a post held in A.D. 545 by a certain Wistam. The city was finally destroyed and razed to the ground in 736 by the Arab commander Marwan ibn Muhammad (the future Umayyad Caliph Marwan II). The city of Armazi has never been revived since then, but a Georgian Orthodox monastery of St. Nino was constructed there between 1150 and 1178. This is a six-apse hall church which, as well as its associated structures, is now largely in ruins and only some fragments of the 12th-century murals have survived.

Development  Whereas during the first years after World War II the focus of the Deutsche Bundesbahn was on repairs of rolling stock, lines and buildings, with the beginning of the 1950s attention shifted to renewal of the trains. For passenger services on not electrified lines, the first prototypes of main line diesel locomotives such as the class 220 were commissioned in 1953. Subsequently, DB ordered the rail industry to develop new DMUs in order to replace pre-war classes and steam traction. In 1961 MAN and Waggonfabrik Uerdingen both delivered two prototypes each. Even though they were quite similar, they can be distinguished easily by the different front design. DB put the prototypes into service as class VT 23.5 (MAN) and class VT 24.5 (Uerdingen). After the new numbering scheme the prototypes were listed as class 624 together with the regular units. The prototypes underwent intensive tests, including comparison to conventional push/pull trains with DB Class V 100. The regular trainsets were delivered from 1964‚Äì1968 and were produced jointly by both manufacturers. Only minor changes were made to the prototype design. A total of 80 front cars and 55 middle cars were delivered, allowing the use of 40 three-part or two-part trainsets. Starting in 1968, a number of units were equipped with pneumatic shock absorption and passive tilting systems. These units were listed as class 634 and approved for a higher speed of 140 km/h. As the tilting system turned out to be of limited use, clearance allowing only very limited tilting, in 1979 the tilting system was removed.Private Website with detailed information In 1970 a number of trainsets derived from class 624 were delivered to Yugoslavia (Slovenia) as S≈Ω series 711. They are still in use by Slovenian Railways.  Service  Upon entering service the new class 624 units were often used for fast regional and express trains in various parts of Germany. This changed gradually and by 1980 nearly all of the units were based in Osnabr√ºck and Braunschweig, employed on regional and local lines. Regional and local passenger traffic in the Harz region was carried out almost exclusively by these trainsets. Whereas the successor class 614 units supplemented DB's DMU fleet, the class 628.2 regular types coming into service after 1986 began to displace class 624 into subordinate services. Retirement of class 624/634 trainsets started in 2003, when DB lost a couple of tender procedures to private companies and modern light-weight DMUs came into service in large numbers. The last class 624/634 units were retired in 2005. Fourteen trainsets were sold to Poland's PKP as Class SA110 and have been in use in regional and local service.Local newspaper on transfer to Poland In Romania, several class 624 units are in service with Transferoviar Grup.  Technical information  Only the front cars were motorised, therefore the trainsets could be assembled either with or without up to two middle cars. Up to three trainsets (i.e. six engines) could be operated as multiple traction, connected by Scharfenberg couplers, which were also used to connect front and middle cars. Each front car was equipped with a 331 kW MAN diesel engine, the power being transferred hydro-dynamically to the front-end bogie. The passenger compartment's layout was derived from the so- called Silberling (silverling) polished stainless steel short-line passenger coaches, with open-plan compartments. The trains had oil heating. The Class 624/634 was compatible with its successor DB Class 614, so all units could be in mixed plans, including mixed use of middle cars.

Though there is enough knowledge there for a common worshiper to understand Ayyavazhi theology, it needs the Hindu and at some times the scriptures of other religions (including abrahamic) to be referred to undergo a detailed religious study on Akilam. Because Akilam maintains a unique type of relation with the other scriptures. On one hand it rejects Hindu scriptures by saying that they have lost their divinity by the activities of Kali, but on the other many of the theological, mythical as well as philosophical terms and concepts from Hindu scriptures are adopted directly and indirectly. However it's unavoidable to refer Hindu scriptures to find more details about the ideology of Akilam. Mythology It was considered that one should have a basic knowledge about the Hindu scriptures and its concepts to get into the philosophical study of Ayyavazhi. Almost all the God-heads either lesser or higher in power found in Akilam with only a least and undetailed introduction on their how and whereabouts. They just plays their part to the long mythical story-line of the Ayyavazhi mythology. But to understand the core philosophy of that event and the reason behind the involvement of that God-head to that event one should have already known the details about that particular God- head, which was not found in Akilam. Also only there a least possibility to know the relationship between several mythical figures other than the higher God-heads. And for all these details including their story-background, origin etc. Regarding mythology The Mahabharata, Ramayana, Kantha Purana, Vishnu Purana, etc. all found place with limited details in Akilam. Akilam provides all these collectively with a mutual relation with each other in an overall story line which makes it unique. But to understand the whole knowledge for example Treta Yuga, the scripture which includes those events in detail should needed to be referred. Though the event related to the same Treta Yuga is found in Akilam, it includes only the main events which are directly related to the maintained story-line. Same in the matter of Mahabharata and kantha Purana. Apart from these many mythical events are found in brief Akilam which is found in detail in Siva purana, Santror purana etc. Overall, all the Pre- Kali Yuga events are mentioned briefly in Akilam and more details about them which is essential to undergo a religious study on Akilam may be collected from the Hindu texts. However Akilam includes more details about the events in Kali Yuga than that of the previous and further more from the incarnation of Vaikundar. But on the other hand, it again needs a good knowledge about the Hindu concepts such as Nirguna and Saguna Brahman, rather than mythology for one who wants to know about the supremacy of Vaikundar. Theology The Akilam-based theology is not a constant one since it deals with the whole events right from the creation to the end. It undergoes different theologies from polytheism to monotheism and monism, though monism is the final and overall focus point for the present yuga. It is viewed closely to the mythical events that take place at various ages and so it changes often. Monism in the beginning (creation), polytheism till the end of Dvapara Yuga, then some sort of henotheism till the advent of Vaikundar; and then on monism again. All these changes are closely tied to the appropriate mythical events and so all stories related to these changes should be known in detail to understand the evolution of the philosophy of Akilam through the ages. Also since from the incarnation of Vaikundar all previous individual God-heads are surrendered and assembled within Vaikundar, then onwards he is the responsible one for the activities of all god-heads. All the works to be done by them will be performed by Vaikundar. So it is unavoidable to know about the nature, quality and powers of all those god-heads to understand the quality and power extension of Vaikundar. So again the details of those surrendered god-heads to be collected from the Hindu texts. But if Akilam has any different ideas about any particular event or any origin of God-heads, mentioned elaborately in Hindu texts, then it will be found in detail in Akilam. And so for that, Akilam forms the foremost source and need not be referred from previous Hindu texts. Concepts Many, almost all philosophical concepts from Hinduism are found in Akilam. Some of them are completely accepted, some are regenerated while some others are rejected by omitting. Most of the Hindu concepts are just found mention in Akilam with merely their name and the rest with their details left to be collected from the Hindu texts. Some of them are regenerated by giving different ideas. It includes the concepts, Yuga, evil, Moksha, Maya (Kali) etc. Several other concepts such as Tatvas, Kosas, Chakras, Karma, reincarnation, Sariyai, Kiriyai, Yoga etc. are accepted. However, Akilam maintains the rejection of all previous scriptures throughout but knowledge about several basic concepts from them are important to understand Akilam. So generally it was considered that, once a particular event or concept which is needed is not found well-described in Ayyavazhi scriptures such as Akilattirattu Ammanai or Arul Nool, (as detail as in Hindu scriptures) and instead simply have quoted it with their names, then that particular conception is accepted as in Hindu scriptures for religious studies. But when the idea of a particular notion of Akilam differs very much from Hindu scriptures, that particular thing is deeply described. However, in a particular thing if both Akilam and Hindu scriptures have different ideas, then that of Akilam only is accepted. There is also a view that Akilam is a guideline to follow the Hindu scriptures. See also * Ayyavazhi and Hinduism * Akilattirattu Ammanai * Ayyavazhi beliefs * Ayyavazhi mythology References * Tha.

He was Minister of Foreign Affairs 2011 to 2013 and 2018 to 2019 after having served as the caretaker Minister of Defense since 10 July 2011. Prior to that he served as the pre-independence South Sudanese Minister of SPLA and Veteran Affairs, from 22 December 2008 until 9 July 2011. Nhial Deng Nhial Appointed Minister for SPLA Affairs In December 2008  Biography  Nhial Deng is a Dinka from the Bahr el Ghazal region of Southern Sudan. He is the son of the famous late leader William Deng Nhial who was assassinated in 1968 before the Addis Ababa Agreement was signed between Sudan and South Sudan in Ethiopia, in 1972. William Deng Nhial was as thoughtful as John Garang was. His son Nhial Deng Nhial did not join the movement as a member of an average Southern Sudanese family, he came from a home of a politician and was familiar with the grief of losing his father when he was young. He is a man of honor and he has committed his life to the liberation of South Sudan as a member of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement and of the Sudan People's Liberation Army. Nhial joined the SPLA right after its inception in 1983. He was closely associated with the drafting and negotiation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Republic of Sudan and South Sudan, which was signed in Naivasha, Kenya, in January 2005. = Education = Nhial Deng Nhial completed his early education at Comboni College in Khartoum, Sudan. He then entered the University of Khartoum to study law. He graduated in the early 1980s with the degree of Bachelor of Laws (LLB), and earned a Doctor of Laws is a doctoral degree in law(JD) degree from the University of Dundee in the UK in 2008. He is fluent in both English and Arabic. There are South Sudanese media reports, yet unconfirmed, that following the conclusion of the Naivasha Agreement, Nhial Deng Nhial was slated to become the Sudanese Foreign Minister in the Government of National Unity. However following the death of Dr. John Garang in a plane crash in July 2005, Mr. Nhial refused entreaties to serve in Khartoum and opted to work in the nascent Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS).  Role in the government of Southern Sudan  Nhial Deng Nhial was appointed Minister of Regional Affairs in the Southern Sudanese cabinet in 2005 by President Salva Kiir. He however abruptly resigned from the cabinet less than six months later. There has been speculation as to what led to that resignation, with no clear reason being fronted. In 2004, rumors soared across Southern Sudan that John Garang was planning to dismiss Salva Kiir as his deputy and replace him with Nhial Deng Nhial. However, at a meeting of SPLA top brass held in Rumbek, in December 2004, one month before the signing of the CPA, Dr. Garang made it clear that those speculations were just that; only speculations, without any basis for truth. In December 2008, Nhial Deng Nhial was appointed Minister of SPLA and Veterans Affairs by the then President of Southern Sudan, Salva Kiir, replacing General Dominic Dim Deng who died in a plane crash on 2 May 2008. He returned to the South Sudanese cabinet with the military rank of Lieutenant General in the SPLA.Nhial Deng Nhial Rejoins Southern Sudan's Cabinet Following the independence of South Sudan on 9 July 2011, Nhial Deng Nhial was appointed Caretaker Minister of Defense of the Republic of South Sudan. On 26 August 2011, President Salva Kiir Mayardit unveiled his long-awaited cabinet with Mr. Nhial Deng Nhial appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the Republic of South Sudan. In 2020, President Salva Kiir appointed Nhial Deng Nhial as minister of presidential affairs in the Revitalized government of national unity. He is a member of the SPLM's highest organ, the Political Bureau, and served as the leader of the SPLM delegation in Naivasha peace talks.Nhial Deng Nhial Is A High Ranking Party Official In the SPLM Photos *Flickr.com: Photo of Lieutenant General Nhial Deng Nhial, South Sudanese Defense Minister *Another Photo of Lt.

This is achieved by rotating a number of blades, connected to a hub and shaft, and driven by a motor or turbine. The flow rates of these mechanical fans range from approximately to per minute. A blower is another name for a fan that operates where the resistance to the flow is primarily on the downstream side of the fan. Functions and industries There are many uses for the continuous flow of air or gas that industrial fans generate, including combustion, ventilation, aeration, particulate transport, exhaust, cooling, air-cleaning, and drying, to name a few. The industries served include electrical power production, pollution control, metal manufacturing and processing, cement production, mining, petrochemical, food processing, cryogenics, and clean rooms. Centrifugal fans and axial fans Most industrial fans may be categorized into one of two general types: centrifugal fans and axial fans. =Centrifugal= The centrifugal design uses the centrifugal force generated by a rotating disk, with blades mounted at right angles to the disk, to impart movement to the air or gas and increase its pressure. The assembly of the hub, disk and blades is known as the fan wheel, and often includes other components with aerodynamic or structural functions. The centrifugal fan wheel is typically contained within a scroll-shaped fan housing, resembling the shell of the nautilus sea creature with a central hole. The air or gas inside the spinning fan is thrown off the outside of the wheel, to an outlet at the housing's largest diameter. This simultaneously draws more air or gas into the wheel through the central hole . Inlet and outlet ducting are often attached to the fan's housing, to supply and/or exhaust the air or gas to the industry's requirements. There are many varieties of centrifugal fans, which may have fan wheels that range from less than 3 cm to over 16 feet (5 m) in diameter. =Axial= The axial design uses axial forces to achieve the movement of the air or gas, spinning a central hub with blades extending radially from its outer diameter. The fluid is moved parallel to the fan wheel's shaft, or axis of rotation. The axial fan is often contained within a short section of cylindrical ductwork, to which inlet and outlet ducting can be connected. Axial fan types have fan wheels with diameters that usually range from less than a foot (0.3 meters) to over 30 feet (9 m), although axial cooling tower fan wheels may exceed 82 feet (25 m) in diameter. In general, axial fans are used where the principal requirement is for a large volume of flow, and the centrifugal design where both flow and higher pressures are required. Design paths There are several paths to determining a fan design for an application. For industries where the application requirements do not vary greatly and applicable fan designs have diameters of around 4 feet (1.2 meters) or less, a standard or pre-engineered design might be selected. When the application involves more complex specifications or a larger fan, then a design based on an existing model configuration will often satisfy the requirements. Many model configurations already cover the range of current industry processes. An appropriate model from the fan company's catalogue is selected, and the company's engineers apply design rules to calculate the dimensions and select options and material for the desired performance, strength and operating environment. Some applications require a dedicated, custom configuration for a fan design to satisfy all specifications. All industrial fan designs must be accurately engineered to meet performance specifications while maintaining structural integrity. For each application, there are specific flow and pressure requirements. Depending on the application, the fan may be subject to high rotating speeds, an operating environment with corrosive chemicals or abrasive air streams, and extreme temperatures. Larger fans and higher speeds produce greater forces on the rotating structures; for safety and reliability, the design must eliminate excessive stresses and excitable resonant frequencies. Computer modeling programs for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA) are often employed in the design process, in addition to laboratory scale model testing. Even after the fan is built the verification might continue, using fan performance testing for flow and pressure, strain gage testing for stresses and tests to record the fan's resonant frequencies. Fan subtypes Fan types and their subtypes are industry standard, recognized by all major fan producers. =Centrifugal= Any of these fan subtypes can be built with long-lasting erosion-resistant liners. Airfoil (Air foil) ‚Äì Used for a wide range of applications in many industries, fans with hollow, airfoil-profiled blades are designed for use in airstreams where high efficiency and quiet operation are required. They are used extensively for continuous service at ambient and elevated temperatures in forced and induced draft applications in the metals, chemical, power generation, paper, rock products, glass, resource recovery, incineration and other industries throughout the world. Backward curve ‚Äì These fans have efficiencies nearly as high as the airfoil design. An advantage is that their single-thickness, curved plate blades prevent the possibility of dust particle buildup inside the blade, as may occur with perforated airfoil blades. The robust design allows high tip-speed operation, and therefore this fan is often used in high-pressure applications. Backward inclined ‚Äì These fans have simple flat blades, backwardly inclined to match the velocity pattern of the air passing through the fan wheel for high-efficiency operation. These fans are typically used in high-volume, relatively low-pressure, clean air applications. Radial blade ‚Äì The flat blades of this type are arranged in a radial pattern. These rugged fans offer high pressure capability with average efficiency. They are often fitted with erosion-resistant liners to extend rotor life. The housing design is compact to minimize the floor space requirement. Radial tipped ‚Äì These fans have wheels that are backward curved, but in a way slightly different from backward curved fans. Backward curved fans have wheels whose blades curve outward, while radial-tip fans' blades are curved inward and radial at their tips (hence the name \\"radial tip\\"), while still in a backwardly-curved configuration. Their curvature can also be thought of as radial at the tips but gradually sloping toward the direction of rotation. This rugged design is used in high-volume flow rate applications when the pressure requirement is rather high and erosion resistance is necessary. It offers medium efficiencies. A common application is the dirty side of a baghouse or precipitator. The design is more compact than airfoil, backward curved or backward inclined fans. Paddle-wheel ‚Äì This is an open impeller design without shrouds. Although the efficiency is not high, this fan is well suited for applications with extremely high dust loading. It can be offered with field-replaceable blade liners from ceramic tiles or tungsten carbide. This fan may also be used in high-temperature applications. Forward- curve ‚Äì This \\"squirrel cage\\" impeller generates the highest volume flow rate (for a given tip speed) of all the centrifugal fans. Therefore, it often has the advantage of offering the smallest physical package available for a given application. This type of fan is commonly used in high-temperature furnaces. However, these fans can only be used for conveying air with low dust loading because they are the most sensitive to particle build-up, but also due to the large number of blades that forward-curve wheels require. Industrial exhausters ‚Äì This is a relatively inexpensive, medium-duty, steeply inclined flat-bladed fan for exhausting gases, conveying chips, etc. Pre-engineered fans (PE) ‚Äì A series of fans of varying blade shapes that are usually available in only standard sizes. Because they are pre-engineered these fans may be available with relatively short delivery times. Often, pre-engineered rotors with various blade shapes may be installed into a common housing. These are often available in a wide range of volume and pressure requirements to meet the needs of many applications. Pressure blowers ‚Äì These are high- pressure, low-volume blowers used in combustion air applications in furnaces or to provide ‚Äúblow-off‚Äù air for clearing and/or drying applications. Surgeless blowers ‚Äì These high-pressure, low-volume blowers have a reduced tendency for ‚Äúsurging‚Äù (periodic variation of flow rate) even at severely reduced fan speeds. This allows extreme turndown (low-flow) without significant pulsation. Mechanical vapor recovery blowers -These specially designed centrifugal fans are designed to increase temperature and pressure of saturated steam in a closed-loop system. Acid gas blowers - These very heavy construction blowers are suitable for inlet pressures from full vacuum to 100 psig. Materials are selected for corrosion resistance to the gases and particulate handled. Specialty process gas blowers - These blowers are for high pressure petrochemical processes. =Axial= High-temperature axial fans ‚Äì These are high-volume fans designed to operate against low flow resistance in industrial convection furnaces. They may be of either single-direction or bi-directional designs. Extremely rugged, they are most often used in high- temperature furnace (up to 1800 degF) application. Tube axial fans ‚Äì These are axial fan units with fan wheels located in cylindrical tubes, without inlet or outlet dampers. Vaneaxial fans ‚Äì These axial flow fans have a higher pressure capability due to the presence of static vanes. Variable pitch axial fans ‚Äì The blades on these axial fans are manually adjustable to permit the blade angle to be changed. This allows operation over a much wider range of volume/pressure relationships. The blades are adjusted periodically to optimize efficiency by matching the blade pitch to the varying conditions for the application. These fans are often used in mining applications. Variable pitch on-the-fly axial fans ‚Äì These are similar to ‚ÄúVariable Pitch Axial Fans‚Äù except they include an internal mechanism that allows the blade pitch to be adjusted while the fan rotor is in motion. These versatile fans offer high- efficiency operation at many different points of operation. This instantaneous blade adjustment capability is an advantage that is possible with axial fans only. Cooling fans - (also referred to as \\"cooling tower fans\\") - These are axial fans, typically with large diameters, for low pressures and large volumes of airflow. Applications are in wet mechanical cooling towers, air- cooled steam condensers, air-cooled heat exchangers, radiators, or similar air-cooled applications. Mixed-flow fans - The gas flow patterns these fans produce resemble a combination of axial and centrifugal patterns, although the fan wheels often appear similar to centrifugal wheels. There are various types of mixed-flow fans, including gas-tight high-pressure fans and blowers. Flow control There are several means of controlling the flow rate of a fan, e.g., temporarily reducing the air or gas flow rate; these can be applied to both centrifugal and axial fans. Speed Variation - All of the fan types described above can be used in conjunction with a variable speed driver. This might be an adjustable frequency AC controller, a DC motor and drive, a steam turbine driver, or a hydraulic variable speed drive unit (\\"fluid drive\\"). Flow control by means of variable speed is typically smoother and more efficient than by means of damper control. Significant power savings (with reduced cost of operation) are possible if variable speed fan drives are used for applications that require reduced flow operation for a significant portion of the system operating life. Industrial Dampers - These devices also allow fan volumetric flow control during operation, by means of panels so as to direct gas flow or restrict the inlet or outlet areas.

It has a total estimated resource of 6.4 billion tonnes, one quarter of which is high quality coking coal. It is divided into six sections: Tsankhi, Ukhaa Khudag, Bor tolgoi, Borteeg, and Southwest and Eastern coalfields. The Tsankhi section is the largest part, and is divided into East and West Tsankhi - these have had the most focus recently. All of Tavan Tolgoi is owned by Erdenes MGL (a government owned company) except for Ukhaa Khudag section which is mined by the Mongolian Mining Corporation. Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi JSC (Erdenes TT), a subsidiary of Erdenes MGL, is managing the development of East Tsankhi, and the company is due to float on the Hong Kong, London and Ulaanbaatar stock markets in late 2012. Mining of West Tsankhi is planned to be contracted to a consortium of international mining companies ‚Äì a decision is due in late 2012. Tavan Tolgoi is situated at South Gobi desert. Tavan Tolgoi is 15 km SW from Tsogttsetsii sum center, 98 km E from √ñmn√∂govi Province center Dalandzadgad. It is 150 km from Oyu Tolgoi and about 240 km north of the Chinese border.  History  Ger housing at the project Coal truck heading from Tavan Tolgoi to China The Tavan Talgoi deposit was discovered by a Soviet exploration team that included the first Mongolian geologist Jaltsavyn Dugersuren in 1945, and exploratory drilling and feasibility studies continued until 1985. After Mongolia's democratic transition in 1990/91, the government allowed foreign companies to explore the deposit. BHP gained the exploratory rights in the early 1990s; however, they relinquished the rights in the mid-1990s because of financial concerns.Michael Sainsbury, \\"Mongolia heats up the market for coal exports\\", The Australian, September 09, 2010.John Garnaut, \\"Mongolia gears up for mining bonanza\\", Sydney Morning Herald, February 21, 2011. In 2006, the government awarded Energy Resources LLC the mining license over the Ukhaa Khudag section (license MV-11952).Energy Resources LLC, \\"About Us: Company Overview\\", Energy Resources LLC website, accessed March 2011. The government also amended the Minerals Law in 2006 and identified 15 strategic deposits (allowing the government greater ownership of mines), of which Tavan Tolgoi was one. In 2007, the government decided to review the ownership and investment rights over Tavan Tolgoi, and the prime minister (Bayar Sanjaa) proposed to renationalise the deposit - the government would gain 50%, Energy Resources keeping 14% and other investors the remaining 36%.\\"Mongolia to Reconsider Plans for Tavan Tolgoi Coking Coal Project\\", Mining Top News, November 28th 2007. (This was an Associated Press story). Erdenes MGL LLC was formed as a wholly government-owned company in 2007, and later that year the government renationalised Tavan Tolgoi, leaving Energy Resources with the Ukhaa Khudag section.Ariunbold Altankhuyag, \\"New Mongolian Government Announces Seizure of Tavan Tolgoi\\" Mongolia Web, December 19, 2007. The government began negotiations in 2009 with mining companies to give them a 48% stake in Tavan Tolgoi. BHP was initially interested in, but in early 2009 withdrew its bid. After this, Peabody Energy (an American mining company) reportedly approached the government interested in the deposit. In 2010, the Erdenes MGL LLC formed a new company - Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi - which would hold the licenses and manage the Tavan Tolgoi deposit. In July 2010 it was reported that the government had decided to sell 30% of Erdenes TT, keep 40%, give 10% to Mongolian citizens and 20% to Mongolian companies.John Duce, 'Mongolia Plans to Offer 30% Tavan Tolgoi Company (Update1)\\", Bloomberg, July 8, 2010. However, in 2011 the government announced plans for an IPO of 29% of Erdenes TT, and to continue to give 10% of the shares to citizens and reduce from 20% to 10% the amount given to Mongolian companies, with the government to hold the remaining 51%. The money raised from the IPO would be used to fund the development of East Tsankhi, while West Tsankhi would be sold to a mining consortia. Sections = East and West Tsankhi = The Tsankhi section is the largest in the Tavan Tolgoi deposit, and there are plans to develop both East and West Tsankhi, although both developments have been surrounded by confusion and delays. There is often a misunderstanding that the title ‚ÄòTavan Tolgoi‚Äô refers to the Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi development in Tsankhi, since this is the largest and highest profile area in the entire coal deposit; however Tavan Tolgoi covers a much larger area.  West Tsankhi  The West Tsankhi section of the Tavan Tolgoi coal deposit has been in operation since 1967, as a small coal mine. It supplied coal to the Mongolian domestic market, but in August 2011, started exporting coal to China In 2009 in order to maximize the mine's production, the Mongolian government put the mine up for international companies and consortia. Six companies were shortlisted ‚Äì Shenhua Group, ArcelorMittal, Kores, Peabody Energy, Vale S.A., Xstrata among others. In July 2011 it was reported that the government had awarded the contract to mine West Tsankhi to China's Shenhua Group, a Russian-led consortium, and US miner Peabody Energy Corporation. However, in August, officials said that no decision had been finalised, and now a final decision on it is not due until later in 2012. Recently, Dr Graeme Hancock (COO of ETT) cited the difficulty in managing the multiple companies interested in the consortium.  East Tsankhi  The East Tsankhi section is fully owned by Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi, who chose the Macmahon Holdings and BBM Operta joint venture to mine the site. The contract is for five years, from 2012-2017 and is worth US$500 million. Production from the mine is expected to be 3 million tonnes in 2012 and reaching a maximum production of 15 million tonnes per year once the mine and its associated infrastructure is built, with a total value over five years of US$2 billion. In September 2012 it was reported that the mine was on track to extract 3.5 million tonnes of coal In 2010 the Mongolian government decided on a plan to float 30% of Erdenes TT in an IPO on the Hong Kong, London and Ulaanbaatar stock exchanges; however this was later reduced to 20% in January 2012. The IPO was intended to occur in 2011, but was postponed to late 2012 or early 2013. In addition, 10% of the Erdenes TT will be sold to local companies, 10% will be distributed in shares to every Mongolian citizen, and the government will retain the remaining share in the company. There is speculation that the Hong Kong listing may be dropped, but this has been denied by the company = Ukhaa Khudag = Ukhaa Khudag section The Ukhaa Khudag section of Tavan Tolgoi deposit covers an area of 2,960 ha and has reserves of 581 million tonnes. It is owned and mined by the Mongolian Mining Corporation (formerly Energy Resources LLC); they were granted a mining license in August 2006, and began mining in April 2009. MMC has contracted Leighton Asia to conduct mining operations at the site. Production at the mine has increased to 2.1 million tonnes in the first quarter of 2012. MMC constructed a road from Ukhaa Khudag to the Gashuun Sukhait border crossing (finished in October 2011). The road charges other mining companies a fee for use - there are now concerns that trucks are avoiding the toll and driving parallel to it, causing erosion and pollution issues. In 2012, MMC announced plans to construct a railway from Ukhaa Khudag to the Gashuun Sukhait border crossing, to be completed in 2015. While that particular plan apparently did not come to fruition, the railway along the same or similar route was said to be under construction as of 2014, with the estimated completion date in late 2016. A special vote of the Mongolian Parliament made it possible to construct this railway on the 1435 mm standard gauge (for a seamless connection with China's railway network), rather than on the 1520 mm Russian gauge used elsewhere in Mongolia.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. History King of Prussia Inn as it appeared circa 1919 prior to restoration and relocation The original inn was constructed as a cottage in 1719 by the Welsh Quakers William and Janet Rees, founders of nearby Reesville. The cottage was converted to an inn in 1769 and was important in colonial times as it was approximately a day's travel by horse from Philadelphia. A number of settlers heading from there for Ohio would sleep at the inn for their first night on the road. In 1774 the Rees family hired James Barry (or Jimmy Berry) to run the inn, which henceforth became known as \\"Berry's Tavern\\". General George Washington first visited the tavern on Thanksgiving Day in 1777 while the Continental Army was encamped at Whitemarsh; a few weeks later Washington and the army bivouacked at nearby Valley Forge. A map created by William Parker, an American Loyalist, listed the inn as \\"Berry's\\" in 1777, but a local petition in 1786 identified it as the \\"King of Prussia\\". It was possibly renamed to entice German soldiers fighting in the American Revolution to remain in this area. At some point a wooden signboard of the inn depicted King Frederick the Great of Prussia. The inn was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on December 23, 1975. Diary of Johann Conrad D√∂hla The King of Prussia Inn is mentioned in a 1778 entry from the diary of Johann Conrad D√∂hla, a soldier from Ansbach-Bayreuth who fought on the British side during the war: Relocation The inn was forced to move with the expansion of U.S. Route 202. U.S. 202 is a major north-south highway that passes through the town from southwest to northeast. Its construction as a modern expressway would have caused the destruction of the King of Prussia Inn; however, historic preservationists managed to prevail upon the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to avoid this structure by building north and southbound lanes on either side of it. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania acquired the property on which the inn was located in 1952. For more than 50 years the inn was marooned on an artificial island, with cars and trucks roaring past it on all sides. It was sealed up for years, surrounded by a high fence. The inn was successfully relocated on August 20, 2000 and opened to the public in October 2002. The King of Prussia Chamber of Commerce (now the Montgomery County Chamber of Commerce) has occupied the building since the restoration.

Early life Wilfred Whiteley was born in 1882 in Salendine Nook, a district in Huddersfield, Yorkshire. Whiteley attended Padock Board School in Huddersfield until the age of 12. After leaving school he worked at Willans wool warehouse for 18 and a half years. Whiteley briefly worked part- time at the Advertiser Press when he was aged 18. Whiteley had a strong interest in politics and was involved with the administrative side of politics from 1911 until 1925 as secretary of the Lockwood Independent Labour Party. Politics From 1914 to 1918 Whiteley, as an anti-militarist and staunch socialist, took a leading part in opposition in Huddersfield to the Great War, and was a conscientious objector. He had the desire to succeed in politics, and was supported by the Independent Labour Party as he stood for election in Colne Valley in the 1918 ‚ÄòKhaki‚Äô election, representing the Labour Party. Whiteley was unsuccessful in his attempt, but was commended for his honesty whilst campaigning, as he highlighted to the electorate that he had been a conscientious objector. This was a crucial factor in his failure at the ballot box, as soldiers returning from the battlefields were highly revered, whereas conscientious objectors were often accused of cowardice. After defeat in the 1918 election Whiteley worked as Publications Manager for the National Labour Press in Manchester. Whiteley was invited to stand for election again in Colne Valley in the 1921 election, but he eventually declined the offer, as he was unemployed and beset by financial worries. In 1925 Whiteley moved to Birmingham, where he was Labour Party agent and secretary for Oswald Mosley in Smethwick, Staffordshire. In his role as Mosley's secretary Whiteley was responsible for helping to organise Mosley's meetings and engagements in the wider area. Whiteley was in regular contact with G.T. Sutton, who was the Private Secretary of Oswald Mosley, based in London. Elected to Parliament From 1929 to 1931 Whiteley was Labour Member of Parliament for Birmingham Ladywood, replacing the Conservative Neville Chamberlain, who stood elsewhere. After defeat in 1931 he became Labour Party constituency agent for Birmingham West (UK Parliament constituency) in 1932‚Äì1936.

They are conducted concurrently with Norwegian county elections. The last municipal and council elections were held on 9 September 2019. Norway holds elections every two years, alternating between local elections and national parliamentary elections. Municipal elections were first held in Norway in 1837.Valghistorie (Election history) Part 4 of the \\"election school\\" ahead of the 2007 election. Geir Helljesen, NRK Suffrage The electorate includes all Norwegian citizens of age 18 or higher (must be at least 18 by the end of the year), and who reside, or who have resided in Norway. In addition, other residents who have lived continuously in Norway for the preceding three years may vote. Residents of Norway who are citizens of another Nordic country need only to have been resident in Norway on 30 June in the year of the election in order to be allowed to vote. The voter's residency as of 30 June determines which municipality and election the voter will vote in. Ballots An election booth with ballots lined up for the voter (picture is from an early voting station). White ballots are used in the municipal election, the blue are for the county. In general, each political party who participates in an election for a particular municipality nominates a list of names which appear on the ballot. It is possible for parties to cooperate on a single ballot however. For the municipality elections, the ballots are printed on white paper, distinguishing them from the blue ballots used in the county election. Both municipality and county ballots are kept in the voting booth at the polling stations. The ballot itself consists of a list of names, each with a checkbox beside it. Candidates given priority by the party are entered in bold. Voters are allowed to give \\"personal votes\\" (personstemme) to people on the ballot by putting a mark next to their name. Also on the ballot is a table allowing voters to write in candidates who are running for another party. Voters can give personal votes to candidates on other ballots (so called \\"danglers\\") by entering the candidate's name in the table. After the voter has selected the ballots, and making whatever adjustments desired, the voter folds the ballot together, hiding the information on the inside, thereby keeping the vote secret. An election official checks the person's identity and stamps the ballot, validating it, before it is inserted into the election box. The system with folded and stamped ballots has been criticized, because studies show that about 10% of voters fold the ballot the wrong way, exposing rather than hiding their choice. This can lead to suspicions that this \\"mistake\\" is sometimes done intentionally in a scheme of electoral fraud. If someone \\"buys\\" a vote, the bought voter can \\"accidentally\\" reveal his choice to confirm that she or he upheld his or her part of the deal. Utilizing envelopes to increase the security of the elections has been suggested.Bare sett toppen av isfjellet (\\"Only seen the tip of the iceberg\\") Criticism is by electoral researcher Frank Aarebrot, in context with alleged improprieties in the 2007 election in Drammen. P4, September 24, 2007 Determining seat allocation The apportionment of seats between the parties is done by St Lag√ºes modified method, described below. The number of votes each party received is counted. Due to the transferral of votes due to the danglers, the number of votes may well be fractions. Danglers are personal votes given to a candidate although the voter voted for another party. A voter who has given a dangler transfers a portion of the vote to the other party. So if there are 30 seats in the council, and a person votes Labor but writes in a personal vote to a person on the Conservative list, Labor gets 29/30 of a vote, while the Conservative list gets 1/30 of a vote. Quotients are determined by dividing the number of votes each party received by 1.4, then by 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on. The quotients are then ranked from largest to smallest. The party boasting the highest quotient is given the first seat, the one with the second highest the second, and so on until all the seats have been distributed. This gives approximately a proportional representation in the council. Personal votes and priority candidates After the number of seats won by a list for the council is determined, the number of personal votes received, whether directly from someone supporting the list, or from danglers, by each candidate determines which ones will take the seats. Parties wishing to give priority to particular candidates may do so, and they will receive what amounts to a quarter personal vote per person voting for their party. In the case of a tie, the order in which the candidate stands on the ballot determines who is elected.

Amcom acquired a telecommunications carrier licence in 1998 and began building a fibre optic network. In 2009 Amcom won the Best Telecommunications Company of the Year 2009 - Australian Telecommunications Magazine. In December 2014, the board of Amcom approved the acquisition of the group by Vocus for AU$653 million. In April 2015, rival TPG Telecom increased its shareholder stake in Amcom to 18.6 per cent in an attempt to block the merger. TPG eventually built its stake to 19.9 per cent of Amcom. In response, a campaign to persuade at least 75 per cent of shareholders to vote in favour of the merger was launched by both Amcom and Vocus. On June 15, 2015, the merger went ahead after 77 percent of Amcom shareholders voted in favour of the merger. In July 2015 the $1.2 billion merger between Amcom and Vocus was formally completed. On June 29, 2015, CEO Clive Stein resigned after a 16-year career with the company to make way for incoming Vocus CEO Spenceley to take over the combined group. Executive director and founder Spenceley and non-executive director Tony Grist left the board of Vocus in October 2016 after a failed leadership succession proposal. In February 2018 CEO Geoff Horth left the company. In March 2018 M2 Group Founding MD and CEO Vaughan Bowen stepped away from the role of Non- Executive Chairman of the Vocus Board to increase Board independence, and former Telstra Chairman and founding CEO of Optus, Robert Mansfield AO was made Chairman. Michael Simmons became Interim CEO until the appointment of Kevin Russell on 28 May 2018. In April 2018, Vocus announced it had decided not to sell off the NZ portion of the business as an acceptable offer had not been received. =Vocus acquisitions= Vocus has made several acquisitions to extend its product and service offering. In 2014, Vocus purchased a data centre from ASG Group for $11.7 million. In 2014 it also acquired Bentley data centre in Perth from IT provider ASG for $11.7m. The same year, it acquired FX Networks, a New Zealand-based fibre provider which services many of New Zealand's major organisations including many government agencies, telco carriers, ISPs and enterprises. In 2015, it acquired Enterprise Data Corporation, including two Sydney and Melbourne based data centres for $23.5 million. In 2015, Vocus acquired a 10% stake in the SEA-ME-WE 3 Cable from Telecom NZ, increasing the company's investment in Western Australia. * Vocus Communications ** ** Switch Utilities, up front, and a provisionally deferred amount of ** Nextgen Networks, North-West Cable System and ASC, ** M2 Group, ** Amcom, ** Enterprise Data Corporation ** Bentley Data Centre ** FX Networks, ** iBOSS International and One Telecom, ** Ipera Communications, ** Maxnet and DataLock, ** Digital River Networks, ** Perth International Exchange, ** , E3 Networks (Sydney and Melbourne), = Amcom acquisitions = In September 2005, Amcom acquired the customers of Perth Internet service provider Arachnet for A$1.6 million, adding 5,200 broadband and 2,100 dial-up customers to their user base, increasing Amcom's total broadband numbers to 7,500.

She was the first person to be found guilty of making false statements under the Representation of the People Act 1983, having made false allegations of paedophilia against her political opponent, Barry Smith, during an election campaign. Grell was banned for holding public office for three years as a result. She subsequently trained to become a barrister and was called to the Bar in 2014.Miranda Grell wins Reita Clarke Memorial Award 2014  Hackney Community Law Centre Early life Grell was born in 1978 to parents from Dominica who had moved to Britain in 1973. She says she had no relationship with her father. She attended Walthamstow School for Girls, studied European studies with modern languages at the University of Manchester, gaining a first class honours degree, and took a master's degree in industrial relations from the London School of Economics. Politics Grell joined the Labour Party in 1999 having been persuaded to do so by her friend and fellow student Chuka Umunna,OBV Profile: Miranda Grell  OBV who became an MP in 2010. At the time she stood in the Waltham Forest local election, she worked as a senior policy adviser to the conciliation service Acas. She had previously worked as a trainee speech writer for Anna Diamantopoulou. Following her election to the council, she went to work as a researcher for the then deputy mayor of London, Nicky Gavron. She served on the management committee of the pressure group Compass from June 2005 until her resignation from the committee on 30 November 2007. Grell was also a school governor. 2006 local election controversy Grell was elected in the May 2006 local elections for the Leyton ward of Waltham Forest London Borough Council. The ward returned three councillors, two Liberal Democrats and one Labour, Grell, in the third position.2006 Leyton results on Waltham Forest council website In 2002, Leyton had returned three Liberal Democrats. Grell gained the seat when the Liberal Democrats made gains in the borough.Local elections: Waltham Forest; BBC News, 5 May 2006 However, in September 2007, she went on trial on charges under the Representation of the People Act 1983 of making a false statement of fact about a candidate's personal character or conduct for electoral advantage, specifically that she made allegations of paedophilia against her gay Liberal Democrat opponent, Barry Smith. In addition to losing his seat Smith stated he was verbally abused in the street, spat at, and forced to relocate to the north of England as a result of the false allegations, fearing for his life. Grell admitted to outing her opponent and falsely claiming he had a 19-year-old Thai boyfriend (Smith's partner was actually 39 and Malaysian), though she denied making the false allegations of paedophilia to four residents. Witnesses against Grell included a Labour voter and also another Labour candidate for her ward, Nicholas Russell. On 21 September 2007, she was found guilty on two counts, fined ¬£1,000 and ordered to pay ¬£3,000 towards the prosecution costs. On 24 October 2007, Grell's supporters launched a campaign to finance her appeal, but it was later reported that the Labour Party would pay her legal costs. Labour then withdrew this support. On 27 November, The Independent newspaper quoted a party spokesman: \\"Following legal advice in the last few days, the Labour Party today withdrew its support for Miranda Grell's appeal.\\" Criticism was levelled at the party for supporting Grell's appeal, in particular by gay rights campaigner and former Labour candidate Peter Tatchell. Grell's appeal hearing began on 28 November 2007 at Snaresbrook Crown Court before Judge Peter Birts QC and two lay magistrates. On 30 November, Grell's conviction for making false statements about another candidate to gain electoral advantage was upheld. She vacated her seat and was banned from holding public office for three years. The by-election for Leyton ward on 14 February 2008 was won by Liberal Democrat Winnie Smith. Following the appeal verdict, Grell resigned from the Labour Party, from her job working for the deputy mayor of London, and from the management committee of the Compass pressure group, but still claimed innocence, continuing to do so years afterwards. Grell lodged a first application with the Criminal Cases Review Commission in 2009, assisted by Lord Gifford QC.\\"At the bar: Taking each day as it comes\\".

The BTA was active from 2005 until its closure in 2011. The agency aimed to foster business operations support for the American warfighter and seeks to provide accountability to the American taxpayer by systematically improving DoD‚Äôs business processes, ERP systems and investment governance. Aiming to provide consistency, consolidation and coordination across the Department of Defense, the BTA produces the Enterprise Transition Plan (ETP)‚Äîan integrated and executable roadmap that observes the standards laid out in the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA). The ETP and the BEA aimed to transform DoD business operations to achieve improved warfighter support while enabling financial accountability across the Department of Defense. The Business Transformation Agency was established by Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon R. England on October 7, 2005. The founding executives of the BTA were Co- Directors Thomas Modly, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Financial Management, and Paul Brinkley, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Business Transformation; Director of Transformation Planning and Performance, David Fisher; Director of Transformation Priorities and Requirements, Radha Sekar; Director; Director of Investment Management, Paul Ketrick; Director of Warfighter Support, Bob Love; Director of Information and Federation Management, David Scantling; and Director of Agency Operations, Navy Captain Michael Murphy. In August 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates directed the inactivation of the BTA. The disestablishment of the agency was to be completed by September 2011. In his speech, Secretary Gates said \\"The Business Transformation Agency was formally established in 2006 to foster the reform and modernization of this department's business practices. Since its creation, BTA, an agency that now employs approximately 360 people and spends $340 million a year, has shifted more of its focus to day-to-day oversight of individual acquisition programs, a function that can be performed by a number of other organizations. Furthermore, the mission assigned to BTA has largely been legislatively assigned to other elements of the department.\\"http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4669 Business transformation In the last decades of the 20th century, the Department of Defense business model was configured to support a military dependent on large-scale weapons systems and prepared for sustained, predictable battlefield engagements in specific parts of the world. With the challenges that face the U.S. military in the 21st century, the DoD established the Business Transformation Agency to allow the defense business enterprise to adapt, flex, and react effectively to the needs of its modern joint warfighter. Transformation seeks to make DoD business operations more agile, lean and rapid. The Department called its approach to this need for transformation ‚Äúfederated‚Äù‚Äîmeaning that uniformed and civilian leadership at all levels in the DoD were considered accountable for transformation progress. This effort was announced to be structured to support four strategic objectives: * Develop and provide support for U.S. joint warfighting capability * Enable rapid access to information for strategic decisions by fostering the development of interoperable and efficient ERP systems * Reduce the cost of Defense Business operations * Improve financial stewardship to the American people The Defense Business Systems Management Committee, chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, led the Transformation endeavor. The BTA was intended to serve as a catalyst for transformation by coordinating and integrating transformation activity at the DoD enterprise level. As of 2020, the Defense Business Systems Management Committee still functions to oversee development and management of business systems within the DoD. Organization The BTA was divided into 8 directorates organized around the functions of supporting defense business transformation. Overseeing these directorates was Director David M. Fisher, author of Optimize Now (or else!) (), a guide to successful organizational transformation. =Defense Business Systems Acquisition Executive= The DBSAE provided direct oversight of 27 department-wide ERP programs. Notable among these programs are the Defense Travel System (DTS), the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS) and the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP). =Enterprise Integration= EI worked to ensure fast adoption of DoD-wide information and process standards as defined in the BEA. They sought to eliminate burdensome processes that hinder successful, speedy deployment of ERP capabilities within the DoD components. =Enterprise Planning and Investment= EP&I; provided investment management leadership for DoD Enterprise-level business systems. It coordinates the efforts of DoD's acquisition policy as outlined in the DoD 5000 series pertaining to business systems. The Directorate also provides input for the Quadrennial Defense Review. EP&I; is responsible for the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), the Enterprise Transition Plan (ETP), and the March Congressional Report (MCR). EP&I; was the result of a merger of the former directorates Transformation Priorities & Requirements and Investment Management. =Priorities & Requirements ‚Äì Financial Management= P&R-FM; was the primary link to the Principal Staff Assistants within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and other DoD-level organizations; in particular the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) and Office of the Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). They ensured that the financial visibility priorities and requirements of these client organizations are reflected in the BEA and ETP, and in the guidance for business system investment management. =Priorities & Requirements ‚Äì Human Resource Management= P&R-HRM; was the primary link to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) regarding all human resource management related transformation activities. They aligned functional priorities and requirements of these client organizations in the BEA and ETP, and in the guidance for business system investment management. =Priorities & Requirements ‚Äì Supply Chain Management= P&R-SCM; served as the primary link to the Principal Staff Assistants within the Office of the Secretary of Defense and other DoD-level organizations as they relate to Supply Chain Management. They ensure that functional priorities Material Visibility, Common Supplier Engagement, Acquisition Visibility, and Real Property Accountability are reflected in the BEA and the ETP, and in the guidance for business system investment management. =Warfighter Requirements= WR identified and resolved urgent DoD business issues that are directly affecting the troops. The WR also serves as an advocate for soldiers within the BTA. WR projects included economic roundtables that brought together organizations responsible for Mideast economic redevelopment with personnel who are about to be deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. These roundtables established a working relationship that can be continued once they are deployed. =Chief of Staff= The office of the Chief of Staff provided operational support for the employees at the BTA. This included sections managing personnel, pay, planning, budgeting, infrastructure, IT, and internal management activities.

Even after US Highway 41 was completed heavy agricultural truck traffic continued to use the bridge. This led the bridge being condemned in the late 1950s, and closed. After the bridge was closed, it fell into a severe state of disrepair.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the deanery of Macclesfield. It forms a team parish with three other Macclesfield churches: All Saints, St Peter's and St Barnabas'. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. A church has been on the site since the 13th century. There have been two major reconstructions, the last being in 1898‚Äì1901. Two ancient chapels remain dating from the 15th and 16th centuries. Inside the church are a number of tombs and memorials, mainly to the memory of the Savage and Legh families. History The first church on this site was a chapel built around 1220, soon after the borough of Macclesfield was established. Around 1278 it was extended or rebuilt by Queen Eleanor, wife of Edward I and dedicated to All Saints or All Hallows. A chapel, known as the Legh chapel, was built around 1442 for Sir Piers Legh who fought and died at the Battle of Agincourt. Between 1505 and 1507 the Savage Chapel, a larger chantry chapel, was built by Thomas Savage, Archbishop of York from 1501 to 1507. There have since been a number of reconstructions of the church. In 1739‚Äì40 it was rebuilt in neoclassical style and at this time it is likely that the church was rededicated to Saint Michael. In 1740 the wooden tower was taken down because it was considered dangerous. In 1819 the east end was rebuilt and a new chancel added. The last major rebuilding was in 1898‚Äì1901 by Arthur Blomfield when the whole church, other than part of the chancel and the Legh and Savage chapels, were replaced. A further reordering, known as \\"Open Door\\" Phase 1, took place between June 2003 and May 2004 to provide a welcome area (narthex), meeting rooms and an office at the west end. A second phase followed in which the room to the southeast of the building was equipped as a Youth Centre. As part of the \\"Open Door Reordering\\", extensive repair work was carried out to the church roof and to the church organ which was completely dismantled, cleaned, repaired and re- built.. The architectural works were carried out by Barlow, Wright and Phelps, of Buxton, Derbyshire. Architecture =Exterior= The plan of the church consists of a six-bay nave with north and south aisles and a chancel with vestries to the north and south. The tower is at the west end of the south aisle. The Legh Chapel extends from the south aisle and the larger Savage Chapel is to the east of this. At the west end of the Savage Chapel is a porch surmounted by a tower. The main tower incorporates some of the earlier masonry and includes some of the original carved stones and heraldic shields representing local noble families. On its west face is a clock and beneath this is a niche containing statues representing the Virgin and Child, Saint John and Saint James. =Interior= Furnishings The font consists of a baluster and a fluted bowl dated 1744. The reredos, altar table, and communion rail dating from 1946 were designed by Sir Charles Nicholson. Behind this reredos is an older one from 1820, in Gothic style, containing arcades with ogee heads. The pulpit dates from 1876 and contains carvings of apostles. The wardens' pew is Jacobean in style. Two chandeliers are present, one dated 1882, the other was donated in 1744 and remodelled in 1822. In the porch of the Savage Chapel are fragments of medieval glass. The east window, dating from 1901, and the west window from 1902 (the latter depicting Queen Victoria), are by Powells. On the north side of the church are windows by Kempe, and by Burlison and Grylls. The Legh Chapel contains glass by Shrigley and Hunt dated 1903. On the northeast of the nave is glass by Christopher Whall, from about 1910, and by Paul Woodroffe. In the Savage Chapel the glass is all by Morris & Co., dating from the early 20th century. The two-manual organ was made by Percy Daniel and Company. There is a ring of 12 bells, all cast in 1923 by John Taylor and Company. Chapels and monuments The major points of interest in the church are the chapels and the monuments. The church contains \\"the finest collection of alabaster effigies in Cheshire\\". The smaller Legh Chapel, built around 1422 and rebuilt in 1620, is now used as a baptistry. It contains a number of memorial brasses, including one to William Legh who died in 1630. In the Savage Chapel is the Pardon Brass in memory of Roger Legh who died in 1506. This was in three parts, one showing Roger kneeling with his six sons, and one showing the Mass of Saint Gregory; the other part, which is missing, is thought to have shown Roger's wife with their seven daughters. Its inscription shows that for five Paternosters, five Aves and one Creed, an indulgence will be given for 26,000 years and 26 days in purgatory. St Michael's Church from Macclesfield railway station Many of the tombs and memorials represent members of the Savage family and a high proportion of these have the forename of John. The tomb of Sir John Savage who died in 1597 and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Manners, are in the Savage Chapel. On the tomb are their recumbent effigies with Elizabeth, who was the daughter of the Earl of Rutland, at a higher level to reflect her superior rank. Above them is a canopy on which are two female figures. It was this John Savage who built the great mansion of Rocksavage near Runcorn. To the south of this tomb is a white alabaster tombstone which is thought to be in memory of George Savage, chancellor of the diocese of Chester who died in 1552. Also in the chapel is the effigy of a civilian, showing the head and shoulders and the feet, the centre being left as plain masonry. In the southeast corner of the chapel is the tomb of Sir John Savage who died in 1528 and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester. In the apse of the chapel are a damaged piscina and aumbry, and a squint giving a view of the main altar. The altar in the chapel is the original one in stone. In the north wall of the chapel, between the chapel and the nave of the church, are two more tombs with effigies. One is Sir John Savage, the elder brother of Archbishop Savage. He had been a commander at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 and was killed at a siege of Boulogne in 1492. The other is the tomb of his son, John Savage, who died in 1527 and who was Sheriff of Worcestershire for 24 years. On the south side of the sanctuary is the tomb of Sir John Savage, who died in 1495, and his wife Katherine, daughter of Thomas Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley. This is considered to be the finest tomb in the church and contains recumbent alabaster effigies of the couple. On the south side of the sanctuary is another fine alabaster monument of a knight in armour which is known as the Downes effigy. This is thought to represent one of the Downes of Shrigley. At the east end of the south aisle is the tomb of Thomas Savage, 3rd Earl Rivers, who died in 1694. He is depicted in a robe with a wig, semi- reclining under a marble canopy which is supported by Corinthian columns. External features In the churchyard is a sundial dating probably from the 18th century. It consists of a baluster-pedestal on a stone base. It is listed at Grade II.

His mother gave him the keys while his father was away, but the piano ended up as firewood one winter's evening. During his childhood, Mseleku suffered the loss of the upper joints of two fingers in his right hand from a go-karting accident. He explained in a 1994 South Bank Show dedicated to him that this was wholly due to the restricted health care available to Black South Africans under Apartheid. Mseleku started his musical career in Johannesburg in 1975 as an electric organ player for an R&B; band, Spirits Rejoice.Note: The sources used for outlining Mseleku's career in the late 1970s are contradictory. After performing at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1977, Mseleku settled in Botswana for a time, moved to London, England, in the late 1970s, and made an attempt to settle into the jazz scene in Stockholm from 1980 to 1983, but then returned to London.

The original lineup consisted of vocalist Kousei, Hisui and Syo~ji on guitars and drummer Rin. In May of the same year, they were joined by Zero on bass guitar. Their first single, higyaku no shiro, was released in December. In 2005, Ghost lost two of its members; Syo~ji and Rin. Shortly after, they were joined by Yu on drums and Yura (ex-Devil Kitty)Ghost on Grass Thread on guitar. However, Yu quit the band in November 2005. The band continued to play with several support drummers, while releasing their first mini-album, Bi-zarre Collector. In 2005 Ghost also performed their first one- man concert, at Takadanobaba Arena.

Vack√°≈ô credited Radioslavia with developing this circuit in 1945. A Vack√°≈ô oscillator is a wide range variable frequency oscillator (VFO) that strives for a near constant output amplitude over its frequency range. It is similar to a Colpitts oscillator or a Clapp oscillator, but those designs do not have a constant output amplitude when tuned. Invention In 1949, the Czech engineer Ji≈ô√≠ Vack√°≈ô published a paper on the design of stable variable- frequency oscillators (VFO). The paper discussed many stability issues such as variations with temperature, atmospheric pressure, component aging, and microphonics. For example, Vack√°≈ô describes making inductors by first heating the wire and then winding the wire on a stable ceramic coil form. The resulting inductor has a temperature coefficient of 6 to 8 parts per million per degree Celsius. Vack√°≈ô points out that common air variable capacitors have a stability of 2 parts per thousand; to build a VFO with a stability of 50 parts per million requires that the variable capacitor is only 1/40 of the tuning capacity (.002/40 = 50ppm). The stability requirement also implies the variable capacitor may only tune a limited range of 1:1.025. Larger tuning ranges require switching stable fixed capacitors or inductors.Modern low phase noise voltage controlled oscillators use bank switching. Vack√°≈ô was interested in high stability designs, so he wanted the highest for his circuits. It is possible to make wide range VFOs with stable output amplitude by heavily damping (loading) the tuned circuit, but that tactic substantially reduces the and the frequency stability., \\"Although it is possible by means of proper damping to obtain a variable quality factor and a constant amplitude, this is not convenient because it would reduce the frequency stability.\\"There is an insertion loss issue that Vack√°≈ô ignores. Vack√°≈ô was also concerned with the amplitude variations of the variable-frequency oscillator as it is tuned through its range. Ideally, an oscillator's loop gain will be unity according to the Barkhausen stability criterion. In practice, the loop gain is adjusted to be a little more than one to get the oscillation started; as the amplitude increases, some gain compression then causes the loop gain to average out over a complete cycle to unity. If the VFO frequency is then adjusted, the gain may increase substantially; the result is more gain compression is needed, and that affects both the output amplitude of the VFO and its frequency stability. Vack√°≈ô reviewed several existing circuits for their amplitude stability. In his analysis, Vack√°≈ô made several assumptions. He assumed the tuned circuit has a constant quality factor () over the VFO's frequency range; this assumption implies that the tank's effective resistance increases linearly with frequency (). The Clapp oscillator's transconductance is proportional to . If the Clapp transconductance is set to just oscillate at the lowest frequency, then the oscillator will be overdriven at its highest frequency. If the frequency changed by a factor of 1.5, then the loop gain at the high end would be 3.375 times higher; this higher gain requires significant compression. Vack√°≈ô concluded that the Clapp oscillator \\"can only be used for operation on fixed frequencies or at the most over narrow bands (max. about 1:1.2).\\" In contrast, the Seiler (tapped capacitor) and Lampkin (tapped inductor) oscillators have a transconductance requirement that is proportional to œâ‚àí1. Vack√°≈ô then describes an oscillator circuit due to Radioslavia in 1945 that maintained \\"a comparatively constant amplitude over a wide frequency range.\\" Vack√°≈ô reports that VFO circuit being used by the Czechoslovak Post Office since 1946. Vack√°≈ô analyzes the circuit and explains how to get an approximately constant amplitude response. The circuit's transconductance increases linearly with frequency, but that increase is offset by the tuning inductor's increasing . This circuit has become known as the Vack√°≈ô VFO. Vack√°≈ô referred to the circuit as \\"our circuit\\" and states that O. Landini independently discovered the circuit and published it (without an analysis) in Radio Rivista in 1948. citing Vack√°≈ô describes a VFO design using this circuit that covers a modest frequency range of 1:1.17. Vack√°≈ô then describes a variation of the Radioslavia circuit that can cover a frequency range of 1:2.5 or even 1:3. This circuit tries to compensate for some variation in over the useful range of the VCO. Vack√°≈ô patented this new circuit and two variations of it. Circuit operation The schematic above is the equivalent of Fig. 5 in his paper (Radioslavia design), redrawn for the use of a junction FET. and the capacitors form the resonant circuit of a Colpitts oscillator, and capacitors and also serve as the grid voltage divider. The circuit can be tuned with . Example values are from his paper. It is similar to an earlier Seiler oscillator, the difference is that in Seiler's the is connected to the other side of . Vack√°≈ô based his design on stability analysis of Gouriet-Clapp (Vack√°≈ô claims it is for fixed frequency or a very narrow band, max 1:1.2), Seiler and Lampkin oscillators (in the Lampkin's, an inductive voltage divider on the tuned circuit coil is used instead , , and of Seiler's; schematics in the 1st ref). The oscillator's stability is due largely to the dependency of the tube's (or transistor's) forward transconductance on the resonant frequency () of the tuned circuit. Specifically, Vack√°≈ô found that forward transconductance varied as for the Clapp oscillator, as for the Seiler oscillator, and as for his design, where the factor of the coil () increases with . The conditions for a forward tranconductance that varies minimally with respect to œâ are met when: :: C_a \\\\gg C_0 \\\\gg C_v, and :: C_g \\\\gg C_v and the of the resonator increases in proportion to , which is often approximated by real-world inductors.

The locks are substantially built with stone blocks, and unusually for narrow locks have mitre gates at both ends. They were each built with a side pond, which enabled some of the water to be re-used during a filling and emptying cycle. The side ponds have been disused for many years, but there are plans to reinstate one of them for demonstration purposes. History The Macclesfield Canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained in April 1826, after the civil engineer Thomas Telford had produced two reports and estimated that the canal could be built for ¬£295,000. He also selected which of the contractors who tendered for the job should be awarded the contract, but his involvement then ceased, and the construction was supervised by William Crosley, the resident engineer. The quality of the workmanship was excellent, and by the time the canal opened on 9 November 1831, the total cost was only slightly more than the estimate, at ¬£320,000. Like many of Telford's designs, it used cuttings and embankments to maintain as straight and level a course as possible, and this enabled all the locks to be built as a single flight, although there was also a stop lock where the canal joined the Hall Green Branch of the Trent and Mersey Canal at Hall Green. The contractors who built the locks were called Nowell and Sons. When the canal was opened, there was also a stop lock at Marple Junction where it joined the Peak Forest Canal, but this stop lock has long since been degated, and only a narrow section with remains of the A-frames betrays its former existence. When built, the flight was designed to be operated by two lock keepers. One had a cottage at the top of the flight near lock 1, and the other near lock 11. The top cottage is still there, but the bottom one has been demolished. The locks are built out of large stone blocks, and these were quarried near the bottom of the flight. Although there is no trace of it now, it is thought that a tramway brought the blocks from the quarry to the locks. In the 1950s, a reservoir was built in the disused quarry. Route A hire boat in lock 4. The frame for the side pond paddles can be seen near the back of the boat. From Buglawton, on the northern edge of Congleton, the canal runs along the south bank of the River Dane for , before crossing the river on an aqueduct, and then climbing up the side of the valley. The twelve locks are spread over a distance of just , and raise the level of the canal by to the contour, which it then follows to Marple Junction. The locks are numbered 1 to 12 from the top downwards. A minor road crosses at Daintrys Road Bridge, just below lock 1, the A54 road crosses at Peckerpool Bridge, below lock 5, Swindalls Bridge carries a footpath over the canal below lock 8, and a dismantled railway used to cross above lock 12. The surroundings are rural and partially wooded. There are some secluded moorings by the locks, which are suitable for standard narrow boats, up to a maximum size of . The railway bridge once carried the Churnet Valley Line which left the main line from Stoke to Manchester at North Rode, just to the west of lock 2. Bosley railway station was located by lock 5, and the railway passed through Leek to reach Uttoxeter. Part of it is now preserved as the Churnet Valley Railway. Because of the short distances between the locks, most of the intervening pounds are extended sideways,Ordnance Survey, 1:25,000 map in order to increase their volume, and lessen the changes in level when a lock full of water is emptied into the pound by a boat descending the flight or removed from the pound to fill the lock below as a boat ascends. The locks are built of rusticated red gritstone, and most are grade II listed structures. The listing includes the ponds to the west of each of the locks. Daintrys Road Bridge has an elliptical arch, and is built of reddish-buff ashlar gritstone, as is Peckerpool Wood Bridge. Both date from the opening of the canal. Swindalls Bridge is a farm accommodation bridge, and is also built of gritstone blocks. The aqueduct that carries the canal over the River Dane below lock 12 is high and has a semi-circular arch with a span of . Bosley Reservoir, the main source of water for the canal, is situated about to the east of the flight, and a feeder supplies water to the summit pound just above the top lock. Features How a lock with a side pond works The locks are unusual for narrow canals, in that they are fitted with mitre gates at both top and bottom, as opposed to the more usual clapper top gate. The chambers are constructed from large blocks of stone, with mason's marks visible on many of them. The locks were equipped with side ponds to save water, but these were taken out of use many years ago, although they still function as overflow channels. The frames for the paddle gear are still visible at four of them. Lock ponds are ponds which are maintained at an intermediate level between the upper pound and the lower pound. When a lock is emptying, water from the top of the lock fills the pond, and the rest is discharged to the lower pound. When the lock is filling, water from the pond fills the bottom of the lock, and the rest is then drawn from the top pound. By careful design of the size and level of the ponds, those at Bosley managed to re-use about 40 per cent of the water in this way. The bottom of each lock was connected by a culvert to the bottom of its pond, and a paddle controlled the flow of water through the culvert. The paddle had to be capable of sealing the culvert against flow in either direction, since when closed it had to prevent the lock from emptying when it is full, and from filling when it is empty. British Waterways, in conjunction with the Macclesfield Canal Society, are hoping to restore one of the side ponds to enable its operation to be demonstrated, although it is likely that it will only be used for demonstrations, rather than in normal operation of the lock. In 2008 the side pond adjacent to lock 4 was cleared and investigated. Although the paddle gear was beyond repair, enough of it was left to see that it included a counterbalance mechanism, and the stonework of the pond was still in good condition. The culverts are currently bricked up, and the brickwork will have to be removed if the side pond is returned to service. Each of the locks has a stone overflow weir on its towpath side, just above the top gates. A stone culvert runs under the towpath to feed the water into the side pond, which also has an overflow weir at its lower end. Another culvert feeds excess water back into the canal below the bottom gates of the lock.

The association owns two campsites in the province. History Scouting within the German-speaking minority grew out of Roman Catholic youth groups (Katholische Jungschar). In 1969-1970 Scouting became a part of the programme of these groups. A pioneer of Scouting was the priest Dean Georg Peer. He participated in seminars of the DPSG, and included Scouting in leadership training of Jungschar afterwards. The first Scout groups affiliated to Katholische Jungschar-S√ºdtirol were founded between 1969 and 1972. The oldest Scout group of the S√ºdtiroler Pfadfinderschaft is in Bruneck, founded in 1969 as Jungscharscouts. In 1972 eighteen Scout leaders took part in different training courses of the DPSG. On April 25, 1973 the S√ºdtiroler Pfadfinderschaft was established as an independent association. In 1997 it became part of AGESCI. Scouts and Guides of the S√ºdtiroler Pfadfinderschaft took part in the 20th World Scout Jamboree, the 21st World Scout Jamboree. and the 22nd World Scout Jamboree Scouts and Guides of the S√ºdtiroler Pfadfinderschaft often take part in camps and training courses in other German-speaking countries (for example in 2003 in the Free Life Jamboree in Austria or in 2006 in the National Jamboree of Liechtenstein). The S√ºdtiroler Pfadfinderschaft is member of the Deutschsprachige Konferenz der Pfadfinderverb√§nde. The Peace Light of Bethlehem is distributed by the association in the province of South Tyrol. Since 1991 the Peace Light of Bethlehem has been passed on to the Scout association at a ceremony in Brenner together with Austrian Scouts and Guides from Tyrol. The distribution of the Peace Light of Bethlehem is always combined with a fundraising campaign. In 2007 it was for handicapped children in Indonesia. The units of the association helps to maintain Tyrolean traditions such as the fires at the Feast of the Sacred Heart.

Bobsleigh career Competing for Romania in bobsleigh, he won two medals in the two-man event at the FIBT World Championships with a gold in 1933 and a bronze in 1934. PapanƒÉ also competed in two Winter Olympics, earning his best finish of fourth in the two-man event at Lake Placid, New York in 1932. He retired from bobsledding after the 1936 Winter Olympics. Aviation career PapanƒÉ obtained his pilot's license in 1928 while in Romania, and was already setting altitude records in 1931. At the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, he competed in gliding (which was a demonstration sport), finishing a respectable 12th as the only representative from Romania. This earned him an invitation to an aerobatics competition in Los Angeles. PapanƒÉ accepted the offer, and he and his plane, a B√ºcker B√º 133B Jungermeister (one of only two versions of that variant ever produced) with the registration YR- PAX, were flown from Frankfurt, Germany to New York, New York aboard the Hindenburg airship in August 1936. He then flew across the United States from New York to Los Angeles, winning the race between the cities. In Los Angeles, he won the national air races that were held there. In December of that year, PapanƒÉ finished second with the Jungermeister in a race from Miami, Florida to Havana, Cuba. At an airshow in Cleveland, Ohio the following year, PapanƒÉ was in a battle with fellow aviator Count Hagenburg that ended up crashing the count's aircraft. PapanƒÉ offered Hagenburg his aircraft, but the count refused. PapanƒÉ's aircraft was damaged on the runway at an airport in Chicago, Illinois in 1940. The plane was sold twice before being donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1973. The aircraft is now located at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia. PapanƒÉ later tested gliders for Northrop as a test pilot, many of his flights being documented in Flying magazine. He was involved in the trials for the P-61 Black Widow aircraft that would be involved during World War II for the United States Army Air Forces. Other activities PapanƒÉ was also active in his youth as a goalkeeper, competing for Col≈£ea Bucure»ôti. Personal life PapanƒÉ was born in Bucharest. He was married twice. His first wife Dina in 1938 died while in childbirth on 5 September of that year. He remarried to Jean Hacker on 30 April 1945, but their marriage in Beverly Hills, California did not go well. He died on 17 April 1946 after abandoning his car 17 miles (27 km) south of Las Vegas, Nevada. Authorities discovered PapanƒÉ's body six days later with a suicide note. PapanƒÉ died by poisoning.

The bottle filters out objects larger than 15 nanometres. Development After the 2004 Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina disaster in the U.S., Michael Pritchard, a water-treatment expert in Ipswich, England began to develop the LifeSaver bottle after hearing the idea from Zackary Kepes and Austin Castellano. Pritchard presented a prototype of the LifeSaver at 2007's DSEi London, where the product was named \\"Best Technological Development\\". Pritchard's entire stock of 1,000 bottles sold out within four hours of the presentation. Speaking at TED in 2009, Pritchard estimated that by using the LifeSaver bottle, reaching the Millennium Development Goals of halving the number of people without drinking water will cost $8 billion; while $20 billion would provide drinking water for everyone on Earth. = Independent test results = In 2007, the LifeSaver bottle was tested by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the results found it to completely filter out all bacteria and viruses.\\\\- London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, lifesaversystems.com Use The bottle's interchangeable filter can purify between 4,000 and 6,000 litres (1,050 to 1,585 gallons) before it stops working and needs to be replaced. It filters out objects bigger than 15 nanometres‚Äîincluding viruses, bacteria, and cysts. The carbon filter does not require chemicals. The process of filtering the water takes 20 seconds, allowing for 0.71 litres (1.5 pints) of water to be filtered. Once a filter has reached its limit, it will not allow contaminated water to be drunk. The LiveSaver bottle has been used by soldiers for drinking water as well as cleaning wounds. To filter the water, one puts contaminated water in the back of the bottle, then screws the lid on. The lid has a built in pump which is operated manually with a hand; the pumping action forces the contaminated water through the nano-filter and safe drinking water collects in another chamber in the bottle. The drinker then opens the top of the bottle from which safe drinking water comes out. A much larger version of the LifeSaver bottle, called the LifeSaver Jerrycan, has the same filtering technology. The can allows for the filtration of 10,000 to 20,000 litres (2,650 to 5,300 gallons). One jerrycan filter can provide water for four people over a three-year span.  Limits  The bottle can be used to filter urine and will remove all microbiological contamination. However, there will be an amount of dissolved salts that can not be removed.

As the name suggests, it has its origins in Cambridge, England, where in the early 1960s a group of young technology graduates established a high-technology R&D; and prototyping business: Cambridge Consultants.  Company history  = Origins = Cambridge Audio began life as a division of Cambridge Consultants in 1968. The company's first product was the 2 √ó 20W P40 integrated amplifier, which was created by a team that included Gordon Edge and Peter Lee. In addition to an advanced technical specification the P40 had a slim case design by Roy Gray, from Woodhuysen Design. Cambridge Audio P40 The P40 would also make history as the first amplifier to use a toroidal transformer, which would go on to be a standard component inside virtually every high-end amplifier produced since. Cambridge Audio became a standalone business from the group when a new company, Cambridge Audio Laboratories Ltd, was formed, operating from extensive premises alongside the old Enderby's Mill in St. Ives, Cambridge. The P40 was an immediate success, but would prove difficult to manufacture in any volume, a problem that would be resolved in 1970 with the introduction of the new 2 √ó 25W P50 model, which was a very similar product with regards to both circuit design and appearance, but had been engineered for mass production. Despite strong sales and rapid growth, the company required increased investment and so was sold in 1971 to Colin Hammond of CE Hammond & Co Ltd ‚Äì then a very successful distributor of Revox tape recorders and other audio products in the UK, Canada and the USA. A new company, Cambridge Audio Ltd, was formed, with leading UK electrical engineer Stan Curtis joining as the organisation's technical director. The St. Ives factory was extensive and at its peak employed more than 300 people. Most of the required components were made under one roof including the circuit boards and the aluminium cases. All transistors were made to CA's specification and even carried the company's own part numbers. Every product was extensively tested after manufacture and a printed certificate was produced for every individual unit detailing the actual measured performance results. = 1970s = 1971 also saw the introduction of Cambridge Audio's first loudspeaker with the launch of the R50 transmission line speaker, designed by Bert Webb and also produced at the St. Ives plant. Cambridge Audio's first loudspeaker, the R50 In 1972 new models included the P100 and P50mkII integrated amplifiers, the R40 transmission line loudspeaker and the T50 FM stereo tuner. Export sales had also begun and were proving very buoyant, in part due to the introduction of export-only products, including the TL100 and 200 transmission line speakers, the P75X integrated amplifier and the T75X stereo tuner. Stan Curtis put together a new team and re-designed the existing products as well as introducing a raft of new models. 1973 saw the introduction of the P110 integrated amplifier and the company's first turntable, while the P140X integrated amplifier was introduced for export markets. Cambridge Audio P110 Other innovations included the design of what was believed to be the world's first digital tuner, the T120, which worked well but proved impractical for volume production. Cambridge Audio P60 stereo integrated amp A major change occurred in 1974 with the introduction of the P60 integrated amplifier, which was designed to be not only better performing than the existing models but also significantly easier to manufacture and therefore at a lower cost. The P60 sold in large numbers and became the best-selling Cambridge model to date with a weekly production run of more than 400 pieces. Also new were the PA100 dedicated power amplifier, the R40mkII and R50mkII loudspeakers, the P80X integrated amplifier and the TL200mkII loudspeakers for export markets. Cambridge Audio Classic One Probably the most significant new product arrived in 1975 with the launch of the Classic One 2 √ó 25W integrated amplifier, one of the first to feature a new circuit design from Cambridge Audio and with much of the circuitry contained in custom-made integrated circuits ‚Äì another world's first ‚Äì and using multi-layer boards for the first time. The first production batch was to be followed by the Classic Two amplifier of similar performance, but offering 100 watts per channel output. Such plans were however soon abandoned with the closure of the St. Ives factory as CE Hammond & Co decided to merge their production assets for all their many businesses into one extensive factory in Byfleet, Surrey. Many of the experienced Cambridge Audio production team also left the business at this time and after some production issues at the new facility the decision was made to abandon the relatively complex Classic Series in favour of an updated version of the P60 called the P80. Cambridge Audio ceased to be a priority in the CE Hammond empire and sales declined, until in 1980 the business was sold to Vince Adams, a successful UK hi-fi entrepreneur at the time. = 1980s = The business was relaunched as Cambridge Audio Research Ltd. with former technical director Stan Curtis charged with designing a new line of products. The new range had styling echoes of the original Cambridge products, but broke with tradition by being physically larger, starting with the P35 integrated amplifier launched in 1983, closely followed by the C75 preamplifier and A75 power amplifier. Financial difficulties for the parent company in 1984 led to Cambridge Audio Research being taken over by Stan and Angie Curtis and renamed Cambridge Audio International. The company moved back to St. Ives in Cambridge. The next four years saw a rapid expansion of the business with over 16 new products being launched and with export markets re-established in over 28 countries across the world. The amplifier range ‚Äì C75mkII preamplifier, P40, P55 integrated and A250 power amplifier ‚Äì received excellent reviews. CD1 Advert featuring Stan Curtis In 1985 a major innovative step was made with the launch of the CD1, the world's first two-box CD player. At the time this CD player was widely recognised as the best player available and its design featured many new ideas and a ground-breaking specification. Apart from putting the DAC stages into a separate case, the transport was mounted on a lead beam suspension to reduce disc reading errors; a unique audio stage offered the choice of six alternative playback filters; and the digital-to-analogue conversion was performed by six matched DACs to give linearity down to ‚àí120 dB at a time when most players were only linear down to about ‚àí94 dB.Cambridge Audio CD1 The CD1 soon became a three-box player with the arrival of a Quality Assurance Module, which monitored all the errors on the disc and quantified those that could not be corrected. This proved popular with many audiophile enthusiasts and also with specialist record companies around the world. The player used Philips' digitally filtered 14-bit 4x DACs, but with a difference: three DACs were used per channel, two in parallel and one for ranging, rounding the result up to 16 bits overall. While the CD1 remained an audiophile player, there was also demand from both customers and distributors for a more affordable model, which arrived in 1986 with the launch of the CD2. At the time many of the best CD players still used a 14-bit, 4 times oversampling conversion technique, so the Cambridge Audio team set out to achieve a step change in performance by offering for the first time a model with 16-bit 16 times oversampling: a massive improvement in the resolution of the fine detail on the disc. Magazine reviews were outstanding and the company found itself in the enviable position of being back-ordered by six months even before the first unit was delivered. A new C50 pre-amplifier and A50 power amplifier were introduced and by 1987 ‚Äì on the back of the success of the new products ‚Äì turnover had grown to ¬£1M per annum. The next CD player to be introduced was a mark II version of the CD1. This was launched at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 1988. Like its predecessor it was a two-box player, but it incorporated a radical 16-bit 32 times oversampling conversion technology derived from that used in the CD2. Production was very limited in volume as the company decided to focus on the mainstream Cambridge Audio product line. The continued expansion of the company put a strain on both its physical and financial resources and at the end of 1988 Cambridge Audio became part of the Hi-Fi Markets Group. The product range underwent another significant change in appearance with the low profile black cases giving way to full height cases finished in a neutral grey colour. Internally though, the existing Stan Curtis circuit designs were retained with key new product launches for the DAC2 and DAC3 digital-to- analogue converters and the T40 FM tuner. Within two years Cambridge Audio was purchased by the Wharfedale company, best known for its loudspeakers, which set up a production line at its large facility in Leeds, Yorkshire. Wharfedale was undergoing major re-organisation by a team that included Stan Curtis. Despite his sentimental attachment to Cambridge Audio, he realised the company needed a new home that could focus on the electronics and so the decision was made to divest Cambridge Audio and in 1994 the company would be sold for the last time before beginning more than 20 years of growth, innovation and profitability.  Audio Partnership  Audio Partnership founder: James Johnson-Flint The purchaser of the business in 1994 was the newly- established Audio Partnership, which was formed by two entrepreneurial businessmen, Julian Richer and James Johnson-Flint, who were already enjoying significant success with audio retailer Richer Sounds. Audio Partnership was specifically formed to look for opportunities in acquiring under-developed brands with the intention of providing the investment to allow stability and growth, both in the UK and overseas. Target companies would be ideally British brands that had already developed exceptional technical and design credibility and popularity, but had been lacking in resources or funding to be consistent market leaders in the UK or other markets. Cambridge Audio was considered a perfect fit and became the company's first acquisition and remains Audio Partnership's prime focus some 22 years later. A key element in the purchase of Cambridge Audio by Audio Partnership was the determination that the brand would continue as a true creator, developer and manufacturer of its own dedicated products. From the start of this new era the company was committed to the idea that Cambridge Audio should continue to create ground-breaking, original and proprietary technologies. From the first day of ownership, work commenced to build an in-house engineering team starting with mechanical engineering and industrial design while exclusive contracts were signed with the most prominent and successful freelance audio electronics engineers of the day, including: Mike Creek of Creek Audio, John Westlake and the engineering team at Pink Triangle (audio manufacturer) = 1990s = One of the first products to benefit was the DacMagic 1 digital-to-analogue converter, which was launched in 1994 ‚Äì and later, as Dacmagic 2, was Cambridge Audio's first outright What HiFi? Awards winner as the best DAC of the year. Another product was the launch of the A1 amplifier in 1995, which was initially only available the UK. Consequently, the A1 integrated amplifier was a success both in the UK and on this high the company began to rebuild Cambridge Audio's international network, adding new distributors in France, Canada, the US, Hong Kong, Germany and Denmark. Cambridge Audio A1 hybrid amp Cambridge Audio S700 Isomagic DAC The A1 would stay in production ‚Äì latterly as the MKII and MKIII versions ‚Äì for more than a decade, becoming one of Cambridge Audio's more popular products with more than 200,000 units sold. In 1999 the company launched the first Cambridge Audio web site while also moving into the home cinema market with the V500 Dolby Digital Decoder. 1999 also saw the S700 Isomagic, combining a DAC with an isolation platform to mount a CD player and other electronics. The S700 was also the world's second DAC to be compatible with the then new HDCD format, after Pink Triangle's Dacapo DAC, whose HDCD implementation was developed in partnership with the inventor of HDCD, Pacific Microsonics.http://www.uhfmag.com/Issue61/Isomagic.html = 2000s = The creation of a complete in-house team also allowed Cambridge Audio to begin work on its first coherent range of products, culminating in the launch of the Azur series in 2003. The Azur range featured seven models designed together as an identifiable family that included the 340A, 540A and 640A integrated amplifiers. There were also 340C, 540C and 640C CD players plus the 640T DAB/FM tuner. 2005 saw the introduction of another product with the launch of the M1 touch screen 8-in-1 remote control. Also by 2005, Cambridge products could claim to be on sale in more than 50 countries worldwide. 2006 was another key year in the development of the Cambridge Audio brand with the introduction of the Azur 840A integrated amplifier, 840E preamplifier, 840W power amplifier and the 840C CD player, the first products that the company described as 'affordable' high-end audio. Cambridge Audio azur 840a class xd integrated amplifier The 840A integrated amplifier also introduced Cambridge Audio's Crossover Displacement (Class-XD Amplifier) design, which combined the performance of a class A design with the efficiency of class AB. The technology would go on to help the 840A be selected as the 2007/2008 two- channel amplifier of the year at the prestigious EISA Awards. The 840C was the first product to feature another new technology that Cambridge Audio had developed with Swiss-based Anagram Technologies, Adaptive Time Filtering (ATF) up-sampling. Cambridge Audio Azur 640H ATF up-samples any digital signal ‚Äì such as CD's 16-bit 44.1 kHz ‚Äì to a 24-bit, 384 kHz signal, which presents a much more accurate audio soundwave. Both Class XD and ATF remain proprietary technologies only found on Cambridge Audio high-end products. 2006 also saw Cambridge Audio launch the first truly affordable music server, the Azur 640H, a networked CD player that also featured a 160 GB hard disc. = 2010s = Cambridge Audio Minx 2010 saw another product with the arrival of the first Minx loudspeakers, designed as a sub/sat system, but with the emphasis on sound quality. BMR technology uses a single flat panel to produce an ultra- wide range of frequencies, eliminating the need for a separate tweeter and mid-range driver. 2011 was another landmark year for Cambridge Audio with the introduction of the NP30, the brand's first network music player using Cambridge Audio's proprietary StreamMagic streaming platform. The core IP for the StreamMagic platform, a joint development between Cambridge Audio and Cambridge-based technology company Reciva, brought Internet radio to Cambridge products for the first time. One consequence of the close cooperation with Reciva on such a strategically important technology was Cambridge Audio agreeing to acquire the company's IP in 2011 as well as taking on the company's software team and establishing a technology hub in Cambridge responsible for the ongoing development of the StreamMagic platform. The StreamMagic platform has continued to be developed in the subsequent period and has gone on to power some of the company's products including StreamMagic 6 introduced in 2012 and the Minx Xi introduced in 2013. The 840 Series was given a thorough update in 2012, with the new 851 series taking a significant step upmarket for both build and sound quality. The range launched with the 851A integrated amplifier and 851C CD player/DAC but would go on to include the 851E and 851W pre- and power amplifiers, the 851D dedicated high-end DAC and the 851N network player. Cambridge Audio 851A integrated amplifier (top) and 851C CD (bottom) The 851A and 851C would also win Cambridge Audio their second EISA Award as the Best Two Channel System in 2012‚Äì2013. Harking back to some of Cambridge Audio's earliest products, the new range of Aero bookshelf and floor-standing loudspeakers were launched in 2013 and again made use of BMR technology, but in a new third-generation proprietary version. With the BMR driver covering both mid-range and high frequencies a much simpler and less intrusive crossover could be used lower in frequency in a region where the ear is less sensitive. The result was lower distortion and a more cohesive, immersive and better-distributed sound ‚Äì which integrated particularly well when used as a 5.1 system with the dedicated AV products from the range. The Aero range enjoyed won What Hi-Fi? Sound and Vision magazine's Best Speaker Package of the Year award in both 2013 and 2014 as well as pride of place in a key What Hi-Fi? AV reference listening room system. The Aeromax range followed in 2014, using new in-house developed fourth generation BMR drivers, improved cabinet construction and upgraded crossover components. 2013 also saw a major new development for the brand with the introduction of the first wireless speakers, Cambridge Audio Minx Go wireless speaker initially with the mains-powered Minx Air 100 and Air 200 products, closely followed by the battery-powered Minx Go speaker. The wireless speakers would introduce Cambridge Audio to a new more mainstream audience; in particular, the Minx would become the brand's fastest selling product. Reaching a new customer base would also require Cambridge Audio to adjust its distribution model, with direct sales from the company's web site beginning in 2014. In the same year UK retailer John Lewis also partnered with the brand. 2015 would see a completely new range introduced with the launch of the CX series, the result of Cambridge Audio's largest investment in a product range and representing a significant step forward in terms of product design, build and sound quality. The new CX Series included: the CXA60 and 80 integrated amplifiers, the CXC CD transport, the CXN network music player, the CXU universal Blu-ray player and the CXR120 and CXR200 AV receivers. The CX Series was launched to huge critical acclaim, in particular the CXA60 and CXN were voted Product of the Year at the 2015 What Hi-Fi? Awards, with the CXC also winning Best CD Transport under ¬£500 and the CXU winning the Award for Best Blu-ray Player ¬£300+. The success continued for a second year at the 2016 What Hi-Fi? Awards, when the CXA60 retained its crown as the outright amplifier of the year, while the CXN won the award for the best music streamer between ¬£500‚Äì¬£1000. The CX series products were joined by the 851N, which won the outright award for best music streamer 2016. Continuing their range of wireless products, Cambridge audio partnered with Marton Mills to release Yoyo, a new range of three Bluetooth speakers revealed in September 2016. = 2020s = Cambridge Audio announced the release of the Melomania 1, a bluetooth wireless earphone in June 2019. The Melomania 1s had reviews from WhatHiFi? Techradar and Forbes. The difficulties of getting a good fit in the ear were noted.  Manufacturing and the company today  Audio Partnership set up production facilities in China, with Cambridge Audio products manufactured in the country from 1994. The company established an office in Hong Kong in 2001 and an office in mainland China in 2011, allowing Cambridge Audio to have its own production and QC engineers on site. Sales offices and teams were established in Germany and Hong Kong in 2015. Investment in new products continues and the company now employs 91 people including an in-house engineering team of 24, based at the Cambridge Audio HQ in London, SE1 and at the company's Cambridge base. The current annual turnover is in excess of ¬£20 million.

History It was built by J. J. Daniels in 1861, and is the oldest remaining bridge built by him. Crossing Sugar Creek, on county road 83 at the intersection with county roads 25 and 232, it is a single span Double Burr Arch truss covered bridge structure built on a base of hewn stone. Note: This includes , Site map, and Accompanying photographs. Prior Wright had built his second mill in the area of 'Devil's Den' in 1848, after his mill located at The Narrows was washed away by a freshet on New Year's Day 1847. During this time, flat boats would be built and floated over the shallows of Sugar Creek during high waters for the trip to the markets in New Orleans. When the Wabash and Erie Canal came through more business originated from here. Eventually the mill, a general store, cooper shop, blacksmith shop, two sawmills, and four dwelling houses would come to make up the town of Rockport. In addition, an iron smelter operated for a while using a poor grade of iron ore and the plentiful and high grade coke made from local coal. By December 1860, the citizens of the area had decided to call on Dr. Hobbs to be their spokesman for a new bridge near Wright's Mill. Dr. Hobbs called upon the Parke County Commissioners to hold a special meeting, and on December 28, they discuss the issue of \\"several citizens who had presented a petition for a bridge over Sugar Creek at Wright's Upper Mills.\\" John Scott, \\"presented on behalf of various citizens a petition and subscriptions for a bridge at Star Mills,\\" at the same meeting. Just four days later on New Year's Day 1861, the commissioners held another special meeting and approved both bridges to be built with $8,000 from the county, \\"...provided the citizens would make up enough subscriptions to make up the balance on the cost of these two bridges.\\" Within a week and a half, January 17, $3,307 and 300 signatures had been collected by the petition leaders Byers, Milligan, Graham, and Elwood Hadley. James Johnson and Henry Wolf were appointed to select sites for the bridges, establish specifications and provide estimates for the county commissioners. Back in 1859, the Parke County Commissioners had received a letter from J. J. Daniels, on the behalf of William D. Daniels, on the proposal of building bridges at Wright's Mill and Star Mills. Bids were opened at the March 1861 meeting. William D. Daniels was awarded the bid and on April 22, the contracts were signed, filed, and $1,000 advance was allowed. Brown and Company had finished the masonry work, that had been subcontracted out to them, for the abutments by September 16, and Mr. Daniels was given $6,000 to pay for the work. This was to be the only bridge in Parke County built by J. J. Daniels that would contain a cornerstone in the abutment. The cornerstone is located in the south upstream side of the bridge and reads, \\"Builder J. J. Daniels 1861\\". On November 9, 1861, the bridge was ready for its final inspection by the county commissioners and on November 11, Daniels was paid $1,500 for the Jackson bridge contract and an additional $2,500. The additional amount may have been for the Star Mills Bridge which was completed in December. It is the longest single span covered bridge in Indiana and the oldest bridge still standing built by J. J. Daniels. Built during the unstable political era of the American Civil War, J. J. Daniels wanted to make a clear political statement and named the bridge after Andrew Jackson to honor his statement to John Calhoun: \\"To the Union, it must be preserved.\\" When the bridge was first built the portal was lettered: \\"The Federal Union: It must be preserved.\\" It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

History SMS was initially developed by the Engineering Computer Graphics Laboratory at Brigham Young University (later renamed in September, 1998 to Environmental Modeling Research Laboratory or EMRL) in the late 1980s on Unix workstations. The development of SMS was funded primarily by The United States Army Corps of Engineers and is still known as the Department of Defense Surface-water Modeling System or DoD SMS. It was later ported to Windows platforms in the mid 1990s and support for HP- UX, IRIX, OSF/1, and Solaris platforms was discontinued. In April 2007, the main software development team at EMRL entered private enterprise as Aquaveo LLC,Aquaveo.com. Aquaveo.com.

Examples of SMS Implementation *SMS modeling was used to ‚Äúdetermine flooded areas in case of failure or revision of a weir in combination with a coincidental 100-year flood event‚Äù (Gerstner, Belzner, and Thorenz, 975). Furthermore, ‚Äúconcerning the water level calculations in case of failure of a weir, the Bavarian Environmental Agency provided the Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute with those two-dimensional depth-averaged hydrodynamic models, which are covering the whole Bavarian part of the river Main. The models were created with the software Surface-Modeling System (SMS) of Aquaveo LLC‚Äù (Gerstner, Belzner, and Thorenz, 976). *This article ‚Äúdescribes the mathematical formulation, numerical implementation, and input specifications of rubble mound structures in the Coastal Modeling System (CMS) operated through the Surface-water Modeling System (SMS)‚Äù (Li, et al., 1). Describing the input specifications, the authors write, ‚ÄúWorking with the SMS interface, users can specify rubble mound structures in the CMS by creating datasets for different structure parameters. Five datasets are required for this application‚Äù (Li, et al., 3) and ‚Äúusers should refer to Aquaveo (2010) for generating a XMDF dataset (*.h5 file) under the SMS‚Äù (Li, et al., 5). *This study examined the ‚Äúneed of developing mathematical models for determining and predicting water quality of 'river-type' systems. It presents a case study for determining the pollutant dispersion for a section of the River Prut, Ungheni town, which was filled with polluted water with oil products from its tributary river Delia‚Äù (Marusic and Ciufudean, 177). ‚ÄúThe obtained numerical models were developed using the program Surface-water Modeling System (SMS) v.10.1.11, which was designed by experts from Aquaveo company. The hydrodynamics of the studied sector, obtained using the SMS module named RMA2 [13], served as input for the RMA module 4, which determined the pollutant dispersion‚Äù (Marusic and Ciufudean, 178-179). *This study focused on finding ‚Äúrecommendations for optimization‚Äù of the ‚ÄúChusovskoy water intake located in the confluence zone of two rivers with essentially different hydrochemical regimes and in the backwater zone of the Kamskaya hydroelectric power station‚Äù (Lyubimova, et al., 1). ‚ÄúA two-dimensional (in a horizontal plane) model for the examined region of the water storage basin was constructed by making use of the software product SMS v.10 of the American company AQUAVEO LLC‚Äù (Lyubimova, et al., 2). Evaluations of the SMS-derived, two-dimensional model as well as a three-dimensional model yielded the discovery that ‚Äúthe selective water intake from the near-surface layers can essentially reduce hardness of potable water consumed by the inhabitants of Perm‚Äù (Lyubimova, et al., 6).

The film stars Martine Beswick as the main antagonist and stage actor Michael Latimer. Steven Berkoff features in a small role at the end. Plot David Marchant (Michael Latimer), a British explorer, along with Colonel Hammond (Robert Raglan) and a guide are pursuing a leopard on an African safari. The Colonel takes aim but misses and only wounds the animal. With the guide warning that it will soon be dark, David decides to find the beast and put it out of its misery before following the party back to camp. Walking some way, he passes various trees with a picture of a white rhino but ignores them. Finally, the weakened leopard attacks him and he shoots it dead, whereupon David is ambushed and captured by a primitive tribe. They accuse him of disturbing the spirit of the white rhinoceros, and take him to their leader's temple. As the high priest/leader makes his decision, David notices a large, ancient stone statue of a white rhino and realizes this is what the tribe worship. Interested, David reaches out to touch it. Just as he is about to be killed for his trespassing and disturbing the spirits, David touches the statue and there is flash of lightning that opens a giant crack in the cave wall. Wasting no time, Marchant makes his escape and finds himself in a lush paradise jungle within a large valley. He hears a noise, and a terrified fair-haired beauty (Edina Ronay) tumbles out of the bush. David tries to help her but the woman bites him and runs off. Following her, David tackles her to the ground, but they are both attacked by dark-haired women. David is escorted with them to their village while the fair woman is bound and taken with them. As they reach the outskirts, David is astounded to discover another white rhino statue, only it looks less ancient and possibly even newer. Entering the settlement, David finds that the fair-haired women serve the dark haired women, who themselves are ruled by the beautiful, dark-haired Queen Kari (Martine Beswick), who immediately takes an interest in David and chooses him as her mate, but he is appalled by her cruelty and spurns her advances. Angered, Kari orders her guards to throw David into a windowless cell. Getting to his senses, David finds the same woman he encountered earlier and introduces himself. She reveals her name is Saria. When David asks if Saria's people have ever fought back, she replies that Kari is protected by the Devils, the guardians who shield the people from the \\"cruel world outside\\". In return, one of the blonde women must be taken as a thanksgiving for protection. David is then moved to where the other men are, in a cave and now living in fear of Kari. At a mealtime, an elder tells David of how it all began; their ancestors moved into the area and hunted the white rhino to extinction. This done, they erected a false image to convince others that they still existed. In doing so, they offended their gods, and the legend of the white rhinoceros was born. The elder goes on to say that they were sent a tribe of \\"dark people\\", who came to this land seeking protection. They were described as less intelligent and were enslaved. The only protection Saria's people had was the lie that the white rhino protected them, until a slave girl escaped and told them of the lie. As a result, the men were enslaved and the slave girl was made their Queen, Kari. The tribe will only become bonded by spirit again when the false idol is destroyed. As time passes a \\"Devil\\" chooses who should be made the next bride of the white rhino. The chosen one is Saria. Learning of this, David urges the men to join forces with the blonde women and against the dark people. Escaping, the men disrupt the ceremony as the rhino-masked \\"Devil\\" is about to take Saria. David jumps the \\"Devil\\" and unmasks him as an African man, who then flees. David battles Kari, knocking her unconscious and then frees Saria. More rhino-masked \\"Devils\\" emerge from the jungle but the men and allied women pursue them, unaware they do not know the jungle as well as they do, despite David's protests. A battle breaks out between the two tribes in the jungle. Kari regains consciousness and grabbing a knife, determined to kill David, sets out through the battle. Suddenly there is an almighty roar and both tribes, to their horror, see a white rhinoceros. Despite Kari telling the tribes it is their god and they will not be harmed, the beast charges and impales the false idol, Kari, with its horn. The creature begins to drive out the \\"Devils\\" and disappears into the jungle. Finding Kari's corpse, David takes a wooden brooch with a white rhino on it and offers it to Saria, who then refuses it saying that the \\"Devils\\" won't be returning. She goes on to say that the legend is partly fulfilled and she heads over to the rhino statue while David follows, stuffing the brooch into his chest pocket. David tells her that he won't leave her, despite Saria telling him that her world is not his. Suddenly there is thunder and it begins to rain. David confesses his love for Saria but she moves away and tells David that her love for him will always remain. She leaves David alone in the rain, along with the statue of the white rhino. As if hypnotized, David moves forward and touches the rhino's horn as lightning strikes. In an instant, Marchant is back in the high priest's temple just as they are about to proclaim judgment over him. Suddenly the rhino statue begins to break and crumble to pieces. The priest joyfully announces that the legend of the white rhinoceros is true and that they are free at last. The priest then orders the destruction of the \\"false idol's temple\\" whilst David discreetly leaves and joins the guide, who has been waiting for him. As they both head back, David is surprised at how little time has passed for the guide. Once back at the camp, David wonders whether it really was a dream or he had really traveled back in time to reunite a lost African tribe and end a million-year-old legend. As he cleans himself, he discovers the white rhino's brooch in his pocket proving some truth in his experience. David is then asked to greet some people from London. To his amazement, one of the guests is the living image of Saria. The guest then introduces herself as Sarah. Clutching the brooch, David shakes her hand.

Bates stood down as Secretary on his election to Stormont in 1921, where he represented first East Belfast and later Belfast Victoria. In the government of Sir James Craig he was the first Minister for Home Affairs and a member of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland. He introduced the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act, but opposed the Ulster Protestant Association. Under his administration, he was accused of gerrymandering, and of intervening to ensure that prison sentences were not imposed on Protestants who attacked Catholics. Bates was also a Deputy Lord Lieutenant of County Down. He married Jessie Muriel Cleland, daughter of Sir Charles John Cleland. They had one son, Major Sir John Dawson Bates, 2nd Baronet (an Oxford-educated Wykehamist, d. 1998).

The case was decided by the Connecticut Supreme Court in a 4-3 en banc decision, with the majority opinion authored by Justice Flemming L. Norcott, Jr., joined by Justices David M. Borden, Richard N. Palmer and Christine S. Vertefeuille. The Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision in favor of the city in a 5-4 decision, in what is viewed as a major decision in the history of the eminent domain power. A widespread negative reaction to the opinion led to many state legislatures restricting their eminent domain power. On March 24, 2006, Zarella was nominated by Governor M. Jodi Rell to replace Chief Justice William J. Sullivan, who had announced his retirement scheduled for April 15, 2005. The Connecticut Supreme Court became embroiled in a lengthy ethics scandal, however, when the Hartford Courant revealed that Sullivan had postponed the publication of a controversial decision opposing Freedom of Information Act requests for documents that track the status and history of legal cases in the Connecticut legal system until hearings for Zarella were completed. Both justices ruled in favor of the restrictions, and legislators speculated that Sullivan delayed the publication of the court's opinion because he feared it might damage Zarella's chances of becoming Chief Justice. This was subsequently confirmed in testimony by Sullivan. In April 2006 Rell withdrew Zarella's nomination to be Chief Justice at his request after these revelations. There is no evidence that Zarella had knowledge that Sullivan was intentionally delaying publication of an opinion for the benefit of his nomination. On October 10, 2008, Zarella dissented in the case of Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health, in which the court held that gay and lesbian couples could not be denied the right to marry because of the Equal Protection Clause of the state constitution. This decision made Connecticut the third state (along with Massachusetts and California) to legalize same-sex marriage through judicial decree of the state supreme court. Zarella is a former chair of the Connecticut Criminal Justice Commission and the Rules Committee.

Following the war, the destroyer was deemed surplus and she was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1920 and served there until 1928. She was sold for scrap in 1929. Design and description Patrician was a Thornycroft M-class destroyer that displaced and was long overall with a beam of and a draught of . The ship was propelled by three shafts driven by Brown-Curtis turbines powered by three Yarrow boilers creating . This gave the ship a maximum speed of . The destroyer carried of fuel oil.Gardiner and Gray, pp. 79‚Äì80 The destroyer was armed with three quick-firing (QF) /45 calibre Mark IV guns in single mounts. The No.2 4-inch gun was placed on a bandstand, unlike earlier M-class destroyers. For secondary armament, the destroyer was equipped with a single QF 2-pounder \\"pom-pom\\" Mk.II and four torpedo tubes in two twin mounts.Gardiner and Gray, pp. 76, 79 As a Thornycroft \\"special\\", Patrician resembled the standard Admiralty version of the class with the exception of her flat-sided funnels and higher freeboard. Service history =Royal Navy= Patrician was one of two Thornycroft M-class destroyers ordered as part of the February 1915 Fourth War Programme. The keel was laid down by Thornycroft & Company at their Southampton yard in June 1915. The destroyer was launched on 5 June 1916 and completed in August 1916.Friedman 2009, p. 309 Patrician saw service throughout World War I. After commissioning, she was assigned to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla of the Grand Fleet from 1916 to 1917. In October 1918, Patrician was a member of the 15th Destroyer Flotilla attached to the Grand Fleet. Following the end of the war, the Grand Fleet was abolished, forming the Atlantic Fleet, with more modern destroyers (mainly the V and W classes and the S class) supporting the fleet, while older destroyers went to subsidiary tasks or were laid up.Manning 1961, pp. 27‚Äì28. Patrician was sent to the Firth of Forth, joining the Local Defence Flotilla. By November 1919, she was laid up in reserve at HMNB Portsmouth. =Royal Canadian Navy= In 1920, the destroyer was deemed surplus by the Royal Navy. By this point Canada was looking to replace the aging cruisers operated by the Royal Canadian Navy. The Royal Navy offered a light cruiser and two destroyers to replace the old cruisers.Johnston et al. p. 833 Patrician was chosen and transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy along with her sister, . Before coming to Canada, the two destroyers required three major alterations. They needed one additional electrical engine for manoeuvering in harbour, an oil fuel galley to avoid storing coal for cooking and an enclosed bridge for service in the northern Atlantic Ocean. The total cost for these changes in both ships was $14,000. This did not include cost of adding heating.Johnston et al. p. 848 The arrival of the three new ships, the two destroyers and the light cruiser , caused the first installation of oil fuel tanks in Halifax and Victoria harbours. While sailing from the United Kingdom to Canada, it was found that while Patrician performed to expectations, the lack of service in the other two ships while awaiting transfer had caused their performances to decline.Johnston et al. p. 877 The three ships arrived at Halifax in late 1920. On 21 January 1921, the three ships departed for a cruise carrying secret documents from the Admiralty to British consulates throughout Central and North America. While on the cruise, the squadron was ordered to Puntarenas, Costa Rica, where their presence was used to strengthen the Canadian government position in negotiations over oil concessions.Johnston et al. p. 881 Following the cruise, Patrician was ordered to the west coast of Canada in 1922, where she was used primarily as a training ship, though did perform some fisheries patrols.Johnston et al. p. 942Macpherson and Barrie p. 13 On 12 December 1924, she was sent to patrol for and intercept a group of bank thieves who had robbed a bank in Canada and were attempting to escape by boat to the United States. The search was ultimately unsuccessful.Johnston et al. p. 944 By 1927, it was reported that Patrician and Patriot had reached the end of their useful life. The vessels were in need of extensive repair and were showing signs of wear. By the end of the year the King government decided to replace the aging destroyers with two on loan from the United Kingdom and two purpose-built destroyers.Johnston et al. p. 1008 Patrician was put up for sale in 1929 and was broken up at Esquimalt, British Columbia that same year.

Other programs let visitors be keeper or junior keeper for the day, take part in one of the penguin feeds, or (for certified SCUBA divers) take a 45-minute swim with the penguins. Facilities Living Coasts had a cafe that overlooked Torbay and the Tradewinds gift shop, themed on a colonial harbour. Both facilities were open to visitors and non-visitors. Closure On 23 March 2020, Living Coasts, along with other visitor attractions nationwide, temporarily closed during the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent lockdown. On 11 June, the House of Commons debated the reopening of zoos amid mounting concerns that many could face permanent closure without visitor revenue. On 15 June, the Government announced zoos could re-open to the public with strict social distancing rules in place, however Living Coasts remained closed. On 16 June, Wild Planet Trust announced the permanent closure of Living Coasts due to its costbase, need to make efficiencies and inability to afford required substantial maintenance. Homes were sought for the zoo's animals. Despite euthanasia fears, on 19 June 2020 it was then announced that homes had been found for all animals.

History The group was formed in 2000 when Ken Livingstone, Mayor of London tried to reduce the number of pigeons in Trafalgar Square. These reductions were to be made by a number of techniques, including the removal of the Trafalgar Square bird food seller's licence. While feeding was still legal, feeders alleged that they were subjected to a period of intimidatory harassment in late October‚Äìearly December 2002, during the course of which a Harris's Hawk was also introduced. Argument People feeding pigeons in Trafalgar Square c.1993STTSP argued that completely removing the bird's food was cruel and would lead to a large number of them dying of starvation. They said that reducing the bird's food source over a longer time scale would result in the reduction of the population as they would have to find an alternative food source. Ken Livingstone claimed that the reduction in the number of birds in the Square was to create a \\"more pleasant environment.\\" In the run up to the ban Trafalgar Square had undergone a ¬£25 million renovation and ¬£140,000 worth of damage had been caused to Nelson's Column as a result of bird droppings. Agreement Following the alleged period of harassment STTSP eventually went into an agreement with the Greater London Authority in that there would be a reduction in bird numbers so long as this was carried out through non-cruel means, via food reduction instead of starvation. The group were then allowed to feed the birds at 7:30 a.m. once a day. This approach saw a reduction in bird numbers in Trafalgar Square from 4000 to around 200. This restriction was to last until October 2008. =Agreement rescinded= In 2003 Ken Livingstone and the GLA rescinded their agreement with STTSP and made it illegal for anyone to feed the birds in Trafalgar Square; the penalty for doing so was set at ¬£50. On 10 September 2007 bye-laws were secured that ensured bird feeding was banned throughout the entire square and surrounding areas, with a higher fine of ¬£500 if this law was broken.

The Five were longshoremen and union members of Local 1422 of the International Longshoremen's Association. They were peacefully protesting a Danish freight company's use of non-union workers on the Charleston docks when a fight broke out between picketing workers and a police force. The Charleston Five were arrested along with four others and were held on felony charges which could have carried a prison sentence of up to 10 years.  The Protest On 19 January a ship from Danish Nordana's shipping Lines docked in the Charleston port and employed 19 non-unionized workers to unload the cargo. This company that had used the services of the Charleston Union Labors for 23 years had decided to end this association on 1999. It was the region of the union International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) local 1422 and they decided to picket against it. With this kind of preparation and continuous provocation by the police, including racist taunts, the picketing longshoremen got in touch with ILA 1422A mechanics union and Locals 1771. By nightfall there were almost 130 longshoremen picketing, though some media suggested the number could have been up to 300. Then as the leadership went ahead to figure out what the intention was, the protesters threw rocks, bottles, and railroad ties at the police.\\"South Carolina Attorney General hands over Charleston Case\\" Bartleme, Tony. Charleston Post and Courier (reprint). 11 October 2001. 14 August 2010. The police started baton charge, gas shell firing and even charged an armored vehicle at the longshoremen. Trial The Five's arrests set off a firestorm of political implications and finger pointing and allegedly some South Carolina officials were using the arrests as political fulcrums to further their careers. In October 2001, the case's prosecutor, South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon publicly compared the Charleston Five to the terrorists who had destroyed the twin towers and world trade center the month before. The backlash from this comment was such that Condon soon removed himself as prosecutor and appointed 1st Circuit Solicitor, Walter Bailey as his replacement. With mounting worldwide protest and international solidarity for the Charleston 5, they were finally freed of all charges in November 2001, after one year of trial, throughout which they were kept under house arrest.

The film is a crime drama revolving around a kidnapping plot. Elizabeth (Dani√®le G√©gauff) sends telegrams to her old boyfriend Ben (Dallesandro) in New York City and to her younger sister L√©o (Schneider) in Rome to join her in Paris, where she is selling her dead father's estate. The scenario was written by Rivette in collaboration with Eduardo de Gregorio and Suzanne Schiffman, with dialogue by de Gregorio. Distributed by Roissy Films. Filming Merry-Go-Round was conceived in the aftermath of the collapse of Rivette's projected four-film series Scenes de la vie parallele (of which only Duelle and Noro√Æt were completed). Schneider exited the film during shooting, and in some scenes L√©o is played by Hermine Karagheuz. In an interview with Serge Daney and Jean Narboni, Rivette describes the film's process: \\"We started work with the two actors, and after 8 days, things were going very badly. It was like a machine that, once set in motion, must continue running despite changing regimes, forced or arbitrary accelerations, until the energy was all burned up, exhausted.... We had a starting point of course, and then we made up the beginning of a story, with a father who had disappeared, but all along we told ourselves, this is just a pretext for Maria and Joe to get to know each other.I like that idea: two people get together because a third, who has arranged to meet them, does not show up. There have no choice but to get to know each other. It's a situation I imagined in the context of the Resistance. Thinking about it again later, I think it was the subject of Robert Hossein's Nuit des espions. And since I didn't feel like making a film about the Resistance or the terrorist underground, it became that more banal situation, two people convoked by a third who is only the sister of the one and the girlfriend of the other. But since the relationship between Maria and Joe rapidly became hostile, we were forced to develop the story-line; from a mere pretext it took on a disproportionate importance. Maybe that gives the film a certain vagabond charm, I don't know, but it really is a film with a first half-hour that's quite coherent, and then it searches for itself three times.\\" References External links * 1981 films 1981 crime drama films French crime drama films French-language films English-language films Films directed by Jacques Rivette French films 1981 drama films ","title":"Merry-Go-Round (1981 film)"},{"id":"13247742","text":"Anna Burns (born 1962) is an author from Northern Ireland.

Reverse of the 5000 lira banknote (1981-1994) The Mevl√¢na Museum, located in Konya, Turkey, is the mausoleum of Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi, a Persian Sufi mystic also known as Mevl√¢na or Rumi. It was also the dervish lodge (tekke) of the Mevlevi order, better known as the whirling dervishes. Sultan 'Ala' al-Din Kayqubad, the Seljuk sultan who had invited Mevl√¢na to Konya, offered his rose garden as a fitting place to bury Rumi's father, Baha' ud-Din Walad (also written as Bahaeddin Veled), when he died on 12 January 1231. When Mevl√¢na died on 17 December 1273 he was buried next to his father. Mevl√¢na's successor H√ºsamettin √áelebi decided to build a mausoleum (Kubbe-i- Hadra) over the grave of his master. The Seljuk construction, under architect Badr al-Din Tabrizi, was finished in 1274. G√ºrc√º Hatun, the wife of the Seljuk Emir Suleyman Pervane, and Emir Alameddin Kayser funded the construction. The cylindrical drum of the dome originally rested on four pillars. The conical dome is covered with turquoise faience. However several sections were added until 1854. Selimoƒülu Abd√ºlvahit decorated the interior and performed the woodcarving of the catafalques. The decree of 6 April 1926 confirmed that the mausoleum and the dervish lodge (Dergah) were to be turned into a museum. The museum opened on 2 March 1927. In 1954 it was renamed as \\"Mevl√¢na Museum\\". One enters the museum through the main gate (Devisan Kapƒ±sƒ±) to the marble-paved courtyard. The kitchen of the dervishes (Matbah) and the Hurrem Pasha tomb, built during the reign of S√ºleyman the Magnificent, are located on the right side. On the left side are 17 dervish cells lined up, covered with small domes, and built during the reign of Murad III. The kitchen was also used for educating the dervishes, teaching them the Sema. The ·π£adirvan (washing fountain) in the middle of the courtyard was built by Yavuz Sultan Selim. One enters the mausoleum and the small mosque through the Tomb gate (T√ºrbe Kapisi). Its two doors are decorated with Seljuk motifs and a Persian text from mollah Abdurrahman Cami dating from 1492. It leads into the small Tilavet Room (Tilavet Odasƒ±) decorated with rare and precious Ottoman calligraphy in the s√ºl√ºs, nesih, and talik styles. In this room the Koran was continuously recited and chanted before the mausoleum was turned into a museum. One enters the mausoleum from the Tilavet Room through a silver door made, according to an inscription on the door, by the son of Mehmed III in 1599. On the left side stand six coffins in rows of three of the dervishes (Horasan erler) who accompanied Mevl√¢na and his family from Belkh. Opposite to them on a raised platform, covered by two domes, stand the cenotaphs belonging to the descendants of the Mevl√¢na family (wife and children) and some high-ranking members of the Mevlevi order. The sarcophagus of Mevl√¢na is located under the green dome (Kibab'ulaktab). It is covered with brocade, embroidered in gold with verses from the Koran. This, and all other covers, were a gift of sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1894. The actual burial chamber is located below it. Next to Mevl√¢na's sarcophagus are several others, including the sarcophagi of his father Bahaeddin Veled and his son Sultan Veled. The wooden sarcophagus of Mevl√¢na dates from the 12th century now stands over the grave of his father. It is a masterpiece of Seljuk woodcarving. The silver lattice, separating the sarcophagi from the main section, was built by Ilyas in 1579. The Ritual Hall (Semahane) was built under the reign of S√ºleyman the Magnificent at the same time as the adjoining small mosque. In this hall the dervishes used to perform the Sema, the ritual dance, on the rhythm of musical instruments such as, the kemence (a small violin with three strings), the keman (a larger violin), the halile (a small cymbal), the daire (a kind of tambourine), the kud√ºm (a drum), the rebab (a guitar) and the flute, played once by Mevl√¢na himself. All these instruments are on display in this room, together with an ancient Kir≈üehir praying rug (18th century), dervish clothes (Mevl√¢na's included) and four crystal mosque lamps (16th century, Egyptian Mameluk period). In this room one can also see a rare Divan-i-Kebir (a collection of lyric poetry) from 1366 and two fine specimens of Masnavis (books of poems written by Mevl√¢na) from 1278 and 1371. The adjoining small mosque (Masjid) is now used for the exhibition of a collection of old, illustrated Korans and extremely valuable prayer rugs. There is also a box (Sakal-i ·π¢erif), decorated with nacre, containing the Holy Beard of Muhammad. The mausoleum was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 5000 lira banknotes of 1981‚Äì1994.Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey . Banknote Museum: 7.

Britton & Son in 1899. Originally it had sandstone abutments but when it was moved to Billie Creek Village they were replaced with concrete abutments with sandstone showing. Note: This includes , Site map, and Accompanying photographs. History The bridge was named after the nearby B&O; Railroad station at its original location (). It was also known as the \\"Harry Wolf Bridge.\\" Wolf owned the land near the bridge. The portal was later modified into a J. J. Daniels Arch while the original angular Britton Arch framing is still visible from the inside. A letter from J. J. Daniels dated May 18, 1899, says that he had made a bid to build the bridge for $680. Since J. A. Britton was awarded the contract it can be assumed that his bid was less than Daniels.http://www.indianacrossings.org/bridgeLinks/14-61-25.html According to Historic American Engineering Record documentation of the bridge, it was repaired in 1940 by the Works Progress Administration. It was built by Britton who built approximately 40 bridges in three Indiana counties, Parke, Putnam, and Vermillion, during a 33-year period. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

It was run on dirt over a distance of six furlongs. Raced in the pre-grading era, for most of its existence the race was one of the premier shorter distance competitions for two-year-old horses in the United States. The first running of the United States Hotel Stakes took place in 1880 and was raced for three-year-olds until 1895 when it was changed to a competition for two-year-olds. The inaugural race was won by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Luke Blackburn. It was so successful that in 1901 the New York Times was reporting that it was a \\"rich\\" race because it offered a purse of $10,000.https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E3DD1130E132A2575BC1A96E9C946097D6CF While Man o' War, who would be ranked No.1 in the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century, and other great horses in the history of American Thoroughbred racing won this race, it is also notable for two notable horses who did not. In 1929, the ensuing year's U.S. Triple Crown champion and future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Gallant Fox finished second. Whirlaway, another U.S. Triple Crown champion and future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee, suffered the same fate in 1940. The last horse to win the United States Hotel Stakes was Career Boy, a colt owned by prominent horseman Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney who went on to be voted the American Champion Male Turf Horse for 1956. The runner-up was Canadian Champ, the 1956 Canadian Horse of the Year and Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inductee.

Most of his career was spent with Plymouth Argyle (in two spells) and with Birmingham City during their most successful period in the 1950s, and he also had a short spell with Portsmouth. He is credited with being responsible for Birmingham's fans adopting Harry Lauder's song \\"Keep right on to the end of the road\\" as their anthem. Life and career Govan was born in Glasgow. He played football for Bridgeton Boys Club, was capped for Scotland at schoolboy level, and played one youth international match for his country, against Wales youth team in 1945. He was recommended to Plymouth Argyle manager Jack Tresadern by Alec Hardie, head of the club's Scottish scouting network, who thought he would go on to represent Scotland at senior level. After a successful trial, he was eventually persuaded to make the long trip south, and he signed for Argyle at the end of August 1946. Govan admits there was an incentive apart from the football: He scored 30 goals in 117 appearances for Plymouth, and was part of the team that won the Third Division South championship in the 1951‚Äì52 season. When Birmingham City showed an interest in signing Govan, he was reluctant to move away from the Plymouth area, as his wife was a local girl, but when manager Bob Brocklebank promised them a house, the deal went ahead. Govan signed for Birmingham in June 1953 for a fee of ¬£6,500. He scored on his debut and finished that season with eight goals.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 189. With the addition of the prolific Eddy Brown to regular top scorer Peter Murphy, a former league-winner with Tottenham Hotspur, combined with the creativity of Govan, fellow Plymouth winger Gordon Astall and Welsh international Noel Kinsey who had all joined the club the previous year, the Birmingham forward line outclassed any other in the Second Division. All five reached double figures as the club won the 1954-55 championship.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 190. Though unable to score at such a rate in the top flight, the club still achieved its highest ever league finish of sixth place. They also reached the 1956 FA Cup Final, and it was during that season's FA Cup campaign that Govan was responsible for Harry Lauder's song \\"Keep right on to the end of the road\\" being adopted (and adapted) as the anthem of the Birmingham City fans. There is no definitive explanation of how this happened. One version has him heard singing it on the coach on the way to the quarter- final against Arsenal; another has him revealing in a radio interview that it was his favourite song. Either way, by the time the football correspondent of the Times came to write his Cup Final preview, the song was well enough established for him to describe how The strengths of Govan's game were hard work, pace on the wing and exceptional goalscoring ability. In April 1956, his ability was recognised by the national selectors when he received his only call-up to the full Scotland squad for a match against Austria. Unfortunately for him the international match was due to be played only three days before the Cup Final, so Birmingham refused to release him. The following season, he was Birmingham's leading scorer with 30 goals in all competitions.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 192. This was a remarkable tally, especially for a winger, and included no fewer than five hat-tricks: He also took a productive part in Birmingham's first foray into European competition in the 1955‚Äì58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, scoring both goals to beat Inter Milan 2‚Äì1 and thereby top the qualifying group. By 1958 his pace was beginning to flag. Winger Harry Hooper came in from Wolverhampton Wanderers for a ¬£20,000 fee.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 98. In March 1958 Govan was transferred to Portsmouth but failed to settle; six months later he returned to his first club Plymouth Argyle. He contributed to the club winning the Third Division championship that season before retiring the following year, and settling in Plymouth. In 2012, Govan was one of seven former players elected to Birmingham City's Hall of Fame. Govan died at his Plymouth home on 10 June 2016 at the age of 86.

It is situated on the B1195 road, geographically east from Spilsby and west from Skegness. Community Irby has a population of 150 inhabitants in 72 households. Village houses are situated on the B1195 Spilsby Road, Pinfold Lane, and along local lanes and bridleways. Most residential properties are detached and date from late 18th-century farms and cottages to late 20th-century bungalows and individual houses. There has been barn conversions, and early 21st-century new-build properties on Pinfold Lane. At the southern edge of the village is the previous Prince Albert public house, now a private house. Local recreation includes fishing, golf and cycling. The nearest local shops and public houses are at Burgh le Marsh, away by road. The small market towns of Spilsby, and Wainfleet All Saints lie in either direction along the B1195. Irby's small Grade II* listed Anglican parish church is dedicated to All Saints, and seats approximately 95 people. Medieval in origin, it is constructed in greenstone and brick, and was re- detailed in 1770, with a new chancel added in 1886.Pevsner, Nikolaus; Harris, John; The Buildings of England: Lincolnshire p. 282; Penguin, (1964); revised by Nicholas Antram (1989), Yale University Press. The Irby and Bratoft Village Hall is off Brambleberry Lane, close to the village boundary with Bratoft. The village hall is a community centre for social and group activities, and was refurbished in 2010. Planning permission was granted for the addition of a village shop and library at the hall in early 2012, with completion expected in 2013. Irby in the marsh also has a community internet radio station called County Linx Radio, the station has been running since 1 May 2013 and now has a regular listening base of over 19,000 listeners worldwide.

It is the feminine form of the Greek word barbaros () meaning \\"strange\\" or \\"foreign\\", from which the current term Barbarian is also derived. In Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox tradition, Saint Barbara was martyred by her father, who was then punished with death by lightning. As such, St. Barbara is a protectress against fire and lightning. Today, Barbara remains among the top 100 most popular names for female babies born in Chile, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. It was among the top 10 names given to baby girls born in both the Czech Republic and Georgia in 2012. The Russian variant Varvara is also returning to popularity in former Soviet republics such as Estonia, where it ranked among the top names for girls in 2012, and in Russia, where it was the eighth most popular name for girls born in 2013 in Moscow. Its popularity in the United States has declined from third place, in the 1930s, to 838th place, in 2013, when it was used for 310 newborn American girls. The Russian form of the name, Varvara, was given to just 11 American girls in 2013. In Italy Barbara was particularly popular during the 1970s: it was among the top 10 names given to girls born from 1969 to 1977, rising to 2nd place (behind Maria) in 1971.Cfr. Alda Rossebastiano- Elena Papa, I nomi di persona in Italia: dizionario storico ed etimologico, Torino, UTET, 2005 (in Italian).

On September 4, 1971, the aircraft operating the flight crashed into a mountain in Haines Borough, about 18 miles west of Juneau, Alaska while on approach for landing. All 111 people aboard were killed. It was the first fatal jet aircraft crash involving Alaska Airlines, and remained the deadliest single-aircraft accident in United States history until June 24, 1975, when Eastern Air Lines Flight 66 crashed.  Flight Crew  The Captain of the flight was Richard C. Adams, age 41. Adams had 13,870 flight hours, including 2,688 hours on the Boeing 727. Piloting the aircraft at the time of the accident was First Officer Leonard D. Beach, age 32. Beach had 5,000 flight hours, with 2,100 of them on the Boeing 727.James J. Carson, age 30, was the Second Officer and had 2,850 flight hours, including about 2,600 hours on the Boeing 727. Beach and Carson were both hired by Alaska Airlines in 1966, and Adams had been with the airline since 1955. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) later determined that all three flight crew members were current and qualified to operate the flight, and there was no evidence of any conditions which would have adversely affected the performance of their duties.  Aircraft  The aircraft was a Boeing 727-100 with U.S. registry N2969G manufactured in 1966 as c/n 19304 (Manufacturer's Serial Number 287). It was initially operated by Pacific Air Lines, which later became part of Hughes Airwest. On April 8, 1970, ownership of the aircraft was transferred to Hughes. Shortly thereafter, on September 25, 1970 Hughes leased it to Alaska Airlines. It had accumulated 11,344 flight hours at the time of the accident. The aircraft was powered by three Pratt & Whitney JT8D-7B turbofan engines. The NTSB determined that the aircraft and engines were properly maintained and in good working order at the time of the accident.  Accident flight  On September 4, 1971, Alaska Airlines Flight 1866 (Air Traffic Control call sign \\"Alaska 66\\") was scheduled to depart Anchorage, Alaska (ANC), with intermediate stops in Cordova (CDV), Yakutat (YAK), Juneau (JNU), and Sitka, Alaska (SIT) before continuing to Seattle, Washington (SEA). The flight departed ANC on time at 9:13 a.m. and the first stop at CDV was uneventful, apart from a minor issue with a cargo door which caused a short delay. The aircraft departed CDV at 10:34 and landed at YAK at 11:07. The next leg of the route to JNU, the accident flight, departed YAK at 11:35 a.m. with 104 passengers and 7 crew aboard. At 11:46 the crew contacted Anchorage air traffic control and reported they were at Flight Level 230 (FL230 or 23,000 feet), 65 miles (104 km) east of Yakutat. The controller issued a clearance to descend at pilots' discretion to cross the PLEASANT intersection at 10,000 feet, and gave them a clearance limit of HOWARD intersection. The controller then gave them the current altimeter setting at JNU and requested they report passing 11,000 feet in the descent. At 11:51 the crew informed the controller they were leaving FL230 descending to be level at 10,000 feet at PLEASANT intersection. At 11:54 the controller instructed the crew to stop their descent at 12,000 feet and changed the clearance limit to PLEASANT intersection where they could expect to hold. They reported level at 12,000 feet less than a minute later. The controller explained that he had to change the clearance due to another aircraft in the airspace near JNU. A Piper PA-23 Apache, N799Y, had departed JNU at 11:44 en route to Whitehorse and had reported in the vicinity of HOWARD intersection. The Piper's altitude was unknown and there was some confusion as to the route it was supposed to be flying. Flight 1866 acted as a communication relay between the controller and N799Y for several transmissions. At 11:58 the flight reported passing PLEASANT and entering the holding pattern there. The controller acknowledged the report and re-cleared them to HOWARD intersection. He then asked them to confirm they were still level at 12,000 feet and asked if they were \\"on top\\" of the clouds at that altitude. The crew replied they were level at 12,000, but in the clouds and \\"on instruments\\". At 12:00, the controller repeated the new clearance limit to hold at HOWARD, and told them they could expect to hold there until 12:10. At 12:01 the crew reported entering the holding pattern at HOWARD at 12,000 feet. At 12:07, the controller asked for their current location in the holding pattern, and direction from HOWARD. The crew reported they were turning on the inbound leg of the hold, joining the localizer course inbound towards HOWARD. The controller then cleared the flight for the straight-in LDA approach to Runway 8 and instructed them to cross HOWARD inbound at or below 9,000 feet. The crew acknowledged the clearance and reported leaving 12,000 feet. The LDA approach consisted of a localizer providing horizontal guidance to the crew. Vertical guidance was provided by instructions on the approach chart; the procedure involved descending to various published altitudes upon crossing specific intersections between the localizer and a nearby VOR station. The localizer was not equipped with distance measuring equipment at the time of the accident. At 12:08, the Anchorage controller asked them to report their current altitude and the crew responded, \\"...leaving five thousand five... four thousand five hundred.\\" The crew was then instructed to contact Juneau Tower. The crew acknowledged the transmission and changed to the tower frequency. The flight checked on to the tower frequency, reporting over BARLOW intersection. The tower controller replied, \\"Alaska 66, understand...I didn't copy the intersection...,\\" and continued his transmission, giving them the current weather conditions and runway in use, and asked them to report over BARLOW. Part of this transmission was recorded on the CVR of the flight, however the recording ended partway through the transmission. There were no further transmissions from Flight 1866. At approximately 12:15 the aircraft struck the eastern slope of a canyon in the Chilkat Range of the Tongass National Forest at the 2500-foot level, 18.5 miles west of Juneau. The aircraft exploded on impact. According to the CVR and FDR, there was not even \\"a last-second awareness\\" among the crew that a collision with terrain was imminent. When the crew stopped responding JNU tower notified local authorities in Juneau, who immediately began a search for the aircraft. A few hours later, the wreckage was located on the eastern slope of the Chilkat ridge, west of Juneau airport at the coordinates . There were no survivors. Two witnesses in the area of the Chilkat Mountains stated that they heard a low-flying jet aircraft, but could not see it because of clouds and low visibility, which they estimated at 200‚Äì300 feet. They described the sound of the engines as normal. A short time later they heard an explosion. A third witness in the area saw a low flying plane disappear into the clouds, but did not report hearing any sound.  Investigation  The U.S. NTSB investigated the accident. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) were recovered from the crash site and read out. The wreckage was inspected, and pertinent items were removed for further study by both the NTSB and the various manufacturers. After determining that there were no apparent issues with the crew's qualifications or the aircraft, their investigation focused on the navigational equipment and techniques used for the approach. Both navigation radio receivers on the aircraft were found to be in good working order, and all ground-based navigation stations were likewise operating properly. From the CVR recording it was determined that the crew did not use the audio identification features of the navigation radios. Further, they did not use all available navigational aids to help determine their position, though it is noted that the approach they were performing did not specifically require the use of those facilities. In addition the NTSB found there was potentially a lack of crew coordination between the two pilots in their navigation radio tuning procedures. Based on the crew's conversation and the flight's erroneous position report over BARLOW intersection, the NTSB noted that the Captain's navigation radio had apparently presented the crew with consistently false information at several points along the approach path. No reason for the false indications could be determined. The NTSB also found that ATC had used proper procedures in handling flight 1866. The small aircraft that entered the airspace during their descent might have been a distraction for both the controller and the pilots. The NTSB Final Report was released on October 11, 1972. The investigation found that the following factors contributed to the accident: Findings: The probable cause of the accident was the following:  Notes  The NTSB investigation examined the idea that some sort of military radio jamming technology could have contributed to the apparent false indications of the navigational radios before the accident. The report found no evidence that such interference had taken place and it was discounted as a possible cause. Interestingly, this type of problem is used as a plot device in famed aviation writer Ernest K. Gann's 1973 novel Band of Brothers. In the book a Boeing 727 crashes after receiving false navigational information as a result of military radio jamming.

The 20-year-old Kohner, a highly literate and sophisticated Bavarian √©migr√© shared a nostalgia for Europe with the working-class von Stroheim, The topic of pre-war Vienna stirred von Stroheim‚Äôs memories of his childhood and youth. A story began to take shape with the central themes built around the Prater, Vienna‚Äôs world famous amusement park and its main attraction, the Merry-Go-Round, from which the film‚Äôs title is taken.Koszarski, 1983 p. 91: ‚ÄúVon Stroheim knew exactly what he wanted to do next: rebuild the Vienna that had disappeared forever‚Äù after World War I.Kindley, 2009 Producer Irving Thalberg encouraged von Stroheim to proceed with writing the script, but with a caveat fully establishing Thalberg‚Äôs oversight: von Stroheim was not to be part of the cast in the production, a condition that would provide Thalbert and Universal with the option of replacing von Stroheim as director in the midst of filming, without the expense of recasting and reshooting his character. Von Stroheim and his agent consented to this provision reluctantly.Koszarski, 1983 p. 90-91: ‚Äú...Thalberg was implicitly threatening his with removal from the production if things began to get out of hand‚Äù as had occurred during the filming of Foolish Wives. And p. 92: Thalberg‚Äôs ability to remove him as director ‚Äúmust have been a chilling blow to the confidence‚Äù that he had established with Universal since 1919. Thalberg carefully vetted von Stroheim‚Äôs screenplay submissions, ultimately paying the director $5000 for the collaboratively written scenario. In order to circumvent von Stroheim‚Äôs excessive use of film stock in a script calling for almost one thousand scenes, Thalberg insisted that each scene be limited by pre-timed estimates in continuity, to ensure the picture emerged at ‚Äúan acceptable length.‚ÄùKoszarski, 1983 p. 91-92, p. 93: ‚Äú...a 976 scene version‚Ä¶‚Äù of the script approved by von Stroheim. Production Merry-Go-Round went into production on 25 August 1922. On 6 October 1922, after six weeks, Universal removed director Von Stroheim from the project and immediately replaced him with director Rupert Julian. Shooting was completed on 8 January, 1923. The production, from the beginning, was fraught with internecine struggles pitting Universal executives against Von Stroheim and his technical assistants over content, scheduling and budgetary control of the film. Koszarski, 1983 p. 92: The film preparations went forward ‚Äúin an atmosphere of uneasy truce‚Ä¶‚Äù Universal unit production manager for the film, James Winnard Hum, serving as proxy for head of production Thalberg, was daily on the set and in direct communication with Von Stroheim and his advisors. Mutual recriminations and accusations of bad faith abounded on both sides. Von Stroheim cultivated a ‚Äúthem vs. us‚Äù atmosphere among his staff and workers, most of whom were loyalists enlisted from the his recently completed Foolish Wives. Koszarski, 1983 p.101-102: ‚ÄúThe von Stroheim production unit was carried over directly from Foolish Wives‚Ä¶‚Äù And: Thalberg sent down his unit production manager Hull ‚Äúand gave him full authority over all expenses and details of physical production‚Ä¶[von Stroheim] never took [Hum‚Äôs authority] seriously [and] ignored the manager‚Äôs presence.‚Äù And p. 104: Von Stroheim‚Äôs ‚Äúgeneral air of disrespect for...the studio hierarchy‚Äù and referring to Hum as a ‚Äústool pigeon‚Äù while on the set. Production manager Hum felt that von Stroheim was ‚Äústalling‚Äù on portions of the filming in order to assert his control over the shooting schedule.Koszarski, 1983 p. 103: Koszarski reports that Hum suspected von Stroheim of conspiring with his costume man Ned Lambert delayed delivery of uniforms to stop filming. Von Stroheim felt confident that an appeal to Universal president Carl Laemmle would resolve the matter in his favor, curbing Thalberg‚Äôs authority, an expectation of which he was quickly disabused.Koszarski, 1983 p. 104: ‚ÄúVon Strohiem kept promising wholesale retribution‚Äù against production managers after consultation with Carl Laemmle. And p. ‚Äú...Laemmle had already made his decision‚Äù to remove von Stroheim from Merry-Go-Round. And p. 107: Von Strohiem ‚Äúconfronted‚Äù Laemmle with his arguments, but ‚Äúnow it was Thalberg who was irreplaceable.‚Äù After a number of delays in filming, including the derailment of a prop streetcar, the overloading of the studio electrical system due to excessive night shooting, an inebriated lead man (Norman Kerry), the general disaffection of the extras, and delays caused by a search for an appropriate orangutan, the upper echelon at Universal mobilized against von Strohiem. Thalberg was authorized to terminate von Stroheim as director. Biographer Richard Koszarski offers an exerpt from Thalberg‚Äôs notification to von StohiemKoszarski, 1983 p. 103-105 And p. ‚Äú...practically the entire top echelon of the studio‚Ä¶ [personally] announced ‚Äúvon Stroheim‚Äôs departure to the cast and crew.: Upon von Stroheim‚Äôs departure, Universal instantly replaced him with Rupert Julian. The production proceeded with most of von Strohiem‚Äôs crew and cast intact but some expressions of discontent at von Strohiem‚Äôs departure. Koszarski, 1983 p. 109: ‚Äú...few of von Stroheim‚Äôs people‚Äù abandoned the film when he was dismissed. And: Director Julian reported ‚Äúvarying degrees of antagonism‚Äù from von Stroheim sympathizers who stayed with the production. The question as to the relative contributions to Merry-Go-Round from von Stroheim and Julian remain in dispute. Based on testimony by Hum, Louis Germonprez (von Strohiem‚Äôs business manager) and von Stroheim agreed that about a third of the scenes had been completed by von Stroheim. Thalberg and Julian reported that about 25% had been completed (271 scenes). Though Julian‚Äôs contribution appears to have closely followed the original script, few of the von Stroheim-directed scenes were incorporated into the picture.Koszarski, 1983 p. 108-109: ‚ÄúHow much of the film [is von Stroheim‚Äôs, in concept if not in execution] has long been debated‚Ä¶‚Äù And p. 110: ‚Äú...a look at the script shows that Julian followed von Strohiem‚Äôs continuity like a blueprint.‚Äù And p. 110: ‚Äú...few von Strohiem- directed directed scenes remain in the picture‚Ä¶[but] Julian stayed remarkably close to von Stroheim‚Äôs original ideas.‚Äù Theme Merry-Go-Round represents the earliest appearance of a female protagonist as the center of interest in a von Stroheim film, a significant departure from the centrality of the male Prussian officer and pseudo-aristocrat that von Stroheim himself had made infamous as ‚Äúthe man you love to hate.‚Äù Though not fully realized in this film, his ‚Äútentative shift in focus from the seducer to the victim marks a new phase in von Stroheim‚Äôs career.‚Äù The character of Count Maximilian (Norman Kerry) is presented as less a characriture of a nobleman than an individual capable of ‚Äúdramatic maturation‚Äù, another shift that distinguishes Merry-Go- Round. Heroine Agnes Urban‚Äôs (Mary Philbin) emotional struggles are examined with empathy, marking the first time von Stroheim creates ‚Äúa dramatically successful female, an indication of a general shift in his interest.‚ÄùKoszarski, 1983 p.97-98 Von Stroheim‚Äôs nostalgic recreation of Vienna‚Äôs Belle √âpoque serves as a sentimental tribute to the Hapsburg monarchy and its ancien regime, both of which suffered social and economic collapse during World War I. Despite acknowledging the decadence and abuses of the Austrian ruling class, Merry-Go-Round presents their decline and fall with regret. Von Strohiem‚Äôs obsession with ‚Äúminute details and rituals‚Äù reveals more than von Stroheim‚Äôs concern with the precise cinematic depiction of props, but a tribute to Austrian aristocratic social order, whose military echelon he portrayed with dignity and fidelity. Von Stroheim arranged for the transportation of the original royal carriage of the deceased Emperor Franz Joseph to Hollywood for use in the film. More than a relic from the Hapsburg dynasty, it serves as a tribute to the lost Austrian Empire.Koszarski, 1983 p.99 Reception Despite the fact that von Strohiem‚Äôs name had been expunged from the credits, viewers who attended the premiere at New York‚Äôs Rivoli Theater were well aware that he had conceived, if not executed, Merry-Go- Round. Reviews were mixed, but the picture was ranked the year‚Äôs second best film by The Film Daily.Koszarski, 1983 p. 108: ‚Äúconcept‚Äù was von Strohiem‚Äôs And p. 110: Von Stroheim‚Äôs name had been removed ‚Äúfrom all credits.‚Äù The film was the eighth most successful that year at the box office in the United States and Canada.Rentals in US and Canada - see Variety list of box office champions for 1923 References Sources *Kindley, 2009.

Biography = Childhood = Ernst Florian Winter was born in Vienna, Austria, the oldest of eight children of the sociologist and former third vice mayor of Vienna (1934‚Äì36) Ernst Karl Winter. Ernst Florian Winter attended the humanistic grammar school in the Klostergasse in W√§hring, after which he attended Neulandschule. He was a member of the Austrian Catholic Bund Neuland. Alfons Stilfried and the brothers Otto and Fritz Molden were in the same group. Winter accompanied his father, Ernst Karl, very early in his political career. Regularly there were hour-long discussions at their family residences, attended by people such as Alfred Missong, August Maria Knoll, Hans Karl von Zessnerspitzberg, and Engelbert Dollfuss. When federal chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg returned from meeting with Hitler at the Berghof on 12 February 1938, he visited the Winters' home to speak with Ernst Karl Winter. The 14-year-old Ernst Florian Winter kept the minutes of this discussion. A few days before the Anschluss in March 1938, Ernst Karl Winter fled Austria to Switzerland, for political reasons, at the urging of Hans Kelsen. He had to leave his family behind. When the Gestapo came to the Winters' house and could not find Ernst Karl, they took his son, Ernst Florian, to the police station. Ernst Florian's mother, Margarete, managed to get him released on the same day. A few days later, Margarete, her son Ernst Florian and his six siblings fled from Austria (his youngest sibling was born after the family moved to the United States). = Emigration to America = Via Switzerland, France, and England, the Winters emigrated to New York City in October 1939. They were one of the first non-Jewish emigrant families. Because there were no Austrian clubs in New York, many Austrian immigrants met in the Winters' house almost every Sunday. At the beginning of 1939, Ernst Karl Winter founded the Austrian American Center in New York, which was the first non-party national committee. This committee regularly organised demonstrations and marches and released weekly publications. There were almost no juveniles under the emigrants, nevertheless Ernst Florian Winter was voted as the leader. A few dozen juveniles regularly celebrated parades on Fifth Avenue. Together with his father, Ernst Florian met U.S. vice president Henry Wallace. Winter did not join the \\"√ñsterreichische Bataillon\\" initiated by Otto von Habsburg, because he had his skiing instructor exam. As a member of the \\"Ski Patrol System\\" he received a letter from the U.S. minister of war, who planned to set up a mountain division. On his 18th birthday, he joined the U.S. Army, though he wrote on his application form: \\"volunteer to join for the liberation of my home country Austria, but I am not willing to kill.\\" The main reason of his strict attitude was that he had seen pictures of the Nazi concentration camps at his father's publishing house, which weighed heavily on him. In 1943, Winter gained American citizenship, and in 1944 he earned a degree from the University of Michigan. = Liberation of the homeland = Winter took part in the invasion of Normandy. He was the first Austro-American who marched into the Innviertel on 4 May 1945 with the 86th division of the 3rd U.S. Army at Burghausen, where he stayed at the Brauerei Schnaitl. On orders from Baron Georg Ludwig von Trapp, Winter had a look at a mansion in Aigen that was the summer residence of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler. There he discovered that the house chapel had a swastika carved on the altar. A few weeks after the liberation, Winter had to leave his homeland again. His division went to Japan, where they had similar duties. = Academic studies and doctrine = After Winter had returned to the U.S., he graduated with a degree in social science from Columbia College. Studies in political science and international relations at Columbia University followed. He finished his Master of Arts degree in 1951. His topic was \\"Comparative analyses of the Renner-regime 1918 and 1945\\". He finished his Ph.D. in 1954; his dissertation topic was \\"Austrian agriculture between 1918 and 1945.\\" Winter began his academic career as professor of history and political science at Iona College in New Rochelle, New York. He also served as a visiting professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Princeton University, Georgetown University, and Indiana University. Winter in 1999 In 1960, he returned to Austria to establish the field of study of political science. In 1964, he was chosen by the state secretary Bruno Kreisky to be the foundation director of the Diplomatic University of Vienna, where he served as a professor for decades. He also began work as an assistant at the Institute for Higher Studies (IHS) at its founding in 1963. He was the director of the IHS between 1967 and 1968. He was married to Johanna von Trapp (1919‚Äì1994), the daughter of Georg Ludwig von Trapp. They were married from 1948 to 1994 and had seven children: Ernst Florian (1949‚Äì1969), Johanna, Florian, Notburga, Agathe, Hemma, and Severin. From 1964 to 1977 they lived together in Schloss Eichb√ºchel in Katzelsdorf. There they hosted the \\"Eichb√ºchler-Gespr√§che\\" and Austria seminars for ten years; visiting professors included Oskar Morgenstern, Paul Lazarsfeld, Friedrich Heer, and Henry Kissinger. = Diplomatic career = Between 1968 and 1970, Winter was director of social science at UNESCO in Paris. At the same time, he was chief negotiator between the U.S. and the People's Republic of China. Winter was member of the UN commission of the United States for the development of China strategies between 1970 and 1972. In January 1970 Henry Kissinger sent him to ask Chinese-Canadian academic and political activist Paul Lin to relay a confidential message to Zhou Enlai conveying Kissinger‚Äôs desire to meet Chinese leaders in view of a visit by President Nixon to China. In January 1972, he was the first American invited by Chinese prime minister Zhou Enlai to a two-month stay at the institute for foreign politics in China. In 1974, as part of UNEP-FAO, Winter was chairman of the first mission of the UN agency in China. In the following year, he led the China Mission of UNEP- WHO.  Personal engagement  = Agriculture in Kosovo = Starting in the 1990s, Winter cultivated an organic self-sustaining area in the Defereggental in eastern Tyrol. He participated in an environment program of the United Nations called \\"Agriculture in Kosovo\\"; as part of that program, he taught at the University of Business and Technology in Pri≈°tina. = Austrian service abroad = Since 2009 Winter was the chairman of the international council of the Austrian Service Abroad.  Awards  * On 3 May 2008, Winter was given the Egon Ranshofen-Wertheimer Award in Braunau-am-Inn. Austrian expatriates receive this prize for dedication to Austria. Winter shared this award with the Trapp Family and the actor Dietmar Sch√∂nherr. * Federal president Heinz Fischer awarded Winter on 10 August 2010 the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class * On 10 October 2010 in Pfaffst√§tten, Winter (with Mirie Rushani) was awarded the Weltmenschpreis 2010. * In 2012, he was given a Decoration for Services to the Liberation of Austria References  External links  *3.

It is the family burial plot of the Sedgwick family in Stockbridge Cemetery, Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and gets its nickname from its shape and layout. Description The burial sites are arranged around the graves of Theodore Sedgwick (1746‚Äì1813), patriarch of the prominent Sedgwick family of New England and a justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (among other positions), and his wife, Pamela Dwight Sedgwick (1753‚Äì1807). The graves of the others, who include in-laws, servants, and family pets, form concentric circles around the center, with the buried grouped by familial affiliation, and laid to rest with their feet toward the center. This contrasts with the orientation of the other graves in the cemetery, which (in classic fashion) face east, toward the rising sun, Jerusalem (with all its significance), and the hoped-for Resurrection. It has been said that this arrangement of the graves sees to it that on Judgment Day, when the Sedgwicks rise to face their judge, they will only have to look at other Sedgwicks.John P. Marquand, Jr., quoted in \\"Sedgwick Pie\\".

A perpetual scholar, he studied in the University of Marburg, the University of Berlin, the University of G√∂ttingen, and the University of Breslau. He then taught as a professor at G√∂ttingen since 1890, at Marburg since 1895, and since 1908 at the University of Heidelberg. He wrote many influential books and papers, and was instrumental in the development of New Testament Biblical criticism.Weiss, Johannes. (2007). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved September 13, 2007, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9076463 He was held in the highest regard by his contemporaries, and subsequent scholarship has continued to recognize his wide influence.F. Crawford Burkitt, Johannes Weiss: In Memoriam, The Harvard Theological Review, Cambridge University Press and Harvard Divinity School, 1915. He died in Heidelberg. Ideas Weiss made the first exegesis of the Gospels from an perspective of consistent eschatology. According to Weiss, the \\"Kingdom of God\\" was Jesus' understanding of an imminent end to history, and all continuous ethical teachings were additions made by the early Church to make Jesus' teaching relevant when the end of the world did not come about immediately. This greatly influenced several generations of Biblical scholars. As a corollary, Weiss believed that the authentic teachings of the historical Jesus would be inapplicable to those who did not hold his first- century apocalyptic worldview. Weiss also developed form criticism in its application to the New Testament, a theme expanded upon by Rudolf Bultmann and many other scholars. This tool enabled Weiss to conclude that I Corinthians is a collection of excerpts from letters by the Apostle Paul, and not a single letter in its own right.George D. Castor (review author), Johannes Weiss's Commentary on I Corinthians, The American Journal of Theology, The University of Chicago Press, 1911. Weiss is particularly notable for giving the name \\"Q\\" to the hypothetical sayings source used by the authors of the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke.Travis Brouwer, New Testament, Divinity Library. Many hold that Q stood for \\"Quelle\\", the German word for \\"source\\", but some recent scholarship indicates that the letter Q was chosen arbitrarily.John P.

Since 1 January 2010, it is part of the town Zerbst/Anhalt.  Geography  The villages G√∂dnitz and Fl√∂tz are between the towns Zerbst and Barby. Next to the villages there is the G√∂dnitz Lake which is an oxbow of the Elbe. Both villages are on the eastern side of the Elbe at the end of the moraine. The western part of G√∂dnitz/Fl√∂tz is a part of the Mittelelbe Biosphere. In the North West of G√∂dnitz the Nuthe flows into the Elbe.  History  1929 there were excavations in Fl√∂tz where some vessels were found which are assigned to the Walternienburg-Bernburg Culture. This proves that there was colonisation in Fl√∂tz already in the Neolithic age. The relatively elevated position protects the village from flood which was the reason for a very early colonisation. Already in the Iron Age there were Germanic people living at this place long time before the Slavs colonised this area in the 5th and 6th century. The history of G√∂dnitz and Fl√∂tz was connected to the East Elbe outposts of the Teutonic Order. From the first repossession attempts of Charlemagne in the 8th century to the final victory of the Teutonic Order in the 11th century G√∂dnitz and Fl√∂tz must have changed their sovereign very often. While the Christianisation of the former Slavic territory the church in Fl√∂tz was built as a solid stone building which could resist attacks from the Slavic people. The area's Christianisation took about 300 years. In 974 the villages were given to the Quedlinburg Abbey who gave them to the dukes of Saxony who gave them to the earl of Barby. When the noble family of Barby got extinct in 1659 Fl√∂tz and G√∂dnitz were taken by the Anhalt-Zerbst family. When the Anhalt-Zerbst family got extinct in 1793 with no heir the villages were given to Anhalt-Dessau where Leopold III was the Duke. After Napoleon's rule and the Congress of Vienna all the villages in the area except G√∂dnitz and Dornburg were given to the new Province Saxony in the Kingdom of Prussia while G√∂dnitz remained an enclave of Anhalt. Because of the different state membership both villages could never grow together. In the 19th century there was a school, a mayor and a parish each village. Even today you can see massive landmarks at the former border of Anhalt and Prussia. After World War II the territory of the free State of Anhalt and the Province of Saxony were combined to the Province of Saxony-Anhalt and later on in 1947 Land Saxony-Anhalt. Fl√∂tz and G√∂dnitz were now part of the county Zerbst. 1952 the Land Saxony-Anhalt was disbanded and the territory was integrated into the new GDR Bezirk Magdeburg. During the GDR rule the villages G√∂dnitz and Fl√∂tz were made one community named G√∂dnitz while Fl√∂tz became a district of it. After the German Reunification the county membership did not change, G√∂dnitz remained part of Anhalt-Zerbst. 2007 Anhalt-Zerbst was united with the counties K√∂then and Bitterfeld to a new one called Anhalt-Bitterfeld. 2010 the villages around Zerbst were added to the town which is called Zerbst/Anhalt since then. The villages are now districts of Zerbst/Anhalt. Until December 31, 2009, G√∂dnitz was an independent municipality with the associated district of Fl√∂tz . On a municipal area of 11.8 km¬≤ lived 241 inhabitants (December 31, 2008)StBA: Gebiets√§nderungen vom 01. Januar bis 31. Dezember 2010. The last mayor of G√∂dnitz was Volker Leps.
